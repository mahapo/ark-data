These publications addressed the topic in general and inspecific times and places, witchcraft,witch-hunting, images of witches,witches in art, literature, popular culture, new religious movements,witches in the past and the present, and witches in almost every imagina-ble connection, with the single exception of the one topic that is most for-eign and most absurd to modern readers, students and scholars alike:ideas and knowledge about witches. Of the many dozens or hundreds ofmodern works on witches, scarcely any have addressed the single neces-sary precondition for the prosecution, torture and execution of witches:the certainty, to those who did the hunting, that witches existed.In 1997, Stuart Clark published the first monograph since the timeof Jules Michelet to focus on pre-modern ideas about witches.1 Clarktakes early modern ideas about witchcraft seriously; indeed, he devoteshis first chapter to the language of witchcraft and the need to take ‘belief ’seriously as a motivating factor. However, Clark and the scholars begin-ning to follow his lead have retained the language of belief, thus implyingsceptical distance in the sense that the ideas in question, while sincerelyheld, were not only fallacious but also entirely subjective. We do not meanto suggest that Satan-worshipping witches actually flew across the earlymodern European skies. Rather, we concur with anthropologist GilbertLewis: ‘The very word “belief ” often implies, in its use, a judgementabout the uncertain truth or reliability of that which has been asserted;“knowledge” does not convey the same doubt. “Knowledge” is legiti-mate; “belief ” only questionably so.’2When early moderns held introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEsomething to be true, they seem generally to have knownit,and (religious)belief, in post-Voltairean usage, is not an adequate conceptual analogy. AsEdward Muir has argued, sixteenth-century Europeans held magic andwitchcraft to be real.3That certain early modern authors occasionallyexpressed doubts as to the certainty of their religious knowledge, forinstance, need not be any more unsettling to the paradigm we are pro-posing than the readiness with which physicists admit to doubts as to thenature and workings of atomic structure: despite all such doubts, whatis/was knownabout atoms or witches induces people to act in confidentways, setting off atomic bombs or burning human beings (note the simi-larity). When we refer to religious and ideological knowledge as belief, weare not only distancing ourselves from the content (a natural enoughdesire in this case), we are introducing an alien distinction between whatappear to us to be different elements of early modern Europeans’ worldview. The language of belief in witchcraft studies betrays an anachronis-tic, modernist and dismissive approach to a mental universe quite differ-ent from our own. We do not understand our role as historians to includea duty to judge the veracity of past ideas. As Ian Bostridge has argued,‘historical explanation of beliefs’ requires the historian to attempt to beneutral as regards their truth content.4We have omitted the word ‘belief ’from our vocabulary in order to present our subjects’ ideas withoutundue anachronism.Female and male witchesResearch is always most exciting when the data do not quite fit the estab-lished paradigms and explanatory models. An entire body of literature,mainly by avowed feminists,has argued that witch-hunting was in essencewoman-hunting, despite the fact that many of those executed for thecrime of witchcraft were men (see chapter 2). Various attempts have beenmade to explain away this feature of witch-hunting (see chapter 1), butnone will really do, in part because they cannot make sense of areas likeNormandy, Estonia or Iceland, where the vast majority of witches were[ 2 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"[ 3 ]INTRODUCTIONmen. A fundamental problem with previous interpretations of malewitches is that they treat their subject as anomalous, even impossible.This assumption has led to the virtual exclusion of male witches fromwitchcraft studies, especially from those concerned with issues of gender.We have set out in this book to make the male witch visible – to constructhim as a historical subject – as a first step toward a deeper understandingof the functions and role of gender in pre-modern European witch-hunt-ing and ideas about witches. Our focus is, necessarily, not on a discretebody of court cases, local events or a specific period; rather, we begin witha critique of the very considerable historiography, based on our readingsof learned demonology, statistical evidence and certain cases drawn fromwide geographical and temporal spans.The Malleus maleficarum, or Hammer of Witches, is the best-knownearly modern work on witchcraft, infamous for its misogynist statementsabout women and for its argument that most witches were women. Withvery few exceptions, modern scholars have taken a one-dimensionalview of this treatise, citing it almost exclusively to illustrate the inherentmisogyny of witch-hunting. Indeed, very few other treatises are evercited; thus, in many studies, the Malleus maleficarum has come to rep-resent ‘the’ demonological position on women and witches. It is, there-fore, an appropriate starting point for an examination of attitudestoward gender and witchcraft.The Latin word maleficus, and its feminine variant malefica, cameinto common use in the fourth century CE and were used widely in themedieval and early modern periods to denote a person who committedevil deeds by means of magic.5Maleficus/maleficais often translated as‘witch’. In the title Malleus maleficarum, the fact that the word malefi-carumis a feminine plural noun would seem to suggest that the authors,Dominican Inquisitors Heinrich Institoris (Kramer, Krämer) and JacobSprenger,6believed that all witches were female. In Latin, groups con-taining both males and females conventionally are represented by themasculine plural, even if there are more females than males in the group.introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEThe feminine plural implies an absence of males from a group; there-fore, the use of the feminine in the title Malleus maleficarum suggeststhat all witches are female.7In the text itself, however, Institoris and Sprenger use both mascu-line and feminine forms of maleficus. Indeed, the first line of the Malleusreads ‘Utrum asserere maleficos esse sit a deo [sic] catholicum quod eiusoppositum pertinaciter defendere omnino sit hereticum.’8(Whether itis so very orthodox to insist that there are witches, given that maintain-ing the opposite of this obstinately is wholly heretical?) Where onewould expect the authors to use the feminine accusative plural malefi-cas, they use the masculine maleficos. Furthermore, there are many otherreferences to malefici(masculine plural) as well as to maleficae (feminineplural), sometimes within the same sections of text. In several instances,the text refers plainly to male witches both as specific individuals and asa group. At first glance, it seems amazing that Institoris and Sprenger,notorious to modern scholars as the primary authors of the ‘witches aswomen’ paradigm, would write about witches in the masculine at all, letalone in their opening lines.Almost nothing has been published on this topic in academic treat-ments of gender and witchcraft, demonology, or the Malleus malefi-carumitself. Indeed, male witches in general are hardly to be found inwitchcraft historiography, despite the ubiquity of gender (or rather, sex)as an issue in the study of witch-hunting and ideas about witches. Thereis a kind of hole at the centre of witchcraft studies, to borrow an imagefrom Robin Briggs, into which male witches and learned discourseabout them have disappeared.9This absence is especially striking in thework of Stuart Clark, who, in an otherwise masterly analysis of earlymodern demonology, suggests that witchcraft theorists were incapableof conceptualising male witches. This blind spot in witchcraft histori-ography requires attention.Of course, the historiographical gap is a common trope with whichto introduce a historical study. But research ought to do more than add alittle plaster to existing structures. In order to offer a real contribution, it[ 4 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONought to confront and challenge those structures. In the case of this proj-ect, this means confronting a historiography committed to causal expla-nation and to a polarised, essentialising view of gender and itsrelationship to witch-hunting and ideas about witches. It also meansengaging with a strongly politicised discourse about witches: inside theacademy and without, the female witch is a potent symbol of women’soppression by men and, rather paradoxically, of women’s power.The overtly political dimension to the study of witches in earlymodern Europe demands a high level of consciousness and reflexivityregarding language, representation, and meaning. Our goal in this bookis to make what is hidden visible: not only male witches themselves, butalso the historiographical structures and politics that exclude them ashistorical subjects. This may seem threatening to some readers, espe-cially to those with a heavy investment in representing witches as essen-tially female, or in claiming the study of early modern witches as women’shistory. We disagree with these viewpoints, but we consider our workalso to be a feminist history, in Joan Wallach Scott’s sense: ‘Feminist his-tory . . . [is] not just an attempt to correct or supplement an incompleterecord of the past but a way of critically understanding how history oper-ates as a site of the production of gender knowledge.’10Though as histo-rians we are clearly in one important (professional) sense insiders, wealso consider our perspectives to be those of outsiders, and in the inter-est of transparency, we should like to point out that an atheist and a Jewhave relatively little personalinvestment in Christian approaches towitchcraft. Our ideological and professional investments are, we trust,clearly enough articulated over the course of the book.11Our concentration on male subjects may appear to subvert the fem-inist project of constructing women as historical subjects, or to diminishthe importance of the female witch. We prefer to think of it as a logicalapplication of a relational concept of gender, in which men and womenare defined and constructed in terms of one another. Andrea Cornwalland Nancy Lindisfarne have criticised the relational concept of genderon the basis that it is too narrow to admit of possibilities other than simple[ 5 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEmale–female difference. We agree with this view, and our understandingof gender incorporates those possibilities, including hierarchical differ-entiation within genders. The relational concept, nevertheless, is the coreof our concept of gender.12With this understanding of gender and its his-torical construction, male witches are neither irrelevant nor a threat; theyare necessary components of a complex phenomenon. Any endeavour tounderstand the relationship between gender and witchcraft has to takemale witches into account and explain how they ‘fit’ within the genderedframework of early modern ideas about witches; without them, we areignoring one half of the gender relationship and, necessarily, limiting ourknowledge about both men and women in early modern Europe. AsCaroline Walker Bynum has put it, ‘the study of gender is a study of howroles and possibilities are conceptualized; it is a study of one hundred per-cent, not of only fifty-one percent, of the human race.’13Willem de Blécourt has articulated a useful gender-based approachto witchcraft and witchcraft accusations in his article ‘The making of thefemale witch: Reflections on witchcraft and gender in the early modernperiod’. He argues that witches were ‘made’ locally, except whendemonic influence was adduced (as in the ‘witch-panics’); and suggeststhat ‘[a] witchcraft accusation . . . articulated the crossing of male-des-ignated boundaries rather than being restricted to a specific femalespace’.14This suggestion sees gender as embedded in and structuringsocial relations, rather than as a free-floating ‘concept’. Steve Hindleuses gender in the same functional rather than reified way in his articleon gossip, gender and authority in early modern England.15In bothinstances, the category ‘gender’ contributes to historical examination ofwomen and men, female and male spheres, and their interactions withone another.This volume is an attempt at such an explanation. Ideas aboutwitches and a number of episodes of witch-hunting serve as windowsinto gender relations at an especially fraught and vexed juncture in occidental history. The book contains three main arguments: first, thatmale witches have been excluded from witchcraft historiography and[ 6 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONthat this exclusion by modern scholars is not congruent with earlymodern understandings of witches; second, that explanations of thedynamics of witchcraft prosecutions should be applied equally to bothfemale and male witches; third, that male witches could exist within theframework of early modern ideas about witches because they wereimplicitly feminised. Although the first chapters focus on our disagree-ments with prevailing views about male witches, our conclusions are notutterly opposed to modern scholarly understandings of the relationshipbetween gender and witchcraft. Indeed, our argument that male witcheswere implicitly feminised tends to support the view that early modernEuropeans correlated witchcraft with women very closely. On the otherhand, this correlation was neither exact nor straightforward.We have attempted to maintain consciousness and reflexivityregarding language, representation, and meaning. The questions thatpropelled the first stages of this work grew out of a close reading of theMalleus maleficarum, and were as follows: what did Institoris andSprenger mean when they used the masculine malefici? Why did theysometimes write maleficiand sometimes maleficae? Were they alone infollowing this pattern of grammatical gendering, or was it the usual prac-tice in early modern witchcraft treatises? Most importantly, how muchsignificance should one attach to the language of witchcraft literature, notjust to what was said but also to the ways in which things were said?Renato Rosaldo has written that ‘no mode of composition is a neu-tral medium’.16This is as true of our own writing as it is of early modernwitchcraft theorists; if we ascribe significance to their language choices,then we must be aware of the significance of our own. In addition, wemust be conscious that we are ascribing significance to the empirical factthat there were male witches and that witchcraft theorists discussedthem. As Keith Jenkins points out, ‘facts’ are selected, distributed, andweighted in finished narratives: ‘The facts cannot themselves indicatetheir significance as though it were inherent in them. To give significanceto the facts an external theory of significance is always needed.’17In otherwords, meanings are made, not found. Roland Barthes has argued that[ 7 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEcreating meaning is the essence of what historians do: ‘The historian isnot so much a collector of facts as a collector and relater of signifiers; thatis to say, he organizes them with the purpose of establishing positivemeaning and filling the vacuum of pure, meaningless series.’18It isimportant, therefore, to be open about the kinds of assumptions andpositions that inflect the meanings one creates.An examination of the word ‘witch’ should provide a usefulapproach to our policy of disclosure. The term is unavoidable, but it isextremely problematic because of the range of meanings associated withit. To begin with, in modern English usage, the word ‘witch’ almostinvariably denotes a female person, a woman or a girl. For example, theConcise Oxford Dictionarydefines ‘witch’ in female terms, as ‘a sorcer-ess, esp. a woman supposed to have dealings with the Devil or evil spir-its.’ The Harry Potter phenomenon obliges us to comment on the word‘wizard’, which was almost never used in pre-modern sources as a malesynonym for witch. The root word ‘wise’ implies knowledge, and theterm was used primarily for learned practitioners of the magical arts(ibid.), not for practitioners of ‘diabolical sorcery’. In the Daemonologie,in Forme of a Dialogue, a work claimed by King James I and VI, the char-acters discuss the difference between magiciansand necromancersonthe one hand, and sorcerersand witcheson the other. The former arelearned men who, by virtue of a pact with the Devil,seemto be able tocommand him to perform certain acts or services for them, though infact this is merely a ploy of his to gain possession of their soul; the latterare simple folk who are but the servants or slaves of the Devil.19Theterm ‘warlock’ is used commonly now to denote a male sorcerer, but thisusage implies that there is some distinction between witches and war-locks. The Old English root of the word ‘witch’ has two forms: wicca,for a male witch, and wiccefor a female. ‘Warlock’ is rooted in a differ-ent semantic field: ‘oathbreaker, traitor, or devil’.20Modern English haslost the explicitly gendered forms of ‘witch’, and attributes the femininegender to the word implicitly. The modern use of two different wordsfor male and female witches is problematic because it encourages the[ 8 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONexclusion of men from discussions about pre-modern witches and byextension, about witch-hunting.In both Latin and French, two very common words for ‘witch’ areused for both men and women, the only distinction being the gender-indicative endings.In Latin,the most common word ismaleficus/malefica; French hassorcier/sorcière. German has Hexe,afeminine noun now conventionally used to refer to female witches; earlymodern German used a number of variants for male witches (asopposed to learned magic users), such as Unhold,Drudnerand occa-sionally Hexenmeister. There are many other terms as well, includinggender-specific words such as necromanticus(or nigromanticus) andpythonissa, which were specialised terms for certain kinds of magic-users.21In general, however, early modern authors employed rathergeneric words when they talked about magic-users, words that did notdistinguish between male and female witches as witches.22The closest English equivalent to this kind of non-distinguishinglanguage is ‘sorcerer/sorceress’. In the interests of strict correspondencewith early modern style, we considered using these terms instead of‘male witch’ and ‘female witch’. We decided against it, however, becauseit could lead to some confusion when discussing other scholars’ work.In addition, it would mean backing off from an engagement with the var-ious interpretations of ‘the witch’ when the point of the exercise is toopen up debate on precisely that issue. We use ‘witch’ for both men andwomen, with the gender specified as necessary for clarification. Despitethe problems of modern English usage, this is consistent with earlymodern categories and usage.The second problem with the word ‘witch’ is more complex. Towhom does the label apply? Given that for most people today, or at leastmost potential readers of this book, early modern witchcraft was not‘real’, what does it mean to refer to a historical subject as a witch, with-out quotation marks around the word? The question leads directly intoa thorny tangle of issues, including realism, referentiality, agency, andsubjectivity. There is not enough space here to do full justice to each of[ 9 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEthese topics; nevertheless, it is important to address them and establishour positions explicitly.In the first chapter of his book Thinking With Demons: The Idea ofWitchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Stuart Clark tackles the problemsof realism and referentiality head-on. He states that the witchcraft beliefsof the past have been assumed by modern scholars to be utterly wrongabout the possibility of supernatural events occurring because scholarsare generally committed to a realist epistemology, even if they do notacknowledge it. This model views language as a simple and unprob-lematic reflection of an outside reality and judges utterances to be trueor false as measured by the accuracy of their description of objectivethings. Ideas about witches, for example the idea that witches flew toSabbaths, do not, generally speaking, correspond with ‘the real activi-ties of real people’; in Clark’s terms, they lack referents in the real world.According to Clark, this lack of reference to an empirical reality has ledscholars to dismiss early modern ideas about witchcraft as irrational, orto explain them away as the secondary consequences of some genuinelyreal and determining condition: that is to say, some set of circumstances(social, political, economic, biological, psychic, or whatever) that wasobjectively real in itself but gave rise to objectively false beliefs. Clarkobjects to these two approaches on the grounds that they make it impos-sible to interpret witchcraft beliefs as beliefs in terms of either their par-ticular meaning or their ability to produce concrete actions.23What is needed, he argues, is a more useful (Saussurean) approach,according to which language is not constituted by reality, but rather itselfconstitutes reality. This understanding of language suggests that successin communicating meanings depends upon relationships within thelanguage system, not on relationships between the system and thingsexternal to it. Were one to subscribe to this view of language, one’s focusof enquiry would shift away from putative external determinants of ideasabout witchcraft to the meanings of those ideas within their specificframeworks. This does not mean that the historian would have to acceptpre-modern ideas about witchcraft; rather, the whole issue of the truth[ 10 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 10"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONor falsity of those ideas would become irrelevant. As Clark puts it,‘Witchcraft’s apparent lack of reality as an objective fact would simplybecome a non-issue, and the consequent need to reduce witchcraftbeliefs to some more real aspect of experience would go away’, thus free-ing historians to concentrate their interpretative endeavours on the waysin which the ideas made sense to those who held them.24Clark’s approach to ideas about witchcraft and language providessome of the major underpinnings of this book. Our interest in malewitches is precisely in elucidating how they fit into an ostensibly misog-ynistic framework, or, to put it another way, into an early modern web ofideas about witches, men, and women. Behind this interest lies theassumption, which we share with Clark, that ideas that survived fornearly three centuries ‘must have made some kind of sense’.25Witchcraft ‘beliefs’ do not have to be true in terms of our epistemology(our ‘web of beliefs’) in order to have seemed rational and coherent toearly modern Europeans.26In regard to the labelling of early modern men and women aswitches, a non-realist methodology allows one to bypass the process ofdeciding whether or not each individual is ‘really’ a witch, since there isno way of determining this outside their frame of reference. For the pur-poses of this enquiry into the early modern web of ideas about witches,if a person was understood as a witch in the past, then he or she was oneand will be referred to as such.This leads us to problems of subjectivity and agency. By adopting,without qualification or quotation marks, the label witch, we leave our-selves open to the charge that we are replicating injustices perpetratedagainst those accused of witchcraft. For some modern authors, thoseaccused and executed were victims, and should be discussed as such.These authors tend also to identify with the (female) ‘victims’. AnneBarstow, for instance, who employs the rhetoric of victimhood to greateffect, dedicates her book Witchcrazeto ‘those who did not survive’.27One could argue that it is legitimate to refer to early modern witches asvictims if one is interested primarily in the perspective and experiences[ 11 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 11"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEof the accused. On the other hand, there are several problems with thisapproach.First, the identification of modern feminist scholars with earlymodern witches seems, as Diane Purkiss has suggested, impertinent.Barstow’s dedication assumes a commonality of experience with thewitches, an assumption concerning which Diane Purkiss’ remarks areparticularly apt: ‘In the face of a degree of fear and suffering which mostof us cannot even imagine, a more humble and less eager identificationmight be advisable.’28More importantly, however, the use of victimisation rhetoric intro-duces methodological problems. Referring to witches as victimsimposes a single perspective on a multitude of actors. There is no wayto employ the rhetoric of victimisation in a sweeping fashion and at thesame time offer meaningful and nuanced interpretations of those whoaccused, tried, tortured, executed,or just wrote about witches: theframes of reference are incompatible. Indeed, it is doubtful that callingwitches victims is always consistent with the perspective of the witchesthemselves. Diane Purkiss, Lyndal Roper, and Malcolm Gaskill haveproduced studies that suggest witches possessed agency and, in somecases, represented themselves as witches deliberately.29Nevertheless, it is true that our adoption of witch-hunters’ andwitchcraft theorists’ categories and views of witches objectifies to somedegree the individuals caught on the receiving end of witch trials. Thisis regrettable, even distasteful, given the ordeals many of the witches suf-fered; however, it is unavoidable in a study devoted primarily to theideas of those who thought witches were real and dangerous. There isvery little room for manoeuvre on this point; either one respects histor-ical actors’ categories or one does not.The existence of male witches,and particularly their presence indemonological treatises, raises many questions. Can the male witch be assimilated into discussions framed by ideas about patriarchaloppression? Is the male witch a figure of the earlier witch-hunting phaseonly? Were male and female witches believed to be fundamentally [ 12 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 12"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONdifferent? Were male witches somehow gendered ‘female’ by witchcrafttheorists? How can gender theory help us make sense of the conceptualrelationship between male and female witches?We submit that the male witch was not, conceptually speaking, dif-ferent from the female witch. Early modern writers refer to male witchesthroughout the witch-hunting period, not just at the beginning. Themale witch was not feminised in the ways one might expect; that is, themale witch was not assumed to be, or normally described as, homosex-ual or effeminate. He was, however, connected with female witches, andfemaleness, via the medieval and early modern sense that it was prima-rily the weak-minded (especially women) who could be duped by theDevil into becoming his servants. The male witch suggests that biolog-ical sex was not, at the conceptual level, the primary characteristic of thewitch; gender was. The primary affinity between male and female indi-viduals with witchcraft was related to their status as (womanly) ‘fools’.Women were by pre-modern lights more prone to weak-mindedness,but men were by no means immune; and, like women, foolish men rep-resented threats to the (patriarchal) social order. Male and femalewitches thus have more in common than the majority of participants inthe witchcraft and gender debate suggest.The reality of witchesThe question ‘Were there reallywitches?’ might seem the most obviousand natural one to pose after encountering the grim evidence of late-medieval and early modern witch trials. Yet for the majority of earlymodern Europeans, there could be no serious doubt about the existenceof witches, especially for those involved in laying the theoretical andlegal groundwork for the prosecutions, for those who accused people ofwitchcraft, for those who did the torturing and executing, and probablyalso for those accused of witchcraft. For almost all of them, the existenceof witches and of evil magic was a foregone conclusion, as self-evidentas the earth’s orbit around the sun is to us. They had every reason to[ 13 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 13"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE‘believe’, indeed to knowthat witches existed. Ideas about witches hadbeen authoritative long before the witch trials of the fifteenth to the eigh-teenth centuries and continued to exist in Europe and Britain for someconsiderable time after the witchcraft laws had been repealed.30Ye tscholars have dismissed ‘belief ’ as a universal, a constant that explainsnothing31and gone looking for social, economic, even biological andmeteorological causes for ‘witch crazes’, to the point that a widespread,consistent and authoritative discourse about diabolical witchcraft ismade to seem less important than the individual, quite disparate andoften seemingly random triggers that sometimes unleashed a major per-secution, and that sometimes had no effect at all.The question whether or not witches reallyexisted is a moderninvention. It has little or nothing to do with ‘actors’ categories’, thethought-worlds and views of late-medieval and early modernEuropeans, Britons and Americans.32We have asked the question for afew hundred years now, ever since the witch trials ended in the eigh-teenth century. Scholars first answered ‘No’, in the rational spirit of theEuropean ‘Enlightenment’, then ‘Yes’, in the spirit of Romantic andmedievalist folklore. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, theseopposing positions have defined the debate: those to whom even theidea of a witch or witchcraft is dangerous, superstitious nonsense; andthose who believe that there is ‘more in heaven and earth’ than reasonand empirical observation can ever discover, and who think that therereally were people who knew themselves to be witches and who knewthat they practised witchcraft. Some, such as Margaret Murray, havegone so far as to suggest that witches were members of a secret andancient ‘pagan’ religion that was practised uninterruptedly all throughthe Middle Ages.33In a search for origins and legitimacy characteristicof new societies and new social and religious groups, early proponentsof the modern witch-religion Wicca founded their belief system on theidea that witchcraft is an ancient religion that was suppressed for a longtime, but never extinguished; though there is very little evidence, if any,for this idea.34[ 14 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 14"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONHowever, there is rarely a simple answer to so simple a question, asthe newspaper editor was forced to admit when he answered ‘Yes,Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.’ Both witches and Santa Claus exist(ed)not because there really were or are people who ride around on broom-sticks or in magical sleighs, but because some people think/thoughtthese things to be true. Ideas can be more important than ‘reality’ – even(perhaps especially) if we concede that there is such a thing as realityoutside what we perceive. It is unsettling to contemporary world views,formed by trust in science, empirical methods and experimentation, tobe confronted by what seems to be nothing but ‘belief ’, but which wasfirmly proven knowledge centuries ago.Perhaps more unsettling is that there probably is a certain amount ofhistorical ‘hard fact’ behind both stories. The North American SantaClaus35is a version of the traditional Christian figure St Nicholas (feastday: 6 December), a bishop born around 280 CE in Asia Minor who issaid to have been especially generous: whence the tradition of givingpresents at Christmas-time. Carlo Ginzburg has argued that Europeanideas about witchcraft are based on actual remnants of folk or ‘pagan’ reli-gion,36and most historians will agree that folkloric medicine, herbalcures and traditional knowledge about the natural world helped shapewhat came to be dangerous ideas about diabolical witchcraft. There is (orought to be) a large distance between recognising historical roots, or thenuggets of truth behind a legend, and thinking that the legend itself istrue. If we assume that a lack of evidence is simply the result of oppres-sion or suppression, then we must also believe in Atlantis, the extra-ter-restrial origin of the pyramids, or the existence of werewolves andvampires. There are better and simpler explanations for all these notionsand any underlying phenomena than their literal existence.Historians not only study the past; we also make it. Much of what wethink about witches comes from the above-mentioned traditions ofEnlightenment and Romantic scholarship. To both camps, the witchprovided a useful test case, a means to prove a broader set of ideas andvalues using an unquestionably important phase in the common western[ 15 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 15"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEpast. If pre-Enlightenment Europeans were so fatally wrong about theexistence of witches, then the rest of their world view must also be sus-pected of the worst inconsistencies, irrationalities and errors. The proj-ect of ‘enlightenment’ was to prove just that, to depict an irrational ancienrégimeso decayed, so perverse and dangerous, especially to the power-less and the marginal, that only a new and rational world view couldreplace it. The Romantic reaction was to insist on the value of tradition,of mystical and spiritual perception and experience, especially that of thecommon people, putatively unspoiled by industrialisation and urbanisa-tion; and to rescue the non-material, the numinous, from the scepticalgaze of the deists and atheists. Tenacious herbal lore or even pagan sur-vivals were in the Romantic age not part of a decayed and intellectuallybankrupt old world, but precious evidence of the value and richness offolk tradition.Therefore, a historian’s intellectual and ideological backgroundand constitution play a strong role in determining how he or she will seeboth ideas about witches and the witch trials themselves. As DianePurkiss has argued, the academic ‘discourse’ of historians studyingwitchcraft, especially in England, is essentially a male product, mainlyabout women, of scholars uneasy with self-consciously theoreticalapproaches of the sort that might illuminate gender, ideology or ‘belief ’,who describe themselves as ‘sceptical empiricists’37and act accordinglywhen confronted with other people’s thought-worlds and mentalities:‘Rather than trying to understand how witch-beliefs were structured forand by the believer, historians have often bent their energies towardsexplaining witch-beliefs away.’38The underlying reason for this, according to Purkiss, is that‘History’ is essentially an Enlightenment discourse, one of those that‘gradually displace[d] the supernatural in the seventeenth century’39and thus was programmed from the start to stake out claims to truth onterritory previously occupied by interpreters and practitioners of thesupernatural. While many contemporary historians have engaged withthe post-structuralist and postmodern challenges to ‘enlightenment[ 16 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 16"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONtruth-claims’, Purkiss points out that most scholars of English witchcrafthave not, and the result, until quite recently, has been stagnation and con-ceptual constipation.40No new insights into witchcraft can be gained solong as it is part of a hegemonic male academic discourse that brushes offthe rather different ideas and subjectivities of people who lived a longtime ago under often cruel conditions.Carlo Ginzburg has also attacked the English tradition of witchcraftstudies, focusing on the naive empiricism and terminology of KeithThomas and Alan Macfarlane, among others, whose approach to ‘belief ’was influenced by anthropological functionalism and thus uninterestedin its symbolic dimension.41Ginzburg’s critique of Macfarlane is harsh: Macfarlane examined the age and sex of those accused of witch-craft, the motives for the accusation, their relationships with neigh-bours and the community in general: but he did not dwell on whatthose men and women believed or claimed to believe. Contact withanthropology did not lead to an intrinsic analysis of the beliefs ofthe victims of persecution.42In this book we assume that there were some people, in some times andplaces, who thought 1) that they were witches; and 2) that they practised(for good or for ill) magical arts. This has been demonstrated by CarloGinzburg, among others. However, we insist that the majority of thoseaccused, tortured and even burned as witches did not think of themselvesas such, at least not before their interrogation. They were ‘made’, as deBlécourt puts it, but not only by (gendered) village dynamics. That manywere willing to confess to participating in the witches’ Sabbath or to prac-tising ‘black arts’ reflects not only the efficacy of the means of persuasion(physical and cultural), but also the predominance and widespreadacceptance of ideas about witches in their environment – rather than realevents, as Murray claimed. Most will have shared the idea, dominant intheir societies, that witches existed, that they used magic to cause harmto people and animals, and even that they served and worshipped Satan;but they did not think, in most cases, that they themselves did so or had[ 17 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 17"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEdone so in the past, until persuaded into saying it and perhaps evenbelieving it under extreme duress.So the question as to the existenceof witches and ideasabout witch-craft is hard to separate,then as now. Most contemporary scholars donot think that those accused of witchcraft were in fact witches (or thatthey even understood themselves to be witches), and most also allowtheir readers to see that they themselves either do not ‘believe’ in theexistence of witches and witchcraft, or consider the question irrelevant.Certain modern scholars of the witch-hunts and of witchcraft, forinstance Montague Summers and Margaret Murray, have themselvesthought that witches existed but held diametrically opposed views con-cerning the nature of witchcraft: to Murray, it was a pre-Christian fertil-ity religion; to Summers, a satanic cult that was the root of feminism. Butthe question is neither irrelevant nor clear; it is ‘badly posed’.We refuse to allow ourselves to be drawn into ideological debatesbetween representatives of Enlightenment and Romantic ideas about theexistence of witches, no matter how important they are to adherents ofWicca and similar new religions, or to agendas concerning the oppres-sion of counter-hegemonic traditions and structures. To engage in suchdebates is to lose sight of the historical data and ‘reality’, so far as we candiscern it, of witch-hunting and ideas about witches. Without such ideas,there would have been no pyres or gallows. But ideas alone are insuffi-cient to explain the events of the period roughly 1450-1750, duringwhich thousands of women, men and children were tortured and exe-cuted. Had ideas been enough, the fires would have been lit hundreds ofyears earlier and continued burning for many decades more.Although our questions may have no general validity or answer, theyare nonetheless relevant in a certain form to any study of historical events,their preconditions and their causes. Medieval and early modern west-erners knew that witches and the magical arts were real; and there seemsto have been a small number of people who thought either that they werewitches or that they practised magic, or both. Very careful distinctionsare required if we are to avoid grotesque and useless generalisations.[ 18 ]introduction 21/12/04 8:47 am Page 18"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONWe offer this book not primarily as a set of original studies designedto bring to light ‘new cases’, nor even as a test bed to try old and estab-lished ideas by the light of new evidence.

There is no shortage of interpretations: the last thirty yearshave seen the historical study of witchcraft transformed ‘from an eso-teric byway into a regular concern of social, religious and intellectualhistorians’ who have carried out intensive, often interdisciplinaryresearch in the archives of continental Europe, the British Isles, and theNew World.2This mass of research has produced a variety of explanations forthe so-called witch craze, including, but not limited to: the acculturationof the masses by the elite;3state-building;4and mass psychosis.5One ofthe most contentious sets of interpretations concerns the relationshipbetween witch-hunting and gender. Of the thousands of people triedand executed for the crime of witchcraft, 75 to 80 per cent were women.This distinctive feature of early modern witch-hunting aroused littlescholarly comment until witchcraft studies entered their ‘golden age’during the last quarter of the twentieth century; over time, however, thepreponderance of women in this grim count has generated a complex,politicised debate over its significance.Much valuable work illuminates the role of early modern notions ofgender in witchcraft prosecutions. Unfortunately, the debate has tendedchapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 25"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEto polarise those scholars, mostly feminists, who argue that patriarchyand misogyny were primary causes of witch-hunting, and those scholarswho resist feminist theories and interpretations.6The female witch hasbecome a site for struggles over historical method and feminist politics,but there is very little room in the research agenda for the male witch, eventhough men comprised 20 to 25 per cent of the total number of executedwitches. What work there is on male witches tends to be limited, for themost part, to enumeration. Rigorous application of gender analysis to themale witch has so far been absent from the historiography.7The exclusion of male witches from witchcraft historiography isthe result of active processes and assumptions. With few exceptions,modern scholars see the witch as essentially female, and are not pre-pared to recognise male witches as valid historical subjects of the sameimportance as female witches. It is not that they are unaware of the exis-tence of male witches. Most serious studies, including current surveys,mention male witches; however, the male witch vanishes quickly fromview, as he is made invisible by a combination of rhetorical strategies.This exclusion, which inverts the elision of women from traditional his-tory, is not restricted to feminist scholarship. Male scholars participatein the exclusion also – even when they present research that is specifi-cally about male witches.The debate itself is embedded within a strongly gendered dis-course. For instance, it has become practically de rigueurto begin a ‘seri-ous’ discussion of gender and witchcraft by skewering the most extremeexamples of feminist interpretation one can find. The usual suspects areMargaret Murray, Andrea Dworkin, Mary Daly, Barbara Ehrenreich andDeirdre English.8Diane Purkiss describes this process as a ‘ritualslaughter’ or rite of distantiation designed to keep the academic’s mas-culine rationality at a safe distance from feminine irrationality andcredulity.9The kind of language that is often used supports her critique:for example, it is surely no accident that Robin Briggs refers in a con-ceptually insular fashion to ‘the wilder shores of the feminist and witch-cult movements’.10His description characterises feminists and modern[ 26 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 26"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"[ 27 ]THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHpagans as irrational and uncivilised Others with whom Briggs does notwish to be identified.

Claims to occupy a middle ground oftenrevolve around a false doxon, the purpose of which is to create an illu-sion of cautious moderation.For their part, feminist scholars are eager to point out male aca-demics’ insensitivity to women and to gender issues. H.R. Trevor-Roper, Erik Midelfort, Alan Macfarlane and Keith Thomas have all beencriticised for their interpretations of women as witches and witch-hunt-ing, which implied at certain points that women were at fault. Trevor-Roper, for instance, wrote in a striking passage that The Devil with his nightly visits, his succubiand incubi, hissolemn pact which promised new power to gratify social and per-sonal revenge, became ‘subjective reality’ to hysterical women ina harsh rural world or in artificial communities – in ill-regulatednunneries ... or in special regions like the Pays de Labourd,where ... the fishermen’s wives were left deserted for months.And because separate persons attached their illusions to the sameimaginary pattern, they made that pattern real to others.11Here we have irrational women, improperly controlled by men, as thecause of the witch-hunts.12This is Trevor-Roper’s most detailed com-ment on the issue of women as witches. Erik Midelfort, writing aboutsouth-western Germany, devoted several pages to a discussion of why‘witch panics almost always singled out adult women for special atten-tion.’ He focused on demographic explanations, but remarked that‘women seemed somehow to provoke an intense misogyny at times’and that scapegoated groups attract to themselves the scapegoatingmechanism.13Alan Macfarlane and Keith Thomas, historians of witchcraft inEngland, also suggested that it was women’s behaviour that causedchapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 27"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEsuspicion to fall on them; however, they are criticised more often byfeminists for denying a role for male–female conflict in witch-hunting.Thomas, for instance, stated that ‘the idea that witch-prosecutionsreflected a war between the sexes must be discounted, not least becausethe victims and witnesses were themselves as likely to be women asmen’.14Anne Barstow’s views on these historians indicate the potential forpolarisation between feminist and non-feminist accounts: Historians were denying that misogyny and patriarchy are validhistorical categories and were refusing to treat women as a recog-nizable historical group. Reading these works is like readingaccounts of the Nazi holocaust in which everyone would agree thatthe majority of victims were Jewish, but no one would mentionanti-Semitism or the history of violent persecution against Jews,thereby implying that it was ‘natural’ for Jews to be victims.Without mention of a tradition of oppression of women, the impli-cation for the sixteenth century is that of course women would beattacked – and that it must somehow have been their fault.15Although Trevor-Roper, Midelfort, Macfarlane and Thomas were sym-pathetic generally toward early modern witches, Barstow casts thesescholars in the role of Holocaust deniers and, by implication, Nazi sym-pathisers. She is correct to point out these historians’ tendency to findfault with women’s behaviour; however, her characterisation, likeBriggs’ description of feminists, asserts the apostolic authority of herown approach and, it could be argued, suggests that the non-feministhistorians are irrational.16Given the struggle for control over discourse about the femalewitch, one would expect to see something similar in connection with themale witch, but this is not the case. Male witches serve a useful functionas spoilers of the more simplistic ‘witch-hunting as woman-hunting’interpretations, but otherwise no one says much about them. Most ofwhat is written about male witches stems directly from the conclusions[ 28 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 28"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHdrawn by Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort and William Monter in theirearly studies of Essex, southwestern Germany and the French-Swissborder region.17These conclusions may be summarised as follows: afew men were accused of witchcraft, but they were usually related to afemale suspect (Macfarlane); men were accused of witchcraft, some-times in large numbers, but this happened only when a witch-hunt spi-ralled into a mass panic and the normal stereotype of the female witchbroke down (Midelfort); men were accused of witchcraft, sometimes inlarge numbers, but this was because they lived in areas that conceptu-alised witchcraft as heresy (Monter).Feminist and other scholars alike have quietly, sometimes silently,incorporated Macfarlane’s, Midelfort’s and Monter’s brief remarks intotheir own interpretations of witchcraft and gender. This commonality ispossible because of a tacit agreement that male witches are neither asinteresting nor as important as female witches and, furthermore, that theyare not ‘proper’ witches. At the extreme, this attitude toward malewitches is manifested in their simple erasure from analyses of witchcraft.An essay by the medievalist Kathleen Biddick illustrates this era-sure. In her discussion of Carlo Ginzburg’s book Ecstasies: Decipheringthe Witches’ Sabbath, she summarises his argument as follows: For him, Inquisitorial persecution and popular notions of con-spiracy are serial phenomena running in a kind of zigzag way fromlepers to Jews to womenover the fourteenth century. ... In his studyof the witches’ Sabbath, Ginzburg divided the possibilities forcontinuity and discontinuity among Jews and womenin interest-ing ways. Jews seem to ‘disappear’ from the European imaginary,and womenalmost magically take their place [italics added].18This would not be an inaccurate synopsis, except that Biddick hassubstituted ‘women’ for ‘witches’. Ginzburg, unusually for witchcrafthistorians, always refers to both male and female witches. His schemefor the shifting targets of persecuting impulses is not ‘lepers to Jewsto women’, but ‘lepers–Jews; Jews; Jews–witches.’19[ 29 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 29"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEIt is difficult to imagine how Biddick could have missed Ginzburg’spoint that witches were, and were understood to be, both male andfemale. The very first words of the book are: ‘Male and female witches metat night’.20In the chapter Biddick cites, Ginzburg says at one point thatLike the lepers and Jews,male and female witchesare located atthe margins of the community; their conspiracy is once againinspired by an external enemy – the enemy par excellence, theDevil. Inquisitors and lay judges will search for physical proof ofthe pact sealed with the Devil on the bodies of the male and femalewitches: the stigma that lepers and Jews carried sewn onto theirclothing [italics added].21Finally, on the very page that Biddick cites from that chapter, Ginzburgremarks that ‘For almost a century trials had been held against the sect ofanthropophagous male and female witches’.22Biddick either wilfully orunconsciously eliminated the male witches, who are out in plain sight inGinzburg’s text. If she did this wilfully, distorting Ginzburg’s argumentalong the way, it suggests a remarkable degree of arrogance; if her erasure ofmale witches was unconscious, it indicates that her feminist optics containa blind spot. Either way, Biddick’s inability to respect Ginzburg’s sense ofthe term ‘witch’demonstrates the power of the paradigm of the female witchand the discomfort that scholars feel when confronted with male witches.More commonly, especially in surveys, male witches are mentionedonce or twice and then forgotten, and witches are referred to subse-quently as if they were exclusively female. Keith Thomas, for example,draws his readers’ attention to the fact that some witches were men, butthen switches to the feminine pronoun: ‘A witch was a person of eithersex (but more often female) who could mysteriously injure other people.The damage she might do ... could take various forms.’23Anne Barstowpresents a particularly objectionable version of this elision. Afterexplaining that ‘[i]t is through an analysis of the percentage of womenand men accused and of the percentage condemned that the gender biasof this persecution emerges’,24she goes on to say: [ 30 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 30"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHGiven the chaotic state of the records, the temptation to roundoff the numbers is strong. Yet I found myself carefully retainingeach awkward figure, even though this added hours of work foreach region I studied.

Wanting to record every knownvictim, to ensure that the historical record finally acknowledgesherdeath, I offer the most complete record available at this time[italics added].25Barstow envisions the dead witches as females only, even though she is well aware that thousands of men were also accused of and executedfor the crime of witchcraft. According to her own standards, Barstow iskilling some witches twice by speaking as if all witches were women.One could defend Barstow’s indifference toward male witches onthe grounds that she is performing the important task of writingwomen’s history. There is nothing wrong with focusing on women;however, there is something disturbing, on several levels, about an actof historiographical revenge that replicates, by inversion, the past neg-lect of women as historical subjects. To put the elision of male witchesin perspective, one has only to read the words of Johannes Junius, whowas executed as a witch in 1628. In a letter smuggled from prison,Junius wrote to his daughter:Innocent I came to jail, innocent I was tortured, innocent I mustdie ... the executioner [came], and put the thumbscrews on me,both hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nailsand everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands...

Then I thought heaven andearth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and letme fall again, so that I suffered horrible agony.26Junius’s letter illustrates graphically that both male and female witchescould experience the same terrors, yet scholars such as Barstow seem to[ 31 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 31"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEprivilege the suffering of women over that of men. In doing so, they arecommitting an injustice against certain historical subjects – humanbeings – solely on the basis of their (male) sex.As troubling as open exclusions are, they are less problematic thanthe strategies that ‘declassify’ male witches. Men are discussed in termsthat suggest they were essentially different, as witches, from women –and therefore not really witches at all. Sometimes this approach is blunt,as in Barstow’s assertion: The fact that overall about 20 percent of the accused were male isless an indication that men were associated with witchcraft than itappears. Most of these men were related to women already con-victed of sorcery ... and thus were not perceived as originatorsofwitchcraft. Of the few who were not related, most had criminalrecords for other felonies ... witchcraft was not the original chargebut was added on to make the initial accusation more heinous[original italics].27In her survey of early modern European women and gender, MerryWiesner presents a variation of this argument, stating that ‘male sus-pects were generally relatives of the accused women’ and ‘[t]he menaccused in mass panics were generally charged with different types ofwitchcraft than the women – of harming things in the male domain suchas horses or crops rather than killing infants or spoiling bread – and onlyrarely accused of actions such as night-flying or pacts with the Devil.’28Although Barstow and Wiesner do discuss male witches in generalterms, the effect of their description is to eliminate male witches as validhistorical subjects by casting them as either mere collateral damage inthe persecution of women, or as something completely different fromfemale witches and therefore uninteresting.William Monter performs a more subtle redirection in his study ofmale witches in Normandy. This important article is one of the mostthorough discussions of male witches, and does much to challenge thenotion that early modern witch beliefs and witch-hunting were directed[ 32 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 32"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHuniformly against women. Monter provides a wealth of data about malewitches, beginning with the fact that in this ‘unremarkable province’close to ‘the heart of northern and western Europe’, men comprised themajority of those tried and executed for witchcraft.29What is more, theproportion of male witches actually rose over time.30Finally, Monter’sresearch indicates that certain occupational groups – shepherds,blacksmiths and clerics – were particularly vulnerable to witchcraftaccusations.31Monter’s study of Normandy is exciting because it offers concreteevidence that early modern beliefs about witches were not necessarilysex-specific. For example, both men and women were searched forDevil’s marks, with men ‘as likely as women to display such anaes-thetic spots.’ However, Monter suggests that ‘it was difficult to accom-modate beliefs about the orgies at the witches’ sabbath to apredominantly male population of witches’.32Monter does not citeany statements by the Rouen judges regarding the putative difficultyof accommodating beliefs about the Sabbath with male witches, andappears to be making a large assumption based on a relative lack ofquestions about the Sabbath, despite the fact that both men andwomen confessed to attending it.33According to Monter, the lack ofjudicial interest in the Sabbath was a means of ‘finessing’ the problemof men attending these witches’ gatherings;34however, it is also pos-sible that this indicates merely a broader disinterest in this element ofwitchcraft. Monter’s assumption that the judges in Rouen were con-fused by the existence of male witches, even though they were con-fronted by them in relatively large numbers, suggests that it is Monter,the modern historian, who has difficulty accommodating male witcheswithin the paradigm of early modern diabolic witchcraft.In the end, Monter reclassifies the male witches as heretics, thusharking back to his 1976 conclusions about regions with large propor-tions of male witches. The Normandy witches, especially the shep-herds, were in the habit of using Eucharists to perform magic. Monterargues that ‘the judges of Rouen inflicted such severe punishments on[ 33 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 33"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEthose shepherds ... not because they were magicians, but because theyprofaned the eucharist, the body of Christ.’35This particular statementconcerns the reason for the unusual severity of the Rouen Parlementtoward male witches, not the reason for their existence in the first place;however, shortly before he makes this comment, Monter wonders ‘whyNormandy put mainly male witches on trial’, then launches directly intohis discussion of profaning the Eucharist.36There is some other useful research on male witches, although ittends to be embedded in works focusing on other issues. For example,Eva Labouvie begins her article on men’s roles in witch trials with a briefsurvey of the witchcraft literature, and takes exception to the ‘unre-strained feminist nature of the arguments in witchcraft scholarship of the1970s, which was interested only in the role of women as victims inwitchcraft trials.’37She concentrates on the differences between the sortsof magic men and women were thought to do, thought each other did,and were accused of; the cases are from the Saarland. She also mentionsthe many regions of what is now Austria and Switzerland where men werethe majority of the accused and lists a number of important works forthese regions.38Labouvie notes that men were accused of certain kindsof witchcraft, mainly rooted in ‘agricultural everyday reality’ and maleareas of responsibility (health and care of children and animals).Whereaswomen were accused of poisoning and ‘malevolent nurture’, men whoused magic aimed to procure opposite effects (Segnerei: ‘blessing’; ill-ness-curing magic, harvest, field and weather magic; professional healingmagic) may have been less likely to be suspected of diabolical witchcraft.She ends with the idea that ‘the witchcraft trials that took place involvingmale village dwellers [in the Saarland] seem to have served in the main toregulate village power relations and conflict within the male sphere oftasks and duties, mainly within male areas of responsibility and activity’.Men were much more likely to accuse women of maleficiumand of dia-bolical magic, even more than women were. Women accused men of dia-bolical magic, but men did not accuse other men of this; they tended toaccuse men of the more traditional forms of male magic.39Labouvie’s[ 34 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 34"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHstudy suggests some intriguing avenues of investigation, especially withrespect to the intersection of witchcraft accusations with gender roles;however, the overall point of the article has to do more with male partici-pation in witch trials as accusers than with male witches.Robin Briggs and Willem de Blécourt both have published studiesthat include and comment on male witches. However, Briggs concen-trates on refuting the theory that witch-hunting was woman-hunting, andhas little to say about male witches as witches; in his book chapter ‘Menagainst women: the gendering of witchcraft’, he focuses on femalewitches and accusers, and male witches play a minor role.40In his impor-tant article ‘The making of the female witch: Reflections on witchcraftand gender in the early modern period’, de Blécourt has interestingthings to say about male witches in the Netherlands, including the ideathat there existed both male and female witch stereotypes.41He raises thequestion of why ‘the making of the male witch is as neglected as his femalecounterpart’, but is, in this particular study, concerned primarily with thefemale witch. Despite his knowledge that ‘in some areas men were also atrisk to be socially constructed as witches’, de Blécourt dismisses malewitches by stating that ‘their witchcraft was usually of a different, lessmalevolent kind and hardly susceptible to prosecution.’42Stuart Clark’s interpretation of demonological views of gender andwitchcraft offers the most striking instance of the invisibility of malewitches. Demonological literature is a major source for the assumptionthat witch-hunting was primarily about persecuting women. Someresearchers blame witchcraft treatises, particularly the infamousMalleus maleficarumof 1487, for the gender bias of witch-hunts thattargeted women more often than men. Gerhild Scholz Williams, forexample, has written: ‘Kramer’s Malleus Maleficarumgave the startingsignal to a discourse on witchcraft and women that gathered momen-tum in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries and realized its fulldestructive potential between the years 1580 and 1630.’43 SigridBrauner took a similar view in her study of the construction of the witch-image in early modern Germany, arguing that the Malleus maleficarum[ 35 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 35"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPErepresented ‘a watershed in the history of the witch hunts’ because itmarked the first time that a work on witchcraft as heresy argued thatmost witches were women.44Implicit in both of these formulations isthe view that the Malleuswas a typical demonological work: funda-mentally misogynist and responsible for the high percentage of femalevictims of witch trials.In his studies of early modern demonology, Stuart Clark questionsboth the woman-hunting argument and the attribution of blame todemonologists. He points out that if witch-hunting was indeed a func-tion of misogyny, then ‘we ought ... to find woman-hating in abundancein those who most actively supported it. The problem is that we donot.’45According to Clark, ‘early modern demonologists showed littleinterest either in exploring the gender basis of witchcraft or in using itto denigrate women.’ They expressed negative attitudes toward women,but these were not unusual for the time and place. This is not to say thatthey were not misogynists – they were – but most witchcraft theoristswere not much concerned with the subject of women as witches.Drawing on a cultural heritage of ideas about women, includingAristotle’s views about women as imperfect men, and the clerical miso-gyny of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the authors of demono-logical treatises took women’s ‘greater propensity to demonism’ forgranted, and ‘felt no need to elaborate on it or indulge in additionalwoman-hating to back it up.’ As Clark argues, the femininity of the witchwas ‘more of a presupposition than a problem’ for witchcraft theorists.46Of course, this does not mean that misogyny had nothing to do withthe association of witchcraft with women. But Clark suggests that this asso-ciation operated at a fundamental conceptual level that went deeper thanthe social or material surface of early modern culture. He argues that a con-ceptual affinity between witchcraft and women made it ‘literally unthink-able ... that witches should be male.’47This affinity derived, he argues,from the binary structure of early modern European thinking, which clas-sified everything according to a dual symbolic system. Within this system,the male/female polarity was a primary, hierarchically weighted form of[ 36 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 36"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE HISTORIAN AND THE MALE WITCHsymbolic differentiation. In a nutshell, men were ‘symbolically associatedwith a range of other positive items and categories, and women with theirnegative counterparts.’ Rationality, for instance, a ‘positive’ trait associatedwith men, had its ‘negative’ counterpart, irrationality – which was associ-ated with women. These polarised associations were not necessarily antag-onistic; they were often complementary. Nevertheless, women were seen,he argues, as fundamentally negative opposites to men in all their physical,intellectual, emotional, and spiritual attributes.48Witches, and witchcraft, were thought of as wholly negative, asinversions of everything good. According to Clark, their negative, inver-sionary ‘position’ within the binary cognitive framework of earlymodern Europe placed them, by definition, on the female side of themale/female polarity. Clark argues: At a demonological level ... witches were female because the rep-resentational system governing them required for its coherence ageneral correlation between such primary oppositions asgood/evil, order/disorder, soul/body, and male/female; they werefemales who, by behaviour inspired by the master of inversion, theDevil, inverted the polarized attributes accorded to the genders inlater medieval and early modern learned culture; and of these sub-versives, they were thought to be the most extreme and the mostdangerous.49Clark’s structuralist thesis works well as an explanation of whywitchcraft was generally linked with women; however, it does notexplain why demonological treatises, like witchcraft accusations,include male witches. If the conceptual correlation between witchesand women was as strong as Clark suggests, then it is very difficult toexplain why early modern writers about witchcraft seemed to have notrouble imagining, discussing, and fearing male witches. Why, if thelink was so clear and logical, were there any male witches at all?50Clark’s assertion that the binary structure made it unthinkable thatwitches should be male simply does not correspond to the frequent[ 37 ]chapter1 21/12/04 8:50 am Page 37"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEreferences to male witches in the demonological treatises, as wedemonstrate in chapter four.Why are historians so reluctant to take male witches seriously intheir analyses of gender and witchcraft? In the case of some feministscholars, the answer is probably relatively simple: they do not considerthe persecution of men to be as important as the oppression of women,and the male witch does not carry the same symbolic power for them asthe female witch does. Furthermore, paying too much attention to malewitches might diminish the role and significance of women in earlymodern witchcraft historiography. For other scholars, the male witchmight represent an unwelcome link between the modern academic andthe irrational. Excluding the male witch from witchcraft historiographybetrays a need to distance the modern (male) academic from a witch-figure that has been constructed over time as a symbol of superstition,femininity and powerlessness. The male witch threatens this image byconfusing the tidy links between femininity and witchcraft; he alsothreatens the self-image of the academic, who needs to represent thewitch as his Other.51Yet others might simply be afraid of addressing theissue in print, given the assiduous polemics conducted in the commer-cial witchabilia industry.We need to overcome this tendency to polarise, and to reconceptu-alise the nature of interlacing gendered oppositions in both modern andearly modern culture. The male witch provides a means of exposing ourassumptions and developing more nuanced understandings of the rela-tionship between masculinity, femininity and witchcraft.Notes1 Brian Levack,The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe, 2nd edn.(London and New York: Longman, 1995), 25.

MALEWITCHES ON TRIAL[ 43 ]As the previous chapter showed, the prevailing view in witchcraft stud-ies is that male witches were rare exceptions to the rule and are lessimportant and interesting, as historical subjects, than female witches.There is a kind of conventional historiographical wisdom about malewitches, which may be summarised as follows: male witches were a)accused in small numbers; b) accused primarily because they wererelated to female witches; c) accused primarily in large witch-hunts, inwhich panic broke down the stereotype of the female witch; d) notaccused of diabolic witchcraft, especially the sexual aspects; e) accusedin larger numbers in areas where witchcraft was treated primarily asheresy rather than as maleficium; f ) accused of different types of witch-craft from that of female witches.These generalisations are rarely questioned, despite the fact thatthey are derived, for the most part, from the early regional studies byMonter, Midelfort, and Macfarlane rather than from comparative analy-ses. Whereas almost everything else, it seems, about witchcraft andwitch-hunting (especially anything to do with women) has been dis-sected under many different microscopes, these hypotheses regardingmale witches, put forward in the 1970s, have been absorbed as com-fortable verities and allowed to stand virtually untested.This chapter examines cases in which men were accused of witch-craft. The examples are drawn from several different regions, in order totest conventional generalisations about male witches.

This figure represents an estimate that covers conti-nental Europe, the British Isles, and the American colonies, over aperiod of roughly three hundred years: it masks the crucial fact thatratios of male to female witches were extremely variable. The followingtable illustrates this variability between regions.Table 1 is an original synthesis of others’ archival research. Similartables can be found in many studies. Ordinarily, they are compiled inorder to marshal statistical support for arguments about witch-hunt-ing’s anti-female bias. Our purpose is different, and we have designedour table accordingly. We have omitted the usual column listing the per-centage of female witches, in favour of one listing the percentage of malewitches. The arrangement of data is also somewhat unusual. Instead ofgrouping statistics by region or chronology, we have sorted themaccording to an ascending numerical order of the percentages of malewitches. We have done this for two reasons: first, to highlight the rangeof percentages; second, and more importantly, to avoid, as far as possi-ble, giving the false impression that the data sets are directly compara-ble. As the second column shows, the chronological periods covered aretoo variable to allow a meaningful comparison of statistical data; in addi-tion, the regions represented in this sample are very different, rangingfrom a city (Venice) to entire countries.

The statistical range from 5 per cent male witches inthe Bishopric of Basel to 92 per cent in Iceland, with other regions ‘fill-ing in’ the gap between those two figures, makes the value of general esti-mates seem highly dubious.

In any case, it is clear that anyattempt to establish representativeness would be problematic. Is theBishopric of Basel really more representative of gendered patterns ofwitch-hunting than Iceland, because it tried so many more women thanmen? Or is Norway truly representative, on the basis of its ‘perfect’number of male witches?G.R. Quaife exemplifies scholars’ difficulty in coming to grips withthe fact of male witches. In his discussion of the gender bias of witchhunts, Quaife explains male witches away as the political opponents ofprosecutors; as cunningmen; or as relatives of female suspects. He actu-ally suggests that in the case of New England, the male witches who wererelated to a female witch ‘should be discounted’ in an assessment ofgender bias because they were merely ‘secondary targets as husbands orassociates of a female witch’. Discounting these men, he argues, raises theproportion of women in the New England trials to almost 90 per cent,which, he says, corresponds neatly with the proportion in England.Quaife extrapolates from this result that ‘the gender bias against womenmay be greater in other jurisdictions than the raw figures indicate’.4In his attempt to ‘improve’ the proportions of accused women,Quaife fails to consider that a statistical criterion ought to be applied toan entire set of data, not to a pre-selected group only. If, as he suggests,‘secondary’ targets of witchcraft accusations ought to be discounted,then the total number of witches must drop sharply. It was unusual formore than a small number of individuals to be accused as primary tar-gets; the ordinary pattern for witch-hunts, including the New Englandtrials, was for primary targets to accuse directly or implicate indirectlyseveral secondary targets, including both male and female relatives andassociates. Discounting all secondary targets would alter the statisticalpicture significantly. Quaife, however, avoids this result by constructing[ 46 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 46"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALa double standard, which presupposes, by implication, that earlymodern Europeans did not ‘mean it’ when they accused men of beingwitches but were serious when they accused women. That Quaife is ableto suggest this without providing any qualitative evidence of earlymodern beliefs about male witches indicates the power of statistical fig-ures within witchcraft historiography.5The point here is not to deny that, generally speaking, more womenthan men were accused of witchcraft. This is a central, indisputable fea-ture of early modern witch-hunting that cannot be ignored.Nevertheless, it is a feature that is far from uniform, and that lack of uni-formity must be taken into account in analyses of gender and witchcraftin early modern Europe. The ‘big picture’ was not monochromatic,even on the often-polarised field of gender; it needs to be shaded in,nuanced, to reflect its polychromatic character. One means of accom-plishing this goal is to make the men accused of witchcraft visiblethrough specific case studies.John Samond, EssexOur first case study comes from the county of Essex in England. TheCalendar of Assize Records contains the well-known Essex indict-ments, records which Alan Macfarlane plumbed for his path-breaking1970 study Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England. Macfarlane notedthat Essex witches were usually women, and found that of the twenty-three men accused, ‘eleven were either married to an accused witch orappeared in a joint indictment with a woman.’6This fact has been reit-erated by several authors in order to make the male witches ‘invisible’,as we argued in our first chapter. Marianne Hester, for instance, barelymentions male witches in her revisionist analysis of the Essex trials,except to remark that ‘[i]n England more than 90 percent of those for-mally accused of witchcraft were women, and the few men who werealso formally accused tended to be married to an accused witch or toappear jointly with a woman’.7Joseph Klaits also refers to the Essex[ 47 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 47"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEdata, using them to support his assertion that ‘many of the accused menwere implicated solely due to their connection with female suspects.’8These statements, including Macfarlane’s, assume that the womeninvolved in the eleven cases were accused first and were the cause of theaccusations against the men. This is problematic because the indict-ments, which provide the bulk of the evidence for any interpretations ofwitchcraft in Essex, contain little in the way of detailed informationabout individual cases. In some instances, it is possible to work out whowas most likely to have been accused first. For example, in August 1579Richard Presmary and his wife Joan were indicted and convicted at theChelmsford Assizes on the charge of murder by witchcraft. JoanPresmary had been indicted for witchcraft in the previous year, at theBrentwood Assizes of July 1578.9Richard Presmary had no priorindictments. It seems reasonable that in this case Joan Presmary mayhave been accused first, because she would have had a reputation as awitch. This tells us nothing about why Richard Presmary would havebeen accused this time, but it does appear to support the suggestion thatmen were secondary suspects.On the other hand, in many cases there is no way of knowing, fromthe indictments, who was accused first. William and Margery Skelton, acouple from Little Wakering, were indicted and convicted on multiplecounts of murder by witchcraft at the Chelmsford Assizes of March1573. Neither one appears to have had previous indictments. This caseis especially interesting because the four murders are divided up evenlybetween the couple: William bewitched one girl, Margery bewitchedanother, and the couple committed the remaining murders together.There is nothing in the indictment record to indicate which of theSkeltons first fell under suspicion, or who was the ‘lead’ witch.10Similarly, Richard Dune and Agnes Dunne were indicted for witchcrafttogether in July 1589; since neither had ever been indicted previously,there is no way of knowing which one of them was the primary suspect.11It may very well have been that in all of these cases it was the womanwho first ‘attracted’ the charge of witchcraft, and that the men were [ 48 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 48"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALsuspected merely because of their association with them. The case ofJohn Samond, however, suggests that it was equally possible for men tobe suspected independently; furthermore, this case suggests thatwomen may at times have been the secondary suspects.John Samond, also known as Smythe, Smith, or Salmon, firstappears in the Essex indictment records in July 1560, three years beforethe Witchcraft Statute of 1563 was passed.12On this occasion, he wascharged with having bewitched with fatal consequences John Graunteand Bridget Pecocke, who died on 28 May 1560 and 29 August 1560respectively. He was acquitted the following year, at the ChelmsfordAssizes of March 1561.13Samond reappears several times in the EssexAssize records,usually on a charge of witchcraft,until his final indictmentin 1587, at which point he was found guilty and sentenced to behanged.14Samond is an important figure because his frequent appearances inthe indictment records allow us to compare his charges with those of thewomen indicted at the same assizes. His indictments demonstrate that,contrary to some of the generalisations described at the beginning of thischapter, men could be accused of witchcraft independently of theirfemale relatives and were not always accused of practising magic thatwas different from that of women. Indeed, the striking thing about JohnSamond, besides his frequent appearances before the assizes, is thatthere is no clear distinction between him and the female witchesindicted in Essex.In 1560, at the time of his first indictment, Samond was a beer-brewer with a reputation. The indictment states that John Samond of Danbury..., beer-brewer, otherwise called JohnSmythe, is a common enchanter and witch as well of men as beasts... not having God before his eyes, but being moved and seducedby the instigation of the Devil, by the devilish arts of enchantmentand witchcraft, on 28 May, 1 Eliz. and diverse days and places aswell before as afterwards, at Danbury aforesaid, of his maliceaforethought, a certain John (sic) Graunte and Brigit Pecocke did[ 49 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 49"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEbewitch and enchant, by reason of which the said Brigit ... until29 August next following did languish, on which day the saidBrigit ... died. And the said Antony Grant ... from the 28 May inthe year above said until the 28 May next following did languish,on which day the said Antony ... died.15There is no explanation of why or how he bewitched his victims, butthis is normal for indictments, which are very terse documents. What isinteresting here is the identification of Samond as a ‘common enchanterand witch’.16The language used to describe him is the same as that usedto describe a woman, Margery Stanton, at the 1579 Chelmsford Lentsessions. In Latin, the indictment against Samond reads: ‘JohanesSamond ... communis incantator ac fascinator tam hominum quam ani-malium’.17The indictment against Stanton is virtually identical:‘Margeria Stanton ... existens communis incantatrix et fascinatrix tamhominum quam bestiarum et aliarum rerum’.18The two witches are dif-ferentiated only by the use of appropriate masculine and feminine end-ings for the words ‘incantator/ incantatrix’ and ‘fascinator/fascinatrix’.If English people believed that there was an essential distinctionbetween male and female witches (as witches), this is not reflected intheir legal language.19Samond’s next appearance at the assizes, in March 1570, was on acharge of grand larceny. He was accused of stealing sheep from twoother men, found guilty, but allowed benefit of clergy.20At the sameassizes, two women, both from the village of Little Baddow, wereindicted for murder by witchcraft; one was found guilty, the otheracquitted.21In August 1572, John Samond was indicted again for witchcraft.This time, he is listed as a yeoman and beer-brewer, and his wife Joan isindicted with him. This case is important for what it suggests – or, moreprecisely, for what it does not suggest – regarding the relationshipbetween male witches and their wives.We have seen that modern scholars tend to assume a causal rela-tionship in which the man is accused because of his association with a[ 50 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 50"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALfemale witch. Although there is not enough information given in theindictments to say with any certainty what the background to this casewas, it seems unlikely that suspicion of Joan Samond would have led tosuspicion against her husband, instead of the other way around. JohnSamond had a reputation for witchcraft that had landed him in courtbefore, whereas this was his wife’s first indictment. Furthermore, thecharges themselves suggest that suspicion may have fallen on John first.The first charge against John Samond is for bewitching to death twocows belonging to William Treasure. This is the most recent of the threebewitchings listed in the indictment and, significantly, Treasure hadgiven evidence against Samond in the 1570 sheep-stealing case.Treasure may have suspected an act of revenge and accused JohnSamond; the other charges against John and his wife (maiming one manand laming another) may have been brought forward subsequently.22Two other witchcraft cases at this session show that the type ofcharges against John Samond were not gender-specific. Agnes Francyswas found guilty of bewitching a horse and three people, and AgnesSteademan was found guilty of bewitching a woman and four cows sothat they became ‘violently ill’.23In 1587, Samond was indicted formurdering a woman by witchcraft. Three women, indicted at the sameassizes, were charged with killing livestock and a person by witchcraft.24There is nothing in these indictments to suggest that there was a dividebetween men’s and women’s witchcraft.The main difference between Samond and the women accused ofwitchcraft at the same assizes is that the women (except for his own wife)were generally found guilty, while he was acquitted. It is tempting toconclude that Samond was acquitted because he was a man; however, itis important to remember that conviction rates for witchcraft in Englandwere relatively low for both women and men. On the Home Circuit,fewer than half of the witchcraft indictments resulted in convictions, andonly 22 per cent of those indicted were executed.25In English witch-craft trials, a guilty verdict was by no means a foregone conclusion, andthere are many cases in the Essex records of women going free.[ 51 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 51"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEIn any case, Samond’s luck ran out later in 1587, at an assize ses-sion that demonstrates how difficult it is to draw solid conclusionsabout the role of gender in witchcraft prosecutions. Samond wasindicted at the Chelmsford Assizes in July, on the charges of bewitchingHenry Hove ‘so that he languished until 5 Apr. and then died’ and ofkilling a cow by witchcraft. Samond was tried before a grand jury, foundguilty, and sentenced to be hanged. At the same session, two womenwere also indicted for witchcraft: they were acquitted.26Despite Samond’s many indictments, we do not know very muchabout him. There is simply not enough information in the indictments toenable us to say with any certainty why he was finally convicted in 1587.If all of the accused witches at that assize session had been convicted, wecould surmise that they faced a ‘hanging’ jury that simply found everyoneguilty; but the acquittal of the two women prevents us from reaching thatconclusion. Perhaps, after twenty-seven years, Samond had exhaustedthe court’s and community’s patience. We cannot know, and in that senseJohn Samond does not help us establish explanatory models; but then,that is why he is so valuable. Samond is almost as much of a nuisance tomodern scholars looking for patterns as he was to his community ofDanbury. He muddles the patterns, and in doing so forces us to re-exam-ine our assumptions about both male and female witches.Chonrad Stoeckhlin, OberstdorfFrom 1587 to 1592, a wave of witch trials rolled across the prince-bish-opric of Augsburg. In one district, Oberdorf, the trials claimed sixty-eight lives: ‘the single largest persecution to be found anywhere betweenthe Danube River and the Alps.’27This wave began in the judicial dis-trict of Rettenberg in 1586, when Chonrad Stoeckhlin, a herdsman inthe alpine village of Oberstdorf, accused Anna Enzensbergerin of beinga witch. Stoeckhlin’s accusation initiated a series of trials that resultedin the executions of approximately twenty-five people, includingStoeckhlin himself. Although both men and women were accused[ 52 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 52"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALduring the course of the trials, all of those executed in the district ofRettenberg, except for Stoeckhlin, were women.28This case appears, on the surface, to reflect a simple anti-femaledynamic. Several women were burned at the stake on the word of a man,and those men who were also accused managed to escape the fire.Wolfgang Behringer, whose microhistory of Chonrad Stoeckhlin pro-vides the basis for this discussion, suggests, plausibly, that the courtaccepted accusations against women more readily than accusationsagainst men, and that men were more likely to flee when they wereaccused.29The fact that one man was executed may not seem signifi-cant when viewed against the number of women who died.The case of Chonrad Stoeckhlin issignificant, however, preciselybecause the trials at Rettenberg were so biased against women. In a con-text that appears almost uniformly misogynist, Stoeckhlin, like JohnSamond, confuses the pattern and forces us to ask more questions aboutthe relationship of gender to witch trials and contemporary knowledgeabout witches. Also like Samond, Stoeckhlin fails on several counts tofit the model of the male witch constructed by modern scholars. He wasaccused independently of a close female relative (there was a connectionwith a female relative, but not in a way which conforms to the model: seenote 43); he was accused at the very beginning of a witch panic, not inits later stages; and he was accused of the most stereotypical elements ofwitchcraft: the pact with the Devil, night flight to the Sabbath, andsexual intercourse with the Devil.How did Stoeckhlin become a witch? His complex path to the stakehas been reconstructed by Wolfgang Behringer from the court records ofhis trial. Born in 1549, Chonrad Stoeckhlin was the horse wrangler ofOberstdorf, a position of responsibility and considerable status.According to Behringer, ‘The post of horse wrangler was the most emi-nent in the hierarchy of herdsmen, well above the more numerous herds-men for oxen, cows, goats, sheep, and geese. ... [H]orses were regardedas prestige animals, whose care demanded the greatest attention and thehighest qualifications.’ Stoeckhlin was married, and he and his wife had[ 53 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEseven children, of whom only two survived infancy. He inherited his posi-tion as horse wrangler when his father went blind in 1567. His motherdied in 1571, a year of famine. Stoeckhlin and his family were notwealthy, but they seem to have been comfortable: they had a house andwere able to keep a cow in the wintertime.30In February 1578, Stoeckhlin and his friend Jacob Walch, anoxherd, spent an evening drinking wine and talking about death and theafterlife. They made a pact with each other that ‘whichever of the twoshould die first should come to the other one ... and [should] show himwhat it is like in that world.’ Eight days later, Walch died suddenly. Afteranother eight days, while Stoeckhlin was out in the woods, Walch’s spiritappeared to him and told him to repent his sins.31Stoeckhlin and hisfamily took this instruction seriously, and after a year of penanceStoeckhlin was rewarded by a visit from what would turn out to be hispersonal angel. This angel, which Stoeckhlin described to his interroga-tors as ‘a person dressed in white with a red cross on his (or her) fore-head’, transported him to ‘a strange and distant place’ where hewitnessed ‘pain and joy’. The angel became Stoeckhlin’s ‘soul-guide’; itappeared several times a year to take him on soul-journeys as part of agroup Stoeckhlin called the phantoms of the night (die Nachtschar).32In addition to his responsibilities as a herdsman, Stoeckhlin was ahealer.33It was not unusual for herdsmen to function as healers of bothanimals and humans: ‘Herdsmen served ... as veterinarians; like black-smiths, midwives, and executioners, their help was much in demand forhuman sicknesses too’, including illnesses caused by magic.34Stoeckhlin’s contact with the supernatural realm of the Nachtscharincreased his perceived powers and led his fellow villagers to connecthis healing abilities to special powers of identifying those who hadcaused magical illnesses. He became a witch-finder: he named thewitches responsible for injuries and sicknesses, and knew how to forcethem, ritually, to undo their evil magic.35In the spring of 1586, someone in Oberstdorf consulted Stoeckhlinabout a string of injuries. The horse wrangler determined that a [ 54 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 54"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALsixty-year-old woman, Anna Enzensbergerin, was the culprit, and urgedher to reverse her spell. Instead of doing so, however, Enzensbergerinfled the village for a time. When she returned, the authorities ofOberstdorf arrested her on ‘the bare testimony’ of Stoeckhlin, who hadlearned she was a witch from the leader of the night phantoms. This accu-sation would prove to be Stoeckhlin’s undoing. The district authoritiessent an inquiry regarding the case to the Dillingen Ruling Council. TheCouncil ruled that Enzensbergerin should be held in custody, ChonradStoeckhlin should be questioned, and an executioner should be found‘who would know “how to torture these kinds of people”’. Around 27July, Stoeckhlin was arrested and taken to Fluhenstein Castle, nearSonthofen. His first hearing took place on 29 July, when he was ques-tioned by the district judge, district governor, and county clerk.36Why arrest Stoeckhlin, a respectable and respected member of thecommunity, whose powers were for healing, not harming, people?Stoeckhlin was not, by our standards, and certainly not by his own, awitch; however, the officials of the bishopric of Augsburg seem to havefound it all too easy to suspect him of being one. They knew that he hadaccused Enzensbergerin, and they knew about his nocturnal flights. Atthe first hearing, they questioned Stoeckhlin about his journeys. Heexplained that there were three kinds of journey: that of the Nachtschar;the ‘righteous journey’ in which ‘the dead are led to their places’; andthe witches’ flight. Stoeckhlin said that he never flew with the witchesand knew nothing about their flight, but his story meshed too well withhis learned interrogators’ knowledge of witches to allay their suspicions.Aerial flight, at night, with a group of mysterious men and women, ledby an ‘angel’... as far as the authorities were concerned, what Stoeckhlindescribed to them was the witches’ flight to the Sabbath, led byStoeckhlin’s ‘sex-devil’.37Their image of Stoeckhlin was not improvedwhen Anna Enzensbergerin and Barbara Luzin, his deceased mother’sstepsister, not only confessed to being witches but also claimed that theyhad learned all they knew from Stoeckhlin’s mother, Ursula Schedlerin.Ironically, Stoeckhlin had accused both women himself.38[ 55 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 55"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEOn the basis of Stoeckhlin’s initial hearing and the confessions ofEnzensbergerin and Luzin, the district officials compiled a lengthy ques-tionnaire of 146 items. The questions reveal the primary elements of theirbelief that Stoeckhlin was a witch: no one could recognise witches unlesshe already belonged to their society; the Nachtscharwere really witchesflying to the Sabbath; Stoeckhlin’s angel was a black sex-devil;Stoeckhlin’s mother was a witch; and several of Stoeckhlin’s children haddied early, possibly sacrificed to the Devil or used to make witches’salves.39They interrogated Stoeckhlin again in November and December,gradually forcing his original narrative to conform to theirs.Stoeckhlin wastortured brutally, and confessed in December to all of the charges in thequestionnaire.His ordeal came to an end on 23 January 1587,when he wasburned at the stake. He spent over six months in prison, was subjected totortures which nearly killed him, and was transformed by the officialprocess from a healer and witch-finder into a witch.40There is nothing about Stoeckhlin’s case to set him apart from thethousands of other witches who were accused, tried and condemned inearly modern Europe. By the time his interrogators were finished,Stoeckhlin had become, from a learned point of view, the most stereo-typical witch imaginable. He flew on a goat; he attended the Sabbath,where he and the other witches ‘danced, feasted, and copulated’; he hada demon lover; he renounced God and made a pact with the Devil;41hemurdered his own children; he practised harmful magic; he had a Devil’smark; and he could transform himself into an animal.42The only thing‘wrong’ with the picture is that Stoeckhlin was not an old, poor, marginalwoman, but a fairly young man with a family and a decent living.If we look at Chonrad Stoeckhlin from a perspective coloured byconventional assumptions about male witches, we might be tempted todismiss him as an aberration who adds nothing to our understanding ofwitchcraft and gender. A male witch who was accused at the beginning ofa witch-hunt, independently of a female relative,43and charged withevery diabolic element in the early modern learned concept of witchcraft,looks very strange if one is committed to the idea that ‘real’ witches are[ 56 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 56"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES ON TRIALnecessarily female. This perspective assumes, in effect, that the men whosuspected and condemned Chonrad Stoeckhlin made a category error;that they were not conforming to their own intellectual system. Thisassumption, which appears to be implicit in most work on male witches,is deeply flawed. There is no suggestion, and no reason to believe, thatStoeckhlin’s judges experienced any sense of cognitive dissonance whenconfronted by a male witch. On the contrary, they appear to have beencommitted fully to his ‘witchness’ from the moment he was first broughtto their attention. If those men, supposedly more apt to associate womenwith witchcraft than we are, could assimilate a male witch within theirframework, then we must commit ourselves to doing the same.Samond and Stoeckhlin were unusual within their specific contextsbecause they were malewitches; but aswitches, they were not unusual.Nor were they unique: the same can be said of many other male witches,who also resemble closely the stereotypical (female) witch. For example,witches were feared for their power to cause impotence. In 1658, a mannamed Besnard appeared before the seigneurial court of Montréal onthe charge of having cast a spell on a newly-wed couple that preventedthe consummation of their marriage. He was fined and banished.44During the famous Salem trials of 1692, six men were hanged aswitches. Of these, four were related to female witches, and thus their casessupport the generalisation that men were secondary targets of accusa-tions. However, two of the men were not related to accused women. JohnWillard was a newcomer to Salem Village, and George Burroughs was theformer minister of the community.45Burroughs was represented by sev-eral witnesses as an extremely powerful wizard, and stands out from theother witches.46Willard, on the other hand, was described as a whollytypical witch who afflicted several individuals, causing illness and death.He even ‘suckle[d] the apparition of two black pigs on his breast’, just asso many female witches were supposed to have suckled their familiars.47In a more spectacular case, the Jesuit priest Urbain Grandier wasexecuted in 1634 at Loudun, having been found guilty of making a pact[ 57 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 57"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEwith the Devil, attending the witches’ Sabbath, owning books of magic,and causing the demonic possessions of several Ursuline nuns.Evidence against Grandier included the presence of several Devil’smarks on his body. It was very common for witches to be searched forDevil’s marks, and for them to be found on or near the sexual organs.These insensitive spots were found ‘in the most secret parts of[Grandier’s] body, in the two buttocks close to his anus, and in the twotesticles’.48After Grandier’s arrest, many of his associates, both maleand female, were accused of being witches.49Finally, William Godfrey, a yeoman farmer in New Romney, Kent,was charged with witchcraft in 1617. His neighbours accused him ofvarious maleficia, including laming lambs, killing horses, and killing achild. Godfrey’s wife and two children, a son and a daughter, were notaccused of witchcraft, and the case against him was thrown out.50ThatGodfrey’s neighbours were serious about their accusations may beinferred from an assault on him. William Clarke attacked Godfrey witha cudgel ‘in a vain attempt to extract a confession’ after Godfrey jokedabout bewitching Clarke’s mare.51Malcolm Gaskill has pointed out that Godfrey, a middling house-holder, prosperous farmer and landlord, and active participant in civiclife,does not match the stereotype of the ‘elderly,marginal widow depend-ent on charity, or the equally socially-ambivalent younger single womanwho fails to meet the conventional expectations of her neighbours, oftenher female peers’. On the other hand, Gaskill argues, ‘Godfrey’s story canalso be read as a classic tale of fear and maleficium.’ The case raises theissue of ‘the way historians classify aspects of the past’: as Gaskill says, ‘wecan either explain away the social identity of the accused as an exceptionto a rule or, more fruitfully, we can redefine the rule to accommodate thatidentity within a broader interpretative scheme.’52Richard Kieckhefer has probed the beginnings on the ‘elaboratedconcept’ during the 1430s in the western Swiss canton of Vaud.

In the trials of Pierre Munier(1448) and François Marguet of Dommartin (1498), the men wereaccused of precisely the same kind of crimes as women were: renounc-ing God, doing homage to the Devil, attending ‘sects’ or ‘synagogues’ ofwitches, eating the flesh of infants, and misdeeds such as profanation ofthe Eucharist or killing persons or animals.53Such an interpretative scheme needs to take into account the simi-larities between male and female witches. As the examples presented inthis chapter demonstrate, the social identities of witches were variable,but, once labelled as such, they all fit within the framework of earlymodern beliefs about witches as Devil-worshippers and practitioners ofmaleficium.This does not mean that there were no differences betweenmale and female witches. Lyndal Roper has found that in sixteenth-cen-tury Augsburg there was ‘a gendered specialization in the practice ofsorcery itself ’, which ‘emerges most vividly in the different ways maleand female sorcerers made use of parts of the body in sorcery.’ Men usedwritten spells and ‘more exotic bodily relics derived from criminals’ (seefigure 1), while women used more spoken spells and ‘the natural magi-cal properties of the body.’54Eva Labouvie and Willem de Blécourt havealso found differences in the types of witchcraft attributed to men andwomen.55These findings are important and certainly worthy of furtherinvestigation; however, these fine distinctions should not obscure thefact that conventional modern generalisations about male witches havecreated a false dichotomy between the men and women accused ofwitchcraft and have imposed on the past a narrow conception of earlymodern attitudes toward gender and witchcraft. Gaskill’s closing com-ments about William Godfrey and his accusers are appropriate:‘Godfrey’s case may well have been atypical, but to the people of NewRomney in 1617 – not least Godfrey himself – it was as valid and real anexperience of the European “witch-craze” as any other prosecution inthe early modern period.’56In order to be meaningful, our interpretative frameworks have to bejust as capable of accommodating the atypical experiences as they are of[ 59 ]chapter2 21/12/04 9:09 am Page 59"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEaccommodating the typical.

Women accusedof witchcraft resisted in various ways, including the recantation of con-fessions made under torture. This very resistance, particularly recanta-tion, has led to some highly questionable interpretations of witchcraftcases. On one hand, it is necessary to recognise the possibility of resist-ance and the role of the accused witch in shaping the narrative of his orher confession. To speak as if confession under torture were simplyinevitable erases the struggles of accused witches.1On the other hand,it is possible to take the recognition of agency too far, and to distort expe-riences and motivations. Women and men were influenced by the oper-ations of power, but also influenced these in turn. Agency theory positsthat actors always have choices, no matter how restricted; ‘agent-cen-tred’ morality proposes a novel twist on both traditional Kantian inter-nalist categories and a useful political starting point for taking agents’conscious moral choices seriously.2In this chapter, we address the problems of both male and femalewitches’ agency and selfhood. Issues of agency and resistance are notchapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 65"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEspecific to women, even if women have been foregrounded in studiesrelating to both concepts. We have seen that it was quite possible that amajority, even a large majority, of accused witches in a given regionmight be men. Ideas about male witches and accusations against themmay have differed somewhat from those concerning women, but in gen-eral they were more alike than unlike. Therefore, we must apply ques-tions regarding agency and resistance to cases involving men as well asto those involving women.We approach agency and resistance first through a critique ofLyndal Roper’s psychoanalytical reading of witchcraft confessions,then through an analysis of witchcraft trials that involved what WolfgangBehringer has dubbed ‘the elaborated concept of witchcraft’, the theoryof satanic allegiance typically invoked during ‘epidemic’ episodes ofwitch-hunting, thereby bracketing out most accusations involving‘minor’ witchcraft, popular magic, healing spells, potions and the like.3The scholar of early modern witchcraft faces a number of difficultmethodological and epistemological problems, most of which stem fromthe ‘impossible’ nature of witchcraft itself. The problem of how to readand assess ‘non-factual’ witchcraft materials – that is, witchcraft trial tes-timony – is central to witchcraft scholarship.4However, the troubledrelationship between witchcraft scholars and their materials goes deeper.Research into early modern witch-hunting and ideas about witches isclosely dependent on witchcraft trials; indeed, without the trials, therecould be very little of such research at all. Even the intellectual historianof witchcraft, putatively uninterested in actual prosecutions, works withmaterials that are linked closely with trials: the authors of late medievaland early modern demonological treatises drew heavily on trial accountsfor evidence to develop and sustain their arguments. These treatises, inturn, contributed to the evolution of learned witchcraft theory and thusto the dynamics and patterns of witchcraft prosecutions.On one level, this is merely stating the obvious. But, when one con-siders more carefully the central role of trials in the production of witch-craft materials, it becomes apparent that modern scholars are locked[ 66 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 66"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"[ 67 ]AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEinto an intimate relationship with processes that involved the deliberateinfliction of extreme suffering. We may decry the methods of interroga-tors and torturers, or express admiration and sympathy for accusedwitches, but we remain in the uncomfortable position of benefiting –intellectually and professionally – from the ordeals of others. This is notto suggest that we should stop studying witchcraft, any more than weshould stop studying the history of warfare, science, or any other sub-ject. Our research, however, needs to be accompanied by serious reflec-tion on the ethics of representing others. Such reflection, we submit, islacking in witchcraft studies, with scholars preserving virtual silence onthe ethical, as opposed to methodological or political, problems associ-ated with writing about witches and witchcraft. It is important to statethat we are not opposed to multiple readings of historical materials, norto postmodern approaches. We are, however, opposed to readings – ofany school – that treat human subjects as blank slates upon which a his-torian may inscribe whatever he or she wishes. Historians have greatfreedom in their interpretations simply because their subjects are dead.This ought to be regarded as a privilege, not as a right. It is unethical touse that freedom to shape our representation of historical subjects toserve us and our (political) agendas without any thought of servingthem, preserving their memory, and re-presenting them.5To the extent that we have access – via distorting, rhetoricallycharged tropes and textualisations, to be sure – to historical actors’ cat-egories, we are bound to take them seriously as historical factors, nomatter how silly, naive or misguided they might seem to, say, a prag-matic suburban car salesman or a worldly advertising executive. It isquite true, as Lyndal Roper has suggested, that we cannot read witch-craft confessions as straightforward documents susceptible to analysisby traditional methods such as ‘historical realism’.6However, we arelicensed to examine the documents for traces not merely of the inter-rogators’ knowledge or theory that shaped the proceedings, but alsofor the resistances and principles that shaped the contributions of theaccused witch. Roper intended to do this, but was blocked from doingchapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 67"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEso with an open mind by the ideological engagements she brought toher sources.In her much-reviewed and highly original collection Oedipus andthe Devil: Witchcraft, Sexuality and Religion in Early Modern Europe,Roper approached the topic of witchcraft confessions and their recan-tation from a psychoanalytic perspective. One of Roper’s great accom-plishments in this book, composed of nine substantial and thematicallyrelated articles or chapters, was to call into question traditional feministapproaches to domestic and sexual power politics as expressed in herfirst book,The Holy Household: Women and Morals in ReformationAugsburg.7Arguing in Oedipus and the Devilthat women who enduresexual oppression and even abuse in patriarchal societies are more thanjust victims, Roper applied assiduously and to impressive effect the by-now familiar theory of limited agency: not only the powerful, but alsothe oppressed have and make choices and respond even to abuse inways that make it easier for them to live with misery and with themselves;suppressed rebellion is still rebellion and evidence of it discreditsmisogynistic narratives of passivity.8This theory turns out to be bothuseful to us, because it helps us to understand the actions of someaccused witches, and useful to Roper’s psychoanalytic agenda, as itgives her a political structure into which to fit otherwise strange, evenself-incriminating statements and actions.Roper was interested in the motivations for confession and theo-retical explanations designed to get behind them. Regina Bartholome(Augsburg, 1670) provided a case study that gave the original paper andthe entire collection its name.9Regina, aged twenty-one when she wastried for witchcraft, confessed that she was a witch. Roper argued that‘the fantasy of witch-hood is created in a project of collaborationbetween questioner and accused, and that the dynamic by which it pro-gressed can indeed be usefully explained psychoanalytically.’10InRegina’s case, Roper suggested, Oedipal tensions and self-destructivetendencies combined to produce a dramatic confession to witchcraftand Devil-worship.[ 68 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 68"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEIn another essay in the same collection (‘Witchcraft and fantasy’),Roper uses the case of Anna Ebeler, a lying-in maid who was executedas a witch at Augsburg in 1669, to elaborate on her understanding ofwitchcraft confessions as products of collusion between the witch andher interrogators. This collusion was not entered into freely by theaccused witch, but was a last hope of steering and participating in theelaboration of a confession.11This would be a very subtle and deep-reaching insight into the process by which witchcraft accusations andconfessions were concocted, but for Roper’s sense that more was at playthan simple collusion as a result of exercising a restricted but crucialagency. While she dutifully invoked the limitations and qualificationsclearly attendant upon any application of Freudian theory to pre-modern individuals, psychosexual complexions and complexes, Ropereventually let go of all pretence and put accused witches from Bavariaand Swabia on a Viennese couch. Roper argued – and this is strong stuff– that in the ‘play’ (her word) of torture, confession, retraction, re-tor-ture, re-confession and further recantation, the witch participated insexually charged ways in her own destruction.Despite this profoundly partisan reading of women’s motivations,one of the great accomplishments of Roper’s book was to reconnectfemale physicality with women’s experience of life (in the early modernworld) as regards maternity, sex, nurturing infants and children, andmost especially, gender relations. In the context of witch-hunting andinterrogation, Roper argued that we must take female physicality andreproductive differences from men seriously. Female witches were oftenaccused of ‘bad nurture’, of making suckling infants or children wither,shrivel up, fail to thrive, and die. The recognition that many womenaccused of witchcraft (at least at Augsburg) were lying-in maids chargedby the mothers of babies who got sick or failed to thrive has helped tobuild a more nuanced historiography relating to witch-hunting.12Female physicality had other implications. Roper speculated that inconsequence of the forced intimacy between torturer and witch, alwaysfigured as a woman, an intimate relationship developed. It was built on[ 69 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 69"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEthe physical incursions of the torturer on the woman’s flesh and his serv-ices afterwards in binding up the wounds. Thus, ‘a bond of intense per-sonal dependence on the part of the witch on her persecutor [sic] mightbe established.’13The conditional mood of the auxiliary verb ‘might’ iscrucial; and it would be much harder to make the same argument andto adduce the same psychosexual consequences if the witch were a man.The notion of sexually charged collusion between executioner andwitch relies very largely on the preconception that witches were women.Indeed, Roper discussed no male witches at all.Roper explicitly sexualised the process of torture using banal lan-guage from the well-worn repertoire of Freudian sexology:Once the torturer’s application of pain had brought the witch toconfess, she knew she faced execution, and she knew her execu-tioner. In the procedure of interrogation itself, carried out in thepresence of council interrogators, scribes and executioner, there isan unmistakable sado-masochistic logic, as the witch, in responseto pain, might reveal details of her crimes only to deny them subse-quently; or as she proffered scattered scraps of information aboutdiabolic sex only then to tantalizeher questioners with contradic-tion or silence. In this sadistic game of showing and concealing, thewitch forcedher persecutors to apply and reapply pain, prising herbody apart to find her secret. Once it was found, she might herselfidentify withthe aggressor [italics added throughout].14To suggest that a witch, no matter how much she ‘directed’ her con-fessions and recantations, was engaged in a sado-masochisticunder-taking, or that she tantalisedher tormentor, or even forcedhim to applypain, is both to distort the concept of agency and to subordinate agencyto unconscious drives. This distorts the accused witch’s role in theinterrogation dynamic in the service of psychoanalytic theory. Roper’slanguage is laden with implications that the accused witch derived ben-efit or pleasure from the experience of interrogation under torture, orthat she was, on some level, a willing participant. It is, of course, within[ 70 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 70"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEthe realm of possibility, however unlikely, that an individual witchmight respond to interrogation in this way. Roy Porter has alluded tothe sado-masochistic sexual tendencies in Romantic literary depictionsof witches and witch trials; one wonders about the lenses throughwhich modern scholars view the topic, and where these lenses originate.15Evidence from other early modern witchcraft cases, as well asaccounts by modern torture survivors, suggests that Roper has paidinsufficient attention to the complex relationship between the devastat-ing effects of torture and the struggle of the torture victim to maintain asense of identity. The fact that an accused witch prolonged her ordeal byrecanting does not necessarily mean that she was engaged in a patho-logical, self-destructive game. Occam’s razor allows – perhaps requires– us to posit much simpler explanations for such behaviour: confessionwas offered to stop torture, but recantations were made for totally dif-ferent reasons, and not to elicit more torture or as part of a sado-masochistic engagement. To believe as Roper seems to do is to bind thestatements and explicit self-justifications of those accused of witchcraftto a procrustean bed.An example from eighteenth-century Zug in the SwissConfederacy shows that witches could be tortured into confessing, thenrecant repeatedly without any evidence of Oedipal or other Freudiancomplexes at work. In the trials at Zug in 1737, Marx Stadlin and hisdaughter Euphemia withstood all the horrific tortures applied to themand refused to confess to anything, and were therefore released.However, Anna Maria Stadlin, Marx’s wife, said ‘she would rather saythat she was a witch than be tortured so – she was already half dead’.Nevertheless, in keeping with her husband’s and daughter’s strongfaith, she recanted six times, until she collapsed finally under repeatedtorture and confessed one last time.16Her motivation to confess andrecant repeatedly might have had something to do with the kind of‘vicious circle’ or Teufelskreisthat Roper invokes – at least in the sensethat psychological terror can be both irresistible and resisted by turns,[ 71 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 71"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEbut there is no reason to suspect further depth-psychological levelswhen Anna Maria seems to have been innocent, along with her family,and did her best to follow their martyr-like example.Modern studies and first-hand accounts of torture also offer usefulinsights into the dynamics of interrogation. The testimony of moderntorture survivors indicates that people resist interrogation under torturefor as long as they can, and that the psychological effects of torture arevaried but severe.17They also indicate that, while confessions mayindeed be produced through a process of shaping and reshaping byboth the prisoner and the interrogator, to suggest that prisoners experi-ence this process as a sado-masochistic gameis ludicrous. That is, theymay well see their interrogators as sadists playing a game with theirlives,18but not themselves as masochistic participants.Survivors’ accounts suggest various reasons for resistance andcapitulation to interrogation. In one case, summarised in an essay byFelicity de Zulueta, a Tunisian man refused to cooperate with his inter-rogators despite being subjected to terrible torture. When asked by aninterviewer why he did not cooperate, he responded that ‘he wanted topreserve his dignity. He could not admit that people could be forcedagainst their will.’19Others have described their feelings of intense fearand vulnerability, and explained that they confessed simply in order tostop the torture. A set of accounts by Burmese prisoners containsrepeated stories of attempts to resist interrogation that falter or fail dueto fear, confusion, and mental and physical exhaustion:‘When my physical situation deteriorated and I was unable todelay my interrogators any longer, I gave them some of the infor-mation they wanted.’20‘I became unsure of reality and my answers became inconsistent.Was I dreaming, or was all this really happening?’21‘I wasn’t sure if I could take another round of torture. ... I wastrembling with fear and I tried to come up with something thatwould get me out of the physical abuse.’22[ 72 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 72"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKE‘I was providing answers to their questions that I had previouslyresisted giving them. This was because I was weak and beginningto feel depressed.’23There is nothing in such accounts to suggest that the authors believedtheir experiences were a game, or that they derived any sort of pleasurefrom them. For both men and women, being interrogated under torturewas clearly deeply traumatic.We have already noted that Lyndal Roper’s psychosexual interpre-tation depends on female witches and male interrogators. It is undeni-able that torture was and is very often sexualised, either through theapplication of pain to the genitals, rape, or the threat of rape. What maybe forgotten is that women are not the only victims of sexual torture.24The following statements are from a female and a male Burmese torturesurvivor:One officer threatened that if I refused to confess I would lose myvirginity. I was so frightened that I couldn’t eat or sleep. If I con-fessed to the crime, although I had nothing to do with it, I wouldbe sentenced to death. I couldn’t decide what to do; I was in animpossible situation and I nearly went mad.25Suddenly, a guard kicked me behind my knee. I collapsed on thefloor on my knees. When I tried to stand up, I was forced to lie onmy back and I was handcuffed. The hood was still over my headand I was lying face down on the floor. Suddenly, my sarong wastaken off. I wasn’t wearing any underwear and my lower body wascompletely naked. ... I don’t want to describe what followedbecause I don’t even want to think about it. ... A voice broke thesilence. ‘Moe Aye, think carefully and tell us the truth. If youdon’t, we will make you a homosexual.’ Someone then sat on topof me. Another took off my handcuffs, pulled both of my handsforward and handcuffed me again. I was about to be raped byanother man. I was absolutely terrified as I expect anyone wouldbe in such a situation.26[ 73 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 73"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 74"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"2The Bamberg Hexenhaus(witch-house), after a copper-plate engraving formerly in the Royal Library at Bamberg.chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 75"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEBoth survivors express extreme fear and horror at the threat of rape (nei-ther was actually raped), showing clearly that sexual torture and itseffects are not suffered by women only.We are not suggesting that torture lacks ‘cultural mutability’, or thatmodern categories may be imported wholesale into the past; indeed, wehave argued precisely the opposite in our critique of Roper. LisaSilverman has argued persuasively that there are important differencesbetween the early modern context of torture, in which the applicationof pain in the pursuit of truth was both legal and ‘partook of ... a gen-eral cultural consent’, and the modern context, in which torture is ille-gal and non-consensual.27Nevertheless, whatever the differences inculture, language and epoch between these survivors and early modernwitches, they all had certain things in common: pain, resulting from thetorture of their body; fear, even horror, of further or more brutal torture.And in all the cases we adduce here, they also have in common a fiercedesire to resist the force being practised upon them – albeit with differ-ing motivations: to preserve their soul, or the integrity of their person-ality, or their dignity, though these are, perhaps, different ways ofreferring to similar sorts of interiority.A case studyThe city of Bamberg was the site of one of the most infamous mass per-secutions of witches in European history, with at least nine hundredburnings between 1624 and 1630.28Wolfgang Behringer hasaccounted for this surge by reference to massive crop failures, faminesand epidemics in the period after 1624.29Johannes Junius, aBürgermeister(variously burgomaster, alderman) of fifty-five, whosewife had been executed for witchcraft the previous year, was first exam-ined on a charge of witchcraft on Wednesday, 28 June 1628, in what wasfor Bamberg a typical trial.30Junius was almost certainly held and tor-tured in the Bamberg Hexenhaus, which was purpose-built for thisfunction in the summer of 1627 (see figure 2). It should be noted that[ 76 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 76"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEthere is no mention in the trial record or elsewhere that Junius wasaccused because of his wife’s conviction.At this first hearing, torture was not applied. Junius was accusedby Dr Georg Adam Haan31of having frequented a gathering of witchesin the electoral council chambers, where they ate and drank together.The accusation was, therefore, aimed directly at the top levels of urbansociety, and would seem to have been as much about civic politics,power and honour as about anything else. Junius denied this chargein its entirety, along with another concerning a ‘witch-dance’ in theHauptsmor(Hamptsmoor) forest made by a woman named Elsse, wifeor perhaps daughter of Hopffen (‘Hopffens Elsse’). Having been leftto think for two nights on the charges made against him by his sup-posed accomplices, Junius was again interrogated on Friday of thatsame week (30 June 1628). He was admonished to confess, butrefused, and so was tortured, first by thumbscrews. He refused to con-fess anything, insisted that he had never denied God his Saviour orallowed himself to be baptised blasphemously, that is in a satanicparody of Christian baptism (see figure 3). The scribe wrote that hefelt no pain. Under the intensified torture of leg-screws, Juniusremained firm, confessing nothing. He professed to know nothing ofthe charges. He insisted again that he had never renounced God norever would, and that he still felt no pain. Subjected to the strappado,with his shoulders dislocated and his ligaments no doubt badly torn,Junius repeated that he had never renounced God and that God wouldnot forsake him; he repeated that he knew nothing of witchcraft.Finally, Junius was stripped and examined, and a bluish mark like aclover leaf on his left side was pricked three times, but Junius was saidto have felt no pain, and no blood flowed from it.Both unnatural phenomena were believed to be signs of a witch:witches could not, according to current theories about witchcraft, feelordinary pain, as they were protected from it by their pact with theDevil. Pain, as induced by torture, was meant to break through this layerof protection and help undo the bewitchment, leading a witch from the[ 77 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 77"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEDevil to confession and reconciliation before salvific execution. Itshould be noted that although the court reporter claims that Junius feltno pain in the thumbscrews and leg-screws, Junius later wrote in a clan-destine letter to his daughter that he suffered terrible agony underrepeated hoistings and droppings (eight) via the strappado. This letterfurnishes the core of our argument against Roper’s readings of witches’confessions and their recantation.Five further days of confinement in what we can legitimately pre-sume to have been excruciating pain were followed by a hearing onWednesday, 5 July, a mere week after Junius was first questioned.Without torture, the trial documents duly inform us, but under theurgent persuasion of the questioners, Junius ‘at last begins and con-fesses’. Junius collapsed, furnishing the court with detailed accountsof his misdeeds and naming others who had been present, thereby[ 78 ]3Male and female witches; ‘new mock baptism’ of a male witch by a devil.chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 78"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEaccusing them of witchcraft as well. The details of his confession con-form closely to the ‘elaborated concept of witchcraft’, as WolfgangBehringer has described it, that quasi-literary confabulation of satanic,pagan and folk practice with utterly imaginary but quite ancient slan-ders that had first coalesced in the Malleus maleficarumof 1487, butdid not reach its fully formed state until the sixteenth century. It isimportant to note that Junius confessed to having renounced God inHeaven and all the heavenly host by the formula ‘I renounce God inHeaven and his host, and will henceforth recognise the Devil as myGod’ (see figures 4 and 5).32Given the insistence with which Juniushad, under torture, denied renouncing God, we can conclude that hehad been questioned closely and repeatedly about this item. The pres-ence in the confession not only of a description of the act, but also ofthe precise formula used, points to a carefully shaped and guided[ 79 ]4Male and female witches; male witch stepping on a cross as a sign of renouncing Christ.chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 79"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEprocess of question and response, which produced the final documentthat Junius ratified and confirmed in public on 6 August 1628, a fullmonth after he ‘at last began and confessed’. This is the key crimehere, as in most other cases involving the ‘elaborated concept’. Thereare also various local details and imps’ names in the confession, but itfollows the generic script very closely.Remarkable by contrast for its candour and clear-sighted desper-ation, Junius’ moving last letter to his daughter allows us to see at worka dynamic entirely different from that which Roper posited in heranalysis of the witch trials she chose to examine. Junius wrote to hisdaughter Veronica after he had ‘confessed’. Soldan and Heppe reportthat the letter survived because the judges kept it secret;33however, itspresence in the file with the other documents does not prove this. Onthe contrary, had the letter been in the hands of the magistracy before[ 80 ]5Male and female witches standing in a magical circle to swear allegiance to theDevil.chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 80"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEJunius’ execution, he probably would not have been given the coup degrâce with a sword to spare him from being burned alive.34Juniusdated the letter 24 July, approximately two weeks before his executionon 6 August; other internal evidence in the letter confirms this date.He declared his innocence movingly, in a rhetorically marked fashionthat heightened the effect of the word unschuldig: ‘Innocent I cameinto prison, innocent I was tortured,innocent I must die.’ He relatedthe circumstances of his first interrogations, which coincide preciselywith the trial record: he was accused by the chancellor’s son (Dr GeorgAdam Haan, presumably) and Hopffens Elsse; he denied having eatenand danced with them and having renounced God. Thus far one isfree to wonder to what extent he was repeating the official trial record,which may well have been read to him before 6 August, the date onwhich he confirmed his confession and was executed. However, aftertorture was applied, Junius’ story diverges on a number of significantpoints from the court record. As we mentioned above, the courtrecorder claims that Junius felt no pain from the thumbscrews, leg-screws or pricking – a sure sign of a witch. Junius, however, tells a verydifferent story:And then came – God in highest Heaven have mercy – the execu-tioner, and put the thumbscrews on me, both hands boundtogether, so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, sothat for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see fromthe writing ... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my handsbehind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought heavenand earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and letme fall again, so that I suffered horrible agony.35Junius dates this to Friday, 30 June. This accords with the trial record,but Junius makes a careful protocol of the pain involved. One has thesense that he feels a strong need to justify himself in his daughter’seyes, and in the eyes of someone else again even more important tohim: God.[ 81 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 81"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEJunius’s letter makes a number of startling revelations andexpresses his own motivations and sense of anguish at having confessedfalsely, at having said that he had renounced God, at having accusedothers unjustly under compulsion. First of all, the executioner may wellhave been no sadistic dungeon-master but a frightened, bewilderedfunctionary caught in the unstoppable judicial machinery that was con-suming witches all around him. In fact, the executioner presented him-self as a secret angel of mercy. He counselled Junius as follows:Sir, I beg you, for God’s sake confess something, whether it betrue or not. Invent something, for you cannot bear the torturewhich you shall suffer; and even if you bear it all, you still shallnot escape, not even if you were a count, but one torture willfollow another until you say you are a witch. Not before that willthey let you go, as you may see by their trials, for one is just likeanother.36It is highly improbable that any kind of tribunal should have instructedan executioner to counsel prisoners in this way. Furthermore, Juniusbegged his daughter to keep the letter secret because his jailers(Wechter) would be beheaded were it to be found. If we take the mostprobable reading of this advice, we must conclude that far from theexecutioner being forced by the accused witch to ‘apply and reapplytorture’, here the executioner was begging his prisoner to avoid fur-ther torture by making anyconfession. Junius wrote that he was deeplyanguished, day and night, about how to react to the executioner’sadvice, given that he would have to say that he was a witch, though hewas not, and renounce God, though he had never done so.The consequences of such a course of action were clearly, asbecomes manifest in his other reasons for confessing and his discus-sion of his anguish over his confession, both the lives of others andthe salvation of his own soul – not a sado-masochistic impulse to playJustine to the executioner’s bargain-basement Marquis de Sade.Junius’ solution is simple and shows how concerned he was with the[ 82 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 82"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEstate of his soul when the time came to face death. He would confessto avoid further (unnecessary) torture: ‘I would surely be better to sayit with mouth and words, even though I had not really done it; andafterwards I would confess it to the priest, and let those answer for itwho compel me to do it.’37By ‘answer for it’, Junius meant answer before God, since it wasclear that the interrogators were not about to have to answer for itbefore anyone else. Faced with the inevitability of his death, Juniusconfessed, but claimed in his letter to have done so with mental reser-vations and to have planned to confess his false confession to the priest.There is one obligatory reason why he would confess it to the priest,and it was not primarily to unburden his conscience. Confession wasby this time compulsory before receiving communion, but more impor-tantly, it was necessary to confess all sins if one were to be absolved ofthem before it was too late, that is, before death. In Counter-Reformation Europe, this message was hammered home by obligatoryweekly auricular confession and the adoption of the technology thatmade it practical: the confessional.38Junius then recounted, in termsthat closely mirror those of the official trial record, how his question-ers urged him to say that he had seen neighbours at the witch-gather-ings, telling him to take a mental walk up and down the streets, throughthe market and into the castle. Junius made an effort to name as fewpeople as possible. He was forced, however, to name his friend andcolleague in the city government, Dietmeyer. Then they urged him toconfess the crimes he had committed. When he said nothing, the courtordered him to be hoisted up again, so he said that he had been toldto kill his children, but that he had been unable to do so and had killeda horse in their place. This did not satisfy the court, Junius related, sohe said that he had taken a consecrated host and desecrated it, afterwhich he was left in peace. The court had extracted enough evidenceto convict him of diabolical witchcraft.Junius summed up his experience by repeating the key ideas andthe advice given him by the executioner:[ 83 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 83"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPENow dear child, here you have all my confession and [the recordof ] my trial, for which I must die. And they are sheer lies andinventions, so help me God. For I was forced to say all thisthrough fear of the torture that was threatened beyond what I hadalready endured. For they never leave off with the torture till oneconfesses something; no matter how good he really is, he must bea witch. Nobody escapes, even if he is a count.39After closing the letter formally, Junius adds:Dear child, six witnesses have testified at the same time againstme: the chancellor, his son, Neudecker, Zaner, Hoffmaisters Urseland Hopffens Els[se], all falsely, through coercion as they have alltold me, and begged me [to forgive them] for God’s sake beforetheir sentences were executed ... they knew nothing but goodand nice things about me. They were forced to say it, just as Imyself would experience.40Both those who accused Junius and Junius himself were, therefore,most anxious at the very end of their life to apologise for their false con-fessions, to set the record straight with their fellows and before God.There was a so-called Gnadenzettel, a ‘mercy note’ among the docu-ments pertaining to Junius’ case: he was given the coup de grâcewith asword before being consigned to the flames.41His status and his con-fession, which he seems not to have recanted publicly, were probably thechief motivating factors in the decision to spare him death by burning.Despite this small mercy, Junius sees himself as a martyr and calls him-self a martyr repeatedly: ‘Sterbe also unschuldig und wie ein martirer’(I die innocent and as a martyr). He writes toward the end of the letter:‘I beg you for the sake of the Last Judgement, keep this letter under care-ful watch and pray for me as your father for a true martyr after my death... You may boldly swear on my behalf that I am no witch (Trudner) buta martyr, and thus I die in readiness [for judgement].’42These passages have been published in excerpts in a number ofvenues: by Friedrich Leitschuh in 1883,43by George Lincoln Burr,[ 84 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 84"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEwho published a translation in a small pamphlet titled The Witch-Persecutions,44by Soldan and Heppe in their polemical Geschichte derHexenprozesse(Bauer’s revised edition, 1911–12);45by WolfgangBehringer in German;46and in the form of a rather stilted and highlyabridged translation by Alan Kors and Edward Peters in 1972 in theirclassic English-language source book on witch-hunting.47We h a v eappended a new translation of as much of the relevant portions of thetext as was available to us. Junius’ letter has been read previously as evi-dence for the injustice of witch trials; as proof that those accused gen-erally confessed only under duress, especially torture; as proof thatthose accused of witchcraft, especially during epidemics of witch-hunt-ing, did not need to have engaged in any traditional folk practices or‘magic’ to be accused of witchcraft and executed for it; as proof thatinterrogators ‘scripted’ confessions for the accused and backed up thesescripts with the threat of violence and actual violence. However, we canalso read this document as proof that those who confessed to witchcraftoften were forced to do so in the most brutal way; that ‘collusion’ in pro-ducing the confession was limited to lip-service; that a person likeJunius retained complete mental reservations concerning the confes-sion itself and intended to confess to confessing falsely to a priest; andthat people such as those mentioned by Junius and Junius himself apol-ogised to those they had falsely accused under torture.Certainly Junius was not without agency in this process. On thecontrary, he thought out and later recounted the mental process that ledhim to confess (in the light of the executioner’s advice) against his will,but in order to avoid further and clearly useless suffering. He made ashrewd calculation that the experienced executioner who pleaded withhim so sincerely was right that there was no escape in any case, and hechose a courageous and clever course of action. It is not unreasonableto suggest that his very human physicality, his inability to face furthertorture, led him to exercise his agency in this particular way. Roper, inseeing agency as irreducible and practically unfettered in the ‘collusion’of a witch in producing her or his confession, disregards the vast power[ 85 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 85"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEdifferential between interrogators,executioners and magistrates on theone hand, and anyone, including a burgomaster, or as Junius’ execu-tioner says, even a lord, who found himself charged with witchcraft –never mind a teenager, a middle-aged lying-in maid or a wet-nurse farfrom her own child – on the other. Junius is anxious over confessing tocrimes that must, had they been true, have entailed the eternal damna-tion of his soul (renouncing God, the ‘unforgivable sin’). The differenceis that Junius is able to find a way to confess while saving his soul. Juniushas an extremely powerful motivation: his own salvation, and probablythat of others, was at stake.Might we not say that those female witches whose confessions andretractions Roper analysed were moved by similar considerations?These women, we suggest, confessed and then withdrew their confes-sions in an agony of guilt at their wrong-doing and fear of its conse-quences, both for others falsely accused and for the salvation of theirown soul. Once forced to confess again, as the logic of the ‘elaboratedconcept’ of diabolical witchcraft would have required them to do, theyonce again recanted as quickly as possible. Roper suggests that a witchwho revokes her confession embarks on a horrifying ‘game’ of cat andmouse. Perhaps we can say that a witch who revokes her confession isasserting her self-understanding and self-definition, attempting to sal-vage her soul (or perhaps her ‘Christian personality’), and not playingany other game at all.Suzanne Gaudry, tried and executed for witchcraft at Ronchain in1652, was interrogated on three separate occasions and tortured. Theaccount of her first two interrogations suggests that she confessed freely tobeing a witch; that is, to being in the service of the Devil, to attending the‘nocturnal dance’, and to practising maleficium. The only signs of resist-ance are her statements that she ‘was frightened of being taken prisoner forthe crime of witchcraft’, that she had never abused the Holy Communion,and, in the second session, that her previous declaration was not true. Atthe end of each of these sessions, Gaudry signs a declaration of her various[ 86 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 86"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKEcrimes.48At the third interrogation, the dynamic changes. We quote theexchange between Gaudry and her interrogators at length:The prisoner being led into the chamber, she was examined toknow if things were not as she had said and confessed at thebeginning of her imprisonment. – Answers no, and that what shehas said was done so by force. ... Pressed to say the truth, thatotherwise she would be subjected to torture, having pointed outto her that her aunt was burned for this same subject. – Answersthat she is not a witch. ... Charged with having confessed tohaving made a horse die by means of a powder that the devil hadgiven her. – Answers that she said it, but because she found her-self during the inquisition pressed to say that she must have donesome evil deed; and after several admonitions to tell the truth: Shewas placed in the hands of the officer ... , throwing herself on herknees, struggling to cry ... [s]aying at every moment that she isnot a witch.49Gaudry maintains her innocence throughout this session, which isinteresting, for the court had learned that the ‘peasants’ who tookGaudry and another woman, Antoinette Lescouffre, to prison ‘had per-suaded them to confess in order to avoid imprisonment, and that theywould be let go’.50This advice tends to explain why Gaudry confessedat first; perhaps she realised that her confessions were not helping her case after all, and so she adopted a different strategy in her thirdinterrogation.The torture session shows Gaudry resisting, confessing,and recanting:The prisoner, before being strapped down, was admonished tomaintain herself in her first confessions and to renounce herlover. – Said that she denies everything she has said, and thatshe has no lover. Feeling herself being strapped down, says thatshe is not a witch, while struggling to cry. Asked why she fledoutside the village of Rieux. – Says that she cannot say it, thatGod and the Virgin Mary forbid her to; that she is not a witch.[ 87 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 87"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEAnd upon being asked why she confessed to being one, said thatshe was forced to say it. Told that she was not forced, that onthe contrary she declared herself to be a witch without anythreat. – Says that she confessed it and that she is not a witch,and being a little stretched [on the rack] screams ceaselessly thatshe is not a witch, invoking the name of Jesus and of Our Ladyof Grace, not wanting to say any other thing.

As soon as she began to confess, she asked whowas alongside of her, touching her, yet none of those presentcould see anyone there. And it was noticed that as soon as thatwas said, she no longer wanted to confess anything.51This witch cried out not to the Devil, but to Jesus and Mary – repeat-edly. This parallels the invocations and imprecations of those martyredfor their religious beliefs, as Brad Gregory has shown.52It could be that witches such as Suzanne Gaudry, ReginaBartholome, Anna Ebeler, and Anna Maria Stadlin were not as clear intheir minds as a legally experienced burgomaster about the contingentnature of a forced confession and one’s ability to exculpate oneself from itby formal confession. To be sure, simple women knew all about confes-sion if they were Catholics, but they might not have understood itsmechanics as well as Junius did. If they were not Catholics, confessionand absolution were not such simple matters for them,and as Gerald Strauss has shown, Protestants in the generations following[ 88 ]chapter3 21/12/04 12:15 pm Page 88"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"AGENCY AND SELFHOOD AT STAKELuther often had no real idea of the mechanics of justification by faithalone, freely given grace, and the whole edifice of theology that madeauricular confession theoretically unnecessary among Lutherans.53If we see both Junius and women accused of witchcraft such as AnnaEbeler as working to save their souls, we are freed from any reason to usemental gymnastics to apply culture-bound, place-bound and time-bound theories about human sexuality, or even the much-discussed linksbetween erosand thanatos, to explain their behaviour. These accusedwitches and recanters may well have been concerned first and foremostwith the state of their soul, their injury of others, and their own salvation.This definition of personal integrity might not correspond closely tocontemporary occidental understandings of personal identity, self-knowledge and the like. However, the integrity of the soul as regards sal-vation was crucial – as studies such as Brad Gregory’s book onmartyrdom,Salvation at Stake, are proving – to the self-understanding ofearly modern Christians in life-and-death confrontations with ‘capitaljustice’.53Men and women might have negotiated these confrontationsdifferently, but their motivations, as they expressed them, were funda-mentally the same. The soul in peril, not the femalepsyche, seems to havebeen the central concern to both accused and accusers. When torture isapplied to save souls (rather than to play games), then not only the tor-tured femalebody, but also the tortured humanbody, the receptacle of thehuman soul, deserves attention in studies of witch trials. Studies thatfocus on the trials of female witches perform the vital and much-neg-lected task of illuminating and recovering the role of women in history;however, such gender-specific studies often occult the gender-inclusivenature of witch-hunting and ideas about witches.Notes1 See e.g. Naess, ‘Norway: The criminological context’, 375. ‘Great painwas inflicted on the accused witches and sorcerers.

The next two chapters follow a similar approach to con-ventional perspectives on the demonological treatment of witchcraftand gender. Through the examination of witchcraft theorists’ descrip-tions of male witches, we aim to show that, just as with the ‘real life’cases, modern scholars’ views do not take sufficient account of the com-plexity of early modern learned theories about witches.The sources for this discussion are demonological treatises pub-lished in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The body ofwitchcraft literature is much too large to permit a complete survey; thereis, however, a smaller group of works that could be considered canoni-cal, at least from the perspective of contemporary scholarship. This‘canon’ includes Jean Bodin’s De la demonomanie des sorciers, JohannesNider’s Formicarius, and the Malleus maleficarum, which occupiespride of place within the literature as possibly the most (in)famous trea-tise of them all. In this chapter, we present data compiled from ten ofthese canonical works, as well as a brief discussion of demonologicalillustrations.Demonological literature has received relatively little scholarlyattention, especially compared with the number of published studiesthat focus on non-literary, archival materials such as court records andpamphlets. Although witchcraft scholars refer frequently to the Malleuschapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 95"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEand its fellow witchcraft treatises, they rarely engage in sustained analy-ses of these works. One reason for this neglect is the social-historicalemphasis on non-elite subjects; another is the generally poor reputationthat demonological texts have as documents of barbarity, superstition,and irrationality. H.R. Trevor-Roper, for example, said of them that To read these encyclopedias of witchcraft is a horrible experi-ence. Each seems to outdo the last in cruelty and absurdity.Together they insist that every grotesque detail of demonology istrue, that scepticism must be stifled, that sceptics and lawyerswho defend witches are themselves witches, that all witches,‘good’ or ‘bad’, must be burnt, that no excuse, no extenuation isallowable ... When we read these monstrous treatises, we find itdifficult to see their authors as human beings.1The historiographical tide is shifting, and several monograph stud-ies of demonological works and the contexts in which they were pro-duced are now available.2There are also essay collections and severalindividual articles dealing with this material.3In general, however,demonological literature has not attracted much scholarly attention,and within the historiographical genre of demonological studies,research has focused on the links between demonology and the rise anddecline of witch-hunting.This approach often takes the form of summarising and criticis-ing the arguments of individual authors. For example, ChristopherBaxter’s essay on Johann Weyer’s De praestigiis daemonumconsistsmainly of an evaluation of Weyer’s effectiveness in opposing witch-hunting. Baxter argues (against Trevor-Roper) that Weyer’s work isactually ‘a protest against policies of toleration’; if only, Baxter implies,Weyer had been more rational, he could have achieved the proper goalof arguing for tolerance.4Baxter remarks in his conclusion that‘Weyer’s writings badly misfired as a defence of witches’, in partbecause ‘his simplistic theological commitment prevent[ed] him frompushing through to a logical and systematic re-interpretation of [ 96 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 96"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"[ 97 ]DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHEStraditional attitudes an unprecedentedly diverse, though individuallyunoriginal, range of arguments for tolerance.’5Although there is genuine debate over the role of demonology inthe development and decline of witch-hunting,6interpretations ofdemonological conceptions of gender and witchcraft are remarkablyuniform in their concentration on what witchcraft theorists had to sayabout women. There is some disagreement over how representative orextreme demonological misogyny was (see chapter 1’s discussion ofStuart Clark’s views), but the focus on women itself has not been chal-lenged. This is understandable, to a point. There is no denying that themajor demonological treatises of the period, both those that advocatedwitch-hunting and those that opposed it, accepted that most witcheswere women. For example, in their explanation of why more womenthan men were witches, the much-quoted Institoris and Sprenger incor-porated many citations of classical, biblical and medieval authorities.One of these, a citation of Valerius’ letter to Rufinus, reads: ‘Chimerammulierem esse nescis sed scire debes quod monstrum illud triformeinsigni venustetur facie leonis olentis maculetur ventre capre virulentecauda vippere armetur. vult dicere. quod est aspectus eius pulcer. tactusfetidus. conuersatio mortifera.’7Most modern readers will be morefamiliar with Montague Summers’ translation: ‘You do not know thatwoman is the Chimaera, but it is good that you should know it; for thatmonster was of three forms; its face was that of a radiant and noble lion,it had the filthy belly of a goat, and it was armed with the virulent tail ofa viper. And he means that a woman is beautiful to look upon, contam-inating to the touch, and deadly to keep.’8When one reads such state-ments, it is not difficult to see why modern scholars, especially feminists,have been fascinated by demonological treatments of women.The problem is not that scholars have paid attention to the earlymodern demonological discourse about women and witchcraft; it is thatthey have given their attention onlyto the discourse about women, as ifearly modern authors said nothing about men as perpetrators of witch-craft. This is not because scholars are unaware of the presence of malechapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 97"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEwitches within demonological texts. Several historians, all of whomwere writing from a feminist perspective, have noticed that early modernauthors discussed male witches. For example, Anne Barstow mentionsthat Henri Boguet, chief judge of St. Cloud in Franche-Comté andauthor of the Discours des sorciers, said that male and female witcheswere equally addicted to the carnal pleasures offered by the Devil.9Carol Karlsen remarks on the language used by early modern authors:‘While authors of theological descriptions of witchcraft sometimesemployed female pronouns when speaking generally about witches,more commonly they used the “generic” male.’10Susanna Burghartz,while arguing that ‘a concentration on women as witches is certainly evi-dent’ in Nider’s Formicarius, says that ‘all the same, Nider’s examplesof witches include an astonishing number of men.’11The critical point here is that this is allthat these authors have tosay about the inclusion of male witches in early modern texts: they men-tion it once, then never bring it up again. In Barstow’s case, the refer-ence to Boguet’s ‘even-handedness’ is not even in the main body of thetext; it is buried in an appendix. Burghartz’s astonishment at finding anumber of male witches in the Formicariusis particularly telling.Burghartz knows from reading Richard Kieckhefer’s study of medievalEuropean witch trials that in the mid-fifteenth century, when theFormicariuswas composed, a significant proportion (32 per cent) ofwitches were male, and she knows that ‘it was always possible to prose-cute men for witchcraft’.12Why, then, the astonishment? Her reactionto the Formicariusindicates a strong degree of conditioning by a histo-riography and ideology that is always already committed to a particularway of reading demonological texts. Modern readers appear to assumethat there will be no surprises in the gendered discourse of these texts,and then seem unable to address them except in deceptively casual,throwaway remarks.Even Stuart Clark, whom one might expect to engage with malewitches in demonology, does not. Indeed, he does not mention theirtextual existence at all, despite his careful reading of the early modern[ 98 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 98"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESgendering of witchcraft. Like the other historians discussed above, heis well aware that many witches were men. He evinces no interest inthis fact, however, preferring to focus on why witches ‘were conceivedto be women.’13Clark suggests two points that bear on the subject ofmale witches: first, that there was a ‘lack of conformity betweendemonological theory and the actual sexual breakdown in those witch-craft prosecutions where men made up a significant minority or evena substantial portion of those accused.’ Second, he states that ‘it wasliterally unthinkable’, at a demonological level, ‘that witches should bemale,’ because early modern theorists were committed to a hierarchi-cally structured binary framework in which femaleness was associatedwith evil.14In effect, Clark argues not only that there was a concep-tual affinity between women and witchcraft, but also that there was aconceptual barrierbetween men and witchcraft.Clark’s conclusions are similar to those of Eric Wilson, whoseCambridge dissertation is the first modern study in English of theMalleus maleficarum. Wilson devotes a chapter to the issue of womenin the Malleus, but never once refers to the fact that the text’s authorsalso wrote about men who were witches, or to their use of both malefi-cusand malefica. He notes that ‘the text even employs the feminine formof the Latin word for witch ... rather than the more commonlyemployed masculine.’15Wilson knows full well that many witches weremale, and he states his agreement with Christina Larner that witch-hunting was sex-related rather than sex-specific;16nevertheless, he con-cludes that there was a ‘necessary relationship between women andwitchcraft’.17Both Clark and Wilson suggest that early modern demonology wassex-specific and thus different from witchcraft prosecutions, whichwere merely sex-related. This position is actually more extreme thanthat of most feminist scholars, who at least hint that demonological con-ceptions of gender and witchcraft were not always tidy and coherent. Itis not, perhaps, completely surprising that it is the feminists who haveshown more sensitivity. Their primary purpose, generally speaking, is[ 99 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 99"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEto explain the preponderance of women in witch trials; they examine thecontents of demonological treatises for evidence of systematic miso-gyny, and are less interested in the treatises as worthy objects of study inand of themselves.In contrast, scholars such as Clark and Wilson are interested inrecovering demonological texts from the historiographical neglect intowhich they had fallen. Clark and Wilson are not unsympathetic to fem-inist concerns, and treat the issue of women and witchcraft seriously;however, their underlying concern is with demonstrating the logic andcoherence of early modern demonology. This leads Clark and Wilsonto exclude male witches from their discussions because they are unableto incorporate them without subverting their intellectual-historicalagenda of making the texts respectably coherent.18We have emphasised the exclusion of male witches from analysesof witchcraft literature so strongly because it is simply not credible thatscholars working with these texts (at least those working with original-language editions) do not know about them.19As table 2 shows, it wasnot at all uncommon for early modern authors from the fifteenth to theseventeenth century to refer to witches in both masculine and feminineterms. Furthermore, certain treatises included illustrations of both maleand female witches, and individual male witches are described in manytracts. It is only by deciding, a priori, that male witches are insignificantthat one could treat early modern demonology as sex-specific.TextsWhen we ‘discovered’ that Heinrich Institoris and Jacob Sprengerreferred to witches in both masculine and feminine terms, one of ourfirst questions concerned the relative frequency of the masculine usage.Just how often did these and other authors employ masculine formswhen discussing witches, and did they do so more frequently than theyused feminine forms? Modern commentary on the language ofdemonology (in a philological sense) is sketchy, and we found nothing[ 100 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 100"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESthat answered our specific questions about the Malleussatisfactorily.For example, Sigrid Brauner offers a brief discussion of the use ofmaleficusand maleficain the Malleus, but her assertion that Institorisand Sprenger ‘use the male plural form maleficifor sorcerers in generalbut reserve the female form maleficafor the modern witch’ is mis-taken.20In 1.1, Institoris and Sprenger refer to ‘moderni malefici’specifically: ‘Tertium etiam sane intelligere expedit cum moderni mal-efici sepius ope demonum transformantur in lupos et alias bestias.’ (Andthird, it is indeed useful to understand how modern [contemporary]witches [male; and possibly female, according to convention] are oftentransformed by the power of a demon into wolves and other beasts.)21Our approach to this problem was fairly simple: we counted thenumber of times the authors used masculine and feminine terms forwitches. Our aim in tabulating this information about linguistic gen-dering is to challenge Clark’s notion that early modern witchcraft theo-rists were incapable of imagining that witches could be male, on thegrounds that language choices are not accidental and that early modernauthors must have meant to use both masculine and feminine terms. Ifthey were capable of representing witches as male, it follows that theywere also capable of conceptualising male witches – otherwise, their lan-guage would make no sense.For this purpose, an extensive survey of the very large corpus ofwitchcraft literature is unnecessary. A small sample of major texts is suf-ficient to show that witchcraft theorists had no difficulty representingwitches as male. The texts were selected partly on the basis of availabil-ity in original-language editions, but also for their status as well-knowntreatises with which most historians will have some familiarity. There isa certain degree of uniformity, in that nine of the texts are ‘pro’ witch-hunting, the exception being Friedrich Spee’s Cautio criminalis.Early modern terminology for magic and magic-users varied con-siderably, even within elite discourse. The terms maleficusand maleficawere quite common, but so were the terms saga,sortilegus, and venefi-cus, to list only a few. The sample texts employ several different terms.[ 101 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 101"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEIn our tabulation, we were most interested in parallel forms, such asmaleficus/maleficaand sorcier/sorcière, but we have also enumeratedother terms so as to give a reasonable indication of the relative frequencyof references to male and female witches. In general, words that appearonly once or twice, or have a specialist meaning, such as necromanticusor pythonissa, have not been included in the tabulation.The Formicarius,Malleus maleficarum,De laniis, and Flagellumhaereticorumuse maleficusand maleficaalmost exclusively.

In the Tractatus, Binsfeldprefers maleficus and saga(30), but also uses malefica(17). Rémy’sDaemonolatreiauses sortilegus(24) and saga(34) most often for maleand female witches respectively, but also maleficus(6) and malefica(5),and refers to a sortilegaonce. Bodin and de Lancre employ sorcierandsorcière. In Cautio criminalis, Spee uses maleficusfor male witches andsagafor female witches. The figures given represent the sum totals ofboth plural and singular forms.Where possible, we have used first editions of these treatises, asindicated in the endnotes to the table; however, first editions have notalways been available, which raises the issue of textual stability. AsAdrian Johns has argued, contra Elizabeth Eisenstein, early modernprinted texts were not inherently stable, and the fixity of print in theperiod has been much exaggerated.22There is no reason to assume thatdemonological treatises were any less susceptible to piracy and printers’errors or emendations than, say, Galileo’s Sidereus nuncius, whose latereditions featured corrupted images.23Indeed, comparisons of two editions of the Formicarius24andtwenty-one copies (sixteen different editions) of the Malleus malefi-carum25reveal that demonological treatises were not completely stabletexts. For example, the first lines of both treatises contain textual vari-ants. In the 1480 edition of the Formicarius, book 5 begins: ‘Ultimo locoper libellum quintum sub formicarum proprietatibus de maleficis &[ 102 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 102"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESeorum decepcionibus concludere restat’.26The same line of the 1669edition reads: ‘Nuncper libellum quintum sub formicarum proprietat-ibus de maleficis & eorum deceptionibus agere placet.’27The first lineof the 1487 Malleus maleficarumreads: ‘Utrum asserere maleficos essesit a deo catholicum quod eius oppositum pertinaciter defendereomnino sit hereticum.’28In several later editions, the word defendereisreplaced by either asserereor offendere.29This textual variation suggests a need for caution when assessingthe reception of demonological works. Different editions were highlyunlikely to be identical. Historians of witchcraft need to develop anawareness of this instability. Certain variations call into question broadassertions about the reception of the Malleusand other texts: forinstance, despite some claims to the contrary, not every edition of theMalleusincluded a copy of the papal bull Summis desiderantes.30Onthe other hand, the gendered terminology of the FormicariusandMalleusis remarkably stable. We have detected only one variant, whichis found in the Formicarius. In book 5, chapter 3, the 1669 editionhas maleficarumwhere the 1480 edition has maleficorum.31Granted,our variants search has been limited; however, we are reasonably con-fident that this particular feature of demonological treatises was notaffected significantly by textual instability, and that the textual (gram-matical) gendering of witches was consistent during the early modernperiod.Counting words may seem to be a strange way of uncovering tex-tual meaning. We are more accustomed to what we might think of asqualitative approaches to language, in which we puzzle over the mean-ings and intentions of specific language choices; we do not usually quan-tify those choices. In this case, however, quantification provides a meansof introducing some methodological rigour to the discussion of genderand witchcraft. Given the hegemonic status of conventional readings ofdemonology, it would be extremely difficult to make the case for theinclusion of male witches as significant subjects without some kind ofhard data.[ 103 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 103"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEThe data presented in table 2 are not meant to establish defini-tively the universal patterns of gendered language usage in earlymodern demonology.

Abstract referencesconcern the characteristics and abilities of witches as a ‘species’. Forexample, in the first chapter of book 5 of the Formicarius, the Pigerasks the Theologian (‘Theologus’; the Formicariusis written as a dia-logue between these two speakers) about witches and their relation-ship with demons: ‘Desidero igitur noscere Primo quot modis &qualiter malefici & supersticiosi sibique similes reguntur equitantur &dementantur per demones.’42(I desire therefore to know, first, in how[ 104 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 104"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESmany ways and by what right witches and the superstitious and thoselike them are ruled, ridden and driven mad by demons.) Abstract ref-erences are ordinarily plural, and very often masculine. Nider, forinstance, always uses the masculine when referring to witches in theabstract. Some abstract references are singular, and are masculine orfeminine depending on the author and context. In the Malleus malefi-carum, singular abstract references are usually feminine, but the sec-tion concerning whether the Devil and witch must cooperate in orderto perform maleficiumbegins: ‘An catholicum sit asserere quod adeffectum maleficialem semper habeat demon cum malefico concurrerevel quod vnus sine altero vt demon sine malefico vel econuerso talempossit producere.’43(Whether it is orthodox to affirm that in order toachieve an act of sorcery a demon must always work together with awitch, or that one without the other, for instance a demon without awitch or vice versa, is able to produce such an act.) In this passage,the abstract witch is referred to in the masculine ablative singular formmalefico.Concrete references describe actual witches, usually in connec-tion with a trial. Concrete references are either masculine or feminine,singular or plural, depending on the context. Early modern authorsnever, to our knowledge, confuse the gender of their concrete refer-ences. Whether a woman or a man is the subject of discussion, theterm used to describe that individual always agrees in grammaticalgender with their biological sex. We have found no instance of a par-ticular male witch described in grammatically feminine terms, or viceversa.It is important to distinguish between abstract and concrete lan-guage because such references have different, but related, heuristicvalues. Abstract references suggest the degree to which early modernwitchcraft theorists conceptualised witches as inherently gendered. Itis an imperfect measure of such conceptualisation: abstract masculinereferences were in all likelihood meant to include females, and in anycase grammatical gender cannot always be read as indicative of ‘actual’[ 105 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 105"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEgender. For example, several masculine Latin nouns with feminine end-ings – agricola,nauta, and poeta, to list a few – refer to traditionallymasculine occupations. On the other hand, the fact that different formsexisted for witches suggests that the use of a masculine noun, such asmaleficus, was not purely a matter of grammatical convention.Conceptual flexibility was built into the languages of early modernwitchcraft theory.The texts do provide clues as to how their authors were using lan-guage. In the Formicarius, Nider uses the masculine plural maleficiunless referring specifically to female witches. His statement that Peterof Como burned many witches of both sexes (‘multos vtriusque sexusincineravit maleficos’) suggests that such usage is inclusive of men andwomen.44Here,maleficosclearly means both men and women. Thisis actually a concrete reference, but it is reasonable to assume that his abstract references are also inclusive, since he devotes a later chapter to the special wickedness of women. Nider does not say‘maleficos et maleficas’; presumably, this would have been consideredredundant.For the most part, Jean Bodin follows Nider’s pattern. He uses mas-culine plurals and singulars unless female witches are the specific sub-ject of reference. For instance, Bodin begins his first chapter: ‘Sorcierest celuy qui par moyens Diaboliques sciemment s’efforce de paruenira quelque chose.’45(A witch is one who knowingly tries to do somethingby diabolical means.) This use of the masculine singular in a chapterdevoted to defining what a witch is constructs the witch as male, notfemale – at least in a linguistic sense. Similarly, Pierre de Lancre beginshis Tableau de L’Inconstancewith a chapter on the inconstancy ofdemons, in which (abstract) witches are referred to in the masculine. Hesays, for instance, that ‘A la vérité les Démons ont quelque certainelégèreté, laquelle fait qu’ils peuvent aisément et en un moment surnageret enfoncer, et en communiquer les moyens aux Sorciers non pas quede la on doive tirer une preuve certaine et infailable qu’ils sontSorciers.’46(In truth, demons have a certain inconstancy, which makes[ 106 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 106"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESthem able easily and in a moment to float and to sink, and to communi-cate the means of doing so to witches, not that one should draw fromthis certain and infallible proof that they are witches [i.e. in a swimmingtest].)The linguistic patterns of the Malleus maleficarumare far morecomplex than in the works of Nider, Bodin and de Lancre. Institoris andSprenger begin with masculine references, but gradually switch to analmost exclusive use of feminine forms for abstract discussions. This lin-guistic transformation is not smooth. Institoris and Sprenger explainthat the heresy of witches ought to be described in feminine, not mas-culine terms, because most witches are women: ‘Plura hic deduci pos-sent sed intelligentibus satis apparet non mirum quod pluresreperiuntur infecti heresi maleficorum mulieres quam viri. Unde et con-sequenter heresis dicenda est non maleficorum sed maleficarum vt apotiori fiat denominatio.’47Nevertheless, they do not always apply thisrule consistently. At the end of Part I, while explaining that the sins ofwitches exceed the sins of Adam and Eve, the text switches several timesfrom maleficorumto maleficarum. In Part III, which deals with the prac-ticalities of witch trials, a discussion about witnesses includes the state-ment ‘Item sicut hereticus contra hereticum ad testificandumadmittitur, ita maleficus contra maleficum.’48(Likewise, just as a hereticis permitted to testify against a heretic, so a [male] witch may testifyagainst a [male] witch.)The use of masculine references in abstract discussions of witcheswas probably not intended to suggest that most witches were male, espe-cially in texts such as the Formicarius,Malleus maleficarum, andTableau de L’Inconstance, which included sections explaining whywomen were especially attracted to witchcraft. However, it does indicatea readiness to represent witches as male without any need to justify orquestion such representations.Concrete references to male witches reinforce this impression of aflexible linguistic and conceptual framework. We saw in chapter 2 thataccusers and officials demonstrated no sense of cognitive dissonance[ 107 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 107"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEwhen confronted with male witches. Likewise, the authors of the fourtreatises discussed here show no signs of confusion or need to explainthe existence of male witches, despite their views that witches were pre-dominantly female.In the Formicarius,Malleus maleficarum,Demonomanie, andTableau de L’Inconstance, at least one individual male witch is describedat length, often recurring in the text as a kind of forensic exhibit. In theFormicariusand Malleus, this witch is Staedelin (or Stedelein), the‘grandis maleficus’ of Poltingen;49in the Demonomanie, Trois-eschellesappears several times (Staedelin also makes an appearance); and deLancre devotes several pages to a discussion of Isaac de Queyran.50There are many other references to male witches. Bodin, for instance,discusses various famous, learned witches, including CorneliusAgrippa, Pietro d’Abano and Guillaume de Line.51In the Malleusmaleficarum, Institoris and Sprenger include a section concerning threetypes of witchcraft that onlymen practice.52What is so striking about these passages describing male witchesis that, again, the authors make no effort to justify using the termsmaleficusor sorcier. Clearly, male witches were not considered by theseauthors to belong to a fundamentally different category of evil-doerfrom female witches; regardless of sex, they were all witches first andforemost.ImagesImages of witches provide additional evidence for the capacity of earlymodern Europeans to conceive of male witches. Demonological trea-tises were rarely illustrated,53but some of those that were offer furtherproof that witches were not believed to be exclusively or necessarilyfemale. Most early modern images of witches, for instance the famousdrawings and paintings of Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung Grien,depict female witches. There are, however, a number of images fromdemonological tracts that depict male witches.[ 108 ]chapter4 21/12/04 12:17 pm Page 108"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF MALE WITCHESThe first examples are contained in Ulrich Molitor’s De laniis etphitonicis mulieribus, which was first published at Constance in1488.54Although the work’s title refers specifically to women, two ofthe six woodcut illustrations are of male witches.

The (female) gender link in visual representations ofwitchcraft was strong in the early modern period, as evidenced by thefact that the majority of images depicted witches as women; however,this link could not have been absolute.

First, Stuart Clark’s statement that demonologi-cal theory about gender and witchcraft did not conform to the patternsof prosecution appears somewhat too broad. One could argue thatalthough patterns of language usage do not conform precisely to pat-terns of prosecution, they do reflect them, in that both generally includea minority and, at times, a majority, of men. There is, thus, no wide gapbetween demonological theory and actual prosecutions.Second, views of early modern demonology as sex-specific, exem-plified by Sigrid Brauner’s assertion that ‘by 1500, the sex-specificity ofwitches was so widely accepted that it was implicitly assumed in textsabout witches’61and Stuart Clark’s remark that it was literally unthink-able that witches should be male, are clearly overdrawn. Witchcraft the-orists may have taken it for granted that witches were mostly female, butthey did not treat witchcraft as sex-specific. One can interpret earlymodern witchcraft theory as sex-specific only by ignoring a consider-able body of evidence to the contrary.Notes1 Trevor-Roper,The European Witch-Craze, 78–79.2 E.g.

In this final chapter, we wish to change gear andattempt to answer the question of how early modern Europeans, specif-ically witchcraft theorists, made sense of male witches. Given that theygenerally associated witchcraft more strongly with women than withmen, it seems at first rather odd that early modern authors did notaddress explicitly the (to us) apparent anomaly of the male witch.However, as we have suggested so far, the nonchalance with which earlymodern Europeans approached the concept of the male witch suggestshis existence was taken for granted. Although it is somewhat problem-atic to approach the question this way, asking why early modern witch-craft theorists did not regard male witches as anomalous – in otherwords, why there was no conceptual barrier to them – provides a usefulstarting point for developing an integrative interpretation of the gen-dering of witchcraft.In this chapter, we argue, first, that early modern theorists wereunperturbed by male witches because they were already familiar withthem in the guise of ancient and medieval heretics and sorcerers. Oursecond, more speculative, argument concerns the feminisation of thewitch. The most essential feature of the early modern witch (as under-stood under the ‘elaborated concept’ of witchcraft) was her or his sub-servient relationship with the Devil, who duped men and especiallywomen into worshipping him. The witch was thus by definition weak-minded, a trait that had been associated from antiquity withchapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 118"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTwomen. A man accused of being a witch was also, therefore, implic-itly feminised. In one sense, this feminisation lends support to StuartClark’s argument for a binary structure underlying the gendering ofwitchcraft; on the other hand, it cautions us against allowing thatbinary structure to become too rigid to accommodate flexible genderconstructions.1Ancient and medieval antecedentsWhat did medieval and early modern Europeans think about witches?There was a vast array of ideas, many of them indeed drawn from pre-Christian sources. Their origins can be suspected in ancient magic,love-spells, and the cults of various gods and goddesses; in the religiousand magical practices of pre-Christian Europeans of the most variedethnicities (Celts, Teutons, Slavs, Basques, Etruscans, Latins, Greeks,etc.); in European folklore, perhaps also dating from pre-Christiantimes, about spirits, fairies, goblins, demons, banshees, imps, elves,kobolds, and spirits in animal form; in shamanistic ideas and practicessuch as those of the benandanti,2which seem to arise from the deep pastof some common or widely diffused Eurasian heritage; in particularScriptural passages that seemto refer to what Europeans think of and werefer to in English as witches or sorcerers (‘Thou shalt not suffer a witchto live’,3Exodus 22, 17–18).Edward Peters has argued that the classic early modern witch ‘wasa distinct type’ that should not be confused with earlier types of magic-user.4However, historians of witchcraft and witch-beliefs, includingPeters, agree generally that the night-flying witch who made a pact withthe Devil and worshipped him in exchange for supernatural powers wasa learned, cumulative construct that developed over centuries ofChristian demonisation of heretics and sorcerers. If we trace these twoelements in the witch’s heritage, we see that early modern authors wouldhave been thoroughly familiar with the idea that both men and womencould be Devil-worshippers and magicians.

The Sabbath myth and its components haveoccupied the attention of many scholars,who have attempted to demon-strate, variously, either elite or folk origins.5The debate over originsneed not concern us here; what is important, for the present purpose, isthat learned ideas about the witches’ Sabbath correspond very closelyto traditional stereotypes concerning heretics.Norman Cohn has argued that the early modern notion of theSabbath evolved from much older fantasies about various dissentinggroups. Early Christian apologists encountered widespread beliefs that10Male and female witches dining at the witches’ Sabbath.chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 120"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTChristians engaged in cannibalism, infanticide and incest;6Jews wereridiculed in the ancient world for supposedly worshipping a donkey-god;7and the Catiline conspirators were believed by Dio Cassius tohave practised ritual murder.8Christianity survived such accusations,of course, but over the centuries,tales of erotic debauches, infanticide and cannibalism wererevived and applied to various religious outgroups in medievalChristendom. In the process they were integrated more and morefirmly into the corpus of Christian demonology. ... the powers ofdarkness loomed larger and larger in these tales, until they cameto occupy the very centre of the stage. Erotic debauches, infanti-cide and cannibalism gradually took on a new meaning, as somany manifestations of a religious cult of Satan, so many expres-sions of Devil-worship.9Montanists, Paulicians, Bogomils, Waldensians, Cathars, and othergroups were all believed by Catholic authorities to engage in thesepractices.10When early modern authors described the activities of witches,they incorporated these stereotypical charges against heretics. JohannesNider, for instance, explained that in Lausanne certain witches cookedand ate infants,11and Guazzo wrote that at their gatherings witches‘sing in honour of the Devil the most obscene songs ... and then in thefoulest manner they copulate with their demon lovers.’12Given that somany of the early witchcraft theorists were inquisitors ( Jacquier, Nider,Institoris, and Nicolas Eymeric, to name a few), their incorporation ofthese elements is not surprising. Inquisitors would, presumably, havebeen familiar with these alleged activities of heretics, and, since witcheswere Devil-worshippers, it makes sense that they would believe them toengage in similar practices.The important thing about the similarity between witches andheretics is that, as William Monter has pointed out, ‘heresy itself was not sex-linked’.13Both men and women participated in heretical[ 121 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 121"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEmovements, and both men and women were thought to participate inthe traditional depravities. Therefore, theorists who believed thatwitches practised similar evil acts would have had no reason for sur-prise at the notion that men took part, despite their view that womenwere especially susceptible. In short, there were precedents for the par-ticipation of men in Devil-worship.Monter made a similar connection in his 1976 study of the Juraregion in the fifteenth century, where the authorities in three dioceses –Geneva, Lausanne and Sion – prosecuted more male than femalewitches. Monter found that these exceptions ‘to the fifteenth-centurytrend to equate witchcraft with women’ were also those dioceses ‘whichfirst popularly identified sorcery with heresy’, specifically, withWaldensianism. He suggests that because heresy was not sex-linked, ‘ina region where heresy and witchcraft were closely connected in the pop-ular mind, witchcraft was not originally sex-linked either.’14The corol-lary of Monter’s argument is that in regions where heresy and witchcraftwere notclosely connected, witchcraft was sex-linked.15Although wehave reservations about Monter’s causal correlations, his evidence sug-gests that a conceptual link between witches and heretics could havekept the door open, as it were, for male witches.Early modern witchcraft theorists incorporated stereotypes aboutheretics into their beliefs about witches, but they rarely discussed par-ticular heretics as simple heretics (that is, without the suggestion thatthey were also sorcerers). Demonological texts are chock-full of refer-ences to famous magic-users from classical, biblical, and secularsources. Such references were usually included to support the authors’views concerning witches’ powers. For instance, when Institoris andSprenger argue that witches have the power to transform men into ani-mals, they cite the example of Circe, the sorceress who transformedOdysseus’ companions into swine.16Many of these references describemale magic-users, who seem to have been in abundant supply in theancient and medieval world.

In addition,the consistent presence of male magic-users over such a long periodindicates a wider degree of acceptance of the notion that access to mag-ical power was not limited to women.The evidence of Greek and Latin curse tablets indicates that thepractice of magic was widespread and that men participated in it in largenumbers. In a recent essay, Daniel Ogden states that over 1,600 cursetablets, or defixiones, are currently known to scholars.17These tablets,which were usually made of lead, bore written curses of various kinds,regarding litigation, politics, competition, trade, erotic matters, andprayers for justice.18They have been found in Britain and in everycountry around the Mediterranean, and date from the early fifth or evensixth century BCE to the eighth century CE.19Ogden suggests that ‘many curse tablets were probably made, acti-vated and deposited by amateurs on an ad hoc basis.’20Specialists mayhave assisted in the manufacturing of tablets, for instance by inscribinga curse text, but, as Ogden points out, these specialists were not neces-sarily magicians. On the other hand, long and complex curse textsrequiring magical formulae must have depended on magical hand-books.21In addition, ‘since obscurity and difficulty were importantsources of “power” for ancient magic, it may have been more satisfyingto visit a professional, one of supposedly arcane knowledge and myste-rious skills, for the text of a tablet’.22Whether or not the author of a curse tablet was a professional, ‘thevast majority of all curse tablets, including erotic ones, [were] written bymen.’ Furthermore, Ogden cautions, ‘it is possible that some of the cursetablets contain the actual words of women, but we must remember thatthey are largely formulaic, and we can never be sure that even an appar-ently personally worded text was not composed with the aid of or simplyby a male (professional or otherwise).’23Although this evidence doesnot necessarily show that men were more active participants in magicthan women, it indicates clearly that men were ‘everyday’ magic-users.Similarly, the sexual spells contained in a collection of early Christian[ 123 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 123"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPECoptic texts suggest that men used magic; several of the spells aredesigned to cause a woman to love a man, and one is an erotic spell fora man to obtain a male lover.24As both Daniel Ogden and Fritz Graf have pointed out, the evi-dence of curse tablets and magical papyri does not match up with liter-ary representations of magic as a female activity: ‘In Theocritus as wellas Virgil, or in the elegiac poets, and generally in the great majority ofthe literary texts, it is women who practice magic, whether erotic or ofanother kind. This situation amounts to an astonishing reversal of whatwe find in the epigraphic texts and the [magical] recipes on thepapyri.’25We shall return to this important point later in the chapter. Fornow, we wish merely to note that this evidence demonstrates that the lit-erary emphasis on female practitioners of magic does not tell the wholestory about magic use in the ancient world.Considering this overemphasis on women in ancient literary texts,which are far more likely to have been known to early modern authorsthan curse tablets, it is all the more striking to find Jean Bodin citingmany ancient examples of malemagic-users. In his preface to De lademonomanie des sorciers, Bodin lists, as sorciers, Orpheus, Aristeas theProconnesian, Cleomedes the Astypalian, Hermotimus of Clazomenae,Apollonius of Tyana, and Romulus.26None of these ancient sorcierscorresponds very closely to the early modern witch, but Bodin evidentlybelieved that they were of the same breed. He mentions them in orderto counter the arguments of sceptics, and refers to Orpheus as a ‘maistreSorcier’.27Biblical texts, including the Acts of the Apostles, furnished addi-tional examples of male magic-users. The female Witch of Endor wascited very frequently in demonological texts, but so were the Pharaoh’smagicians and Simon Magus. Ulrich Molitor, for instance, discussesSimon Magus at some length in De laniis. In a section dealing withwhether maleficiand strigaecould transform men into animals with theaid of the Devil, Molitor describes Simon’s deception of the EmperorNero: ‘Sic symon magus perstrinxit oculos neronis & carnifices qui[ 124 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 124"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTdecollando arietem. credidit se symonem decollasse. in oculis suis min-isterio dyaboli perstrictis deceptus.’28Nero’s executioners beheaded aram, but because Simon, with the aid of the Devil, ‘bound’ theEmperor’s eyes, Nero believed that Simon had been beheaded.In addition to the various ancient literary sources at early modernauthors’ disposal, medieval sources and society provided many exam-ples of male magic-users. Valerie Flint and Richard Kieckhefer have bothargued that magic was widespread in medieval Europe, despite officialprohibitions against it. Of the early medieval period, Flint says that it ‘wasremarkably well supplied with influential and respected harioli, aus-pices, sortilegi, and incantatores’;29in the later medieval centuries,Kieckhefer says, ‘we find various types of people involved in diverse mag-ical activities.’30These people and their activities are described in a rangeof medieval sources. For example, Isidore of Seville’s Etymologiaepro-vided an encyclopedic summary of magic-users and their special powers.His work was incorporated in later tracts against magic, including thoseby Rabanus Maurus and Burchard of Worms, who wrote in the ninth andearly eleventh centuries, respectively.31Specific references to male magic-users are not difficult to find. Inhis The History of the Franks, Gregory of Tours describes a man namedDesiderius, who, Gregory says, ‘practised the foul arts of necromancy’.Another man, who claimed to possess holy relics, turned out to own ‘abig bag filled with the roots of various plants; in it, too, were moles’teeth, the bones of mice, bears’ claws and bear’s fat’, which the BishopRagnemod ‘recognised ... as witchcraft’.32Gervais of Tilbury wrote inhis Otia Imperialia(c. 1215) about an English magician at the court ofRoger II of Sicily; this magician found the burial place of Virgil,unearthed the poet’s bones, and took his book of magic.33Other male figures appear in accounts of prosecutions for magicuse. In the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, many of these menwere ritual magicians or necromancers.Early in the fourteenth century,three men – Bernard Délicieux (1319) and Matteo and GaleazzoVisconti (1320) – were tried for using necromancy against Pope John[ 125 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 125"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEXXII.34At the court of Charles VI of France, at least four men werecharged with practising sorcery after claiming to be able to cure theking’s illness with magic. The second of the four men, Jehan de Bar, con-fessed to invoking demons, engaging in Devil-worship and practisingritual magic. He was condemned and burned in 1398.35In 1403, twomen, named Poinson and Briquet, presented themselves to the king‘with the pretense of being able to discover the cause of the king’s dis-ease’. They set themselves up in the woods outside the town gate, wherethey built a magical circle of iron and made ‘magical invocations, whichapparently produced no results whatsoever’. Both men were arrestedand later burned.36Books of magic, such as the Munich handbook, offer further evi-dence that magic was both widespread and practised by men.37Ritualdemonic magic of the kind found in such books was a masculine pre-serve; more specifically, it seems to have been the specialty of a ‘clericalunderworld’. Richard Kieckhefer asserts that necromancy ‘was not aperipheral phenomenon in late medieval society and culture’, and thatfears concerning such magic were ‘grounded in realistic awareness thatnecromancy was in fact being practised, and in an almost universallyshared conviction that it could work’.38If this was indeed the case, then it helps explain why, despite theirgeneral understanding that women were more prone than men to witch-craft, early modern authors never claimed that witchcraft was whollysex-specific. Witchcraft theorists and their readers, especially in the fif-teenth century, were not only the heirs of a long intellectual and culturalheritage that recognised the existence of male magic-users. They werealso likely to have been familiar with necromancy and to have knownthat its practitioners were men. It would have been difficult, to say theleast, to construct the argument that men could not be witches, since evi-dence to the contrary was all around.Having said that, one is forced to ask why witchcraft theorists per-sisted in stating that women had a greater natural propensity to witch-craft than men did. The situation in the early modern period is[ 126 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 126"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTanalogous to that of the Greek and Roman worlds; as we have seen,ancient authors represented magic as something practised by women,despite the fact that men also practised magic. Early modern authors didnot, as we have argued in chapter 4, exclude male practitioners fromtheir discussions; however, explicit statements such as Pierre deLancre’s comment that ‘la femme a plus d’inclination naturelle à la sor-cellerie que l’homme. C’est pourquoi il y a plus de femmes Sorcièresque d’hommes’ (woman has a greater natural inclination to witchcraftthan man. That is why there are more female witches than male) repre-sented witchcraft as a predominantly female activity.39The fact thatwitchcraft theorists could hold this view and, at the same time, discussmale witches in their texts, suggests that the gendering of witchcraft wasa complex affair.Gendering witchcraftIn the previous section, we attempted to demonstrate that the lack of aconceptual barrier to the idea of male witches can be explained in partby witchcraft theorists’ familiarity with various ancient and medievalprototypes. In this final section, we shall address the question of what itmeant, in conceptual terms, to label a man as a witch within a frameworkthat both explicitly and implicitly feminised witchcraft.On one level, the feminisation of witchcraft is obvious. The claimsof Nider, Institoris and Sprenger, and de Lancre, among others, thatwitchcraft was practised mostly by women identified it clearly as afemale activity. Did this mean that men who practised witchcraft wereregarded as feminine? Not really – or not in any overtly sexedway. Malewitches were not depicted explicitly as feminine; however, they wereassociated with certain traits that feminised them implicitly.Fritz Graf ’s explanation of the ‘mismatch’ between ancient liter-ary representations of magic and the reality of magical practice sug-gests one avenue of exploration. He argues that magic, especially eroticmagic, was a ‘secret weapon’ in male social competition, a weapon that[ 127 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 127"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEwas ‘unworthy of the ideal warrior of the world of men’.40Men whoused magic stepped ‘over the borderlines of male behavior’, because‘a true man does not need ... magic – the only male sorcerers are thosefunny foreign specialists.’41If we adopt Graf ’s interpretation of ancientmen’s attitudes toward male magic use, we can read early modern state-ments about the predominance of female witches as implicit warningsto male readers that practising magic was womanish behaviour. Thisis an intriguing line of thought, and suggests a depth to fears aboutwitches that goes beyond what other scholars have had to say on thesubject. Early modern anxieties concerning (female) witches’ powersto interfere with men’s minds and bodies, and especially with theirprocreative abilities, have been addressed by various scholars; but theidea that authors of demonological treatises may have been, on somelevel, trying to dissuade men in particular from becoming witches hasnot been explored.Unfortunately, early modern authors do not come straight out andmake convenient statements about ‘real’ men not needing witchcraft.They do not even attempt to portray male witches as effeminate in anyobvious sense. The male witches described in demonological texts arenot homosexual;42indeed, even their demon lovers are female.43Theyare not described as wearing women’s clothing, working in women’soccupations, or having feminine habits. So far, the idea that malewitches were feminised looks like a red herring. However, this is the caseonly if one seeks nothing but examples of overt feminisation that corre-spond to modern views on masculinity and femininity. When webroaden our perspective to accommodate earlier concepts and less overtmeans of feminising men, we find several clues.For instance, there are tantalising hints that some male witches mayhave had certain physical attributes associated with women. In her bookThe Color of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imagination,Constance Classen explores the embodiment of gender codes and hier-archies through the senses.44According to Classen, ‘along with beingassigned different sensory qualities’, such as ‘hot’ or ‘cold’, ‘men and[ 128 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 128"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTwomen were associated with different sensory domains.’ At a funda-mental level, women were associated with the physical body and thesenses, while men were associated with the mind and soul.45Furthergendered distinctions operated within the domain of the senses. ‘Eachsense was considered to have superior and inferior uses’, which wereassigned to men and women respectively, but different values were alsoimparted to each of the senses. ‘Sight and hearing were held to be moreclosely associated with the “higher” functions of the mind, and the othersenses with the “lower” functions of the body.’46Two of these associations are of particular interest. Smell, a ‘lower’sense, was associated with women, who were ‘held to be especially pro-ductive of odors’, both good and bad.47Sight, on the other hand, was a‘higher’ sense associated with men because the eyes and the male sexualorgans were thought to share a ‘seminal nature’. According to Classen,‘women, who were symbolically castrated or incomplete men, could beimagined as exhibiting the weak sight and intelligence attributed toeunuchs.’48With these associations in mind, the physical descriptions of Trois-eschelles and Staedelin, two male witches, take on new significance.Trois-eschelles, who appears several times in Bodin’s Demonomanie,was hanged at Paris in 1571 after denouncing over 150 others aswitches.49He was supposed to have received immunity, but seems tohave angered the king while giving a ‘command performance’ of hispowers, and was condemned after all.50Apparently, Trois-eschelles wasblind; Bodin refers to him once as ‘l’aueugle’, or ‘the blind one’,51another time as ‘l’aueugle Sorcier’, the blind witch.52Staedelin, the‘grandis maleficus’ of the Formicariusand subsequent works, wasimmortalised by Johannes Nider in several descriptive passages. In one,Nider tells the reader that when Staedelin was arrested, he gave off agreat stench: ‘cum sepe dictus iudex petrus antefatum scadelem[Staedelin] capere vellet per suos famulos tantus tremor manibus eorumincussus est & corporibus & naribus illapsus tam malus fetor vt se feredesperarent an maleficum inuadere auderent.’ (When the said judge[ 129 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 129"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEPeter wished his servants to arrest the aforementioned Staedelin, theirlimbs and bodies were seized by such trembling, and their nostrilsassailed by such a great stench, that they doubted whether they woulddare to grab the witch.)53Admittedly, these are only two instances of male witches possess-ing what Bodin and Nider may or may not have thought were feminineattributes.54As evidence of the gendering of witchcraft, this is tooscanty to permit one to draw solid conclusions. On the other hand, it isnot entirely implausible, in our view, that early modern authors and theirreaders may have regarded such traits as signs that male witches were,if not overtly feminine, at least not unquestionably masculine. In anycase, the question of how early modern Europeans perceived the bodyof the male witch ought to be explored. According to Lyndal Roper,How a culture imagines the body is one of its most fundamentaland revealing elements ... Theories of the body, whether explicitor implicit, may assume a sharp division between the body andthe mind, or they may articulate a profound interconnectionbetween what is mental, physical and spiritual. Among the issueswhich cluster around concepts of the body are questions of indi-viduation, how we define the boundaries of a person and his orher bonds with other people, living or dead; the causal linksbetween illness or other kinds of physical harm and psychic, emo-tional or spiritual powers; and the nature of what we might call a‘person’ and his or her relation with the divine.55The body of the witch, a person who crosses many boundaries, includ-ing that between the physical and spiritual realms, is a critical site forexamining early modern culture. There are some studies that deal withthe body of the witch, but they focus on female witches only.56A seri-ous study of the early modern perceptions of the body of the male witchwould add to our understanding not only of witch-beliefs, but also ofthe ways in which the relationships described by Lyndal Roper wereconstructed.57[ 130 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 130"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTThere is one element of the gendering of witchcraft that may betackled with more confidence. When explaining the reasons forwomen’s greater susceptibility to becoming witches, both sceptics58and believers in witchcraft attributed it first and foremost to women’sintellectual fragility. The misogyny of learned witch-beliefs has beenmuch reviewed by scholars, and there is no need to cover the sameground again here, except to recall Stuart Clark’s remarks that ‘the asso-ciation of witchcraft with women was ... built on entirely unoriginalfoundations’: Aristotelian physiology, a ‘deeply entrenched Christianhostility to women as the originators of sin’, and many commentaries bythe Church fathers and medieval writers on the faults and vices ofwomen.59Clark also points out that ‘the experts on witchcraft ... wereentirely representative of their age and culture’ in terms of their viewsabout women, and that ‘they showed little interest in exploring thegender basis of witchcraft or in using it to denigrate women.’60There are several valuable studies of demonological views ofwomen, including Clark’s own elegant and illuminating analysis of thebinary structure underlying such ideas (see chapter 1).61However, thissubset of witchcraft historiography lacks an exploration of the concep-tual relationship between male witches and the association of womenwith witchcraft. We have already touched on perceptions of the body.We shall now turn to the connection between witchcraft and weak-mindedness. The starting point for this investigation is the learned viewof women’s susceptibility to witchcraft. Discussions of why mostwitches were women are not only expressions of learned misogyny; theyare also definitions of the most essential characteristic of the earlymodern witch.In the Malleus maleficarum, Institoris and Sprenger furnish adetailed explanation for the predominance of female witches.62Thisdiscussion hinges on their association of women with mental weakness;over and over again, they explain the greater number of female witchesin terms of the intellectual feebleness of women. To begin with, womenare more credulous than men, which is why the Devil, whose chief aim[ 131 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 131"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEis to corrupt faith, prefers to approach them instead of men.63Institorisand Sprenger elaborate on this point by drawing on various authoritiesto demonstrate that women are impressionable,64intellectually child-like,65quick to abjure their faith,66excessively emotional,67have weakmemories, and lack discipline.68The statement that ‘all witchcraftcomes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable’69is notorious;however, the key to Institoris and Sprenger’s view of women’s suscep-tibility to witchcraft is reflected more accurately in the following remark:‘quod in omnibus viribus tam anime quam corporis cum sint defectu-ose non mirum si plura maleficia in eos quos emulantur fieri procurant.’(Because they are defective in all essences, as much of the mind as of thebody, it is no wonder if they endeavour to cause more misfortunes inthose whom they envy.)70Their insatiable carnal lust derives fromwomen’s fundamental weaknesses, which also form the basis of witch-craft. If women were not so weak, they would not be such inviting tar-gets for the Devil’s temptations, nor would they fall prey to them andabjure their faith, which, the authors of the Malleussay, ‘est fundamen-tum in maleficis’.71At no point do Institoris and Sprenger say that all witches arewomen, or suggest that abjuration of faith is not common to all witches,whether male or female. We can infer from their arguments that theexplanation concerning female witches is based not only on traditionalstereotypes of women, but also on a prior conceptual link betweenweakness, particularly intellectual weakness, and witchcraft. This linkconstitutes the heart of the early modern concept of the witch and of thefeminisation of witchcraft. According to the logic of Christian percep-tions of magic as demonic (the ‘elaborated concept’), witches were nec-essarily weak-minded, because they sought out the Devil, or weretricked or seduced by him, and willingly became his servants. Both menand women could be intellectually weak, and therefore both could beensnared by the Devil; however, because this sort of weakness had beenregarded since antiquity as a particularly feminine failing, witchcraft wasinevitably feminised.72[ 132 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 132"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTIn later antiquity, early Christians, confronted not only by the‘omnipresence’ of magic in the pagan world,73but also with accusationsthat they themselves practised magic, fought back. They identified thepagan deities and daimonesas the evil demons of the Bible, and char-acterised magic, which involved invoking the gods and daimones, as theworship of demons. Valerie Flint summarises the process as follows:The characterisation of ‘magic’ as the work solely of wickeddemons, and of ‘sorcerers’ and ‘magicians’ as their servants,stemmed from two convergent developments. In the first place,the concept of the ‘daimon’ changed ... In the second, ‘magia’, or‘magic’, became the chiefterm whereby the most powerful of theemerging religions described, and condemned, the supernaturalexercises of their enemies. ... [The] ‘daimon’ was translated ...into the evil demon of Judaic and Christian literature – a figurewho could never help or co-operate with man for his good, butwas instead his most bitter foe. Thus, those humans who lookedto obtain supernatural help in the older ways and through anolder or different ‘daimon’, came to be viewed by many as termi-nally deluded ... Sorcerers and magicians were then ‘demonised’by being declared subject only to the demonic forces of evil, andwere described as offering reinforcement to the most wicked ofthese forces’ designs [original italics].74There were two major consequences of this demonisation process.First, ‘early Christian writers tended to see all forms of magic, evenostensibly harmless ones, as relying on demons.’75This perception ofmagic persisted through the medieval and early modern period. Naturalphilosophy admitted two branches of magia: natural magic anddemonic magic. Both were occult, because their processes were secretand hidden from human intellect, but natural magic was not the work ofdemons. The men known as magiin Renaissance circles, such asCornelius Agrippa, Marsilio Ficino, or Pico della Mirandola, defendednatural magic, which rose in prominence as a subject of natural philos-ophy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.76[ 133 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 133"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEDemonic magic, however, did not disappear. In the Malleus malefi-carum, for instance, Institoris and Sprenger insisted that witches and theDevil must always work in conjunction.77Jean Bodin states in theDemonomaniethat ‘without the pact with Satan, even if a man had all thepowders, symbols, and incantations, he could cause neither man norbeast to die.’78In addition, the defenders of natural magic were some-times condemned as witches themselves. Both Jean Bodin and Pierre deLancre, for example, call Cornelius Agrippa a master-witch.79To thosewho believed that all magic required the assistance of demons, anyonewho engaged in it, in any form, was in fact practising Devil-worship.From a Christian perspective, the logical consequence of the asso-ciation of magic with demons and Devil-worship was that magic-userswere fools. Augustine expressed an early version of this idea in The Cityof God: What foolishness it is, then, or, rather, madness, to submit our-selves to demons, ... when by the true religion we are set free fromthose vices [anger, passivity of the soul, vanity, disquietude] inrespect of which we resemble them! ... What reason is there, ...apart from folly and miserable error, for you to humble yourself toworship a being whom you do not wish to resemble in your life?80Close to eleven centuries later, Jean Bodin explained that ‘evil spiritstricked people in ancient times, as they still do now, in two ways: oneopenly, with formal pacts, by which usually only the greatest simpletons[masculine], and womenwere snared. The other way was to deceive vir-tuous but very foolish menby idolatry, and under a veil of religion [ital-ics added].’81In his preface to De la demonomanie des sorciers,hecounters sceptical objections to the epistemological value of witches’confessions with the statement that the witches whose testimonies arein question ‘for the most part are completely ignorant people or oldwomen’.82In essence, as the Malleus maleficarumalso suggests, peoplebecome witches because of an intellectual lack or failing (as well as amoral failing).[ 134 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 134"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTIn these two passages, Bodin makes explicit a set of conceptual con-nections that more often operate only implicitly within early moderndemonology.83The first connection, witch/weakness, is a binary con-struct that, within the logical framework of Christian demonology,seems to have been necessary and indivisible. The second connection,femininity/weakness/masculinity, is an asymmetrical triad. Both menand women share the trait of weakness, but it is linked far more stronglywith women than with men.When these two sets come together in early modern ideas aboutwitches, they create a web of associations in which a person thoughtto be a witch is necessarily also thought, on some level, to be weak-minded. When that person is a woman, the associations link up inwhat we might visualise as a circle: each element – witch, weakness,woman – reinforces the other, creating, in essence, a stable system. If,however, the witch is a man, the associative dynamic is somewhat dif-ferent. There is nothing in the web of associations, or in the intellec-tual traditions and past experiences, to prevent male witches. However,because the conceptual link between women and weakness is strongerthan that between men and weakness, witches are associated morestrongly with femininity. As a result, a malewitch causes conceptual‘reverberations’ within the web that associate him not only with weak-ness, but also with femininity.84Does this feminisation of witchcraft and male witches mean thatStuart Clark is correct to argue that the early modern gendering ofwitchcraft was based on binarism? Clearly, his view that male witcheswere ‘literally unthinkable’ within early modern demonology is incor-rect. At first glance, male witches appear to flatly contradict Clark’s care-fully worked-out system of correspondences between witches andwomen; one might, therefore, be tempted to dismiss his interpretationas fatally flawed. However, there is too much evidence of binary think-ing both in early modern culture generally and in demonology in par-ticular for us to indulge in a facile rejection of Clark’s thesis.Furthermore, our examination of male witches and the way they made[ 135 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 135"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEsense to early modern witchcraft theorists offers evidence of binarism atwork on an implicit level.What it also shows, though, is that Clark’s interpretative scheme istoo rigid. Early modern witchcraft theorists did not construct an exclu-sive conceptual correspondence between witches and women; indeed,it would have made very little sense for them to do so, given their expe-rience with actual male witches. What they did construct was a web ofassociations similar in some respects to Clark’s binary framework, butnot so rigidly polarised as to prevent ‘leakage’ across the gender bound-ary. It is important to remember that although demonology feminisedmale witches, it never made them female. To put it another way, malewitches were never reconstructed in such a manner as to make themunrecognisable as males.The feminised male witch has important implications for the waywe speak of gender and its construction in early modern Europe.Andrea Cornwall and Nancy Lindisfarne have written that the portrayalof the social construction of masculinity and femininity as strictly rela-tional rests on ‘a number of questionable assumptions, among them theidea that these qualities cannot be ascribed to a single individual at thesame time’. They argue that although ‘an important aspect of manyhegemonic discourses is their focus on an absolute, naturalised and,typically, hierarchised male/female dichotomy whereby men andwomen are defined in terms of the differencesbetween them’, it is nec-essary to consider not only ‘the relation betweenmaleness and female-ness’, but also ‘how hierarchical relations between men and womenreproduce differences withinthose categories [original italics].’85Thefeminised male witch is an excellent example of the construction of dif-ference withina gender category, and forces us to rethink the binarymodel of early modern gender.The male witch also highlights the feminisation of subordinates inearly modern European culture. Witches were feared for their power,but they were also understood to be subservient to the Devil in a veryliteral sense. Bodin once again furnishes explicit statements of this idea,[ 136 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 136"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTdescribing witches as Satan’s slaves.86However, other signs of this sub-ordinate relationship were extremely common within demonologicalliterature: the anal kiss, signifying homage; the Devil’s sexual use offemale witches, often described as painful to the witch; the necroman-tic practice of making offerings to demons; the physical beatingsinflicted on disobedient witches by the Devil; and finally, the funda-mental role of the witch as the Devil’s instrument for spreading evil. Likemental weakness, this subordination to the Devil bears a strong con-ceptual association with femininity via powerlessness and passivity.87This chapter began by posing the question of how learned earlymodern Europeans made sense of male witches. On one level, theanswer is fairly simple: male witches existed, so authors of witchcrafttreatises incorporated them in their demonologies. Such a conclusion isnot very rewarding; however, probing more deeply into the conceptualassociations at work in early modern demonology uncovers a complexweb that reflects not only ideas about witches but also how learnedEuropean men constructed gender.Gender and witchcraft: popular knowledgeIn times and in places where the ‘elaborated concept’ was not the dom-inant understanding of witchcraft and magic as necessarily a result ofa pact with the Devil, all manner of traditional, ‘pre-demonological’,perhaps even ‘pre-Christian’ magic seems to have been in regular use:weather magic, either to bring about rain or to avert (or cause88) frostor hail; healing magic; the ritual battles of the male and female benan-dantiagainst the forces of evil, described by Ginzburg; spells to cureor damage livestock or crops;89harm to infants (frequently bywomen);90charms that produced impotence;91love potions;92 cursesthat crippled or killed,93and the like. Ideas about magic and its prac-tice seem to have existed well before and continued to exist in paral-lel with the elaboration of a logical, coherent Christian theory thatidentified the supernatural motive force behind all attempts at [ 137 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 137"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEwitchcraft or perceived bewitchment as the Devil – despite JeffreyBurton Russell’s argument in his book Witchcraft in the Middle Ages94that witchcraft was, throughout the Middle Ages, Devil-worship. Thatcertain Christians nourished fantasiesabout other people – Templars,heretics, Jews – worshipping the Devil is beyond question, but asBehringer has shown, the ‘elaborated concept’ of witchcraft did notprevail in the vast and disjointed European market place of ideas aboutwitchcraft until the fifteenth century. The substance and content ofcharges of witchcraft did not change much as the ‘elaborated concept’spread; in fact, in general, the local forms of magic from the pre-‘elab-orated concept’ or pre-demonological period were retained but rein-terpreted, as in the famous example of the benandanti, as the result ofdiabolical intervention or, more properly, as delusions produced by theDevil in those who served him. The benandantistudied by CarloGinzburg were, he claims, practitioners of ancient, pre-Christianshamanism, including shamanistic out-of-body travel experiences in atrance state. Although they were able to persuade the inquisitors at thebeginning of the sixteenth century that they not only battled witches(using sorghum stalks as weapons), and even managed to persuadeauthorities that they could detect victims of witchcraft, a hundred yearslater, they had been persuaded that, at least according to the inquisi-tors’ categories, they were themselves witches.95This example hasbeen used to argue that ‘the persecution of witches is an effect of theacculturation of rural areas by the religious and political elite’,96thatis, of the reinterpretationof magical lore, such as healing knowledgeand various kinds of rituals, as diabolical. In many cases, when ideasabout what witches did and who they were encountered coherent the-ories of ‘diabolical witchcraft’, individuals and institutions bothaccommodated popular discourse to learned demonology and resis-ted or modified specific aspects of the ‘elaborated concept’.The opposite was also true. Sometimes the ideas of learned eliteshad to accommodate popular belief. An early example of what wouldlater become a widespread opinion among Protestant churchmen was[ 138 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 138"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTthat of Johannes Brenz, the Reformer of the city of Schwäbisch-Hall andthe leading churchman of the Duchy of Württemberg (in south-westernGermany). Brenz argued, well before Johannes Weyer developed acomplete theory along these lines, that ‘misfortunes such as hailstormswere sent by God, while the witches were merely deluded by Satan intothinking they had caused them’.97This suggests that the learned elitesof Reformation Germany had reason to acknowledge that those accusedof witchcraft sometimes believed that they had in fact practised magic(whether with or without the help of the Devil).The main question regarding popular ideas about witchcraft thatpresents itself in the context of this book is to what extent such concep-tions were gendered. In Witches and Neighbors, Robin Briggs notes that‘early’ (meaning pre-sixteenth-century) images of witchcraft activitiescontained not only old women (‘hags’), but also ‘nubile young women,men and children’, and that while some confessing witches asserted thatwomen were more numerous than men at the witches’ Sabbath, ‘a fairnumber’ insisted that the sexes were equally represented, or even thatthere were more men,98suggesting that these witches were introducingwitchcraft ideas that were to some extent at odds with ‘orthodox’demonology regarding the greater susceptibility of women to theDevil’s lures.99Regarding gender, Briggs states that ‘[a]lthough no areaof magical power was totally or consistently gendered, large parts of folkmedicine and love magic tended to become feminine specialities’,100though the benandantiof the Friuli were certainly popular healers, andmost were men. Indeed, Briggs suggests that the widespread idea, espe-cially in the English-speaking world, that most or almost all witcheswere women has to do with the fact that very few men were accused orexecuted in England, and that the English demonologists were guilty ofan extreme misogyny that has called forth an equal and opposite reac-tion among many scholars. This last point is worth examining; it seemsto us that English demonologists were no more or less misogynistic, say,than the authors of the Malleus maleficarum. It is by looking beyondEngland and in leaving behind the dated ‘sociogenesis argument’ (i.e.,[ 139 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 139"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEthe notion that witches were quintessentially weak/poor/old women),which Briggs has rightly critiqued, that we can begin to understand bothlearned and popular concepts of witchcraft and their complexly gen-dered nature. In certain parts of Europe, such as sixteenth-centuryFinland, ‘the stereotype sorcerer was a man, probably due to Finnishfolk traditions and the ancient Finnish religion, in which supernaturalpowers were not associated with women but with men.’101The major-ity of those accused of witchcraft in Iceland were men, and unlike inEnglish, the generic term for witch in Icelandic was masculine.102Thegrammatical gender of a word cannot, on its own, have caused the pre-ponderance of men among those accused; although for the English-speaking world, the effects of the (implicitly) gendered word ‘witch’ onboth the popular imagination and on scholarship should not be under-estimated.The Icelandic witch trials of the seventeenth century, as in theBasque country studied by Henningsen, coincide with ‘a temporarysyncretism of the witch-beliefs of the common people with those of thespecialized or educated classes’.103Briggs and others have noted thatthe majority of accusations were produced at the local level, and moti-vated by ‘fear of witchcraft in the most direct sense.’104Here we mustlook not for a belief that old, strange, poor women were, somehow, apriori, witches, but for belief in witchcraft and local, temporally specificand quite dynamic and flexible ideas about who might be a witch,105ideas that included all manner of popular lore about medicine, healing,and especially maleficium, and which, by the sixteenth century at thelatest, were interacting with learned demonology in unpredictable andexplosive ways. It is this last point that is crucial for understanding thecomplex relationship between popular and learned ideas: they were notunrelated, but when they came into conjunction, and other external fac-tors (whether inquisitorial zeal, large-scale agrarian crises, a local cropfailure, or small-scale (perceived) damages in the village or countryside)provided the impetus, either cases of ‘low-level’ or ‘endemic’ persecu-tion or episodes of intensive or even ‘epidemic’ witch-hunting could[ 140 ]chapter5 21/12/04 9:14 am Page 140"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE GENDERING OF WITCHCRAFTensue. It is hard to say whether learned demonologists were more or lessdisposed than everyone else to think that witches were more likely to bewomen than men, since both did think this – though not exclusively.The only real answer is that it depends where, and when. The vexedquestion as to whether or not learned writers accommodated their uni-versalising demonological discourses to local conditions and ideas, orwere influenced by those ideas, in order to produce this ‘syncretism’ –or if some other, much less straightforward process of ‘influence’ wasafoot – is the core issue here, but it falls outside the scope of the presentwork and remains as a fascinating agenda for further research based onspecific historical situations.Notes1 We have borrowed this image of the procrustean binary structure fromChristopher A. Faraone,Ancient Greek Love Magic(Cambridge andLondon: Harvard University Press, 1999), ix.2 The benandantiof the Friuli were healers and ‘shamans’ who went out indreams to fight witches, they said, and to ensure the fertility of the crops;by the seventeenth century, they were being forced to confess to diaboli-cal witchcraft. See Ginzburg,Night Battles.3 The meaning of m’chashefais actually unclear; the Septuagint translatesthe word m’chashefaas ‘poisoner’. In rabbinic literature, the term isglossed as to referring to magical activities that are typically female; yet theTalmud makes it clear that these people can be men or women(Palestinian Talmud, Sanhedrin 7:19, 25d; Babylonian Talmud,Sanhedrin 67a); cf. Leviticus 20, 27, which prescribes the death penaltyfor a man or a woman who practises divination through a ghost or a famil-iar spirit. See the Hertz Chumash (The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, ed.Rabbi J.H. Hertz. London: Soncino, 1947), commentary to Exodus 22,17, p. 313, which amounts to a polemic against Christian scholars’attempts to pin the blame for witch persecution on Judaism and theHebrew Scriptures. Hertz notes that the odd wording of the injunction(such commandments are usually phrased as a direct commandment toput such a person to death) led some Jewish commentators to suggest thatit is a prohibition against using the services of a sorceress/diviner, andthereby allowing her to make a living.

Before historians thought to bother with thedoings not of, say, Metternich, but of the people in the German-speakingworld whose lives were touched and in some ways shaped byMetternich’s policies and by the ‘Congress system’ that dominatedEurope after 1815, there was little reason to worry that historians mightface the kind of ethical questions and conflicts of interest that culturalanthropologists, ethnologists, sociologists and a host of other students ofcontemporary people and cultures must confront, and in respect ofwhich they must – very properly – perform ‘ethics reviews’, obtainwaivers and clearances, allow their writing to be vetted by representativesof those studied, and remain accountable in some way to their subjects.Social historians and, more recently, historians of culture, labour, gender,women, folk medicine and the like – historians of everyday people andconclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 151"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEtheir lives – have dodged exactly the same issues confronted by those whostudy living people by insisting, rather irrelevantly, on the deadness ofhistorical subjects. They cannot, it is argued, with irrefutable butnonetheless faulty logic, sign waivers, review our descriptions of themand their motives, bring actions for libel, or defend themselves publicly.The incorrect conclusion often drawn from this line of reasoning is thathistorians have carte blanchein interpreting the traces of their subjects’lives, indeed even in speaking for them – or through them.Yet human beings who are now dead surely possessed agency andvoice just as our contemporaries do.

It is all the moreimportant, therefore, that we listen carefully to their self-understandingsand self-described motivations before we import our categories into thepast to study them. That we have a right to import our own questionsto the past is, surely, beyond reasonable question: why else do we studyhistory?

We have no objections to subtle and playful(Walter Ong1) interpellation of the materials in question with psycho-analytic or other ‘modern’ or even contemporary theories in order totease out hidden possibilities, tensions, ideas, so long as the historian’sprimary tools for understanding the past are in some clear sense congruent with that past, and so long as the historian retains a clear idea of the relationship, and probably the hierarchy, between past [ 152 ]conclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 152"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"[ 153 ]CONCLUSION AND AFTERWORDself-understandings and our attempts to understand the past usingmodels we import. Brad Gregory has argued that psychoanalytic andsimilar kinds of general theories are never useful for trying to sort outpast individuals’ motivations;2while we are a bit less sceptical, we wouldfirst want to see sources that licence some such use.Granted: germs, class loyalties and so on probably existed beforePasteur and Marx, and historians have good reasons to think about howplague spread and why, and what the dynamics of the Wat Tyler,Bundschuh or Peasants’ War were. We can as historians acknowledgetheir existence and try to study them without betraying our subjects; butwe must also be sympathetically aware of notions of miasma and estatesto make sense of what they were up to in their terms. The latter concernhas come far too short in the mainstream practice of history these lastsixty or so years.Then there are the complex cross-cutting problems presented bycultural-political agendas that need certain modernist tropes to validatetheir ascendancy. Roper’s feminist account of male–female relations ben-efits a great deal from the discovery/existence of an oppressive, patriar-chal psychosexual dynamic of sado-masochism in witch trials; in the caseof modern analyses of martyrdom, modernist views of religion benefiteven more by reducing martyrdom to psychological and perhaps evensado-masochistic aberrance. This is not to insist that those things werenever there in the past; but they are not there in the sources Roper used,nor in the ones we have used, nor in the voluminous materials on martyr-dom Brad Gregory amassed and analysed in his book Salvation at Stake.SummationWe began by posing several questions, which may be summed up, infor-mally, as ‘What are these male witches doing in these demonologicaltexts?’ and ‘Why doesn’t anyone talk about this?’ Not every single ques-tion that arises in the course of a research project can be answered, andthis volume leaves certain issues essentially untouched. We haveconclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 153"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEattempted, however, to address what we believe are the most funda-mental questions.Chapter 1 tackled the first of these, namely, why male witches are notmore common subjects in witchcraft historiography. Specialists in earlymodern witchcraft are aware that it was not sex-specific, even among themost misogynist demonologists. Modern scholars of various ideologicaland methodological leanings have excluded male witches from witch-craft historiography by either ignoring or ‘declassifying’ them. Thisexclusion betrays the unreflexive nature of much witchcraft historiogra-phy, in which political/ideological agendas (not limited to feminist schol-ars) and a priori assumptions are permitted to predetermine how earlymodern evidence is read and what conclusions are drawn from it.In the second chapter, we began the work of unpacking conven-tional wisdom about witchcraft and gender. First, we presented data,synthesised from other scholars’ archival research, that showed widevariation in the proportion of male to female witches. This data consti-tuted part of a more general criticism of the way witchcraft historians usestatistical information to mask regional diversity and present a mono-chromatic picture of witchcraft prosecution dynamics. Second, we pre-sented two case studies of male witches in Essex and Germany. Thesecase studies demonstrate that many generalisations about male witches,derived from specific regional studies, are not in fact suitable forEurope-wide application. For instance, the common generalisation thatmen were accused of witchcraft because they were related to a femalewitch, with the implication that there is a direct causal relationship,looks very shaky when examined closely in specific contexts. Thenotion that men were accused of practising different types of magic thanwomen also appears dubious, although worthy of further investigation.In short, simplistic portrayals of the relationship between gender andwitchcraft in early modern Europe do not reflect the complex anduntidy state of affairs that even the briefest overview reveals.In the third chapter, we examined issues of agency and resistancewith an eye to placing witches’ own self-understandings and motivations,[ 154 ]conclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 154"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION AND AFTERWORDas they professed them, at the centre of the debate regarding witchcraftconfessions and their retraction. Rather than looking for psychosexualmotives in witches’ confessions, we emphasised the role of soteriologicalanxiety in the confessions and retractions made under torture by bothfemale and male witches. We argued that while studies of female witcheshave an important role to play in balancing an unbalanced historicalrecord, ideas about witches and especially learned witchcraft theory, andwitch-hunting were gender-inclusive, and any scholar who purports totake witches as his or her primary subject would do well to rememberthis.In the fourth chapter, we introduced the male witch as found indemonological literature. This chapter challenged directly StuartClark’s position that male witches were conceptually impossible forearly modern witchcraft theorists. We presented data from severaldemonological texts that show early modern authors using masculineterminology to describe witches in general and speaking directly aboutmale witches. We also discussed demonological illustrations depictingmale witches. This evidence establishes conclusively that there was noconceptual barrier to male witches in any period of the witch-huntingera. We addressed the issue of textual variation, and concluded thatalthough demonological texts show signs of variation, they are stableenough to suggest that even if later readers and printers thought ofwitches as specifically female, they did not feel strongly enough aboutit to introduce changes in the original masculine terminology of theMalleus. We addressed the issue of language usage, illustrating thatconceptual flexibility was built into early modern witchcraft theory andthat the individual male witches described in the texts share many fea-tures with female witches. And finally, we briefly surveyed the litera-ture on gendered ideas about witches outside, before or beyond thehegemony of the learned ‘elaborated concept’ of witchcraft, showingthat although the evidence is slight, the common people of medievaland early modern Europe did not think that witches were necessarilywomen.[ 155 ]conclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 155"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEIn chapter 5, we addressed the question of how early modernEuropeans made sense of male witches within a conceptual frameworkthat feminised witchcraft. We argued, first, that the ancient and medievalworld provided stereotypes of the male witch. These prototypes werefound in traditional ideas about heretics and magicians, which cametogether in ideas about the Sabbath and demonic agency in magic. Oursecond argument was that the essential characteristic of the witch – thething that made a witch a witch – was weak-mindedness. This trait wasassociated with femininity, and its correlation with witches meant thatmale witches were implicitly feminised. Another set of associations,between witches and subservience, also feminised male witches. Thisfeminisation suggests that interpretations of early modern gender instrictly binary terms are too restrictive, and do not take into account pos-sibilities for shared gender attributes or hierarchical differentiationwithin genders.This book tackles some complex problems, but it is also intention-ally limited in scope. Our work on male witches does not, and cannot,explain why early modern Europeans were so eager to prosecute witches,nor does it explain the putative shift from a more or less gender-neutralconcept of witchcraft to one that was associated closely with women.Indeed, it casts doubt on the validity of the second question: if, as we haveattempted to show, male witches were in fact not considered anomalousby early modern Europeans, then we must ask ourselves whether a para-digm shift in the gendering of witchcraft actually occurred. Answeringthis question would involve exploring in more detail early modern malewitches and ancient and medieval witches (or magic-users) of both sexes.Another question we have not addressed directly is whether ideas aboutmale witches changed over the witch-hunting period. This is an issuethat requires a much wider sample of sources and freedom from the needto justify studying male witches in the first place.In the course of thinking through, researching and writing thisbook and its predecessor pieces (a number of seminar papers, a semi-nar readings packet, a Master’s thesis, a scholarly paper, etc.), we were[ 156 ]conclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 156"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION AND AFTERWORDboth asked the inevitable question, ‘So what are you working on?’. Ouranswers generally elicited precisely the reaction one could have pre-dicted given the questioner’s ideological and methodological positions.While to some, ‘studying witches’ meant ‘pursuing a [feminist] ideo-logical or scholarly agenda’, to most, it was simply ‘women’s history’.When someone once replied ‘Oh, so you’re doing women’s history’,Lara Apps responded with some irritation that it was more like ‘anti-women’s history’. While that was not and is not an accurate descriptionof our method or ideas, it turned out to be useful as a provocative ‘think-ing point’ around which to articulate some final remarks.Much of this book is devoted to constructing the male witch as avalid historical subject. This necessarily involves challenging the viewthat ‘the story of witchcraft is primarily the story of women’.3This viewis on one hand the result of the exclusion of the male witch, and onanother a primary cause of it. The female witch has become so heavilyladen with gender-political meaning that any attempt to get her to sharethe starring role at historiographical centre stage is difficult. However,for methodological, ethical and, yes, ideological reasons it is both nec-essary and desirable. As we have endeavoured to show, male witcheswere relativelysignificantfigures. Although far fewer male witches wereprosecuted than female witches, the number of male witches who wereaccused, tried, tortured and executed should not be ignored or glossedover. Male subjects are not less important or interesting as human beingsthan female subjects, and should not be treated as if they were. Yet thisis the general thrust of most current witchcraft historiography. It is inthis sense that our work is opposed to women’s history, or rather, a par-ticular type of women’s history exemplified by Anne Barstow’s bookWitchcraze. Otherwise, we regard our work as a contribution towomen’s history, or more precisely feminist history, in that we havebrought to it certain feminist theoretical approaches. Most important ofthese, of course, are the ideas that gender is socially constructed and thatit is a primary idiom of power. Without these concepts, this book couldhave offered little more than a mere enumeration of male witches.[ 157 ]conclusion 21/12/04 9:16 am Page 157"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"MALE WITCHES IN EARLY MODERN EUROPEWe have attempted to do more than that, arguing that male witcheswere not necessarily different in essence from female witches, that therewas no conceptual barrier to the idea of male witches, and that they ‘madesense’ thanks to a complex web of associations that feminised witchcraftand, by extension, male witches. We have also suggested that the malewitch provides insight into early modern ideas about witches, witchcrafttheory, constructions of gender, and the relationship between them.The male witch indicates that rigidly structured interpretations ofthe link between gender and witchcraft do not do justice to the com-plexity of early modern ideas. Neither feminist analyses based on theo-ries of patriarchy, nor Stuart Clark’s binary framework, adequatelyexplain the demonological association of witchcraft with women. Theseinterpretations do not even begin to elucidate the inclusion of malewitches within that association, because they are predicated on anassumption that male witches do not, conceptually speaking, exist. Themale witch is therefore extremely valuable as a device for unpackinginterpretations: as soon as one attempts to reconcile them with the evi-dence of witch trials and demonological texts, it becomes obvious thatthe explanatory models are constructed from the outset in such a waythat they cannot explain male witches. Like Stuart Clark’s demons, malewitches, it turns out, are surprisingly ‘good to think with’.Notes1 Walter Ong,Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1981).2 Comments on Andrew Gow’s paper ‘Witchcraft Confessions?

I have never had anything to do [with you?], neitherfor good nor for ill, at any time in my life.’ Then he answered me, ‘SirColleague, on account of the regional court [Landgericht].’ ‘I beg you,produce your witnesses.’ ‘I saw you when they held court.’ ‘Well, buthow?’ He did not know.

Then came Hopffens Else [an accused day-labourer6]. Sheclaimed to have seen me dancing in the Hauptsmoor forest.7I asked herhow she saw. She answered that she did not know.

I would rather endure what I had to.’ And then came –God in highest Heaven have mercy – the executioner, and put thethumbscrews on me, both hands bound together, so that the blood ranout at the nails and everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not usemy hands, as you can see from the writing. So I put myself in the care ofGod in his five sacred wounds8and said, because this concerns God’shonour and name, which I have never denied, therefore I will commendmy innocence and all the tortures and harm to his five wounds and hewill lessen my pain, so that I can endure such pain.

For you let no one go, not even if he with-stands all tortures.’ And this happened on Friday the 30th of June. I hadto endure all the tortures with God’s help. And I was unable to getdressed this whole time or use my hands without the other pain that Ihad to suffer innocently. When the executioner took me back to jail, hesaid to me: ‘Sir, I beg you, for God’s sake confess something, whether itbe true or not.

Iwas to deny God, and I have confessed that I11did so; I was to deny Godand the heavenly host, and I have confessed that I did so; I have con-fessed that he then baptised me and the two women were the sponsors;that he gave me a ducat, but that it turned out to be a shard.Then, thinking that I had finished, but they sent the executioner tome, and [asked] where I had been to go dancing, and I did not knowwhich way was up.

I said that I had not recognised them.‘You old rascal, must I set the executioner on you?’ ... ‘Wasn’t the chan-cellor there?’ I said yes. ‘Who else?’ I recognised no one, I said. ‘So,’ hesaid, ‘take one street after the other in turn.

I was asked if I hadn’trecognised someone from the castle, whoever it might be, I should sayso without hesitation.

The Freiherr von Horn wrote, in a report that was in 1883 inthe possession of Freiherr Emil von Marschalk, that Junius was aBamberg city councillor (Ratsherr) from 1608 to 1613, mayor or bur-gomaster in 1614, city councillor again in 1615–16, burgomaster againfrom 1617, councillor in 1618–20, burgomaster 1621, councillor1622–23, and burgomaster 1624–28. This letter, edited (in part) byLeitschuh, was in the Royal Library at Bamberg.
