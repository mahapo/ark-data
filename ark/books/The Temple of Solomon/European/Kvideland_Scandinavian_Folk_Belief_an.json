A knowledge of ourown ethnic background as well as of other traditions broadens ourhorizons and helps us understand ourselves and the world we live in.This book surveys the folk belief of Scandinavia as manifested inlegends, memorates, dites, magic formulas, rite descriptions, and otherdocuments. It demonstrates the remarkable uniformity of folk beliefin preindustrial Scandinavia and also notes regional differences. Itpresents central aspects of the traditional worldview rather than theprose narrative tradition recognized as literature. Consequently folk-tales that represent a concept of supranormal experience differentfrom that of legends and related texts have not been included here.We are currently working on a collection of Scandinavian folktales.To date there exists no collection of legends and other texts cover-ing the folk belief of Scandinavia as a whole. Reidar Th. Christian-sen's Folktales of Norway (1964), Jacqueline Simpson's Icelandic Folktalesand Legends (1972), John Lindow's Swedish Legends and Folktales (1978),and John F. West's Faroese Folk-Tales and Legends (1980) limit them-selves to the folktale and legend tradition of the respective countries,and there are no English-language editions of Danish or Swedish-Finnish traditions.In selecting our texts, we have emphasized faithfulness to belieftradition rather than to literary quality. Some of the better-knowntexts, for example, those published by Peter Chr.

Mostwere collected from oral sources between the mid-nineteenth andearly twentieth centuries. The final chapter, however, contains sam-ples of narratives that are told in Scandinavia today, demonstratingthe continuity of tradition as well as the changes wrought by the in-dustrialization and urbanization of Scandinavian society.When we speak of Scandinavia, we mean Denmark, the Faeroe Is-lands (some 220 miles north of Scotland), Iceland, Norway, Sweden,and Finland. The Finns differ from the rest of the Scandinavians inethnic background and language, but Finland was ruled by Swedenuntil 1809, and social and cultural ties between the Finns and theirneighbors to the west have remained strong. During the MiddleAges, large portions of the southwestern coastal district of Finlandwere colonized by Swedish farmers. Today their numbers are dwin-dling rapidly, but large pockets of Swedish speakers remain along thecoast. Even now Swedish continues to share with Finnish the statusof an official language. The texts from Finland included in this vol-ume were all recorded in Swedish and represent the tradition of theSwedish-speaking community.By the mid-nineteenth century, the population of Scandinavianumbered roughly seven and a half million, of which three and a halfmillion fell to Sweden, one and a half each to Denmark and Norway,and one million to the Swedish province in Finland. In addition therewere some sixty thousand people in Iceland and perhaps twentythousand on the Faeroe Islands. Whereas in Britain and on the Conti-3"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"4 Introductionnent the Industrial Revolution had caused a large part of the popula-tion to converge in mushrooming towns and cities, in Scandinavia themajority as yet subsisted on what they could produce by farming,lumbering, and, in the coastal areas, fishing. There were few cities ofany considerable size. In 1800 Copenhagen had one hundred thou-sand inhabitants, Stockholm seventy-five thousand, and Norwayboasted of only one significant trade center —Bergen, which had apopulation of fifteen thousand. No more than one-tenth of the Scan-dinavian population lived and worked in urban areas. Commerceplayed a relatively small part in the national economies. The only ex-ports were grain from Denmark, bar iron from Sweden, tar fromSwedish Finland, and fish and timber from Norway. Until the 1850sthere were no major commercial banks in the North.During the second half of the nineteenth century, commerce andindustry developed more rapidly and communications improved. InNorway and Sweden, roads were built to open up the valleys andmake traffic across the mountain passes possible. A system of packetboats along the Scandinavian coasts and short railroad lines in thesouthern parts of Sweden and Norway provided the first publicmeans of transportation. In Sweden steam-powered saw mills allowedthe export of timber to grow and eventually eclipse that of iron, andthe repeal of the British Naval Acts in 1849 led to a rapid develop-ment of a merchant fleet in Norway. Bit by bit textile factories ap-peared throughout Scandinavia. By 1872 cheap grain from Russia andthe U.S. began flooding Scandinavian markets, causing prices to dropby half. But within a decade, the Danes learned to process their graininto beer, which they exported successfully. They also switched toanimal production, developed beet sugar on a large scale, and pi-oneered in shipbuilding and engineering. Norway responded to thedrop in grain prices by increasing their milk production and furtherexpanding shipping, eventually deploying one of the world's largermerchant fleets. Sweden began producing high-quality but inexpen-sive steel, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the highlyindustrialized Sweden of today had emerged. The agricultural popula-tion fell rapidly until, by 1910, less than half of the labor force wasso employed. In the rest of Scandinavia, industrialization occurredmore gradually but just as surely and with it came the social and cul-tural changes that dismantled traditional society.Throughout preindustrial Scandinavia, a similar socioeconomicstratification can be observed. Both Sweden and Denmark wereparliamentary monarchies. Until the early nineteenth century, Nor-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction 5way was governed as a province of Denmark, and Finland, as a prov-ince of Sweden. In the spring of 1814, when Denmark was forced tocede Norway to Sweden as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, an as-sembly of civil servants, farmers, town representatives, and militaryofficers hastily met at Eidsvoll. They fashioned a constitution in a fewshort weeks and, on May 17, declared Norway a \"free, independent,and indivisible realm,\" to be governed by a limited form of monar-chy. The Danish regent, Christian Frederik, was elected king, but byAugust he was forced to abdicate in favor of the Swedish crownprince Carl Johan (formerly the French marshal Bernadotte), whothreatened to take by force what had been pledged to Sweden bytreaty. Carl Johan agreed to accept the Norwegian constitution, how-ever, and the two countries were joined in a dynastic union thatlasted until 1905, when Sweden finally gave way to the Norwegianindependence movement, which had been growing steadily through-out the century. Iceland, although granted home rule in 1904, re-mained Danish until World War II, when, in 1944, it declared itself arepublic. At the same time, the Faeroe Islands achieved autonomy ex-cept in foreign relations, which to this day remain in the hands of theDanish government. In 1808-9 Finland was wrested from Swedishcontrol by Russia, which was seeking to strengthen its borders in theNorthwest. Even the most patriotic Finns accepted submission to thegrowing power of the czarist empire as inevitable, and it was not un-til the general disruption of the status quo during World War I, andspecifically in the Russian Revolution of 1917, that Finland was ableto declare itself independent. The nationalist movement in Finland in-volved the struggle not only for political freedom but also for an in-digenous Finnish culture that could hold its own against Russificationand Swedish cultural hegemony. The rise of Finnish as a national lan-guage played an important role in this process.Social organization in Scandinavia, below the national governmentlevel, was by counties, districts, and parishes, to which the individualfarmsteads belonged. In Denmark and Norway, most of the large es-tates were owned by nobles and wealthy bourgeoisie, but, by themid-nineteenth century, half of the land had passed into the hands ofindependent farmers (bonde) and other middle-class owners. Thistransformation was largely due to the so-called Laws of Enclosurepassed successively between the 1750s and 1820s (in Sweden) to re-place the patchwork of widely dispersed fields with a more unifiedsystem of middle-sized farms. The new owners acquired their hold-ings by exchange or by lease and outright purchase. In Norway,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"6 Introductionwhere less than four percent of the land is arable anyway, there werenever many large estates and consequently no rural aristocracy tospeak of. The same is true of Iceland and the Faeroe Islands.Besides the landowning farmers, the largest part of the rural popu-lation consisted of cotters (Danish/Norwegian, husmenn, Swedish, tor-pare), as -well as laborers and servants. Cotters were tenants of smallholdings, which they received in exchange for their labor. The re-quired services left them little time or energy to devote to their ownfields. Nevertheless, they were better off than the laborers whoworked for room and board and perhaps for a few pieces of clothingand some seed to plant around the shack supplied by the bonde. Thetenancy system was enforced by various ordinances. Measures passedin Denmark between 1733 and 1764 made acceptance of tenancycompulsory (adscriptio glebae), and a decree passed in Norway providedthat the children of cotters, except for the eldest boy and girl, had toserve in their home parish at fixed low wages. In Sweden similar lawsgave extensive legal and disciplinary rights to the landowners. Still,this nearly proletarian population continued to grow rapidly. By thebeginning of the nineteenth century, cotters outnumbered freeholdersin Denmark, and in Sweden they composed forty percent of the en-tire population by 1850.Although the household, made up of the farmer and his family, in-cluding cotters, laborers, and servants, constituted the basic social unitin the rural areas, there were other important elements in the hierar-chy of rural society. At the top of the scale we find, besides thewealthy landowners, the bailiff. He was usually a man of means andserved as the representative of the county government, wielding vir-tually absolute power in his district. It is not surprising that in legen-dary tradition the bailiff often appears as a cruel and unjust man, areputation he shares with the owners of the large estates. The ruralfolk had little contact with the central government above the level ofthe bailiff.Another figure of considerable authority among the rural folk wasthe minister. In Catholic times the clergy contributed significantly tothe development of oral traditions and belief. Saints' legends and ex-empla, used by priests to illustrate their sermons, lived on as popularnarratives. Monks and nuns, who usually received little more thanrudimentary theological training, acted as healers and combined invo-cation of divine help with magic in their medical practice. And beliefin the satanic powers of witches had been official church dogma sincebefore the fifteenth century. With the Reformation, established by"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction jroyal edict in most of Scandinavia during the 1530s (1541 in Iceland),the clergy was stripped of its economic prerogatives. Monasterieswere dissolved and most of the church lands and properties sold. Theminister became financially dependent upon tithes and voluntary con-tributions, and often he must have been rather poor. But socially theclergy continued to enjoy a strong position, teaching the people fromthe pulpit and maintaining control over schools and even over theuniversities. It; is worth noting that the early poets of Scandinaviawere frequently clergymen, and they were also the first to pay atten-tion to the oral traditions of the folk and to publish them.But in spite of his authority, the minister, too, is treated as an am-biguous figure in legend and folktale. He was rarely born in the par-ish in which he served and remained an outsider by virtue of his so-cial background and education. After the Reformation, the minister'suniversity education was frequently rendered as proof that he hadbeen trained at the Black School at Wittenberg (the town of MartinLuther) and possessed the Black Book which gave him magicalpower. It was believed that he could not only exorcise the devil butemploy the devil's services for his own purposes —such as, travelthrough the air. Thus the minister at times appears as the defender ofthe folk who dupes and defeats Satan, but often he is treated as abuffoon or as one wielding equivocal powers.Well below the landowners, bailiffs, ministers, and farmers, we findanother important social group consisting of itinerant laborers andcraftsmen. During the haymaking and harvesting, a farmer would of-ten hire additional help. The seasonal laborers would sleep in out-houses and barns, and were fed at the farmer's table. Usually theyreceived no actual wages, and at the end of the season they had tomove on, often surviving by begging. Craftsmen, such as shoemakersand tailors, were better off. The farmstead was largely self-sufficient,and the spinning, weaving, and sewing were tasks of the farmer'swife and women servants. Nevertheless, specialists in making clothesand shoes would move from farm to farm and there ply their craft,for a few weeks at a time, in return for room, board, and wages.Temporary laborers and itinerant craftsmen were often goodstorytellers and did much to transmit traditions from one place to an-other. A similar role was played by the soldiers returning from ser-vice in the town garrisons or from abroad. The soldiers were usuallythe sons of cotters and laborers. Normally each landlord was requiredto provide one soldier for each one hundred acres he owned, and nat-urally he would dispatch one of his -workers rather than his own son."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"8 IntroductionUpon returning, the soldier would receive a small house to live in,and often he would function as an elementary teacher. Universalelementary education was introduced in Denmark in 1814, in Swedenin 1844, in Norway in 1860, and in Finland, although less compre-hensively, in 1865. But for a long time, rural children received onlyrudimentary instruction; teachers visited farms on a rotating basis fora few weeks at a time, and even the teachers knew little beyond thebasics in reading and writing. Secondary education, let alone univer-sity study, was available only in the larger towns or cities and wasusually reserved for the children of the well-to-do. It was a major ad-vance when N. F. S. Grundtvig, a Danish minister and later bishop,founded the first folk high school in 1844. Geared specifically to theneeds of the rural population, the folk high school was in sessionduring the winter months, when the young were not needed as muchon the farm. The folk high schools were introduced in Norway in1865 and in Sweden three years later. They continue as an importantelement in the Scandinavian educational system today.A final group to be mentioned here were pedlars, who hawkedtheir wares at farms and at marketplaces in town, and beggars,usually old and jobless, sick or insane. Some of the beggars camefrom the local community and they were generally well treated;others wandered from village to village and farm to farm. Thesestrangers were usually feared. Often they were accused of thievery, orworse, suspected of using witchcraft to harm crops, livestock, andeven the farmer and his family, if they had not been generous enoughin doling out food, clothing, or shelter for a night or two. Amongthe itinerant beggars were individuals who either could not or •wouldnot work, gypsies, Finns, and Lapps —all strangers in the eyes of theestablished community and therefore suspect.Daily life on the farmstead was stable and often isolated. Neverthe-less, regular contacts with the outside world were provided bytraders, craftsmen, soldiers, beggars, and occasional visitors, bringingnew impulses capable of transforming tradition. Ownership of theland passed from father to son and typically remained in the samefamily for many generations. The work rhythms were dictated by theexigencies of the soil and the shifting seasons. The folk lived close tonature and believed they were a part of it. In the worldview of therural population, beliefs taught by the church merged with those na-tive to Scandinavia and surviving in folk tradition. Christianity waslate in coming to Scandinavia, making few inroads before 1000 A.D.The Norse religion (like that of the Finns and Lapps) was this-world"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 9oriented, and both the old sky gods and the earth bound elves (alfirand dish) were seen not as transcendent but as being in and of nature.The ancient god Odin, for example, was adept at manipulating theforces of nature through magic. His powers were not supernaturallike those of the Christian God, but preternatural. In recent Scandina-vian folk traditions, both orientations, one vertical, involving thetranscendent deity, the other horizontal, relating humans to the\"powers\" of nature, exist side by side. We can see this duality in thepractices of reputed witches and wise folk and in the underlying,multifarious concepts of the human mind and soul (hug), as well as inmany church-sponsored rituals surrounding central events in the sea-sonal and life cycles of the individual, within the context of rural life.From the perspective of the church, the spirits of the farm, forest,field, river, lake, sea, and air were typically seen as evil, and blessings,exorcisms, amulets, and other sacred devices were used to protect thehuman community. Today it is easy to dismiss the people's belief inthese spirits, along with the church's response to them, as mere super-stitions, but that is quite beside the point. Perceiving their daily en-vironment in prescientific but eminently practical terms, the peopleresponded to nature in the way they experienced it, namely as ani-mate and possessed of will and thus capable of aiding humans butalso of doing them harm. The farm spirit (Danish/Norwegian, nisse,Swedish, tomte), for example, ensured the prosperity of house andfarm, but if crossed he would steal the farmer's hay, grain, or cattle,depriving him of his wealth and delivering it to a more fortunateneighbor.The relation between the human community and the spirits of na-ture thus depended upon mutuality and respect. If asked to move hiscow shed because the animal droppings bothered the haugbo (\"mound-dweller\") living underneath the shed, the farmer would usually com-ply. If his wife was asked to act as midwife to one of the \"invisible,\"she would go. But there were also traditional devices to keep the \"in-visible\" at bay if they became too intrusive. Anything made of steelwas considered to have protective properties, as were fire and lightand certain seeds and herbs. A mother might place a pair of scissorsin the cradle to keep her child from being \"changed\" or the younggirl tending cattle at a remote mountain farm might tie herbs in herhair to keep from being pestered by a would-be fairy lover. Also,newborn children were in danger of being carried off by the \"invisi-ble,\" who would exchange them for their own offspring. This tradi-tion served to explain the dangers surrounding childbirth and com-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"io Introductionmon infant diseases, such as mongolism, atrepsy, or rickets, which wenow attribute to poor nutrition and other causes. One practical con-sequence of this belief was that special care was taken to keep thenewborn child under constant supervision. Even adolescents andadults could be carried off and \"taken into the mountain.\" Mentaldepression and other psychological disorders were explained in thisway. Or the watersprite (Danish/Norwegian, n0kk, Swedish, ndck)might cause the careless bather to drown in a river or lake, or thespirit of the seas (draug) might cause the fisherman to go down withhis boat. Although dangerous, the \"powers\" of nature were also con-sidered to be good neighbors and friends, capable of giving adviceand practical aid. In oral tradition we find numerous stories about the\"invisible folk\" helping their human neighbors, such as the hulderalerting the dairymaid to a fire or to a loose cow; we hear about elvesteaching a girl to sew or helping a young man repair a tool and aboutthe n0kk teaching the aspiring fiddler to play his instrument. We hearof the \"subterranean\" folk -who come to the aid of soldiers during awar. We even hear of successful marriages between the \"invisible\" andhuman folk, as well as of brief erotic encounters between them.In general, sickness was considered to have supranormal origin —that is, to be caused by the \"invisible\" or by human beings seekingrevenge for some real or imagined wrong. In this folk tradition, wefind elaborate rituals and spells fusing divine power with magic todrive out hostile influences from the afflicted person or animal. Thefolk concept of the mind or soul (Danish, hu, Norwegian, hug, Swed-ish, hag) is fundamental to this context. Unlike the Christian notionof the soul as a spiritual element that separates from the body at themoment of death, the hug is continuous with the physical self,representing a person's thought, will, desire, and feeling. The manyprojections of the hug include traditional notions regarding dream ex-perience, including the nightmare, as well as belief in an invisiblepresence accompanying and preceding the person (Danish/Norwegian,vord, Swedish, vdrd). The hug could \"wander\" about without the in-dividual being aware of it, often with dire consequences, but it couldalso be sent deliberately, for example, in the case of magic flight orother uses of magic. Specialists in the controlled use of the hug werecalled wise folk or witches, depending on whether their skills wereconsidered useful or threatening to the community.The \"unseen\" world also included the dead, who continued to\"live\" in the grave until they finally faded from memory. Oral tradi-tion suggests that the dead were often feared, but relations with them"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction ncould be friendly. A dead mother's longing for her child might inflictsickness upon the infant (elsk); a drowned sailor might haunt the vil-lagers, demanding that a newborn boy be named after him so that hecould live on in him; a child born out of wedlock and killed wouldoften torment the mother; and the dead who had not been preparedproperly for burial would come back to demand their due. Inversely,thieves or murderers had to \"walk again\" until they had expiated theircrime. But the dead could also give advice, help settle a dispute, orassure a family of their spiritual welfare. Occasionally we hear of adead spouse returning at night to share in the comforts of his or heraccustomed bed and board.In dealing with the dead, as with the \"invisible\" folk, respect andcaution were called for, and analogous devices and rituals were ap-plied to \"lay\" the dead and protect the living against unwanted intru-sions. In medieval literature we find the revenant (draug) being boundto the grave by having a pole rammed through his or her chest,decapitated, or removed from the house through a specially cut hole,which is then walled up again so that he or she cannot get back in. Inlater folk tradition, it is more typical to keep the dead away by seed-ing flax around the house, placing a hot griddle on the threshold, or,more constructively, bringing something to the grave that symboli-cally satisfies the needs of the restless dead.In the course of an individual's lifetime, there were ritualizedevents of special significance. Before baptism the infant was consid-ered heathen, and not until its forehead had been sprinkled with holywater was it safe from being \"changed\" by the \"invisible\" folk. By thesame token, the mother was heathen by virtue of having conceivedthe child and had to be \"churched\" in a special purificatory rite (Dan-ish/Norwegian, kirketagning, Swedish, kyrkotagning). Similarly, con-firmation at age fourteen acknowledged the adolescent's progressioninto adulthood and self-responsibility as a Christian, to be followedin due time by the ceremonies of marriage and, finally, by the sacra-ment of the funeral. All these church-sponsored rituals instilled in theindividual the knowledge that the various stages of the passagethrough life had not only personal and socioeconomic importance butalso sacred significance. Each event marked a transition in the person'slife, a period in which special dangers were posed both by the deviland, from the Christian perspective, by the \"invisible.\"Folk and religious tradition also met in the annual calendar of theliturgical year and popular feast days. Before the time of Christianiza-tion, the agricultural year had been divided into two seasons, summer"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"12 Introductionand winter. Each season -was then divided by its festival, midsummerand midwinter (/«/). After the introduction of Christianity, thechurch, instead of banishing the folk festivals, paired them with holydays. Thusjul became Christmas, and the midsummer feast becameassociated -with Saint John (the Baptist). The calendar was also filledwith numerous saints' days, most of which were lost again after theReformation. Besides its liturgical significance, the church calendarhad its practical use in helping the farmer remember to plant crops,harvest, slaughter, brew, et cetera. In Denmark and southern Sweden,the coming of spring was acknowledged with festive processions\"bringing in summer\" and by dancing around the maypole decoratedwith the first green foliage of the year. In Sweden the evening beforeSt. Valborg's Day (May 1) was celebrated with the lighting ofbonfires. In this instance, as in the case of Christmas and Saint John'sDay, it is the evening before the holy day that has become most im-portant in folk tradition. Christmas Eve is celebrated with eating anddrinking and the giving of gifts; Christmas morning the Christianfolk go to church. Midsummer Night (June 23) is still the most popu-lar festival throughout Scandinavia. Easter was a purely church-related holiday, but it too was surrounded with traditions about the\"other world.\" The night before Easter, as on Midsummer Night,witches met with Satan on the Blue Mountain (Danish, Bloksberg,Norwegian, Blakollen, Swedish, Bldkulla) to celebrate the Black Sab-bath. Another important folk feast to remember here is Saint Olav'sDay (Olsok, July 29), supposedly the day the missionary king OlafHaraldsson died on the battlefield at Stiklestad in Norway. On theFaeroe Islands, Olsok continues to be celebrated by communal dancingand the singing of the medieval ballads that tell about the life of theking.The Storyteller and Oral TraditionToday the bulk of legends that have been published take the formof complete narratives or stories. However, recent fieldwork suggeststhat legends are more typically presented in a kind of dialogue or in-formal conversation. Unfortunately, there is no empirical evidence toprove that this also applies to the way stories were told in the past.But it is noteworthy that we have much more information aboutstorytellers specializing in folktales than in legends. The two forms of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 13storytelling are by no means the same; the legend has always beenless dependent upon the specialist for its transmission.No doubt there were situations in which a legend was recited in itscomplete form, for example, when a child or an outsider was told itfor the first time. This would occur when it was deemed important toimpart knowledge of given norms or rules or to tell the history of thefamily and clan. Detailed descriptions of how legends were tradition-ally told are rare. Ivar Klokker from Hardanger (Norway), for exam-ple, is quoted by Pastor Hertzberg during the nineteenth century:\"When the old folk in Hardanger got together at festive occasions,their talk almost always turned to enumerating their ancestors andfamily, and telling stories about them.\"From the end of the nineteenth century we know about severaltellers of legends, but, again, we lack precise information about howthey told them.. Johannes Skar writes about Hallvor Aakre fromSetesdal (Norway): \"He could sit all week and tell stories, evening af-ter evening. He knew about all the farms and the families livingthere. . . . He told about strong men and their deeds, about the in-visible folk and beliefs and witchcraft.\" He had learned from hisgrandfather how to tell stories, but Snorre Sturluson's medieval sagasof the Norse kings influenced his style.Rikard Berge took down the entire history of the Villands-Clan inHallingdal (Norway) from Nils Lyingsslatten (born in 1827), \"fromBlank-Ola on down through the years, told with such vividness andskill that I have never heard the Norwegian language used better.\"Berge writes that Nils presented his stories with a freshness and colorthat made the audience listen not only with their ears but also withtheir eyes. About another storyteller from the 1890s, Sveinung S0ren-sen, Rikard Berge states that \"he raised the simplest legend up to anelevated epic style. . . . His style possessed vigor, an economical andchiseled form. . . . He dramatized the legends, especially storiesabout strong men; he changed his voice for each character. . . . Hesavored the story . . . spinning out an epic thread and holding on toit firmly.\"In the classic Norwegian legend collections of P. Chr. Asbj0rnsen,we find detailed descriptions of the storyteller, but we know fromAsbj0rnsen's diaries and notebooks that these descriptions are entirelyfictional and thus represent a literary genre.In the important study of tradition bearers on Gotland (Sweden)during the mid-nineteenth century, Ragnar Bjersby emphasizes thaton the whole there is little empirical evidence upon which to base the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"14 Introductionstudy of legend performance in the past, but he does provide us withsome interesting details about the storytelling situation. For example,he quotes a description from a funeral: \"When the festive dinner hadended ... I happened to be looking into the small bedroom, andthere I found entertainment. The sexton -was sitting in the middle ofthe floor, yes. Snoblom on a bed by the door, and there was a wholebunch of older women, and they were telling ghost stories by thedozen. . . . Everybody had one story or another to offer, but bestwas the old, whitehaired sexton\" (Bjersby, 1964, p. 128). The tellingof legends during wakes and funerals has been well documented(Inger Christiansen, 1968). It was typically part of all festive get-togethers, such as weddings, Christmas parties, and work feasts.Nevertheless, one must take care not to exaggerate the importance offestive occasions for transmitting legends and folk belief. In the eve-ning, when the folk gathered in the kitchen, all types of traditionswere exchanged. Most of the daily work was carried out in unison,which gave many opportunities to talk about traditional knowledge.Legends and folk beliefs were shared by everyone and were told andtalked about under many different circumstances as an integral part ofeveryday life. This meant that stories were usually referred to or toldonly in an abbreviated form —everybody knew what they were allabout. As Norwegian folklorist B. Hertzberg Johnsen was able todocument in recent fieldwork studies of a specific local legend, infor-mants had heard the story in its complete form only once (Johnsen,1980, p. 189). This tendency toward abbreviation of the narrative inthe typical performance situation may help to explain the fragmentarynature of many legend texts found in the archives.If we have but little conclusive data about the storyteller, we haveeven fewer genuine descriptions of legend performances as an interac-tion between storyteller and audience. But some of the texts do indi-cate that collectors had witnessed this type of interaction. In Historie-gubbar pa Dal (Storytellers in Dal, 1866), the Swedish author AugustBondeson gives a fictionalized description of storytellers. In his depic-tion of Anders Backman (born in 1826), he suggests that the audienceparticipated in the performance through commentaries:Once, •when Anders had finished a story about a giant, MotherStina had something to say:\"What's become of the giants now?\"\"Hm, there've never been any giants,\" said the miller, a youngfellow who didn't believe in this sort of thing."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction 15\"Yes, but the giant on Bare Mountain, he existed. I've beenthere and seen the passages in the stone and his cave there,\" saidMother Stine.At this point Bondeson broke off the discussion, afraid that thedoubter was going to disrupt the mood. Even though this descriptionis fictional, it probably reflects an actual storytelling situation. RikardBerge has given us an animated depiction of his informant NilsLyingsslatten. In the dialogue between Berge and Nils we have per-haps a fairly realistic picture of a traditional legend performance:When he had asked [Berge] about the harvest and cows in Tele-mark, Nils suddenly turned to the folk there and asked whetherthey could get on with the cattle deal they had been negotiating.M0kjal and Nils were neighbors, and now M0kjal was taking thecattle to the mountain pasture and he wanted to have \"Kveikreid\"along.But then the tall man straightened up. They did not want to letthat cow go; one animal by that name had to remain on the farm.\"It's strange,\" said Nils, sort of dreaming to himself, \"my fatheralso wanted to have that 'Kveikreid' name among his cows. Yes,indeed, he did.\"\"That's some old nonsense,\" said M0kjal, turning to the wife anddaughter to negotiate further. I stuck with Nils and soon found outwhat the name \"Kveikreid\" was all about.On Rygg they were good friends with the mound folk, he said,so they got a cow from them on loan. Her name was \"Kveikreid\"and she milked the bucket full every time. Then the moundwoman said to the women on Rygg:\"But if someone dies in our family, then we'll have to have thecow back; until then you can have her,\" she said. And they ownedher for many years; but one morning she just disappeared; her stallwas empty and since then nobody has seen \"Kveikreid.\" Only thename hung on at the farm, and the cow by that name has alwaysbrought prosperity to the cow shed.\"But you've never come across the mound folk?\" I asked.\"Oh, sure, of course. The mound folk are just like other people.\"Once he was out herding cattle, when he saw a mound boy and hismother.\"They were dressed just like the folks here. I thought it was myown mother, I did,\" said Nils, and so he asked her when he camehome:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"16 Introduction\"What were you and Ola doing on the northern field?\"\"We've haven't been there at all,\" she said. Then he knew forsure that he had seen the mound folk. M0kjal got more and moretalkative, the women all the more eager to sell and old Nils gotmore irritated all the time.In a recent folkloristic study from Sweden, we have a similardescription of the proletarian writer Jan Fridegard who was the sonof a cotter and grew up on a large manor. Ebbe Schon writes thatFridegard based much of his writing on firsthand observations of thestoryteller and his milieu. Fridegard evoked \"not only the particularstyle and technique of the storyteller but also the reactions of the au-dience: appreciative comments, expressions of doubt or dislike, thestoryteller's counter response, or the response of someone else pickingup the thread to tell another story\" (E. Schon, 1978, p. 116). Whatfollows is a memorat retold by Fridegard in Lyktgubbarna (The Will-o'-the-wisp, 1955, p. 8-9, quoted by Schon, p. 160-161):It was dangerous on the hill, so it was not a good idea to go upthere alone. You could run afoul of an elf or a wood sprite beforeyou knew it. That would be the end of you.My father told a story about a boy who sat drinking coffee bythe edge of the meadow that you can see on the other side of thefield. Suddenly he saw the elves dancing, a ring of tiny elves. Stu-pid and brutal as he was, he jumped up and hit them with hiswhip. They disappeared but the boy got sick and could not walkhome on his own. The horses got home by themselves, but theboy was lying in the field, swollen and in pain.\"Did he get well?\" one of my brothers asked.\"Like hell he did! They sent for Madame Tapper, as she wascalled. She was to melt lead over him, but the lead flew into thewalls and ceiling.\"I can't help you,\" Madame Tapper said angrily, \"you mustreally have upset them. They won't accept the sacrifice.\"And he died the next day.\"Now what is one to think about something like that?\" mymother asked then.\"Believe anything you want, but it's the truth. Go and askMadam Tapper, she's still alive, as you know.\"\"Oh, I know that there's much that's hidden. I don't have to askher.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction 17It has been argued that the best among folk singers, storytellers,and fiddlers came from the lowest strata in society, most of them cot-ters, day laborers, fishermen and servants (B0 et al., 1981, p. 17-18).This was the view held by Danish folklorist Evald Tang Kristensenwho said, for example, that \"folk traditions are mostly preserved bypoor folk, and it seems that increased material comforts in life arecausing this spiritual inheritance to be lost.\" In Gamle kildevceld (OldWellsprings, 1927), Kristensen described the milieu in the home ofAne Jensdatter (1830-97), who lived in Lund Moor in the parish ofGjellerup and was one of his more important informants:It was a place that lay far from the beaten path, not many strangersever came there. They lived in great poverty. The mother sang tothe children when it got dark in the evening, while the knittingneedles moved rapidly, because they had to save light, and thelamp was lit only when it became absolutely necessary. Theyworked all day, and if everything went as it should, the worklasted until the children became sleepy. Then the mother beganwith her songs and stories, and sang and sang and sang, until thelittle ones knew it all by heart, just as if it had been put into print,(p. 34)Clearly it was Kristensen's goal to document that the poorer folkalso possessed their own culture. Nevertheless, one should take thisview of the tradition bearer with a grain of salt. Perhaps the role ofthe poor in this regard has been exaggerated and reflects instead thesociopolitical views of the collector and scholar. However importantthe role played by the landless and poor was in transmitting folk be-lief, stories, and songs, it must be remembered that these collectivetraditions belonged to all the folk, including the landed farmers, andthat it shaped their daily existence as much as that of the poor.Genre Analysis and FunctionIt is imperative to differentiate between the various genres of folktradition in terms of content, form, function, distribution, and degreeof interaction. A jocular verse does not have the same function as amagic formula. A migratory legend may be based on folk belief fromanother time or place and is not necessarily representative of folk be-lief in the area in which it was collected. For the folklorist genre anal-ysis is first of all a critical tool. For the people who live in the tradi-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"i8 Introductiontion, the different genres are time-tested forms of communication. Byutilizing generally accepted genres, even socially problematical mes-sages can be expressed in an indirect but unambiguous manner.One of the most important genres is the legend, which is also oneof the most difficult to define. Since the Brothers Grimm, it has beencustomary to contrast the legend with the folktale. In the introductionto Deutsche Sagen (German Legends, 1816), they write: \"The folktale ismore poetic, the legend is more historical\"; and in the second editionof Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology, 1844), Jakob Grimm putsit this way: \"Looser, less fettered than the legend, the folktale lacksthat local habitation -which hampers the legend, but makes it morehomelike. The folktale flies, the legend walks, knocks at your door;the one can draw freely out of the fullness of poetry, the other has al-most the authority of history.\"It is often said that the legend has a firm, stereotyped form, but infact the complete form is transmitted only in certain situations, forexample, when the legend is told to someone who is not familiarwith it, as mentioned earlier. More often the legend is referred toonly summarily. According to Linda Degh, the recital of the legendusually takes the form of a conversation. Similarly, Leopold Schmidtmaintains that only the content of the legend is fixed and that itsform depends on the circumstances in which it is communicated(Schmidt, 1963, p. 108).The criterion of belief has been employed to characterize the leg-end. But this may be of little use because belief sometimes changes,when social conditions and the level of scientific knowledge change,and varies from person to person. A legend does not become a folk-tale just because people cease believing in it, as Max Luthi writes(Liithi, 1961, p. 24). Empirical investigations have demonstrated thatthe attitudes among participants in a legend performance can varyfrom belief to disbelief and from a positive response to aggressive re-jection. Linda Degh and Andrew Vazsonyi summarize the problem asfollows: \"Every legend states something. . . . This is distinctive incomparison with tale categories. ... As much as it seems proventhat the personal belief of the participants in the legend process is ir-relevant, it also seems to be a rule that general reference to belief is aninherent and the most outstanding feature of the folk legend\" (Degh1976, p. 119).We are left, then, with a relatively vague description of the legendas a story about events, including historical events, placed in asupranormal context. Most often the legend is told with the tacit as-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Introduction 19sumption that it is a true story, that it is in agreement with acceptedbelief and localized in known surroundings and ascribed to trustwor-thy persons. But the form of the legend found in books —this editionincluded —is a function of the process of collecting and editing ratherthan representative of how the legends were told in their naturalcontext.Traditionally legends have been divided into three main groups:mythical, historical, and etiological. The concept \"mythical\" is lessthan satisfactory, however, because it harks back to an outdated ideathat the legends are the remains of an older mythology. Furthermore,supranormal elements are no less basic to the etiological legends andto most of the historical legends.In contrast to local legends, migratory legends are spread over arelatively large area but are always tied to specific localities and per-sons. The storyteller typically insists that the legend did not comefrom the outside but rather that it originated right in his own milieuand spread from there.Legends are often characterixed as a form of literature. This viewderives partly from collectors and editors giving preference to texts ofhigh literary quality. Another factor may be that in the process ofrecording, the informant is obliged to produce a complete text for thebenefit of an outsider —the collector. But in actual performance it isthe personal style of the storyteller that lends aesthetic quality to thelegend. The legend does not boast of introductory or concluding for-mulas, as in the folktale, nor does it always have a developed plot.C. W. von Sydow distinguished between legends and the so-calledmemorat. Today the memorat is defined as a personal story about asupranormal experience told by either the individual or a third personquoting him or her. The supranormal experience reported in amemorat often occurs in darkness and usually under conditions of fa-tigue, stress, or a state between sleeping and waking. Psychologistssuggest that in supranormal experiences, visual, tactile, and auditoryperceptions and other personal factors combine with the traditionalframework of beliefs as well as with social norms of behavior. Forexample, some men have been drinking and playing poker until lateat night. One of the players drops a card on the floor. When he bendsdown to pick it up, he sees a black dog with glowing eyes and jawscrouching under the table. The men understand that this is the devil,and the drinking and card playing stops immediately. The traditionalbelief that card playing and drinking are identified with the devil is"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"2O Introductionsuddenly actualized. The game breaks off and the balance of socialnorms is restored.Most often a supranormal experience is spontaneously interpretedin terms of collective belief. But it also happens that the individual isnot sure what the supranormal experience means. The experience re-mains on the level of the numen, and when he or she tells about it toothers the result is thus a Mwmen-memorat. The experience may thenbe interpreted by third persons and assimilated into accepted belief.Legends containing similar motifs often influence the retelling of whathas happened.Nevertheless, it sometimes occurs that an individual insists upon aninterpretation that differs from the collective tradition, in which casewe get what may be called a personal memorat. Personal memoratsare easy to identify; they have no parallels or variants in the collectivetradition.Memorats are our most important source for the study of folk be-lief. They tell about socially accepted supranormal experiences. Wher-ever we find memorats, we can assume that legends describing thesame experience represent actual folk belief in that geographical area.It has often been suggested that memorats are eventually stylized tothe degree that they become legends. But the fact that they containlegend motifs is not sufficient proof. Memorats and legends expresstwo different attitudes toward supranormal experience, and there isno empirical evidence documenting the evolution from one genre toanother.A story about a personal experience or memory that is notsupranormal in character is called a chronicat. It has the same relationto historical legends that the memorat has to legends about thesupranormal. During the past few years, the chronicat has been ex-panded to include ethnohistorical materials and has thus become animportant source for the expanding field of oral and ethnic history.The fiction is another major category of prose narrative. They tellabout beings not believed in by adults who try to get children to be-lieve in them for pedagogical reasons. For example, parents try toscare children away from playing near a well by telling them that thewell sprite will take them. Children occasionally experience the wellsprite and tell memorats about it. What is a fiction for one group be-comes a belief for another.Descriptions of various ritualized actions are also an importantsource for the study of folk belief. These ritual descriptions do not"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introduction 21have a firm structure; they constitute a verbalization of an actionrather than a narrative genre.Often we encounter tradition in the form of general statementsabout supranormal and other circumstances and events. This is not anethnic genre but, rather, a \"collector's genre,\" which gives a brief andsummary description of a larger context. These statements have beentermed dites. Dites about folk belief have to be scrutinized carefullyby comparing them with memorats and ritual descriptions before theycan be accepted as valid documentation.The magic formula is the last genre that we will consider. It can bedescribed briefly as verbal sequences designed to achieve specific goalsthrough the power of the word. Magic formulas vary from epic nar-ratives to unintelligible combinations of words, letters, and signs.They can be subdivided into four categories, namely, conjurations,which address a direct command to a harmful power; ritual formulas,which describe a given purpose to be achieved through ritual action;epic formulas, which consist of narratives involving magical beingsand sympathetic magic; and secret formulas, which combine incom-prehensible words, series of letters, and signs and are usually appliedthrough the act of writing.A good number of magic formulas, usually the less complicatedvariety, were commonly used by people who applied them to every-day needs, such as, healing minor ailments and protecting the family,livestock, and house against evils of various kinds. The majority ofmagic formulas, however, were in the hands of specialists who werecalled upon in more serious cases. Magical formulas -were, of course,also used to do harm and therefore were both respected and feared.The source of magic formulas was partly oral tradition and partlyprinted or handwritten compilations called Black Books.Magic formulas can also be found in legends. For example, see thestories of witches giving life to troll cats (nos. 39.1-39.2) flying tothe Black Mass (no. 41.1, and the legends about healers plying theircraft (no. 28.1) or about the baptism of the revenant child (no. 25.1).Entertainment is an important dimension in all the genres we havediscussed, but it is rarely, if ever, primary. William Bascom's classicdistinction between the four functions of folklore is still relevant hereand can be applied to the various genres. In reciting and talking aboutlegends and supranormal experiences, the folk transmit and reaffirmcollective belief. As stated previously, memorats in particular supportbelief in supranormal beings and their relations to the human world.Legends also confirm the existing social structure and underlying"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"22 Introductionnorms. For example, until recently the work rhythm was normallydictated by the rising and setting of the sun, and consequently people•went to bed relatively early. In folk tradition this is expressed by thebelief that the \"invisible\" folk demanded that their human neighborskeep quiet after a certain hour; they would punish them if they weredisturbed. At times this belief was used by servants or laborersagainst employers who insisted that they work beyond a reasonablehour. The example implies a form of social criticism frequently foundin folk tradition. The criticism is normally directed against employers,landowners, and other people in power, such as the tax collector,sheriff, or minister. Legends provide a compensatory escape from so-cial hardships and injustice, without necessarily propounding socialchange. In general, folk tradition is conservative rather than reformist,but there are exceptions to the rule. For example, sometime duringthe seventeenth century, the migratory legend \"The Army of theHuns\" was used to raise a revolt against the authorities in both Nor-way and Sweden.Another major function of legend tradition is to create a sense ofidentity and enculturation. Rarely, as in the case of stories about\"Holger the Dane\" or about the Swedish king Charles XII, does leg-end tradition take on national significance. Typically legends relatethe individual to the familiar local milieu, the village or farm. Gener-ally speaking, legend tradition instills in people a larger worldviewand sense of territoriality, that is, a feeling for the geographic andcultural space in which they live.Finally, legends have an etiological function. They explain naturalphenomena, such as rock formations, holy springs, and lakes; they re-veal the meaning of place-names and the origin of buildings, in par-ticular, churches; and they illuminate special family traits and tradi-tions. For example, a well-known legend about the Black Deathaccounts for the allegedly large-pored skin of a family in westernNorway by relating it to the experience of a little girl who survivedthe plague by hiding in a bed filled with bird down (ML 7090,Christiansen, 1958, 10-11). Typically a legend has several functions.For example, the traditions about the \"invisible\" folk enforcing areasonable bedtime involves elements of collective belief, the sanc-tioning of social norms, and an explanation of nocturnal disturbances."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Introduction 23Collections and Editions of Folk Legends and BeliefThe oldest extant evidence for legend motifs and folk beliefs inScandinavia can be found in the poems of the Elder Edda, which werecompiled in written form in about 1270 A.D. but composed variouslybetween 700 and 1100 A.D. In them reference is made to trollwomen, dwarfs, elves, the walking dead, guardian spirits, shape-shifting, magic flight, and the hug. Stories about supranormal beingsabound in the Icelandic sagas and Landndmabok (The Book of Settle-ment) from the twelfth century. In the thirteenth-century Heimskringla(History of the Norse Kings) by Snorre Sturluson, many legends arewoven into the narrative by the author. Some twenty-five years be-fore Snorre, Saxo Grammaticus used both Danish and foreign legendmaterial to document the history of his people.An interesting pictorial documentation of legend tradition can befound on frescoes decorating ceilings and walls in medieval churches.Popular motifs include the devil in many forms, witches stealing milkand churning butter by magic, sea maidens, and Saint Olav fightingthe trolls.The first sustained folk life descriptions appear in histories writtenduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, of which Olaus Mag-nus's Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (The History of the NorthernPeople, 1555) is probably the most noteworthy. Between the end ofthe sixteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, clergymenand other government officials compiled visitation books andtopographical descriptions containing a wealth of information aboutthe folk, their customs and beliefs, and a certain number of legends.In the 1590s, for example, Bishop Jens Nilsson from Oslo recordedthe well-known story about the man who invited himself to share adrink with the \"invisible\" folk (no. 47.19). In Denmark the physicianOle Worm initiated the collecting of popular traditions with the helpof the clergy. Stimulated by Worm's example, Johannes Bureus,Gustav II Adolph's teacher, began similar efforts in Sweden.Two other interesting works from the period are Jakob Birkerod'sFolketro og Folkeskikk, scerligfra Fyn (Folk Belief and Customs, espe-cially from Fyn, 1734, published by I. M. Boberg in 1936), and ErikPontoppidan's Eveniculum fermenti veteris (Sweeping Out the OldSourdough, 1736, translated from Latin and published by J0rgen Ol-rik in 1923). Whereas Birkerod allows folk traditions to speak forthemselves, Bishop Pontoppidan identifies folk belief with supersti-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"24 Introductiontion analogous to paganism and papism, all of which he wished to\"sweep\" from the minds of his countryfolk.It is not until the nineteenth century that the first self-containededitions of folk legends appear. The great example here is the work ofthe Grimm Brothers in Germany whose Deutsche Sagen (GermanLegends) were published in 1816-18. The Grimms combined literaryand oral sources in their editions. In principle they were committed topublishing the legends in their oral-tradition form, but in fact theyretold many of them in their own style. Following the model of theGrimm Brothers, the Danish librarian J. M. Thiele excerpted legendmaterial from a great variety of literary sources, and he collected oraltraditions; like the Grimm Brothers, he edited his material. The fourvolumes of Danske folkesagn (Danish Folk Legends) were publishedbetween 1818-23. The Grimm Brothers and Thiele in turn inspiredthe Norwegian clergyman Andreas Faye to publish Norske sagn (Nor-wegian Legends) in 1833. Faye reproduced unchanged the legends heculled from literary sources, but he reformulated the texts he collectedfrom oral sources to correspond to the literary style. Faye's primarymotivation was to provide appropriate subject matter for the writersand poets of Norway. J. S. Welhaven, for example, based a numberof his most successful romances on Faye.The Norwegians Peter Christen Asbj0rnsen and J0rgen Moe emu-lated the editorial principles developed by the Grimm Brothers. Theytook a middle position between scholar and traditional storyteller,wishing to preserve intact the texts they collected from their infor-mants but, at the same time, wanting to retell them in a form thatwas acceptable to the educated reader. Thus, while translating thefolktale texts from dialect to the written Dano-Norwegian, they in-corporated not only a great number of proverbs and dialect wordscurrent in folk speech but also reshaped the overall sentence structureto approximate rural Norwegian. Their Norske Folke-Eventyr (Nor-wegian Folktales, 1841-42 and 1852) became the classic collection ofNorwegian folktales. Asbj0rnsen continued the work on his ownwith subsequent editions of Norwegian legends, beginning withNorske huldreeventyr og folkesagn (Norwegian Fairytales [memorats] andFolk Legends, 1845-48, new edition 1859). Asbj0rnsen placed thelegends in the context of fictional frame stories describing Norwegiannature, folk life, and storytelling events. The frame stories were basedon observations made by Asbj0rnsen while collecting oral traditions,but he felt free to recombine his data as he saw fit. Asbj0rnsen'smodel for the placement of the legends within a fictional context was"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Introduction 25Thomas Crofton Crocker's Fairy Legends and Traditions of Ireland(1825), which he encountered in Wilhelm Grimm's German transla-tion of the same year (Irische Elfenma'rcheri).In Iceland, Jon Arnason and Magnus Grimsson published the first,small edition of Islenzk cefintyri (Icelandic Folktales [and legends]) in1852. Six years later the German legal historian Konrad Maurer con-tacted Arnason and Grimsson and encouraged them to continue theirwork, which eventually resulted in the publication of Arnason's Is-lenzkar pjoSsogur og cefintyri (Icelandic Folk Legends and Tales) in1862-64. Konrad Maurer published his own collection of IcelandicLegends in Isliindische Volkssagen der Gegenwart (Icelandic Folk Legendsof the Present, Leipzig, 1860). Arnason collected some texts directlyfrom oral tradition, but most of them were contributed by collabora-tors throughout Iceland, many of whom were his former students atthe Latin School in Reykjavik. Arnason published the texts in theform he received them, but wherever he thought the collectorsdeviated too far from folk speech, he revised the texts accordingly.In the meantime V. U. Hammershaimb had already published thefolk legends of the Faeroe Islands in Fteroiske Sagn (Faeroese Legends,1846), which appeared in the learned Danish journal Annalerfor Nor-disk Oldkyndighed og Historic (Annals for Nordic Archeology and His-tory). It was followed by a general collection of Faeroese folk tradi-tions, including a section on folk legends, published in AntiquariskTidsskrift 1849-51 (Antiquarian Journal, 1852), and another majorwork, Fcerosk Anthologi (Faeroese Anthology, 1891). For Hammer-shaimb collecting folk traditions was closely tied to the effort of for-mulating a written Faeroese language; his collections in fact constitutethe first literary writings in Faeroese. His example was followed byJakob Jakobsen who published Faewske Folkesagn og JEventjr (FaeroeseFolk Legends and Tales) in 1889-1901. In a similar fashion, IvarAasen published collections of Norwegian folk traditions in Pr0ver ofLandsmaalet i Norge (Samples of Dialects in Norway, 1852) to demon-strate the viability of dialect-based Norwegian as a written language.Parallel efforts were made in Sweden and Swedish Finland, wherelegends were published in dialect form, as, for example, in the journalSvenska landsmal och svenskt folklif (Swedish Dialects and Folklife, firstpublished in 1878), as well as in volume 6 of the Swedish-Finnishcollection entitled Nyland 1896).G.

Svend Grundtvig, best known for hiseditions of folk ballads, also collected other materials, which werepublished in Gamle Danske Minder i Folkemunde (Old Danish Tradi-tions, 1854-61). Grundtvig's large, unpublished collections oflegends, which he accumulated between 1839 and 1883, were eventu-ally published by H. Ellekilde in 1944. The teacher Jens Kamp,stimulated by the interest he encountered in folk high school circles,published Danske Folkeminder (Danish Folk Traditions, 1877). A sub-stantial manuscript about folk belief in Denmark was printed posthu-mously in 1943, under the title Dansk Folketro (Danish Folk Belief).No doubt the most prolific collector of folk traditions in Denmarkhas been Evald Tang Kristensen. For more than fifty years, he jour-neyed on foot through most of his home province (Jylland) and faith-fully recorded legends, folk beliefs, tales, songs, and every other im-aginable aspect of the folk culture. During his lifetime he publishedseventy-nine books, in most instances acting as his own publisher.His main collection of Danish legends, Danske sagn (first series,1892-1901, second series, 1928-39), included more than 22,000 texts.Four volumes of the monumental Jyske Folkeminder (Folk Traditionsfrom Jylland, 1871-97), as well as Danske skcemte-sagn (Danish JocularLegends) and Gamle Folks Forttellinger om det Jyske Almueliv (Old Folks'Stories about Life in Jylland, 1891-1902), also contain numerous leg-end texts. In recording the texts from his informants, Kristensen ap-proximated the written norm of Danish, although he colored it withthe folk speech of Jylland. In the beginning, Kristensen did not paymuch attention to the individual storyteller because it was his viewthat the texts represented a collective tradition. But eventually hechanged his mind and began to document the traditions as part of theeveryday life and milieu in which he found them. In Gamle Kildevceld(Old Weil-Springs, 1927), he provided a valuable photographic rec-ord of some of his most important informants. In a new edition ofthis work (1981), the photographic images have been supplementedwith Kristensen's own detailed biographic notes gleaned from his di-aries and other sources.Other legend collections worth mentioning include Udvalgte s0nder-jydske Folkesagn (Selected Folk Legends from South Jylland, 1919) by"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Introduction 27F.

In addition, numerous volumes describing folk life in specificlocalities throughout Denmark have appeared in the series DanmarksFolkeminder (Danish Folk Traditions, 1908).In Norway Andris Eivindson Vang, a schoolmaster in Valdres anda personal acquaintance of Asbj0rnsen, followed the latter's examplein publishing Gamle Regie aa Rispo ifraa Valdres (Old Folktales andLegends from Valdres, 1850), followed by Gamla Segner fraa Valdres(Old Legends from Valdres, 1870). Vang's collections were the first inScandinavia to be published in dialect. Johan E. Nilsen, on the otherhand, followed the model of Ivar Aasen in publishing Sognirfraa Hal-lingdal (Legends from Hallingdal, 1868) in nynorsk (New Norwegian)rather than in dialect.One of the more important collectors of folk belief in Norway wasJoh. Th. Storaker. His earlier materials were published in the journalFolkevennen (The Friend of the People), edited by the sociologist EilertSundt. After Storaker's untimely death at age thirty-five, the re-mainder of his collections was published in the 1920s by Nils Lid.Another important collection is the eight-volume Gamalt or Scetesdal(Old Traditions from Setesdal, 1903-16) by Johannes Skar, whichsurveys the whole gamut of folk traditions in an area that preservedthem intact until quite recently. Setesdal, next to Telemark, has beenconsidered the richest source for the study of folklore in Norway.Skar writes in the dialect of the region he describes.The Norwegian folklorist who can be compared to Evald T.Kristensen in terms of both the quantity of material collected and theapproach is Rikard Berge. Berge also occupies an important place inthe history of Norwegian folklore research. Among his legend edi-tions, we should name Norske eventyr og sagn (Norwegian Folktalesand Legends, collected in collaboration with Sophus Bugge, 1909-13)and Norsk sogukunst (The Art of Norwegian Folk Narrative, 1924). Inthe latter he combines legend texts with broad descriptions of thestorytellers and their milieu.Other important regional collections, some of them up to tenvolumes long, include Tov Flatin's from Numedal, Torkell Mauland'sfrom Rogaland, Andreas M0rch's from Sigdal and Eggedal, SigurdNergaard's from 0sterdalen, Knut StrompdaFs from Helgeland, KnutHermundstad's from Valdres, and Halldor Opedal's from Hardanger.Most recently Olav B0, Ronald Grambo, and Bjarne and 0rnulf"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"28 IntroductionHodne published a new edition of Norwegian legends, Norske segner(1981).Many of the above works were published in the series Norskfolkeminnelags skrifter (Publications of the Norwegian Folklore Society),which, since its inception in 1921, has produced one hundred twentyvolumes. Most of the volumes printed in this series contain legends.Herman Hofberg published the first collection pretending to repre-sent the legend tradition of Sweden. In Svenska folksagner (SwedishFolk Legends, 1882) he aspires to a style that would appeal to abroad, middle-class readership. His language, which is heavily in-fluenced by the romantic literary style of the period, is far removedfrom the idiom of the rural folk. Eva Wigstrom's Folktro och sdgnerfrdn skilda landskap (Folk Belief and Legends from Various Provinces,1898-1914) and J. A. Lundell et al.'s Sagor, sdgner, legender, dventyr ochskildringar avfolkets levnadssdtt pa landsmdl (Folktales, Legends, Saints'Legends, and Folk Life Descriptions in Dialect, 1881-1946) also in-clude traditions from different geographical areas of Sweden, but un-like Hofberg, these collectors reproduce their texts in dialect. Walde-mar Liungman draws upon his own collections, archives, and printedsources to compile the massive Sveriges sdgner i ord och bild (SwedishLegends in Word and Image, 1957-69). Liungman's unfinished workis a bold attempt to systematize the entire Swedish legend tradition.An important scholarly series of folktale and legend editions waspublished by Gustav Adolfs Akademien under the title Svenska sagoroch sdgner (Swedish Folktales and Legends). Twelve volumes have ap-peared so far.Folklorists in Sweden have been as active as those in Norway,compiling regional collections of folk legends as well as other formsof tradition. The most productive folklorist has been Carl-MartinBergstrand, who has published twenty volumes from southwesternSweden. Eva Wigstrom's collection from Skane, Sven Rothman's fromOstergotland, Elias Astrom's from the same region, Elin Storcken-feldt's from Vastergotland, K. E.

An important, recent all-Swedish edition of legends,with up-to-date introductions and commentaries, is Bengt af Klint-berg's Svenska folksagner (Swedish Legends, 1972).The folk traditions of Swedish Finland have been published in vir-tually complete form in Finlands svenska folkdiktning (Finland's SwedishFolk Literature).

Ind-samling, tradition og traditionsmiljo (Icelandic Folk Legends and Tales.Collecting, Tradition and Milieu, 1980).Early Scandinavian research concerning the legend and folk beliefreflected the view developed by the Grimm Brothers that contem-porary tradition constituted the survival of pre-Christian myths. Thisview implied that tradition was progressively disintegrating and be-coming more and more fragmentary. As a consequence researcherswere more interested in reconstructing the beliefs of the past than instudying tradition as an element in contemporary culture.Asbj0rnsen's article on the \"Wild Hunt\" (1852) was probably theearliest example of this tendency. He speculated that the nocturnalriders are the remnants of the pagan gods; but he also suggested thatthey might be the dead — a view that was echoed in the folk belief ofhis time. The achievement of Hylten-Cavallius, whom we previouslymentioned, was that he was the first Scandinavian scholar to place thestudy of folk traditions in their ethnological context.The next important phase in the development of research is iden-tified, on the one hand, with the British anthropological school —inparticular, Edvard Tylor —and, on the other, with the so-calledmythological school identified with Wilhelm Mannhardt and his stu-dents. Tylor applied Darwin's concept of evolution to the phenome-non of religion, tracing its development from animism to monothe-ism, and introduced the term survivals in his influential PrimitiveCulture, which appeared in 1871. Mannhardt argued in Wald- und Feld-kulte (Cults of Forest and Field, 1875-77) that nature spirits werevegetation deities appeased by popular rites and that contemporarycustoms were in fact degenerated fertility rituals of the past. Mann-hardt was the first to use questionnaires as part of a systematic effortto collect folk traditions; he asked Sophus Bugge and Asbj0rnsen todo the same on his behalf in Norway.Tylor, Mannhardt, Andrew Lang, and James Frazer, in whose TheGolden Bough (1890) the concept of fertility rites was applied univer-sally, shaped Scandinavian scholarship for the next two generations.N. E. Hammarstedt investigated various customs from healing meth-ods to bread-baking and Christmas and wedding festivities, applyingthe comparative method of Frazer and especially of Mannhardt. Hen-ning F. Feilberg was mainly influenced by H. Spencer's manisticteaching that the worship of dead ancestors lies behind all religion."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Introduction 31Feilberg is best known for his theory that the origin of jul and the be-lief in the \"invisible\" folk is in the worship of the souls of the dead.His most important works include Jul (1904), Bjcergtagen (Taken intothe Mountain, 1910), Sjceletro (The Soul, 1914, and Nissens Historic(The History of the House Spirit, 1913). On the whole, however,Spencer's influence was greater in Finland (e.g., with Kaarle Krohnand some of his pupils) than in the rest of Scandinavia. In Swedish-Finnish folklore research, the ideas of the sociologist Edvard Wester-marck were of some importance — for instance they influenced GunnarLandtman's work \"Hustomtens forvantskap och harstamning\" (TheRelations and Origin of the Housespirit, 1922), Gabriel Nikander's\"Fruktbarhetsriter under arshogtiderna hos svenskarna i Finland\"(Fertility Rites in the Seasonal Festivals of the Swedes in Finland,1916), and K. Rob. V. Wikman's numerous studies on folk belief. Allthree scholars were critical of the notion of the \"invisible\" derivingfrom a cult of the dead and of the exaggerated emphasis on fertilitycults.In Sweden the ideas of Mannhardt and Frazer were continued byHilding Celander, who, in his Nordiskjul 1 (1928) and other worksdescribes the origin of Christmas as a threshing feast. Also, M. P.Nilsson interpreted the mid-winter celebration as a fertility feast,quoting Snorre's Sagas of the Norse Kings as evidence, but he modifiedCelander's analysis to include the fertility of animals.Another Swede, Ake Campbell, criticized the theory of survivals,however, asking whether all forms of tradition should be interpretedas evidence of an older system of folk belief. Taking the example ofplay and jokes in contemporary tradition, he questioned the hypothe-sis that they represent degenerate forms of originally serious rites.Could not jocular elements be an integral part of tradition at alltimes? (Campbell, 1925, p. 42). These are the beginnings of the kindof source criticism that became central to folklore studies in the twen-tieth century.The most prominent Mannhardtian in Norway was Nils Lid. HisJoleband og vegetasjonsguddom (Christmas Sheaf and Vegetation Deity,1928) and similar works are detailed studies of agricultural customsand beliefs based on the German folklorists' theories. Lid came to theconclusion that the tradition of customs was constant and primary,whereas the underlying beliefs changed with time. Methodologicallyspeaking, Nils Lid combined the approach of ethnology with an em-phasis on etymological studies.An entirely different emphasis is found in the Dane Axel Olrik's"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"32 Introductionstudies of the form of prose narratives. In Nogle Grundscetninger forSagnforskning (Some Principles Concerning Legend Research, 1921),he does not focus on the legend alone, to be sure, because genre anal-ysis had not yet progressed far enough to make precise distinctionspossible. Olrik's primary goal was to establish a morphology ofpopular prose narrative as a whole, including the legend. In NordensGudeverden (The World of the Nordic Gods, 1926-51), Olrik, like thesurvivalists, treated the legend mostly from a perspective of recon-structing a past tradition, in this case, that of myth and heroic legend.Serious criticism of the evolutionist theory of survivals began withthe Swedish scholar Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, who demonstratedthat tradition comprises different genres that are of varying value forthe study of folk belief and must be distinguished accordingly. Aspreviously mentioned, von Sydow introduced the terms memorat andfict, both of which have proved to be highly fruitful in folklore re-search. Von Sydow's distinction of genres was patterned on the mor-phology of species in botany, implying an inner developmentalmechanism — an idea that has since been relinquished. The currentview is that genres are ideal types abstracted from the various formsactually found in tradition. Von Sydow fought the important theoret-ical battles, and his students, notably Gunnar Granberg and AlbertEskerod, applied his theories to detailed analyses of legend and folkbelief.In Granberg's Skogsrdet i yngre nordisk folktradition (The Wood Spritein Recent Nordic Folk Tradition, 1935) the emphasis is not on thequestion of tradition's origin but rather on its relation to the naturalenvironment and its occupational context. Granberg was the first touse statistical analyses to separate collective tradition from personalexperience narratives, as well as from migratory motifs. Granbergmodified von Sydow's concept of the memorat to mean only thosepersonal narratives that describe supranormal experience.Albert Eskerod argues in Arets aring (The Annual Harvest, 1947)that tradition reflects the dominant interests of various economic, age,and social groups. He emphasizes the importance of dividing thesource material into categories of varying usefulness and reliability,distinguishing not only belief, custom, and the various forms of folkliterature but also \"the traditional empirical knowledge supported byactual experiences of nature and the particular character of tools andimplements\" (1947, p. 355). Eskerod defines folk belief ahistorically as\"belief in supernatural, supranormal beings, forces and contexts\"(1947, p. 44). He refutes the theories of Mannhardt and his followers"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Introduction 33concerning vegetation divinities and cults. Eskerod was accused by C.M. Edsman of lacking historical perspective (1949, p. 21-44), but Es-kerod maintains that contemporary belief and custom provide theirown adequate historical explanation. He argues that unless con-tradicted by specific evidence in the older material, we can assume thecontinuity of tradition (1947, p. 31). Eskerod supplants the theory ofsurvivals with a theory of universal origins based on psychologicalfactors actualized in situations of critical importance within the con-text of everyday working life. Eskerod was thus the first to apply thetheories of Malinowski and RadclifFe-Brown to the analysis of Scan-dinavian traditions.In 1952 Eskerod's contemporary, the Norwegian Svale Solheim,published Norsk scetertradisjon (Traditions of Norwegian MountainFarming), a work in which he too places legends and folk belief inthe context of the work experience, but, unlike Eskerod, Solheimpays scant attention to theoretical considerations. He interprets folkbelief as the mirror of social and work conditions. The folk's battlewith a harsh natural environment and social injustices provide the ba-sis for Solheim's analysis.In the study of folk beliefs surrounding healing through magic,three works ought to be mentioned. I. Reichborn-Kjennerud's five-volume Var gamle trolldomsmedisin (Our Ancient Magical Medicine,1928-47) surveys all aspects of magic healing in Norway, in both ahistorical and a systematic perspective. In this instance, however, thetradition is not placed in its social context. The Swede Carl-HermanTillhagen, by contrast, describes the practice of the healer in his socialmilieu in Folklig Idkekonst (The Art of Folk Healing, 1958). LauriHonko's Krankheitsprojektile (Illness Projectiles, 1959) focuses on\"magic shot\" as the cause of illness. Honko treats predominantly theFinnish tradition, but he includes European and non-Europeanmaterials for the purpose of comparison. Honko approaches his studyfrom a historical and psychological perspective.Another work by Lauri Honko, Geisterglaube in Ingermanland (SpiritBelief in Ingria, 1962), continues Eskerod's functional analysis of pre-ternatural traditions in the context of everyday life but is also in-fluenced by Finnish research as exemplified by Martti Haavio. Honkohas been strongly influenced by cultural anthropology, social psychol-ogy, and sociology. He studies the actualization of belief and ritual inthe social context and the consequences this has for the individual.The problem of genre analysis as developed by von Sydow, Gran-berg, and Eskerod is taken up by Honko in the article \"Genre Analy-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"34 Introductionsis in Folkloristics and Comparative Religion\" (1968), in which he de-velops the generally accepted view of genres not as fixed phenomenabut as abstractions, as \"ideal types.\" This view is reflected promi-nently in the work of Brynjulf Alver (1967), Ake Hultkrantz (1968),Bengt af Klintberg (1968), Juha Pentikainen (1968), and MagneVelure (1972).Since the 1920s, Norwegian scholars have been particularly activein discussing the historical legend. In Norske eettesogor (NorwegianFamily Sagas, 1922), Knut Liest01 studies the legend cycle about theSkraddar family from Aseral (Vest-Agder), Liest01's own home vil-lage. After a careful examination of the underlying tradition in formand subject matter, Liest01 concludes that the main events as describedin the legend cycle are in accord with documented history but thatthe reading of these events by the tradition bearers is often nonhistor-ical. These studies were preparatory for a subsequent work, Upphavettil den islandske cettesaga (1929; translated into English as The Origin ofthe Icelandic Family Saga, 1930), in which Liest01 applies the sameapproach in documenting the historical base of the Icelandic saga andthe role of legend tradition as a background to saga literature. RikardBerge, in an article entitled \"Folkesegni og den historiske kritiken\"(The Folk Legend and Historical Criticism, 1922), arrived indepen-dently of Liest01 at the same conclusions regarding the historicity oflegend tradition.Liest01's method was historical rather than folkloristic. Two Nor-wegian historians who were inspired by him, Halvor Nordb0 andLars Reinton, investigated two other cycles of family legends andcame to opposite conclusions. Nordb0 wrote a doctoral dissertationinvestigating family legends in Telemark, AZttesogor frd Telemark(1928), and found them unreliable as historical documents, both indetail and in the overall outline of events. Lars Reinton, on the otherhand, traces the legend cycle about a specific family in Hallingdal dat-ing back uninterruptedly to the 1600s. In Villandane. Ein etterroknad inorsk cettesoge (The Villand Family. A Study of Norwegian FamilyLegends, 1939), Reinton compares legends that were collected be-tween 1860 and 1930 -with historical records and finds them remarka-bly consistent. Brynjulf Alver has suggested that the reason for thenoteworthy agreement between the stories about the Villand Familyand historical documentation may be that they had not yet enteredcollective tradition. This is consistent with Alver's view propoundedin his article \"Historiske segner og historisk sanning\" (HistoricalLegends and Historical Truth, 1962) that the historicity of the legends"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Introduction 35does not rest with the external facts but rather with the interpretationof the events as perceived by the folk. In other words, contrary to thestudents of the historical legend before him, Alver's approach is folk-loristic rather than historical.Alver's methodological perspective is continued by Bjarne Hodnein his doctoral dissertation, Personalhistoriske sagn (Personal-HistoricalLegends, 1973), in which he analyzes legends about known criminalscollected from all parts of Norway, dating from 1672 to 1850.Two other studies to be mentioned here are Kjell Bondevik'sStudier i norsk segnhistorie (Studies in Norwegian Legend Tradition,1948), -which investigates among other things the Battle of Kringen in1612 between Norwegians and Scotsmen, focusing on traditional mo-tifs such as the device of rolling logs on the enemy, and Olav B0'sHeilag Olav i norsk folketradition (Saint Olav in Norwegian Folk Tradi-tion, 1955), which studies the far-flung traditions about the Nor-wegian national saint.The growing interest in legend study during the 1950s led to aninternational discussion about the need to develop national as well asinternational legend indexes. In Scandinavia two important indexeshave been developed, one by the Norwegian Reidar Th. Christiansen,which covers the more common Norwegian legends of the migratorytype (The Migratory Legends, 1958), and the other by Lauri Simon-suuri, which focuses on Finnish legends but also includes German andScandinavian material (Typen- und Motifverzeichnis der finnischenmythischen Sagen [Catalog of Types and Motifs of Finnish MythicalLegends, 1961]). Carl-Herman Tillhagen played a major role in theinternational work with legend typologies (1963, 1964), and he tookthe initiative for a comprehensive Swedish legend index, which isnow being compiled by Bengt af Klintberg. The Danish folklorist Vi-beke Dahll has prepared a useful overview of the status of Scandina-vian legend indices and typology in Nordiske sagnregistre og sagnsystema-tik (Nordic Legend Catalogs and Legend Systemization, 2d edition,1973).Recently folk belief and legend research has tended toward theanalysis of sociocultural patterns exemplified through detailed ana-lyses of specific complexes. The English school of anthropology iden-tified with Mary Douglas and others has been a major influence here.Examples of Scandinavian research along similar lines include Ann-Helene Skjelbred's Uren og hedning.

The New Mother in Norwegian Tradition, 1972), inwhich she discusses the traditionally ambivalent attitudes toward con-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"36 Introductionception and childbirth; Jonas Frykman's Horan i bondesamhdttet (TheWhore in Rural Society, 1977), a historical study of the position ofthe unwed mother; and Orvar Lofgren's \"Fetstromming och lusmor-tar\" (Folk Beliefs and Cognitive Systems among Swedish PeasantFishermen, 1975), as well as his dissertation, Fdngstman i industrisam-hdllet (Fishermen in Industrial Society, 1977), in which he analyzesfolk belief and worldview in a small fishing community in southernSweden. Both Frykman and Lofgren are less interested in folk beliefitself than in how tradition reflects social realities.Another dimension of this perspective concerns the role of folk oralternative medicine in contemporary society. Folk medicine waspreviously studied as a historical phenomenon; now the emphasis hasshifted to the question of why large segments of the population todaycontinue to avail themselves of alternative medical practices eventhough a well-developed official health system is available to them.The researchers in the forefront of this line of inquiry have beenBente Alver, Birgitte R0rbye, and Lauri Honko. Recent articles bythese scholars were published in Tradisjon (no. 8, 1978). Further dis-cussions can be found in the book-length study Botare (Healers, 1980)by Alver, R0rbye, af Klintberg, and Anna-Leena Siikala.The continuation of legend tradition in an urban, post industrialsetting has received some scholarly attention in the past few years,mostly in the form of articles by Bengt af Klintberg (1973, 1976),Magne Velure (1979), Carsten Bregenh0j (1969, 1978), ReimundKvideland (1973, 1980), and Hans Ohlsson (1976).Many of the contemporary legends (or urban legends, as they areusually called) are American in origin, but due to modern communi-cations and travel they have become as international as the oldermigratory legends. Modern legends often express a sense of insecurityand frustration with contemporary life, ranging from trivial concernsto more basic social problems. Thus there are legends about thedifficulties people have in dealing with the many new and often ex-otic foodstuffs appearing on the grocery shelves, or about theconflicts arising when members of other races enter a raciallyhomogeneous and exclusive social milieu, or about the culture shockresulting from the increased mobility of modern life, or about thewidespread fear of seemingly uncontrollable and dangerous groupssuch as terrorists, motorcycle gangs, and punks. Many legends ex-press anxiety over modern technology, the rapid pace of socialchange, and the general feeling that people are losing control overtheir own lives. In much of contemporary narrative tradition we see a"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Introduction 37conflict between the progressive internationalization of modern lifeand the need for local identity and territoriality. On the whole theculture mirrored in contemporary legends differs radically from thestable rural world depicted in the older legend tradition.Much of the work done by Scandinavian folklorists during the lastdecade or so has been based on intensive fieldwork. Collecting andsystematizing oral traditions in archives has been central in Scandina-vian folkloristics from the beginning. The historical-geographicalmethod developed by Finnish scholars, for example, required the ac-cumulation of a large body of variants. With the advent of functionalanalysis and social psychology, however, scholars found it necessaryto go beyond the archives into the field and there find the context inwhich tradition functions. One of the problems raised by the in-creased attention to the social role of folklore is that the researcher'sown preconceived notions may be challenged. Thus the shifting focusfrom the literary and structural analysis of texts to the analysis of so-ciocultural values and attitudes expressed in texts may lead to theconclusion that the researcher's theoretical assumptions are too nar-row. In ethnomedical research, for instance, the concept of illness as amalfunctioning —in which the body is analogous to a machine —ispitifully inadequate. This line of research leads to larger existentialquestions, such as, which social factors determine whether we con-sider ourselves healthy, who defines the role of the patient, and howwe should view the interaction between patient and healer. Regardedin this way, folklore studies could lead to a revision of the medicalpractices authorized by the official health care system, a process that isnow beginning in the Scandinavian countries.Whereas earlier research thus focused on diachronic viewpoints,modern folklore studies have turned to synchronic perspectives withfruitful results. It is too early to determine to what degree these per-spectives can be applied to the study of the older legend tradition andfolk belief. However, this much is clear: the concept of tradition itselfhas been significantly expanded to include all aspects of collective cul-ture. Tradition is no longer regarded as an identifiable, separate prod-uct but as a dynamic, continuous process involving everyone. Thisapplies as much to contemporary urban society as it does to thepreindustrial rural past."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"PARTIThe Human Soul"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Part I illustration: The devil carrying offthe soul of a dying man.

Occasionally we come acrossthe cognate of the English term (Danish sjcel, Norwegian sjel, Swedishsjat). By the time the latter was introduced to Scandinavia by mission-aries from England and Germany, almost a thousand years ago, it hadacquired overriding Christian meanings. According to Saint Paul, thesoul is primarily a spiritual element identified with the godhead andtherefore dichotomous to the physical self. The term hug, by contrast,does not imply any such meanings. Rather, it refers to the mental lifeof the individual — to personality, thoughts, feelings, and desires.There are various and complex conceptions of the hug imbuing thegreater part of Scandinavian tradition, from the medieval literature ofIceland to more recent folk belief and legend. It was believed that thehug could affect both animate and inanimate objects —including otherpeople —either consciously or unconsciously. The deliberate manipu-lation of the hug is the basis of all magic. The hug can manifest itselfinvisibly or it can take on a shape (ham). In some instances, the shapeassumed by the hug has developed into an independent supranormalbeing, as exemplified by the many traditions about the nightmare(mare).Other important projections of the hug include the vord (Swedishvdrd), which is a kind of presence accompanying the individual; thedream-soul, which leaves the body during sleep; the vardoger orfyreferd (Swedish fdrfdt), a visual or auditory experience presaging aperson's approach; and the free-soul, which is the soul sent from thebody in magic flight.4i"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"42 The Human SoulSee Else Mundal, Fylgjemotiva i nonen litteratur (1974); Dag Strom-back, Sejd (1935), and \"The Concept of the Soul in Nordic Tradi-tion,\" Arv 31 (1975), 5-22; Bente G.

He was a wise man, had second sight, and could doamazing things.Once, Eileiv visited a farm in B0. He had a falling-out with a ser-vant girl, and, by the time he left, he was steaming mad. The girl'swooden shoes stood right by the door and Eileiv spat into them.When the folks on the farm discovered Eileiv's spittle, they gave it tothe pig running around in the yard—just for a joke. But as soon asthe pig had lapped up the spittle, it became wild and drunk. It tookoff after Eileiv and finally caught up with him. Eileiv turned around,gave the pig a box on the ear, and said:\"Get yourself home, you aren't the one supposed to come.\"Another time Eileiv was at a dance in Nes. He asked a girl todance with him. She was not too keen on the idea and refused. ThenEileiv threw himself down on a bed, and, before anyone knew whatwas happening, the girl followed him to the bed, took off all herclothes, and lay down beside him. Everyone at the dance was watch-ing. It took quite a while before the girl recovered consciousness. Bythat time, she was really cross. All the people laughed at her and weregreatly entertained.Eileiv the fortune-teller was well known in Telemark, not onlyfor his power of magic but also for his wit. Many legends aretold about him.See 0rnulf Hodne, \"Trolldomssaken mot Spa-Eilev, \"Norveg 24(1981), 7-40.Collected by Kjetil A.

The Evil EyeIt was generally believed that the power of the hug could be trans-ferred to another being or object through sight, touch, or the spoken•word, often -with the intent to do harm. Hence, the expressions evileye, evil hand, evil foot, and evil tongue.3.1 The Bewitched ChildThere was a mother who had a one-year old child. The child wasquite sick, and some knowledgeable folk said it was the English dis-ease. They told her to see a physician or take certain medicines thathad cured other children. But one day a beggar woman came to thehouse, a gypsy of the kind we do not see around much anymore. Sheknew right away what was wrong with the child. Other people werebehind it; the child had been bewitched by the evil eye. The motherbelieved her, because the child had been ill for more than six months.But the beggar knew a cure.She told them to dig a grave on the south side of the cemetery andplace the child in it, naked and on its back, turning it to the east andthen to the west, at high noon. Then they were to fill in the graveand replace the sod exactly the way it had been before.

If this were to happen, the childcould get the English disease or some other sickness, which only awise woman can cure. Even the father of the child, if he were to havean affair with such a woman, could make the child sick just by look-ing at it.In this dite the harmful power of the evil eye is related to an in-fraction against social and moral norms.

EnvyA particularly powerful manifestation of the hug is referred to infolk tradition as \"envy\" (Danish avind, Norwegian ovund, Swedishavund). People feared envy. It was believed that this emotion had astrong, adverse effect on human beings and animals, as well as on in-animate objects.4.1 Envy KillsOld Stina was a dangerous woman. She came to my grandmother'scow barn once to help her with one of the cows that was having acalf. Stina wanted that calf, but she did not get it. A few weeks laterthe calf died, and the cow died soon after. My grandmother was surethat Stina had killed them both with her envy.According to folk tradition, the things most often subject to envyare cattle and the various products of the farm.This memorat was collected in Wilhelmina parish, Lappland(Sweden).

The NightmareThe dream experience commonly referred to as a nightmare wasinterpreted as the visitation of someone's hug. Sexual dreams play alarge part in this context. The mare is usually described as a weight onthe sleeper's chest. Both human beings and animals could be \"ridden\"by the mare.In time the mare developed into a separate supranormal being. Itwas believed that a woman could ease birth pains by crawlingthrough the fetal membrane of a foal. But her offspring would be-come a mare, if female, a werewolf, if male.

LongingAccording to widespread belief, a person could get ill in body andmind from being longed for by someone else. Usually the longing,traditionally called elsk (love), was of an erotic nature. The lovermight be a human or a supranormal being. But even the dead wereknown to impose an elsk on a surviving relative and thereby makehim or her sick, or a living person could long for the dead and keepthe loved one from finding peace in the grave.See I.

Then she threaded a rope througha hole in the -wall and tied a pair of snowshoes to the other end.Whenever she pulled the rope, the snowshoes could be heard scrapingagainst the outside wall. She would pull the rope, without the soldiernoticing it, so he would think that one of the hill folk was after her.You see, when a girl who had the elsk did not give in to a \"hillman,\" she lost her mind —unless she was rescued by a soldier.The \"hill man\" was a supranormal being.

It continued on for a while, until it came to a mound inthe field. It disappeared down inside the mound. The man stood closeby and waited for the vapor to come out again. It was not long be-fore it did. Then it traveled back the same way it had come. The manput his crop across the creek and the vapor passed over it just as itdid before.

But one fine day he recovered and got married. Onemorning his wife asked what he wanted for breakfast.\"You don't have to worry about me,\" he said, \"I'll have breakfastin the woods.\"Toward evening he came home looking ragged and tired. Shethought that he had been drinking.The next day they went out to work in the fields. At noon theman went to the woods. But before he left, he said:\"If a -wolf comes and attacks you, just call my name.\"A while after he left, there came a huge and dangerous-lookingwolf. He attacked the woman, but she called her husband's name. Thewolf changed right before her eyes — and there stood her husbandwith a piece of her dress in his mouth.\"You've done well,\" he said, \"now I am free.\"In some instances, a person became a werewolf only periodically,in others, the transformation was permanent. Freeing the were-wolf by calling the man's name is in keeping with pars-pro-totomagic.

He even pulled on one of thesleeves to show him how it worked.

Thistext suggests two similar rituals whereby one becomes a were-wolf; the first involves the afterbirth of a wolf, the second, awolfskin. There are certain parallels between these rituals of self-transformation and shamanistic practices.See Ella Odstedt, Vamlven i svensk folktradition (1943), 30-57;Nils Lid, \"Til varulvens historia,\" Saga och sed (1937), 3-25.Collected by Knut Strompdal in Velfjord, Nordland (Norway).Printed in Strompdal Gamaltfrd Helgeland 3 (1939), 63.12.7 The Lapp Carried a Belt under His SkinA man went hunting one autumn, after it had snowed.

As early as the fourth century A.D. in storiesabout saints' lives, the midnight mass is celebrated by angels, theblessed dead, and the saint. Another version, possibly based on popu-lar tradition, is found in Gregory of Tours's De gloria confessorum (sixthcentury), in which the midnight mass is attended by the dead and or-dinary people rather than by angels and saints. In folk legends thestory is consistently focused on the fear of the dead and on the nar-row escape of the unwitting observer.See Lutz Rohrich, Sage (1966), 36-38; Brynjulf Alver, \"Dauings-gudstenesta,\" Arv 6 (1950), 145-65; Bernward Deneke, Legendeund Volkssage.

The Revenging DeadSome of the walking dead are considered especially dangerous. Ifthere is an unresolved conflict or crime, or if the grave is disturbed,the dead might seek revenge or demand restitution. If a couple refusesto name their new born child after a particular dead person, he or shemight take revenge on the child itself.

They often quarreled and beat each other.After she died, she walked again and made Andres's life miserable.Every night after he had gone to bed, he could see her through thewindow, walking down the barn bridge, just as she had done whenshe was alive. She came across the yard and through the door, nomatter how well he locked and bolted it. She came right to his bedand squeezed in beside him.So one evening Andres took a big logging ax into bed with him.When his dead wife came back, he raised himself up and struck the axinto the beam overhead.

His daughter did drown, but Gu&mundur was ableto get up on the keel of the boat and hang on.

Thatis where they threw the bones they found when digging up oldgraves.One day a hen disappeared at the minister's place and nobodycould find it. Toward evening an old hand at the farm heard that thehen was missing. He said that he had seen it by the bone house thatday, so he thought it must still be there. Now, nobody would darego to the bone house that late in the evening. But the farmhand saidhe was not afraid. He would go and look for the hen.It got dark. He groped around among the piles of bones as best ashe could, looking for the hen. Suddenly he got ahold of a cold, hardhand. It grabbed him and held on. He pulled and struggled, but couldnot get free. Then he shouted for help.They heard his screams at the farm, and they knew it was urgent,but no one dared go there. Finally the minister took a light and wenthimself. He found the old man beside himself with fright, barely ableto tell him what had happened. The minister thought about it for awhile. Then he got an inkling of what might be going on.\"Is there anyone you have wronged or betrayed in your life?\" heasked.\"Oh, yes; I'm afraid there is,\" said the farmhand. \"When I wasyoung I had a sweetheart.

Johannebore a son, and she wanted to name him Elling after her father. Itwas winter then, during cod season. One stormy day two boats fromUlstein with many fine men on board disappeared at sea. There wasgreat sorrow in the village when it happened.Johanne was not related to any of the men who were lost. None-theless, she was disturbed at night. She thought that she saw a man inan oilskin come into her house and walk over to the cradle where herlittle boy was lying. He was not baptized yet. This happened nightafter night.Johanne went to the woman next door and asked her for help. Hername was Lisbet Osnes.\"Well, I suppose you know what he wants,\" said Lisbet.Yes, Johanne did, to be sure. \"He wants me to name the boy afterhim, but the child is to be christened Elling after my father,\" Johannesaid.\"I'm going to give you some advice,\" said Lisbet. \"Heat up a bak-ing griddle until it is red-hot and put it by the threshold before yougo to bed tonight.\"Johanne did that.

After that he put her un-der a big pile of twigs on Kankomalmen. But she walked again andunhitched the horses. It got so bad that no one could pass by thefarm, nor did anyone dare find out what was going on. Finally theyasked a minister to come. He cut himself at the root of his thumbwith his penknife. He said that he would write in blood whatever shetold him, and then she would stop walking. This is what she an-swered:\"Kavela Eirik murdered me, and I want to be buried in sacred soil.\"She told him that she was under the big pile of twigs.

During her life her husband had treated her badly,and people said more than once that he would get his in return. Andas soon as she was dead, he got it! Almost every night she came andleaned over his bed; and when he went outside, she followed him.She did not do or say anything; she just stared at him. However that"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Dead and the Living 101may be, he almost went mad. He had never been afraid in his life.But now he hardly dared walk outside in broad daylight. Then some-one told him that he should sweep with seven brooms and sow flaxseed all the way from the door of the house down to the road. Thishe did, and ever since then, he has been left in peace.Sowing flax seed around the house, on the road, or by the gravewas a common means of protection against revenants. Flax seedwas also placed in the coffin itself. In popular explanations, theprotective power of the flax stems from the belief that the Christchild was swaddled in a linen cloth made from flax. According toanother explanation, the dead were required to count or pick upthe seeds —a task they were incapable of mastering. The advice tosweep with seven brooms relates to the magic power of thatnumber.See Louise Hagberg, Mir doden gdstar (1937), 626-29; V.

Binding the DeadThe relationship of the living to the dead was always ambivalent,ranging from concern to fear. In many situations fear was the domi-nant emotion, as witnessed by numerous stories about how to bindthe dead to the grave by magic or by mechanical means.See Louise Hagberg, Mir doden gdstar (1937), 622-35.19.1 They Rammed a Pole through Her ChestIn Ris there was an evil woman by the name of Ma-Rams. Shemade a lot of trouble when she was alive and walked again after shedied. Finally she was bound in her grave near Ovsted Church. Thatplace is called Ma-Ram's Hole to this day. People remember a bigwooden pole stuck in that hole. It had been rammed right throughthe body of Ma-Rams. If someone rocked the pole, she would say:\"Move it again and I'll beat you bloody until you're dead.\"But if someone rocked it once more, she would pull him or herdown the hole and wring his or her neck."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"102 The Dead and the LivingSomething similar, by the way, happened at 0stbirk where Slante-Lars, the minister there, bound someone in the grave.There are instances of corpses being bound in the grave with astake rammed through them dating back to the Saxo Grammaticus.And there is evidence that the custom was practiced in Scandina-via during the Middle Ages. This is not to be confused with thetradition of placing a pole on the coffin if the minister could notbe present at the burial; it would be removed later, when he per-formed the rite of throwing soil on the coffin.See Saxonis Gesta Danomm (1931-57), bk. 1, chap. 8.3, bk. 5,chap. 11.4; Gunnel Hedberg, \"Straffredskap,\" KLNM 17 (1972),column 284; Louise Hagberg, N'dr doden gdstar (1937), 634-35;Bjarne Hodne, A leve med doden (1980), 123-24.Collected by E.

Then the dead had to stay where he or shebelonged.According to Christian belief, the soil thrown on the coffin sym-bolizes that the body is transitory. But the folk also interpretedthe act as a magic ritual designed to bind the dead to the grave.The magic aspect was strengthened if a relative secretly threwsome dirt on the coffin, too.See Louise Hagberg, N'dr doden gdstar (1937), 398-400.Collected by Johan Skrindsrud in Nord-Etnedal, Oppland(Norway).

When he died, no one,neither man nor woman, wanted to ready the body and wrap it in ashroud. Even so, there was one woman who said she would give it atry. She was about half done when she went out of her mind. Thenanother woman volunteered, but she did not pay any attention tohow the corpse carried on. When she was nearly finished, Finnursaid:\"You haven't bitten the thread from the needle yet.\"She answered:\"I'll break it, not bite it, damn you,\" and snapping the thread fromthe needle, she broke the needle into several pieces and stuck theminto the soles of the corpse's feet.There is no mention that he ever did anyone else harm after that.According to Hagberg, in Sweden it was believed that one shouldnever put the pins that hold the shroud together between one'steeth. Perhaps the dead sorcerer would have walked again orgained power over the woman, if she had done so.

An infant who had lost its mother was morelikely to get sick or fail to develop normally. This was often ex-plained as resulting from the dead mother nursing the child.

And nobody could sleepin the farmer's bed; those who slept there after his death were alwaysfound dead the next morning.One time, a man came and asked if he could stay there.

Next he went inand got into the bed.

Murdered ChildrenA major group of \"walking dead\" tales relate to murdered children.The terms utburd (Norwegian) and utboling and utkasting (Swedish)have their background in the pre-Christian custom of exposing un-desired, weak, or misshapen children so that they would die. Othernames indicate the manner in which the dead manifests itself, for ex-ample, by shouting. In recent tradition we hear about children bornout of wedlock, killed, and hidden in the house or somewhere out-side. Swedish statistics from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesshow that murder of infants was the most common form of homi-cide. Legends often tell how the dead child is discovered and the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"H4 The Dead and the Livingmother brought to punishment, thus enforcing the sanction againstextramarital pregnancy.The legends reveal two strata of different ages. The older layerpoints to the concept of baptism as the decisive means of salvation.This is apparent in the legend type most frequently found in Norwayand western Sweden in which the murdered child screams untilsomeone baptizes it. Later it became more important that the dead beburied in sacred ground, and this is reflected in the child complaininguntil taken to the cemetery. Another means of ridding oneself of theutburd, one which did not concern itself with the spiritual welfare ofthe child, however, was simply to burn the remains of the murderedinfant.See Louise Hagberg, Ndr doden gastar (1937), 558-71; Juha Pen-tikainen, The Nordic Dead-Child Tradition (1968), and \"The Deadwithout Status,\" Temenos 4 (1969), 92-102; Jonas Frykman, Horani bondesamhallet (1977); Bo Almquist, \"Norska utburdsagner ivasterled,\" Norveg 21 (1978), 109-19; Atlas over svensk folkkultur II.Sagen, tro och hogtidssed 2, edited by Ake Campbell and Asa Ny-man (1976), 94-101.25.1 Baptizing Murdered ChildrenIn Her0yvika by Korsnes there is a rather large pond they call themillpond. Once a mill stood there on the hill. The millpond washaunted in the old days. Folks saw little boys walking around thepond and people driving past heard children crying in the woods.Late one evening a woman was walking from Tysnes to Korsnes.When she came to the millpond, she heard the same strange voicesmany others had heard before her. They whimpered and cried sopainfully. She listened for a while, but then she understood what itwas. She said loudly and distinctly so that it echoed in the forest:\"I baptize you Sigrid or Jon, in the name of God the Father, Godthe Son, and God the Holy Ghost.\"As soon as she had said those words, it was silent, and since thennobody has noticed any ghosts at the millpond.Because it was impossible to know whether the utburd was a boyor a girl, it was important to include both a boy's and a girl'sname in the baptismal formula. Most often they are Anna (Johan-na) and Jon, which are the names given in the liturgical text ofthe Catholic baptismal formula."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Dead and the Living 115See Juha Pentikainen, The Nordic Dead-Child Tradition (1968),217-21.Legend type: ML 4025.Collected by Johan Hveding in Tysfjord, Nordland (Norway).Printed in Hveding, Folketru ogfolkeliv pa Hdlogaland (1935), 73.25.2 \"The Bucket Is Tight\"There was a girl who killed a child in secret and stuffed the bodyinto a bucket.

By the way, it was customary in earlier daysto take a newborn calf inside.The shoemaker sat for a while, sewing. Just then a little one ap-peared.

Then it began to wail in the bucket.\"Take out the pin, take out the pin,\" it screamed.But they only stoked the fire until it was all burned up.You see, it was like this: the farmer had gotten the servant girlpregnant and when the child came, they killed it and put it in thebucket and hid it at the foot end of the servant girl's bed so that itcould not get out.

There was a poor farmhand atthe parsonage nicknamed Pisli. She took a stocking leg from him, putthe child into it, and then buried it. Some time later the same womanmarried, and they held a big wedding. While they were dancing thebridal dance, the dead child came rolling in in a stocking leg, jumpedinto the ring and sang:My mother wears gold.I am dancing in wool.I am dancing in Pisli's stocking leg.Then he rolled in front of his mother's feet, but she fainted andwas carried out, and there was a hasty end to the wedding.The dead child is referred to in Faeroese tradition as ni agrisur,which literally means \"pig from below.\" The term is also used inreference to house spirits.A stocking leg is a special kind of footless stocking used onthe Faeroe Islands.The fact that the verse sung by the dead child is in Danishrather than in Faeroese suggests that the legend originated inDenmark.

But af-ter a while, he got tired and wanted to quit.Yet they danced until the cocks started crowing. He did not hearanything, but she said:\"Now crows the white cock, but we don't give a damn!\"He was really tired now, and his clothes were dripping with sweat.But when the cock crowed the second time, she said:\"Now crows the black cock; I am still dancing with you, Morten!\"And when the cock crowed for the third time, she said:\"Now crows the red cock; now the dead return into the earth!\"Suddenly the woman disappeared, and he was all alone. But whenhe looked around, he had no soles left on his boots or on his socks,and he had nearly danced the skin off his feet.This man's name was Morten Jakobsson. His grandson Jakob Tua-son told us this story when we were children. He said that it hadhappened to his grandfather.

Healing HumansThe various activities of the healer were based on the conceptionthat sickness is of supranormal origin, caused either by a preternaturalbeing or by a person having special powers. A basic condition ofhealing was to discover the supranormal origin of sickness. The heal-ing process involved the use of both magic formulas and rituals.See I.

She had a neighbor named Berte Oddsdaughter. Bertewas suffering from severe back pain, and she went to Kari to seek ad-vice.

One day the horses shied, and she broke her leg. Inthose days there were only village healers, and she had to go to oneof them to have her leg fixed up.Kristensen took the girl to Jens Kusk in Smidstrup. When they gotjust west of Smidstrup, he said:\"Now if we can only find that lazy fellow at home.\"But when they got to the house, they found Kusk there, and hesaid to them:\"Well, it's a good thing you found this lazy fellow at home.\"Kristensen and the servant girl did not like the sound of that, fornow they understood that he was a little too clever for them.To take care of the girl, Kusk put a salve on her leg and tied it upas best he could. Then he prepared a stick, put salve on it, tied it up,and put it away in the loft.\"Well, now you can go home,\" he said. \"You don't need to comeback because I can see from here whether your leg is getting better ornot. I can take care of it from here.\""},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Healers and Wise Folk 133The derogatory reference to Kusk reflects the ambivalent attitudeof the community toward the healer, and Kusk's ability to over-hear people at a great distance demonstrates the healer's specialpowers.

Sometimes mymother saw a little woman walk past the window, but she wouldvanish near the door. Whenever that happened, the child would getcramps.My family looked around for a wise woman and finally got holdof someone from Vendel. The woman's name was Edel. She lived inAjb01, which is part of Vestervig parish. When she visited us, shetook a spoon and struck it three times on the table in front of theboy. Then she said:\"There is only one thing we can do.\" She turned to my father.\"Dig a hole in the northwest corner of the dike at Kalgu, just bigenough for the child to pass through. Then take the child's shirt andgo to the church between midnight and two o'clock. Pass the shirtthree times through the door handle of the church. When you gethome, make a wooden cross. Then put the shirt on the child, andhaving done that, pull the child through the hole three times. But thelast time your wife pushes the child through, she must throw thecross after the child, and leave it in the hole.\"This was done.

Herfamily sent for the doctor, but he could not help her. Finally, afterthree physicians had been consulted and were unable to do anythingfor her, the merchant sent for Olav Huse. The messenger rode sohard that he almost ruined the horse. But even so, by the time hereturned with Olav, the girl was nearly dead.\"I really have no business being here since you already have threedoctors,\" said Olav when he came in through the door.\"If you can help her, just hurry up and do it,\" said the physicians.\"We can't help her,\" they said.Olav rushed to the girl and pinched the wound together. Thebleeding stopped immediately and the girl recovered.Olav demanded five dollars in payment, but the merchant gavehim three hundred dollars because he had saved his daughter's life.The story is focused on the implicit faith in the ability of thehealer, which at times was thought to exceed even that of thelearned physician."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Healers and Wise Folk 135See, for a general description of the traditions and techniquesof stopping bleeding, I.

Thenone should wash the wound three times. After doing so, one wouldbe healed —usually, that is.Human breath, blood, saliva, urine, and other bodily secretionswere thought to possess healing power.

In folk tradition aswell as in learned tradition dating back to ancient Egypt, pictorialmagic and exorcisms were used to force a thief to return stolen goodsor to punish him or her, usually by striking out his or her eye.

Wind and WeatherGiven the changeable and often difficult climate in northern Scan-dinavia, it is not surprising that control of wind and weather wouldbe a major concern of the practitioners of magic. Fishermen andsailors employed the services of wise folk to make favorable sailingwind. But beyond that, people quite commonly made use of spellsand rituals to influence the weather.32.1 Three Knots in a HandkerchiefA crew once sailed to Sweden with the very same ship that is lyingin Tranjonkarr right now. The skipper wanted to sail back, but theygot head -wind. A fellow came along, however, who had a handker-chief which he had tied into three knots.

The TricksterBesides healers and other wise folk, we encounter in oral traditionindividuals who possess the ability to hypnotize others. In most in-stances, these tricksters used their skills for entertainment whereverpeople gathered.33.1 Maliser-KnutThere was a man named Maliser-Knut who understood the art ofhypnosis. Once he was at a farm where a lot of people had gathered.They challenged Maliser-Knut to crawl inside a log that was lying inthe yard. If he could do it, he would get a reward. But if he failed, hewould get a beating from all the people who were watching.Everybody gathered around, full of curiosity. They really thoughtthey saw Maliser-Knut disappear into the log. It was slow going atfirst. He drilled for a long time before he got his head inside the log.But once his head disappeared, the rest of his body slipped in quickly.It was actually nothing but an optical illusion; in reality he wascrawling along the outside of the log.But now it happened that a woman came to the farm, leading acow. She did not see Maliser-Knut until she was standing next to theothers, so he did not have time to hypnotize her. The woman startedto laugh."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"154 Healers and Wise Folk\"What are you standing here gaping at?\" she asked. \"What is so in-teresting about a man crawling back and forth on a log?\"When the others heard that, they got angry, and of course theystruck Maliser-Knut. But he took revenge on the woman. He hypno-tized her so that she believed she had come to a river, and the farthershe went, the higher she thought the water was rising. The womandid not want to get wet, so she lifted up her skirt. The higher shethought the water rose, the higher she lifted, until finally she waswalking with her skirt all the way up under her arms. You can im-agine how people were grinning because the woman was really walk-ing on dry ground!Maliser-Knut was a man that no iron would hold. He was put inprison several times, but he got out every time. They eventuallycaught him and put him in a prison tower and erected a spiked fencearound it. Knut managed to slip out of the irons that time, too. Hetore his clothes into strips, tied them to a rope, and lowered himselfdown from the tower. But the rope was a little too short, so he hadto jump. He had the bad luck to get hung up on one of the spikes.The guard found him there in the morning. The people wanted totake him down, but he asked to be allowed to hang there in peaceuntil he died, and they let him. That is how Maliser-Knut ended hislife. He is supposed to have lived in southern Norway, and what hasbeen told here is only a small part of the stories about him.People obviously enjoyed being entertained but resented it whenthey were made the butt of the entertainer's tricks. The storydemonstrates the exposed position of the outsider in traditionalsociety.Collected in'1924-25 by Knut Strompdal from Eliseus Loms-dal, Velfjord, Nordland (Norway).

There was a smith whocould take off his head and put it on the table to shave it.It happened in Akersberg. We were sitting in the bunkhouse —some of the drivers and a few others —when the smith came in.\"One has to make oneself pretty for the weekend,\" he said.So he took off his head and put it on the table. We all saw it. Itwas the most awful thing any of us had ever seen."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Healers and Wise Folk 155The smith had a son. I asked him whether he could do any of thetricks his father did.\"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"I've taught myself, but I don't want to haveanything to do with it.\"He drank a lot, that smith. One day he was drunk and the masterstruck him in the face. His head tumbled off his shoulders and rolledunder the sofa. The master got scared and ran away. No wonder!Later on the smith didn't greet the master the way he was supposedto, and the master admonished him to do it properly. Then the smithtook off his head and put it under his arm. From then on, he did thiswhenever he met the master.I suppose he hypnotized people. If I had not seen it myself, Iwould never have believed it. Let me see, it all happened between1869 and 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War.A smith was often thought to possess magic powers. Also, hisskills as a craftsman made him indispensable. The interest of thislegend rests not only on the skill of the trickster to entertain hisaudience but on his ability to make a fool of his superiors withimpunity. Thus the narrative functions as a kind of protestagainst social privilege.See Carl-Herman Tillhagen, Jdrnet och mdnniskorna (1981),195-220.Collected in 1926 by Margit Sjoberg from Valfrid Wijk,Beateberg parish, Vastergotland (Sweden).

In Elder Edda andin Snorri's Saga of the Ynglings, skills attributed to the god Othin areessentially the same as those identified in later tradition with the prac-titioners of magic, notably shape changing, magic flight, and the useof spells to control the elements and conjure the dead. A specially po-tent and malevolent form of magic was referred to as seidr. It wasused to rob its victims of their sanity, their health, even their life, andgenerally to cause misfortune.The church rejected the notion of supranormal powers as illusory andpassed numerous laws forbidding belief in witchcraft. Eventually the pop-ular view regarding the witch was incorporated into official theology,however. Thus, according to the preamble to Malleus Maleficarum (TheWitches' Hammer, 1486), the greatest heresy is not to believe in the powerof the witch. Malleus Maleficarum was devised to identify witches andbring them to trial by a court of inquisition. In it numerous legends fromrecent folk tradition are cited as evidence concerning, for example, thewitches' sabbath, the use of a familiar to steal milk, the passing of magicskills from mother to daughter, et cetera. The notorious witch trials in Eu-rope, from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries, and in Scandinavia,from the end of the Reformation to the early eighteenth century, rein-forced folk belief in the witch and her powers.See Bente G.

Revenge and EnvyOne of the stronger driving forces behind magic is the desire tobend others to one's will. Characteristically, harmful magic has itsorigin in feelings of envy and anger. Often individuals occupying lowpositions in society, the poor in general but also itinerant beggars andstrangers — for instance, Lapps, Finns, and gypsies —used magic toforce others to share with them certain necessities like food and lodg-ing. People were afraid the gypsies would take revenge if they weredenied. This mechanism was generally employed to explain sickness,accidents, and other misfortunes befalling the settled community.See Bente G.

She becamevery ill.One Sunday the old woman went to church to take communion.She forgot to lock her closet. Her husband opened it and looked in-side. In it was a doll that was covered with pins all the way down toits thigh on one side. He pulled the pins out and went to ask the girlhow she was feeling. She was fine!

He found an empty barrel in theyard, turned it upside down, and told the sailor to sit quietly underthe barrel until it was over. Then he poured a few ladles of waterover the bottom of the barrel so that it formed a sort of mirror. Hefetched an old rifle from the house and positioned himself by the mir-ror. That way he was able to see the man in Osterbotten gettingready to shoot the sailor.\"Can you see him?\" asked the sailor in the barrel. He was gettingnervous about how it would all end.\"Yes, now I can see him,\" answered Holmstrom. \"He's just comingout on the stairs with a gun in his hand. But I'm going to be the oneto shoot first.\"And then he fired into the air.\"Did you hit him?\"\"Yes. Now you can crawl out from under the barrel. He droppeddead on the stairs,\" said Holmstrom.Conjuring up the image of an adversary in a mirror or on a sur-face of water was a common device in magical practice. Byshooting or stabbing the image, the magician could harm or evenkill. The present narrative deviates from this common pattern in-asmuch as Holmstrom sends a magic shot by firing into the airrather than into the mirror image.See Carl-Herman Tillhagen, \"Finnen und Lappen als Zauber-kundige in der skandinavischen Volksuberlieferung,\" Kontakte undGrenzen (1969), 135-36; Nils Lid, Trolldom (1950), 149.Collected in Pa'rna, Nyland (Finland).

He knocked on the door, and a prettyyoung girl came out. He greeted her, and she threw her armsaround him and wept for the joy of seeing someone —she said thatshe had thought she was the only one left alive. She asked him tostay with her, and he said he would. They went inside then andtalked at length together. She asked where he had come from andwhere he had been headed. He told her about everything and aboutthe fact that he had to be back before Christmas. She asked him tostay with her as long as possible. He felt so sorry for her that hepromised to do so. She told him that in those parts no one was leftalive—she had traveled from her home for a week in every direc-tion and had found no one.When it was getting close to Christmas, the man from Vestman-naeyja wanted to leave. The girl begged him to stay and said that hiscompanions could not be mean enough to make him suffer for keep-ing her company, all alone as she was. He let himself be talked intostaying, and soon it was the day before Christmas. Now he meant togo — no matter what she might say.

Food MagicIn Snorre Sturlusson's Prose Edda, the god Thor magically reconsti-tutes the flesh of the goats he has slaughtered for his evening meals.Therefore he forbids his retainers to break the bones of the animalthat is eaten.In later folk tradition, it is the witch who magically replenishesfood —usually herring. But people feared they would become thinnerand thinner if they were fed the same food over and over again. Forthis reason it was considered a good precaution to break the bonewhen eating herring.See Bente G. Alver, Heksetro og trolddom (1971), 181-82.37.1 Ragnhild BlikkaRagnhild lived on Blikka, a large and beautiful farm in a cleft highup in the mountains, quite a bit north of the other farms in Svartdal.Ragnhild was known for her wealth and for her witchcraft. Her hus-band was named Gisle. He could do witchcraft too, people said.In springtime when people were spreading manure on the fieldsdown in Flatdal, Ragnhild would stand in her yard at home and con-jure every bit of their manure onto her own fields on Blikka. In thefall the fields on Blikka were so beautiful that no one had seen thelikes of it. But the fields on Flatdal were thin and scrawny.Once Ragnhild had a serving boy. She had always been stingywith food. Every day when the boy was sent out to tend the live-stock, she gave him a herring wrapped in a slice of bread. She ad-monished the boy that he must never break the herring bone. Theboy did as he was told, and every evening he came plodding homewith the bone in his food bag. But finally he realized that it was thesame herring he ate every day, which always seemed like new thenext day. Finally he got tired of that fare, and one day he broke thebone.And in the evening, he found that Ragnhild's back was broken,too.This follows the belief tradition that the material projections ofthe witch's power are identified with her person; breaking theherring bone is tantamount to injuring the witch.Collected by Kjetil A.

Stealing MilkPeople believed that if their cows gave little or no milk, or if theyhad poor success in churning, it was because envious neighbors usedwitchcraft to steal from them.

A woman in Kvitseid owed himmoney for some goods.One evening he thought he would go to her and collect. When hecame to a river, which ran a little way from her house, he saw thewoman sitting below a waterfall in the river. She was churning sothat the cream spouted high in the air. Hallvor pretended not to no-tice anything but went straight to her farm and waited there.After a while the woman arrived, carrying a big and beautiful pieceof butter under her apron.Hallvor stated his purpose, but the woman told him that she didnot have any money and asked whether she could pay with somebutter. Sure, he was satisfied with that and took the piece of butterthe woman had brought from the waterfall.But Hallvor of course suspected that there might be some witch-craft involved. To find out whether butter was made by a witch, onehad to cut into it with a knife that had been used to kill a person. If itwas witch butter, blood would run from the blade. There was a knifelike that at Laupedalen in Brunkeberg. Hallvor borrowed it and testedthe butter.When he cut the butter with the knife, he clearly saw that bloodran from the edge. So there was no doubt about what kind of butterhe had gotten.Nevertheless, Hallvor took the butter to town and sold it there.And he never heard any complaints about it.In this instance churning by magic is made particularly dramaticby having it take place in a waterfall. But the story can be viewedas an example of decaying tradition. Even though the peddlerknows full well that the butter was churned by witchcraft, he ac-cepts it in payment and sells it at the market in town. His greedoutweighs his fear.See Bente G.

She was very anxious about the shavings from thebrush he cut. She told him to pick up every bit and not to lose any ofit. But after eating dinner on Thursday nights, Lispet would take theshavings away. The boy often wondered what she wanted with them.So one evening he peeked in through the window. He wanted tosee what she would do with the shavings. She rolled them into a ball,took a knife, cut her little finger, and let three drops of blood fallonto the shavings. Then she threw the ball across the floor and said:\"Now I have given you flesh and blood. May Old Nick give youpower and life.\"Then the ball of shavings became a troll cat, and it ran away.The folk believed that the witch created the troll cat from humanhair, nails, wood shavings, and the like.Belief in the troll cat is connected with the observation of cer-tain accumulations of matter, usually hair, passed from thestomachs of cattle (aegrophilae). Once this matter had dried onthe ground, it was easily rolled across the yard or fields by thewind, giving the impression of a running animal.In this text Lisbet Nypan (cf. no 37.2) appears as LisbetSnipann.See Bente G.

Her namewas Marte, and she was one of the most notorious witches in all ofSouth Fron. She had the Black Book and a troll cat.A troll cat is gray and round like a ball of wool, and it rolls alongthe ground. It sucks milk from the cows and sneaks into the housesto steal cream. When the troll cat sucks itself too full, it slobbers allover, and the spilled cream turns to gray paw butter, which peoplealso call troll cat vomit and troll cat butter. One can see it on theground in the morning after a foggy night; it covers planks and logsin the fields where the troll cat has run during the night.You can force the owner of a troll cat to reveal herself if youknow how! You take a little of the troll cat butter, put it down a gunbarrel, and close it up well. Then you place the barrel into the fireuntil it starts glowing, and the owner of the troll cat comes rushingin and is terribly thirsty. Have something ready for her to drink, andwhile she is drinking, you must hit her with something sharp tomake her bleed. If you do not manage to draw blood, she will takerevenge.One time things were going badly with the cows at Tofte. Therewas no milk, and the cows were restless at night. Folks found trollcat vomit outside the barn, so it was easy to see what was happening.Hans Tofte said he would take care of it; he would burn the vomit.He collected some and stuffed it into the barrel of a gun, closing it uptightly. He got a man to go with him to the smithy. It was fouro'clock in the morning. They made a fire in the forge, put the gun"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"178 Witchcraftbarrel in it, and pulled the bellows to get a good draught going. Be-fore long they could hear noises coming from the barrel, it bangedand whimpered and whistled, and the men were quite frightened. Allof a sudden Marte Holon came into the smithy, her shirt hanginghalfway off her shoulder. I guess she did not have time to put it onall the way. Sweat was dripping off her, and she asked for somethingto drink. They had collected their own piss into a horn, and theyoffered this to her. Then Hans quickly took off his left shoe and hither across the mouth so that two teeth fell out and blood flowed.It is not easy to say whether it was Marte herself or her double.But when she left, she flew through the air over Tofte valley. Shewas riding on a broomstick, and there was a trail of sparks comingfrom the broom.This must be the truth, too, because my grandmother once metMarte, and she saw that Marte was missing two of her front teeth.The gelatinous substance of certain fast-growing fungi (fuligoseptica), as well as the white foam left by the spittle bug, wereoften associated with the droppings of the troll cat.Since the witch was identified with her troll cat, heating the\"vomit\" would make her thirsty and force her to appear. Draw-ing the witch's blood broke her power.It seems risky to offer one's urine to a witch. Tradition, how-ever, is rarely self-consistent. Also, offering urine as a drink canbe seen as an insult, and insults often play a role in countermagic.See Svale Solheim, Norsk scetertradisjon (1952), 315-16.Collected by Edvard Grimstad in Fron, Oppland (Norway).Printed in Grimstad, Etter gatnalt.

When he found them, he saw that a carri-er, gray in color, was hanging at the udder -of his best cow and wassucking her dry.The carrier darted away at the farmer's approach, and he chased iton horseback. But it ran straight past some mounds and jumped overothers, until it got home. There were some people out in the field,and the carrier dashed under the skirts of the farmer's wife.

The Witches' SabbathAccording to folk tradition, witches met the devil on Blakollen(Blue Mountain), in churches or in other places to celebrate the sab-bath. This belief had its origin in the witch trials on the continent,where such events were considered to be factual. Bente Alver haspointed out that the legendary tradition of the witches' sabbath inNorway contains little of the sexual perversity we find in continentalprotocols. Nor are the activities of the witches actual parodies of theChristian mass. Throughout Scandinavia the motif that dominateslegends about the sabbath is that witches write their names in thedevil's book, share a festive meal with him, and dance on the altarand pews.See Bente G. Alver, Heksetro og trolddom (1971), 209-19; Will-Erich Peuckert, \"Der Blocksberg,\" Verborgenes Niedersachsen (1960),103-10.40.1 Steinar AaseSteinar Aase, who lived in Brunkeberg around 1700, heard peoplesay that every Easter night witches came to the church to scrape rustand copper off the church bell. One night before Easter, he hid him-self in the church to find out whether this rumor about the witcheswas true. He had two pieces of sod, one to stand on and one to puton his head, so that the witches would not be able to see him.Toward midnight three women came in, each riding on a broom-stick. They clambered on the pews, from one pew to the next, all theway up to the altar. There the witches started to scrape the candle-stick, and then they climbed the tower to get to the bell. It seemed toSteinar that he recognized them, and he was so eager to get a goodlook that he did not hold on to the sod on his head, and it fell on thefloor. Now it was all over for Steinar. When the witches caught sightof him, they surrounded him and tore at him as if they were going toeat him alive. Now he could plainly see who the three women were.One was his own mother, another was the wife of the minister atKvitseid, and the third was a rich and respectable woman fromMorgedal. They hissed and shouted at Steinar, and it looked as if hewas going to get his fill of their fun! None was worse than his ownmother. She was quite ready to kill him. She put a finger into each ofhis nostrils and hung him out of a peephole in the church tower. Stei-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Witchcraft 181nar begged for mercy and promised that he would never tell a livingsoul about what he had seen. So they let him go.Easter morning Steinar was back at the church. When the servicewas over and the people came outside, Steinar walked over to an oldgravestone, kicked it, and said:\"Something happened to me last night, which I have solemnlypromised not to reveal to a living soul, and I will keep my promise.But I can safely tell it to you, because you're nothing but a stone andcan keep quiet like a stone.\"Then he recounted everything, from beginning to end, so that theminister and his wife and the whole parish heard it.\"I knew that I was born of sinful blood, but I didn't know that mymother was a witch,\" he finished.The preferred dates for the witches' sabbath were the night beforeEaster, Midsummer Night (Saint John's Eve), and Valborg's Eve.The witches were usually reported to ride to the sabbath onbroomsticks, on animals, and even on human beings changed intoanimals.Steinar becomes invisible by placing pieces of sod on his headand under his feet. Symbolically, then, he is underground, that is,dead.The majority of individuals sentenced for witchcraft in Scan-dinavia belonged to the lower social classes. In legendary tradi-tion the tendency is reversed; members of the immediate familyand respected women in the community are often identified aswitches. This may constitute a form of social protest, even re-venge, by the lower classes.See Bente G. Alver, Heksetro og trolddom (1971), 210-13.Legend type: ML 3050Collected by Kjetil A.

But every Easter eve,the mill burned down and nobody knew why. Finally the farmerhired a young man to keep watch at the mill on the night beforeEaster.In the evening he hid himself in the mill. Early that night the windstarted howling, and he heard voices outside the mill. Then the doorflew open, and a great many -women came riding in on broomsticks.Four of them carried a young girl on a calfskin; she was going to be"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"i82 Witchcrafta witch too. Behind the girl another woman carried a table and achair, and she put them in the middle of the floor. Then one of themsaid:\"The Master hasn't come yet.\"And another one said:\"What is taking him so long?\"Some more time passed, but still the Master did not come. Thenthe women began to get angry because they had so much to do thatnight.Finally the wind started howling again and a misshapen figure en-tered, carrying a book under his arm. It was the Master. The womenupbraided him for being so late, but he excused himself, saying thathe had been busy helping a girl kill her child. Then he put the bookon the table, opened it, and sitting down, asked whether there wereany newcomers to enroll.\"Yes, there is one,\" answered the women.The boy who was hiding in the mill funnel thought they weretalking about him, and he thought it would be wise to make a run forit. When he jumped up, both he and the funnel fell right on theMaster's book and the women. Now they all got scared and took totheir heels with frightful screams. But the young woman who hadnot learned witchcraft yet could not escape. The others were in such ahurry, they left behind not only the girl but also the table, the chair,the calfskin, and the Master's book.Now the book, the table, and the chair began to burn. The boycollected his wits; he covered his hands with the calfskin and threwthe burning things out, thus saving the mill. He took the youngwoman with him for questioning. She confessed that she had recentlymarried and had wanted to learn witchcraft. Four of her neighborshad brought her to the mill to be instructed by the Master.They were all discovered and punished for their witchcraft.The motif of the witches' sabbath in combination with the burn-ing mill is common throughout Scandinavia.

Magic FlightWhereas the Finn messenger achieves magic flight by sending hishug from his body while lying in a trance (cf. nos. 10.1-10.3), the•witch typically uses her own body for flight, or she rides on abroomstick or some other inanimate object, or on an animal, which isoften a human being whose shape she has changed.Popular variants of stories about magic flight involve someone try-ing to imitate the witch's flight but using the wrong formula, oftenwith dire consequences, or someone tricking the witch and ridingupon her instead of the other way around.The witch's power of flight is a function of her pact with the devil.41. i The Serving BoyThere was a wealthy farm in Siback. People said that the mistressof the house was a witch and flew to the sabbath on Easter. The ser-vant boy heard about it, and one Easter night he stayed home towatch her.Toward midnight he saw his mistress get up. She poured somesalve from a horn and rubbed it on herself while she mumbled:\"Up and down, but run into nowhere.\"Then she flew up through the chimney.Now the serving boy wanted to try. He took the horn, rubbedhimself with the salve, smeared a few drops on the fireplace, and said:\"Up and down, but run into everywhere.\"Right away he flew out through the chimney. But he kept crashinginto things until he finally came to a mill somewhere between Sibackand Portom and flew inside. There sat his mistress at the end of a bigtable. At the center of the table sat a gentleman dressed in black,writing in a big book.When the serving boy came in, his mistress asked him how he gotthere.\"Well, he said, \"I rubbed some salve on myself just like you didand said 'Up and down, but run into everywhere,' but I have beencrashing into all kinds of things and now I'm black and blue all over.''\"You should have said 'Into nowhere,' then you wouldn't havebumped into anything at all and would have traveled smoothly.\""},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"184 WitchcraftNow the gentleman in black asked the woman to write her namein the book.

Just sit on it, and it will take you home.\"The serving boy did as he was told, and right away he took offover forests and fields. At home he put the horse into the stable, asthe gentleman had instructed him to do, leaving the saddle blanket onthe horse. The sun was just rising. He went inside and asked his mas-ter to come out and see what a big and fine horse he had gotten onEaster night. When they entered the stable, the master told the boy totake the blanket off so that he could really see the horse. But as soonas the serving boy did this, his mistress appeared in the stall wherethe horse had been.\"Well, well,\" said the farmer, \"so it's you.\"\"Yes,\" she said, \"I've been out on Easter night.\"Well, there was nothing more to be said about it.In a number of legends, the witch rides the serving boy in animalshape to the sabbath, but the boy tricks her into trading places onthe way home.

Hewas newly married, at the time of this story, and had a beautifulyoung wife of whom he was particularly fond. She was in every waythe most exceptional woman thereabouts. There was, however, oneproblem in the marriage, which the minister did not regard as so veryminor: she disappeared every Christmas Eve, and no one knew whatbecame of her. The minister questioned her about this over and overagain, but she told him that it was none of his business. This was theonly thing they disagreed about.A vagrant came along, and he got work in the minister's stable. Hewas not much, with regard to size and strength, but people reckonedhe knew more about this and that than other ordinary folk. Timepassed without anything of interest happening until it was almostChristmas. But on the day before Christmas, this fellow was out inthe barn currying and tending the minister's stall-fed horses. Beforehe knew it, the minister's wife slipped in and started a conversationwith him about various things. And when he least expected it, shepulled a bridle out from under her apron and put it on him. Therewas so much magic power in the bridle that the man was forced tolet the minister's wife get on his back, and he took right off—just likea bird. He traveled over mountains and valleys, cliffs and moraines. Itseemed to him that he was traveling through dense fog. Finally, theycame to a little house. There she dismounted and tied him to a hitch-ing post attached to the wall of the house. The minister's wife wentto the door and knocked on it. A man came out and greeted herwarmly. He took her into the house with him. When they were gone,the man loosened the reins from the post, managed to work himself"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"186 Witchcraftout of the bridle, and stuffed it under his shirt. Then he sneaked upon top of the house and looked through a hole in the thatched roof.He saw twelve women sitting at a table, so, counting the man, therewere thirteen people in all. He recognized his mistress among them.He saw that the women had a great deal of respect for the man andwere in the midst of telling him various things about their tricks andcunning. Among other things, the minister's wife told them abouthow she had ridden a living man there, and the master of the housewas very impressed because it takes the most powerful witchcraft toride a living man. He said that she excelled at witchery, \"because Ididn't know anyone could do that but me.\" The other.women wereall over the master, begging him to teach them this trick. He placedonto the table a book which was gray in color and was written withfire or fiery-colored letters. There was no other light in the room butthe glow that came from the letters. Then the master of the house be-gan to teach the women from this book, explaining its contents tothem —and the man on the roof learned everything the man uttered.It was getting close to daybreak, and the women said it was timeto go. The instruction ended then, and each woman took out a glassand gave it to the master of the house. The man could see that eachglass contained something reddish, which the master sipped beforehanding back the glass. Then they bid him fond farewell and left thehouse. He saw then that each woman had her own bridle and mount.One had a horse's leg, another a jawbone, another a shoulder blade,and so on. Each one took her mount and rode off. But the minister'swife, it must be told, could not find her mount anywhere. She lookedaround the house in a rage, and when she least expected it, the manjumped down from the roof and slipped the bridle onto her. Then hegot on her back and headed for home. He had learned enough duringthe night to be able to steer the minister's wife in the direction hewanted to go. We heard nothing about their journey until theyreturned to the very same stable they had departed from. There theboy dismounted and tethered the minister's wife in a stall. Then hewent into the house and told the news about where he had been andwhere the minister's wife had ended up and how it had all comeabout. Everyone was shocked —not least of all the minister himself.Then the minister's wife was interrogated. She finally confessed thatshe and eleven other ministers' wives had for several years attended aschool of black magic and were taught witchcraft by the devil him-self, and they had only one year of instruction left.

The farmer did not want to have anything to do with themand told them to leave. But they made a circle around the houses andconjured up a great many snakes.If they were permitted to stay there that night, they would drivethe snakes away from the farm again.Oh, yes, they could stay.But the farmer thought it best to keep an eye on the gypsies.Around midnight one of the tramps got up and opened the door.\"Chee, chee, into the cellar!\" he said, and a huge blackbird flew outthe door. Then the tramp laid down again.The next morning things were missing from the cellar, and thefarmer sent for the sheriff. He arrested all the gypsies. Now, I sup-pose, they must have done a lot of evil because they were sentencedto be bled to death. But a little girl was left behind, and she was sentto the minister and stayed there.One time she went with the minister to the fields where the farm-hands were working. There were seven horses on the job.\"Would you believe that I can make the horses stand still so thatnobody can get them moving again?\" she asked the minister.Well, he wanted to see that! She took some rowan twigs that weregrowing on a tree and stuck them into the harness pins. Nobodycould budge the horses until the girl removed the twigs.\"Can you do other things, too?\" the minister asked.\"I can milk the fence post, if I want to,\" said the girl.\"Well, do it then.\"She ran to get a small pail and a bucket, drilled a hole into the postwith her knife, and thrust a pin into the hole. She put the pail under-neath it, and milked the pin until the pail was full. Then she emptiedit into the bucket and milked some more. But suddenly she stopped.\"I'd better stop now,\" she said.\"Milk some more!\" said the minister.\"The cow is going to milk blood.\"\"Let me see,\" said the minister.And the girl milked again until nothing but blood came.

All the Finnswho drifted into the village stopped by her place and stayed with herfor weeks. She was not feeding them for nothing, that big shot!Once she found a white snake. It was a rare stroke of good luck tofind that kind of snake; it has the power to heal all manner of sick-ness. When you boil a white snake, three stars appear in the brine.The first makes you wise and the second gives you second sight, butthe third makes you mad, and it spins around like a wheel.The woman boiled the snake in the usual manner. Then she wentout to the cow shed to take care of her animals. But her daughterMargit was alone in the house. She saw the pot sitting there, and be-ing a child, she thought that it was broth. She took a piece of bread,dipped it into the pot, and got hold of the star that gives you secondsight. When she had eaten the bread, she could see right through sol-id walls.She ran down to her mother in the shed and shouted happily:"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"190 Witchcraft\"Now I can see the color of the calf Golden Rose is going tohave!\"\"Oh, heaven help me, child, you haven't touched the pot?\" criedthe mother. She knew how much Margit would suffer if she had sec-ond sight.And Margit did suffer. She saw all the evil that happened aroundher in the village. A man drowned at Svinesodden, and Margit saw it.She was almost beside herself with terror, screaming and moaningthat someone should go and help the man.She did not get any sleep night or day because of all the things shesaw. In the end she nearly lost her mind. But luckily one of the Finnscame to the farm. When she heard what was the matter with the girl,she took second sight from her and scattered it to the four winds.The white snake has been looked upon as a purely mythical motifbut also as referring to a rare type of snake (coronella austriaca)found in southern Scandinavia. The motif has found literary ap-plication as far back as Eddie tradition, for example, in the storyof Sigurd the dragon slayer, who gains the power to understandthe speech of birds by drinking the blood of the snake. In folktradition it is the broth that carries the magic power. The abilityto see the unborn calf is the motif most frequently encountered.See I.

Social Sanction and PersecutionThe most severe public reaction to the witch was to put her on tri-al for heresy and other violations of the law. In some instances thisled to the witch's execution by burning at the stake. Nevertheless,relatively few individuals were ever burned in Scandinavia, in con-trast to continental Europe where hundreds of thousands were ex-ecuted. On the basis of the available legal documents, Bente G. Alverhas determined that some 750 individuals, one-sixth of them men,were put on trial in Norway, and about one-fourth of this numberwere actually burned."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Witchcraft 191But short of legal persecution people tended to respond to thewitch and her activities with a mixture of fear and loathing. She tend-ed to become isolated and cut off from the community.

Then the latter answered and con-fessed that on the eighth day before All Saints Day, during the saidyear, the aforesaid Niels came to him in Rognsund and asked that hemake sailing wind for him to get to Kassevog, saying that he wouldpay him when he came back.He answered, yes, took off his right shoe, and washed his bare footin the sea •while the water was quiet and said:\"Wind to land! Wind to land!\"And then they got favorable sailing wind. And he asked them notto set too much sail before they passed Klubbenes; after that theycould set as much sail as the boat would tolerate.Soon thereafter, the Saturday before All Saints Day, Trine, the wifeof Oluf 0rensen, came to him and asked him to make sailing wind sothat her husband, who was with Niels Jonsen, could come homesoon. And she promised to give him a jug of beer for his trouble.He answered, yes, took a young pig, threw it into the sea, andsaid:\"Wind to sea! Wind to sea!\"But the pig squirmed too much in the sun, and the wind becametoo strong. Then he said to Trine:\"God have mercy on them! I am afraid that they have taken off tooearly and that the wind is too strong. If they took off at the begin-ning of the storm, may God have mercy, or they will not return.\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"192 WitchcraftThe aforementioned Niels Jonsen, Oluf 0rensen, and three of Jen-sen's hired hands from Kasvog remained in that storm.Then the bailiff asked if he had made sailing wind other times. Heanswered:\"Yes, I have often made wind for people, and a quarter of a yearago I made wind for a Hiemland ship lying before Kareken becausethey requested that I make wind for them. So I washed my foot, as Isaid before, and got a gentle southern wind.\"Furthermore the bailiff asked whether he knew how to do sorcery.He answered that he had never taken anything for his runic spells.The bailiff asked him what the rune spells were.\"When one wants to cast rune spells, one takes a rune drum; it ismade of pine root and covered with ox skin or buckskin. Then oneuses a piece of wood as a handle under the drum, and hooves fromevery kind of animal in this country are hung around the drum. Andnine lines are painted on the drum with alder bark, which is used topaint the seats of benches. The first line represents their god, the sec-ond the sun, and the third the moon, and then they mark all kinds ofanimals that can bring them luck or inflict harm on their enemies.And when two magicians want to test whose art is the strongest,they paint two ox reindeer on the drum, which butt each other withtheir horns. Whichever one turns out to be the strongest, his master isstrongest and his art is best.And when they want to ask their apostle something, they takesome small pieces of copper and hang them on the wings of a copperbird, which they place on the drum. Then they beat it with a hornhammer lined with beaver skin. The bird hops around on the drumand finally stops on one of the lines. Then his master knows immedi-ately what the answer is. And to protect the master or whoever elsemay be in the hut from accident, they beat the drum with the ham-mer. He whose bird falls from the drum will not live long.Then he was asked how long ago he learned these things. He an-swered that when he was first introduced to such things he was onlya little boy.He was also asked how often he had been involved in beating sucha drum. He answered that once many magicians came together tobeat the drum to see whose art was strongest.And he was also asked who taught him to make wind. He said:\"A Finn, now dead, by the name of Laurits Qoern, before the timeof the war.\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Witchcraft 193At the following court session he was condemned to death by fireand stake.The Lapp Quive Baardsen was clearly a specialist in making sail-ing wind by magic. His services were sought by the community.Prom the trial transcript, it appears that when his practice result-ed in the death of some of his clients, however, he was legallyheld responsible.Quive Baardsen describes how the Lapps used their runedrums to put themselves into trances in which to communicatewith the spirit world. In the eyes of the court, these practicesmust have seemed heretical; they were reason enough to condemnthe accused to death.See Bente G.

It simply deflected to each side anddid not come near her.The judges did not know what to do.

Later I dug through the trial transcripts from thatperiod and found out the whole story.The trial took place at Tennfjord in Vatne in 1667. Among themembers of the jury were the following men from Vigra: KnutRolnes, Oluf Rolnes, Jon R0rvik, Anders R0rvik, Eirik Synes, andOluf R0rvik.The accused was Hilde Olufs Daughter Blindheim who had beenreported by her neighbor Tore Olufs Son Blindheim, for witchcraft.*The accusation consisted of the following:1) Hilde had \"bewitched\" Tore's fishing gear so that he did notcatch any fish.2) She had conjured one of Tore's cows away from the herd so thatthe animal fell into a hole in a bog and drowned.3) She had used witchcraft to heal a cow that had been near deathon R0rvik.Many witnesses were called. All of them were quite sure that Hildeserved the Evil One and that Old Nick was helping her.The only one who had some doubts was the judge. During the in-vestigation it came out that the trouble started at a Christmas party.Both Hilde and Tore were there. They came to a heated exchange ofwords. Finally Hilde said that if she had her way, Tore would havelittle luck fishing the next spring. And it happened as Hilde hadwished: Tore caught very few fish that season. The following spring,Tore lost a cow. The folks combed the area but could not find thecow. So they asked Hilde.\"Have you looked at Kolva?\" she asked.Kolva is a large bog on the other side of the mountain, nearR0rvik. No, they had not done that.\"I wonder if the cow isn't there,\" she said."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"196 WitchcraftThey took off to look. Sure enough, there lay the cow in a hole inthe bog.The next year, during Lent, a man from R0rvik asked Hilde to takea look at a cow that recently had calved and now seemed critically ill.It was his best cow, too. Well, Hilde went with him. But when shegot to R0rvik, there was a crowd of people gaping at the animal.\"She was lying there with outstretched neck and legs,\" said one ofthe witnesses.\"Yes, and her eyes were almost like those of a dead animal,\" saidanother.Hilde chased the whole bunch out of the cow shed. She took thecow out of the yoke and moved her out onto the floor, which she co-vered with straw. Then she began to stretch and massage the udderand hind quarter of the cow, and she gave her something warm todrink. The cow responded immediately, and after a while, she got upand was led back into her stall.One boy had the courage to climb up on the wall of the cow shedand peek in through a hole to see what Hilde was doing. He saw ablack cat sitting on her shoulder while she was working with the ani-mal. The cat was spitting now and then, and fire came from hermouth, said the boy.This final testimony was the most serious for Hilde. Nevertheless,the judge —in \"great doubt\" — decided that she should be acquitted.But most of the people then, and for a long time afterward, stead-fastly believed that Hilde really was a witch.*People living on the same farm usually had the same surname.There is no indication that Tore Olufs Son Blindheim was thebrother of the accused.The text is not a legend but Martin Bj0rndal's account of thetrial of Hilde Olufs Daughter Blindheim. The case provides anexample of a person being subjected to persecution precisely be-cause she is above average in intelligence and initiative.Printed in Martin Bj0rndal, Segn og tru.

But most of the villagers thought of them as nasty witches.They attended church regularly, but when they got too old to walk,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Witchcraft 197the farmers had to take turns driving them. Most of the time, theywere transported in a wheelbarrow or handcart, and some folks foundthem to be as light as feathers, while others found them to be asheavy as lead. People noticed that it was always their friends whothought of the two women as light. And, of course, that reinforcedtheir belief that the women must be witches. But it was hard to findproof.Finally they were brought to Junget Manor to be interrogated. Butthat did not lead to anything because the women denied that theyknew the least bit about witchcraft. They were retained at the manorunder strict supervision. A tutor came every day to read to them andinstruct them in the true faith.It happened that one day he got into an argument with one ofthem, and he kicked her in the face with his boot until the bloodflowed. But the other woman said that he had better leave, or else itwould go hard with him. This threat frightened the tutor and he ranup to his room, which was right above theirs. He had drilled a holein the floor of his room so he could keep an eye on them without be-ing noticed. He lay down there and looked.After a while he saw a tiny gray man come in and busy himselfwith the women. The tutor knew right away that it was the devilhimself, and now he no longer doubted that they were witches.During the time the women sat captive at the manor, the ownerbecame seriously ill several times. He sent a messenger for the minis-ter, but by the time he reached the manor, the man was always wellagain. Then one day the nobleman became deathly ill. A wagon wassent for the minister, but that time too the sickness passed before theminister got to the manor. So they sent another messenger on horse-back to tell him that he did not need to come because the man hadgotten well again. When the minister got the message, he becamerather impatient and exclaimed:\"To hell with it.\"He turned around and drove home. But the nobleman died shortlythereafter, because when the minister had said those words, thewitches had gained power over him and had used the opportunity tokill him.Now the case against the witches -was taken up in earnest, andeven though the women refused to confess, they were sentenced toburn for their witchcraft. A stake was erected on Raven's Hill onN0rgard Field, and many people came to watch. The man who toldme about it was ten or twelve at the time. He was there too."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"198 WitchcraftThey used good dry peat and firewood to make the pyre. But theycould not get it to burn. So they sent for the minister, who told themthat a little gray man sat between the two witches on the pyre. Thatwas the reason why it would not burn, but he did not know how tochase him away. They were forced to take the witches down fromthe stake once more, and they brought them to a nearby farm for thenight. But it did not go any better the next day. None of theministers whom they asked for help could chase the little man away.Finally, on the third or fourth day, they got a minister who was soexperienced in the black arts that he could drive the little man out.He was one of the few who had passed the entire course at the BlackSchool. He had barely finished exorcising the little man when thepyre exploded into fire and the two witches were burned.They were the last ones to be burned in that area. But still therewere many around there who were reputed to be able to do witch-craft, and people were afraid of making them angry.The narrator of this story seems to sympathize with the twowomen. He suggests indirectly that the evidence against them isfar from conclusive. Perhaps the story reflects the community'swish to be rid of two individuals who have become a burden.The reason that the tutor kicks one of the women in the faceand draws blood may be related to the belief that making a witchbleed breaks her power.

But when the minister got near herwith the chalice, he pushed her away, saying that she had no businessbeing there.Bernt Spillebrokk was deacon at the church.

He answered thatwhen he came to the woman with the chalice, the wine rotated coun-terclockwise.Witches profaned the holy bread and wine and were therefore ex-cluded from taking communion. The communal bread and winewere generally believed to possess magical power that could beused for various purposes, not only by witches. But the churchconsidered any such use of the sacred elements to be a grave sin.See Oskar Riihle, \"Abendmahl,\" Handworterbuch des deutschenAberglaubens 1 (1927), columns 42-55.Collected by Peter Lunde in Vest-Agder (Norway).

But he built the smithy anyway.Shortly thereafter, he became seriously ill. He believed that Mette hadcaused this by casting a spell on him. He consulted a wise man whorid him of the sickness. But he gave Hans the advice that wheneverhe met the witch, he should greet her first. One morning they raninto each other, but she shouted from a long way off:\"Good morning, Hans.\"Right away he got sick once more, and he neither got well norever worked in the smithy again.One day a man walked down by Louse Hill and saw an egg roll-ing along the path.

And yet, they loved each other, got alongwell, and produced a lot of children.One day Our Lord told Eve that He wanted to see her children.Eve thought it out of place to show all her children to Our Lord; shewas ashamed that they had quite so many. So she hid half of them.The rest she showed to Our Lord when He arrived.He looked at the children and praised them because they werebeautiful, and He said as much to Eve.\"But tell me,\" He said, \"are these all your children?\"\"Yes, they are,\" said Eve.\"You don't have any others?\"\"No, you see here all the children Adam and I have,\" she said.She thought there were quite enough of them, she said.\"Well, yes,\" said Our Lord. \"Let those who are hidden becomehuldre.\"205"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"206 The Invisible FolkThis legend explaining the origin of the huldre and similar beingsis widespread in Europe. Another explanation found occasionallyis that the huldre are descended from Adam's first wife, Lillith.Because this narrative contains biblical motifs, it is at timesclassified as a religious folktale (AT 758) rather than as a legend.See Katherine Briggs, The Vanishing People (1978), 30-31;Gunnar Granberg, Skogsrdet (1935), 163-67.Collected by Torkell Mauland from O.

Some fell on theroof tops and became nisse; some fell in the water and became watersprites; some fell on the hills and became the hill folk; and some fellinto the moors and became elves.The belief that the various invisible folk are descendants of thefallen angels can be found not only in folk tradition but also inmedieval theology. By finding a place for them within the frame-work of church-approved dogma, pre-Christian belief was as-similated into the biblical worldview.See K. Beth, \"Engel,\" Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens2 (1929-30), columns 826-36; Alfus Rosenberg, Engel und Ddmo-nen.

Many people have seen and heard the mound folk there.Once, a long, long time ago, a man from Kasa went to the moun-tains to look for his horses. He searched for a long time. Finally hecame to a large rock. While he stood there, looking around for theanimals, he clearly heard someone singing and praying inside therock.Now this man from Kasa was anything but godly. When he hadbeen standing there listening for a while, he got mad and shouted:"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Invisible Folk 207\"You're not going to find salvation no matter how much you singand pray!\"With that he ran away from the church of the mound folk — that iswhat it was. But since that day, the man from Kasa got more troublethan he bargained for. Wherever he went, he thought that someonewas following him, whimpering. He never had any peace.One day the man went back to Jonsk0r to the same rock in whichhe had heard the praying and singing. Now he shouted at the rock:\"Yes, you'll find salvation if you sing and pray!\"After that day the man from Kasa was left in peace.The legend expresses the folk's widespread ambivalence concern-ing the huldre's chances to find salvation. People were simply notsure whether the invisible folk were included in the divine planfor salvation. The usual pattern in this legend type is that the per-son first denies the possibility of the huldre's salvation, but thenfeels sorry for them, is admonished by a minister, or witnesses amiracle which changes his or her mind.See R.

Encoun-tering them could be quite dangerous. If a child was retarded or sick-ly, for example, it was believed that the invisible folk had exchangedthe healthy and normal human child for one of their own. Belief inthe changeling is worldwide, and in Scandinavia it can be traced backto pre-Christian times.It was also dangerous for adults to cross paths with the invisiblefolk. A person who disappeared or suddenly suffered from somemental disorder was often believed to have been \"taken into themountain\" by a preternatural being.On the changeling, see Svale Solheim, \"Byting,\" KLMN 2 (1957),columns 452-56; J.

Everybody fell asleep im-mediately because they had been awake for a long time. But themother, who probably was not sleeping as soundly as the rest ofthem, woke up feeling something move. To her horror she discov-ered that the child was gone. Looking around, she saw an elf womansitting on the threshold, holding the child. She was trying to throwher leg over the threshold. You see, the elf woman was so short thatthis was the only way for her to get over it.But the mother let out a loud scream and shouted:\"May Jesus forbid you!\"Then the elf woman let go of the child and disappeared. The moth-er jumped out of bed to retrieve her child, but the midwife and theother women got so scared they did not know what to do. The fatherdid not hesitate for a moment.

There are various explanations forwhy they wanted human children, for example, they wanted\"fresh blood\" or they considered human children more beautifulthan their own. Placing steel, silver, or a hymnbook in the cradlewould protect the child. It was believed that someone should al-ways hold watch over the child, while burning a candle.See J. S.

But then thewoman said:\"If she's your mother, you're going to burn!\"They fired up the oven and picked up the changeling, pretending,they were going to throw it into the fire. Immediately its real motherappeared with the child she had stolen. Turning to the woman, shesaid:\"I have never treated your baby the way you treat mine!\"Then she took her own child and disappeared.If a child did not learn to talk, people concluded that it was achangeling refusing to speak because it did not want to be dis-covered.

The older villagers had heard from the old folks beforethem that nobody had ever seen him anywhere but in his armchair bythe fire, nodding his head. They did not care much for the fellow,which was understandable because he was always cross and sulky,and it was not possible to get a proper answer from him. There hadto be something strange about that old fellow because he never died.So they went to see a wise man and asked for advice on how theymight help this poor old body leave the world. The answer theyreceived was that they should make him tell how old he was. Thenhe would die. Oh, yes, they tried. They asked the fellow in everypossible way about his age. But he never gave them a straight an-swer, only whimpered and talked incoherently.So they went back to the wise man and asked how they might geta real answer out of him. He said they had to try another tack. Theyshould pretend that they were getting ready to brew. First they wereto take a chicken egg and cut it in half. One half of the shell was tobe used as a brewing vat, the other as a tub for the mash. Once theyhad done this, they were to wait and see what happened.Well, they started their preparations as if they were getting readyfor a great feast. They cut the eggshell to use the two halves for thebrewing. Suddenly the old fellow by the fireplace woke up and burstinto laughter:\"Now I've been around long enough to see Seven Miles Forestburn down and grow up again seven times, but never before have Iseen beer brewed in an eggshell!\"Then a voice shouted through the wall:\"Are you through?\"\"Yes,\" answered the old fellow.And when they looked for him, he was gone. All that was left ofhim were some decayed bones lying in something like ashes in hischair.An idea often found in legends about the changeling is that theyare very old. One could get rid of them only by revealing theirage, usually by tricking them into responding by confrontingthem with some unexpected situation. The motif of brewing inan eggshell is a favorite one in this connection.See Ilmar Arens and Bengt af Klintberg, \"Bortbytingssagner ien gotlandsk dombok fran 1690,\" Rig (1979), 93-95; Gisela Pi-aschewski, Der Wechselbalg (1935), 93; Robert Wildhaber, \"DieEierschalen in europaischem Glauben und Brauch,\" Acta Eth-nographica Academiae Sdentiamm Hungaricae 19 (1970), 435-57."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The Invisible Folk 211Legend type: ML 5085.Collected by Sigurd Nergaard in 0sterdalen, Hedmark (Nor-way).

It was customary to place steel inthe cradle of the newborn child, but this time they forgot.Well, the mother was alone in her bed and the child in its cradle.All the others were gone. A beautiful woman appeared, and she tookthe child and put another in its place. It was a boy, big and coarse.They said it was a changeling because it never learned to talk.A wise man advised them to take the changeling to the church andhave the minister baptize it. On their way to the church, they crossedover Klippkron, which is a nearby hill. Then they heard someoneshouting from Kummel-Hill, a little ways off:\"Where are you going, Killkrack?\"\"I'm going to church to become a better person,\" answered thechangeling, who had never talked before.Then they turned around, and they never did bring it to thechurch.A Finn woman told them to put the changeling on the floor andsweep three Thursday nights in a row. The third Thursday they wereto take the changeling and the sweepings and place them out on thegarbage heap. They did this, and after a short while, the beautifulwoman reappeared, holding their child. She put it in the cradle andtook her own back.\"Here is your baby,\" she said, \"I never treated it as badly as you'vetreated mine.\"This legend is found mostly in southern Sweden and Denmark.But it seems to have originated in Germany. The name Killkrackderives from the German word \"Kielkropf,\" meaning cretin ordeformed child.According to legendary tradition, baptizing the changeling orgiving it holy communion would make it disappear.

He never became any taller than a small boy.The invisible folk most frequently referred to in Danish traditionare the elves.

The earliest known descrip-tion of the elves dancing is found in Olaus Magnus's History of theNordic People (1555).

He was a little retarded. They thought that he must have gonehome already, but when they did not find him there, they returned tothe moor and looked and called for him. They heard a fine voice call-ing, now here, now there:\"Niels! Niels!\"And Niels, answering:\"Here I am!\"They followed the voice, but they could not find Niels. The samevoice could be heard coming from different directions, so they nearlygot lost themselves. At last they saw Niels running full-speedthrough the grass. He ran right past them without looking at them,and when they finally caught up with him, he was quite besidehimself.\"Don't you hear how she's calling for me?\" he shouted, trying totear himself away.He told them how a woman had called him from the moor, andhow she had always run ahead of him while calling, enticing himdeeper and deeper into the moor. People thought that she must havebeen an elf.From that day on the boy seemed even crazier than before.The retarded boy insists that he has heard voices calling him. Inthe context of the narrative, it is important to note that the adultsshare his experience but without being enticed into the world ofthe elves, as the boy obviously is.See Bengt Holbek and I0rn Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967),111-20.Collected by E.

The Fairy LoverCharcoal burners, lumberjacks, and half-grown boys and girlstending the cattle on the outlying summer farms often experiencedthe preternatural beings as erotically seductive. Legends reveal thatpeople were simultaneously attracted and afraid of these beings. Ayoung man might throw steel over the forest woman to bind her tohimself, or he might use some protective magic to be rid of her. Themarriage ceremony between a girl and a fairy lover might be inter-rupted at the last moment. There might be an actual liaison between ahuman and one of the invisible folk, resulting in the birth of a child,the disappearance of the person, or, inversely, the absorption of thesupranormal being into human society. Sometimes, refusal of theerotic attentions of the fairy lover caused sickness, madness, evendeath. One of the important functions of legends about fairy loverswas to enforce certain rules of behavior on the men and womenworking in isolated areas.See Bengt Holbek and I0rn Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967),111-20, 127-34; Svale Solheim, Norsk seetertradisjon (1952),340-505; Gunnar Granberg, Skogsrdet (1935).46.1 The Hill ManIngebj0rg Hovrudhaugen was often alone at the summer farm.

She was easygoing and nice. He thoughtthat she could stay with him and help him with the kilns. So shestayed with him for three years, and they had three children.

He should knock threetimes.One day, however, he forgot. When he got to the kilns, he sawher the way she really was. She stood there stoking the kiln with hernose and claws and damping the fire with her tail, which she dippedin a bucket of water.He got very frightened because he now understood that he wasliving with a wood sprite. He did not say anything to her but turnedaround and went to an old Finn and asked him for advice. The Finnsaid:"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"222 The Invisible Folk\"Take her and the children with you on a sleigh out on Lake Ras-valn. You must sit on the horse yourself, but put the harness pins inloosely so that you can kick them out with your heel. Don't tie anytight knots in the harness, everything must be loose. When you cometo the middle of the lake, ride away from them and don't turn arounduntil you get to the goldsmith's hut.\"Now the charcoal burner went back and knocked on the tree as heusually did, and she was a handsome woman once more. He hadbrought the horse and sleigh. He said that they were going for adrive. He put her and the children in the sleigh, and he mounted thehorse. When they got to the middle of the lake, seven white wolvesappeared on the ice. When she saw them, and it dawned on her whathe was going to do, she begged for mercy for herself and thechildren:\"If you don't have pity on me and the older two, at least have pityon little Snorvipa. If you are going to do what you are thinking of, Iam going to call my brother in Hartzberg, my sister in Ringkalla, andmy cousin in Stripa!\"But he rode away.Then she called for help, and shots rained down from all threemountains and thundered like cannonballs, hitting the ice behind him.It was blue ice. But he rode away unscathed because he had tied allthe knots loosely. The woman and her children, however, weredevoured by the wolves.This legend is a folk tradition connected with the life of charcoalburners in Sweden. More generally it reflects the fear of involve-ment with preternatural beings.

One autumn OldTore and Marte, who lived on Austaana in Kvitseid, had much trou-ble getting help to bring in the harvest. Their big, beautiful field wasso ripe that the grain was dropping to the ground, and there was nota single person they could hire to do the mowing. They thought theymight have to ask their neighbors for help, as they often did in thosedays whenever they were in a hurry with a job.So Tore and Marte brewed and baked, as if they were preparingfor a great feast. They brewed in the workhouse, and the evening be-fore the neighbors were expected to come and help, the beer stoodready in a vat. But during the night, they heard the sound of cuttingand tying in the field, and the sound of many feet shuffling and walk-ing in the workhouse. And they heard voices mumbling and talking:Everybody can mow,but nobody can tie the cross.We tie it straight,and soon we can quit.The next morning the folk on Austaana got a big surprise — thewhole big field had been cut. But the sheaves had been tied in a waythat no one in the village had seen before. Ever since that time, it hasbeen called a \"straight tie.\" The usual tie was in the shape of a cross,but the tusse could not tie that way.When Tore and Marte went into the workhouse to fetch the beer,they found it was all gone except for a little bit of the dregs. The tussehad drunk the beer in payment for their labor. But when Marteflushed the dregs from the vat, she found three or four silver spoons"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"224 The Invisible Folkon the bottom, which the tusse had left there.

As a re-ward she receives an item of value, usually made of silver.The woman in this legend acts from general neighborliness.Alternative reasons often found in this legend cycle are that thewoman jokingly had promised her help to a toad or that themother-to-be was her own daughter who had been \"taken intothe mountain.\"See H.

The woman did, andwhen it was all over, the man in the mound said:\"Open your apron!\"He filled her apron with wood shavings, but she threw them awayoutside. The next morning one of the shavings was stuck to herapron, and it had turned to pure gold. Then she ran outside to lookfor the rest of the shavings, but they were gone.Often the midwife discards the gift she receives, believing it tohave no value, only to discover too late that it was gold or silver.This is related to the belief that the world of preternatural beingsis not what it appears.Legend type: ML 5070.Collected by E.

The maidcame upon her so suddenly that she did not quite finish. The moundwoman rushed out as soon as the girl came in, leaving a swaddlingcloth behind.The girl was smart enough not to touch the cloth. Instead she tooka stick to move it aside, so it would not be in her way as she worked.After a while the girl had to go outside for a moment. When shecame back, there was a silver spoon on the floor. It occurred to thegirl that the spoon was for her because she had saved the swaddlingcloth for the hulder. But she was not sure.So she talked to Mother Holla about it. Mother Holla, however,said that the spoon was her own and took it away from the girl.

But after that day, Mother Holla's fingers began to wither.According to folk tradition, if the girl had touched the cloth thatwas left behind, the hulder would not have been able to take itback.The description of the greedy mistress of the house and herpunishment can be interpreted as a form of social comment.Legend type: ML 6020.Collected by Edvard Langset in 1919 from Frits Smith inKristiansund, Nordmere (Norway).

Once she hadbeen back home and was on her way up the mountain, when some-thing strange happened to her. While she was walking along andknitting, someone shouted to her:\"Tell them at the mountain farm that Rynjus is dead!\"When she got to the farm, she said to the empty air:\"I don't know whether to keep quiet or to speak, but someoneshouted to me in Dale: tell them on the mountain farm that Rynjus isdead!\"As soon as she had said this, a woman appeared and said:\"Oh, no, is Rynjus dead?!\"\"Yes, that's what they told me,\" answered the dairymaid.\"You wouldn't be so kind as to take care of things for me while Igo to the funeral? My cattle are grazing among yours and my bucketsstand among yours.\"Then the mound woman —for that is what she was —was gone.In the evening the cattle of the invisible came together with thedairymaid's cows, and she milked them and took care of them alongwith her own. After a few days, the mound woman returned, and hercattle disappeared. So she had taken over her own chores again. Butthe next evening a fine white goat wandered onto the farm. Thedairymaid could not get rid of it.

The story goes that the first time itwas plowed, the farmhand and the servant boy found a fire rake anda shovel, both of which were broken. They repaired them, and whenthey came back the next day to finish the plowing, there were twocakes lying on the ground.The servant boy immediately ate one of them, but the farmhandwas afraid of the hill folk's cakes and would not touch them. The boywas not harmed at all. On the contrary, he became so strong thatthere was no one stronger for several miles around.The folk looked upon food and drink offered by preternatural be-ings with a certain ambivalence. They were afraid of being \"takeninto the mountain\" (cf. nos. 45.6-45.8), but they were also hesi-tant about refusing a gift. In this instance, the boy benefits fromaccepting the food.See Svale Solheim, Norsk satertradisjon (1952), 477; Bengt Hol-bek and tern Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967), 121-24; Inger M.Boberg, Bjaergfolkenes bagning (1938).Collected by E.

But no matter how securely they tied up the cows in the newshed, two or three of them always tore themselves loose by the nextmorning. This went on the whole winter until spring came. Some-time before they were going to put the cows out to summer pasture,the farmer was standing outside one day, cutting wood, when astranger came up to him.\"We are next-door neighbors, so to speak. Won't you come homewith me and have a drink?\"Yes, the farmer went along with him. He understood full wellwhat kind of man he was, but it did not look as if he intended anyharm. Near the new cow shed, the stranger knocked on a steel panthe Sylhus man had never seen there before. Right away an openingin the ground appeared. They climbed down and emerged in a fineroom. He was invited to the table, and it looked to him as if the tablewas made of silver. All kinds of food and drink were served. But justwhen they sat down, some dirty water ran down onto the table, andthe man in the hill looked fiercely at the Sylhus farmer.\"Dear me, what's that?\" the farmer asked.\"Oh, that's not difficult to understand. Your cow shed is rightabove us, you know.\""},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"232 The Invisible Folk\"All right, I guess I put it in the wrong place; I understand thatnow,\" said the man from Sylhus. \"I'll move it as soon as I put thecows out to summer pasture.\"Well, they came to an understanding. In the summer the farmergot the cows out of the shed and went to work. And since then therewere never any more problems with the cows.To ensure success in animal husbandry, it was considered neces-sary to be on good terms with the invisible folk. If a farmerabandoned a new cow shed or some other building, he was likelyto explain that this was done out of consideration for his invisibleneighbors.See Svale Solheim, Norsk scetertradisjon (1952), 366-69; EllaOhlson, \"Naturvasen i angermanlandsk folktro.

Awoman came along, followed by a great number of fat cows.\"Get those iron hooks out of my way!\" she said.The woman meant that they should move their scythes out of theway. But one of the farmhands threw his scythe over one of thecows. He got to keep the cow because the woman was one of themound folk.Now the way it is with the cattle of the invisible, no matter howbig a pail you have, you always milk it full. But you must neverempty it and start milking again. These folks here remembered that,and all went well to begin with. But there came a time when theybroke the rule, and the cow milked nothing but blood. They nevergot any more use out of her.Accounts of people seeing the cattle of the mound folk are com-monplace.

Then there appeared a little girl no-body knew, and she played with them. When the mother gave herchildren some bread to eat in the afternoon, she also gave a little pieceto the stranger. The little girl came every day, played with the chil-dren, and got a little something to eat.But once the mother brought a big slice of bread and said:\"If you will tell me where you are from, I'll give you this piece ofbread.\"Suddenly a strange woman appeared, who angrily said to thehousewife:\"If you want to give, then give, but don't ask questions of an inno-cent child.\"Then she took the child by her arm and disappeared, and theynever saw the child or her mother again.But one day when the children were playing in the hills with chil-dren from the town, they heard a voice coming from a mound:Pibel, put the pot on,get the little chickies,on the mound they run!Then the children ran home and reported what had happened. Andafter that they never played near that mound again.The two encounters between the children, one within the limitsof the village, the other out in nature, express the underlying am-bivalence in the relations between humans and the invisible folk.The hill woman reacts against the conventional response of themother, which emphasizes social rather than personal identity.Collected by E.

But thedraug chased him until they came to the river Greina. Then he threwthe drinking horn after Gunnar so that it hit the back of his horse.

But he didget it and, as far as I know, the great horn can be found in Gjaernesto this very day.This legend is well known in Scandinavia, as well as in Germanyand the British Isles. The earliest known variant was writtendown during the twelfth century by William of Newbury.

The hill got its name be-cause people put braces under the cliffs to keep them from topplingon people passing below. Once someone saw a long train of trollsmarching out of the hill. When people were mowing the fields, thetrolls showed up on the hill and did the same.In earlier days the farms at Lycke lay nearer the trolls' abode, andthe trolls came to Lycke more often to borrow one thing or another.But they always returned everything in good order. Christmas Evethe trolls would go to a farm and drive out the people sitting downfor their meal. They would set the table with their own food andfeast far into the night.One Christmas Eve a man leading a show bear arrived. He askedfor lodging. The folks answered that they did not get any rest onChristmas Eve themselves, and they told him the whole story. Butthe stranger said that he was not afraid of any trolls, and because heasked so intently, they let both him and his bear stay.Everybody ate early that Christmas Eve and went to bed.

She hid the butter at the bottomof the bowl of porridge to be set out in the barn, knowing very wellthe nisse was greedy for the butter and would make a long face if hecould not find it.But when the nisse saw that there was no butter on the Christmasporridge, he became madder than the girl had imagined —he wentstraight to the cow shed and killed the best cow. That would showthem how much he appreciated their begrudging him even a little bitof butter!Then he went into the barn and ate the porridge anyway.

He had been away, and itwas already quite late in the day.When he entered the stable, he petted the horse and saw that it didnot have any hay. So he went up to the loft, but as he bent over thehay, someone grabbed him by the arms and carried him down thestairs so that his feet did not even touch the ground. He was setdown in the middle of the stable floor. Now the horse was eating,even though he had not given it anything.Every morning when they came into the stable, the horse was al-ready cleaned and groomed, and they never needed to take care of it.This memorat exemplifies the tradition of the tomte, who not onlytakes care of the farm animals, especially the horses, but will nottolerate anyone else interfering with his work.See Henning Frederik Feilberg, Nissens historic (1919), 45-46.Collected in Korsholm, Osterbotten (Finland).

The farmer did not have to do anything butload the wagon and hitch up the horses. The nisse drove to the milland did the grinding himself.When this had been going on for about a year, and they were get-ting another load ready for him, they decided to give the nisse some-thing as a reward for being so helpful. So they sewed some newhomespun clothes for him and put them on top of the load. When thenisse arrived to drive the wagon, he found the clothes. He was happyand put them on right away.But seeing how fine he had become, he jumped down from thewagon and said:\"Now I am too elegant to do the grinding.\"And since then the nisse did not grind the grain on Vaker anymore.This legend has been collected throughout western Europe. Thebackground to the nisse's decision to quit working may perhapsbe found in folk traditions of paying off one's help at the end of agiven period, usually at the end of the year. Often the paymentwas a new suit or a pair of shoes.Lutz Rohrich points out that in German folk tradition, a dis-tinction is to be made between the domestic spirits, who defendtheir place in the household at all costs, and the dwarfs, who con-sider themselves laid off (ausgelohnf) when rewarded.See R6hrich, Sage (1966), 20-21.Legend type: ML 7015.Collected by Moltke Moe in Ringerike, Buskerud (Norway).Ms. in NFS Moltke Moe 20, 1."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"246 The Invisible Folk48.11 The Troublesome HaugboAt a certain farm, the haugbo was impossible to live with.

When the mangot on the road with it, he discovered the tub was rather heavy. Sohe lifted up the lid to look inside. There sat the haugbo on hishaunches.\"We're moving today, old man!\" he chuckled.The term haugbo literally means \"mound dweller.\" As the term isused here, it does not imply that the farm spirit lives subterrane-ously but that he is usually not visible.In legendary tradition it was considered impossible to forcefarm sprites to leave against their will. Klintberg argues that thisnotion derives from the ancient idea that humans cannot escape illfate. In the expanded versions of the legend, however, the storyends differently: the farmer recognizes the domestic spirit as abringer of luck and learns to live with him in harmony.See Henning Frederik Feilberg, Nissens historic (1919), 82-86;Bengt af Klintberg, Svenska folks'dgner (1972), 304; Archer Taylor,\"The Pertinacious Cobold,\" Journal of English and Germanic Philolo-gy 31 (1932), 1-9.Legend type: ML 7020.Collected by Moltke Moe from Liv Bratterud in B0herad, Tel-emark (Norway).

He was an unusuallystrong fellow who wanted to be master in his own house. Once hedecided to sleep in the bunkhouse himself. As soon as he lay down,the tunkall grabbed hold of him, trying to throw him out of bed. ButNjaedl put up a fight. He took his knife and cut and slashed and torein all directions, hitting the walls and resisting with all his might.Then the tunkall got scared.

The folks on the farm could hear him sobbing.Svale Solheim has documented this legend in western Norway,and Inger Boberg has pointed to parallels in Denmark. Solheiminterprets the Norwegian materials as the remains of an ancientancestral cult. According to Solheim, the tunkall represents theoriginal owner of the farm and, thus, the sum of good luck andprosperity associated with the farm.Contrary to the foregoing legend, here the farmer actuallydrives the domestic spirit from the place. Solheim suggests thatthis results from a folk belief tradition dying out owing tochanges in agricultural methods and house construction. Whenthe outbuildings used as bunkhouses and for food storage disap-peared from the typical farm, the tunkall, believed to have his bedthere, was forced to leave, too.See Solheim, \"Gardvoren og senga hans,\" Maal og minne (1951),143-58.

The Spirit of the MillIn Norway, and in Sweden mostly along the Norwegian border,folk traditions exist about kvernknunen (literally, \"mill snarl,\" Swedish,kvarngubben, \"old man of the mill\"). This preternatural being is knownto stop the mill if it is run at night or on a holy day. The impliedsanction against such inappropriate use of the mill is not unequivocal,however, because the mill sprite is invariably pacified or driven away.49.1 The Mill TrollOne winter night a farmer was grinding at the mill at Ner-Duasen.They used to have fire pits in the mills in the old days, where theyboiled pitch while watching the mill.

It seemed that he had learned to play all at once;his fingers were more pliant and lighter, and the bow was dancingover the strings almost by itself.When he had been sitting and playing for a while, a little old manappeared to him and said:\"If you will promise me one thing, Paul, I'll teach you to play sowell that you will be the best fiddler in the whole village.\"Paul asked him what that might be.\"Oh, nothing more,\" said the grim — for that is what he was — \"thanthat you stop shouting and carrying on so in the meadows at night.\"Well, Paul promised, and then he really learned to play.See Tobias Norlind, Studier i svensk folklore (1911), 123-26; BengtHolbek and torn Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967), 203; ArneBj0rndal and Brynjulf Alver, -ogfela ho let.

But they stopped him, saying that he mustnot cross the river; if he did, he would drown.\"Give me some water to drink, then,\" he said. \"I'm so thirsty!\"They fetched some water for him, but as soon as he drank it, hecollapsed and died.This legend combines two motifs, namely, that preternatural be-ings associated with the river demand sacrifice and that humanscannot escape their fate.

She hadbeen walking for a long time and was exhausted. Then she caughtsight of a gray horse, and, overjoyed, she fastened her garter onto itfor reins, threw her apron over its back, and led it to a mound toclimb on its back. But just as she mounted it, she said:\"I don't think I need to ride, after all.\"Then the horse gave a start, jumped into a nearby lake, and disap-peared. The girl now knew what kind of horse it had been —an0kk—because n0kks can't stand to hear their own names and theywill jump back into the lake if they do. You see, another name forthe n0kk is \"need,\" and the horse took off when the girl said \"need.\"In legends throughout Scandinavia, the n0kk is described as tak-ing the shape of a horse to lure people, especially children, intothe water.

He thought that she had been beached by the low tide.She had scraped the area around herself free of seaweed and kelp,and had wrapped some seaweed around herself so that it looked like abelt.The man stared at her for a long time. She smiled at him. Never inhis life had he seen a woman with such beautiful eyes. She had longgolden hair that reached down to her waist. He came closer. He wasjust about to place her on his lap, when he saw her fish tail. Belowher waist she looked almost like a porpoise.Eventually she rolled down to the edge of the water. Then shelaughed aloud and disappeared into the waves.As in the case of an encounter between a man and a hulder, theresponse is ambivalent, blending erotic fascination with repulsionand fear of the mermaid's animal nature.

Then he should go with her and gethis payment.\"Take my hand and jump,\" said the woman, and instantly theywere in a big hall beneath the sea. There sat a blind old man.\"I smell the blood of a Christian,\" the old fellow said. \"Come overhere and let me finger wrestle with you.\"The mermaid told the skipper that he should hand an anchor hookto the old fellow. This he did.\"Not bad, not bad at all,\" said the old man.Then the skipper received a handkerchief in which three knots hadbeen tied.\"When you get into a lull, you can open one knot. And if youwant to go really fast, untie two knots, but never untie the third.\"Once when the skipper had been to the city, he wanted to sailhome, but the wind was still, the sails were slack, and his sloop washeavily laden. Rask was not quite sober. He untied the first knot andwas determined to sail anyway. The sail filled with wind and every-body watched in amazement. Then Rask wanted to sail even faster,and he untied the second knot. The sloop went so fast, it made thewater hiss. But he must have untied the third knot, too, because no-body ever saw him again.Many legends describe how humans supply grain or other goodsto the hidden folk of the sea. Payment might take the form ofsome special power, the use of which, however, carried certainrisks. The motif of the \"wind knots\" is best known from folk tra-ditions about witches and other specialists in making sailingwind.

And when the weddingtook place, there was a big commotion and uproar at the farm, andthen the bridegroom got sick and strange and never got well again.The legend ascribes demonic qualities to the mermaid.

Once each year, on TwelfthNight, they get a chance to take off their sealskins, and then theylook just like everyone else. They dance and play on the flat rocks bythe shore and in the breeding caves near the beach, and they have afine time. A legend tells how a boy from the southmost farm in Mik-ladalur heard people say that the seals got together on Twelfth Nightin a cave on the breeding grounds not far from the village. So, in theevening, he went there to see if this was true. He hid behind a rockin front of the cave. After the sun went down, he saw seals swim-ming from all directions toward the spot where he was crouching.They took off their skins and put them on a flat rock on the beach.They did look just like ordinary people!

The boy crept over andtook it and returned to his hiding place. The seal folk danced all nightlong, but when it started to grow light, they returned to their skins.The beautiful seal woman could not find hers and wrung her handsand wailed because the sun was about to come up. But just before itdid, she caught its scent near the hiding place of the boy from Mik-ladalur and pleaded with him to give it back to her.

But he always had to becareful not to let her get to her sealskin. He kept it in a locked chestand carried the key with him. One day he went fishing, and while hewas sitting out at sea, pulling in fish, his hand happened to brush hisbelt where the key usually hung. He was dumbfounded when he real-ized that he must have forgotten the key at home. He cried out in hisgrief:\"This evening I'll be without a wife!\"The other fishermen pulled in their lines and rowed home as fast asthey could. When the man from Mikladalur got to his house, his wifewas gone. Only the children were there, sitting quietly. So that theywould not hurt themselves while they were alone in the house, hiswife had put out the fire and locked up all the knives and sharp ob-jects. After that, she had run down to the beach, pulled on her seal-skin, and plunged into the sea. She had indeed found the key andopened the chest, and when she saw the sealskin, she could not con-trol herself and had to put it on. This is where the old saying comesfrom:\"He couldn't control himself any more than a seal that finds itsskin.\"When she leaped into the sea, her seal mate found her, and theyswam away together. All these years he had been waiting for her tocome back to him. When the children she had with the man fromMikladalur went down to the beach, a seal could be seen just off theshore watching them, and everyone thought that it was their mother.Many years went by, and there is nothing to tell of the man on thefarm and the children he and the seal woman had together. Then oneday the villagers from Mikladalur went hunting for baby seals downin the breeding caves. The night before, the seal woman appeared tothe farmer in a dream and said that if he went with the other villagersto hunt baby seals, he must make sure that they did not kill the maleseal in front of the cave or the two seal pups that were lying at thevery back of the cave. The male seal was her mate and the pups theirsons, she said, and she told him how they were marked. But thefarmer paid no heed to this dream. He went with the villagers to thecave, and they killed all the pups. As his share of the catch, thefarmer got the entire male seal and the flippers of the pups, and fordinner they had boiled seal's head and flippers.

Avenged it is and avenged it will be on the menof Mikladalur! Some will be lost at sea, and some will fall frommountain cliffs and ledges! And this will go on until so many havedied that they can hold hands and reach all the way around Kalsoy!\"Then she disappeared with a great crashing sound and was neverseen again. All too often men from Mikladalur perish at sea or fallfrom mountain cliffs, but it is said that there is still a foolish farmeron the southmost farm, and so it seems that the number of men thathave perished is not yet enough to reach around the island.This legend has relatively limited distribution in Denmark, north-ern Norway, the Faeroe Islands, and Iceland.

They sailed into a stormand were forced to land on a small island, where they stayed forseveral days. They beached their boat in the usual way, but the oarswere not left undisturbed. They were in order that night, but by thenext morning, they had been moved. The leader of the crew hid him-self to find out who might be messing with their boat. When it got tobe night, a draug appeared, climbed into the boat, and started to pokearound.

But to his horror, the rock wasalive, and it jumped into the sea, spraying water behind it. The boyran up to the shack and told them what had happened. Everybodyrealized that the boy had come across a draug and that the draug wouldbe back to take revenge for the thrashing it had received. They agreedthat right after supper they would all lie down with their feet towardthe door and put the kitchen boy in between them.At midnight the door flew open and a long arm with a hookreached in and took hold of the boy. But his comrades held on tohim, and the draug let go. They never saw it again.The crew of fisherman described here are staying at one of theshacks set up for this purpose near the fishing grounds.

Then they did not knowwhat to do except hold a prayer meeting at church. From all the pul-pits, prayers were said to free the town from this calamity.Then a sea horse emerged from the ocean, and there was a fight tothe death with the sea serpent. In the end the serpent let out a terriblehowl and disappeared in the sea. The sea horse followed it, and sincethen, no one has seen either one of them.The belief in various kinds, of huge sea monsters is documented inlegendary tradition, myth, and literature around the world.

It carried goods for the towns up north.Time passed and it was already fall when the sloop entered thewaters off Trondheim. It became critical then to make good use ofthe wind and to make the journey as short as possible. The skippersuggested they sail across the open sea from the Fro Islands to Lofot-en. The others agreed and they steered the sloop out to sea.On their way a terrible storm broke. They sailed and sailed and didnot know where they •were. They saw neither land nor shippinglanes, and everybody was sure they were going to shipwreck. All of asudden, they saw land far ahead. They sailed closer but nobodyrecognized the land. It was low in contour and beautiful, and therewere green meadows. They steered even closer and turned into a bay.It was still there, and the wind blew seaward. They stayed in the bayuntil the storm abated."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The Invisible Folk 271When they had raised anchor, the land disappeared. They were outon the lonely sea once more. So they sailed again for many days.Then they struck land at Lofoten Spit.When the sloop returned, people talked much about that land. No-body knew just where the sloop had been, but many surmised thatthey had sailed to Utr0st. Later the sloop was put up. Then it provedthat people had been right. They found ears of barley around thesteering lock. They had sailed over the grain fields on Utr0st.All over the world, folk traditions exist about hidden islands ofbliss.

It came from thenorth but was rarely seen because it brought foggy weather with itand was covered by mist. Now you shall hear how it happened thatSvinoy came to lie still.In the village of VioareiSi on Vi5oy, the villagers had a sow butno boar, yet the sow had piglets every year. Everyone wonderedabout this and could not understand how it happened. People did saythat she was not in the village sometimes, but she always came rightback. One day she trotted off eastward through the village and overtoward Ei&isvik. A woman managed to tie a bunch of keys to hertail. The sow jumped into the sea and swam away from shore. A littlewhile after this, people on Vi&arei&i could see an island nearing themfrom south of the point. As quickly as they could, they manned a"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"272 The Invisible Folkboat and rowed out to the island, and now they could see it andland on it. When the sow had carried iron onto that island, it hadbeen fixed, and the fog had evaporated. And it has lain there eversince. People called it Svinoy because it was full of swine when theyfirst went out to it and because a swine had fastened it to the oceanfloor, so that it was not a floating island anymore. And it was outthere that the sow from ViSareiSi had found a mate.Both in Norway and on the Faeroe Islands, folk traditions existabout an invisible, floating island, which is found by an animal,usually a pig, carrying a metal object on its body. The metal dis-enchants the island.See Bengt Holbek and tern Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967),246; Dag Stromback, \"Att helga land,\" Festskrift tilldgnad AxelHdgerstrom (1928), 198-220.

The Wild HuntIn Scandinavian folk tradition, there are two chief types of nightriders: the hunter and his dogs pursuing a woman, and the host flyingthrough the air —especially at Christmastime. In Norway this host isusually called oskorei or jolareidi (Christmas riders).See Hilding Celander, \"Oskoreien och beslaktade fbrestallningar ialdre och nyare nordisk tradition,\" Saga och sed (1943), 71-175;Bengt Holbek and I0rn Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk (1967), 99-106;L.

Nottov Haugann saw the light streaking acrossGrennes Hill. He counted thirty horses. At Lake H0vring the waterwas open. The horses went in up to their fetlocks.

Then the man on Brenna saw that Gyro had a tail.\"Pull in your tail, Gyro!\" he shouted.The host scattered and rode home. Taddak ran right into the cor-ner of the storehouse so that the whole building was askew, and heknocked himself out. Suddenly he was in his bed once more, drippingwith sweat. At the same moment, the host reached Mount Tveite.People heard it rattle when the oskorei rode into the mountain.This narrative is quite common. At times the host is led byOthin, the devil, or some other demonic being.

Two men strapped themselves together witha belt and fought with knives. One of the men was stabbed and laydead on the floor. Then the oskorei came riding in through the door,took the dead man with them, and threw a firebrand on the floor.They left some reins behind on the attic floor. The reins have beenkept at Aase ever since.In some areas of southern and western Norway, the oskorei areconsidered the host of the dead. They appear where a murder hasbeen committed and take the dead body; sometimes they take thekiller with them as well.See Hilding Celander, \"Oskoreien och beslaktade forestallnin-gar,\" Saga och sed (1943), 78-81.Collected by Kjetil A.

When he was on his way home, he heard a terrifying roar inthe air. It came closer and closer, and suddenly a man on horsebackwas standing before him. He shouted:\"Hold my dogs!\"The man obeyed. The hunter had three huge dogs tied with a silk-en thread. The farmer was looking at the thread when the hunterreturned after a few moments. Over the back of his horse, he hadslung two elf women who were tied together by their hair.\"Hand over my dogs and reach out your hand, and I'll give you atip.\"The farmer did, but the hunter thrust three fingertips into his hand,leaving three burn marks. Then he rode off with a roar, while the elfwomen howled and the dogs barked.In a number of variants, a man is richly rewarded for helping thehunter.

During the sixteenth and seven-teenth centuries the persecution of witches, whose powers presuma-bly derived from Satan, further stimulated popular beliefs and tradi-tions about the Devil. To some degree the role of the Devil becameassimilated with that of preternatural beings, such as the troll, thenokk, and the leader of the oskorei.The legends express not only fear of the Devil but also a persistentfascination with the possibility of utilizing his power. A contract withthe Evil One would bring material advantage in this life, but it wouldentail giving up one's soul and body in the next. A minister, by con-trast, could make use of Satan's power with impunity. At the BlackSchool at Wittenberg he acquired knowledge of the Black Book. Inmany jocular legends, the Devil appears as the fool duped by theminister. But there are also numerous legends about people other thanthe minister outwitting the Devil. A large cycle of legends is con-cerned with enforcing social sanctions, for instance, against fiddleplaying, dancing, drinking, and card playing.

He took his time looking forsuitable lumber; he was not in any hurry, and besides, it was beautifulin the woods.But by the time he was done, dusk had already fallen, and when hegot on the ice with the lumber on his back, he got a little too close toopen water. Before Per knew it, he fell in, cursing and hollering,while his lumber danced over the ice. No matter how much he strug-gled, Per could not get out because every time he tried taking hold ofthe edge of the ice, it broke. There were no people around, so therewas little use in shouting for help. Finally Per thought he had bettercall Our Lord, although he doubted that that would be of any use ei-ther, considering the nature of his errand. And whether it was on ac-count of the lumber or something else Per had done, Our Lord didnot come, and Per remained there, flailing and struggling as before.Then Per did not know what else to do but call on the Devil, andto be on the safe side, he promised him his soul right away.

The woman thought this wasa fine bargain; she had nothing of value under her apron, and it didnot occur to her that she might be pregnant.But when the winter was nearly over, she realized her plight. Shegrew quiet and withdrawn, and Saemundur asked her about the rea-son for her moodiness. In the beginning, she did not want to sayanything, but finally she told him all about the bargain she had madewith the stranger. Saemundur let her know that her condition hadbeen no secret to him, but he had done nothing about it before.\"Don't worry,\" said Saemundur. \"I'll show you how to break yourbargain with the Devil. Tomorrow ask him to fetch water in the bas-ket and walk past the gate to the cemetery, otherwise the bargain isoff.\"The woman did everything just as Saemundur instructed her. TheDevil took his basket and trudged off after water, but when he cameto the churchyard, Saemundur rang the bell, and all the water ran out.The Devil tried three times, but the same thing happened each time.Then he threw the basket away in a fit of rage and disappeared.Later the woman gave birth to her child, and the Devil neverbothered it.

The Evil One appeared and asked the boywhat he was supposed to do.The miller heard the commotion the Devil was making at the milland came running. He got there just in the nick of time; things wouldhave gone awry for the boy. The miller asked the Devil to turn thewaterfall around and make it flow upstream.

There people learned witchcraft and various kindsof magic. The school had been set up in a building made of earth andstone. There were no windows, and it was always pitch black inside.There were no teachers, either, and the students learned from bookswritten with fiery red letters that could be read in the dark. The stu-dents were not allowed to go outside or see daylight as long as theywere there, and they had to stay from three to seven years to finishtheir studies. Each day a fur-covered gray hand reached through thewall and gave them their food. It was agreed that each year he whoran the school would receive the last graduate to leave the building.And because the students knew it was the Devil who ran the school,they all wanted to avoid being the last one to leave.Once there were three Icelanders at the Black School, Saemundurthe Learned, Kalfur Arnason, and Halfdan Eldjarnsson, who later be-came a minister in Fell in the district of SlettuhliS.

So the king wrote a letter to Petter Dass,asking him to preach in the church at Copenhagen on ChristmasDay. But he handed the letter to the bailiff with instructions to give itto the minister on Christmas Eve. He must not read it before then.Then he would see whether Petter Dass really knew more than otherministers.So, early on Christmas morning, Petter Dass said to his wife:\"Today I'm going to preach for the king in Copenhagen.\"\"Why, sure,\" she said, \"me too!\"She thought he was joking.

It happens that the Evil Oneshows up when it gets out of hand.There was a girl by the name of Helge. She could never get her fillof dancing. No matter how far away the dances were, she ran to ev-ery one she heard about. But on one occasion a stranger asked her todance. And then she got the dance of her life! He turned her so fast,they spun like a whirlwind, and she begged to be allowed to catchher breath. But he screamed so that it echoed in the house:Hei, Helge, ho!I shall turn you so!You'll get your fill of dancing, ho!And he danced more arid more wildly. The fiddler got frightenedand put down his instrument. But the fiddle played on by itself! Theother dancers stood as if spellbound along the wall. The stranger con-tinued until the girl hung limply in his arms, like a rag. They put thefiddle back on the wall, but it played on. The fiddler locked it in acabinet, but the fiddle continued playing until the man stopped danc-ing and let go of the girl. But by that time, she was dead, and whenthey looked for the man, he was gone.This is obviously a didactic legend warning against excessivedancing. It shows Satan's punitive aspect. The compulsion todance has also been associated with the water sprite and mayhave a historical background in a dance epidemic sweeping Eu-rope in the early Middle Ages.

The troll wanted to tear down the church, of course, but hedid not manage to do that.In Scandinavia the legend about the troll who built the churchfirst developed during the Middle Ages. In Trondheim (Norway)the troll is hired by Saint Olav, in Lund (Sweden) by SaintLaurentius. In German folk tradition, it is usually the devil ratherthan a troll who functions as the master builder. It has been sug-gested that the legend has its background in the Eddie mythabout the building of the wall around the gods' abode (Asgarth).Other possible sources are certain Irish folktales, as well as theEuropean cycle of tales about Titteliture, Tom-Tit-Tot, or Rum-pelstiltskin.

On Twelfth Night each year, so many trolls swarmedfrom every direction that the villagers fled their homes and stayed inMikladalur as long as the trolls carried on. This is how the villagecame to be called Tr011anes.Once it happened that a very old woman was not able to flee withthe other villagers. She hid under a table in the kitchen, hoping thetrolls would not see her. Later in the evening, she saw trolls flockingthrough the doors like sheep into a fold, so many of them that shecould not count them all. They began to kick up their heels. But justwhen the party was at its peak, the old woman cried out from underthe table:\"Jesus have mercy on me!\"When the trolls heard the hated name, they howled:\"Gy&ja broke up the dance!\"With that they left the house and have not disturbed the villagesince.

He threw a rock at it but did not hit his target. Then hemoved out to an island. When a sailor arrived on the island, the trollgave him a necklace for a girl in Skrea, a box to be placed on the al-tar in the church, and a chest with seed he wanted them to sow.When the sailor got home, they tied the necklace around an oaktree, and it flew up into the air and disappeared. Then they thoughtsomething might be wrong with the box, too. They put it on top ofa hill and it burst into flames. But they did sow the seed, and from itgrew a whole lot of troll heads. So they commandeered all the peoplein the village, and they grabbed their scythes and cut them off.Throughout Scandinavia legends depict the trolls' resistance to thebuilding of churches. The explanation given most often is that thetrolls hate the sound of the bells. The church and its bell is oftenreferred to as \"bell cow.\"The revengeful gift sent by the troll is frequently tied not onlyto his anger toward the church but also to an unsuccessful court-ship.

In a cave in one of the clefts, there lived anogress who every Christmas carried off the best man in Laugardalur.The people of Laugardalur talked to the Bishop at Skalholt, whocounseled them to move their church as close to the canyon as pos-sible and to ring the church bells every Christmas. This was done andthe ogress fled the canyon.Some people say that the ogress moved north to a place calledKlukkuskar&. Bells were brought into the ravine, and the ogress wasalso driven from there by the ringing. That is how the ravine got itsname.

Prior to Christianization, hoards ofgold, silver, coins and other valuables were buried in graves for useby the dead in the afterlife, and both then and much later, people hidmoney underground for safekeeping. Legends frequently describeabortive attempts to find the hidden wealth protected by preternaturalbeings, believed to be the ghost of the original owner or perhaps therevenant of an animal sacrificed at the time of burial. Often the treas-ure was bound by various spells. It could be raised only at propitioustimes and if stringent conditions were met. The treasure hunter mustbe properly prepared —for instance, by fasting—and he must observethe taboo against talking or laughing. Sometimes strange apparitionslure the treasure hunter into breaking the taboo. At other times,someone burying the treasure is observed by a concealed witness whothen retrieves the hoard.See Hirschberg, \"Schatz,\" Handwb'rterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens7 (1935-36), columns 1002-15; Leander Petzoldt, Deutsche Volks-sagen (1970), 466; Bengt Holbek and I0rn Pi0, Fabeldyr og sagnfolk(1967), 359-411; Bengt af Klintberg, Svenska folksagner (1972),44-45; Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, Sigurds strid med Favne (1918),17-19; Tobias Norlind, Skatts'dgner (1918); Waldemar Liungman,Sveriges sagner i ord och bild 5 (1961), 299-363; John Lindow,\"Swedish Legends of Buried Treasure,\" Journal of American Folklore95 (1982), 257-79.317"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"56.1 A Spell for Binding TreasureIn the name of Jesus!

Later, there was another attempt to excavate the knoll, but thistime the diggers saw an armed host arise from the ground and threat-en them with death if they did not stop digging. After that no Ice-lander would excavate the knoll, so the diggers had to come fromDenmark. The Danes' attempt was also a failure.Helgafell Monastery was sacked in the 1540s, when the Reforma-tion was imposed on Iceland by the Danish king. In Icelandiclegends, as in the saga, buried treasure is often guarded by thedead. In the saga, the treasure is usually raised by the hero, but inthe Icelandic legends, it tends to elude the treasure seeker. Fagri-holl and the surrounding land was owned by a man named EgillSveinbjarnason Egilsson, who related the above story to KonradMaurer in 1858.

Often these pioneers areremembered as chieftains or kings, and the farm is named after them.More developed narratives deal with border conflicts and changesin ownership of landholdings.Joran Sahlgren, \"Ortsnamnssagner,\" Saga och sed (1945), 8-16.57.1 Holger the DaneJust south of Hjarne's Mound, in the parish of Tornby, there lies ahuge flat rock in the middle of the field.Once the owner of the field wanted to get rid of that rock becauseit was in his way. He sent four strong men armed with steel bars tomove it. They finally managed to lift up one corner, when to theirhorror, they saw that it rested on four corner stones and covered aroom made of stone. In it an old man with a white beard sat by a ta-ble. He had a big sword, and his beard reached all the way down tothe table. He looked up and said:\"Is it time now? Give me your hand, my fellow countryman, so Ican feel how strong you are.\"One of the men handed him his steel bar, which the old mansqueezed until it was flat.

The rock lies there undisturbedto this very day.The folk tradition of the ancient king living in an underground ormountain abode is known in a number of European countries. InGermany, for instance, the reference is to Charlemagne, FrederikBarbarossa, and others, in England to King Arthur.See Donald Ward, \"Berg,\" Enzyklopadie des Marchens 2 (1979),columns 138-46.Collected by E.

But when the daughter of a crofter heard aboutthis, she laughed at the king. He sent for her, commanding her tocome neither during the waxing nor the waning moon, neitherclothed nor unclothed, neither driving nor walking. So she dressed ina ragged fishnet and came during the moon's turning, with one footon the back of a billy goat, the other on the ground.The king asked her how she dared laugh at his command.\"His majesty has not given life and does not have the right to takelife,\" she answered."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"History as Seen from the Village 333\"What are we going to do with all the people, then?\" asked theking.\"Give them a shovel and a bucket full of seed, and let them go tothe place where there are no people,\" answered the girl.The land where there were no people was Finland. This piece ofadvice pleased the king so much that he married the girl.Klintberg has suggested that this legend may have entered popu-lar folk tradition through a school drama entitled Disa, written byJohannes Messenius, which was first performed in 1611. Parallelsto the motif of solving overpopulation by mass killing date backto the Saga of Olaf Tryggvasson. The motif of the impossibletask is more typically found in folktales (AT 875), but an earlyexample exists in the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok.See Bengt af Klintberg, Svenska folksagner (1972), 346-47; L.Bygden, \"Nagra studier rorande Disasagan,\" Samlaren (1896),21-74.Collected by J.

A farmer at Valstad insisted that their parish ex-tended all the way to Korsli. He was willing to take an oath at theplace where he said the boundary was. He got some soil from thegraveyard at Valstad and put it in his shoes. Then he swore that hewas standing on the soil of his own parish. But when he swore, hesank into the ground. In the 1860s there was supposed to have been astone marking the place where it happened.In other variants of this widespread legend, the punishment is notthat the man sinks into the ground but that he must walk againafter death.

Since then it has remained in his family's pos-session.But the man who was to have Klagstorp was greedy. He wantedto have as much land as possible and ran around a huge piece ofground.

To end the conflict once and for all, theyagreed that a man was to ride out from each village at dawn. Theboundaries would be placed wherever the men met. So, off rode aman from Snarum, one from Kr0dsherad, and one from Sigdal. Butthe latter two took off too early, which is why the border came to beso far north and so close to Kr0dsherad.

Each of them was to start from the landmarkand ride around the island, the Holar bishop to the north and theSkalholt bishop to the south. The second marker was to be placedwherever they met. The bishop from Skalholt rode day and night asfast as his horses would go and arrived dead-tired at the place wherethe marker was eventually established. But the bishop from Holarrode slowly and leisurely through the countryside and did not exerthimself. He was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed when he met his col-league at the south end of HrutafjoSur. Ever since then the boundarybetween the two bishoprics has run through the middle of that fjord.Iceland was divided into two bishoprics in 1106 A.D.

The most importantand numerically speaking greatest subgroup concerns itself with the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"336 History as Seen from the Villagechoice of building sites. The conflict between the church andsupranormal beings is an important motif in this context. Otherlegends tell about the identification of the bells with a particularchurch. A further group describes the miraculous powers of holy im-ages and how they came into the possession of a given parish.See Gunnar Smedberg, \"Kyrksagnerna fran Jamtland och Har-jedalen,\" Forum Theologicum 17 (1960), 87-116.58.1 Finding a Building Site for the New ChurchWhen they were going to build the church in Vallerstad, they firstintended to put it up on Lund's Hill. But that proved to be impossi-ble. Whatever was erected during the day, was torn down again dur-ing the night by the troll. Finally the builders had to give up.Because they did not want to pick another unsuitable building site,the folks in the parish agreed to leave it to Providence. They didwhat other people had tried before them: they loaded the foundationstone on a sled, harnessed a pair of wild oxen to it, and let them gowherever they wanted. The church was built where the oxen stopped.This legend is enormously popular throughout Scandinavia.Stromback has distinguished three subtypes, namely, that thechurch was built where floating timbers drifted ashore, where un-tamed oxen pulled the building materials, or where the invisiblefolk moved them at night. Parallels to this legend can also befound in early Scandinavian literature, for example, in the Icelan-dic Book of Settlements (twelfth century). A similar account in theOld Testament describes how the holy ark was returned to theIsraelites (I. Samuel, chaps. 5-6).See Dag Stromback, \"Den forsta kyrkplatsen i sagen och folk-lig tro,\" Religion och bibel 17 (1958), 3-13. Reprinted in Strom-back, Folklore ochfilologi (1970), 123-34.

For-giveness of sins was granted to anyone who carried the larger stonesto the wall.The dogma of indulgences was an important issue during theReformation, which came to Scandinavia during the 1530s. Itdemonstrates the tenacity of folk tradition that a story based onthat dogma survived for centuries after the practice of indul-gences had been eliminated from the religious life of the popu-lation.See A.

He crawled forwardwith the boat, feeling the water with his hand, and touched some-thing that felt like a child's face. He tried to pull it into the boat butcould not. He struggled until he was bathed in sweat. But he touchedhis face with the same hand that had touched the image, and suddenlyhe was able to see. He became so happy, he just had to get that imageinto the boat. He made a vow to give it to a certain church in Ber-gen, if he could only get it into the boat. That did not help either. Henamed all the churches he knew. But nothing helped until he namedthe church at R01dal. Then it almost seemed as if the image got intothe boat by itself.Belief in the healing power of holy images was accepted dogmain Catholic belief. The migratory legend of the blind fishermanfinding a crucifix floating in the sea is here adapted to explainhow a particular image was brought to R01dal. The R01dal cru-cifix was famous throughout Norway. According to tradition,every Midsummer Night sweat dripped from the figure and wasused to heal all kinds of ailments, including lameness and blind-ness. The last, unofficial Midsummer Night's mass was held atR01dal church during the nineteenth century."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"338 History as Seen from the VillageSee Kjell Bondevik, \"Valfarting og lovnader,\" Museet i Hauge-sund (1925-35), 65-77.Collected by Torkell Mauland from Hans and Inger 0verlandin Suldal, Rogaland (Norway).

It was probably during the time theking owned the church. They pulled the bells down from the towerand loaded them on a sled, and a horse pulled them until they got tothe road by the churchyard. But then the sled stood still and wouldnot be moved at all. They harnessed two, then three, four, and final-ly, twelve horses in front of the sled. But it did not do any good. Thesled remained immobilized. So they turned it around, and one horseeasily pulled the bells back to the church.Attempts to move a bell that belonged to a given church usuallyproved futile.

The masterhad to take a trip to Alingsas, and so the journeyman finished castingthe bell on his own. Afterward he struck the bell to test its sound. Hesaw three drops of blood appear on the bell. The sound of the bellwas so powerful that the master heard it on his way back home, andhe was still somewhere between Ingered and Tollered. When he gothome, the journeyman said:\"This bell will take three lives: mine and yours, and I don't knowwhose will be the third.\"But it was clear to the master that the journeyman had become aneven better craftsman than himself, and he said:\"You have taken my bread from me, I will take your life fromyou.\"And then he killed the journeyman. He was executed for what hehad done.But sometime later the bell fell down and killed a man.This migratory legend is widespread in Europe.

A val-ley runs from north to south through the parish. Today the valleybottom lies a few meters above sea level, but in the old days, the seareached all the way in, so there was a sound separating eastern andwestern Torvastad.Once Saint Olav sailed into the sound. When he had gotten abouthalfway in, he was told there was no water on board. Wearing hisiron gloves, the king went ashore and thrust his hand right into theface of a rock. Immediately, clear, fresh water welled up and pouredfrom the rock, and they all got to drink.You can see the spring even today. It is called Olav's Spring, and itnever runs dry. If you are sick, the water will heal you. And if youhave warts, you need only go to Olav's Spring and dip your handsinto the water a couple of times, and you will be rid of them.

It is called Gyvrodalen (Troll Hag Dale). There is acleft in that valley, and on one side of its stands a huge rock thatlooks like a woman spinning on a wheel. People call the rock Gyvro(Troll Hag).The legend tells that Saint Olav sailed right through the valley oneday. The troll hag was sitting there spinning. She got angry at Olavand said:\"Why do you sail here and do me harm?\"To which Olav answered:\"Stay right there and turn to stone!\" ,And that is what happened. You can still see the troll sitting thereto this very day.The ongoing confrontation with primordial trolls is a majortheme in the legends about Saint Olav. Olav changes the ogressinto a stone with the magic power of his word.The same story is also related in a folk ballad which, however,has been collected only in Denmark and Sweden (DgF 2, no. 50).B0 has suggested that the ballad is derived from an earlier variantof this legend.See Olav B0, Heilag-Olav i norsk folketradisjon (1955), 50-59,64-74.Collected by Aamund Salveson in Rogaland (Norway).

This was a real troll mountain because thenotorious Reins troll lived there. He was so ill natured that he wouldsuck up the southwesterly winds blowing north to Altensfjord andspit them out again, creating the storms that raged offshore at Rana-fjord. It was tough for seagoing folk to sail their heavy square riggerspast that troll. Many times they would see the draug grinning at them,leeward in his half-boat, and they would know what was in store forthem.But one evening near Midsummer's Night, Saint Olav landed hisship at Angersnes. One of his warriors went ashore and tied the ship'srope around a big rock on the beach; it was the same rock on whichpeople made sacrifices to appease the Reins troll. Then the king wenton land with his following, and there has never been a more beautifulsight. The village folk paid homage to the king, and he talked kindlyto them. But when he heard about the evil troll, he gathered his menand led them off to the mountain. When they had gotten about half-way up, the king placed a silver arrow on his bow and shot into themountain. At that very moment a huge rock slide fell with a greatroar, and after the dust had settled, they saw an enormous black holein the rock face. Everybody -was sure the troll had met his death.The great hole in the mountain is called Saint Olav's Shot to thisvery day, and you can still see the markings left by the ship's ropearound the sacrificial rock.

Before he left the island, he wantedto build a church at a place called Haldnes. It was to be a stone churchwith a tower. But the construction did not move as fast as the kinghad hoped.

He could not get the sun and the moon, and hesurely did not want to sell himself to a troll. Olav did know that if hecould find out the troll's name, he would be saved; if a troll hears itsname from the lips of a Christian man, it bursts. But how could hefind out the troll's name? He was in greater trouble than he had everbeen before.On Friday evening Saint Olav was walking along, brooding aboutthis. He got to the hill by Blood Field. Tired and heavy of heart, hesat down on one of the mounds there. Then he heard something likea song. It was a troll woman rocking her child to sleep inside themound.

The Black DeathBlack Death is the name the folk gave to the bubonic pestilencethat ravaged Asia and Europe during the fourteenth century. The epi-demic killed about one-third of the population in Sweden, two-thirdsin Norway. Throughout the centuries other large-scale epidemics inScandinavia have for the most part been assimilated into folk tradi-tions about the Black Death.The motifs most frequently found in legends about the pest are:omens; the spread of the disease through the arrival of a ship orthrough a personification of the plague in the shape of a woman, twochildren, or an animal; descriptions of the symptoms of the diseaseand of futile attempts to stop it; and folk traditions about survivorsand the gradual repopulation of deserted areas.See Carl-Herman Tillhagen, \"Sagner och folktro kring pesten,\"Fataburen (1967), 215-30; Lauri Honko, Krankheitsprojektile (1959);I.

We were terribly afraid of him, but hedid not leave the cholera with us because we had given him lodging.He was in the service of the Crown.This chronicate is an example of more recent folk traditions aboutepidemics. (Cf. no 57.3, which exemplifies the notion that theking decreed death as a solution to overpopulation and poverty.)The motif that bearers of disease spare those who give themlodging is also prevalent in legends about the Black Death.Collected by V.

In the parish of Nyed there was a minister named Torellius.People said that he had dealings with the devil.One day Torellius walked over Brattfors Moor, which lies be-tween the parishes of Nyed and Brattfors. First he met a boy carryinga rake on his shoulder.\"Where are you going?\" the minister asked.\"I'm on my way to Nyed to rake,\" the boy answered.Then he met a girl carrying a broom.\"Where are you going?\" the minister asked.\"To Nyed to sweep,\" she answered.You see, it was the pest; it had been to Brattfors, and all the peoplethere had died.\"You are going to stay right here on the moor and rake and sweepall you want,\" said Torrelius, and he tied them both to a juniperbush. After that there was no more pest in the country.Now I have seen a dry juniper bush out on the moor, but I did notthink there was anything out of the ordinary about it. The old folks,however, believed that the pest was bound by that bush, and theysaid that no heather would grow near it. Yet it seemed to me that itgrew about as well there as it did anyplace.It was believed that the pest could be bound by magic. The dia-logue between the minister and the pest personified by the boyand the girl is patterned after formulas commonly used in healing.(Cf. no. 28.12; nos. 54.10, 54.12, and 54.14-54.15 further exem-plify the magic skills often ascribed to ministers.)See John Lindow, \"Personification and Narrative Structure inScandinavian Plague Legends,\" Arv 29-30 (1973-74), 83-92.Legend type: ML 7080.Collected by Levi Johansson in 1908 from Johan Otterstromin Borgsjo parish, Medelpad (Sweden).

But that is probably not true. Surely the epidemic raged thereas much as it did in other places in Hallingdal.When the terrible disease was laying the valley waste, the folksfrom Alsgjeld got together, killed a blameless young man, and placedhis body across the road by the boundary between Gol and Al. Theybelieved the pest could not cross over the dead body of this guiltlessyoung man.But his innocent blood was revenged. As a punishment, there havebeen many knifings and murders in Alsgjeld every since.Yes, that is how the legend goes further up in the valley.This legend is quite rare in Norway but widespread in southernSweden and Denmark.Scholars have maintained that in extreme cases, individualswere actually buried alive to stop the plague. It appears that inearlier folk tradition, people believed the victim carried the pestdemon in his body. Live burial, then, confined the pest in thegrave. In the surviving variants of the legend, however, none ofwhich are more than a century old, the victim is killed as a formof sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"348 History as Seen from the VillageSee Hans-Egil Hauge, Levande begravd eller brand i nordiskfolkemedisin (1965), 223-25; Carl-Herman Tillhagen, \"Sagner ochfolktro kring pesten,\" Fataburen (1967).Collected in Hallingdal (Norway).

But it did not reach Vefsn. This is why:When the Vefsn was sailing home from Bergen, probably in 1618,people heard strange noises on board. They thought it came from thecargo hold.One of the crew, a Finn, thought it might have something to dowith the hemp they were carrying. He said he would take a look, butnothing -was done until they sailed into outer Vefsn in South Fjord.Then such a racket came from the hold that everyone was terrified.They decided to bring the hemp up on deck. The Finn pointed to abundle and said that is where the evil sat. He said they should set fireto it and throw it into the sea. And that is what they did.This happened just outside Korsnes. When the hemp caught onfire, the crew saw something that looked like two little boys jumpingand kicking in the fire. They were screaming and making terriblenoises.It was the pest, which had taken human shape, but now it was be-ing destroyed. That is why the pest did not get to Vefsn.The epidemic referred to here is said to have occurred some 300years after the Black Death, but the description is the same. Thelegend combines the motifs of the pest arriving by ship and beingpersonified by two children with the notion that it could bestopped by fire.

War TimesThe wars that have had the greatest impact on legend tradition inScandinavia are the Seven Years' War (1563-70) and the Great NordicWar (1700-1721), both involving Denmark-Norway, and Sweden,the Napoleonic Wars (1807-14), and Finland's war with Russia(1808-9). Especially in the older folk tradition, the different wars tendto blend into one another. The legends are rarely concerned with thepolitical implications of the various conflicts. Rather they focus on theimpact of the war experience on individuals —both the soldiers andthe civilian population. The story is almost always told from the per-spective of one person and his or her local community. At the sametime, many of the motifs found in these legends are actuallymigratory.See Olav B0, \"Tradisjon om ufredstider,\" Norveg 5 (1955),197-212.61.1 The CometThere's a kind of star called a shooting star.

The outcome was that, since they had come such a long wayand gone through so much trouble, they were allowed to return toLj0rdal with as much as they could carry. Then each woman hoistedher husband onto her back and headed home.This migratory legend, also known as \"The Women at Weins-berg,\" allegedly originated from the siege of a castle in Swabia,Germany, in 1140. In the most widespread version, the womennegotiated the surrender of the castle on the condition that theywere permitted to leave with their dearest possessions. To thesurprise of the conquerors, they took their husbands, carryingthem on their backs.The farms at Lj0rdal were plundered by the Swedes during theso-called Gyldenl0ve Wars (1675-79) between Denmark-Norwayand Sweden, and the Lj0rdal farmers were brought to Sweden.See Leander Petzoldt, Historische Sagen 2 (1977), 323-24.Collected by Sigurd Nergaard.

One day a Swedish corporal saidto him:\"Where did you hide your money?\"They had already ransacked the house and come up empty.\"Out with it, or it will cost you your life!\"\"All right,\" said the man, \"I will tell you. I have a sheep cote downin the southern pasture. That's where I have buried my money andmy silver too.\"\"Well, let's go out there.\"There was a big plot of moorland south of the farm. That is wherethey went. When they got to the sheep cote, the door was low andsmall, and the Swede ordered the man to enter. But the man said:\"No, it's customary that the stranger enters first.\"When the Swede bent down to go in, the man pulled out a bigcudgel and hit him across the back of his neck so that he collapsed,and then the man finished him off and buried him right there. But theSwedes missed their countryman, of course, and one day a troop ofsoldiers came to the farm, took the man prisoner, and demanded toknow what he had done with the corporal.

Shehad plenty of gold and silver in her house and was proud and haugh-ty. Once she took a ring off her finger and threw it into the sea.\"It is just as impossible that I will ever find that ring again as it isthat I will ever be poor,\" she said.Shortly after that a fisherman came and sold the lady some fish forher dinner.

Suddenly she heard him calling:\"Mama, the banana bit me!\"\"Yes, sure,\" said the mother. She thought he was making it up. Butwhen she went back into the room, the boy was lying there, dead.He had been bitten by a snake about 4 to 5 centimeters long —aminiature cobra.Now I always check before I eat a banana to make sure there is nota snake in it.Rumors of bananas being infested with snakes caused the sale ofthe fruit to drop appreciably in both Sweden and Finland duringthe early 1970s.See Bengt af Klintberg, \"Folksagner i dag,\" Fataburen (1976),276-77.Collected by af Klintberg from a 16-year-old girl in Boras(Sweden).

Of course she wasterrified, but she pushed the gas pedal to the floor and drove awayfrom the motorcyclists. To her surprise they did not follow her. Shedrove to the nearest police station to report what had happened.There she realized that the chain was tangled in the windshield, andtwo of the motorcyclist's fingers were stuck to one end of it.Versions of this story have been documented in North Americaand Europe.

The SupernaturalDespite the fact that people today attest to a rationalistic world-view, stories about ghosts, revenants, /iM^-messages, and the like arecommon in contemporary tradition. Other typical themes in currenttradition deal with the appearance of Jesus, flying saucers, and visitorsfrom outer space.65.1 The Dead WomanA man bought a cottage on a deserted island. One day he went outto see it. He was going to stay only for the day. That evening, justwhen he was getting ready to go home, he took a picture of the cot-tage. But when he had the picture developed, he discovered some-thing strange. In front of the cottage stood a woman he had neverseen before. He went to the police and showed them the picture.They told him that the woman had died a number of years before.In this story modern technology is employed to confirm thetraditional belief in revenants."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Urban Folklore Today 383Collected in 1969 by Magne Velure from Geir Olsen (10 yearsold) at Christi Krybbe School, Bergen (Norway).

When they got to thecemetery, they saw a light, but there was nobody holding it. Oneboy asked the other what it could be. He answered that the lightshowed itself whenever someone -was going to die. The light wouldwander along among the graves, and when it got to the church door,it would show the face of the one who was going to die. The otherboy did not want to believe him, but he said he was going to see forhimself. He stood near the church door and watched the light gettingcloser and closer, but nobody was holding it. When it got to thechurch door, he saw a face; it looked familiar, but he did not knowwho it was. He got scared and ran home. A week later he got sickand came down with pneumonia. He sent word to his friend thatnow he knew whose face he had seen. It had been his own.Seeing oneself is a traditional omen of death (Cf. nos. 9.5-9.6.).Today this story is reported among children, perhaps reflectingtheir concern about a subject that has become taboo in contem-porary society.See Reimund Kvideland, \"Historier om d0den som del avbarns kompensatoriske sosialisering,\" Tidsskrift for samfunnsforsk-ning 20, (1979) 565-72; in English: \"Stories about Death as Partof Children's Socialization,\" Folklore on Two Continents, edited byNikolai Burlakoffet al.

One day, when I was six years old, my mother sent me to thegrocery. I •was jumping and skipping down the road, when suddenlyI saw Jesus himself in the middle of the street. I stopped abruptly be-cause, you know, he was taller than any of the houses! I was notamazed, really, I just thought to myself:\"Well, well, today Jesus is coming to Vadstena to say hello!\"And I wanted to curtsy and greet him and tell him that I knewwho he was. So I continued down the street by his side; I was on thesidewalk, and he walked in the middle of the street. When we hadwalked for a while like this, he sort of faded away, from his head ondown, bit by bit, very slowly. Finally only his feet were showing,but I could see them, step by step. When the feet had vanished, Iturned off at the corner where I was supposed to turn anyway. I didnot think there was anything strange about it, I guess. I thought thatgods could come and disappear like this because they were not hu-man, but I believed that they existed just as we do. I did not tell any-body at home about it because I thought that Jesus probably took awalk in Vadstena every so often.This memorat was told by a 65-year-old woman on a Swedishtelevision program in 1972 about \"inexplicable\" experiences.

Along the road they sawa young woman, who was hitchhiking. Normally these womenwould not pick up hitchhikers, but this girl looked so sweet andfriendly, they gave in to a sudden impulse and stopped to pick herup. She climbed into the back seat, and for some time, they drove insilence. Suddenly the girl leaned forward and said:\"Jesus is coming soon.\" But when the two •women turned around,the back seat was empty.This experience made a strong impression on both of them.

They saw a young man standing by the side of theroad, hitchhiking. They stopped to pick him up. Their car was a two-door, and the woman was wearing a long dress —after all, they weregoing to a wedding —and so, she got out to let the young man climbinto the back seat. When they took a good look at him, they were abit surprised. He was barefoot and had long hair and a beard. Usuallythey would not pick up anyone who looked like that. But he had anice face, so they gave him a lift.They did not know what to say to him, because they were notused to giving rides to hippies. Then all of a sudden, after drivingabout ten to fifteen minutes, the young man said:\"Do you know Jesus?\"Well, the man and the woman, you know, were sort of conven-tional Christians. They got embarrassed by his question and did notknow how to answer him. Finally the wife said:\"Yes, we do.\"\"Well, that's good,\" said the young man, \"because, Jesus, that'sme.\"They shuddered and did not know what to say to that. Finally thewife turned around to look at the young man, but he was gone! Theystopped the car and looked at each other in bewilderment. Then theygot out and looked around. They were someplace on Western Jyllandwhere the country is flat and empty on all sides. They got back intothe car, feeling very ill at ease.

They are told for entertainment and to generate a sense of fel-lowship. In the so-called antitales, the element of horror is given asurprising and often absurd turn.66.1 The Murdered BoyfriendI know a story about a boy and a girl; it is supposed to be true.This happened in Germany. A boy and his girlfriend were out fora drive. In the middle of the woods, they ran out of gas, and he wentto find a gas station. Before he left he told her not to open the cardoors for anyone. While the girl sat waiting in the car, she heard awarning on the radio about an insane man. He had broken out of anasylum nearby. She sat there waiting for a long time. Suddenly sheheard a scraping noise on the back of the car. It got quiet for a while,and then she heard a rhythmic thumping on the roof. Just then a po-lice car drove up, and its sirens were on. The police officers got outof their car. They shouted to her through a megaphone to get out ofthe car and walk toward them. Under no circumstances should sheturn around. She opened the car door and got out; she could still hearthe thumping noise. But when she had walked some distance, she didwhat she was not supposed to do. She turned around, and she sawthe insane man on top of the car. He held her boyfriend's head in hishands, and he was thumping the roof of the car with it.I heard this story from a buddy the first time, but I have heard itmany times since then. No matter who tells it, they always say thatthey are going to tell something ugly and then you get this story. Ido not think the story is all that ugly anymore, but that is only be-cause I have heard it so often. When I heard it the first time, Ithought it was the worst thing I had ever heard, and everyone insiststhat it is true."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Urban Folklore Today 387This story was first collected in the U.S. in 1964 and probablyreached Scandinavia in the 1970s.Collected from a schoolgirl in Borlange (Sweden) in 1975.Printed in Bengt af Klintberg, \"Folksagner idag,\" Fataburen(1976), 288.66.2 The Trip to MallorcaThis is a story about a couple who was going to vacation on Mal-lorca.

When they got hometwo weeks later, they found the child choked to death in the playpen.The babysitter had gotten into a car accident while en route totheir house, and she was unconscious when the ambulance took herto the hospital. She still lay there unconscious when the couplereturned home.This story, which was first documented in Norway during theearly 1970s, has been turned into a serial novel published in 1978in the family weekly Hjemmet (The Home).

The mother did not want to listen to the girl, and she told herto go back downstairs. The same thing happened again, so then themother had to go down into the basement.

Adulterers and ThievesContemporary legends about adultery and theft tend to emphasizethe comical aspects of a given situation. At the same time, they con-vey a sense of uneasiness about the disintegration of traditional normsand values in modern society.67.1 A Terrible RevengeA man in Bergen, who sometimes after his regular job drives aready-mix cement truck, drove by his house the other day and sawhis friend's car parked outside. He stopped the truck and went insideto say hello. Certain sounds from the bedroom made it clear that thefriend had stopped by not to visit him but his wife. Without the cou-ple in the bedroom noticing, the man left the house and went to thefriend's car. He pushed back the sunroof and backed up his cementtruck. Then he opened the chute and filled the car with about two cu-bic meters of ready-mix. When the lover was ready to leave, he couldnot drive off because the cement had solidified.Later that evening the car was towed away. The incident has notbeen reported to the police.An older version of this legend was found in the U.S. in the1920s. In 1960 the story was disseminated by the American newsagency AP.

During a car trip high up inthe Pyrennees, the mother-in-law got sick from the cold and the thinair, and within a short time, she died. Because the temperature was solow, the body became rigid rather quickly, and not being able to gether back into the small car, they wrapped her in a tent they hadbrought, and put her on top of the luggage rack.They now drove as quickly as possible to the nearest town to re-port the death to the authorities and to take care of all the necessaryformalities.Because of language difficulties, it took some time before theymanaged to tell their story to the police.

Afterwalking around the store for a while, she stopped by one of the deepfreezers and took out a frozen turkey and stuffed it in her hat withoutanyone noticing. It was a big broad-brimmed hat. Then she put itback on and continued to shop as if nothing had happened.But there was a line for the cashier, and she had to wait. While shewas standing there, she suddenly passed out. Her hat fell off, and theturkey rolled out onto the floor.
