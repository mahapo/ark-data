LeRoy Ladurie. Th e European archives were full of scarcely-exploited materials on witchcraft and magic, which have fuelled a now vast bibliography: as Robin Briggs recently put it, “witches have . . . become big business in modern times”.1 Although it took some two decades for this infl uence to make itself felt in the fi eld of ancient history, with the important exception of a famous paper by Peter Brown,2 the topic has become well-established over the past fi f-teen or twenty years, its commencement conventionally marked by the publication of Hans-Dieter Betz’ collective Th e Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (19861), Christopher Faraone and Dirk Obbink’s Hiera Magika (1991) and John Gager’s Curse Tablets and Binding Spells (1992). Since then, a variety of issues and practices that traditionally received relatively little notice because they were held so decidedly to traduce the Hellenic ideal (Wilamowitz notoriously called the study of the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri ‘Botokudenphilologie’, as it were ‘Bongo-Bongo philology’) has been explored from a variety of angles. 1 R.

Th e editors of this volume, who have been engaged in a research project ‘Magic, Collective Representations and Power in Rome in the fi rst century CE’ fi nanced by the Spanish Min-istry of Education and Culture (BHA 2002–02584), thought it might be useful to organise an international conference whose aim would be to bring together some of the specialists working on the general topic of magical practice, and ask them to focus, where possible, on materi-als from the western part of the Roman empire, precisely because this area has tended to be perceived as marginal or secondary. Th e issue had become still more topical thanks to the recent discovery of several important new Latin curses: some thirty-four in the joint sanctuary of Mater Magna and Isis at Mainz, datable to the years 80–120 CE; around twenty late-antique items from the Fountain of Anna Perenna at Piazza Euclide in northern Rome; and a number of other texts, mainly in Germania Superior, to say nothing of the numerous British texts from Bath, Uley and other sites. We also wanted to give Span-ish scholars, especially younger ones with a particular interest in this fi eld, an international forum for their work. In eff ect, we had three general aims: to continue the general critique of the traditional ‘grand dichotomy’ between Magic and Religion in antiquity, to explore the implications of the new fi nds, and to suggest and evaluate areas for further research on the theme of the special or distinctive character of magical practice in the western part of the Roman Empire. Given the nature of the subject, and personal predilections and areas of expertise, it was not in the event possible entirely to exclude Greek topics, but we have done our best.We succeeded in obtaining a special subsidy from the General Head Offi ce for Research of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (HUM2004–20268–E/HIST), which made it possible for us to organise the conference at Zaragoza. Th e meetings were held in the comfortable lecture-hall of the New Library of Humanities ‘María Moliner’ of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University. Th e three main sessions of the conference were: i) ‘Magic in the Principate’ (M.W. Dickie, J.B. Rives, R.L. Gordon and A. Kropp; ii) ‘Magical practitio-ners and Roman society’ (H.S. Versnel, J. Blänsdorf, M. Piranomonte, R.S.O. Tomlin, F. Marco Simón, D.R. Jordan, C.A. Faraone andS. Perea Yébenes; and iii) ‘Magic in the Society of the Later Empire in the West’ (J. Alvar Ezquerra, M. Victoria Escribano and P.-Y. Lambert)."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"   preface   xiTh e published volume varies this scheme considerably. Th e sections are diff erent; the papers by delivered by Faraone, Gordon and Jordan have been withdrawn; several of those here published were not actu-ally presented in Zaragoza. Two of these are by Spanish colleagues who, though scheduled to read, were in the event unable to attend the conference itself (I. Velázquez and F.J. Fernández Nieto). C.A. Faraone off ers a joint paper with A. Kropp on issues arising from the Mainz tablets. Th e discovery at Chartres of the prayer by C. Verius Sedatus prompted D. Joly, W. Van Andringa and Gordon to write a version of their report especially for this volume (which, apart from being in English, diff ers considerably from that scheduled to appear in Gallia). Finally, in order to strengthen the representation of archaeological but non-epigraphic documentation, S. Alfayé Villa was invited to contrib-ute a piece arising from her research on the use of nails in funerary contexts in the western part of the Roman Empire.Th e Editors would like to acknowledge their debt to the people and institutions that enabled the conference to take place and this vol-ume to be published. First, of course, to the authors of the papers, who gamely came to Zaragoza and submitted the fi nal version of their papers in good time (the delay in publication is at least partly due to the decision by the editors and publishers of RGRW that all papers were to be in good academic English). We would also like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, whose grant covered the main costs of the conference, supplemented by some funds from our own research project. Th e Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University of Zaragoza deserves thanks for allowing us to use the lecture-hall of the new Library; also the Dean, Dr. M.A. Ruiz Carnicer, for having kindly accepted our invitation to open the conference. Th e Service of Culture of Zaragoza City Hall opened the Roman theatre and its museum to the members of the conference under the expe-rienced guidance of Dr. Romana Erice. Dr. Silvia Alfayé Villa, now of the Departamento de Ciencias de la Antigüedad of the University of Zaragoza, took care of the academic organisation with effi ciency and good humour. Particular thanks are due to Martin Dough for his translations into English of several papers originally presented in Span-ish. Finally, we thank our colleague H.S. Versnel, and the members of the Editorial Committee of Religions in the Graeco-Roman World, for inviting us to publish this volume in their prestigious series.Th e Editors"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONRichard Gordon and Francisco Marco SimónIn their collective volume, planned in the late 1980s, Faraone and Obbink set out to “establish the study of magic as an area to be ignored by students of ancient religion and society only at their peril”,1 by chal-lenging the conventional dichotomy between religion and magic, and highlighting the twin issues of the social meanings and uses of magi-cal practice. Since then, the importance of the topic has been widely accepted. Two fi ne synthetic books, by F. Graf and M.W. Dickie, laid out the ground for future work on concepts, practitioners and histori-cal shift s.2 A series of conference-proceedings has refi ned the debate over conceptualisation, located Greek and Roman magical practice in the context of the high cultures of the Near-East, and greatly extended our understanding of the classical and post-classical discourse(s) of magic.3 Considerable numbers of new texts, on papyrus, lead and other materials, have accumulated.4 Th e publication of doctoral dis-sertations, bibliographies, translated source-books and a companion, and the foundation of specialist scientifi c journals, have all helped to institutionalise the fi eld.51 Faraone and Obbink 1991, vii.2 Graf 1996; Dickie 2001. In the late 1980s Graf was commissioned by C.H. Beck to edit a manuscript of 700pp. on divination and magic by the Norwegian scholar Sam Eitrem (who edited POslo 1 = PGrMag XXXVI, and had otherwise been of consider-able help to K. Preisendanz, e.g. in checking the readings of PGrMag IV), which had been left uncompleted at his death in 1966 and was intended to appear in the series Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft (F. Graf, Preface to S. Eitrem, Dreams and Divi-nation in Magical Ritual, in Faraone and Obbink 1991, 175f.).

As regards Italy of the early and mid-Republican periods, granted that little is known, such specifi city seems assured; there is for example no known Greek parallel for the clause of the XII Tables condemning the spiriting away of crop-harvests by magical means (venefi ciis).7 Th ings are less clear for the later period. Even if the modes of dissemination to Italy and Spain are a matter of speculation, the earliest defi xiones in Latin assimilate Greek practice, just like the Oscan and perhaps even the Gaulish examples.8 In the late Republic, individuals such as the Pythagorean Nigidius Figulus (pr. 58 BCE), sobre la magia antigua, MHNH 1 (2001) 7–60, which is in some ways more helpful in being organised systematically rather than alphabetically.

Th e names on the lead disk from Cumae (ILLRP 1146 = CIL I2 1614 = CIL I2 4, p.1011) are all Latin, though the curse itself is in Oscan.

Nevertheless legitimate questions about cultural diff er-ences remain, raised in particular by the cultural role and signifi cance of magic in Augustan and Julio-Claudian Italy,13 which seems mark-edly diff erent from anything known either in Classical Athens or the Hellenistic Greek world, but also from the implications of newly-dis-covered documents.A colloquium held in December 2003 at the University of Münster was devoted to the issue of malign magic, mainly defi xiones; the result-ing volume contained the fi rst reports of the fi nds in the temenos of the joint temple of Isis and Mater Magna in Mainz as well as editio-nes priores of other new fi nds and general refl ections on the genre.14 Marco Simón 2002.

Faraone organised a meeting in the American School at Rome on the archaeology of professional magical practice in the Imperial period, inviting presentations not only on Mainz but also on the fi nds from the Fons Annae Perennae in Rome made in the same year.15 Our conference in Zaragoza16 was designed to capi-talise on these results by pursuing four main issues: the representa-tion and instrumentalisation of magic as a politico-cultural theme in the Empire, here called the discourse; the implications of new and revised documents relevant to the issue of the specifi city of Latin prac-tice, especially prayers for justice; the study of the pragmatics of Latin defi xiones; and the presentation of neglected or apparently marginal materials in Latin, up to, and even beyond, the Visigothic period. In the course of this Introduction, we try to weave together general observations on the wider problems as we see them with summaries, discussions and sometimes criticism of the individual contributions.17 It will be apparent that we have had to compromise in our selection of papers, since some contributors were less ready or able than oth-ers to adapt their expertise to our concerns. Th ere are also signifi cant and natural disagreements over the category of magic. Inevitably too, quite apart from the presentational problems involved in transferring certain academic styles into readable English, some contributions have required a good deal of editorial intervention.1815 Th e proceedings were published in MHNH 5 (2005) 7–124.

Otherwise, however, place-names (such as Leiden, München, Roma, Coruña) have been anglicised according to the Oxford rules. 17 We try not to be too crude about the nature of the possible contrasts between ‘Greek’ and ‘Roman’.18 One or two remarks on conventions are in order. Generally speaking, in keeping with the house rules of RGRW, except in those cases where the author provided a full bibliographic list according to the name-date system, the bibliography to each article contains only items cited more than once. Details of works referred to once only by any given author will be found in the footnotes. Where possible, to aid in preparing the indices, references to AE, SEG and other standard collections have been supplied even where omitted by the author. We have generally used the standard epigraphic sigla for dates expressed in terms of centuries, namely Roman numeral + ª for BCE (e.g. IVa) and Roman numeral + p for CE (e.g. IVp). To mark the domestication of the term ‘prayers for justice’ we have usually dropped the inverted commas. Th e tra-ditional English dialect word ‘poppet’ has been used throughout in order to avoid the inappropriate American pop-term ‘voodoo-doll’ and to avoid confusion with the word ‘puppet’, even though it too is oft en found in Early-Modern English black-letter"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"   introduction   5Th e Discourse of MagicOne of the basic heuristic distinctions to be made in this fi eld is between magical practice, which is in principle contextual, local, and goal-ori-ented, and the cultural discourse about magic, which, at any rate in a complex society covering hundreds, if not thousands, of local tradi-tions, like that of the Empire, is general and protean, constraining and suggestive.19 Th e major value of such a distinction is to caution against the naïve use of literary accounts of magic and magicians, witchcraft and witches, as though they were straightforward evidence for histori-cal practice, quasi-ethnographic documents, rather than heavily-medi-ated representations whose real historical value lies in what they can tell us about the nature of the discourse about magic and the complex socio-political functions it fulfi lled. At the same time, it is obvious that there was a dialectical relationship between practical action and the social discourse, albeit of a limited kind, inasmuch as features or aspects of the discourse provided hints and suggestions to those who felt impelled to invoke magical help in a given situation, and practice, notably in the context of iatro- and apotropaic magic, fed into the discourse. Th e distinction, though necessary, is thus not complete.Th e discourse as a whole was relatively diff erentiated and capable of supporting several diff erent agenda. But from the Hellenistic period the major one, and certainly the one we hear most about, represented magic primarily in terms of its subversive power and illegitimate authority, claims sustained by graphic stereotypes of its supposed agents, naked women collecting poisonous herbs on mountain-tops, raising storms, or grubbing for human remains in cemeteries, and magicians capable of opening locks without keys or commanding spirits to do their bidding.20 Such stereotypes, which included doz-ens of circumstantial details (circumstantiality, however, underwrites pamphlets to mean ‘fi gurine moulded for magical purposes’. Commendably avoiding ‘voodoo-doll’, Collins 2008, 92–97 uses the term ‘fi gurines’ for the Greek case, which is perfectly acceptable.19 Stratton 2007, 15–18. We may compare the historical role of ‘superstition’ as an ideological instrument, cf. Smith and Knight 2008. On the use of the polythetic term magic, we incline to the position of C.A. Hoff man, Fiat Magia, in MRAW 179–94, without accepting all his arguments. As historians, we eschew here any reference to the emic/etic ‘problem’ and adopt the rough and ready operational defi nition of C.R. Phillips (1991, 262) “unsanctioned religious activity” (Marco Simón 2002, 189f.).20 Graf 1996, 61–82, 158–83; Dickie 2001, 96–201."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 richard gordon and francisco marco simónonly the semblance of authenticity), might themselves be exploited to obtain complex responses from sophisticated readers, by, for exam-ple, turning the practitioner into a sympathetic abandoned lover, as in Th eocritus’ Pharmakeutria, or stocking a magical ceremony with every imaginable horrid item in order to produce—three infl ated goatskin bags.21 But mainly the discourse and its subtended stereotypes were used, in the manner that dominant discourses usually are used, to limit and control subordinate or marginal practices, by passing them through a grid of persuasive binary oppositions (e.g. legitimate-illegiti-mate, marvel-magic, good-harm),22 through infl ation of the theme of necromancy,23 by outright repression (interdiction of ‘magical’ divina-tion; trials, lynchings),24 rejecting the others’ right to speak (e.g. Pliny’s ‘Magi’), by belittlement (untrue, ineff ective, silly), by commentary (Democritus on the evil eye; ‘pulling down the Moon’ as forecasting eclipses; Pliny’s History of Magic),25 by social appropriation (pseude-pigrapha).26 On the other hand, because of the centrality of the marvel-lous to religious discourse as a whole, care was generally taken to allow 21 Apuleius, Met. 3.18 with Stratton 2007, 92f.; cf.

Saur, 2004) and Th e Latin Library have not so far had much impact on our fi eld. Th is no doubt has much to do with the conviction that, to be eff ective, Begriff sgeschichte must be based on more than word-counting.28 Nev-ertheless, Rives’ examination of one group of Latin words, based on the Greek exotic agentive μάγος, up to and including Apuleius, De magia, produces some interesting results. In surviving prose authors of the late Republic and early Principate to the Flavian period, magus almost exclusively refers to the religious specialists of Persia (a sense heavily stressed of course by Apuleius). Th e most striking exception here is Pliny the Elder, who uses the term ‘the Magi’ to denote the pseudepigraphic authors of Physika, in whom he found quantities of recipes for materia medica and materia magica, using animal parts, exotic plants and stones, materials based, as Max Wellmann argued in several fundamental contributions early in the last century,29 at least in part on Babylonian materials but also on collected (and endlessly recycled) rhizotomic lore, and implying a theory of natural magic associated with Bolos of Mende in the Nile Delta in the late second century BCE, and Anaxilaos of Larissa and Nigidius Figulus in the late 27 Cf.

We cannot tell whether Catullus used the word prior to Vergil in Eclogue 8, since his imitation of Th eocritus’ Phamakeutria is lost (Th eocritus himself does not use it); Rives himself thinks the background to Vergil’s usage might be familiarity with the ‘Magian’ pseudepigrapha; but we might also think of the translations and adaptations of Greek plays presented on the Roman stage in the late Republic, themselves infl uenced by the Hellenistic extension of the sense of the adjective μαγικός.32 At latest by the time of Apuleius’ De magia, which is closely datable to winter 158/spring 159 CE, this wide sense of the adjectival form had evidently extended to the agentive noun magus, so that Apuleius has to make a special point of its ‘real’ meaning, while constantly betraying his 30 R.

Dickie’s paper focuses instead on the public discourse of magic, as transmitted to us by two Roman historians, Tacitus and Dio Cassius. Both were members of the Senate, both knew the workings of court life and court intrigue at fi rst hand, and what they have to tell us about educated, but of course not philosophers’, views of the related themes of divination and magic nicely complements Rives’ account.34 Dickie argues fi rst that both historians, in a perfectly conventional and predictable man-ner, disapproved of recourse to magic and private divination. Tacitus seems to have some understanding of the fascination the sheer avail-ability of occult power might exercise, especially over the young; both however see the danger it posed primarily in terms of public order, of the threats to the state that might grow out the fears and supersti-tions aroused by alarmist prophecy. One gets a sense of the volatil-ity of urban populations, of the vulnerability of the dominant order.35 Th is is, as it were, their grave and responsible public face. Dickie also shows, on the other hand, how ambiguous they both are about the possibility of magic itself. Both refl ect the fi ssures and debates of the world around them: the fear of being ‘caught’ by a curse, the mock-ery of the vain pretensions of magicians, the interest in cases where it may have worked (as in love-magic) and where it certainly seemed to have failed (Hadrian’s fatal dropsy), the fascination with the death of Germanicus,36 the stress on divination(-magic) rather than other categories, the oscillation between offi cial actionism and indiff erence. Both also reveal the role of rumour and gossip, itself central to court 33 Cf. N.

For Tacitus, the trial of Libo Drusus, pathetic as he was, and the subsequent denuncia-tion, execution and exile of diviners and magicians, marked what he chooses to claim was the fi rst occasion when the combination of dela-tion, greed, suspicion, sycophancy and fear made its appearance in the context of a trial for maiestas, where the sheer opacity of the notion of magica sacra played straight into the hands of those skilled in the art of innuendo.38 Since rumour and stereotype were all there was to go on, and no one knew what might count as evidence, accusations of magic were the perfect instrument of tyranny. At the same time, he uses astrology to convey Tiberius’ duplicity, thereby anticipating Dio Cassius’ use of the theme of magic as a metaphor for the state of the Empire: by the time of the ‘second paganism’ it was by no means unthinkable that emperors themselves might use magic and admire magicians just as they certainly made use of astrology and admired its skilled practitioners. Th e report that Alamannic wizards claimed to have sent Caracalla nightmare visions of Severus and Geta injects a sudden sense of the doubt that in the long run the Empire could maintain its northern frontier, a fear that proved all too well-founded a mere twenty years later.39It is now reasonably well-established that there was no law specifi cally forbidding the practice of magic during the Principate, as Mommsen surmised, but that the Republican lex Cornelia de sicariis et venefi cis provided a basis for accusations, punctuated by Senatus consulta relat-ing to specifi c incidents, which duly infl uenced their formulation.

Th e more closely the defendant fi tted into the appropriate ste-reotypes, the worse for him or her. At the same time skills in charm-ing and herb-lore, expertise in folk-methods of divination, charismatic healing, i.e. marginal religious expertise of all kinds, were widespread in the population, the instrumental under-belly of civic religion; these practices were familiar, at least in general outline, and provided the experiential basis for stories, rumours and social stereotypes, which in turn formed the humus in which accusations fl ourished, as well as many of the supposed details of the actions involved.40At all social levels, there was an ever-present temptation to use such material to gain advantage in cases of confl icts and quarrels between families, villagers, the inhabitants of vici in towns. Such instrumen-talisation of fears for personal advantage and private revenge was par-ticularly easy during the incidence of widespread infectious disease (‘plague’), social unrest, military disaster.41 Th e opportunity for social actors to present themselves as innocent victims of others’ wicked-ness has always proved a highly eff ective psychological mechanism for repressing consciousness of one’s own wrong-doing. As Th eres Fögen argued in 1995 (Fögen 1995), however, none of this low-level ‘trouble’ much interested the authorities; the main driving force behind consid-ered repression of magic in the Principate, from the time of Tiberius, if not earlier under Augustus, was illicit divination and the fear that this might involve a direct attack upon the person of the emperor. Th e sheer vagueness of the notion of magic in this connection, horrifying but wholly impalpable, made it a useful plank in the construction of an ideological counter-order as the inherent problems of maintaining 40 It is however in our view doubtful that the educated public at Rome, poets included, enjoyed “[eine] große Vertrautheit mit der Auff ührung von Zauberritua-len”, as Kropp 2008b, 66 claims.

Nevertheless, Arianism remained on the polit-ical agenda. One of the major inducements to declare the Catholic Church both Nicene and the offi cial Roman state religion was the Arianism of the omnipresent Germanic peoples, by means of which they defi ned themselves and affi rmed their distinctive ethnic identity. It was thus that John Chrysostom, as bishop of Constantinople, for-bade the Gothic community to worship in the city, but assigned them the church of St Paul outside the walls, and made repeated eff orts to convert them to Nicenism (Th eodoret, HE 5.30). Escribano shows how Eunomianism threatened fi rst to disrupt the settlement of 381 and then to infi ltrate the administration and the imperial guard, caus-ing Th eodosius to react in a series of repressive measures, all of which apparently failed to make much impression. Finally, aft er the fall of Rufi nus, the eunuch Eutropius resolved to treat, or threaten to treat, the Eunomians (Eunomius himself had died in 396/7) as sorcerers, perhaps basing himself on the relevant passages of the Pauline Senten-tiae that forbade the mere possession of books of magic. So to fuse the categories of heretic and sorcerer was unprecedented, and evidently unsuccessful: we never hear of anyone being put to death under this legislation, and the Eunomians seem to have continued successfully to infi ltrate the central bureaucracy.47 Th e paper provides an example of the temptation of using the heaviest hammer available in a context 46 Th e paper forms part of a more extensive series on the constellation imperial power and the politics of heresy by the same author: Graciano, Teodosio y el Ilírico: la constitutio Nullus (locus) haereticis (CTh . 16.5.6. 381), RIDA 51 (2004) 133–66; eadem, De his qui super religione contendunt: la constitutio 16.4.2 (388) del Codex Th eodosia-nus, Antiquité Tardive 13 (20059 265–79, Disidencia doctrinal y marginación geográ-fi ca en el s.

Th e complete absence of traces of Graeco-Egyptian magic helps confi rm the consensus that the latter tradition was more or less completely unknown (outside Egypt) until, say, late IIp. Second, their range and variety indicates that, just as at Bath and Uley, there was no set of pre-existing templates or formulae at the joint shrine of Isis and the Mater Magna, even if certain topoi recur in the longer texts.60 Eight or nine consist simply of one or more names, or brief injunctions directed to unstated addressees, and are thus to be classed as conventional defi xiones; yet others explore the metaphoric possi-bilities off ered by the melting-ritual, of reversal, negation, sterility and misfortune; others again deploy a considerable range of themes explic-itly linked with the rites of the temple and demonstrating familiarity with specifi cally Roman votive practice;61 still others display a convinc-ing grasp of rhetorical, and quasi-legal, expertise.62 Th is variety implies not merely that cursing was an acknowledged and widely-understood 60 Witteyer however emphasises the rule-bound nature of the rituals followed in depositing the tablets (2004, 49; 2005, 118). Two of the three surviving clay poppets had been thrown into a well; the third had been buried with a lead tablet (Blänsdorf 2008, 54 no. 3 = Blänsdorf ’s no. 10, p. 177 below), a lamp, some fruit and a small pot in a ditch fi lled with rubbish. Th ey seem to be a little later than the ensemble in the shaft behind the temple; see Witteyer 2004, 43f. with fi g. 15; 2005, 109–14 with fi g. 3 (p. 110). Th ere is reason to believe that originally many more such poppets were deposited in the temple area, but they have disintegrated. 61 In some areas, for example the importance of Attis in the cult (who in one text is called the benedictus, the ‘dear deceased’, of Mater Magna), and the imaginative impact of blood-letting, the Mainz texts, and other recently-published defi xiones from Alcácer do Sal and Groß-Gerau that invoke Attis, are of considerable interest for the history of the provincial cult of the Mater Magna in the late Ip/early IIp, cf. Alvar 2008, 67f., 70 n. 139, 172 n. 82 etc.; Blänsdorf 2008, 49f. Another text proves that the archigalli existed well before the offi cial institution of the Archigallate (Blänsdorf 2008, 60 no. 10).62 Take for example the phrase ut tu me vindices de in AE 2005: 1122 (= Blänsdorf no.7 here): although the dominant meaning of vindicare in curse-contexts is certainly ‘exact reparation for, avenge’ (OLD s.v. senses 5, 6) here it inevitably recalls the issue of vindicatio in the Roman law of possession and rights to property or goods. Th e main problem in any dispute over property or goods was to prove that one was the (true) owner (the legal process was called vindicatio). With regard to goods and things, if one had neither made them oneself nor captured them in war, but acquired them e.g. by trade, this might be very diffi cult and involve a virtually endless regress. It would be even more diffi cult in cases of deposit (i.e. goods voluntarily left with a second party), since the praetor or judge would normally grant possession to the person who had held the goods for the longer period in the past twelve-months (usucapio), in this case presumably Ulattius. Here vindices surely alludes to the principal’s belief that she was the rightful owner even though a court might well see the situation diff erently."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 richard gordon and francisco marco simónform of religious action (including an appreciation of the conditions under which it might appropriately be resorted to) but that concrete or specifi c models of how to go about such an enterprise were wide-spread even within a provincial Roman population (the bulk of the population of Mainz seems to have come from Cisalpina, Lugdunensis and Belgica).63 Even if, as Versnel and Tomlin argue, they rely upon a belief common to the Mediterranean world—the idea that we can ask the gods for justice—these texts show that even at a single site in Germania Superior there was a wide spectrum of opinion about how best to realise that goal. Although Attis and the Mater Magna do fi gure in some texts, it seems very unlikely that the institution of cursing was brought to Mainz either by the priests or by the (archi)galli and bel-lonarii mentioned in four of them.64Th e sole Latin texts that can be compared with the most accom-plished of the Mainz texts are the fi ve well-known Johns Hopkins texts from Rome (Porta Salaria) or nearby, addressed to Proserpine; and they acquire their rhetorical impetus from the model of the body, whose parts they list.65 Th ey date from rather less than a century ear-lier, and, although they are aggressive texts, not prayers for justice, are modelled, at any rate indirectly, on Hellenistic Greek curse-patterns. Th ose of the Mainz texts concerned with redressing wrongs, such as theft and fraud, also seem to be loosely based on the prayer for justice, but Blänsdorf is at pains to show that the debt is mainly a typological one, and that very few specifi c themes or details can successfully be explained with reference to models from the eastern Mediterranean. It is rather as if the prayer for justice had already become assimilated into Roman provincial culture, and given way to a vaguer, dissemi-nated, model of how to instrumentalise the gods’ general sense of jus-tice for one’s own purposes. Th is is consistent with Tomlin’s inference 63 On the composition of the population of Mainz, see K.V. Decker and W. Sel-zer, Moguntiacum/Mainz von der Zeit des Augustus bis zum Ende der römischen Herrschaft , ANRW II.5 (1976) 404–56.64 Th e fact that some of the most important Gaulish texts (e.g. Chamalières, L’Hospitalet-du-Larzac, both datable to Ip) are magical documents points to the tra-ditional importance of cursing rituals in this cultural area: C.J.

In such a context, of course, the other side never has anything to contribute, and is left mute and worsted, whatever the actual complexities of the case. Such curses are thus in a sense similar to the world of real litigation they skirt or duck, with rhetorical skill far outweighing the establishment of facts in deciding the outcome or judgement.Th e second group of new texts reported here for the fi rst time in English by Marina Piranomonte is that from the fountain of Anna Perenna and her Nymphs in the extreme north of the Campus Mar-tius (the modern district of Parioli).67 Th e discovery of a handful of early objects suggests that the fountain itself was designated as a shrine already in IV–IIIª. A votive altar and two bases found in the revetment of the trough of the fountain have provided the fi rst evidence of ludi publici connected with the shrine, perhaps held on the Ides of March, perhaps at some other point in the year.68 Th ough these texts belong to the public religion of Rome in IIp, the great majority of the fi nds in the cistern of the fountain, the votive coins and lamps, perhaps the small wooden plaques too (which were presumably inscribed with mes-sages), relate to another, private, side of Roman religion that presum-ably continued all through the year, quite independent of the public festival(s). In addition to these off erings, the twenty-one defi xiones and the twelve containers from the cistern contribute yet another aspect of instrumental religion, the use of divine power to harm one’s enemies (though it seems probable that one or two of the eight commented on here by J. Blänsdorf are not curses, but appeals for aid.)69 One of the texts, in markedly Vulgar Latin, seems to date from II–IIIp; all 66 RIB 323, cf.

Just as at Mainz, the fi nds show that, even within the category ‘inscribed texts’, there was no single, widespread model of how to invoke divine power to harm one’s enemies. At the level of technique, one might simply choose to prepare one’s own lead-tablet by hammering it out cold, inscribing it and throwing it into the cistern accompanied by the appropriate ritual, as at Bath (cf. Tomlin 1988, 81–84); one could make tiny lead plaques, inscribe them, and fi t them into the nozzle of a lamp, as a metonym of the transfer of the message into the hands of the Nymphs; one could ‘presentify’ (rather than conjure) the daemon envisaged by drawing an image of him or it ferrying the victim’s name away (as in the PGrMag); or one could commission an elaborate set of containers from a specialist practitioner, who in this case would prepare a poppet enclosed around a sliver of bone; one could go even further and enclose the poppet in a lead carapace, subject it to a dumb-show of being devoured by a snake, and drive nails through it, all as deictic acts to convey to the other world the principal’s wishes. At the linguistic level, one could confi ne oneself simply to naming a name (and perhaps distorting, or disturbing, it as a deictic model or pre-scription); proceed to deploy certain declaratives, words of dedication, devotion, consignment; add key religious terms, rogo, petere, divinum; and fi nally compose a regular malign prayer that includes all these more elementary ideas. Th ese variations, like those of the Latinity, sug-gest that most of the texts, except the possible requests for help and at least some of the containers, represent, like those at Mainz, attempts by individuals to get even with enemies, those who have wronged or cheated them.Th e great interest of the fi nd, though, is its late date. Although a considerable number of late-Roman pagan defi xiones are now known, they tend to be focused on public spectacles, charioteering and vena-tiones.70 Th e Porta S. Sebastiano group, which was found in a tomb, and is exclusively the work of one or more Greek-speaking special-ist practitioners drawing on Graeco-Egyptian models, provides in fact the closest parallel to some at least of the late-IVp defi xiones from the Fountain, not merely in the possible invocation of Seth but also in 70 See Table 3 in Tremel 2004, 39."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"   introduction   21the role of images in the production of curses.71 Without following Fernández Nieto in his thesis of semantic vacancy, we may note that the canisters imply a shift of assumed effi cacy from written text to indicative or deictic performance, ranging from the extreme, almost obsessive, care with which the poppets are sequestered (i.e. indicatively removed from normal social bonds) to the preference for ‘imperative illustration’ and ‘vertical writing’, the written text shrivelling to the status of a mere identifi er of the victim. Given the logorrhoea of the Porta S. Sebastiano group, we should not make too much of this shift ; the diff erences between the individual PGrMag formularies clearly show that images might play quite diff erent roles in the praxis of dif-ferent Graeco-Egyptian practitioners (and in the preferences of collec-tors of recipes). Nevertheless the shift at the nymphaeum away from inscribed text as the eff ective cursing mode in favour of alternatives seems suggestive in the wider context of the long retreat both from public epigraphic culture (except at the level of the administration) and from personal literacy.Th ere is a further similarity between Porta Sebastiano and the defi -xiones from the Fountain, namely the complete absence of appeal to Christian formulae. One might be tempted to argue that the material from the Anna Perenna site, both coin-off erings and defi xiones, pro-vides fresh evidence for the ‘basic’ paganism of the mass of the popula-tion, not subjected to the patronage pressures eff ective on great estates, long aft er much of the élite had declared itself Christian.72 However, in 71 Wünsch 1898 = DTAud 140–87; cf.

Wünsch estimated that there had originally been about 60 defi xiones in this group, of which he was able to publish thirty-four (1898, 5).

Joh. 7.7), and the late fi ft h-century dispute of Gelasius, bishop of Rome (492–96), with the patroni, the members of the Christian Roman elite who, allegedly under pressure from the rabble, wished to continue the celebration of the annual Lupercalia,73 it may be preferable to reckon in terms of ad hoc roles and crisis situations, for which pagan models were available but as yet no Christian ones. Th e fact that extremely few Christian defi xiones of this period are known from Rome may only mean that the type of text familiar from the Coptic evidence was simply not being written there.His regular surveys in Britannia of new British epigraphical fi nds, together with his exemplary publication of the tablets from the shrine of Sulis Minerva at Bath, and his continuing work on the Uley texts, have given Roger Tomlin an unrivalled knowledge of the range of British curse-texts, above all the prayers for justice (theft s). Here he takes the opportunity of exploring the parallels between the latter and a small group of Iberian texts, through the genre of which he is mas-ter, the pithy epigraphic commentary. Apart from improving the read-ings, his contribution raises two important issues: are the similarities between these texts so marked as to imply specifi c, even identifi able, colporteurs, or have we merely to do with a wide-spread belief in the possibility of de-randomising divine justice and exploiting the gods’ sense of moral indignation here and now, in this specifi c case?74 If the latter, how are we to explain the very variable survival of prayers for justice, which (to speak only of the western Empire) are uncommon in Italy and the Danube area, barely exist in the Gauls or North Africa, or, until the fi nd at Mainz, in the Germanies, but are relatively wide-spread—are indeed far more common than straight defi xiones (of which there are only six)—in Britain south of Watling Street? As Versnel also 73 Gelasius, Adversum Andromachum with G. Pomarès, Gélase 1er, Lettre contre les Lupercales et dix-huit messes du Sacramentaire leonine (Paris 1965) 20–51; N. McLynn, Crying Wolf: Th e Pope and the Lupercalia, JRS 98 (2008) 165–75. 74 In Tomlin 1988, 73, he suggests that the persistence of some formulas, such as si servus si liber, si vir si femina etc., from the second century to the fourth, indicates that they arrived in the fi rst century CE together with the idea of inscribed curse tablets, and survived as an oral tradition—there are simply too many variants of formulae to support the idea of hand-books. From that perspective, such texts are clearly also an aspect of Romanisation, cf. M. Feugère et al., Signes de la Romanisation, RAN 31 (1998) 299–353."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"   introduction   23points out, occasional references to the model of the petition may off er an important clue here: perhaps recourse to the prayer for justice implies the transfer to the divine world of the model of administration that underlies the institution of the petition, namely that of a rational, legal-bureaucratic administrative power which nevertheless requires to be infl uenced and (re-)directed.75 Plausible though the suggestion is, it does not take us very far, since the petition was an Empire-wide insti-tution, the prayer for justice not. Are we then to look for specifi c local conditions? What might they look like? Mattingly for example sees in the British prayers for justice (virtually all of which, insofar as they are prior to the constitutio Antoniniana, seem to be by non-citizens) as evidence for a sharp divergence between military and civilian religious cultures (granted that our impression of the latter is heavily slewed in favour of Hadrian’s Wall).76 Were there equivalents of Bath and Uley all over the western Empire, which have simply never been found? It seems possible, but perhaps now unlikely.77Th e last paper in this section is devoted to a survey of recently pub-lished (and still unpublished) prayers for justice, some Greek, others in Latin, by H.S. Versnel, again reminding us that the work of revis-ing the Corpus is never-ending. One of his main objectives here is to test whether some at least of the recent fi nds of curse-texts fi t his cat-egory, which of course they do. Some of his texts overlap with Tom-lin’s, which is a reasonable indication that the analysis works. At the same time more than half of the selected new texts fall into his ‘mixed’ category, texts that occupy the ‘border-area’ between defi xiones and prayers for justice. Th is has prompted Versnel to tackle his second objective, which is to clarify his understanding both of the relation between straight defi xiones and prayers for justice, and to develop a story about the historical emergence of the latter. Instead of imagining 75 Miss Reynolds has criticised Tomlin’s thesis that many of the words in the Bath texts have a legal fl avour (1990, 381). However, various parallels in their language to the Germanic law-codes of a century later, e.g. Pactus Legis Salicae, have been noted by J.N. Adams, British Latin: Th e Text, Interpretation and Language of the Bath Curse Tablets, Britannia 23 (1992) 1–26 at 26. Since there can be no question of a direct relationship, it seems likely that “both sets of documents were . . . drawing on the sort of phraseology used in late antiquity in quasi-legalistic discussions of theft and its consequences”.76 D.

Moreover, his own later work, and suggestions by others, have contributed to refi ning the ideal-typical features of the prayer for justice, for example in stressing the role of legal or quasi-legal language, the model of the ἔντευξις, the petition as a key institution in communicating with bureaucracy and contingent political authorities, the role of calculated or rhetorically-convincing emotion in the expression of these texts.Th e idea of a continuum allows Versnel to move beyond his dis-cussion of intermediate types in his main earlier discussion of these texts,78 to the point where he can off er a story about development: the initial prayers for justice in the mid-Hellenistic period developed out of the regular defi xio but feature a strongly-marked inclination to self-justifi cation and revenge for social embarrassment. Th e prayer proper however emerged somewhat later, from the context of temple-religion: its model was probably not the defi xio but the conditional self-curse, or perhaps grave-curses, which are likewise attempts to use religious means of preventing wickedness directed against ego. Th e appearance of ‘in-between’ texts during the Imperial period, such as many of the Mainz texts, is the result of attempting to lend the prayer additional rhetorical—or shall we say illocutionary—force by employ-ing features that belong to the ideal-type defi xio. It is however not appropriate to off er a set of purely linguistic or textual diff erentia: the same, or very similar, language conceals quite diff erent socio-reli-gious aims, which ought to be the real object of our analyses.

If the basis of social order is the successful integration of individual situa-tional interests into collective consensus, malign and aggressive magic can conveniently stand for its inverse (as we have already noted), while prayers for justice, irrespective of their de facto aims, make an eff ort to slip under the wire of integration. Although the individual who has recourse to malign or aggressive magic always has a personal justi-fi cation or rationalisation of his or her choice (the opponent’s judi-cial trickery, faithless husband or lover, ‘love’, fear of losing wagered money . . .), the more or less negative socio-moral location of such acts requires special linguistic and ritual strategies, which, in broad out-line, are available as culturally-specifi c stereotypes that can be locally adapted and embroidered as seems good. Th e formulas used in Greek defi xiones already attracted the attention of the Polish scholar E.G. Kagarow shortly aft er the Great War, and individual editors, notably Tomlin in relation to the Bath and Uley texts, have perforce occupied themselves with particular patterns.80 Th eir characteristic features have however not yet been studied by a professional linguist. Stimulated by Tambiah’s stress on the combination of language and practical action in magical contexts, and eager to avoid a purely symbolic approach to magical utterance,81 Amina Kropp suggests the application of Searle’s 80 E.G.

Her starting-point therefore is that instead of con-centrating on what appears on the tablet—the utterance—we should regard it as simply an aspect of a wider communicative event, the ritual, to which overt allusion may or may not be made. Th is allows her to make further distinctions that have not hitherto been gener-ally made, for example between the act of binding or piercing and that of committing or transferring the target to the implicit or explicit addressee(s).Kropp argues that the ‘manipulation formula’ functions ex opere operato, whereas the committal is normally to an addressee, who is then responsible for fulfi lling the curse. In either case, the tablet is to be understood as a metaphor for the target; the psychological advan-tage of committal is that responsibility for the event is devolved onto the divine sphere. Her main interest however is in the manipulation formula, which she treats as a declarative (which in pragma-linguistic terms eff ect changes in status). Searle himself has always left religious declaratives carefully alone; Kropp suggests that we need a new sub-class of declaratives to cover curses of this kind, which she proposes to call transformatives, utterances that lose their message character and themselves cause changes (i.e. ex opere operato). Her model here is the acknowledged autonomy of the evil eye, which is the ideal-type of unmediated magical communication.83 Th ough she does not allude to it, this approach recalls Marco Simón’s invocation of the African social anthropologists’ distinction between witchcraft and sorcery, and likewise one of Versnel’s criteria for distinguishing between prayers for justice and ‘straight’ defi xiones. Kropp apparently sees her transfor-matives as covering the entire class of curses, and sees no fundamental diff erence here between prayers for justice and defi xiones. Th e prayer or ‘complaint’ form is merely a diff erent legitimation-strategy.It is implicit in Tambiah’s performative account that magical utter-ance is simply one form of religious utterance, which is in turn simply 82 Her paper is in eff ect an English summary of her thesis, Kropp 2008b.83 Cf.

In Attic curses of the fourth century BCE one of the models for eff ective cursing was to simulate, virtually enact, through the manipulation of script, the reversal of the fortunes—or even death—of the defi ctus or suspect. A similar device is found occasionally in defi xiones and ‘prayers for justice’ in the Roman world, a cluster of them in Germania, includ-ing Mainz. Here however we fi nd more than a symmetrical relation between text and malign wish. What seems to interest the authors of these texts about the idea of reversal is its possibilities as a fi gure of speech, hinting at, but not stating, the desire that the victim shall be injured or die. Picking up an idea put forward by Rudolf Egger in the 1940s, they suggest that it was the range of meanings off ered by words such as averse that facilitated this shift towards the idea of the destruc-tion or even death of the target. Th e clear implication is that eff ective curse-models were widely spread in the population, and that they were subject to imaginative variation given the needs of the case. Th ere is no slavish adherence to a model, written or other. Th is conclusion is 84 Tambiah 1973, 218–27 = 1985, 77–84.

In some ways, this rhetorical approach seems to us perhaps a more promising way forward than the idea of performativity, picking up as it does Tambiah’s suggestion that magic typically exploits the expressive properties of language, notably metaphor and metonymy (1985, 37).As historians, we are naturally rather more interested in another sense of pragmatics, namely the social locations and uses of execration not sanctioned by a recognized social instance. Th ere are several diff er-ent types of questions here. Is there any particular rationale to be found in the genres of defi xiones, apparently beginning with the judicial type, much later extending to competitive sports? Given the existence of a wide-ranging discourse of magical power in antiquity, why is the range so limited? Why did aggressive (i.e. non-execrative) magic, particu-larly amatory and relationship magic, and later the prayer for justice, adopt the convention of the lead-tablet? How far did the democratic structure and ideology of classical Athenian society favour resort to judicial execration? Why is resort to judicial execration comparatively rare in the Roman Empire? Are defi xiones typically employed by the comparatively powerless in a given social situation? To what extent is recourse to magical action in this area a means of accommodation to socio-political change? Th e reticence of our texts is of course a massive hindrance to answering such questions; but that should stimulate the search for new strategies rather than cause us to abandon the attempt to historicise.

Marco Simón.88 Perhaps the most famous defi xiones from Spain are the three opisthographic tablets found by Martín Almagro in a necropolis outside Ampurias. On their publication in 1952, it was immediately recognised that they mention members of the Flavian senatorial aristocracy. Th eir interest however is not matched by their clarity; many diff erent scenarios have been proposed for them. Marco Simón, who has looked once again at the originals and here publishes fresh photographs of them, not only off ers a detailed new commen-tary (where he supports the suggestions made by the editors of IRC 3 about the interests of the principal) but provides a range of contexts, proximate and more distant in time and space, for this attempt to resist constituted authority—concretely, to halt Roman interference, in the aft ermath of the Vespasianic grant of the ius Latii, in what we may take to be traditional, or at any rate, extant, property régimes around Emporiae.Th e reported use of malign magic against members of the élite of course slips straight into a trope (the vulnerability of the eminent to envy), and as such may be exploited in a variety of ways: in relation to the deaths of monarchs, for example, it mainly aids in resolving the enduring tension between the frailty of the person and the political necessity of the institution; but it may also confi rm the desirability of institutionalised privilege by insinuating that only the Great suff er Tragedy; or underscore the malignity of Fate, thus uncoupling God from the responsibility; and many other ends. Th e death of Germani-cus is a case in point: reports of human bones and tablets provide far more than a mere explanation of a death. But other uses of malign magic against constituted authority invite us to refl ect, as Marco Simón does, on the evidence they provide of confl icting perceptions of the rights and wrongs of the same events: both acts of malign magic and accusations emerge not from “malignity”—though the targets vi -gorously claim as much—as from confl icts over interests.A failure to recognise the inherently confl ictual background of the mainly wretched evidence we dispose of (what aft er all does a defi xio tell us that is of any great importance?—the context, the details of the confl ict, the aff air, the situation: all that is almost always “off -screen”) 88 Note also his joint paper with I.

Th at litigation-defi xiones were intended to shut opponents’ mouths in court is obvious; such an aim cannot be ful-fi lled retrospectively. Emphasising “pre-emptive” simply ignores the realities of (in this case) Athenian legal institutions, the absence of qualifi ed presiding judges, the central roles of fabrication of ‘evidence’ and misrepresentation by σύνδικοι and μαρτύρες, favour and infl u-ence, but also the entire narrative of preceding events, the complex of actions, arguments and justifi cations that preceded the deposition of any particular defi xio that we happen to be looking at, which may well have continued over years, and that we know all too well from the legal speeches of Lysias, Demosthenes, Isaeus and the others.90 Th at is, as well as having a pragmatic intention within the tacit usages of local religion (and no one uses an appeal to such powers, whether we call them chthonic or demonic, to avenge an insult, even one that a Martial would be proud of: resort to malign magic has its own cali-brations of measure, which need close attention), malign magic in the context of litigation is a communicative form which implicitly tells us just as much a story about ‘justice’ as prayers for justice do in relation to theft and other forms of suff ered wrong. We can only guess what that might have been at Emporiae, but these three small tablets imply a long struggle between a complex of diff erent interests which Roman authority is on the point of resolving—or has already resolved—where ‘justice’, at any rate in the eyes of one person, or one group-inter-est, has not been done, and indeed never could be, either because the issues were too intractable to be resolved by a merely human decision or because it was suspected that the ‘others’ had used (more, or higher) ‘gift s’ and bribery of witnesses to obtain a favourable judgement.

Evidence for such practice is widely scattered over a variety of genres, but has suff ered from the excessive interest of an older generation of writers on folklore and ‘superstition’, for whom such material served a variety of largely discredited ideological inter-ests. Nevertheless there has been considerable advance in two areas, the study of amuletic gems, for which a fair number of well-prepared museum catalogues are now available,91 and the collection of phylac-teries inscribed on precious metal and bronze.92 Th e fi nal section of the volume is devoted to an eff ort to encourage discussion of this type of praxis. Th e variety of the genres considered, nails in funerary contexts, amulets against disaster at sea, personal eudaemonic entreaty, and a sequence devoted to late-antique/early medieval Christian magic, is matched by the diversity of approaches.93 It is here too that as editors 91 SMA; A.

Th is phenomenon attracted attention already in the 1820s, and has long since evoked two competing explanations: that the nails are apotropaic, intended to safeguard the dead from harm in the Aft erlife; or that they are defen-sive/protective, intended to protect the living from visitation by the dead in the form of spirits, δαίμονες, φάσματα, lemures, larvae etc. Most scholars, then and now, prefer the fi rst explanation, since the 1960s the second has become fairly fashionable. Alfayé’s point how-ever is that in most cases, apart from the extreme of violence against the corpse, driving nails through parts of the skeleton, there is no satis-factory means of deciding between them, so that it is preferable to see them as complementary, the one not excluding the other; and allowing that there may well have been several other (local) funerary practices involving nails that, for lack of evidence and satisfactory interpretative hypotheses, have been quietly forgotten. Th e model we use ought to start from the assumption that such rituals were grounded in a variety of ideas, fears and hopes relating to the deceased. It must however be said that there is little Graeco-Roman evidence in favour of the idea that the dead might be in need of protection in the tomb; it seems to be one of those assumptions brought into the discussion by armchair anthropologists; the overwhelmingly dominant tone of Greek and Latin epitaphs is that nothing can aff ect the dead. Th e most important implications of Alfayé’s paper however are, fi rst, that our appreciation of such practices is extremely selective, conditioned by apriorisms, with numerous tricky cases simply bracketed out or elided; second, that in the absence of explicit and clearly relevant textual evidence, even consciously symbolic archaeology rapidly comes up against its interpretative limits; and third, that local practice and rationalisation precationes, carmina et incantamenta des textes thérapeutiques latins, in J.-F.

Generally speaking, classical archaeologists have been inclined to treat engraved gems (intaglios), especially those set in fi nger-rings, primarily in utilitarian terms, as seals.94 However, the evidence of the Graeco-Roman Lapidaries, the ‘Books of Stones’, sug-gests that this may be only part of the truth. Th ese are the survivors of a large ancient literature, mainly in Greek, but also in Latin, most familiar to us through Pliny’s HN Bk 37, that described the marvel-lous properties, medicinal and magical, of precious and semi-precious stones.95 Taking as his example a brief Greek text, of Byzantine date but based on earlier materials, which lists seven semi-precious stones that protect the wearer against dangers at sea, Sabino Perea argues that the instructions, which include engraving a given gem with images of Poseidon or Amphitrite, support the idea that fi nger-rings with mytho-logical images may have been intended (also) to act as amulets, on the principle of the implicit historiola, the mythic narrative applied as a statement of a norm to a specifi c moment of adversity or calamity.96Th ese texts, which include Cyranides Bk 1, also provide insights into the implicit logic governing the choice and empowerment of amuletic gems.

It is of course the colours, markings and light-textures of precious and semi-precious stones that grant them this frontier-role; working from the marvellous powers of the magnet and the coral, acknowledged by all, the authors of the Lapidary tradition sought to integrate stones into the more familiar world of plant and animal remedies. In this eff ort, some writers drew heavily upon the abnu šikinšu tradition, the Babylonian lapidaries, which became available in Greek with the opening up of Mesopota-mia to Greek culture in the Seleucid period. It was along this fault-line, between ‘traditional’ Graeco-Roman ideas of useful stones, and the ‘Magian’ tradition, that Pliny, and no doubt many others, marked the diff erence between sound (medical) lore and magic. Th e argument was thus not about ‘superstition’, but about admissible or entertain-able degrees of the marvellous: are there limits to the transformations that Nature can achieve?Beyond that, the lithic tradition is an excellent example of the type of Hellenistic-Roman didactic erudition to which Mario Vegetti has drawn attention, intended primarily for the instruction and enter-tainment of a class of leisured readers rather than to provide prac-tical, usable information.97 It is of the essence of this literature that its ideological aims dominate the diverse materials collected and of course their selection and treatment of sources: each genre developed an appropriate discourse that governed the range of what must and what might be claimed, and governed the occlusions and silences that sustained its credibility as a discourse.98 Th ese features of didactic lit-erature imply that it is no easy or straightforward matter to move back from a literary claim to practical or real-world belief.

Such consider-ations also apply to apparently or overtly practical collections of occul-tic material such as the magical papyri.Amulets are theoretically interesting because they seem to off er not merely a means of escaping calamities but also a long-term promise of well-being, what we might call eudaemonic magic. Investment in an expensive gem attracts divine benevolence in special measure. Th e key move surely lay in the claim that ritual praxis could confer a spe-cial status on the amulet. Th e chance discovery in 2005 by a team under Dominique Joly of a set, or a series, of small turibula, stands for burning incense or possibly small off erings of other kinds, in a domestic cellar in Autricum/ Chartres, all inscribed with a prayer for blessings addressed to the omnipotentia numina, raises a similar point. Th e author, C. Verius Sedatus, clearly was a man of some pretension: not only was he at the very least a Junian Latin, and probably a full Roman citizen, as early as ca. 100 CE, which must have been quite unusual in the ager Carnutum at that date, but the knowledge his text implies is diff erent from the usual run of prayer language. His repeti-tion of the prayer in each cardinal direction (if there were indeed four such objects, four times in each cardinal direction, sixteen times in all), his use of exotic nomina magica, and his appeal to the authority bestowed upon him by the fact that he is their custos, their rightful keeper, introduces a hint of the exotic into what, had it appeared in a literary text, would have been considered a standard, indeed classic, religious context, the petition-prayer.Given that we lack a broader basis for interpretation, two quite dif-ferent contexts suggest themselves, between which it is not easy to choose. One line of argument stresses the likelihood that Sedatus was a local man of Gallic descent, as well as the vaguely Gaulish phonetics of his ‘names’, and looks to the Gallo-Roman background for an inter-pretative context. Th e interest of this possibility is that, like the cat-egory of judicial prayers, it stresses the existence of many intermediate positions on the continuum between what everyone in Graeco-Roman society (in the widest sense) recognised as religious behaviour, and what everyone recognised as magic; and also insists on the imagina-tive possibilities within acceptable religious behaviour opened up by the availability in the cultural context of a variety of means of power"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 richard gordon and francisco marco simónassociated with magic, including writing.99 However, one of the co-authors of this piece, William Van Andringa, an expert on Gallo-Roman religion, is sceptical of a Gallo-Roman context, and prefers the obvious alternative explanation, that Sedatus knew some early form of Graeco-Egyptian praxis that included prayer directed ‘cosmically’ to all four quarters. Between these options it is admittedly diffi cult to decide. However, if the date assigned by the French team to the script is correct, it would be extremely surprising if the requisite elements of the Graeco-Egyptian tradition had already reached Gallia Lugdunen-sis.100 On the other hand, we know nothing about Sedatus, either his reading or his possible travels; and the Erictho episode of Lucan, BC Bk 6 suggests that debates concerning magical eff ects were current at Rome already in mid-Ip, debates that may even have left their trace on the recipes of the PGrMag.101 Sedatus’ turibula can thus serve as an emblem of the wider problem of disentangling the magical practice of the Latin-speaking West from that of the Greek, the Graeco-Egyptian, and for that matter the Graeco-Babylonian, world.Th e functioning of amuletic gems is one of the issues raised by Jaime Alvar. He argues that we might re-contextualise the rather small number of surviving Mithraic gems in terms of competition between professional magical practitioners and mystery-cults over the off er of what Weber calls ‘salvation-goods’. Whereas the mysteries off ered intra- and extra-mundane salvation in return for longer-term commit-ment based on ethical virtue,102 dealers in amulets off ered their clients 99 Cf. F.

Marco Simón 2002 on Gallic magical tradi-tions mediated in Graeco-Roman sources.100 Jacco Dieleman argues that the London-Leiden papyrus, one of the longest and most important items in the Anastasi collection, probably dates from fi rst half of IIIp, though a date in second half of IIp cannot be excluded (2005, 41–44). Its contexts would have been assembled “not earlier than the late fi rst or early second century CE”. It may be that much the same holds good for the contents of PGrMag IV, the source of the ‘four-quarters’ texts that off er the best parallel to Sedatus’ turibulum, although the version we have is dated palaeographically to IVp. Th is makes any direct, or even indirect, Egyptian infl uence rather implausible; moreover, the earliest surviv-ing independent texts in the Graeco-Egyptian tradition, dating from Ia–Ip, are far less sophisticated than the great majority of the recipes in the Anastasi collection (see also Brashear 1995, 3413f. and n. 112 below, particularly the refs. to Kotansky GMA).101 See Gordon 1999, 242; on secrets such as the name of the Supreme God revealed to practitioners in the learned magical tradition, see F.

In the context of the wider aims of the volume, this discussion serves to remind us per contrarium of the central role played by divinatory magic in Pliny the Elder’s concep-tion of the topic, in the public discourse of magic, and surely also in professional practice, a centrality not adequately refl ected in any of the other contributions.Th e next two papers concern the interface in the late-Roman world between pagan and Christian modes of protective magic. Two Spanish contributions focus on the well-known Visigothic texts on slate. Th e general familiarity with magical practice in antiquity, as many have pointed out, made it inevitable that, despite the opposition of Chris-tian bishops and councils to such practice (which their highly partial representation of paganism vigorously distorted), situations of need would be met by traditionally-appropriate methods. Given the offi -cial dichotomy between God and the Devil and his servants, and the pagan tradition of protective magic by means of written amulets,104 such recourse was primarily of the latter type: Christian phylacteries, amulets, talismans abound.In his learned contribution, which is actually a translation and revi-sion of an article that appeared in Spanish in 1997, F.J. Fernández Nieto discusses a particular type of amuletic or apotropaic text, against meteorological threats to agrarian prosperity, above all hail (ad gran-dinem). Beginning with the latest in the series, an VIIIp text on a slate from Carrio, prov. Asturias, he examines seven parallel inscriptions, in Greek and Latin, all but one Christian, an analogous document 103 E.g. R.L.

It is probably mistaken to think of such texts, which are found over a relatively wide area of the Mediterranean, as belonging to a genre with specifi c rules; the surviving examples are rather living texts, deploying an optional variety of themes and techniques. Typical features include the naming of powers, benefi cent and malefi cent; the intermingling of Christian and pagan agencies; the invocation of sacred objects, including the blood of martyrs; and the motif of dismissal of ills (apopompê).In the tradition of the Catholic convert Erik Peterson (1890–1960), Fernández Nieto is at pains to demonstrate the antiquity of this type of text, and its emergence out of pagan sacrifi cial rituals, stressing the exis-tence in the classical period in places such as Kleonai in the Pelopon-nese of rituals against hail (indeed of local ‘priests’ with this function), the use of parts of apotropaic animals, such as seal- and hyena-skin, and the little information we possess about practitioners of weather-magic. Emphasis upon continuity however comes at a price that some historians may consider rather high. Consideration of the tempo-ral distribution of the texts suggests rather that they are a primarily Christian phenomenon, encouraged by the specifi c exemption of such ritual eff orts from suspicion of magic. Th e very fact that Kleonai and Methana became famous, indeed ‘interesting’, in the early Principate for their rituals against adverse meteorological phenomena indicates that by that time such practices had otherwise largely disappeared from public religion, whatever the case with private remedies. More-over the very traditional model of magical action used by Fernández Nieto impels him to treat what he identifi es as the magical elements as primitive, smuggled into the Christian context and sustained by rural ‘superstition’.105 It might have been more rewarding to examine ‘incer-titude’, the mentality of those who, in varying degrees, do “not cease being . . . pagan but . . . [do] not cease being . . . Christian either” (Kahlos 2007, 30–57 at 31).106 Or to think in terms of the ‘trans-subjectivity’ 105 On the polemical Christian use of ‘superstition’, see H.

An analysis of the texts in rhetorical terms (code-switching and meta-pragmatic strategies) and discussion of the mechanisms of dis-continuous transmission would also have been welcome.For her part, Isabel Velázquez suggests that two factors facilitated the transformation of a pagan magical tradition into a Christian one. First, the eff orts of the Church to extend its pastoral mission into the countryside, where the great bulk of the population resided, required a deliberate eff ort of simplifi cation of Christian ideas, resulting in the unintended consequence that traditional rural ‘superstitions’ were allowed to be eff ective even if not approved of by the Church. Th is possibility is illustrated through a brief sixth-century tract, De cor-rectione rusticorum by Martin of Braga, but something could have been said of the role of compulsory conversions in this context, or of the eff ects of the Christian trope that ordinary folk are by defi nition superstitiosi (Rufi nus, Hist. 6.41.1). Second, the issue of ‘vertical com-munication’: the school-system, where ecclesiastical institutions had a virtual monopoly, taught literacy through snippets taken from the liturgy and the Bible, and so provided a fund of decontextualised but authoritative sacred material, simultaneously devotional and charged with power, that lent itself particularly to protective magical practice.107 Th e Christian magical texts from Egypt certainly seem to have been composed in this manner.108 A handful of texts among the Visigothic slates from Salamanca province apparently represent a continuation of this tradition into the eighth century or even later; but they cannot be said to amount to very much.107 Cf.

Horsfall, Statistics or States of Mind?, in AA.VV., Literacy in the Roman World. JRA Supplement 3 (Ann Arbor MI 1991) 59–76 at 73–75. Skemer 2006 is an exceptionally interesting investigation of a parallel phenomenon in the medieval Church; he can show, for example, that many of his amulets were written by members of the clergy.

Lambert provides a sort of valediction to the theme of protective magic. Th ese texts, which are of greatly varying lengths and elaboration, were intended to provide the person who recited them with divine protec-tion against harm, especially spiritual harm, and various temptations sent by the Devil. Generally speaking, they combine a list of the pow-ers invoked with a list of the body-parts to be protected and a list of dangers and/or enemies. In this extravagant, sometimes virtuoso, employment of anaphora and lists they resemble, but outshine, ear-lier Christian phylacteries.109 Th e question arises whether a still earlier antecedent might not have been the pre-Christian protective amulets. Lambert can however fi nd no trace of a genre of pagan phylacter-ies intended to provide a direct counter to the listing of body-parts, even though the latter is a common feature of ancient aggressive magic (Versnel would say rather of the prayers for justice). Th at being the case, we are forced to assume that there were specifi c conditions in the Celtic Christian world that led to the greater emphasis on the theme of magical attack there. At the same time however the possibility that the lorica did in fact develop out of the Christian amuleto-phylactery tradition, and so ultimately from its pagan predecessors, cannot be fi nally dismissed. If we are to argue this, however, it cannot be on the basis of specifi c content; the Irish loricae are best understood as a local elaboration of the widespread rhetorical technique of creating lists as a means of producing impressive performances. It is as much the sheer use of repetition and the formal stylisation as the holy names invoked that generate the protective power of these texts; such repetition may suggest an ultimate origin in pagan defensive magical practice, but it is more likely to originate in a particular predilection in the Celtic monastic tradition for extended rhythmic liturgical performance. Here again the search for some specifi cally ‘magical’ quality or model proves illusory.It is naturally diffi cult to summarise the results of a diverse collec-tion such as this. Not only did some contributors fi nd it diffi cult to pose the question of specifi city, so that their view of the matter is at best implicit, but any conceivable answer would need to be nuanced. Magic is in fact a good minor yardstick of the extent and limitations of cultural borrowing within the ‘long’ Roman Empire from 200 BCE 109 Cf. also E. Bozóky, Charmes et prières apotropaïques (Turnhout 2003)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"   introduction   41to Constantine. If we allow that the basis of specialist magical prac-tice was innumerable, mainly illiterate, indigenous wise-folk, rhizoto-mists, diviners and healers, east and west, their practice is likely to have changed little over centuries, remaining bound to the plants and other substances available in the locality, and to the charm-repertoire and divinatory methods specifi c to the individual and his or her fam-ily tradition. Th is quasi-professional practice was subtended by belief in the evil eye and by non-specialist practices available within the oral folk-culture of each locality.110 To that extent, magic practice in the Latin-speaking West was surely conservative.Its major instability however was its moral ambivalence: the claim to be able to intervene in such matters for good implied also the abil-ity to intervene for ill. In relation to magic there can be no neutrality, only ambivalence, which is mediated by the relevant stock of gossip, rumours and historico-mythic narratives. Th e rhetoric and forms of public religion are never more than a fraction of the story. To this we must add the role of writing in the creation of a complex meta-tradition. Already in the classical period in Greece, the demands of school medicine led to the emergence of a written herbalist tradition that expressly suppressed the incantatory element of rhizotomic prac-tice. Th e Hellenistic discourse, itself a composite partly constructed out of mediated materials from the high cultures of the Near East, provided a multi-layered mythography of magic that provided a lan-guage within which some of the stresses of the collapsing Republic and emergent Principate could be expressed. It thus formed an aspect of ‘modernity’. Th is language also selectively shaped the nature of the evidence advanced at trials and the expectations of judges, and so the terms of Senatus consulta and legal opinions, infl uenced gossip and rumour, and fi nally also conditioned the styles not only of defensive magic, amulets and phylacteries of all kinds, but also of active magic. Th ere is nevertheless a major, indeed crucial, diff erence, so far as we can tell, between the Hellenistic discourse and the Roman imperial one, namely the central role played by the fi gure of the emperor in the articulation and social meaning of magic. It was this shift that in 110 Raymond Boudon has used this sort of line to defend a non-symbolic account of magic (what he sees as the Durkheim-Weberian theory): “La cause de toutes ces croyances magiques est . . . que l’inférence causale est une opération délicate et diffi cile, qui mobilise des a priori plus au moins valides selon les cas, mais qui sont facilement traités comme allant de soi par le sujet social” (1995, 133f.)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 richard gordon and francisco marco simónturn conditioned the legislation of Christian emperors and the formal attitudes of the Church.Th e introduction into the Roman world of the practice of writing curses on lead is poorly dated, but no one doubts that it was a) derived from Hellenistic Greek models and b) rapidly resonated among the non-Roman population of Central and Southern Italy. Much the same can be said about prayers for justice, whose Greek models can be rela-tively closely located and specifi ed.111 Both in a sense provided a new technology for long-standing needs. But under ancient conditions of communication, it is not so much the general technology as the recep-tion that must interest us. Generally speaking, so far as we can tell, it was not written models with precise formulations that were dissemi-nated, but loosely articulated ideas, tropes and themes, as at Mainz, which fed directly into local rhetorical strategies of cursing and self-help. Until, and even long aft er, the (geographically restricted) advent of Graeco-Egyptian models of malign and protective magical practice in the late I–IIp,112 written curses are locally diverse and variable in scope and ambition. In other words, they conform to the local diver-sity of the rhizotomic tradition, without being remotely connected to it. Th ere is therefore no simple centre-periphery pattern to be traced here. Th e Oscan-language defi xiones in fact provide a perfect metaphor for the reconstruction of Greek models in the West. Much the same 111 Note also the possibility that they have a still more remote origin in the NE: C.A. Faraone, B. Garnand, and C.

JNES 64 (2005) 161–186.112 Th e prestige of Greek as a magical language, and as a medium of Graeco-Egyp-tian magical competence, in the western Empire is indicated by the well-known texts from Carthage and Hadrumetum, many of which are wholly or partly in Greek (some in Latin transliterated into Greek characters) (DTAud nos. 213–98 etc.); the texts from Amphitheatre II at Carnuntum (e.g. Egger 1926 = AE 1929: 228); the late IVp Porta S. Sebastiano texts (Wünsch 1898); odd fi nds such as DTAud 123 (Bordighera); and the phylacteries on precious metal collected by Kotansky GMA nos. 1–23, 25–27, 29–30, 32–33, the earliest of which are nos. 2 (Caernarvon), 10 (Limoges), 13 (Carnuntum: Antaura) and 29 (Ciciliano: Vermaseren’s ‘Time-god’) (I-IIp), then nos. 7 (Badenwei-ler), 11a,b (hail phylacteries from S. Gaul) (IIp).

Th ey likewise seem to have been an originally Greek institution whose signifi cance was infl ected in accordance with local perceptions and requirements. In the Late-Roman period, for example at the Fountain of Anna Perenna, we can likewise fi nd fragments or shards of the by then widespread Graeco-Egyptian tradition, such as the cock-headed anguipede, adapted and creatively misunderstood to fi t local imaginative requirements. In other words, the general conclusion to be drawn regarding the speci-fi city of magical practice in the Latin-speaking West is a form of the point made by Perea and Fernández Nieto about ‘living texts’, which can be endlessly adapted to specifi c local circumstances.113 In the case of defi xiones, as Kropp points out, all one needed was a repertoire of themes and some conception of the appropriate ritual methods. Th e determinate context is always local.Future ProspectsIt is reported that in 2008 some 35 albinos, perhaps more, were killed in Tanzania in order to supply magical practitioners with limbs, organs, skin and hair for use in their medicines.114 Such murders are lucrative: the body-parts of an albino sell for well over $1000, and there is a lively demand, especially among miners and fi shermen in the region of Lake Victoria, for amulets and powders made from them. Niche-exploitation, commodifi cation and marketing are all at work here in the modernisation of traditional beliefs about albinos (which held them to be evidence of a curse on the family), in the context of greatly increased competition for livelihoods in northern Tanzania.115 113 Compare again the approach to Christian medieval amulets advocated by Ske-mer 2006.114 See Independent (London) April 4, 2008; ABC News, July 28 2008; Al Jazeera, Aug. 4, 2008; Suite 101.com, Sept. 30 2008; UN News Centre, Dec. 24 2008.115 For some reason, albinism is far more frequent in Tanzania than elsewhere in Africa. Prior to the colonial period, albinos in this area were routinely killed at birth; one name for them was zeru-zeru, “ghosts”. With the imposition of colonial rule this practice was forbidden, so their numbers greatly increased; one common explanation for them was then that the mother must have slept with a white man (mzungu, a term now also applied to albinos).

On the one hand, except perhaps in the case of reported late-antique magical attacks on emperors and saints,116 we almost always lack the background knowledge that might enable us to understand ancient incidents in the way we can modern ones. What social changes and anxieties might lie behind the depositions at Mainz over a half-century, which were certainly far more numerous than the thirty-four surviving tablets? Why Mater Magna and Attis? What might explain the highly variable incidence of charioteer-defi xiones and similar texts? How did shrines like that of Aquae Sulis or Uley obtain such reputations? On the other, awareness of modern incidents and trends, such as the rise of ‘witch-fi nding’ movements in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of post-colonialism, modernisation and impoverishment, may provide us with the parallels required to set up explanatory models. How far, and in what areas, does magical action represent an accommodation to, or exploitation of, social changes?117 When it comes to details, the histo-rian will fi nd numerous suggestive parallels; in the Tanzanian case, the selection of a natural sort-crosser, a classifi catory anomaly, as a source of magical power, just like the seal or the hyena in antiquity—where the norm is black, melanin-defi ciency becomes a sign connoting the other: a natural fact is read for its metaphysical signifi cance. Ritual murder evokes Horace’s ‘Victim’s Complaint’, an imagined scenario in which Canidia is about to use a boy’s body-parts for a potion to ‘catch’ her faithless husband (Epode 5); and even Erictho’s scouring of sarcophagi for body-parts (Lucan, BC 6.538–43) may no longer seem merely a fl ight of dark imagination.118More systematic exploitation of modern ethnographic material is one way of creating explanatory models for antiquity that go beyond the narrow focus on positive evidence that is both the strength and Tanzania has been growing by 15% a year since 2002. Although gold production is dominated by a Canadian fi rm, there are many ‘independent’ gold miners; many oth-ers search for semi-precious tanzanite under equally adverse conditions. Explosions and deaths by suff ocation are common, as are labour-unrest and even riots. 116 Cf. Brown 1970, whose model is still broadly accepted by many scholars.

Ambiguities of ‘Reality’ and ‘Superstition’, in Smith and Knight 2008, 313–35.118 In each context, it may of course be that these are just thematically similar rumours; in the Tanzanian case, however, the murders and mutilations at least are not imaginary (legs, feet and arms are the preferred parts)."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"   introduction   45weakness of ancient history.119 Another approach that would likewise widen the horizon is the investigation of concepts of risk and strate-gies of risk management in the Roman world. Such an approach has already been applied interestingly by Esther Eidinow to classical Greece (Eidinow 2007). She has creatively aligned the questions posed to the Zeus-oracle at Dodona as assembled by A.F. Christidis with the curse-tablets, conceived as an index of the types of anxieties that prompted individuals to appeal to deities for specifi c assistance or intervention. Such appeals rely heavily on tacit compositional rules, such as the pat-terning of lists, but their generic distribution points to the existence of a number of neuralgic risk-points in Greek society. How far do these shift in the Roman world? How are we to interpret the rise of magical measures against ‘self-induced risk’ in competitive contexts (or rather, we incline to think, of ‘deep gaming’) in the Empire?Another tack would be to approach prayers for justice, which mainly concern theft , embezzlement or other (claimed) fi nancial loss, in terms of conceptions of property, and legal regulation of loans, deposits and debts, in a very unevenly monetarised society; the relation between property and identity, property and honour, theft and humiliation; and the role of what is now called the ‘endowment eff ect’ (the psy-chological phenomenon whereby an item of property, merely by vir-tue of being one’s own, acquires a subjective value far greater than its exchange or intrinsic value) in legitimating the violent demands of the deity expressed in the prayers. Conceptions of (subjectively but also consensually) legitimate versus illegitimate aggression are also relevant here (cf. Goody 1970). Suggestive remarks about the place of revenge in Athenian society by Fiona McHardy could profi tably be explored and nuanced in relation to local societies in the western Empire.120 Such prayers might also be contextualised within some of the larger trends in the economic and social history of the Empire, such as the marked increase in the production of fi nished metal-products, the rel-atively high quality of clothing owned by “modest but not impover-ished citizens”, and the growth in services and secondary exchanges.121 119 An obvious candidate here is the evil eye, the subject of a forthcoming disserta-tion by A. Alvar Nuño.120 F. McHardy, Revenge in Athenian Culture (London 2008).121 Cf. W.M. Jongman, Th e Early Roman Empire: Consumption, in W. Scheidel et al.

Finally, can any correlation be made between the frequency of recourse to malign and aggressive magic and empire-wide albeit regionally-diff erentiated negative factors such as the Antonine plague (and its successors) and the political, fi s-cal and economic troubles of the mid- third century?122Moving away from socio-historical considerations to the level of the discourse about magic, we note that the level of modern discus-sion of the literary representation of magic, which is central because of the ambiguities and contradictions it is able to sustain, is far more sophisticated than it was. Th ere was no single discourse of magic in the Empire, just as a complex society of this type can sustain many dif-ferent types of thinking.123 Whereas historians tend to see literary rep-resentations as straightforwardly refl ective of, or even parasitic upon, reality, the critic views the reality (particularly in this area) as itself textual or narratological, mediated by the appropriate generic forms. Th is distance gives the relevant, and highly diverse, texts the chance to establish their own types of authority in relation to magic (or magics), and their own relationship to the audience.124 We therefore see the sensitive handling of literary texts in this area as an essential prelimi-nary to the construction of a more sophisticated and diverse under-standing of the discourse of magic in our period.Th ere are fi nally the primary documents themselves.

RivesOne of the most persistent problems in the study of magic in the ancient Mediterranean is the term ‘magic’ itself. Th ere has been much debate over the extent to which this word helps or hinders our under-standing of the Graeco-Roman world, a debate that is perhaps now dying down not as the result of any resolution but through sheer exhaustion among the participants.1 Th e reader will be glad to know that I do not intend here to add to that debate, except in one par-ticular and slightly oblique way. Th e English word ‘magic’, together with cognate words in other European languages (magie, magia, etc.), brings with it a complicating factor from which similar terms (e.g., witchcraft , sorcellerie, Zauberei) are free: because its derivation from the Greek and Latin word group of μάγος/magus is apparently so clear and direct, it is easy to assume that it reproduces the semantic range of those words in a relatively straightforward way. As a result, there is a constant temptation simply to translate μάγος as ‘magician’ and so let the ancient texts ‘speak for themselves’. But ‘magic’ and ‘magi-cian’ are in this respect truly false friends; even a brief consideration of the signifi cant diff erences between the conceptual landscape of ancient Mediterranean culture and that of modern western culture will imme-diately suggest that the modern words ‘magic’ and the like must have connotations that are quite remote from the ancient Greek and Latin * I am grateful to the other participants in the conference for their comments on my paper. I have presented other versions of this research at the Annual Meeting of the Classical Association of Canada and at the York-Toronto Work in Progress Seminar in Ancient Greek and Roman History; I owe thanks to the audiences on both these occasions for their comments as well. All translations are my own, unless otherwise noted.1 Exhaustion prevents me from citing here more than a few of the main contribu-tions: Remus 1982; C.R.

Some valuable work has already been done on this topic, particularly on the Greek μάγος and its cognates. Th e word-group in Latin, however, has received much less attention, and it is on this that I focus here.3I take as my data base all instances of magus and its cognates in extant Latin texts from the origins down to the Severan period. It would of course have been possible, and no doubt profi table, to widen the scope of this study, but practical considerations necessitated some limitations. In the conclusion I will briefl y consider some of the pos-sible avenues for further research, but even a fairly restricted study such as this can, I believe, add something to our understanding of this terminology.1. Th e Apology of ApuleiusIt is easiest to begin this study at the end, with the only reliably dated extant Latin writer between Juvenal and Tertullian to employ the word magus and its cognates.4 Apuleius’ Apology is by far our richest source for the use of these words, and allows us to sketch in some detail their 2 Perhaps the most important of these arise from the modern word’s complex inter-relationship with ‘religion’ and ‘science’, important modern concepts that have at best only rough analogues in the Graeco-Roman world; see esp. Phillips 1991.3 Th e classic study is that of A.D. Nock, Paul and the Magus, in his Essays on Reli-gion and the Ancient World (Oxford 1972) 308–30 at 308–24 (fi rst published in 1933). Th e most thorough and careful study of the word-group in Greek, down to the end of the fourth century BCE, is that of Bremmer 1999, 2–6 = 2002a, 1–7 = 2008a, 236–43. Th e only focused discussion of the word-group in Latin is that of F. Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (Cambridge, MA 1997) 36–41.4 Th e words do not appear in Fronto, Gellius, or Gaius. Th ey do appear in three texts of uncertain date: Q. Curtius Rufus’ life of Alexander, one of the pseudo-Quintil-ianic Declamationes Maiores, and Justin’s epitome of Pompeius Trogus. I here follow the majority opinion in assigning Curtius a Claudian date. I accept a second-century date for the Declamatio and for the sake of convenience group it with texts from the fi rst half of that century, with which it fi ts well in its usage of magus and its cognates; some scholars, however, have advanced strong arguments for a fourth-century date. Both the date of Justin’s epitome and the extent to which it reproduces the vocabulary of the Augustan-era original are uncertain; on the date, I follow the arguments of John Yardley, who assigns Justin to the late second century CE or slightly later: e.g., J.C. Yardley and W. Heckel, Justin: Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus, Books 11–12 (Oxford 1997) 8–19."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 55semantic range.5 According to Apuleius, they had two distinct mean-ings. On the one hand, they were terms from Persian religion: magus was simply the Persian word for ‘priest’ and magia, consequently, was the art of cultivating the gods that had been established by Zoroaster.6 But this, he makes clear, was a learned usage, one that he mentions largely in order to contrast his own learning with the ignorance of his accusers. Th ey, not surprisingly, used the word in its ‘vulgar’ sense, to denote a person “who through shared speech with the immortal gods has ability in all things that he wishes, by means of a certain amazing power of incantations”.7 It is worth noting that in substance these two defi nitions are not so very diff erent, since in both magia appears as a type of interaction with the divine. What distinguishes them is instead their respective connotations: in the former, there is a stress on piety and respectability, and in the latter, a stress on power and the fulfi l-ment of desires. It was with magia in the latter, negative, sense that Apuleius was charged, and it is consequently on this meaning of these words that his speech is most informative.Th e fi rst point to note is simply that magia is being used here spe-cifi cally as a legal charge, a crimen, and thus by defi nition connotes something undesirable and socially unacceptable. Apuleius repeatedly describes the accusation that his opponents brought against him as one of magia or, less commonly, being a magus.8 We may thus deduce that the specifi c details that they alleged in their case against him were illustrative of things that their contemporaries would normally have associated with a magus, although in discussing them we must remem-ber that we know about them only from Apuleius’ rebuttals. Given the stress that Apuleius places on the power of the magus, it is interesting 5 Apuleius uses them much less frequently in his other works; for the details, see below, n. 48. 6 See especially Apol. 25.9: Persarum lingua magus est qui nostra sacerdos; 26.1–2: Auditisne magian, qui eam temere accusatis, artem esse dis immortalibus acceptam, colendi eos ac venerandi pergnaram, piam scilicet et divini scientem, iam inde a Zoro-astre et Oromaze auctoribus suis nobilem, caelitum antistitam. In citing the Apology I follow the numbering in the Budé edition of Paul Vallette (1924). 7 Apol. 26.6: more vulgari eum isti proprie magum existimant, qui communione loquendi cum deis immortalibus ad omnia quae velit incredibili quadam vi cantami-num polleat, cf. Remus 1982, 151f.8 See, e.g., Apol. 2.2: calumnia magiae (cf. 67.1); 9.5: me magiae deferre; 25.5: crimen magiae (cf. 81.1 and 96.2); 29.9: accusatio magiae; 47.1: magiae accusare (cf. 83.5); 25.8: quae [accusatio] . . . Aemiliano fuit in isto uno destinata, me magum esse. For a broader statement, see 47.3: magia ista, quantum ego audio, res est legibus delegata."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"56 james b. rivesto note how little he says about the sorts of things over which a magus was believed to have power. Th e one that he discusses most is sexual desire: not surprisingly, since it was Apuleius’ marriage to the wealthy widow Pudentilla that incited his enemies to bring their charge in the fi rst place. Th us she is said to have never thought about marriage until she was forced by the magica malefi cia of Apuleius (Apol. 69.4) and to have confessed in a letter that he had drawn her into love by means of his magia (78.5).9 Apuleius’ opponents evidently also alleged that he had caused one of his slave boys to collapse, perhaps in some sort of trance (Apol. 42–7). Apuleius himself points out that if they really knew what they were talking about, they would have also asserted that he had used the boy as a medium in a divinatory procedure, some-thing that magi were known to do.10 But apart from love charms and divination, the goals towards which a magus was thought to direct his power are left unspecifi ed.What we fi nd instead is an emphasis on the techniques and even more the general style that characterised a magus. A magus was for one thing thought to employ certain types of rituals; so for example Apuleius’ accusers alleged that he had engaged in the nocturnal sacri-fi ce of some birds (Apol. 57.2–3). Th e use of carmina et venena, ver-bal formulae and natural substances, was especially associated with magi. Apuleius twice uses this pair as a virtual synonym for magia (Apol. 84.3, 90.1); cantamina fi gure largely in his initial defi nition of a magus (26.6); and the assertion that he had sought to buy certain types of fi sh, something Apuleius discusses at great length (29–41), presumably played on popular ideas about venena. But it was above all a particular style that marked a magus, that distinguished ‘magical’ rituals and formulae and substances from their non-magical counter-parts. For one thing, magia involved secrecy; according to Apuleius, so strongly entrenched was the belief that anything magical was secret that his opponents could easily reverse the logic to argue that anything secret was magical.11 Connected with this emphasis on secrecy was 9 See also 41.5, 102.7, and especially 87.2, where Apuleius responds to the allega-tion that he wrote a seductive letter to Pudentilla: cur ego blandirem, si magia con-fi debam? Th e idea of magia as something that enables a person to achieve his goals is here very clear.10 See the anecdotes in Apol. 42.4–8, which Apuleius sums up by saying haec et alia apud plerosque de magiis et pueris lego (43.1).11 Apuleius develops this theme particularly in connection with the allegation that he had placed a secret object, wrapped up in a cloth, among the lares of his son-in-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 57the association of magical activities with the night, as appears in the allegation of nocturnal sacrifi ce. As we have already seen in Apuleius’ brief defi nition (Apol. 26.6), magi were apparently also associated with the gods; as is clear from another of the allegations brought against Apuleius, namely, that he had commissioned a seal depicting a ghoul-ish fi gure, magi seem to have been particularly associated with the gods of the underworld.12 Lastly, magi were thought to draw on arcane knowledge and mysterious traditions, particularly those that derived from the ancient cultures of the orient.13To sum up, Apuleius’ Apology indicates that in popular usage the word magus and its cognates implied the use of secret and arcane ritu-als, chants, and substances, the knowledge of exotic oriental traditions, and the invocation of superhuman powers, especially those of the underworld, in order to achieve specifi c ends, such as inspiring sexual desire in another person or gaining access to otherwise inaccessible information. Th is conclusion may not seem particularly noteworthy: aft er all, these are more or less the connotations of this word-group that most people today would take for granted. It is therefore worth stressing that Apuleius’ Apology is in many ways a highly unusual text, at least as regards its use of magus and its cognates. For one thing, these words occur far more frequently in it than in any other Latin text from Classical antiquity: magus appears a total of thirty-seven times, magicus twenty-two times, and magia forty times.14 Th e word magia law Pontianus (Apol. 53–4); note especially 54.8: praesertim quod conditum cumque, quod obsignatum, quod inclusum domi adservatur, id omne eodem argumento magi-cum dicetur.12 Apol. 61.2: quod [sigillum] me aiunt ad magica malefi cia occulta fabrica, ligno exquisitissimo, comparasse et, cum sit sceleti forma turpe et horribile, tamen impendio colere et Graeco vocabulo βασιλέα nuncupare; cf. the description at 63.1: macilentam vel omnino evisceratam formam diri cadaveris fabricatam, prorsus horribilem et lar-valem; this is surely meant to imply some underworld deity.13 So at Apol. 38.7, when Apuleius is about to read the Greek names of fi sh for which he has provided Latin translations, he says iam me clamabis magica nomina Aegyptio vel Babylonico ritu percensere. Cf. his list of famous magi at 90.6: Carmen-das vel Damigeron vel †his† Moses vel Iohannes vel Apollobex vel ipse Dardanus vel quicumque alius post Zoroastren et Hostanen inter magos celebratus est; among these exotic names are some that would have been generally recognised as Judaean (Moses, Iohannes) and Persian (Zoroastres, Hostanes).14 Magus: 9.3, 25.8 (bis), 25.9, 26.3, 26.6, 26.9, 27.2, 28.4, 30.1, 30.2, 30.9, 31.9, 32.1, 32.2, 32.5, 40.3, 43.2, 43.8, 43.10, 45.5, 48.2, 51.10, 54.7, 66.3, 78.2, 79.1, 79.2, 79.4, 79.6, 81.1, 82.1, 82.6, 84.4, 90.1, 90.6, 91.1.Magicus: 1.5, 9.2, 17.3, 32.2, 34.5, 36.7, 38.7, 41.5, 42.2, 42.6, 47.2, 47.5, 53.4, 53.9, 53.12, 54.1, 54.8, 61.2, 63.6, 69.4, 80.1, 102.7."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58 james b. rivesappears here in Latin for the fi rst time, and remains a fairly rare word. More important is the fact that the text is unusual in precisely those respects in which it initially seems most ordinary. Th e connotations of the word magus and its cognates that we fi nd in the Apology are nor-mal only in hindsight; if we consider the speech in the context of what precedes it rather than what follows it, they are rather more surpris-ing. Even more unusual is the fact that Apuleius uses all three words with more or less the same semantic range, so that magia denotes the knowledge, abilities, or activities of a magus, and magicus qualifi es things associated with magia or a magus. In order to appreciate how unusual all this really is, it is necessary to examine the earlier material without reference to Apuleian usage.2. Some General PatternsPrior to Apuleius, only the noun magus and the related adjective magicus, -a, -um appear with any frequency in extant texts. As I have already mentioned, the abstract noun magia is fi rst found in Apuleius. It is worth noting that whenever Apuleius uses the word in the accu-sative, he consistently employs the Greek ending -an rather than the Latin ending -am; this suggests that he regarded it to some extent as a Greek word not fully assimilated into Latin.15 Similarly, the elder Pliny uniquely uses the abstract noun magice, which is clearly a translitera-tion of the Greek feminine adjective μαγική and presumably stands for ἡ μαγικὴ τεχνή.16 We may also note two other cognates, both very rare: the feminine noun maga, found twice in the Senecan Hercules Oetaeus (523, 526), and the adjective magus, -a, -um, found twice in Ovid (Am. 1.8.5, Med. fac. 36) and once in Hercules Oetaeus (467).It is thus on magus and magicus that I focus here. A brief examina-tion of the evidence reveals a very clear and rather striking pattern: the noun is more common in prose, whereas the adjective is far more Magia: 2.2, 9.5, 25.5, 25.10, 26.1, 27.9, 27.12, 28.4, 29.1, 29.2, 29.6, 29.9, 30.5, 31.1, 31.2, 31.4, 43.1, 47.1, 47.3, 53.2, 54.6, 58.5, 62.3, 63.2, 64.8, 67.1, 67.3, 70.3, 78.5, 80.5, 81.1, 82.4, 83.5, 84.3, 84.4, 87.2, 90.4, 96.2, 102.1, 102.2.15 Apol. 26.1, 27.12, 28.4, 29.2, 31.1, 31.4, 80.5, 84.4, 102.2. Later writers likewise use the Greek accusative: Tertullian, De anim. 57.2, Ammianus Marcellinus 23.6.32.16 Pliny is even more consistent than Apuleius in his use of Greek endings: in addi-tion to the accusative magian (30.10), we also fi nd the genitive magices (1.30 [bis], 28.188)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 59common in poetry. Leaving aside for the moment the elder Pliny, who uses both noun and adjective much more frequently than any extant writer before Apuleius, I have found forty-three examples of the noun magus in twelve diff erent prose authors, as opposed to fourteen exam-ples in six poets.17 In contrast, I have found forty-eight examples of the adjective magicus in fi ft een poets, as opposed to a mere six examples in four prose authors.18 Th is general association of the noun magus with prose and the adjective magicus with poetry can be corroborated by some observations about individual writers. Ovid, for example, uses the noun only twice, but the adjective ten times; Seneca uses the adjec-tive three times in his tragedies and never in his prose, whereas he uses the noun twice in his prose and never in his verse; Columella and Petronius use the adjective only in their verse and never in their prose; Justin’s epitome of Trogus has two examples of the adjective in con-trast to eleven examples of the noun.19 Th e fi gures for the elder Pliny add considerably to the totals, but do not substantially alter the overall pattern: there are nineteen examples of the adjective in his Natural History as opposed to seventy-nine examples of the noun.20 Although 17 Prose authors: Cicero (Tusc. 1.108; Leg. 2.26; Div. 1.46 [bis], 47, 90–1 [bis]; ND 1.43; Fin. 5.89), Nigidius Figulus (F 67 Swoboda), Vitruvius (8.pr.1), Valerius Maxi-mus (8.7.ext.2, 1.6.ext.16, 3.2.ext.2, 7.3.ext.2, 9.2.ext.6), Velleius Paterculus (2.24.3), Q.

In order to substantiate this assertion, it is necessary to examine the evidence in more detail.3. ProseAs we have seen, Apuleius asserted that magus was actually the Persian word for ‘priest’. Th is statement is correct, at least insofar as the word is indeed Old Persian in origin (makuš or maguš): by the mid-fi ft h century BCE, it had passed from Persian into Greek as the loanword μάγος, and then from Greek eventually into Latin. Whether the word was in fact the Persian equivalent of the Latin sacerdos is much less certain, since in Persian documentary texts it oft en appears with no obvious religious associations. In the Classical and early Hellenistic Greek sources, by contrast, the only non-religious context in which the word features prominently is the story of two brothers, described as magoi, one of whom usurped the Persian throne by masquerading as Cambyses’ dead brother Smerdis.21 Otherwise, the Greek sources are fairly consistent in their presentation of magoi as religious specialists. Th ey appear above all as experts in divination and divine lore, and are said to practice incest and leave the bodies of their dead to be torn by birds and beasts.22 Th ey are also, and increasingly in late Classical and Hellenistic writers, depicted as ‘barbarian philosophers’ who maintain the teachings of Zoroaster.23 From the beginning, however, the word 28.229, 28.232, 28.249, 28.260, 29.53, 29.59, 29.66, 29.68 (bis), 29.76, 29.117, 29.138, 30.16 (bis), 30.17, 30.18, 30.51, 30.54, 30.64, 30.82, 30.84, 30.91, 30.100, 30.110, 30.141, 32.34, 32.55, 32.72, 32.115, 36.139, 36.142, 37.54, 37.124, 37.135, 37.142, 37.144, 37.145, 37.147, 37.155, 37.156, 37.165, 37.169, 37.185, 37.192.21 Herodotus 3.61–79; cf. the very diff erent version in Ctesias (FGrHist 688 F 13); there are later brief references in Diodorus Siculus (11.57.1, 16.47.2, 19.40.2, 31.19.1) and Strabo (15.3.24).22 Divination: the early sources emphasize especially the interpretation of dreams (Hdt. 1.107–8, 1.120, 7.19; Dinon FGrHist 690 F 10 = Cicero, Div. 1.46), but note also the interpretation of omens (Hdt. 7.37).

Th us Cicero refers several times to the expertise of the magi in divina-tion (Div. 1. 46, 47, 90–1), notes their treatment of the dead (Tusc. 1. 108), says that they reject the practice of enclosing the gods in temples (Leg. 2. 26), and reports the story that Pythagoras studied with them (ND 1. 43; Fin. 5. 87). In extant prose texts, this usage remains entirely consistent down to the second half of the fi rst century CE. Magus regu-larly denotes a Persian expert in divination and ritual lore or a Persian ‘philosopher’, although two writers also refer to the usurping magi.25 Th e only instance of the adjective magicus is in Curtius Rufus, again with specifi c reference to a Persian context; for this reason it might be better translated as ‘magian’ than as ‘magic’.26 Latin prose authors thus seem to adhere very closely to the traditions about the Persian magi that had been established in earlier Greek history, ethnography, and philosophy.It is only in the elder Pliny’s Natural History that we fi nd any major changes in this word-group. One of the most obvious is simply the increase in its abundance and variety. As I noted above, Pliny uses the word magus far more frequently than any earlier writer. He is also the fi rst extant prose author apart from Curtius to use the adjective magicus, which he, like Curtius, employs as more or less the equiva-lent of magorum, meaning ‘of or associated with magi’. Lastly, he is the fi rst extant Latin writer to use an abstract noun to describe the ars of the magi, the otherwise unattested magice.27 Th e other signifi cant 24 Heraclitus DK 22 B 14 = Clem.

A few examples selected at random will illustrate the general pattern.“Th e magi are of the opinion that those who thoroughly rub them-selves [with a plant called antirrinum] or wear it in an armband become more attractive and cannot be injured by any harmful drug. Likewise the plant they call euplia: they report that those who thoroughly rub themselves with it acquire a better reputation. Th ey also assert that neither harmful drugs nor any wild beast nor even the sun can harm those who keep artemisia with them” (HN 25.129–30). “Th e magi say that sleep is induced by the gall of a nanny-goat, provided she has been sacrifi ced, either smeared on the eyes or placed under the pillow” (HN 28.260). “Th e magi assure us that tertian fevers are dispelled by crabs’ eyes attached to the patient before sunrise, as long as the blinded crabs are released into water; they also report that crabs’ eyes, wrapped up with nightingales’ fl esh in a deer skin, drives away sleep and produces wakefulness” (HN 32.115–16).Although most of the lore that Pliny attributes to the magi does not seem to diff er much from other such material that he records with evident approval, he oft en dismisses it with hostility and contempt:29Th e following is also generally agreed (and there is indeed nothing that I would more willingly believe): that for doorposts to be so much as touched with menstrual blood renders useless the artes of the magi, a genus vanissimum, as one may determine. For I will set forth the most restrained of their promises: they give instructions that you should take the parings from a person’s fi ngernails and toenails and mix them with wax (saying that you want them as a remedy for a tertian, quartan, or daily fever), and before sunrise affi x them to another person’s door as a syncopation of the full ἡ μαγικὴ τέχνη (p. 58 above), it can be counted a late Hellenis-tic usage that Pliny adapts to his own ends.28 Th e distribution of the words is in itself revealing: the largest clusters occur in the three books concerning medicinae ex animalibus (Books 28–30: thirty-seven instances of magus and seven of magicus) and the book on gems (Book 37: thirteen instances of magus and two of magicus): together, these four books contain half the instances of both words in the entire text.29 See Dickie 1999, 172f."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 63cure for these diseases. How fraudulent [quanta vanitate], if false, and how harmful, if they pass on the disease!HN 28.85–6Phrases like vanitas magorum or magicae vanitates constitute a virtual leitmotiv in certain parts of the work.30 Similarly, Pliny particularly associates the magi with prescriptions of which he disapproves. So for example he declares that he does not discuss abortifacients and love potions or other magica portenta, except by way of caution or refuta-tion (HN 25.25). Elsewhere he asserts that it would be a waste of time to describe a certain plant that is used only for love potions, although he allows himself one observation about it in order to expose magicae vanitates.31 In some passages he characterises the prescriptions of the magi as insidiae, against which people must protect themselves, as we see in the passage quoted above.32 Magus and its cognates thus have in Pliny a marked negative connotation.Th roughout most of the Natural History, the ars of the magi appears as the dark side of medicina: a use of natural substances that is disrep-utable either because it is fraudulent or because it is directed towards improper ends. It is thus not surprising that Pliny associates the word magus and its cognates with a more traditional Latin word-group that had similar connotations, that of venenum and venefi cium. So for example aft er describing various venena, he goes on to list remedies “against all these and against magicae artes” (HN 25.127). In another passage he explains that the fl esh of tortoises is said to be peculiarly suitable for fumigations, for dispelling magicae artes, and as a cure for venena (HN 32.33), and in a third he touts a certain type of stone as eff ective against all venefi cia, especially those of the magi (HN 36.139).33 Insofar as this fraudulent ars has any substance at all, he concludes, 30 Magorum vanitas: HN 22.20, 28.89 and 94 (cf. 100), 37.54 and 124; magica vani-tas: HN 29.81, 37.118; magicae vanitates: HN 26.18, 27.57, 30.1.31 HN 27.57: Catanancen Th essalam herbam qualis sit describi a nobis supervacuum est, cum sit usus eius ad amatoria tantum.

Where did it come from? A passage in Book 24 gives us a fairly good idea. Pliny begins by saying that “in connection with the promised subject of wonderful herbs, it occurs to me to say something also about magical herbs; for what herbs are more wonderful? Th e fi rst men in our part of the world to discuss them were Pythagoras and Democritus, who followed the magi” (HN 24.156). He goes on to discuss several plants described by Pythagoras in a book that others attribute to the doc-tor Cleemporus (24.156–9). He then turns to the Chiromecta, a work universally attributed to Democritus, “the most zealous student of the magi” next to Pythagoras (24.160), and summarises its descriptions of fourteen diff erent plants (24.160–6). Matthew Dickie has cogently argued on the basis of this and similar passages that Pliny took his information about the magi and their lore from Hellenistic pseude-pigrapha: collections of prescriptions for the use of plants, animal substances, and stones that circulated under the names of Pythagoras and Democritus and presented this information as the wisdom of the magi.35 Th ese texts evidently built on the established Greek view of the magi that I sketched above; indeed, it presupposed the tradition that the magi were barbarian philosophers with whom Greek philosophers had studied. If we can take Pliny as a guide, they seem to have repre-sented the magi as eastern, and specifi cally Persian, ritual specialists with a particular expertise in divination.36 But these works augmented 34 HN 30.17: proinde ita persuasum sit, intestabilem, inritam, inanem esse, haben-tem tamen quasdam veritatis umbras, sed in his venefi cas artes pollere, non magicas. 35 Dickie 1999, 173–83, summarising the work of Max Wellmann, e.g. Die φυσικά des Bolos Demokritos und der Magier Anaxilaos aus Larissa, APAW 1928.7 (Ber-lin 1928); idem, Die Stein- und Gemmenbücher der Antike, in Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaft en und der Medizin 4.4 (1935) 86–110; cf.

In the famous discussion of magicae vanitates with which he opens Book 30, how-ever, we fi nd an even wider range yet. Since this passage has been so oft en discussed, I will confi ne myself here to a few key points.37 First, although he asserts that magice or the ars magica began in Persia with Zoroaster, he also associates it with many other places, persons, and traditions: with Telmessus and Th essaly, with Orpheus and Th race, with Moses and the Judaeans, with Cyprus, with archaic practices in Italy and Rome, and with Gaul and Britain.38 Secondly, although he analyses it as drawing on medicina, religio, and the artes mathemati-cae, he associates with it a whole mélange of miraculous feats and ‘for-eign’ ritual practices: the shape shift ing of Proteus and Circe and the consultation of the dead in the Odyssey, the Th essalian trick of calling down the moon, human sacrifi ce, and various forms of divination, including necromancy. All of this suggests that for Pliny the semantic range of magus and its cognates was by no means limited to what we fi nd in earlier prose, or even to what we fi nd in the rest of the Natural History, but was almost indefi nitely extendable.Th e use of this word-group in prose writers later than Pliny presents a contrast both with that of the earlier period and with that of Pliny himself. It is diffi cult to draw any fi rm conclusions, because we have so very few examples: magus occurs twice in Quintilian and twice in one of the pseudo-Quintilianic Declamationes Maiores, fi ve times in Taci-tus, and once in Suetonius; magicus appears once in the Declamationes Maiores and twice in Tacitus.39 Nevertheless, some interesting patterns Parthorumque reges hac herba uti ad vota suscipienda. See also 28.104, on the pow-ers of a hyena’s blood: eodem tactis postibus ubicumque magorum infestari artes, non elici deos nec conloqui, sive lucernis sive pelvi, sive aqua sive pila, sive quo alio genere temptetur.37 HN 30.1–18.

For one thing, in none of these passages is there any explicit connection with Persian tradition. Secondly, the skills associated with this word-group are eff ectively limited to two areas: divination on the one hand and expertise with spirits of the dead on the other. Only Quintilian suggests another association, when he illustrates the issue of defi nition with the question of whether carmina magorum can be considered venefi cium.40 Regarding expertise with the spirits of the dead, Suetonius reports that Nero attempted, by means of a rite per-formed by magi, to summon up and placate the ghost of his mother; and one of the Declamationes Maiores deals with a case in which a father employed a magus to prevent the spirit of his dead son from leaving the tomb.41 Tacitus, by contrast, consistently uses the word magus to denote a free-lance expert in divination. Libo Drusus, for example, is accused of having resorted to the promises of Chaldaeans, the rites of magi, and the interpreters of dreams (Ann. 2.27.2), and as a result the senate issues a decree for the expulsion of magi and math-ematici from Italy (2.32.2); in a later passage, Lollia Paulina is charged with consulting Chaldaeans, magi, and the oracle of Clarian Apollo about Claudius’ marriage (12.22.1). In both cases, the juxtaposition of magi with other types of diviners makes Tacitus’ meaning clear.42in fact occur in his account of the false Smerdis (whom he calls Mergis: 1.9.7–10.1). Elsewhere, he describes Zoroaster as the inventor of the artes magicae (1.1.9) and records the story that a magus warned Alexander not to enter Babylon (12.13.3–5). Th e most intriguing passage comes in his account of Joseph, who became in Egypt an expert in the magicae artes, by which he means specifi cally the interpretation of omens and dreams (36.2.6).40 Inst. orat. 7.3.7; whether or not we should consider this as an issue that arose in actual court cases is called into question by a comment in his discussion of the utility of declamation: Nam magos et pestilentiam et responsa et saeviores tragicis novercas aliaque magis adhuc fabulosa frustra inter sponsiones et interdicta quaeremus (2.10.5).41 Nero 34.4: facto per magos sacro evocare manes et exorare temptavit. Decl. Mai. 10 tit.: Quae amissum fi lium nocte videbat in somnis, indicavit marito. Ille adhibito mago incantavit sepulcrum. Mater desiit videre fi lium; accusat maritum malae tractionis. Cf. 10.2 and especially 10.4: aft er the mother loses her son, iam magum misera quaerebat, ut umbra evocaretur.42 Th e same is true in the trial of Barea Soranus’ daughter Servilia, accused of spending money on magi and the performance of magica sacra (Ann. 16.30.2 and 31.1): Tacitus claims that she merely made inquiries as to the fate of her father. In the two remaining instances (6.29.4: Mamercus Scaurus accused of magorum sacra; 12.59.1: Tarquitius Priscus accused of magicae superstitiones), Tacitus does not provide enough information to make it clear what exactly these terms mean. It is worth noting, however, that in contexts where the issue is explicitly one of venefi cia and devotiones (the death of Germanicus and the trial of Piso at Ann. 2.69–73 and 3.10–16, the trial of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 67Looking at the evidence as a whole, we can make a few observations about the semantic range of magus and its cognates in prose. First, as I noted in the previous section, the adjective is relatively rare in prose, and when it does appear its derivation from the noun magus is clearly and immediate: it in eff ect functions as the equivalent of magorum. Sec-ondly, down to the second half of the fi rst century CE, the word-group refers exclusively to the Persian ritual specialists and their traditional areas of expertise, notably divination. Th irdly, in Pliny the Elder we see a strikingly diff erent tradition, which represented the Persian magi as authorities in the arcane properties of plants, animal substances, and stones; in his general discussion of magice, Pliny also reveals a tendency to link the word-group with a much wider range of tradi-tions, including well known scenes from literature. Lastly, although prose writers of the late fi rst and early second centuries no longer use the word-group with specifi c reference to Persia, they do for the most part associate it with techniques such as divination in which the Per-sian magi were traditionally thought to be expert.4. PoetryIn poetry, the fi rst appearance of this word-group is precisely in line with what we initially fi nd in prose. Catullus cattily suggests that a magus may be born from his enemy Gellius’ union with his own mother, “for a magus must be born from a mother and son, if the impious religion of the Persians is true” (90.1–4). Catullus, who also refers explicitly to Persicum haruspicium and to the magus’ venera-tion of the gods, is here clearly drawing on the Greek ethnographic tradition about the Persian magi that also informed the references in Cicero and other prose writers. Aft er Catullus, however, the usage of poets and prose authors diverges radically. Not only do poets show a strong preference for the adjective magicus over the noun magus, but they tend to use both words with a range of connotations that diff ers signifi cantly from what we fi nd in prose texts.Numantina at 4.22, the trial of Claudia Pulchra at 4.52, and the trial of Domitia Lepida at 12.64–5), magus and its cognates do not appear at all. See also Matthew Dickie’s discussion elsewhere in this volume (pp. 88–91, 96–9), who independently reaches the same conclusion about Tacitus’ use of this vocabulary."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68 james b. rivesTh e essential pattern was established by Vergil, the fi rst extant Latin writer to use the adjective magicus at all. Th e word appears twice in his works: in the eighth Eclogue (8.66) he describes the rites that a girl employs to bring back her estranged lover as magica sacra, and in the Aeneid (4.493) he refers to the rites that Dido will use to win back Aeneas as examples of the magicae artes. Although in both cases the primary reference of the word is to love charms, Vergil elaborates on its connotations through a plethora of allusions. In the eclogue, for example, the magica sacra involve not only ritual actions but also carmina, ‘spells’, and venena, ‘potions’. With carmina he associates the ‘Th essalian trick’ of drawing down the moon, the spells of Circe that transformed Ulysses’ men, and the charms that the Italic tribe of the Marsi reputedly used to kill snakes. Similarly, with venena he links the power to transform oneself into a wolf, to summon shades from the grave, and to move crops from one fi eld to another. It is also worth noting that magicus here has no overt or even implicit connection with Persia: the magi as Persian ritual specialists are one of the few motifs that he does not invoke. In short, in this passage of the Eclogues Vergil brings together a wide range of literary traditions and folk beliefs that have to do with the marvellous, and presents them as diff erent ele-ments within a single general category that he denotes with the adjec-tive magicus. Th is usage is fundamentally diff erent from what we fi nd in contemporary prose.Th e usage of Vergil’s contemporary Horace is in essence very simi-lar. Horace is one of the very few poets to use the noun magus, but he uses it with connotations that are much closer to those of Vergil’s magicus than to the normal meaning of magus in prose. In one of his Odes, for example, he presents a magus working with Th essalian ven-ena as someone who, along with a saga, might free a lovesick lad from his passion (Carm. 1.27.21–2). In his epistles, he praises the power of the poet to fi ll his audience with false terrors, ut magus (Epist. 2.1.210–13), and presents a list of superstitious fears that include ter-rores magici along with sagae, nocturni lemures, and portenta Th essala (Epist. 2.2.208–9). Again, instead of reference to the ethnographic tra-ditions about Persian magi, we fi nd associations with folk beliefs and literary commonplaces about witches. It is interesting, however, that Horace never makes use of this word-group in his treatments of the witch Canidia and her cronies, because it is precisely in stereotyped descriptions of witches that later poets most commonly employ the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 69adjective magicus.43 Tibullus provides the fi rst example of this in his extended sketch of a saga who has given him a charm to deceive his lover’s husband. He presents a bundle of motifs very similar to what we fi nd in Vergil, with some variations: his witch can draw the stars from the sky, turn the course of a stream with a carmen, cleave the ground and call forth the dead with a cantus, and chase the clouds from the sky; she possesses the evil herbs of Medea and has tamed the hounds of Hecate; she can loosen the poet’s passion by means of chants and herbs (1.2.41–62). Tibullus uses the adjective magicus three times in this description: of the aid that the saga gave him (42, magicum ministerium), the shriek with which she rouses the spirits of the dead (47, magicus stridor), and the gods to whom she slaughters victims (62, magici di).Th ere is no need to look in detail at the use of the word in later poetry, since this would only reveal variations on the general pattern that I have already sketched out. Latin poets consistently use the adjec-tive magicus to characterise rituals, herbs, and especially chants that bring about some alteration in the natural world, and they typically employ it in descriptions of witches, especially famous mythic fi gures like Circe and Medea. It very commonly modifi es nouns meaning ‘chant’ or ‘spell’, although the phrase artes magicae also oft en appears as shorthand for the entire bundle of stereotyped wonders that I have outlined.44 Even poets who were not working with the particular liter-ary stereotype of the witch tended to associate the adjective magicus with herbs and chants. Grattius, for example, describes old fashioned amulets used to protect hunting dogs as herbae aided by magici cantus (Cyneg. 405). Th e noun magus, in contrast, continues to be very rare in poetry. Apart from a doubtful example in Ciris, Ovid is the only poet between Horace and Lucan to use it, and he does so with precisely the same connotations as the adjective magicus; indeed, he employs the 43 Th ere are extended accounts of Canidia in Epod. 5 and 7 and Sat. 1.8, and brief references in Epod. 3.7–8 and Sat. 2.1.48 and 2.8.95.44 Modifying carmen, cantamen, cantus: Tib. 1.5.12; Prop. 2.28.35, 4.4.51; Ovid, Fast. 2.426 (cf.

Although his use of the adjective magicus does not diff er signifi cantly from that of other poets, he employs the noun magus more frequently: six times in the Bellum Civile. To a certain extent, he seems to follow Horace and Ovid in using the noun with the same connotations that had become traditional for the adjective magicus. Th us Sextus Pompeius knows “the secrets of savage magi, hateful to the gods above” (6.430–2), and the rocks of Th essaly hear magi chanting dire secrets (6.439–40). But in one passage he quite explicitly uses the word magus to mean a Per-sian functionary: when Pompey sends Deiotarus to ask aid of Arsaces aft er the battle of Pharsalus, he refers to a treaty that had been ratifi ed by the magi (8.218–20). By using the noun in both these senses, Lucan implies a link between the ‘magic’ of the poetic tradition and the activ-ities of the Persian magi. Th is association is even more explicit in other passages, where he sets up the Persian magi as in some sense the com-petitors of Th essalian witches: not only does Erichtho use words that are unknown to the magi and their gods (6.577), but the murmurs of Th essalian witches will force the gods from others’ altars, “even though Persian Babylon and secret Memphis unlock every sanctum of their ancient magi” (6.448–51). In this last passage it is also worth noting the apparent attribution of magi to Egypt as well as to Persia. Although we might analyse this simply as an example of zeugma, Lucan similarly associates magi with Egypt in an earlier passage, where he speaks of Egyptian hieroglyphics that preserve magicae linguae (3.222–4).Apart from Lucan, the use of this word-group in Latin poetry remains remarkably consistent from Vergil through Juvenal, both in the general preference for the adjective over the noun and in the range of connotations that the words normally carry. What is surprising in all this, and worthy of comment, is the extent to which this usage dif-fers from what we fi nd in prose texts.45 Met. 7.194–5, in Medea’s invocation of deities to aid her work: Tuque, triceps Hecate, quae coeptis conscia nostris/adiutrixque venis cantusque artisque magorum [obelized by R.J. Tarrant in OCT (2004)]. Th e other instance occurs in the following line: quaeque magos, Tellus, pollentibus instruis herbis. Cf. Ciris 374, where Scylla’s nurse performs rites for Jupiter Magus (or magnus, as the majority of manuscripts read)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 715. Th e Meaning of Magus and its CognatesHaving completed this survey of magus and its cognates in Latin prose and poetry, I now turn to some of the general issues that arise from it. First of all, what accounts for the very diff erent patterns of usage in prose and poetry? It is not possible to give a simple and defi nite answer to this question. It is clear enough that the initial use of the noun magus derives from Greek antecedents, especially ethnographic, historical, and philosophical texts. But we cannot with any confi dence say the same about the use of the adjective magicus in poetry. Th ere are certainly antecedents for the constellation of associations that we fi nd in Vergil and other Augustan poets, notably Apollonius’ descrip-tion of Medea and Th eocritus’ second Idyll. But neither Apollonius nor Th eocritus employ the adjective magikos or any other cognate of magos in these passages. Since our knowledge of Hellenistic Greek poetry is so limited, it may be that the use of these words in similar contexts was a well established practice that simply happens not to be represented in the surviving texts.46 It is equally possible, however, that it was an innovation of Latin poets, perhaps even of Vergil him-self. Th e fact that Horace does not make use of this word-group in his earlier poetry, even in places where we might expect it, but only in his poetry of the 20s and 10s, might indicate that he adopted it only aft er his friend had set the example; certainly the practice of the elegists and later poets can be explained on the basis of the Vergilian precedent. Given Vergil’s interest in arcane traditions, such as we fi nd for example in the fourth Eclogue, it is not impossible that he adopted the word from the sort of sub-literary Hellenistic pseudepigrapha on which the elder Pliny drew.Whatever the reason, however, the Latin adjective magicus quickly became dissociated from any particular reference to Persian ritual spe-cialists, and acquired instead a more fl exible and evocative semantic range. Th e noun magus, by contrast, remained largely restricted to its original technical meaning. It was perhaps for this reason that poets made much greater use of the adjective, and employed the noun only occasionally as a derivative, so to speak, of the adjective. By the second 46 A fragment of Sosiphanes’ Meleager suggests that this may have been the case: μάγοις ἐπῳδαῖς πᾶσα Θεσσαλὶς κόρη/ψευδὴς σελήνης αἰθέρος καταιβάτις (TGrF 1 p. 261 no. 92 frg. 1 = Σ Apoll. Rhod. 3.533b). According to the Suda (Σ 863) Sosiph-anes’ fl oruit was the third quarter of IVa (died either 336/3 or 324/1)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"72 james b. riveshalf of the fi rst century, however, the very clear pattern in the use of these words begins to break down. Lucan reintroduces into poetry the technical meaning of the noun magus and associates it with the well-established connotations of the adjective magicus; as a result, in Lucan we fi nd for the fi rst time Persian magi presented as exponents of the magicae artes. Not much later, the elder Pliny associates the noun with a body of lore that had not been linked to it before: exper-tise in the arcane powers of plants, animal substances, and stones. But this sort of expertise, we should note, had long been associated with the adjective magicus in poetry. Pliny’s own use of the adjective magi-cus consequently involves a certain ambiguity: on the one hand, it is clearly tied to the Persian magi, but on the other it also has something of the broader connotations that we fi nd in poetry. Th e full range of connotations that this word-group could have for Pliny becomes star-tlingly explicit in his general discussion of magice at the start of Book 30, which encompasses everything from the teachings of Zoroaster to human sacrifi ce in Gaul. Lastly, we fi nd that prose writers of the early second century no longer restrict the noun magus to the Persian ritual specialists; instead both Quintilian (and his anonymous follower) and Tacitus seem to use it to refer to free-lance specialists operating in Italy. Th is use of the noun may in fact go back to the early part of the fi rst century CE, if Tacitus’ reference to the expulsion of magi et mathematici under Tiberius reproduces the language of the original decree.47Yet even given these developments, Apuleius’ use of magus and its cognates in the Apology comes as something of a surprise: there we fi nd that the entire word-group has much the same semantic range that the adjective magicus had had in poetry since Vergil. It is interesting to note that in his other works we still fi nd the old distinction between the noun magus on the one hand and its cognates on the other.48 We 47 Ann. 2.32.3. Other sources vary in the terms they use to describe those aff ected by the decree: Suetonius (Tib. 36) names only mathematici, Dio says ἀστρολόγοι καὶ γόητες (57.15.8), and Ulpian, who apparently quotes the actual text of the decree, specifi es mathematici, Chaldaei, arioli, et ceteri, qui simile inceptum fecerunt (ap. Coll. Mos. et Rom. 15.2.1). See further L. Desanti, Sileat omnibus perpetuo divinandi curi-ositas: Indovini e sanzioni nel diritto romano (Milan 1990) 33–41.48 Apuleius uses the noun magus only in his epideictic and philosophical works: twice to refer to the Persian priests in their role as barbarian philosophers (Flor. 15.14, De dogm. Plat. 1.3), and once to mean ‘wonder-worker’ (De deo Soc. 6). In the Meta-morphoses, by contrast, he uses magicus nine times (1.3, 2.1, 2.6, 2.20, 2.21, 2.30, 3.18, 3.22, 3.29), magia three times (3.16, 3.19, 6.26), and the rare feminine noun maga"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" magus and its cognates in classical latin 73may accordingly wonder whether Apuleius’ insistent use of this word-group in the Apology refl ects a specifi c rhetorical strategy rather than general contemporary usage: by representing his opponents’ charge in terms more appropriate to the literary stereotype of the witch, he perhaps intended to make them appear as absurd and ignorant as he repeatedly claims them to be. Yet there is some evidence in the text that Apuleius’ accusers employed this word-group themselves. According to Apuleius, one of the people behind the charge brought against him was Rufi nus, the father-in-law of Pudentilla’s son Pontianus, who had hoped through this connection to gain access to her wealth. He there-fore tried to use Pontianus to dissuade Pudentilla from marrying Apu-leius; when this brought a sharp retort from Pudentilla, he attacked her as a slut and Apuleius as a magus et venefi cus (Apol. 78.2). It was in response to this outburst that Pudentilla wrote a letter to Pontianus in Greek, rebuking him for his behaviour: it was he, she said, who had fi rst suggested Apuleius to her as a potential husband and had encouraged their aff ection for each other; but now that Rufi nus has poisoned his mind, “all of a sudden Apuleius is a magos and I have been bewitched to love him!”49 Rufi nus then pounced on this phrase and constantly repeated it out of context as proof of his allegations.50 Th e very fact that Apuleius takes such pains to explain this letter and reveal its true signifi cance suggests the importance of Pudentilla’s remark in the case that his accusers brought against him.51 Th ere is thus strong reason to believe that the stress on the word magus and its cognates that we fi nd in the Apology is not something that Apuleius himself introduced but instead originated with Apuleius’ opponents, probably twice (2.5 and 6.16, the latter being Helms’ almost certain emendation for the manuscript reading magna); in all instances the words have the associations nor-mal in poetry. On the tension between two modes of magic in the Met., one liter-ary/popular, the other ‘parareligious’, see N. Fick, La magie dans les Métamorphoses d’Apulée, REL 63 (1985) 132–47.49 Apol. 83.1: Νῦν δὲ ὡς κατ<ήγ>οροι ἡμῶν κακοήθεις σε ἀναπείθουσιν, αἰφνίδιον ἐγένετο Ἀπολέϊος μάγος, καὶ ἐγὼ μεμάγευμαι ὑπ ̓ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐρῶ.50 Apol. 82.6: Turbabat impurus hic in medio foro bacchabundus, epistulam saepe aperiens proquiritabat: “Apuleius magus: dicit ipsa quae sentit et patitur; quid vultis amplius?”.51 On the prosecution’s use of the letter, see Apol. 27.8, 67.3 (altera res est de epistu-lis eius, quam confessionem magiae putant), and 78.5 (litteras, quibus, ut isti aiebant, confessa est sese mea magia in amorem inductam dementire), as well as Apuleius’ detailed rebuttal at 79–84."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74 james b. rivesand accordingly that Apuleius’ use of this word-group refl ects the gen-erally accepted usage of his day.52Although the patterns for the use of this word-group in our evi-dence are clear enough, their signifi cance is not. One possibility is that they are not in fact signifi cant at all but merely refl ect the accidents of survival: if we had a broader or even diff erent selection of evidence, we might see completely diff erent patterns. It is naturally impossible to rule this out, but in my view the overall patterns are strong enough that they cannot be entirely accidental. Nevertheless, since the evi-dence derives almost entirely from highly sophisticated literary texts, we may wonder about its relation to the usages of everyday life. Two very diff erent scenarios may be imagined. On the one hand, it is pos-sible that for most people the word magus and its cognates connoted the sort of thing that we fi nd in poetry from the start, but in prose only in later writers, Apuleius above all. In this case, it is poetic usage that refl ects the ordinary meaning of this word-group, whereas prose writ-ers deliberately confi ned themselves to the technical and somewhat learned meaning of the noun magus. Th is is in fact what Apuleius implies when he distinguishes the learned and the vulgar meanings of this word (Apol. 25.8–26.9). On the other hand, it is equally possible that poetic usage was deliberately exotic and remote from the language of everyday life, and that prose usage provides a more reliable guide to the way people used these terms in ordinary circumstances. If so, we might postulate a gradual shift in the meaning of the noun, a develop-ment to which the poetic use of the adjective magicus contributed. In this scenario, the word magus would at fi rst have had a fairly restricted meaning, denoting the Persian ritual specialists; it then began to be used more loosely of free-lance ritual specialists of various sorts, and lastly acquired the broad range of association that we fi nd sketched in Pliny and accepted without comment in Apuleius. Which scenario is more plausible is not at this point easy to determine.52 For the use of the term in legal contexts, see my two papers, Magic in Roman Law: Th e Reconstruction of a Crime, Classical Antiquity 22 (2003) 313–39 and Magic, Religion, and Law: Th e Case of the Lex Cornelia de sicariis et venefi ciis, in C. Ando and J. Rüpke (eds.), Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome (Stuttgart 2006) 47–67.

Possibilities for Further ResearchTh e fruits of this study are admittedly rather modest, and a broader fi eld of investigation would undoubtedly produce a more ample har-vest. Th ere are various options for extending its scope. Th e fi rst is to take into account other languages. As has been apparent at numerous points in this paper, it is hardly possible to study the Latin word magus in isolation from the Greek word μάγος, of which it is an adaptation. Some other members of the Latin word-group seem also to be loans from Greek, and not derived independently from the Latin magus: this is certainly true of the abstract nouns magice and magia, both of which are clearly marked as Greek by their declensions, and may to some extent also be true of the adjective magicus (cf. Greek μαγικός). It is a priori highly likely that Greek usage in the Hellenistic and imperial periods had considerable infl uence on the Latin usage. Moreover, the words eventually appear in other languages as well, such as Syriac and Coptic, and a comparison of their meaning in these languages with those in Latin and Greek may well yield some interesting results. A second way to broaden the scope of this study is to extend it into later antiquity, and to trace what changes occurred in the use of these words with the spread of Christianity. Lastly, it would be useful to study magus and its cognates in relation to other word-groups that had overlapping semantic ranges, notably the Greek words γόης/γοητεία and the Latin words venefi cus/venefi cium and malefi cus/malefi cium. Th e term Χαλδαῖος/Chaldaeus presents some particularly intriguing parallels: both words originally denote a person from a specifi c ethnic group who was expert in a particular kind of arcane lore, and both gradually come to lose their specifi c ethnic connotations and simply denote an expert in a particular kind of lore.Although it is not possible here to pursue these various avenues of inquiry, I can at least off er a few preliminary observations. First, as other scholars have pointed out, the existence of γόης and its cognates meant that Greek writers had available a more purely Hellenic alterna-tive to μάγος and its cognates.53 Th is may account for the absence of the word in many later literary texts, whose authors were concerned with the purity of their Greek. Likewise, the absence of such an alter-native in Latin may have meant that magus absorbed some of the 53 See especially Bremmer 1999, 9 = 2002a, 11 = 2008a, 247."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76 james b. rivessemantic range of the Greek word γόης.54 Secondly, although poets such as Apollonius and Th eocritus avoided μάγος and its cognates, the use of these words may have fl ourished in other contexts of which we can now gain only fi tful glimpses. A closer examination of the avail-able evidence would undoubtedly shed further light on developments in the Hellenistic period. We have already seen that the evidence of Pliny indicates the importance of this word-group in pseudepigraphic treatises of arcane lore. Similarly, Hellenistic Jewish texts hint at some interesting semantic developments at the popular level: the tendency to apply these terms to wonder-workers of varied ethnic backgrounds, particularly Egyptians and Judaeans, and to associate them more insis-tently with φάρμακα and similar terms.55 Lastly, the later evidence for magus and its cognates in Latin, although limited, does provide some confi rmation that Apuleius’ Apology refl ected contemporary usage. Legal writers use these words to denote improper or illegal activi-ties: Ulpian equates libri magici with mala medicamenta et venena (D. 10.2.4), and the redactor of Pauli Sententiae specifi es the appro-priate penalties for conscii magicae artis, ipsi magi, and possessors of libri magicae artis (5.23.17–18). But Christian Latin writers, especially Tertullian but also Arnobius and Lactantius, are the ones who pro-vide the most extensive evidence for the later use of this word-group; careful study might be able to distinguish connotations that are spe-cifi cally Christian (e.g., heresy) from those that may have been more widespread.5654 We may note, for example, that Apuleius twice translates γοητεία in Plato, Symp. 202e by magorum miracula: Apol. 43.2 and De deo Socr. 6.55 For example, the author of the Testament of Reuben describes how Potiphar’s wife summoned μάγοι and used φάρμακα in her attempts on Joseph’s chastity (4.9); Pseudo-Phocylides advises his readers to avoid φάρμακα and μαγικοὶ βίβλοι (149); the author of Th e Wisdom of Solomon notes the failure of the Egyptians’ μαγικὴ τέχνη (i.e. between 100 BCE and 100 CE, one of the earliest surviving examples of this phrase) during the plague of darkness (17.7); Philo describes the Egyptian priests who chal-lenged Moses as σοφισταὶ καὶ μάγοι (Mos. 1.91; cf. Jos. AJ 2.286) and sharply distin-guishes true μαγική from the false, which employs φίλτρα καὶ ἐπῳδαί to inspire hate and love (Spec. leg. 3.100–1), cf. n. 27 above; the author of Acts reports how Simon had won over Samaria with his μαγείαι (8.9) and describes Elymas, the Judaean wonder-worker who accompanied the Roman governor of Cyprus, as a μάγος (13.6–8); Jose-phus reports that the procurator Felix employed a Judaean μάγος named Atomos to win over the sister of Agrippa II (AJ 20.142). 56 Cf.

DickieTh ere are a number of questions that can be asked about the part magic plays in the writings of historians of Rome.1 One may ask what the feelings of a historian are about magic, whether he thinks it is eff ective and has a reality to it and then what he thinks of the people who practise it and of those who resort to them. A related and impor-tant question is how does the historian think the state should deal with magic-workers? Th e attitude of the historian to magic and magic-work-ers is one order of question. Th ere is another order of question: why does magic in some historians play no part, while in others it looms large? When magic does play a role in the writings of a historian, it is proper to examine the circumstances in which reference is made to it. One can then see whether a pattern emerges and whether the same pattern obtains in other historians who cover the same period. It goes without saying that the comparison will only be meaningful if the his-torians compared are independent of each other; that is to say, when one does not mechanically reproduce what the other has said or when both do not follow the same authority.So much for preliminaries. We may now turn our attention to which historians have something to say about magic and which do not. Th e list of those in whom magic goes unmentioned is at least as long as that of those who believe it merits attention. It is a remarkable fact that magic is never mentioned in what survives of Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita, bar a passing reference to it in the account of the suppres-sion of the Bacchanal cult.2 Nor is there any hint of it in the Periochae. 1 For the purposes of this paper ‘Roman historian’ means anyone who wrote a history of Rome, whether in Greek or in Latin. No account, therefore, will be taken of biographical writers such as Suetonius and Plutarch. Considerations of space have meant the exclusion of Ammianus Marcellinus.2 39.11.2: confestim mulier exclamat Hispalae concubitu carere eum decem noctes non posse; illius excetrae delenimentis et venenis imbutum nec parentis nec vitrici nec deorum verecundiam habere."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80 matthew w. dickieIt is less remarkable that magic receives no mention in Velleius Pater-culus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Appian; the texture of the stories they tell does not obviously admit reference to magic. Mild surprise may be registered that magic is not one of the vices with which Sallust credits Catiline in his Catilinae Coniuratio. Magic is aft er all one of the charges employed in ancient invective.Th e absence of any mention of magic in Livy is something of a puzzle. One explanation for the absence might be that Romans in the time of Livy, let alone in earlier centuries, had no concept of magic, since it was not until Pliny the Elder that the concept was formulated. Whatever the explanation is, this is surely not it. Th ere is an over-whelming body of evidence that the Romans operated with a concept of magic long before the middle of the fi rst century CE and that magic was practised as such. A rather more plausible explanation is that since the concern of Roman historiography was with war and high politics, there was no occasion to mention magic, since it just so happened that in the period Livy dealt with magic never intersected with high poli-tics, although it most certainly did so later. As an explanation this has a lot to recommend it, but it is a little too neat. Other circumstances may lead to the mention of magic. We know that L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi (cos. 133 BCE), presumably in his Annales, relates that a freed-man, Furius Chresimus, because his farm, though small, was so much more productive than the farms of his neighbours, was charged with having used spells (venefi cia) to entice the crops of his neighbours to desert them for him and that he was acquitted, aft er having pointed to his well-turned out slaves and the well-kept equipment that he had brought to the forum, which he declared were his spells, although he was not able to show the sweat that he had expended and the long hours of the night when he had stayed up to work.3 Th e chances are that Calpurnius Piso told the story to illustrate the virtues of hard work. Th ere was a strongly moralising strain to his writing: he dated the destruction of a sense of shame in Roman life to a prodigy that occurred in 154 BCE.4 Livy too might have told such a story. It may then be a matter of accident that no such story is to be found in what survives of Livy.3 Pliny, HN 18.41–43: venefi cia mea, Quirites, haec sunt, nec possum vobis ostendere aut in forum adducere lucubrationes meas vigiliasque et sudores.4 Pliny, HN 17.244: hac tempestatibus prostrata eodem loco fi cus enata est M.

In the glorifi catory version of Roman his-tory composed by L. Annius Florus in the third century CE or later, the slave revolt that began in Sicily in the early 130’s BCE is dealt with. Some attention is devoted both to the conditions that made it so dangerous and to its leader, a Syrian slave called Eunus. Despite the constraints of space, Florus gives a sketch of the trick that Eunus employed to persuade his fellow-slaves to follow him: he was a priest of the Syrian goddess and as such simulated possession; while giving what appeared to be inspired utterances, he breathed fi re, a feat that he achieved by hiding a nut in his mouth in which there was sulphur and fi re.5 Diodorus Siculus, in his account of the slave revolt in Sicily, gives a rather more detailed picture of Eunus’ trick that by and large tallies with Florus. He calls him a μάγος and τερατουργός, wonder-worker (34/35.2.5–7). Diodorus’ source will be the eighth book of the Histories of the Stoic philosopher, Posidonius.6 It is most unlikely that Florus draws on Posidonius directly; his account is suffi ciently diff er-ent from that of Diodorus to rule Diodorus out. Th e chances are that Livy, who did describe the revolt and its suppression (Per. 56.58), is his source for the episode. Florus does aft er all rely on Livy, though not exclusively, for a good deal of earlier Roman history. Livy for his part will have used Posidonius.Th e conclusion to be drawn is that Livy may well have had occa-sion to refer to magic-working when it impinged on public life. It was unquestionably a topic that his predecessors treated. No more general conclusions can be drawn about the contexts in which Livy introduces mention of magic-working into his narrative, nor is it possible to say anything at all about Livy’s feelings about magic. Th ere is, on the other hand, a clue to how Livy may have treated magic when he did write about it: it lies in the amount of space Florus devotes to Eunus and his wonder-working. Th e attention to detail on Florus’ part encourages 5 5.2.7: Syrus quidam, nomine Eunus,—magnitudo cladium facit ut meminerimus—fanatico furore simulato dum Syriae deae comas iactat, ad libertatem et arma servos quasi numinum imperio concitavit. itaque ut divinitus fi eri probaret, in ore abdita nuce quam sulpure et igni stipaverat, leniter inspirans fl ammam inter verba fundebat.6 Athen. 12.59, 542b = FGrH 87 F7, appealing to the eighth book of the Histories of Posidonius, cites a description of the luxury in which Damophilus of Enna lived.

Th e fi rst question to be addressed is what Tacitus and Dio Cassius make of magic: did they believe in it; what did they personally think of those who practised it and of those who resorted to magicians; and fi nally, what, as a matter of public policy, did they think should be done about magic-workers. Th e last question is particularly interest-ing, since both historians write from the standpoint of men who had been involved in public aff airs at a high level. Tacitus, writing under Nerva and Trajan, was suff ect consul in 97 and proconsul of Asia in 112/13; Dio Cassius had a yet more distinguished career: suff ect consul around 204 and consul ordinarius in 229 with the Emperor, Severus Alexander; from 218 until 228 he held a series of important provin-cial posts, culminating in a proconsulship of Africa and legateships of Dalmatia and then Pannonia Superior. About priesthoods held by Dio nothing is recorded, but Tacitus himself tells us, in describing the ludi saeculares that took place in 47 CE under Claudius, that in 88 both in his capacity as a priest of the college of quindecimviri sacris faciundis and as a praetor he had been present at and had paid close attention to the ludi saeculares celebrated by Domitian in that year. He explains that it is not out of boastfulness that he records his offi ces, but because the college had since the distant past been charged with overseeing the ludi and because the magistrates carried out the celebrations.7 It rather sounds as if he took his religious offi ce seriously.Th e suggestion that Tacitus took his duties as quindecimvir seriously may surprise those who are inclined to believe that Tacitus was, so far as religion went, something of a sceptic. It is probably still widely believed that most educated Romans went through the motions of religious ritual without according much credence to what they did. Roman religion is, on this understanding, an empty husk without a kernel. Its emptiness is invoked to explain why Rome was so receptive 7 Ann. 11.11.3–4: nam is quoque edidit ludos saecularis iisque intentius adfui sac-erdotio quindecimvirali praeditus ac tunc praetor; quod non iactantia refero sed quia collegio quindecimvirum antiquitus ea cura et magistratus potissimum exsequebantur offi cia caerimoniarum.

It is a point of view that nonetheless still colours what is said about Tacitus. Comments about prodigies, for instance, tend to be construed as the ironic asides of a sceptic and non-believer and are asserted to have been made for rhetorical eff ect. Th at another construction can be put upon what Tacitus has to say about prodigies and omens is not entertained. Th e perspective from which Tacitus speaks about religious matters is diffi cult for us to grasp, not because the historian conceals his position by his ironic style, but because his world-view is so very diff erent from that of our own. His contemporaries are unlikely to have seen him as a rootless and sub-versive ironist and a mocker of all religious belief.Tacitus presents himself as a man concerned to preserve traditional Roman religious practice, convinced that when religious matters are allowed to slide or are completely disregarded, the gods will vent their anger on the Roman people to correct the error.9 What on his view angers the gods is not so much failure to observe the niceties of ritual practice, as disdain for the moral order that the gods uphold. Th us his moral outrage at the enormity of the crime committed by the forces of Vitellius in setting fi re to the temple of Jupiter Maximus on the Capi-tol goes hand in hand with the observation that the gods would have been well-disposed, if the conduct of the Roman people had permitted them.10 Th e unstated corollary of the observation is that the Roman people had by their misdeeds brought the anger of the gods on their 8 For a recent expression of a view similar to the one sketched above, see R. Tur-can, Les cultes orientaux dans le monde romain2 (Paris 1992) 23–28. 9 So Davies 2005, 143–225, who presents a much more detailed case than can be given here. Th e point of view espoused by Davies is at odds with what is now appar-ently the orthodoxy amongst English-speaking Taciteans. In recent commentaries on Tacitus (Martin and Woodman 1989, 84; Damon 2003, 97f.), the dictum of Syme 1958, 521 that Tacitus’ invoking of the anger of the gods against the Roman people is “a striking and ominous phrase, but no confession of a creed”, is endorsed, as is the pronouncement of F. Goodyear, Th e Annals of Tacitus, 1 (Annals 1. 1–54) (Cambridge 1972) 276 on Tacitus’ use of the expression deum ira: “nothing more than devices of style, calculated to enhance his presentation of particular scenes and serving as con-venient ways of expressing pathos and indignation”.10 Hist. 3.72.1: id facinus post conditam urbem luctuosissimum foedissimumque rei publicae populi Romani accidit, nullo externo hoste, propitiis, si per mores nostros liceret, deis."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 matthew w. dickieown heads.11 Exactly the same point of view is to be found in the pref-ace to the fi rst book of the Histories, in which Tacitus records the total breakdown of the moral order in Rome aft er Nero’s death, even though some individual instances of virtue were to be found: the defeats that the Roman people incurred and the prodigies and signs that appeared showed that what was in the fore-front of the minds of the gods was not the well-being of the Roman people, but their punishment.12 Th e outrage that Tacitus registers at the destruction of the temple Jupiter Maximus has its counterpart in the appreciative notice that he gives Lucius Vestinus, the man who was given the task of rebuilding the Capitol; Vestinus’ careful attention to religious nicety clearly met with Tacitus’ approval and is recorded in considerable detail.13 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the proper observance of Roman religious rites mattered to the historian.Th e episode in the Annals that describes Nero’s swimming in the spring of Aqua Marcia neatly illustrates Tacitus’ religious sensibility. Th e incident occurred in 60 CE. It exemplifi es in Tacitus’ eyes the disgrace and personal danger that Nero’s excessive appetite for self-indulgence brought upon him in venturing into the Aqua Marcia for a swim. Th e incident gave rise to a feeling that Nero had polluted the sacred waters and the sanctity of the spot by washing his body in it. An illness that threatened his life followed; it made it clear, the historian says, that the gods had been angered.14 What is to be extracted from the account is that Tacitus unequivocally condemns Nero’s contempt for the sanctity of the spring and fi nds in the illness that came on the heels of the escapade proof that the gods were, as people thought, angered at Nero’s polluting the spring by washing his body in it.Tacitus conspicuously does not like foreign cults. Yet his disdain for foreign religious practice signifi cantly does not extend to the cults of the Greeks; they are treated with respect and are not dismissed as 11 Similarly K. Wellesley, Cornelius Tacitus, Th e Histories, Book iii (Sydney 1972) 172: “the disasters of this year were clearly divine retribution for sin, a view traditional in ancient thought”.12 1.3.2: nec enim umquam atrocioribus populi Romani cladibus magisve iustis indi-ciis adprobatum est non esse curae deis securitatem nostram, esse ultionem.13 Hist. 4.53.1: curam restituendi Capitolii in Lucium Vestinum confert, equestris ordinis virum, sed auctoritate famaque inter proceres.14 14.22.6: isdem diebus nimia luxus cupido infamiam et periculum Neroni tulit, quia fontem aquae Marciae ad urbem deductae nando incesserat; videbaturque potus sacros et caerimoniam loci corpore loto polluisse. secutaque anceps valetudo iram deum adfi rmavit."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 85externae superstitiones as are Egyptian rites and the religious practices of the Celts, Germans, Jews and Christians.15 I see no reason to sup-pose that this is a pose on Tacitus’ part and not what he and most of his kind believed.16So much then for Tacitus’ religious standpoint, we can now turn to what magic meant to him.17 Tacitus makes no statement of his views on the subject. He does, on the other hand, give expression to his feel-ings on a closely related topic, astrology. Th ere is, in addition, some indication in one of the terms in which he refers to magic what his attitude to the practice of it was.One way of dealing with Tacitus’ silence is to argue that as belief in magic was widespread in all sections of Roman society under the Empire, the historian will necessarily have subscribed to the belief. Th e truth of the matter is that we are in no position to assert that belief in magic was the norm at any period in Classical Antiquity, let alone in the fi rst three centuries of our era. What can be demonstrated is that there were persons in the Roman ruling class who did not give any credence to the claims that magicians made and were inclined to sup-pose that all magicians, not just some of them, were frauds.Pliny the Elder is one such. Th e most explicit statement of his views is to be found in the short disquisition on the origins and spread of magic at the beginning of Book 30 of the Natural History (HN 30.1–18). Th e disquisition culminates in what in Pliny’s eyes is conclusive proof of the fraudulence of magic: the inability of the magicians that Tiridates of Armenia brought with him to Rome to impart the art of magic to Nero, despite the fact that conditions could not have been more favourable and the pupil could not have been more receptive; the failure constituted a huge and unquestionable instance of the falsity of the art.1815 Th ere is something of an exception at Ann. 3.60.2, where the myths on which Greek cities based their claims to the right of asylum are called vetustae superstitio-nes. Externae superstitiones: Ann. 11.15.1, 13.32.4; Egyptians: Ann. 2.85.5, Hist. 1.11.1, 4.81.3; Druids: Ann. 14.30.3, Hist. 4.54.3; Jews: Ann. 2.85.5, Hist. 2.4, 5.8, 5.13; Chris-tians: Ann. 15.44.416 In contrast to the view of J. Henderson, Tacitus—A World in Pieces, Ramus 16 (1987) 167–210 at 168 n. 4, cited with approval by Davies 2005, 148: “we will not catch Tacitus with his rhetorical trousers down”.17 Th e reason given by Tavenner 1916, 50–51 for supposing Tacitus believed in magic, which is that he at no time time disavows belief, is not compelling.18 30.14–17; 30.15: inmensum, indubitatum exemplum est falsae artis, quam dereli-quit Nero.

Th ey did so, presumably because they thought magic a fraud. Lucian’s Alexander is in part such an exposé. It is dedicated to an Epicurean called Celsus, who had him-self written a treatise laying bare the tricks of magicians (Alex. 21). It may reasonably be inferred that Lucian did not place any credence in magic. Flavius Philostratus, the author of the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, knows of tracts exposing the tricks magicians played and approves of them.19 He himself attributes the continued existence of magic to its users persuading themselves when confronted by failure that they themselves had made a mistake in performing a ritual.20 Phi-lostratus’ scepticism is not what might have been expected in a man who is essentially a Platonist, since Platonists tend to believe in magic; Origen’s opponent Celsus and Apuleius of Madaura, both Platonists, take the view that magicians achieve the extraordinary feats they do by employing demons.21It would, accordingly, be imprudent in the extreme to argue on a priori grounds that Tacitus believed in magic or again that he did not. A clue to his feelings about magic is to be found in the ways in which he characterises it on one occasion.22 He says that a man who had been the legate to the proconsul of Africa charged his former superior with (Cambridge MA 2004) 265 n.7 goes seriously astray in criticising M. Beagon, Roman Nature: Th e Th ought of Pliny the Elder (Oxford 1992) 97, 106–08 for implying ‘that Pliny rejected magic because its claims to be able to manipulate nature were false’. In Martin’s view, Pliny rejects magic ‘for social rather than physiological or methodologi-cal reasons’. Th e paragraphs from Pliny (HN 28.94–95) cited by him in support of his thesis that for Pliny magicians are ‘the evil enemies of humankind’ will sustain no such interpretation.19 VA 7.39. Philostratus is the exact contemporary of Dio Cassius, who may have known his writings. So Millar 1964, 19–20.20 VA 7.39. Much the same position is taken in a speech that Philostratus puts into the mouth of Apollonius of Tyana. Th ere, the pretensions of magic to be an art are said to lie in the folly of those deceived by it (πάντα ταῦτα προστίθημι τῇ τῶν ἐξαπατωμένων δόξῃ, τὸ γάρ σοφὸν τῆς τέχνης ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν ἐξαπατωμένων τε καὶ θεωμένων ἀνοίᾳ κεῖται: VA 8.10).21 Th e crucial text for the Platonist understanding of magic is Plato Symp. 201e1–203a2.22 Th e characterisation of Scribonius Libo Drusus at Ann. 2.27.2 as improvidus et facilis inanibus, “imprudent and prone to empty fantasies”, does not refer to his being prepared to give credence to magicians, interpreters of dreams and astrologers, but to the empty fantasies he entertained. Davies 2005, 168 renders facilis inanibus as “prone to dabbling in the ridiculous”, and seems to think that the expression refers to Libo’s faith in astrologers, magicians and interpreters of dreams."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 87res repetundae and with magicae superstitiones.23 It is unlikely that the words magicae superstitiones were to be found in the actual charge.24 Th e form of expression will be Tacitus’ own; he refers to charges of magic-working under a variety of descriptions. Th e term superstitio may encourage the unwary to suppose that Tacitus did not believe in magic and dismissed it as a mere superstition. Th at would be an unwarranted inference. Superstitio is a false friend to the translator; it does not in Tacitus’ Latin have the same meaning that its descendants in the Romance languages and English possess; it does not necessar-ily mean a religious practice based on mistaken beliefs.25 All that can be inferred from Tacitus’ use of the term superstitio is that it was a religious rite of which he disapproved, in part at least because it was at odds with the forms of piety that he supposed appropriate to the worship of the gods.26Th ere is one possible hint of what Tacitus’ beliefs about magic may have been in his account of an incident in 24 CE in which the prae-tor urbanus, Plautius Silvanus, caused his wife to fall headlong to her death. Why Silvanus had acted as he did the historian says was unclear; he gave the impression, when interrogated by Tiberius, of being disturbed in mind and of answering as if drugged by sleep and so of not being fully cognisant.27 His former wife was accused of hav-ing employed incantations and spells to drive her husband out of his 23 Ann. 12.59.2: pauca repetundarum crimina, ceterum magicas superstitiones obiec-tabat.24 But cf. Grodzynski 1974, 53: “Pratiquer les superstitions magiques tout comme les superstitions étrangères est donc un chef d’accusation valable”.25 Cf. Beard, North and Price 1998, 216: “Th e traditional Roman distinction seems to have made no such assumption about truth and falsehood; when Romans in the early empire debated the nature of religio and superstitio they were discussing instead diff erent forms of human relations with the gods”.26 Of Tacitus’ use of superstitio at Hist. 2.78.2 (referring to prophecies and astrol-ogy), at Hist. 3.58.3 (superstitione nominis) and at Ann. 12.59.2 (magicae superstitio-nes) Grodzynski 1974, 53 says: “Néanmoins, dans quelques cas rares, superstitio a le sens de magie ou de divination, sens déjà établi pour la période antérieure”. It is very far from certain that the word in two of the instances has either sense, nor is it an established fact that in earlier Latin superstitio and its cognates can mean ‘magic’ or ‘divination.’ Th e use of the term needs to be revisited. 27 Ann. 4.22.1: per idem tempus Plautius Silvanus praetor incertis causis Aproniam coniugem in praeceps iecit, tractatusque ad Caesarem ab L.

He certainly does not dismiss the pos-sibility as beyond belief.Whatever Tacitus’ views may have been about the eff ectiveness of magic, it may be inferred that he thought it a deviant form of religious behaviour. Warrant for the inference is to be found in his use of the expression magicae superstitiones (Ann. 12.59.2). It is virtually certain that he would have included the use of spells directed at others under the heading of magicae superstitiones. In support, it is possible to point to the defence Tacitus puts into the mouth of Servilia, a young woman accused of paying magi to perform what Tacitus calls magica sacra: she had invoked no impious gods, had performed no curses and had done nothing other than ask through her ill-favoured prayers that Nero and the senate preserve her father unharmed.29 We have just been told that she had paid the magicians to learn what the outcome of the trial in which her father was the accused would be (16.30.2). Her defence would have had little point, if putting curses on others were not also equally an aspect of magica sacra.Whether Tacitus believed magical ceremonies performed to discover what the future had in store were a threat to public order and how he thought the Roman authorities should deal with those who engaged in them is a question that cannot be answered directly. We do know what Tacitus views were on a closely related form of divination, astrology. Whether magic and astrology were generally imagined to be discrete intellectual categories is less than clear.30 Pliny the Elder in his disqui-sition on the history of magic treats astrology as a constituent element in the mix that gave magic a peculiar hold on the human mind.31 Taci-tus, for his part, at one point lumps together, as though they were of a 28 Ann. 4.22.3: mox Numantina, prior uxor eius, accusata iniecisse carminibus et venefi ciis vaecordiam marito, insons iudicatur.29 Ann. 16.31.1: nullos impios deos, nullas devotiones, nec aliud infelicibus precibus invocavi quam ut hunc optimum patrem tu, Caesar, vos, patres, servaretis incolumem.30 Luc. 6.425–34 distinguishes between legitimate forms of inquiry into the future (aut siquid tacitum sed fas erat 430), amongst them astrology (et Assyria scrutetur sidera cura 429) and the saevorum arcana magorum (431) that Sextus Pompeius favoured.31 HN 30.2: atque, ut hoc successerit, miscuisse artes mathematicas, nullo non avido futura de se sciendi atque ea e caelo verissime peti credente."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 89piece, astrology, magical divination, and divination based on dreams. What from his point of view they undoubtedly had in common was that they could be used to raise the hopes of ambitious young men whose grasp of reality was shaky.32Syme maintains that Tacitus leaves it unclear whether he believed in astrology or not.33 Th at is very far from being the case. Tacitus in fact says that Tiberius had in 33 CE told Servius Galba, who was then consul, that he would have a taste of power, meaning that his reign would be late and brief. Th e prediction, Tacitus says, was based on his knowledge of the Chaldaean art, an art that he had used his leisure on Rhodes to acquire under the tutelage of the Alexandrian astrologer, Th rasyllus. He goes on to recount how Tiberius had put Th rasyllus to a test from which the astrologer had emerged triumphant to be taken into Tiberius’ inner circle (Ann. 6.21). He then proceeds to set out various theories about the factors that govern men’s destiny. He concludes his digression by remarking that, despite everything, most men still believe that their destinies are determined at birth, although matters may turn out in a way contrary to the predictions made by charlatans who do not know what they are talking about; confi dence in astrology is corrupted in this way, even though both the past and the present bear clear witness to its truth. At this point, the historian stops reporting what the mass of men believe about astrology; he now, as an instance of a successful forecast of the future, draws our atten-tion to a prediction about Nero’s coming to the throne made by a son of Th rasyllus that he will in due course recount.34 It would be per-verse to deny that Tacitus has stacked the cards in favour of astrology, though it is true that he does not endorse it outright.Tacitus may be inclined to believe in genethliac astrology, but he has some of the same religious reservations about it that he has about magical divination: he says of Vespasian that he was not untouched by 32 Ann. 2.27.2: Firmius Catus senator, ex intima Libonis amicitia, iuvenem inprovi-dum et facilem inanibus ad Chaldaeorum promissa, magorum sacra, somniorum inter-pretes impulit.33 Syme 1958, 523–26. Th e assessment of Tacitus’ position by Tavenner 1916, 50 is succinct and accurate: “Th e attitude of Tacitus towards magic and astrology can scarcely be doubted. He believed in astrology but despised astrologers.”34 Ann. 6.22.5–6: ceterum plurimis mortalium non eximitur quin primo cuiusque ortu ventura destinentur, sed quaedam secus quam dicta sint cadere fallaciis ignara dicentium: ita corrumpi fi dem artis cuius clara documenta et antiqua aetas et nos-tra tulerit. quippe a fi lio eiusdem Th rasulli praedictum Neronis imperium in tempore memorabitur, ne nunc incepto longius abierim."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"90 matthew w. dickiethe superstitio, meaning astrology, and in fact openly supported, when he came to the throne, an astrologer called Seleucus.35 What exactly caused Tacitus unease about astrology must remain uncertain. Per-haps he thought the gods resented men prying into aff airs that were none of their business. He takes a rather dim view of the character of most astrologers and of their infl uence on public aff airs, but does not think there is much to be done about them. It is the astrologers who urged Otho to seize power in 69 CE that move the historian to refl ec-tion: those in power cannot depend on the loyalty of their astrologers; as for those who have aspirations, astrologers are likely to lead them astray; they are a class of men who always will be banned from Rome and always will be found there; Poppaea, Nero’s wife, had many astrol-ogers at the heart of her household, a very poor practice in the wife of an emperor.36 Tacitus is, in short, resigned to astrologers’ continuing to play a part in Roman life, even though they are a baneful infl uence, since they encourage the aspirations of pretenders to the throne and cannot be trusted by those in power. Although Tacitus doubts whether banning astrologers would in the long term be successful, we have no reason to suppose that he thought they should be tolerated; the dif-fi culty was taking eff ective measures against them.37 I suspect that he took a similar view of magicians, perhaps believing them to be an even lower form of humanity.Two episodes in the Annals tell us something about how Tacitus viewed those who turned to magicians to fi nd out what the future held in store for them. Th e view that he takes of the actions of the two per-35 Hist. 2.78.1: nec erat intactus tali superstitione, ut qui mox rerum dominus Seleu-cum quendam mathematicum rectorem et praescium palam habuerit.36 Hist. 1.22: genus hominum potentibus infi dum, sperantibus fallax, quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur. multos secreta Poppaeae mathematicos, pes-simum principalis matrimonii instrumentum, habuerant.37 Of the senatus consultum of CE 52 expelling astrologers from Italy in the aft er-math of the exile of Furius (Camillus) Scribonianus for consulting Chaldaeans con-cerning the death of the Emperor, Tacitus says it was atrox et inritum, by which he will have meant that it was couched in minatory language, but that it did not have the eff ect intended (Ann. 12.52.3). Potter 1994, 175 suggests that laws banishing astrolo-gers and seers “do not seem to have been intended to have permanent force”. Th at goes rather against the grain of Tacitus’ resigned observation on the continued pres-ence of astrologers in Rome, despite their being banned, at Hist. 1.22.2: quod in civi-tate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur. Damon 2003, 150 describes it as “a neat, if somewhat overstated, sententia”.

He would not necessarily have taken so indulgent a view of persons whose conditions and circumstances were diff erent. Th e protagonist in the earlier of the two episodes (16 CE) was M. Scribonius Libo Drusus, a young man, the scion of a noble family (he was the great-grandson of Pompeius Magnus) with a colourable claim to the throne. According to Tacitus, the ease with which an agent provocateur induced him to approach astrologers, magicians and interpreters of dreams to enquire about his prospects could be accounted for by his youth, his lack of prudence, and an excessive willingness to entertain wild hopes (2.27.2). Of the questions that the young man put to those whom he consulted, one of which was whether he would be rich enough to cover the road from Rome to Brundisium in specie, the historian says they could be treated as stupid and silly, or, if one was prepared to put a kinder construction on them, as pitiable.38Th e second episode, to which I have already referred, involved Servilia, the daughter of Q. Marcius Barea Soranus (PIR2 B 55), who was on trial for fostering sedition. She had used part of her dowry to consult magicians. All she asked them, Tacitus says, prompted by a feeling of family duty, love of her father and a youthful failure of prudence, was whether the family would remain unharmed, whether Nero’s wrath could be assuaged and whether the outcome of the trial before the senate would be a terrible one.39 Again Tacitus is prepared to take an indulgent view of consulting magicians, if the questioner was young and foolish, motivated by a sense of loyalty to her father and asked only harmless questions. It rather looks as if he might not have been so uncritical if the questioner had been an older person whose questions had a more sinister intent.Dio Cassius’ standpoint on religion is not very diff erent from that of Tacitus.40 His views on the topic are to be inferred from the words that he puts into the mouth of Maecenas in the debate he says took place in 29 BCE in Octavian’s presence over the form of government most 38 2.30.2: inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida vana, si mollius acciperes, miseranda.39 16.30.2: acciderat sane pietate Serviliae (id enim nomen puellae), quae caritate erga parentem, simul imprudentia aetatis, non tamen aliud consultaverat quam de incolumitate domus, et an placabilis Nero, an cognitio senatus nihil atrox adferet.

Maecenas argues that the monarch should in every way and on all occasions give due rever-ence to the divine and should follow ancestral practice in doing so; he should compel others to do the same and should hate and punish those who engage in foreign religious practices (τοὺς δὲ δὴ ξενίζοντάς τι περὶ αὐτό), not only for the sake of the gods themselves, since a man who does not honour them will honour nothing, but because those who introduce new deities encourage the widespread adoption of alien practices (ἀλλ ̓ ὅτι καὶ καινά τινα δαιμόνια οἱ τοιοῦτοι ἀντεσφέροντες πολλοὺς ἀναπείθουσιν ἀλλοτριονομεῖν); that in its turn leads to con-spiratorial associations utterly inimical to monarchy.42 It is impossible to say when Dio composed the debate, though it does seem likely that it was written up before the death of Elagabalus in 222 CE. It is the case that in Dio’s eyes one of the principal sins of that monarch was his introduction of the cult of Elagabalus at Rome and his giving pre-cedence to the worship of the Syrian god over Jupiter (79.11.1).Dio’s thoughts on the way in which the state should handle magi-cians are again to be sought in Maecenas’ speech. Th ey follow directly on the proposals Maecenas makes about religious policy. Godless per-sons and sorcerers are not to be tolerated (μήτ ̓ οὖν ἀθέῳ τινὶ μήτε γόητι ξυγχωρήσῃς εἶναι); divination is needed; since that is so, har-uspices and augures should be appointed; those who need to will deal with them; but magicians are not to be permitted (τοὺς δὲ δὴ μαγευτὰς πάνυ οὐκ εἶναι προσήκει); they frequently provoke rebellions, some-times by saying what is true, but for the most part by telling falsehoods (36.2–3).43Th e transition from the regulation of foreign cults to the complete suppression of magic-workers is probably an indication that, in the thinking of persons of Dio’s class, the two are bound up.44 Th e term 41 So Millar 1964, 107–08.

Millar 1964, 108 is inclined to believe that Christianity was one of the new cults Dio thought should not be countenanced.43 ἄθεοι and γόητες are not separate categories of person, but γόητες are a species of the genus ἄθεοι.44 It is worth noting that Dio is prepared to believe that the Emperor Elagabalus engaged in the sacrifi ce of boys and in magical practices in his worship of the god Elagabalus (80.11)."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 93ἄθεος shows that the topic is still religion. Magicians, accordingly, are in the eyes of Dio godless persons; that is to say, they do not accord the gods the respect that is their due. Th e context very strongly suggests that Dio’s concern with magic is with the threat to public order that the divinatory practices of magicians present; they encourage rebel-lion. Other aspects of the magicians’ craft do not engage his attention. It may well be the case that magicians were only a concern to the authorities in Rome and the provinces to the extent that their predic-tions presented a threat to public order. Th ere can be no question that what moved the Senate to expel astrologers and magicians in 16 or 17 CE was that a person with a plausible claim to the throne had consulted them about his prospects. We can only guess at Agrippa’s reasons for expelling astrologers and magicians in 33 BCE, but since both categories were driven out, we may surmise that predictions were being made that off ered hope to the supporters of Mark Antony.It can be categorically asserted that Dio Cassius believed that magic can alter the course of nature. He happily and unquestioningly regales his readers with stories in which magic causes rain, makes men fall for a woman, sends dreams, cures sickness and induces madness.45 It does not follow that Dio does not think that magicians did not engage in sharp practice and in fraud. Th e shock that he expresses at Caracalla’s having admired and encouraged magicians suggests that he very much disapproved of magicians: Caracalla, under whom Dio served, gave a position of power to a Spaniard, Sempronius Rufus, whom Dio calls φαρμακεὺς καὶ γόης, and so rejoiced in the company of magicians that he set up a shrine to Apollonius of Tyana, ὅστις καὶ γόης καὶ μάγος ἀκριβὴς ἐγένετο.46Th ere is evidence that Dio’s views on the particular threat that magi-cians presented to the public order and on how that threat should be dealt with are those of a senior offi cial in the Roman administration of his day. In his book on the duties of a proconsul (De offi cio procon-sulis), the jurist Ulpian, a contemporary of Dio, takes it for granted 45 Rain: 60.9.4, 72.8.4; dreams: 57.15.7; love-magic: 61.11.3; cures illness: 69.22.1; induces madness: 78.15.2. 46 77 (78).17.2; 18.4. Two other emperors, Hadrian and Septimius Severus, do not escape criticism for their excessive interest in what was properly, it is implied, hidden from human view. Hadrian is explicitly said to have used magic to that end (69.11.2–3), while in the case of Septimius Severus we are left with the impression that he searched for magical books in Egyptian temples (75 [76].13.2). Th e tradition concerning Hadrian re-appears, rather unexpectedly, in the proem to PGrMag IV 2441–2662 at 2448f."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94 matthew w. dickiethat astrologers and prophets should be banned or executed.47 Ulpian points out that the suppression of astrologers and seers was a policy of longstanding: a senatus consultum of 17 CE banishes astrologers, Chaldaeans, seers and other such persons and confi scates their goods and further proposes that they be executed, if they are foreigners (Coll. Mos. et Rom. leg. 15.2.1).48 Two rescripts from emperors to governors are cited that deal with diviners. At the end of his discussion Ulpian quotes from one of them, evidently to endorse it. It is a rescript of Caracalla addressed to the legate of Gallia Lugdunensis: “Men who under cover of having received warnings from the gods either make pronouncements or disseminate warnings or knowingly invent them ought not to go unpunished”.49Ulpian gives explicit expression to his own views at the end of the paragraph in which he gives a summary of the history of imperial policy aff ecting astrologers. He adds that the policy aff ects prophets in general (vaticinatores); they too need to be punished, since they some-times employ their disreputable craft to the detriment of the public peace and the imperial order.50 Th ere is little room for doubt that those 47 On Ulpian’s career, see Honoré 2002, 1–36 and on the date of composition of the De offi cio, 181–85; see also Millar 2002. Fögen 1993, 178–82, who holds that the Roman state was not concerned about the beliefs of those it ruled until the time of Diocletian, argues that Ulpian cannot have taken the view that seers should be exe-cuted or expelled; a later interpolator has been at work. On Ulpian, see Honoré 2002 and Millar 2002, 83f. Th e De offi cio proconsulis belongs to a recognised class of hand-book. It may for all that have been treated as more authoritative than other works of the genre. An inscription, perhaps of the Tetrarchy, recording what must have been a letter of the proconsul to Ephesus, recommends that amongst sources of law that the city may use to support its claims is the De offi ciis of Ulpian (AE 1966: 436 = IEph 2 no. 217 ll. 7–9). Although Ulpian wrote other works under the heading De offi cio, concerning the duties of respectively the consul, the curatores rei publicae, the praefectus urbi, and the quaestor, the De offi cio proconsulis will have contained what was relevant to Ephesus. For an appreciation of the importance of the treatise, see Honoré 2002, 227f.48 praeterea interdictum est mathematicorum callida inpostura et obstinata persua-sione. nec hodie primum interdici eis placuit, sed vetus haec prohibitio est. denique exstat senatus consultum Pomponio et Rufo conss. factum, quo cavetur, ut mathema-ticis, Chaldaeis, ariolis et ceteris, qui simile incertum fecerint, aqua et igni interdicatur omniaque bona eorum publicentur et si externarum gentium quis id fecerit, ut in eum animadvertatur.49 Coll.

An edict issued by the Prefect of Egypt in 198/199 CE is proof (PYale inv. 299).51 He took action against two divinatory proce-dures and any other forms of magic (μαγγανεῖαι) of the same order.52 Th e Prefect declares that he has been moved to action by the deceits of divination. His justifi cation for so acting is that such enquiries pre-sume to look into matters that lie beyond human ken, περιεργία.53 Two forms of divination are specifi ed, written responses given as though under divine inspiration and the parading of statues.54To sum up, Tacitus and Dio Cassius both disapprove of magic-working or to be more precise, magical divination, because it is at odds with proper religious practice. Dio’s disapproval comes in part from the feeling that magicians presume to know more than is vouchsafed to mortals. He unquestionably believed in the effi cacy of magic; Taci-tus may also have done so. As regards public policy, only one aspect of magic engages Dio’s interest: its claim to be able to divine the future. It is a reasonable supposition that Dio’s view of magic is that of a senior offi cial of the Roman government concerned to suppress forces disruptive of the peace. A case can be made for supposing that Tacitus took the same view of magic and for the same reasons.So much for Tacitus’ and Dio Cassius’ views on magic. We now turn to another order of question, the contexts in which Tacitus and 51 See the improved text by J. Rea, A New Version of PYale inv. 299, ZPE 27 (1977) 51–57; the relevant passage is cited in n. 54 below. Potter 1994, 176 rather implies that what gave rise to the edict was an imperial visit to Egypt, that of Septimius Severus. Th e edict itself gives no hint that such concerns prompted the Prefect, Q. Aemilius Saturninus, to issue it. So also Lane Fox 1986, 213.52 Translating μαγγανεῖαι by ‘chicanery’ (Lane Fox 1986, 213) or ‘charlatanry’ (Pot-ter 1994, 176) is at best misleading, since the Greekless reader does not realise that the Prefect treats the forms of divination banned as magical procedures.53 Th e rendering by D. Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance (Princeton 1998) 233 of ἐπισφαλοὺς περιεργίας as ‘hazardous conjuring’ is some distance off the mark.54 Lines 4–9: . . . διαγ[ορ]%εῦσαι ε%ἴ%ρ[γεσ]%θ[α]&ι τῆς ἐπισφαλοῦς ταῦτης περιεργίας. μήτ ̓ οὖν διὰ χρη[σμῶ]ν ἤτοι ἐνγράφων διὰ γραφῶν ὡς ἐπὶ τοῦ θείου διδομένων μήτε διὰ κωμασίας ἀκαλμάτω[ν] (sic) ἢ τοιαύτης παγγανίας (sic) τ%ὰ ὑπὲρ ἄνθρωπόν τις εἰδένα[ι] προσποιείσθω καὶ τὴν τῶν μελλόντων ἀτελείαν (= ἀδηλίαν) ἐπαγγ%ε[λ] λέσθω . . . .

Th ere is not complete uniformity here, but pat-terns do emerge. It is conspicuously the case that it is only in Tacitus’ Annals and in the corresponding portions of Dio Cassius’ Histories in which reference is made to trials in which the accused are charged with magic-working. Th at there are no such trials in what survives of Tacitus’ earlier work, the Histories, is something of a puzzle. Why they receive no mention in Herodian and the Historia Augusta is more eas-ily explained: the focus of both writers is on the lives and characters of the emperors they portray, not on the events that occurred each year in the reigns covered. It certainly will not do to say that important persons aft er the Julio-Claudians were no longer brought before the courts and charged with magic. Th e testimony of Ammianus Marcel-linus shows that this is an untenable hypothesis.In all but one of the trials recorded by Tacitus under Tiberius, Claudius and Nero in which magic was part of the charge the accused seem to have been tried for a contravention of the lex maiestatis; that is, with having done something prejudicial to the well-being of the emperor or his immediate family. Sometimes the off ence consisted in using magical divination to discover what lay in store for the emperor, and sometimes the accused were charged with having cast malign spells against the emperor or some member of his household. Paulina Lollia will have been charged in 49 CE under Claudius with maies-tas, because she had consulted Chaldaeans, magicians and the oracle of Clarian Apollo about the marriage of the emperor.55 Two women were brought to trial for having practised magic against the emperor himself and his wife: Claudia Pulchra was accused under Tiberius in 25 CE of adultery and of having directed spells and curses (venefi cia in principem et devotiones) at the emperor; in 53 CE, Domitia Lepida was charged with curses (devotiones) directed against the wife of Claudius and with having allowed her gangs of slaves to terrorise Calabria (Ann. 4.52.1; Ann. 12.65.1). Amongst the charges brought against Gn. Piso, in the aft ermath of the death of Germanicus, was that he had killed Germanicus by means of poison and curses (devotionibus et veneno: Ann. 3.13.2). Th ere are three instances of persons charged with having had recourse to magic where Tacitus does not make it clear to what 55 Ann. 12.22: et accusatorem qui obiceret Chaldaeos, magos interrogatumque Apol-linis Clarii simulacrum super nuptiis imperatoris."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 97end the magic was performed.56 In one of these instances the accused was charged with having resorted to magorum sacra. Th e chances are that the expression is Tacitus’ paraphrase of the actual charge. It is certainly true that the expression Tacitus uses to refer to Libo Drusus’ consultation of magicians about his future is magorum sacra, but it does not follow that it was a turn of phrase only used to refer to such inquiries. Magica sacra, an expression that would appear to be a varia-tion on it, seems to encompass not only magical divination, but also putting a magical curse on someone.57 It is quite unclear what Sta-tilius Taurus is supposed to have done to be charged with what Tacitus calls magicae superstitiones. Th e diri ritus with which Iunia Lepida was charged in 65 CE sound rather more menacing than consulting magi-cians about the future; it is to be imagined that she was accused of having directed devotiones against someone in the imperial family.58Tacitus reports trials in which the accused was charged with maies-tas, since he felt they represented an unhealthy tendency that under-mined the well-being of the Roman state. He explicitly says of the trial of Libo Drusus in 15 CE in which the accused was charged with having consulted magicians, astrologers and interpreters of dreams that he will give a careful account of its course, since it was the beginning of a practice that ate away at the structure of the state.59Th e one trial mentioned by Tacitus in which charges of magic not aff ecting the imperial house were brought is that of Numantina, which I have already mentioned (p. 87f.). She will have been tried under the lex Cornelia de sicariis et venefi ciis.60 Tacitus would probably not have mentioned the episode, had Tiberius not intervened directly in it.56 Mamercus Scaurus: verum ab Servilio et Cornelio accusatoribus adulterium Liviae, magorum sacra obiectabantur (Ann. 6.29.6); Statilius Taurus: pauca repetundarum crimina, ceterum magicas superstitiones obiectabat (Ann. 12.59.2); Iunia Lepida: inces-tum cum fratris fi lio et diros sacrorum ritus confi ngerent (Ann. 16.8.3).57 Th e phrase is used in connection with Servilia (see p. 88 above): interrogante accusatore, an cultus dotalis, an detractandum cervici monile venum dedisset, quo pecu-niam faciendis magicis sacris contraheret . . . (Ann. 16.31.1). She however, according to Tacitus, explicitly denied this imputation: nullos impios deos, nullas devotiones, nec aliud infelicibus precibus invocavi. . . .58 On Nero’s anxieties about the threat to his rule posed by the family of the Silanii, of whom Iunia Lepida was one, and their connections, see Griffi n 1984, 195.59 Ann. 2.27.1: eius negotii initium, ordinem, fi nem curatius disseram, quia tum pri-mum reperta sunt quae per tot annos rem publicam exedere.60 So Garnsey 1970, 26 n. 5, followed by Martin and Woodman 1989, 155."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98 matthew w. dickieIf we leave trials in which the accused was charged with magic out of account, there are only two other occasions in which Tacitus has anything to say about magic. In his account of the aft ermath of the Libo Drusus aff air in 15, Tacitus reports that the senate passed reso-lutions expelling astronomers and magicians from Italy (facta et de mathematicis magisque Italia pellendis senatus consulta) and that one of their number, a man named L. Pituanius, was cast from the rock, while the consuls had P. Marcius punished in the ancient way outside the Esquiline Gate, aft er the sounding of a trumpet (Ann. 2.32.3). Taci-tus also records the expulsion of astrologers alone under Nero in 52 and under Vitellius in 69 (Ann. 12.52.3; Hist. 2.62.3). Th e expulsion of 52 was prompted by someone’s having asked astrologers to calculate when Nero would meet his end; that of 69 will have been a response to the excessive rôle astrologers played in the aff airs of Otho.61 Th e historian evidently thought the expulsion of magicians and astrologers was a matter of some moment and something worth recording.Th e other occasion in which Tacitus chooses to mention magic is in his account of Germanicus’ death outside Antioch. In describing the illness that laid Germanicus low aft er his return from Egypt to Syria, he brings up Germanicus’ conviction that Gn. Piso had had him poisoned and the discovery in the walls and fl oor of the house outside Antioch in which he was lodged of disinterred human remains, lead curse-tablets with Germanicus’ name on them and partly burned bones from a pyre and other instrumenta magica intended to put Germani-cus into the hands of the powers below.62 Th e discovery accentuated Germanicus’ fears.63 Tacitus goes on to recount the arrest and dispatch to Rome of a woman named Martina, notorious in Syria for practising venefi cia and an intimate of Piso’s wife, Plancina.64 She will have been suspected of helping poison Germanicus and of having tried to bring about his death by devotio. She never reached Rome, dying suddenly at Brindisi; poison was found knotted into her hair, but her body bore 61 On Otho’s dependence on astrologers, see Hist. 1.22.62 Ann. 2.69.3: et reperiebantur solo ac parietibus erutae humanorum corporum reliquiae, carmina et devotiones et nomen Germanici plumbeis tabulis insculptum, semusti cineres ac tabo obliti aliaque malefi ca quis creditur animas numinibus infernis sacrari.63 Saevam vim morbi augeabat persuasio veneni a Pisone accepti (ibid.).

Th ese events are the background to Piso’s being charged with amongst other crimes of having killed Germanicus by means of devotiones and poison.66So much for the moment for Tacitus. Dio Cassius, writing more than a hundred years later, dealt in a more summary fashion with politically-motivated trials under Tiberius, Claudius and Nero, so far as it is possible to judge from what survives of his Histories. He pre-fers to present an analysis of the behaviour of the emperors in ques-tion, giving a few instances of trials to make his point. So the trial of Scribonius Libo Drusus is adduced as an instance of the inconsistency of Tiberius’ practice in the administration of the judicial system. Dio has nothing to say about Drusus’ consulting astrologers and magicians (57.15.4f.). We fi nd an abbreviated version of the trial and execution of Soranus in 65 or 66 CE.67 Dio tells not quite the same story that Tacitus had told at much greater length and without the pathos that marks Tacitus’ account. Th e same holds true of Dio’s version of the trial of Piso (57.18.9f.). In the form we have it (this part of Dio is of course lost, and we have to rely on the epitomes), it has none of the amplitude and pathos of Tacitus’ treatment, nor does it tally with the Tacitean version.68Like Tacitus, Dio records the expulsion of astrologers and magicians from Rome and Italy, fi rst in the aedileship of Agrippa in 35 BCE, then in 16 CE under Tiberius, under Claudius, in 69 under Vitellius and 65 Ann. 3.7.2: nam vulgatum erat missam, ut dixi a C. Sentio famosam venefi ciis Martinam subita morte Brundisii extinctam, venenumque nodo crinium eius occulta-tum nec ulla in corpore signa sumpti exitii reperta.66 Ann. 3.13.2. Th is charge is not even mentioned in the SC de Cn. Pisone, how-ever, which must make it doubtful whether, although the claims surely circulated as rumours and they were mentioned by P. Vitellius, the Senate took a position on them; cf. W. Eck, F. Fernández Gomez and A. Caballos (eds.), Das SC de Cn. Pisone Patre. Vestigia 48 (Munich 1996) 145f. Tacitus seems to concede that Piso successfully defended himself against the accusation that he had used venena against Germanicus: solum veneni crimen visus est diluisse. 67 62.26.2: Σωρανὸς μὲν οὖν ὡς καὶ μαγευματί τινι διὰ τῆς θυγατρὸς κεχρημένος, ἐπειδὴ νοσήσαντος αὐτοῦ θυσίαν τινὰ ἐθύσαντο, ἐσφάγη. 68 Dio states clearly that Piso and Plancina arranged to have Germanicus killed by magical attack (φαρμάκῳ) and the appearance of his corpse when it was put on public show proved this. Piso is brought to trial by Tiberius himself to shake off the suspicion that it was he who was responsible for Germanicus’ death; Piso uses the opportunity aff orded by a postponement of the trial to kill himself."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100 matthew w. dickiefi nally in 70 under Vespasian.69 In the case of the expulsions under Tiberius and Vespasian, Dio dwells on the inconsistency in the behav-iour of these emperors in expelling astrologers while either consulting them themselves or practising the art: Vespasian consulted the best astrologers and was even persuaded by one of their number—Tib. Claudius Balbillus, prefect of Egypt—to allow the Ephesians to cel-ebrate sacred games (66 [65].9.2); as for Tiberius, he had honed his skill in astrology to such a fi ne pitch through his daily association with Th rasyllus that when he was bidden in a dream to give money to someone, he realised it was a visitation from a demon conjured up by sorcery and put the man responsible to death (57.15.7).Dio on several occasions draws the attention of his readers to the interest that an emperor took in magic. Tacitus in what survives of his work has nothing to say on the topic. It would be unwise to draw any conclusions from the absence, particularly if it is the case that an inter-est in magic and an interest in astrology were in Tacitus’ eyes failings of very much the same order. Th e latter interest Tacitus most certainly records. With two exceptions, neither Tacitus nor Dio in what survives of their work mentions an interest in magic-working or astrology in their formal characterisations of emperors. Particular events provide the occasion for mention of the interest. In some cases, the historian goes out of his way to contrive an occasion to mention the interest, an indication perhaps that he thought the matter important and that he believed it was something about which his readers would enjoy hearing. Tacitus’ digression on Tiberius’ interest in astrology is a case in point. It follows on the mention of the marriage of Gaius Caesar, who had been sent to Capri to be Tiberius’ companion. Th e histo-rian declares that he should not fail to mention the prophecy made by Tiberius about Servius Galba when the latter was summoned as con-sul to Capri.70 Th e accuracy of the prophecy, which Tacitus attributes 69 Agrippa: 49.43.5; Tiberius: 57.15.8; Claudius 60.33.3b; Vitellius: 65.1.4; Vespa-sian: 66.9.2.70 Ann. 6.20.3: non omiserim praesagium Tiberii de Servio Galba tum consule. In Suetonius’ version of the story, the prediction is made by Augustus to Galba as a boy (Galb. 4.1). Dio apparently dates the prophecy to CE 20, on the occasion of Galba’s betrothal. Th e reason for his relating the anecdote at this point is that he has just recounted how Tiberius examined the day and the hour of the birth of all Rome’s leading men and had them killed, if he saw anything untoward in what he found (57.19.2–4). Th e larger context is a discussion of Tiberius’ increasing use of the charge of maiestas."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 101to the skill in astrology that Tiberius had acquired from Th rasyllus, provides the opportunity to tell the story about Tiberius’ testing Th ra-syllus’ attainments as an astrologer on Rhodes, an event which led to Th rasyllus’ being taken into the entourage of the emperor. Th e digres-sion on astrology as a science follows (6.20.3–22).Dio’s pretext for introducing into his narrative Tiberius’ associa-tion with Th rasyllus and the skill in astrology that he in consequence attained is Tiberius’ inconsistency in executing and banishing magi-cians and astrologers in the aft ermath of the Libo Drusus aff air, while associating with Th rasyllus and perfecting his own expertise in astrol-ogy (57.15.7–9). It is this that prompts him to relate the story about the daimon sending the dream. It is hard to avoid the suspicion that the historian has gone out of his way to pull Tiberius’ association with Th rasyllus into his narrative, in part because it will enable him to tell a rather frightening story about Tiberius’ powers as an astrologer.71Th e prophetic utterances and movements of stars brought to Ves-pasian’s attention by those eager for him to seize power provide the occasion for Tacitus’ mentioning Vespasian’s addiction to astrology and the weight that he gave to the advice of his household- astrologer, Seleucus, when emperor (Hist. 2.78.1). Dio introduces the subject of Hadrian’s active interest in magic to account for the death of Anti-nous, which in his view was caused not by the youth’s falling into the Nile, but by his having been killed sacrifi cially, victim to the exces-sive curiosity that led Hadrian to engage in all forms of divination and magic.72 Th e two cases in which Dio makes an interest in magic part of his summary of the characteristics of the emperor are Caracalla and M. Aurelius Antoninus, nick-named Elagabalus. I have already mentioned the story of Caracalla’s admiration for Apollonius of Tyana (p. 93); Elagabalus, as part of the worship he paid the god aft er whom he was nicknamed, sacrifi ced boys and practised magic (παῖδας σφαγιαζόμενος καὶ μαγγανεύμασι χρώμενος).73We may round off our catalogue of emperors who take an interest in magic or astrology with two stories of emperors having recourse to magic without achieving the ends they hoped for. Dio records that 71 With due allowance for the interests of the epitomators.72 69.11.3: τά τε γάρ ἄλλα περιεργότατος Ἁδριανός, ὥσπερ εἶπον, ἐγενετο, καὶ μαντείαις μαγγανείαις τε παντοδαπαῖς ἐχρῆτο.73 79 [80].11.

Th e evidence such as it is rather suggests that Tacitus and Dio Cassius thought it worth recording the engagement of an emperor with magic or astrology, since it was an indication of a failing on his part. Two instances of emperors having recourse to magic to no very satisfactory end are not a suffi cient basis from which to draw any very secure conclusions, but they do raise the possibility that the historian recounts them, because he believes magic to be ultimately ineff ective. It may also be surmised that the engage-ment of an emperor with magic was a topic that fascinated readers.It is diffi cult to draw any very wide-ranging conclusions from the fi ve other occasions on which Dio makes reference to magic-working. He three times invokes sorcery on the part of a woman to explain her hold over a man, and he twice tells of Roman armies threatened by heat and thirst receiving succour from rain brought on by magic.75ConclusionIt is above all necessary to acknowledge that the accident of survival very much aff ects our understanding of the part that magic plays in the writings of historians of Rome. We cannot even be sure that what has been lost of the work of Tacitus and Dio Cassius did not contain sur-prises. Any conclusions drawn must, accordingly, be based on Tacitus and Dio Cassius and even they are subject to qualifi cation. Th ere is little room for doubt that Dio Cassius believes both in the effi cacy of magic and astrology; Tacitus too believes that astrologers are capable of predicting the future and he probably also believes that the future could be foretold by magical divination and that magic could eff ect changes in the natural order. Both historians disapprove of magical 74 69.22.1: ̔Αδριανὸς δὲ μαγγανείαις μέν τισι καὶ γοητείαις ἐκενοῦτο ποτε τοῦ ὑγροῦ, πάλιν δ ̓ αὐτοῦ διὰ ταχέος ἐπίμπλατο.75 Cleopatra over Mark Antony: 49.33.4, 50.5.3–4; Agrippina over Claudius: 61.11.3; 60.9.4, 72.8.4."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" magic in the roman historians 103divination. A case can be made for supposing that Dio Cassius thought that the state should take action against those who used magic for divi-natory purposes; we do not have Tacitus’ views on the topic, although it is possible to infer what they would have been. Since he supposed astrology to be a disruptive factor in political life, he very likely took the same view of magical divination; he is aft er all inclined to lump astrology and magical divination together.Most of the references to magic in Tacitus’ Annals occur in the accounts he gives of trials in which the defendant is charged with actions threatening the well-being of the emperor or his family. In such cases, the defendants are charged either with having used magical means to divine the future or of having put a curse on a member of the imperial house. Of the three further references to magic in Tacitus one has to do with the fall-out from the trial of Libo Drusus, one with events that gave rise to Gn. Piso being charged with having killed Ger-manicus through poisoning and magic and one with an aff air, alleg-edly involving magic, in which Tiberius took an active part. Tacitus has nothing explicit to say about emperors taking an interest in magic, but he does record as a matter of some signifi cance an interest on the part of some emperors in a system of belief, astrology, that to his way of thinking was probably as dangerous as magic.Th ere are many more references to magic in Dio Cassius than in Tacitus. Th at is to be explained in part by the much larger compass of his surviving writings. Th ere are diff erences in emphasis and interest between Dio and Tacitus. Dio is not so concerned with the trials in which magic was one of the charges and that Tacitus believed under-mined the Roman state. He does record some of them, but not all. Th e accident of survival makes it diffi cult to say whether Dio’s con-scientious recording of the interest some emperors showed in magic distinguishes him from Tacitus. It is equally diffi cult to come to any determination about the references he makes to women seducing men by magic and magic being used to infl uence the weather. It is impos-sible to say whether they mark him off from Tacitus. What is not in doubt is the importance Dio attached to recording the interest that emperors showed in astrology and magic."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 matthew w. dickieBibliographyBeard, M., North, J. and Price, S.R.F. 1998.

Th e incident took place in Antioch and refl ects the climate of fear that reigned in the city between 371 and 372, under Valens, when a serious but not infrequent administrative episode—the embezzlement of funds from the treasury by two pala-tini—gave rise to an accusation of sorcery that led to maiestas-trials: the alleged conspiracy of Th eodorus. Th e trials resulted in mass death-sen-tences and the burning, in the presence of the judges, of vast numbers of codices and piles of books (innumeri codices et acervi voluminum multi . . . ut illiciti) suspected of containing magic predictions and spells, although most of them, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, our main source for this matter,3 were treatises on liberal arts and law books.4 Denunciation was the crucial factor in the discovery of the ‘guilty’; the result was widespread terror.

He was on his way with a friend to a martyrium situated on the outskirts of the city by the river, when his companion saw an object fl oating on the water:At fi rst he thought it was a piece of linen, but when he got nearer he realised that it was a codex and he bent down to pick it up. As for me, I was happy to claim my part of the fi nd. “Let’s see what it is,” he said, but when he opened it he saw that it contained magic symbols. Just then, a soldier came by. My friend hid the codex in my clothes and we left the scene, scared out of our wits. Who would have believed us, in fact, if we had said that we had found and pulled this book out of the river, when everyone was being arrested under suspicion? We dared not throw it away or destroy it for fear of being seen. In the end, God helped us get rid of it, and thus we rid ourselves of the greatest of perils.Hom. in Act. 38.5In sharing this personal experience with his congregation, Chrysos-tom’s intention was to show them the eff ectiveness of divine provi-dence, but also to warn them—innocent and guilty alike—of the dangers of practising magic. Deep down, he wanted to frighten them with the realisation that the possession of a suspicious codex could lead to charges of sorcery.Th e John Chrysostom who had himself experienced the terror of magic and the fear of being discovered with an illicit codex was court bishop in Constantinople—he had been enthroned a few days before, on 26th February 3985—when, on 4th March 398, the emperor Arca-dius, advised by his powerful praepositus sacri cubiculi, the eunuch Eutropius,6 the person who had brought about John’s transfer and 5 So Socrates, HE 6.2.

In the event that anyone is convicted for hav-ing hidden and not surrendered any of these works for whatever reason, or with criminal intent, he should know that he shall be put to death for possessing harmful codices classed as criminal malefi cium.Th ree comments may be made here. Firstly, constitutio CTh 16.5.34 is the most serious measure taken to repress the Eunomians (the mention of the Montanists is incidental, judging from what may be deduced from information provided by Philostorgius, our main source regarding the sect). It was also the fi rst time that a constitutio equated the possession of heretical books with the crimen of sorcery.8 Secondly, it forms part of a wider process, the use of law to threaten, intimidate, dissuade, even terrorise alleged religious dissidents; it represents in fact the fi rst explicit association in a legal context between magic and heresy (it is clear for example that in 302, the probable date of the 8 HE 11.5 attributes to Eutropius personally the order to burn the works of Euno-mius aft er his death. Th e reference to the Montanists, who appear now for the fi rst time in a law, was merely an attempt to add a certain credibility to the association proposed, as the prophetism of the followers of Montanus was well known in Asia Minor. Th ey do not appear again in legal texts until 410, when they are linked to the Priscillianists (CTh . 16.5.48, 410 febr. 21). On the Montanists, see V.E. Hirschmann, Horrenda Secta.

Sent. 5.23.18 = FIRA2 3 p. 410), I believe that in formulating the punishment the draft smen of the scrinia were con-sciously drawing upon the commentaries of the third-century jurist.My intention here is to set the law in its historical and juridical con-text in terms of these three perspectives. My argument is that Eutropius aimed to frighten the Eunomians by making use of the performativ-ity and coercion inherent in legal language. It was their infi ltration of the sacrum cubiculum and the central administrative departments under the powerful magister offi ciorum, that is, of the three scrinia, the dreaded agentes in rebus, and the scholae palatinae (the palace guard),11 and their ability to stir up the people, together with ineff ectiveness of previous legislation—harsh though it was—that account for the deci-sion to frame the new version of the law in these terms.1.

To these sixty-six we may add those in other chapters that deal directly or indirectly with her-etics.12 From this we may rightly conclude not only that heresy was 9 See S.

Besides 302, there are three other possible candidates, 287, 297 and 307, since there is evidence for the imperial presence in Alexandria in all three years. Th e arguments in favour of 302 are given by T.D. Barnes, Th e New Empire of Diocletian and Constantine (Cambridge MA and London 1982) 55 n. 41. 10 On the formalisation of the legal category of heretic aft er Constantine and the procedures used, see Humfress 2000; also R.

Moreover, a major characteristic of the book is its repeated use of derogatory and vilifying language.13 Th e illicit in the sphere of religion at Rome had traditionally been constituted by terms such as nefas, sce-lus, pollutio, sacrilegium, superstitio, perfi dia, furor.14 As antonyms of the concept pietas, they had served to blacken those who acted against the claimed public good in a religious or moral context.

He distinguishes between the strictness of the laws and their actual application: Th eodosius was simply using the laws as a means to instil fear. Referring to the law proclaimed by Th eodosius aft er the Council “of all the heresies” in 383,23 he comments that, although heavy penalties were laid down in the laws—exile and the stigma of public disgrace—he did not always have them carried out: the emperor did not really mean to persecute his subjects, just frighten them so that they would convert spontane-ously to orthodoxy.24I believe this to be the most plausible explanation of the discrepancy between repressive rhetoric and enforcement, and the repeated prom-ulgation within a short space of time of measures whose force was practically identical. Th e point becomes explicit in a law proclaimed in 425,25 which threatened with proscriptio all enemies of the lex catho-lica, the same treatment being meted out to heretics, schismatics and astrologers,26 whether leaders or followers.

It was essentially the work of the eunuch Eutropius, the prae-positus sacri cubiculi of Arcadius, who was the dominant fi gure in the Eastern court aft er the fall of Rufi nus.27 Addressed to the praetorian prefect of the East, Eutychianus,28 its purpose was made clear in the very fi rst sentence: to cut the Eunomians off from all human contact and thus deprive them of their social infl uence. Th is had been Th eo-dosius’ aim since 381.29Eunomius,30 a pupil of Aetius the Syrian31 and bishop of Cyzicus since 360, became the leader of the adherents of his master’s ultrasu-bordinationist Christology aft er Aetius’ death in 366. Th is was one of the most radical views in the context of fourth-century doctrinal con-troversies, claiming that the Son was in his essence incommensurable with the Father. His theological opponents, who included the most eminent representatives of Nicenism in the East, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus,32 used the adjective ano-moios to characterize this doctrine.3327 Philostorgius, HE 11.5; cf. n. 8 above.28 PLRE 1, s.v.

Indeed, according to Gregory of Nazianzus in his Th eological Dis-courses, particularly in Oratio 31, the neo-Arians were one of the most dynamic groups in Constantinople both before and aft er the arrival of Th eodosius in November 380.37 Th ey not only controlled the agora in Constantinople, however: they were organised as a separate church, with active bishops in all the cities of the East38 and were involved in diligent missionary activity.39 Eunomius and his followers were thus perceived to be threatening the social order.40of Aetius and his thought, and well-versed in the subject, states that although he was accused of teaching ἀνόμοιον, it was not ἀνόμοιος but ἑτερούσιος that was the key word in his doctrine (HE 4.12; 5.11–2.), cf.

Sozomen, HE 7.6.3 indirectly confi rms the point when he describes the eff orts of the Empress Flacilla, driven by pro-Nicene zeal, to prevent Th eodosius from meeting Eunomius, for fear of the latter’s powers of debate. 38 Protected by Julian, the neo-Arians held their fi rst council in Constantinople c. 361, which culminated in the consecration of Aetius as bishop, cf. Kopecek 1979, 2: 414–22. 39 As pointed out by Greg. Naz. in Or. 27, where he says that neo-Arians brought up theological issues everywhere, be it in markets, banquets or festivals in Constanti-nople.

Th e historian Socrates, who claims with some implausibility that Th eodosius’ attitude to heretics was generally conciliatory, emphasises that Eunomians were excepted from this policy of tolerance (Socrates, HE 5.20.4f.). Besides demonising them from that point onwards in the terms I have already noted,42 Th eodosius tried to drive them away from their habitual preaching locations, hinder their organisation43 and commit the public authorities and the ciues to persecuting them through the promulgation of successive laws. Th ese measures prohib-ited their meetings in cities, the countryside and uillae, as well as the holding of religious ceremonies and the ordination of priests. In 383 a further measure directed that properties where illicit assemblies were held were to be confi scated; Eunomians were to be repatriated to their places of origin, with a clause that restricted their freedom of move-ment; furthermore, Th eodosius introduced the procedure of inquisitio, encouraged denunciation, and threatened to infl ict the same punish-ments on any provincial governors and decurions who might have been lax in complying with the laws.4441 Mainly because his theology enjoyed minority acceptance in the see and never received Christian imperial patronage, in spite of his repeated attempts to gain entry to court circles. Without the necessary ecclesiastical and political support, he was forced to compete with successive majority theologies. For a detailed analysis, see M.V.

At the end of the Council sessions, the Emperor proclaimed an ordi-nance aimed exclusively against the Eunomians or followers of the dogma of Aetius: they were stripped of the right to build churches both in cities and in the countryside, and all their buildings, including the land on which they stood, the places where their doctrine was taught and the homes of their priests, were to be confi scated (CTh . 16.5.8, 381 iul. 19).

According to Socrates and Sozomen,45 Eunomius would read his writ-ings and teach his doctrine during these assemblies, thereby increasing the number of his followers,46 among whom were palace eunuchs.Th e situation changed in 388—that is, ten years before the procla-mation of Eutropius’ law. In that year, the Eunomians, from being a dynamic missionary organisation, became a political threat because of their successful infi ltration of the ranks of the palace eunuchs, and their participation in the unrest in Constantinople during the absence of Th eodosius, who had gone to Italy to confront Magnus Maximus in the West.47 Th e outcome of a war between Augusti being always uncertain, Arians and Eunomians saw a chance to put an end to Nicene supremacy while the emperor was absent, spreading rumours that Th eodosius had been defeated and killed. Th ere immediately fol-lowed disturbances in Constantinople, during which the house of the Nicene bishop Nectarius, the visible head of imperial Nicenism, was attacked and burnt down.48 Th e aff air was not only a direct attack on privatis aditionibus intra urbium adque agrorum ac villarum loca aut colligendarum congregationum aut constituendarum ecclesiarum copiam praesumat, nec celebritatem perfi diae suae vel sollemnitatem dirae communionis exerceat, neque ullas creandorum sacerdotum usurpet adque habeat ordinationes.

From Stobi, before going to war, Th eodosius proclaimed a law prohibiting the dis-cussion of religion in public, on pain of summum supplicium.49 Aft er defeating Maximus, the emperor decided to act directly against the Eunomians, whom he now considered a threat to his political position, precisely because of their infl uence in the palace. Th e activity of the Eunomians was seen as bordering on crimen maiestatis. While he was still in Milan (May 389), Th eodosius deprived the Eunomian eunuchs of their right to make wills and receive legacies, thus rendering their property aft er their death caduca fi sci (CTh . 16.5.17 [389]). We know of a second measure through the neo-Arian historian, Philostorgius of Borissus (HE 10.6). Aft er expelling these eunuchs from the palace, Th eodosius ordered Eunomius to be arrested—at the time he was in the city of Chalcedon—and to be deported to Halmyris, near Tomi in Moesia, on the shores of the Black Sea. However, a barbarian raiding-party surged across the river while it was covered by ice and captured the city before Eunomius could reach it. Probably in 390, therefore, it was decided to send him to Cappadocia, his originary province.50 Th e city selected was Caesarea, the see of one of his fi ercest recent oppo-nents, the Nicene champion Basil: it was clearly intended not only to prevent him from proselytising but to make life as diffi cult for him as possible. Finally, because of the harassment he was suff ering from the Caesareans, Eunomius was allowed to retire to one of his estates at Dacora.51However, this rustication failed in its object: the estate became a meeting point for the Eunomians and a centre from which they Nectarius’ house burnt down.

Th anks to his streams of visitors, Euno-mius kept control of the community and repaired his contacts in the palace, thus fl outing the repressive legislation (Sozomen, HE 7.17.4–6). Th is is most clearly borne out by a law issued by Rufi nus, the praeto-rian prefect of the young Arcadius following the death of Th eodosius, four days before he himself was assassinated in November 395.52 In this law, Rufi nus instructed the magister offi ciorum to investigate the scrinia, the agentes in rebus and the palatini, identify the heretics and have them expelled, not merely from the palace but beyond the city walls.53Eutropius, Rufi nus’ successor as monitor of Arcadius’ policies, was equally determined not to tolerate dissidents from Nicenism, or those who disagreed with his policy (which amounted to the same thing). In two successive laws, dated April 21st and 22nd 396, he ordered the new praetorian prefect, Caesarius, to hunt down the auctores, doctores and clerici of the Eunomians with a view to expelling them from the cities, and secluding them from human intercourse.54 Caesarius moved with a will: Eunomius was taken from Dacora to Tyana and placed 52 See K.

However, despite the eunuch’s attempt to prolong Eunomius’ exile beyond his death by relegating his body to somewhere remote and inaccessible, he failed to prevent his tomb from becoming a centre of pilgrimage and veneration. It was then that Eutropius determined to silence Eunomius once and for all, and, as Philostorgius tells us, resolved to issue an edict ordering his writings to be burned.57Th is background allows us to put CTh . 16.5.34 into its historical context. Th e Eunomians were considered a political threat because of their infi ltration of the sacrum cubiculum and the palatine bureaucracy of the magister offi ciorum.58 All previous legislative fulmination had failed to scare them; they had succeeded in continuing to recruit new 55 Vaggione 1987, 359 observes that in Tyana he was eff ectively a ‘cave dweller’, kept out of sight, thus anticipating the name ‘troglodytes’ that his followers were to receive later because of their separation from the human community. 56 Kopecek 1979, 2: 528 n. 7 prefers to follow the chronology proposed by M. Albertz, Untersuchungen über die Schrift en des Eunomius (diss. Wittenberg 1908). He maintains that Eunomius died in Dacora around 394 (cf. Sozomen, HE 7.17.1). However he overlooks the fact that Philostorgius’ fi nal reference to Eunomius appears in 11.5.57 Philostorgius, HE 11.5; cf. L. Cracco Ruggini, Les morts qui voyagent: le repa-triement, l’exil, la glorifi cation, in F. Hinard, La mort au quotidien dans le monde romain (Paris 1995) 117–34, esp. 124f. writes: “Eunomius . . . ensuite exilé par Th eo-dose à Halmyris et plus tard dans les environs de Césarée de Cappadoce, mort là-bas vers 395, fut transporté de la campagne de Dakora jusqu’ à la ville de Tyane sur ordre d’Eutrope . . . et du préfet de Constantinople Césaire, afi n de le separer de son maître même dans la sépulture (si l’on croit l’Histoire Ecclésiastique arienne de Philostorge) et donc éviter l’enracinement d’un culte que la présence des deux célèbres ‘martyrs’ ariens défunts aurait sans doute fortifi é, au coeur d’une petite communaute villageoise telle que Dakora”. However there is no evidence to show that Aetius was buried in Dacora. In fact, Philostorgius relates four separate details: the transfer of Eunomius from his estate in Dacora to the monastic community in Tyana (spring 396); his death there; Eutropius’ refusal to allow him to be buried next to his master Aetius, whose tomb was probably accessible in Constantinople (winter of 396/397); and the order to destroy his writings (March 398). 58 M.

Eutropius therefore decided in 398 to break them by equating Eunomianism with sorcery, which meant the death-penalty. (Th ere is a faint possibility that John Chryso-stom, who had arrived in Constantinople shortly before the law was proclaimed, was behind this step: he was a professed enemy of magic practices,59 had fi rst-hand knowledge of the consequences arising from the charge of malefi cium, debated intensively with the Eunomians of Antioch,60 and directed his fi rst homily in Constantinople against them.61 Moreover, malefi cium does not occur in any of the anti-Euno-mian laws aft er 398. However, there is no positive evidence to sug-gest that he was the intellectual inspiration behind the most stringent clauses of the law. Anyway, given that Socrates dates John’s arrival in Constantinople to 26th February 398, he can hardly have had a hand in framing a law promulgated on 4th March).622.

Th e statement of purpose also serves as a preamble alluding to the laws of 396 (see n. 54). Th is allusion—and the emphasis in civitatum uniuersarum ac urbium—serves to reiterate these earlier measures while at the same time stating the purpose of the new penal stipulations set out in the body of the law.

Th e co-operation of the population was needed to unmask heretics, which involved encouraging delators and threaten-ing possible accessories aft er the fact.63 To prevent Eunomians trans-ferring their meetings to private domus in the city, the second clause prescribed ademptio bonis (compulsory sale of possessions) and ani-madversio ultima for those attending, together with the confi scation of the domus if its owners had failed to report the meeting.64In themselves, these clauses were part of the established methods for dealing with the Eunomians and other heretical sects. Only the ani-madversio ultima is new. Its appearance is due to the fi nal stipulation and the penal clause that goes with it:Codices sane eorum scelerum omnium doctrinam ac materiam continen-tes summa sagacitate mox quaeri ac prodi exerta auctoritate mandamus sub aspectibus iudicantum incendio mox cremandos.

Th e jus-tifi cation is slipped into the fi nal sentence about the death penalty: because such writings are tantamount to magic (malefi cium), which is a crime.Malefi cium, in fourth-century legal parlance, fundamentally denoted malign magic, in other words, a specialised ritual directed against the well-being, physical or mental, of one or more victims.66 Th e pre-398 constitutiones of CTh . 9.16, de malefi cis et mathematicis et ceteris similibus,67 understand artes magicae as the use of spoken sortilegia—recited from dira carmina—and material sortilegia—the preparation of philtres, potions, venenum, medicamenta68—or casting spells, curses, performing exorcisms or making predictions based on numerology or observation of the stars.69 Th e night was of course held to be typical time to evoke the forces of evil or the dead, to cast spells or off er hor-rid sacrifi ces to enable the practitioner to make ominous predictions.70 Th e potential risk here to the emperor’s person explains the close link between the crimes of maiestas71 and malefi cium in some laws and the severity of the punishment.7266 See R.

Only the intervention of Galla Placidia, who threatened to repudiate her marriage to Constantius if Libanius were permitted to become involved, prevented the latter from casting his spells.91Moreover accusations of magical practice against bishops played a role in several religious disputes of this period.92 Athanasius, the cham-pion of Nicenism in the East, was accused of magical practice on no fewer than four occasions by his theological and political opponents.93 Nor was the law of 398 the fi rst time that heretical writings had been burned as magical: Paulinus, the bishop of Adana, and signatory of the council of Nicea, was arrested on suspicion of sorcery and expelled from the Church; his books—supposedly on magic—were burnt by Macedonius, the bishop of Mopsuestia.

Its practice was not confi ned to the lower populace, any more than it had been in previous centuries, when magic rites were even used as a para-legal method of obtaining or restoring justice without recourse to the law.97But the Eunomians did not cast spells, they did not meet at night to off er horrid sacrifi ces, and they had no contact with the Manichaeans, who had been linked with malefi cium since the time of Diocletian,98 or with similar sects such as the Encratites, Hydroparastates and the Sac-cophores, for whom Th eodosius had decreed the summum supplicium in 382.99 It was therefore well nigh impossible to accuse them directly amicus fuit, homini, qui primo malefi cus fuerit accusatus et de ecclesia pulsus usque in hodiernum diem in apostasia permanens cum concubinis publice et meretrices fornice-tur, cuius malefi ciorum libros Machedonius episcopus atque confessor a Mobso com-bussit.

However they had one weak point: the central role played, aft er Eunomius’ death, by his writings. It was here that Eutropius saw his chance.Socrates, Sozomen and the neo-Arian Philostorgius relate that at their meetings the Eunomians would read texts by their founder.100 Our knowledge of the basic texts comes from the rebuttals of his writ-ings by Cappadocian theologians, whose attacks on him show how far Eunomius infl uenced the shaping of trinitarian doctrine in the fourth century (Albertz 1909, 208). For example, his Apologia, delivered in 359 or early 360101 at the council of Constantinople, was refuted by Basil soon aft erwards (Adversus Eunomium).102 In response, Eunomius wrote a second apology (Apologia Apologiae, 378/380), whose content can be reconstructed through the reply by Gregory of Nyssa (Contra Eunomium). Gregory also refuted the Expositio fi dei that Eunomius presented before the “synod of all heresies” in 383 (Refutatio confes-sionis Eunomii).103 Besides these, there were sermons, letters and com-mentaries, such as the one he wrote on Paul’s Epistle to the Romans,104 and perhaps the Syntagmation of Aetius. Th e content of these writings was Christological and pneumatological: his doctrines of agennesia and heterousia had nothing to do with magic. Nevertheless, Eunomius’ skill in the use of the syllogism lent some plausibility to Gregory of Nyssa’s malicious and far from innocent accusation that he had transformed 100 Socrates, HE 5.20; Sozomen, HE 7.17; Philostorgius, HE 10.6.101 L.R.

In my view this is the crux of Eutropius’ law. Codices and their evil nature are mentioned twice: the fi rst occasion, codices . . . scelerum omnium doctrinam ac materiam continentes, represents them as the medium of wicked doc-trines; the second, a sort of expolitio, specifi es their criminal content: noxiorum codicum et malefi cii crimine conscribtorum (retentatorem). Th e fi rst part of this expression is identical to one used by Ammianus to refer to books of magic.107 Eutropius’ draft ers expanded the phrase, which was evidently current in the sense ‘grimoire’, by adding the idea of criminal intent: et malefi cii crimine conscriptorum, which means lit-erally “composed by the crime of magic”, i.e. whose very composition is itself punishable under the laws against malefi cium.108In the fourth century, the term codex meant a book consisting of a set of papyrus (codex chartaceus) or parchment (codex membraneus) leaves folded down the centre and gathered into quaternions or quin-ternions, sewn along the spine and protected by wooden endpieces, sometimes covered in leather.109 Th e format made it not only easy to 105 Th is formula was used by Th eodoretus of Cyrus c. 453 to summarise Eunomius’ theology in the appreciation of his contemporaries: Th eod.

But it was Gregory of Nyssa who most contributed to dubbing his theology a τεχνολογία (Contra Eunom. 1.155; 1.282; 3.1.9; 3.5.6; 3.10.50). See E.

With regard both to manufacture and ease of storage in private librar-ies, it had all the advantages of the modern book over against the roll (volumen). Moreover, because the materials involved were expensive, parchment codices at any rate were valuable objects, indeed luxury items. Th is is borne out by the anecdote of John Chrysostom with which I began this paper; and confi rmed by Jerome.110 Since the sec-ond century, the codex had been the Christians’ medium of choice for their sacred writings,111 accompanying them on their journeys, and used not merely for reading but also as talismans. Th e codices referred to in Eutropius’ law were in fact magical in two senses, with respect to their (heretical) content but also as (talismanic) objects. Th is is why they were condemned to the fl ames, the idea being that in destroying the objects the fi re should purge the stain of heretical pollution.3. Th e Pauline Sententiae as a modelTh e law’s focus on the Eunomian codices was quite deliberate: it was calculated to cause fear. Roman legislation, as well as being casuistic, had always had recourse to legal precedent (Humfress 2000). I believe that the inspiration behind this law was just such a precedent, namely the penal regulations in the Pauline Sententiae against the possession of libri magicae artis. Th is work consists of commentaries ascribed to the jurisconsult Iulius Paulus, an eminent contemporary of Ulpian. Th e text edited and reconstructed by Krüger112 from various sources is not an original or genuine work by Paulus, but was compiled anony-mously in the late IIIp.113 Th ere is nevertheless no reason to doubt that 110 Book-binding was an ancient skill: Jerome, Ep. 18.22 refers to luxury bindings of liturgical books.

Paul Krüger took this to be a comment, and placed it in square brackets, but it has a parallel in 114 Fögen 1993, 75 argues however that the text’s interest in intentions and beliefs, together with Constantine’s express approval of it (see below), strongly indicates that it is not simply a compilation of genuinely Pauline interpretations but breathes the spirit of late-Roman law-giving.115 So rightly Rives 2003, 328; cf. E. Levy, Paulus und der Sentenzenverfasser, SZ 50 (1930) 272–294 (= Gesammelte Schrift en 1 [Cologne 1963] 99–114); Liebs 1993. Oddly enough Dickie 2001 fails even to mention it.116 Litare properly means to obtain favourable omens from a sacrifi ce, but came to mean ‘propitiate’ or ‘conjure’ a deity esp. of the underworld, e.g. Lucan, BC 7.171; [Seneca], Herc. Oet. 757, 981.117 A fi nal clause (§19) stipulates that if a patient dies as a result of the administra-tion of a medicinal drug intended to cure him, the person responsible is to be pun-ished with exile (honestior) or death (humilior). 118 Sent. 5.23.18: Libros magicae artis apud neminem habere licet: et penes quos-cumque reperti sint, bonis ademptis, ambustis his publice, in insulam deportantur, humiliores capiti puniuntur.

VII de offi cio procos. on astrologers and fortune-tellers preserved in Mos. et Rom. legum Coll. 15.2.2,119 as well as in Paul’s own opinions with regard to divination,120 which argues for its authenticity.Two arguments support the theory that the Pauline Sententiae formed the basis of the fi nal provisions of the law of 398 against the Eunomians: the thematic, semantic and penal similarities between the two texts; and the status of the Pauline Sententiae in the fourth cen-tury. On the fi rst point, the parallelism between libri magicae artis (Sent. 5.23.18) and noxii codices et malefi cii crimine conscripti (CTh . 16.5.34) is clear.121 Similar language is employed for searching for the illicit texts: in Sent. 5.23.18 we fi nd reperti sint, meaning “discovered aft er careful search”; its equivalent in CTh . 16.5.34 is the phrase summa sagacitate mox quaeri ac prodi. Th e expressions ambustis his publice (Sent. 5.23.18) and sub aspectibus iudicantum incendio mox cremandos (CTh . 16.5.34) can also be considered as parallel. Moreover both texts make a distinction between (mere) knowledge and the praxis of magic: non tantum huius artis professio, sed etiam scientia prohibita est (Sent. 119 Mos. et Rom. Coll. 15.2.2: Sed fuit quaesitum, utrum scientia huiusmodi homi-num puniatur an exercitio et professio. Ulpian (or rather pseudo-Ulpian) points out that earlier writers condemned only professio, i.e actual practice with clients; but “some later authors” considered mere profi ciency to be criminal. On this compilation of legal opinions, see G. Barone-Adesi, L’età della lex Dei (Naples 1992); F. Lucrezi, Sulla data du redazione della Collatio alla luce di due costituzioni costantiniane, AARC 14 (2003) 599–613.120 Sent. 5.21.4, where he recommends that not only divination, but also possession of handbooks and familiarity with them should be punishable: Non tantum divinatione quis, sed ipsa scientia eiusque libris melius fecerit abstinere—a rather mild formulation. Fögen again argues that these formulations must date from the early fourth century: “Wer auch immer es war, der die einschlägigen Kapitel der Pauli sententiae schrieb, er teilte bereits aus vollem Herzen und ohne Zweifel anzumelden die Überzeugungen der Kaiser des 4. Jahrhunderts, daß Gesetz und Recht für die Gedanken der Menschen Sorge tragen dürfen und müssen” (1993, 78f.).121 Libri magici are mentioned in connection with mala medicamenta and venena already in a passage of Ulpian (Dig. 10.2.4), but otherwise it is quite diff erent, being concerned to distinguish accidental poisoning in a medical context from malign magi-cal substances. By the third century the term liber evidently included the roll as well as the codex: Dig. 32.52 pr. (Ulpian, lib. XXIV ad Sabinum): librorum appellatione continentur omnia volumina, sive in charta sive in membrana sint sive in quamvis alia materia: sed et si in phylira aut in tilia (ut nonnulli confi ciunt) aut in quo alio corio; idem erit dicendum. Quod si in codicibus sint membranei vel chartaceis vel etiam eboreis ves alterius materiae vel in ceratis codicillis, an debeantur videamus . . .; Sent. 3.6.87: libris legatis tam chartae uolumina uel membranae et phylirae continentur: codices quoque debentur: librorum enim appellatione non uolumina chartarum, sed scripturae modus qui certo fi ne concluditur aestimatur."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132 maría victoria escribano paño5.23.18) against: codices sane eorum scelerum omnium doctrinam ac materiam continentes (CTh . 16.5.34), which we can gloss by “codices that contain the teaching and practical resources for its application (materiam)”. Finally, the penalties are similar, in either case ranging from confi scation of property and deportatio to the death penalty. In the latter case, the expressions capite puniuntur (Sent. 5.23.18) and capite esse plectendum (CTh . 16.5.34) are virtually identical.As far as the second point is concerned, there two juridical grounds to suggest that the Pauline Sententiae could have been used as legal precedent for Eutropius’ law. Firstly, Constantine expressly affi rmed the legal validity of the Libri sententiarum. Among other measures aimed at regularising procedure in the courts, CTh . 1.4.2, addressed to the praetorian prefect Maximus in 327 or 328, confi rms the authority previously enjoyed by Paulus’ writings, and specifi cally endorsing the use of the Sententiae in the courts. Th e emperor affi rms that they could be invoked in a trial because of their plenissima luce, perfectissima elo-cutione e iustissima iuris ratione.122 Secondly, the law of Valentinian III (CTh . 1.4.3 [426]),123 which Gustav Hugo called the “law of cita-tions”,124 not only states that the scripta uniuersa of the fi ve iurispru-dentes, Papinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian and Modestinus may be cited as sources of law during the recitatio and that their opinions, insofar as they might resolve the issue, are binding on the judge, but specifi -cally emphasises (against repeatedly expressed doubts) the validity of the Pauline Sententiae at trial: Pauli quoque sententias semper valere praecipimus.125 Both passages indicate that the Pauline Sententiae were accepted as authoritative in 398, and must have been available in the archives of the administration for use by legal draft smen. A fortiori, 122 CTh . 1.4.2 (327 sept. 27): Uniuersa, quae scriptura Pauli continentur, recepta auctoritate fi rmanda sunt et omni veneratione celebranda. Ideoque sententiarum libros plenissima luce et perfectissima elocutione et iustissima iuris ratione succinctos in iudi-ciis prolatos ualere minime dubitatur; cf. Fögen 1993, 75; De Robertis 1998; Fernández Cano 2000, 140ff .123 What is preserved in CTh . 1.4.3 (426 nov. 7) is a fragment of a larger constitutio; see the reconstruction by G. Bassanelli Sommariva, La lege di Valentiniano III del 7 de novembre de 426, Labeo 29 (1983) 280–88. Th is measure regulated the use that was to be made in court of the ‘citations’ of jurists; in other words, who could be cited and how much weight the citations carried.124 G.

To this end, inspired by Paul’s comment with regard to libri magicae artis, he put their heretical writings on a par with magical books. As I have noted, this was not the fi rst time that heretics had been accused of malefi cium (cf. Priscillian), or the fi rst time that heretical books were to be burnt.126 But (heretical) theological writings are actually equated with, or identifi ed as, magical texts for the fi rst time in CTh . 16.5.34.Th e fact that the law was to be formally published—publicly exhib-ited so that everyone was aware of it (sollemniter)—which is quite uncommon, at least in the case of Th eodosius’ constitutiones, strength-ens the argument that it was primarily intended to intimidate.127 Th is impression is strengthened when we consider the evidence for its actual implementation. Some eff ort does seem to have been made to destroy Eunomius’ writings: none of them now survives, and we know them only through the rebuttal of them by his opponents. However, this is hardly likely to mean that no copies survived. In other cases in which a similar measure was taken—for example, the burning of Porphyry’s Adversus christianos writings ordered by Constantine (Socrates, HE 1.9.30) or, further back in time, the order to destroy the works of Ti. Labienus in 12 CE (Dio 56.27.1) or Cremutius Cordus’ History in the reign of Tiberius—the orders were not strictly obeyed and thus their works survived: as Tacitus commented, the sentence itself stimulated clandestine circulation.128 In the case of Porphyry, too, the order was disobeyed, as is shown by the constitutio of Th eodosius II, as late as 126 I have already mentioned the case of Paulinus of Adana (n. 94). Book-burning had a long tradition at Rome: Augustus, Tiberius, Septimius Severus, Diocletian and Constantine himself had all consigned books to the pyre, as symbolic substitutes for their authors: F.H. Cramer, Book-burning and Censorship in Ancient Rome: a Chap-ter from the History of Freedom of Speech, Journal of the History of Ideas 6 (1945) 157–96.127 CTh . 16.5.34: post publicatam sollemniter iussionem.

Furthermore, the appearance of further anti-Eunomian laws with similar content, of which we know seven up to the year 428,130 not one of which mentions sorcery, suggests that they kept up their organisation, their activities and their social infl uence. In fact, the law of 423 prohibiting Eunomians once again from serving in the imperial militia actually omits the cohortalini, the members of the imperial guard (CTh . 16.5.61).In the broader perspective of the legal persecution of heresy, CTh . 16.5.34 represents the fi rst explicit association between magic and her-esy in a piece of legislation, but by no means the last.131 Eutropius’ law was evidently the precedent used in the law issued by Honorius in 409 against the mathematici. Here, astrologers, whose activity, as I have pointed out, was considered virtually identical to sorcery, were repre-sented as having fallen away from catholica religio—which of course was an error—and their codices were to be burnt in front of the assem-bled bishops.132 Th e close collaboration between civil and ecclesiastical law is revealed by the fact that, whereas in Eutropius’ law heretical writings are to be burnt before the judges, here astrologers’ codices 129 CI 1.1.3: Imp.

Ever since the time of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus in the third quarter of the second cen-tury, heresy was considered to have begun with Simon, the Samarian magus who, according to the Acts of the Apostles, had tried to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8. 9–25).135 In the Christian reconstruc-tion of the genealogy of error, Simon was the original from whom all heretics descended; conversely, the genealogy of orthodox truth goes back to Peter through apostolic succession.136All these themes, Simon Magus as the father of heresy, the iden-tifi cation of magic with heresy, the burning of heretical writings and magical codices, as well as the search for legal precedent, recur in a law decreed by Th eodosius II in 435, which forms the fi nal constitutio of the chapter de haereticis. Th e aim of this measure was to stigmatise the followers of Nestorius, who had been archbishop of Constantinople until his removal at the Council of Ephesus in 431, in one of the fre-quent changes of direction that were typical of the Arian dispute.137 It 133 Desanti 1995, 687–96; cf.

IntroductionIn 1999 two blocks of shops were pulled down in the centre of the city of Mainz on a site that in Roman times was not far from the major road that led from the camp of leg. XIV Gemina to the bridge over the Rhine (Text-fi g. 1).2 At a depth of about 5m, the level of the Roman settlement, some structural remains and a paved area of considerable dimensions were found, which turned out to belong not to houses or workshops, as expected, but to two juxtaposed temples dedicated to Isis Panthea and Mater Magna dating from the early Flavian period, or even late in the reign of Nero.3 Th e founders, who are named on two virtually identical inscriptions, were Claudia Icmas, an imperial freed-woman, and Vitulus, an imperial slave (Icmas is named fi rst in view of her higher social rank).4 Another inscription was dedicated to Mater Magna by one of the treasurers (arcarius) of the imperial procurator in Mainz under Vespasian.5 Th e foundation can thus be dated fairly closely to the decade 71–80 CE. In view of the dedicants’ status, it is virtually certain that the Palatine offi ce had given its consent before-hand. Th e brick-stamps indicate that soldiers of leg. XIV Gemina provided the bricks. Nevertheless, there is virtually no evidence that 1 I would like particularly to thank Pierre-Yves Lambert (Sorbonne, Paris), to whom I owe a great debt for his help in deciphering several diffi cult passages in these texts.

It com-prises several cult-rooms and—as usual in mystery-cults—rooms for meetings and banquets, also a well and a latrine. Roughly one hundred sacrifi cial pits for burning off erings, and fi ft een large round sacrifi -cial areas with stone revetments, were found at various points on the site. All contained the remains of off erings (about 8 tons of spoil were recovered). Th ese deposits were extremely well preserved because they had been covered c. 130 CE by several layers of tiles bearing late-Fla-vian and Trajanic/Hadrianic stamps. All the fi nds can thus be dated to the relatively brief period c. 70–130 CE.Th e sanctuary is of very considerable importance for the social and religious history of Germania Superior, and indeed the north-western provinces of the Roman Empire. Actual remains of temples either of Isis or of Mater Magna in this area are extremely rare, and this is the very fi rst joint sanctuary of these goddesses ever found anywhere in the Empire.6 Th ese two mystery cults had been deliberately restricted in the Late Republic and early Principate.7 Few priests of either god-dess are recorded at Rome.8 It was therefore commonly assumed that up to the mid-Ip they were of little importance even in the capital, to say nothing of the north-western provinces. Th e fi rst sign of a shift in attitude was the installation of the Dendrophoria as an offi cial festival of the Roman state by Claudius, who also allowed Roman citizens to hold the offi ce of priest.9Th e turning point in the case of Isis seems to have come under Caligula, when, between 36 and 39 CE, a public sanctuary was built 6 B.H.

In 69 CE Vespasian was informed by the oracle of Serapis in Alexandria, whose cult was associated with that of Isis, that he would become emperor.10 In the same year, Domitian, his younger son, had escaped from the partisans of Vitellius in Rome by hiding among the priests of Isis, himself reportedly dressed in the appropriate clothes (Suetonius, Dom. 1.2). Vespasian and Titus passed the night before celebrating their triumph over the Jews in the Cam-pus Martius temple in 71 (Josephus, BJ 7.123).11 Th ese events may have led to the reconstruction of the temple of Isis on the Capitol in the same year. Th e temple of Isis at Mainz was constructed shortly aft er these events.Th ere is, however, no ancient tradition that provides any informa-tion about why this temple was located in the same sacred area as that of Mater Magna. We might speculate that it was due to the similarity between the two cults, both being mother-goddesses of eastern ori-gin. Indeed, from the late Flavian period onwards, when their cult increased in popularity all over the Empire, we sometimes fi nd citi-zens holding priesthoods in both cults at the same time.12 But this does not tell us why these goddesses were worshipped by an increasing number of Roman citizens not only in Italy but in the north-western provinces.Th e joint sanctuary of Isis and Mater Magna at Mainz and the lead tablets found there are important in this context for three reasons. First, they show that the cult of these goddesses began in the north-western provinces at least a half-century earlier than had previously been thought. Second, for the fi rst time we fi nd Mater Magna invoked in curse-texts.13 Another surprise was to fi nd Attis likewise invoked 10 Tacitus, Hist. 4.81; Suetonius, Vesp. 7.1f. 11 Cf. CIL VI 346 = RICIS 501/0116: Isidi sacr(um). Crescens Caesaris Vespasiani ex viso posuit, probably from the Iseum Campense, Rome. 12 E.g. CIL XIV 429 = RICIS 503/1123 with pl. XCV: DMS L.

Ceionius Rufi us Volusianus, author of a dedication to Mater Magna and Attis: [Matri deum magna Idaeae et Attidi Menotyranno dis magnis e]t[ ]tu[t]atoribus suis (CIL VI 512 = ILS 4154 = RICIS 501/0212, 390 CE), was the son of an Isis-priest-ess, Caecina Lolliana. 13 A phrase in Petronius, Sat. 117.3: nam nummos in praesentem usum deum matrem pro fi de sua reddituram, seems to mean that she could be invoked to bring back sto-len money, but there is no reference here to a curse. Chr. Dunant, Sus aux voleurs, MusHelv 35 (1978) 241–244 published a tablet found in Asia with an invocation to μήτηρ θεῶν, but in that region we cannot be sure it was Cybele.

Neither DTAud nor, nearly a century later, Ogden 1999, 44–46 lists Cybele/Mater Magna or Attis among the gods invoked in such contexts. Just a handful of Attis statuettes and other objects, and a dedication from Mainz de[o A]tti, suggested that he might have been worshipped at all in Roman Germany. By coin-cidence, however, two other curse-tablets invoking Attis have been found very recently, one at Groß-Gerau, a small town near Mainz, published by M. Scholz and A. Kropp in 2004,14 the other far away at Salacia (Setúbal) in Portugal, (re-)published in the same year by Fran-cisco Marco Simón.15 On the other hand, why is Isis never invoked in the new tablets? It may just be that the relevant pits have not yet been found: the general plan of the excavation shows that most of the lead tablets were found in just one area of the joint sanctuary. Another pos-sible explanation is that she was not considered an appropriate deity in this context; but another recently-published text from Baelo Claudia in Baetica shows that she sometimes was.162. Th e Curse-tabletsIt may be useful to provide some preliminary information about the tablets. All but two were rolled up, folded, or both. Size and shape vary widely, ranging from 2.5 × 4.5 cm up to 12 × 26 cm. Fourteen contain fairly lengthy texts, the longest being of forty-six lines. Th e writing too is quite varied: some are in majuscule, the majority in Old Roman Cursive (ORC). In general, the hands are comparable to those dated around the middle of the fi rst century CE; none is later than early IIp.17 Th ere are no signs of the standardisation that would indi-cate professional skill as a scribe. It is consistent with this that, apart Untersuchungen zur Entwicklung des Magna Mater-Kultes im Westen des römischen Kaiserreiches, Diss. Konstanz 1979; M.J. Vermaseren, Cybele and Attis.

Moreover the typical features of learned or professionally-composed curse tablets, which only begin to appear during the second century, are entirely absent.Th e main question I wish to discuss in this contribution is the rela-tion between magic and religion.18 H.S. Versnel has shown that we should draw a relatively sharp distinction between Audollent’s types 1 (judiciary), 3 (personal relations) and 4 (circus/amphitheatre), and texts concerned with theft , loss, cheating and so on.19 He draws a clear contrast between binding-curses proper (defi xiones), which are pre-emptive strikes against the target; and prayers for justice, which appeal to a god aft er the event to aid the principal. Th is distinction between two genres of curse-text allows us to focus on hitherto neglected fea-tures, and to make relatively sophisticated judgements about the many intermediate cases.One of the most interesting and important new texts from Mainz, no. 2 in the Appendix to this paper (inv. no. 201, B 36), helps to frame an answer to the question of the relation between religion and magic. It starts with a solemn prayer to Attis, the companion (πάρεδρος) of Mater Magna, worshipped on the Palatine at Rome since Augustan times, and also in the Metroon at Ostia.20 In our text, Attis is given three predicates: bone, sancte, tyranne (l. 1), the latter term being repeated as Latin domine (l. 4). Th e paraclesis advenias does not, as 18 Cf. Blänsdorf 2005a, b, c. On the general history of ancient magic and related topics, note F.

Th e proem of the curse itself consists of a solemn invocation of all matters sacred to the god (ll. 3–6). It starts with a formal tricolon consisting of a general term: per omnia te rogo, and invocations of ‘your’ Castor and Pollux, and the cistae penetrales. Th e allusion to the Dioscuri seems to justify elevating Attis to the rank of Jupiter (in Groß-Gerau 1, he is even called deum maxsime Atthis and referred to as a member of the divine duodecatheum). I think this is much more than calling him simply ‘the greatest of the gods’, a formula found in several later invocations of various gods.21Th e third power invoked, the cistae penetrales, is not a person but the sacred boxes kept in the sanctuary that contained what were sup-posed to be Attis’ severed genitals.22 As Attis had no sanctuary of his own, the sanctuary of Mater Magna must be meant; we know from several inscriptions dating from the later Principate that there were cistae mysticae in her sanctuary, a reference to the development of mysteries in the cult.Th e inscription from Salacia (Setúbal) I have already mentioned shows that Attis could be invoked in a curse because he was a chthonic divinity. But at Mainz and Groß-Gerau, the chthonic aspect is never mentioned, nor can it have been intended,23 because here Attis is appealed to as the highest god. Many curse-texts from elsewhere in the Latin-speaking west are addressed to a chthonic or a local god unknown elsewhere to punish or even kill a personal enemy or rival. Th e Mainz tablets however invoke the Roman Mater Magna, who had been a member of the Roman pantheon since 204 BCE, and they use the forms and expressions of offi cial religious prayers.Ll. 6–10 of the inner face of our rolled-up plaque and ll. 11–14 of the outer contain the curse itself: the author urges Attis to give or grant Liberalis “a bad mind and a bad end” (des ei malam mentem, malum exitum), i.e. to drive him mad and ensure him a horrible, pain-ful death—“as long as he lives” (quandius vita vixerit). Th is formula is known from two other Roman defi xiones, though here it is used 21 A diff erent position in Versnel, p. 301 n. 91 below.22 Clement of Alexandria, Protr. 2.19 with Σ.23 Apart from the euphemism in no. 16 line 4 below."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" the defixiones from the sanctuary of isis 149with a certain lack of logic.24 Th e paradox implied by the idea of life-long death is picked up in the idea that he may watch every part of him dying—except his eyes (praeter oculos), the defi gens hastily adds, remembering that he would need them to watch his own death. Th e criminal’s subjective awareness of his suff ering was indeed considered by Caligula to be highly desirable.25 Th en the defi gens expresses the hope that Liberalis may not be able to redeem himself, either with money or anything else, nor yet by appealing to the clemency of Attis or any other god. Th e only prospect before him is to be a bad, a shameful, a horrible death (exitum malum). Variants of this quasi-legal formula are found in several other Mainz tablets; analogous phrases are known from Britain and elsewhere. To affi rm the curse, the defi gens returns to the formula of the solemn supplication, which we fi nd also in some other prayers for justice: Hoc praesta, rogo te per maiestatem tuam.In some ways the text belongs to the category of curse-texts for which Eric Turner coined the name ‘prayer (or plea) for justice’ since adopted by Versnel too,26 for example in its appeal to a high god, its tone, and its consistent use of the prayer-mode. Nevertheless other important defi ning features of the category are missing, such as the reason for the curse, and the transfer of the object, and the responsibil-ity for its recovery, to the god.Th e text’s elegant rhetorical structure, consisting of a series of tri-cola and dicola, can be made clear by slightly re-arranging the lay-out of the lines:Bone sancte Atthis tyranne adsi(s), advenias Liberali iratus.Per omnia te rogo, domine,per tuum Castorem, Pollucem,per cistas penetrales,des ei malam mentem, malum exitum, quandius vita vixerit,et omni corpore videat se emoripraeter oculos,neque se possit redimerenulla pecunia nullaque reneque abs te neque ab ullo deo24 If the author had not added malum exitum, the phrase quandius vita vixererit would be perfectly appropriate aft er des ei malam mentem.25 Cf.

InversionMy second topic is the reversed world of magic. A straightforward example is off ered by the obverse of a lead tablet from Cologne (Appendix, no. 3): Vaeraca (or: Uxeraca), sic res tua<s>: perverse agas, comodo hoc perverse scriptu(m) est.28 Th e text itself is written out back-wards (i.e. from right to left ). Th is inversion of the normal direction of writing serves explicitly to model the intended fate of the target: such reversal was believed to have an unmediated eff ect on the target.29 Th e writing itself exerts magical power. Th e specifi cally oral coding of earlier ritual curses—the magical murmur is proverbial—is no lon-ger essential.30 As Stanley Tambiah has remarked, the construction of telling, persuasive analogies is world-wide one of the most important magical resources.31Among the Mainz tablets, no. 4 in the Appendix to this paper (inv. no. 182, 16) is especially interesting in this connection. Although it is written from right to left (i.e. reversed), the individual letters are so easy to read that the inversion cannot have been intended as some kind of secret writing, but only as a symbol of reversed order. Th e tablet solemnly gives or bestows upon the addressee (dono tibi)—i.e. Mater Magna, in whose temple the text was deposited—two people, a 27 On the use of rhetoric in the curse tablets cf. H.S. Versnel, Die Poetik der Zaub-ersprüche, in: T. Schabert and R. Brague (eds.), Die Macht des Wortes (Munich 1996) 233–297; Marina Sáez 1999.28 On the death of M. Riedel, this tablet was deciphered by myself, with the help of A. Kropp and M. Scholz; note also the remarks of Faraone and Kropp below, on their no. 2 (p. 383).29 Tomlin 1998, 84–94.30 Cf.

Horton and R. Finnegan (eds.), Modes of Th ought. Essays on Th inking in Western and Non-western Societies (London 1973) 199–229 at 199: “Magical acts, usually compounded of verbal utterance and object-manipulation, constitute ‘performative’ acts by which a property is imperatively transferred to a recipient object or person on an analogical basis”.

In relation to human-beings, such ‘gift s’ are of course really curses. Th e defi gens may have been a child of a previous marriage now suff ering at the hands of his stepmother and her son. So Mater Magna, the great goddess, is now invoked to settle problems of family life.As regards the genre of this text, although a god is invoked (at least in the phrase dono tibi), in my view the text does not belong to the group of the prayers for justice, because it contains neither a plea for revenge nor a justifi cation for the curse. On the other hand, we can-not classify it as a standard defi xio either, since the binding formula is missing. Th e point can be generalised: many of these texts are too short and too unclearly formulated to allow us to classify them as belonging to the one genre or the other. But all of them were deposited in the same sanctuary and probably accompanied by the same cultic rites.In the most decorative of the Mainz tablets, no. 5 here, the formal layout, which is unique among these texts, itself serves as a magical resource. As such, this is common enough: many Greek and Latin defi xiones employ textual manipulation as a magical device. But almost invariably they do so by creating a border of charakteres or formulae around the main text-block, such as DTAud 218 and 227 (Carthage). Our tablet however contains no charakteres, only intelligible text. Instead of starting writing at the top left of the lead tablet, the writer turned the tablet round 180° and started writing the curse as it were on the last line, beginning quite conventionally from the left margin (see Plate 1). He then carried on writing continuously all round the outer edge, thus creating a verbal ‘box’ with the words Prima Aemilia Nar|cissi agat, quidquid co|nabitur, quidquid aget,| omnia illi inversum sit, “Prima Aemilia (wife/lover/daughter) of Narcissus: (whatever) she may do, whatever she essays, whatever she may do, let all be reversed for her”. Inside this box he then wrote the remainder of the curse.32Th e curse can thus be classifi ed as a true defi xio because of the bind-ing formulas and persuasive analogy; there is no explicit invocation of the deity, and no reason or justifi cation for the curse is given. So 32 Here the writer wishes that Aemilia Prima may ‘rise and live’ as a madwoman, and repeats his initial hope that she be destroyed utterly. Th e third part consists again of an analogy, this time defi ned as an adynaton: “Just as this letter” (which is called carta, despite its being written on lead) “shall never fl ourish or bloom, so she shall never fl ourish or bloom again”. Th is is one of the more imaginative analogies to be found among the Mainz tablets."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152  jürgen  blänsdorfit looks more like a ‘pre-emptive strike’ than a revenge for a crime already committed. Th e analysis corresponds exactly to the character-istics listed by Versnel 1991.33Despite being in Vulgar Latin, the curse against Aemilia Prima is beautifully written and easily legible.34 Some others however are so cryptic that we must conclude that the writer intended the tablet to be read only by the deity. Text no. 6 (inv. no. 167, 41) may be taken as an illustration of the more diffi cult Mainz texts. My fi rst impression was that it might belong to the class of cryptic tablets discussed by Roger Tomlin (Tomlin 2004, 25–27). I even asked P.-Y. Lambert whether it might not be Celtic, a language that was perhaps spoken in this area, given that it had only fairly recently been Romanised. But then I man-aged to read quodsi written from right to left in l. 5, which proved that it was a regular Latin document; and aft erwards some other words: uoto me condemnes, cum eos deuouet and deuoue(t) meos (?). Th e phrase sanum animosum appears to be a wish that a healthy person should die. So we can be sure it is a defi xio but an interpretation is hardly possible even in those parts which can be deciphered.4. Relation to the DivinityMy third topic is the relation between the defi gens and the god he appeals to for help. In the model prayers for justice such as those from Cnidus (DTAud. 1–13 = IKnidos nos. 147–59), we fi nd fi xed formulas: the invocation always appears at the outset and is frequently repeated. In the Mainz tablets, by contrast, the invocation is not necessarily at the beginning, and may later be varied; the other topoi likewise may occur at any point and have no stereotyped form. Text no. 7 (inv. no. 1, 29), which contains all the clichés of the Mainz curse-tablets, is however fairly similar to the Cnidus type since it begins by invok-ing the goddess and gives a reason for the curse. It starts as a prayer, 33 Let me take the opportunity here of alerting the reader to the useful comments on this and several other of my texts by Christopher Faraone and Amina Kropp later in this volume (pp. 381–98).34 Note that, unlike R. Tomlin in Tab.Sulis, I do not feel it necessary to place the term Vulgar in inverted commas: everyone knows that it is simply the term for the ordinary spoken Latin of the middle and late Empire."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" the defixiones from the sanctuary of isis 153with a polite request (rogo te) and a solemn epiklesis (domina Mater magna), and then states both the defi gens’ aim and her justifi cation for resorting to a curse, which is vengeance for the theft of the fortune of Florus, her husband, which has been stolen by a man named Ulattius Severus. From this we may conclude that the author of the defi xio was a widow who, as a woman, had no right to a court-hearing to regain the goods or property, and so had to look for divine help. Severus might have been her guardian who had control of her fortune and so was easily able to embezzle it.As in the previous cases, it is the writing of the tablet itself that is to eff ect the curse, not in this case by script-reversal but by the hostility with which she writes (auerse scribo), which is in itself to aff ect Severus and everything he does or tries to do: quidquid agit.35 Th en in l.9 we fi nd the magic analogy of salt and water as a symbol of the useless-ness of everything the culprit shall do. Th is formula is not simply a comparison but a persuasive analogy to a natural process, which was supposed to confer magical effi cacy upon the curse. Th e whole text is rounded off by a repetition of the solemn request for revenge. Its rich content, concise expression and careful, almost, artistic, lay-out distin-guish this tablet from most others found at Rome and in the provinces of the Empire. It certainly belongs to Versnel’s category of prayer for justice, because the petitioner humbly addresses the goddess for help and asks for revenge. But the persuasive analogy adds a certain touch of magic.By contrast, in Text no. 8 obverse (Plate 2) it is not the god but the target who is named fi rst. Th e name Tiberius Claudius Adiutor is writ-ten out in full in the nominative case; thereaft er he is referred to by the pronouns eum (l. 2), (h)unc (l. 5) and illum (l. 11). Th e petitioner asks Mater Magna to receive him as a victim (hu(n)c (h)ostiam, not hanc!) into the megaron. Th is act of ‘receiving’, which in other tablets is expressed by means of the verbs mando or dono, connotes the surrender of the victim to the god, and is in fact the curse that aims to produce the target’s death. Th e act is to be accomplished in a megaron.36 Th is 35 Quidquid aginat is a formula that occurs in another of the Mainz tablets. Hith-erto, the verb aginare was only known from Petronius’ Satyrica. Heraeus already guessed it was a Vulgar Latin word.36 Either to add emphasis, or by a slip, the phrase “in your megaron” is repeated."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154  jürgen  blänsdorfGreek term denotes either the temple or, less frequently, pits dug for sacrifi ces to the chthonic gods, which seems more appropriate to our context. Th is interpretation is confi rmed by the Salacia (Setúbal) tab-let, where Megarus seems to be the god who is supposed to receive the victim just as he once did in the case of Attis.37—Another magic anal-ogy follows intended to disrupt the target’s life: whatever act he may undertake is to dissolve like salt in water.—On the reverse (Plate 3), a diff erent hand continues the curse, referring to the target only by the pronoun illum. Here his physical capacities are cursed. Defi xiones containing detailed lists of body-parts are not uncommon; by contrast this text mentions only limbs and marrow. Th e lack of a full list is here compensated by verbal magic: the expression deuotum defi ctum menbra medullas is composed of two pairs of alliterations, a stylistic device well known from Latin and Oscan prayers of the archaic period (Marina Sáez 1999). Th e curse ends with another appeal to the gods, in this case naming Attis fi rst, and then Mater Magna, presumably for the sake of symmetry.It is not easy to decide whether this text is a classic defi xio or a prayer for justice. Th e fi rst part seems to be based on the topoi of the prayer for justice: the petitioner solemnly addresses two gods and bids them accept the target of the curse as his off ering. But no justifi cation is off ered for the curse, and there is no demand for justice, which is an essential ingredient of prayers. Moreover, the wish that everything the victim does may go wrong is expressed in the form of a persuasive analogy, which is not a feature of religious language but of magic. Th e second part of the text is introduced by deuotum defi ctum, in the usual manner of defi xiones proper; and ends up by invoking the gods once again. We thus have a text written on the same occasion by two authors, addressed to the same gods and directed against the same tar-get, which contains some expressions typical of prayers for justice but also formulae typical of binding curses. It is worth noting that both authors write in Vulgar Latin but both know the solemn formulae of Roman prayers und use them for magic aims.37 AE 2001: 1135, cf. Tomlin p. 260 no. 4 below. Text no. 7 asks Attis and Mater Magna to “credit the sacrifi ce to his account” (acceptum (h)abiatis), a metaphor from commerce. Th is is the only Mainz tablet to mention the off ering required for every ritual act. In the Salacia (Setúbal) tablet, the off ering is specifi ed as a quadruped."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" the defixiones from the sanctuary of isis 155Th e language of text no. 9 (inv. no. 28, 27) is even more careful and recalls that of legal documents as well as prayers for justice. As usual with theft -curses directed against an unknown culprit, it begins with a general clause (Quisquis . . .) and specifi es the crime. Th e case is that of a stolen purse containing money and golden rings, and the thief is urged to give them back by 24th January at the latest (one of three such deadlines at Mainz). Th e apodosis, beginning at the end of l. 3, states the consequences in case the culprit fails to do so, using the proper term in Roman law, dolus malus. However, this request is then confi rmed by means of a magic analogy: he is to be reversed just as the writing is reversed: when the act of writing is given a special force, we certainly can call this magic. Th en the writer asks all gods and goddesses to treat the thief as an enemy; this appeal to dii deaeque is unique in the Mainz texts, and does not fi t the context of a sanctuary of two goddesses very well.Th e appeal to the gods in a case of theft is certainly typical of prayers for justice, but legal language here predominates over religious.—Th e curse also applies to everybody who touches the stolen objects. Th e following analogy is not well preserved: the comparison is between something liquid (and) the melting of lead (a reference to the ritual practised behind the temple of Mater Magna, as is clear from other tablets), and the destiny of the victim. L. 8 off ers something about innocence and a goddess, but the last line, which is incomplete, does not make clear whether it is the thief who may win back his innocence by returning the valuables, or (less probably) whether it is his victim, i.e. the author of the defi xio, who is innocent.385. Th e Ritual ProceduresTh e fourth topic I want to discuss is the ritual performed to eff ect the curse. In written curse-texts, the appeal to a god was not always com-pulsory. It was likewise not always necessary to provide a justifi cation for the curse, because the petitioner’s intention was made clear by the magic ritual itself. Th us in the case of texts containing only the name of the cursed person, we cannot tell whether we have to do with a 38 Th e word occurs in two British curse-tablets, but there too unfortunately lacks context."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"156  jürgen  blänsdorfpre-emptive strike directed against a rival or a wish to obtain revenge for an injury.Tablet no. 10 (inv. no. 103, 2) lists only the name of Trutmo Florus, defi ned by reference to his father, Clitmo, not his mother, as is oft en the case in the lead tablets found in other places.39 Father and son probably bear German names, the son also a Roman cognomen; the writer of the curse no doubt belonged to the same ethnic group. If so, we might explain the brevity of the text by the fact that newly-Roman-ised foreigners were not very familiar with the details of defi xio-for-mulae. But the writer symbolised his intention by roughly moulding a human fi gure in clay and piercing it with eight needles.40 Th e erect phallus may indicate that the defi xio was an erotic one. More impor-tant, however, is the fact that the poppet was broken at the waist and carefully deposited in such a manner that one half was supine, the other prone. So we may conclude that the intention of the ritual was to kill the target-person.Th e binding ritual could also be performed on the lead plaque itself, as an analogue of the desire to harm the victim. Th us a large iron nail was driven straight through the lead of tablet no. 11 (inv. no. 109, 5), so destroying much of the written text (Plate 4). Th e aim here was certainly not to announce the curse in public but to sym-bolise it. Little of the obverse can now be read, except for the name Fortunatus (?), written left to right. On the reverse, written right to left , we can easily read four nouns: mind, memory, heart, thoughts. Th e rest of the sentence warns everybody who does or did something to his father: this suggests that the text belongs to Audollent’s genre of tabulae iudiciariae, and was intended to prevent an enemy from speaking at court away by blocking his mental abilities. Th e tablet and its text are clearly to be classifi ed among the defi xiones proper. It is reinforced by another example of two alliterative pairs comparable to those common in archaic Roman prayers: mentem memoriam cor cogi-tatum. Language and ritual had to be combined in order to intensify the eff ect of magic.Our next example, no. 12 (inv. no. 182, 14 B), envisages the end of the ritual act of cursing. As in most of the other texts, it is the demand for help that comes fi rst, not the name of the god appealed to. On the 39 In the Mainz tablets, there is no case of maternal lineage.40 Cf. J.

Th ey are to eff ect the return of the goods that had been entrusted to P. Cutius and Piperio. Th e crime must therefore have been embezzlement. By using the term religione, the author emphasises that his request is in accordance with the rules of a religious prayer. Like the demand for the restitution of his property, this fi ts the genre of the prayer for justice. But the text on the reverse is diff erent. At the beginning, two other persons are added to the curse, Placida and her daughter Sacra (both names are to be found on several other Roman inscriptions). But the magic analogy that follows is probably directed at all four of them: “May their limbs melt as this piece of lead melts, in order that they may die”. From this we may conclude that at the end of the ritual the lead plaque was thrown into the sacrifi cial fi re. Th is item is not otherwise attested on defi xiones, but references to it recur on two other Mainz tablets no. 13 (inv. no. 182, 14 A) and no. 14 (inv. no. 182, 9) that were found together. Such an act is much more than a persuasive analogy: the ritual act is itself to produce the desired eff ect. Th ough introduced by an expressly religious formula, this is certainly pure magic.Moreover, among the fi nds there are some tablets, such as no. 16, where we fi nd the molten lead clinging to the lower edge of the tab-let, others, such as no. 15 (inv. no. 182, 28), which are partly molten, and then again many lumps of melted lead. Obviously the defi gentes intended the tablets to be destroyed completely by fi re and the texts written upon them to be read exclusively by the gods. Th ey must have been aware that magic was forbidden in Roman law.41 Some of the lead plaques, however, were protected against the fi re by the cold ashes at the bottom of the sacrifi cial enclosure.41 See the lex Cornelia de sicariis et venefi cis ap.

Th e Major TextsAft er this review of the diff erent aspects and stages of the Mainz defi x-iones, I now propose to deal with some of the major texts. Let us begin with tablet no. 16 (inv. no. 182, 18), which is rich in invocatory details and cruel wishes.As we have already noted, curse-texts directed against unknown persons are introduced by a general clause (quisquis . . .). In the present case, the crime is fraud or cheating (dolus malus is again the proper term in Roman law). In ll. 1 and 5 we read that it was some matter of bribery; this suggests it might be a tabula iudiciaria. R. Gordon sug-gested to me that the fi rst two lines must have contained a general ani-madversion against such wrongdoers. Th e petitioner appeals to Mater Magna because she pursues her enemies or wrongdoers over land and sea, places dry and wet, and even in the netherworld, where her dead lover Attis is.42 At fi rst sight, such a topos seems comparable to the so-called aretalogies of hymnal prayers; but at Mainz, we fi nd no refer-ence to the divine qualities of Mater Magna (or Cybele) as the mother of gods and men, mistress of animals and protectress of the state. Th e same applies generally to all the invocations of Mater Magna and Attis at Mainz: they are never invoked on account of their ‘public’ qualities; here, in a private cult, they are nothing but helpful divine forces.Th e magical analogy which follows refers to the self-castration of the galli, who are mentioned twice, and the priests of Bellona, “who spill their hot blood, which is cold when it touches the ground”. Th is expression, which sounds as poetic as it is cruel, is quite unparal-leled. Th e comparison with the rites of the goddess’ followers is not as untoward as it may seem. For the galli were not the offi cial priests of Cybele; they were despised by Roman law and culture; as tablet no. 18 (inv. no. 31, 2, below) expressly tells us, they were regarded as outside the limits of human society. I have been unable to identify the third group of ecstatic men who wound themselves, the magali, who are listed aft er the galli and the bellonarii.Th e other topoi of this text occur elsewhere: the impossibility of redeeming oneself by off ering sacrifi ces or paying money (l. 8), the paralysis of one’s mental faculties (l. 11), the death of the victim in 42 See the commentary below for the signifi cance of the enigmatic per benedictum tuum."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" the defixiones from the sanctuary of isis 159public (l. 14, but only on another of the Mainz tablets),43 fi nally, the limbs dissolved like salt in water (l. 14, also a Mainz cliché, here applied not only to everything the target does but to his physical body). Th e end of the text ist marked by the request that the criminal may come tomorrow to the temple of Mater Magna and confess his guilt; the appeal the god legitimates the redescription of the crime as sacrilege (nefas). Th e god is to accomplish the curse and ensure the victim a horrible death, so that the defi gens in turn may fulfi l the votive he has promised. Th is religious turn is to be compared with Groß-Gerau 1 (AE 2004: 1006b), where what Priscilla has done is represented as a sacrilege the gods have to avenge (vindicate numen vestrum magnum a Priscilla quae detegit sacra).44In this markedly religious text the characteristics of a prayer for justice predominate, nevertheless some features of the magical defi xio are clearly present.Th e curse pronounced on both sides of tablet no. 17 (inv. no. 72, 3) is even more cruel, because the two authors demand that three women should die in public. As in tablet no. 8 above, the two sides of this tab-let, containing 26 and 20 lines respectively, were clearly written by two people. Th e letters of the inner face show an elegant majuscule cursive script of 5 mm height; the outer one letters up to 10 mm height, but soft strokes and few curves, and extremely long strokes covering even the next one, two or even three lines. Th e mannerism of this script is unparalleled! It seems evident that the writers performed the appro-priate ritual at the same time, both of them invoked Mater Magna and used the same topoi with some slight variants of wording; the second inscription simply continues the last sentence of the obverse by means of the conjunction nec and adds the formula that the curse shall be unredeemable.Th e fi rst part of the text, written in the inner side of the tablet, starts with a formal invocation of Mater Magna and her divine power. Th e fi rst of the three women named on this side is Gemella, who is accused of having stolen some brooches or ornamental pins (fi b(u)las). Th e writer wishes Gemella may cut herself and not heal. Th e punishment envisaged is a bleeding wound like that of the self-castrated galli, the frenzied followers of Mater Magna, an analogy repeated in two others 43 For further discussion ot this topic cf. the commentary on no. 17 ll. 15–17.44 See n. 14 above."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"160  jürgen  blänsdorfMainz tablets. Gemella likewise has placed herself beyond the bounds of social life; her life and health are to be damaged like something deposited in the sanctuary—possibly the pine-tree mentioned in no. 18 l. 7. As in tablet no. 2 above, she is not to be able to redeem herself by paying a ransom. In this section Gemella herself is addressed to as if she were present—a symptom of the author’s rising emotions. Finally, as a climax, we fi nd the wish that the people may watch the victim being executed in public. Amina Kropp, who has compiled an electronic data-bank of all Latin curse tablets, told me that this for-mula has not been found on other Latin texts. Th ere seem to be some parallels in Greek curse-texts, but in the Cnidus texts the culprit is ordered to climb up to the sanctuary of Demeter and confess his guilt publicly.45 Henk Versnel has suggested to me the Greek expressions ὄχλου πολλοῦ περιστάντος and δημοῦ παρεστῶτος might be parallels. But the context in these cases is quite diff erent. One is an Epidaurian miracle inscription that recounts the miracle of Amphimnastos, a fi sh-monger who had tried to cheat Asklepios of the promised 10% of his bargain, but when he was on the market of Tegea, a thunderbolt hit the fi sh and burnt them. Amidst the market-crowd Amphimnastos confessed his guilt, prayed to the god, and at once the fi sh were alive again.46 Th e other inscription, likewise on marble and dating from IIIp, is from Rome and describes another miracle of Aesculapius: a blind man was ordered by the god to come into his temple and pray to the god and was healed at once. So the crowd was happy to see the vir-tues fl ourishing under the reign of Antoninus.47 Both texts are miracle accounts, the interaction is exclusively between man and god, there is no petitioner writing a curse, the crowd is needed to testify to the miracle. In the Mainz curse text, however, the author of the lead tablet wishes for a public execution like that of condemned delinquents in the circus; the crowd is to be present to humiliate the target of the curse. Th e formulae here are thus quite diff erent from those of the miracles.Th e second section of the obverse text is directed against two women, Verecunda and Paterna, who are handed over to Mater deum 45 DTAud 4: ἀνα[βαῖ] παρὰ ∆άματρα . . . ἐξαγορεύων; see my commentary on Text 17, ll. 15f.46 IG IV.12 123 ll. 22–8 = L.R.

Th e writer demands the women may not even redeem themselves by “sacrifi ces bearing wool”. It was Pierre-Yves Lambert who made me realise this simply means “sheep” (cf. Juvenal, Sat. 8.155).Th e second part of the alternative clause nec . . . follows on the reverse, which is written in a signifi cantly diff erent hand. Th is writer repeats the formula of the unredeemability of the curse by means of lead (i.e. defi xiones), gold or silver, adding “from your divinity”, and wishing that dogs, worms and other prodigious beings (alia portenta) might devour them. Th is wish can be explained by some parallels from Herodotus, the Bible and the history of pagan persecutors of Christian martyrs: wicked men are killed by worms eating their entrails. In Groß Gerau 2, the writer requests that the target be eaten up by worms and cancer (Blänsdorf 2007). Th e fi nal wish that the people should look at their death is repeated with slight variations from the obverse side. In the remainder of the text, the letters become ever fainter and the lines begin to scramble. Th ere is a reproach for having done something with two things which were held in common, and a series of words ending with -as two of which can already be understood: there is an allusion to the sacred golden boxes hidden in the sanctuary.Let me add a conjecture about the personality and the character of the two writers of this tablet. Since their three victims are women and the extravagant punishment envisaged for the theft of some items of jewellery is death, the writers might be women themselves, and the extravagant handwriting of the reverse face of the tablet leads to the same assumption. Following again the line of Versnel’s classifi cation of curse genres, we fi nd here again distinct characteristics of a prayer for justice: the humble address to the deity, the justifi cation for the curse, the idea that it shall be unredeemable, and the cruelty of the punishment, but also a magic analogy.Th e most unusual and sophisticated curse of all is to be found in a text inscribed on a tablet of an unusual oblong form, cursing a person named Quintus (no. 18 = inv. no. 31, 2; Plate 6). Th e grounds given for the curse are quite unusual, as Amina Kropp realised: Quintus has turned against himself and his plans and those of life (the grammar of the sentence is not quite correct). In this case, the defi gens claims that his victim’s moral dissolution justifi es his desire to destroy him. Th e curse itself is expressed in four magical analogies: 1. Just as the galli,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"162  jürgen  blänsdorfthe ecstatic followers of Mater Magna, castrated themselves, and the similarly ecstatic followers of Bellona, who was likewise worshipped in Mainz, infl icted wounds on themselves, so should Quintus lose his social credit, his reputation, his ability to manage his business aff airs. Fides, fama, facul(i)tas are an alliterative tricolon, a well-known rhe-torical device. 2. Just as the galli and the bellonarii cannot be classed as human, so he should not be either. 3. Th e third analogy, which does not really fi t, names Quintus’ crime, i.e. fraud: just as he committed fraud, so is Mater Magna to deceive him. 4. Th e fourth comparison is again a magic analogy which alludes to a ritual in the shrine: just as the tree brought into the temple during the dendrophoria will wither, so are his fi des, fama, fortuna, facul(i)tas to wither. Just as the alliterative tricolon has become a tetracolon, so, at the level of the whole text, the whole series of analogies forms a tetracolon. Th e curse is summed up by the wish for revenge and the death of the culprit within a year. For a long time we did not know which god is invoked for help, but P.-Y. Lambert fi nally saw that near the end of the text (l. 8) Attis is named in a very curious spelling of the vocative case of his name and title: Attihi d(o)mine.As concerns the genre of the text, the characteristics of a binding curse prevail: the binding term is depono (l. 1), there are four persua-sive analogies which certainly belong to the world of magic, but on the other hand there is a justifi cation of the curse, an address to a helpful god and the wish for revenge. I would not call this a borderline case of the prayer for justice, but a perfect blending of binding curse and prayer for justice, i.e. of magic and religion.Th is text exhibits considerable education; the language is classical Latin. Th e petitioner uses legal terms and constructions (dolus malus, -ve), and stylistic devices of Roman rhetoric, a rare instrument of magic, but no traditional magic formulas. So this text certainly does not follow the established clichés of curse texts. Th e clear implication is that it was conceived by the complainant himself.Th e rhetorical structure of the text can be shown by re-arranging it in terms of the syntactic cola. Th e dicola, tricola and tetracola are indicated by numbers, letters, and italics:Quintum in hac tabula depono(1) auersum se (2) suisque rationibus (3) uitaeque male consummantem.(A) ita uti (1) galli (2) Bellonariue (1a) absciderunt (2a) concideruntue se,sic illi abscissa sit (1) fi des (2) fama (3) faculitas.(B) nec illi in numero hominum sunt, neque ille sit."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" the defixiones from the sanctuary of isis 163(C) quomodi et ille mihi fraudem fecit, sic illi, sancta Mater Magna, et relegas cuncta.(D) ita uti arbor siccabit se in sancto,sic et illi siccet (1) fama (2) fi des (3) fortuna (4) faculitas.tibi commendo, Att{i}hi d(o)mine, ut me uindices ab eo, ut intra annum uertente[m] . . . exitum.7. Conclusions1. Th e new texts provide interesting insights into the religious and social life of a new settlement on the borders of the Roman Empire. Th ey display as great a variety of contents as they do of forms and handwriting. All the texts are curses prompted by fraud, theft of money or jewels, embezzlement, rivalry or jealousy.2. Th e normal patterns of imprecation are used,48 but not accord-ing to set formulas with fi xed clichés and complicated wording, but in individual variations combining words of common language with quite unusual phrases. Th e authors of the Mainz tablets display a lively imagination, especially in the fi eld of magical analogies.3. On the other hand, bare lists of names of cursed persons are not found at Mainz, nor are elaborate magical incantations and images, of the type known from North Africa, Athens, Rome and elsewhere, which only professional sorcerers could produce. Even the manner in which the gods are invoked, both the formula itself and its loca-tion in the text, is variable. Th e invocation is expressed in a plain lan-guage which did not have to be learnt by heart or copied from magic books, as in texts of eastern origin. Instead of those fi xed formulas, the authors used the style of Roman prayers, allusions to Roman legal terminology, and stylistic elements of artifi cial or popular rhetoric.4. Th e conclusion must be that these texts, or at any rate most of them, were not written by professional sorcerers or their scribes, but by private individuals—men as well as women—who may perhaps have known some of the most important methods of ritual cursing, but who wrote (and surely uttered) their wishes themselves, in their own words, presumably in secret, for reasons of security. Th e reason for this linguistic variability is probably the early date of the Mainz inscriptions, which precedes by nearly a century the development of 48 On the typology of curse tablets cf. Gager CT."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"164  jürgen  blänsdorfset formulas known from elaborate curse tablets in Latin. Th e writers seem to belong to the middle or even the upper classes. Persons of this standard of education were able to compose and write texts by themselves and did not need scribes. Only three of the thirty-four tab-lets are written in Vulgar Latin. Curses clearly directed against freed-men or slaves, presumably by their peers, are very short and written in rather unskilled hands.495. Th ese appeals for divine help against injustice are addressed neither to the well-known Roman gods, nor to those of the under-world, nor to demons, but only to Mater Magna, who is invoked eight times on six tablets, and Attis, her companion, who is invoked six times on fi ve tablets. Mater Magna is never otherwise invoked in such documents. However two roughly contemporary tablets invoking Attis, Groß-Gerau 1 and one from Salacia (Setúbal) in Portugal, have recently been published.6. Th e question of the origins and means of transmission of the practice of cursing at Mainz is a vexed one. Th e hypothesis of a strong eastern infl uence advanced by some colleagues is based on the fact that on the whole the cults of Kybele/Cybele/Mater Magna, Attis (and Isis), as well as the writing of curses and the performance of the cor-responding rituals are of eastern origin. Furthermore some individual topics and formulae are paralleled by eastern curse texts, though most of them are to be found in documents that are at least a century later than the Mainz tablets. Certainly we would expect a considerable num-ber of Greek words in the texts, but there is only one, viz. megaron.Th e fi rst line of inquiry is the sources of the population of Mogun-tiacum. Th ere was a detachment of Ituraeans that was briefl y stationed in Mainz in Ip (second half ). But not only is there no trace whatever of these men of oriental origin in the curse texts but the Roman army itself hardly appears, except in two texts, whose authors and targets are all Romans!

Th e cult of Mater Magna had been practised at Rome since the late IIIª, and though the Roman Senate tried to restrain it because of its orgiastic character, the public and private veneration of the goddess was alive at all times in Rome and Italy, as is shown by the votives found in the temple of Mater Magna on the Palatine. Likewise Egyptian Isis in her Hellenistic transformation had been present at Rome since the late IIª, and Bellona, originally a Roman goddess of war, was gradually transformed into the oriental Mâ from the late Republican period. Th ese oriental deities were thus well known to the inhabitants of Rome, and in a position to spread all over the Roman Empire.Th e third argument against direct infl uence from the eastern Medi-terranean relates to the content. None of the striking characteristics of the (mainly later) magical defi xiones, the endless repetition of fi xed formulae, the magic letters, words and drawings, and the catalogues of ‘names’, occur in the Mainz texts. Th ere are no close verbal parallels to the Attic curse texts dating from IV–Iª. Despite their considerable number, the Cnidus tablets, which can be dated around Iª, show only few variations of format and expression. Th e nearest typological paral-lels to the Mainz texts are the Latin curse-tablets from the mid- and late Iª and the British texts of the late Ip–IVp. Nevertheless there are very few precise parallels either in aims or language. It is the lack of standardisation, the resourcefulness of imagery, and the elaborate lan-guage and style that distinguishes most of the Mainz texts from both the eastern and the western traditions of written curses.51 E.

But in pagan (as well as Christian) inscriptions benedictus can be used as an epithet of a loved (deceased) person. I cite only those inscrip-tions in which benedictus is an epithet and not part of the name: CIL VI 12464: Dis Man(ibus) Artemisia Caesaris vixit ann(os) XXX. Horea fi lia matri bene merenti fec(it). Tito co(n)iugi patri parenti benedicto bene merenti, Clodia Donata Flavia Procula Clo(diae) Don(atae) matri bene merenti fecit; VI 20513 D(is) M(anibus) s(acrum) Iuliae Heu-resi sanctissim(ae). volente fato vixit annis LXXXII. hic super ossua cineresq(ue) tuos benedicta quiescis. fecit Pomponia Trophime bene merenti; VI 24634: D(is) M(anibus) C(aius) Pomponius Philadespotus fecit sibi et Pomponiae Euhodiae benedictae coniugi carissimae, quae vixit mecum annis XXXX sine quaerella, et in hoc sepulchro ne quis ponatur nisi fi li(i) mei et Pomponiae Hygiae fi liae bened(ictae); VI 25408: D(is) M(anibus) Restituti animulae bonae et benedictae. sit tibi terra levis; VI 25569: Rufi n(a)e fi liae benedict(a)e; VI 29642: Dulcis aput Manes Zoe benedicta moraris. tu secura iaces, nobis reliquisti querelas. pr(a)ecesti hospitium dulce parare tuis; X 8418 (Velitrae): Cl(audiae) Poll(a)e co(n)iu/gi benedict(a)e, qu(a)e mecum vixit sine macula annis XIIII mens(ibus) VII diebus VII Sotericus Aug(usti) n(ostri) b(ene) m(erenti) f(ecit).

Th us Attis’ chthonic aspect, which is here just hinted at in an enigmatic and euphemistic way (compare the Salacia text, AE 2001: 1135),59 actually fi ts the series of locative defi ni-tions of the power of Mater Magna quite well.58 tuum denotes a close personal relation, cf. the invocation of Attis in no. 2 l. 4: per tuum Castorem.59 Domine Megare invicte, tu qui Attidis corpus accepisti, accipias corpus eius, qui meas sarcinas supstulit . . .

Here I need give just a brief account of the excavation and the cult of the goddess and the nymphs before going on to present a selection of the fi nds that came to light in the cistern of the fountain, which off er new perspectives on the rituals and cult performed at the shrine, and are of particular interest for the question of malign magic at Rome, mainly, but not exclusively, in IVp.2 Th e fountain consisted of two parts, a cistern (length unknown; 2.93m wide, c. 2.50m high) built around the spring itself; and, in front of it, and slightly below, an open rectangular trough or basin (4.38m long; 0.88m wide), built using a late-antique technique of bricks alternating with tufa blocks (opus vit-tatum).3 When found, this trough was fi lled with sizeable sherds of 1 Th is is a revised version in English of my earlier reports in Italian, which include some further details.

Th e fi rst important discovery was the three inscribed monuments dating from IIp, briefl y described below, two of which bear the dedica-tion Nymphis sacratis Annae Perennae. Th ey had been incorporated into the revetment of the late-antique trough (see below), and are of great interest both as being the fi rst inscriptions from Rome to men-tion the name of the deity, and her nymphs, and in providing new information about the public cult itself.4Anna Perenna was an ancient Roman deity; according to the Tibe-rian Fasti Vaticani, her festival at Rome was at that date celebrated on the Ides of March (15th) near the fi rst milestone along the Via Flaminia in the Campus Martius.5 Th e fact that the Fasti Vaticani mention the celebration at the 1st milestone seems to contrast with the archeo-logical evidence of the fountain fi ndspot, which for sure can be placed between the 2nd and the 3rd milestone. Peter Wiseman has recently expressed the hypothesis that in the early imperial age the cult of Anna Perenna was shift ed from an unknown site close to the 1st milestone (i.e. more or less near via Condotti) to Piazza Euclide, on the basis that the coins I have found date back between the Augustan age to the reign of Th eodosius, while there are no coins of earlier date. Apart from the fact that in Roman religion cults are moved very rarely and for very serious reasons, I here repeat what I have already said many times to Wiseman (who, by the way, does not know the site at all): the late-antique fountain is only a part of the fi nd, for beside the trough in opus vittatum there is another one in opus reticulatum severed by the car-park piling, which is certainly much earlier. Moreover, the archae-ological evidence is confi rmed by the presence of ceramic materials found in direct contact with the spring itself: two miniature kyathoi and several fragments of Campanian pottery, votive fi gurines and oth-ers, all of which date between IVª and IIIª, demonstrating beyond any reasonable doubt that the cult of Anna Perenna has always been there 4 Th e fountain has been open to public since 3rd December 2004. A selection of materials has been on show since June 2001 in the new Epigraphic Section of the Museo Nazionale Romano delle Terme.

Th e solution proposed by Adriano La Regina, in his Introduction to Piranomonte 2002, that the Fasti could refer to the wall circuit of the pomerium, which was largely extended by Claudius and to the 1st cippus of the pomerium found in Via Flaminia 53 (300 metres outside the present Piazza del Popolo) has been criticised,6 but it presents again the incredible controversy between historians and archaeologists, who oft en make the mistake of fi nding “out of place” temples and sanctuaries, whose location seemed assured on the basis of literary and other sources (Wiseman 2006, 59f.).7In the Fasti, Ovid provides a memorable account of this popular cel-ebration at the original site.8 In his day, the festival took place not far from the Tiber bank (non procul a ripis, advena Th ybri, tuis, 524) and had a markedly licentious character: during the celebrations quantities of wine were drunk, and the couples laid down on the grass or with-drew into tents or improvised bowers built with branches and togas placed over cane props.9 Everybody thus celebrated the coming of the 6 See in particular Capanna 2006, pp. 65–70.7 Th e location of the fountain in the area where I have found it seems assured by Martial 4.64.16f.; the mention of Fidenae, some little way due north of Rome along the Via Salaria, among the places that can be also seen makes it certain that the monte Mario is meant. Th e expression longo Ianiculi iugo remains curious, but see S.B. Platner and T. Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Rome (Oxford 1929) 274 s.v. Ianiculum. Wissowa 1894, 2223 was rightly sceptical of Pliny’s mention of an Annae templum (HN 35.94): this is the reading only of the Bamberg ms., all the others read Antoniae. Given that a temple of Anna Perenna (even supposing there was one at Rome, which is highly unlikely) is hardly likely to have contained a statue of Hercules, Preller’s conjecture Dianae is preferable. Little can be done with a ceramic fragment with the letters ANA found in the Cloaca Maxima.8 Th e festival: Fasti 3.523–42; 655f.; 675–96; Anna: 543–654; elaborated by Silius Italicus, Punica 8.49–201; see further the important commentary by F. Bömer, P. Ovidius Naso. Die Fasten (Heidelberg 1958) 2: 179–92; a narratological perspective in F.-R. Herber, Ovids elegische Erzählkunst in den „Fasten“ (Diss. Saarbrücken 1994) 300–12. Between 222 and 153 BCE, the consuls had taken up their offi ce on the Ides of March (in the latter year the date was moved to 1st January); early on in the Fasti, 1.149–60, Ovid toys with the idea that the year ought ‘naturally’ to begin in March, but the 1st, not the 15th: D. Feeney, Caesar’s Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History (Berkeley and Los Angeles 2007) 204. Th e most important literary references can be found in F. Graf, s.v. Anna Perenna, DNP 1 (1996) 708. See further the useful discussions by R. Lamacchia, Annae festum geniale Perennae, La Parola del Passato 63 (1958) 381–404; G. Brugnoli, Anna Perenna, in idem and F. Stok, Ovidius Parōdēsas, Testi e studi di cultura classica 10 (Pisa 1992) 21–45. 9 Martial 4.64.16 (see n. 7 above) writes: et quod †virgineo cruore† gaudet, which, if it makes any sense, might imply that at the Piazza Euclide site girls lost their virginity, something Ovid does not mention. O. Immisch, Der Hain der Anna Perenna, Philo-logus 82 = NF 36 (1927) 183–92 suggested reading virgineo crudiore, which seems, if anything, even less intelligible."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"194  marina  piranomontenew year and of spring, convinced as they were that they would live as many years as cups of wine they had drunk.10 Th ere was singing and performances of mimes; and all through the festivities women were to be seen dancing around with their hair unbound. At the same time Ovid provides a good example of the way in which obscure ancient deities could be, and were, re-invented in the late-Republican/Augus-tan age of antiquarianism. He off ers a number of diff erent versions of the origin and identity of the deity. According to the most popular one, she was to be identifi ed with Dido’s sister Anna, who aft er Dido’s death in Carthage fl ed to Malta and thence to Latium, where she was welcomed by Aeneas. Hated by Lavinia, who caused her to drown in the waters of the Numic(i)us river, Anna became the nymph of the locality and took the surname Perenna from the amnis perennis, the ever-fl owing river that had welcomed her (Fasti 3.653f.).11 According to Ovid, other accounts identifi ed her with the Moon, with Th emis, Io, with one of the daughters of Atlas, or even Hagno, a Naiad who in Arcadian myth was, together with Th eisoa and Neda, the nurse of Zeus.12 Ovid mentions fi nally the identifi cation of Anna with an old woman born in Bovillae who fed the Roman plebs when they seceded 10 Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.6 says that on this day et publice et privatim ad Annam Perennam sacrifi catum itur, ut annare perennareque commode liceat, annare referring to the entry into the new year, perennare, bringing it to a close (cf. Wissowa 1912, 241 n. 8); cf. Joh. Lydus, De mens. 4. 49 Wünsch: εὐχαὶ δημόσιαι ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὑγιεινὸν γενέσθαι τὸν ἐνιαυτόν. Th is information is truly antiquarian, since it must derive from a source prior to 153 BCE (see note 8 above). Varro however seems to have considered that they were ‘really’ two separate names, Anna ac Perenna: Sat. Menipp. frg. 506 Bücheler. D. Porte, Anna Perenna: Bonne et heureuse année?, Revue de philologie 45 (1971) 282–91. Th e post-Tiberian festival may have been moved to 18 June, the date given by the Calendar of Filocalus for the festival of Anna Perenna. Wiseman suggests that, since this was shortly aft er the cleansing of the temple of Vesta, a day oft en chosen for weddings, Anna may have shared her grove and summer festival with Priapus, to whom girls ‘off ered’ their virginity (2006, 60).11 Th e Numicius (the form Numicus also occurs) was a meandering stream in Latium that fl owed into a lake or lagoon, where Venus washed Aeneas clean of his mortal parts (e.g. Vergil, Aen. 7.150, 242; Ovid, Met. 14.596–608 with Bömer ad loc.), cf. H. Philipp, s.v. Numicius 1, RE 17 (1931) 1341. Wissowa 1894, 2224 comments acidly on the etymologising activity that led to this pseudo-history; for Wiseman it picks up, transforms and elaborates some of the underlying themes of the festival (2006, 55–59). On this river see lately G. Messineo, Corniger Numicius, in Orizzonti, VII, 2006.12 3.657–60. Th e motivation of the identifi cation with a daughter of Atlas is not clear (cf. Wernicke, s.v. Atlas, RE 2 [1896] 2120f.); the reference to Hagno however is clearly linked to the marvellous qualities of the famous pool or fountain of Hagno in Arcadia (Pausanias 8.38.2–4); see M. Jost, Sanctuaires et cultes d’Arcadie, Études peloponnésiennes 9 (Paris 1985) 245–47."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" religion and magic at rome 195to the Mons Sacer (traditional date: 494 BCE) with her country cakes (661–74). As a reward, she was granted the honour of a statue (signum Perennae). Th ese ancient interpretations suggest that there were in the Augustan period at least three diff erent places associated with the goddess: one near the Mausoleum of Augustus not far away from the Tiber bank; the marvellous Numicius in Latium; and Bovillae, reputed as a colony of Alba Longa and therefore directly associated, like the Numicius, with the earliest history of Rome.13 Farther afi eld, two items of documentary evidence have been found at opposite ends of the Italian peninsula. In 1922 a limestone altar with the simple two-line inscription Anna[e | Peren[nae was found not far from the Cathedral at Feltre, that is in the former Gallia Cis-alpina.14 And at Buscemi near Akrai in Sicily Paolo Orsi discovered several inter-communicating niches set within an architectural frame inside some caves, one of them natural, three artifi cial. Th e inscriptions were unfortunately in very bad condition, but dedications in Greek to Anna, who seems to be the central fi gure, to the Paides (“Girls” = ? Nymphs), and to Apollo could nevertheless be made out. One of them carries the date 35 CE; the others, whose lettering is similar, are also likely to be from the fi rst half of the fi rst century CE. Orsi con-jectured that the Sicilian cult of Anna Perenna might have begun in this natural cave.15Let us return to the archaeology of the fountain, below the modern Piazza Euclide. It had a very long life, from IVa–VIp.16 Th e rectangular trough was lined with opus signinum and the bottom was constructed 13 Under Augustus, the obvious resonance of Bovillae was its role as the origin of the gens Iulia (CIL XIV 2387; Suetonius, Aug. 100.2; Tacitus, Ann. 2.41). Eleven miles down the Via Appia, it was reckoned as one of the 30 members of the ancient Latin League (Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Ant. Rom. 5.61), and its representatives duly took part in the annual celebration on the Mons Albanus. A relevant connection with Rome is the existence at Bovillae of Vestal Virgins, said originally to have been from Alba Longa (CIL XIV 2410).14 AE 1925: 82 = SupplIt 5 F 1 = T.

It may have continued to be used in some form into the medieval period (XIIp)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"196  marina  piranomonteof bipedales. Th e late-antique revetment was built, as I have mentioned, of rough opus vittatum, but there are traces, largely destroyed by the piling for the garage, of a much earlier one in opus reticulatum. Four lead fi stulae pass through the trough, presumably deriving from dif-ferent periods of use; they indicate that the spring also supplied water to some other hydraulic facility further down the valley. Th e fountain was a krene, a type very common all over Greece and Asia Minor, with the water from a concealed cistern debouching through a spout into a basin or trough: there are, for example, many representations on Greek vases depicting women (and men) drawing water from such fountains; the spouts oft en had the form of animal, especially lion, protomai.17It is however the fi nds in the cistern that most concern us here. It is clear that the water from the spring continued to fl ow into the cis-tern long aft er the shrine was given up or closed down in the late IVp or early Vp, and deposited the layers of clay and sand that preserved the contents perfectly in a quasi-anaerobic environment. Th ese fi nds include 549 coins, 74 oil-lamps, 22 randomly-scattered curse-tablets, 18 cylindrical containers made of lead-sheet, some containing poppets (anthropomorphic fi gurines), 3 containers made of clay, a large cop-per-alloy pot or bucket (caccabus) with traces of use on a fi re, seven pine cones, egg-shells, twigs and a number of small plaques made of diff erent kinds of wood. Given the context, a cistern constantly fi lled with water, it is diffi cult to organise the materials chronologically. Deposits such as this in springs, fountains and nymphaea are common enough. Leaving aside the issue of magical practice for the moment, such locations, whether sacred to a named deity or the anonymous nymphs (or, as in our case, both), are obvious transit-points between two worlds, and thus tend to be specially favoured for symbolic and specifi cally religious action. In our case, it seems that the nymphs were of particular interest. Despite the dominant poetic tradition, which off ers a reassuring image of them as harmless, happy beings venerated near springs and rivers, the personifi cation of waters, 17 For example, the IVa fountain below the temple of Athena at Priene, cf. A.W. Lawrence, Greek Architecture (Harmondsworth 1957) 236 with pl. 114b; cf. Larson 2001, 10; 26. Th ere are about 50 Attic black-fi gure hydriai showing images of women collecting water from such fountains surviving from the period 530–500 BCE alone, cf. E. (Zwierlein-)Diehl, Die Hydria: Formgeschichte und Verwendung im Kult des Alter-tums (Mainz 1964) 230 T259; a nice example illustrated in E. Simon, Die griechischen Vasen (Munich 1976) pl. XXX."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" religion and magic at rome 197in Greek religion they are chiefl y deities of the untamed or partially tamed landscape, with a particular association with pastoral or rus-tic gods, notably Dionysus, the silens, and Pan (Larsen 2001, 91–96). Although in the Classical period the nymphs’ infl uence on individuals was seen as positive, a heightening of awareness and verbal skill (e.g. Plato makes Socrates declare himself νυμφόληπτος, inspired, by the nymphs of the Ilissus, by whose banks he and Phaedrus are sitting),18 in the post-classical period they become more sinister: nympholepsy is a dangerous and unwelcome mental state, connoting loss of self-restraint, abduction or even disappearance and death (Larsen 2001, 66–72). Nymphs incarnate a dangerous and anomalous femininity oft en synonymous with premature death; seductive and dangerous, they lie in wait for attractive boys or men, and then drown them; we may think of the young Hylas, drowned by one (or three) nymphs at a spring as he fetched water.19 Very oft en their nature is semi-wild, hidden inside an alluring body; it is the water itself that facilitates the passage between their two natures.20 All these associations, which are really so many stories about the special nature of springs and foun-tains as transition-points, made springs reputedly inhabited by the Nymphs seem attractive for religious purposes, especially instrumen-tal ones (i.e. requests for help, healing, fecundity etc.). Th e fact that the fountain of Anna Perenna and her nymphs came to be used also as a transit-point for malign messages to the other world (i.e. defi x-iones) over a period of a century or more cannot therefore surprise us, though in fact there are no examples of defi xiones addressed to them in the eastern Mediterranean, and only one earlier case in Italy, an Arretine example dating to IIp, addressed to the Aquae ferventes, siv[e v]os Nimfas [si]ve quo alio nomine voltis adpel[l]ari, and found in 1869 together with coin deposits in the iron-rich spring of Poggio 18 Plato, Phaedr. 238d; on the Classical view, see W.R. Connor, Seized by the Nymphs: Nympholepsy and Symbolic Expression in Classical Greece, ClAnt 7 (1988) 155–89.19 Apollonius Rhodius, Argon. 1.1228–39; Th eocritus, Idyll 13.43–50. Bormos the Mariandynian is another case in point (Nymphis ap. FGrH 432 F5b). Note also the girl drowned some way up the Via Nomentana, part of whose epitaph reads: νύμφαι κρηναῖαι με συνήρπασαν ἐκ βιότοιο: IG XIV 2067 (not in IGUR).20 Moreover, in the classical imaginaire plunging people or objects into water was a typical motif in tales involving a shift of status: L.

Sebas-tiano, and was understood by Wünsch as an epithet of Osiris (= deus Ephydrias deus Nymphaeus Aidoneus), as representing an original invocation of the Nymphs: ὑμεῖς δέ, ἐφυδριάδες νύμφαι, ἀϊδώναιαι, ἔγχωροι κατοικοῦσαι, “You watery Nymphs, of the Underworld, who dwell in this place”.22 Th is perfectly suits the assumptions underly-ing the practice at the Fountain of Anna Perenna. Wünsch plausibly dated the 50–odd ‘Sethian’ texts around 390–420 CE, somewhat later than ours; it is however quite uncertain whether there was in fact a spring in the vicinity of the fi nd-spot of these defi xiones, reportedly found in the ash-urns of a columbarium “nella prima vigna a mano sinistra uscendo dalla Porta S. Sebastiano” (i.e. the vigna Marini).23 As is shown by the initial word in most of the Greek texts, ΛΟ(γος), the formula is clearly copied from a previous document. If Jordan’s sug-gestion is correct, there must have been other appeals to the nymphs for malign ends, which are now lost.Th e FindsMy task here is simply to provide a brief overview of the material recovered, in order to provide a context for the detailed commentary on the defi xiones in Latin by Jürgen Blänsdorf that immediately fol-lows this contribution. For the sake of proper contextualisation, how-ever, I fi rst present the three inscriptions, which seem to provide some corrective to Ovid’s account of the celebrations at the March festival of Anna Perenna. 21 CIL XI 1823 = ILS 8748 = DTAud no. 129; for the date, cf.

Th e inscriptionsTh e marble altar and two votive bases were built into the late-antique retaining wall of the trough and evidently stem from an earlier phase of the shrine.24 Th e fountain, or the enclosure around it, must have been damaged and the votives that once stood on the bases removed. Th is fi nal arrangement was presumably intended to restore dignity to the place, which was no doubt still much visited.Th e fi rst text (AE 2003: 251) is inscribed on a marble base dedicated by a freedman to the nymphs of Anna Perenna on the occasion of a victory in some competition by his patronus C. Acilius Eutyches. Th e text, addressed to the Nymphae sacratae rather than to Anna Perenna herself, contains fi ve lines of iambic senarii, followed by a ‘signature’. On the stone it is laid out thus:Votum sacratis quondam | Nymphis feceram, | boni patroni meritis ob victoriam | C. Acili Eutychetis reddimus | et esse sanctas | confi temur versibus | aramque gratis | dedicamus fontibus. | Eutychides lib(ertus).Th e vow (which) once I had made to the consecrated nymphs, who deserved it because of the victory of my good patron C. Acilius Euty-ches, we pay; and we attest in verse that they are sacred, and we dedicate an altar to the welcome springs. Eutychides the freedman.25Sacratae here means that the nymphs have a cult dedicated to them at this spot; they are the essence of the spring, the divine beings who cause it to fl ow without drying up. Before considering the type of com-petition that may have been involved, to which the metre is obviously a key, we need to look at the other two texts, which are closely related to one another and evidently refer to the same occasion. Th e more important is a fi ne marble altar (Pl. 7), with balusters and rosette-fi nials, and a patera and culter on the (damaged) tympanum. Th e text (AE 2003: 252) reads:24 Cf. F.W.

Suetonius Germ[anu]s | Nymphis sacra[tis] | Annae Perennae d(ono) d(edit).27One hypothesis based on Ovid’s account might be that the allusion is to a competition to see who could drink the most cups of wine. Th at the consumption of wine played a role at the shrine is suggested by the discovery of two miniature kyathoi (wine ladles) at the mouth of the spring, which might be connected with libations and so merry-mak-ing.28 But Eutychides’ iambic senarii (the metre of comedy) and the joint vow by Germanus and his wife Licinia surely render it more likely that the victory was in one of the competitions in singing, mime and poetry-recitation that were held on the Ides. Friggeri and Wiseman link the performances to the dramatisations of cult-myth that were a common feature of Roman ludi publici; the accounts of Ovid and Silius Italicus imply a drama of “wandering, search, epiphany” in the cult of Anna Perenna (2006, 57). I do not think we necessarily need follow them in this suggestion, but there can be little doubt that the mid-second century festival was more highly organized, and per-haps more formal, than the popular one described by Ovid around 8 CE (granted that a poet such as Ovid is not in any sense a neutral reporter). Probably, the loss of importance of the archaic cult could 26 Friggeri ibid. 29–32.27 My text here, as in Piranomonte 2001, 60f., diff ers slightly from that given by Friggeri and AE (2006, 51), both of whom omit Germanus’ praenomen. Wiseman 2006, 51 n. 2 admits the possibility of two alternative translations, 1) assuming the ellipse of et between sacratis and Annae, so that the latter would be dative not geni-tive, and the votive made to her and the nymphs jointly; 2) understanding sacratis as governing Annae Perennae, so that the nymphs would be ‘consecrated to Anna Perenna’. 28 For the kyathoi, see Piranomonte and Ricci 2009."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" religion and magic at rome 201have caused the shift of the celebration from the building of the Audi-torium to the sole fountain of Piazza Euclide. If so, the new inscrip-tions help to relativise the suggestion, underscored by the concluding narrative to explain the girls’ singing of naughty songs (Fasti 3.675–96), that the festival was entirely devoted to drunken fun.2. Th e coinsSome 549 coins were found, almost all in the deeper strata of the cis-tern, attesting to the practice of throwing money into water as a sign of devotion to the resident nymph(s) or deity. Th e coins in the foun-tain are all imperial, extending from Augustus to Th eodosius; there are no Republican coins. Even the imperial coins however are grouped in periods rather than being evenly distributed over the entire contin-uum: in the High Empire, they cluster in the reigns of Domitian and Trajan, then of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus; and fi nally Aurelian; in the Late Roman period, the reigns of Constantius II, Julian, Valens, Valentinian II and Th eodosius, that is, the second and fi nal thirds of IVp. Th e fact that the series begins with Augustus helps to confi rm that the fountain may have been cleaned out in the reign of Augustus.29 Th e last datable coin is a bronze with the legend Salus reipublicae issued by the mint at Rome between 388 and 393 CE.30 One possibility is that the shrine was closed in accordance with Th eodosius’ edicts of 16 June 391 and 8 Nov. 392 CE obliging the citizens of the Empire to abandon the pagan cults.31 It must however be remembered that this was also the period of the Gothic raids, and of marked, if temporary, population shrinkage.3229 I have already pointed out that there were traces of older walls in opus reticu-latum abutting the fountain that had unfortunately been destroyed by the building works. Th is however only provides a terminus post-quem in Iª.30 Th is is a common coin, found in many hoards in the western Empire, cf.

Pine-cones and egg shellsSeven pine-cones and a number of fragmentary egg-shells were also found in the cistern. Th e Istituto Centrale del Restauro has proved there were no pine-trees growing nearby or in the nemus. We may therefore infer that the cones were thrown into the cistern as simple gift s or for good luck. Eggs too were associated with fertility.40 5. Th e caccabusAmong the objects found in the cistern was a fl at-bottomed, ribbed cauldron, 25 cm in diameter, made of copper-alloy, with a handle of twisted iron wire simply pushed through holes in the lip. It bears marks of fi re on the bottom surface, so had evidently been used for some kind of cooking, or preparing recipes with herbs (like the Nymphs of Nitrodi on Ischia) presumably during sacrifi ces at the shrine.416. Finds that can be associated with magical practiceIn view of the diff erences between them in date, orthography and language-use, it is clear that the remaining items recovered from the cistern, that is the defi xiones and the 18 cylindrical containers, can-not all be associated with the activities of a single professional prac-titioner in the mid-late IVp. Moreover, among the lamps found, six contained small, carefully-rolled defi xiones that had been fi tted into their nozzles, which is clearly a quite diff erent strategy of deposition, one much more in keeping with the traditional off erings in the cistern (two other lamps contained a coin).42 Nevertheless, the originality of 40 For the reconstruction of the sacred wood of Anna Perenna see A.

Th e defi xionesApart from the defi xiones in the lamps, however, we found sixteen others scattered in the basin. Th e total of new texts therefore is twenty-two; of these twenty are made of lead-sheet (four are fragmentary) and two of pure hammered copper. According to Prof. Blänsdorf, the Latin texts are to be dated to the mid-late IVp, though one at least appears to be dated to II–IIIp; at any rate they seem to be somewhat earlier than the Porta S. Sebastiano deposit. However the two series are faintly con-nected, since both Seth and the black Bull of Heliopolis, Mnevis, seem to be invoked at both sites, albeit only once at the fountain of Anna Perenna.43 Th is implies that, with the increasingly dominant public presence of Christianity in Rome, the cistern’s traditional role as a votive site, attested by the earlier coins and the II–IIIp text, was inten-sifi ed; Christian identifi cation of pagan divinities as ‘demons’ made it seem plausible to treat the Nymphs as somehow ‘underground’ and therefore especially competent in relation to malign magic.44 For detailed information on the texts mainly in Latin, and their dating, I can refer to Prof. Blänsdorf ’s article immediately following.6.2. Th e containers and the fi gurines Th e most remarkable fi nd in the cistern however was the 18 lead and 3 terracotta containers with lead lids. Th e former were made of lead-sheet of varying thickness. All were hermetically sealed, in some cases Lamps are elsewhere found in the contexts of amatory, and divinatory magic, e.g. Apuleius, Met. 2.11 (with 2.13; the lamp in 3.21 is irrelevant here).43 See Blänsdorf no. 3 (pp. 218, 232 below). Although many of Wünsch’s texts do illustrate Seth as a horse-headed deity, the name ‘Sethian’ is more or less completely unfounded, being based on Wünsch’s mistaken idea that the Porta S. Sebastiano texts were ‘Gnostic’ (Wünsch 1898, 74; 95f.); if anything, they should be known as ‘Osirian’; cf. Mastrocinque 2005, 49–51.44 Th e continued off ering of Warzenlampen, however, suggests that this negative use was fairly short-lived."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" religion and magic at rome 205with a special sealing material, or by compressing the cylinder-wall against the rim of the lid, so that they could not be opened and the contents removed. All the metal containers consisted in fact of three cylinders placed one inside the other, but constructed in diff erent ways: sometimes the smallest was dropped into the middle-sized one, which was in turn dropped into the largest one (like Russian dolls), all with the mouth uppermost, and a single lid provided for all three (Pl. 9). Alternatively, the innermost container might have its own lid (Pl. 10); or be closed off simply by being turned upside down. I hardly need remind the reader of the special quality of the number three, since it appears so frequently in folk-magic.45 Th e forensic technicians who were asked to analyze the fi ngerprints preserved on the resins used to seal one of the containers inclined to think they were a woman’s prints on grounds of their small size. However, before we jump to the conclu-sion that it was a professional sorceress who performed her magic by our fountain at Piazza Euclide (cf. Faraone 2003), we should remem-ber not only that several diff erent hands wrote the Latin defi xiones that have up to now been deciphered but also that they are written in diff erent forms of Latin, some close to Classical, others heavily marked by Vulgar and late forms, implying that they were written, as we might expect, by people of diff erent levels of education. Taken together, the fi nds suggest that some individuals opted for what was, over a period, acknowledged to be the most elaborate, expensive and eff ective means of cursing a target (or requesting aid/blessing), namely the triple canister; whereas others chose the cheaper vehicle of the lamp with (a) leaden wick(s); and still others did not record their wishes in writing at all. On the other hand, although most of the texts are in Latin, many do use charakteres, albeit unsophisticated ones, and drawings of daemones, all of which seems to indicate a certain level of professional expertise—though much lower than that displayed by the author(s) of the Porta S. Sebastiano texts. At any rate, it seems quite clear that there was a single ‘major’ practitioner at work. Six of the 18 canisters contain crude poppets (fi gurines) made of organic material, wax, fl our, sugars, herbs and liquid substances such 45 E.g. E.

Numerous ancient poppets in lead and other metals, such as copper-alloy and bronze, and in clay or mud, baked or unbaked, have survived in diff erent contexts; late-antique poppets made of wax have been found in Egypt, and there is no doubt that they were very common, perhaps the commonest type.47 Such poppets had a variety of functions. As is well known, Plato assumes that they could be left in ‘signifi cant’ places such as doorways, crossroads or tombs to serve as warnings to individuals that someone was out to attack them (Laws 9, 933b2f.). Faraone argued that they were mainly used to disable opponents (temporarily) in legal disputes. Other sources refer to their use in ‘love magic’ to represent the target person(s) to be aff ected by the spell.48 None of the Latin texts that have been deciphered are clearly amatory; many are certainly malign. In my view, the containers served in the latter cases deictically to ‘isolate’ the target, to cancel his social and moral integrity, to express the fact that he has been ‘caught’ by magical attack and is never to escape—the tossing of the sealed canister into the cistern makes clear that, just as it can never be recovered, so the target is never to be free. A further interesting feature of the organic poppets is that, as has been revealed by X-rays, all of them were formed around slivers of (animal-) bone. In two cases, the bones have fallen out, thus revealing that they too were inscribed.49 One of the erotic recipes in PGrMag calls for the 46 Th e analyses were performed by the Instituto Centrale del Restauro.47 See Faraone 1991, 200–05 (Appendix), listing 38 cases/groups, a fi gure now out of date thanks to the fi nds at Mainz and in the Fountain; 1992; Ogden 1999, 71–79. 48 E.g.

A wax poppet (inv. no.

Like the Greek elements of these defi xiones, and the images they contain, this detail invites speculation about the modes of distribution of such relatively learned and inventive magical practice.6.3. Symbolic resourcefulnessTo complete this brief report, I propose to discuss the construction and design of one or two of the containers in more detail. Th e obvious parallel is with the now well-known late Va/early IVa poppets found in the 1950s by J. Trumpf and Barbara Schlörb-Vierneisel in tombs in the Kerameikos at Athens.51 Th ese were of lead, and placed in small rounded lidded caskets, also made of lead. Both components were inscribed. Th e idea of enclosing poppets in containers thus occurred, so far as we know, spontaneously both in late fi ft h-century BCE Athens and in fourth-century CE Rome. In keeping with the technical prog-ress over the intervening seven and a half centuries, however, the latter are far more sophisticated constructions. Likewise considerable inge-nuity has gone into the selection of symbolically-eff ective actions that contributed to the ritual ‘catching’ of the target. 6.3.1. I have already referred to the triple container we identify as inv. 475549 (Pl. 10), made of three cylinders hermetically sealed with natu-ral resins. Th e innermost of these contained a very interesting poppet, made of organic matter, which was partly enclosed by a lead-sheet with two nails driven through it at the level of the poppet’s midriff and lower legs (Pl. 12). Th is sheet is inscribed with Greek letters and cha-rakteres, including a Θ (perhaps the sign for ‘deceased’), and a human mask with one of the nails driven through it (Pl. 13). Th e most strik-ing and original feature of the ensemble, however, is the snake that 50 PGrMag IV.1873–1901 with Raven 1983, 17. Th e bone belongs of course to a member of the class ‘restless dead’.51 J. Trumpf, Fluchtafel und Rachepuppe, MDAI(A) 73 (1958 [1962]) 94–102; B.

As Blänsdorf points out in another connection, snakes are associated with Osiris and the Underworld, but here no doubt it simply images the idea of a horrible and painful death.52 Th e symbolism of this ensemble thus makes use of one of the most familiar features of magical texts, repetition as a fi gure of insistence. In other words, it says the same thing again and again and again. Th e poppet is enclosed in a lead tablet, it has been penetrated by two nails, a face presumably denoting the target has been disfi gured, it bears the sign of death (if that is what the Θ signifi es), it has been ‘caught’ by the charakteres, and confi ned in a small container. Th is in turn has been sealed with resin, engraved with a curse, and placed fi rst into one, then into another larger cylinder, which were also sealed. Th e ensemble was then ‘drowned’ in the murky cistern from where it could never be recovered; subjectively even more important to the practitioner, how-ever, was its ritual transfer to the powers of the spring.53 6.3.2. At least two other triple ensembles make use of the image of a cock-headed deity (with human feet), whose body bears charakteres or possibly a cryptic name or numbers. Th is seems to bear out my inference that at least one of the people who manufactured the triple ensembles in the cistern knew, or at least convinced himself that he knew, something about Graeco-Egyptian methods. (a) Inv. no. 475558 (= Blänsdorf no. 2 below) proved to contain not a poppet but an inscribed sliver of bone and a fragment of parch-ment (still unread). Th e inner container appears to have been re-used because there is evidence of it having been inscribed at diff erent points all over the outer surface.54 Th ese texts can only be read when the con-tainer is held upside-down. Th e most interesting image is of a crude bird or bird-man, whose body has been enlarged to carry the following letters or charakteres (Pl. 14):52 Cf. Blänsdorf on his no. 7, p. 226 below.53 However, the name of the target has not (yet) been read on the container.54 Two of the other inner containers proved to be engraved; I think this indicates that they were intended to function more or less as defi xiones."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" religion and magic at rome 209Line 1: I X N Π o XLine 2: X N K Θ Θ Θ(b) Th e smallest container of inv. no. 475558 carries a very similar image, but in this case the letters or charakteres are more legible: Line 1: I X N O Π Line 2: X N K Θ Line 3: Θ ΘTh is iconography vaguely resembles that of Iao, the cock-headed, anguipede god, who normally holds a whip and a shield.55 A similar fi gure elsewhere (Pl. 15) in fact holds an object in its right hand, which might represent a shield (or whip).

Th is type of Graeco-Egyptian imagery is surely more likely to lie behind the cock-deity than the Cock-headed anguipede, normally associated with protection.57 Since the name of the victim, Leontius, is spelled out beside the god or dae-mon in the fi rst ensemble (a; see Pl. 14), it is clear that he is the one who is imagined as responsible for carrying out the curse.58Th e Greek characters ΑΒΛΑΝΑΘΑΝΑΛΒΑ are clearly recognizable against the head of the cock-headed god or daemon in inv. no. 475539.55 For the various types, see Michel 2004, 239–49 no. 3A; cf.

Finally, I want just to illustrate a suggestive detail from the most interesting, and tantalizing, of the images on the defi xiones proper (inv. no. 475567), of which the reader will fi nd a complete drawing in Prof. Blänsdorf ’s paper (Text-fi g. 3, to his no. 7). Th e central rhom-bus (= symbol of vagina?) of this enigmatic design depicts a limbless, apparently female, fi gure wearing a crown, a mark of divinity (Pl. 18). We cannot tell who she is, but I would very much like her to be Anna Perenna herself, the titular deity of the fountain.ConclusionGiven the lack of close comparanda, the detailed interpretation of the fi nds in the cistern of Anna Perenna is a work in progress for me and my colleague Blänsdorf. Th e matter is made more diffi cult by the late date of the most interesting fi nds, which I have briefl y described in §6: by the mid-fourth century, the relatively coherent rules of composi-tion were being fl exibly reformed to generate new options and pos-sibilities. We would very much like to be able to provide a convincing identity for the cock-deity or demon. Th e palindrome Ablanathana-lba might conceivably point to the Anguipede, invoked together with the other vox magica to reinforce the curse. Again, how are we to understand the letters or charakteres on the deity’s belly, which seem, from repeated autopsy, in all three cases to be the same? Following a suggestion by Perea Yébenes, I now incline to think they might be intended as numbers. Taken as such, the letters I X N O Π / X N K Θ Θ Θ would give a sum of 1457 (line 1: 760; line 2, 697). Th e occurrence of the divine name Seth and the sacred bull Mnu = Mnevis (Blänsdorf no. 3), if we accept the hypothesis, not only reveals that the Nymphs were not the sole addressees at the spring but throws up questions about the relationship between magical practice here and the later Porta S. Sebastiano texts. Prof. Blänsdorf ’s discovery that the names Blobes and Irilesus in his Text 7 (inv. no. 475567) are genuinely Egyptian, and genuinely connected with the subject of the curse, also seems to have implications for the ‘Sethian’ texts, with the startling possibility of continuing access to written Graeco-Egyptian formularies (see p. 225).

As Marina Piranomonte has explained in the preceding contribution to this volume, Ovid gives us a brief but vivid account of her annual festival then held by the river Tiber in the Cam-pus Martius.1 He offers two different aetiologies: how Anna, the sister of Dido, became one of the nymphs of the river Numicius; and the rather frivolous tale of Anna of Bovillae.2 A little further information is offered by other authors.3 None of these texts, however, gave us any clue to the religious basis of the cult of the nymphs or of how the cult developed over time. The discovery of the nymphaeum or ‘fountain’ of Anna Perenna beneath Piazza Euclide in the Parioli district of mod-ern Rome has now shown that the spring was in use even before the Republican period (ceramic evidence), and continued to be used until Vp, while on present evidence the cult of Anna Perenna was celebrated there for several centuries, with some apparent interruptions, until the late IVp.4 During the later imperial period the fountain was also used as a place to perform, or complete, magic rituals, in this case the bind-ing of named individuals by means of ritual acts (sacrifices) and writ-ten curses on lead, the wide-spread technique of defixiones. In view of Piranomonte’s presentation of the archaeology of the site and the finds in the cistern, my task here is simply to present the read-ings of the Latin texts that I have managed to arrive at so far, together 1 Ovid, Fasti 3.523–542.

In all, the cistern yielded twenty-one texts on metal-sheet, including fourteen on lead and two on cop-per.5 Like those found at Aquae Sulis/Bath in Britain, they had been deposited in the water together with other offerings during or after the ritual.6 In November 2004, on the occasion of a congress on “Pro-fessional Sorcerers and their Wares in Imperial Rome: An Archaeol-ogy of Magical Practices” organised in Rome by Christopher Faraone, Marina Piranomonte, who had already managed to read two, offered me the chance of studying the remaining Latin texts.7 In this contribu-tion, I publish her two readings and my readings of six further texts, mainly in Latin. The rest are still in the process of being unfolded or cleaned in order to be made legible. The form, language and contents of the texts vary, but there is insuf-ficient information to enable us to construct a relative chronology.8 Nineteen of the inscriptions are written exclusively in Latin; two offer a curious mixture of Latin and Greek. Seven are accompanied by drawings and magical letters (charakteres). Two of the texts are of special interest because they refer explicitly to the sacred place or its nymphs. In keeping with R.S.O. Tomlin’s practice in TabSulis, it has seemed advisable to present the texts of the eight new documents in the Appendix, each with a brief technical commentary. In the main part of my contribution, I offer some general remarks on each in the order in which they are presented in the Appendix. It is important to remem-ber that the order in which the texts are arranged is not by date but proceeds from the most elementary type to the most complex.91. Let us begin with the simplest form of defixio, by name alone. The obverse of Text no. 1 (inv. no. 475561) shows the name Antonius writ-5 Some of the containers that have not yet been opened may carry inscriptions. I have received a photo of a circular inscription written on the bottom of the inner-most container of one of the triple-ensembles (inv.-nr. 475539), mentioning the name Quirinus Pistor. Much of the lettering is unfortunately very faint.6 M. Henig et al. in B Cunliffe (ed.), The Temple of Sulis Minerva at Bath, 2: The Finds from the Sacred Spring. Oxford University Committee for Archaeology, Mono-graph no. 16 (Oxford 1988) 5–53 at 5; Tomlin 1988, 102f.7 The proceedings of the conference were published in MHNH 5 (2005) 7–123.8 The letter-forms are fairly similar to those of the Abinnaeus-archive dated 344 CE; cf. Seider 1972–81, 1: nos. 49–52. Those of Vp are significantly different. 9 To decipher many of the texts, I used a specially-focused light and the binocular microscope of the laboratory of the Museo Nazionale Romano."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" the texts from the fons annae perennae 217ten in neat majuscule letters. Beneath it is a roughly-drawn figure with the name Antonius written on the body and the two first syllables, AN/TO, between its legs.10 The drawing obviously represents the target. Most of the late-antique defixiones from the Porta S. Sebastiano edited by Richard Wünsch in 1898 have drawings of the targets identified by their agnomina or sobriquets.11 The name Antonius recurs on the verso in jumbled form. The writer may have been barely literate, first practising the name on one side, and then turning the tablet over to write it out again together with the drawing. Even so, he evidently knew something of the appropriate procedures to follow and the type of drawing required. 2. The second text (inv. no. 475558), as Piranomonte has stated (p. 209 above), was inscribed on one of the small lead containers, and can only be read when it is placed upside-down—perhaps one of the many symbols of the perverted world of malign magic. In this case, the name Le/ont/ius is written in majuscule immediately beside a daemon with a bird’s head, cock’s comb and arms (the one on the spectator’s right might also be a cock’s tail: see Plate 14).12 On other containers, the cock apparently represent the god Iao/Abrasax, invoked as Ablana-thanalba (see following note). On its body are eleven majuscule letters that cannot be interpreted as a word (see p. 209 above). So they are obviously charakteres. To the left of this group are some more traces of letters, among which IVS can be made out. I take it they are trial versions rather than evidence for re-use of the container. Although there is no explicit curse-text here, the writer’s intention seems clear enough: Leontius is to be taken by the daemon, in other words, he is to die.In Text 1, therefore, the drawing denotes the target, in Text 2, the daemon invoked. It is thus clear that figures depicted on these defix-iones may indicate either possibility. In the following examples, how-ever, the relation of text and image is more difficult to interpret. 10 See the drawing in Piranomonte 2005, 98 fig. 12.11 Wünsch 1898, with the remarks of Preisendanz 1926, 17ff. and the discussion by Mastrocinque 2005.12 Above the name Leontius is an unfinished bird’s head; the left arm of the daemon may also have been inserted between this and the name Leontius."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"218  jürgen  blänsdorf3. Inv. no. 475549 is very well preserved because it was the inner-most of three containers. The surface of the metal is smooth and pol-ished. A male figure has been incised on the lower wall, wearing what looks like a helmet or crown (Plate 20). A series of curved lines on his body may perhaps be interpreted as the circlets of a cuirass (the figure was immediately dubbed “il gladiatore”) or perhaps a charioteer. There are texts in late-antique minuscule on either side. In the first line to the left, the letters SETE are clearly visible. I interpret this as the name of the Egyptian god Seth, in the vocative. Below it we read MNU, an approximation to one of the ritual names of the deceased Mnevis-bull, identified with Osiris. Below that again we find the late minuscule form of the letter S—which is the same in the Latin and the Greek scripts of this period—and below it an uncertain letter. I think these are to be taken together and interpreted as a Greek abbreviation of Seth (ΣΗΘ), spelled without the vowel and serving to reinforce or specify the Latin. As many of the Roman and North-African defix-iones show, magical practitioners were often bilingual in Roman times. Since the name Seth is written twice, once in the vocative, I suppose the figure represents this god, not his victim. If I am right, it is notable that a god not worshipped in the sanctuary of Anna Perenna could be invoked there. That implies that the local deity had nothing against a demand for help to another (foreign) god; it was the sacred site itself that granted the requisite ritual efficacy.13The two lines on the right-hand side of the helmeted figure are to be read as DECEN/TIAS. This can be interpreted in at least three ways: 1) as the acc. pl. of a feminine noun decentia meaning ‘what is appropri-ate’. However it is unclear how we should then understand the refer-ence: is it to the fact that the defixio has been properly performed by its author? or to the appropriate punishment of the target, whose name is anyway missing?; and why the accusative? 2) We might read decent ias (= eas). That would imply that Seth and another person—why not Mnu?—are appropriate to some female persons; 3) Decentia might be a well-attested woman’s name. But again, why is it in the acc. plur.?14Although Seth seems to be invoked in this text, I think it unlikely that we should take it as belonging directly to the Porta S. Sebastiano 13 In 2008, I was able to read the name Abrax[as] followed by Abl[lanathanalba?] on another of these texts (inv. no. 475564).14 The name Decentia has now been deciphered on inv. no. 475539 (see commentary)."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" the texts from the fons annae perennae 219group (which Wünsch wrongly dubbed ‘Sethian’ curses, Sethianische Verfluchungen). It is clearly different from these in its extreme brevity; the lack of long repeated formulae; the absence of nomina magica, and perhaps of the name of the target. I have even found myself wonder-ing whether an oral curse may not have been substituted in this case for a written one; or even whether it might not be a defixio at all but a request for something positive, a victory for instance. However, Seth is only invoked in such texts in a malign context. Moreover the entire context, the triple container, the poppet it contained, and the sliver of bone bearing letters or signs now too faint to be read, tends to confirm the assumption that the intention was to harm or kill someone.4. The fourth text too (inv. no. 475721) does not quite fit into the usual type of Roman defixiones, since it apparently combines a list with an injunction or invocation. It was written with a very sharp stylus on very thin lead sheet in an unusually tall and slim majuscule script up to 8mm high.15 The right-hand side of the tablet is broken off, but the original overall dimensions can be inferred from the missing four let-ters of the name Fortun[atus. It seems to begin with a list of names of the targets in the nominative. The first line is difficult, because after initial NE there is a magic symbol probably hiding an O; the rest seems to read ΦILAṂ (or Ṇ). However no such name is attested. Neverthe-less the end of the line must conceal a name ending in -us, since VS appears at the beginning of l. 2. Following on from this, l. 3 clearly reads ET SEBERUS, with the change from v to b that is typical of late Latin. When I studied the text at Rome, I read in l. 3 LOCVS SAN(ctus), which I took to refer to the sanctuary and perhaps to the ritual act performed there. But the drawing subsequently made by D. Rosati has LOCUIS CAN[. . .]. Locuis could be a Vulgar form of loqui; but CAN[ seems impossible. Ll. 5f. remain unintelligible. Conjectures would be welcome.5. The fifth text (inv. no. 475722) refers more certainly to the sanctu-ary. The letters are 4–6 mm high and resemble the uncial alphabet of Late Antiquity. They are easy to read, but the fragments are too small to permit a reliable estimate of the overall dimensions of the tablet and 15 As regards the orthography, the inscription is certainly late-antique, but the form of the letters would suggest a fairly early date within that period."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"220  jürgen  blänsdorfthe inscribed area. I can make no sense of ll. 1 and 2. In the remainder, there is no evident indication of malign intention, and ROGAT in l. 3 might indicate a prayer. In ll. 3–4 the request or demand is expressed in the form of a comparative clause: ut ille te[---]/ rogat, but the gram-matical object is missing. At the beginning of l. 5, XOREAM might be read as uxor eam or as the adjective uxoream. So the text may refer to a husband talking about what his wife has done to another female person, or, if we suppose uxoream rem, saying something about her affairs (or a lawsuit). In l. 6 the best conjecture for FITEATUR is [con]fiteatur. In the remainder of l. 6, FEM must represent some form of femina, no doubt referring to one of the women just mentioned—his wife or the other person. At the beginning of l. 7, my initial reading was ΝΤΑΙ, which I guessed might be part of a Greek verb such as τιμωροῦνται. Danilo Rosati’s drawing however shows the reading is in fact -ntas. If taken as a noun, we could conjecture voluntas or, less probably, iuventas. But in defixiones the word voluntas always refers to the principal’s demands, not a god’s. There seems to be no suitable adjective to fit the context;16 and anyway the order adj. + noun is not usual in later Latin. The most plausible conjecture is thus a form of one of the lexical cluster cantare, decantare, excantare or occentare (this latter being the oldest term for a magical charm: Cicero, De rep. 4.12). The sense may be that a third party (or the target) had invoked the nymphs of the fountain, since the following word NIMFA clearly refer to them. These nymphs are apparently invoked again in l. 8, RO[GO] VO[S, and it seems probable that the principal is directing a prayer to the nymphs of the sanctuary, analogous to the inscriptions on the votive altar and bases built into the revetment of the trough, which thank Anna and her nymphs for help vouchsafed (see p. 199 above). Several of the Porta S. Sebastiano texts invoke the nymphs besides Seth, Osiris and other gods, but here they are invoked as the inhabitants of the sanctuary of Anna Perenna.17The letter L in the last line (l. 9) shows that it is in Latin. It is unclear how the previous five letters VO/BON[ are to be construed. I think bon[ might be an invocation of a good deity; the same sequence of letters is to be found in Text 8, l. 4: bona, but probably with a different significance.16 I have considered quintas, quingentas, tantas, attentas, contentas, cruentas, remu-lentas, vinolentas. Amina Kropp convincingly suggests [sa]n(c)tas.17 See the citations in Piranomonte above (p. 198 n. 21)."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" the texts from the fons annae perennae 2216. This item concerns the three tiny sheets of lead (inv. no. 475565), of irregular shape, but complete, which were found in a lamp (inv. no. 445018). As Piranomonte emphasises (p. 202), oil-lamps are a very common type of votive gift. The deposition of the tablets in a lamp was therefore certainly part of an occasional magic ritual. Although the letters are very difficult to read because of the heavy corrosion of the surface, the texts clearly belong to a well-known type of Roman defixio. Each sheet is inscribed on both sides and carries three or four lines of late Roman cursive letters and charakteres—mostly N and X—in the form of ‘ring-letters’ (Ringbuchstaben), and N and ω with lines above it, mostly repeated four times. Compared with the Porta S. Sebastiano texts, the design is rather poor. One line is repeated with minor variations in two of the texts: Victor quem pep-erit Pria[. . .]alluia and Victor quem peperit Pell[.]ta. As is well known, many of the defixiones of imperial date from Egypt, Africa Proconsu-laris and Byzacena, and the later examples from Rome itself, identify the target by means of his personal name and that of his mother.18 The various letters that can be read on the reverse make no sense. I have not yet been able to decipher the third tablet because of the extensive corrosion of the surface; it is possible that the grounds for the curse, which is always given in the Porta S. Sebastiano texts, may have appeared there.7. In many ways no. 7 (inv. no. 475567) is the most interesting of these texts: it is complete, has the most sophisticated drawing, the longest text, the most cruel punishment; and explicitly refers to the Nymphs of the sanctuary. Let us begin with the drawing (Text-fig. 3).A rough lateral frame is provided by four snake-like animals, joined in the middle and facing towards the centre. All have prominent eyes. The animals pointing upwards are opening their mouths or beaks; the one at top left has a sort of mane or crest, and charakteres on the ‘neck’. Their lower ends do not taper off; they seem to be fantastic creatures modelled on birds or snakes. The two lower animals, likewise symmetrically arranged, are inverted, with their heads downwards. Their tails taper off to meet the upper pair. The bands are presumably scales, so they must represent snakes. 18 The practice is also standard in PGrMag. The best brief discussion of the phe-nomenon is J.B. Curbera, Maternal Lineage in Greek Magical Texts, in WAM 195–204; see also the references given in the commentary below."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"222  jürgen  blänsdorfThe field so created is further delineated by two vertical lines drawn from the mouths of the upper pair to those of the lower one. In the midst of the rectangle so created is a lozenge or rhombus containing a limbless, thick necked figure with a roughly ’cello-shaped body. The face, with large, round eyes, is facing forward; there are four strokes on top, perhaps representing a crown. The lozenge seems to be connected to the vertical lines left and right by small arrows of different types (but see below). In the fields created between the animals and the ver-tical lines are a number of designs, which I try to explain below. The lowest register of the drawing, as it were the exergue, contains seven large ring-letters; at the top, there are another five just left of centre. Fig. 3. Drawing of defixio with snakes (inv. no.

It consists of two longish lines above the upper row of charakteres, seven rather cramped lines to their right, and below; and a further seven lines in the space between the lower point of the rhombus and the ‘exergue’, framed by the two vertical lines. Altogether, then, there are sixteen lines of intelligible text. In addition, there is a label just by each of the upper creatures, and what seems to be a daemonic name beside the lower ones. The latter are intelligible enough; the upper words, the labels, are, as we shall see, more unusual.The text is written in skilled, almost elegant, minuscule cursive, but is nevertheless very difficult to read because the average letter-height is only 1mm. Moreover, some letters are ligatured, others bear signs of having been written rapidly: for example, the two strokes of the cursive a are separated from each other by nearly 1mm.19The text begins by invoking holy and sacred female entities (sacras santas), evidently the Nymphs of Anna Perenna, since they are referred to in much the same way in the three votive monuments set into the revetment of the trough.20 In addition, angili are cited in the dative or ablative case; they are qualified as supteri, those ‘below’. These angels are of course not the Christian type but divine intermediaries between the gods and human beings. Such daemonic messengers, and the Nymphs, are invoked in several of the Porta S. Sebastiano texts (see commentary), though without any special reference to a river or a well. We may therefore conclude that nymphs might be thought of as belonging to the infernal world. In our text however they are not invoked as assistants of Seth, but as the main deities of the cult of the fountain of Anna Perenna, and there is no explicit reference to their belonging to the underworld.21The author of the text uses the formal expression rogo et peto vir-tutem vestram, solemnly requesting that their ‘great virtue’ utterly remove the sight of a man named Sura, ‘the eyes, the right one and the left one’, as he meticulously puts it, like a Roman lawyer. Eyes are cursed in a number of other Latin defixiones, but only as one item in a long list of parts of the body being cursed. This seems to be the only 19 I would again like to express my gratitude to P.-Y. Lambert for valuable discus-sion of the readings and their interpretation.20 AE 2003: 251: sacratis nymphis and then sanctas (l. 5); AE 2003: 252 and 253: nymphis sacratis. For the texts, see p. 199f. above.21 Cf. Piranomonte, p. 197f. above."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"224  jürgen  blänsdorfcase of a curse directed solely against the eyes. The reason for this choice becomes clear in the second part of the text. Sura is a fairly common cognomen in the late Republic and the Empire. A target’s parentage is often abused; here we find the insulting formula, nat(us) maledicta modo <est> de vulva, “who was born from an accursed vulva”. The first section ends with an insistent repetition of the demand: Fiat; rogo et peto magnam virtutem vestra(m), “Let it so be—I require and request it by your great virtue”.The remaining section beneath the lozenge restates the whole curse with slight variations, adding an important item of information: tol-lite oculus (= oculos) dextru sinesteru, ne possit durare virtus arbitri Surae, qui natus est de vulva maledicta. During the discussion of my presentation at the conference, David Jordan proposed to take virtus with arbitri(i), comparing γνώμη, ἐπιστήμη, λογισμός in Greek defix-iones.22 However, as far as I know, the phrase ἀρετὴ γνώμης is just as unparalleled as virtus arbitrii, so I prefer to take arbitri with Surae, and understand: “Take the eyes, the right one (and) the left one, so that the virtue of Sura the Arbitrator may not persist, who is born from an accursed vulva”. In my view, the term arbiter, which is certainly not part of the name Sura, is the key to the entire curse. In the jurisdic-tion of the mid-late Principate and Late-Roman period, an arbiter was not, as in the Republic, a private individual chosen by both parties to attempt to resolve a dispute without recourse to the courts, but an official, an assistant of the judge, who was entrusted with the prepa-ration of a lawsuit, the inquiry into the facts, and the execution of the judgment. For such a person to become blind would be precisely the sort of catastrophe imagined by our principal. I therefore incline to think that this is a judicial text (Audollent’s tabulae iudiciariae), and that the Nymphs are being asked either to prevent a case coming before Sura, or to take revenge for an adverse judgement in some case. Indeed, although though some typical features are absent here, such as the name of the petitioner, the express desire for justice or revenge, and the justification for the curse, we could classify the text as a prayer for justice.2322 Even if we accept this interpretation, the meaning of the curse would not be much altered, the idea being that through being blinded he would no longer be able to function in a reasonable manner.23 See H. Versnel’s contribution to this volume (p. 279f.), where he sums up the main characteristics of the category as he understands it."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" the texts from the fons annae perennae 225Let me now turn to the remaining four words. The two labels at the top read dextru and sinesteru, and obviously refer to the eyes, right and left, which are to be plucked out of Sura, or otherwise incapaci-tated. Yet oddly enough dextru appears on the left of the drawing, and sinesteru on the right. I take this reversal to signify the inverted world of magic. Beneath the curious circular designs we read BLOBES on the left, and IRILESUS on the right. As neither are Greek or Latin words, they might be magic words, nomina magica. For what it is worth, however, neither is among the hundreds listed in PGrMag 3, GMPT and the Demotic Papyri.24 Nor are they to be found in the texts from Porta S. Sebastiano. I therefore began to wonder whether blobes and irile-sus might not be real words with an ascertainable meaning in some appropriate language. Thinking it might perhaps be Egyptian, the origin of many of the magic rites and formulas, I asked three Ger-man scholars of Egyptian or Coptic, Prof. Ursula Verhoeven-van Els-bergen (Mainz), Prof. Sebastian Richter (Leipzig), and Prof. Heinz J. Thissen (Cologne). Though all are very sceptical about the possibility of interpreting magic formulae in general, they unanimously agreed that blobes is Coptic, and means either ‘the Great Eye (of ) Bes’ or ‘Baal (and) Bes’.25 In Egyptian belief, Bes was a dwarf-like good spirit; who already in the Old Kingdom, but especially in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, became a powerful, generally beneficent, sometimes violent, divine power.26 Irilesus, too, is Egyptian, probably composed of 24 [The name βολ βε σρω, however, occurs as a ‘Typhonic’ god, e.g. PGrMag IV 1010; DTAud 16 II 8 (Fiq, Syria); at CIL VIII 12510 = DTAud 240 l. 3 (Carthage) he is named as one of the seven συνθρόνοι of the Lord of the Underworld. On the dis-cussion of the possible meaning, cf. Brashear 1995, 3583 s.v. Bolbes might represent the same name with metathesis of -ol-; other corruptions or variants seem to occur in DTAud 15 l. 51 (βολσεβωχ); βολσοχ (PGrMag II 32); βολσαχυ (IV 2027) etc. Eds.]25 [Depending on dialect, bal (Saidic, Bohairic) or bel (Achmimic) (m.) means ‘eye’; o (m.) ‘great’, usually placed after the noun, as in PGM III 633; cf.

The late-Vp Cop-tic Life of Apa Moses mentions that ‘a wicked demon’ named Bes, probably at the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"226  jürgen  blänsdorfthe two roots for ‘eye’ and ‘tongue’.27 Again, the link between the name and the drawing is puzzling, perhaps insoluble. But the link between each of the names and the intention of the curse now seems obvious: they refer to the act of seeing or looking, irilesus also to speaking. Sura, the Arbitrator, who has seen and said something he ought not to have seen or said, is to be attacked by daemons of looking and talking.We come finally to the figure in the centre of the lozenge. The main text itself does not appear to name it. In that case, it cannot be Sura himself. A human being would anyway have arms and legs, as in Text 1. There are comparable figures on the Porta S. Sebastiano tablets, who are also enclosed in boxes (usually rectangles however, never lozenges), depicting Osiris, Seth or other beings associated with the underworld (Wünsch 1898, 85f.). In one of the Greek magical papyri, there is a drawing of Bes wearing a crown, which looks rather like the ‘hair’ on our figure.28 However I incline to agree with Marina Piranomonte’s view that the latter is meant to be female. She even suggests it might be Anna Perenna herself (p. 211). It is true that Anna is never mentioned in this or any other of the texts so far deciphered; it is also true that the nymphs are always invoked in the plural. But since Anna is herself a nymph, she and her nymphs might conceivably be denoted by a single image. In the end, however, I think we should probably conclude that the figure is some sort of daemon: the very large eyes seem clearly to allude to the central feature of the curse.This tablet stands out from the others recovered from the cistern for its overall design, its solemn imprecatory formula, the reference to Memnoneion at Abydos where there was a Bes-oracle, had attacked villagers, and “some of those attacked had become blind in one eye” (Frankfurter, p. 129).

Griffiths 1970, 288; in the form (e)iorh it meant ‘see’ (verb) or ‘sight’ (n.) in Coptic. ‘Tongue’ is ns (there is no l-sound in written Egyptian); the determinative for ‘limb/flesh’ could also be read as 3s or ws (cf. Gardiner F51), which might explain the –sus; the Coptic word was las (Saidic, Bohairic) or les (Achmimic, Fayyumic). Eds.]28 [PGrMag VIII Col. III, cf.

Interestingly enough, however, the language itself is nearly classical, with just minor changes typical of late Latin, e.g. santas for sanctas, oculus as acc. pl. = oculos, the dropping of final -m in dextru and sinesteru, and of final -s in natu (l. 16), though this last might also be due to lack of space. 8. The problems of Text 8 (inv.no. 475566) are quite different. In spite of its odd shape, we can be sure the tablet is complete (Text-fig. 4), since the first and last lines follow the irregularities of the lead, and none of the lines is broken off either to the left or the right. The undulations and the gap between ll. 2 and 3 show that the large bifurcated crack in the centre was already present before the tablet was inscribed. The let-ters are up to 8mm high, the individual strokes deep and undamaged. Nevertheless the text is very difficult to read: the letters are a mixture of majuscules and uncial minuscules, they are often badly formed (c can be mistaken for t, the writer seems to use the l as an s, and there are two types of a), and in some places the writer has corrected him-self by overwriting. At least one line (l. 3) is in part, or even wholly, retrograde (i.e. from right to left), but the individual letters are not reversed. Finally, the language is Vulgar Latin—for instance the final -m is always dropped—and the sentences seem to be unfinished. All in all, the writer cannot have been very literate. The strongly-marked parataxis is however typical of Vulgar Latin.Fig. 4. Drawing of curse against Fanius, (H)erculius and Fapricilianus (inv. no. SAR 475566). Museo Nazionale Romano delle Terme, Dipartimento Epigrafico."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"228  jürgen  blänsdorfAll this naturally has implications for the sense we can make of the text. I can really only share my indecisions with the reader. In the first line we find some men’s names in the accusative, implying that they are the object of an action. The first is Faniu(m), a well-attested name. The second—or the second part of the first name, separated from it by two vertical strokes—is Herculiu(m), hitherto unrecorded. The third name was first written FAPUCILIANU, but then corrected to FAPRICILIANU. But there is no epigraphic or literary record of any name such as Fapucilianus, Fapricilianus or Fabricilianus. The fol-lowing letters OCDIUINI are to be read as hoc divini—the dropped h is typical of later Latin. We must understand an ellipse, with the injunction or request omitted: “(Do as I request in performing) this divine (rite)”. OSACCIPI at the beginning of l. 2 would be hos accipe in classical Latin, “take them”. The god is asked to accept the targets as an offering, i.e. to kill them.29 The god himself is not named, because the context was assumed to supply such details. I take UIGENT (the T separated from the rest of the word by the crack in the lead), ‘they are strong’, as both a warning and a justification for the curse. The next word DEPONA(s) is the demand itself, expressed in the briefest man-ner possible: the victim(s) are to be taken into the underworld. L. 3 is very problematic. (H)oc nume (= nomen) is clear, but there follows a series of jumbled syllables. The reading of l. 6 below seems to confirm that these syllables are to be read from right to left, and I therefore propose to read hoc nomen deponam (or deponas). Et agite, ut ille se[—. The end of the sentence is unfortunately lost, since the begin-ning of l. 4 is missing. The O of the first syllable NO in l. 4 is crossed out, and the entire word was probably replaced by BONA. No sense can yet be made of the following letters NISENATIA or NILENATIA. Bona nis<i> nati(v)a, ‘only genuine things’ seems a possibility. If the reading is indeed BONA NILENATIA, it is perhaps worth remarking that the same sequence of letters BON . . . LE occurs in Text 5 (inv. no. 475722). If that is significant, bona nilenatia might represent an invocation; but I cannot explain either Nilenatia or Nisenatia. Senatia or Enatia would be well attested names, but then what to do with 29 Cf.

I look forward to receiving readers’ suggestions.In line 5 an immediately possibility seemed to be RETIMUS, which however makes no sense. I therefore tried reading it backwards, which, leaving the R aside, would give SUMITE. Sumite, ‘take away’, would indeed fit the genre of the text. But through the microscope I then saw that the third stroke of the R did not belong here but to l. 6, where it crosses the first stroke of a Q or an A. We must therefore read PETIMUS, petimus, which makes good sense taken together with the preceding et qod (the q written without a u): ‘and what we ask for’.The solution to ETRIMUSQUEATE in l. 6 only occurred to me long after the conference was over. Once I had read petimus in l. 5, I decided -rimus must also be the ending of a verb. Searching for the stem, it occurred to me that it must be que = qu(a)e-. This would give the perfectly satisfactory concluding sequence et quod petimus et quaerimus a te.30 The writer evidently used at least two methods of encoding his text, displacing words and jumbling syllables.Text 8 thus turns out to be a curse against two or three powerful men written by a fairly illiterate person who was nevertheless more or less able to communicate his wishes to an apparently female deity, perhaps Anna Perenna herself, and to use more than one means of ‘estranging’ his text.SummaryThe inscriptions in Latin, or mainly in Latin, found in the cistern of the fountain or nymphaeum of Anna Perenna at Rome and a selection of which is presented for the first time here, are very different from one another as regards a) form, b) script, c) language, d) contents and e) genre. There is a clear sense that the traditional rules for writing defixiones no longer held good. a) The sizes and shapes of the tablets discussed here are so different from one another that it seems unlikely they were deposited by a single professional practitioner. On the other hand, the containers 30 Tomlin describes some even more difficult encodings to be found in British prayers for justice in 2004, 25–27."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"230  jürgen  blänsdorfmust have been made by specialised craftsmen. So probably the petitioners bought ready-made containers and wrote the texts themselves. b) The conclusion that many different hands were at work is sup-ported by the variety of different scripts employed: genuine majus-cules, cursive minuscules and uncial-like letters. Some of the texts may well be fairly early, though most are to be dated to IVp (sec-ond half ). We need to be cautious here, however: for example, the letter-forms of Text 4 look early, but the language is IVp. c) Some of the language employed is close to classical Latin, but in other texts (nos. 4, 7, 8) there is a considerable variety of Late and Vulgar Latin. In addition, the texts illustrate the bilingualism of the Late Roman period.d) As concerns the contents, the selection includes only one text (no. 7, but cf. 5) that explicitly addresses the Nymphs, the deities of the sanctuary; another (no. 3) is apparently addressed to Egyptian Seth without referring to the local gods or the sanctuary.e) Two of the eight texts (nos. 4, 5) may not even be defixiones but prayers asking for help or success, the usual reasons for depositing gifts at this sanctuary. We must also remember the three votive inscriptions relating to victories evidently won in the annual dra-matic competitions at this shrine. Despite their rather unsatisfactory state of preservation, and the diffi-culty of deciphering them, the Anna Perenna inscriptions offer us an unexpected glimpse into private ‘pagan’ practice at Rome, mainly in the second half of IVp, thus providing both a foil to the official estab-lishment of Christianity and an insight into the practices that caused contemporary emperors repeatedly to inveigh against the persistence of ‘superstition’, divination and sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" the texts from the fons annae perennae 231Appendix31 Text 1 (inv. no. 475561).Lead tablet.

Between them a lozenge, with a frontal figure lacking arms and legs in the centre. Snakes are associated with the underworld and so with Osiris.34 It is uncertain whether we should identify the figure in the centre as a daemon, like the chthonic (?) snakes, as Anna Perenna herself (as Piranomonte suggests), or as the victim of the curse. At any rate it is not Seth, who is depicted in the Porta S. Sebastiano texts as a male bust with rays on his head, placed on Osiris’ coffin (Wünsch 1898, 85f.). At the left angle of the lozenge: ΘΕΕ (?) or perhaps bird’s claws.

Christ. 2. 30: quasdam notas quos characteres vocant) at the top and bottom of the tablet are part of the drawing. Other examples of this technique for creating charakteres may be found in PGrMag 2, pp. 18f, 26, 36f., 130, 140, 170f. 182, 188; SupplMag nos. 66, 92, 94, 96–98; DTAud nos. 272, 276, 278, cf. the discussion in Brashear 1995, 3380–84. DTAud 156 gives the meaning of the symbols as: Εὐλάμων Χ Οὔσιρι Ζ Οὔσιρι Μνε Υ Φρι. DTAud 161, 163, 165 etc. however offer different values.On either side of the lozenge are some complex designs I cannot interpret. There is a single word above and below each, beside the creatures: to the left, dextra (above), blobes (below); to the right, sin-estera (above), irilesus (below). Blobes and Irilesus are presumably the names of the daemons.35 Blobes: The name probably means ‘Great Eye of Bes’. Egyptian religion had a class of small, ugly but beneficent demons called Bes(as), with notably large eyes, who became major gods in the popular religion of the Late Period and in Graeco-Roman Egypt. Bes is rarely invoked by name in the magical papyri, and then only for divination (e.g. PGrMag VIII 64–110); the most relevant of these is PGrMag VII 222–49, which addresses the daemon adjured as the “headless god who has a head and face on his feet”, Βησᾶς ἀμβλυωπός, ‘half-blind Bes’ (245). The weakness of the god’s eyes was thus the-matised in some contexts.36 I take it that Blobes and Irilesus are here considered as assistants: cf. Wünsch 1898, no. 16 ll. 20–22 = DTAud 155: . . . καὶ ἅγιοι πάρεδροι, οἳ ἐν δεξιῷ κα[ὶ ἀριστ]ερῶ.37The line-ends show that the text was written after the drawing was completed. 35 See nn. 26–27 above.36 [The papyrus reads ἀμβλυώπως. In a somewhat misleading account of this recipe, where he does not give the actual reading, Hopfner read ἀμβλυωπής, and translated “die Sehkraft (des bösen Blickes) schwächend” (see also PGrMag app. crit. ad loc.: “der den Blick lähmt”), comparing Bes to the Greek Gorgon head (1974–90, 2.1: 296 §187). Preisendanz more plausibly reads ἀμβλυωπός, meaning “dim- or weak-sighted” (only in active sense at Dioscorides, Med. 2.107). See also Preisendanz 1926, 44f.

Fulgentius Planciades, Comm. in Theb. p. 699: mens enim humana ex santa luce quam habuit iocundatur.—FU supteris: the first two letters are clear, but the import is not; supteris is not yet attested, but easily intelli-gible by analogy with superis. It means the same as inferis. The pas-sage as a whole must mean something like sacras santas cum supteris et angilis.—angilis: intermediaries between gods and men, especially to the underworld, were first called δαίμονες, but the term ἄγγελοι becomes common esp. in Anatolia (they occur frequently for example in the Mysian-Phrygian ‘confession texts’: Petzold, BIWK), possibly under the influence of Jewish religion, and then spread westwards (see J. Michl, s.v. Engel I–IX, RfAC 5 [1962] 54–258). References to them in later curse-contexts are very frequent, e.g. DTAud no. 74 (Attica): καταγράφω κ(αὶ) κατατ[ίθω] ἀν[γ]έ[λης καταχθο]νίοις, ̔Ερμῆ καταχ[θ]ονίω; cf. 75a ll. 1–4; Wünsch 1898 no. 49 l. 52 = DTAud no. 187: ἐξορκίζω ὑμᾶς, ἅγιοι ἄνγελοι καὶ ἅγια ὀνόματα; PGrMag VII 880–87: ἐπικαλοῦμαι σε, δέσποινα τοῦ συμπάντος κόσμου, . . . δὸς ἱερὸν ἄγγελον ἢ πάρεδρον ὅσ<ι>ον διακονήσοντα τῇ σήμερο[ν ν]υκτὶ, . . . καὶ κέλευσον ἀγγέλῳ ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς τὸν δεῖνα, ἄξαι αὐτὴν τῶν τρίχων; also IV 1932–35; 3024f.

We may also cite ll. 3f. of the oracle by Apollo of Oenoanda (II-IIIp) discussed by Lac-tantius, Inst. div. 1.7.1–9: μεικρὰ δὲ θεοῦ μερὶς ἄνγελοι ἡμεῖς (= SEG 27 [1977] 933). Christian writers took over this pagan meaning in cer-tain contexts: Arnobius cites the doctrine of the pagans who accused Jesus of having been a sorcerer, and used the force of mighty angels: Arnob., Adv. nat. 1.43: magus fuit, clandestinis artibus omnia illa per-fecit, Aegyptiorum ex adytis angelorum potentium nomina et remotas furatus est disciplinas; Augustine, De civ. Dei 9.19: nonnulli istorum, ut ita dicam, daemonicolarum, in quibus et Labeo est, eosdem perhibent ab aliis angelos dici, quos ipsi daemonas vocant. The Christian baptis-mal formula bade the candidate renounce the devil, his train, and his angels, e.g. Tertullian, De spect. 4: renuntiasse nos diabolo et pompae eius et angelis eius; cf. R. Heinze, Xenokrates (Leipzig 1892) 112f.; A. Dieterich, Nekyia (Leipzig and Berlin 1913) 60f.; Hopfner 1974–90, 1: 64–82, §§ 135–162, esp. 154. 2f.: uirtutem: cf.

It was found in 1805 at Lydney Park in the Severn val-ley, in the ruins of a Roman temple locally called the Dwarfs’ Chapel because the hypocaust was thought to have been inhabited. It was an inscribed piece of lead:Silvianus to the god Nodens. He has lost his ring and has given half to Nodens.

Th eir special character has been illuminated by Henk Versnel, who aptly calls them ‘prayers for justice’.5 Th ey are not anonymous spells consigning enemies to demons and the Underworld, but messages written to respectable gods, asking (but not compelling) their inter-vention; the petitioner says that he (or she) has been maltreated, and seeks divine redress. Th e gods are treated like superior Roman offi -cials, Abinnaeus for example, who commanded a late-Roman fort in Egypt. He received statements of the off ence committed followed by this formula: Wherefore I request and beg of your philanthropy to apprehend this man and compel him to restore to me what he has wickedly seized.6 Some British curse-tablets are explicitly ‘pleas’ (pet(it)io, iteratis pre-cibus), or ‘complaints’ (Tomlin 1988, 66) beginning with queror or conqueror, and there is even this commonitorium from Uley:A memorandum to the god Mercury from Saturnina, a woman, concern-ing the linen cloth which she has lost. (She asks) that he who has stolen it should not have rest before, unless, when he brings the aforesaid prop-erty to the aforesaid temple, whether man or woman, slave or free.7Th e god of Uley was too polite to say so, but he must have felt like Pliny on his Tuscan estate: “I am beset on all sides by the peasants with all their petitions full of complaints”.8When I started working on British ‘curse-tablets’ twenty years ago, I was struck by similarities in language and formulation in two Spanish tablets from Emerita and Italica, to which can now be added four tab-4 See e.g. DTAud nos. 1; 2 = Syll. 1179; 3; 4A, 6 and 8; 5; 10; 11; 12; 13.

Th ese are all directed against thieves, one-third of extant Latin ‘curse-tablets’ from Spain and Por-tugal, compared with two-thirds of a much larger total from Britain.9 I reprint the six Iberian texts here as published, adding some notes of my own; by no means a complete commentary, but aft er noting points of similarity with British tablets and suggesting a few emendations, I off er a translation. I do not discuss whether the similarities are so great as to imply the use of Latin ‘handbooks’, but there is certainly much variation, and nothing like the repetition and stereotyping found in some Greek texts. My own impression, in Britain at least, is that an author was aware of what was expected of him, but like a Roman with his Will, “the document was emphatically his own invention, written by himself or dictated to another”.10 But before I start happily compar-ing thieves in Iberia and Britain, I should reiterate the insight we owe to Versnel: the Latin texts from Spain and Portugal were preceded by Greek texts like the Cnidus tablets, so it follows that the British texts do not derive from the Iberian, but like them express a much older belief which is not western and localised, but is common to the Medi-terranean world—the idea that we can ask the gods for justice.1.

Baelo, tibi conmendo furtu(m) me(um) . . . ut (h)oc furtu(m) reprindas; for Britain, Uley 68 (unpub-lished): [?queror] de furto quod mihi factum est. Th e noun furtum is not found at Bath, except in 102, where it is confused with fur (‘thief ’), but fraudem is used similarly (Tomlin 1988, 64 s.v. fraudem).7. imudavit: the context requires a rhetorical synonym of involavit. Th e form is probably Vulgar Latin for Classical immutavit, the voicing of t > d being typical of Vulgar Latin and Romance (cf. evides in Baelo, 6), so the verb means ‘change (for the worse)’. TLL records no instance in the sense of ‘steal’, but in view of minus fecit (8), an exact equivalent is unnecessary. Alternatively, but less likely, since it would not be a Vulgar form, imudavit is a mistake for immundavit (‘dirtied’).involavit: Vulgar Latin ‘stole’ (and thus in Italica); much the most common verb in British curse-tablets (Tomlin 1988, 64 s.v. involare), where its occasional synonyms are decepit, levavit, furaverit, tulit / tul-erit, sustulit.8. minus fecit: yet another rhetorical synonym of involavit; literally ‘diminish’, but stronger than this; minus has become a prefi x like mis- in Vulgar Latin and early Romance which (like dis-) reverses the sense of the following verb.

Tomlin 1988, 79–81. Th ese lists are ‘quasi-legal’ (Tomlin 1988, 70f.; 79–81): Ulpian, Digest 47.2.19 recommends that in actions for theft one should make a careful list of the objects stolen, including the colour of clothes.

Italica/Sontiponce (nr. Seville)Th e Caerleon tablet already mentioned was found in south-east Wales, not far from Lydney Park. Th ere is an Iberian connection, albeit remote: the modern (Welsh) place-name, like Spanish León, preserves the Roman word legio; and Caerleon was the base of leg. II Augusta, one of Augustus’ legions which completed the conquest of Iberia and formed part of the garrison. In 1927 ‘King Arthur’s Round Table’, the Roman amphitheatre outside the fortress, was excavated and this tab-let was found. With the exception of two lists of names from the bath-house at Leintwardine, it happens to be the only tablet from a military site in Britain, but there is no sign of this in the text: Lady Nemesis, I give you my cloak and sandals. Let him who stole them not redeem them unless with his life and blood.14Collingwood at fi rst saw this correctly as a curse against a thief, but he assumed that it was a gladiator who would die in the arena; later he moved towards Oxé’s idea that the gladiator had ‘brought’ (tulit) his cloak and boots to the cloak-room, but would not be able to ‘withdraw’ (redimat) them. Th is idea was developed by Egger, who suggested that cloak and boots were buried with the tablet as proxy for the gladiator himself, instead of (say) nail-clippings; and with the unwitting help of a descender from the previous line, he re-read the last four words as ni vita Sanguinei sui, ‘except with the life of his Blood-red charger’, a curse on the gladiator’s horse. Th is fantasy was adopted by RIB in 1965, which could hardly be expected to recognise the British tablets’ obsession with ‘blood’ before the evidence had accumulated.15 Egger himself was thinking of curses from the circus at Rome, Carthage and 13 Tomlin 1988, 101–05. A ‘psychosomatic mechanism for curse tablets’ is devel-oped by Kiernan 2004, with anthropological parallels.14 Caerleon, dom(i)na Nemesis do tibi palleum et galliculas qui tulit non redimat ni v[i]ta sanguine suo.

Th e true fi nd-spot, in a sense, was not the arena but the adjoining shrine of Nemesis, appropriately the goddess of divine retribution. Th is is easy to say now, when another tablet relating to the theft of clothes has just been found in the London amphitheatre, addressed to another goddess associated with amphitheatres who is sometimes identifi ed with Nemesis: I give to the goddess Deana my headgear and band, less one-third. If anyone has done this, whether boy or girl, whether slave or free, I give him, and through me let him be unable to live.16At Caerleon, there was a bath-house next to the amphitheatre, and no doubt the cloak and shoes were stolen there. So at least the experience of bathers at Bath would suggest.17 Understanding the Vulgar verb tulit and shoes as an object of theft would have been easier if the Italica tablet (Text-fi g. 7) had been available to Collingwood and RIB, but it was only found in 1972. It has obvious affi nities with Bath as well as Caerleon, in language and formulation, besides being addressed to the goddess of a spring: dom(i)na fons fove[ns] | ut tu persequaris tuas | res demando, quiscun|que caligas meas tel|5luit et solias. tibi, | dea, demando ut tu | illas, ad(cep)tor si quis | puel(l)a, si mulier sive | [ho]mo involavit, |10 [. .]illos persequaris.Notes:1. dom(i)na: cf.

Th e formula is ‘quasi-legal’, but also typical of prayers (Tomlin 1988, 68). A British altar (RIB 2071) is dedicated [s]ive deo sive d[e]ae, for example, and Macrobius (Sat. 3.9.6–8) quotes a formula of evocation which begins: si deus, si dea est.21 A Bath tablet (98) even introduces the pairing, ‘whether pagan or Christian’.Th ere are three instances of si quis from Bath, e.g. 63, si quis balnia-rem Cantissen(a)e inv[o]la[v]erit, si s(e)r(v)us si liber.

Salacia/Setúbal (Portugal)Baelo illustrates a peculiarity of the Iberian tablets: they ask the deity to kill the thief and punish the theft , but they do not expressly require the thief to return what he has stolen. Th is requirement is explicit in some British texts, and there is even a ‘confession cult’ altar from Phrygian Maeonia which illustrates the return of a stolen cloak.26 Th e Iberian reticence is not due to any sense of logic (how can a dead man give something back?), but like other British texts simply takes for granted that the one entails the other.27 Recovering what is lost is implied anyway by ‘exaction’, the careful listing of the property stolen to tell the deity what to recover, and by the ambiguity of the verb vindicare, meaning ‘to punish’ or ‘to recover’. For the author of the next tablet, from Salacia (Text-fi g. 8), destruction of the thief entails his own ‘fi nding’ of the stolen property:domine Megare | invicte, tu qui Attidis | corpus accepisti, accipias cor|pus eius qui meas sarcinas |5 supstulit, qui me compilavit | de domo Hispani illius. corpus | tibi et anima(m) do dono ut meas | res invenia(m). tunc 26 For example Bath 32: cursing the thief with ill-health nissi . . . istas s[p]ecies ad [te]mplum tuum detulerit (with note ad loc. of further instances).

So the editor’s a(d) Iau dat can be read quite easily as mandat, which would remove two diffi cul-ties: the ambiguous preposition a for a(d), instead of the dative which invariably follows the do/dono formula; and the invocation of Iao [not ‘Iau’], who is usually a deity of protective spells, not ‘curse-tablets’.38rogat et mandat together: cf.

I have been luckier than the editors of Caerleon: a code can only be broken when a ‘critical mass’ of intercepts has accumulated.45 British ‘curse-tablets’ were still quite rare in 1965: only seven are published in RIB, and three of these are ‘curses’ rather than ‘prayers for justice’; another six were found by 1977, when the total was twelve published.46 In 1993 the Ibe-rian total was thirteen.47 I sympathise with the editors of Italica, who complained in 1975 that Spain, for all its generosity with epigraphic texts of major importance, has been sparing with defi xiones.48 Th e Brit-ish total is now more like 250.

Versnel In a number of papers published in the nineteen-eighties and early-nineties, I argued for a distinction between (or within) the general category of Greek and Latin defixiones, on the one hand, and a more specific group of curses on the other. I have proposed a variety of names for this group: ‘judicial prayers’,1 ‘prayers for justice’, ‘prayers for revenge’. After two brief articles in Dutch and French respectively (Versnel 1986; 1987), a more comprehensive study entitled “Beyond Cursing: The Appeal to Justice in Judicial Prayers” (Versnel 1991), which was followed by a number of studies on related subjects,2 has done much to make the category, and the arguments on which it was based, widely familiar.3 Term and concept have been adopted, and * I wish to express my profound gratitude to Richard Gordon, who as general edi-tor accepted the onerous task to thoroughly scrutinize my text on a wide variety of barbarisms, errors and omissions and whose meticulous care went far beyond the limits of what is usually understood by the word ‘editing’. Remaining mistakes are solely due to the author’s indomitable tendency to continue inserting pieces of text after the editor’s interventions.1 As this term may provoke confusion with the defixiones iudicariae, relating to litigation between human beings, which are also sometimes called “judicial curses”, we should handle this expression with care, that is, only after precise definition. Richard Gordon prefers the term “vindicative” (not ‘vindictive’), as he wrote earlier and most recently in: Social Control in the Lydian and Phrygian ‘Confession’ texts, in: L. Her-nandéz Guerra and J. Alvar Ezquerra (eds.), Actas del XXVII congreso internacional Girea-Arys IX, Jerarquías religiosas y control social en el mundo antiguo (Valladolid 2002 [2004]), 198. I have no objection to this except that the term (though itself per-tinent) belongs to the semantic field of the verb to vindicate, whose meanings are 1) clear of blame, 2) establish the merits or justice of, 3) justify by arguments or evidence. These denotations of the English word ‘vindicate’ do not match the required mean-ing of “asking a god for justice, vengeance and/or redress for a wrong suffered”. In order to prevent confusion and because ‘prayer for justice’ has become established now I would maintain that expression for future use. The German “Vergeltungsgebet”, offered by Graf 2001, 186, equals vindicative prayer but lacks its ambiguity. 2 Versnel 1994, 1998, 1999, 2002.3 I have always expressly drawn attention to the work of earlier scholars that in some ways anticipated mine, especially Björck 1938 (passim in Versnel 1991; most"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"276 henk s. versneloften productively applied in their own work, by such prominent scholars in the field as David Jordan,4 Chris Faraone (who contrib-uted to its further development by tracing the Canaanitic background of this type of curse in a recent article on curses against thieves),5 and Angelos Chaniotis,6 as well as in numerous publications of new texts that display elements at variance with the genre of ordinary defixiones.7 Independently, Roger Tomlin, in his magisterial edition of the Bath tablets, had already pointed out that these are “petitions for justice, not recently: Versnel 2002, 71). It should be noted, however, that Björck focussed his attention on those funerary curses in which the god (often the Sun) was asked to avenge the deceased in cases where the death was believed to have been caused by a person unknown. On this topic, see: F. Cumont, Il sole vindice dei delitti ed il simbolo delle mani alzate, Mem. Pont. Acc. ser. III.1 (1923) 65–80; idem, Deux monuments des cultes solaires, Appendice, Syria 14 (1933) 392–5; and more recently: Versnel 1991, 70–71; 1999, 129–31; Chaniotis 2004, 9–11; Graf 2001; idem, Untimely Death, Witch-craft, and Divine Vengeance.

Bernand, Inscriptions grecques d’Égypte et de Nubie au Musée du Louvre (Paris 1992) no. 90 and cf. 93 and 98. Roger Tomlin informs me that C.W. King, in W.H. Bathurst, Roman Antiquities at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire (London 1879) 45, was the first to compare the Brit-ish ‘prayers for justice’ with the Cnidus tablets (see below), “which similarly invoke the wrath of heaven upon certain obnoxious parties”. The Cnidus tablets were found in 1859 by (Sir) Charles Newton, the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum from 1861–96, in the temple of Demeter while he was the British vice-consul in Mitylene (the statue is in the Museum). He published them in 1863. 4 In many publications of new texts and most explicitly in SGD II 5f., where he explains that he uses the term ‘curse tablets’ rather than defixiones in the title (as he had done in SGD I) because he is convinced that my ‘prayers for justice’ should be considered a different category. Note also his remark in: Three Curse Tablets, in Jordan, Montgomery and Thomassen 1999, 115–24 at 115: “Of the greatest help to our understanding of Greek and Latin curse tablets is H.S. Versnel’s demonstration (1991) that while many curses express aggressive malice on the part of the curser, certain others, which V. calls ‘prayers for justice’, are written in the hope of obtaining vengeance for wrongs suffered”. Jordan here lays particular emphasis on “borderland curses” (what Ogden 1999, 38 calls “cross-over cases”), which display elements of both categories, aggressively malicious defixiones and ‘judicial prayers’. For a discussion of this borderland category see below pp. 332–42.5 Faraone, Garnand, and López-Ruiz 2005, 162: “Versnel has completely revolu-tionized our understanding of this special genre of curse, which now seems quite distinct from the so-called binding curses (defixiones) and clearly part of a special subset of curses—a subset that he has aptly labeled ‘prayers for justice’ ” (162). In this article Faraone adduces numerous texts I had already discussed in Versnel 1991 and subsequent studies, as well as some of those I treat here. See his Table 1, on p. 173.6 In the notices of similar curses in his invaluable EBGR, and most recently in Chaniotis 2004.7 See the commentaries on the texts discussed here. I would specifically mention Curbera 1999, 169: “Accanto alle defixiones propriamente dette bisogna menzionare dei documenti . . . che appartengono alla categoria chiamata da Hendrik Versnel ‘judi-cial prayers’ ”."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 277magical spells”.8 Both J.G. Gager9 and D. Ogden10 in their general dis-cussions of defixiones single out the ‘pleas for justice and revenge’, or ‘prayers for justice’, as a special category alongside, but distinct from, those of the well-known categories (which are, in the order adopted by both authors: 1. competition in theatre and circus; 2. sex, love and marriage; 3. legal and political disputes; 4. business and commerce).11If I unblushingly insist on these positive reactions, I do so for at least two reasons. The first is that there are still some specialists who seem slightly reluctant to adopt this new taxonomy.12 Others, while accepting the desirability of a distinction, seem reluctant to accept too radical a division between this group and the other types of defixio. In this connection, I am aware that there has been some misunder-standing about the inferences I am believed to draw from the new categorisation.The second reason is that recognition of the new category does not necessarily imply comprehension of its meaning and implications. From a recent collective volume (Brodersen and Kropp 2004), I learn that the term ‘prayers for justice’, in the form “Gebete um Gerechtigkeit”, 8 Tomlin 1988, 62; idem 2004, 12: “sogenannte ‘Gebete um Gerechtigkeit’ . . . Briefe an Götter, die von Personen verfaßt werden, die sich zu einer rechtmäßigen Klage befugt sehen”; also his contribution to the present volume (p. 246f.). Although his 1988 volume appeared one, respectively two years after my own first studies, and he had the opportunity to inspect a draft of my paper of 1991 (see Tomlin 1988, 59 n. 3), his insights over the years, as witness his contributions to Britannia, had followed the very same track as mine. 9 Gager, CT 175: “Among the surviving defixiones, one distinctive category may be labeled as pleas for justice and revenge. H. Versnel, in a recent treatment, calls them judicial prayers for help from the god and argues that they belong to a category quite different from curses on metal tablets”. 10 Ogden 1999: 37–44. On p. 37 he states: “Prayers for justice constitute the most distinctive category of curse tablets”. The same formulation can be found in 2002: 219. Although at 2002, 7 he calls them “the slightly distinct prayers for justice”, in Chap. 10 he groups “Binding curses: law, competition, and trade” in one section (nos. 168–84), and “Prayers for Justice” in a separate section of their own (nos. 185–91). 11 Audollent in DTAud p. lxxxix distinguished four categories of defixio which only partly coincide with this classification: 1. litigation; 2. to obtain the recovery of stolen objects; 3. love-magic of all types; 4. competitions (circus-racing); on the following page, however, evidently under the influence of the Cnidus tablets, he groups (2) with attacks on calumniators and gossips. This is no doubt because at that time very few clear ‘judicial prayers’ had been successfully read, so there was little reason to assign them to a separate category. Nevertheless on p. xci he seems to revert to his initial classification, observing that defixiones against thieves are mainly found in Asia (he was thinking of Tell Sandahanna in Palestine), Britain and Spain. 12 See my discussion on pp. 324–27 below."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"278 henk s. versnelhas now gained a solid foothold in German scholarship.13 That makes it all the more regrettable that some of the authors seem to have little idea of the origin of the term or what it implies,14 which on occasion leads to a seriously flawed representation of what I understand by it.15 For both these reasons, then, I welcome the present occasion to clarify matters with the aid of the rich epigraphic harvest of the last fifteen years.1. DefinitionI define ‘prayers for justice’ as pleas addressed to a god or gods to pun-ish a (mostly unknown) person who has wronged the author (by theft, slander, false accusations or magical action), often with the additional 13 E.g. ‘Vorwort’ to Brodersen and Kropp 2004, 7; Scholz and Kropp 2004, 38; Kropp 2004, 85. 14 It is also possible to show knowledge of the literature and yet present others’ ideas as one’s own: for example H. Ménard, Le vol dans les tablettes de la Bretagne romaine, RHD 78 (2000) 289–299, first briefly mentions the new interpretation pro-posed by Tomlin, Gager and myself, then discusses the motif of theft in the British curses (adding almost nothing to the detailed survey of theft, thieves and other topics by Tomlin 1988, 79–81), and finally presents as her own the idea that the “dénomi-nation de defixiones, stricto sensu” is to be rejected and “celle de prières juridiques semble dès lors plus appropriée”.15 Let me take as an example P.-Y. Lambert, Defining Magical Spells and particu-larly defixiones of Roman Antiquity: A Personal Opinion, in Brodersen and Kropp 2004, 71–80. Although he accepts that my category “offers a completely renewed analysis” (p. 79), he seems to believe that I combine the categories of “judicial spells” and “spells against thieves”. In fact, petitions against thieves represent the bulk of the texts in my category ‘prayers for justice’. He also singles out “the possibility of atone-ment and forgiveness” as the main criterion for distinguishing between defixiones and ‘prayers for justice’, an emphasis that fails to do justice to the range of distinctions I advanced in 1991 (cf. pp. 279f.). Nor is this feature present in all such prayers. (On his equally misguided classification of the prayers as vows, see the Appendix to the present article). To take a second example, Kropp 2004, 84f. contends that, even acknowledging the special nature of the ‘prayers for justice’, there is still an ele-ment common to all these texts (“eine zumindest genetische Einheit”), namely “die sprachliche Reflexion des ‘Bindezaubers’—in den Verben wie ligare usw.—” and in certain ritual procedures, such as the use of lead-tablets and their manner of deposi-tion, where these can be established. The truth is that the term/notion ligare vel sim. is one of the important tests for distinguishing between defixiones proper and the ‘prayer for justice’. Neither the use of lead nor the mode of deposition is a constant. One of the causes of all this confusion is that, although my major study of 1991 figures in the collective bibliography, the actual references, when given, are all to my earlier essays (Lambert cites Versnel 1985 and 1987 only; Kropp cites no article of mine. But see now her far more nuanced, important exposition in this volume). For that matter the entire book, besides other shortcomings, shows marks of haste and (hence?) of care-less and inaccurate references, phrasing and composition."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 279request to redress the harm suffered by the author (e.g. by forcing a thief to return a stolen object, or to publicly confess guilt).16 The great majority of defixiones as brought together in the standard collections such as DTAtt, DTAud, SGD I and II, lack such appeals to divine jus-tice and are clearly of a different nature, most conspicuously in that 1: the submissive and deferential tone of the prayer is lacking, and 2: no explicit motive is advanced in justification. Whenever prayers for justice are found in some concentration, the site is not a grave, as it so often is in the case of defixiones, but a sanctuary of a (mostly but not invariably) chthonic deity.17 A significant part of my evidence comes from two such sanctuaries, the temple of Demeter at Cnidus in Caria (I.Knidos nos. 147–159) and the sanctuary with the hot springs of Sulis Minerva at Bath.18At this point, I reproduce from Versnel 1991, 68 the list of formal characteristics that seemed to me typical of the prayer for justice as opposed to the defixio proper.19 The central point is that they are all cases in which the principal has been wronged by someone, or some persons, whose identity is generally unknown. The other typical fea-tures are:1. the principal states his or her name2. some grounds for the appeal are offered; this statement may be reduced to a single word, or may be enlarged upon3. the principal requests that the act be excused or that he be spared the possible adverse effects4. gods other than the usual chthonic deities are often invoked 5. these gods, either because of their superior character, or as an emollient gesture, may be awarded a flattering epithet (e.g. φίλη) or a superior title (e.g. κύριος, κύρια, or δέσποινα)16 From this point, I cease to place inverted commas round the term prayers for justice.17 A spring or well may be involved—as at Bath—but is by no means indispensable, as the cases at Cnidus, Acrocorinth and Mainz demonstrate. Individual prayers for justice have however been discovered in graves. 18 Due to the prolonged production process of Faraone and Obbink 1991, Tomlin’s invaluable edition of the Bath texts (Tab.Sulis) reached me only after I had sent in my contribution. In looking over my correspondence with Tomlin on the manuscript of my article, I find that already in April 1987 the editors had strictly disallowed any additions or alterations to the text, even including Tomlin’s pertinent and revealing correction of tuas into duas in the curse from Italica (AE 1975: 497 = Versnel 1991, 60).19 For a useful summary of these differences, see now also Faraone, Garnand, and López-Ruiz 2005, 170–175."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"280 henk s. versnel6. words expressing supplication (ἱκετεύω, βοήθει μοι, βοήθησον αὐτῷ) are employed as well as direct, personal invocations of the deity7. use of terms and names referring to (in)justice and punishment (e.g. Praxidike, Dike, ἐκδικέω, ἀδικέω, κολάζω, and κόλασις). In subsequent papers (Versnel 1998; 2002) I discussed some further features of prayers for justice. In contrast to defixiones proper, their tone is often markedly emotional. This may be manifested in harsh terms of abuse, and especially in the cursing of (extended) lists of body parts (“from top to toe”)20 that are to be afflicted, thus causing the target to suffer, waste away and even die.21 Another recurrent trait of 20 This feature is practically restricted to this type of prayers. In the defixiones we find only one expression that is comparable, namely “the three hundred and sixty-five limbs”, which not surprisingly occurs only in curses against foot-racers. There is one from Egypt (Suppl.Mag. II 53, 14, with ample commentary on the number 365); one in Coptic in PGrM IV 149f.; it is also recognized in a defixio from Syria (DTAud 15, 18) on which see D. Jordan, Magica Graeca Parvula, ZPE 100 (1994) 321–22, and recently in a tablet, again from Egypt (R.S.O. Tomlin, ‘Remain Like Stones, Un-running: Another Greek Spell Against Competitors in a Foot-race, ZPE 160 [2007] 161–166), with the formula “Bind their feet, sinews, legs, spirit, excellence, the three hundred and fifty-five (sic) limbs of their bodies and souls, that they may not be able to proceed in the stadium, but remain like stones, unmoving, un-running.” A small number of prayers for justice make mention of the rack as an instrument of torture, a clear testimony of their punishing nature. D. Collins, Magic in the Ancient Greek World (Oxford 2008) 85, erroneously assumes that afflicting all the body parts (top to toe) in my view should—like the rack—be an imitation of penal codes or practices as well (and since we do not find such practices in official justice he rejects my thesis). This of course would be as absurd as tracing the roots of magical infliction of illness or fever in our curses (as in Bath or Knidos) back to the practice of penal law. They are personal expressions of the ‘legitimate’ wish to hurt (= to punish) the target in at times very imaginative ways. Nor is the fact that lists of body parts also appear in spells that serve other purposes than punishment, as for instance in a Coptic (!) spell to protect a woman in childbirth (so Collins ibid.), a valid counterargument. Naturally there are other types of spells in which the complete body may be functional. But who would contest that ‘binding’ is the most specific characteristic of the malevolent defixio on the ground that we find the same notion in benevolent spells for the healing of a bone fracture? My point is that within the category of malevolent curses (with the—understandable—exception of the athletic curse just mentioned in this footnote), it is only the category of the ‘anatomical curse’ that displays also other features typical of the ‘prayer for justice’. 21 These “anatomical curses” are also typical of erotic spells of the “Herbeirufungs-zauber” type. I therefore argued that the latter also belong to the category of prayers for justice. Ivana Petrovic, Φαρμακεύτρια ohne φάρμακον. Überlegungen zur Kom-position des zweiten Idylls, Mnemosyne 57 (2004) 421–444, has applied this insight to Theocritus’ second Idyll and succeeded in explaining some aspects of the poem that have so far not been properly understood."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 281prayers for justice is that they often seem happy to publicise both the complaint or accusation and the intervention requested on the part of the divinity.22 Needless to say, not all these seven features occur in every prayer for justice. Some may even be found in what otherwise seems to be a straight defixio. I have always insisted that there is a border-area where the prayer for justice overlaps with the straight or typical defixio (Ver-snel 1991, 64–68, and see below). In contrast to prayers for justice, conventional ‘competitive’ (Far-aone) or ‘binding’ defixiones are intended to neutralise (= paralyse) competitors’ ability to worst the principal (or his interests) in some subjectively important competitive situation, as we can see in the curses concerning athletic or circus competitions, litigation, business/com-merce, and in the context of so-called ‘Trennungszauber’, intended to knock out a rival in love. Whenever they mention body parts, these almost always list a selection of specific limbs and physical/intellectual functions appropriate to the occasion. The neutralisation (= paralysis) of these bodily and/or psychological functions is purely instrumental, 22 There is reason to believe that prayers for justice were sometimes publicly dis-played in the sanctuaries. Some of them were not rolled up (Cnidus) or have holes obviously intended for suspending the tablet. The fact, for instance, that a curse from Emerita (see n. 38 below) was written on marble may indicate that it was meant for publication. The one round hole in the top centre of the bronze tablet cited on p. 285 below may indicate the same. In relation to curses against thieves, Faraone, Garnand, and López-Ruiz 2005, 171, urge: “The formal language of consecration and dedica-tion in all of these Greek curses suggests that these tablets were publicly displayed in a sanctuary like other dedicatory inscriptions”. Recently Chaniotis 2004, on the basis of my comparison of the πιττάκιον delivered to the sanctuary of Men Axiottenos (BIWK 6) by Artemidoros (in his defence against slander) with the Cnidian prayers for justice, emphasized that, by contrast with the secret manipulation of curse tablets, the whole ritual of the pittakia and the priestly assistance in the confession texts is demonstrably an entirely public affair. It is however certain that, at any rate in the West, these prayers were not always intended to be displayed: the Bath curses were thrown into the crevasses where the hot spring water emerges; those from Mainz (cf. below no. 3.1.2.2) were supposed to be ritually melted in the sacrificial fire; a few stray finds were found in wells or in graves. I have discussed the range of possibili-ties in Versnel 1991, 81; more extensively in 2002, 68–72, with earlier literature on this much-debated issue; see also Tomlin’s remark earlier in this volume: “They were not intended for the thief to read, but for the deity” (p. 250); specifically on the Bath tablets, idem 1988, 101–5. For the prolonged discussion concerning the status of the Cnidus texts, see DTAud p. 5 (noting Newton’s self-contradiction on the matter) and I.Knidos p. 85. Ogden observes forthrightly: “The Bath tablets were all prayers for justice, to the making of which no shame or danger attached” (1999, 59). Note too his formulation at pp. 83–85 of the contrast between defixiones (always secret) and prayers for justice (often publicised)."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"282 henk s. versnelin rendering the opponent(s) (who, in the case of chariot-curses, include named horses) unable to oppose the principal in the specific area of competition. In these contexts it is rare to find the wish that the opponent suffer (let alone die).23 2. AimsThe proof of puddings is in the eating. A considerable number of curses that present features of what I call prayers for justice have come to light since my 1991 paper. What is more, among the total amount of new lead tablet texts the category under discussion is strongly re -presented in both Greek and especially in Latin speaking areas. This offers an ideal opportunity of putting the theory to the test: do these curse-texts, which were unknown to me when I wrote my earlier pub-lications, display the features that I listed above? Do they individually display a representative set of these characteristics?24 The primary aim of this paper is to answer this question. A second objective is to show once again that, by recognising an individual curse text as a prayer for justice, we may be able to clarify or explain passages that would otherwise remain obscure. The value of such a recognition is still not always fully appreciated by editors of new texts.23 With the exception of course of gladiators, whose job it is to die. M.W. Dickie, Magic in Classical and Hellenistic Greece, in: D. Ogden (ed.), A Companion to Greek Religion (Malden-Oxford 2007) 357–370, ad 362–3, believes that Faraone’s widely accepted interpretation of the defixio as an instrument of (social) competition can be refuted by a reference to curses that aim to kill the victim, as collected by C. Maggidis, Magikoi Katadesmoi or Binding Curse Tablets: A Journey on the Greek Dark Side, Miscellanea Mediteranea 17 (2000) 83–100, espec. 98 (non vidi). He tries to smooth over their extreme scarcity inter alia by adding a reference to the curse from Pella (below no. 3.3.7), but is unaware that these ‘deadly’ curses including the one from Pella do not belong to the (competitive) defixiones but are typical of the prayer for justice and the erotic curses related to this category. In Dickie 2001, too, he ignores the discussion over this new taxonomy.24 This implies that defixiones that refer to the targets simply as inimici or ἐχθροί vel sim., such as one of the curse tablets from Emporiae (ILER 5916 = Solin, Ostia no. 25 = IRC 3: 175 = HEp 1994: 447; see J. Curbera, ZPE 110 [1996] 292–4, late Iª), or contain strong terms of abuse without further details, such as the defixio from Tiriolo, Sicily (M.L. Lazzarini AION( filol) 16 [1994] 163–9 = SEG 44 (1994) 844: IV–IIIa) μυσαρά, ψυχρά, μ[ι]σετά (on which terms see: E. Dettori, Annotazioni sulla defixio di Tiriolo, ZPE 119 [1997] 132–134), do not qualify for discussion."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 283My third aim is to caution scholars against proposing an interpreta-tion of Latin curse texts without consistently consulting the relevant Greek evidence (let alone without knowledge of Greek). As Chaniotis 2004, 9, puts it: Studies dedicated to a phenomenon in a particular region sometimes tend to overestimate its singularity; these texts (i.e. texts from Greece, Britain and Asia Minor) remind us that despite some particular fea-tures. . . . the ideas concerning divine justice circulated widely in the ancient Mediterranean (and beyond).I can illustrate the importance of the second and third points by means of a couple of examples taken from my earlier work. First, a curse that was known to me before my 1991 paper, but to which I could then only refer briefly.2.1. Curse from Claudia Baelo, southern Baetica (AE 1988: 727, second half Ip–early IIp) This text was found in 1980 and brought to my attention by its later editor P. Le Roux prior to its publication in 1988.25 Its value for my purposes here lies in the fact that its interpretation greatly profited from the insight that it was a prayer for justice and contains elements well known from other texts. As a matter of fact, without knowledge of some distantly related Greek texts, two curious—indeed unique—expressions would not have been correctly understood.26 I here cite the text substantially as given by the first editors: Isis Muromem tibi conmendo furtu(m) meu(m) mi fac tu{t}o numini ma(i)es- 5 tati exsemplaria ut tu evide(s) immedi- o qui fecit autulit aut (h)eres: opertor(i)u(m) albu(m) nou(um) stragulu(m)10 nou(um) lodices duas me(o)? usu. rogo domina25 J.N.

The goddess is addressed as “mistress” (domina) and asked per maiestatem tuam (twice) to punish the theft. The verb is not the common vindicare, but reprindere (=reprehendere), to convict, pass judgement on.28 All this is clearly consistent with the usual practice and terminology of judicial prayers. Accordingly, the editors declined to call this a defixio, preferring the notion supplicatio. There remained, however, two enigmatic expressions that are unpar-allelled in the Latin texts of this type. First, fac / tu{t}o numini ma(i)es/tati exsemplaria (ll. 3–5). The term exemplarium does not occur in any other Latin defixio or prayer for justice,29 but it does occur several times in so-called confession stelai from Asia Minor.30 In these cases it is found as a loanword from Latin in a formulaic expression: “I advise (the reader) not to disdain the gods, for he shall have the stele as warning (ἐξενπλάριον)”.31 In this type of religious mentality we often find the wish that the god should make an example of the culprit by 27 Tomlin provides a useful commentary, and translation, elsewhere in this volume (pp. 258–60, no. 3). In l. 4, read tuo for tuto (accepted by Tomlin). In l. 6, evide(s) means evite(s), render lifeless. In l. 8, Tomlin ingeniously reads aute(m) res instead of the editors’ incomprehensible aut heres, and convincingly interprets me(o) uso (l. 10f.) as de uso = de usu, i.e. “used” as opposed to new clothes. The combination of numen and maiestas, also prevalent in other curse texts, is well-known from the ‘devotio’ for-mula in votive inscriptions of the Imperial period. See: H.H. Gundel, Devotus numini maiestatique eius. Zur Devotionsformel in Weihinschriften der römischen Kaiserzeit, Epigraphica 15 (1953) 128–150. Cf. Á.

It is this close analogy to the text under discussion (and other similar ones) that makes me opt for one of the suggestions proposed by Chaniotis, namely that this is an aretalogical praise of a miracle by Amphiaraos.34 The same expression with an identical function occurs in one of the manumission inscriptions published in P.M.

These features of the text from Baelo thus prove that it, and its congeners in the Iberian peninsula, are related to the texts from Asia Minor or other parts of the eastern and central Mediterranean.382.2. Curse text from Caerleon (RIB 323) The benefits of comparing Latin texts with Greek analogies is still more obvious in the case of a supposed defixio from Wales that had repeatedly been studied without producing a convincing interpreta-tion. This is a small leaden tabula ansata that was found in 1927 in the arena of the amphitheatre at Caerleon (= Isca Silurum, winter camp of legio II Augusta).39 The first attempt at a reading was made by R.G. Collingwood: 36 The commoner expression, at any rate in literary contexts, is in medium (ponere); but our expression ocurs already in Cicero, e.g. cum rem totam in medio posuissem at 2Verr. 1.29; cf. Nat deor. 1.13.37 See pp. 180f. and 183f. above. At 16 l. 16 there even seems to be a reference to a confession of guilt: et dicat se admisisse. See also n. 106 below.

[κ]αρδια[τό]μ|ησον [α]ὠτούς, Κύ[ριε, “Lord, expose them and (. . .) cut out their hearts . . .”.38 I also compared (1991, 91) the curse on a small slab of marble found bricked into the revetment wall of a cistern near Emerita/Mérida: dea Ataecina Turi/brig(ensis) Proserpina/ per tuam maiestatem/ te rogo obsecro/ uti vindices quot mihi/ furti factum est; quisquis/ mihi imudavit involavit/ minusve fecit [e]a[s res]/ q(uae) i(nfra) s(criptae) s(unt)/ tunicas VI, [p]aenula / lintea II,in[dus]ium cu/ius I.

Virtually all earlier interpretations started from the assumption that it is a conventional defixio and must be using some kind of sympathetic magic. The general belief was that the principal was giving an enemy gladiator’s clothing to the goddess Nemesis, and that the owner could only redeem them by losing his life.40 This interpretation involved ta -king tulit to mean “he has worn” or “he has brought”, and redimat to mean “may he procure the release of ”, both of which are strained, though not impossible, translations of the Latin.41 If, however, we take these verbs to mean what they usually do mean in other British lead tablets, that is tulit = abstulit, “has stolen”,42 and redimat, “may he 40 R.G. Collingwood, JRS 17 (1927) 216, and idem, Archaeologia 78 (1928) 158 no. 10, understood tulit as abstulit, and redimat as ‘buy back, redeem’, and thought that the thief or the owner was to redeem the objects placed with Nemesis by dying. This is not very logical because the text concerns stolen objects. A. Oxé, Germania 15 (1931) 16ff., improved the text by reading n[i vita] sanguine suo instead of n[isi fusa] sanguine sua. His translation reads: “Wer sie brachte, möge sie wiedererhalten nur mit seinem Leben, mit seinem Blute”. He imagined the following sequence of events: someone has left his clothes at the wardrobe of a public bath. In the meantime an enemy buried the tablet with the wish to Nemesis that the owner can get the clothing back only by pay-ing with his blood. Without commenting on the precise situation, Preisendanz sug-gested “wahrscheinlich handelt es sich um Verfluchung eines Gladiators durch seinen Todfeind, der die Kleider und Schuhe des anderen der Domna Nemesis schenkt unter Bedingung seines Todes” (APF 11 (1935) 155). R. Egger, Wien. Jahresh. 35 (1943) 99ff. = R. Egger, Römische Antike und frühes Christentum, 1 (Klagenfurt 1962/63) 281–283, generally agreed with these suggestions; without knowing of more recent discoveries, but correctly reading sanguinei sui, he translated: “Herrin Nemesis! Ich übergebe dir Mantel und Schuhe, wer sie getragen hat, möge sie nur dann zurückerhalten, wenn sein Rotfuchs (!) umkommt”. This is the version followed by Solin, Ostia no. 20 and R.P. Wright in RIB 323. All were sadly misled by the provenance inside the amphithe-atre. Even before Egger, H. Volkmann, ARW 31 (1934) 64, had made a start towards a better solution by understanding redimere as culpam redimere, “büssen”. The trans-lation “get back, redeem” necessarily assumes some kind of sympathetic magic, such that the consecration of a person’s clothing to a deity somehow exercises power over the owner as well.41 As Tomlin observes, “Inschriften [werden] falsch gelesen . . . wenn man immer nur das liest, was man zu lesen erwartet” (2004, 15). As a result, “Eine Fluchtafel kann kaum isoliert gelesen werden . . . eine ‘kritische Masse’ [ist] erforderlich” (ibid. 28).42 See H.

The translation will then be: “Mistress Nemesis, I give you (my) cloak and shoes. May whoever stole them not atone (for the theft) unless with his life, with his blood”. This is in fact a case, common among prayers for justice, of ceding the stolen goods to the goddess: the stolen objects have become her possession, she is therefore responsible for them. Redimere is compa-rable to the Greek verb λύω, in the sense of “to ransom, redeem, buy off, atone for”. I was able to offer this interpretation already in 1986, 87, simply on the basis of various types of Greek texts in which the ceding of stolen property to a god is a standard feature of legal or quasi-legal terminology.44 The appropriateness of this notion of ceding goods to a divinity is illustrated by a confession text from Kula (176/7 CE).45 A certain Tatias explains: [Τα]τιας ἀγόρασα [. . .] καταφρονουμέ[νη] ἐξεχώρησα αὐτὰ [Μ]ηνὶ Ἀξιοττηνῷ ἅτινα πράξει ὡς ἂν θέλῃ. “I have bought [----], but having been treated disdainfully, I have ‘ceded’ them to Men Axiot-tenos, so that he can deal with them as he pleases”. The verb ἐκχωρέω used here is, like παραχωρέω, a usual word for legally transferring the ownership of property (LSJ).46 The significance of this formulation is that it makes explicit an idea that is otherwise generally implicit, namely that goods, or property, once ceded, are the god’s to do what he likes with. Taking this as an analogy to our prayers for justice, we can say that ‘giving’ stolen goods or money to the gods is in fact a sol-43 So already Tomlin in the first edition of Tab.Sulis 99 in Britannia 14 (1983) 336 no. 5 “let him recover it with his blood and his life”; at 352 n. 12 ad 5–6, he dismisses Egger’s and Wright’s Sanguinei = ‘Blood-red charger’.44 I expanded the point in Versnel 1991, 79–81; 83; 86; cf. now also Chaniotis 2004, 16–19. We should of course remember that earlier editors did not have the Uley and Bath texts at their disposal. RIB, whose cut-off date for instrumentum domesticum vel sim. was 31 Dec. 1956, contains only seven British prayers for justice. The great flow started when the excavation of Uley began in 1977, and those at Bath were resumed in 1979. At the time of my publications I was familiar only with the curses published in Britannia up to that date (see n. 18 above; Tab.Sulis was published in 1988).

The New TextsI now turn to discuss the relevant finds that have been published since 1991, insofar as they have come to my attention.48 I do not imagine that this survey is exhaustive. Many finds, though sometimes announced years ago, have not yet been published. I have tried to retrieve as many texts as I could, but sometimes in vain.49 I restrict myself to the Greek- and Latin-speaking areas of the Empire. This implies that the Coptic curses of late antiquity are not included, even though many of these curses obviously belong to this category.50 Nor do I include Celtic texts, although a new curse from Dax (France), according to the edi-tors, seems to be of the prayer for justice type.51 Curses in the Oscan language are also excluded, although P. Poccetti has detected a prayer for justice in an Oscan defixio.52 More surprising may be the exclusion of the continuing flow of new tablets from Britannia. Surprising, above all, since the evidence from 47 See Versnel 1991; 2002, 53f.

I wish to express my warm gratitude to David Jordan, Ron Stroud, Angelos Chaniotis, Francisco Marco Simón, and Jürgen Blänsdorf for drawing my attention to new finds and/or sending me copies of their texts and generously permitting me to refer to details. I also thank Blänsdorf and Tomlin for communicating their final drafts to me, and Amina Kropp for putting her bibliography at my disposal. I have not used Ma del Amor López Jimeno, Nuevas Tabellae Defixiones Áticas (Amsterdam 1999) for reasons helpfully summarised in SEG 49 (1999) 313. I would be very grateful for references to new curse texts. 49 I have for example had no success in my attempts to get information about the new curse tablet from Trier, which is announced as being edited by Dr. Lothar Schwinden.

The reason for not systematically listing the new finds regularly published in Britannia, is that, however interesting, they are without exception of the same type as those in Tomlin’s col-lection Tab.Sulis. They simply confirm our interpretation of these texts as prayers for justice, a conclusion we had arrived at independently of one another. I propose to take first the Latin, then the Greek texts. The first cat-egory is sub-divided into those from the Hispanic provinces and those from the Germanies; the second includes seven texts from a variety of sites in mainland Greece.53 3.1. Curse-texts in Latin3.1.1.

Blänsdorf (Ch. six) and M. Piranomonte (Ch. five).54 I therefore omit recent finds or discussions of texts that are clearly straight defixiones, such as J. Corell, Drei defixionum tabellae aus Sagunt (Valencia), ZPE 101 (1994) 281–286. The second of these is a curse against an unknown thief, and the edi-tor rightly concludes that the text “sich dem religiösen Bittgesuch nähert” (286), but there are no relevant details; cf. M.P. de Hoz, Henoteísmo y magia en una inscripción de Hispania, ZPE 118 (1997) 291–294.

First, the expression (which is identical in both the Greek and the Latin texts) “for the benefit of/on behalf of me and my family”. This formula is typ-ical of innumerable prayers and vota, but not of defixiones.60 Secondly, 56 Curbera, Sierra Delage and Velázquez 1999 = AE 1999: 954a,b.

They suggest that the victims may have been Greek-speaking slaves working in the local mines.57 On the correct interpretation of inferi and Greek katachthonioi see the discussion on a funerary curse from Aquileia in SEG 50 (2000) 1036.

Mixtures of the two languages in a single defixio of course do occur (cf. Ogden 1999, 49). A recent example is a judiciary defixio from Lilybaion (SEG 47: 1442, III–IIa), in Greek but with the Roman names in Latin. More curious is a gold amu-let, found recently, which begins with magical names in Greek, then has the request: date salutem et vict{t}oriam, written in Latin using Greek characters, and finally the (Roman) name of the author in Roman characters.

These expressions and the train of thought they attest are alien to the language of conventional binding-curses and are characteristic of prayers for justice. The editors therefore rightly classified this text as a hybrid between a curse and a prayer.61 It thus belongs to what I have called “the border-area”.3.1.1.2. Tablet from Saguntum (prov.

I donate the money to the priest(ess) in return for her services. 61 Curbera, Sierra Delage and Velázquez 1999, 282. More or less the same may be true for the slightly surprising supra. The editors suggest that it is an example of the use of legal language “well documented in magical texts” (p. 283 n. 15).

He therefore took ligo not as “I bind” but as lego in the sense “give”. The donation or legacy seems to be to the god Iao (written Iau). The sum of gold mentioned might be the prin-cipal’s peculium, which has been stolen by a fellow slave; he adduces parallels for the verb accipere in the sense of “take away”, but they are hardly convincing.64 In his excellent discussion of this text (pp. 264–68 above), Tomlin rightly doubts Corell’s reading of l. 1, and suggests that it contains the principal’s name. Instead of rogat et (a)d Iau dat in l. 2, he attractively proposes rogat et mandat. He offers a similar solution for the last line. I reprint his translation here to give a sense of what all this amounts to: Felicio the slave of Aurelianus (?) asks and entrusts the money which Heracla my fellow-slave received from me, that his bosom(?) be attacked, his eye(?) and strength(?), whoever they are [. . .] I entrust the money (?) to the honour of the priest.’We both arrived independently at the conclusion that the whole affair must concern the deposit or loan of the principal’s peculium with the temple, through the offices of the fellow-slave, who can therefore be said to have received it; the implication may be that the intermediary has failed to pass it on or has denied possession. For such a situation and, more generally, for the importance of retrieving a deposit there are many good parallels, some of which I list here:65a. A text from Cnidus (I.Knidos 149): I commit to the gods (. . .) those who have received a deposit (λάβοντας παράθηκαν) from Diokles and do not give it back but persist stubbornly in it (μὴ ἀποδιδόντας ἀλλ’ ἀποστεροῦντας). 64 Moreover, the high value, at least two pounds of gold, surely makes the hypothesis of a peculium extremely unlikely. 65 In his presentation of new material at the symposium, David Jordan mentioned a new tablet from the Athenian Agora concerning a money-lender who did not get his money back and curses the culprit; cf. also SGD I 21. Mainz no. 12, ll. 2f. ut man-data exagatis (see pp. 178f. above) may also refer to the embezzlement of a deposit, if Blänsdorf ’s interpretation “that you require the return of the goods that have been entrusted to them” is correct. That mandata may indeed denote “deposit” receives support from Firm. Mat. 2.63.12: perfidos et qui res commendatas obstinatio mentis furore et avaris cupiditatibus abnegent.

An imprecation in an epitaph from Myrikion (Galatia, II–IIIp):66 Statilia gave, while alive and sane, to someone as a deposit (παραθήκην ἔδωκ[ε]) a green garment (?) and two silver armbands. If he does not return it, Hosios and Dikaios and you, Lord Helios, avenge (ἐκ[δ]ικήσατε) the dead (Statilia) and her living children.c. Inscription from Kula (Maeonia):67 Menogenes son of Lakios (fulfilled his) vow to goddes Aliane.

An inscription from Delos (ID 2531): Accusation by Theogenes against a woman who has cheated him concerning a deposit (αὐτὴ δὲ λαβούσα παρακα[τα]θήκην). Now he prays that she will not escape the power of the goddess (Ἁγνὴ θεά, the Dea Syria) and demands all therapeutai (no doubt the group of those devoted to the goddess, including the sacred per-sonnel of the temple) to slander/calumniate (βλασφημεῖν) her καθ’ ὥραν.68 Perhaps the closest parallel, however, is a curse from Bruttium in S. Italy (DTAud 212, IIIa ?) which has often been adduced in the dis-cussion on prayer for justice.69 I quote a translation of a section of the second part (ll. 9–14):Kollura consecrates (ἀνιαρίζει) to the servants (προσπόλοις) of the god-dess the three gold pieces which Melitta received but continues not to return (ἔλαβε καὶ οὐκ ἀποδίδωτι). Let her (Melitta) dedicate (ἀνθ̣είη) to the goddess twelve times the amount together with a medimne of incense according to the measure valid in the city. And let her not breathe freely until she has dedicated (ἀνθείη) it to the Goddess. The similarity with the Saguntum text in both situation and phrasing is striking. In each case the sum in question has not been stolen, but taken on deposit (for safe-keeping or as a pledge); in each the deposi-tary refuses to give it up. I would particularly stress that, although the culprit is supposed to return the sum to the goddess, in each case the ultimate beneficiary is the goddess’ servant(s).70 The cult personnel 66 Björck 1938, no. 13; M.

The suggestion that the money was a deposit would avoid our having to understand accipere (1.3) in the sense of “steal”. The god is to afflict (instare) or pursue the culprit with bodily afflictions.73 In the last line—if it has been correctly read—one might prefer to explain honori as an honorary gift/legacy with the dative, as in the formulaic expression dono dare.Corell rightly concludes that this is not a normal defixio (“exe-cración”) but a prayer for justice (“plegaria judicial”) according to my definition. Indeed, this is the type of private, quasi-legal cession of goods or money so characteristic of the English texts from Bath and Uley, as well as of Greek texts.74 3.1.1.3.

P. Veyne, La bonne foi de la Terre-Mère (Pétrone, 117.3), Latomus 23 (1964) 30–32, has shown that here fides = depositum, and that Terra Mater, like Mater Magna, specialised in banking activities, including looking after deposits; and that this was the reason for addressing the voti solutio to both the goddess and her priestess: “Confier de l’argent à un dieu, c’était en fait le confier à son desservant” (with other examples). 72 F. Cumont, L’Égypte des astrologues (Bruxelles 1937) 137 n. 2, presents testimo-nia from astrological texts. R. Herzog, Die Wunderheilungen von Epidauros. Philo-logus Supplementband 22.3 (Leipzig 1931), 118 ad no. W 63 (which concerns the reclamation of a deposit), collects a number of literary parallels with complications, accusations and divine interventions with respect to deposits. 73 This must be the general sense, even if Tomlin be right in his criticism of particu-lar details of these body parts. For a possible parallel to ocelus (l. 4), see Anna Perenna no. 7 in this volume (p. 240), where there may also be a parallel to Saguntum’s vires in the virtus of the target person. Sinus may be used in the sense of ‘the seat of the thoughts or emotions’ (OLD sense 5). As for instare (l. 4), persequi is more usual in this type of text, followed by an object (either the culprit or the thing stolen/withheld): Versnel 1991, 83.74 “What the authors of such prayers for justice expected was not (or not primarily) material gain, but moral satisfaction and revenge” (Chaniotis 2000, 15; his pp. 15–21 offer an excellent discussion of the whole problem). Cf. Ogden 1999, 41: “The original owner effectively despaired of recovering the goods for himself, and therefore wrote the curse primarily out of a wish for revenge upon the thief ”."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"296 henk s. versnelAn die Unterweltsgötter; ich beschwöre euch, dass Ihr meinem Gesuch gegen Luxia, Tochter des Aulus Antestius stattgebt, dass die Krankheit ihren Kopf, Herz, Verstand, Gesundheit, Leben und alle ihre Körperteile jeden Tag angreift. Und wenn Ihr die Bitte, die ich mache, erhört, werde ich euch für eure Gunst belohnen.75At least four features of this curse are commonly found in prayers for justice. The most obvious are the verb rogo, “I implore”, and recipi-atis nomen, “accept the accusation”, a technical term used by a pre-siding magistrate to anounce that he would hear the case against a defendant, the nomen being one of those on a written list of cases brought.76 I have already pointed out that anatomical curses with lists of body parts are characteristic of such prayers. The desire that one’s target shall suffer, and suffer intensely, is alien to the normal defixio but usual in prayers for justice.77 There may even be a fifth clue, namely the holes on either side of the tablet.78 Moreover, Maltomini has rightly pointed out that the final phrase et sei faciatis votum quod faccio solvam vostris meritis (l. 4) does not mean “I will reward you as you deserve”, as Corell thought, but: “and if you do (this), I will redeem the vow (votum) that I now make, in accordance with your merits” (Maltomini 1995). This phrase makes clear that we are dealing with a regular votum: vostris meritis actually alludes to the stereotyped formula votum solvi(t) libens merito. As Corell himself remarks, it is 75 Corell 1993 = AE 1993: 1008. Corell 1993, 261 n. 1 lists all the Iberian defix-iones known up to that date. On the linguistic aspects of this defixio, see R. Marina Saéz, Notas linguisticas a una tabella defixionis hallada en Carmona, ZPE 128 (1999) 293–300. 76 Duly noted by Corell 1993, 264, citing Versnel 1991. Note however that the evo-cation of such legal terminology is more or less confined to prayers for justice; it occurs only sporadically in other categories of defixio. 77 Cf. Versnel 1998.

It is however an erotic curse, and thus not relevant to the present discussion, except insofar as the target is to suffer exquisitely. The defigens of the curse from Oropos (3.3.5 below) prays that the victim shall be punished with tortures that are (uniquely) qualified as ἐξαίρετα (“exquisite”). 78 Their significance is however uncertain. Normally such holes would indicate that the tablet had been pinned up so that the text, by contrast with those of straight defix-iones, could be read (Versnel 2002, 56–9, and above n. 22). In this case, however, the borders of the holes bend towards the written side, which may mean that the tablet was displayed, but in such a manner that its text could not be read."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 297highly unusual for straight defixiones to make a conditional promise of this kind.79 3.1.1.4. Curse-text from Salacia (Alcácer do Sal [Setúbal], Portugal, Ip) The tablet was found in 1995 in a “ritual pool”. It is one of a number of recently-published prayers for justice, most notably those from Mainz (see 3.1.2.2 below), that invoke Attis and the Magna Mater. Many of them contain remarkable similes based on elements from the myth and ritual of the cult of Attis. I adopt the text as given by F. Marco Simón (Marco Simón 2004), with the emendations by Tomlin (pp. 262–64 no. 4 above), and adapt my own translation to his new readings. Domine Megare invicte, tu qui Attidis corpus accepisti, accipias cor- pus eius qui meas sarcinas 5 supstulit, qui me compilavit de domo Hispani. Illius corpus tibi et anima(m) do dono ut meas res inveniam. Tunc tibi (h)ostia(m) quadrupede(m) do(mi)ne, Attis, voveo, 10 si eu(m) fure(m) invenero. Dom(i)ne Attis, te rogo per tuum Nocturnum ut me quam primu(m) compote(m) facias. Marco Simón notes that “this tabella belongs to the category of the ‘prayers for justice’ ”. The writing is clear; there are the usual omissions of initial h and acc. m. endings. Provisional readings such as inveniat and done in ll. 8 and 9, which could only be explained as miswritings of inveniam and dono, as well as some others, have been ingeniously and convincingly emended by Tomlin. In l. 1, the word MEGARE requires discussion. The first editor took it to be the name of the daughter of Creon, king of Thebes, i.e. Megaira.80 On the assumption that it is in fact a version of μεγάλε, “great” (nom. fem.), Marco Simón offered two possible interpretations.81 On the one hand, Domine Megale invicte might be an invocation of Cybele, 79 “Es ist höchst ungewöhnlich, dass der defigens Bedingungen stellt”, Corell 1993, 266. For vota in curse texts see the appendix to this chapter. 80 J.C.L. Faria, Alcácer do Sal ao Tempo dos Romanos (Alcácer do Sal 2000).81 Greek terms sometimes occur in curses connected with the cult of Attis (e.g. 3.1.2.1–2 below)."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"298 henk s. versnelwho is so closely connected in the cult with Attis. On the other, the consistent use of the masculine form in the vocatives, as well as in the subsequent relative qui, clearly implies a male god. Marco Simón sug-gests this must be Hades/Pluto, the god of the Underworld. I find this convincing. Tomlin, however, offers “Lord Megarus” (i.e. Lord of the Megaron, a term that occurs in one or two of the Mainz curses), which also merits serious consideration. In l. 6 I hesitantly follow the earlier editors in interpuncting between Hispani and illius, taking Hispanus as a personal name or as a descriptive adjective, “the Spaniard”, i.e. the owner of the house where it all happened, and illius as referring to the thief.82 I therefore translate:Lord, great and invincible, you who have received the body of Attis, please receive the body of the one who took away my baggage, who robbed me (by stealing it)83 from the house of Hispanus (or ‘the Span-iard’). His body (viz. the thief ’s) and his soul I give (you), I confer on you in order that I may find my possessions. Then I vow to give you a four-footed sacrificial victim, Lord Attis, if I find that thief. Lord Attis, I implore you by your Nocturnus, that you make me obtain my wish as soon as possible. Of the many interesting points here, I mention only those of immedi-ate relevance to my subject.84 It is Attis’ descent into the underworld that provides the analogy for what the thief is to undergo. In my view, the text clearly differentiates between the act of ceding the thief to the god and the vow to offer a sizeable victim.85 The thief is ‘given’ body and soul to the great god of the Underworld, who is asked to 82 Tomlin ad loc. however suggests taking Hispani with illius, i.e. the body and soul “of that (wretched) Spaniard”. 83 I believe this to be the meaning, since “to steal from a dwelling” is a common expression in this type of curse, e.g. . . . quod illi de hospitio Lon[. . . invol]averint (AE 1984: 623 = Britannia 15 (1984) 336 no. 7, Pagan’s Hill, Somerset); qui Deomorix de hos{i}pitio suo perdiderit (Tab.Sulis 99 l. 2f.); me perdidisse rotas duas . . . de hospitiolo meo (AE 1992: 1127 = Britannia 23 [1992] 310f. no. 5, Uley); quicumqu(e) illam invo-lasit [sic] (. . . .) de hospitio . . . (AE 1993: 1087 = Britannia 24 [1993] 311–314 no. 2, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Notts.).84 Marco offers several suggestions for the enigmatic per tuum Nocturnum: the link between the Megalensia and night-time; Attis’ connection with the moon (Meno-tyrannus), and with the Underworld (which is anyway thematised here). He inclines to take Nocturnus as a netherworld demon (rather than Pluto) who is lower in the subterranean hierarchy then Attis himself. See also p. 307 below. I wonder whether Nocturnus might not be the same as the great God of the dead invoked at the begin-ning of the text?85 I discuss this distinction at greater length in the Appendix."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 299“receive /accept/take” the body just as he once received that of the dead Attis. This comes very close to the notions behind πέμπω δῶρον and the requests that the gift be accepted (δέξασθε etc.), that I discuss in the Appendix; indeed they may be taken as one more argument for taking πέμπω δῶρον in the sense proposed there. The δῶρον is the victim.86 In a parallel move, Attis himself is promised a sacrificial ani-mal if he make it possible for the principal to find the thief. This idea is expressed in a regular votive formula (voveo . . . me compotem [voti] facias).87 The target is first “given, donated” to one god, and then—quite independently—a second gift is promised to a different deity. The latter is explicitly a sacrificial animal (victima, hostia) of some size and therefore value (a quadruped as opposed to a chicken vel sim.). Something similar seems to be implied by one of the new curses from Mainz. Unfortunately the crucial passage is less explicit: (. . . .) in megaro eum rogo te, M(a)t(e)r Magna, megaro tuo recipias, et Attis domine, te precor, ut hu(n)c (h)ostiam acceptum abiatis et quit aget aginat, sal et aqua illi fiat.88 The pattern seems to be the same, but it is not quite clear whether the hostia for Attis refers to the target or to a separate animal-sacrifice. In favour of the latter hypothesis is the divi-sion of tasks between the deities involved, which is the same as in the Setúbal and the Johns Hopkins curses; and perhaps also the pronoun hunc, which is perhaps more likely to refer to a victim at hand rather than to an absent human target. On the other hand, the first option finds support in the fact that immediately after the hostia-phrase the text speaks of the fate of the human victim. Another argument might be that hunc ought to refer to the (male) target: Blänsdorf stresses this point in his interpretation elsewhere in this volume: “The petitioner then asks Attis to receive Adiutor as a victim, just as he accepts the sacrificial victim that accompanies the curse: te precor ut hu(n)c (h-)ostiam (not hanc!) acceptum habiatis (ll. 4–6)”. We are confronted with the same problem in a late first-century BCE text from Rome: Danae ancilla no<v>icia / Capitonis. Hanc hostiam / acceptam habeas / 86 As Marco Simón points out (2004, 83 n. 7).87 The same sequence is found in the Johns Hopkins curse discussed in the Appen-dix (Text 5): first, the target of the curse is “given” to Proserpina and then three vic-tims are vowed to Cerberus. They are also specificied as quadruped.88 No. 8 in Blänsdorf ’s paper in this volume (p. 174) = no. 20, inv. nr. 111,53 in Blänsdorf 2009."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"300 henk s. versnelet consumas Danae/ne(m).

Even so, it is worth noting that in the two texts (Setúbal and Johns Hopkins) where the distinction between the human target and the hostia as a sacrificial animal is beyond doubt, the latter is described as a votum for the future, whereas in the other two (Mainz no. 8 and Rome) the hostia is described as already in the hands of the god. Given that the idea of offering a hos-tia/victima to a deity is formulaic, it is perfectly possible that different principals had different practices, or different interpretations of similar practices. 3.1.2.

In A l. 2 we find a transcription of a Greek term in duodeca theum, in which we should recognise Greek dodekatheon, the Twelve Gods.92 The editors do not explain their translation of iniurium fas (“mein ungerechtes Schicksal”?) in A l. 3. We might consider separating the two words and read iniuriam (instead of iniurium) as sole object of 91 The editors comment here: “der als deus maximus ausdrücklich mit dem Göt-tervater Iupiter gleichgesetzt wird”. I doubt this is the correct interpretation. In hymns and other cult-texts of this period, especially the Orphic hymns, the marked tendency towards henotheism allows any god to be called “greatest”. There need be no presump-tion of an identification with Jupiter. We might compare an inscription from Rome: ῎Αττει ὑψίστῳ καὶ συνέχοντι τὸ πᾶν (CIL VI 50), which is not an identification with Zeus, cf. Versnel 1990, 35–7 etc. For Asia Minor see: Chr. Marek, Der höchste, beste, grösste, allmächtigste Gott. Inschriften aus Nordkleinasien, EA 32 (2000) 129–146. Cf. also the current discussion on the notion of hypsistos theos, prevailing especially, but not only, in Asia Minor. See the survey in: W. Wischmeyer, ΘΕΟΣ ΥΨΙΣΤΟΣ.

Frede (edd.), Pagan Monotheism in Late Antiquity (Oxford 1999); Mitchell & Van Nuffelen forthcoming. 92 Interestingly, two inscriptions from Maeonia (Lydia/Phrygia) present the same term dodekatheon in the sense of the divine company of one major god. One is a funeral inscription from Saittai (Strubbe 1997, 46–47, no. 51), the other a votive inscription for Men Axiottenos and “the Dodekatheon which is located next to you” (H. Malay, A Praise of Men Artemidorou Axiottenos, EA 36 [2003] 13–17). Chaniotis forthcoming, connects this with two confession inscriptions, which suggest that Men was conceived as a god presiding over a council of gods. I would add that this reminds us of the divine councils accompanying a central great god as we see them in Near Eastern religions (E.T. Mullen, The Divine Council in Canaanite and Early Hebrew Literature [Cambridge Mass. 1980]) but also in the Cnidian and other curse tablets."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"302 henk s. versnelcommendo, on the analogy of tibi conmendo furtum meum in the curse from Emerita discussed above (p. 286). The expression fas ut might then mean “(It is) right, just, according to divine law that you . . .”. However, apart from the fact that this has no parallel in curse texts, fas ut is no less idiosyncratic Latin than what the editors propose. Might perhaps fas be a writing error for fac, thus giving fac ut me vindicetis?93 The editors also admit that their interpretation of the end of side B is highly doubtful (“Eine zufriedenstellende Interpretation dieser Pas-sage scheint kaum möglich zu sein”): both vocabulary (gens as pejora-tive of “Leute”, tremente = geil?) and syntax (ablative absolute, which is rarely if ever attested in any other curse text) puzzle them. Unclear, too, are the phrases with nubere (l. 4f.) and errare (l. 7). These latter terms must contain the burden of the principal’s complaint, the act by which Priscilla has roused her anger and which must be avenged by the Deae. As the editors say, this is clearly “ein Eifersuchtsdrama”, a quarrel over a man. We may note that, as in the previous text from Setúbal, the prayer is addressed to Att(h)is (and the dodekatheon), but that the case itself is committed (commendo) to “the goddesses” (i.e. avenging deities of the underworld, comparable to the Praxidikai of the Greek curses), who are called upon per Matrem Deum to begin their work.94The text thus bristles with problems, but the editors have rendered it more enigmatic than necessary by misunderstanding one central ele-ment in it. They do acknowledge that it is a prayer for justice,95 and argue correctly that the word commendo assigns the case “der numino-sen Macht”, and that the god himself has thereby become the injured 93 Fac(ias) is near formulaic in these curses, e.g. fac<i>atis, ut se plangat; fac ut a me(n)sibus exitum illorum. . . . sit, in two new Mainz texts (Blänsdorf ’s nos. 8 l. 8 and 16 l. 18 [pp. 274, 180f. above]; cf.

Jürgen Blänsdorf, however, after close inspection of the tablet, assures me that this fas is the correct reading, which, of course, is not the same as believing that the author wrote correctly what he had in mind.94 The editors compare the Erinyes in a defixio from Kempten (AE 1958: 150): 2004, 38.95 E.g. “eine quasi-juristische Bittschrift” (2004, 38); “sie stellt eines der auf dem europäischen Festland selten entdeckten Exemplare der sogenannten ‘Gebete um Gerechtigkeit’ dar (tatsächlich stehen den über 200 Exemplaren aus Britannien nur etwa 30 aus anderen Provinzen gegenüber)” (2004, 40)."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 303party and now has to take revenge for the injustice done to the prin-cipal.96 However they fail to recognise one of the mechanisms some-times involved in this type of curse-texts. In the first place, the sacra paterna referred to in A ll. 5f.: pe[r] Matrem Deum vestrae {ut} [v-]indicate sacra pater[na] have nothing to do with the accusation that Priscilla has done wrong in marrying. They introduce a new accusa-tion, that Priscilla has committed an injustice against the god(s) them-selves relating to the sacred objects of the sanctuary. This tallies with the change in the object of vindicate. The goddesses(?) are urged “to avenge the ancestral holy objects”. This idea is made still clearer in B ll. 2f.: vindicate numen vestrum magnum / a Priscilla quae detegit sacra. This can only mean: “avenge your great divine power upon Priscilla, who has uncovered/divulged the sacra”. Priscilla is alleged to have vio-lated the ritual or the paraphernalia of the sanctuary. One wonders whether these sacra might not be related to the cistas penetrales in the text from Mainz I deal with below (3.1.2.2). This allegation, especially the nature of the violation, immediately calls to mind the ritual diabolai, “slander-texts”, of which there are sev-eral examples in the magical papyri, but which also occur in defixiones. This is the strategy of launching false allegations of ways in which the target has offended against the deity, especially, as here, blasphemous actions such as divulging ritual secrets and revealing the secrets of the mysteries.97 I first give a few samples from PGrMag as translated in H.D. Betz’s edition: III 5: Prayer to Helios: “. . . and behold your form being mistreated by your opponents, so that you may revenge yourself upon them”. III 113f.: “for these are the people who have mistreated your holy image . . .”.IV 2475f.: “For I come to announce the slander of NN, a defiled and unholy woman, for she has slanderously brought your holy mysteries to the knowledge of men (. . .). It is she, NN, who said ‘I saw the greatest goddess drinking blood’ ”.96 Scholz and Kropp refer to Versnel 1987 (2004, 38), but are not aware of the far more detailed discussion in Versnel 1991. They also quote AE 1982: 448 (Mariana, Corsica), where a goddess is invited: vindica te. . . . This curse-text surprised H. Solin, Arctos 15 (1981) 121f.: “Die Form des Fluches ist eigenartig. (. . . .) Der Verfluchende identifiziert sich sozusagen mit der Gottheit, die ihm helfen soll. Sein Schaden ist zu-gleich der Schaden seiner Gottheit, die er auf diese Weise zwingen und überzeugen will”. I have explained it simply as an example of cession (e.g. Versnel 1986, 85; 1987, 15). 97 For the pre-history of this device in Egypt see e.g. ANET 327 with note b; Graf 1997, 181–184.

These are all prescriptions from Graeco-Egyptian receptaries, but the same technique is used in defixiones:DTAud 188.7–12 (Rome?): παράλαβε Νεικομήδην διώκων. . . . . τόνδε τὸν ἄνομον καὶ ἀσε[βῆ] ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κ[α]ύσας τὸν παπυρῶνα τοῦ Ὠσείρεως κ[αὶ] ὁ φαγὼν τὰ κρέα τῶν ἰχθύων τῶν ἀλαβήτων, “take Nicomedes . . . for he it was who burned the papyrus boat (?) of Osiris and ate the flesh of the alabes fishes”.98DTAud 140.15–18 (Rome, late-antique), where the divinity is addressed: et, [si] forte te seducat per aliqua [artifici]a et rideat de te et exsultetur tibi, vince peroccide [. . .] Praeseticium.DTAud 295.8–10 (Hadrumetum, ?IIIp): a rival charioteer with his horses is surrendered to the god: tibi commendo quoniam maλedixit partouri-entem.

The force of the accusation (which we should assume to be false) is to reinforce the demand that the deities avenge themselves on the culprit. An interpretation of this kind surely provides a satisfactory explanation of this section of the text.The editors note that the curse from Groß-Gera is closely similar—in some respects identical (for instance in the invocation of Atthis Tyrannus)—to some of the curses found in the joint sanctuary of Isis and the Mother of the Gods at Mainz, and presented elsewhere in this volume by Jürgen Blänsdorf. In seven of them the Great Mother is asked to avenge an injustice (in four of them, together with Attis). One of these very interesting curses was published by Blänsdorf already in 2004.100 This is one of my reasons for including it in the present collection. For this version of the paper, Blänsdorf has kindly allowed me to use his English translation.101 I retain my comments from the conference-version, and then comment briefly on some other tablets that are of special interest for my topic (3.1.2.3).3.1.2.2.

It is likely, but not certain, that they are diabolai. An interesting text in some respects related to the diabole appeared on a grave stele of a fifteen year-old boy: Κύριε Παντοκράτωρ, σὺ μὲ ἔκτισες, κακὸς δέ με ἄνθρωπος ἀπώλεσεν· ἐκδίκησον με ἐν τάχι (SEG 50, 1233 (Neoklaudiopolis, AD 237). I follow here the discussion by Chaniotis forthcoming. The stele is inscribed with an appeal to divine justice and revenge: “Lord the Almighty, you have made me, but an evil man has destroyed me. Revenge my death fast!” In order to attract the god’s personal interest in this affair the author made the god the victim of the offender: the murderer is presented as someone who has destroyed the god’s personal creation. Thus his punishment became the god’s personal concern. This is related to the technique of the diabole, with the difference that here the accusation is not based on a false allegation.100 Blänsdorf 2004; it appears again in his paper in the present volume (p. 166f., no. 2). 101 I am deeply grateful to Jürgen Blänsdorf for sending me pictures, texts and his provisional commentaries (to be published in full in Blänsdorf 2009).

Blänsdorf points out the close resemblance to the curses I have already discussed from Groß-Gerau and Setúbal. There is the same emphasis on the majesty of the addressee, in terms such as Tyranne, maiestatem etc.102 In all three prayers to Attis and his circle he is not only entreated per maiestatem tuam, as in the present text, which, as Blänsdorf notes, we find in 102 I doubt, though, whether the use of the term tyranne and the reference to tuum Castorem, Pollucem, which is comparable to the equally enigmatic tuum Nocturnum in the Setúbal prayer (on which see Marco 2004, 88–91), implies an identification with Jupiter (see n. 91 above on deum maxsime)."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 307other prayers and curses,103 but also—and this is unique—by his Noc-turnus, by his Castorem, Pollucem (both Setúbal), and, per Matrem Deum (Groß-Gerau), per cistas penetrales (here). Whatever their pre-cise meaning, the appeal to these ‘auxilia’ contributes to the majesty of the adressee, to the pressure exercised on his person, and so to his personal involvement in the whole affair. This is quite appropriate to the prayer for justice, which is usually marked by a tone of emotional submissiveness. Another characteristic of the genre is the flattering and affectionate language exemplified in the opening word here, Bone, which is literally Greek φίλε. We might compare DTAtt 98 l. 4f.: φίλη Γῆ, βοήθει μοι. ἀδικούμενος γὰρ ὑπὸ Εὐρυπτολέμου καὶ Ξενοφῶντος καταδῶ αὐτούς, “Beloved Earth, help me. It is because I was wronged by Euruptolemos and Xenophon that I curse them”, which is a pure prayer for justice.104 Another interesting term here is iratus, which is by no means com-mon in defixiones, and likewise suggests the god’s personal involve-ment.105 The aim here is no doubt to make the god, as a sort of general supervisor, responsible for the punishment of the culprit. As Faraone has recently put it: “In simple terms, by ceding the stolen goods to the god, the curse retroactively turns a common thief into a blasphe-mous temple robber” (2005, 170). The two wishes, that 1) the god may show his anger, and 2) there shall be no forgiveness or allaying of the divine anger, as here (verso ll. 1–4), belong closely together.106 British curses quite often stipulate that the punishment manifested in 103 E.g. the curse from Emerita quoted above (see n. 38); also Tab.Sulis no. 35: rogo [s]anctissimam maiestatem tuam; 32: dono numini tuo maiestati; apparently also in 33, as well as elsewhere in Britain.104 See for this and other examples Versnel 1991, 65; cf. now also the curse from Pella (no. 3.3.7 below) δαίμονες φίλ[ο]ι.105 Kropp 2004, 85–88, discusses AE 1919: 228, a prayer for justice from Carnun-tum: Quomodo ille plumbus pondus habet, sic et Eudemus habeat vos iratos [. . .]. She comments: “Der Zorn der Götter als gerechte Reaktion auf ein fluchwürdiges Ver-halten ist in den übrigen defixiones nie thematisiert” (88). This was already noted by the first editor R. Egger, Eine Fluchtafel aus Carnuntum, Der römische limes in Öster-reich 16 (1926) 117–156, republished in his Römische Antike und frühes Christentum I (Klagenfurt 1962) 88. 106 As Blänsdorf points out (p. 161), this stipulation occurs elsewhere in the Mainz curses, sometimes in extenso, e.g. his no. 17 ll. 12–6: neque au<ro> neque argento rediimere [sic] possis a matre deum, nisi ut exitum tuum populus spectet. The emphasis on the public demonstration of the target’s guilt (which recurs in Blänsdorf ’s no. 16 l. 14; see n. 37 above) is typical of prayers for justice, e.g. I.Knidos. It reinforces the idea of loss of face (see p. 314 below). Chaniotis 2004, 13 adduces another example of divine punishment in front of an audience: L.R.

On these and other grounds I infer a fairly strong influence from eastern-Mediterranean religious mentalities in the curses from Mainz, though, as Blänsdorf rightly warns us, this does not necessarily imply that the authors themselves came from that area.110 All these features can be added to Inscriptions.

On the double theme of divine anger and inescapable punishment, see Versnel 1985. 110 See p. 164f. above. I have cautiously suggested a Near-Eastern origin for the prayer for justice in general, suggested especially by the allusions to royalty and the deferential mode of address in these prayers: Versnel 1991, 90f. David Jordan (per lit-teras, cf. Versnel 1999, n. 107) agrees. Faraone points out that W. Sherwood Fox, Old Testament Parallels to Tabellae Defixionum, American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literature 30 (1913–14) 111–124, already undertook a more systematic search for parallels with the Near East, and Faraone himself seeks the origins especially in the Canaanite culture (Faraone, Garnand, and López-Ruiz 2005). He particularly empha-sises the gender of the relevant gods: they are nearly all females of the Mother-goddess type, and are accordingly approached in a deferential fashion. I accept the possibility of a Canaanite influence, though this seems to me less obvious in the earliest Greek testimonia of what I have called the border area. For the later curses (British, Iberian and German), in addition to the movement of individuals connected with the army, the vehicle of the oriental elements may have been instructions by priests and other cult personnel.

The remainder of the Mainz curse-textsFor detailed information on the curses from the temple of Isis and Magna Mater in Mainz I refer the reader to Blänsdorf ’s contribution to this volume, to which the numbers below refer. I simply offer a few general notes on issues relevant to my subject. Of the total of 34 tablets, almost twenty are either too lacunate to say much of any value about them or merely contain a series of names. Nos. 1, 6 and 10 belong to this category. Of the others, six lack any formal appeal and merely charge that the culprit is (to be) ‘given’ to the god(s), or express the wish that the target may suffer (nos. 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14). There is one text, which I have just discussed (no. 2), with a proper prayer and without any of the features usually associated with the ‘competitive’ or ‘binding’ defixio. Seven texts begin and/or end with a deferential invocation and plea for help as befits a prayer (nos. 7, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18) or contain some other reference to the active involvement of the god (no. 9) and also contain one or more similes relating to the manner of the suffering to be imposed. They include some hitherto unknown analogies of the usual similia-similibus type: “as salt melts in water, just so may . . .”; “as this lead melts (in fire) just so . . .”; “as I write this in reverse order, so may . . .”. More interesting, however, are the creative similes connected with the cult of Magna Mater as well as Bellona, such as: “just as the Galli cut themselves so may . . .”, or “just as the Bellonarii spill their blood, so. . . .” In the rheto-ric of analogy the simile is a privileged tool, and as such it is a favourite element both in curse-texts and generally in prayers. The mere occur-rence of simile cannot be used by itself as an index of the nature of a curse. Tu qui Attidis corpus accepisti, accipias corpus eius in the Mainz text just discussed (3.1.2.2) is an (implicit) simile in a genuine prayer. Other characteristic traits of the binding defixio, such as retrograde writing, allusions to different types of reversion as instrument of ana-logy (on which see Faraone and Kropp in this volume), expressions Mater Magna and Attis: the texts are basically formulaic, while allowing for individual variation.

Voces magicae and graphic signs associated with magical practice are absent (which is not surprising, given the relatively early date of these texts).Another consistent feature of the Mainz curses is that whenever the reason for the complaint or curse is explicitly stated it always concerns fraud or theft. Two other features are consistent with this. First, we never find an explicit statement that the target is to be bound or paral-ysed in order to prevent him/her from opposing the author in a com-petitive situation, as in defixiones concerned with litigation, athletics, circus or gladiatorial games. Secondly, the harsh and emotional lan-guage of these curses suggests that in each case—perhaps even where there is no direct invocation of a deity—the principal feels wronged by his target and desires revenge and/or retaliation. 3.2. The new tablets from the sanctuary of Anna Perenna (Rome)For the fascinating new texts found in the well of Anna Perenna I again refer to the relevant contribution by Jürgen Blänsdorf in this volume (pp. 215–44). They were found in a late-Roman archaeologi-cal context, and the majority of the texts themselves are demonstrably late as well (late 4th—early 5th c. CE).111 Blänsdorf ’s analyses of the eight legible texts lead him to the conclusion that only some can be classified as traditional types of defixiones (p. 229f.). Nos. 1–4 (partially mutilated) and 6 consist mainly of personal names. No. 5 perhaps con-tains forms of the verb rogare (rogat; ro<go> vo[s] bon <. . .>), which may, according to the editor, indicate a prayer to a good god (as in several of the texts referred to above). Much the same is true of no. 8, which is more extensive but very hard to decipher and interpret. No. 7 is by far the most intelligible and interesting text. Blänsdorf interprets it as a prayer to the Nymphs of Anna Perenna and their angili (angels, divine messengers), who are invoked by their virtus (ll. 2 and 7–9: rogo et peto magnam virtutem vestram [twice]), to take away both of Sura’s eyes, in order that the virtus of the arbiter may not persist (ne possit durare virtus arbitri).112 The target was evidently the assistant of a judge. Blänsdorf is certainly correct to say that it contains some 111 Blänsdorf dates no. 8 at any rate to II–IIIp.112 Not, I think, the classic Latin concept ‘moral virtue’ but, as often in curse-texts, ‘physical strength/potency/efficacy’, cf.

Greek Curse-texts3.3.1. Curse tablet from the sanctuary of Palaimon Pankrates (Athens, IVa) Jordan announced his imminent publication of this tablet in SGD II no. 14 but it has still not appeared, so far as I can tell.113 I quote his summary, which mentions most of the details relevant to our present issue.Victims bound down (καταδῶ) πρὸς τ[ὸν Π]αλαίμονα, who is to become their punisher (καὶ δέομαί σου, ὦ Παλαῖμον, τιμωρὸς γένοιο), that they should seem114 to judges to speak unjustly (δικασταῖ<ς> ἄδικα δοκωῖεν λέγειν) . . . For they both do and say unjust things (Ἄδικα γὰρ καὶ ποιοῦσιν καὶ λέγουσι) . . .The term δέομαι, evoking the sphere of prayer, is one indication that this text belongs in the ‘border-area’, in Jordan’s words: “the grey area between forceful operation—the piercing with the nail, the ‘binding down’, backward spelling—and the pious appeal for justice”.115 I note in passing that the term τιμωρὸς γένοιο, “become their punisher”, is as new in Greek prayers for justice as is the expression ut . . . ultionem requirat, “that he demand vengeance” in a curse from Uley (AE 1996: 936).116 The phrase ἄδικα γὰρ καὶ ποιοῦσιν καὶ λέγουσι is a more explicit variant of expressions such as ἀδικοῦμαι γάρ in the prayer for justice (Versnel 1991, 65). 113 D.R. Jordan, A Curse Tablet Addressing Palaimon, in: A. Kalyeropoulou (ed.), Το Ιερόν του Παγκράτου (Athens). I am glad to be able to summarise his interpreta-tions from a draft he was kind enough to send me some years ago, and add just one suggestion.114 Probably not in the sense of “making a false impression (although actually they may speak the truth)”, but rather in the sense of δοκεῖ μοι, “I have the impression, I come to the conclusion, I decide that”. SEG 36: 1575, after Bull.ép. 1987, no. 400, mentions Christian funerary curses of the well-known type of δώσει λόγον θεῷ or ἕξει πρὸς τὸν θεόν, but with one curious expression κακὸς λόγος, which means that the violator will not be able to justify himself before God. This may be distantly related to the expression in the Palaimon curse. 115 Pointing out that δέομαι is a frequent feature of enteuxeis (petitions).116 The closest parallel to ‘punisher’, as Jordan notes, is ὅπως τιμωρηθεῖ in my 3.3.6 (p. 317 below).

He takes the meaning to be something like: so may Aristophanes find you punitive, venge-ful vel sim. because he has been unjust. Since “something must have gone wrong with the writer’s spelling” and the reading is desperately doubtful, Jordan attractively suggests a word like εὔθυνος “corrector, examiner”. An alternative conjecture that I would propose is a form of ἐνθύμιος/ἐνθυμεῖσθαι, meaning ‘lay to heart, ponder’, ‘think much or deeply about’, ‘take to heart, be concerned or angry at’ (LSJ). It some-times occurs with ὀργίζεσθαι. This conjecture receives support from the fact that the word ἐνθύμιον figures in one of the Cnidian curses (I.Knidos no. 150 B 7). An object is lost and the owner ‘dedicates’ it to the goddess. If the finder returns it everything will be fine. But if he does not, or if the object has been sold, then ἐνθύμιον ἔστω ∆άματρος καὶ Κούρας. The interpretation of Blümel, “dann soll (den unehrli-chen Finder) das schlechte Gewissen vor Damater und Kura quälen”, is implausible for both syntactical and semantic reasons. The correct meaning to my mind is “let it be the concern of Demeter and Kore” (cf. LXX Psalm 75 l. 11, where ἐνθύμιον means ‘wrath’).117 The Palaimon text has some characteristics of a litigation-defixio. The only purely formal feature of the defixio is the verb καταδῶ. For the rest stereotyped features of prayers for divine justice predominate. The major difference from the usual legal defixiones is that the author clearly feels that he is justified in addressing his prayer to Palaimon the Hero and asking him to punish his opponents because they are playing a dirty game. This accords with the fact that this is the only curse-text from Athens that has yet been found in a sanctuary, gener-ally the preferred depository for prayers for justice.118 117 And as such it is a good analogue of the final line of the sacred law that Xeno-phon (Anab. 5.3.13) put up by the temple that he had founded at his estate with instructions to any future owner: ΑΝ ∆Ε ΤΙΣ ΜΗ ΠΟΙΗΙ ΤΑΥΤΑ ΤΗΙ ΘΕΩΙ ΜΕΛΗΣΕΙ. For the negative connotation of μέλει cf. Xen. Hell. 6.4.30 where he uses the verb to express the coming anger of the god Apollo in an oracle: ἀποκρίνασθαι τὸν θεὸν ὅτι αὐτῷ μελήσει, with following disaster. Cf. Tac. Ann. 1.73.4, deorum iniurias dis curae.118 Besides Selinus, Cnidus, Morgantina and Corinth, some of whose tablets I dis-cuss in the present paper, Jordan, Hesperia 69 (2000) 95, also mentions Mytilene (three curse tablets: D.R.

Curse-tablets from the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acrocorinth (Roman period) In 1994 Ron Stroud was kind enough to send me the texts of 18 largely fragmentary lead tablets found in the sanctuary.119 It thus parallels the groups known from Cnidus, Bath and Uley. Here again, detailed knowledge of the prayer for justice improves our understanding of the texts.Several of the unpublished texts commit one or more individuals to the gods of the Underworld (once called κύριοι120 θεοὶ καταχθόνιοι, once θεοῖς ἀλειτηρίοι[ς] καὶ θεα< ῖ̣ >ς ἀλειτηρίαις (avenging gods and goddesses) “to destruction” (ἰς κατεργασίαν). In an amatory curse (no. 1) a woman is “bound” (καταδεσμεύω) in relation to one man and all men. A list of her body parts is cursed. In the longest, most legible, and most interesting curse (nos. 8/9) a woman ‘depos-its’ (παρατίθεμαι καὶ κατατίθεμαι) another woman, a garland weaver by name of Karpime Babia to the Moirai Praxidikai ὅπως ἐγδείκ[κ]ωσι τὰς ὕβρ{ι}εις, “so that they may exact vengeance for her insolent behaviour”.121 The author asks Hermes Chthonios and other chthonic gods “by the mighty names of Ananke to destroy her opponent ἀπὸ & R.A.S.

Wünsch published 35 Greek curse-texts written on limestone from Tell Sandahannah (West of Hebron) dating to the second century CE. Though most are too fragmentary to allow interpretation, some are very clear and of particular relevance here, since they are, as Wünsch aptly put it, “imprecations of persons who considered themselves undeservedly wronged, against their enemies, containing invo-cations of a god, with the intent to bring punishment on the head of the offending person” (p. 184). Wünsch also noticed the close relationship with the Cnidian tablets. They contain words such as: βασα[νίσαι], [τιμω]ρίαν γείνεσθαι. This series has not been included in any of the great corpora and I am grateful to Richard Gordon for having drawn my attention to it years ago. One of them, an unmistakable prayer for justice, can be found in translation in Gager, CT 203f. no. 107, and thence in Ogden 1999, 52.119 The find was briefly announced by R.S. Stroud, Curses from Corinth, AJA 77 (1973) 228f. I am grateful to Ron Stroud for sending me the draft of his final publica-tion, with copious commentary (Stroud, forthcoming).

She twice asks Hermes to make her able to con-ceive (καρπίσαι με). This reveals the kernel of the conflict: the garland weaver may have thrown the principal’s childlessness in her teeth.122 Ridicule and loss of face are central themes in ancient society and are thus very much at issue in curses.123Of the eighteen tablets, eight (2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18) are too frag-mentary or for various reasons too enigmatic to permit reliable inter-pretation. One (no. 5) seems to belong to the defixiones iudiciariae in Audollent’s sense, since the word συνίστωρ (witness for the oppo-site party?), followed by three names, can be read. Eight texts (1, 6, 7, 8/9, 10, 13, 14, 16) display one or more features typical of prayers for divine justice: lists of body parts, total destruction of the target rather than binding, avenging gods, humble addresses to gods as “mistresses/masters” or to a ‘righteous’ god, a request to “expose” the culprit. The minimum inference is that all of these concern cases in which the authors considered themselves unjustly treated and have come to ask the god(s) to do justice, punish or exert pressure on the person or per-sons responsible. Stroud rightly concludes that on Acrocorinth, just as at Cnidus and Amorgos (see p. 334f. below), Demeter was considered a goddess who could be appealed to in prayers for justice. These texts are also important as one more example of the local dif-ferences in the otherwise rather standardised vocabulary. The expres-sion ἰς κατεργασ̣ίαν is only known from one other site, the Athenian Agora (see 3.3.4 below). More significantly, whereas all the prayers from Cnidus address the goddesses of the temple where they were deposited, i.e. Demeter and Kore (and other gods with Demeter), as do those in the sanctuary of Dea Sulis Minerva at Bath, those from Acro-corinth, despite their location (the sanctuary of Demeter and Perse-phone), address the gods of the Underworld, the Moirai Praxidikai, 122 On ancient attitudes toward reproductive failure among women: S.

We might compare the fact that the curses I have dis-cussed connected with the cult of Attis, at Setúbal, Groß-Gerau and the temple of Isis and Mater Magna Mater at Mainz, betray a variety of divine adressees. Setúbal first invokes the Great God of the Under-world and then switches to Attis; Groß-Gerau first invokes the “Great-est Attis” but then addresses the appeal itself to the “Goddesses”; that from Mainz addresses Attis alone. An analogous variation occurs within the group from Mainz. In 1997 David Jordan sent me the texts of three unpublished defix-iones, two from the Athenian Agora and one, no doubt Attic, in the Ashmolean. Two of them were in his view prayers for justice. With his consent, I reproduce his notes on the terms and features of these texts that are most relevant to my theme.1243.3.3. Curse against a thief from the Athenian Agora (II–IIIp)τὸν κλέψαντα δέκα ν[ε]ηνάρεια (= δηνάρια). That he may burn in fire. There follows an extended list of body parts.

Note that this curse from Athens contains the expression ἐπὶ κατεργασίαν, which re-appears in the (much later) curses from Acrocorinth.3.3.5. A fragmentary defixio of 50 lines, from Oropos (III–IIa) The true nature of this text was first recognised by Angelos Chaniotis ap. EBGR 1997, no. 296.125 The full text is re-printed in SEG 47 (1997) 510. As the curse is too long to copy here, I give a literal, though slightly abbreviated, form of Chaniotis’ discussion, which sets out the features directly relevant to our issue.126 Someone curses a series of persons (ll. 1, 23, 40, 42, 46: καταγράφω; l. 16: καταγέγραφα; l. 18f.: καταδεσμεύ[ω γεγρ]αμμένου[ς καὶ α]ὐτοὺς καὶ [τὰ] ἐκεί[νων]; ll. 44, 47f.: καταδεσμεύω), willing them to be deliv-ered to Plouton and Mounogenes, i.e., Persephone (ll. 2f., 41f.). The curser binds the bed [marriage-bed?], the tongue, and the actions of his enemies (ll. 20–22: καταδεσμεύω δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν κοίτην αὐτῶν καὶ τὴ[ν] γλῶτταν καὶ τὴν πρᾶξιν), wishing them death and misery (l. 9f.: ἐξολέσειεν πάντας; l. 11f.: ἐκτρῖψαι κακούς, μελέου[ς]; l. 12: τόν τε βίον αὐ[τῶν]; ll. 14f.: οἰκτρο<ύς>, μελέους; l. 30: ἐκ[τρῖ]ψαι τε αὐτούς; ll. 32–35: κακοὺς καὶ μελέους δέξαισθε αὐτοὺς πάντας καὶ μ[ὴ γένοιτο]- αὐτοῖς μηθὲν ἀγαθό, ἀλλὰ κακούς, μελέους; ll. 39f.: δοῖμεν οἰκτρούς, μελέους, ἐπιπόνους, ἀώρο[υς] θανάτους). P(etrakos) suggests that the context is a conflict, which re-appears in these documents, between the principal and various persons connected with the sanctuary concern-ing the melting down of dedications. The most interesting feature of the text is the justification employed by the principal: “I demand that my request be heard, because I have been wronged” (ll. 15f.: [ἀδικο-]ύμενος ἀξ[ιῶ πάντα] ἐπήκοα γενέσ[θαι]); “having been wronged, and not having wronged first, I demand that what I have written down and deposited to you be accomplished” (ll. 25–29: ἀξιῶι οὖν ἀδικούμενος καὶ οὐκ ἀδικῶν πρότερος ἐπιτελ[ῆ] γενέσθα<ι> ἃ καταγράφω καὶ ἃ παρατίθεμαι ὑμῖν;127 cf. l. 10: ἀξιῶ; l. 45: ἀδικούμενος ὑπ ̓ αὐτῶν).

As Voutiras saw, the expression [ἀ]τε[λ]ὴς γάμου also occurs in the following curse from Pella (3.3.7 below). In his opinion it should be understood as “devoid of sexual intercourse”. Unlike the majority of the texts listed here, this is not a pure prayer for justice. It is a borderline case, in that it contains typical defixio language in κατωδῶμεν πρὸς τοὺς χθονίους. The words ὅπως τιμωρηθεῖ, on the other hand, implies that the author(s) feel(s) that they/she have/has been wronged and that hence that they are justified in asking the gods of the Underworld to punish Glykera. I allow for the possibility that, despite the plural number of the verb, the author may be a woman acting by herself: we have here surely to do with a case of amatory jealousy. 3.3.7.

He “dark-ens” the culprit’s various body-parts, from top to toe, either as an act of punishment and revenge, just to torment his target, or in an attempt to thus force the culprit to return the stolen object, two strategies that we have met in the prayers for justice from Bath and especially the ones from Knidos, which the editors rightly and revealingly adduce as parallels. The second motive is the most likely. That becomes apparent if, like the editors, one accepts my suggestion to read the last words of 131 Chr.A. Faraone and J.L.

The expression εἰ (δὲ) μή is common in the mean-ing: “but otherwise,” “but if this does not work. . . .” This is exactly the procedure of some Cnidian curses, where the divine judge is asked to force by torture the culprit to confess guilt and redress the harm done, but ‘if not’, that ‘he will not find the goddess merciful.” One difference from the Cnidian curses is that, the first part of the present curse is addressed to the gods Violence, Fate and Necessity, all of whom occur in other curses, and who all boasted a temple on the Acrocorinth (Paus. 2.4.6–7), while the final and more definitively destructive part is consigned to Lord Chan Sereira Abraxas. Similar shifts between divine addressees, however, do occur in the Setúbal curse (above no. 3.1.1.4) as well as in others. Even more comparable to the present curse is the one from Acrocrinth from Stroud’s collec-tion no. 8/9 (above p. 313), where the culprit is assigned to the Moirai Praxidikai, “to exact vengeance from her,” and where, in the next line Hermes Chthonios and Ge and the Children of Ge, and in the end Hermes alone is asked “by the mighty names of Ananke to destroy her opponent from head to feet”.Another difference is that the first long curse section is phrased as an initiative of the principal himself (“I darken . . .”), which, as the editors note, may evoke an association with the defixio strategy, even if they admit that “our curse . . . displays a number of the important earmarks of a prayer for justice.” The editors put some emphasis on the human contribution, since the gods come into action only if the human curse does not work. Although strictly speaking there is nothing against this interpreta-tion, from a contextual point of view its stringency may be questioned. I suggest three reasons for qualification. First, the total frame of the text is that of the genuine plea for justice: it begins with the registration (καταγράφω is characteristic of this, see below p. 339) of the accused before divine judges, and ends with a prayer for revenge. Secondly, the cursing of a list of body parts, is exclusively restricted to prayers for justice as we have seen. And thirdly, we have seen several prayers for justice in which specific wishes and curses, very much including this anatomical one, are inserted by way of ‘suggestion’ to the avenging deity. After registering the complaint and consigning the culprit to the god, you can continue: “god, may you/see to it that . . .” (nos. 3.1.1.4 [Salacia]; 3.1.2.2 [Mainz]), or “may the culprit/the culprit must . . .” (no. 2.2; 3.1.1.2 [Saguntum]; 3.1.1.3 [Carmona]; 3.1.2.1 [Groß-Gerau]; 3.1.2.2 [Mainz]); many more Mainz curses); or “I give the culprit/the"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 321culprit’s body parts. . . .” (no. 3.1.1.4 [Salacia]). I here take examples from the present collection but all these variants are quite common. Particularly illustrative is a famous curse from Amorgos (cited below p. 334f.) where the ‘suggestion’ in the curse part gradually changes from a request to the god into a private wish in the form of a genuine curse or imprecation.132 Even more relevant is an equally famous prayer for justice inscribed on two sides of a lead tablet from Delos. Already in 1991 I selected it as one of my major testimonies for what I proposed to call the border-line-curse. In my discussion below pp. 332–42, however, I will revise my earlier assessment and give my arguments for taking it as a pure prayer for justice. The editors of the Kenchreai text aptly adduce this Delos tablet as a parallel, and note that its structure tallies with the present one. There, too, we find a deferential prayer for justice to the god on one side, repeated on the other, but followed here by the curs-ing of a very full list of body parts, introduced, just like the accused himself, with the verb καταγράφω, ‘I enroll’. For the reasons mentioned and in view of the close analogy with the Delos tablet I doubt whether the ‘private initiative’ in the expression “I darken” alone suffices to associate this part of the present curse with the defixio, as opposed to “I register/enroll” (in the Delos curse), which is part of the pure prayer for justice. In my view we may range this text among the prayers for justice.4. Conclusions and Further Reflections 4.1. Conclusions to be drawn from the New EvidenceMy main objective in this paper has been to establish whether these fourteen curse texts,133 selected on the basis of occasion (e.g. theft), 132 These ‘suggestions’ belong to what Amina Kropp in this volume labels ‘indirect speech act’, typical samples of which are “hints, insinuations, irony, and metaphor”. These linguistic strategies are usually employed when what is intended conflicts with social convention or the “ordinary conversational requirements of politeness”. In our texts, such speech acts in the request take the form of a wish-clause expressing the negative consequences for the victim. She concludes: “I consider the indirect speech act simply one among several alternative means of formulating the request (Table 1, III.3)”, which is directly relevant to my argument. 133 That is, those singled out for discussion above. If we count the many new curses from Britain, Mainz and Rome (esp. the Anna Perenna sanctuary) which also display such features, we could easily double or triple the total of prayers for justice published over the last fifteen years."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"322 henk s. versnelaim (e.g. vindica) and/or mode of address to the god (e.g. Domine Megare invicte; the use of respectful verbs such as rogo; procedures such as making a vow), reveal a representative set of the features listed in Versnel 1991 as typical of prayers for justice. The reply must be dif-ferentiated. When the occasion for the curse is mentioned, we find: fraud/theft (Saguntum, Setúbal, Athenian Agora 1, Kenchreae), ὕβρις (Acrocorinth), iniuria in connection with marriage (Groß-Gerau), jealousy in love (Kerameikos [?], Pella) or more vaguely ἀδικία (Palai-mon, Athenian Agora 2, Oropus). In all fourteen curses we find either explicitly or implicitly some reference to the idea that the deity is to exact revenge or punishment, or persecute the target.134 Formally speaking, eight of them (3.1.1.2 [Saguntum]; 3.1.1.3 [Carmona]; 3.1.1.4 [Setúbal]; 3.1.2.1 [Groß-Gerau]; 3.1.2.2 [Mainz]; 3.3.2 [Acrocorinth]; 3.3.3 [Athenian Agora 1]; 3.3.4 [Athenian Agora 2]) may be called true prayers or pleas for justice, since they possess several of the prescrip-tive features and lack those that are generally regarded as typical of the competitive/binding defixio, often referred to as ‘magical’.135 The same, not surprisingly, applies to all the curses that have been found at Bath since the publication of Tab.Sulis, as well as those from Uley and elsewhere in Britain. The remaining six cases, as well as some others from Mainz and from the Anna Perenna sanctuary in Rome (espe-cially Blänsdorf ’s no. 7) according to their editors fall into the ‘border area’, that is, the class of texts that contain features characteristic both of prayers for justice and straight defixiones. The term ‘border area’ has proved useful, and will doubtless continue to be so. But I would remark that it is becoming rather too capacious for my liking: the more texts that can be assigned to it, the more we risk losing sight of possibly valuable distinctions and sub-categories. The danger is that it may simply become a convenient dust-bin to save further thought. In three of our ‘border’-texts there is only one word (καταδῶ [3.3.1]; καταδεσμεύω [3.3.5]; κατωδῶμεν [3.3.6]) that evokes the notion of defixio, while in all other respects they are pure prayers for justice. Of two of the ‘border’-texts (3.3.7 and 3.3.8) I have argued that there hardly remains any sufficient reason to range them among 134 In 3.1.1.1 (Barchín de Hoyo) this can be inferred from the words δικαίως/merito. 135 This includes those curses that are basically phrased as a juridical indictment in which the target or the offence is ‘commended’ to the jurisdiction of the god with verbs such as παραδίδωμι, do, dono, commendo, παρατίθεμαι καὶ κατατίθεμαι, ἀνατίθω, καταγράφω.

I shall say something about this issue at the end of this chapter. My second objective was to show that, by recognising an individual curse text as a prayer for justice, we might be able to clarify or explain passages that would otherwise remain obscure. This is indeed the case: difficult aspects of the texts from Groß-Gerau, Mainz, the shrine of Palaimon, Acrocorinth, Oropus, Pella and Kenchreae can be better explained in the light of this distinction. My third goal was to demonstrate the value of consistently compar-ing Latin and Greek evidence. The editors of several Latin texts have been able to propose solutions to problems by invoking our know-ledge of related Greek evidence. See my discussions of the texts from Saguntum, Setúbal, Groß-Gerau and Mainz, that of the diabolai and the appendix on vota. Gratifyingly, then, the specific pattern of the prayer for justice seems to have been validated by the new evidence. It serves to reinforce the claim that the major or specific feature of this type of curse-text is that they are deferential prayers to great gods, to the extent that, if they were not written on lead tablets, many of them would never have been classified as defixiones. As Gudmund Björck observed seventy years ago: “Man möchte sagen, daß der Begriff der Tabella Defixionis nicht so sehr in der Wirklichkeit verankert ist wie vielmehr in Audollents Sammlung” (1938, 112). Prayers for justice are presented as legitimate actions, and justified by the fact that the principal has been wronged. For that reason, they were often put up where they could be seen or read, and were sometimes even “signed” by the author. All these fea-tures are conspicuously absent from the characteristic ‘binding’ defix-iones. Another fundamental feature is that while the latter, as Faraone puts it, “are aimed in a pre-emptive fashion at restraining the victim from competitive or hostile action in the future”, these “prayers for justice” ask the gods to punish someone for a crime or abuse they have committed in the past”.136 While strategies typical of defixiones may be applied in any situation, the strategies of the prayer for justice are strictly—and exclusively—employed by victims of theft, fraud, crime or abuse. We might call the defixio manipulative or even coercive, the 136 Faraone, Garnand and López-Ruiz 2005, 170."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"324 henk s. versnelprayers for justice supplicatory.137 Such a formulation closely parallels David Jordan’s distinction between “forceful operation—the piercing with the nail, the binding down, backward spelling—and the pious appeal for justice” (see p. 311 above).4.2. Appraising the distinctionSo much by way of reiteration. The question is now, what do we gain from this relatively sharp distinction between curse-texts? There are a number of issues here, which I take in order. To begin with: is the dif-ference truly significant? Let me return for a moment to the position of those who prefer to maintain the traditional idea that all defixiones, including the prayers for justice, belong to a single grand class, and are therefore inclined to minimise the distinctions I listed on p. 279f. above. As far as I know, only two recent scholars have explicitly argued in favour of this position, namely Fritz Graf and Daniel Ogden.138 I summarise their arguments briefly, together with my rejoinder.Though he acknowledges the differences between (other) defixiones and prayers for justice type, Graf offers four reasons for thinking that they all in fact belong to a class we may call defixiones. These are: 1. They are written on the same type of material (lead, metal); 2. They are deposited in similar places, namely sanctuaries, pits or wells; 3. They were written for much the same reasons, namely a crisis produced by lack of information concerning past or future; 4. Thieves may also be dealt with by strictly magical means. 137 For his claim that the IVª Athenian curse tablets are not coercive but “if any-thing, [adopt] an approach that is prayerful and supplicatory, Dickie 2001, 21 with n. 35, relies entirely on Faraone 1991, 6. However, he misrepresents Faraone’s argument. Faraone accepts the expression “prayer formula” for the invocatory section (mostly in the imperative), but correctly reserves the notion of supplication for the category of prayer for justice and the border-area (which I introduced in the same volume). The IVp Graeco-Egyptian formularies are a different matter. It would be wise to henceforth follow Amina Kropp (in this volume) to adopt the more general term ‘request’ (on the basis of Searle’s classification of speech acts) for all “attempts to get H [the hearer] to do A [a future act]”. The advantage is that “being neutral in character, the semantics of the term has the advantage of not excluding any kind of communicative setting: the speaker may be in a superior or in an inferior position with regard to the addressee, or the relation may not be asymmetrical at all.” In the context of curse texts the term ‘prayer’ should be reserved for those requests that imply a supplicative hierarchical relationship as is the case in the prayer for justice.138 See Graf 1997, 160f.; idem, s.v. Malédiction, in ThesCRA 3 (2005) 247–70 at 254f.; Ogden 1997, 38f. Dickie 2001, completely ignores both the new taxonomy and the relevant discussion."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 325In my view, none of these really serves to demonstrate the basic unity of all curse tablets.139 1) and 3) are simply too all-encompassing. The first point would equally hold good for certain types of oracles, notably Dodona. More important, as Graf acknowledges (1997, 155), lead was probably used for early defixiones because it already was a common material for epistolary communication in general.140 The third argu-ment (lack of information—crisis) is true of all oracle-consultations141 and prayers of supplication, indeed of votive religion in general. That is hardly a reason for claiming they are all the same. As to 4), there certainly are magical spells for finding thieves (though the evidence is not abundant), but oracles were appealed to for the same purpose.142 However, it is difficult to see the force of this argument (if indeed Graf intended it as such). As for 2), no binding-defixio is to be found in the two large groups of curses found in regular sanctuaries (Cnidus, Bath), only prayers for justice. As far as is known, the same seems to be true of Acrocorinth (with one exception), and of the few texts from Uley published so far. Pits and wells are not decisive: they may be considered, like tombs, to provide a direct passage to demons of the underworld, and hence appropriate to defixiones; but they may equally be thought of as abodes of deities (e.g. Sulis Minerva at Bath; nymphs at various places), and so appropriate to judicial prayers. Which of the two was uppermost in the minds of the authors of curses can only be established—if at all—from the phrasing of the texts. As for tombs, we should not forget that the subterranean realm is both the abode of the dead and the location of supernatural justice and retaliation. That being so, the existence of a border-area should not surprise. 139 I here summarise my counter-arguments from Versnel 1998, 233f. n. 41.140 Letters on lead: B. Bravo, Une lettre sur plomb de Berezan: Colonisation et modes de contact dans le Pont, DHA 1 (1974) 110–187; more recently: D.R. Jordan, A Personal Letter Found in the Athenian Agora, Hesperia 69 (2000) 91–103. The fact that this letter was written by a slave (as shown by E.M. Harris, Notes on a Lead Let-ter from the Athenian Agora, TAPhA 102 [2004] 157–170 = idem, Democracy and the Rule of Law in Athens [Cambridge 2006] 271–279; cf. F.D. Harvey, “Help! I’m Dying here”: A Letter from a Slave, ZPE 163 [2007] 49–50) is another strong argument for its use as a very common writing material. 141 See most recently on this common background of curses and oracles: E. Eidi-now, Oracles, Curses, and Risk among the Ancient Greeks (Oxford 2007). 142 E.g. Epeirotika Chronika 10 (1935) 259 no. 32: ἔκλεψε Θωπίων τὸ ἀργύριον; and other texts from Dodona.

He lists four similarities, of which two are the same as Graf ’s first two points. The two others are: 3, that both types of curses correspond to Jordan’s definition of defixiones as “intended to influence, by supernatural means, the actions or welfare of persons or animals against their will”; and 4, the very existence of ‘mixed’ (i.e. border-area) curses. He adds that there are about as many of the latter as there are ‘pure’ prayers for justice (at that time, 20 and 18 respec-tively). The first of these arguments (no. 3) is disputable, the second mistaken. As to 3), I would note that the central issue is not so much the principal’s conscious intentions,143 as the motives behind these intentions, the types of strategies employed, and the reasons for the choice. It was precisely considerations of this type that induced Jordan to embrace the new taxonomy, his own definition notwithstanding. The second part of Ogden’s fourth point is based on a simple misun-derstanding, since he bases his figures solely on the texts adduced in Versnel 1991. Although I did include most of the border-area texts then known, I presented only a small selection of pure prayers for justice, and made no claim to provide an exhaustive corpus. Some two hundred and seventy prayers for justice have been found in Britain alone.144Moreover, it seems that despite these reservations Ogden in practice accepts my classification, since he goes on to list the criteria that “may be employed towards the construction of a syndrome for prayers of justice” (1999: 38f.):143 This part of Jordan’s definition would equally well fit funerary curses and curses used in oaths, yet we do not include these among defixiones. Moreover, the attempt to equate prayers for justice with defixiones on the implicit grounds that both have negative aims, suffers from a modern High-Church Christian bias, which is supposed to censure such un-Christian behaviour. Ancient practice, including ancient Christian practice, was different, as a glance at Coptic Christian curse-prayers reveals. On justi-fied prayers against opponents in official religion, see: T.S. Scheer, Die Götter anrufen, in: K. Brodersen (ed.), Gebet und Fluch, Zeichen und Traum. Aspekte religiöser Kom-munikation in der Antike. Antike Kultur und Geschichte, 1 (Münster 2001) 47–48; on ‘Gebetsegoismus’ including wishing bad luck to the neighbour or enemy: Versnel 1981, 17–21. Significantly, Greek ἀρά can designate both a positive prayer and a neg-ative-malicious one, in which case it is often translated as ‘curse’: W. Burkert, Greek Religion. Archaic and Classical (Oxford 1985) 73–74; Aubriot-Sévin 1992, 295–401; S. Pulleyn, Prayer in Greek Religion (Oxford 1997) 70–76.144 In view of the fact that all new finds at Bath are also of this type, it would surely be pyrrhonist to claim that the unpublished items from Uley might be different."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 3271. Not binding language, voces magicae etc., but prayer language2. Generally addressed to major or ‘respectable’ deities, albeit with a preference for chthonic deities3. Humility and deference towards the powers invoked4. The target is generally unknown, while the principal usually gives his or her name5. Whereas other curses are supposed to be permanently effective, prayers for justice tend to be conditional and of finite duration.These five arguments largely overlap with the features listed in Versnel 1991 (cf. p. 279f.). Consequently, I am in full agreement with his state-ment “many of the prayers for justice seem to have more in common with ordinary pious religious practice than ‘magic’ ” (Ogden 1999, 39). In the end, he leaves the issue unresolved, but constantly resorts thereafter to the distinction between prayer for justice and binding defixio.145 4.3. The Border-area: preliminary considerationsThere remains however Ogden’s point concerning the existence of ‘hybrid’ texts, which share elements of both defixiones and prayers for justice.146 The argument seems to be that the deployment by a principal in the same text of two strategies indicates, first, that the writers did not see any basic difference between them, and, second, that therefore it is unnecessary for us to do so either. Both inferences, in my view, are misguided, albeit for different reasons.To begin with the second argument: it shows an odd disregard of one of the principal procedures of scholarship, namely the construc-tion of taxonomies.147 If a researcher finds one group of texts within a given class that displays a recurrent set of specific features, and another group which lacks these but exhibits another set of regularly co-occurrent features, it is his or her primary task to define and ana-lyse the differences and to devise an appropriate taxonomy, on the basis of which the contrasting patterns may be accounted for. At this 145 By a slip however he does claim that “a curse from Cnidus uses magic to protect its author (. . . .) against the accusation of it” (1999, 53). Yet he himself has (correctly) said that the Cnidus texts are pure prayers for justice and not magic. 146 I devoted a long section of Versnel 1991 to precisely this group.147 On its fundamental rôle in scholarly endeavour, see the essays in Smith 2004."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"328 henk s. versnelstage, it is unnecessary to be distracted by the existence of a hybrid group. Still less should the existence of such hybrids persuade one of the futility of the entire exercise.148 In the present case the importance of hybrids is that they remind one that 1: this taxonomy is a registra-tion of two contrasting extremes as poles of a continuum; and 2: that such endeavours are both indispensable and unavoidable in the par-ticular academic and epistemological context that we call scholarhip. The late Keith Hopkins made the point many years ago: “as moderns and historians we have no alternative but to use our own concepts and categories to describe and explain other societies”.149 I also subscribe to Snoek’s categorical statement: “It should be clear then, that an emic scholarly approach is a contradictio in terminis. Scholarly discourse is always etic and should therefore be conducted in etic terms”.150 148 Note that without an initial taxonomy we would never even have been aware that there was a ‘mixed category’: older collections simply jumble all curse-texts together and call them defixiones. We may compare the keen scholarly interest in the phenomenon of human deification as exemplified in Hellenistic ruler-cult, which pre-supposes recognition of the poles man and god. Who would dream of contesting the legitimacy or appropriateness of these categories on the grounds that there appears to have existed a hybrid category in between?149 K.

Snoek, Initiations: A Methodological Approach to the Application of Clas-sification and Definition Theory in the Study of Rituals (Diss. Leyden 1987) 7. Cf. also W.J. Goode, Current Anthropology 4 (1963) 507, who reproaches the partisans of emic approaches for failing to understand what concepts are for: “If the natives do not ‘see’ a distinction we believe scientifically important, we do not discard it on that acount” since “we are engaged in precisely that task, to create scientific theory and concepts with which to understand all social processes”. I have borrowed these citations from H.S. Versnel, Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion, Numen 38 (1991) 177–197 at 185, where these and similar methodological issues are discussed. It is impossible here to go into counter-arguments such as those put forward by Dickie 2001, 19 with nn. 5 and 6, which betray a fundamental failure to understand what my article was about. The same failure is even more apparent in J.N. Bremmer, The Birth of ‘Magic,’ ZPE 126 (1999) 1–12 (which the author re-published twice in an updated version). His p. 10, to give one example, reveals considerable confusion and inconsis-tency. The second of his five arguments against my thesis concludes: “To oppose magic and religion, then, is to use two terms and concepts which did not exist in antiquity, but are both the product of late- and post-medieval Europe” (the latter point was pre-cisely my point of departure; the first—at least as far as terminology is involved—was the central part of my own thesis). However, this claim is immediately followed by another: “Thirdly, we should take into consideration that the ancients themselves did not oppose magic to religion”. Taken together these two assertions imply that Greeks managed to not oppose two terms and notions which did not exist in their culture! I hope to discuss these and other misapprehensions elsewhere, and meanwhile refer for brief but pointed criticism of Bremmer’s arguments to D. Frankfurter’s remarks in BMCR 2005.05.32. For a serious application of my methodological suggestions in the"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 329That is however not the end of the matter. Having imposed order (our order) on the epigraphic material, the next step is to explore the historical, social and cultural contexts of the sub-divisions created by the taxonomy. That means we have to consider the concrete situation of the principals (the ‘actors’ in an older anthropological jargon). This is what we might call the emic side of the problem: the “native’s point of view”. How far do their categorisations, insofar as we can discover them, correspond to ours? Here we may ask questions such as: how far are the ideal types generated through textual analysis and thematic classification to be found in actual curses? If so, do they have typically distinct historical, topographical, cultural niches? If the answer is posi-tive, can we further specify their respective socio-religious contexts, their Sitz im Leben? Finally, what are we to make of the co-existence not only of two different major strategies but also of hybrid texts? There is unfortunately no evidence that there ever was a generic term available to the principals for their texts, which would have been the best point of entry for an emic enquiry. I have already pointed out that there is barely any ancient evidence (except in one late-antique text) for the modern term defixio: despite its Latin look, it is our term, introduced to denote a category that we regard as coherent and mean-ingful. As for the prayer for justice, we find a whole range of terms, such as donatio, devotio, exsecratio, commonitorium, and once preces (in the expression iteratis precibus),151 but they have no claim to be in any sense standard or generally-acknowledged.As regards the distribution and Sitz im Leben of the two ideal-types, authentic ‘binding’ defixiones have, as I have already observed, been found in large numbers, mainly in tombs and less frequently in pits and wells.152 Examples of ideal-typical prayers for justice too are not rare.

As I have pointed out earlier, all the curse-texts found in the first two are pure prayers for justice, and would never have been labelled defixiones if they were not written on lead. A number of scattered finds from all over the Mediterranean basin also belong to this category, including the texts of my collection itemised above (p. 322). They are in every respect genuine prayers, distinctive only in their frequent use of, or allusions to, legal or juridical language. The most typical of these locutions is the assignment of a culprit or a stolen object to the jurisdiction or purview of the god, by means of performative terms such as do, dono, devoveo, mando, commendo, recipere nomen, ἀνατίθημι, ἀνιερόω, καταγράφω, παρατίθεμαι. To my knowledge, nobody denies this dis-tinction between the two ideal-types. This invites the question of what the meaning or implication of the difference between them might be.Although Roman legislation against what we tend to call ‘black magic’, including the straight defixio, is more explicit,153 there is no doubt that in Greece, and especially at Athens, resort to what we call defixiones was also strongly disapproved of in official circles. Particu-lar grounds for condemnation were the private and secret nature of the ritual (the combination of privacy and secrecy traditionally invited suspicion and hence persecution),154 commerce with the ghosts of the 153 Especially, of course, under the influence of Imperial anxiety. The literature on this topic is immense. On the development of Roman legal attitudes towards magic see now the perceptive and innovative papers by J.B.

Rüpke (edd.), Religion and Law in Clas-sical and Christian Rome (Stuttgart 2006) 47–67; and his contribution to the present volume.154 On the crucial role of these two elements in accusations of magic, see e.g. H. Kippenberg, Magic in Roman Civil Discourse: Why Rituals could be Illegal, in P. Schäfer and H.G. Kippenberg (eds.), Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium.

The essential import of secrecy and concealment for the effectiveness of the defixio (and other magical materials) becomes apparent from the general feeling of relief when by chance such malign objects are recovered.

In Rep. 364c, he inveighs against begging priests who pretend to have the power of enabling anyone who wishes to injure an enemy, to harm “just and unjust alike” (ὁμοίως δίκαιον ἀδίκῳ) by means of incantations and defixiones (ἐπαγωγαῖς τισιν καὶ καταδέσμοις). Here we come to the heart of the matter.If the ‘binding’ defixio and the prayer for justice have anything in common besides their material base, it is that they are both private, epistolary expressions of a direct, unmediated appeal to supernatu-ral powers. All the contrasts between the two poles of the continuum (difference between the typical sites of deposition, and the typical addressees; secrecy versus availability; justification versus its absence, manipulative praxis versus pious prayer) can be summarised with little loss in terms of the contrast between legitimate and illegitimate, or between (socially, culturally, religiously) sanctioned and unsanctioned action.156 While competitive ‘binding’ defixiones cannot and do not appeal to divine justice, and therefore make no attempt to justify the action, prayers for justice of their very nature demand justice. Wild justice perhaps, but it is at any rate a form of vindication that bestows on the institution a degree of social and religious acceptability.157 Sev-eral scholars have even proposed that Greek prayer in general was connected with the notion of justice.158Or. 1, 243–250, where the recovery of a dead chameleon, magically applied, puts an end to his illness (“it was a very lucky fortune that what had been buried had now in that moment surfaced above ground to behold for all who wished to”). 155 See for recent surveys: Ogden 1999, 82–85; Dickie 2001, 33–78.156 Cf. C.R. Phillips III, Nullum crimen sine lege: Socio-religious Sanctions in Magic, in Faraone and Obbink 1991, 260–274. Note that Plato’s indignation about the magi-cian’s malicious acts against innocent person returns in a rescript of Constantius (Cod. Theod. 9.16.5): Multi magicis artibus ausi elementa turbare, vitas insontium labefactare non dubitant (. . . .) ut quisque suos conficiat malis artibus inimicos.157 I borrow the term ‘wild justice’ from the book of the same name by J. Mossman (London 1999) on the revenge theme in Euripides’ Hecuba.158 See J.N. Bremmer, Modi di communicazione con il divino: la preghiera, la divinazione e il sacrificio nella civiltà greca, in: S.

The Border-area: re-considerations and qualifications The proper location of the prayer for justice is a sanctuary where the cult of a great god is regularly and legitimately performed. The god will be one who is believed to be able and willing to intervene in human affairs, especially in the area of the administration or enforcement of justice. Whereas we find traditional defixiones with their manipulative praxeis from the early fifth century BCE onwards in mainland Greece and marginal areas such as Sicily and the Black Sea, the earliest-known group of prayers for justice, that from Cnidus, dates from the Hel-lenistic era; and most of the others belong to the Imperial period. By that time—and perhaps already much earlier thanks to Near-Eastern influences—a strongly monarchical flavour is characteristic of religious expression in Asia Minor; for the common man one of the chief duties of the distant king, and his more accessible subordinates, was the administration of justice. The fact that the prayer for justice employed the official language of a royal petition (enteuxis) is highly significant. It appears that in these regions people had a choice of options when it came to interacting with the supernatural; the fact that in the case of a justified complaint they so often opted for the deferential judicial prayer instead of the traditional defixio speaks volumes about their belief in divine power and its direct involvement in human affairs.159In Classical Greece such centres of divine justice are not attested. On the other hand, this is the region where the earliest examples of the ‘border-group’ have been found. In my little collection above, there are three ‘border-group’ curses (Palaimon, Kerameikos, Pella) dating from the 4th century BCE,160 and one (Oropus) that belongs to the early Hellenistic period. The first two open with the ‘defixio-word’ similarities between prayer and judicial plea and even postulated a judicial origin of the verb εὔχεσθαι (149–153).159 I do not quite follow Richard Gordon (in his introduction to this volume) in his assertion that the petition was an Empire-wide institution, the prayer for justice not. We know official petitions to high officials, kings and emperors from both Ptolemaic Egypt as well as from the Roman Empire and we find the concomitant language of both in contemporaneous prayers for justice. As for his question “are we then to look for specific local conditions?” and his excursus on specifically British circumstances, I would point out that Bath perfectly fulfilled the preconditions for appeals to divine justice since hot springs were places par excellence for staging an ordeal. See Versnel 1994.160 As far as we can see, 3.3.4 (Athenian Agora 2) is a true prayer for justice. Since Jordan expresses doubts about its provisional date (IVa?), I would cautiously suggest a later date in view of its phraseology. As I have noted earlier, it contains the expression"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 333καταδῶ(μεν), the third has a ‘binding’ formula known from defixio language. Towards the end the typical elements of supplicatory prayer become more and more apparent. This pattern is also to be found in the early Greek ‘border-area’ curses that I collected in 1991, 64–68.161 Some of them open with the variant “I send a letter to Hermes . . .,” which may be modelled on a customary secular petition-letter. Since all these curses (except 3.3.1, Palaimon) were deposited in tombs, I would suggest that this earliest type of border-area curses developed from the traditional binding curse. Just as those who cannot blame their rivals for any wrong-doing except their rivalry (e.g. in the context of amatory, judicial and commercial curses), so the victims of theft, fraud, or violation, could avail themselves of the traditional defixio. However, because their objective was different, they began to add a supplicatory or vindic(a)tive tail-piece. The wide variety of expres-sion suggests that these were more or less spontaneous, individual, creations, inspired by the twin convictions of having been wronged and being in the right. The cradle of this type of border-group, then, lay in the defixio proper.The later true or ‘pure’ prayers for justice, which are closely compa-rable to the familiar written or inscribed prayers and vows deposited at altars and divine statues in sanctuaries,162 originated as personal ἐπὶ κατεργασίαν, which is formulaic in the Acrocorinth curses of I-IIp, but does not occur earlier (or anywhere else).161 This pattern in fact never disappears totally, but I am here concerned with ori-gins. 162 In De formulis et solemnibus populi Romani verbis libri VIII of 1593, B. Bris-sonius already collected all the evidence known to him pointing out that it was such common usage that special verbs had been created for it: (in)signare and incerare which verbs practically equal vota facere.

Even closer to the material form of the prayers for justice under discussion are wax writing tablets found in Greek sanctuaries. See for evidence and discussion: G.

They probably began as formulaic prayers—probably prompted by professional clergy or other experts—but allowed for expressions of individual creativity. One of these was the introduction of elements proper to curses, which, as the authors well knew, worked in other areas of the religious spec-trum. The fact that it was not necessarily the model of the defixio that inspired this development is well illustrated by one of the longest and most frequently-quoted true prayers for justice, a text on lead found in 1899 near Arkesine on Amorgos (IG XII.7, p. 1).163 It was dated to the second century CE by Homolle, first century CE by Bömer, and around 200 BCE by Zingerle. Since the tablet itself has disappeared, linguists and papyrologists have the last word here, for it shows clear analogies to petitions of the ἔντευξις type.164 I cite a translation of the text, excluding the narrative section describing how a certain Epaph-roditos with the help of evil practices incited (συνεπεθέλγετο) the complainant’s slaves to run away:Side ALady Demeter, O Queen, as your supplicant, your slave, I fall at your feet (Κυρία ∆ημήτηρ, βασίλισσα, ἱκέτης σου, προσπίπτω δὲ ὁ δοῦλος σου). . . . . . .

Indeed, many of the expressions of this prayer (and that of Artemisia) have close parallels in the enteuxis: βασιλεῦ; ἐπί σε καταφεύγω; τοῦ δικαίου τύχω; ἰκέτις; προσπίπτω; ἀδικοῦμαι.

O Queen, hear us who suffer and punish those who rejoice in our misery (ἐπάκουσον ἡμῖν παθοῦσι, κολάσαι τοὺς ἡμὰς τοιούτους ἡδέως βλέποντες).165 This is the most explicit supplication among all these texts from a submissive mortal (“your slave”) to a sovereign goddess (here actually “queen”), who is asked to show her “mercy” and (here for the first time) to “hear” the supplicant by taking revenge on his behalf and punishing the guilty ones. In this case, the punishments requested are phrased as curses. However, they are not the curses that we typically encounter in the defixio, but rather those that are typical of conditional self-curses but also, in particular, those against possible disturbers of the grave,166 which, unlike defixiones but similar to prayers for justice, wish upon the transgressor death, physical suffering, the wretched-ness of being accursed, and post-mortem punishment.167 In this text the curses, though pronounced by the writer himself, are entrusted to the mediation or sanction of the goddess (“grant that . . .”) upon whose 165 Compare the translation in Gager, CT 166f. no. 75.166 Among the many curses of this type collected by J.T.

This differentiation, due to the opposed points of departure, may linger on in the pattern of later borderline curses and thus may help us to determine the specific function and meaning of individual curse texts. But this is not all. In the meantime we have made an observation that may invite a qualification of the category ‘border-area’. If the curse section in the text from Amorgos is definitely not of the defixio type but is typical of funerary curses, which either take the form of a prayer to gods or that of independent deterrent impreca-tions (see below p. 341), there is no reason at all to label this cursing part “magical”. Urgent wishes, devout prayers do not become magical as a result of their malicious aims. The curse section in the Amorgos text, like many funerary maledictions, can be seen as the principal’s own helpful contribution by way of suggesting concrete modalities of divine punishment. As such they may be called curses but cannot meaningfully be described as ‘magical’. The same is true of a number of the Mainz curses. There too we have texts which, sometimes blithely co-existing with an opening or closing prayer formula, contain direc-tives about how the culprit is to suffer (cf. above n. 132). In this case, they are mostly phrased as similes, most of which are unattested in defixiones; if anything, they, too, resemble formulas known from oath formulas and funerary curses. For instance (numbers refer to Bläns-dorf ’s contribution):Mater Deum, you pursue (your enemies) across land and sea, arid and humid [places], across . . . (no. 16) May their limbs melt, just as this lead is to melt, so that [thereby] death shall come upon them (no. 12, cf. nos. 13, 14)Just as salt melts in water, so may he do (no. 7)Whatever he does, shall become salt and water for him (no. 8) 168 The phrasing does not allow to identify this katadesmos with the tablet on which it is written. The expression “may a (not: “the” or “this”) curse take and hold his house” is to be compared with standard wishes in funerary curses “that the violator may be cursed (for ever)”, cf. Versnel 1985; Strubbe 1997, xviii."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 337Comparisons with the self-castration and blood-letting of the Galli and Bellonarii It must be frankly admitted that at Mainz we also find clear reminis-cences of defixio strategies, such as explicit references to retrograde writing (e.g. “may you live backwards (perverse), as this is written backwards (perverse)” [Blänsdorf no. 3]). However, the difference in intention is always perceptible: if in a binding-defixio the writer evokes the weight of lead, he or she does so in order to make the victim’s tongue as heavy as that metal, so that he cannot speak; if lead is heavy in a prayer for justice, it is as heavy as the wrath of the god who is to punish the target. This difference between binding/paralysing on the one hand, and punishing/torturing/killing on the other, holds good all through the relevant sections of curse-texts. Consequently we should now acknowledge that neither the Amorgos text nor a number of Mainz texts (as well as other curses) should be ranged among the ‘borderline curses’ on the mere ground that they contain this type of imprecations. If they do not display other—viz. ‘magical’—elements they are simply prayers for justice. I should add here another consideration, of a different nature, that should warn us against inconsiderate use of the label ‘border area’. This regards the fact that a prayer for divine intervention need not be written out in full. Many of the more concise or apparently lacunate curse-texts from Acrocorinth and Mainz, such as those that contain not much more than the wish that an opponent suffer, or just a list of parts of the body (which are, as we have seen, typical features of the full prayer for justice, but not of the binding-defixio) may in fact be condensed or shorthand forms of what, if expanded, would be a true prayer for justice. This is indeed demonstrably the case in three tablets from Acrocorinth (Stroud nos. 6, 7, and 8/9). The last, which I have summarised above under 3.3.2, displays a number of features typical of the prayer for justice, such as “depositing with” or “giv-ing in charge” (παρατίθεμαι) the target so that the Moirai Praxidikai may exact justice and punish her for her insolent behaviour. No. 7, against the same target, restricts itself to the brief formula “I deposit (παρατίθεμαι again) with the avenging gods and goddesses Karpime Babia for destruction. . . .”. This is clearly a less elaborate version of the first prayer. In no. 6, which is written in the same hand, all but the following words are lost: “and she will be destroyed from this day today. . . .I beg (?) sinews. . . .underworld . . . herself . . . ”. Stroud plausibly"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"338 henk s. versnelsuggests that we have here three variants of a prayer for justice against the same person.169 The latter two may be brief ‘reminders’ of the ear-lier, more extended, prayer, parallel to the expression iteratis preci-bus in a British curse (p. 329 above), just as nowadays we might find almost identical “Briefe zum Himmel” by the same person in a church or pilgrimage-site.170 I would therefore urge that most of the Mainz curses with fractions of or allusions to the prayer for justice should be understood as condensed forms of the fuller type of prayers for justice that we also encounter in that collection. The phrasing of the Acrocorinth texts, just quoted, leads us to a last reservation with respect to an all too rash use of the notion ‘border-line-curse’. It concerns some terminological issues of which I was not aware in my earlier work. The verb παρατίθεμαι occurs together with κατατίθεμαι in two of the three Acrocorinth texts. The verbs deserve some fuller discussion here. Stroud rightly comments on their “com-mon use in defixiones”. It should be noted, however, that, by con-trast with the monosemantic term καταδῶ, the verb παρατίθεμαι has a range of denotations and connotations, as my translation “deposit with, give in charge of ” has already suggested. One fairly common meaning is “deposit documents, give in charge, commit or commend (a person) into another’s hands” (LSJ s.v. B 2). Another is “dedicate a gift to a god”.171 In each of these denotations it comes very close to the verbs ἀνατίθημι, ἀνιερόω, do, dono mando, commendo, used in prayers for justice for “to give” a culprit or a stolen object to the god. At any rate, the verb may just as well be indicative of a prayer for jus-tice as of a binding defixio. Actually it better fits the prayer situation and closer investigation must clarify in which of the two categories the term may prevail. It is clear enough, however, that the occurrence of this term itself by no means suffices to range a curse among the class of the defixio or the borderland-curses. 169 For four tablets directed against the same person, namely Venusta at Morgan-tina, see J.B. Curbera, Venusta and her Owner in Four Curse Tablets from Morgan-tina, ZPE 110 (1996) 295–300. 170 As I once did in the shrine of the Santo Bambino (Ara Coeli): two identical texts from a boy two weeks apart. Cf. the following letter by a little boy: “Dear God. I wrote you before, remember? I have done what I promised to do, but you did not send that horse. What about that? Louis” (in: E. Marshall and S. Hampl, Children’s Letters to God [New York 1966]).171 For this meaning see: EBGR 1992, nos. 81, 199. For its use in curses see: M.L. Lazzarini, ΠΑΡΑΚΑΤΑΤΙΘΕΝΑΙ, Hespería (ed. L.

A reconsidera-tion of its denotations prompts me to withdraw my earlier assessment of a well-known opisthographic text from Delos (first century BCE).172 Let us first have a look at this text. Side A begins as follows: Lord gods Sykonaioi (. . .), Lady goddess Syria (. . .) Sykona, punish and give expression to your wondrous power ([ἐκδικ]ήσετε κὲ <ἀ>ρετὴν γεν<ν>ήσετε). I curse ([κατα]γράφο) the one who took away, who stole my neck-lace. I curse those who had knowledge of it, those who participated. The specific parts of the body to be bound “from head to toe” are then listed. Side B is almost identical but instead of [κατα]γράφο τὸν ἄραντα, it has διοργιάσετε τὸν ἄραντα (direct your anger to the one who took away my necklace),173 and it lacks the list of parts of the body. In my commentary in 1991, 66f., I stated that in the first text the characteristics of the traditional defixio predominate, and that hence these two texts on one tablet show in a truly exemplary way the two possible appeals to the supernatural which were available to the victim of an injustice. (. . .) Despite the fact that the text on side A would (on formal grounds at least) be regarded as a typical defixio, the assertions of righteousness seem to diminish if not neutralize the negative connota-tions which are usually attached to this extreme form of black magic.Although this interpretation has been accepted by later scholars,174 I now think I was wrong. First, I did not realise that the verb καταγράφω, like παρατίθεμαι, with which it is sometimes paired, belongs to a dif-ferent semantic field from καταδέω. It means inter alia “register, record, enroll” (LSJ s.v. II.2). David Jordan has pointed out that, as an aspect of legal or quasi-legal language, it is in fact typical of the prayer for justice.175 Secondly, at that time I had not yet realised that 172 Ph. Bruneau, Recherches sur les cultes de Délos à l’époque hellénistique et à l’époque impériale (Paris 1970) 649–655; SGD I 58; Versnel 1991, 66f.; Gager, CT 188 no. 88; Jordan 2002.173 The use of the imperative διοργιάσετε is related to the expression θεοὶ κεχυολωμένοι found in many funerary curses, e.g. from Halos in Phthiotis (IIIª). . . . ἕξει δὲ ὀργὴν μεγάλην τοῦ μεγάλου ∆ιός. 174 Most recently Ogden 1999, 38.175 “Le mot καταγράφω est le verbe principal dans plusieurs prières de ven-geance . . .

We should therefore conclude, in the present state of research, that both A and B are true prayers for justice: both are addressed to great gods, but the first takes the form of a regular accu-sation, as at Cnidus and Bath. As I argued above, practically the same can now be ascertained for the curse texts from Kenchreae (no. 3.3.8) and Pella (3.3.8).These considerations have served to suggest that as we refine the notion of prayer for justice, the number of ‘border-area’ cases may be reduced. Nevertheless, as my little group of new texts has reminded us, hybrid forms do undoubtedly occur. The question to which I now return, is: does the existence of such a group detract from the signifi-cance of the distinction between the ideal-types at either pole of the continuum? As I argued earlier, my answer is no. Let me add a few additional considerations with the aid of a couple of analogies. Many narratives of miracles performed by healing gods, especially Asclepius, relate that the patient was given up by the doctors. For example, a confession text from near Kollyda in Maeonia (Petzl, BIWK no. 62) tells us that a woman made a vow for her sick son, to the effect that “if her son recovered without money being wasted on doctors”, she would write it on a stele (in honour of the god Men Axiottenos). Competition between a god and human doctors for the same clien-tele seems to underlie the inscription that records a person “who was cured by nobody, but healed by the god”.176 Furthermore, several reci-pes in PGrMag and other late-antique collections promote “wonderful spells” that assure recovery without intervention of gods or physicians. This means that patients regularly had recourse to different strategies, between verbs of “binding” and quasi-legal verbs of “inscribing” and “registering”, see also Ogden 1999, 26.176 Herrmann and Malay 2007, nos. 84. No. 46 (ibid.), so far interpreted as con-cerning a woman who was punished by the god since “she went up to the god (only) after the doctors had come to her (ἐλθόντων αὐτῇ τῶν φυσικῶν)” (so: Herrman and Malay; G. Petzl, God and Physician: Competitors or Colleagues? in: A. Marcone [ed.], Medicina e Società nel Mondo Antico [Udine 2006] 55–62), should be translated dif-ferently viz.: “after her period had begun”, as convincingly argued by R.C.T. Parker, TA ΦΥΣΙΚΑ in a Confession Inscription from Saittai, ZPE 163 (2007) 121f. On doc-tors and gods in confession texts see also: A. Chaniotis, Illness and Cures in Greek Propitiatory Inscriptions, in: Ph.J. van der Eijk, H.F.P. Horstmanshoff, P.H.

Yet as strategies they are all quite different. We can easily distinguish in the realm of concerns about health between 1. paying a doctor for his professional expertise (an appeal to what we might call a secular authority), 2. submissively entreating help from a god (an appeal to a religious/supernatural authority),178 and 3. having recourse to (secret) powerful spells that are supposed to work ex opere operato. The three options may be similar in some respects but they are fundamentally different in others. And so it is with the difference between true bind-ing-defixiones and true prayers for justice.Another case in point regards oath formulas. It has been shown that Greek oaths can be formulated in two different ways. In the case of (self-)imprecation, a conditional curse may be enough to effect compliance.179 The oath of the people of Thera while they are burn-ing wax images runs: “May he, who does not abide by these oaths but trangresses them, melt away and dissolve like the images—himself, his seed and his property” (SEG 9: 4). Since there is no reference here to a deity, Aubriot argues that the operative factor is confidence in the sheer efficacy of the words and ritual acts. The other strategy is to invoke a specific god, who is understood to witness to the oath and guarantee its efficacy. This strategy excludes automatism. Nevertheless, these two modes, though in principle opposed, may be used together, often by adding one to the other. However, only the second type can properly take the form of a prayer. This seems to me to offer a useful analogy to the relationship between the binding-defixio and the prayer for justice. Although they differ in origin, nature and socio-religious setting, they could be combined in many different ways. In an earlier phase, we may suggest, the binding-defixio was filled out, or complemented, by taking over familiar tech-niques of pious prayer, but only when the author could claim to have been wronged by the target. Conversely, at a later stage, true prayers for 177 Similarly, the author of I.Knidos no. 150B, after having “dedicated” (= ceded) a lost object to the gods (so that they shall punish the thief and thus get it back for him), nonetheless offers a reward (κόμιστρον) to any person who shall return it.178 And sometimes also pay him: Asclepius behaves and heals as a doctor in some iamata, but also acts as a superior divine miracle-worker without any reference to the medical instruments of his profession, as do the gods of the confession texts. 179 D.

This will be thought odd only by those who think that it is the language of the defixio that defines its illicit status by contrast with the licit, sanctioned status of the prayer for justice. In fact, however, the difference between them is not primarily linguistic, it is a function of the multiple socio-religious factors I have listed above (pp. 329–36). ‘Heterodox’ verbal strategies are not the crucial or most telling factor. Judgements about language-use are context-dependent. In the context of unsanctioned, antisocial, malign praxis, the ‘language of otherness’ serves to reinforce the overall negative intention. In the prayer for justice, on the other hand, its potentially negative connotations are neutralised, as it were, by the intention of restoring justice, so that what remains dominant in the communication is the sheer force of the appeal to the divinity.Appendix on vota in curse-textsThere are two reasons for devoting an appendix to the place of the vow in defixiones. The first is that sometimes (most explicitly in some of the essays in Brodersen and Kropp 2004), the notion of vow/votum has been invoked as one of the characteristics of the prayer for justice, especially those from Britain. Indeed some scholars have argued that they are actually vota. I quote here the most explicit expression of this view, by P.-Y. Lambert (2004, 79): “The judicial prayer belongs in fact to the vows: the victim of theft vows the stolen object (or part of it) to the deity, and so does the person in a trial”.180 This is simply an error. As I argued in 1991, such an interpretation implies a misunder-standing of the nature of prayers for justice, which are quasi-judicial accusations, an essential part of whose procedure is to transfer the target, or the stolen object, or the case (or indeed all three), solemnly into god’s care. As far as the object is concerned, this means that it 180 Kiernan 2004 (in the same volume) is entirely devoted to this claim. It is impos-sible to discuss his arguments at length here. In my view, his main theses are mis-guided (the British texts are neither ‘Magie’ nor ‘Votivrituale’). Conceptually, indeed, the entire article represents a step backwards. He also discusses the issue of the avail-ability of these texts, on which, however, see the recent literature noted above (n. 22)."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" prayers for justice, east and west 343is ceded, not vowed. It unfortunately seems necessary to reiterate this basic distinction here. The second reason is that looking specifically at the place of refer-ences to vota in these texts offers another means of testing my general taxonomy. The hypothesis to be tested is this: if prayers for justice are closer to true prayers than to ‘magical’ defixiones, we would expect that references to vota will be found mainly, if not exclusively, in the former.181 I here collect the texts that are invariably cited in studies that touch on the issue of votive religion in curse tablets,182 to which I have added a few others that have come to my notice over the years. Since it makes no pretence at being exhaustive, it cannot provide a decisive test of the hypothesis, merely a strong indication one way or the other.1.

A defixio which begins (recto) with δέομαί σου invoking Hermes Katochos, and then the Telchines (extremely unusual). It contains the expression πέμπω δῶρον.189 However, the context leaves little doubt that the δῶρον is not a gift (let alone a votive gift) of some valuable object or sacrifice, but the target herself, who is being consigned to the deities of the underworld.190 This tal-lies nicely with expressions containing forms of δέχομαι (ποτίδεξαι/ποτιδέξεσθε), asking the gods of the Underworld to receive persons mentioned in some lead tablets from a temenos near the theatre in Morgantina (SEG 29: 927–34).191 189 SGD I 109 = Curbera 1999, 181 no. 48. It reads in part: (recto, ll. 6–10, corrected spelling): δῶρον τοῦτο πέμπω παιδ[ίσκην] . . . παιδίσκην καλὴν δοροῦμαι σοι [δῶρον] καλὸν, “the handsome girl (Prima Allia), I give you as a beautiful gift”), after which all her body parts are listed, each qualified by the epithet ‘beautiful’. The verso mentions Cerberus (l. 4), who is evidently to receive her, and Persephone (l. 18), (ll. 10–13): “Prima Allia I hand over (παραδείδομι), Hermes, in order that you may hand her over to the Mistress . . . ” (i.e. of the Underworld).190 For this reason I also exclude here SGD I 54 = R.P. Austin, PBSA 27 (1925–6) 73 and the related DTAtt 99, where the same expression πέμπω δῶρον occurs, but cannot be satisfactorily contextualised. However it is in each case clear that the δῶρον in question is a gift, not an εὐχή/votum/vow.191 Against N. Nabers, AJA 70 (1966) 67–68 (who was followed by J. and L. Robert, Bull.ép. 1966 no. 518) and ibid. 83 (1979) 463ff., D.R. Jordan, Two Inscribed Lead Tablets from the Kerameikos, MDAI(A) 95 (1980) 225–239 at 236–238, convincingly argued that these tablets are defixiones. The targets are sent to the underworld (as a gift) where the gods are asked to accept them. That this is the point is made clear by two of the texts, one of which requests Earth, Hermes and the gods of the Underworld ἀπάγετε τὰν Βενούσταν (SEG 29: 932), while the other has ποτιδέξεσθε, which is the usual word in the group (SEG 29: 931, cf. J. Curbera, ZPE 110 [1996] 295–7, with lit-erature on the question in n. 27). Analogously, the text from Oropos (3.3.5 above) asks the gods (of the Underworld?) κακοὺς καὶ μελέους δέξαισθε αὐτοὺς πάντας (ll. 32–4); see also no. 3.1.1.3 (Carmona). Of course, one can also wish the reverse, e.g. CIL VI 36467 = ILS 8184 (a funerary curse): si qui violaverit . . . opto ei ut cum dolore corporis longo tempore vivat et cum mortuus fuerit inferi eum non recipiant. Cf. ibid. 8190. The last one and a half lines of a funerary text from the Porta Nocera graveyard in Pompeii read: Qui nostrum mentitur / eum nec Di Penates nec Inferi recipiant (AE 1964: 160, cf. the commentary by M.

The tablet is unfortunately damaged at the crucial point. Audollent ad loc. lists various conjectures which suggest that a votum was under-taken. There is however insufficient evidence to support that. The text seems to be an amatory curse, which, at any rate in this respect, I have argued are to be counted prayers for justice.192To this evidence we can also add three passages from texts already discussed above: 9. Carmona (no. 3.1.1.3): sei faciatis votum quod faccio solva(m) vostris meritis.10. Setúbal (no. 3.1.1.4): (H)unc tibi (h)ostia(m) quadrupede(m), do(mi)ne Attis, voveo si eu(m) fure(m) invenero.

Sec-ondly, several of those I list here occur in texts that show other oddities or deviations from ideal-typical forms.

The new curses from shrines of Attis (and Mater Magna), nos.10–11, are also idiosyncratic. Quite apart from that, it is clear that, where it is mentioned, the gift promised is never the stolen object itself but always something uncon-nected with the case: – εὐανγέλια θύσω—(1)– ποίσω ἀργύρε[ο]ν σπάδικα (2)– σε τειμήσω καὶ σ[οι] ἄριστον δῶρον παρασκε[υάσω] (3)– σοι θυσίαν ἀποδώσω (4)– Polliciar illi te daturum tres victimas almas caricas, porcum nigrum, hoc sei perfecerit ante mensem Martium; Haec, Proserpina Salvia, tibi dabo cum compote feceris (5) – ecquod votum/feci ut solva(m) (6)– sei faciatis votum quod faccio solva(m) vostris meritis (9)– Tunc tibi (h)ostia(m) quadrupede(m), do(mi)ne Attis, voveo si eu(m) fure(m) invenero (10)More significant still is the fact that the fulfilment of the promise is understood as something that will take place in the future: θύσω, ποίσω, τειμήσω (καὶ παρασκε[υάσω]), ἀποδώσω, polliciar illi te datu-rum, dabo, solvam, voveo si eas iure invenero, ut laetus libens ea tibi referam. This is of course perfectly appropriate to the typical votive situation, in which the promise turns into an actual gift (donum), i.e. is redeemed, only after the god has fulfilled the request. This is quite clear from the standard votive formulas such as: ex v(oto) d(ono) d(edit) (e.g. AE 1998: 571); d(onum) d(edit) l(ibens) m(erito) (e.g. AE 1999: 1180), or u(t) v(overat) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito) (e.g. AE 1996: 194 For a map of Roman-period Sicily, see HAaW map 143B. 195 See on the deviant forms of Olbia curses: A.

First, in prayers for justice the verb transferring something (do/dono) to the god is never in the future tense but always in either the present or the perfect.199 Consequently, it is not a promise to give (and hence is not part of a conditional propo-sition) but a performative present (or past) referring to an action that is now being performed or has already taken place: the object is hereby ceded to the god. Furthermore, in pure prayers for justice the so-called gift is always the stolen or lost object, not any other type of offering. The difference between this and the vow is also demonstrated by the fact that in both the Latin and the Greek evidence (Britain, Spain, Cnidus etc.) not only the object stolen, but also the thief (exception-ally also the entire affair), can be ‘given’ to the god. The fact that in some British texts only a fraction of the (value of ) the stolen object is ceded does not make them vows,200 because it too is transferred at the 196 The same is true of the conventional Greek formulas such as εὐξάμενος ἀνέθηκεν, or the less common τὴν εὐχήν ἀπέδωκεν/ἀνέθηκεν; cf. L. Robert, Hellenica 6 (Paris 1948) 105, 107 n. 3.197 “Noter la formule donum solvere [qui fait double emploi avec v(otum) s(olvit)]” (R. Frei-Stolba and H. Lieb). A related but different kind of contamination appears in the occasional formula: votum quod promisit dedit: e.g. ILAfr. 348; RIB 307; ArchClass 24–26 (1973–74) 741, which has its precise equivalent in the Greek expression quoted in the preceding note. 198 These three features provide an additional argument for excluding no. 7 (Lily-baeum).199 See e.g. Tomlin 1988, 63f. Against twelve cases of the present, there are three cases of the perfect donavi(t).200 Some British texts have interesting variants.

As R. Tomlin remarks, “A god’s interest is often engaged by the ‘gift’ of a fraction of the stolen property, but two-thirds is unusually high” (362 n. 8 on ll. 3–4). One of the Uley texts reads: deo s(upra)dicto (i.e. Mercury) tertiam partem donat . . .

The means he or she is invited or entreated to use is to send physical suffering upon the guilty party. As we have seen in discussing the border-area between the true defixio and the prayer for justice, contact and contamination between modes occurs frequently in these texts. That the procedure of solemn transfer should occasionally have evoked the notion of votum would under these circumstances not be surprising. It is therefore all the more remarkable that confusion between vow and solemn transfer, so far as I know, does not occur at all.202 We never find the stolen object or the culprit as the object of a form of voveo or of a future form of verbs like dare, donare, mandare etc. On the other hand, we do find genuine vota alongside solemn trans-fers in these true judicial prayers. A votum is essentially a conditional bribe (δῶρα θεοὺς πείθει, Hesiod, frg. 272 R. = 361 M.-W.) intended to induce a god to provide help in a precarious situation—sickness, mishap, failure of crops, deprivation, natural disaster, war. . . . and not least in cases of theft or fraud. The promise is to be redeemed only after the results of the god’s intervention are recognisable. We might then actually have expected the vow to be a frequent additional inducement when gods are invoked to do justice and retrieve a lost or stolen object. But as the list makes clear (even if it is not exhaustive, it gives an accurate idea of the cases that do exist), it is not. The rea-son, no doubt, is that the authors expect justice and retribution from of arithmetic). In a recent IVp text from Ratcliffe-on-Soar the principal “makes a note (annoto) of some utensils and adds duas partis deo (two-thirds for the god)” (AE 2004: 856 = R. Tomlin, Britannia 35 [2004] 336f.).201 Note, too, that insofar as curse formulas state a condition, e.g. (ni)si or an equi-valent, it is never part of the deal with the god but always part of one with the target. The culprits are not to recover “unless” or “before” they return the stolen object: Tom-lin 1988, 65 s.v. nisi.202 Kiernan 2004, 106 illustrates the notion of a vow in a British curse by means of a well-known text from Kelvedon, Essex: quicumque res Vareni in/volaverit si mulier si mascel / sangu(i)no suo solvat—erit/ --]et pecunie(m) quam exesu/ Mercurio dona et Virtuti s<emis> (AE 1959: 157 = JRS 48 [1958] 150). I presume that he takes exesuerit (erit and exesu, though written on different lines, must be taken together) as a future. But exesuerit is exactly parallel to involaverit and hence must be a perfect subjunctive. Dona equals the formulaic dono. That is, half the sum stolen is to go to Mercury and Virtus."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"350 henk s. versnelthe righteous divine judge203 and therefore do not feel the need to bribe him.204 While, then, voveo never occurs as a variant expression of what I have labelled cession of the stolen object or surrender of the culprit to a god, in a few exceptional cases we do find forms of devoveo. This usage however does not go to prove that the judicial prayer is in fact a sub-class of the vow, as Lambert and Kiernan believe. The implied argument rests on the false assumption that the composite devoveo is future-directed just like the simple form voveo. It is true that devoveo sometimes has virtually the same meaning as voveo (cf. OLD sense 1). But it is no less true that, when the action is addressed to gods of the Underworld—with the prefix de-, like Greek κατά, in its basic meaning of ‘downwards’—or, less specifically, is intended to cause the target to suffer, the verb lacks the reference to the future and becomes the equivalent of desacro or consacro/consecro (OLD sense 3). This development began with the devotio ducis in the third cen-tury BCE,205 and retained the illocutionary status of a performative present—as opposed to a votive future—over the centuries, especially in curse texts. An opisthographic tablet addressed to the Nymphs and found in an acidic spring, the Poggio Bagnoli near Arretium, curses a man named Q. Letinius Lupus with the words: hunc ego aput vostrum numen demando, devoveo, desacrifico.206 In such cumulative formulas, which are typical of magical texts as well as of prayer in general,207 the two or three words of the formula are generally synonyms or varia-203 In a newly-published confession-text (Herrmann and Malay 2007 no. 51), for the first time, the god is explicitly called “all-seeing judge in heaven” (κριτὴς ἀλάθητος ἐν οὐρανῷ), quite apart from the usual interventions expected of him.204 See n. 74 above. However, as I suggested in n. 22 above, prayers for justice were sometimes at least made available for a readership at a shrines. This may have increased the chances of successfully recovering the stolen objects.205 In my article Two Types of Roman Devotio, Mnemosyne 29 (1976) 365–410, I showed how in the formula consacro or desacro me et mecum devoveo legiones hostium (vel sim.), that the commander uttered as he was voluntarily about to give his own life to the gods of the Underworld, desacro was replaced by devoveo, which neverthe-less retained its status as a performative present. The devotio of the general was a consecratio, not a vow. This theory has been generally acepted. See most recently: S.P. Oakley, A Commentary on Livy, Vol. II, Books VII–VIII, pp. 480–483; A. Dyck, Cicero’s Devotio: The Rôles of Dux and Scape-goat in his Post Reditum Rhetoric, HSCPh 102 (2004) 301–314. 206 CIL XI 1823 = DTAud 129b = ILS 8748.207 H.S.

The same curse provides an example a little farther on: uti vos eum interemates, interficiates, and it would be tedious to list here all the synonyms for mishaps that are to befall enemies, rivals in love or business, gladiators or race horses, such as deprimite, defigite, perfigite, consumite—cadat, vertat, frangat—καταδῶ, ἀφανίζω, κατορύττω, καταπατταλεύω. Their rhetorical form (ecphrasis and emphasis through repetition and variation) means that such formulas resist inconsistencies. In par-ticular, they cannot simultaneously be oriented both to the present and the future, as do/consecro on the one hand and voveo on the other would demand. One cannot logically give an object now and condi-tionally promise to give the same object at some time in the future. In these contexts devoveo practically equals (the rather rare word) desacro. It may even have been considered an elevated, more solemn word. Tomlin suggests, for example, that in the phrase devoveo eum qui caracallam meam involaverit (Tab.Sulis 10), devoveo is a “sophisti-cated” term “instead of the normal dono”.208 As we have already seen, devotos are equated with defixos in the text from Barchín de Hoyo (3.1.1.1).209 More important however is the fact that the two words are the equivalents of δίδωμι, παραδίδωμι in the parallel Greek text, while οἷς δικαίως̣̣ κατηρασά̣̣μην is paraphrased as quos merito devovi, both of which Curbera, Sierra Delage and Velázquez rightly translate as “cursed”. That is why the Latin term for what we call curse-tablets (and curses in general), is not defixio but devotio (OLD sense 2).210 208 So Tomlin 1988, 122 n. 5, who notes that this is the sole occurrence of the verb in all the Bath curses. In the curse from Ratcliffe-on-Soar cited in n. 83, the principal writes: “In the name of Camulorix and Titocuna I have dedicated in the temple of the god the mule(?) which they have lost” (Tomlin’s translation). The verbal form is heavily mutilated (we read DADVSVI). Hence only the v and the final vi can support Tomlin’s conjecture devovi. Even allowing this, he must be right to say that it is an equivalent of the “devoveo (which) is used instead of the usual dono in Tab.Sulis no. 10 l. 5 but of the thief, not of the object stolen”. He therefore translates: “I have dedi-cated” (and not “I have vowed”).209 One of the Mainz curses (p. 174 no. 8) has the same combination: devotum defictum (while no. 6 has a form of devoveo in two places). The same in [Apuleius] Herbarium 7.1 (an herbal antidote to curse tablets) ap. Gager, CT 237 no. 131 = Ogden 1999, 53), which opens with the words: si quis devotatus defixusque fuerit. Gager writes: “As commonly in Latin texts, they probably designate a single action of being put under the spell by a curse tablet”; cf. Curbera, Sierra Delage and Velázquez 1999, 282: “devoveo and defigo . . . are almost synonyms”. 210 On the various possible Latin terms for curse-tablets, see Ogden 1999, 5.

THE SPELLS AND FORMULAE OF THE LATIN DEFIXIONUM TABELLAEAmina KroppIn this paper I examine the formulas in Latin defi xionum tabellae from a double perspective, that of pragma-linguistics and ritual per-formance.1 Th e interdisciplinary scope of such an approach to magical language is obvious: Linguistic pragmatics studies people’s use of language, a form of behav-iour or social action. Th us the dimension which the pragmatic perspec-tive is intended to give insight into is the link between language and human life in general. Hence, pragmatics is also the link between lin-guistics and the rest of humanities and social sciences.2Seen from this perspective, the defi xiones are an unmediated example of language resources employed in an historical ritual context. His-torical pragmatics deals largely with literary sources or meta-linguistic documents such as dictionaries and grammars.3 Th is linguistic mate-rial, however, does not always off er a transparent window on the use of language (and the language-using human) within an ancient soci-ety. By contrast, ancient magical inscriptions lend themselves remark-ably well to an analysis from a pragmatic perspective since, as textual archetypes of non-fi ctional documents, they report the original word-ing of the curse as direct speech. Moreover, important elements of the ritual context can be reconstructed through the analysis of magical papyri, archeological data, literary and non-literary sources, and other comparable evidence. Th e study of these linguistic products, in com-bination with the examination of the historical background, allows us, 1 See now my Magische Sprachverwendung in vulgärlateinischen Fluchtafeln (defi x-iones).

Th e performative character of ritual language use is illustrated by Austin’s examples concerning marriage or the declaration of war.6 With regard to magic rituals the performativity of the verbal elements can be very well described in the words of the anthropologist Stanley J. Tambiah: “magical acts, usually compounded of verbal utterance and object manipulation, constitute ‘performative’ acts”.7 Th is is exactly the case with the κατάδεσvοι or defi xiones: the ritual performance consisting of both verbal and non-verbal elements “brings about changes in the extra-linguistic world” by a “‘mechanical’ and more or less ‘automatic’ procedure usually associated with magic”.8 I call these verbal elements of such ritual per-formances ‘magic formulas’ or ‘spells’ and examine them here more closely.My point of departure is the taxonomy of the Greek κατάδεσvοι established by Chris Faraone in his article “Th e Agonistic Context of Early Greek Binding Spells” (1991) (Table 1, col. II). His approach was in turn based on the studies of Eugen Kagarow, mainly on his mono-graph Griechische Fluchtafeln (1929) (Table 1, col. I). Th is kind of analysis has never been attempted for the Latin defi xiones, and I give a brief overview of my results in this paper (Table 1, col. III). Despite 4 Bonner 1950, 103–122.

Self-consciousness in a writer is doubtless a good, but excess rapidly irritates.5 Austin 1962, 1; 5. Cf. also Searle’s brief summary of this discussion: “that dis-tinction [between constatives and performatives] didn’t work, because stating and describing are just as much actions as promising and ordering” (1989, 536).6 See Austin 1962, 5–43; Searle 1979a, 17.7 Tambiah 1973, 199 = 1985, 60.8 Cf.

Th e former considers spells that use forms of καταδː, ‘I bind’, as describing formulas (Table 1, I.1: T2–T6), i.e. as utterances that “ ‘describe’ some state of aff airs” and thus merely serve to refer to the extra-linguistic context.9 Faraone, on the other hand, takes the fi rst step to a pragma-linguistic perspective by introducing the expression ‘performative utterance’. Th is term (also known as ‘per-formative [sentence]’ or, more precisely, ‘explicit performative’) refers to one of the fundamental concepts of Speech Act Th eory developed by Austin and, subsequently, built on and extended by his famous disciple John R. Searle, now himself a grand old man.10 1. Th e Performativity of Ritual Language UseWhat does performative actually mean? Th e original defi nition is pro-vided by Austin in his Lectures:What are we to call a sentence or an utterance of this type [he refers to utterances such as ‘I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth’]? I propose to call it a performative sentence or a performative utterance, or, for short, ‘a performative’ . . . Th e name is derived, of course, from ‘perform’, the usual verb with the noun ‘action’: it indicates that the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action . . .11 Some decades and innumerable treatises later, in their monograph Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (1985), Searle and Vanderveken characterise this ‘performative sentence’ from a more formal point of view by describing its central linguistic structure, i.e. the ‘performative verb’:Th ese [performative sentences] consist of a performative verb used in the fi rst person present tense of the indicative mood . . . In uttering a performative sentence a speaker performs the illocutionary act [i.e. a statement, question, command or promise] . . . named by the performa-tive verb by way of representing himself as performing that act. Some 9 See Kagarow 1929, 29.10 For a general overview of this theory see also Levinson 1983, 226–283; Mey 1993, 109–177; Verschueren 1999, 22–25.11 Austin 1962, 6."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"360  amina  kroppexamples of performative sentences . . . are: . . . “I promise that I will come tomorrow” . . . “I order you to report to the commanding offi cer”.12Th us by uttering a performative verb the verbal activity is not only carried out but also explicitly indicated (thus ‘explicit performative’).13 Another characteristic is the insertion of the adverb ‘hereby’, “a useful criterion that the utterance is performative”.14As already observed by Faraone, explicit performative utterances are found in many curse-texts in the defi xionum tabellae. It is worth point-ing out that these performatives within a ritual context not only refer explicitly to the action performed, and hence to the circumstances of utterance, but also play an essential role in the performance of the rit-ual. As mentioned before, the verbal performance of aggressive magic is multidimensional; moreover, spells with a diff erent surface structure can have the same performative content. Diff erences in the performa-tive value may coincide with diff erences in the communicative set-ting: actually, in uttering spells intended to cause the desired eff ects ‘automatically’, the defi gens need not necessarily contact gods, demons or other special addressees. Magic formulas, however, are commonly used to establish a verbal interaction with supernatural powers, usually infernal ones (see below).2. Th e Performative Dimensions of Latin SpellsWhat kind of performative dimension does the defi xio ritual involve? Uttering (or writing down) a magic formula is equivalent to perform-ing an action that can be classifi ed into one of four basic groups.15 As 12 Searle and Vanderveken 1985, 2–3. Of course, a ‘performative sentence’ can also have the verb in the second or third person, passive voice, see Austin 1962, 57 (“You are hereby authorised to pay”).

Cf. also Searle’s résumé of the “very confusing history” of the notion of ‘performatives’ (1989, 536f.).13 See Searle 1989, 536: “the only performatives are what Austin called ‘explicit performatives.’ Th us, though every utterance is indeed a performance, only a very restricted class are performatives”.14 Austin 1962, 57.

A typical subsidiary formula is the ‘complaint formula’ (e.g. conqueror), which is part of the legitimation strategy employed by the defi gens. Th e complaint formula is usually combined with the request formula.

For example, I call the direct binding formula the ‘manipulation formula’, since the spells of this group are related to the diff erent manipulations of the tablet that take place during the ritual performance. Th ere are Latin examples that correspond exactly to the Greek καταδː-type, such as ligo or obligo (Table 1, III. 1.):(1) ligo, obligo linguas illorum . . . (DTAud 219)16I bind their tongues, I bind them up [. . .].Moreover, spells in the Latin defi xiones quite oft en consist of the per-formative verb defi go and thus refer to the action of piercing:(2) Malchio Niconis: oculos, manus, digitos . . . defi go . . . (DTAud 135 = AE 1989: 319)Malchio, son of Nico: his eyes, hands, fi ngers . . . I pierce . . .As Audollent already noted, Latin lexis seems here to be richer than that of the Greek κατάδεσvοι: “latino sermone defi gere . . . consueverant, cui verbo par non habent Graeci”.17 Manipulation formulas also ver-balise the actions of writing or submerging the defi xio: in a tablet from Dax, for example, we fi nd the explicit performative formula immergo, ‘I submerge’:(3) Quicumque levavit anulum. Immergo (AE 2000: 925)Whoever stole my ring. I submerge (him).Th e actions to which the manipulation formulas refer are the typical ritual operations performed on the lead tablet (which symbolises the victim), namely the physical and metaphorical acts of piercing, bind-ing, writing down and submerging into bodies of water.1816 Note that the orthography of the formulas has been normalised, and some texts have been reconstructed or modifi ed on the basis of the complete material. In general, unless the text is seriously in doubt, I have not indicated square or round brackets.17 DTAud p. lvi. Th is is not quite accurate: the Greek καταπατταλεύω, ‘I nail down’ does οccur twice within a cursing sequence (DTAud 49 l. 17f. = Syll. 1261; Zieb l. 1); but in each case it seems to be a synonym for καταδː.18 Th is manipulation is not always manifest in the archaeological context, but there are a few examples, such as the Republican text from the necropolis outside the Porta"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"362  amina  kroppTh e second signifi cant diff erence between my approach and the two earlier studies is the creation within their ‘binding-formula’ group of a new class that I call the committal formula.19 Th is modi-fi cation is related to the distinct semantic values of the performative verbs. Neither Kagarow nor Faraone distinguished this as a special category, although they recognised and described the semantic diff er-ences between verba defi gendi such as καταδː on the one hand and παραδɛδωvι, ‘I consign (to)’ vel sim., on the other. Each of these verbs and their semantic equivalents denotes a quite diff erent action: the manipulation (e.g. piercing) of the lead lamella on the one hand, and its committal to supernatural powers on the other. If, furthermore, we take a look at the ritual context, we can see that the committal formula is also connected to another typical operation of the defi xio ritual: not the metaphorical piercing, binding, etc. of the tablet, but its deposition in a place accessible to the supernatural powers (graves, chthonic sanc-tuaries etc.).20 We thus have two diff erent groups of formulas related to two distinct manual operations.In this context, I would also like to draw attention to the Greek formula καταδː τὸν δεῖνα πρὸς τὸν ȇρvʦν (Table 1, I.1, T5–6). Gud-mund Björck regarded this type as a Kontaminationsprodukt, the result of contamination. 21 At fi rst sight, it does seems to be a mixture of the manipulation and the committal formulae: the fi rst part, καταδː τὸν δεῖνα, refers to the manipulation, the second, the prepositional phrase introduced by πρός, points to the contact established between the defi gens and the deity. Such contamination might suggest a tension between the Selbstwirksamkeit des Bindenden, i.e. the eff ects directly produced by the defi gens, and the involvement of deities.22 Björck himself did not account for the phenomenon, but Faraone gives the following explanation (Table 1, II.1): “Th e most common elaboration of the direct binding formula is the addition of the name(s) of a deity or deities who appear as witnesses or overseers of the act”.23 How-ever the spells in Latin seem to indicate a diff erent role of the super-natural powers involved, since the corresponding formulas employ Stabiana, Pompeii (CIL I2 2541 + p. 844 = IV 9251 = ILLRP 1147 = Solin, Ostia no. 39).See Graf 1997, 135ff .; Ogden 1999, 14ff .; 26ff .19 I thank Roger Tomlin for the English translation.20 See Ogden 1999, 23ff .21 Björck 1938, 120.22 Björck 1938, 118.23 Faraone 1991, 5."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":" how does magical language work? 363the performative verba defi gendi, i.e. deligo or defi go, followed by the dative case (see Table 1, III.2). For example:(4) omnes inferis deis deligo (DTAud 199)I bind all (of them down) to the gods of the underworld. (5) tibi, santne Dia (?), defi go [Ro?]danum (CIL XIII 11340. I)I fasten down (= deliver) ?Rodanus to you, holy Diana(?)Th ese sentences give us an additional piece of information by compar-ison with the examples in texts 1–3: this morpho-syntactic structure expresses the direction or destination of a movement and thus refl ects a dynamic in the semantic value of these verbs. Th is solution was already suggested by Fritz Graf, who considers the “addition, with the help of a preposition, of a divine name” as an expression that betrays the establishment of a “relationship between the victim and a divin-ity” and hence translates πρός as ‘down to’.24 Consequently, the verba defi gendi (deligo or defi go) no longer denote just the concrete ritual manipulation but also the act of handing over, the prefi x de- being clearly “associated with the gods of the netherworld”.25 Th e semantic equivalence is clear in formulas that display the syntactic co-ordina-tion of a verbum defi gendi and a verb referring e.g. to a special form of vow, the devotio (see below):26(6) devotos, defi xos inferis (AE 1999: 954)27Dedicated, fastened down (= delivered) to the gods of the underworld. Deligo and defi go in this syntactic structure do not mean simply ‘I bind/I nail’ but ‘I bind down to/nail down to’, and are thus equivalent to ‘I hand over/commit/deliver’ etc. Th e committal formula, which regularly occurs as an explicit perfor-mative utterance, can thus be combined with verbs both of manipulation24 Graf 1997, 125f. Th e old reading dekigo in Text 5 is an error.25 Versnel 1976, 376; see also his paper in this volume, p. 350.26 Th e semantic equivalence of these verbs is also manifest in their literary use. It seems that these verbs assume the abstract meaning of ‘curse’, i.e. they are no longer related to a special ritual context.27 I do not agree with the interpretation of the editors, who equate devotos, defi xos with the words δɛδωvι, παράδιδωvι that appear in the Greek version (side A) (Cur-bera, Sierra Delage and Velázquez 1999, 282).

II.2 and III.3). Th e change is motivated by sev-eral considerations, mainly structural. First of all, the concept of prayer usually implies spoken not written language-use.33 Moreover, one of the remarkable features, especially of Roman prayer, is a strict formal-ism, which can be represented in a fi xed, usually tripartite, scheme.34 Th is Gebetsformalismus is not characteristic of defi xiones, which in general consist merely of the preces.35 Finally, from a pragma-linguis-tic point of view, the term ‘prayer’ implies a hierarchical relationship between orant and addressee, with the latter occupying the dominant position. I adopt the more general term ‘request’ on the basis of Sear-le’s classifi cation of speech acts. He defi nes it as the “attempt to get H [the hearer] to do A [a future act]”.36 Being neutral in character, the semantics of the term has the advantage of not excluding any kind of communicative setting: the speaker may be in a superior or in an inferior position with regard to the addressee, or the relation may not be asymmetrical at all.With regard to its formal realisation, the request can be verbalised within diff erent structures. Just as in the manipulation and committal formulas, it appears as performative utterance. Th is form is regularly expressed with verba rogandi (see Table 2, col. III. 3):(11) vos rogo, uti recipiatis nomen Luxiae (AE 1993: 1008 = HEp 9 [1999] no. 503)I beg you to take (into your power) the name of Luxia.33 “Ancient prayers were spoken aloud or silently or murmured under the breath, depending primarily on the purpose of the speaker” (Hickson 1993, 6). See also Wis-sowa 1912, 397ff .; Burkert 1977, 126–29 = 1985, 73–75; Rüpke 2001, 9f.; 19f.; 105f. = 2007, 3f.; 13f.; 103f.; Scheid 2003, 97f.34 Such formal, even schematic, rules apply to Roman public cult (see Wissowa 1912, 396ff .; Latte 1960, 62; 260ff .; Muth 1988, 307ff .); Greek prayer seems to have been much more variable: cf. Burkert 1977, 128 = 1985, 74 (“variable Grundform”); Pulleyn 1997, 5ff .; 96f.; 133ff . (“minimal combination” of invocation and request); Beard, North and Price 1998, 35f.; Scheer 2001, 34; 38, criticising Ausfeld 1903. A dif-ferent point of view is put forward by Graf 1991, 188–213, esp. 189ff .35 Th is is probably also due to their written character, since the invocation must have been performed orally. An interesting exception is Mainz no. 2 (see p. 166 above; also Blänsdorf 2004, 57f.).36 Searle 1969, 66."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366  amina  kroppInterestingly enough, verbs expressing commands, such as iubere or imperare, never occur in relation to the gods.37 Apart from explicit request-forms, there are partly-explicit or so-called hedged perfor-matives.38 In general the use of these ‘meta-pragmatic’ formulations indicates the speaker’s (or writer’s) awareness of norms and rules of communication and thus can be a mark of politeness or respect. In English or German, these formulations can be rendered by a modal or passive structure which is typical of polite or diplomatic expres-sions (e.g. “could you please pass me the salt” instead of “pass me the salt”; or “passengers are kindly requested . . .” instead of “we request our passengers . . .”).Hedged performatives may form part of a protective strategy employed by a speaker who does not want to expose himself too much vis-à-vis a communication-partner regarded as more powerful or some-how dangerous. Interaction between human-beings and supernatural powers, especially infernal ones, invites such strategies—we may recall that prayers to the gods of the underworld were not spoken aloud.39 Th e only partly-explicit request on a defi xionum tabella, though, can be found in a tablet from Uley addressed not to an underworld deity but to the god Mercury:(12) Rogaverim . . . ut ei . . . sanitatem . . . non permittas . . . (AE 1992: 1197)I would ask . . . that you (Mercury) do not allow him . . . health. Since linguistic choices depend on relationships of dependence and authority, by using a ‘hedged performative’ the defi gens articulates his awareness of the status diff erence between him and the god invoked, insofar as he gives his request a non-peremptory character and, at the same time, qualifi es his own position as dependent and inferior. Pro-tective strategies are typical of prayers for justice, where they are not limited to the request and are in fact even more common in the com-37 Th e only exception is the well-known defi xio from Chagnon, Charente Inférieure (CIL XIII 11069f. = DTAud 111f. = ILS 8752 = ILAquit. Santones 104a,b), which uses the verb denuntio, a technical term meaning ‘to order’. Th is command, though, is directed not to the gods but to the targets, Lentinus and Tasgillus.38 For the term ‘hedges’ see Lakoff 1973, 471, defi ning them as “words whose mean-ing implicitly involves fuzziness—words whose job is to make things fuzzier or less fuzzy”; cf. Verschueren 1999, 193. For ‘meta-pragmatics’ see also Mey 1993, 269–85.39 See e.g. Sudhaus 1906, 187ff .; Bremmer 1994, 39; Van der Horst 1994, 7ff .; Scheer 2001, 49 cites Burkert 1977, 127 = 1985, 73: “in Ausnahmefällen, im Kult unheimli-cher, unterweltlicher Gottheiten, ist das stille Gebet vorgeschrieben”."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":" how does magical language work? 367mittal formula.40 In such prayers the hedged is expressed by a noun or passive verbal form denoting gift or giving:(13) Donatio deis (AE 1986: 483)Gift for the gods.(14) Donatur deo isto decima pars eius pecuniae, quam solverit (AE 1964: 168)Th e above-named god is given a tenth part of the money aft er he (the target) has repaid it.41Besides the explicit performative utterance the formulas of the request group can also be direct speech acts. Such utterances are characterised by a standard correlation between the sentence type (e.g. interrogative clause) and its pragmatic function (e.g. question). In the defi xionum tabellae the request is then formulated as an imperative, by means of which the defi gens gives his instructions to the addressees (the deities invoked):(15) Interfi cite eum, occidite, enecate, praefocate Porcellum (Ol)42Kill him, strike down, do away with, throttle Porcellus.Sometimes the verbs used within the imperative are true verba defi -gendi (see p. 363 above). In this case, they never occur together with the manipulation formula or committal formulas.(16) defi gite, perfi gite, consumite . . . Maurussum (DTAud 250)Pierce Marussus, pierce him through and through, consume . . . him.Th e imperative use of defi gere or perfi gere indicates that the responsi-bility for the act of piercing (i.e. the consequences of the ritual action for the victim) is shift ed to the divine sphere.43Th e fi nal possible means of expressing a request is an ‘indirect speech act’, where “the speaker’s utterance meaning and the sentence meaning [i.e. what is said and what is meant] come apart in various 40 For this term, see Versnel 1987; 1991, and his contribution to this volume.

Th e words are written on a drawing of a bound male fi gure. Olivieri suggested a late-antique date.43 Cf. Faraone 1991, 5."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"368  amina  kroppways”.44 Typical indirect speech acts are “hints, insinuations, irony, and metaphor”.45 Th ese linguistic strategies are usually employed when what is intended confl icts with social convention or the “ordinary con-versational requirements of politeness”.46 In our texts, such speech acts in the request take the form of a wish-clause expressing the negative consequences for the victim:(17) Uratur Successa, aduratur (DTAud 227)May Successa burn, burn away.(18) Quintula cum Fortunali sit semel et numquam (AE 1994: 1072)May Quintula be together with Fortunalis once and never (again).Whereas Kagarow and Faraone considered such wishes to form a separate sub-section within the overall structure of curses (Table 1, I.3; II.3), I consider the indirect speech act simply one among several alternative means of formulating the request (Table 1, III.3). We may note that the agent charged with fulfi lling the request is not identi-fi ed in this syntactic structure. Th ere might be several explanations for this lack of specifi city. Most obviously, the addressee may already have been mentioned in an invocation formula. Or the god might have been invoked orally and so does not appear in the written text at all. It is also possible that the defi gens, conscious of the possible consequences of a wrong choice of divine addressee, was simply be unsure to whom he ought to address his request.47Quite oft en the request is formulated as a comparison or analogy. In this case, the indicative subordinate clause beginning with quomodo refers to the ritual situation, while the main clause, with an imperative or equivalent subjunctive form, elucidates the consequences for the victim (Table 1, III.3):(19) ut muta sunt ossa quae?] sunt ibi, mutos et metu plenos facias, quo-rum nomina hic habes (DTAud 220b)4844 See Searle 1979, 30–57 (quotation p. 30).

In the case of the defi xiones, it is normally the ritual situation that provides the prototype. Th e analogy is, thus, a general strategy of reinforcement and not an independent performative act. For this reason I do not include as a separate heading in my taxonomy (Table 1, col. III.3). In fact, as we can see from the following example, the analogy occurs in combination both with the request and with e.g. the manipulation formula:(21) Sic quomodo plumbum subsidit, sic Sintonem . . . defero ad inferos (DTAud 98)Just as the lead sinks/is sinking, so I drive Sinto down . . . to the gods of the underworld.50Th ere is only one example of a performative verb denoting the act of cursing. Th is is a prayer for justice where the formula refers not to the ritual action but to the act of malediction itself (cf. Table, III; col.4):51(22) Execror qui involaverit . . .

Th e Class of ‘Transformatives’As I noted above, words can “change the world” or create a new real-ity. And at fi rst sight, the explicit performative utterances by which the manipulation or the committal of the victim is accomplished seem to be typical realisation-forms of what Searle called declarations (rather than Austin’s ‘exercitives’).52 Th eir pragmatic function is defi ned by Searle and Vanderveken as follows: “It is a characteristic feature of all declarations that the speaker makes something the case by declaring it to be the case”.53 Th ey hasten to make clear, however, that such ordi-nary declarations are not to be classifi ed with “declarations performed by witches, wizards, magicians, etc.”, even if ordinary ‘declarations’ are the manifestation of man’s “quasi-magical power”.54 In fact through-out their discussion they stress the special character of language-use within non-secular rituals: what they call ‘supernatural declarations’ are a special case:[I]n general declarations require an extralinguistic institution . . . Th e only exceptions to these institutional requirements are . . . that some declara-tions invoke supernatural rather than merely institutional powers.55In his fundamental taxonomy of speech acts (1979), Searle had already stated how he understood the extra-linguistic changes produced by declarative utterances:Declarations bring about some alteration in the status or condition of the object or objects referred to solely in virtue of the fact that the dec-laration has been successfully performed. Th is feature of declarations distinguishes them from the other categories.56In the case of the committal formula, the successful performance brings about just such a change of status or condition: the victim is deemed to pass from the human into the divine sphere (i.e. become sacer), exactly comparable to the results of an offi cial dedication. Th e change of status is of course physically impalpable, the object so dedicated not being visibly altered. Once the ritual (manipulation + utterance) 52 Cf. Austin 1962, 151: “Exercitives are the exercising of powers, rights or infl u-ence”.53 Searle and Vanderveken 1985, 206.54 Searle 1989, 549.55 Searle 1979, 18; 1989, 549; 554; Searle and Vanderveken 1985, 205.56 Searle 1979, 17."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"374  amina  kropphas been successfully performed, the object has eo ipso acquired the ‘status or condition’ of being sacer or, to express the shift in a more linguistic manner: “X counts as Y”.57 On this defi nition, successfully to perform such a declaration implies that there must be some individual, human or supernatural, for whom “X counts as Y”, i.e. someone who will recognise and accept the new “status or condition of the referred to object”.58 On this view, a declaration is an inter-subjective process within a normal situation of verbal communication consisting, at a minimum, of the three elementary factors: addresser, addressee, and message.59 In the case of the committal spell, a communication is actu-ally established between human being and deity or, as Faraone puts it, responsibility is shift ed from the human to the divine sphere.60 It is the presence or absence of a communicative setting that consti-tutes the fundamental diff erence between the act of committal and the manipulation of the victim. Th e former (i.e. the curse and, of course, the request as “essentially hearer-directed” speech acts) requires an addressee (usually encoded by the second person). By contrast, the morphosyntactic structure of the manipulation formula implies the radical absence of a communication partner.61 Th is observation corre-sponds to what Maria López Jimeno has pointed out in relation to the earliest Greek κατάδεσvοι: “Las más antiguas carecen por completo de dedicatorias o peticiones a los dioses, lo cual parece apuntar a una incorporación posterior de este elemento religioso a la tradición y ritu-ales mágicos”.62 I would argue that the absence of communication from the manipulation formula is directly linked to the results produced, or intended to be produced, by the defi gens with his magic spell. As we all know, the aim of the defi gens is “to infl uence, by super-natural means, the actions or the welfare of persons or animals against 57 Searle 1969, 52.58 See Searle 1989, 548 who characterises the “recognition of the audience” as “con-stitutive of bringing about the desired change”.59 For the basic communication models, see Shannon and Weaver 1949, esp. 31–35; Jakobson 1960, 350–59. For a short overview see also Levinson 1983, 15–18.60 Cf. Faraone 1991, 5.61 Searle and Vanderveken 1985, 180.62 López Jimeno 1991, 211. Also Versnel 1991, 61: “Th e involvements of the gods or daemons in the action seems to be a result of an evolution that reaches perfection only in the imperial period”; ibid., 94 n. 7: “direct instructions to the gods or daemons date from the period of the Roman Empire. Earlier instructions to the gods are the exceptions, not the rule”."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":" how does magical language work? 375their will”, usually in a negative way by causing pain or disease.63 In addition, as Faraone says, “the defi gens hopes to manipulate his victim in an automatic way” (Table 1, col. II.1). Both statements underline the fact that, whereas common-or-garden declaratives produce alteration of status and condition (Searle also uses the terms “institutional” or “social facts”), the manipulation formula is believed to bring about the intended negative repercussions “by a ‘mechanical’ and more or less ‘automatic’ procedure” (see above).64 Th ese repercussions are brute, physical facts, namely alterations of body and mind. In other words, this is no longer a matter of “X counts as Y” but of “X is Y”. Th e automatic eff ects attributed to the manipulation formula are also refl ected in the semantics and valence of the performative verba defi gendi. Verbs like defi gere or deligare (without a prepositional phrase, see p. 363 above) denote concrete manual actions that do not imply any communicative intention. Th ey are in fact two-valence verbs, requiring only the thematic roles of ‘agens’ and ‘patiens’. I thus see the manipulation formula as the transposition of a manually-exe-cuted ritual act into language. Th is is, of course, also true of other rituals, such as baptism. In this context, however, it is very important to appreciate the diff erence between the character of the two actions: the manipulation of the tablet stands metaphorically for the aggres-sion against the (absent) victim, whereas the relationship between the concrete act of baptising and the signifi cance of the ritual as a whole (i.e. admission to the community of Jesus Christ) is based not on simi-larity but on convention—in other words, it is symbolic.65 Th is is the reason why rituals such as baptism cannot be performed without the appropriate formulas which have in fact lost their semantic transpar-ency and are understood as referring not to a concrete action but to an abstract concept.Th ese special features of the verba defi gendi do not contradict their performative role, but rather give us an idea of the special function and scope of language used within a magic ritual. Searle off ers the 63 Jordan 1985, 151.64 Searle 1969, 50–53; id. 1995, 41. It is very important to underline again that these kinds of facts can only be created “if there is a successful communication between speaker and hearer” (Searle 1989, 555).65 Th e original meaning of βαπτɛƨω is ‘immerse’."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"376  amina  kroppfollowing account of this sort of “performative occurrences” and the “relation between speech acts and actions generally”:66Any verb at all which names an intentional action could be uttered per-formatively. Th e limitations on the class that determine which will suc-ceed and which will fail derive from facts about how the world works, not from the meanings of the verb.67What does all this mean for function and scope of language in magic ritual? Let me summarise the argument so far. Th e morphosyntactical structure of the manipulation formula does not imply a communica-tive situation. Since the eff ects on the victim are believed to show up automatically, neither dedication nor addressee is required, not even a virtual one to receive instructions. Consequently, the utterance loses its message-character just as the linguistic entities lose their function as signs. Th is is a way of explaining in linguistic terms how it is that lan-guage in a magic ritual can transcend its merely symbolic character. Words themselves are, in fact, believed to act directly upon the target or victim in absentia. Personifi cation of the carmen—which we should understand as tacit acceptance of a belief in the autonomy of words—is documented by Vergil, Eclogue 8. Here it is the refrain, repeated nine times, that organises the description of the magic ritual. Th e line con-sists of an imperative directed to the carmina to make them bring the target back home: ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daph-nin, “fetch him, my charms, fetch Daphis home from town”.68 Since a good omen is given, suggesting success, the carmina, having been launched on their way, must be recalled and soothed by means of the same procedure: parcite . . . iam parcite carmina, “leave off . . . leave off , my charms” (l. 109). Th at is an ancient example; as is well known, the power of words has been discussed more recently by Tambiah, who summarises the view of the Trobriand islander in terms comparable to Vergil’s implicit point of view: “Finally, language as such has an 66 Searle 1989, 535.67 Searle 1989, 557.68 Ecl. 8,68; 72; 76; 79; 84; 90; 94; 100; 104. Cf. Eitrem (1941, 59) who calls this passage “un apostrophe de la chanson magique elle-même”. With regard to the impor-tance of the verbal elements of the ritual he points out: “A ce qu’il paraît, le poète a considéré le canere comme l’élément le plus important de l’acte magique”. Actually, in Th eocr., Id. 2.17f., it was not the songs, but the “magic wheel” that was used to draw the man home."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":" how does magical language work? 377independent existence and has the power to infl uence reality”.69 Th is assumption regarding the exceptional power of words uttered in the ‘manipulation formula’ is, I would say, closely comparable to the evil eye, a power any human being may possess to infl ict harm directly, without recourse to supernatural forces.70As I have already observed, Speech Act Th eory does not take into account language-use within ‘religious and supernatural’ contexts, but considers them a case apart.71 Th is exclusion explains why my manipu-lation formula cannot be classifi ed in Searle’s original taxonomy. Th is applies not merely to Graeco-Roman magic spells but to all types of utterance not used in everyday communicational interaction, such as Indian mantras. I would like to take up a suggestion by the Indologist F. Rambelli who, as far as the pragma-linguist is concerned, comes to rather similar conclusions to those I have been arguing for here: Th e use of mantras determines precise eff ects, such as the transforma-tion of the world. Such a transformation is not just incorporeal, but dra-matically bodily and material, since it concerns healing, worldly benefi ts, rebirth . . . (Rambelli 1993).With regard to the classifi cation of mantras as speech-acts, he encoun-tered the same heuristic problems, “since speech act theory explains usages of ordinary language which have almost nothing in common with the recitation of mantras” (ibid.). As for classifi cation, he ends up by proposing a new category of speech acts: An integral application of speech acts theory to the ritual usage of lan-guage in Buddhism must also take into account phenomena not consid-ered by Austin’s original theory, i.e. the existence of ‘transitive’ speech acts whose eff ects are transferred to another person (ibid.).Th is account fi ts my manipulation formula exactly: the negative eff ects are believed to work ex opere operato. Rambelli’s preferred term ‘tran-sitive’, however, is unsatisfactory in that it focuses solely on the results of the action, thus ignoring one of the main emphases of Speech Act 69 Tambiah 1968, 184 = 1985, 28. In 1990, 80 he quotes Malinowski’s belief that there is “a very real basis to human belief in the mystic and binding power of words”.70 On the evil eye, see Jahn 1855; Kagarow 1929, 1; Tupet 1986, 2606–2610; Dickie 1991; Gordon 1999, 221f.71 Cf. Searle 1989, 554."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"378  amina  kroppTh eory (as a theory of human action), namely the actor’s intentions.72 In view of this, I propose to adopt another key word introduced by Rambelli, namely transformation (“dramatically bodily and material”). Th is recalls Searle’s concept of “alteration in the status or condition”. Accordingly, it would make sense to name my class of speech-acts ‘transformative’, thus emphasising the speaker’s intention, which is to produce directly (or automatically, or without any intermediary) the transformation of the concrete extra-linguistic phenomena specifi ed by the performative verb. Like the manipulation formula itself, such transformatives document man’s belief not only in his ‘quasi-magical power’ but in his truly magical power of procuring alterations in the world through utterance.BibliographyI.

Faraone and Amina Kropp Four of the curse-tablets from the temple of Isis and Mater Magna in Mainz presented earlier in this volume by Jürgen Blänsdorf, and securely dated between 70 and 130 CE,1 use compound forms of the verb vertere in idiosyncratic ways that suggest that their authors were improvising new uses for familiar ‘persuasive analogy’ formulas. In most cases the change in strategy seems to involve a shift away from the traditional concrete understanding of the trope (to invert or reverse the victim’s body, mind or speech) to a more abstract one that takes greater account of the fi gurative meanings of these compound words, namely personal hostility, bad luck and even death. Alerted to this development by Professor Blänsdorf ’s publication of the Mainz texts, we began to look for similar cases in the published literature. Of the total of nine we found, six (including the four from Mainz) are located in Germania Superior, the others are widely scattered between central Italy, western Aquitania and the middle Danube. We also found three other analogous texts, equally scattered in space, from Carthage, Poetovio and the Brenner Pass area. Th is wide distributionof analogous strategies suggests that the phenomenon is independent of hand-books or models and represents the spontaneous adaptation ofan image of reversal drawing on stock-phrases such as mentem or animum avertere, to alienate someone’s sympathies but also to drive someone mad or distracted, or aversus esse a, to be hostile to, to be strongly opposed to. As so oft en, areas already worked for tropes and fi gures in a given culture prove most productive in the creation of new 1 See pp. 141–89 above.

In apparent response to this crime the wife of Florus inscribed a lead tablet with a ‘prayer for justice’ and deposited it in the sanctuary of Isis and the Mater Magna. Her prayer includes the following phrase (ll. 5–8):3 quemadmod<um> hoc ego averse scribo, sic illi (rev.) omnia, quidquid agit, quidquid aginat, omnia illi aversa fi ant.Just as I write this in a hostile way, so may everything, whatever he does, whatever he attempts, everything go awry for him.4Th e phrase averse scribo is unattested in other Latin curse-tablets, and the editor’s suggestion that it be translated ‘I write this in a hostile way’ is well within the range of Latin fi gurative usage (see n. 31 below). In the traditional language of the curses, however, verbs for writing or inscribing with a strong deictic emphasis (note the use of ego and hoc here) usually refer concretely to the act of inscribing the tablet. One would expect, therefore, that the phrase averse scribo should refer to the manner in which the victim’s name is inscribed on the surface of the tablet. In the Greek world, for example, we occasionally fi nd formulas calling attention to the fact that the victim’s name or the entire text is inscribed backwards, such as in this IVª curse from Athens (DTAtt 67): “Just as the words are cold and reversed (ἐπαρίστερα, lit. written right to left ), so too may the words of Krates be cold and reversed”.5 2 For the concept of ‘persuasive analogy’ (magic = good rhetoric) as opposed to ‘sympathy’ (magic = bad science), see Faraone 1991, 8.3 Inv. no. 1.29 = Blänsdorf no. 7 here (p. 172). In Blänsdorf 2005, 21 n. 26, he trans-lated the fi rst phrase diff erently as “Just as I write this backwards. . . .” Th e defi nitive text will be published as DTM 3.4 Th e translation is taken over from Blänsdorf.5 Here the words are ‘cold’ because they are inscribed in lead and ‘reversed’ from the usual direction of writing (left to right). Another good example is a curse of simi-lar date said to be from Dekeleia in Attica (SGD I, no. 40): “Just as these things (i.e. the letters) are backwards so too may things be backwards for her” (ὥσπερ ταῦτα"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":" inversion, adversion and perversion 383Th is kind of analogy, then, sets up a symmetrical relationship between the ritual manipulation of the text and the intended eff ects on the victim. As in Text 1, the relationship is usually expressed by a similia-similibus formula referring to the physical or literal distortion of the text (ὥσπερ or quomodo) as a model for the ‘distortion’ of the victim (οὕτως or sic).6 In our case, however, the name is written in a quite straightforward manner.Just such a symmetrical relation is found in a rather simple curse-tablet from Cologne, written entirely retrograde (Text 2):7Vaeraca (or: Uxeraca), sic res tua<s> perverse agas, comodo hoc perverse scriptu<m> est. Vaeraca, in this way may you undertake your aff airs backwards, just as this this text is written backwards.Th e use of the adverb perverse with the verb agere to refer to the antici-pated situation of the victim is parallel to the aversa fi ant of Text 1, but here, thanks to the fact that the writing is retrograde, the adverb perverse must obviously be translated ‘backwards’. By analogy, the author intends that the aff airs or actions of the victim should likewise be ‘reversed’ or ‘turned the wrong way’.8Another of the new texts from Mainz expresses hostility by means of a diff erent compound of versum (Text 3). Written round the rim of the tablet we fi nd:quidquid conabitur, quidquid aget, omnia illi inversum sit.whatever she will try, whatever she will do, may all be turned upside-down for her.9 ἀνένπαλιν, οὕτ[ω] ἐκείνει <ἀ>νένπαλιν καὶ ἔπη καὶ ἔργα τὰ πάντα γένοιτο); see Fara-one 1991, 7–8 for fuller discussion.

Tomlin, carta picta perscripta: Anlei-tung zum Lesen von Fluchtafeln, in Broderson and Kropp 2004, 11–29 at 25–27.6 For this semantic explanation of the ritual action, see F. Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (Cambridge, MA and London 1997) 209–213.7 On the death of Dr. M. Riedel, curator of the Römisch-Germanisches Museum Köln, this tablet was deciphered by J. Blänsdorf, A. Kropp, and M. Scholz. Blänsdorf presents the text, with a brief commentary, in his contribution to this volume (Text no. 3, p. 168). 8 See e.g. Forcellini 1965, 3: 687, col. 2, s.v. perverse: prave.

No attempt has been made to distort the text physically. However, since the sentence is inscribed continuously right round the rim of the rectangular tablet, it would indeed be upside-down for the implied reader aft er the second turn.10 In the main text we fi nd a similar locution (ll. 5–7): quidquid surget, omnia interversum surgat, ‘whatever she attempts, may all things be turned aside’, where the verb surgere (used fi guratively) replaces esse/fi eri, and interversum is used instead of inversum.11 Th e expressions interversum surgat and inversum sit correspond to aversa fi ant (Text 1)and perverse agas (Text 2), all of them referring to the intended eff ects of the curse. Consequently, interversum and inversum can be inter-preted as semantic equivalents of aversa and perverse. In Text 3, then, we see what we might call an intermediate form. Th e persuasive analogy is never stated, although one might argue that in an earlier version of the formula the expression was indeed part of a similia-similibus formula referring to the reversal of the text. Inversum can thus be interpreted literally as ‘upside-down’, or more fi guratively as ‘perverted’, ‘altered’ or even ‘fi nished’.12 Likewise interversum has a range of more abstract meanings, such as ‘perverted’, ‘frustrated’ or ‘squandered’.13Th ese two expressions in Text 3 (omnia illi inversum sit and omnia interversum surgat) can be further elucidated by what another text, pos-sibly a prayer for justice, against a woman named Tyche or Tychene, the partner or slave of Carisius, from ancient Minturnae in Latium. Th e precise motivation however is far from clear (Text 4):3 quodqu[o]d a[g]at, quod i<n>cida<n>t omnia in adversa. whatever she may do, may all things fall into adversity.14 10 For this ‘magical’ layout cf. also the Latin defi xiones inter agitatores from ancient Hadrumetum (DTAud 275–279; 282–284; AE 1907: 68f.). For a recent discussion see Gordon 2005, esp. fi gs. 4–6 for illustrations of the type.11 Blänsdorf translates: ‘may her striving in all things be reversed’.12 Cf. TLL 7. 2/1 col. 164, 53 s.v. inverto. Th e adverb inverse (ibid. 166, 27) is actu-ally glossed perverse; Forcellini 1965: 2, 925, col. 2, s.v. inverto: perverto (when used in combination with e.g. verba or mores). Forcellini gives the following equivalents, which we have translated into English: ‘turn upside-down, reverse, invert, pervert, alter, change’.13 See also TLL 7.1, col. 2303. 12 s.v. interverto.14 DTAud 190 = CIL X 8249.

Since this formula does not here refer to any actual distortion of the text, it nicely illustrates the abstract or fi gurative sense of both interversum and inversum that we saw in Text 3. With regard to the fi rst section of the similia-similibus formula, compounds of versum may in fact refer to ritual actions other than writing. A well-known second-century CE curse in relation to liti-gation from between the villages of Chagnon and Villepouge in the Charente Inférieure (ager Santonum), for example, combines aversum and the verb surgere in a similar fashion (Text 5).15 Here the analogy is expressed and the verb retains its more basic and literal sense as a verb of movement: . . . sic il[o]s [in]imicos [. . .] // aversos ab hac l[i]te esse; quo- modi hic catellus aversus est nec surgere potest{i}, 15 sic nec illi; . . .. . . so let those enemies be turned aside from this lawsuit; just as this puppy is turned aside [or perhaps: ‘upside-down’] and is unable to get up, so let them (be aff ected). In this case, the persuasive analogy is drawn from the fate of a puppy that was evidently killed and then deposited in an expressive posi-tion, perhaps twisted face- or upside-down, along with the tablets.16 Similarly, one of the tablets at Mainz was found next to a poppet made of clay, which had been broken in two and then deposited with the upper part prone and the abdomen and legs supine.17Sp.), cf.

Blänsdorf 2005, 23f.; in this volume, p. 162). It begins rather simply: Quintum in hac tabula depono aversum, “I set Quintus down in this tablet aversum”. No anal-ogy is stated, but in line 7 two words are written upside-down: Quinti nomen.19 Th e second word, nomen, was probably copied by mistake from an original containing the instruction, “Write the name of the victim upside-down”.20 More important for us is the fact that at any rate in this text aversum means ‘turned upside-down’. Th e author need not express the analogy formally or fully if the text is properly manipulated. We fi nd a similar inversion in a Latin text from Favianae in Noricum (Mautern an der Donau) published by Rudolf Egger (Text 7).21 Th is very odd inscription, which has been thought to be a love charm,22 is perhaps another ‘prayer for justice’. It is addressed to Pluto and Aera-cura, who are equated in the invocation with Iuppiter infernus and Iuno inferna, the ruling couple of the underworld. Th e obverse reads:18 Inv. no. 31. 2 = Blänsdorf no. 18 here (p. 186). 19 Blänsdorf off ers a diff erent interpretation. He translates aversum in the fi rst line refl exively (“In this tablet I curse Quintus, who has turned against himself”) and believes that the name in line 7 was written upside-down unintentionally: the writer started writing on one part of the tablet, gave up and began a new text over the old one on the other side. We think that it is a strange coincidence, however, that both aversum and the corresponding distortion appear in the same text, especially in light of the inverted name on our Text 7.20 Copying errors are quite frequent in Latin curse-tablets, e.g. the text from Car-nuntum cited in n. 23 below. For the case of carta picta perscripta, see, e.g., Tomlin 1988, no. 8.

Th e cursive script is clear and elegant, and is probably the work of a professional scribe. Th e name of the victim, Aurelium Sinnianum Ceserianum, is written upside-down aft er this invocation (ll. 6b–7a,b).25 23 We give Egger’s original reading, not that of AE. Egger cites another tablet, found in infi ll beneath the rebuilt S. gate of the amphitheatre (II) belonging to the canabae at Carnuntum in Pannonia Superior (Egger 1926, 83–90), where we fi nd the vocative forms sa<nc>te Dite pater et Veracura et Cerberauxilie, q<u>i tenes limina inferna sive {sive} superna, referring to the same underworld deities and their canine assis-tant (Egger 1926, 136–38; likewise not in ILLPRON). Such elaborate invocations are common in prayers for justice, and, as Egger pointed out (1948, 118), in our text the complainant’s name, Silvia, is given. On the other hand, there is no reference to a charge levelled at the victim, and the appeal to the deities is peremptory. Egger noted that Pluton is a Greek form, and that the adj. infernus seems literary (1948, 114f.).24 Cf. Egger 1926, 139f., who inclines to H. Gaidoz’ old idea (1892) that the name Aeracura, Aera Cura [also Hera or Haera] might be derived from Ἥρα κύρια, which he picked up from G. Wissowa, s.v. Aeracura, RE 1 (1893) 667. It is however quite uncertain whether the Histrian divinity spelled Hera or Haera (CIL V 8126; 8200) is Aera Cura.25 I.e. C<a>eserianum. Th e implication of Caesarianus is of course that he was an imperial freedman; Egger was inclined to date the script to IIIp (p. 114) rather than the Tetrarchy (when the term Caesarianus became offi cial).

It is also clear, from the paral-lels with the curse from Mainz against Quintus (Text 6), that aversum and inversum can both mean ‘upside-down’.27 Egger misunderstood this particular sense of inversum and thought the force of the anal-ogy was that, just as the name of the beloved man was ‘re-turned’, so he should ‘return’ to his wife.28 Th at was why he interpreted the text as an ‘attraction spell’ (ἀγωγή) rather than a curse against Sinnianus, although he did realise that the second command on the obverse (tra-dite Manibus), well known from other curse-tablets, expressed the idea that the victim should be killed.In Text 7, therefore, the meaning of inversum seems to be bifi d.

Egger had the residues analysed and concluded that the ashes were the remains of an ‘einfach und harmlos’ sacrifi ce: just some bits of charcoal were ancient; some grains of sand, and root fi bres that looked like ‘human hair’, had somehow got in later (1948, 120). In view of the frequent use of poppets in connection with curse-tablets, however, we should not exclude the possibility that these ashes are the remains of a human fi gurine that had been burnt in the pot, although there is nothing explicit in the text of the curse tablet to support this; cf. D. Ogden, Binding Spells: Curse-tablets and Voodoo Dolls in the Greek and Roman Worlds, in Ankarloo/Clarke 1999, 1–90.28 Egger 1948, 117.

Th e injunction on the other side of the tablet, to hand over to the Manes the victim whose name was written upside-down, suggests however a darker and more abstract sense, ‘fi nished’ or ‘ended’.Another example from Germania Superior adds to our understand-ing of the possible double meaning of inversum in the text from Favi-anae. It is a curse from the Schiltachtal in the Schwarzwald, a few km. from Arae Flaviae (Rottweil on the Neckar), aimed at an unknown thief (Text 8).29 It reads:fi b<u>lam Gnatae / qui involavit . . . / . . . ut illum / aut illam aversum faci/ant di sicut hoc est // aversum, Whoever carried off Gnata’s fi bula . . . may the gods render him or her averted, just as this is averted.30 In this translation we have rendered the participle aversum neutrally by its English cognate ‘averted’ in order to allow for a range of pos-sible meanings.31 Although the author makes no explicit mention of the act of writing in this curse (i.e. scribo or scriptum), the full ritual is present, albeit expressed in minimal form by the deictic pronoun hoc, which alludes to the fact that the entire text is written retrograde from right to left . Th e fi nal word of the curse (the key participle aversum), besides being written backwards like the rest of the text, has under-gone a triple reversal in having its last four letters turned upside-down and being written on the reverse of the tablet. Text 8 shows, therefore, that the participle aversum, when it appears in these kinds of magical analogies, means both ‘reversed’ and 29 A full bibliography of curses against thieves will be found in Faraone, Garnand and Lopez-Ruiz 2005, 161–86. 30 H.U.

Indeed, as the editor noted, it also contains a third, more abstract, connotation, for the phrase aversum facere can also be under-stood as the equivalent of ‘to kill’ (i.e. ‘to avert from life’).32 Th is fi gura-tive interpretation is borne out by the similar use of aversum in Text 5, which refers both to the twisted puppy and to the anticipated death of the victim. Th e death of the victim is a recurrent theme in curses, e.g. sanguine suo solvat (Versnel 1991, 84ff .). Since Ulattius Severus’ name (Text 1) was not manipulated in any way, one explanation might be that its author misunderstood the instructions in a hand-book or memorised recipe, or simply neglected to write the text retrograde or to invert the name of the victim. Th ere is, however, another possibil-ity: just as in some of the other texts where manipulation of this kind is absent, the author may have understood both halves of the similia-similibus formula abstractly or fi guratively. Th e phrase hoc ego scribo averse could, therefore, simply mean, as Blänsdorf suggests, ‘just as I write this in a hostile way’. Th e fourth text from Mainz (Text 9) shows a similar aberration that may also point to an improvised abstract or fi gurative gloss on the traditional formula. It is a prayer for justice that concerns the theft of a purse containing money and golden rings.33 It presents the following similia-similibus formula, which we read as follows: . . . quo] mod[i] hoc grap{p}hio averso, quod minime, uti solet, sic [eum] 5 aversum, dii deae{e}que [-2- e]sse sin{e}atis . . .Here, once again, we might expect the words quo]mod[i] hoc grap{p}hio averso to refer to some obvious feature of the inscribed text, but there is no sign of the kinds of distortion discussed above. Th e word graphium, moreover, seems at fi rst sight to be a Greek loan word for a stylus, the instrument used to inscribe the text. In Blänsdorf ’s view the simile refers to the action of erasure (stilum vertere in earlier Latin), so we should translate: “Just as (I write?) this with a bad stylus . . .”.34 Th e act 32 Th e death of the thief is envisaged in a number of other texts, e.g. DTAud 129: uti vos eum interemates interfi ciates intra annum itusm (sic); Olivieri 1899, no. 3: interfi cite eum occidite eni[ca]te profucate.33 Inv. no. 28. 27 = Blänsdorf no. 9 here (p. 175f.).34 Blänsdorf translates: “just as (I write this) with a reversed stylus, which is not as it should be, so may you, O gods and goddesses, allow (him) to be reversed”.

Th e formula can however be better explained as a lexical innova-tion. It is quite likely that graphio was a verb belonging to the spoken variety of Latin, which eventually developed into the modern Italian verb graffi are, ‘scratch’.35 Greek loan words in Latin curse-tablets are not frequent and the cases that do occur are usually of words that survive in the Romance languages. A good parallel is the verb gyrare, ‘circle around’, that appears in some curse-tablets against charioteers (e.g., DTAud 272 l. 12: male gyrent) and still exists in modern Ital-ian (girare). By analogy, the word graphio is probably best understood as the fi rst-person singular, present tense of *graphiare, a synonym for scribere.36 If so, averso cannot be an adjective modifying the noun graphio, but must rather be an adverb,37 and we should translate the entire analogy concretely as follows: “Just as I write this backwards (or ‘upside-down’) . . . so, too, may you gods and goddesses grant that he be backwards (or ‘upside-down’)”. We then encounter the same problem as in Text 1: neither the text of this tablet nor the name of the victim is reversed or inverted. Again we must assume a fi gurative rather than a concrete sense for the participle aversum, and interpret averso graphio fi guratively: “Just as I write this with hostile intent . . . so, too, may you gods and goddesses grant that he be treated with hostile intent (i.e. injured or killed)”. Th e phrase aversum . . . esse sinatis would then correspond to aversum faciant in Text 8.

Comparison with Greek charioteer curses suggests that the concrete meaning may be on the author’s mind, for such curses oft en seek to upset or overturn rival charioteers or their chariots and, like the curse against Maurussus, they do not employ these verbs in a similia-similibus formula. A tablet from Hadrumetum in Africa Proconsularis, for example, reads: “(demon) twist upside-down the soul of Hesy-chius”.39 Late-antique incantations against charioteers found at Rome (Porta S.

Th e text from Veldidena (Text 11) is closer to the new curses from the Rhine, both geographically (it was found in Wilten, a sub-urb of Innsbruck, that is, on the Brenner Pass) and thematically (it is directed against an unknown thief ).43 Th e relevant portion of the text is addressed by a woman named Secundina to the gods Mercury and Moltinus: . . . ut //(reverse:) persicuatis et eum 10 aversum a fortunis <s>u- is avertatis et a suis prox- simis et ab eis quos caris- simos abeat . . .. . . that you pursue him and alienate him from his possessions, from his closest friends and from those whom he holds dearest . . .Here, too, there is no persuasive analogy and, although a similar syn-tactical structure is found in Text 5 (aversos ab hac lite esse), the com-mand seems to fall into another category of curse, those designed to separate people from each other, usually marital or sexual partners (Faraone 2004, 39f.). A lead tablet from Nemea of probably Hellenistic or Roman date, for example, was apparently used in the context of erotic jealousy: “I turn away (ἀποστρέφω) Euboula from (ἀπό) Aineas, from his forehead, face, eyes, mouth, breast, soul, belly, penis, anus, from his entire body”.44 Since our Text 11 includes two fi nite verbs 43 AE 1961: 181.

Recipes for erotic binding-spells found in much later magical hand-books show that these spells could also be used to divert the victim towards someone else: “turn the heart (στρέψον τὴν καρδίαν) of So-and-so (f.) . . . towards (πρός) So-and-so (m.)” (PGrMag XIc.3f., II–IIIp) and “turn (ἐπίστρεψον) the soul of So-and-so (f.) towards (πρός) me, So-and-so (m.), in order that she may love me” (PGrMag IV 1806–08, IVp).

We close this study, therefore, with a discussion of the question whether these new texts from the Rhine provide us with evidence for the use of traditional hand-books, as well as for local creativity, a complex situation that has recently been documented, for example, in the curse-tablets found at Hadrumetum (Gordon 2005). Scholars have shown, for example, that in the Latin West (especially in Britain) ‘prayers for justice’ and prayers against thieves are modelled on earlier curses from the Greek East and suggested that such imitation is best explained by the circula-tion of magical hand-books.49 As in other parts of the ancient world where papyri do not survive, the most telling evidence for the use of such hand-books is mistakes made by the author of a curse or amulet in transferring a traditional formula onto a lead tablet or gemstone, or in copying part of the rec-ipe’s ‘secondary text’ onto the lead tablet.50 We fi nd some evidence of this type of error in the Mainz tablets. In our Text 6, for example, the author inverted the phrase Quincti nomen, where he should have only written Quintus. Th is text, as Blänsdorf points out, was written in classical Latin by an individual with considerable education, capable of using legal terms and the constructions and stylistic devices of Roman 49 Th is is especially clear in prayers for justice, where we fi nd close parallels in the legalistic language as well as in the accumulation of epithets in invocations to the goddess or god, cf. Tomlin 1988, 59–63; Versnel, 1991 and in this volume (p. 334); Faraone, Garnand and López-Ruiz, 2005, 161–86.50 Cf. the bibliography collected in Faraone 1999, 33 nn. 137–40."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"396 christopher a. faraone and amina kropprhetoric. Was he using a magical hand-book in Latin? If he were, it was probably not one that was in general circulation, because, as Blän-sdorf notes, the similia-similibus formulas involve cult-personnel (the galli and the bellonarii) or cultic items (the pine-tree of Attis) that are quite specifi c to the temple of the Mater Magna, and are thus unlikely to have had a wide resonance. Th e insertion of the word nomen does nevertheless suggest a written source of some kind, so perhaps we have to do with a model text that was kept in the sanctuary.Texts 1 and 2 use a participial compound form of vertere, but in gen-eral it seems unlikely that Greek hand-books were the ultimate source for this use of the verb vertere in the persuasive analogies we have discussed in this paper. Just one surviving Greek curse uses the verb στρέφειν or any verb of turning in a similia-similibus formula, namely a third- or fourth-century CE curse inscribed on a small square of papyrus apparently designed to obtain the return of a runaway slave-girl: “As the Hermes-stone(?) of the mill is twisted and as this chit is ground, so too twist the brain and the heart and the mind of Zetous” (ὥσπερ στρέφεται . . . οὕτω στρέψον τὴν κεφαλὴν καὶ τὴν καρδίαν καὶ τὴν διάνοιαν . . .).51 Here, the twisting motions of a hand-mill, as it grinds up the papyrus, are apparently thought to do the same to the victim. But in this case the analogy (ὥσπερ στρέφεται . . . οὕτω στρέψον) clearly does not refer to an inversion or reversal of the text, but to the mechanical rotation of the mill. We suggest, therefore, that the use in prayers for justice of various compounds of versum in similia-similibus formulae may be a local German phenomenon. It is true that there are a handful of Greek examples of using retrograde or spiral writ-ing with analogies,52 but all three come from the Classical period so that it is diffi cult to make a case for continuity. Th e Latin texts from Germany, on the other hand, date from the mid-Principate and are generally consistent in form. Th ey also add a variant never found, as far as we can tell, in a Greek curse, namely the victim’s name written upside-down.53 51 SupplMag no. 56. For more detailed discussion, see C.A.

Th e analogy-formulas on the German curse-tablets oft en work simultaneously on two semantic levels, with a compound form of versum referring concretely to the ritual manipulation of the text itself, but also fi guratively to the desired eff ects on the victim (bad luck, death etc.). In a few tablets, moreover, this semantic shift seems also to aff ect the ritual action. Th us it may well be that the woman who wrote averse scribo in Text 1 and failed to reverse or invert the letters of his name or the text, understood the phrase fi guratively, as referring to her own animosity: “Just as I write this in a hostile manner, so may everything be hostile for him”.

Andrew Wilburn (2005, esp. 180–181), misunderstanding what Almagro Basch says (1955, 25), has recently claimed that “the archaeological context of the artifacts demostrates that the tablets and the funerary urns were buried concurrently, most likely with the knowledge of those participating in the funerary ritual (. . .) For the Ballesta tablets, the discovery of the artifacts within the three funer-ary urns and as part of a shared burial area impliques that the family members or other close associates who were present at the funeral would have been aware of the inclusion of magical objects within the burials. No indication of discomfort or anxiety is apparent in the archaeological evidence or the texts of the curse tablets, which are, admittedly, very brief ”. Th is is quite wrong: the urns and their accessories can be dated to the reign of Augustus, while the three defi xiones were written—and, of course deposited—much later, in the latter part of the reign of Vespasian (see infra).2 I thank the Director of the Museum, Dr. Nuria Rafel, for his aid in my study of these texts.

All are written in rustic capitals, and are to be read from right to left (i.e. retrograde) and bottom to top, although some letters are laid out in the normal way (G, C, Q and D).

As Hans-Georg Pfl aum saw immediately aft er the publication of the defi xiones, he is almost certainly to be identifi ed asT. Aurelius Fulvus, cos.II 85 CE (PIR2 A 1509 = RE Aurelius no. 136); much less plausibly, as his homonymous son, the father of Antoninus Pius, cos. 89.33 T. Aurelius Fulvus, cos.II 85 was in Armenia in 64 CE as commander of Legio III Gallica under Corbulo (ILS 232), and with the same legion in Moesia in 69 when, following his victory over the Roxolani, Otho awarded him the ornamenta consularia (Tacitus, Hist. 1.79.5). He seems to have been a strong supporter of Vespasian, enjoy-ing a second cos. and becoming praef. urbi (HA Pius 1.4); cf. Pfl aum 1952, 198; Syme 1953, 155; 1958, 7; Alföldy 1969, 19f.

Syme, and much later Fabre, Mayer and Rodà, followed by Pi Vázquez, have all argued that in this context, evidently a negotiation with the Roman authori-ties, the title must denote a legatus iuridicus.4 If so, he may perhaps be identifi ed with Q. Pomponius P.f. Rufus, cos. suff . 95 (PIR2 P 749 = RE Pomponius no. 68), who is known to have been in Tarraconensis between 74–75 and 78.5 Th e iuridicus was an offi cial—a relatively young senator, early in his career—responsible for the oversight of the governor’s administra-tion of justice in his province. In view of the probable context of the defi xiones, which I discuss below, the intervention of such a person would be perfectly intelligible. In his immediate response to Almagro’s publication, Pfl aum drew attention to an important dedication on the bridge at Aquae Flaviae (Chaves in NE Portugal) by the ten civitates of the area, dated 79 CE, which likewise mentions the legatus Aug. pr.pr., the legatus Aug. and the procurator Aug. (in that order).6 Since the dedication includes the leg. VII Gemina, however, the legatus Aug. here is clearly the legionary commander, not a praetorian iuridicus. Th e idea that the defi xiones list the same offi cials (not the same per-sons of course) in the same order as the inscription from Chaves is attractive, since the case was heard by the governor’s consilium, that is, the senior offi cials of the province and the governor’s friends, with the possible addition of equites Romani who happened to be in the province on some sort of offi cial business.7 Th e presence of the legion-ary legate on that body might well have made more of an impression on provincials arguing their case than that of a youthful iuridicus.8 (1958, 8). Th e only alternative is his son, Aurelius Fulvus cos. 89 (PIR2 A 1510 = RE s.v. Aurelius no. 135), who seems to have died relatively early.4 R.

With his usual acumen, Pfl aum also suggested in 1952 that this man (the name is rare) must be identi-cal to the Marius Maturus who was the praesidial procurator of Alpes Maritimae in 69, where he raised a force of local upland farmers to oppose Otho.9 If so, we may infer that the decision to appoint him to Tarraconensis was based on appreciation of the administrative experi-ence he had gained while governor of Alpes Maritimae.On the basis of the grave-goods (especially two coins, one with Cae-sar’s head, the other from the mint at Indica), Almagro dated these texts at latest to the early years of Augustus’ reign.10 Lamboglia was still making the same argument in 1959 and 1973,11 Plana and Pena even as late as the 1990s.12 It will, however, come as no surprise to fi nd that it was the prosopographers who fi rst realised the correct date. Already in 1952, as I have said, Pfl aum identifi ed the governor as the grandfather of Antoninus Pius and the procurator as the Marius Matu-rus known to have been a senior equestrian offi cial in 69 CE. How-ever, in the context of his wider conclusions about the development of the equestrian career structure, he linked Maturus’ appointment to Domitian’s restructuring of provincial administration.13 A year or two later, Ronald Syme, who had already argued that T. Aurelius Ful-vus’ second consulate must have been in 85 CE (1953, 155), likewise 9 Pfl aum 1952, 198; cf. Tacitus, Hist.2.12.

In ignorance of these prosopographical arguments, Balil, in his analysis of the grave-goods, came to the same conclusion on archaeological grounds (Balil 1967, 201). He argued that the tomb was earlier than the defi xiones: it was probably to be dated soon aft er the reign of Tiberius, whereas the texts were Flavian. Th ere can therefore no longer be any doubt that the texts from Emporiae fall somewhere between 75 and 85 CE. Th e only question is whether the gap can be narrowed. I think it can. Although Pfl aum asso-ciated Maturus with the Domitianic reform, he did so in the context of his exaggerated emphasis upon that emperor’s role in the process of creating an equestrian career structure. It is now understood that at least twelve equestrian procuratorships existed in imperial provinces already by the end of the Julio-Claudian period, including Hispania Citerior/Tarraconensis.14 Given that he was already a senior equestrian in 69, Maturus’ appointment fi ts much better in the 70s than aft er 82. Th ere is in fact no other argument for preferring a date under Domi-tian. Th e balance of probabilities thus tilts strongly towards the second half of the reign of Vespasian (c. 75–78 CE).2. Th e Historical Context We shall never know the true historical context of these three defi xio-nes and the decision to lay a curse on the Roman authorities. But we can make a plausible reconstruction. It seems reasonable to think that the occasion for the provincial governor, the legatus iuridicus (if that was Rufus’ offi ce), the procurator and the governor’s consilium, as well as representatives of the towns in question, all to be assembled in one place would be proceedings of some sort concerning the re-organisa-tion of their territories.15 Such an occasion might explain the writing and concealment of the Ampurian curse tablets.

Eck, Th e Growth of Administrative Posts, in CAH2 11 (2000) 238–265 at 244.15 Although the ciuitas was the basic administrative unit of the Empire, and had an autonomous administration, not all cities had the same legal status. Th e interven-tion of the Roman authorities usually brought about the gradual ‘Romanisation’ of settlements. However, these interventions were not systematic—at least up to the time of Septimius Severus—and were normally a response to crisis-situations or express requests from the inhabitants: cf. J.M.

Th e implementation of this decree will have involved altering the legal status of these communities in order to make them civitates, and they would therefore have needed repre-sentation at the centre in order to defend their interests.16Th e Indicetani and the Olossitani were two neighbouring civitates (this is the fi rst known occurrence of the latter under this name). Since they were located in the area of Olot, in the interior of the province of Gerona, it seems likely, as Lamboglia suggests, that they should be identifi ed with the Iberian mint that made Ampurian imitation drach-mas, Olosortin,17 in the area of La Garrotxa.18 It has also been sug-gested that they might be identical to the Castellani.19Th e majority view has interpreted these texts as implying a confl ict between two distinct communities. Lamboglia, for example, thought they were written at the instance of Sempronius Campanus Fidenti-nus, the spokesman of the Olossitani before the Roman authorities, once the latter had come down on the side of their opponents:Il fatto che i Olossitani appaiano in opposizione agli Indicetani e alle maggiori autorità della Hispania Tarraconensis viene a gettare un fascio di luce sulla formazione territoriale del municipio di Emporiae e sulla particolare posizione degli Olossitani, come popolazioni del retroterra che aveva ragioni di malcontento e forse contestazioni di confi ne contra la città dominante.20 Bética, in Elites y promoción social en la Hispania Romana (Pamplona 1999) 145–166 at 148. Th is seems to fi t the present case. 16 Pi Vázquez 2005, 174–175, suggests that the procurator was involved because of the concerns of the Imperial fi scus. Given that the context was a hearing by the governor’s consilium, however, on which the procurator would anyway have sat, this is a superfl uous argument, without necessarily being wrong. On the tedium, frustration and delay involved in hearings before governors, see Burton 1975, 99–102.17 Lamboglia 1959, 148–152. However, A. Pérez, Las cecas catalanas y la orga-nización territorial romano-republicana, AEspA 69 (1996) 37–56 at 46, has questioned this identifi cation; moreover, olosortin might be an anthroponym: Mª P.

He thus completely misunderstood the fact that the case involved not ‘councillors’ but the consilium legati.24 My view is shared by Fabre, Mayer and Rodà, 1991, 162. M. Almagro, Las fuentes escritas referentes a Ampurias (Barcelona 1951) 59, had earlier pointed out that these inscriptions in fact contained a curse against the Roman authorities as well as the representatives of each of the two communities mentioned: “Reference is made, in an execration, to some “legati Augusti” in the city (of Ampurias) and some “advocati indicetani” and “advocati olossitani”, public posts that bear witness to the reform, in those times, of the administration of Ampurias, initiated by Caesar so thoroughly that by the time of Augustus, when Livy was writing, the political-administrative unifor-mity of Roman citizenship had been implemented for all the inhabitants of the city, Romans, Hispanics and Greeks, and this might explain why the Imperial magistrates mentioned in the inscriptions were hated so much” (my transl.)."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"408 francisco marco simónas 2a.25 Th at disproves the idea that the defi gens was an Olossitanus, or one of their representatives.

Th is implies that the defi gens belonged to none of these camps or interests.Fabre, Mayer and Rodà suggested that the context may in fact have been a redistribution of land belonging to the city of Emporiae dur-ing the process of defi ning the territory of new municipalities such as Aquae Calidae. In their view, the author may have been a citizen of Emporiae who owned land situated to the east of the city, which was to be, or had been, transferred to the community of the Olossi-tani.26 Th is explanation seems plausible to me: the texts’ content and probable chronology fi t very well with the new situation arising from the grant of ius Latii to the whole of Hispania by Vespasian in 70 CE.27 Th is edict would have been followed immediately by a lex Latii regulating all aspects of municipal life, including imperial fi nances and properties. Th ese changes brought about building and public-works programmes in the newly-privileged communities, such as Aquae Cal-idae (Caldes de Malavella) or perhaps Rhode (Roses), both of which are near Emporiae.28 Th is would be the overall historical context in terms of which we might make sense of the information provided by these defi xiones iudiciariae, leading to future proceedings to be heard in a court consisting of the consilium under the presidency of thegovernor.2925 Fabre, Mayer and Rodà, 1991, 162.

And while Rome did not as a general rule confi scate land from inhabitants of the provinces, merely reserving the right to value it,32 she unquestionably imposed permanent changes on the percep-tion of local landscapes throughout the Empire by this means.33 Hoz and J.

Antistius Vetus in Hispania Ulterior, which took him to Gades: ubi cum mandatu praetoris iure dicundo conventus circum-iret Gadisque venisset. In large provinces, such as Hispania Citerior/Tarraconensis, at least during the second century, the proconsul might send a legate to conduct the assizes instead of coming himself (Burton 1975, 96f.). Th e route taken by the gover-nor and/or his legates followed a set plan (there were 14 assize-centres in Asia, for example), and it is likely that the functioning of assizes was laid out in the provincial edict or the governor’s mandata. Egyptian papyri suggest that, there at any rate, the rules governing the conventus circulated independently, and one could request a hear-ing and resolution of one’s case before the conventus itself, cf. Ando 2000, 375. Burton 1975, 100f. however rightly observes that procedure in Egypt cannot be generalised.30 S.

Th e principals were individuals or groups who were getting ready to defend themselves against their opponents, and they would go to a professional, perhaps a known magician, to make out the defi xio. Th e practice clearly shows the emotional—or not strictly legal—dimension of lawsuits, which were of course heard in public, in some cases at least before a large audience.34Various written testimonies attest to widespread belief in the eff ec-tiveness of curse tablets of this type.35 I will limit myself to those near-est in time and space to the items discovered in Emporiae. Cicero mentions the case of an advocate for the opposition in a private case who, in the very middle of his speech, experienced a black-out, and automatically blamed his lapse on the spells and curses cast on him by Cicero’s client Titinia.36 Similarly, in the middle of the second century CE, the physician Galen expressed his scorn for those who believed in the power of spells, by quoting their purpose in the following terms:“I shall immobilise my opponents so that they are unable to say any-thing during the proceedings”.37 And episodes such as that of Libanius, the renowned rhetor from Antioch, and the dried chameleon show that it was not only ordinary people who believed in the eff ectiveness of spells.3834 Gager, CT 119, in relation to the Greek material, questions the separation of legal from political defi xiones.35 On this issue, see P.

Comparative EvidenceIn 20 CE Germanicus died in Antioch under mysterious circum-stances. Tacitus tells us that he thought that his illness was due to some “poison” given to him by Piso, the governor of the province of Syria. Examination of the fl oor and walls of the house he was living in revealed “human remains”, defi xiones with the name of the prince, ashes with traces of blood and other items connected with magic.56 54 Gager CT, 245 half-suggested an alternative interpretation, which has been devel-oped in more detail by D. Jordan (in personal correspondence, for which I should like to express my gratitude). Jordan argues the term defi xa should be taken not in a technical sense (i.e. preparing a curse tablet), but in a general sense, i.e. list(s) attached to public monuments (i.e. not specifi cally tombs). Th e slave’s act would then have been a public one, not a magical or private one. He thinks there is no reason why a servus publicus might not have posted up (defi gere) a list of wanted suspects, for example. According to this scenario, the sevir L. Cancrius Primigenius, on learning of this proclamation, asked Jupiter to save the city the bother of looking for the men. Th e god, a god of rain and storms, obligingly sent a storm to wipe out the names and thus “rehabilitate” them (perhaps because they had been subjected to some magic procedure). Apart from its inherent implausibility, this suggestion poses problems of a contextual and textual nature. Firstly, the text says that the names were the names of decurions (ordinis decurionum nomina): how could curiales be outlawed in a public act by a slave? Moreover, the verb eruo, which comes before the rehabilitation (uindi-care), means to dig up (out of the earth, vel sim.). Th is implies that the word defi gere cannot mean ‘post up’ but must be being used in its technical sense: we must assume that the defi xio(nes) had been placed e.g. under the threshold, or under the fl oor, of the tombs. Only by digging them up could the decurions be ‘saved’ or ‘rehabilitated’. Th e strong language is surely a response to the collective fears aroused by the malign, secret nature of the attack by the servus publicus, not a dispute over whether Jupiter ought to have been asked to deal with the ‘outlaws’.55 Sevir et augustalis et Flavialis primus omnium his honoribus ab ordine donatus.

Naturally, this type of initiative was equally known in later periods, and to conclude this paper and put the defi xiones of Emporiae into a still larger context, I should like to mention here some examples of malefi cium directed specifi cally against senior represen-tatives of authority by means of what African anthropologists term sorcery.58Th ere are many examples of malefi cia directed against persons of high-status already in the Ancient Near East. Such danger is pre-sup-posed by a Hittite text addressed to the goddess Ishtar of Nineveh, documenting a ritual of counter-magic whose aim was to free the royal family from malign magical attack.59 In the “harem conspiracy” Germanici plumbeis tabulis insculptum, semusti cineres ac tabo obliti aliaque malefi ca, quis creditur animas numinibus infernis sacrari (Tac., Ann. 2.69.5). On this episode, see A.M. Tupet, Les pratiques magiques à la mort de Germanicus, in Mélanges Pierre Wuilleumier (Paris 1980) 345–352, comparing the poisoning theory as against earlier interpretations such as that of F. D’Erce, La mort de Germanicus et les poisons de Caligula, Janus 56 (1969) 123–148.57 Tac., Ann. 3.9–18. See also A. Caballos, W. Eck and F.

Th e fact that the SC de Gn. Pisone patre makes no mention of the rumours about defi xiones etc. con-fi rms Tacitus’ claim that Piso was able to prove his innocence on this point (Tac., Ann. 3.14.2); they were apparently not among the charges that were laid offi cially against him. Th is offi cial silence however is itself evidence for the plausibility such rumours enjoyed not merely at a popular level but also, as Dickie suggests elsewhere in this volume, among the élite (p. 98f.). 58 On the distinction between ‘witchcraft ’ (an innate quality of evil deriving from a physiological peculiarity) and ‘sorcery’ (the deliberate use of malevolent magic using spells or special techniques), deriving from Evans-Pritchard’s study of the Azande, see e.g. Th omas 1972, 551–554, with the corresponding references. It is however a distinction devised by anthropologists for the African situation, and has only limited use elsewhere. In Europe, for example, there is no meaningful notion of ‘involuntary’ harm, except in the special case of the evil eye. 59 “Si quelqu’un a fait quelque chose [de mal] envers le roi, la reine et les enfants royaux et qu’il les a placés dans la terre, alors, vois!

For example, shortly before the death of Queen Elizabeth I of England, two of her ladies-in-waiting found a playing card (the Queen of Hearts) with an iron nail knocked through the forehead.67 At the North Berwick trial in Scotland in 1590, it was claimed that Danish witches had attempted to drown King James and Queen Ann of Denmark on their sea-pas-sage from Denmark.68 Sir Francis Bothwell was accused in May 1591 64 Gregory of Tours (Hist. Franconum, V. xxxix; VI. xxxv) relates that in 580, Queen Fredegunda lost two of her younger children in an epidemic and was convinced that they had died victims of magic practices, a cause to which she was to attribute the death of another child three years later. See Cohn 1987, 194–195.65 In 834, aft er the capture of Chalôn, Lothair I, the son of Louis I of France, drowned a nun, Gerberga, in the Saône “as is usually done with sorceresses”, because of a spell she had allegedly cast on him (Cohn 1975, 150). Gerberga was the sister of Bernardo, count of Barcelona. In 1028 William II, count of Angoulême, was struck down with a mystery wasting illness, which was attributed to sorcery; a woman was accused and horribly tortured but refused to confess; three other women then did confess, which led to the discovery of clay dolls buried in the earth (ibid. 154). In 1308 Guichard, bishop of Troyes, was accused, at the instigation of Philip the Fair, of making a wax fi gure, baptising it with the name of the Queen, Joan, piercing it with needles and throwing it into the fi re, in accordance with instructions from the devil. In fact, the accusations were part of a campaign to launch a posthumous attack on Pope Boniface VIII, and to discredit Clement V and his defence of the Templars (ibid. 185–92). 66 In 1317 Pope John XXII, who was fond of accusing his enemies of malefi cium practised with the aid of demons, had the elderly bishop of Cahors, Hugues Géraud, arrested, tortured and burnt at the stake, and his ashes thrown into the Rhône, on a charge of trying to poison him and cast a malign spell; meanwhile in Italy his allies, the bishop and the chief inquisitor of Milan, accused the head of the Ghibelline fac-tion, Matteo Visconti, of plotting against the Pope using wax dolls. in this case, how-ever, the commission of interrogation dismissed the case on the grounds that there was only one witness, who had been bought (Cohn 1975, 192).67 Rosen 1969, 310–312. Earlier, in August 1578, three dolls pierced with nails were found in a London dunghill, and it was widely believed that they were directed against the Queen (see R. Scott, Th e Discoverie of Witchcraft (New York 1972 = London 1584) 275). R.H. Robbins argued that magic was felt to be particularly threatening during the 120 years following Elizabeth’s accession because this was the period in which the theological concept of witchcraft superseded the old belief in the power of malefi cium, once the idea of the witch as a devil-worshipper had been imported from the Conti-nent (criticised by Th omas 1972, 542).68 Th e depositions included the claim that the defendants “had been given (by the Devil, at Newhaven, near Edinburgh) the recipe for a mixture of venom of roasted"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"420 francisco marco simónof having ordered an image of the King to be cursed by witches.69 Th ere is also the account of the death of Ferdinand, Earl of Derby, in 1595, allegedly by magical attack.70In Spain, at the court of Philip II in Madrid, a young woman, Lucre-cia de León, was arrested in 1590 and accused by the Inquisition of having “contrived” a series of dreams which defi led the honour and reputation of the monarch, by forecasting the invasion of the kingdom by its enemies, its destruction, and the death of the king and his eldest son.71 Th e alleged spells against King Carlos II ‘El Hechizado’, in the context of palace intrigues over the succession, are well known.72 toad, stale urine and adder skin with which to infect the royal linen.

Th is image was spotted, as the same Master Halsall reported unto Master Smith, one of his secretaries, a day before any pain grew, and spots appeared upon his sides and belly. Th is image was hastily cast into the fi re by Master Halsall before it was viewed, because he thought by burning thereof (as he said) he should relieve his lord from witchraft and burn the witch who so much tormented his lord; but it fell out contrary to his love and aff ection for, aft er the melting thereof, he more and more declined.” See Rosen 1969, 305–309, 308.

Kagan, Los sueños de Lucrecia. Política y profecía en la España del s. XVI (Madrid 1991) 18–19). We can of course fi nd a similar use of prophecy in antiquity, such as the Druidic prophecy which inter-preted the burning of the Capitol by Vitellius’ troops in 69 CE as a sign of the end of the Roman Empire and the translatio Imperii to the Gallic west (Tac., Hist. 4.52.2); cf.

For example, the death of the paramount chief of the Kuwsawgu—a division of the Gonja tribe, in modern Ghana—in the late-nineteenth century was attributed to the mystical power of his enemies. Even now, in public the kings wear a vast gown that covers them entirely, oft en with myriad leather amulets attached, so as to prevent mystical attack.73Finally, to take a contemporary example, gossip in Israel has it that certain experts in the Kabbalah laid a special kind of curse, the pulsa de-n(o)ura (דנורא פולסא, medieval Aramaic for a lash or stick of fi re), on Ariel Sharon in July 2005, because he was planning to evacuate the Gaza strip. Th is curse caused the stroke that eventually laid him low. Indeed there is a video in circulation recording the ritual act being per-formed. Similar claims are made about the death of Yitzhak Rabin: he may have been assassinated by a fanatic, but that was because he had already been cursed by right-wing extremists, notably Avigdor Eskin, a member of the Gush Emunim. Although Jewish scholars claim (as one would expect) that there is no religious authority for such acts, the idea of such curses evidently has a powerful resonance at the popular levels of Israeli society.74Th e three Ampurian defi xiones belong of course to a completely dif-ferent social context, but they are evidence of a comparable use of malign magic against political authority. It was precisely their rela-tively exceptional nature in the Roman world (comparable only to the ritual in the Kalabsha temple) that motivated me to write this article.

Introduction: Nails in Funerary ContextsItalian scholars have recently re-opened an old debate about the func-tion of nails discovered in Greek and Roman cremation and inhuma-tion tombs.2 Although some are undoubtedly utilitarian, the widespread presence, in the Greek world as well as in the Roman Empire, of single nails in graves, especially cremation graves, suggests they were delib-erately buried with the grave-goods. Ever since the nineteenth cen-tury scholars have generally interpreted isolated nails of this sort as apotropaic, as talismans to protect the dead person from the dangers of the Aft erlife. Th e alternative view has been that the dead were to be symbolically confi ned to the grave in order to prevent them from becoming revenants. Th ere has however as yet been no synthetic study of the main problems connected with the intentional deposit of nails in defunctive contexts in the Graeco-Roman world. Th e purpose of this paper is to off er a summary survey of the archaeological material, mainly in the western part of the Roman Empire, followed by evalua-tion of the discussion it has evoked. 1 I would like to thank Francisco Marco and Richard Gordon for their suggestions and comments which have much improved this article. My research has been con-ducted as part of the project “Espacios de magia, superstición y poder en el Occidente del Imperio Romano”, fi nanced by DGICYT (HUM 241–29). Note that where it is necessary to distinguish types of graves, inc. = incineration; inh. = inhumation. I have retained the ancient place names in referring to cemeteries where that practice was followed in the excavation-report. 2 See the papers in Heinzelmann 2001; Maioli 2007, 108."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"428 silvia alfayé villa2. Nails, Coffi ns and Grave-goodsSome nails found inside graves were purely utilitarian: they are car-penter’s nails, used for joining timber, either of the coffi n or of the bier used to transport the corpse to the pyre.3 A wide variety of ancient cof-fi ns is attested; in most cases iron nails were used in their construction, but sometimes they were jointed and/or dowelled. Occasionally they were even carved in one piece from a tree-trunk.4 Where the wood itself is not preserved, the existence of a coffi n is inferred from the dis-tribution-pattern of the nails around the corpse and/or from changes in the colouring of the earth which reveal the dimensions of the coffi n. Examples of this are known from the necropolis at Olynthus, and from the Roman cemeteries of London, Lankhills (Winchester) or Sainte-Barbe (Strasbourg).5 Another explanation for nails in funerary contexts is that they had been used in the manufacture of objects originally deposited as grave-goods but now decayed and disappeared. A case in point are the hob-nails used in leather shoes or boots that have been found in graves in Lutetia Parisiorum, London or Lankhills.6However, it is hard to discern a utilitarian purpose for single nails found in a tomb, nails that have never been used, or whose tip has been deliberately twisted—thus calling attention to their non-utilitar-ian signifi cance—or that are “too large to have come from a coffi n”.7 Nevertheless, this last claim must be allowed to be impressionistic: as 3 Cf. for example Angelucci et al. 1990, 84f., fi gs. 33f.; Hachlili and Killebrew 1999, 60–90; Watson 2003, 16; 33f.; 60–63. 4 Cf.

Since a pair of military boots contained around 300 hobnails, it is clear that in all these cases most of the nails must have been retrieved, perhaps for re-use; for other explanations, cf. Simmonds, Márquez-Grant and Loe 2008, 25–6, 115–6, 135.7 Cf. Paris et al. 1926, 88 (from tombs at Baelo Claudia); Kurtz and Boardman 1971, 216 (on the 10–15cm nails from the necropolis at Olynthus); Castella 1987, 32 (the large nails in the graves of Port d’Avenches); Hachlili and Killebrew 1999, 169 (necropolis of Jericho); Maioli 2007, 108 (twisted nails from Italian necropolis).

Th us, for example, some of the nails used in the cof-fi ns of the late-Roman cemetery of Lankhills are 15–20 cm long.8 Th e existence of these and other oddities, such as the presence of nails in cremation-tombs, and the discovery in some graves of imitation nails made of silver or glass—useless from a practical point of view—have led researchers to suggest other possible values of nails in defunctive contexts beyond the merely utilitarian.9Nails found in cinerary urns might theoretically derive from the burning of the coffi n, the bier and/or the grave goods on the pyre, so that their presence in the urn along with the ashes of the deceased would be unintended and thus irrelevant for our purpose.10 Th is expla-nation is plausible in the case of small nails, which might have gone unnoticed by those who collected the ashes and deposited them in their fi nal resting-place; but it is less likely that a 10–15cm long nail would have gone undetected, particularly if we take into consideration the fact that sometimes the nail is actually taller than the funerary urn (Text-fi g. 11).11 But the strongest argument in favour of deliberate inclusion is that, as Bruzza fi rst pointed out well over a century ago, the nail is linked both in cremations and inhumations to a recurrent 8 Clarke 1979, 337; 354; tables 35–37 on p. 332 indicate that most of the coffi n nails found at Lankhills measured 4–11 cm, while the longest were 22 cm long. Such dimensions are by no means exceptional: most of the nails used in the coffi ns from the western cemetery of London are 4–10cm long, but some are up to 14cm long; cf. Barber and Bowsher 2000, 94; cf. also Martorelli 2000, 43 (large nails at Cornus). 9 Gaidoz (in Jullian et al. 1902, 300) noted the discovery of long silver nails in graves from Greece, Italy and France (without specifying the cemeteries in question), and considered them to be ‘magical’; also Martorelli 2000, 43, on glass nails in funer-ary contexts from Piamonte. 10 Th is is the explanation off ered by Almagro 1955, 100, and Vollmer and López 1995, 130–1, 137 n.17–20, for the numerous nails found in the cremations at Ampu-rias. Others have proposed similar arguments for the incineration burials they were dealing with: Uglietti 1985, 561f.; Evans and Maynard 1997, 190; 239 (many small wood-nails; prior cremation in coffi ns in 68 of 121 burials); Barber and Bowsher 2000, 60f.; 104–106; Falzone, Olivanti and Pellegrino 2001, 133f.; Chapon et al. 2004, 133f. In other cases, as pointed out by Ratel 1977, 83, Mondanel and Mondanel 1988, 29, and Simmonds, Márquez-Grant and Loe 2008, 115, the nails might have come from the wooden casket in which the cinerary urn was placed (Evans and Maynard 1997, 239 report numerous small tacks less than 25mm in length).11 As pointed out by Black 1986, 222f.; also Mondanel and Mondanel 1988, 98.

Th e idea that funerary-goods were con-sciously selected, with variations due to fashion and/or local tradition, is supported by a number of studies, mainly based on early-imperial Italian and Gallo-Roman cemeteries (Table 2, p. 433).13 We also fi nd regularities in the positioning of the objects: in the majority of docu-mented cremation-graves, for example, either the lamp and the nail are deposited inside the cinerary urn, or the nail is deliberately placed inside the olletta or the lamp. In the case of inhumation-graves, the ceramic vessel containing the nail and the lamp is usually found at the foot of the skeleton, as at Pithekoussai or Picentia (Table 2). Th ere are however some interesting variations. Th e skeleton in inhumation-tomb Bonjoan 7 at Ampurias, for example, dating from IV–IIIª, was found holding an unguent-jar and an iron nail in its left hand. An almost exact parallel is known from inhumation grave Martí 75, also at Ampurias, and from grave 5 of the Greek necropolis at Camarina, dating from mid-IVª, where the skeleton held a coin and a nail like-wise in the left hand.14 Th is last fi nd also tends to corroborate Jorio’s 12 Bruzza 1874, li–iii.13 I have myself checked the inventories of grave-goods from several cemeteries, such as those at Pithekoussai and Ampurias.

Th e obvious alternative is that such deposits are evidence of a ritual practice linked to a belief in the symbolic and social signifi cance of nails.16 Archaeologists have off ered two hypotheses, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, though they are oft en treated as such: the nails were either apotropaic amulets, intended to protect the deceased from evil in the Aft erlife, or they were protective/defensive, to prevent the dead from returning to disturb or harm the living. Each can be supported by anthropological parallels from all over the world (e.g. Frazer 1933–36/2003) and by the magical value attributed to nails in antiquity. In this paper, I confi ne myself to the latter. 3. Usus clavorum in arte magica valde fl orebat17Before discussing the two hypotheses in greater detail, I should make some preliminary remarks so as to clear the ground. Nails are found in a number of magical contexts in antiquity. One reason for this is that their shape and function make them an ideal basis for metonymic and metaphorical evocation: deictic magical action complements the per-formativity of magical utterance. Nails are ‘good to think’. Moreover, the mere act of driving nails into a material surface can be evoked in many diff erent ways. Literary sources attest to the fact that they were considered a means of defence against malign powers and la male-detta.18 Diseases could be ‘nailed’ and so deictically neutralised; exam-ples are ceremony of the clavus annalis, which was originally linked to public calamity (Livy 7.3.3–8); and a cure for epilepsy recorded by 81, 125); Cabasse (tomb 6, 13, 20); Blicquy (tomb 21, 75, 79, 242, 306); Baelo Claudia (grave 820); Colonia Patricia Corduba (grave 5); Ampurias (inc.

What we fi nd is determined by the actors in ancient rituals, who put objects into graves because it seemed like a good idea at the time”.17 Heim 1892, 541.18 E.g.

On the other hand, as everyone knows, nails were used in an analogous fashion in malign magical curses for a quite diff erent purpose, being driven through already-inscribed and rolled or folded tabellae defi xionum. Here the implicit aggression is directed against the human target; the aim is to ‘fi x’ a malign-magical curse. Piercing poppets with pins was another way of achieving the same eff ect.20 To the expressive values of shape and action we may add mate-rial composition (mainly iron but also bronze).21 In the ancient world special properties, both medicinal (e.g. Pliny, HN 34.151) and amu-letic, were attributed to both these metals.22 Moreover the effi cacy of the metal could be enhanced by taking the metal’s provenance into account: iron linked with the dead, especially the blood of the crimi-nal dead, was believed to possess special potency, which made objects made of it, e.g. rings, particularly valuable to practitioners of (malign) magic like Pamphile (Apuleius, Met. 3.17: carnosi clavi pendentium) or the super-witch Erictho (Lucan, Bell.civ. 6.544–46).23 Th at the practice of extracting nails from tombs for such purposes was widespread in the Roman world is suggested by a funerary curse from near the Porta Latina in Rome intended to deter possible thieves: Quiqumque hinc 19 HN 28.63.

Th ese are the so-called chiodi magici, which are 10–20cm long, made of bronze or iron, decorated with geometrical patterns, sigla and/or charakteres, and show no signs of wear. A com-petent recent catalogue lists eighteen such nails, though at least one or two more have been published.25 With some exceptions, they date from III–IVp. Although the charakteres and other sigla make clear that these objects are linked to magical practices, the lack of provenance (most have come to light via the antiquities trade) means that their interpretation is problematic. Th e decisive fact for me is that, unlike the material I have presented in §2, not one of these nineteen chiodi magici demonstrably derives from a funerary context. We may in fact doubt whether such nails form a coherent func-tional group. Th e one that forms part of the so-called magician’s kit (IIIp) found in the 1890s the lower city of Pergamon and now in the Antikensammlung, Berlin is generally thought to have been used in divination, although its precise mode d’emploi is controversial.26 Th is may well have been the function of several others too, such as the one found in the Rath/Apollo sanctuary of S. Antonio, in Caere.27 Jobbé-Duval however suggested many years ago that the nails used to cure epilepsy (cf. the passage of Pliny cited n. 19 above) may have been of this type.28 For his part, Toutain thought that some related Gaulish examples may have been placed in sanctuaries as votive objects.29 Th e 24 CIL VI 7191 = ILS 8188. Cf. Brelich 1937, 12f.; Storoni 1973, 126f. no. LXII; Maioli 2007, 108. Admittedly the aim of such theft may have been simply utilitarian (cf. n. 6 above), like stripping churches of their lead and copper nowadays.25 Bevilacqua 2001.

Although he does not specify where these nails were found, he may have been referring to the red-painted nails found in the fanum of Harfl eur and in the thermal sanctuary of Fontaines-Salées, which were identifi ed by their discoverers as clous votifs; cf.

Th e smaller exam-ples may have been worn around the neck or elsewhere on the person as protection against the evil eye or malign-magical attack. Th e domi-nant interpretation of the larger ones since the 19th century is that they were placed in tombs along with other grave goods as phylacter-ies.32 In other words, they are deemed to be functionally identical with the very much larger number of uninscribed nails certainly found in such circumstances. As I have pointed out, this cannot be confi rmed in any instance, and in some cases is certainly wrong. It is of course thinkable that they are simply expensive equivalents of uninscribed defunctive nails, but there as yet is no proof (and even if one were ever actually to be found in a grave, its interpretation would only be an inference, not a ‘fact’) and in my view it would be best to reserve judgement on the matter.4. Th e Magical-ritual Use of Nails in CemeteriesDisregarding the chiodi magici as perhaps a special case, the over-whelmingly dominant interpretation of the defunctive nails surveyed 30 Th ese nails are between 14 and 26cm long, and bear inscriptions (individual let-ters and geometrical shapes). Th ey are dated V–IVª. Th eir interpretation, like that of the inscribed metal plaques from the same site, is controversial: Ghirardini thought they were specially-made votives never intended to be used (1888, 20–37; 317–323); Whatmough 1922 saw them as votive hairpins dedicated by women before marriage; Pellegrini and Prosdocimi believe that they are non-functional Schreibgriff el linked to a sanctuary where writing was a votive custom and had a predominantly magi-cal-ritual use (1967, 140–168; cf.

I do not dispute this, but wish simply to argue that nails in a funerary context may also have had other symbolic meanings which ought not to be disregarded (§4.2–3). Th is justifi es the word ‘polysemic’ in my title.4.1. Nails as Apotropaic AmuletsTh e apotropaic use of nails has been recorded sporadically for the Greek world, including Athens, Olynthus and Sicily.33 Most recorded cases are however Roman, dating mainly to the period Iª–IIp. As I have pointed out, most scholars have identifi ed such nails as ritually-deposited apotropaic talismans.34 In the case of the nails found in or by Jewish tombs of the Second Temple Period in Palestine, Hachili and Killebrew have argued that they are evidence of a custom taken over from Greek usage. Th is cannot be shown directly, but they cite some (much) later Rabbinical texts that speak of placing iron objects between or inside tombs to protect them against harmful spirits.35 As for the occasional fi nds of nails in late-antique tombs, they were once believed, under the infl uence of the hagiographic and apologetic tradi-tion, to be instruments of martyrdom, but are now generally under-stood, along with bells, animal-teeth, coins and semi-precious stones, as apotropaic amulets.36 A variant of this apotropaic hypothesis is that the nails may have been understood as protecting the deceased from actual profanation of the grave by metal-robbers or by magical practioners.37 Quite how the nails are supposed to be eff ective in this context is, however, not clear 33 Elworthy 1895/1970, 328f.; Orsi 1899, 256 n. 2; Kurtz and Boardman 1971, 216; Cutroni 1995, 193 n. 7.34 Bruzza 1874, 51; Saglio 1892, 1244; Cagnat and Chapot 1920, 195; Baradez 1959, 217–8; Wernet 1970, 12–14; Raddatz 1973, 38; Nierhaus 1959, 48–9; Uglietti 1985, 562 n. 7; García Prósper and Guérin 2002, 210f.; Hoskins 2005, 277, n. 46; Moreno 2006, 250.35 Hachlili and Killebrew 1999, 139f., 169; Hachlili 2005, 494, 511–516.

Can a nail really be understood as a form of mute curse? 4.2. Nails for Keeping the Dead in PlaceFour types of dead were commonly thought in the ancient world to be dangerously ‘restless’, i.e. tended to haunt the place where they had died: those who had died prematurely (Gk. aōroi), those who had died violently (Gk. biaiothanatoi), those who had not received proper funeral rituals (Gk. ataphoi, Lat. insepulti), and those who had died before they were able to marry for the fi rst time (Gk. agamoi, Lat. innupti).38 Given that fear of revenants or morts malfaisants is well-attested in antiquity, and that iron nails were believed to be able to ‘fi x’ dangerous supernatural forces, some scholars have suggested that this type of magic may also have served to protect the living against the dead.39 Th ere is one ancient source, albeit a burlesque, that repeatedly refers to the use of iron bonds, magicum ferrum . . . vincula ferrea (§2; cf. 16), to fi x a ghost. Th e topic of one of the pseudo-Quintilianic declama-tions (IVp) is the attempt by a woman to sue her husband for having hired a magician to ‘fi x’ the ghost of her son who enjoyed repeated visits to her aft er his cremation, embracing her and remaining by her all night long.40 Th e idea seems to have originated in taking the wish sit tibi terra gravis literally (e.g. §7) and exploring the result-ing possibilities in as absurd a manner as possible; the information about the alleged rituals is of course vague in the extreme (the rhetor was simply recycling literary tropes).

Like nails, chains or stanchions are physical objects that can be evoked in a number of diff erent ways. It is familiar that statues of deities and heroes might be bound with chains as a punishment or to prevent them from moving; Pausanias for example describes how the inhabitants of Orchomenus, following the directions of the Delphic oracle, settled the malign ghost of Actaeon by giving proper burial to his remains and erecting a bronze statue to him and fi xing it to a rock with iron.41 Pseudo-Quintilian also mentions that the magician placed stones on the youth’s corpse (§8: ferro . . . ac lapidibus artare, cf. 15), a ritual to prevent the dead from rising that happens to be documented archaeologically in some of the Roman cemeteries stud-ied in this paper.42 Th e magical practice of throwing spears—certainly not swords—over the tomb or the corpse so as to fi x “the emerging ghost or render it powerless” (Cary and Nock 1927, 27)—also has an archaeological correlate.43 Th e pseudo-Quintilianic text purports to describe a complex ritual to fi x an already active ghost. From there it is no great step to thinking that nails may have been pre-emptively deposited in tombs to prevent the dead from returning to disturb the living. A number of archaeolo-gists have done just this, for example Doorselaer (Roman-period tombs in northern Gaul); Petit (long iron nails placed on the lids of coffi ns at Lutetia); Giuntella (nails deliberately placed beside late-antique graves on Sardinia); Hachlili and Killebrew (likewise, Second Temple period Jewish tombs in Palestine); and Remesal (bronze nails beside tombs at Baelo Claudia).44 In the early 1960s, Bérard interpreted the tips of 41 Paus. 9.38.5, cf.

Var, I-IIIp) as “une véritable ceinture prophylactique”.45 He reads one case in particular, the infant-burial in tomb 40, where clusters of four nails were found enclosing three olpai (jugs), a lamp and the child’s skull, as an eff ort magically to fi x an aōros to the grave. Some of these nails were bent or had been deliberately thrust into the earth, a feature paralleled in other Roman cemeteries, such as those of Picentia, Via Flaminia, Baelo Claudia, Ampurias or ‘El Albir’, Valencia.46 At all these sites, the practice seems to be employed systematically, i.e. non-casually, which increases the likelihood that this was a deliberate ritual practice intended to fi x the dead. It is apparent from the archaeological record that such ‘fi xing’ ritu-als were generally performed at the same time as the corpse (or ashes) was deposited in the tomb. Th e pseudo-Quintilianic declamation sug-gests however that there was, or might be, a scale of ritual violence that could be exerted upon the dead. Th e most extreme form of such violence—no doubt only in the case of very recalcitrant ghosts—was to pierce the skull and/or other parts of the body with nails. Th is practice is documented archaeologically for the ancient world: although nails found within skeletal remains may occasionally be otherwise explained (e.g. decomposition and collapse of the coffi n), it is usually clear that the nails had been deliberately driven through the skull, the limbs or 2005, 511f.; Remesal 1979, 41 (noting “el considerable número de clavos de bronce aparecidos fuera de las tumbas de la necrópolis de Baelo Claudia, colocados entre las piedras que rodean las tumbas con la punta hacia fuera”); Sillières 1995, 98.

Other singular arrangements of nails detected in various Gallic-Roman cemeteries have also been interpreted from a magical point of view; for example, cf. Laet et al. 1972, 30, 115, pl. 72, 149b; Autexier 1976, 81 n. 7; Autexier et al. 1978, 64; Chevillot and Moissat 1980, 227–8; Mondanel and Mondanel 1988, 98; Allain 1972, 26, fi gs. 3–4; Allain et al. 1992, 128–129. However, as Ratel points out 1977, 83, the systematic identifi cation of these bizarre distributions of nails as ritual evidence ought to be treated with caution.46 Picentia: Lagi de Caro 1995, 347f.; Via Flaminia: Ortalli 2001, 237 fi g. 2; Baelo Claudia: Paris et al. 1926, 118f.; 190 nos. 46f.; Ampurias: Almagro 1955, 91 fi g. 69 etc.; ‘El Albir’: González 2001, 360, who does not provide an explanation regarding the peculiar placing of “dos clavos de gran tamaño introducidos en la tierra con la punta hacia abajo”, placed under the tombstones and fragments of dolia which formed the grave."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"448 silvia alfayé villathe abdomen.47 It has even been suggested that the piercing of Oedi-pus’ feet alludes to this practice, since it “seems to be a preemptive ritual designed to cripple a ghost in its eff orts to gain revenge”.48Th ese two major hypotheses interpret the presence of one or more nails in a tomb as a sympathetic magical practice primarily intended to achieve one of two main conscious intentions: to ward off supernatu-ral danger from the deceased, and to protect the living from revenants by symbolically confi ning them to the grave.49 In any given case, unless other analogous items are also present in the tomb, it is almost impos-sible to decide between them. Heuristically however we may posit a continuum between the two poles, apotropaic and ‘fi xing’: it seems obvious that practices such as weighing down the corpse with stones, or driving nails through it, are to be located much farther towards to the latter pole than the mere burial of nails beside a tomb. Many cases, perhaps the majority, will have been located somewhere in the middle of the continuum, since the one intention by no means excludes the other. I incline in fact to view the deliberate deposition of nails in a funerary context as a ritual both for and against the dead, a magical practice that included both rituals expressive of aff ection and rituals intended to avert trouble from the unquiet dead. It may also be that in many cases local custom or belief prescribed the dominant symbolic purpose of such rituals.4.3. Some Deviant CasesTh is is however not quite the end of the story. Th ere are a number of archaeological fi nds of nails in a funerary context that do not fi t this dual protective/defensive pattern but seem to reveal other, diff erent, symbolic intentions. Th ey serve to confi rm my earlier point about the evocative power of objects such as nails. At any rate, it seems clear that these could be employed in defunctive contexts other than for protec-tive purposes. We may take as an example inhumation-grave 110 at Pithekoussai on Ischia (IIp), where a log was found on the corpse’s 47 Cf. Jobbé-Duval 1924/2000, 179–193; Alfayé 2009, eadem, forthcoming. On this practice in the Mediaeval period, cf. Caciola 1996, 15–34; for modern parallels cf. Lawson 1910, 361–484; Frazer 1933–6/2003, I, 75–87. 48 Faraone 1991, 182 n. 62; 194, n. 103.49 Th e dual intention has been pointed out by Wolters 1935, 35–36; Wernet 1970, 14; Ratel 1977, 95f.; Chevillot and Moissat 1980, 228–9; Guillier 1992, 27; Hachlili and Killebrew 1999, 139f., 169; Ortalli 2001, 236f; Maioli 2007, 215."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":" nails for the dead 449abdomen with a 12cm long iron nail hammered through it, the tip pointing towards the skull.50 A similar ritual practice, dating some fi ve centuries earlier (IIIª), is attested by inhumation-grave 49 of the same necropolis, and in other Roman graves in the cemetery of S. Montano, also on Ischia.51 No ready explanation for this practice is available. Th en again, nails may be associated with defi xiones in an atypical man-ner, for example in the cremation zone of the cemetery of Skt. Sev-erin at Mautern on the Danube (Austria); or at Ampurias, where the famous curse tablets were found in ash-urns along with small head-less nails—possibly evidence of a ritual performed to empower the execration.52 Finally, many cases in Gallo-Roman cemeteries (I-IVp), and elsewhere, indicate that nails might be used to infl ict ritual dam-age on grave goods such as ceramics or metal vessels.53 5. Magical Solutions to Deadly Problems54Such considerations are however relatively marginal. Th e ritual depo-sition of nails in graves seems mainly to have been apotropaic (against attack by malign spirits), protective/defensive (to protect the living from potential revenants), or a mixture of both.55 Unfortunately, we cannot tell whether the practice was reserved for the tombs of people who, given the circumstances of their death or their degree of social deviancy, were thought particularly likely to become ‘restless dead’.56 We can well imagine however that an attempt might have been made to neutralise such potential threats by recourse to ritual action. It is 50 Buchner and Ridgway 1993, 126f. nos. 110–3 and 4, pl. CXI, no. 20. 51 Buchner and Ridgway 1993, 74–76, 126, pl. XCI no. 22.52 Mautern (IIIp): Scherrer 1998, 26f. ; 71–79, pls. 14–15; Ampurias (Iª): Almagro 1955, 61–62, pls. 22f. (inc.-tombs Ballesta 22 and 23). Apart from resp. four and two “vástagos cuadrados de clavitos sin cabeza”, the grave goods consisted of a cinerary urn, the defi xiones and, in the case of tomb 23, a small bronze tablet. Th e inclusion of nails, therefore, appears to be deliberate. On these curse tablets, cf. Wilburn 2005, 156–83; and see further the paper by F. Marco Simón above (p. 399).53 See Bérard 1963, 302–306; Ratel 1977, 92, 95 pl. 10; Chevillot and Moissat 1980, 207–14, 233–4, fi gs. 7–9; Mondanel and Mondanel 1988, 93f.; Simon-Hiernard 1990, 50, plate 25; Allain et al. 1992, 129, plates 40–4.

Judging from the documentation analysed here, the prac-tice established itself in the western part of the Roman Empire during the Late Republic and became increasingly common during the High Empire. Th is chronological and geographical spread still needs to be explained. We must also reject mono-causal explanations in favour of multi-factorial approaches more in keeping with the polysemic signifi cance of the nail in the ancient world. Just to take the evidence of tomb 40 at ‘La Calade’, we can fi nd nails employed in the construction of the coffi n, used to pass grave-goods ‘over’ into the next world, and again as ritual deposits of my type.58 It is however obvious that if we are to expand our material basis, we need meticulous excavations that actu-ally see the light of day; we also need further secondary studies docu-menting the distribution, orientation and context of nails found in the archaeological funerary record.59 More primary material and further careful analysis off er the only hope of identifying the symbolic value of such nails more precisely, and so ultimately of teasing out their multi-ple meanings. Unfortunately, nails continue to be considered archaeo-logically insignifi cant, and reports of cemetery excavations oft en lack detailed information on such items. Nevertheless I believe that we already possess suffi cient data to sup-port the view that the deliberate deposition of nails in tombs is a dual form of protective magic. Th is conclusion does not necessarily exclude other explanations; we should be looking for mutually complementary accounts. As Lombardi puts it: 57 On this category, see Jobbé-Duval 1924/2000, 68–73; Vtervrugt-Lentz 1960; John-ston 1999, 161–199.

For these pseudonymous or anonymous works were ‘living texts’, constantly borrowing from one another in search of authority and materials.2 Th e most familiar extant source for the ancient post-Th eophrastan literature of stones and their properties is of course Pliny’s Historia Naturalis Books 36–37, referring to numerous earlier writers in Greek and one or two in Latin, but important additional information is supplied by the 774 hexameters of the Greek Orphic Lapidary,3 and a number of related texts of uncertain but relatively late date which were fi rst published as a group by Eugen Abel in 1881 (Abel 1881), followed by de Mély in 1898 (de Mély 1898), as part of his great joint work with C.E.

Gr. 2424, also contains several writings on astrology and divination, including one by ‘Astrampsychus’.6 Th e Lapidary is found on f.190, in a column that also contains citations from the Pythagoreans and Posidonius on the formation of comets, a citation from ‘Demostratus’ on the magical properties of seal-fat, and extracts from Timothy of Gaza’s bulky work on zoological curiosities.7Th e text lists just seven or eight stones said to benefi t navigation, and the amulets to be made to achieve this purpose. Almost all these stones have external physical properties that connect them metonymi-cally with the sea: they may be transparent or green, or blue, or their fi ery red colour connotes storms and lightning. Th is and other lapidar-ies ascribe to such amulets the property of warding off misfortunes at sea, or of allowing the victims to survive them. Ships are tacitly under-stood to be exposed to the negative infl uence of natural phenomena that originate in the depths and aff ect the surface (e.g. tsunamis); and to atmospheric phenomena that may harm or sink them, such as light-ning, hailstorms, typhoons and hurricanes.

Th e coral, sewn into a piece of seal-skin and tied as an amulet to the top of the mast, serves to counter the winds, waves and turbulence in all manner of waters.6. Th e snake-belly stone is formed (lit.: is generated) in the mountains of Egypt. It has scales laid out in rows like the belly of a snake. Who-ever carries it with him will be thoroughly safe from danger during storms at sea.7. Th e obsian stone (obsidian) is not completely black but has a green-ish tinge. It is found in Phrygia and Galatia. It is also called the ‘pitch’ stone because of the smell of pitch it emits when rubbed. When worn, it helps those who travel by sea or on rivers.It is worth providing a brief commentary here on the qualities of these eight stones, stressing the properties, particularly the aquatic or marine connections, that are assigned to them by other Lapidaries.81.1. Anthrax and ChalcedonyAnthrax, in Latin carbunculus, also known as anthracites,9 is a ‘false haematite’, since it resembles that stone as regards its shine and black 8 Th e term ‘stone’ is generic in the Lapidaries. No distinction is made between crystalline and amorphous rocks, vitreous rocks (such as obsian/obsidian) and organic gems (either fossil or animal, coral being the most important of the latter group). 9 Pliny, HN 36.148, cites Sotacus as his authority for the name anthracites. Isidore explains the shade of diff erence between the two stones: “Of all the igneous gems, the main one is the carbuncle, so called because it has a glowing colour like coal, whose gleam even the night cannot reduce, as it shines in the dark in such a manner as to launch its rays into the eyes (cuius fulgor nec nocte vincitur; lucet enim in tenebris adeo ut fl ammas ad oculos vibret). Th ere are twelve distinct types; the most notable are those that seem to shine and give off a type of fi re. In Greek, the carbuncle is called anthrax. It is found in Libya, among the cave-dwellers. Anthracitis is so called because it has the colour of fi re, like the carbuncle, but it has a white band round it. One of its properties is that when it is thrown onto the fi re, it is extinguished as if it were life-less; however, when it is sprinkled with water, it shines even more (cuius proprium est quod iactatus igni velut intermortuus extinguitur, at contra aquis perfusus exardescit)” (Isidore, Etym. 16.14.1)."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" magic at sea 461colour, but not internally, or in terms of hardness. Th e name suggests that it is not a crystalline stone but fossil coal.10 But coal is obviously not a precious stone, so we should assume, as is generally done, that the name was given, by extension, to stones that have a fi ery red colour, resembling embers. It has been suggested that it might be a ruby,11 though in his lengthy account of this stone Pliny makes no allusion to the sea (HN 37.92–98). It might also be a garnet or spinel. Th ese stones are known as ‘anthrax stones’ because of their deep red colour.12 However, here again there is no obvious link to water.13 Th e Lapidary of Socrates and Dionysius claims that the chalcedony is fl ame-coloured (τὴν χροιὰν πυραυγής), just like the anthrax-carbuncle, which would explain why the Nautical Lapidary links them here.14Although the Nautical Lapidary is the sole text to link the anthrax-carbunculus with life-saving at sea, two other Lapidaries specify that the chalcedony does precisely this. Th ey also provide parallel, though distinct, instructions concerning the appropriate image to be engraved. Th e closest is Damigeron-Evax, which off ers a direct translation of the anthrax-entry in the Nautical Lapidary: Qui portaverit eum a pueritia numquam mergetur neque vexabitur (27.2).15 It also suggests another kind of connection with water: calchedony cures those suff ering from dropsy (aquaticos curat), implying that it was supposed to have diuretic properties. Th e appropriate image to be engraved on the stone is an 10 It has been suggested however that it is not coal but a true stone (unspecifi ed), a mixture of magnetite and limonite, cf. Bouveret, in the Budé, ad loc., p. 220. Th ese two minerals are in fact ‘related’ to haematite: magnetite dust is black and limonite dust yellow. Th is may be the link with Sotacus-Pliny’s claim that, when rubbed on a hone with water, one end produced a black mark, the other a yellow one (HN 37.148; cf. 18.261; 36.164f.). Sotacus himself explicitly did not classify his anthrakites as a haematite (alterius generis quam haematitem).11 King 1865, 51f., quoted by Halleux and Schamp 1985, 333.12 Epiphanius of Salamis, in the fourth century CE, refers to the red colour of the anthrax stone (De gemmis 1.4).13 Cf. n. 9 above.14 Socr. et Dion. 29.1f. It is further said to be a pure lignite or carbuncle, of the colour of blood (αἱματοειδής). Chalcedony however is not red, although this mineral does have a large number of iron silicate varieties. A “deep red chalcedony” is per-haps really a red jasper, with a dull shine, or more probably a cornelian of a bright watery-red colour.15 Th e passage continues: Pulchrum quoque facit gestantem et fi delem et potentem et omnia perfi cientem, “It renders the bearer handsome, able to keep his word, powerful, and in everything eff ective”. Damigeron-Evax has two entries Lapis chalcedonius. Of these, §33 just says: Lapis pertusus et aptatus ferro, qui eum portat vincit causas, “If pierced and set in a ring, chalcedony gives success in lawsuits to the bearer”."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"462 sabino perea yébenes“armed Mars or a virgin with a long [loose] dress holding a laurel branch” (27.4).16 Th e Lapidary of Socrates and Dionysius provides the following account:If this stone be engraved with a standing Athena holding a bird called erodios (ὄρνεον τὸ λεγόμενον ἐρωδιόν) in her right hand, and a helmet in her left hand, and (the stone/seal) carried on the person aft er it has been consecrated, it will give to whoever carries it victory over his enemies and rivals. It will cause him to behave with kindness and understand-ing, and will enable him to carry out whatever he proposes, and survive shipwrecks (ναυαγίων ἀνερώτερον).Socr. et Dion. 29.3Th e motif of Athena and the erodios is an implicit allusion to Iliad 10. 272–82, where Athena causes a bittern (vel sim.) to call as a reassur-ance to Diomedes and Odysseus on their night-raid:Th e two men, having put on their fearful armour, set off , leaving behind there all the most important chiefs. On their right, close to the path, Pal-las Athena sent them an ἐρωδιός. In the darkness they did not see it with their eyes, but they heard its cry (ἀλλὰ κλάγξαντος ἄκουσαν). Odysseus was pleased with this omen. He prayed then to Athena:“Child of aegis-bearing Zeus, untiring goddess, hear me. You’ve always stood beside me in all sorts of troubles. I don’t move without your watching me. But now especially be my friend, Athena. Grant that we two come back to the ships covered in glory, aft er doing something great, something the Trojans will be sorry for”.17Athough this particular iconography of Athena/Minerva is unknown on gems from the Roman period, a close parallel, with the helmet 16 Sculpere oportet in eo Martem armatum aut virginem stolatam, [vestem circum-fusam] tenentem laurum. Vestem circumfusam, which is found in three mss. [C, P, T], is rightly treated by Halleux-Schamp as a gloss. For the standard iconography of ‘armed Mars’, see E. Simon, s.v. Ares/Mars, LIMC 2.1 (1984) 505–59; 2.2 (1984) 378–425. I guess that the female fi gure with the laurel is an error for Victoria with the palm-branch; for Mars with Victoria, see Simon, ibid. nos. 301–18.17 See also Orpheus, Argon. 694ff . Aristotle recognizes three types of ἐρωδιός, generally identifi ed as the Common Heron, the Egret and the Bittern (HA 8 [9] 1, 609b20; 18, 616b33–617a8), but none of them characteristically calls at night. In view of the notorious imprecision of ancient species-names, the bird most probably intended in the Homeric passage is either the Bittern or the Little Bittern; but both the Squacco Heron and the Night Heron characteristically call at dusk. Th e range of all four (today) covers northern Greece and the Bosporus. According to Eustathius, the omen was favourable because the erodios skulks in swamps and hunts by night, just as Diomedes and Odysseus were doing (ad Iliad. p. 804 l. 57); cf. H. Gossen, s.v.

DiamondTh is was regarded in antiquity as the hardest and most precious of all stones, “the stone of necessity” (ἀναγκῖτις), indomita vis.20 According to Th eophrastus, the term ἀδάμας meant any kind of hard stone.21Th e pairing with ὁ γλαῦκος suggests to me that what was meant was a blue variety of diamond, which Pliny describes as an “almost sky-coloured stone” (vergens ad aerium colorem) found in Cyprus.22 Regardless of the fi nal observation (“Th e best one is the type that looks like iron”), I believe that the colour is what caused it to be included in the Nautical Lapidary.23 Less plausibly, it may be identical to the lapis 18 Demargne 1984 notes three examples of Athena standing, or half-sitting, and holding a bird: the “Elgin Athena” in the Metropolitan Museum (460–450 BCE), cf. Demargne 1984, 976 no. 205; and nos. 203 (Marion, Cyprus) and 204ª (stater from Side). Athena Promachos appears as a fi gurehead on the prow of a vessel, on a series of coins (silver and bronze) from Arados in Phoenicia, beginning in mid-IIIª (BMC Phoenicia nos. 86–95, cf. Demargne 1984, 1013 no. 615 (also from Phaselis in Cyprus); later examples show a much larger Poseidon sitting amidships (BMC Phoenicia no. 300, from 134 BCE). On Athena and navigation, see also Detienne 1974, 233–41 (unaware of this imagery).19 Th e Bittern is typically a large bird (30\" = 75cm); the Little Bittern and the Squacco Heron by contrast are relatively small (14\" = 35cm, 18\" = 40cm resp.).20 Damigeron-Evax 3.4; Pliny, HN 36.57; see further the entire section 36.55–64, based on Xenocrates of Ephesus; it is frequently mentioned elsewhere by Pliny, e.g. HN 33.12, 92, 130, 142, 166, 188, 196–99, 222, 238 etc. Barb 1969 remains the most valuable discussion.21 Th eophrastus, de lapid. 19 with Halleux and Schamp p. 334 n. 3.22 Pliny, HN 37.58, reading aerium for ms. aereum, cf. 37.77 on aeroides; and 115 on the aerizusa, i.e. aeri similem, which Eichholz takes to mean a sky-blue stone, sapphirine calchedony. Th e same colour is referred to by Epiphanius of Salamis, De gemmis 2.1f. Th e variety from Macedonia, to which the Nautical Lapidary expressly refers, is also mentioned by Pliny, HN 37.57; and by Damigeron-Evax 3.2. An alterna-tive identifi cation is the corundum.23 Halleux and Schamp 1985, 334 n. 8 rightly refer to the “confusion” and ignorance of the author of the Nautical Lapidary in this connection, because in fact, the richest in iron, siderite, is considered by Pliny to be of little value (HN 37.58).

BerylTh is is a very hard silicate (7–8) which was used in antiquity for inta-glios. Th e name designates a type of precious stone in general “which has the green colour of the sea”. It is hardly surprising that two vari-eties of beryl are the emerald and the aquamarine, darker in colour (θαλασσόχρους, greeny-blue) but equally translucent.26Th is is the only entry in the Nautical Lapidary to indicate the image to be engraved on the stone: “Engrave on it Poseidon in a chariot with two horses”, presumably two hippocamps. At Rome, this iconography is fi rst found on a rare denarius of Q. Crepereius M.f. Rocus in 72 BCE, whose obverse shows the head of Amphitrite (?), and the reverse Poseidon driving a biga on the sea, drawn by two hippocamps (Plate 24).27 It was then picked up on gems in the imperial period, notably by Octavian in celebration of the victory at Actium, or against Sextus Pompey (Plate 25),28 where the association is highlighted by the inclu-24 Damigeron-Evax 62.2.25 Pliny, HN 37.61.

Amphitrite can also be engraved (standing) in the chariot. When conse-crated, it gives to anyone who carries it success in love and provides him with a good deal of wealth.

According to Pliny, HN 37.107, the topaz is appreciated precisely for its green colour (e virenti genere, conj. Mayhoff ; suo virenti d, h; also Eichholz); later (109) he likens the colour to that of the leek. He also relates a story taken from Juba’s work on ‘Arabia’ (cf. F. Jacoby, s.v. Juba II, RE 9 (1916) 2384–95 at 91f.) about the name topazos: it is supposedly the name of an island in the Red Sea far away from land, and oft en fog-bound, so the sailors had to ‘search for’ it, the word topazin mean-ing ‘to hunt for’ in the indigenous (Troglodytic) language (108).31 Some of the other magical properties of the topaz also connect it with water: “It helps those who suff er with their eyes, to the extent of curing ophthalmias. Th ere is nothing more eff ective for this. It is a very powerful amulet and extremely eff ec-tive in water-divining (hydromancy). If anyone drinks wine made from the sea-grape (σταφυλῆς θαλασσίας οἶνον) and goes mad, grind topaz on the whetstone and give it to the demented person to drink in water” (Kerygm. 8.12–16). Halleux and Schamp understand this as wine to which sea-water had been added (cf. ὁ τεθαλασσωμένος οἶνος ap. Dioscorides, Mat. med. 5.6.3, 3: 6.10–13 Wellmann).32 Inv. 6971.

CoralCoral is one of the most intensively elaborated stones in the ancient lapidary tradition.37 Interest in it was aroused primarily by its transition from its original state as a living creature to becoming a hard skeleton, eff ectively a ‘stone’ (one of its names was λιθόδενδρον), but also by its blood-red colour.38 Th e idea of ‘turning to stone’ of course suggested an appropriate linkage to myth. Th e Orphic Lapidary 540–71 sum-marises the legend of Perseus and the Gorgon to explain the mythical origins of the properties of coral: having decapitated the monster, Per-seus washed out the impurities from its blood in the sea, thus causing the surrounding under-water vegetation to take on the texture of “a hard stone” (στερεὴ λίθος, 569), while retaining much of its vegetal form (πάμπαν βοτάνης οὐκ ὤλεσεν εἶδος, 571).39 To perpetuate the hero’s glory, Athena gave the coral stone unlimited virtue:34 Th e gem is currently mounted in a gold chain with eight gems engraved with dif-ferent mythological images (Ricomá i Vallhonrat 1982, fi g. 14). Th e the fact that they are not of uniform size suggests that the goldsmith who made the necklace re-used stones from other jewels.35 It can hardly be the same as Pliny’s druitis, which is said to resemble the bark of an oak-tree (HN 37.188). One might however assume a corruption of Pliny’s drosol-ithos, ‘Jupiter’s gem’, which is said to be white and soft (HN 37.170).36 Aristoph., Aves 304 with van Leuven’s note ad loc.

If thetextual tradition is to be relied on, one might imagine a ‘lithic’ formation fromthe expression ἐκ δρυόχων, ‘from the keel up’. Halleux and Schamp however think it must be a sort of onyx (1985, 335 n. 10).37 Cf. Rossbach 1912, 1100; Lagercrantz et al. 1922; Wellmann 1935, 119f. no. 22.38 Cf.

Th is plant, when it is uprooted, drift s in the depths of the sea until the waves drive it to the shore. In contact with the air, it dries and hardens.

Orph. 578–584.Th ere follows a long list of the magical properties of coral, unrelated to the sea (594–604, cf. Kerygm. 20.11; 14; 26).In much the same vein, Pliny picks up Metrodorus of Scepsis’ name for coral, gorgonia or ‘Gorgon’s Stone’. Th is stone, he says, “is merely coral: it is called [gorgonia] because it goes hard aft er soft ening in the sea; it is supposed to counteract lightning and typhoons” (HN 37.164; cf. Kerygm. 20.13).42 Th ough more detailed, Isidore’s account is based on the same material: Coral is formed in the sea. It has branches and is green, but quickly goes red. Under water, its berries are soft , but when removed from the water they rapidly harden and turn red, and immediately become hard to the touch like stone (tactuque protinus lapidescunt). It is usually gathered and bark, and it looks like a hawthorn or even like a little stone tree, which gives the onlooker no little pleasure to see”.40 Cf. also Damigeron-Evax 7.3: In nave hoc si habueris multum effi cacior eris. Resis-tit autem ventis et tempestatibus et turbinibus.41 By contrast to Poseidon, Nereus, “the old man of the Sea”, has a generally posi-tive image in mythology (e.g. Hesiod, Th eog. 233–36 with West ad loc.; cf. G. Herzog-Hauser, s.v. Nereus, RE 17 (1936) 24–28), and in Latin poetry is frequently a metonym for the Ocean or the sea (e.g. Paneg. Messal. [Tibull. 4.1] 58; Ovid, Met. 1.187, 12.94 etc.). Th is must be the meaning here, but the allusion is apt since Nereus was usually considered to be a benevolent god for sailors, oft en shown with his family, the Nereids (Grimal, 1969 s.v. Nereus). 42 Pliny in Books 36–37 oft en refers disparagingly to the Magi either explicitly, or, as here, tacitly (adfi rmant). His targets are the generic texts sometimes cited under the pseudonyms Zoroaster, Ostanes, perhaps Zachalias, or named Greek authors, Sudines, Sotacus, Xenophanes of Ephesus, Demostratus, Ismenias, Zenothemis, etc. cf. Wellmann 1935, 135–49; Hopfner 1926, 747–50; Ernout, 1964, 190–95. It is now understood that the term ‘Magi’ is to some extent justifi ed in that this material con-sisted in part of translations or adaptations of Babylonian lists of powerful stones, the Babylonian ‘stone-books’: Reiner 1995, 119–32; Dickie 2001, 172–77. Pliny, in this fi nal section of his work, aspires to be the Latin Th eophrastus, but that does not stop him from relating amazing anecdotes from Greek literary tradition. In connection with the sea, he notes the ring of Polycrates of Samos (HN 33.27; 37.3; also recounted in Strabo 14.1.16, 638C; Solinus 33.18; Val. Max. 6. 9 ext.5: cui Neptunus anulum piscatoris manu restituerat . . .), and the Cypriot story about the marble statue of a lion with emeralds for eyes that stood above the tomb of Hermias in a fi shermen’s quarter: the gems fl ashed their light into the sea “with such force that the tunnies were fright-ened away and fl ed” (HN 37.66)."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"468 sabino perea yébenesand extracted with nets, or else by cutting it with an iron tool, and for this reason is given the name of corallius (coral). Th e people of India have the same esteem for coral as we do for the precious pearls from India. Th e Magi claim, if they can be believed, that coral wards off light-ning (hunc magi fulminibus resistere adfi rmant, si creditur).Etym. 16.8.1.He later adds, evidently referring again to the Magi: “Coral, they claim, can ward off storms and hail” (16.15.25).Th e most elaborate account of coral’s relation to the sea is however to be found in the Kerygmata:When consecrated, it off ers maximum protection against every fear, against ambushes by bandits, and above all on journeys against attacks by robbers and every type of snakebite . . . He who carries it shall never. . . be struck down by a fl ash of lightning, a meteorite or an evil spirit (πονηροῦ δαίμονος) . . . It is also very benefi cial for those who sail. If the stone is hidden in the boat and is placed on top of the mast, wrapped in sealskin, it is excellent protection that will ward off all danger and ship-wreck, as it has the eff ect of driving away winds, waves and hardships of all types. Furthermore, crushed and mixed with seeds, it is planted and frees the land from ruin and all disastrous storms. It is said to have the power not only to ward off drought, hail or other elements of this type, but . . . even whirlwinds and lightning.Kerygm. 20.14; 17; 23–6.Th e prescription of the Nautical Lapidary, to bind a piece of “coral, together with a seal skin, at the top of the mast, [to] protect one from the winds, waves and every type of turbulence in all waters” is thus quite conventional.43Kerygm. 20.16f. recommends engraving the ‘animal of Hekate’ or a Medusa-head on coral as a θυμοκάτοχον.44 Quite apart from the mythic 43 Cf. Wachsmuth 1967, 442. On the magical value of seal(skin) see H. Gossens, s.v. Robbe, RE 1A (1914) 945–9 at 948f., cf. M.

Th e ‘Snake-belly Stone’ or SerpentineTh is rock is a green silicate, fairly soft (3–4), with streaks caused by mass scaly, fi brous aggregates that look like the underside of a snake (antigorite). In antiquity it was to be found in abundance in the east-ern desert in Egypt, where it was used from very early times in royal tombs46 and for small ornaments and/or amulets. It was also used in connection with cures for snake-bite.47 In the Roman world, the stone was classed as a type of marble known as ophites, cum sit illud serpen-tium maculis simile, “since its markings resembles snakes” (Pliny, HN 36.55). However, none of the therapeutic values of ophites are explic-itly related to navigation and the sea: it was again mainly used against snake-bite. Th e Nautical Lapidary perhaps prescribes it as a marine amulet on account of the wave-like whorls—according to Pliny, the markings of a related type of ‘marble’, the ‘Augustan’, are undatim, wave-like.1.7. Obsian (Obsidian)Th is is an amorphous volcanic rock, considered in antiquity as sort of inferior glass (it was indeed used for hanging mirrors), since it is sometimes translucent.48 Pliny says it is very dark in colour (nigerrimi coloris), whereas Isidore, agreeing here with the Nautical Lapidary, says that “it is sometimes green and sometimes black” (virens interdum et niger aliquando). A possible connection with the sea is suggested by the use of obsidian to obtain fore-knowledge (ὄψομαι, ὄψις).49Of the seven stones listed by the Nautical Lapidary, only two (anthrax/calchedony and coral) or three (if we count the topaz as a beryl) are 45 See e.g. the list in Michel 2004, 268 s.v. 18.1.b.46 In the galleries of the step pyramid tomb of King Djoser (3rd Dynasty) in Saqqara were found thousands of beakers carved from hard and semi-precious stone, includ-ing serpentine.47 On serpentine in Egypt, see Wilkinson 1992/2003, 98–100.48 Pliny, HN 36.196–98; 37.177; Isidore, Etym. 16.16.5.49 Orphic Lapid. 288–90; Kerygm. 9.1."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"470 sabino perea yébeneselsewhere attested as possessing eff ective powers against dangers at sea.

More-over, the oddity of the selection is underlined by the fact that there is scattered evidence for seven other types of stone in the same context that the Lapidary does not mention.2. Stones and Amulets for Navigation not mentioned in theNautical Lapidary2.1. Agate (ἀχάτης)In the magical tradition, according to Pliny, fumigations of burnt agates were used to ward off storms and waterspouts and halt the fl ow of rivers (in Persis vero suffi tu earum tempestates averti et presteras, fl umina sisti). To be eff ective, they had to be bound like amulets with lions’ manes (sed, ut prosint, leoninis iubis adalligandas).50 A πρηστήρ is a waterspout accompanied by lightning, oft en mentioned by ancient meteorologists.51 Damigeron-Evax simply ascribes this stone a general power of protection (in tutamentum erit).522.2.

Et naufragio facto enatabit Neptunum et Nereum deos maris contempnens, “In the case of shipwreck, (the bearer) will be enabled to save himself by swimming, spiting Neptune and Nereus, the gods of the sea” (Damigeron-Evax 4.10f.).2.4. Lapis ceraunius or cerauniaTh is stone does not correspond to any single modern variety of stone. Pliny mentions one variety from Carmania (Eastern Persia) that was bright and colourless but with a blue sheen (HN 37.134, cf. 132). Sotacus apparently registered two other forms, one black, the other red, which “resemble axe-heads”, similes eas esse securibus, and have diff erent magical properties (135).57 Th e ‘Magi’ counted a further vari-ety of ceraunia, quite rare, only found where lightning had struck: quoniam non aliubi inveniatur quam in loco fulmine icto (ibid.).58 For its part, Damigeron-Evax equates the ceraunius with the stone called in Egypt ‘emerald’ (smaragdus) and, ignoring the other varieties, avers 55 Th e stone is distinguished from the beryl, dealt with in §61.56 Pliny, HN 37.173, calls it memnonia, and says bluntly qualis sit, non traditur. Himerius ap. Photius, Bibl. 373a (vol. 6, p. 113f. Henry), assumed that, like the statue of Memnon, it would emit human-like sounds and even speak when exposed to the sun(-rise) (ὁμιλήσας ἡλίῳ); cf. Halleux and Schamp 1985, 239 n. 3.57 A good example is the incident when twelve (fl int) axes appeared aft er a lake in Cantabria was struck by lightning, which was taken as an impressive divine sign in favour of Galba’s bid for the throne in 68 CE (Suetonius, Galba 8.2).

Moreover, “if taken on a sea journey, the bearer will avoid the risk of being aff ected by lightning or a whirlwind”.61 It seems clear that this power to ward off lightning at sea derives from the Magian claim and has little or nothing to do with colour.2.5. Emerald (lapis smaragdus)Since neither Pliny nor the Cyranides provide any information about the medicinal and other value of the emerald, there is no corrobora-tion for the claim by Damigeron-Evax that it wards off storms, liberat a tempestatibus (6.3). But here colour must have been decisive.2.6. Chelonite (χελωνίτης, lapis chelonites)Damigeron-Evax describes chelonite as resembling the sea-turtle; it calms rainstorms, hailstorms and tempests. “If it is placed in rainwater or seawater and then into the fi re, calm will come immediately”.62 Th e name of the stone is of course derived from the Greek word for a tor-toise/turtle, χελώνη.63 Pliny confi rms that the magical tradition, which mainly valued the stone for its prophetic powers, also recommended it for vaticinationes, perhaps here incantations, ad tempestates sedandas; but adds that one particular variety, speckled with golden speckles, 59 Invenitur . . . in illis locis ubi fulminis ictus (12.1).60 Damigeron-Evax actually off ers a quasi-meteorological explanation for its cre-ation: Narratur tamen ex contritione nubium inter se fi eri, “it is said to be produced by friction between the clouds” (12.2).61 Praeterea si habuerit eum aliquis navigans, non periclitabitur per fulmen aut per turbinem (12.5).62 Chelonites lapis fortis est et gravis, similis testudinis marinae . . .

Isidore, Etym. 16.15.23. 63 Pliny, HN 37.155, claims that the stone is in fact the eye of the Indian (land-)tortoise, while allowing there are other varieties. Like modern German (Schildkröte), French (tortue), Spanish (tortuga) and Italian (tartaruga), however, Greek did not ordinarily distinguish between tortoise and turtle, though specialists like Aristotle, PA 540a29, HA 590b4, when they needed to make the distinction, would add θαλαττία."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":" magic at sea 473might be used in the inverse manner, to raise storms, tempestates com-movere, if dropped into boiling water with a scarab-beetle (37.155).642.7.

Th e sole lapidary to link it with the sea is Damigeron-Evax 2.1–6, which mentions a variety from Cyprus, Ethiopia and Lybia, emerald-green in colour, with red veins: When dropped into a silver vessel full of water and placed in the sun, it causes it to change and become blood-coloured and cloudy. Once it has been consecrated, you will witness its divine power: for the bowl imme-diately causes the water to bubble, and the air to become disturbed by thunder and lightning, rain and storms (turbidus et aer cum tronitruis et fulgoribus et pluviis et procellis); even the ignorant are amazed and terrifi ed by its power.65Part of this account is taken from Pliny, or rather a common source; the remainder of Pliny’s entry is quite diff erent, concentrating upon the stone’s value in tracking solar eclipses, and denouncing the ‘Magian’ tradition for suggesting it can make people invisible.66 In this connec-tion, Damigeron-Evax says only that “they”, presumably the ‘Magi’, use it for prophecy (vaticinantur), and praenuntiant futura per fl uvios perennes (2.8). In the absence of parallels, it is quite uncertain what Damigeron-Evax intended by this expression.673. Th e Relation between the Lapidaries and surviving Amuletic GemsIn the fi eld of Classical Archaeology, there is a sub-fi eld known as ‘magical amulets’, constructed essentially by the American gemmol-ogist Campbell Bonner in his Studies in Magical Amulets (SMA) in 64 Wellmann showed (1935, 134f.) that Pliny and Damigeron-Evax were probably using the same source here, each to his own purpose.65 Th e provenances and description of the eff ect of sunlight on the stone in water are taken from Pliny, HN 37.165 or a common source.66 Pliny, ibid.; Isidore, Etym. 16.7.12.67 Halleux and Schamp 1985, 237 n. 3, think that this is a reference to PGrMag XIII 772, referring to Ocean; but they must have been consulting the fi rst ed. of PGrMag, because the second reads at this point τὸ ἀένναον κωμαστήριον. One might think of a mechanical contrivance such as the zodiacal anaphorika described by Vitruvius, Arch. 9.8.8; Ctesibius’ water-clock used semi-precious stones bored through for the outlet (9.8.4)."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"474 sabino perea yébenes1950.68 Th is specialism focuses primarily on amulets, mainly for per-sonal protection and well-being, which carry Egyptian or Graeco-Egyptian motifs, though it also includes some other types, such as the ‘Seals of Solomon’.69 Árpád M. Nagy has recently challenged the assumption that Bonner’s category, which has now established itself in the production of museum catalogues in this area, does indeed cover the totality of gems engraved in antiquity for magical purposes, in par-ticular healing (Nagy 2009). Part of his reasoning relates to the lack of correspondence between the Graeco-Roman Lapidaries and Bonner’s category, which seem to occupy completely separate realms. He calls attention to the fact that the Lapidaries almost invariably prescribe images of perfectly familiar Graeco-Roman gods for amuletic (healing) purposes. Conversely, this implies that some, perhaps many, ‘ordinary’ gems bearing images of such gods may in fact have been sold as amu-lets for more or less specifi c purposes, and have been considered as such by their owners. We may use the theme of maritime amulets to follow up Nagy’s point. Th e Lapidaries prescribes three images in all to be engraved on such amulets, those of Poseidon/Neptune, Amphitrite and a Medusa-head. Poseidon/Neptune is prescribed three times in the Lapidaries for danger-free navigation.70 Given his realm, this choice is in a sense self-explanatory, the god’s ambivalent connotations notwithstanding.71 Amphitrite, daughter of Nereus and the Oceanid Doris, and paredros of Poseidon, is recommended as a complement to the latter in Ker-ygm. 8 (see p. 465 above). In the Principate, sarcophagi make much use of Tritons and Nereids to express the idea of joy, relaxation and 68 A. Delatte, Études sur la magie grecque, 3 et 4, Musée Belge 18 (1914) 5–20, 21–96 showed that the hitherto usual term ‘gnostic’ was inappropriate, but did not himself use the term ‘amulettes magiques’. 69 For a recent overview, see Michel 2004.70 Socr. et Dion. 27.1 (trident and dolphin); Lap. nautic. 3 (in biga); Kerygm. 8.9 (ἐν ἅρματι ἱππικῷ, reins in r.h., ear of grain in l.h.). Admittedly, the role of copy-ing in this tradition means that no particular conclusion can be drawn from thispredominance.71 See E. Wüst, s.v. Poseidon, RE 22 (1954) 446–557; F.

Although there is a mythological connection between Medusa and Poseidon, since she was raped by him, and produced the giant Chrysaor and the winged horse, Pegasus,73 this connection is evidently not the basis of the instruction in Kerygm. 20.16 to use a Medusa-head on a coral-amulet against wrath (see p. 468 above). Th e marine powers invoked as images by the Lapidaries thus reduce to two, Poseidon and Amphitrite.A fair number of engraved gems depicting Poseidon with his attri-butes has survived, though only one type exactly coincides with the instructions to be found in the Lapidaries.74 Th is is the motif of stand-ing Poseidon holding trident and dolphin, which established itself from the Hellenistic period.75 Th e J. Paul Getty Museum possesses a fi ne Ip example of this type on a carnelian set in a silver ring, with Poseidon resting his foot on a small rock (Plate 26).76 Th e immediate inspiration for gem-cutters here may have been late-Republican, and more especially Hadrianic coins.77 Th en again, Poseidon’s ‘sea-chariot’ is usually represented on gems as a hippocamp on which the god rides or sits: the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna has a particularly 72 P.

Philippson attempted to defend the ‘equine’ aspect of Poseidon by establishing a functional link between Poseidon Hippios and the Gorgon-Pegasus: Th essalische Mythologie (Zurich 1944) 25–36. 74 In view of the excellent collection of material by Erika Simon in LIMC, to which I refer the reader, I need only take a few illustrative cases.75 Cf. e.g. a stater from Tenos, III-IIª: BMC Crete & Aegean 128 no. 7, pl. 28.16 = Simon 1994, 455 no. 74.

Th e Lapidary image thus acts in eff ect as a historiola, the citation of an appropriate (and appropriately vague) precedent or model.We may also invoke a range of indirect iconographic allusions to sea-journeys. When the trident appears by itself on gems (ring-stones), it is presumably a synecdoche for Poseidon. Th e Capricorn is also rel-evant in this connection. Two gems in Th e Hague carry images of boats with large Capricorns.84 Th e motif must ultimately derive from 78 Simon & Bauchhenß 198, 488 no. 63 (inv. no. IX B 304). Again, the main glyp-tic model was coin-images, e.g. a gold drachma from 211–09 BCE (ibid. 725, no. 6) closely connected to a glass-paste gem now at Debrecen, Hungary (ibid. 6a).79 Th ere are numerous representations in Roman art of the marriage ‘celebration’ of Amphitrite and Poseidon, cf.

More immediately relevant, a carnelian in the Metropolitan Museum shows the capricorn simply with a trident;86 another at Hanover shows the beast upon a globe, with a trident half-hidden behind (Plate 29); both allude to Octavian’s crushing victory at Actium and the sole rule that it made possible.87 By implication, such maritime capricorns may have been intended to ensure safe journeys. In other cases, the goat’s head becomes a horse’s head, thus increasing the resemblance to a hippo-camp, as on a triple-hued sardonyx in the Archaeological Museum in Sofi a.88 Th is iconographical development can in turn be related to the image of a Triton, again at Sofi a, escorted by a dolphin.89 All of these examples can properly be regarded as amuletic, Augustan models being taken up and re-used, perhaps considerably later, for private purposes. Th e immediate conclusion must be that many of the ring-stones (and not merely those with maritime motifs) that are usually considered purely ornamental actually served as amulets. Another implication is that the marine images prescribed by the Lapidaries represent just a small, and in many ways deviant, sub-set of the surviving amuletic evidence connected with sea-journeys.On the other hand, I would say it is unclear whether fi nger rings with the bare image of a sailing ship, or an anchor, or even a hip-pocamp, are amulets intended to ensure a safe journey, rather than familiar motifs that simply appealed to their wearers (who might, for 85 A fi ne example of Capricorn as an astrological symbol: Richter 1956, 90 no. 403.

Th ese are the Roman anchor stocks found in 1905 off the coast of Cabo de Palos (Costa Calida, prov.

Zeus Kasios is the later (Greek) name of the Ugaritic Baal who presided over Mt. Zaphon at the mouth of the Orontes, over against Seleucia in Pieria, which home-coming sailors used to sight far off on the horizon.94 Th e other divinity, Aphrodite, must be some sort of female counterpart, perhaps, as some have suggested, infl uenced by the semitic goddess Athirat(u) or (Hebr.)

Creating and Using Amuletic Stones Perhaps the most important contribution of the Nautical Lapidary is the insight it provides into the tacit rules informing the practice of preparing amulets, rules which taken together constitute the implicit rationality of the praxis. In the fi rst place, we can discern a hierarchy of ‘lithic authority’. Th e most powerful stone in maritime contexts is coral, a stone that ‘grows’ organically in the sea, a sort of petrifi ed marvel. When its power is reinforced, or rather directed, by the seal-skin, famous for its power to avert lightning, it requires no additional assistance from myth and is simply attached to the ship’s mast. Less inherently powerful are amulets of semi-precious stones. Th ese cannot be chosen at random, but need to have a natural or intrinsic metonymic link to some feature of the maritime world as represented (i.e. unpredictable and dangerous). Th e privileged metonymic link at this lower level is clearly colour. Th e choices of the Nautical Lapidary turn out to be of three types:– transparent (colour of water)– green or blue (colour of the sea)– vivid red (colour of fi re/lightning).Colour however is merely a beginning. Once selected, the stone had to undergo a process of ritual consecration, which was closely connected with the process of engraving.96Th e ‘theory’ of consecration, i.e. its imputed aim, clearly varied. Some texts seem to assume that the aim is to get a superior god to con-fer virtue on the stone and thus underwrite its power; others seek to confer a divine status upon the stone e.g. by off ering it food, a gesture only meaningful on the assumption that the gem is rendered divine by the consecration; others appear to seek to ‘animate’ it through incan-tation.97 All such claims amount to explanations for the traditionally-accepted power of stones. Other texts, however, such as Cyranides Bk I,talischen Religionen Hispaniens in vorrömischer und römischer Zeit, ANRW II.18.1 (1986) 345–408 (erroneous note on the Cabo de Palos anchors on p. 406).96 Th e precise order in which these two operations were performed is admittedly unknown, and was no doubt arbitrary or at least under-determined.97 Th e basic discussion is still S. Eitrem, Die magischen Gemmen und ihre Weihe, SymbOslo 19 (1939) 57–85; see also Hopfner 1926, 759f., 761–63. W.

Th e Orphic Lapidary, by contrast, off ers all too many tacit theories, no doubt distantly based on theurgic (telestic) practice:For thirteen days, so I believe, Helenus refused to lie with women or take a bath in public, and remained untainted by meat.

In the purifi ed megaron, lit by torches, he caressed the divine stone, like a mother holding her baby in her arms.98Lithika 366–75.At least in the Lapidaries, the relation between the purpose of the amu-let and choice of a particular divine image is straightforward enough. Th e tacit rule is to select an image linked to the relevant mythical literature. Th ere were numerous possibilities here. In order to ensure a safe sea voyage and avoid danger, for example, one might select any of a range of types of Poseidon or Amphitrite, whose relevance to the end desired was massively guaranteed by the wider culture. At the other extreme, one could select a relatively obscure reference, such as the image of Athena causing an erodios to call, in order to signal to Diomedes and Odysseus that they would be successful on their night-raid, or the link, made famous by Metrodorus, between coral and the Gorgon’s blood. Such choices imply something about the horizon of expectation of the compilers of these texts—obscurity correlates with authority.Virtually nothing is known about the pragmatics of Graeco-Roman amulets. Th e magical papyri assume a reader familiar with a small number of stones and the ritual of consecration; and that the prac-titioner has direct access to an engraver capable of carrying out his instructions. Th e designs of Graeco-Egyptian amuletic gems, though in detail diff erent from those of the PGrMag, likewise imply the exis-tence in Roman Egypt of knowledgeable specialists and competent workshops. As for other amuletic traditions, it is clear from Pliny the Elder that a considerable specialist literature on the more or less mar-98 Th e passage is a description of the ritual preparation of siderites in order to ‘ani-mate’ it, i.e. endow it with divine power.

Judging from the archaeology, however, such books, closely related to the mirabilia-tradition, hardly provided prac-tical advice to the range of professions, δακτυλιογλύφοι, gemmarii, doctors, iatromathematici, diviners and other Graeco-Roman special-ists who made use of gems in their praxis. Th e Lapidary tradition has indeed almost no direct link with the producing workshops, the offi -cinae gemmariae. Rather, their role, as more or less prestigious writ-ten texts (e.g. ‘Orpheus’; κηρύγματα = Proclamations; ‘Damigeron’; the incipit of the Latin transl.: Evax Rex Arabiae Tiberio imperatori salutem) was to underwrite the claim that stones were, or might be, alongside plants and animal-parts, highly eff ective members of the wider class of materia magica.5. Th e Question of MagicAmong the amulets described here, coral is of particular interest for its undeniable marine origin. For the ancients, it was the amulet-stone for safe navigation par excellence. Its special status was grounded, fi rst, in its ‘nature’ as a sea-creature that turned to stone, and then in its connection with the petrifi cation-myth par excellence, that of Perseus and Medusa. Th is double claim served to make it what Aristotle would call a ‘dualiser’, and therefore a profi table node for further speculation, supplying answers to the questions that immediately arise from its ambivalent classifi cation: what is the larger signifi cance of the trans-formation of the coral from plant to stone?100 Is its red colour a sign 99 Diocles of Carystus seems to have incorporated some stone-lore in his Ῥιζοτομικόν, cited by Th eophrastus, de lapid. 28; cf. Rossbach 1912, 1103. 100 On dualisers in Aristotle’s biology, see G.E.R. Lloyd, Science, Folklore and Ideol-ogy: Studies in the Life-Sciences in Ancient Greece (Cambridge 1983) 44–53. As far as I know, there is no evidence for such interest in coral until Metrodorus of Scepsis in the second half of IIª, cf. W. Kroll, s.v. Metrodorus 23, RE 15 (1932) 1481f."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"482 sabino perea yébenesof some kind? What can be made of the fact that it grows in the sea? Such questions are of course at one level specifi c and individual to the case; but they acquire meaning as questions against the institutional background of the exploitation of the natural world for medico-magi-cal purposes (the Hippocratic search for eff ective herbal remedies is almost entirely a systematic and determined rationalisation of rhizo-tomic lore). Th ey cannot be dismissed one by one as ‘superstitions’; just as in the case of the project of divination, even if there is plenty of evidence for scepticism about individual claims, the system as a whole remained an essential component of the practice of iatromedicine. Indeed, in the work of pseudo-Democritus during the later Hellenistic period it acquired its own theory, adapted from Stoicism, namely the idea of natural sympathy (Dickie 1999).If possible, any ‘interesting’ item in the natural world would be located within the vast inter-locking scheme of Greek myth, pan-hellenic or purely local, and thus obtain a further set of associations (in the case of coral, with Medusa). Such key or ‘nodal’ items would then legitimate the search for analogous natural substances, motivated by metonymic indicators such as colour or typical provenance.101 Th ese in turn could be fi tted into the schemes devised for the representation of the divine world in art, yet another form of objectifi cation and authen-tifi cation. Th e act of engraving the stone underlined and focused the amuletic end envisaged by specifying the deities represented as θεοὶ ἐπηκόοι, di praestantissimi, as deities capable of eff ective intervention. Stones in this mode do not work physiologically or as substances (even though this aspect was important in their use in iatromedicine, usu-ally crushed or burned to powder); but nor does their eff ectiveness lie simply in the trust that is put in them. Th at is a typically modern explanation, one which simply substitutes a psychological claim for the old idea of ‘superstition’. But it is a mere tautology: sailors used amulets because they believed in them. Where does that get us?I have argued that the answer lies in the existence, behind and beyond either individual stones or amuletic stones as a category, of a series of interlocking institutionalised commitments to the positive role 101 It is hardly surprising that the Syrtes sapphire (lapis syrtius qui et sapphirus appellatur), a stone “found on the edge of Libya, near the Syrtes”, is of no use in ward-ing off storms at sea, because such stones had been “thrown out of the sea by storms” (expulsus a mari per tempestates) (Damigeron-Evax 22. 2). A beached stone cannot be prescribed as an amulet against shipwreck."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":" magic at sea 483of natural substances in human life, itself merely one aspect of a more general adherence to the view that the divine world is fundamentally well-disposed to humankind, and reveals that benefi cence through the bounty of nature. In purchasing an amulet, one bought into a specifi c sector of that series of assertions. Th e tacit assumption, as Augustus’ seal-skin undergarment indicates, was that such a purchase gave one a special claim either on the gods’ goodwill in refraining from creating adverse conditions (in our case, at sea) or on divine intervention in a dangerous situation. An equally viable alternative would have been to undertake a vow before a sea-voyage. Nevertheless, risks remained. No one who bought a specifi c amulet believed it would act absolutely, any more than in the case of a votive. Against that, eff ort invested, and the price paid, weighed positively in the balance. Th e seal-skin undergarment worked; Augustus was never struck by lightning—the investment in his case paid off . Individuals might consider going further up this road and consulting a diviner, a specialist in stones, a ‘magician’. However, to go beyond normal pre-cautions, whatever in a given area they might be, meant running the risk of exposing oneself to ridicule, even to the charge of ‘consulting a magus’. Th e very fact that Suetonius comments on Augustus’ seal-skin undergarment suggests some uneasiness. We have here then to do with what we might call ‘low-intensity’ or ‘soft ’ magic, where the part played by the specialist practitioner is minimal or non-existent, but where considerations of due measure, propriety and social status played an important role in personal and collective judgements.Th ere is however a quite diff erent sense in which the use of such amulets was magical, namely the frequency with which Pliny in this context cites the Magi, i.e. the Lithic tradition from Sotaces, and espe-cially the writers who, in the Hellenistic period, aft er the (partial) trans-lation of these texts, took material from the Babylonian abnu šikinšu (lit.: Th e nature of the stone is . . .) and its congeners (see n. 42). Coral is a case in point, for, according to Isidore, it was the Magi who claimed it warded off lightning, and storms and hail (p. 468). Pliny views the Magian texts as like Metrodorus: untrustworthy, liable to exaggera-tion and inclined to love of the marvellous for its own sake. Yet the Lapidary tradition (and indeed Pliny himself in this case) drops all mention of the Magi when dealing with coral: the substance moves into the zone of ‘accepted if marvellous facts’. Th is process of routini-sation or domestication of the marvellous seems characteristic of the Lapidaries as a whole.

Terracing-work for the construction of an entrance stair-way to the underground car-park in the Place des Épars in Chartres, where an excavation had been con-ducted about a year earlier, had revealed about three metres of occu-pational strata, including a thick burned layer (Text-fi g. 13).2 Caroline de Frutos and Frédéric Dupont, members of the technical section of the Archaeological Service of the municipality of Chartres, went to carry out a routine check and decided to make a section through it and remove one or two sherds from the layers thus exposed. During the following hour the fragments of pottery were washed, revealing that one of them bore a text in Latin and that others were fragments of unusual vessels decorated with moulded snakes, and whose handles carried fi nials in the shape of miniature bowls. Th ese fi nds at once recalled the fact that a sanctuary of Roman date had been uncovered in the course of the earlier excavations nearby, and were enough to cause us to return to the site at once and take a closer look at this destruction-level. A sounding immediately produced the complete incense-burner that is the main object of this study, and it was removed for conservation.On the same day, in accordance with the regulations, we informed the Ministry of Culture (DRAC Centre—Service régional de l’Archéologie) and the mayor of Chartres of this exceptionally important discovery.

Th e EnsembleA Group of Ritual Objects Stored in a domestic CellarTh e incense-burner (in fact there turned out to be fragments of three in all) was part of an entire set of ritual equipment that we managed successfully to recover from this small site. All the remains lay col-lected together in the tiny subterranean cache or cellar (1.70m × c. 2m) of a house that had collapsed aft er a fi re. Th e ensemble was preserved by the fallen débris (Plate 30). It could be inferred that at an ear-lier stage access to the cache had probably been by means of a small wooden ladder resting on a pair of masonry steps. Two of the cellar-walls were constructed of solid stone masonry that had been white-washed; the north wall consisted of a revetment of wooden planks nailed to beams (the wall to the south, together with part of the cellar, had been destroyed in the course of the terracing-work in July 2005). At some later point, the fl oor-level was raised, thus covering the lower of the two masonry steps. Th e fi re that destroyed the cellar occurred during this second phase, while more or less the entire fl oor-area was still in regular use.Th e incense-burners proved to form part of an assemblage of ritual equipment that included three snake-vases, a broad-bladed knife of the type typically used for sacrifi ces (culter) and two stamped factory-lamps (Plate 31).3 Th e remainder consists of more than a dozen ceramic items (jars, fl asks and bottles), broken fragments of glass vessels and a small assortment of carbonised animal-bones.4 Th e cellar also contained a wooden chest or box whose doors were fi tted with bone hinges and the corners reinforced with iron angles.Without totally ignoring the possibility of a relationship with the small shrine nearby, we think it more probable that the collection 3 Lamps are known to have been used in certain magical rituals, particularly for a certain type of divination, e.g. PGrMag VII 540–78.4 All this material is being studied and will be published shortly."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":" a prayer for blessings on three ritual objects 489Fig. 13.

Th e magical equipment had been carefully deposited under the stairway, discreetly hidden from view.5 It is pos-sible that the cellar served as a domestic shrine but the destruction of a large section of it by later building operations means that we are not in a position to take a decision one way or the other.Th ree probable incense-burnersAs already stated, the excavation produced three objects in terracotta, probably similar in overall appearance, and carrying the same inscribed text. Th eir small size (h: 0.23m) suggests that they were portable items that could easily be put away aft er use. Th e fi rst one to be found (object A) is almost perfectly preserved, although the fi re has altered some of the surface. Of the second (object B), we possess only a sizeable frag-ment of the upper rim, enough to show that it was closely similar to the complete example, though somewhat larger. Th e third (object C), just a small sherd with a fl ange between the upper rim and the cylin-drical body, seems to have been closely similar.Th e shape of object A raises the question of whether they were intended for ritual use. It has a circular base that supports a cylindri-cal shaft fl ared successively through two fl anges and surmounted by a relatively deep bowl (depth: 0.045m, diam. 0.14/0.147m) (Text-fi g. 14). So far as we know there are no precise parallels for such a design. Nevertheless the bowl and the overall shape strongly suggest that the object is to be identifi ed as a thymiaterion or turibulum, at any rate as a utensil for burning the incense or perfume that would have accom-panied the invocation of the omnipotentia numina.6 In domestic and votive contexts, incense-burners usually have the form of a small cup or bowl mounted on a cylindrical base.7 Our turibulum is more elabo-5 At his trial, Apuleius was accused of having hidden magical equipment (instru-menta magiae) in a cloth, and kept it in his lararium (Apol. 53f.).6 It may also have been used to sacrifi ce a small creature, such as a chicken; a sac-rifi cial knife did aft er all form part of the ensemble.7 Th ere are many simple votive examples from Archaic and Republican Italy, e.g. more than one hundred found at the sanctuary of Minerva at Lavinium, though their only resemblance to our object is the round base and the dish at the top: Th esCRA 1 (2004) 374 nos. 422–25 (I.

At any rate, it seems clear from the texts that Sedatus’ turibula were especially commissioned to enable him to perform the rites he envisaged. One possibility raised by the confi rmed existence of three such utensils in the ensemble is that they were intended to mark out a ritual space: the idea may have been to place them at each cardinal point, to evoke the numina and enable Sedatus to prevail upon them.

Th e same prayer (with the exception of the headings, each of which denotes a cardinal direction) has been written out four times down the exterior wall of the turibulum, from the top fl ange to the shaft , each block being separated from the next by a vertical line (Text fi g. 15). Th ere are however very slight diff erences between them. For example, in three cases omnipotentia occurs in full in l. 1, but in Oriens it is divided between ll. 1 and 2; in two cases numina is divided, in the others not; in three cases Sedatus’ praenomen is given, in one it is omitted. In three cases vester custos has been placed below the fl ange marking the division between bowl and shaft . It is possible that this last variant is not casual, but serves as a stress-marker.Th e lettering is in capitals with some tendency towards cursive, par-ticularly in the case of b, o and d. Th e letter-forms are similar to those of the fi rst-century Gallo-Roman graffi ti from Châteauneuf (dép. Savoie), La Graufesenque or l’Hospitalet-du-Larzac (both dép. Aveyron), and are consistent with the archaeological context of the ensemble, which we would date to late Ip-early IIp.8 fi ttili, in J.

Allmer), and is in fact more common in Nar-bonensis.10 Sedatus is well-attested as a cognomen in the three Gauls (e.g. CIL XIII 846; 2706 (?); 4609; 5551; 5988; 11587). It is thus sim-plest to suppose that C. Verius Sedatus came from Gallia Lugdunensis, no doubt from the area of Chartres itself, though we cannot exclude the possibility that he, or his family, had come from farther South. In view of the other magical documents found in Gaul, particularly the famous Gaulish text from L’Hospitalet-du-Larzac, which confi rm the presence there of magical specialists, there is nothing particularly 9 We might compare a funerary from Chartres that may off er a parallel case of a nomen calqued on a cognomen (Veranius ← Veranus: CIL XIII 3056, though the read-ing is problematic).

CIL VIII 17036). 10 CIL XII 127; 1597; 2699; 3291; 5690 no. 127; 709 (Veria), cf. OPEL s.v.

Commentary on the Prayer A Magical PrayerTh e burden of the prayer is simple enough. C. Verius Sedatus requests blessings from the omnipotent powers on the grounds that he is their guardian (quia ille est vester custos). Th ere appears to be no precise parallel for such a request. Any suggested context therefore involves an element of speculation, and we do not claim to have found a wholly satisfactory solution. C. Verius Sedatus, whoever he was, seems to have been a sort of religious bricoleur, drawing upon strands of diff erent tra-ditions to create his own personal ritual idiom. If we assume a degree of individual creativity or originality of this kind, we are unlikely to be able to assign either the prayer or the implied ritual defi nitively to a single context. Despite its brevity, three features of the prayer suggest some con-nection with the ritual-magical procedures known to us mainly from the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri. First, Sedatus must have con-sidered the unintelligible ‘words’ that follow vester custos to be the secret or powerful names of the omnipotentia numina, i.e. not their usual or ‘offi cial’ names, and that it was this knowledge that gave him special authority over them. Th ese are the basic assumptions of learned Graeco-Egyptian magic, but not those of the Italo-Roman folk or ‘traditional’ healing magic represented for us by, say, Cato’s remedy for dislocated joints (De agr. 140), where the unintelligible words are understood not as secret names but as markers of the special 11 For the L’Hospitalet-du-Larzac text, see n. 8 above. Th e most interesting Gallic defi xio (DTAud 111f. = ILS 8752 = ILAquit. Santones 104a, b), from the ager Santo-num (Charente Inférieure), is mentioned in n. 14 below. Because of its provenance, the simple gold charakter-phylactery found in a cremation tomb in the Limousin (Kotansky GMA, 44f. no. 10, I/IIp) is more important in the present context than the two IIp amulets against hail-storms, in Greek with identical wording and mise-en-page, from near Avignon, and the Vaucluse, which Kotansky GMA, 46–53 no. 11 rightly reckons were mass-produced in the area (see also Fernández Nieto’s discussion, p. 562 below). Th ough of course phylacteries are easily transportable, the poor quality of the Limousin example shows it was made far from any important centre of Graeco-Egyptian learned magic."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":" a prayer for blessings on three ritual objects 499nature of the ritual.12 Second, except in the learned antiquarian tradi-tion of the ‘secret name’ of Rome, itself almost certainly invented by Verrius Flaccus, secret names play no part in Roman public (or pri-vate) religion.13 Th e claim that one deserves to be listened to because one is the ‘guardian’ of such powers is however an explicit version of a thought normally implicit in the magical papyri—though it is docu-mented there—that knowledge of divine names must be kept secret and divulged to no one else. Th ird, the four cardinal directions, which seem to play a central part in Sedatus’ ritual practice, are invoked in Graeco-Egyptian prayers to the Agathos Daimon to provide, as here, concrete blessings. Th ere is therefore a thematic parallel in the magi-cal papyri. On the other hand, the Agathos-Daimon rituals are not only in Greek but represent relatively complex and elaborate examples of incanta-tion. Sedatus’ text by contrast is brief, indeed rudimentary. Moreover, the date of the prayer is very early for a text based, however remotely, on Graeco-Egyptian practice (see below). Only one of the malign magical texts (defi xiones) of this period from the north-western prov-inces, for example, shows any such infl uence and is probably several decades later.14 For this reason, before we look at the case for a Graeco-Egyptian context, it seems advisable to explore the obvious alternative possibility, a ritual performance within the context of Gallo-Roman religion.1512 Cf. R.L. Gordon, Th e Healing Event in Graeco-Roman Folk-Medicine, in Ph.J. van der Eijk et al. (eds.), Ancient Medicine in its Socio-Cultural Context (Amster-dam1995), 2: 363–376.13 Cf. J. Rüpke, Die Religion der Römer (Munich 2001) 134–6 (= pp. 132–34 of the ET).14 Th e well-known puppy-defi xiones from the ager Santonum (see n. 11 above), which are the only Gallic defi xiones to use nomina magica, are probably to be dated to the second half of IIp. However they do confi rm that some awareness of ritual magical forms was available in the far west of Gaul by that time, however it arrived there. As Faraone and Kropp point out elsewhere in this volume (p. 385), it also uses the twist-ing of the dead puppy’s body as an ostensive link between the literal and metaphoric uses of aversum. Th e ager Santonum was exposed to outside infl uences through the busy port of Burdigala and the important city of Mediolanum, cf. AA.VV., Villes et agglomérations antiques du Sud-Ouest de la Gaule: Deuxième colloque Aquitania, Bor-deaux 13–15 sept. 1990. Aquitania Suppl. 6 (Bordeaux 1992) 154–63.15 C.A. Faraone suggested to us that we should consider this possibility. Being com-mitted to a particular model of the dynamic relationship between Hellenistic Greek magic and Egyptian temple-magic (cf. Handbooks and Anthologies: Th e Collection of Greek and Egyptian Incantations in Late Hellenistic Egypt, Archiv für Religionsge-schichte 2 [2000] 195–213), he remains sceptical of any Graeco-Egyptian context."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"500 richard gordon, dominique joly & william van andringai. A ‘Druidic’ Ritual?16Apart from the fi nd-spot, Autricum, a site relatively far from direct Roman infl uence and with few inscriptions, the main reason for suspecting a Gallo-Roman background is the presence of the cardinal directions on at least two of the turibula (assuming that that is what they are), and presumably also on the very fragmentary third example. Two scenarios are possible. Th e fi rst is that only one turibulum was used for any given ritual, and that the less well-preserved ones repre-sent older or broken models that Sedatus chose to retain in the cellar, with the other cult vessels, rather than discard.17 Th e second possibil-ity, which we have already mentioned, is that there were originally four objects in the set, and that no trace has yet been found of the last. Th e cellar had aft er all been badly disturbed by the construction of street-drains long before the building of the underground car-park and the steps. On this account C. Verius Sedatus had four similar turibula made, which were intended to delimit a sacred or eff ective spot, at the centre of which he would have stood. Th e diff erent manner of listing the names, particularly between objects B and C, would then simply result from the carelessness so oft en found in ancient copying. Th ese diff erences suggest moreover that, though Sedatus provided the original text on a wax tablet or leaf-tablet (we may assume text A), the texts we have were written by someone in the workshop, for whom neither the order of the names nor the mise-en-page was important, and that Sedatus either did not notice this or had to accept the fait-accompli. Th ere is no fi rst-order evidence concerning the possible religious signifi cance of the cardinal directions from the Gallo-Roman period. Such evidence as survives is pre-Roman—or Irish. Given the sharp diff erences of opinion between those, such as C.-J. Guyonvarc’h and Françoise Le Roux, or Miranda Green, who claim that it is legitimate to use Irish material, despite its late date and its insular origin, to supplement archaeology, and those, most notably J.-L. Brunaux, who exclude such ‘evidence’ in favour of what can be deduced from the 16 F. Marco Simón independently made the same suggestion as Faraone. We are most grateful to him for bibliographical advice and other help in this section.17 For an analogous eff ort to keep old or broken sacred items, note the case of the late phase of the mithraeum at Bonn/Sechtem, where parts of disused statues were placed in receptacles in the podia: C.

For example, the late IVª ‘omphalos’ from Kermaria (Pont-l’Abbé, Pointe de Penmarch), now at St. Ger-main-en-Laye, which is decorated on all four faces, carries an X-shaped cross incised on the top, that might be interpreted in this sense.22 It is however diffi cult to see any regular application of such ideas in the orientation of excavated shrines of pre-Roman date; though square in plan, they do not seem to be carefully orientated towards the cardinal points.23 In relation to the site he excavated at Gournay-sur-Aronde 18 Guyonvarc’h and Le Roux 1986; M. Green, Th e World of the Druids (London and New York 1997) 124–37; Brunaux 2000, 17–21. Despite his affi rmation of prin-ciple, Brunaux himself is not above appealing to Irish materials when it suits him (e.g. p. 175).19 Guyonvarc’h and Le Roux 1986, 299. 20 Cicero, De div. 1.90 (Q. Cicero is made to say that he actually knew this man, from his period of service with Caesar). Artemidorus ap. Strabo 4.4.6, 199C like-wise makes no mention of orientation in relation to the crows of ‘Two-Crow island’. Despite Brunaux’ claim that the augural practices of the independant Gauls were “en eff et, tout à fait similaires” to Roman methods (p. 94), his discussion reveals that they were in fact completely dissimilar (pp. 163f.; 175f.). 21 Plutarch, Caes. 27.9, 721c: Guyonvarc’h and Le Roux 1986, 303. 22 M.-Y.

He claims that this was due to a preference for an ‘astronomical’ alignment, with the entrance to the shrine, and the axis of the hollow altar, facing the point at which the sun rose at the sum-mer solstice.24 If this were considered to be the ‘true’ or most authentic East, the remaining sides of the altar would also have been orientated, at least conceptually, towards the cardinal directions. Th ere is, how-ever, considerable doubt whether this was in fact the purpose of the re-orientation; nor does Brunaux appear to have done any research into the actual alignment of sunrise at the solstice at this latitude at the date in question. In other cases, however, such as the various phases of the massive ‘trophy’ site at Ribemont-sur-Ancre (Somme), it seems to have been the angles of the complex rather than the walls themselves that were oriented towards the cardinal directions.25 Th e fact that this orientation was preserved throughout the history of the site, includ-ing the Augustan, Flavian and even late-antique rebuilding aft er the destruction at the end of the third century, might suggest that, at least in southern Belgica, the principle remained conscious. On this argu-ment, Sedatus would have been attempting to reproduce in the design of his turibula an authentically Gaulish concern for cardinal align-ment: they were to form was to be a sort of miniaturised and portable four-square temple-site. However it must be stressed that this is quite speculative: Gallo-Roman temples for example do not seem to reveal any marked concern with orientation at all, let alone any attempt at exact alignment.26 Sedatus’ concern with alignment could just as easily have been inspired by Roman practice. Vitruvius in fact recommends that temples and the cult-statues in them should face West, if practi-cable, so that the sacrifi cants at the altar in front shall be able to face both East and the statue; the altar itself should face East.27 24 Brunaux 1995, 60–62; Brunaux 2000, 94.

Why not simply address the gods by name, as usual? Why list the secret names? Here we might perhaps appeal to the notion of invented tradition.28 Druid-ism may have been formally abolished in Gaul by Tiberius and again by Claudius, but its aura remained alive.29 Pliny’s account of the angui-num/urinum, famous among the Druids, refers to a case in the reign of Claudius, in which an eques Romanus of Vocontian origin (Gallia Narbonensis) was executed for keeping such a thing on his person during a law-suit, as a niketikon, an amulet to ensure success.30 Dur-ing the revolt of Civilis in 70 CE, ‘the Druids’ notoriously interpreted the burning of the Capitoline temple as a sign of the end of Roman power and its passing to the Gauls (Tacitus, Hist. 4.54). Th ey were also credited with knowledge of lore regarding the medicinal use of certain plants, and their use as amulets or phylacteries against harm (contra perniciem omnem).31 By the time of Pliny the Elder, aspects of this lore, albeit in fragmentary and heavily distorted form, had evidently come to be written down by Greek and Roman writers on medicine, and perhaps also by those, such as Nigidius Figulus, interested in physiolo-gia.32 For many Romans, such knowledge meant ‘magic’.

Th ere are several reasons for claiming this. For example, the names he gives to the four cardinal directions: oriens, occidens, meridie(s), septemtrio, are those that entered Latin in the late Repub-lic/early Principate under the infl uence of astronomy/astrology.34 Th ey are diff erent from the traditional Latin names given, for example, by Aulus Gellius as: exortus, occasus, meridies, septentriones, by Seneca as: ortus, occasus, meridies, septentrio.35 Sedatus’ names are in fact the ‘modern’ terms that were more or less standard in the Roman world by the fi rst quarter of IIp, and there is nothing remotely Gaulish, or even Gallo-Roman, about them. Th en again, rogo seems to have become popular in informal prayers under the infl uence of the language of secular petitions and testamen-tary dispositions.36 Epigraphically, the style is mainly attested in brief private prayers such as this,37 but also in prayers for justice and malign means a negligible showing. Gaulish plant names also occur in Celsus, ps-Apuleius and of course Marcellus Empiricus: Marco Simón 2002, 197–99.33 Webster 1999, 16f. distinguishes between two Roman traditions, one emphasis-ing the politico-religious power of the Druids, the other their ‘magic’.34 E.g. Vitruvius, Arch. 1.1.10: ex astrologia . . . cognoscitur oriens, occidens, meridies, septentrio; cf. Pliny, HN 4.19 (septentrio, occidens, meridies, oriens) and 5.102 (oriens, occidens, septentrio, meridies).

Livy 21.30.4; Caesar, Gall. 1.16f.; Pliny, HN 2.143; 17.19; 84f. In his intermediate system, Pliny uses oriens, meridies, occasus, septentriones (HN 2.119), but was clearly aware of the terms occidens and sep-tentrio (e.g. 4.102); at 3.3, however, he uses occasus solis for occidens, perhaps implying that Agrippa’s world-map did so too. Septentriones occurs fi rst in Plautus, Amph. 273; septentrio, like occidens, is fi rst found in the very late Republic, cf. Varro LL 7.7, with A. Le Boeuffl e, Les noms latins d’astres et de constellations (Paris 1977) 88.36 A wide variety of Latin prayer formulae is known: cf. G. Appel, De Romanorum precationibus, RGVV 7.2 (Gießen 1909). By the early Principate the commonest in offi cial or semi-offi cial contexts is precor et quaeso. Appel p. 66 lists only a handful of literary examples of rogo (Seneca, Agam. 511; De ben. 5.25.4; Martial 1.39.6; 8.8.3), but there are many others, e.g. Catullus 13.13; Livy 7.203.3; Seneca, QN 2.33.

Although it occurs only twice in one of the largest fi nds of the former, in the Sacred Spring at Aquae Sulis (Bath, Eng-land), there is plenty of evidence that it was a standard formula in the western provinces (especially in Hispania) for requests for the restora-tion of stolen objects now ceded to the divinity.38 Th e general form of the prayer is thus purely Roman. As for his attempt at creating secret ‘names’, although some concern for aural eff ect has gone into their creation (see below), they bear no resemblance to, say, the names of genuinely Gaulish divinities, nor do they betray the kind of familiarity with the phonetics of Gaulish that could be expected of one who could speak the language.39 Nevertheless, there are several reasons for thinking that Sedatus may have believed, or wanted to believe, that his invented praxis was a continuation, or revival, of Druidic practice. Th e fi rst is the magical word Dru in text A, Oriens l.9, col. ii etc. He may have believed that this was the Gaulish word for Druid, although it is certain that the word was actually druis.40 If so, he was surely working on the basis of the etymology, given by Pliny, from the Greek word for ‘oak’, δρῦς.41 Going on from there, it seems that he had made an eff ort to make his ‘names’ appear Gallo-exotic.

Sedatus surely did not understand his nomina ‘etymologically’. If he did not receive them as a list from someone else, the likeliest scenario in our view is that he ‘heard’ them in dreams. He could only trust their power if he had a personal means of guaranteeing their divine status. 40 See the etymological appendix of Guyonvarc’h and Le Roux 1986, 425–32; also Marco Simón 2007, 154 n. 9 (favouring dru-uides, linking Celtic *wid-, knowledge with the root vidu-, tree or wood).

We might think here either of (a selection of ) the stars and constellations that were normally used in parapegmata, such as Arcturus, Leo, Pegasus, the Pleiades, Orion and so on, as in the Calendar of the Quintilii,45 or, in view of Sedatus’ twelve names, of the zodiacal constellations (pos-sibly equated with the twelve gods).

Perhaps, indeed, it was common knowledge in Autricum that their territory lay ‘in the dead centre of Gaul’, and that their city could claim to be the centre of that centre.49 Is it then too far-fetched to think that Sedatus believed that the rituals he performed at his turibula took place literally at the centre of Gaul, and that his main motive in inscribing the four cardinal directions on each was to emphasise the authority and ritual power that such a location gave him? Concretely of course he may have borrowed his conceptual scheme from, say, the surveying procedures of the Roman agrimensores, which must in part have been common knowledge, since centuriation involved the erection of a cylindrical stone at the point 46 H.

Verius Sedatus’ text and the implied ritual praxis would represent merely the tip of an iceberg, one of perhaps numer-ous attempts in the Gallo-Roman context to draw on the authority of a submerged tradition in order to set oneself up as an ‘authentic’ religious specialist on the margins of the civic cults dominated by the interests of the local élite.51 Th is understanding of Druidism would have stood in direct contrast to the anti-Roman prophetism that fi g-ures in our sources, which has been compared to the religious revitali-sation movements, notably in North America, that have occurred in various cultures aft er conquest.52ii. An ultimate Source in the Tradition of learned Graeco-Egyptian Magic?An alternative hypothesis is the one that fi rst occurred to us, namely that Sedatus’ use of magical names, the claim to be their ‘guardian’, the evident appeal to secrecy and the deployment of the cardinal direc-tions in a ritual context imply some awareness of learned ritual magic. Now it must be admitted at the start that virtually nothing is known of the extent to which a learned syncretistic tradition of magic was available in the Mediterranean world during the fi rst two centuries 50 Cf. e.g. Hyginus, Constitutio [limitum] p. 131 T. = 166 L. = 134.15–19 Campbell; O.A.W.

Th e fact that the turibula were found in the least conspicuous part of the cellar implies an intention of keeping the nomina magica secret. It was surely the off er of special authority that made magic attrac-tive to Sedatus in the fi rst place. Th e importance of ‘guardianship’ for him is emphasised by the decision in three of the four cases in text A (which seems to have been the defi nitive version) to separate the two words vester custos from the rest of the text by placing them below the fl ange, thus demonstrating visually to the implied reader the closeness of the link between himself and the nomina. Th e twelve nomina magicaIn text A, the nomina magica (cf. Apuleius, Apol. 38.7f.) are divided into one list of nine items, where all but two items are monosyllabic; and a subjoined list of three items containing two ‘names’ of four syl-lables in the pattern a,b,a. Such a division must have made some sense to Sedatus, since he could easily have invented ten, or twelve, short ‘names’, but it makes little to the non-initiate.68 However it seems rea-sonable to respect his categorisation in the discussion. We therefore begin with the fi rst nine items.1) Th e List of Nine As we have pointed out, Sedatus’ identifi cation of his nomina magica as the secret or true names of the omnipotentia numina marks a clear distance from ‘traditional’ benefi cent magical usage. Such a claim is typical of Graeco-Egyptian practice. However, the overall impression given by Sedatus’ fi rst list of nine is that they bear very little resem-blance to the hundreds of nomina known from the Graeco-Egyptian 67 PGrMag IV 681–87 with Betz 2003, 179f.68 Th e obvious possibility is that 3 is a factor of both 9 and 12. It is true that the list in text 1 is divided 5 and 4, not into groups of 3; but there seems to be a simple stress-rhythm, assuming that Stna was in fact pronounced /stená/ : ̆ ́ ́ ́ ́ ́ ̆ ́ ( ̆) ́ ́ ́ ."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":" a prayer for blessings on three ritual objects 513tradition. Th ey are too short, too monotone, too uninventive.69 Seda-tus, or his instructor if one believes that he obtained the names from someone else, had only a very sketchy understanding of how ‘authentic’ nomina ought to sound.70 His names can thus be considered incompe-tent from the perspective of Graeco-Egyptian practice, exactly as one would expect of someone resident so very far from the centres of that tradition.71 Th e hint of Gaulish phonetic infl uence suggests that they are his own invention, albeit indirectly, through a legitimately ‘divine’ source, namely dreams.2) Th e List of Th reeTh e two quadrisyllabic names Halcemedme and Halcehelar are clearly of a diff erent order. Th e fi rst syllable reveals the intention of creating an impressive, outlandish name (/hal-/ occurs as the fi rst syllable in no Latin word except halo, halitus).72 Th e disyllables χαλχα- or χαλκου- occur in a small number of authentic Graeco-Egyptian ‘names’, the name μεεμε occurs as a ‘true name’ of Seth/Typhon, and there are a handful of such ‘names’ ending in -λαρ (e.g. ειλεσιλαρ).73 But the over-all impression is that, like the fi rst nine, they bear little resemblance to 69 At the Figura conference at Paris in June 2008, J.-D. Dubois suggested that they might be ‘estranged’ words in Egyptian or Coptic, or Hebrew. All the experts in these languages we have consulted are sceptical/incredulous. 70 Oddly enough, however, the name Stna might be a corruption of, or otherwise related to, the name Στεναχτ[α] in the Sidi Kaddou text against hail and other natural disasters (SEG 44: 859 = Kotansky GMA under no. 11 l. 2) cited by Fernández Nieto elsewhere in this volume, p. 561. Although there are also nine names there, none of the others is remotely similar to Sedatus’; nevertheless it is conceivable that such texts against agrarian misfortune were one inspiration for his entire enterprise.71 On ‘incompetence’ in this sense, see R.L.

Th e nomina magica used by the author of the somewhat later puppy-defi xiones from the Charente Inférieure (see nn. 11, 14 above), viz. atracatetra catigallara precata egdarata hehes celata mentis ablata, are considerably more adventurous albeit cut with Latin.

However their polysyllabism indicates both a diff erent origin from the fi rst nine and a loft ier ambition. At the same time the rather feeble recurrence in Halcemedme of the same syllable /me/ separated by an euphonic /d/, as well as its simple trochaic rhythm ( ́ ̆ ́ ̆), suggests no great competence or confi dence.74 Th is conclusion can be compared with the low level of technical competence shown by the earliest of the Gallo-Roman phylacteries from near Limoges, cited above (p. 498 n. 11) which consists almost entirely of poor-qual-ity magical signs (charakteres).

Th e repetition of Halcemedme must be deliberate, to give the impression of a fi nale.Rituals directed to cosmic PowersTh e most intriguing feature of Sedatus’ texts however is the repeti-tion of a prayer to obtain blessings in each cardinal direction. Th ere are several references in the magical papyri to the four winds of the cosmos that are directed or ruled over by a supreme god. In several cases this god is identifi ed as the all-powerful Agathos Daimon, or Agathodaimon.75 Th is Agathos Daimon is not, or is not just, the Clas-sical and Hellenistic spirit of benevolent chance, nor the Alexandrian deity of success and plenty.76 Th e deity invoked in the magical papyri (also referred to in the Hermetic and alchemical texts) is far more than this, a compound being, lord of the entire kosmos in all its six dimen-sions, east, west, north, south, up, down. His value to the learned (and inventive) composers of the magical papyri lay in this combination of ancient creative divinities with several aspects of the Sun, rising 74 One is reminded of the feeble nomen sarbasmisarab in an ‘incompetent’ series from Hadrumetum (DTAud 272–74; AE 1905: 171).75 E.g. PGrMag IV 1605–42, which is related to XIII 761–792, where Agathos Daimon is called παντοκράτωρ. At XIV 8f., Agathos Daimon is described as (gen.) παντοκράτορος, τετραπροσώπου δαίμονος ὑψίστου, ‘omnipotent, highest daimon, with four faces’, which is a physical expression of his control over the four quarters, i.e. the cosmos seen as a whole (but see Fauth 1995, 24f. for another interpretation).76 On Greek and Graeco-Egyptian Agathodaimon, cf.

Some of these transformations may have dropped all reference to the ‘Aionian’ deity in favour of a direct appeal to ‘names’. It seems to us therefore that, despite the obvious lack of authenticity in Sedatus’ prayer, and despite the early date, we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect dependence on the Graeco-Egyptian tradi-tion. However, the version available to Sedatus bore only the faintest resemblance to the ‘original’ appeal to Agathos Daemon as lord of the six quarters. To judge from his prayer, the sole features of Graeco-Egyptian magical practice that had reached Autricum by the Domi-tianic-Trajanic period were: the representation of the totality of the 77 Cf. esp.

One possibility is off ered by a recipe in the Great Paris magical codex: Rise up, and clothe yourself in white garments and burn on an earthen censer uncut grains of incense, and say: ‘I have been attached to your holy Form, I have been given power by your holy name, I have been able to partake in your outpouring of good things (ἐδυναμώθην τῷ ἱερῷ σοῦ ὀνόματι, ἐπέτυχόν σου τῆς ἀπορροίας τῶν ἀγαθῶν), Lord, god of gods, master, daemon, αθθουϊν θουθουϊ ταυαντι· λαω απτατω.82 Th e association between ritual purity, the burning of incense, knowl-edge of divine names and successful magical request could scarcely be more clearly expressed. Th ere are however a small number of recipes in the corpus, some of them quite elaborate, that prescribe a ‘total’ ritual requiring the practitioner to turn successively in diff erent direc-tions. A straightforward one to obtain a direct vision reads:Having drawn in spirit with your senses, say the fi rst ‘name’ in one breath to the east, the second to the south, the third to the north, the fourth to the west. . . . .83We may suppose that Sedatus had been told of, or read about, a ritual of this kind that he could use to obtain personal blessings. Th e corpus of magical papyri however also contains a few recipes for granting success and prosperity to a house or a business, all of which involve the modelling of a divine image, which is to be activated from time to time by means of a blood-off ering and a libation, and by the recita-tion of the appropriate nomina magica.84 We should perhaps envisage Sedatus also from time to time performing a similar ritual to ensure his prosperity.82 PGrMag IV 213–17 (tr.

If we interpret it as ultimately Graeco-Egyptian, we may add it to the phylactery from near Limoges as the earliest testimony in Lugdunensis to the infl uence of such magical practice for benefi cent ends. However, the absence of one of the typi-cal features of that tradition, charakteres, implies that there must have been other, indirect, types of transmission to the western Empire.85 Sedatus surely had no written model in front of him: we may per-haps think of him as using an oral, living text. Alternatively we may prefer to argue that Sedatus was infl uenced by an essentially Roman view of the Druids, and saw himself as part of an invented tradition of ‘authentic’ Druidism, even though he had no other language than Latin in which to express it. It may be however that these positions are not in fact as far apart as they appear. Even if he believed himself to be acting like a Druid, there can be no question that Sedatus’ idea of what an elevated magi-cal praxis would be like—again, we need to remember how diff er-ent his prayer is from the forms of ‘traditional’ healing magic—was itself infl uenced by a template that derived ultimately from Hellenis-tic Egypt.86 His ‘Druidic’ magic drew its inspiration from the eastern Mediterranean. From this perspective we can view him as a humbler, Gallic Nigidius Figulus, fascinated by the possibility of obtaining ritual power through magical praxis. Sedatus’ apparent social standing and cultural horizon indeed confi rms the impression we have from other sources that the practice of magical ritual was by no means confi ned to the illiterate and socially marginal. Such rituals were evidently passed around pragmatically, without much attention being paid to their ori-gin and status.87 In this case, Sedatus clearly thought of his prayer, whatever its origin, as a form of true, and especially eff ective, piety. 85 However, characteres can only be said to be typical of certain magical genres, not by any means of all. 86 Th e shift from a ‘natural’ list in text B (one written across the page) to a list in columnar form (text A) is suggestive here: the columnar list of nomina magica was an important technique of Graeco-Egyptian magic. 87 Th e fourfold (or rather 16-fold) repetition of his name makes it clear that there were (usually) no sanctions against this type of magic, whether or not Sedatus chose to conceal his ritual equipment.

Introduction: Magic, Religion and MysteriesTh e plethora of recent studies on Greek and Roman magic is but one expression of the growing scholarly interest in modes of relating to the supernatural outwith the control of institutions. I do not propose here to discuss the cultural factors underlying that interest, the tacit or unconscious infl uences that aff ect our ideological constructions of the past (and of course our own present). We should nevertheless at least be aware of that wider context, which inevitably infl uences both the choice to work in a particular fi eld and the type of arguments considered plausible and persuasive. Perceptions of past (and pres-ent) relationships with the supernatural are particularly subject to such invisible cultural infl uence.I start from the position that religion is one of the complex institu-tions that arise out of the process of state-formation.1 As such, it was from the beginning under the control of the various politico-social élites, and tended to be identifi ed with their interests. Cosmology and bodies of organised knowledge relating to the heavens and to the future, most obviously in Babylonia and Egypt, with their large profes-sional priesthoods, but also in Greece and at Rome, developed in this context. Th ese knowledge-practices were controlled by religious rules, and so by those who administered and interpreted them. Th e internal confl icts of the ruling group were, at any rate to some degree, refl ected in the divergences and contradictions within these bodies of knowl-edge. In the ancient Near-East, where magical practice was heavily institutionalised, it was primarily a matter of specially-qualifi ed priests 1 Alvar 2001, 165–168.

One aspect of this category was magic, which covered a heterogeneous set of beliefs and practices linking the individual with the supernatural through channels outside the established norms.4 When magic was identifi ed as a depository of uncontrolled religious thought and prac-tice, its boundaries became blurred until it became a phenomenon that was diffi cult to understand and hard to categorise; the various classi-fi cations of Antiquity were no more generally valid than the changing criteria of today.5 Of course not all religious practice outside offi cial and legitimate private (family) cult was considered magical. In late-Republican and imperial Rome, for example, a specifi c category was negotiated for cults that lacked the institutional sanction of the college of the XVviri. Th ey were grouped together under the category of peregrina sacra, for-eign worship.

Mystery-cults, being Greek in origin, could like ‘foreign worship’ be considered phenomena that were potentially disturbing or prob-lematic. Th is did not necessarily mean that their practices were identi-fi ed as magic, although the confl icts of interest made it easier to accuse the followers of mysteries precisely of such practice. However, the history of mystery-cults at Rome was linked not so much to the evolution of magic as to their transformation into practices tolerated by the system. Th e process of integration was problematic, which is why in the mid-Republic the cult of Dionysus/Bacchus was persecuted all over Italy, and later, in the late Republic and early Julio-Claudian period, that of Isis, and restrictions imposed upon aspects of the cult of the Mater Magna.6 However in the early imperial period measures were gradually implemented to incorporate them into the dominant system, and they were given new profi les in exchange for the abandonment of certain features that were less acceptable. Over a span of three centuries, this process of assimilation ended with the mystery-cults becoming a key aspect of the pagan answer to the chal-lenge of Christian argument.72. Th e Relation between Mithraism and Magical PracticesIn Egypt, as is well known, one of Isis’ most important areas of action is magic: she is deployed in a great many historiolae, one of the basic modes of Egyptian magic, and, like Osiris, was closely associated with the protective ded and tit amulets.8 Yet it is almost impossible to fi nd evidence for this aspect of her cult in the Roman West: like many other aspects of the Egyptian cult, it seems to have been simply brack-eted in the quite diff erent cultural milieu of the western Mediterra-nean. We need to bear this example in mind when we turn to the main 6 See e.g. M. Beard, J. North and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome (Cambridge 1998) 1: 91–6; 160f.; 180 etc.; R.

Th is issue has recently become topical with the publication of Attilio Mastrocinque’s book on Mithraic magical amulets, which runs a larger argument to the eff ect that the cult, which he sees as shot through with the magika of the Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha, may have been founded in western Asia Minor, or in the Aegean (say on Samothrace, where we know there was a mystery-tradition), in the fi rst half of Ia, roughly contemporary with the ascendancy and fall of Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus.9 Th is claim provides me with an opportunity to review the problem, in particular the long-standing controversy relat-ing to the so-called Mithras Liturgy. 2.1. Th e ‘Mithras Liturgy’10In 1903, Albrecht Dieterich (1866–1908) re-published a remarkable text preserved in the IVp Great Paris magical Codex, which he claimed to have been an offi cial liturgy of the cult of Mithras.11 It was sup-posedly a description of the Mithraic ritual for the ascension and immortalisation of the soul (ἀπαθανατισμός).12 Th is he claimed to have been the liturgy of the highest sacrament available to initiates in the Mithraic mysteries. Th e ritual fused the teachings of this cult with Stoic cosmology and Egyptian wisdom (1903, 82). Its author(s) were Mithras-worshippers who had assimilated Greek (especially Stoic) cosmological and other ideas. Th e actual compiler of the text we have 9 Mastrocinque 1998, cf. the review by R.L. Gordon, CR 50 (2000) 321f.10 Th ere is a persistant and troubling unclarity concerning the denotion of the term ‘Liturgy’ in this context. Sometimes the title is used to refer only to the supposedly Mithraic section, the ἀπαθανατισμός proper (i.e. PGrMag IV 485–732), sometimes to the entire text as presented by the Codex (PGrMag IV 475–820/829 or even 830).

Th e original material however came from a genuine Mithraic liturgy for the ascension of the soul and its ‘immortalisation’ (1903, 85). Th e evidence for the identifi cation of this text as Mithraic lay primarily of course in the explicit mention of the god Helios Mithras at the begin-ning (482), and the evidently ‘Persian’ dress (ἀναξυρίδες, l. 699) of the ultimate, highest deity who is supposed actually to provide the revela-tion. Dieterich also believed that he could discern a refl ection of seven grades of Mithraic initiation in the seven spheres he thought the soul in the document passed through on its way to ‘immortalisation’. His major aim however was to point up the limitations and distortions of the brave new type of positivist history of religion, based on archaeol-ogy and epigraphy, represented by the Belgian scholar Franz Cumont (1868–1947), whose great two-volume work Textes et monuments fi gu-rés had recently appeared to general acclaim.13Almost as soon as they appeared, Dieterich’s claims were rejected by Richard Reitzenstein (1861–1931) and by Cumont, the two experts who were to shape the orthodox view of the ‘Graeco-oriental’ myster-ies.14 Reitzenstein suggested that the most signifi cant parallels were to be found in Hermetic writings as well as in private mysteries calqued on Graeco-Egyptian syncretism, magic and sun-worship, so that the Paris text could not be “the” Mithras liturgy. Cumont argued that the supposedly Mithraic ritual bore no relation to the eschatology of the mysteries, which involved (he believed, on the basis of Origen, C. Celsum 6.22) the ascent of the soul through the planets. He thus managed to ignore both the fact that the ritual does not claim to be eschatological and Dieterich’s main point against his (Cumont’s) reconstruction of Mithraism, that in an area as extensive as the Roman Empire the cult may well have developed variants.13 Cumont 1896–99.

In the ’thirties Th eodor Hopfner even went so far as to claim that he was forced to consider the ‘Liturgy’ “trotz aller erhobenen Einwände doch als wichtigstes Dokument der Mithrasweihe”, but his remained a lonely voice at a time of fairly general scepticism.15In 1976 Marvin Meyer took up the discussion by publishing a com-mented English translation of the ‘Liturgy’ in which he essentially agreed with Dieterich, while introducing new arguments and modi-fying some previous ones. In his criticism of those who denied the Mithraic nature of the document, he noted some secondary issues which suggested that the text was indeed part of the marginal litera-ture of Mithraism, albeit combined with other currents of religion and thought, whose infl uence on the document is palpable. Moreover, he urged that there is no solid reason to suggest that the underlying ritual is not Mithraic (Meyer 1976, vii). Th e features he adduced are: the explicit mention of the “great god Helios Mithra” (l. 482), the invoca-tion of the elements (ll. 487–537), the descriptions of the fi re-breathing god Aion (ll. 587–616), of Helios (ll. 635–637) and the supreme god (ll. 693–704). In addition to these internal considerations, the accounts of Mithraic belief by Celsus, ap. Origen, Contra Celsum 6.21f., and Porphyry, De antro nymph. 5f. (etc.) tend to support the possibility that in some places at least a ritual specifi cally related to the ascen-sion of souls may have been developed, which might well look rather like the ‘Liturgy’.16 It was considerations such as these that led Meyer to conclude that at any rate the Urtext might represent a variety of Mithraism, albeit not ‘pure’ Mithraism as commonly presented, but a variant concerned with individual ‘psychic’ experience, syncretism and magic. In short, a hypothetical variant of Mithraism specifi c to Egypt.15 Th . Hopfner, s.v.

Th e briefer one, ll. 750–834, contained additional instructions (διδασκαλία τῆς πράξεως), including the preliminary rites and the optional ceremonies. Aft er a brief introduction (ll. 475–485), the text evokes seven steps or moments during the soul’s ascent, viz.:1.

His procedure is to track down the precise origin of each of the signifi cant elements and thereby establish a sort of chromosome-chart for the text, thus revealing its true debts. Th e book also includes a full history of research, starting with Dieterich (2003, 1–26), and a useful, very detailed, analysis of the elements of the entire text (2003, 60–87). Here Betz identifi es four main sections: 1. Th e Exordium (ll. 475–485), consisting of a brief prayer to Providence and the World-Soul, followed by the establishment of the author’s (or copyist’s) right to proceed in such a manner. According to Mer-kelbach (1992, 155f.), this brief exordium replaced a longer section describing the ritual preparatory to the ἀπαθανατισμός.2. Th e Central body of the ritual, the ἀπαθανατισμός (ll. 485–732), with the opening prayers, the invocation of the four elements, the request for ‘immortalisation’ (i.e. becoming divine), the self-presentation of the initiate, the prescription for the breathing ritual, the introduction to the ascent ritual, and the account of the ascent in seven scenarios. 3. Th e Supplemental rituals (ll. 732–819): three optional rituals if one wishes to include an associate or assistant; additional instructions concerning the ingredients for the preparatory rituals (sun-scarab; kentritis); a variety of other details; fi nally the instructions for the protective phylacteries. 4. Th e text ends with a brief Epilogue (ll. 819–820). In his discussion of the genre, composition and context of the text, Betz evinces some hesitation (2003, 26–38). Although the ‘Liturgy’ is now incorporated into the Great Paris Codex, it is generically diff er-ent from the other recipes contained in that grimoire; as Dieterich recognised, it has clearly been adapted from another, diff erent context. Th e author (who was, we may assume, not himself the editor, com-piler or copyist of the Codex, which is a collection of recipes from many sources) based himself on earlier documents, essentially §2, the so-called ἀπαθανατισμός, and the source(s) of §3, which he modifi ed in the light of his wider aim and to which he added the Exordium (§1) and the Epilogue (§4).18 18 Th e supplementary ritual in §3 (ll. 732–820), which contains items whose names are Greek but denote Egyptian place-names, animals, plants and minerals, is perfectly in keeping with many other recipes in PGrMag."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":" mithraism and magic 527Th e crucial question here however is: What was the nature of the Urtext that underlies §2? Th e sole deity mentioned, Helios Mithras, is never named there, only in the Exordium (l. 482). Th e implication, however, is that the author of the ‘Liturgy’ as a whole thought that the supreme god of §2 was indeed Mithras; which would be a strong hint at the nature of the Urtext of that section. However the content of §2 as a whole does not fi t very well with what we know about the cult of Mithras from other sources. Against that, we know very little about the cult’s actual practice; and there is a growing acceptance of the idea of regional variants in Mithraism, arising from local syncretis-tic processes.19 Th e lack of fi t between our circumstantial knowledge of Mithraism (hardly any of which comes from Egypt) and §2 may thus not be very telling. However that may be, the trousers worn by the supreme god, his close relation to light and brightness, and the detail of the golden calf ’s shoulder that he holds in his right hand, evidently to spin the world (l. 699f.), might legitimate acceptance of the Urtext as Mithraic in some non-trivial sense.20 At the same time, since the ‘Liturgy’ makes clear that its users are already μύσται, initiates, it can-not be understood as the ritual of fi rst initiation, by means of which the worshipper was admitted into the mystery-cult. It must represent some higher, more esoteric, ritual within Mithraism with which the author of the ‘Liturgy’ was familiar.Betz also considers the wider aims of the author in editing §2 into a new ritual context (the ‘Liturgy’). No traditional god, Greek or Egyp-tian, is referred to. Th ere is no perceptible Platonic, Jewish or Christian infl uence. However the familiarity of §3 with Graeco-Egyptian magical practice implies that the author was attached to a temple, or at any rate had had experience as a temple-priest. Th ough he does not use theological material specifi cally attributable to Th ebes in Upper Egypt, the provenance of the codex suggests that author may have been a (former) temple-priest from one of the temples there. But, as Dieterich fi rst stressed, the appeal to Πρόνοια and Ψυχή in the exordium, and 19 Th is is one of the main themes of Clauss 2000, though in practice he oft en dis-regards it.20 See esp. the commentary on ll. 628–61, 661–2, and 692–732 (2003, 166–75; 180–5). In an earlier publication, however, he seems much more convinced that Dieterich was right: “Th e long-standing debate principally between Albrecht Dieterich and Franz Cumont appears to have been fi nally decided in favor of the former”: Betz 1991, 252, citing Meyer 1976; Klauck 1982, 156–8; and Vermaseren 1982, 25.

How are we to combine a markedly Egyptian context with such Greek infl u-ence? We must be reminded of the very type of ambitious syncretisers of Greek and Egyptian wisdom, the Hermetists.21 Betz concludes that the ‘Liturgy’ belongs to a formative stage of Hermeticism based on a Greek cosmology, and was probably drawn up in the fi rst or second centuries CE.22Betz is thus more circumspect than Dieterich or Meyer in his view of the author’s religious background or context. From the use of words such as μυστήριον/α to describe the ritual (ll. 476, 723, 746, 794), he con-cludes he must have been initiated into a mystery cult, possibly a vari-ant of Mithraism adapted to Egyptian circumstances, but admits that it might have been any other mystery that had appropriated Mithraic elements, since the cosmology of the seven spheres or seven heavens was to be found in other systems in the Graeco-Roman world.23 Although it is off ered with due caution, I believe this conclusion to be mistaken: in my view the references in §2 of the text to Mithras and his cult are superfi cial and purely circumstantial.24 Before connecting §2 with a specifi c mystery-cult, we should note that the references to μυστήριον vel sim. occur not there but in the Exordium and in the section linking §§2 and 3. Th ey are therefore additions by the author, part of his re-working of the Urtext to fi t the new context. No safe conclusion about the status or the intention of the Urtext can be based on them. Besides, F. Graf has rightly argued that mystery-language in 21 Cf. G. Fowden, Th e Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind (Cambridge 1986).22 Betz here seems to count the Exordium as part of §2, another example of the muddling indeterminacy of the title ‘Liturgy’. As I have pointed out, Merkelbach attempted to reconcile the two quite diff erently, by supposing that the text represents Alexandrian syncretism within the cult of Agathos Daemon (1992).23 Betz 2003, 139f.; cf. idem, 1991, 252. W. Fauth, invoking a ‘magisch-mystischer Adept’, and citing Betz’ earlier work (Betz 1991, 249), is confi dent that the ἀπαθανατισμός demonstrates a close connection between experience of (unspecifi ed) mysteries (“steht außer Zweifel”); but he could cite no specifi c evidence, only very general features of the type that Reitzenstein used to invoke as ‘mystic’, such as silence, cosmokinetic phenomena, threatening gods and angels, the opening and closing of the initiate’s eyes so as to behold marvels, as well as the idea of a mystic rebirth aft er death (1995, 8f.). 24 Nor do I accept that the text is ‘monotheistic’; as H. Versnel has amply shown (Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion 1. Ter Unus. Isis, Dionysos, Hermes. Th ree Studies in Henotheism. SGRR 6 (Leyden 1990) 35ff .), there is.nothing odd about a polytheist invoking a single deity deemed ‘greatest’, ‘highest’ or more powerful than all others.

Since the Exor-dium too surely belongs to the later redaction, I use no arguments, for example about the absence of women from the cult of Mithras, that depend upon it.27 Finally something needs to be said about an issue that has haunted the discussion ever since Dieterich was forced to concede that his text could not be “the” Mithraic liturgy, namely the spectre of ‘local variants’ of the cult of Mithras, for which the chief evidence adduced is the existence of the ‘Liturgy’ itself. It certainly is the case that Cumont, and Mithraic scholarship since, has tended to reconstruct a monolithic cult on the tacit basis of an idealised, vaguely mediaeval, Christianity. Given the evidential problems inherent in our material for the cult, there are good heuristic reasons for such a proce-dure; every scholar however would agree that, given ancient commu-nicative conditions, the small-group character of the cult, and wider ancient attitudes towards religious discourse, regional and local varia-tion must have been a constant (cf. Clauss 2000). However there can be no general or theoretical answer to the real question, namely the 25 F. Graf, Comment devenir magicien? Le rituel d’initation gréco-égyptien, in A. Morand (ed.), L’initiation: Actes du Colloque international de Montpellier (Mont-pellier 1992) 27–35; idem 1996, 197.26 None of these additional instructions (ll. 7320–819), such as the scarab ceremony of the sun, the preparation of the kentritis plant, and the phylacteries (see Betz 2003, 223f. with nn. 791f.), bears any resemblance to what we know about Mithraism or Hermeticism for that matter, but they are perfectly consistent with dozens of other recipes in the PGrMag.27 According to the exordium, the text as a whole is addressed to a θυγάτηρ (l. 479). On the ordinary understanding of the cult of Mithras, women were excluded, cf. Alvar 2000, 106 and 303 = 2008, 120 n. 290; A. Chalupa, Hyenas or Lionesses?

On the other hand, one cannot help suspecting that appeal to local variation is all too convenient for those who want to argue in favour of at least §2 of the ‘Liturgy’ being sig-nifi cantly Mithraic: when the sceptic adduces counter-evidence taken from the ‘normal’ cult, the reply is simply ‘oh, but we are dealing with a local variant, so your evidence does not count’. Quite apart from the obvious point that an untestable theory is doomed to remain mere speculation, a cumulative counter-argument based on many detailed disparities between the ‘normal’ cult and the ‘Liturgy’ surely has some force. At any rate, in what follows, I combine arguments against §2 having been either “the” general Mithraic liturgy or a ritual handbook of any related institutionalised cult.My general complaint about Betz’ procedure is that he appeals only to details and never considers the religious systems as a whole, whether that of the ‘Liturgy’ or of Mithraism. Faced with a particular image or idea in the ‘Liturgy’, he just looks for a plausible link to the Mithraic evidence. But even so the harvest is extremely meagre. His main argu-ment is that the ‘great god Helios Mithras’, explicitly mentioned in the Exordium (l. 482) as having commanded his archangel to reveal the praxis to the redactor, is the unnamed supreme or ultimate god fi nally encountered at the climax of the ἀπαθανατισμός, the god who is to pro-vide the oracle or response the practitioner desires (ll. 696–704).28 Th is deity is certainly dressed in trousers (ἀναξυρίδες) just like Mithras of the mysteries, and we can also accept the details that he is young, vast in size and radiant with light, even perhaps that he has golden hair,29 as being appropriate to an epiphany and to a θεὸς μέγιστος. But there are two details, the white χιτών and the golden crown (ll. 698), that simply contradict standard Mithraic iconography: except sometimes in phase III at Dura, Mithras wears a red, pink, gold, green or black tunic, but never white; and always wears a Phrygian cap to distinguish 28 “Th is god is certainly Mithras, although it is peculiar that his name is not men-tioned” (Betz 2003, 182). 29 In the majority of surviving coloured images, for example at Capua, Marino, Barberini, and in almost all the many images at Dura, Mithras has brown or dark hair. But he has yellow or golden hair on the small relief from the Castra peregrinorum, Rome (Lissi Caronna 1986, 35f. with pl. XV), and on the relief of Atpeni at Dura (V. 37); on the second relief, that of Zenobios (V. 40), the fi rst two coats are of yellow paint, the third, covering them, black. Th e entire face, hair, cap and hands of Mithras on the larger relief from the Castra peregrinorum and the entire stucco head belong-ing to the main cult-group, are gilded (Lissi Caronna 1986, 34 with pls.

Whatever the source of this imagery, then, it does not seem to be the mysteries as attested archaeologically. Th e other major distinguishing feature of this fi nal deity is that he holds in his right hand the μόσχου ὦμον χρύσεον, the golden shoulder of a bull-calf (l. 699f.), the signifi cance of which is quickly explained: this is the (Egyptian) symbol of Arktos, the Great Bear, responsible for the turning of the fi xed stars (but also, oddly enough, the seasons). Th is has been the subject of considerable debate, summarised by Betz (2003, 183–5). Th e matter is too complex to go into here.30 I will only say that, although there is some evidence that Mithras was sometimes linked in the mysteries with cosmokinetic phenomena such as thun-der and lightning (which feature in this passage of the ‘Liturgy’ too),31 the likeliest explanation for the identity of this god is that off ered by W. Fauth: he is a complex, deliberately-syncretistic fusion of Helios as fi ery world-orderer, a pantheistic Phanes-Protogonos, and (Alexan-drian) Aion-Agathos Daemon as kosmokrator and reconciler of cos-mic antitheses (Fauth 1995, 31–33). Th ere is a little evidence, especially in the title Zeus he sometimes bears, and the Porphyrian exegesis of him as demiurge, that Mithras of the mysteries came to be understood in analogous, though certainly simpler terms. As Fauth shows, how-ever, the syncretism of the ‘Liturgy’ is wholly consistent with the gen-eral strategy of the more complex recipes of the PGrMag. Th e other connections between the ‘Liturgy’ and Mithraic iconogra-phy adduced by Betz are unconvincing, either because of their ambigu-ity, their lack of specifi city or simply because they are poor examples.32 Moreover, several would-be examples, such as the seven virgins who emerge from the depths, as Τυχαί from Heaven, or the Lords of the 30 Th e discovery of the ceiling decoration of the Ponza mithraeum, which shows the Great and Little Bear with Draco has proved that these constellations did attract some interest in the speculation of the mysteries, but that is not to say that this inter-est relates to the ‘Liturgy’, which clearly conceives the constellation in Egyptian terms; cf. esp. R.L. Beck, Interpreting the Ponza Zodiac 1 and II, JMS 1 (1976) 1–19 and 2 (1977–8) 87–147 = Beck 2004, 151–231 (rather over-elaborate). Secondly, whatever the object held by Mithras in the “obeisance of Sol” scene, Richard Gordon tells me (against his earlier view) that it is almost certainly not a calf’s shoulder; at least some-times there can be no doubt that it is the hind-quarter of the dead bull, and therefore part of the Mithraic sub-narrative connected with the First Sacrifi ce. 31 See recently, R.L. Gordon, Mithras Helios astrobrontodaimôn?

Yet Betz cannot point to a single such case. We can only conclude that our knowledge of Mithraism is not increased in the slightest by the ‘Liturgy’: it simply adds further, unnecessary, enigmas. Th e appeal to local variants of Mithraism thus turns out to be self-defeating.We may also think it strange that the ‘Liturgy’ derives from an area, namely Egypt, which has produced hardly any archaeological evidence of regular Mithraism.34 It is true that this circumstance might change if, say, a mithraeum were discovered in Alexandria; but on present evidence the regular cult of Mithras was hardly present in Egypt, so that there was no widespread basis of knowledge about the cult which might reasonably have produced a variant such as the ‘Liturgy’ whose Sitz im Leben seems so clearly to be diff erent. Another relevant consideration has hardly been raised in the entire discussion so far. Is there any evidence that regular Mithraism knew a ritual that might have inspired the Urtext underlying §2 (the ἀπαθανατισμός)? Th ere can be no doubt that individual communities possessed texts of some kind: tantalising fragments among the graffi ti of phases II and III at Dura-Europus, and the discrete verses on the walls of the mithraeum of Santa Prisca in Rome, make this certain.35 But of what scope? And what status did they have? Th e key factor must have been the degree of literacy of the founder(s) of each community; the exis-tence of written texts is aft er all well-documented in other telestic cults.36 Evidence for the authority of the book in general—not neces-sarily, but plausibly, a Mithraic one—is provided by the frescoes of ‘magi’ at Dura, where both fi gures hold a papyrus roll or codicillus. 33 Betz 2003, 174–80. 34 Vermaseren’s entry (V. 91–105) wrongly attributes the Hermopolis relief (V. 91) to the unpublished Memphis mithraeum (V. 92–101).

But in this narrower connection, they allude to arcane, esoteric wisdom. As for Santa Prisca, I see no diffi culty in taking the dipinti as excerpts from a single carmen sacrum composed by one of the members of the community in the Severan period. Th e fragmentary line 21, reddite cantu, “rehearse in song”, legitimates the inference that singing was envisaged, either on a particular occasion or regularly, at least in this mithraeum.37 Th e ordering of the texts is compatible with the notion that the carmen consisted of an introduction in metrical iambic sena-rii, the metre, certainly or probably, of the fi rst three preserved lines, followed by a main body in metrical hexameters. Th e formulation of the thoughts is personal to the composer; but the thoughts themselves draw upon the common body of Mithraic belief. Th is carmen would be a local attempt to fi x the oral hieros logos in dignifi ed form, that is, a narrative fi lled out with simple commentary or exegesis. But it bears no resemblance whatever to the ἀποθανατισμός. Despite its general importance for our knowledge of the cult, then, the evidence from Sta Prisca does not support the idea that there existed rituals within Mithraism that might have inspired §2 of the ‘Liturgy’. Furthermore, it seems on comparative grounds likely that many Mithraic communities possessed books of prayers ( precationes) and instructions for sacrifi cial ritual, of the type that were current in many small religious groups.38 Such books were not standardised: they were the individual creation and property of individual commu-nities, characterised by the enthusiasms and exegeses of their several authors.39 But there is no reason to think they were more elaborate than this—precisely pro formas of prayers and instructions for sacrifi ces.

Mithraic Gems and AmuletsI have mentioned that the third of the Supplementary Rituals contains a (defective) recipe for phylacteries, one for each arm.41 Th e skin of a black sheep is to be used for the amulet for the right arm, and that of a white sheep for the left arm; both are to be inscribed in myrrh ink with the prophylactic text. Th is is clearly magical, not Mithraic. Some amuletic gems from various locations in the Roman Empire do how-ever undeniably carry the iconography of the cult of Mithras.42Some years ago, Attilio Mastrocinque drew attention to the amuletic gems and related objects with Mithraic motifs (Mastrocinque 1998). His study was based on the various collections of ‘gnostic gems’ from 40 A common recent tendency is to claim that the ‘Liturgy’ contains elements that were to be found in the worship of Mithras, so that it might have been used one way or another in its rituals, e.g. Beck 1984, 2051; A.F. Segal, Heavenly Ascent in Helle-nistic Judaism, early Christianity and their Environment, ANRW II, 23.2 (1984) 1382; Clauss 2000, 105–108, although he mistakenly believes that the rite of immortalisa-tion was for initiands, not someone who had already been initiated.

His general aim here was to argue that the ‘Persian origin’ of the mysteries must be taken to include the magika associ-ated with Zoroaster in the so-called Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha: we should think of the cult as practising the whole gamut of the magian arts, magical divination, healing, astrological prediction.45As regards the Mithraic gems and amulets, the major issue is whether they are to be understood as an expression of the private religious beliefs of those initiated into the mysteries of Mithras, or whether they repre-sent a magical use of Mithraic themes by individuals outside this cult.46 I would argue in favour of the latter conclusion. But it must be admit-ted that scholars in this fi eld oft en tend to take refuge in vague, sug-gestive, or merely hopeful, references to Mithras and Mithraic imagery whenever they discuss solar motifs: for example, the index to Michel’s British Museum catalogue lists 37 references to the cult of Mithras, yet the Museum possesses not a single Mithraic gem in the strict sense (2003, 2: 32).47 In my view, we need to be far more critical about such language.43 C.

Th e obverse represents tauroctonous Mithras accompa-nied by Cautes and Cautopates, surrounded by a selection of Mithraic symbols, which show detailed familiarity with the iconography of the regular cult. On the reverse is a lion standing on a ground-line with a bee entering its mouth; above it are depicted seven stars (i.e. the planets), each encircled by an ὄνομα βάρβαρον in Greek letters.48 Mas-trocinque does his best to fi nd arguments in favour of the properly Mithraic nature of the piece, but his eff orts are particularly forced in relation to these “secret names of the planetary gods”.49 No other evi-dence, whether textual or documentary, legitimates the belief that the planets had secret names in the cult; this in turn suggests to me that the specifi c iconography of the reverse derives from a quite diff erent religious context from that which we normally designate ‘Mithraism’. At any event, the presence of secret names is uncharacteristic of ordi-nary followers of Mithras, who would surely not have wanted thus to reveal or expose them to outsiders. If Mastrocinque’s identifi cations of these names are correct, we would have to suppose that such an amulet was commissioned by an indi-vidual outside the mainstream cult who was not subject to the rule of secrecy. In the case of the Florentine heliotrope, we can say that the authority of the tauroctony-scene, taken as a short-hand for the cult of Mithras as a whole, is invoked to reinforce the claim—whatever it is—being made by the reverse.50 A similar explanation holds good for the fi ve (or six) cases where a regular Mithraic iconography is associ-ated with a clearly magical image or invocation.51 One of these gems 48 Th e older lit. in Mastrocinque 2004, 303–5 no. 256 = V. 2354 = Merkelbach 1984 fi g. 165a, b; Mastrocinque 1998, 1–10.

What they do illustrate is the creative imagina-tion of the designers of these amulets, which is what makes the inter-pretation of this iconography so troublesome, not to say frustrating; but of that we were already persuaded by the standard catalogues, of Bonner, Delatte & Derchain, Philipp and the others.However, Mastrocinque must be right in claiming that some gems may have belonged to ordinary initiates into the cult, in other words, the faithful who followed the rules established for their entry into the brotherhood. Naturally, only items that conform to what we know about ordinary or ‘standard’ Mithraism should be ascribed to this type of owner. In fact eight intaglios are presently known that bear a plain representation of the bull-slaying without any magical additions.54 Th e most interesting of these is a heliotrope recently found in a mediae-val grave on the Petersberg at Flintsbach, Lkr.

Th e Petersberg gem attempts to provide much more information, by including both the busts of Sol and Luna, and seven large 8-pointed stars divided into two groups, four above the cave and three below, which may well cor-respond to a division between three lower grades (Corax to Miles) and four senior ones (Leo to Pater). Such an allusion is unique among these intaglios. More important still, however, is the depiction of the krater at 7 o’clock, towards which the snake is slithering: this is a typical fea-ture of reliefs from the Rheno-Danubian area, not found in the Italian iconography of the cult. Th is is a coded representation of the deeper signifi cance of the bull’s death, alluding to blood, wine, feasting and (evidently) salvation in the wide sense. I would argue that these gems, many of which have trivial but sometimes interesting deviations from the normative cult-icon (insofar as we can speak in such terms), are examples of personal or private images worn by individuals in com-memoration of their initiation and faith.55 Th e Petersberg example at least was clearly fi tted into a ring. Th ey belong with the great numbers of intaglios showing standard Olympians, such as Jupiter, Mercury, or Minerva but also, most obviously, the gods of the Isis-group.56Quite apart from the suspect reasoning in relation to individual gems, Mastrocinque assumes, indeed more or less takes for granted, that current Mithraic research is fundamentally misguided. Since the nineteen-seventies, it has been generally agreed that there is little if any continuity between Iranian Miθra and Roman Mithraism, even if more learned Mithraists at least seem to have considered them-selves to be the heirs of the Persian religious tradition.57 Mastrocinque 55 Cf. Gordon 2004, 274–8. Th e excavator of the Petersberg gem suggests rather contradictorily that Mithraists were, or might be, presented with a ring when they were initiated, but also that this example must have been “auch in der Antike eine qualitätvolle Rarität” (Meier 2002, 147). Th ere are far too few such gems to admit the idea that such stones were a regular part of initiation: they must have been privately commissioned, and are thus evidence of the internal variation of individual wealth and status in such associations that I mention in §3 below.56 Like these other intaglios depicting regular divinities, the Mithraic gems are all cut with a reverse image, i.e. could be used as personal seals. It is typical of the magical amulets that they are cut ‘straight’, i.e. were not intended to be used for this purpose but kept hidden.57 See Beck 1984; idem, Mithraism aft er ‘Mithraism since Franz Cumont’, 1984–2003, in idem 2004, 3–23.

Fauth (1995, 34–120), the image of the tauroctony, associated as everyone knew with the unconquerable solar god Mithras, might be used to lend authority to protective (and other) amulets.2.3. Mithras in PGrMagTh is point can be confi rmed indirectly by considering the references to Mithra(s) in the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri. Th e much-edited, people cannot distinguish between hagiography and historiography. Th ere is no epi-graphic or (apart from Dura) iconographic evidence for Zoroaster in Roman Mithraism. 58 He cites 1) the graffi to [N]ama Maximus magus at Dura (V. 61) and 2) the graffi to from the Via dei Cerchi mithraeum, Rome, which runs magicas inbictas cede Degentio [. . . (AE 1980: 58), and therefore cannot be used as evidence that a role or rank of magus existed at Rome: Mastrocinque 2003, 158. Th is is frankly not much to go on (both had already been invoked by M. Guarducci, Ricordo della ‘magia’ in un graffi to del mitreo dei Circo Massimo, in Bianchi 1979, 171–82, relying upon a quite imaginary reading). Perhaps rightly, Cumont interpreted one of the two seated fi gures on the faces of the piers of the cult niche of the Th ird Phase at Dura as Zoroaster (Cumont 1975, 186); and denied that the word μάγος/magus there had anything to do with the grade system, believing it rather to be a synonym of σοφιστής (p. 203) [see ibid. n. 293 for another example of the word in IMDur 17, as read by E.D. Francis, though its grammatical case is problematic as read]. For the semantic range of magus, see the paper by J.R. Rives earlier in this volume (p. 60f.). Th e word’s apparent con-notation of wisdom at Dura may conceivably help towards a better understanding of the name Mithras that Apuleius gives to the high priest of Isis who advises Lucius (Apuleius, Met. 11.22; 25).59 In addition to emphasising the Zoroastrian pseudepigraphy, Mastrocinque is also keen to emphasise the Egyptian infl uences on Mithraism (1998, 81–92). Th ese again seem to me largely illusory, granted that the cult is rightly to be seen as a bricolage. 60 He himself seems hardly to believe in his own attempt to show that individual Mithraic patres may have been interested in necromancy (1998, 96–8)."},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"540 jaime alvar ezquerraand therefore somewhat enigmatic, Cat-ritual in P.Mimaut (PLouvre 2391 = PGrMag III 1–164) invokes Mithra(s) twice (ll. 80f.; 100f.), each time in association with the ὄνοματα ναμαζαρ αναμαρια, a pair that clearly implies some acquaintance with the Mithraic acclama-tion νάμα, Hail! In the fi rst passage (which assumes the second), he is identifi ed with the Cat-daemon, who, as we have already learned, “has the form of Helios available to [it]” (l. 4f.), and who is both a ναυτικός, the steersman of the night-bark of Helios-Re, and associated with the mighty Seth-Typhon.61 In the second passage, the ναυτικός is addressed as Meliouchos (here a hypostasis of Helios-Re, possibly the equivalent of Heka, magical binding force) and as Mithra, and is required to halt the bark’s passage so that the practitioner may address Helios-Re directly. It is obvious that Mithra(s) is here understood, like Meliouchos, as a hypostasis of Helios-Re, i.e. exclusively in his capac-ity as a mighty solar deity (Harrauer 1987, 28). Furthermore, there is nothing in this ritual that is related to Mithraism as we understand it from the usual sources. Quite the contrary: he is invoked for the sake of completeness, within an Egyptian mythological context, as part of a strategy, fundamental to this magical style, designed to increase the practitioner’s authority. Other invocations of Mithras in the magical corpus should be interpreted in the same way, as allusions to his power as a solar divinity, not as evidence for a connection between Mithra-ism and magical praxis.62 Th e association of Mithras with other divine names in texts of a diff erent type, such as the therapeutic magic of Alexander of Tralles, in connection with gout, has nothing to do with Mithraism either, as Mastrocinque himself admits: “è certo che Mitra veniva invocato per la 61 See Harrauer 1987, 19–21; she is however wrong to emphasis the antipathy between Helios-Re and Seth-Typhon. Th ere is no mystery about why Seth-Typhon is invoked here: in the Pharaonic sun-theology (e.g. the Amduat) Seth serves as part of the crew of the Sun-bark and helps Re to destroy Apophis, the terrible snake-mon-ster who threatens the bark on its nightly journey, cf. E. Hornung, Die Nachtfahrt der Sonne. Eine altägyptische Beschreibung des Jenseits (Düsseldorf and Zurich 1991) 111–33; Dieleman 2005, 134f.

Th e answer is surely plain enough.3. Taking the Easier Route Mastrocinque’s interpretation is no doubt ingenious and scholarly. He has moreover performed a service in raising, or at any rate resur-recting, the problem of the existence of amuletic gems with an alleg-edly Mithraic theme. Th e whole construct however rests upon two extremely implausible assumptions. Th e fi rst is that Graeco-Roman magic was indeed directly inspired by the Persian mobeds—as though we could take Pliny’s history of magic in HN 30.3–11 as history indeed. Th e truth is of course far more complicated.64 Th e second is that the cult of Mithras in the Roman Empire was likewise directly owed to the same religious experts—the Cumontian paradigm. As we have seen, virtually no one now believes this—and Cumont would have been astonished that his hypothesis about the origins of Mithraism could be instrumentalised in the way that Mastrocinque chooses. Furthermore, the evidence he adduces simply fails to support the main argument.One of the central weaknesses, as we have seen, is the forced con-nection made between the world implied by the amuletic gems and the reality of Mithraism. Much the same can be said of his treatment of the ‘Liturgy’. To prove its Mithraic character, he explains away every-thing that does not appear to be Mithraic, and bends over backwards to fi nd links—be they real or imaginary—with the Mithraism of the 63 Mastrocinque 1998, 126.64 See e.g. Carastro 2006; Graf 1996, 154–7; M.W.

We can allow for a certain décalage between epigraphic and literary informa-tion, between iconography and texts, a degree of divergence between gems and other types of archaeological remains, lack of overlap between dipinti and philosophical speculations—each type of information has its own unique value. Mastrocinque’s magical evidence lacks precisely this type of internal coherence. Using the same arguments, we could easily fi nd other items, such as the Lion-Bull type in the ancient Near East, or the Babyloniaka of Iamblichus, and urge that they too are evidence for ‘real’ Mithraism.66I have argued against two claims, the strong one that mithraea all over the Empire had copies of a text similar to the ‘Liturgy’, and the weaker one that the text may have been used in a local Egyptian vari-ant of Mithraic praxis. To my mind, the real question that needs to be 65 H.G. Horn, Das Mainzer Mithrasgefäß, Mainzer Archäologische Zeitschrift 1 (1994) 21–66; R.

Th e argument I wish to develop here is that they saw such motifs as a means of off ering their clients the advantages of initiation, but at lower economic, social and psychological expense. Th e mysteries in general off ered the assurance that personal salva-tion is possible if the initiate succeeds in liberating himself from his earthly bonds. But there were two types of costs here, real and psycho-logical. Initiation might sometimes, perhaps oft en, be very expensive. For example, before Osiris permits him to undertake his third initia-tion, Lucius was already buying what he needed, <omnibus> ex studio pietatis magis quam mensura rerum mearum collatis (Apuleius, Met. 11.30).67 Indeed, such were the Isiac priests’ demands that he even began to doubt their honesty (ibid. 29). We may allow that initiation was not necessarily expensive: evidence from various parts of the Empire indicates that even slaves might have access to it (though there can of course be no neat correlation between slavery and poverty: some slaves were relatively comfortably off ). If we think of psychological costs, the individual’s fi nancial situation would naturally have a bearing on relationships within such religious associations. Th e internal role and status of someone who could aff ord to stage a taurobolium in the cult of the Mater Magna were inevitably diff erent from those of one who could only aff ord a ram (the criobolium), or indeed no such animal. In other words, the social distribution of the mysteries meant that not all initiates were equally advantaged. As membership increased, so the social diff erences of the outside world were reproduced in the cult associations, and with them their tensions. We should also consider here the ethical demands arising from initiation.68 Personal affi liation to a mystery cult would undoubtedly imply renunciations which not all inhabitants of the Empire were prepared to endure, even though they might have been delighted with the idea of personal salvation. I believe it was these problems that magical practitioners took advan-tage of.6967 “I procured the equipment for my initiation without stint, meeting the expenses more in accordance with religious zeal than with the measure of my assets” (tr. J.A. Hanson).68 Th is is not the place to get into a debate about the ethical rules and demands established by Mithraism for its initiates; see Alvar 2001, 154–62 = 2008, 192–203.69 Some analogous considerations in Bernand 1991, 394–97."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"544 jaime alvar ezquerraAs is well known, we oft en fi nd references to the mysteries in the magical papyri: a magical praxis might be called a μυστήριον, prac-titioners μύσται or μυσταγωγός.70 Such language suggests how eager the authors of the PGrMag were to claim a parallel between their own specialised knowledge-practices and the restricted, salvifi c knowledge off ered by the mysteries, on the one hand, and between their own spiritual quest and that of regular initiates, on the other. From the point of view of the mysteries, however, such language also implied a threat. Initiates into the regular mysteries would be confused by such claims on the part of magical practitioners. Th e off er by the competi-tion of a more accessible route to the same destination would worry the priests. Th e mysteries were in fact surely to be found on the side of ideological repression, denouncing magical practices as supersti-tious and thus as activities contrary to the established order; in other words, the mystery-cults were happy to join in presenting magicians as enemies of the system. Obviously we have no hard information about such confl icts, though I suspect they were fairly common in daily practice. But if it had been possible to construct a map of the provenances of all the ever-extant magico-Mithraic amuletic gems, we might have been able to chart something of the extent to which such a magical short-cut seemed attractive to individuals for whom genuine Mithraism might have been an option. In fact of course such a map is purely speculative: not only is the actual provenance of these items in almost every case unknown, but we have no means even of estimating the order of magnitude involved. Were there once a handful, dozens, hundreds, or thousands of such magico-Mithraic amulets? We have no idea. Never-theless, the very existence of such items suggests that contact between the mysteries and magic may have been more extensive than ordinar-ily supposed. In my view, this is where the true value of the ‘Liturgy’ is to be found.71 It is a commonplace in the study of magic that one means by which practitioners seek to bolster their authority vis-à-vis the (implied 70 Cf. Betz 1991; excluding the ‘Liturgy’, which I have already discussed in this context,we may cite PGrMag I 127; 131; IV 172; 2254; 2477; 2592; V 110; XII 94; 331; 322; 335; XIII 128; 685; XIXa 52; XX 8; etc.71 Mastrocinque does not accept that the ‘Liturgy’ helps us understand Mithraism’s relationship with magic. Th e reason is that he wants regular Mithraism to be magical and therefore does not consider the possibility that it might be usurped by magic, which in my opinion is how we should understand the ‘Liturgy’."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":" mithraism and magic 545or explicit) addressee is to appropriate high-prestige materials from elsewhere and divert them to their own purposes.72 Th e ‘hymns’ in the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are a good example, as are the innumerable fragments or excerpts from the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas, the Pali Canon or the Tripiţaka we encounter in the appro-priate magical praxeis.73 Since, as I have argued, we have no reason to suppose that ordinary Mithraic cult possessed either ‘immortalis-ing’ or standard liturgies, we do not need to suppose the underly-ing Urtext derived from such a context. Hans Lewy long ago noted the similarities between details of the imagined psychic ascent in the ‘Liturgy’ and that of Chaldaean Oracles (taken as a cypher for early theurgy): the separation of the soul from the body and the inhala-tion of sunbeams; the fi nal encounter with the supreme god, which produces ‘immortalisation’ (i.e. a change of spiritual state); the met-onymic death and rebirth of the practitioner conceived as initiate.74 Wanting to create an original and powerful autoptos (direct divinatory encounter with a god), the author of the ‘Liturgy’ based himself on a theurgic or Chaldaean Urtext that described the ascent of the soul in these terms.75 It is not impossible that this Urtext itself drew upon a variety of sources, including the type of speculative Mithraic text that Celsus was acquainted with, which described a spiritual journey up to the fi xed heaven (Turcan has suggested that Celsus here is relying on a neo-pythagorean interpretation of Mithraic ideas).76 Th e ultimate aim was to provide clients not merely with what institutionalised initia-tion (not necessarily Mithraism) could off er, namely a vision of god, but with a means of interrogating him for divinatory purposes. Th e complex process of initiation was reduced to a magical ritual that was 72 Th is habit is naturally most pronounced where the practitioners were themselves priests, most obviously, as I have pointed out earlier, in the Egyptian and Babylonian traditions.73 Mauss 1972, 55 (orig. ed. 1902/3). Mauss here actually cites Dieterich’s ‘Liturgy’ as an example.74 Lewy 1978, 197 n. 85; 207f.; 415. Th is is the more signifi cant in that Lewy himself was inclined to accept Celsus’ account of the κλίμαξ ἑπτάπυλος at face-value. 75 Cf. S.

For those who were attracted by the mysteries, learning about man’s position in the world called for preparation with a men-tor, a process that gradually revealed part of the mystery. All this took time and money, which some did not have. Consequently, those in a hurry, those who could not or would not aff ord the costs of initia-tion, might be prompted to look for a solution to their concerns in other religious or philosophical modes. Th is is where the magicians came in. What they had to off er might be very close to other routes to power and knowledge, but made fewer personal demands. Magic thus became a powerful instrument of social control, operating outside offi cial institutions.79 Hence its subversive potential, and its rejection by the intellectual establishment. Th e magicians, I suggest, usurped the contents of the mysteries, off ering formulae and amulets to answer the demands the mysteries met through complex ritual processes. Th e examples discussed here, the ‘Liturgy’ and the gems, imply an inter-pretation along these lines.Th e number of known amuletic gems related to the cult of Mithras will no doubt continue to grow. We must however be careful to avoid mis-attributing them. Correct attribution is essential if we are to understand their signifi cance, and the praxis of which they were part. 77 So rightly Betz 1991.78 Corp. Herm. frg. 23 ap. Stob.

It is true that Mauss emphasised the extent to which magic is inserted into the social structure, viewing it as a form of private, secret and individualised spirituality independent of organised worship (Mauss 1972). Smith has emphasised the way magic comes to supplement the temple—the rise of the religious entrepreneur (J.Z. Smith, Th e Temple and the Magician, in idem, Map is not Territory [Leyden 1978] 172–89). However, I am not aware of any attempt to understand magic as a mechanism of social control in the manner that I claim here."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":" mithraism and magic 547I believe the hypothesis presented here helps towards a better under-standing of the links in the Roman Empire between diff erent means of access to the supernatural. Once the various mystery-cults became Romanised and respectable, they joined civic religion in defending public order. Magic and ‘superstition’ however did not, could not, sub-mit to the control of the authorities in the same way. Legitimate reli-gious institutions condemned and persecuted such religious practices, fondly dreaming of a state in which all religious activity was institu-tionally regulated. But in truth ‘superstitious’ attitudes abounded even in institutionalised or legitimate religious praxis, without causing guilt or remorse among worshippers, who were completely oblivious to the subversive nature of their beliefs and practices.80 Neither demonic pow-ers nor magic tilted a religion centred upon justifying good fortune towards apocalypticism, but rather the contradictions inherent in the objective religious situation. Instead of hunting down the magician, the bewitcher of souls, the real or imaginary religious entrepreneur, it would have been better to fi nd more eff ective means of accommodat-ing the instrumentalism of popular religion to the dominant theodicy of good fortune—or vice versa.Th e relation of the mysteries—and in particular, Mithraism—with magic may thus have been more complex than is generally allowed. Rather than transform Mithraism into magic, as Mastrocinque does, we should rather try to view both in the wider context of the religious changes of the Empire. BibliographyAlvar, J. 2001.

Th e text is thus an example of a genre of charms known as φυλακτήρια, κωλυτήρια or κωλύματα, designed to protect their owner from a potential threat.7 7 It is of course quite wrong to call this slate a defi xio or a uenefi cium, as do some of the scholars mentioned previously."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"554 francisco javier fernández nietoTh ere are a great many of this type of amulet, comprising anepigraphic talismans as well as written spells. Th ese amulets were sometimes worn on the person; but they might also be deposited in some specifi c place. Th eir purpose was to counteract illnesses, spells, accidents and poten-tial hazards (falls, robbery, poisons, shipwreck, fi res, animal bites, and so on), as well as to ward off plagues and natural disasters. Our piece is one of the latter type of phylacteries, designed to pre-vent damage caused to agricultural crops by what we would call natu-ral forces. Th e text is of a typical all-purpose type covering various eventualities, so that the talisman could be used to ward off the great-est possible number of threats (storm-force winds, torrential rain, hail, snow, frost) as well as noxious pests (e.g. blight, ergot, locusts). Some of these phylacteries also include a catch-all phrase, καὶ ὅσα βλάπτει χωρίαν, “and whatever infl icts harm on the cropland”;8 others, like the Carrio slate, restrict their entreaties to hail. Starting from these texts, and information supplied by classical authors on rituals for warding off pests and weather threats, I want to show how magical resources against hail were believed to work; this in turn will enable us to set the Visigothic document in its appropriate mental and religious context. In doing so I shall try not to forget the words of Delehaye: C’est d’ailleurs une vérité élémentaire que le sens exact d’une parole, l’importance relative d’un détail, l’appréciation d’une série de faits peuvent nous échapper si nous faisons abstraction de l’ensemble et si, nous contentant de ce qu’on nous dit, nous négligeons de savoir ce qu’on a voulu dire. Une même phrase peut avoir plusieurs sens suivant l’intention de celui qui l’énonce.9 1. Ritual PerformanceTh e oldest method of warding off hail storms consisted of actions: uttering a charm, performing a specifi c ritual, or both. Th e most inter-esting and informative literary text is Seneca, Quaest. nat. 4b.6.1–7.2 Gehrke, which I translate: It is said that there are men whose special skill is to watch the clouds and predict when it is going to hail. Th ey managed to learn how to do this thanks to experience, by noting the colour that the clouds usually take 8 E.g. IG XIV 2481, a text I examine in greater detail below.9 Delehaye 1921, 4f."},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":" a visigothic charm from asturias 555on before a hailstorm. 2. It is hard to believe that in Cleonae (= Kleonai) there were some public servants, the chalazophylacae, whose duty was to calculate when it was going to hail. When they had given the sign that hail had arrived, do you think that the men ran out to get their wool-len or leather capes? Not a bit of it. Everyone off ered a sacrifi ce: some a lamb, others a chicken. Immediately the clouds would move somewhere else once they had tasted a little blood. 3. Did you think that was funny? Th is will make you laugh even more. Anybody who did not have a lamb or a chicken would wound himself slightly; and just so you don’t think that the clouds were greedy, he would prick a fi nger with a sharp point and off er his blood: the hailstorm would move away from his land, the same as for those who had made more valuable sacrifi ces. 7.1. Th ere are those who seek an explanation for this. Some, as you would expect from the wisest, say that it is impossible for anyone to negotiate with hail and ward off storms with gift s, even though the off erings may have infl uence, even on the gods. Others say that they suspect that the blood itself contains a certain energy that can divert and drive back a cloud. 2. But how can such a small quantity of blood contain energy enough to soar up and be noticed by the clouds? Th e easy answer would be to say that it is untrue and a legend. And yet the inhabitants of Kleonai would bring charges against those who had been given the task of predicting storms, in the belief that it was through their lack of engagement that vineyards were destroyed or cornfi elds ravaged.Seneca’s account is summarised with a slight twist by Clement of Alex-andria, Strom. 6.31.1–3: Some say that pests, as well as hail, storms and similar phenomena, derive not only from the disorder of matter, but also from a certain restlessness among evil spirits and angels. 2. For example, they say that in Kleonai the magicians, watching the development of clouds that are about to unleash hail, divert the imminence of this rage through spells and sacrifi ces. 3. And it does not matter if they are caught with no ani-mal at hand, as they can comply with the sacrifi ce by making their own fi ngers bleed. Finally, Plutarch, Quaest. conviv. 7.2, 700ef, tells us that these χαλαζοφύλακες or ‘hail-watchers’ at Kleonai, which is in the Pelo-ponnese, would seek to prevent hail destroying the crops by using the blood of a mole, or the blood from the sanitary towels used by the women of the city while they were menstruating. Th e magical power of menstrual blood to ward off bad weather and crop damage by pests is also noted in Roman sources. Pliny, HN 28.77 for example notes that hail and storms are driven away if a menstruating woman shows herself naked to the lightning, and that the same device will avert"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"556 francisco javier fernández nietostorms at sea.10 Palladius, Op. agric. 1.35.1, records that brandishing bloodstained, i.e. sacrifi cial, axes threateningly at the clouds will ward off hail.In the territory of Argolis, which Kleonai belonged to, was also the city of Methana, on the peninsula of the same name. Here the inhabit-ants still held apotropaic ceremonies to protect them from the south-east wind11—which dried out the shoots on the vines—as well as from hail. Th ese ceremonies are described by Pausanias:While the wind is still blowing, two people cleave a cock with spotless white wings into two; they run in opposite directions round the vines, each one carrying half the cock; when they return to the starting out point, they bury the cock there. Th is is the procedure that they have thought up to combat the wind . . . I have also just now seen some men warding off the hail using sacrifi ces and spells.2.34.2f.Presumably the victims here would have been ordinary farmyard cock-erels, as at Kleonai. It is possible that other sources of blood might do as well, but, for now, let us just stick to the information regarding the spilling/presentation of blood, and the symbolic circuit made round the fi eld, an old ritual to mark off the areas to be protected, of which we shall be looking at various examples.12 10 In many peoples and cultures, menstruation was considered a remarkable mystery as well as a reliable magic resource. In certain societies, such blood was used for lus-trations and was believed to possess healing and other magical powers. On menstrual blood in antiquity, see Solinus, Mir. 1.54–8 with my commentary: Solino. Colección de hechos memorables o El erudito (Madrid 2001) ad loc. It was also used against atmo-spheric phenomena at sea and, according to sailors, was a safeguard against St Elmo’s fi re. Little of value in this context can be gleaned from O. Weinreich, Zum Zauber des Menstrualblutes, ARW 26 (1928) 150f. = Ausgewählte Schrift en (Amsterdam 1969–73) 2: 249f.; M.J. Schierling, Contaminant or Prophylactic?

It was widely believed that if a woman, while menstruating, walked three times round a fi eld (or a tree) barefoot and bareheaded, with her dress rolled up and loose, she would ward off plagues of caterpillars, worms and beetles; some sources specify that she had to walk round three times, and that the remedy was more eff ective if it was her fi rst period: Pliny, HN 17.266; 28.78; Aelian, NA 6.36; Columella, RR 10.357–68; 11.3.64 (citing ‘Democritus’); Palladius, Op. agric. 1.35.3; Geoponica 12.8.5f.11 In Greece there were spells specifi cally against winds, and families of practitio-ners who specialised in them; see n. 57 below.12 Making a circuit round the area to be protected marked out a barrier that was not to be crossed; cf. P.B. Fenton, Le symbolisme du rite de la circumambulation dans le judaïsme et dans l’Islam, in F. Baespfl ug and F. Dunand (eds.), Le comparatisme en histoire des religions (Paris 1997) 197–220; F.J. Fernández Nieto, Frontera como"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":" a visigothic charm from asturias 557A number of other beliefs about how to prevent storms are men-tioned by Palladius and the Geoponica, and are confi rmed, directly or indirectly, by other sources. Th ere was a belief that hail could be pre-vented by dragging a crocodile-skin (or hyena-, or seal-skin) round the property and hanging it on the door of the house or the yard when the weather looked threatening. It was also believed that a sealskin thrown over a single vine in the middle of the vineyard would be eff ective in protecting the whole fi eld.13 A second method of warding off threat-ening clouds consisted of going through the vineyard carrying a live pond- or marsh-turtle belly-up in the right hand and, on returning to the point of departure, placing it on the ground in the same position, and surrounding it with a little earth embankment so that it could not roll over and would remain on its back (and so die).14 Another recom-mendation was to present a mirror to the sky, which was supposed to throw back the image of the cloud.15 Th e Geoponica also reports how, barrera. El valor religioso y mágico del límite en la cultura griega, in P. López Barja and S. Reboreda Morillo (eds.), Fronteras e identidad en el mundo griego antiguo (San-tiago de Compostela 2001) 227–40. Th e rite of making a circuit survived in some places: when a hailstorm was imminent, the Southern Slavs would take the dining table and the tripod outside (an allegory of the harvest and the hearth), walk round them and place on the table a spoon, bread and salt, while one of the women recited a spell; cf. S. Eitrem, Opferritus und Voropfer der Griechen und Römer (Kristiania 1915) 322. 13 Palladius, Op. agric. 1.34.14f.; Geoponica 1.14 (cf. E. Fehrle, Studien zu den griechischen Geoponikern. Stoicheia 3 [Leipzig and Berlin 1920] 7–26). On the use of sealskin in another type of anti-hail phylactery, as well as leather—almost certainly from a sacrifi cial animal—see Philostratus, Heroicus 21.8 de Lannoy = 2 p. 154 Kayser (cited p. 560 n. 22 below). Seal- and hyena-skins were also believed to keep light-ning away from shipping, and sailors would place them on the mastheads (Plutarch, Quaest. conv. 4.2 [664cd]; 5.9 [684c]; cf. Pliny, HN 2.146). In the case of the seal, the ancients attributed this property not just to the idea of a hidden force, in other words, the inherent ability to reject or oppose (δύναμις ἀντιπαθής) that the skin possessed, but also to the belief that this animal was possessed in a high degree of the evil eye, cf. Detienne & Vernant 1974, 244–52. Th e concept of hidden force (which we might call internal energy) was one of the reasons advanced by Seneca, in the text already cited, to explain why blood might be able to ward off a cloud. On the ancient theory of sympathy and antipathy, see still T. Weidlich, Die Sympathie in der antiken Literatur (Stuttgart 1894); J. Röhr, Der okkulte Kraft begriff im Altertum, Philologus Supple-mentband 17.1 (1923–24) 1–133.14 Palladius, Op. agric. 1.34.14; Geoponica 1.14.8.15 Palladius, Op. agric. 1.34.15; Geoponica 1.14.4. According to Palladius, the cloud would go away because it was annoyed at its refl ection; or because it thought it was a double, and felt the fi eld was being aff ected by the new image; the second explana-tion is nearer the mark, as mirrors worked in magic as fascinating objects that laid a trap for anyone who looked at it, because they would see what they desired in it: cf. M. Meslin, Signifi cations rituelles et symboliques du miroir, in G. Piccaluga (ed.),"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"558 francisco javier fernández nietowhen such danger loomed, it could be diverted by placing keys from diff erent houses in the fi eld to be protected against hail.16 We shall be coming back to these examples later when we examine the ritual of circumambulation, as practised at Methana.2. Th e Attractions of PermanenceHowever, such ritual solutions had one big disadvantage, which was that the ceremony could not always be performed in the middle of the fi elds before the storm broke. For this reason, it was advisable to think up an alternative that could remain for long periods or permanently on the property itself. Aft er being consecrated,17 such an amulet would keep constant watch on the property and so its owner and his house-Perennitas. Studi in onore di Angelo Brelich (Rome 1980) 332–38. Alternatively, this may be an example of the force attributed to metal objects (see following note). In PGrMag IV 2298, the moon is threatened with a mirror, leaving it astonished to fi nd itself looking at itself, cf. Abt 1908, 99 [25]. However B. Kuster ap. PGrMag app. crit. ad loc. and M. Smith ap. GMPT p. 79 n. 288 each has a quite diff erent interpretation.16 Geoponica 1.14.6. Anti-hail properties were not attributed to χαλαζία or χαλαζίτης (‘hail stone’), which was so called because of its similarity to lumps of ice (Orphic Lapidary 758–61; Kerygmata 25; Pliny, HN 37.189; Solinus, Mir. 37.17; Isidore, Orig. 16.13.4). Use of a metallic object is diff erent, as there is fi rm evidence that bronze and its sound were believed to have prophylactic virtues; this is why bronze bells were used in religious ceremonies not only as a means of purifi cation but as amulets to protect people, fl ocks and harvests from the anger of the gods and their ‘messen-gers’, thought to be present in certain natural events, cf. I. Mundle, s.v. Erz, RfAC 6 (1966) 475–91. As everyone knows, during eclipses bells were rung, trumpets blown, and bronze cooking vessels beaten (e.g. Juvenal, Sat. 6.441–43; Tacitus, Ann. 1.28.2; Martial 12.57.16f.); bells placed on the hands of statues of Priapus were believed to protect orchards and gardens. Continuing with this practice, the Christian Church allowed bells to be blessed (baptised) and tolled to put demons to fl ight, calm storms and combat thunder, lightning and hail, but also to scare off witches and sorcerers. Th e idea of warding off storms by making a din with metal objects has survived into the modern period: J.G. Frazer collected relevant material from all periods and parts of the world, Folklore in the Old Testament: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend and Law (London 1918) 3: 446–80 (Part IV chap. 7). Th e rationale behind the deposi-tion of keys is that of protecting property from intruders, cf. A. Delatte, Études sur la magie grecque 4: Amulettes inédites des Musées d’Athènes, Le Musée Belge 18 (1914) 21–96 at 83f. on the ‘womb-key’.17 An item was said to be τελούμενος or consecratus when it had been invested with power. Th is was achieved either through the intervention of a deity or by ritual means: S. Eitrem, Die magischen Steine und ihre Weihe, Symbolae Osloenses 19 (1939) 56–87; H. Fugier, Recherches sur l’expression du sacré dans la langue latine (Paris 1963) 95–99. On the consecration of mirrors for magical ends, see A.

Th is solution was no doubt hit upon when the various spells cast in situ during each alarm had ‘worn off ’. Palladius, Op. agric. 1.35.1–2 describes a number of such phylac-teries: covering a grindstone with a red cloth;18 planting white bry-ony around the fi eld;19 crucifying an owl with its wings outspread;20 greasing farm tools with bear-fat. On this last, he mentions that some people kept bear fat mixed with oil with which they would grease their pruning knives, in order to protect crops from the hazards of frost and fog, and the depredations of animals; but he emphasises that it must be done in secret, so that no other pruner would know; otherwise, it 18 Metonymically the colour red evokes blood, and so can substitute for it: F. v.

On the use of a grindstone as a setting for the spell, see the Sicilian phylacteries from Noto (no. 5, p. 565f. below) and Palazzolo Acreide (no. 6). On the magical use of grindstones against inclement weather: F.J. Fernández Nieto, Un catillus de Lugo y las virtudes mágicas de las soleras y volanderas in fi nibus, MHNH 5 (2005) 343–54.19 It is not easy to see the connection that might have been established between white bryony and hail, particularly in view of the fact that this remedy is also men-tioned by Columella, RR 10.346f. as a discovery by the Etruscan, Tarcon, to ward off lightning. I feel that it might have to do with the fact that this plant was associ-ated with snakes (one of its names was ὀφέως σταφυλή or ὀφιοστάφυλον, Cyranides 1 p. 27 l. 107 Kaimakis; Dioscorides, Med. 4.182; ophiostaphyle: Pliny, HN 13.127).Moreover, both snakes and bryony were associated with fertility, a quality of the earth that the charms aimed to safeguard. Isidore, Orig. 17.9. 90, for example, mentions that the juice of bryony berries was used to restore milk to dried up breasts. I discuss the relationship between snakes and hail later, in the section on the Aïn-Fourna text (no. 4 below), and again at the end of this article. At any event, the use of certain plants in spells against storms does have modern parallels: in Vogtland (i.e. Th üring-erwald) it was believed that the well-known medicinal plant arnica (Arnica montana, one of its German names is Johannisblume), picked on St John’s eve (i.e. the day before Midsummer) and laid under the roof, hung in the parlour or at the window, or placed in the corners of fi elds, protected the house and harvests from lightning and hail; see H. Marzell, s.v. Arnika, HdA 1 (1927) 597f. with refs. Superstitions regarding the picking of bryony (on Mondays, before sunrise, under the infl uence of Jupiter and Venus) and the magic properties ascribed to it (divine; queen of the gods; mother of plants; mistress of the earth, sky and water) are noted by A. Delatte, Herbarius. Recherches sur le cérémonial usité chez les anciens pour la cueillite des simples et des plantes magiques2 (Liége 1938, repr. 1961) 33–35; 103.20 According to Columella, RR 10.348–50, who also mentions this custom, the prac-tice of crucifying nocturnal birds to prevent the sinister calls of their fellows, and ward off pests, was due to the seer Melampus, the son of Amythaon. Th e owl was believed to be able to ward off ills because of its large eyes and penetrating gaze, the eye being a powerful apotropaic, cf. R. Laffi neur, Le symbolisme funéraire de la chouette, AntCl 50 (1981) 432–44 at 437f."},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"560 francisco javier fernández nietowas ineff ective.21 Another ploy, almost certainly of Greek origin, was to tie a strip of leather round one vine, which would then protect the others.22 Here again we see the trust placed in the qualities of animal skins, which must originally have been those of sacrifi cial victims or of animals associated in myth with a god. Th e blood-stained hide of a sacrifi cial animal was charged with religious and magical power.23Th ese talismans against hail were all physically present at the place they were supposed to protect. Others however were itinerant, carried about on the person, in the belief that their power would prevent natu-ral disaster from aff ecting the health or property of the owner. Th ese were mainly stones: once duly consecrated, amethysts were believed to avert plagues of locusts, and hail (Pliny, HN 37.124); coral, wrapped in a piece of sealskin, was supposed to combat hail; likewise the stone that was known as lychnis, because it shone in the dark (Orphic Lapi-dary 271f.; Kerygmata 7).24 My real concern, however, is with the category of amulets or phy-lacteries that were both permanent and inscribed with a charm. We know from Pliny, HN 17.267; 28.29, that this was a fairly widespread custom in his day for attempting to ward off hail, and while it seems 21 Fat from a bear, a beast that embodied the wild energy of the earth, continued to be used long aft er the end of Antiquity to repel hail, by being rubbed on objects or other animals (snakes); cf. J.G. Frazer, Pausanias’ Description of Greece (London 1898) 3: 290. On the connection between snakes and hail, see Text 4 below (Aïn-Fourna) (p. 564).22 ἱμάντα . . . . περιάπτωμεν μιᾷ τῶν ἀμπέλων καὶ οὐκ βεβλήσονται αἱ λοιπαί: Phi-lostratus, Heroic. 21.8 de Lannoy = 2 p. 154 Kayser (cited by Geoponica 1.14.3).

Its effi cacy was ascribed to its occult power of rejection or opposition, a property which earned one class of coral the name ἀντιπαθές. It was taken for granted that coral pro-vided the same protection on land. Moreover, its colour is (blood-)red and its powers were reinforced by the sealskin (see n. 13 above).

Th e unnamed demon is warded off by the powers of Sabaoth, the throne of the Lord and Ufridiel, but also by the force of the “name of the cock’s egg” and by the series of the seven planets represented by the seven vowels of the alphabet. One fi nal detail is that the phylactery carefully notes the boundaries of the area that is to be protected from the fury of this daimon, beginning in the Ninth Village (the ninth mile around Phila-delphia?), and this request is complemented by a new plea, this time to the archangels Raphael, Raguel, Istrael and Agatoel, for them to “put their seal all around (περισφραγίζειν)”, so as to protect Philadelphia and its land up to the designated boundary.3230 Th e assocation between νιφαί and χάλαζα has Homeric overtones (Iliad 15.170); on Oamutha, see Preisendanz 1935, 156f.; Kotansky GMA comm. on l. 8–9 (p. 51).31 Grégoire 1922, 124ff . no. 341 ter.32 Th e daemones (or, by now, demons) must obey the divine seal. Th is theme is developed in the so-called Testament of Solomon (Migne PG 122, 1315–58). Solomon’s seal (σφραγὶς Σολομῶνος), which had been presented to the king by the archangel Michael, was made of electrum. It was inscribed with a pentagram; by virtue of its power, Solomon was able to subdue the devils and force them to build the temple. Between IVp and VIp, pilgrims to the Church at Golgotha were still shown what was supposedly Solomon’s seal (anulus, unde Salomo sigillavit demones, “by which he had enslaved the devils”). Th e Testament of Solomon is of Jewish origin, although it was rewritten by Christians; see esp. Delatte 1927, 117 l. 27; P. Perdrizet, Σφραγὶς Σολόμωνος, REG 16 (1903) 42–61; Preisendanz 1956, 670–76 and 685; Kotansky GMA 174–80; also IGLS IV no. 1289 (a stone with the name of Solomon). Gómez Moreno (1966, 101) published another previously unknown talisman of XIIp now in the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid, with a spell against hail, fog and ice, demonstrating that trust in the power of Solomon long survived: In isto circulo coli-gantur opere diabolico nubes cum grandine et nebula mala atque gelata cum ligacione diabolica cum qua religavit illo Salomon, alligo uos diabolos cum exercitu ligo uos Satan Lucifer Belial . . . alligo uos per Patrem et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum alligo.

Th e cross has two very similar Latin inscriptions, one on each side, with only slight variations between them. Date: Vp–VIIp. A comparison of the two texts reveals that this was a genuinely original spell against hail (scriptura ad grandinem). Among many strange features, the cross reproduces a sort of dialogue between a snake, bipera (= uipera) serpis, emerging from a spring or the earth itself, representing the guardian of the soil, and a diminutive man (omunculo) who can protect it from excessive rains and harm-ful hail. Th e spell confi rms its coherence from the moment that the strange being replies to the snake: ego te libero de aquas malas et de grandine mala. Th e phylactery later expressly asks for the hail to avoid the harvests, vines, orchards, crops, oak trees and olive treees, in other words the agricultural property of the owner.34Th e Aïn-Fourna text has much more of interest to off er. Th e cross has three holes that were made aft er the text was engraved, which means that it was attached to some sort of frame. Among its formulae is: ibi nata es bitis (= uitis) cum senquine (= sanguine) Christi, bring-ing up the theme of blood once again; elsewhere the owner is to stand on a spot, make a 360º turn, and repeat the exorcisms three times: ibi ista (= sta) et ingira modo ter memora.35 Almost at the end of Part I a passage from the Jardín de fl ores curiosas (Trat. 3), by Antonio de Torquemada: “It is well known that necromancers and sorcerers control devils and force them to do and carry out their will; and many of them have them tied and bound in rings and in phials and other objects, using them at will, and these demons are commonly known as familiars” (transl. from the ed. by G.

Th e charm is written out twice, with some variations, once on each side (A and B). Date: late IVp—late VIp. It is a Christian phylactery for protecting a vineyard. Although its aim is not explicitly stated, the reference in side A to an aggressive spirit referred to as θεὸς Μιχαλάζοκος (a sycopation of Μιχαήλ and χάλαζα, i.e. ‘the demon Michailer’) makes clear that it is against hail.36 Th ere are three points of interest in this text. Firstly, the invocation of Jesus Christ, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Iao, Atas, Krephiel, Amega, Neph[.]el, Phato, Edanemuel and Ameseël. Christ and a series of Christian angels are sup-ported by pagan entities and mysterious names (such as Μαμιλαφιναελ, Μυκταιλουεαμδαειε), thus clearly illustrating the agglutination of powerful names which is so evident a good in these types of charm. Th e stone was placed (probably buried) somewhere out in the vine-yard. Th e phrase ὅπου κεῖται τὸ φυλακτήριον τοῦτο makes clear that its eff ect was supposed to radiate out over the entire property. Finally, the demon ‘Michailer’ is imagined as occupying or being attracted εἰς ‘more than two’, which has been called the ‘non-dual, non-singular plural’. Some ran-dom examples: Vergil, Ecl. 8.73–77 (75: numero deus impare gaudet); Petronius, Sat. 131.5 (spitting three times; putting pebbles three times into the bosom); Pliny, HN 28.21 (repeating a formula three times); 33 (a stone or projectile that has killed three animals in three blows); 36 (cursing three times, touching three times); 44 (washing the eyes three times). Th e number nine is closely linked to three: three blows to three animals; nine knots in a thread (Pliny, HN 28.33; 48). 36 On side B it is a series of obscure demonic names (Μισουτον, Λινατον, Λοσοιο) that threaten the vineyard; and the charm aims to get them to be “expelled inside the body of the pig”."},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"566 francisco javier fernández nietoτρεῖς ὄνους, three millstones that must have been visible in the vine-yard and which perhaps marked a protective boundary that prevented the spirit from entering the plantation area.37Text 6Opisthographic clay tablet (0.31 x 0.22m) from Palazzolo Acreide (the ancient Akras), in Sicily.38 Th e text occupies all of side A and part of side B.

Th e Development of a TraditionTh e amulets against hail, with all their idiosyncrasies, dovetail perfectly with the mechanisms and techniques of magical practice as known from papyri, epigraphy and amuletic stones. Magic diff ers from reli-gion not so much in its procedures or in the miraculous nature of its eff ects but in its incompatibility with the inherited system of reli-gious ideas, because it tries to compel supernatural powers instead of off ering them adoration and reverence, in an attempt to achieve what the individual desires and avoid what he or she fears.47 However, magic can also resemble science more than religion, because magical thought is based on an almost instinctive empiricism and tries to impose order on the world. Th e more primitive and older the elements of spells or charms were, the more powerful they were deemed to be. With regard specifi cally to the charms against hail, ancient formulas and invocations may be expanded or curtailed at will, even combined with others originating from similar sources (diff erent types of exorcism, incantations, charms, curses etc.). Perhaps there was once a custom 45 In Byzantine texts, the term σημαντήριον (σήμαντρον) denotes the semantron, the bar-gong used in Orthodox churches, cf. Longo 1989, 69.46 Cf. the anti-migraine spell published by A. A. Barb, Griechische Zaubertexte vom Gräberfelde westlich des Lagers, in Römische Limes in Österreich 16 (1926) 52–67 no. 48 (expanded version in English: Antaura.

Artemis of Ephe-sus—the goddess of magic—encounters her, asks her where she is going, and exorcises her. Th e Christian versions of the amulet against the migraine demon replace Artemis with Jesus Christ or the archangel Gabriel. Christian encounter-exorcisms were circu-lated in all the languages and countries of Europe and Asia Minor, always following the basic structure: Christ, the Virgin or some angel or saint encounters the demon of a particular ailment wandering around, and orders him to stop causing harm.47 With regard to the distinction between religion and magic, of particular interest are the observations of Barb 1963, 17–19; Phillips 1986, 2723ff .; H.S. Versnel, Some Refl ections on the Relationship Magic-Religion, Numen 38 (1991) 177–97."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"570 francisco javier fernández nietoof remaining faithful to a set pattern, but in the period of which we have knowledge, they are living texts. It is thus very diffi cult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the originals of each type of charm or spell, because they were altered over time by improvisation. As a result, a more or less intelligible nucleus of themes was interwoven with mere allusions to familiar formulae, while others might be expanded in an impromptu fashion.Th e draft ing of the formulaic elements of an exorcism was governed by certain criteria. One might deploy secular references as well as sacred phrases or passages. Only one of the terms here needed to have any-thing to do with the overt aim; the text could be further enhanced by the inclusion of psalms, short phrases or indeed any fragment of a reli-gious nature. Th is freedom led to a personal emotional conditioning, such that attention came to be focused rather on the fi gurative motifs and on simple visual symbols, to the extent that the words gradually lost their meaning.48 Th e original coherence was thus lost, and power shift ed from literal meaning to the symbols or the mere sounds. In short, oral and written spells went from the intelligible to the unin-telligible. In the end the virtue of such documents came to lie in the mere recital or in their materiality, not in substantive utterance.49 All this should help us to understand the Carrio slate, which is the full-est of all surviving documents of its type, not only for the number of formulae but also for the manner in which they are distributed (with the “articulate/intelligible” interspersed with the “magic/nonsense” formulae, although they can in fact be translated). 48 I cannot resist here citing a thought by Miguel de Unamuno: “Th ose mysterious words had for us all the charm that simple, virgin, holy words have for children—that is to say, words which have no meaning” (Recuerdos de niñez y de mocedad [Madrid 1942] 46).49 Th is process was furthered by the popularity of gemstones and other objects believed to possess apotropaic powers, which were transferred to what was engraved on them; examples of gemstones with unintelligible ‘prophylactic’ inscriptions in SMA and A. Delatte and P. Derchain, Les intailles magiques gréco-égyptiennes (Paris 1964) passim. Generally on the value of the word in magical recitation, see A. Bäumer, Die Macht des Wortes in Religion und Magie (Plinius, Naturalis historia 28, 4–29), Hermes 112 (1984) 84–99; A.A.

Naming Malign PowersIn l. 10 of the Carrio slate, Satan is identifi ed (adiuro te Satan) as in control of the hail, and able to redirect it to a neighbouring settle-ment. Specifying the source of the trouble is common in phylacteries: it was an anonymous fi re-breathing δαίμων at Philadelphia (Text 3, l. 2; 5f.); the spirit known as Μιχαλάζοκος in the Noto inscription (5A), or the mysterious Μισουτον, Λινατον, Λοσοιο (5B); the devil Tartaru-cus in the lead tablet from Trogir (7); the Black Cloud ascribed human attributes in the Byzantine Christian exorcism (9). Th is is an exam-ple of the common claim that knowledge of a (divine) name bestows power.50 A magician or exorcist could dominate the will of a daemon by virtue of knowing his name. Moreover, images were analogous to names; considered as an image, the written form of the name acquired its own authority.51 In the Jewish tradition, the names of demons were inscribed on amulets so as to target them, since the angels were con-sidered to require no external authorisation to destroy them.52However, I believe that there was a deeper reason for the identifi ca-tion of the daemon (or demon) in writing. In primitive belief, storms were caused by sky-gods who controlled the weather. Zeus, Jupiter and Yahweh each had features typical of the weather gods of the ancient cultures of the Middle East and Asia Minor; they were gods who bestowed adversity as well as blessings on humans. Storms, rain, wind and hail (as well as other disasters) were taken as signs of divine anger, intended to punish man’s arrogance and off ences.53 Such gods 50 Cf. W.

Insofar as it recycled the Pentateuch, Christianity confi rmed such beliefs. However, from the Hellenistic period, and especially among Christians, natural catastrophes came increasingly to be attributed to the anger of dae-mones.54At the same time, all these cultures created images of wonder-work-ers (individuals or groups) capable of infl uencing the divine forces that generated such phenomena. Th ese fi gures, who at fi rst were supposed to possess the ability to ward off storms (including wind and hail), were gradually considered to have the power to unleash them as well.55 In this group were Zoroaster and certain other Persian magi, Moses and Abraham, the Telchines (who had the power to sterilise animals, wither plants and ruin harvests),56 Medea, Orpheus, and certain phi-losophers (e.g. Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus).57 Th e Jewish air, in its role as protector: see French 1996, 88f. nos. 5–7; in view of the similarity of the stones and their texts, French suggests that all three may have been temenos-markers at the same sanctuary.54 See esp. Clement Alex., Strom. 6.3.31; Lactantius, Div. Inst. 2.14–17 describes how angels became daemones. Th ere is a good example in the apocryphal (and very late) Mors Pilati: aft er his body had been thrown into the depths of the Tiber, “malig-nant and fi lthy spirits in his malignant and fi lthy body, all rejoicing together, kept moving themselves in the waters, and in a terrible manner brought lightnings and tempests, thunders and hail-storms, in the air, so that men were kept in horrible fear” (tr. Cox). I return immediately below to this theme.55 Th e same process occurred with regard to Christian saints; see n. 79 below. See in general, W. Fiedler, Antiker Wetterzauber.

Specialists knew more: the practitioners attacked by the author of De morb. sacr. could identify the various daemones responsible for diff erent types of ‘epilepsy’ by taking note of the precise manner of screaming or bawl-ing, the type of stool passed, whether the patient foamed at the mouth or drummed with his heels etc.60 Th e well-known lead-tablet from Phalasarna in Crete (IVª) with ἐπῳδαί lists a number of daemones (Paris 1950) 194ff .; J.H.

Specifi cally with regard to weather daemones, we may cite Riopha and Bonchar/Zonchar who controlled lightning and thunder respectively in the region of Berytus.63 As I have already intimated, the idea became rooted among Chris-tians that neither God nor His host could be held responsible for all the misfortunes in the world, but that it was other powers—the devil and his henchmen, the evil spirits—that caused disasters such as storms. Such reasoning was reaffi rmed in Judaeo-Christian legend, with parallels in Greek mythology, which claimed that the eff ects pro-duced by magic, alchemy and all occult sciences were due to daemonic beings.64 Th ese intermediaries had originally been divine, but now they were undisciplined and cursed, and their damnation infl uenced the arts that they taught.

Naming Protective PowersTh e second basic element in these spells was the invocation of the divinity responsible for preventing the disaster. Since the cause of such events was identifi ed as the will of a conscious spirit, a δαίμων, a claim that had its roots in Platonist demonology,65 the authors of the spells appropriately sought to counteract this spirit by invoking a superior being. Th is belief in turn explains why defensive or protective spirits are a constant feature of magic texts, so that Graeco-Latin amulets made use of demigods (of the sky, earth, the underworld) as well as of established daemones (Aeons, Gnostic Archons, demon-angels, stars and planets, etc.) or those who were known locally, and even sacred objects that had some magic property. In my series of anti-hail amulets, we can fi nd several such named powers: Oamuza, as a superior demon, and Abrasax as an assistant (Bouchet/Mondragon) (2); an anony-mous and mysterious diminutive man (omunculo), a local spirit (Aïn-Fourna) (4); Oreobazagra, Abrasax, Semesilam, Lorsachthê, Koriauchê and Adonai (Sidi Kaddou) (1). Th ese protective daemones, sometimes called angels, were never real gods but were ‘half-way’ between men and gods. In the fi nal instance, their effi cacy was merely borrowed from the gods, whose delegates or servants, paredroi or intermediaries they were, taking on the role of messengers or enforcers of their will.66 Over time there was also a parallel tendency to turn messenger- and oracular gods into benevolent spirits. On the other hand, the inscrip-tion from the Cilician Gates (8) invokes Hermes/Mercury not only as a divinity able to counteract evil but also apparently as mediator (deorum angelus) between devout men and the gods.In Christian spells, the function of intermediary was undertaken by the patriarchs: the names of Moses, Abraham, Jacob and Solomon were endlessly invoked on the grounds that, through their interces-sion, and with the powers they received from God, they could work miracles. At the same time, pagan demons were very quickly assimi-lated to angels, who were considered to be the ministers of God as well as a special type of supernatural being.67 Gabriel, Michael, Raphael 65 Cf.

Th e hail-texts include several examples: Atas, Amega and Fato (= Fatum ?)

Already in the second century Irenaeus vigorously denounces angelic invoca-tions and incantations: the Church nec inuocationibus angelicis facit aliquid, nec incantationibus, nec reliqua praua curiositate, sed munde et pure et manifeste orationes dirigens ad Dominum qui omnia fecit et nomen Domini nostri Jesu Christi inuocans, uirtutes ad utilitatem hominum sed non ad seductionem perfi cit.73Adv. haer. 2.32.5Th e fi rst explicit action was taken at the council of Serdica in 343 CE.74 Th e council of Phrygian Laodicea (mid-late IVp) anathematised exces-sive angel-worship, as implying idolatry, and forbade anyone in holy orders to act as a magician or enchanter, to practice astrology and to 71 On the invocation of Yahweh/Iao together with the archangels in magic see W.

Th e seven Aeons are mentioned in the apocryphal History of Joseph the Carpenter (see n. 87 below). Th e association occurs in the NT: an unclean spirit is always accompanied by seven spirits more wicked than itself (Luke 11.24–26).73 “performs nothing by means of angelic invocations, or by incantations, or by any other wicked curious art; but directing her prayers to the Lord, who made all things, in a pure, sincere, and straightforward spirit, and calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, she has been accustomed to work miracles for the advantage of mankind, and not to lead them into error” (tr.

For example, at the village of Reake in the same area, where a threatening cloud would periodically appear suddenly over the countryside and pour down hail stones upon the vineyards when the grapes were ripe, the villagers called upon Th eodore to intervene. He formed a procession of supplication, circumambulated the vine-yard and the fi elds, and, aft er off ering prayer, placed a wooden cross at the four angles of the boundary line (Vit. Th eod. 52).79Judging by the persistence of hail-texts, however, these pious rec-ommendations seem to have had a merely relative eff ect—the invoca-tion of angels in fact never disappeared from exorcisms.80 Recourse 75 Syn.

Th eodore was also capable of causing ‘righteous’ damage: in order to punish the inhabitants of Halios, who had failed to carry out his orders, he caused hail to fall on their crops (Vit. Th eod. 150, omitted by Dawes & Baynes). 80 One of the reasons for this is that highly infl uential thinkers such as St Augustine defended the value of rituals invoking angelic powers to fi ght demons. Such scenes, based on the New Testament, tended to be described with such emphasis that the people ended up believing in the actual existence of the two opposing forces as they were also depicted in magic.

And by declaring certain practices demonic, the Church underwrote popular ideas of witchcraft right up until the modern age.82 For the Christians, the pagan gods were not a fantasy of the heathen but evil demons (Abt 1908, 253). But the Church’s most consistent position is well expressed by Marcel Simon: Dans son appréciation des actes magiques, l’Église tient compte, non seulement de leur objet, mais aussi de leurs méthodes: sont condam-nables ceux qui servent à une fi n mauvaise, sans doute, mais aussi ceux qui, même dans un bout en soi louable, ou indiff érent, comme la fertilité des champs ou la santé des hommes, recourent à des procédés et à des formules que réprouve l’orthodoxie. Tout usage magique est haïssable, dans la mesure où il fait appel aux puissances mauvaises, aux démons. C’est le cas de la magie païenne ou paganisante, c’est celui également de la magie juive, ou judaïsante, sous toutes ses formes.83 Th e stress in the Carrio text on the power of angels, headed by Michael, followed by Gabriel, Cecitiel, Uriel, Rafael, Ananiel and Marmoniel, and the occlusion of daemonum nomina thus refl ects a desire to keep 81 A.-J.

For the Encratites, as well as the Marcionites, and particularly the Mon-tanists, borrowed the Jewish term ‘patriarch’ for their hierarchy of powers.86 Later it acquired a formal ceremonial value in the Church and was applied to the heads of various sees (Rome, Alexandria, Con-stantinople, Antioch and Jerusalem). It may therefore have been intro-duced into magical texts as a special invocation linking the prestige attached to the names of angels and daemones with the allure of con-demned sects.4.2. Powerful InstrumentsClosely connected with the theme of protective spirits is the question of formulae to ward off ills by appealing to (“in the name of ”) a mate-rial element, whether moveable or immoveable. Th e principle of corre-spondence operates here: if gods, wonder-workers and sorcerers used instruments to stimulate a storm and create hail and pests, then it was permissible to invoke the power of the objects which, being in contact with the guardian demons and angels, held sway over the origin of the harm. In our texts, particular emphasis is placed on God’s throne: the anonymous demon in the Philadelphia amulet (3) is exorcised in its name, and in the Byzantine formulary (9) the Black Cloud is ordered to withdraw before the “four columns that support the immovable throne of God”. Th e “river of fi re” mentioned in the same text is remi-niscent of eschatological descriptions of Hell.87In a similar vein, the Carrio text refers to God’s sceptre, ibi est meus dominissimus scetru manu, “there is the Lord (with his) sceptre (in his) 84 Cf. n. 68 above. Velázquez 1989, 507; 615 and 2004, 376f. thinks Marmoniel may be an invented name, while inclining to my suggestion (1997, 279) that Cecetiel/Cecitiel is a corruption of Sedekiel ¤ Setekiel ¤ Secetiel (through metathesis).85 Many characters from the Old and New Testaments were incorporated into the ecclesiastical annals, eventually requiring the formation of a hierarchy, known to us from Hilarius and Cyril of Jerusalem: fi rst patriarchs, then prophets and apostles, fi nally martyrs: Delehaye 1933, 95ff .86 H. Grégoire, Notes épigraphiques, Byzantion 8 (1933) 69–76. 87 Th e idea of this river, conceived as composed of molten metals, comes ultimately from the Avesta and is an element of Mazdeism (cf. F.

Th e motif of the magic wand or enchanted sceptre is of course very old.88 As we have seen, Moses used a staff to create the plagues of Egypt (n. 58 above). My Cilician text (8), which invokes Mercury to destroy locusts with his holy staff (sacrosancta uirga tua), was inscribed on the base of a statue showing the god holding it. Sol-omon too is said to have a sceptre, which he received from God. I suspect that behind the phrase meus dominissimus scetru manu in the Carrio text is a reference to the sceptre of God or the King of Israel and son of David, in the belief that it could produce miraculous eff ects thanks to its hidden, secret power (cum arte furinea).89 Moreover, the sceptre is oft en found as an attribute of deities and superior beings (angels) in pagan religions.90 It is, for example, one of the usual attributes of Men and Zeus in western Asia Minor. In this area, individual sceptres, as well as the Twelve Sceptres (οἱ δώδεκα σκῆπτρα), are regularly invoked in funerary inscriptions to protect the tomb against desecrators, the sceptre being not only a divine symbol but also, as the personifi cation of the deity, a token with magical pow-ers.91 Oaths and public curses were sworn before one; sinners acknowl-edged their faults before a god by holding one against their left side; 88 De Waele 1929, 1905–23. Homer, Od. 24.1–4 mentions the traditional view that Hermes sealed the eyes of mortals or roused them from their sleep with his staff ; Lucian, Dial. deor. 7.4 points out that Hephaestus had given the staff miraculous pow-ers (ῥάβδον τινὰ πεποίηται θαυμασίαν τὴν δύναμιν). 89 In my opinion, this section of the text goes with scetru. García Ruiz 1967, 231, followed by Velázquez 1989, 562f., suggested an adjective furineus derived from fur (in 2004, 381 she describes the passage as a locus desperatus, on the grounds that neither reading nor sense are established). I think the intended meaning is that the sceptre’s magic power was due to the fact that it had been taken (snatched) from God. In fact, underlying this is a functioning element of the old tradition of the thief god, wittily explained by Lucian, Dial. deor. 7. 3, according to whom Hermes had stolen Zeus’ sceptre when he was not looking, cf. N.O. Brown, Hermes the Th ief. Th e Evolution of a Myth (Madison 1947). Th is idea of theft would have been transferred to God’s or Solomon’s sceptre, which is why I hold that the power was “hidden and secret”.

It was this mechanism, widespread in folklore all over the world, whereby an instrument of divine origin could fall into the hands of an inferior or evil being and be manipulated, misused or defi led, which must have led to the inclusion among demonic fi gures of certain representations of the devil with a lance, standard and sceptre: cf.

Christophori 33According to Gil, the allusions to the saint in the Carrio text are directly related to its purpose, as the faithful believed that anybody who possessed a relic of St Christopher would be protected from all harm, particularly hail and agricultural pests. Th is is reasonable enough. However, I believe the true explanation lies closer to magical procedures, and provides the true justifi cation for the trust placed in the saint’s relics. In my view, the Passion of St. Christopher is evoked in the Carrio text because of the nature of the saint’s death. Th e key lies in Carrio l. 22: amputatus est caput, “his head was cut off ”—i.e. his blood fl owed to the ground. It should be remembered that formulae and supersti-tious customs had been deeply rooted in the collective consciousness for centuries. Th ey might appear to have been abandoned when in fact they had only been dormant. I would therefore suggest the following reconstruction: the ritual spilling of blood to ward off hail is attested in the earliest Greek exorcisms practised in the Peloponnese, at Kleo-nai, as we have already seen; it was probably practised in other parts of Greece, since the custom of protecting vines with a strip of leather, attested to by the Geoponica, was basically just another way of evok-ing the power of blood (in the form of the bloody hide of a sacrifi cial animal). Such traditions undeniably continued to exist in Hellenistic and Roman times, since Palladius alludes to the practice of warding off hail by brandishing bloodstained axes at the sky. Th e motif of blood could also be distorted into unrecognisability by popular superstition,"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"584 francisco javier fernández nietofor example in the red cloth covering the millstone, or ability of red coral to ward off storms and hail.97Christian phylacteries could not employ such rites; orthodoxy required formulae that respected the dichotomy between demons who are per-mitted by God to put the believer to the test, and the power of God, as delegated to His angels and saints, to ward off disasters. However, it would be naïve to think that there was no resistance to giving up practices resorted to by so many people who coexisted with Chris-tians—and by Christians themselves before they adopted the new faith; sprinkling blood on the ground had always been believed to stimulate fertility in the land.98 It was a simple matter to replace magical protec-tive blood with the invocation of the blood that Christ and numerous martyrs had shed for man. Th is step was taken at latest by Vp–VIIp, since the lead cross from Aïn-Fourna (4) includes the sequence ibi nata est bitis (= uitis) cum senquine (= sanguine) Christi immediately before the recommendation to turn round and repeat the formula of the exorcism three times. What we have here is the surreptitious per-petuation of traditional ceremonies involving blood, circumambula-tion and triplication, to protect the countryside against hail. It is highly likely that the ecclesiastical authorities were aware of this subterfuge, since they would hardly have condoned invocations to pagan demons which had been condemned by the Decretum Gela-sianum, and moved against it. Th e response was to introduce a pious passage into such exorcisms invoking the passion of the saints, with brief references to their form of martyrdom, so as to introduce the idea of blood without raising suspicion (since the word ‘blood’ does not appear as such).99 For example, before his martyrdom St Cyriacus prayed, without making any mention of blood, that hail and other ills 97 See pp. 566, 560 above.98 P. Pachis, Il signifi cato e il ruolo del sangue nei rituali del culto greco-romano, in Vattioni 1989, 261–71 at 261. 99 Th e power of St Christopher’s blood is thematised in the version of his death in the Legenda Aurea: “One of the arrows returned suddenly from the air and smote him (the King) in the eye, and blinded him. To whom Christopher said: ‘Tyrant, I shall die to-morn, [. . .] make a little clay, with my blood tempered, and anoint therewith thine eye, and thou shalt receive health.’ Th en by the commandment of the King he was led for to be beheaded, and then, there made he his orison, and his head was smitten off [. . .]. And the king then took a little of his blood and laid it on his eye, and said: ‘In the name of God and of St Christopher!’ and was anon healed. [. . .] Th e blood of the holy martyr re-established his sight, and enlumined him in taking away the blindness of his body” (§100, trans. William Caxton)."},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":" a visigothic charm from asturias 585should never occur in the area of his death: in locum autem ubi fuerit tabernaculum martyrii, non veniat grando neque mortalitas hominum nec fames nec sterilitas et daemonum incursus.100 Th e power of martyrs’ blood to defeat demons was early acknowledged, for example by Ori-gen: “Blessed be the soul of the martyr, who defeats the airborne host of demons blocking his path (to the heavenly altar) with the sight of his blood spilt in martyrdom”; and John Chrysostom: “At the sight of the blood of the martyrs, while the angels expressed great joy, demons were awestruck and the devil trembled. What was fl owing was not common blood, but the blood of salvation, holy blood, blood wor-thy of the heavens”.101 Th e purity, virtue and strength of the martyr was believed to give his blood matchless power, analogous, I would say, to the belief that the blood of pure undefi led creatures, such as foetuses or the new-born, possessed a special power.102 Th e blood of the martyrs thus replaced the older pagan forms. I believe that it is no coincidence that what are in some parts of Europe called “stone saints” (Cosmas and Damian, for example), because they have served as protection against hail right up to modern times, were always mar-tyrs who had been subjected to violent torture. Christians in fact oft en appealed to the blood of martyrs. In some cases the success of the cult was directly linked to blood: the relics of Gervasius and Protasius, for example, were well known in the western Roman world partly thanks to Ambrose of Milan, but also because of an unusual circumstance, the presence of bloodstains on their bod-ies.103 Th e blood of the martyr Euphemia, collected in her sepulchre in Constantinople with a sponge, was distributed among the people, and was also sent “over the entire earth” to any of the faithful who wanted some (Evagrius, Hist. Eccl. 2.3). Th e Christian imaginaire of the circus encouraged the belief that fruit-trees were fertilised by the blood of martyrs, and that martyrdom turned shed blood into the 100 Pass. SS.

So it should come as no surprise that both pagans and Christians vied with one another, at the moment of martyrdom, to fi ll sponges and cloths with the blood shed by the victims. It is highly probable that the sponges used by the novice gladiators (who were responsible for cutting the martyrs’ throats) to clean off the blood spattered on their bodies later became prized items for magic ceremonies and spells.105 Th e attendants of the martyr Cyprian wanted to keep his clothes, which were saturated with his sweat and blood, almost certainly in order to make use of them or sell them. Likewise the faithful strewed linen cloths (linteamina et manualia) at the spot where he was martyred.106In Christian tradition, blood was valued even when it was not that of martyrs or saints but of exemplary individuals. In the biography of Dioscorus, the patriarch of Alexandria, famous for the role he played at the Council of Ephesus in 449 CE, the following miracle was attrib-uted to him: Pendant que les serviteurs traînaient notre père, l’ongle de l’un d’eux l’égratigna à la main, et il en sortit du sang que j’essuyai avec mes mains. En sortant de chez ce misérable, je vis assis sur sa porte un homme qui avait la main desséchée. Je résolus d’essayer si notre père était arrivé à la hauteur des premiers pères qui souff rirent pour la foi orthodoxe, comme Alexandre, Athanase et les autres. J’allai près de cet homme qui avait la main desséchée et je lui dis: ‘Montre-moi ta main, tu es donc né ainsi?’. Ô grandeur des miséricordes de Dieu!, pendant que je lui disais cela comme pour l’interroger, je fi s sur la main un signe de croix avec la sang de notre saint père et cet homme cria et dit: ‘Que fais-tu en me couvrant la main de sang?’ Et aussitôt elle fut étendue aussi bien que l’autre main par la vertu de Dieu qui réside dans ses saints.Th eopistos, Histoire de Dioscore 16 in Nau 1903, 295104 R.

For example, a Christian prayer from the Church of Ethiopia links hail and blood (here, in fact, menstrual blood): “A prayer for blood and pregnancy: You who came to Damascus, Jesus Christ, who caused the power of the hail to condense, condense and stem the blood of her menstruation and open the womb of thy servant NN”.107 4.4. Disposing of IllsTh e remaining elements of the Carrio text pose no major problems. Th e formula in ll. 8–10: per montes uada et reuertam, ibi neque galus canta neque galina cacena, ubi neque arator est neque seminator semina, ub‘i’ui neq(ue) nulla nomina reson‘a’, was a well known magi-cal injunction, appearing with variations in spells aimed at banning evils to the ἐσχάτια or boundaries of human habitation, to wild and uncultivated regions. J. Gil found a Latin parallel from the Passion of St Bartholomew: uade in deserta ubi nec auis uolat nec arator arat nec umquam vox hominis resonat, which in all likelihood served as one model for the Carrio text.108 Th ere must be more to it than this, how-ever: the Byzantine Christian exorcism (9) contains a similar phrase to the Carrio text, which like it mentions the rooster (though not the hen), but its conception of silence (the absence of the semantron, i.e. the sound of the church bell) is religiously infl ected and is not a merely social one. Sequences of this kind occur in all types of apotropaic texts; indeed they seem to go back to the Indo-European horizon, as well being found in the cultural contexts of the Middle East. As Weinreich showed, it was fairly common from the Classical period to use a prayer-formula (apopompê or apagogê) to ward off imminent evils or harm-ful infl uences—sometimes personifi ed as an evil spirit—that might befall the individual himself, his family, his dwelling, his property or his land. He suggested a twofold classifi cation: the simple apopompê, 107 O. Raineri, Dan (sangue) in alcuni testi etiopici di lingue semitiche, in Vat-tioni 1989, 207–306 at 278. Another even more surreptitious way of associating blood with phylacteries against hail may have been to includes the archangel Uriel in the (optional) list of protectors. Examples are to be found both in the Noto text (5) and the Carrio slate (l. 4).108 Passio Bartholomaei 17; see Gil Fernández 1981, 176; also Velázquez 2004, 371 on ll. 8–10."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"588 francisco javier fernández nietowhich merely sought to get rid of the problem, regardless of what hap-pened to it (as long as it disappeared); and the apopompê that was linked to an epipompê, i.e. a directive to a specifi c location.109Th e second form, which is what concerns us here, was the surest and the one most likely to succeed; practitioners considered it to have the power to banish any problem that needed to be exorcised by order-ing it to go to a specifi c place. Once the spirit had departed to where it had been sent, it was given free rein to do its worst, particularly if it was to its own detriment. Th e epipompê could be directed towards the body of animals or humans, but its most widespread (and con-siderate) form banished the malignant powers to a destination where they could not harm any living being; hence we constantly fi nd them being sent to deserts, uninhabited mountains, the sea or the ends of the earth.110 In the Greek and Latin formulae, this locus has one of two identities, non-civilisation (ocean depths, deserted landscapes, wilder-nesses, where the worker neither ploughs nor sows, where there are no shepherds, no fruits or fi sh), and absolute silence (no human voice is heard, no child cries, the cock does not crow, the dog does not bark, the bronze [simandra] does not resound).111 Th e boundary crossed by the banished spirit thus separates our world from those places where everything is desolate, silent and dark, a frontier which is also a sym-bol of the separation between the living and the dead.112 Th ere is no 109 Weinreich 1929, 9–28 [175–94].110 Telling the threat to go ἄχρις ̔Υπερβορέων, “to the land of the Hyperboreans” was merely a variant on τέρματα γαῖας: Weinreich 1929, 20 [186].111 On the workings of the apopompê and its expressions in the East, Greece and Rome, as well as its manifestations in the mediaeval and modern era, see O.

Th is view is reinforced by a recently-published text found in Fuente Enca-lada (Zamora), also written on slate and of roughly the same date as the Carrio text.114 Th is is the transcription suggested by the editors:[--]incib[--][--vir]gine mi[--][--]nolis ra[--][--]sunt supe[r--] 5 [--]m≥i≥na≥[.]d≥ul[.]ro[--][--]s cuis matris fue≥[.]o[--][--]eleison transeat[..]per tra[nsea--][--]triades uadas et ibi uadas ubi nec ais [uolat nec arator arat    nec    unquam][--n]u≥la uox ominum resonantur[--]10 [--Pat]er et Filiu[s] et S(piritus) S(an)c(tu)s ab fe[--][--]milia numerum uakarum[--][--]d≥o≥tare uolunt ut[--][--]equineisne (quingenta) [--][--]amen[--]15 [--](signum)[--]Granted that the (abbreviated) apopompê formula in ll. 8f. indicates that this is a spell against unfavourable weather,115 I incline to think that it is aimed at storms in general, not specifi cally against hail.

Th e main value of the Fuente Encalada text in the present context is aft er all simply to reinforce the claim that the apopompê formula was still current in Visigothic Hispania in VIIIp.4.5. ClosureTh e repetition of the sacred invocations featured in the fi nal part of the Carrio amulet (ll. 26f.) is a common device. Th e exorcistic value of the Hebrew words amen and alleluia was highly prized in the late-Roman period.116 Amen also acquired an aura of prestige as a magic fi gure, as the isopsephic equivalents of its Greek letters (α+μ+η+ν) add up to 99 (1+40+8+50). In fact, the pagans adopted the expression too.117 I have already referred to triple repetition of a word or an action in spells (n. 35 above). Th e Aïn-Fourna phylactery (4) has two combinations (see p. 565 above): on side I it links agios (three times), emen (twice) and alleluia (twice), adding up to the magic number seven; on side II, agios (three times), emen (three) and alleluia. Th e sequence we fi nd in the Carrio text (amen, amen, per semper amen + alleluia) is probably a shortened form or the fi nal part of a longer sequence. Th e invoca-tion of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit also features on the Aïn-Fourna cross and comes, in both cases, just before the series of Hebrew words.4.6. SymbolsPentagrams feature in the exorcism, but need no detailed discussion. In magic texts, star signs or the invocation of cosmogonic and planetary spirits were aimed at evoking the omnipresent forces of the universe in the spell. In material form, through either a drawing or written refer-ence, they served to attract natural powers to the drawn symbols and were supposed to bring planetary infl uences to bear on the ceremony. Th e fi ve-pointed star, known as the pentagram, was one of the astral symbols originating from the east that were highly appreciated in reli-gion and magic; the partiality for it felt by Christian talismans, shared only by the chi-rho symbol, is due to the previously-mentioned fact that the pentagram enjoyed enormous prestige as protection because it 116 H.

Maintaining Eff ectivityBefore I conclude, I just should note one further feature that the Carrio slate shares with other analogous spells, namely the manner in which the item is displayed or mounted. We have already seen that, by con-trast with improvised rituals performed when storms were imminent, ‘prophylactic’ inscriptions against harm were designed to be located where they could constantly take eff ect. It is clear that some of these talismans were nailed to a support that was visible within the property; these include the phylacteries on metal that still have the corresponding perforations: the bronze tablet from Bouchet (2), the lead cross from Aïn-Fourna (4) and the lead tablet from Trogir (7). A second group is made up of the inscriptions on stone, also left out in all weathers, which were presumably placed on elevations overlooking the land: this was the case with the exorcism from Philadelphia, Lydia (3) and the statue-base dedicated to Mercury from the Cilician Gates (8). But it is the third group that mainly concerns me here: the spells designed to remain hidden. Th e most noteworthy example is the Sidi Kaddou text (1), which ends by asking the gods to protect the estate’s produce for as long as the stones bearing their sacred names are buried around it. Th e writers of the exorcism evidently buried several such stones—a minimum of three, in order to mark an area—on the boundaries of the property.120 Th e Sicilian phylacteries found at Noto (5) and Palazzolo 118 P.

From very early times, the Church, following the hints in the Gospels (Jesus calming the elements), had tolerated ceremonies to ward off hail and other agrarian disasters by sanctioning the use of prayers, phylacteries, sacred symbols such as the cross, and saints’ relics. Th e Christian emperors declared that the quest for remedies against rain and hail was not a crime, as they were designed not to harm people but to safeguard the work of farmers.122 A similar measure was decreed by Chindasuinth (642–53) (Lex Visigoth. [Chind.] 6.2.4).Th ere were, I think, several reasons for burying such texts. It is per-fectly natural that a phylactery to safeguard crops should be entrusted to the land itself. Interment also served to transmit the intrinsic force of the spell directly to the property indicated. Moreover, it seems that burial was not random: the phylactery acted as a barrier against the scourge and protected all the crops growing inside a notional area. I have already remarked on the importance of ritual circumambula-tion with an apotropaic object; in the case of the turtle, it was then fi xed (half-buried) at the starting out point; when an animal skin was used, it was hung up. I take it that texts such as the clay tablets from 121 Caracalla went so far as to condemn to death anyone who used magic talismans to protect themselves against malaria (HA, Vit. Carac. 5.7). Constantius II came down harshly on all types of magical practices, including inoff ensive ones, and under Val-entinian I and Valens show trials were held for alleged black magic practices and all acts of witchcraft were remorselessly prosecuted, as were the owners of books of devil-worship: J. Maurice, La terreur de la magie au IVe siècle, RHD 6 (1927) 108–120; Barb 1963, 126–38; Phillips 1986, 2718–20; Brashear 1992, 155 n. 21.122 E.g. the ruling of Constantine I in 321/4 [317–19 Seeck]: . . . nulli uero crimina-tionibus inplicanda sunt remedia humanis quaesita corporibus aut in agrestibus locis, ne maturis uindemiis metuerentur imbres aut ruentis grandinis lapidatione quateren-tur, innocenter adhibita suff ragia, quibus non cuiusque salus aut existimatio laederetur, sed quorum profi cerent actus, ne diuina munera et labores hominum sternerentur (CTh . 9.16.3). Th is law was reiterated by Th eodosius II in 438 and then again by Justinian in 529 (CJ. 9.18.4)."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":" a visigothic charm from asturias 593Noto (5) and Palazzolo Acreide (6), as well as, no doubt, the Carrio slate, which were one-off talismans with no copies made, would fi rst have been taken in procession around the area to be protected, before being covered by a layer of earth. Th e Carrio phylactery in fact shows every sign of having been delib-erately buried. As Gómez Moreno noted, the slate comprises two unequal parts that need to be joined together to be read; it was split from top to bottom by a single blow; and both parts were drilled through in their upper sectionsbefore they were written on. Th e text completely fi lls up one of the sides, which is fairly fl at, but rough-surfaced, with hardly any space between the lines. In the hole there is still a piece of iron nail that kept the two surfaces together, so that it could not be read until it was removed. Th is was how it was discovered by chance below the ground, no one knows how, in 1926 by some farm labourers in Carrio, a small locality near Villayón, on the western edge of Asturias.123Th e custom of dividing a text into two and placing the two inscribed areas face to face is very occasionally found with defi xiones.124 Th e ritual of placing the two inscribed faces together is thus common to both types of document, just like that of piercing the text with a nail, but the value of the procedure is diff erent in each case: the defi xio is intended to attract spirits from the netherworld, the phylacteries to drive them away.In fact, several types of nail have survived, some of them decorated, strangely enough, with images of snakes.125 I am tempted to link these items with the burial of phylacteries, since that might help to explain the mysterious interlude in the cross from Aïn-Fourna (4), which features a sort of dialogue between a snake (vipera serpis), which many people considered as embodying the fertility of the land, and a diminutive man (omunculo) who can protect it from excessive rains 123 Gómez Moreno 1966, 95. See also the drawing in Velázquez 2004, 370.124 Th e only Latin example is in fact the IIa lead diptych from near the Porta Stabi-ana at Pompeii, one of the earliest known defi xiones in Latin, found bound together by means of a leaden band: CIL I2 2541 + p. 844 = IV 9251 = ILLRP 1147 = Solin, Ostia no. 39. In other cases, such as the Emporion curses discussed by Marco Simón elsewhere in this volume (p. 399), the Praunheim/Frankfurt defi xiones against the adversaries of Sextus (AE 1978: 545–46), and the four late-Roman texts from Bologna against the doctor Porcellus (García Ruiz 1957 nos. 5–8), similar texts were for some reason written out at least twice on diff erent sheets of lead, but not split and not closed together as in a diptych/writing tablet.125 Cf.

Miscellaneous ConsiderationsTh ere are still a few odd points to clear up. Th ere is, for example, the term nonia in l. 1. Gómez Moreno suggested that the word might refer to some form of levy or tax, and in the absence of any other theory, this suggestion has been repeated by others.128 But what is a levy doing in the spell, and why should it be something the author of the text has received? I suspect rather that nonia, which must be connected with the idea of ‘nine-fold’, denotes some element in the exorcism that was deemed necessary to make it eff ective. As Sauvaget puts it: “Th ere are texts that were written in such a way as to express themselves in the name of the very object in which they were read; they were always in the fi rst person singular, as is logical, and the inscribed medium was considered to speak exclusively in its own name, not in the name of all its counterparts”.129 If that applies here and the subject of recepi is the phylactery itself, the text could be indicating one of four possibilities: a) that before it was buried, a ritual had been held to take the spell to the ninth circuit, that is the farthest boundary of the area to be pro-tected; b) a ritual involving nine circuits of the area; c) the rite of recit-ing the spell nine times (in other words, three times three)—recall the ingira modo ter memora of the Aïn-Fourna spell (4); or d) the ritual of 126 Th ere are other links between snakes and anti-hail spells, see n. 21 above.127 In fact, these nails might also have been used in defi xionum tabellae. Indeed, since very early times, serpents were considered domestic, oracular and apotropaic animals, as were evil demons, cf. Preisendanz 1935, 162f.; F. Heichelheim, s.v. Tierdä-monen, RE 6A (1936) 862–931 at 873, 900, 913.128 Gómez Moreno 1966, 97; also García Ruiz 1967, 232; Velázquez 1989, 563 and 615. In Velázquez 2004, 375 she accepts the interpretation in Fernández Nieto 1997, 286 n. 84, partly repeated here, though I now incline to the view that nonia = nenia.129 J. Sauvaget, Flocons à vin ou grenades à “feu grégeois”, in J. Moreau (ed.), ΠΑΓΚΑΡΠΕΙΑ. Mélanges Henri Grégoire.

However, a much simpler solution is also possible, namely that the form nonia is a badly-written or phonetic variant of nenias. It is fairly common knowledge that nenia denotes not only a funeral chant delivered at burials but also magic recitation and chanting (Horace, Epod. 17.29; Ovid, Ars 2.102; Fasti 6.142, all using the stock phrase nenia Marsa). If this were the case, the Carrio text would merely be certifying that all the stages of the text had been solemnly recited, in the manner of a funeral chant, and that therefore its power had been activated (consecrata).I also suspect that the mention of a cemetery in ll. 6 and 24 is not a coincidence and may be due to the irrepressible desire to associate the invocation with such a place, the coemeterium being commonly held to be the appropriate place for magical practices (Longo 1989, 20f.). G. Charrière cites a procession in rural France organised on the feast of St John in which the participants, bearing lighted torches, visited the cemetery attached to the chapel (the ceremony having replaced the cult of Mars Sutugius); there they would each lay their fl aming brands on the family tomb, but some would take them home, in the belief that this would ward off evil. However, from my point of view, the most remarkable aspect of this ceremony is that the embers of the pyres burnt that day were thought to act as protection against lightning and hail and to serve to purify the fi elds, expel evil spirits, fertilise the soil and keep the crops from disaster.130 Th e ancient connection between anti-hail amulet (i.e. the embers) and cemetery is here plain.I should like to off er one fi nal observation with regard to ll. 10–12, where Satan is rejected in the name of Jesus Christ, qui te licuit in Cirbes ciuitate. Both Velázquez and Díaz translate this as “who banished (or confi ned) you to the city of Cirbes”, taking licuit = liquit (reliquit).131 An alternative would be to take licuit as a transitive form of liquesco (fuse, melt), with the support a passage of the Aïn-Fourna text (4) that I have already twice mentioned, namely the ‘dialogue’ between the 130 G. Charrière, Feux, bûchers et autodafés bien de chez nous, RHR 194 (1978) 23–64 at 24. In certain parts of Europe processions with lighted torches were con-ducted through the fi elds to protect them from lightning and hail: S.

Eine Geschichte des Amulettwesens (Stutt-gart 1927) 129. 131 Velázquez 2004, 369, 372 and 379, reading plicuit, translates “because he shut you up in the city of Cirbes” and off ers no comment on the passage."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"596 francisco javier fernández nietosnake and the omuncio. Here it seems that the function of the snake is to “fuse” or “dissolve” the visitor (ut solberet te = ut solueret te). I have argued elsewhere that this implies the gnostic and alchemical notion of an homunculus or ἀνθρωπάκιον, notably in the work of Zosimus of Panopolis.132 I would argue that there was a tradition in the Mediter-ranean area that phylacteries against hail might contain an historiola involving the dissolution of an evil being. Th e development refl ected in the Carrio slate would have involved giving Satan the leading role in the episode, following a Christian pattern developed much earlier for other types of spells. Th e apocryphal gospels suggest the reason. Th e early medieval Acts of Pilate tells the famous story of Christ’s descent to the underworld and the condemnation of Satan: Et ecce Dominus Iesus Christus ueniens in claritate excelsi luminis man-suetus, magnus et humilis, catenam suis deportans manibus Satan cum collo ligauit, et iterum a tergo ei religans manus resupinum eum elisit in tartarum, pedemque suum sanctum ei posuit in gutture, dicens: Per omnia saecula multa mala fecisti, ullo modo non quieuisti; hodie te trado igni perpetuo . . . Et demersus est in profundum abyssi.133 Acta Pilati, Latin B version, VIII [XXIV]However that may be, whichever meaning we accept for licuit in the Carrio text, “banish, leave, confi ne” or “fuse, dissolve”, I believe that the setting for Christ’s action there is hell, and that the expression in Cirbes ciuitate denotes “the city of Cerberus” as a metonym for Hades, where Christ banished Satan for all eternity.134 Th e name given to Hell in the Greek version of the Acts of Pilate is indeed Hades (ὁ ῞δης). 132 Alfaro Giner & Fernández Nieto 2000, 1585–1587. Th e omuncio would end up being thrown into the fi re and devoured by it, which was reminiscent of the copper sheet which would have been turned into gold if it was suitably treated in the fi re in which it was melted.133 “And behold Lord Jesus Christ coming in the glory of heavenly light, kindly, great and humble, bearing in his hands a chain. He bound Satan by the neck, and his hands behind his back, and pushed him in the direction of Tartarus; he set his holy foot on his head saying: ‘You have done great wrong for all the ages, and have never ceased from it; today I hand you over to the eternal fi re . . . and plunged him into the depths of the Abyss.” For guttur = head rather than mouth, see Souter, Glossary s.v.134 From an abbreviated form of the Latin Cerberos/Cerberus (Κέρβερος) it is a short step to Cerbes/Cirbes (with perhaps iotacism coming into play?)."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":" a visigothic charm from asturias 5977. ConclusionTh e Carrio text thus constitutes the fi nal link in the long line of ancient Christian phylacteries against hail, confi rming the idea that magic is one of the areas in which a discontinuous tradition can most clearly be traced.135 Like all the other surviving texts, it employs mechanisms and formulae drawn from various strands of the religious syncretism of the ancient Mediterranean. It preserves pagan beliefs and themes beneath the appearance of Christian piety, combining them haphazardly with invocations permitted and recommended by the Church. Neverthe-less, with regard to the length and density of the formulae, and the restrained use of signa, it has a claim to be the most typical and com-plete of all surviving ad grandinem texts. One might fi nd fault with its carelessness and obscurity, but, as I have stressed, logical order and meaning are secondary to sonority and magical resonance. We can surely detect here the hand of a well-to-do, far from unsophisticated Christian landowner, perhaps a priest, fully cognisant of the models inherited from the Late Empire, the phylacteries still in use in every province. It is, in short, an excellent example of the classical heritage in Visigothic culture, which extended to the farthest reaches of the Iberian Peninsula. My aim in producing this commentary has however been to explore the entire tradition of phylacteries against hail, and the mentality that made their production a meaningful enterprise. It was Angelo Brelich, one of the great practitioners of the history of reli-gions, who urged us to investigate not only what a magical/religious element means, but also, and above all, why the people who created and preserved it said the things they did.136135 Barb 1963, 143. It should be remembered that the fi gure of malefi ci or inmis-sores tempestatum, which we have briefl y touched on in this article, was perpetuated in Galician culture, giving rise to nubeiros, tronadores, tronantes, escoleres and legru-mantes (negrumantes); I recently devoted an article to this topic: F.J. Fernández Nieto, El maravilloso guía de Borrow en el viaje al Finisterre, in A. Rodríquez Casal (coord.), Humanitas. Estudios en Homenaxe ó Prof. Dr. Carlos Alonso del Real (Santiago de Compostela 1996) 285–96. In late-antique Gaul it was widely believed that there were people able to cause hail and thunder at will, and that other sorcerers could prevent these disasters through counter-spells. Agobard of Lyon wrote a treatise claiming to refute such beliefs, cf. F. Bonnhölzl, Geschichte der lateinischen Literatur des Mittelal-ters, 1.

IntroductionIt is commonplace nowadays to observe that the dividing line between religious belief or public and private displays of faith on the one hand and ‘superstition’ or magical praxis on the other is oft en subjectively indistinct and in daily life easily crossed. In practice there is a con-tinuum between understanding the theoretical side of a religion and conforming to its regular or established forms of worship, and all the many ways in which people, either individually or as groups, believe that they can approach a deity to ask for particular favours they require. Th e diff erence between praying to ask for a favour and believing that prayers can be used to put pressure on a divinity (be it a god, an angel, a denizen of the Underworld, or any other type of being believed to be superior to humans) is sometimes hard to make out; hence the fact that some, both in the past and now, have been convinced that they could call up spirits and obtain what they wanted either through their intervention, or—indirectly, through intermediaries—that of God.

Some pas-sages in the present paper are taken directly from the fi rst of these. My refl ections here form part of a broader study which, under the rubric of the mode of dissemination of religious beliefs, attempts to link a number of Visigothic inscriptions with a variety of contemporary literary (religious) texts. I used the Spanish translation by J.L. Calvo Martínez and M.D. Sánchez Romero, Textos de magia en papiros griegos (Madrid 1987), but all the translations in this version of my text have been revised from those of Preisendanz and Daniel & Maltomini.

Th is amounted to a syncretism of the kind prevalent in Europe in the mediaeval period (indeed up to the Counter-Reformation) and which can be found in all periods of Christian contact with exotic peoples.5 Such practices were oft en frowned on by bishops, who prescribed measures to try and correct what they felt were deviations from the faith, without taking them seriously enough to claim them as genuine heresies or deviant worship. Th ey amounted in practice to the simplifi cation and vulgari-sation of Christian beliefs, and the transformation of certain public or private religious practices into instrumental rites. Liturgical formulae served as models for prayers used outside the sphere of the church, being converted into words of power and standard invocations for a variety of private ends.6I see two main processes at work here. One is the eff ort made to communicate complicated orthodox concepts and theological issues to the laity, in Spain notably the work of Martin of Braga, which had the 2 I do not intend to address the theoretical issue of the possible diff erences between magic and religion in the ancient world, or any other wider issue regarding the term magic. I use the term simply for convenience, equivalent to ‘instrumental religion’.3 Th e Sueves were converted to Catholicism from c. 560 through the eff orts of Martin of Braga (Bracara Augusta in Galicia), a Greek-speaking Pachomian monk: E.A. Th ompson, Th e Conversion of the Spanish Suevi to Catholicism, in James 1980, 77–92; some correctives to his excessive scepticism e.g. over Chararic, in A. Ferrero, Braga and Tours: Some Observations on Gregory’s De virtutibus sancti Martini (1.11), JECS 3.2 (1995) 195–210.4 Th e towns were mainly inhabited by Goths, together with Hispano-Roman offi -cials and the still extremely wealthy aristocrats, cf. P. Heather, Th e Goths (Malden and Oxford 1996) 276–98. Quite apart from the spread of a tied peasantry (the colonate), the decline of towns in the fourth century and aft er, to the benefi t of the major villa production-centres, naturally encouraged the persistence of rural syncretism.5 For the pre-modern period in Europe, see Wilson 2000; exotic peoples, e.g. the case of the Jesuit mission to China: L.M. Brockey, Journey to the East: Th e Jesuit Mis-sion to China, 1579–1724 (Cambridge MA 2008).6 For this phenomenon in Late-Roman Hispania, see Sanz Serrano 2003.

Th e second is the role of parochial schools and church read-ers (lectores), and more broadly the catechumenate, in communicat-ing both a certain familiarity with liturgical and Biblical texts, mainly through rote learning, together with a degree of literacy.7 Phrases derived from offi cial practice, or prayers learnt by heart, provided a stock of material charged with the authority of the Church, which could be used instrumentally to re-empower the age-old services of protection and revenge traditionally off ered by magical practice. Th e dividing line between belief and ‘superstition’ could easily be crossed, and amount to deviation from orthodox practice, or what at any rate might be found deviant by the religious or civil authorities responsible for controlling and directing religious practice.8In some, perhaps even many, areas of the Late-Roman world, the authors of Christian magical texts, notably those in Coptic, frequently included literati, among them no doubt priests, deacons and monks. “Th e oft en sophisticated adaptations of [Judeao-Christian] myth [in Coptic magical texts] show that so-called magical texts had fi rm roots in literary culture”.9 In Visigothic Spain, I would argue, it was the 7 On literary culture and literacy in Visigothic Spain, which boasted an extraordi-nary effl orescence in VIp, aft er the death of Martin, see the recent synthetic accounts by Collins 1990 and 2004, 147–73; on the education available to the diff erent ranks of clergy, Martín Hernandez 1988, 196–99. One of the canons of the fi rst council of Braga in 563 specifi cally declares that nihil poetice compositum in ecclesia psallatur apart from the Psalms and selected passages of the OT and NT (§12, de canonicis scripturis). On the other hand, the main canon of the second Council in 572 (§1) suggests that many priests and catechumens were more or less ignorant of Catholic doctrine; on the latter, it declares: ante dies viginti baptismi ad purgationem exorcismi catechumeni currant, in quibus viginti diebus omnino catechumeni symbolum, quod est Credo in Deum Patrem Omnipotentem, specialiter doceantur, “the catechumens are to go to be purifi ed by adjuration three weeks before baptism; during this period they are specifi cally to be taught the Creed”.8 Obviously, within any given society, individual practices might be considered by one group as manifestations of faith, but by another as magic, superstition or vain falsehoods; on the use of these terms as boundary markers in antiquity, note A.F.

Looking from the other side, we could just as well term it selective appropriation: the indigenous magical tradition, including literati and thus members of the clergy, selected those aspects of simplifi ed Christian belief that best fi tted its needs. Whereas in the past magical practitioners (outside the Graeco-Egyptian tradition) and individuals seeking revenge, success or justice had had to fi nd authority where they could, oft en through appeal to local deities, the institutionalised authority of the Church off ered a unifi ed and powerful textual resource across the whole range of soci-ety. In my view these two aspects have not been taken suffi ciently into account when analysing the persistence of ‘paganism’ in Late-Roman Christianity, but rather dismissed as marginal, even obvious, consider-ations. In the fi nal instance, however, I believe that they jointly under-pinned the continuation into the late Visigothic period of the custom of creating magical texts, whether defensive or aggressive.2. A Continuing Tradition of Magical PracticeSuch texts are the most easily accessible representatives of practice on the frontier between orthodox belief and ‘superstition’, on the fi ne line between what was permitted and what was proscribed, between offi cial ritual and illicit imperative. As I have argued elsewhere,10 they repre-sent widely-distributed cultural forms, inasmuch as such rituals were known, and performed, throughout society, regardless of the social status of the individuals involved. Protective phylacteries and amulets were widely used; virtually everyone believed in the potential power of magical texts or properly invested sacral objects to accomplish the ends envisaged. Although texts such as the ensemble from Porta S. Sebastiano at Rome were composed by professionals,11 the ideas they used were much more wide-spread: magical rituals, including written texts, were a constituent of the cultural heritage of the Late–Roman period; inasmuch as it carried over from the earlier Empire not merely 10 See n. 1 above.11 R.

One of the canons (§6) drawn up in this connection is revealing not only because it tacitly acknowledges the effi cacy of curses but also in its attempt to suggest that the Christian God cannot be held responsible—the effi cacy of curses is a matter of idolatry, i.e. involves the worship of other (i.e. pagan) divinities:Si quiquumque per malefi cium hominem interfecerit. Si quis uero male-fi cio interfi ciat alterum, eo quod sine idolatria perfi cere scelus non potuit, nec in fi nem inpertiendam esse illi communionem.17Th e second council of Braga (572 CE), evidently following much the same source as that used by Martin of Braga in De correctione rustico-rum 16 (to which I return below), decreed specifi c prohibitions against protective magical practices to drive away ills, purifi cations and lus-trations (§71), performing incantations, “following the course” of the sun, the moon or the stars (i.e. observing ‘superstitions’ connected with the heavenly bodies, as in iatromagical practice) (§72), keeping the Vulcanalia and the Kalends as special days, laying greenery all round the house (§73), using incantations when collecting medicinal herbs (§74), chanting ‘magical’ formulae while weaving woollen cloth (§75).18 Virtually all of these can be documented in earlier literature (López Pereira 1996/1997, 55–67).diuinandi curiositas (Milan 1990); M.-Th .

We usually fi nd a simple substitution of powers invoked: pagan deities are replaced by angels, saints and biblical characters give added weight to requests. A good example of the fi rst is provided by a defi xio from Rome (IVp), which asks the holy angels to infl ict on the victim the immobility and silence proper to the souls of the dead, using formulations common in pagan Greek and Latin defi xiones:Deprecor uos sancti angeli ut quomodo ec anima intus inclusa tenetur et angustiatur et non vede neque lumine ne aliquem refrigerium non habet, sic ut anima mentes corpos Collecticii quem peperet Agnella teneatur ardeat, detabescat usque ad infernum semper ducite Collecticium quem peperet Agnella.19I earnestly entreat you, holy angels, that, just as this departed is held fast and confi ned in the grave, and sees no light at all, and has no means of getting cool, so may the spirit, consciousness and physical body of Collecticius, son of Agnella, be held fast—let him burn, let him sicken! Carry off Collecticius, son of Agnella, to the Underworld for good!Sometimes (as here), the surviving texts contain no clear identify-ing feature(s) that allow(s) their author defi nitely to be identifi ed as a Christian; in these cases we can only work on the basis of date, prov-enance and context. Th is is because there was a relatively determinate set of generic rules for writing such texts, either local rules, as in the case of the ‘prayers for justice’ from Bath and Uley in Britain, which nevertheless bear a family resemblance to a much wider range of texts from western Asia Minor and mainland Greece,20 or, as in the case of texts in the Graeco-Egyptian tradition, models provided by written 19 AE 1941: 138, orig. publ. by N.

Th ese generic rules—never closely applied and always open to individual choice and preference—continued to be followed, though increasingly loosely, into Late Antiquity; if angels, demons or saints are not specifi cally invoked, or if there are no Christian symbols such as crosses or other iconographic features, the religious orienta-tion of the authors of defi xiones, phylacteries or apotropaic texts writ-ten in this period must remain indeterminate.At the same time, we should allow for the continuity of underlying attitudes and feelings, the persistence of a certain mind-set or tradi-tion.21 Spontaneous coincidence of expression, similar to that found in casual graffi ti, texts on instrumenta, even in funeraries,22 may some-times be the best explanation. Normally however we may assume that recurrent ideas are the expression of traditions cultivated throughout the Empire, witnesses to a shared instrumental-religious culture of great antiquity that persisted throughout the Late-Roman period.

Th e Simplifi cation of Christian IdeasHaving pointed to the existence of a continuing mind-set in which instrumental-religious practice had an important place, I can now turn to the claim that, at any rate in Hispania, it was Christian catechists who unintentionally provided the simplifi cations of Christian concepts that helped give Christian magic its specifi c shape. Here I have space only to adduce, by way of illustration, the evidence of a well-known work by Martin of Braga, De correctione rusticorum, written in the later sixth century under the inspiration of Augustine’s De catechizan-dis rudibus, and itself part of a much wider ‘pastoral’ eff ort to reach out to the population of the hinterland of the urban settlements.31 As Bishop of Braga and president of the second council held there in 572 (see above), Martin was in a position to push through various canons that reveal the Church authorities’ continuing anxieties about the persistence of paganism, usually called superstitio. Th e (nominal) background to the tract is that Bishop Polemius of Astorga had asked Martin to write about the origin of the pagan gods and their wicked deeds (scelera). Th e aim was to help focus Polemius’ eff orts to get the country-folk to give up their pagan beliefs and practices: pro castigatione rusticorum, qui adhuc pristina paganorum superstitione detentes cultum uenerationis plus daemoniis quam deo persolvunt (Corr. rust. 1.1).32 Martin explains that it would be advisable to present them with a basic idea of Christianity beginning with the creation of the world, in order to catch their attention, but that it would need to be brief and in simple language:31 Recent eds. include: Sermón contra las supersticiones rurales, ed.

I have used the text and section-numbering proposed by López Pereira, which incorporates the readings of the additional mss. adduced by Naldini with some further suggestions. Th ere is an English tr. in C.W. Barlow, Iberian Fathers, 1: Martin of Braga, Paschasius of Dumium, Leander of Seville. Fathers of the Church n.s. 62 (Washington 1969).

On the other hand, the story of God’s creation of the world and of how paganism originated—the pagan gods are of course identifi ed with fallen angels, demons—, of redemption through Christ and the recommendation to live a good Christian life are indeed presented in a simple manner. It is in fact a catechetical work,35 with descriptions of superstitions that make it particularly interesting for the study of pagan survivals.36 Th e remainder is taken up with advice on how to instil the true faith in Christians, and convince them that the only genuinely powerful signa are those of the Church.In the present connection however what mainly interests me about De correctione rusticorum is its tendential simplifi cation of Christian ideas. Given the situation, the need to address people who, living in the countryside in their ancestral settlements, while nominally catholic nevertheless still also believed in pagan deities, in ‘demons’, observed unorthodox practices, and were moreover quite uneducated, without 33 “But because (I thought it) best to off er them an account so fi tted to them that it would take their fancy, I had to sketch out a vast extent of past ages and events in a brief compass, and give the country-dwellers their sustenance in language familiar to them.” 34 Cf.

Other demons inhabited the natural world, the sea, the rivers, springs and woods, and demanded worship there, as Neptune, Lamias, nymphs and Dianas.39 Th e simpli-fi ed story about the origin of the false gods had to allow that they had once indeed existed, and might well still exist.Martin later introduces another potentially misleading comparison by putting the sign of the Cross and central formulations of Chris-tian belief on the same semiotic level as various demonic ‘signs’ 37 Th e second Council of Braga envisages the bishop deliberately allocating time to himself teaching congregations the elements of Christian belief and morality (canon §1).38 “Th en the Devil and his henchmen, the demons, cast out from heaven, realising that humans were ignorant because they had abandoned their Creator and were wan-dering about among the other creatures, began to reveal themselves to them in diff er-ent shapes, held conversations with them, and required them to off er them sacrifi ce on high mountains and in leafy forests, and to worship them instead of God.”39 Th ere are still thirty-two toponyms in the Basque area containing the name Lami-; they seem to have been local riverine deities, similar to Nymphs: López Pereira 1995, 59f."},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"614 isabel velázquez soriano(i.e. divinatory signs), simply claiming that the former is holy and the latter are wicked:Dimisistis signum crucis, quod in baptismum accepistis, et alia diaboli signa per avicellas et sternutos et per alia multa adtenditis . . .

By the same token, anyone who accepts formulae concocted by magicians has abandoned the formula of the sacred sacrament and the Sunday utterance, which he accepted as a Christian, and spurned Christianity, in that it is not possible to worship both God and the Devil.”41 Augustine, whose infl uence on the Christian concept of superstitio is incalcula-ble, treated it as an aspect of his theory of signs. Since he distinguished simply between natural and conventional signs, he was forced to treat pagan signs as comparable to Christian ones, albeit superfl uous or even malefi cent (e.g. Doctr. christ. 2.20)."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":" between orthodox belief and ‘superstition’ 615number of Jewish words of power, such as the names of God, of angels and archangels, and of one or two patriarchs such as Abraham, and indeed in one or two cases show a far greater indebtedness to Jew-ish magical practice (especially exorcism).42 Th ey are also suggestive concerning the means by which Biblical passages and sentences from the Old as well as the New Testament were absorbed into magic for-mulae.

Th e tendency today is to treat them as evidence of “sound and vibrant lay religiosity”.47 Nevertheless, there is oft en a fi ne line between the fervent plea by a Christian driven by his faith, and the belief that he can achieve his aims by using procedures that border on superstition. Texts against storms and other natural disasters are espe-cially likely to contain a mixture of pagan and Christian elements.48Th e rhetorical emphasis of such documents is placed less on God and Christ, though of course they are frequently invoked, than on Judaeo-Christian angels. Just as the practitioner’s authority was dem-onstrated in the Graeco-Egyptian magical tradition by the range of divine names, epithets, references and synonyms he commanded, so in Christian magical practice knowledge of the names of individual angels, not merely the seven archangels who protected Solomon’s seal, such as Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel, which are “almost universal in classic rabbinic literature”, but many others, largely taken from apocryphal texts, was the privileged means of displaying author-ity.49 We may add to these familiarity with Biblical names of power such as Sabaoth, Iao or Adonai, which had long been absorbed into the repertory of pagan practice.50 Knowledge of angelic and Bibli-cal names is one type of authority; another is the ability to cite texts, 46 PGrMag 16 l. 3f.

Just as, in the pagan tradition, sheer accumula-tion of material was considered to lend extra authority to the utter-ance, so also in Christian magic: PGrMag 19, for example, consists of a catena or doxology of biblical phrases, successively all four Gospel incipits plus Psalm 90.1, John 1.23, and Matth. 6.9.53 Another type of knowledge that could be displayed is familiarity with Christian sym-bols.54 A fi ne example is PGrMag 4, which consists of a series of crosses (5 across x 3 down) laid out over a piece of parchment and composed of the words of Matth. 4.23f. In the case of protective amulets, the obvious example is the Seal of Solomon, which depicts a mounted warrior subduing a demonic enemy (Lilith), and is known in several dozen examples.55It seems to me that the likeliest explanation for this reduction of Scripture to a formal device is the process of selection—one might almost say the stylisation—of Christian texts practised both in schools and in the process of educating the rural population in the rudiments of the faith.

Even allowing for the extremely lacunate state of the texts, it is clear that, except for the incantations against hail, the tradition continued to develop locally from the types of text familiar from the eastern Mediterranean, so much so that no specifi c Biblical citations can be identifi ed.

Th ey are meant to protect anyone who recites them (hence the name ‘breast-plates’, Fr. cuirasses). Th eir most salient features are: 1. an enumeration of the powers invoked; 2. an enumeration of the body-parts to be pro-tected; and 3. an enumeration of the dangers, enemies or obstacles to be avoided or overcome. At the same time, we should note that listing is not specifi c to the loricae, since it is commonly used in other types of prayers too, such as litanies. Indeed, a number of loricae resemble litanies (particularly when they develop the fi rst type of list, the spiri-tual or other powers to be invoked), and Charles Plummer included some of them in his Irish Litanies (Plummer 1925).Modern scholars have reacted to these texts in various ways. Most have found them bizarre and surprising. Th e Benedictine monk Louis Gougaud, who wrote the main study on the subject, made every eff ort to diff erentiate Christian loricae from magical charms. By restricting his corpus to acceptable texts, and rejecting others as ‘superstitious’, he managed to avoid the diffi cult question of whether they might not be the Christianised form of pagan charms used to obtain protection, specifi cally protection against malign-magical attack.1 For example, he considered the lorica Brendani, with its long list of invocations, to be superstitious, and would have liked his readers to consider such exam-ples Celtic inventions.2 But the possibility of a pagan origin, which the 1 Dom L.

Stokes, J. Vendryes, and Charles Plummer, himself an Anglican canon.3We should then recognise these prayers as Christian, with some unorthodox features. I would like to suggest that the origin of these discrepant features is to be found not in Celtic cultures, but rather in the survival of magical handbooks from late antiquity. Th e earliest Hiberno-Latin loricae date, as far as is known, from the middle of the 7th century: in the case of the Old Irish loricae, the names of St. Pat-rick or St. Columcille are clearly suppositious, their authorship being claimed in order to lend these texts particular authority.4 I would argue that this type of prayer did not arrive very early in the Celtic area and was perhaps introduced during the period of intensifi ed exchanges due to the foundation of Irish centres in Continental Europe. Th e mission of St. Columban to the Franks, around the end of the sixth century, may have triggered off the process.We need fi rst to dispose of two defi nitional problems, one theoreti-cal (what is a lorica?), the other practical (which of the surviving texts are to be called loricae?). Th is is not, however, the place to try to draw up a new list. As for the fi rst question, is the criterion to be the con-tent, so that any prayer invoking divine protection would be a lorica provided it include enumerations of the requisite kinds? Or is it to be the occurrence in the title, or somewhere in the text, of the word lorica or some equivalent (e.g. OIr. lúirech, W. llurig, OIr. scíath, “shield” and Mod.Ir. sgiath-lúireach)?Th is second criterion, though in some ways attractive, will not work when we look at the evidence. For example, in a Hiberno-Latin manuscript we fi nd a text, now known as the ‘Leyden Lorica’, which memorandum designed for private devotion. It mainly requests protection against sin or temptation.3 Revue Celtique 33 (1912) 477f. (review of Gougaud 1911–12); Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford 1910) 1: cxxxv n. 6.4 In the Book of Armagh (beginning of the 9th cent.), the hagiographical dossier of St. Patrick compiled in the 7th cent. by Muirchú refers to a canticum composed by Patrick, no doubt the so-called Lorica of St. Patrick. Probably therefore the text already existed in VIIp. Its Irish name is faéd fi ada, “the cry of the Deer”. (A possible varia-tion of the same expression, féth fi ada, referring to a kind of magic in mythological tales, is usually translated “mist of invisibility”.) According to the legend, St. Patrick and his companions were miraculously changed into deer and survived an ambush by reciting this prayer."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":" celtic loricae and ancient magical charms 631is in fact a charm designed to inspire love.5 Dom Gougaud of course omitted it from his list, as did Seán Ó Duinn (Ó Duinn 1990). Both consider it a ‘pseudo-lorica’; nevertheless Ó Duinn does discuss it in his chapter on lists of body-parts (Ó Duinn 1990, 83f.). Th e use of the word lorica to refer to this love-charm might suggest that the Irish prayers called loricae were felt to be rather close to magical charms so that, by extension, any charm might also be called a lorica.Th e formal criterion (i.e. lorica in the title) would also mean that we would have to accept every ‘prayer for protection’ in Irish or Scot-tish Gaelic. Yet in fact all they do is invoke divine protection by using classical expressions. In the modern Sgiath-lúireach Mhuire (Mary’s Shield), for example, the word sgiath-lúireach (“shield-breast-plate”) in the title is due mainly to a popular belief that the very recitation is itself protective.6 I may note in passing that the mention of the virtues of a prayer, ancient or modern, in the prologue or the conclusion, is always very important. A Breton folklorist who is also a traditional singer, Yann-Fanch Kemener, has told me that this mention of ‘indul-gences’ is recited as a part of the prayer by many Breton speakers.7 We should therefore pay some attention to the preambles of the Old Irish (or Hiberno-Latin) hymns preserved in the Liber Hymnorum.8 But I cannot here take account of all the traditional prayers included in Ó Duinn’s list: he even includes prayers designed for special occasions, such as protection when setting out on a long journey; when raking 5 Edited by Friedel 1899; bibliography: Kenney 1929, 272; Lapidge and Sharpe 1985 no. 1239.

In contrast to regular Loricae, the two lists (body-parts, and powers invoked) occur in reverse order.6 Hyde 1906, 20f., 64f.

Th ese protec-tive prayers are still very numerous in Irish and Scottish traditional folklore, as shown by the collections of Douglas Hyde in Ireland (Hyde 1906) and Alexander Carmichael in Scotland (Carmichael 1928–71).I therefore take content as my main criterion for defi ning loricae. Here is Gearóid Mac Eoin’s list of their main themes: I. A: Invocation of the Trinity B: Invocation of God as Creator C: Invocation of God as Unitas D: Invocation of Christ E: Invocation of archangels and angels F: Invocation of the diff erent categories of saints: patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, etc. G: Invocation of the elements or the forces of nature. II. List of parts of the body with prayers for the protection of each.III. List of situations or postures (e.g. lying, sitting, standing) in which protection is asked for.IV. List of dangers against which protection is asked. A: Prayer that the protection requested may lead to eternal salvation B: Prayer of a general nature C: Repetition of one of the above vel sim.Not all loricae contain a list of powers invoked, so this feature cannot be considered essential. But it is frequently found in the older loricae. Gearóid Mac Eoin saw a parallel in the list in the Canticum trium puerorum, the hymn of praise sung by the three young men thrown into a furnace on the orders of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 3.52–90).9 Th eir prayer is a succession of benedictions, which may be consid-ered the equivalent of exorcisms. Several loricae enumerate the dif-ferent spiritual powers invoked, as in a litany. Th e prayer by Colgu Ó Duinechda, for example, begins with thirty-four invocations of 9 Th e three youths in the furnace occur on some Irish high crosses (e.g. Moone, Arboe, Kells tower), and are mentioned in the Martyrology of Oengus. F. Henry, Irish High Crosses (Dublin 1964) 35f., traced the theme back to a very old prayer for the dying, entitled Ordo commendationis animae. Th is hymn has always been very popu-lar: for example, it was directed to be sung at every solemn mass in Spain and Gaul: cf. Fourth Council of Toledo [633 CE] §14, in: G. Martinez Diez and F. Rodriguez (eds.), La Colección Canónica Hispana (Madrid 1992) 5: 203f.

It is no doubt the regular rhythm of this text that is responsible for its name, ‘Th e Broom of Devotion’ (Scuap Chrábaid). It is worth mentioning here, following Kuno Meyer, that Colgu was one of the teachers of Alcuin; and we fi nd Alcuin making use of his former master’s prayers on serious occasions. In a letter to him, for example, he writes: sed (vos) obsecro ut vestris sacrosanctis orationibus manentes vel euntes muniamur.11 Colgu was thus already then known for the virtues of his prayers.Particularly characteristic, as regards both the list of invocations and the list of body-parts, is the Lorica attributed to St Gildas, and allegedly brought to Ireland by Laidcend mac Baith Bannaig (the attribution to Gildas is in fact found in only one manuscript, the others attribute it Laidcend himself ).12 Laidcend, the composer of Ecloga de Moralibus in Iob and a monk in Clonfert-Mulloe abbey, died in 661. Th e authorship of Lorica Gildae was long debated, but we should probably attribute it to Laidcend, as Herren has argued.13 Th is is particularly so because the language is typically Hiberno-Latin, with a profusion of Hisperic words (Hisperic Latin consists in rare words, neologisms, new borrow-ings from Greek or Latin and any word that might add a fl ourish to Hiberno-Latin writings).14Th e prologue to this text in the manuscript called Leabhar Breac is typical of this kind of prayer:15Gillus (= Gildas) hanc loricam fecit ad demones expellendos eos qui adu-ersauerunt illi. Peru(enit) angelus ad illum, et dixit illi angelus: Si quis homo frequentauerit illam, addetur ei secul(um) septimm annis, et tertia 10 Colgu Ó Duinechda was a scholar at Clonmacnoise abbey, who died in 794 CE. Th e prayer is sometimes attributed to Airerán of Clonard, who lived in the preceding century, though I fi nd this hypothesis less probable.11 Otia Merseiana (University of Liverpool, Faculty of Arts) 2 (1900–01) 92–108 at 93f.12 Kenney 1929, no. 100 = Lapidge and Sharpe 1985, no. 294.

Finit, amen (ll. 97–100).As Herren noticed, this text shows a considerable knowledge of ana-tomical words, probably owed to Isidore’s Etymologies, which had just then appeared.17 In fact it contains the richest list of body-parts to be found in our corpus, with about 136 items, some repeated from part to part. Most loricae list only fi ve or six; those most frequently mentioned are the eyes, head, hands, feet, and sometimes the tongue.Such lists are not found just in loricae, however. Th ey also form a natural element in penitential prayers, for example in the Book of Cerne.18 Dom Kuyper’s description is worth quoting:In both, there is a minute enumeration of all possible sins, even of crimes the most heinous and unlikely.19 Th e penitent speaks as though he had been guilty of them all, and moreover as though every part of him had shared in his guilt. Th us he proceeds to accuse himself of sins of his eyes, ears, nostrils; sins by his mouth, hands, feet, tongue, throat, neck, breast, heart; sins through his bones, fl esh, marrow, kidneys; and even through his skin, teeth, hair, nails, tears and spittle: fi nally he declares: peccaui in anima mea et in omni corpore meo.Dom Kuyper is aware of the existence of similar confessional texts in other parts of Western Europe but nevertheless considers an Irish origin possible.In one case (Book of Cerne no. 17), the list of body-parts is modelled on a description of Christ’s body; the prayer asks that one be assimi-lated to Christ’s sanctity and purity.20 Similarly, and symmetrically to 17 Old Irish glosses explaining these rare Latin words have also proved important for our knowledge of Old Irish vocabulary. 18 no. 8 = Kuypers 1901, 94: confi teor tibi cordis mei cogitationes et uerba oris mei, uel pro natura carnis mei, pro pelle, pro renibus, pro ore, pro lingua, pro labiis, pro faucibus, pro dentes, pro capillis, pro ungules (?), pro lacrimas, pro sputo, pro medullas, pro cerebro, pro semine uiri uel mulieris, pro omni durum uel molli, umido uel arido, quodcumque umquam contigisset intus uel foras; no. 9 = Kuypers 1901, 97: peccaui in oculis meis et in auribus meis, p. in naribus et in auribus, p. in manibus et in pedibus, p. in lingua et in guttore, p. in collo et in pectore, p. in corde et in cogitationibus, p. in ossibus et in carne, p. in medullis et in renis, p. in animùa mea et in omni corpore.19 He is referring here to prayers 8 and 10 of the Book of Cerne. 20 Th is is entitled: Oratio utilis de membra [sic] Christi.

A good example is to be found in the Oratio Matutina, incip. Mecum esto Domine Deus Sabaoth, mane cum resur-rexero . . . , sometimes ascribed to St. Jerome:Custodi os meum ne loquar uana, ne fabuler saecularia, ne detraham absentibus, ne maledicam maledictionem praesentibus, sed e contrario benedicam Dominum in omni tempore et semper laus eius sit in ore meo;Custodi oculos meos ne uideant mulierem ad concupiscendam eam per libidinem, nec desiderem rem proximi, nec delicias saeculi amplectem, sed dicam cum sancto Dauid: Oculi mei semper ad Dominum, quoniam ipse est qui euellet de laqueo pedes meos [Ps. 24.15] et iterum, ad te leuaui oculos meos qui habitas in caelo [Ps. 122.1];Custodi aures meas ne audiant detractationem, nec mendacium, nec uerbum otiosum, sed aperientur cotidie ad audiendum uerbum Dei;Custodi pedes meos ne circumeant domus otiosos sed fi ant in oratione Dei cooperantes menti;Custodi manus meas ne porrigantur saepe ad capienda munera, sed potius eleuantur in praecibus Domini mundi et puri quo possim dicere illud propheticum: Eleuatio manuum mearum sacrifi cium uespertinum [Ps. 140.2].mis . . . et per uestigia tua felicissima, fi lius Dei, et per fl ectionem genuum tuorum, con-fi rma gressus meos, et per manus tuas sanctas ac uenerabiles, munda manus meas a malis operibus, etc.21 Th e same type of request occurs in a prayer ascribed to St. Augustine, which may have inspired parts of Patrick’s Lorica. Here are some extracts from the Book of Cerne fol. 47b–49b (note the reference to scutum ueritatis [diuinae]): Deus in quo omnia, sub quo omnia, per quem omnia sunt, parce animae, parce malis meis, parce criminibus;da cor quod te timeat, sensum qui te intelligat, oculos cordis qui te uideant, aures quae uerbum tuum audiant; [. . .]aufer, Domine, a corde meo alienatum sensum et cura in me stuporem mentis;exstirpa in uisceribus meis consilia iniquitatis;erade a lingua mea detrahendi consuetudinem, mentiendi fallacitatem, loquendi gar-rulitatem;protege me, Domine, scuto ueritatis tuae ac fi dei tuae ut me diabolica ignita iacula non penetrent;et quidquid illud est quod infelicitas mea a te petere aut non sumit aut non sapit, id tu pro tua pietate tribue.

Sean Ó Duinn gives numerous examples (1990, 93–105). Here I may just quote the Lorica Brendani:Protege me Domine . . .in aere, in terra, in aquis, in mari,in fl exu, in erectione, in gressu, in statione,dormiendo, vigilando,in omni motuet in omni die, in omni hora, in omni loco, in omni nocte,et in omnibus diebus vitae meae.Here again, the same feature occurs in confessional contexts. For example, a prayer ascribed to abbot Hygbald or Hugbald reads:Ut dimittat mihi omnia peccata mea atque crimina quae feci a conabulis iuuentutis meae usque in hanc aetatis horam, in factis, in uerbis, in uisu, in risu, in gressu, in auditu, in tactu olfactuque, uellens (!), nolens, sciens nesciensque, in spiritu uel in corpore delinquens commisi.22Another lorica, much more sober than Lorica Gildae and certainly closer to our own concept of devotion, reads:Obsecro te IHS.

It is requested in the name of the cross, which was probably signed at each mention. At the end of the prayer, however, aft er a Greek doxology (eulogumen patera cae yo cae agion pneuma . . . amin), we fi nd a kind of exorcism that alludes to the power attached to any copy of the text, thus bringing us back very close to the world of magic:adiuro te Satanae diabulus aelfae (?) per D(eu)m uiuum ac uerum et per trementem diem iudicii ut refugiatur ab homine illo qui (h)abeat hunc aepist(olam) scriptum (!) secum in nomine d(e)i patris et fi lii et sp(iritu)s s(an)c(t)i.Th e Old Irish lorica attributed to Mugrón follows the same pattern:Christ’s cross over this face, and thus over my ear, Christ’s cross over this eye, Christ’s cross over this nose.Christ’s cross over this mouth, Christ’s cross over this throat, Christ’s cross over the back of this head. Christ’s cross over this side . . . Murphy 1962, 32–35We can observe a change of perspective in the middle of this text: there is a clear shift away from the body of the subject towards the surrounding space, which is to be fi lled with the divine presence:Christ’s cross to accompany me before me, Christ’s cross to accompany me behind me, Christ’s cross to meet every diffi culty both on hollow and hill. . . .Christ’s cross up to broad Heaven, Christ’s cross down to earth,Let no evil or hurt come to my body or my soul . . . Th e text fi nally returns to the subject’s own body, now as it were entirely covered by the Cross:From the top of my head to the nail of my foot, O Christ, against every danger I trust in the protection of thy cross.Th e same attempt at sanctifi cation, internal and external, can be found in other loricae, particularly in the famous Lorica of St. Patrick. Th e prayer invokes Christ’s presence all around the subject’s person: “Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ below me, Christ above me”. Th e purpose of listing body-parts here is not to protect them from evil or temptation; the performative ‘I girdle’ represents the speaker as declaring that divine power is today to supplement his own bodily strength:"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"640  pierre-yves  lambertI girdle myself todaywith God’s strength to move myself,with God’s power to uphold me,with God’s wisdom to guide me,with God’s eye to look before me,with God’s ear to make me hear,with God’s word to make me speak,with God’s arm to protect myself,with God’s way to lie before me,with God’s shield to protect myself,with God’s host to defend me,against snares of devils, against temptations of vices, against inclina-tions (?) of nature, against every one who shall wish me ill, afar and anear, alone and in a multitude.24Th ese texts reveal many other ways of ‘christianising’ protection of the body. For example in the prayer of St. Fursy:May the yoke of God’s law be on these shoulders,May the wisdom of the Holy Ghost be on this head,May the sign of Christ be on this forehead,May the hearing of the Holy Ghost be in these ears,May the smelling of the Holy Ghost be in this nose,May the vision of the celestial hosts be in these eyes,May the language of the celestial hosts be in this mouth,May the work of God’s Church be in these hands,May the benefi ts of God and of his parents be the business of these feet,May this heart be one of the dwellings of God,May this whole person belong to God the Father.Credo et Pater.25Th e Lorica of Mael Ísu Ua Brolcháin requests that all parts of the body, including sexual ones, may be protected from sin or temptation.Th e argument I want to make starts from the observation that malign-magical charms are mentioned in loricae with surprising frequency. For example, in the Lorica of St. Patrick we fi nd the following:24 Tr. Stokes 1901–03, 2: 356, with some changes of my own. For the fi rst word, atomriug, I adopt D. Binchy’s view that it is formed from ad-rig, “he binds”, not as-reig / atraig, “he rises”: Ériu 20 (1966) 232–234. Another list of body-parts in the Lorica notes potential threats launched by others:Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,Christ in every eye that sees me,Christ in every ear that hears me.25 Text in K.

We have already noted the reference in the Lorica Gildae to the inuisi-biles sudum clauos quos fi ngunt odibiles, which clearly implies the use of poppets secretly pierced with nails (rather than defi xiones proper, which had for centuries ceased to be made). Th e Klosterneuburg incantation likewise refers to uptha na mban mbaeth, “charms of silly women”.29 Th is text invokes not only Cris Finnéin, Cris Eoin, “the belt of St. Finnén, the belt of St. John”, but also Cris nathrach, “the belt of a snake”, a clearly magical object. In some cases, the lorica envisages a divine counter-attack against magical aggression. One example is the Dumfett Críst, a lorica attributed to St. Columba, the fi rst abbot of Iona:Avert from me the plagues (muirecha: magical?) and perverse,(avert them) from the hearing of my ears, from the sight of my eyes, from my hundred articulations, from my hundred muscles, from my hundred bones;if it is a man that forge them up, let them turn back against his virile parts, if it is a woman, against her female parts, if it is a virgin, against her virginity.It is this feature of the loricae that especially interests me here.30 Why should there be such an emphasis upon aggressive magic in these texts? One possibility that occurs to me is that the original purpose of the genre was specifi cally to counter aggressive magic, though not necessarily26 In these two clauses, some manuscripts give bricht, “charm” instead of recht, “usage, law”.27 Th e expression is: Fri brichtu ban 7 gobann 7 druad; “women” = sorceresses.28 Or reduces?

Th at is, it may have originally been a specialised form of (oral) phylactery, though it later developed into a genuine prayer or litany. A number of early Jewish and Christian phylacteries mention such attacks. For example, the ‘Phylactery of Moses’, found in Sicily (IIp–IIIp), states that the person who carries it shall not need to fear any sorcerer or aggressive magical attack: [αὐ]τὸ φορῶν οὐ φοβήσῃ μάγον οὐδὲ κατάδεσμον οὐδὲ πνεῦμα πονηρὸν οὐδέ τι δήποτε, “by carrying it you shall fear neither a sorcerer nor binding spell, nor evil spirit, nor anything whatsoever”.31 On a Christian magi-cal prayer from the Fayyûm (c. 300 CE) we read: φυλάξατέ με ἀπὸ παντὸς δαίμονος ἀρσενικοῦ ἤ θηλυκοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς στρατηγήματος καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς ὀνόματος, “protect me from every demon, male and female, and from every (magical) attack and from every aggressive incantation (lit.: name)” (PGrMag 22 ll.35–40). A late-antique Chris-tian amulet on papyrus requests that the name of Jesus protect the (female) wearer from all illness, fevers, headaches, and ἀπὸ πάσης βασκοσ&ύνης κ(αὶ) ἀπὸ παντὸς πν(εύμ)α(τος), “from any attack by the evil eye and from all evil spirits”.32 Later still, we fi nd a request for help against τὸν δαίμονα προσβασκανίας, the demon of magical attack (PGrMag 9 l.f., VIp).On the other hand, it is very diffi cult to suggest a specifi c liter-ary antecedent. Requests of this kind only occupy a relatively small amount of attention in the eastern Mediterranean world; so far as I know, there are no late-antique Christian texts exclusively, or mainly, directed against aggressive magical attack. Nevertheless there are a number of tendencies in Christian phylacteries analogous to the loricae, including elaborate invocation-schemes, extended anaphora, lists of diff erent movements or activities, and lists of body-parts.33 31 Kotansky GMA no. 32 l.10–12; 25–27. Kotansky suggests ad loc. that the list may be a simplifi ed version of the longer list in Deut. 18:10f., but there is no very good reason to accept this even if we invoke Aquila’s translation.32 SupplMag no. 31 l.4; cf. Kotansky GMA no. 52 ll.11–13: ἀπὸ δεμόνων καὶ φαρμάκων καὶ καταδέσμων, from demons and aggressive magic (probably a variant on the traditional phrase for malign magic: φάρμακα καὶ ἐπῳδαί).33 Examples might be: a) invocation-schemes: Kotansky GMA nos.41 (IV–Vp); 52 (IVp); PGrMag 13 (IV–Vp); SupplMag 36 (V–VIp, in Latin); b) anaphora: Kotansky GMA no. 52 ll.13–61 (best seen in the transl. on p. 280); 32 ll.43–36 with Kotansky ad loc; 33 ll.1–12; PGrMag 23; SupplMag nos. 13 passim; 35; 23; 34; c) list of activities etc.: Kotansky GMA no. 52 ll.95–109 (this trope is certainly derived from aggressive love magic, e.g. PGrMag IV 1510–19; SupplMag no. 73 ll.5–7; 43 ll.8f.; d) parts: SupplMag no. 30 l.5 (in fact formulaic); PGrMag 12 ll.9f.

Schäublin (eds.), Lamella Bernensis: ein spätantikes Gold-amulett mit christlichem Exorzismus und verwandte Texte (Stuttgart 1999), related to Kotansky GMA no. 52, is a fi ne example of several of these features. Th e tradition continues into Coptic protective magic, cf. the texts translated in AChrMag.34 PGrMag 10 ll.24–29. I take it that βόθυνον is a euphemism for a latrine. If these were supplied with a drain, as in Pompeii (cf. R. Long, Th e Insula of Menander at Pompeii, I: Th e Structures [Oxford 1997] 91f.; 114f. etc.), this would explain the fear of demons lurking there, as in the baths. 35 N.

One of the earliest pagan protective amulets known, from Amisus in Pontus, was intended to protect the wearer from magical attack by identifying him with King Mithradates, who famously had protected himself from being poisoned by regularly ingesting harmful substances.41 Another early phylactery from Aleppo in Syria asks that Juliana be released ἀπὸ πάσης φαρμακίας καὶ παντὸς πάθους καὶ πάσης ἐνεργείας καὶ φαντασίας δαιμονώδους, “from all sorcery and all suff ering and all intervention and spirit-apparitions in the night”. Analogous lists of affl ictions certainly continued to be used into the Byzantine period.42 Unfortunately, however, there is no trace of a genre of pagan phylacteries directly counter to the listing of body-parts, which was a common feature of ancient aggressive as a pair, e.g. CIL III 633 = ILS 5466 (Philippi); XII 1904 = ILS 3400 (Vienne); in North African lists of deities invoked for a votive, Mercury is sometimes placed next to Hercules (CIL VIII 8247) or near him (4578; 8246).38 E.g. PGrMag VII 193–96; XIII 261–64 (where the snake is identifi ed with Apo-phis); SupplMag nos. 16–17; PGrMag XXVIIIa–c are three versions of a pagan charm against scorpions from Oxyrhynchos still being recopied in Vp; SupplMag 89 (IVp) seems to show Jewish infl uence. 39 Cf.

Many Welsh popular prayers could qualify as loricae, particularly Gweddi Taliesin, “Taliesin’s Prayer”, and Ymgroesiad Taliesin, “Taliesin Self-crossing”, edited by B.F. Roberts, ibid. Gearoid Mac Eoin, Some Icelandic Loricae, Studia Hibernica 3 (1963) 143–154, provides examples of similar prayers collected in Iceland in the 19th cent. Th ey are called brynjabaen, “prayers of breast-plate”. Th ese prayers, probably introduced by the Irish, present the same features as the Irish loricae, and likewise refer to protection against magic spells.45 Th is continuity between pagan and Christian magic formulae has been studied by Erik Peterson, Heis Th eos: epigraphische, formgeschichtliche und religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen. Forschungen zur Religion und Literatur des Alten und Neuen Testa-ments, NF 24 (Göttingen 1924). 46 Cf. R.L. Gordon, ‘What’s in a list?’: Listing in Greek and Graeco-Roman Malign Magical Texts, in: D.

Many other texts could also be quoted, e.g. curses pronounced by saints, or curses inserted in sentences of excommunication."},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"646  pierre-yves  lambertTh ere may however be another argument to support the claim that loricae originated as protective magical texts. In every century of Christian history, we can fi nd popular forms of religious behaviour that look like magic. By this I mean primarily the claim, implicit or explicit, that to recite a particular text, or merely to possess a written version of it, eo ipso confers supernatural power. Th is is surely the case even with the christianised forms of these texts, at least in popular belief. It is as much the sheer use of repetition and the formal stylisa-tion as the holy names invoked that generate the protective power of these texts. Th is feature of the loricae may derive from an ultimate origin in pagan defensive magical practice.Appendix: An Old Irish lorica, translated into EnglishTh is is the prayer ascribed to Columcille, inc.
