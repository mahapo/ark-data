The social practice of secrecy builds political power and relieson communicative strategies that simultaneously conceal and reveal, employing culturally specific codes involvingabstraction, ambiguity, metaphor, and allusion. Samothrace increased its secrecy as it grew in prestige: archaeologicalmaterialization of this secrecy includes euphemistic inscriptions and magnetized iron rings used as tokens ofinitiation. The rings use myth, philosophy, and ritual practice to communicate the initiate’s status while emphasizingthe rites’ resistance to disclosure. [secrecy, Greece, initiation, iron, magnetism]Secrecy, Georg Simmel proposed over 100 years ago, is asocial practice that informs our speech, institutions, andcognitive processes (Simmel 1908). Secrecy is more thankeeping silent: it is possession of knowledge, announce-ment of that possession, and the public demonstration thatone will not reveal it—the latter often in accordance withculturally recognized dictates of discretion. Secrecy is thusa cultural practice, which is ultimately a performance of in-dividual status, built about the question of knowledge. Theknowledge being concealed is ultimately irrelevant—indeed“knowledge” may well be put in quotation marks, as it maybe entirely fictive, and the social forms it generates are un-related to its propositional content. It does have, however,significant cognitive ramifications, as the need to announceand to hide simultaneously draws on symbolic vocabulariesand performative practices unique to each society. Secrecyin the Kongo will look different from secrecy in Greece—but these will manifest analogous dynamics of disclosureand discretion.The embodiment of secrecy—its translation into mate-rial form—has drawn theoretical discussion in art historyand archaeology as well as in cultural anthropology. Ar-chaeological discussions have focused primarily on builtspaces that show restricted spatial and visual access, hid-den loci within shrines, “trick” objects that create illu-sions, and distribution of finds suggesting restricted access(Commenge et al. 2006:788; Hastorf 2007; Levy 2006:13;Peatfield 1994:153). These studies emphasize the physicalmovement of participants through spaces that constrain per-ception, allowing investigators to reconstruct the cognitiveexperience of restricted access and thus, potentially, the se-quence in which or moment at which the participant’s socialstatus changed from exclusion to inclusion. Art historicalinvestigations emphasize moveable artifacts, whose visualsurfaces manifest repeated acts of occlusion and penetra-tion without yielding any visual clues as to the materialconcealed. The most substantial distinction between discus-sions in these two disciplines is not in the objects studiedbut the sources of social information and the position ofsecrecy in the investigation—as a datum to be explored, ora hypothesis to be argued. Art historical investigations posi-tion their objects in ethnographic accounts, local informants,and lived experience: they begin with the knowledge that theobjects in question enable the cultural practice of secrecy.Prehistoric archaeological investigations, on the other hand,pursue secrecy as a hypothesis for the function of spaces andARCHEOLOGICAL PAPERS OF THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, Vol. 21, Issue 1, pp. 49–71, ISSN 1551-823X,online ISSN 1551-8248.C©2012 by the American Anthropological Association.

Ethnographic analogy, contempo-rary local myth and legend, and historical texts are frequentadditions to these investigations; a theoretical framework fortestability has yet to emerge.A promising archaeological focus for a more articulatearchaeology of secrecy is the cult centers that flourished inthe ancient Mediterranean from the seventh century B.C.E.to the fourth century C.E., dedicated to rituals the Greekscalledmysteria—initiations whose procedures and meaningwere sealed by secrecy. Popular etymology derivedmyste-riafrom the Greek verbmuein,meaning to close the eyesor mouth. Ancient exegetes observed that the word referredboth to the sacred obligation for discretion and to a moretranscendent sensibility that the experience of the rites ex-ceeded the capacity of human speech (Burkert 1985:276).Contemporary texts from a wide range of literary genres—history, poetry, comedy, and epigram—confirm the central-ity of secrecy to the rites, and so let us proceed from knowl-edge rather than hypothesis of this social praxis. These textsalso demonstrate rhetorical and performative strategies strik-ingly parallel to those observed in studies of secrecy amongliving cultures. The use of texts as informants has a long andproblematic history in Mediterranean archaeologies, whichdeveloped, in the 19th century, in the search for a transparentrelationship between the textual and material world (Dyson1993; Morris 1994). The historical texts relevant to ritual se-crecy are doubly complex, as they respond to the rhetoricalstrategies of their own genres as well as the cultural imper-atives of discretion. The thoughtful, nuanced integration ofthese texts with material evidence is fundamental in bring-ing the Greek mysteries into the archaeological discussionsof secrecy.Among the mystery cults, the sanctuary of the GreatGods of Samothrace offers particularly rich material fortheorizing the material embodiment of secrecy in ritual con-texts. Archaeological approaches to the ritual experiencehave emphasized how topography and architecture shapedthe experience of initiates as they moved through the site(Clinton 2003; Cole 1984:26–37; Wescoat 2006). In thischapter, I focus on artifacts rather than architecture: dedica-tory inscriptions and magnetized iron rings worn as tokensof the Samothracian cult. These materials, combined withthe textual tradition of the gods of the rites, reflect practicesof secrecy that are responsive to local contexts, the institu-tional structures of Greek mysteries, and political powers.The textual tradition is unusually complex even for a mys-tery cult, both as a purely literary phenomenon and for itsinexact relationship to material remains. The bulk of thetexts are fragmentary; they reflect a high degree of confu-sion regarding the identity of the gods, and they come fromvery different historical periods, primarily the fifth centuryB.C.E. to the second C.E. but as late, in some cases, as the12th century C.E. The perspectives of their authors rangefrom the sympathetic to the skeptical, including ancient his-torians who seem to have been initiates themselves and theearly Christian fathers who wrote in order to discredit therites. These texts name, moreover, divinities who do notappear in the inscriptions or images from the site itself. Ar-chaeological approaches to the rites have, as a result, oftenomitted these textual traditions from the interpretation ofthe material remains. Models of secrecy, however, suggestthat the absence of the gods from the inscriptions, and theconfusions of the written record, are both natural outcomesof secrecy as a social practice.My investigation begins with a survey of theoreticaldevelopments in secrecy since the time of Simmel and theappropriateness of these theories for the Greek mysteries.I then turn to the Samothracian site as an archaeologicaltesting ground for the embodiment of secrecy as a ritualpractice, and conclude with the parameters of testability thatcould profitably be brought to an archaeology of secrecy.Secrecy in the Anthropological TraditionSimmel’s concepts have developed substantially in thecentury since their first publication. Applications to socio-logical and ethnographic contexts have yielded structural-functionalist (Fulton 1972; Little 1949, 1966), Marxist(Murphy 1980), sexual (Kratz 1990), and semiotic mod-els (Bellman 1984; Piot 1993:353) and comparisons be-tween secrecy and privacy (Bok 1982; Warren and Laslett1980), deceit (Petersen 1993), modernity (Kolig 2003;Pellizzi 1994), the mass media, and Christianity (Meyer2006). Studies of secrecy are often but by no means alwaysconcerned with ritual; organized crime, terrorism (Schnei-der and Schneider 2002), intelligence agencies (Tefft 1980),and everyday communications (Beidelman 1993; Piot 1993)demonstrate the saturation of the practices of secrecy intonumerous realms of activity, in both contemporary and tra-ditional cultures.Throughout these developments, the political power andcommunicative paradox of secrecy remain fundamental. Se-crecy is power: the distinction between those who know andthose who do not defines the boundary of a group and artic-ulates ranks within it. Its political force relies on the knowl-edge of the secret’s possession by those who are excludedfrom the information itself. This gives rise to the paradoxthat the possession of a secret must be known but its contentsremain undisclosed (Beidelman 1993:41; Bellman 1981;Roberts 1993). Simple curiosity regarding the contents"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace51of the secret generates one level of power among the pos-sessors; another comes from the visible boundaries of thegroup thus formed. The more elaborate the boundaries, thegreater the implied power of the group and its secret, and themore substantial the prestige accorded to both. To the extentthat the secret is shared by previous generations, the groupmay extend into the invisible realms of the dead (Fernan-dez 1982:262; Quarcoopome 1993); when a secret societyexists in numerous villages, members enjoy the pragmaticpower of supralocal communication, which may otherwisebe complicated by distinctions in dialect, distance, and lo-cal customs (Bellman 1984). The boundary into and out ofthe group, in addition, is capable of elaboration in order toincrease prestige. Boundaries may mask the locus of the se-cret under a cloak of the everyday and nonvaluable, directattention away from the secret itself and to another realm, orbe elaborately worked, finely crafted in both semantics andmaterials (Strother 1993).Field studies of secrecy focus on the social structures,relationships, and practices surrounding secrecy. Theseprove more culturally significant than the contents of thesecret itself (Beidelman 1993; Erickson 1981; Middle-ton 1973; Murphy 1980:193; Nooter 1993a:20; Piot 1993;Rappaport 1971:71). As foci of investigation, they offer datathat are both more accessible than the secret and capable ofdiscussion without violation of the fieldworkers’ or the cul-ture’s ethical code (George 1993; Rohatynskyj 1997; Wagner1984:153). There is often, in fact, no secret at all, or the se-cret consists of cultural information already widely known(Bellman 1984:86–88; Picton 1990:194). Beidelman notesthat Kaguru children already have many snatches of infor-mation about adult experience, but their initiation into adult-hood connects these pieces of information to complex ideasabout the structure of kinship groups and how marriageworks in the replacement of ancestors (Beidelman 1991,1993). The practice of secrecy places the facts of sexualityinto an associative web, unique to its culture, which articu-lates the matters to which it is relevant. It creates relation-ships among potentially discrete semantic ranges, groundedin the realities of social organization, local history, myth,and ecology. Its mastery is a measure of acculturation: tobe able to keep a secret is the sign that one is a responsibleadult. This is not only because it reflects the possessor’s self-restraint and regard for the group that controls the secret;it is a measure of the individual’s mastery of the categoriesof knowledge and behavior that define his society. Secrecyis the public face of the act of knowing. Whether the secretexists or not, the systems around it are cultural realities.While the practice of secrecy is integral to politicalpower, its paradox unfolds in cultural genres of communi-cation (Gilbert 1993; Quarcoopome 1993; Wagner 1984).These offer numerous strategies for secrecy’s expression, inboth visual and verbal form. Visual strategies of secrecyinclude concealment, containment, accumulation, abstrac-tion, and coding (Nooter 1993b:24). Concealment is theleast complex strategy: the Yoruba king’s crown has longstrings of beads that shield his face from easy view, andpowerful medicines are applied inside, which remain com-pletely hidden (Barth 1975:217; Quarcoopome 1993). Re-ceptacles protrude from some Zaire sculptures to containthe medicines given by chiefs and counselors; nails aredriven into others to activate the powers of the medicinesthey contain;nkisifigures from the Kongo are activated bysong (Nooter 1993b:24, cat. 18, 38, 39). The presence ofthe hidden power is announced, its constituents concealed,and actions required from human agents in order to makethe medicines come to life. Understatement ensures a secretthrough the appearance of the ordinary, using unremarkablematerials and minimalist forms. Theboliof the Komo asso-ciations among the Bamana exemplify the principle of accu-mulation: these are enigmatic objects, composed of layers oforganic materials, to which new layers are constantly addedin the form of sacrificial residue (McNaughton 1979:23–44).These accumulations recollect the ritual action that createdthem and provide metaphoric reflection on the epistemologyof initiation in which knowledge is acquired only gradually.Abstraction highlights the relationship between secrecy,material artifacts, and initiation. Visually, it is the processby which local myths and legends are translated into geo-metric and other essential forms: the aesthetic results areimmediately accessible, the semantic becomes opaque. Thetraditions these communicate are accessible only to thosemembers of the culture who have been properly instructed(Biebuyck 1973:93). Geometric patterns in Bamana andKuba textiles, and thelukasamemory boards of the Luba,encode myths, proverbs, and historical knowledge (Nooter1993c:50). Verbal and auditory expressions reinforce thesevisual articulations; they may also work independently ofthem. Thewulu nuudevil is created by auditory illusionalone among the Fala Kpelle: the Poro leader goes throughthe town blowing on a horn, which produces a high-pitchedsound like a terrified human scream. Members follow him,slapping their arms against their sides to simulate the soundof the witch being beaten (Bellman 1980:68). It is a strik-ing example of communal complicity in the illusion and thecommunication of a familiar narrative, involving a complexcultural type, without recourse to the visual.Ambiguity, metaphor, and allusion are key mechanismsof secrecy in both visual and verbal form (Barth 1975:26;Bellman 1984:53–78; Roberts 1993). These work througha principle of plurality: the greater the number of possibleinterpretations, the more difficult it is for the uninitiated"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"52Sandra Blakelyto correctly determine the relevant choice. Myths are par-ticularly rich in these qualities and accordingly significantin the articulation of secrecy. Composed of condensed andvariable semantic elements, subject to local and situationaladaptation, myths support a continual expansion of inter-pretations. This enables graduated steps of initiation, whichreverse and invert previous meanings as initiates proceed,and a paradoxical capacity for secrecy to change over time.Polysemnity of this sort is the conceptual opposite of secrecythrough silence (Picton 1990:194).Several principles emerge from this overview that maybe applied to archaeological analysis. The first is to focus onthe local. Secrecy is universal but not constant; it is sociallyand culturally constructed and must be considered withinthe societal frameworks in which it operates (Barth 1975;Nooter 1993a:18). We may expect the articulation of se-crecy in one site to use the semantic range distinct to it andstrategies that may or may not appear in analogous culticcontexts. The second is to investigate the combination ofelements drawn together in the practice of secrecy. Secrecyis not silence but an interplay of numerous mechanisms,visual, verbal, audible, physical, and metaphoric. The chal-lenge of secrecy is not simply to enumerate those elementsthat have played a role at the site but to consider the patternof their interaction. Third is the importance of the cognitiveas well as the experiential in analysis of a given site. Localmyths and metaphors are essential elements in the creationof secrecy; they should become serious resources for archae-ological interpretation. The characteristics that make themideal for secrecy’s operation—ambiguity, allusion, polysem-nity, plurality—are precisely those that have problematizedthem for the archaeological record, where their key func-tion is often the identification of iconography. This kind ofdirect correspondence has little relevance, however, for thepractice of secrecy, which relies on more nuanced relation-ships between patterns and structure, shifting themes, andvariations in type.Models of Secrecy and MediterraneanMystery CultsPolitical power, local tradition, social prestige, and com-plex semantic webs characterize the mystery cults of the an-cient Mediterranean. The Greeks applied the termmysteriesto a bewildering range of ritual types: local cults named fortheir city-states, whose priesthoods were held by local aris-tocrats; initiations and purifications offered by wanderingpriests whom Plato deemed charlatans (Republic3645); andthe great international sanctuaries such as Samothrace andits Athenian counterpart Eleusis. Patron gods range fromwell-known figures from the Greek mythological pantheonto divinities known only in local tradition. The benefits ofinitiation, suggested in oblique statements by initiates andangry denunciations from Christian writers, may includesalvation in the afterlife, economic prosperity, safety at sea,or stability for the city. What unifies this disparate rangeis the practice of secrecy—a behavioral definition, whichrecommends the appeal to anthropological and sociologicalmodels. The social dynamics of the rites vary significantlyaccording to their institutional type. Political power accruednaturally to the international mysteries, whose sanctuarieswere ideal locations for the advertisement of a ruler’s wealthand closeness with the gods. Hadrian’s gifts to Eleusis,for example, both reflected his philhellenism and increasedhis own prestige (Clinton 1989). The Macedonians and theDiadochi used Samothrace to analogous effect, adorning thesanctuary with innovative architecture and ostentatious dedi-cations (Lehmann 1998:21–22). This dynamic characterizednon-mystery sanctuaries as well; Pausanias’Description ofGreece,written in the second century C.E., reflects a broadMediterranean sensibility for sanctuaries as the must-seesof ancient travel. Specific to mystery cults, however, is thepotentially subversive political force of the group of ini-tiates. The Orphic cult of Leibethra and the Pythagoreanassociations of southern Italy suggest the capacity of mys-teries to generate rebellion and anti-polis revolutionarygroups (Burkert 1972:115–118; Graf 1988; Redfield 1991;Vinogradov 1991; von Fritz 1963:211–218). The voluntarynature of initiation underwrites these threats: scholars havelong distinguished mysteries from other initiatory rites bythe fact that they are undertaken by personal choice, in con-trast to rites of passage stipulated by the city-state in responseto the transition from youth to adult, or citizen to soldier.Gruen notes that Roman legislation of the Bacchic mysteriesin 186 B.C.E., rather than simply outlawing the cult, broughtthese potentially threatening sociogenic forces under statecontrol (Gruen 1990:34–78).Rootedness in the local landscape and intimate connec-tions with civic identity mark innumerable smaller mysteriesthat filled the Greek countryside (Graf 2003). Local mythsconnect these to city founders or heroes and set them inthe deep mythic prehistory from which local aristocrats thenclaimed direct descent. Priesthoods were filled by local wor-thies, and the celebration of the mysteries was part of the an-nual festival calendar. The mysteries of the Great Goddessesin Andania, for example, were founded by Kaukon, a great-grandson of Gaia. When the Thebans and Argives sought toreestablish the Messenian state, they also reestablished themysteries, claiming that this Kaukon appeared in a dream tothe commanders of the Thebans and the Argives and gavethem the instructions for the rites (Pausanias 4.26–37). In"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace53Boiotian Thebes, local legend claimed that the Kabeiroi in-habited the land long ago and that Demeter herself gave themthe mysteries. A sherd from the sanctuary depicts Pratolaos,“first man,” emerging from the ground while a figure namedKabeiros looks on: this is a rare iconographic example ofautochthony, a mythical birth from the soil, which couldbe used to claim territorial ownership. Pausanias describeshow the Kabeiroi claimed their territory through their cultlong after they themselves had faded into prehistory. Thosewho sought to celebrate their mysteries anywhere other thanThebes were overtaken by divine justice; armies who enteredthe sanctuary were struck by lightning bolts or, overcome bydivine madness, flung themselves to their deaths into the sea(Pausanias 9.25.5–10). For sites like Andania and Thebes,the annual celebration of the mysteries renewed local iden-tity, expressed through the mythic construction of prehistoryand facilitated through the priesthoods and benefactions ofpowerful local families.Participation in the mysteries, whether an annual eventor once-in-a-lifetime experience, created considerable socialprestige. Texts identify initiation as the mark of heroes andsages; archaeological evidence reflects the concern to ad-vertise initiation, both at the sanctuary and beyond, fromthe sixth century B.C.E. onward. All of the Argonauts,including Herakles, Jason, Orpheus, and the Dioskouroi,became Samothracian initiates (Diodorus Siculus 5.48.5–49.6); some dedications in the sanctuary may have borneinscriptions suggesting that the Argonauts set them up (Cole1984:68–69). Herakles was so eager for Eleusinian initia-tion that Demeter herself established the lesser mysteries inorder to qualify him for the rites—and so provided a mythicfoundation for a new stage of the rites, located at Athensitself (Diodorus Siculus 4.14; Colomo 2004). Porphyry andIamblichus, writing in the third century C.E., both claimedthat Pythagoras, the great Presocratic sage of the sixth cen-tury B.C.E., became an initiate into the mysteries of CretanZeus, Samothrace, and Leibethra, among others (Porphyry,Vita Pythagorae17; Iamblichus,de Vita Pythagorica146).Funerary inscriptions for historical persons show the sameenthusiasm for initiation into many different mysteries, anachievement listed along with civic offices and family name(Cole 1984; Dimitrova 2008). Dedications at the sanctuariesreflect the desire to leave a permanent memorial of one’sinitiation: the cheapest are inscriptions scratched onto pot-tery; the more elaborate inscriptions in stone offer lists ofindividuals initiated together, or declare the dedication ofstatues and buildings to the gods.Theseriousness withwhichinitiates adheredtotheprac-tice of secrecy complicates both the textual and material ev-idence available for investigation. Ancient authors pointedlydeclined to reveal anything about the rites: of Samothrace,Herodotus wrote coyly, “anyone who has been initiated intothe rites of the Kabeiroi...knows what I mean” (Herodotus2.51); Apollonius of Rhodes bid farewell “to the island itself,and to the daimones who dwell therein, whose rites it is notlawful for us to sing” (Apollonius of Rhodes,Argonautica1.915–921).The mysteries were also described in terms suggestingtranscendence of the limitations of human speech: cosmic vi-sions, ecstatic experiences, terror and confusion, and emerg-ing from the rites as a stranger to one’s self. Aristotle is saidto have claimed that one did not learn the mysteries but expe-rienced them (Aristotle fr. 15 Rose; Burkert 1987:89–116).These experiences are not depicted, but signaled throughthe iconography specific to the gods of the rites. Vase paint-ings depict the white clothing stipulated for Orpheus’ ad-herents; the torches that lighted the Eleusinian initiations;the wreaths, fawnskins, and ivy-wrapped, pinecone-toppedrods of Bacchic rites. The latter appear as well on sarcophagi,reflecting the promises specific to Bacchic initiates for a bet-ter afterlife, and are mentioned in the gold plates inscribedwith instructions for the netherworld that have been foundin burials in Sicily, southern Italy, and Macedonia (Burk-ert 1985:276–295). These materials offer relatively directcorrespondence between the textual and material evidencefor the cults, even though the texts—both epigraphic andliterary—are elliptical, poetic, and evocative, and the im-ages highly condensed. Samothracian data, as we shall see,exceed these in obscurity.Samothrace: Location and CultSamothrace is located in the far northeastern Aegean,at the very edge of the Greek-speaking world (Figure 5.1).The island consists mostly of Mt. Phengari, which at 5,459feet is the tallest peak in the region and a valuable beacon forsailors, who made great use of such landmarks in navigatingthese waters (Lehmann 1998:15–17; Pliny,NH4.73). His-torically and culturally it was linked to the Thracian main-land, 29 nautical miles to the north, and the Anatolian coastto the east, visible from the top of Mt. Phengari. Thracianlanguage lingers in island toponyms, and settlements fromthe 11th and 9th centuries B.C.E. show Thracian architec-tural and burial customs (Graham 2002:248–249). DiodorusSiculus, writing in the first century B.C.E., noted that the lan-guage of the indigenes was used in the cult even in his day,nearly five centuries after the Greeks arrived on the island(Diodorus Siculus 5.47.14–16). These sixth-century Greeksettlers seem to have mingled peacefully with the local pop-ulation, who were already celebrating feasts in the area ofthe sanctuary. The Greeks established a city on the north"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"54Sandra BlakelyFigure 5.1. Sites mentioned in text: Samothrace, Lemnos, and sites around the AegeanSea. Map by N. Caselli.shore of the island, facing the mainland opposite and at arelatively small remove from the island’s main harbor. By theend of the fifth century B.C.E. they had established a seriesof settlements on the Thracian mainland, which seem to havebeen vital for their economic survival: Samothrace offeredlimited arable land and but one poor harbor. These mainlandsettlements took advantage of the thin strip of arable landalong the coast and the capacity to connect seafaring trafficmoving along the Thracian coast with overland routes con-trolled by Odryssian Thracians. Samothracians have beencalled, in modern historiography, the “pioneers of Odrys-sian trade.” Their facility with sea travel provided an idealpartner for the Thracians, who were characteristically dis-inclined to maritime traffic. The economic prosperity of theSamothracian Greeks was short lived: after a floruit in thesixth century B.C.E., the settlement declined in prosperity,as their decreasing responsibilities on the Athenian tributelists reflect (Archibald 1998:146–147; Funke 1999).The fortunes of the cult, however, increased steadilyfrom the fourth century B.C.E. onward, as Hellenisticprinces and foreign dynasts competed with each other in themagnificence of their votives (Cole 1984:16–25; Lehmann1998:24–25). The impetus for this internationalization wasthe Macedonian royal house, for whom Samothrace providedan analogue to Athens’ mysteries at Eleusis. The royals hadand advertised strong dynastic and personal connectionsto the site: Plutarch records that Philip and Olympias, theparents of Alexander the Great, met during their initiationinto the mysteries (Plutarch,Alexander2.2); Arsino ̈e soughtasylum on the island when she fled from Ptolemy Keraunos(Justin,Epitome24.3.9). These connections transformed thesanctuary into a locus for competitive display and a showcasefor some of the most elaborate and innovative monumentsof Hellenistic architecture. The Rotunda of Arsino ̈eisthelargest closed round building known in Greek architecture;the entrance to the sanctuary, the Propylon, represents the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace55first exterior use of the Corinthian column and is amongthe earliest of the barrel-vaulted tunnels in Greek archi-tectural history (Boyd 1978; Lehmann 1998:62–70, 94–96;McCredie 1965:118 n. 51, 1979:2–6). These monumentshelped transform the Samothracian cult into one of the mostprominent mysteries of the ancient Mediterranean world,second only to Eleusis in stature.Unlike Eleusis, however, the identity of the gods ofthe rites is difficult to discern. Greek authors from the fifthcentury B.C.E. onward identified the Samothracian godsas Kabeiroi. The Kabeiroi were daimones, divine creaturesless powerful than Olympian gods but greater than ordinarymortals. Greek writers use the term “daimon” to describedemoted gods of previous generations, the spirits of thedead, the individual conscience inside every man, and thedivine protectors of cities and territories (Smith 1978). TheKabeiroi vary in form from one site to another, assuming theform appropriate for the followers of the dominant male de-ity wherever they appear (Blakely 2006:17–52). On Imbrosthey were associated with Hermes, the god whose imagewas stamped on the island’s coins (Hemberg 1950:37–43);on Lemnos they were sons and attendants of Hephaistos,who landed on the island after his expulsion from Olympus(Blakely 2006:50). Kabeiroi had a long history in ritual prac-tice on the islands of the northeastern Aegean. They were thegods of the mysteries on Lemnos and Imbros, Samothrace’stwo closest neighbors in the Thracian sea; Strabo identifiedthese three islands as the places most famous for their wor-ship (Hemberg 1950:3–43, 160–170; Strabo 10.3.7). Theironly sanctuary on the Greek mainland is located at Boio-tian Thebes, the city founded, in legend, by the Phoenicianprince Kadmos after he was initiated at Samothrace and tookHarmonia, a princess of the island, as his bride (K ̈uhr2006:91–106). Lemnos and Imbros figured prominently inAthenian international interests as outposts on the Athenianshipping route into the Black Sea, one of the city’s mostimportant sources of grain (Stroud 1998). Athens took pos-session of both islands at the end of the sixth century B.C.E.,by which time the Lemnian cult was already well estab-lished. The Athenians modified the rites by introducing ele-ments from their own ritual practice, but they maintained theKabeiroi as a deep-rooted regional tradition (Beschi 2000;Graham 2002:249–255).The Samothracian cult was different from the rites onLemnos and Imbros in its association with other daimones aswell—Kouretes, Korybantes, and Idaian Daktyloi (Hemberg1950:16–18; Lehmann 1958:63–67, 74–79). Like theKabeiroi, these are corporate groups; the distinctions amongthem are often unclear, and they are frequently combinedwith each other in texts that have nothing to do with Samoth-race. Their greatest commonality is their association withpre-Greek cultural strata. They were positioned mytholog-ically at the transition from one divine generation to an-other and legendarily at the encounter between Greeks andpre-Greeks. Strabo, writing in the first century B.C.E./C.E.,remarked that his contemporaries confused the daimoneswith ethnic groups the Greeks encountered in contests overterritory (Strabo 10.3.7). Their territorial ownership maybe articulated in their birth from local divinities; alterna-tively, they may be born directly from the earth itself ormay watch over the men who are. A black-figure vase fromthe sanctuary of the Kabeiroi at Boiotian Thebes shows theKabeiros stretched out on a dining couch, observing a fig-ure labeled “first man” (Pratolaos) emerge from the ground.A lyric fragment, possibly of the sixth century B.C.E., re-counts the various loci where the earth gave birth: it listsKouretes at Mt. Ida, Korybantes in Phrygia, Eleusis at thelocal field of Raras, and the “beautiful child Lemnos, bornin the unspeakable rites of the Kabeiros” (Page 1962:522–523, no. 985). The daimones also figure frequently in theeuhemeristic tradition, literature that recounted the first in-ventors of such essential arts as armor, beekeeping, musicalrhythms, and written laws. Daktyloi were associated partic-ularly with metallurgy, Korybantes with ecstatic dances inarms, Kouretes with young male warrior bands who, in rit-ual practice, provided the points of identification for youngmen coming of age. The daimones thus signal a histori-cal era fuzzily located at “the dawn of time,” as well as anontological category that hovers between mortal and divine.None of the daimones appear in the material evidencefrom Samothrace. Inscriptions refer to the gods of the ritesonly asTheoiorTheoi Megaloi—a euphemism meaning“great gods”—and there is no iconographic indication oftheir presence (Cole 1984; Hemberg 1950:49–131). Whatthe site does manifest, however, is an extraordinarily highnumber of the ritual installations that, in the Greek rit-ual vocabulary, are associated with archaic ritual practiceand earth-dwelling powers. These structures are maintainedthroughout the long history of the sanctuary, installed andcarefully reinstalled as the site’s buildings are constructed,destroyed, and replaced. These are combined with highlyinnovative materializations of the site’s ritual and legendaryhistory. These affirm a sense of habitus on site that lay be-yond the experience of any individual initiate; they alsoparallel the semantic range of the daimones who remaininvisible in epigraphic and iconographic form.The Samothracian sanctuary is located on the northernshore of the island, immediately outside the walls of the an-cient town (Figure 5.2). Despite this proximity, it is difficultto investigate how the cult functioned vis-`a-vis civic iden-tity.

Thebasileus’name was used to date someof the inscription lists and decrees found in the sanctuary(Cole 1984:36–40).Four physical structures and types—the circular areaknown as the Theatral circle; archaising ritual installations inthe form of offering pits and sacred stones; the Hall of ChoralDancers; and a faux Mycenaean doorway—materialize theritual and fictive Samothracian past. Initiates entered the sitethrough an elaborate gate, the Propylon (Figure 5.3, #26).First dedicated in the early third century B.C.E., this struc-ture was part of the physical experience of transitioning fromprofane to sacred space from that time onward. The Propy-lon spans the first of two stream beds that served as naturalboundaries for the sacred area of the site. Between them liethe buildings dedicated to ritual practice, as per the normsof Greek architecture and the epigraphic evidence; those tothe west of the second stream were used for post-initiationentertainment, lodging, and votive display. Initiates wouldfirst enter the Theatral circle (Figure 5.3, #25). This is apaved circular area approximately nine meters in diameter,set into a natural basin on the slope of the hill. Five con-centric steps surround the circle, steps too narrow to havebeen seats, but likely places for initiates to stand and ob-serve the proceedings that took place in the center (Figure5.4). The circle was first built in the fifth century B.C.E.;by the end of that century, a series of monumental bases,apparently for life-size bronze statues, appeared in connec-tion with the structure. More than 20 bases have now beenfound. Their placement on the topmost steps of the circlemeant that initiates were literally surrounded by life-size im-ages. The identity of the images remains unknown: neitherthe statues themselves nor inscriptions naming them havesurvived (Wescoat 2006). Analogy with other sites suggestslegendary founders and some of the numerous Greek heroeswho became initiates—Jason and the Argonauts, Odysseusand Menelaos, Orpheus, or Dardanos, the legendary founderof Troy. Mortal, historical figures are also likely, particu-larly the Macedonian patrons who chose in this way to makethemselves part of the physical reality of every initiatorygroup. These individuals would tower over the new initi-ates by virtue of the height of the statue bases, and wouldpartially surround them as well, literally bracketing the newinitiates in material forms that embodied the history of rit-ual in this space. Clues as to the nature of the rituals them-selves come from one archaeological find and one textualsource.

Six build-ings in the heart of the sanctuary—the Anaktoron (Figure5.3, #23), the Arsinoeion (#20), and the Orthostate structurethat preceded both of them, the Altar Court (#14), the Hallof Choral Dancers (#17), and the Hieron (#15)—offer anabundance of structures that are chthonic in focus, that is,dedicated to earth-dwelling powers. These are offering pits,shafts, and channels that allow offerings to be poured intothe earth and rock altars. The persistence of these formsthrough the site’s history materializes the history of ritualpractices that, in the Greek ritual vocabulary, evoke archaicand prehistoric patterns (Cole 1984:28; Donohue 1988:121–150, 177–194, 219–231; Gaifman 2010). These semanticsare consonant with the chthonic, archaic, and pre-Greek na-ture of the Kabeiroi; thebothroihave intriguing parallelsin the Kabeirion at Boiotian Thebes (Schachter 2003). Theymay also reflect the pre-Greek history specific to this region,as they are prevalent in the Thracian cults of the mainland(Archibald 1999:459).The architectural topography of the Anaktoron, Arsi-noeion, and Orthostate structure is complex. Two prior con-structions lie beneath the remains of the imperial-periodAnaktoron and the third-century-B.C.E. Arsinoeion. Theearliest of these is a low terrace, 2.5 meters wide, retainedby a wall of field stones, visible in the plan as the eastern-most wall beneath the circular Arsinoeion (Figure 5.5).

Thiswall was eventually incorporated into the fourth-centuryOrthostate structure, a rectangular building of 30.5 metersnorth–south and 12 meters east–west, whose remains arevisible beneath the southern portion of the Anaktoron andthe circular walls of the Arsinoeion. Two cross-walls di-vided this structure into three square sections, which mayhave been open-air rather than roofed. The southernmost ofthe three squares yielded evidence of a sacrificial pit, its toplevel with the floor, constructed of clay and small stones. Thepit extends five feet into the earth and was topped by a domed"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace59Figure 5.6.

Figure 5.6 isa cross-section of the Arsinoeion; the shaft and dome arethe features closest to the right-hand wall and are positioned15 meters to the left of that wall. The shaft cuts deeper intothe earth than any of the other structures. This shaft, whichmay have been framed by boards, gave access on its north-ern side to a piece of marble positioned in the bottom, ontowhich liquid offerings were poured (Lehmann 1950:11–12;McCredie 1979:28–32). This concern for libation tochthonic powers persists in the later buildings in this portionof the site.The Anaktoron was built over a fourth-century struc-ture in nearly the same position; the only wall of this ear-lier structure visible in the plan lies to the west of theAnaktoron’s western wall (Figure 5.5) (Wescoat 2010:22).The Anaktoron, like the Orthostate structure, is divided intothree sections: visitors entered from the three doors on thewestern side; a grandstand supported on wooden scaffoldingon the eastern and northern side provided privileged viewingareas for those witnessing the rite. The southeastern cornerof the building contained an ovenlike structure, square onthe outside and circular inside; a threshold, too narrow toallow entrance but wide enough for a person to stand on,offered access. The interior has a recess that separates itsupper from its lower part. Lehmann suggested that this sup-ported a lid that was removed in the course of rituals to giveaccess to the stone inside it, which seems to have been theobject of libations (Lehmann 1940:334).The third-century rotunda dedicated by Queen Arsino ̈eII manifests the same conservative pattern vis-`a-vis chthonicconcerns. Approximately three meters to the right of its dooris a deep, nearly square shaft, 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters,lined with stones, which runs down to the natural soil ofthe Arsinoeion’s substructure. This shaft yielded a quantityof sheep’s bones and several rams’ horns, typical offeringsfor underworld gods (Lehmann 1951:9–11; McCredie et al.1992:239–241). Nearby is an outcropping of blue-green por-phyry, and there is a smaller rock of the same kind, witha flattened surface, on its northeastern side. Both are sur-rounded by fine Classical period pavement, made of thesame material as the Orthostate structure. Lehmann identi-fied this stone and its flattened counterpart as a sacred rockand an altar that received libations (Lehmann 1951:3–5, 7,1998:72). The same combination of natural rock and pavingoccurred inside the area of the Altar Court (Figure 5.3, #14),where a natural outcropping of purple and green porphyrysome three meters high served as the sacrificial place inthe sixth century B.C.E. A 3.8-meter portion of the claypipe that drained the sacrificial liquids is still in situ; yellowtufa fragments suggest a floor of the same material as thataround the rock altar outside the Arsinoeion. A built altarcovered this space in the second half of the fourth centuryB.C.E., retaining the sacred nature of the space though notthe archaic form of the altar itself (Lehmann and Spittle1964:109–116).The same pattern of conservatism, conscious archaiz-ing, and attention to chthonic powers characterizes the Hallof Choral Dancers and the Hieron. The Hall of ChoralDancers (Figure 5.3, #17) was the earliest and largest ofthe sanctuary’s buildings and consisted of an elegant Ionicpropylon fronting a building that was divided into two aisles.Set into the marble floor of the western aisle were twoboth-roi,or libation pits (Marconi 2010:124 and n. 25). Theseinstallations were present in the seventh-century-B.C.E. ver-sion of the building and were reconstructed with the restof the building in ca. 340 B.C.E., very likely as the giftof Philip II of Macedon (Lehmann 1998:78; Lehmann andSpittle 1982:271–272). Lehmann notes that this kind of in-terior installation for offerings occurs almost exclusively inArchaic and earlier structures. The fourth-century building"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"60Sandra BlakelyFigure 5.7. Detail of frieze from Hall of Choral Dancers. Phyl-lis W.

The maidens have the features, proportions, and gaitof figures appropriate to their date, but the stylized folds intheir garments and their swallow-tailed mantles allude to theremote past (Figure 5.7; Hadzi 1982; Lehmann and Spittle1982:3–12; Marconi 2010).The Hellenistic Hieron (Figure 5.3, #15) dominates theview of the sanctuary; it is the latest of three structureson this location, begun in about 325 B.C.E. and completed175 years later (Lehmann et al. 1969b:51–132). Aneschara,an offering pit for burned offerings, which shows signs oflong exposure to fire, occupied the center forepart of thefloor in the nave. The floor of the Roman period building,ca. 200 C.E., covered this pit; two square depressions inthe limestone pavement, close to the western parapet, sug-gest that portable hearths replaced its function in this period(Lehmann et al. 1969a:128–129, 151). Marble benches lin-ing the walls repeated the interior configuration of the Anak-toron. Unique to this building is a semicircular apse at thesouthern end of the cella. The shape was invisible to visitorsboth inside and outside the building: doors blocked the viewfrom the cella, and the building’s rectangular exterior betraysno sign of the curved walls within. A conelike roof over thisarea further created a cavelike space. Curved apses are com-mon in Geometric and Archaic cult buildings, but extremelyrare later; this apse was maintained through all three phasesof the Hieron’s history (Lehmann et al. 1969a:155 and nn.4–5). Inside the apse, a “choir” section of two steps sur-rounded the semicircular floor; the floor itself may haveconsisted simply of beaten earth in the Hellenistic period,but was paved in the Roman. A large half-oval hole is carvedinto one of the Roman period floor blocks. The block’s open-ing is roughly picked in two layers and may have supporteda lid comparable to that proposed for the structure in thesoutheastern corner of the Anaktoron. Its shape echoes thecavernous shape of the apse itself; the opening grants accessto a large chunk of red porphyry bedrock, which is at itshighest point in this area (Lehmann 1950:6, 1951:20–27;McCredie 1979:33).Two further data demonstrate the materialization of thedistant and pre-Greek past at the Samothracian site. Onthe western hill of the sanctuary, an area occupied by thetheater, thestoaor covered walkway, and numerous hon-orary dedications, the retaining wall for Hellenistic room10 includes a structure identified as an Archaistic niche(Figure 5.3, #9). This is a faux doorway built in the styleof Mycenaean tombs of the Bronze Age Greek mainland,consisting of a trilithon door topped by the relieving triangletypical of Mycenaean engineering. The door leads nowhere,but evokes the prehistoric and heroic past appropriate forDardanos, the legendary founder of the rites and of the cityof Troy, and for the Argonauts, whose voyage and initia-tion took place, in mythological chronology, even beforethe Trojan war (Alcock 1997:21–22, 29; McCredie 1974).At a less monumental level, ceramic inscriptions evoke thepre-Greek stratum of the site and offer unusually strongcorrelation between the literary and the material evidencefor the cult. Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first centuryB.C.E., claimed that the Samothracians used many wordsof the autochthonous, pre-Greek owners of the island intheir rites (Diodorus Siculus 5.47.14–16). Over 70 ceramicinscriptions from the sixth to the fourth centuries B.C.E.are written in what has been identified as the language ofthe Thracian substrate, now confirmed through a substan-tial corpus of ceramic graffiti from the temple of Apollo inMesembria, ancient Zone, on the Thracian mainland. Thesacred language of the rites thus corresponds to the lan-guage of the pre-Greek indigenes—the historical correlatesof the mythological daimones evoked in the textual record(Bonfante 1955; Brixhe 2006). The cheapness and quan-tity of the offerings suggest a ritual experience available toeven the humblest initiate; that Diodorus records the prac-tice some three centuries after the latest of the inscriptionssuggests the longevity of the practice."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace61These data from the site—ritual installations, architec-ture, iconography, and inscriptions—suggest a materializa-tion of two aspects of the site’s history. The point of entranceto the sacred space, chthonic offerings, and the use of anarchaic language embody a history of ritual praxis; now-missing statues and a Mycenaean-style doorway evoke thelegendary and mythological personae whose actions con-stituted the narrative of the site’s past. Visitors who couldafford the cost of a stone inscription had the opportunity toadd their own initiation to this ongoing narrative, and theydid so increasingly as the cult increased in prestige over time.These inscriptions are simultaneously textual and monumen-tal; approached through sociological models of secrecy, theyoffer fresh insight into the absence of the daimones from thematerial record of the cult. Initiate lists appear both on andoff site on Samothrace, carved on free-standing pillars, onstele, and on blocks fitted into the walls of buildings. Theydate from the second century B.C.E. to as late as the thirdcentury C.E. The lists reveal a significant amount about theinitiates themselves. People were often initiated in groupscoming from the same city or family, making up the retinueof an official, or traveling together on the same ship (Cole1984:40). The names of some 700 initiates are preserved,along with the cities from which they came, some indica-tions of their date of initiation, and some reflections on theiroccupations; they are usually ordinary citizens, even slaves,and more often men than women. The stones also specifywhether an initiate achieved only the first level of initiation,known asmyesis,or the second and higher form,epopteia(Dimitrova 2008:241–248).What the inscriptions do not record is the name of thegods of the rites. They share this characteristic with theinscriptions on major dedications, set up by the wealthyand powerful, and the decrees relevant to the festivals heldon the site, which begin in the third century B.C.E. Thegods of the rites are simply referred to asTheoi,“gods,” orTheoi Megaloi,“great gods.”Theoi Megaloiis not uniqueto Samothrace but is familiar in Greek ritual practice as aeuphemism for gods whose names should not be spoken(Cole 1984:126, nn. 475, 478; Hemberg 1950; Henrichs1991). On Samothrace, the term appears only on dedica-tions made by foreign dynasts after the death of Alexanderthe Great (Cole 1984:1–2; Lehmann 1960:27). The datesfor these opaque titles are important: they coincide with thecenturies in which the sanctuary was firmly established asa locus for competitive display, and gifts to the gods cre-ated and reflected the international prestige of the giver.This encourages us to consider the euphemism in light ofthe cult’s capacity to generate prestige. The anthropologicalmodels examined previously reflect the capacity of secrecyto create status and signal social privilege; the degree of se-crecy can be increased over time in order to further bolsteran institution’s prestige. This pattern appears in other ritualcontexts in the ancient Mediterranean: practitioners of magicraised their own status by restricting access to their practices(Lamberton 1995); the requirements for ritual secrecy atEleusis increased over time in order to bolster the promi-nence of the cult (Bremmer 1995). The stone inscriptionsthemselves represent a new mechanism for signaling and soincreasing the site’s prestige—they made accessible, even tothe initiates who could not afford great statues or votive mon-uments, a permanent presence at the site that transcendedthe temporal boundaries of their initiation. The euphemistictitles further increased the prestige of initiation by enrollingthe gods in the familiar ritual category of those whose namescould not be spoken. Literary sources that precede the in-scriptions by two centuries identify the gods of the rites asKabeiroi. The site’s distinctive conservatism and the persis-tence of the gods on Lemnos and on Imbros make it unlikelythat the daimones fell from use over time, but very likelythat, fitted with a new title, they augmented the status of therites through the social dynamics of secrecy.Secrecy, Semantics, and Small FindsIf the daimones of the textual tradition are thus ad-mitted to the analysis of the rites, the material token ofthe cult—magnetized iron finger rings—takes on a new se-mantic density that reflects the theoretical outlines of theaesthetics of secrecy. We learn of the rings first from the Ro-man author Lucretius who, in the first century B.C.E., wrotethat a Samothracian ring leaped as if it wished to flee, andiron filings went mad, when a magnetic stone was broughtclose to them (Lucretius,DRN6.1043–1047). The traditionhad a long life: Pliny, in the second century, claimed theywere made of iron but covered in gold (Pliny,NH32.33);Isidorus, four centuries later, knew of them as gold ringswith iron heads (Isidorus,Origines19.32.5); as late as the12th century C.E., Samothrace was one of several placeswhere magnets were said to have been invented (Etymolog-icum Magnums.v.magnetis;Zenobius IV.22).The first iron rings were found on the Samothraciansite in 1950; 32 have now been recovered. Nineteen of thesehave an identical form, a large flat bezel that shows no signsof holding a stone but could bear an image or inscription.All but four of the rings were found in excavation fill andso elude positive dating. The exceptions, from the necrop-olis, are two examples from the Archaic period, sixth toearly fifth century B.C.E.; one from the fourth/third cen-tury B.C.E.; and one from ca. 200 B.C.E. (Cole 1985:30, n.238; Dusenbery 1988:986, 1000–1001; Lehmann 1998:30)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"62Sandra BlakelyThe style of the bezeled rings may suggest a Ptolemaic date(332–30 B.C.E.). The majority of these came from the WestHill, an area that had no sacred buildings but structures ded-icated to votive display and the comforts of visitors. In thisarea were dining rooms, many coins, and astoayieldinginscriptions recording lists of initiates; it seems that this iswhere the initiates ate, slept, and perhaps purchased tokensof their initiation, the famous iron rings, to take home withthem (Lehmann 1998:104–107).Iron rings are not a rarity in the Greek world and ap-pear in temple inventories along with other goods dedicatedto the sanctuaries (Harris 1995:51; Payne et al. 1970:178,190; Raubitschek 1998:62). They bear no particular semi-otic weight in these contexts. In sacred laws, however, theallusive and metaphoric force of the form and the materialcome to the foreground. These prohibit the wearing, car-rying, or use of iron in the sanctuary or by its officials.Rationale for the restrictions suggests an archaizing sensi-bility, evoking a time when iron was not yet in commonuse, or the contemporary use of iron for weapons (Moraux1965:150; Triantaphyllopoulos 1980; W ̈achter 1910:115).Rings are more often prohibited than prescribed in sacredcontexts, possibly because of sacred laws that forbid anykind of knot or bond in the presence of the god (Eitrem1915:61–63; Hemberg 1950:110 n. 2; Plassart 1909:139;W ̈achter 1910:115). The use of an iron ring as a token ofa cult, acquired from the site itself, is surprising in light ofthese regulations. It would seem more appropriate for nonsa-cred contexts, in which jewelry, and particularly rings, had agreat deal of social work to do, communicating status, own-ership, affiliation, and identity (Calinescu 1996). The ringsof Samothrace would rank, at first observation, fairly low onthis communicative spectrum. They were made of a visuallyunremarkable and inexpensive metal, iron, which could bepolished to a suitable shine to provide a kind of poor man’ssilver. Nor were they famous for iconography or engraving.One evocatively engraved ring from the site, made of silver,bore a logo of two entwined snakes and two stars, the icono-graphic signals of Hermes, the alpha male of the island, andthe Dioskouroi, young male heroes frequently identified asthe gods of the rites (Figure 5.8; Lehmann 1940:355). Whilethis raises possibilities for iconography on the iron rings, thesurviving examples are too corroded to reveal any sign ofimages or indications of a band to hold a carved gemstone.What made the rings the signs of the site, however, wasnot merely their iron, but their magnetization. Magnetismoffered two pathways for the rings to represent the rites.The first is its potential to recall a moment of ritual actionand to stand in metonymous relationship with the islanditself. Noting the tradition that magnetism was discoveredon Samothrace, Cole proposed that the stones that receivedFigure 5.8. Samothracian silver ring showing snakes and stars.Drawing after Lehmann 1940:fig. 39, by M. Luttrell. Cour-tesy Archaeological Institute of America/American Journal ofArchaeology.ritual attention represented lodestones and that a demon-stration of magnetism could have been part of the ritualsequence (Cole 1984:30). Plato’s metaphor of divine inspi-ration (Plato,Ion533d) moving along a chain of iron ringslike a magnetic force suggests that the rings would connectthe initiates to the force of the island’s goddess. Lehmannproposed that this goddess was analogous to Anatolian god-desses celebrated through stone altars and chthonic rites,appropriate for the island’s cultural connections to the east(Lehmann 1950:8–11). Rings, charged through the appar-ently magical force of the island’s lodestones, would thendemonstrate the bond between the goddess, the initiates,and the island itself.The metaphoric dimensions of magnetism support amodel more consonant with the complexity of Samothra-cian myths, anthropological models for secrecy, and thecapacity of symbols to reflect the structure of rituals as awhole. Magnetism was widely noticed, but not understood,in Mediterranean antiquity. Texts from the Presocratics ofthe sixth century B.C.E. to the church fathers of the sixthcentury C.E. reflect energetic debate about its nature; the the-ories fall into two general categories. The first began withEmpedocles (DK31 A 89), who proposed that magnetismwas the manifestation of pores and emanations, invisible tothe human eye, which let one body exert power over another.The second starts with Thales, who equated magnetism withanimation: magnets were said to have a soul, hands and feet,gender, volition, and a need to “eat” or be nourished (DK11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace63A 22; Pliny,NH36.25; Porphyry,de Abstinentia4.20.264–265). The conception of a magnet as a stone with a soul, ora daimonic force, was long lived; as late as the fourth cen-tury C.E., the ceasing of magnetic power was described asthe stone “breathing its last” (ekpnein) (Ausonius,MagnusMoselle316). Folk customs that claimed that the daimonesfeared iron encouraged the use of the metal for charms tokeep daimones at bay (Hopfner 1974:para. 596). Church fa-thers described the use of magnets to persuade the gullible ofthe presence of invisible, daimonic forces (Rufinus,Histo-riae ecclesiasicae1027.15–1028.1, Ps.-Prosper Aquitanus834C; Radl 1988:102, 106). These texts, nearly 1,000 yearsafter Plato’sIon,reflect the longevity of the concept thatmagnetism penetrated the divide between the visible andinvisible worlds.The metaphoric range of magnetism is put to ritual workin the context of magic and medicine. This is also a realmwith abundant textual and material evidence for rings astokens of ritual power (Bonner 1950; Hopfner 1974:para.580–581; Michel 2004). Gemstones appear most frequentlyin both the archaeological and textual evidence, but the ring’smetal band carried metaphoric weight as well, and ringsmade of metal only, often iron, appear frequently in theliterature (Eitrem 1915:63). Ritual preparations augmentedand accessed the powers inherent in the materials. Theserituals are described in terms appropriate to mystery ini-tiations, as the rings are purified, sanctified, and initiated:the rituals included the inscribing of words and images, butnot invariably (Halleux and Schamp 1985:167, 328; Parca1996:222 n. 15; Socrates and Dionysius,Peri Lithon28).Writing on preserved artifacts shows signs of deliberate ob-scurity, appropriate for the concern to maintain secrecy inmagical rituals (Betz 1995).As wearable power created in secret rites, these magi-cal amulets and rings offer an appealing comparison for theSamothracian tokens: they represent a pan-Mediterraneancultural category, suitable for a cult whose international-ism expanded over time. Applications of magnetism be-yond Samothrace demonstrate the rhetorical principles be-hind their ritual effectiveness. Magnets offered metaphors ofvision, being the stone that exerted an invisible power, andattraction, as it drew things to itself. Magnetic amulets letthe user see all he wished, view the future, or peer into thecosmos (Cyranides1.7, 1.21, 1.24; Radl 1988:64). Magneticpowder, strewn on glowing coals, could create the halluci-nation that a house was falling in, causing potential thievesto flee (Damigeron,de Virtutibus Lapidum30). Galen andPliny describe the uses of magnets to cure diseases of theeye and remedy problems with vision (Galen,de Naturalibusfacultatibus12.204; Pliny,NH36). The magnet’s powers todraw things together suited it for love charms as well as po-etry, and by extension to tests of fidelity: a magnet placedunder the bed pillow would make a faithful wife embraceher husband but would cast a cheating spouse out onto thefloor. The same power made it a metaphor for persuasion,so that magnetic amulets ensured success for public speak-ers, whether they addressed prayers to the gods or orationsto fellow citizens (Gregory Theologos,Poemata Theolog-ica2.1.244, 2.2, 2.29; Halleux and Schamp 1985:153–155;Michel 2004:203–207; Orphica oftlineLithica,Kerygmata11). Medical applications for the stone that could draw thingstogether include remedies for infertility, as the magnet coulddraw and hold the male seed to the womb; it could alsohold blood inside as needed and so work to stop abdominalbleeding (Hippocrates,Diseases of Women243; Soranus,Gynecology3.10).No ancient authors explain why it is that magnetismshould be a sign of Samothracian initiation; the logic of theimagery is apparent, however, in the plurality of opinionsthemselves. Despite the energy of the debates regarding themagnet, agreement eluded ancient philosophers and scien-tists, and magnetism remained as inscrutable as it was invis-ible. Cicero, writing in the first century B.C.E., noted thatmagnetism was a rhetorical trope for the enigmatic (Cicero,de DivinationeI.39.86, 7.13, 9.16). Wearers of Samothra-cian rings could thus manifest the power of their tokens, butthey could not offer any explanation for it. This makes therings an ideal response to the aesthetics of secrecy: the pos-session of a secret must be announced, but the secret itselfmaintained, if the secret is to have any social efficacy. Thetraditions that saw magnetism as a daimon in the stone sug-gest an even more complex semantic level, which connectsthe rings to the intricate mythological traditions of the site.Among the many daimones associated with Samothracewere a group called the Idaian Daktyloi. These weregoetes,magicians with particular powers to intervene between theliving and the dead. In the fourth century B.C.E., the histo-rian Ephoros wrote that they came to Samothrace from theirhome on Trojan Mt. Ida, bringing spells, mysteries, and ini-tiations; they taught Orpheus himself, who then introducedmysteries to Greece (Ephoros,FGH70 F 104). They werefamous for the invention of iron; their group name, “Fin-gers of Ida,” inspired endless punning in the ancient world,including the proposal that it referred to the fingers of thecraftsman (Pherekydes,FGH3 F 47; Phoronis,PEGfr. 2;Sophokles,TGFfr. 337; Stesimbrotos,FGH107 F 12a,12 b; Strabo 10.3.22). Three of the Daktylic brothers boreovertly metallurgical names: Damnameneus, “hammerer,”Akmon, “anvil,” and Kelmis, who was metonymic for ironitself. Kelmis appears in an Alexandrian proverb, “Kelmisin iron”; behind the proverb was a well-known story that thisDaktyl offended the great mother goddess. As punishment,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"64Sandra Blakelyhe was locked up inside Mt. Ida and turned into iron (Zeno-bius 4.80). Clement of Alexandria characterized his fate asfratricide and suggested that the tale was the heart of theSamothracian mysteries (Clement of Alexandria,Protrepti-cus2.14–16). This Mt. Ida was also one of the places formagnetism’s discovery: legends told of a Trojan shepherdnamed Magnes who, pasturing his flocks on the mountainslopes, found that a magnetic force seized his iron shoe nailsand the tip of his walking staff (Pliny,NH36.127). This asso-ciation with magnetite takes more anthropomorphic form inthe figure of Herakles the Daktyl. This god was celebrated inBoiotian Hyettos, one of the rare Greek centers for magnetitemining; his cult statue there took the form of an unworkedstone, very likely a piece of the local magnetite, associ-ated with healing powers (Etienne and Knoepfler 1976:180;Gruppe 1906:778; Wilamowitz-Moellendorf 1959:34 n. 67).Diodorus Siculus reports that women in Crete and the Pelo-ponnesos make incantations and amulets in his name, be-cause of his status as a magician and his skill in initia-tions; Grotanelli notes that these amulets may have bornehis image (Diodorus Siculus 5.64.6–7; Pausanias 9.27.8;Grotanelli 1972). Since magnetite was known asHerak-leia lithos,“the Herakleian stone,” as well asmagnetis(Etienne and Knoepfler 1976:178–179), it is equally likelythat the amulets were made of magnetite itself. Their use bywomen would be appropriate for the stone’s responsivenessto women’s concerns, including colic, difficult childbirth,and infertility (Blakely 2006:228–239).This association between the Daktyloi and magnetismcasts light on Kelmis, the daimon trapped inside iron.Mythologically, he is an appropriate image of the daimonictheory of magnetism. As a strategy of secrecy, he reflects theprinciple of containment, analogous to the breath of Bembaancestors or relics hidden in their statues. As an image of per-formance, the rings charged with his force find ethnographicanalogy in the need to activate hidden powers—driving a nailthrough the Zaire figures or providing a song for the Kongonkisi.The rings are artifacts with an implicit performativemoment, as suggested in Lucretius’ description of Samoth-racian rings and iron filings placed in a bronze bowl andexposed to a magnet to demonstrate the force of magnetism(Lucretius,DRN6.1043–1047). Such demonstrations wouldreveal at once both the hidden power of the ring’s materialand the initiatory status of its owner.In magic, iron, magnetism, medicine, and amulets, theDaktyloi bring together key semantic elements of the ironrings that were the signs of the cult. These connections, how-ever, are neither unambiguous nor immediately clear. Noiconography clarifies their relationship to the island; theyare far more associated with sites other than Samothrace;and they were not the only supernaturally powerful inven-tors of iron but shared that claim with Cyclopes, Chalybes,and other legendary races. They also share their associationwith the rites with the Kabeiroi, Kouretes, and Korybantes—a situation Strabo dismissed as confusion and attributed tothe fact that the groups were essentially interchangeable.The Daktyloi’s intricate correlation to the semantics of therings, however, suggests a more purposeful strategy for thishyperabundance. The ritual categories the daimones char-acteristically fill offer one of the few distinctions amongthem. The Daktyloi are magicians; the Kabeiroi are patronsof mystery initiations; Kouretes and Korybantes are patronsof the armed dance and most often blended with each otherfor that reason. This dance is rooted in the myth of their birthfrom the earth as full-grown, fully armed warriors, in order todance around the infant Zeus and so protect him from his fa-ther’s cannibalism (Blakely 2006:40–44). In ritual contexts,such dances answered a narratological need: Lucian, in thesecond century C.E., wrote of “dancing out the mysteries”(Lucian,On the Dance15). These distinctions among thedaimones suggest that their combined presence on the islandwas occasioned less by their interchangeability than by theircapacity to articulate discrete aspects of the ritual sequenceitself. That the daimones of the island’s myths reflect on thestructure of the rites resonates with the ethnographic evi-dence that the rites constitute the secret itself—which hasno independent propositional content. Samothrace’s mytho-logical layers, reflecting on its own structures, would remainopaque to those who had not experienced initiation and un-spoken by those who had.ConclusionAnthropologies of secrecy encourage archaeologicalapproaches that take a local focus, explore myth seriously,and place the experiential and the cognitive side by side.Brought to Samothrace, these approaches have suggestedways in which the site, its inscriptions, and the small findsof iron rings reflect the relationship of secrecy to politicalpower and the paradoxical quality of its communication.These results, and through them the value of this particularmarriage of archaeology and anthropological theory, maybe judged on three criteria: coherence, the identification ofnew questions, and the contribution of archaeology to theanthropological discussion.The measure of coherence is not only the number of dis-parate elements brought together but also the identificationof strategies that are replicable and adaptable over time. OnSamothrace, the models of secrecy reveal a cogency amongthe physical and textual traditions of the site that lies out-side the comparison to Eleusis or the correlation between"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Power, Paradox, and the Great Gods of Samothrace65material and text. The restriction of entrance and lines ofsight, euphemisms, abbreviations, and a thematic repetitionof the archaic and the chthonic—in language, iconography,ritual installations, and architecture—resonate with themesand dynamics articulated in the site’s mythologies. Thesemyths enable the dynamics of secrecy through productiveambiguity and expanding polysemnity. They also, however,elude firm dating. The earliest evidence can never be con-sidered more than the date at which the myth took literaryform, and it often consists of abstracts and fragments fromworks now lost. In the study of living cultures, such concernsare irrelevant, as investigation is located in the present; inan archaeological project, they cannot be ignored. Howeverappealing the coherence that emerges from the combinationof myths and material evidence, its relevance in the site’shistorical context must be tested rather than assumed.The local focus of the investigation responds to thisneed. On Samothrace, the archaizing and chthonic focuscommon to the site and the myths is relevant to the eco-nomic concerns that characterized Greek interaction in theregion. Samothracian Greeks depended for their economicwell-being on successful mediation with the Thracians. Themyths evoke them through the narratological type of thedaimones who embody the pre-Greek inhabitants of the ter-ritory; the use of the Thracian language on site reinforcesthe concept. An encounter with pre-Greek daimones on theSamothracian site thus becomes a ritual embodiment of theencounters that enabled Greek commerce and settlement inthe region, responding to an economic concern as essen-tial and perennial as the agriculture celebrated at Eleusis.Graham has noted how the indigenous traditions of Lem-nos drew a response from the Athenian Greeks, who main-tained the rites but Atticized them with torches and noctur-nal celebrations; the result was a cult that articulated bothGreek and local traditions. Samothrace suggests an oppo-site strategy toward an analogous end, as the signals of in-digenous, archaic, and autochthonous culture were not onlymaintained through the life of the rites but even fabricatedin the later period of the site’s floruit (Graham 2002:254–255).This responsiveness to local need suggests a flexibilitythat is reflected as well in the cult’s ability to change overtime. These changes responded to the cult’s growing pres-tige, which at once demanded and benefited from increasedpublicity. Neither the euphemisms in the inscriptions northe tradition of magnetized rings appears in the earliest ev-idence for the cult; the relevant inscriptions do not appearuntil after the death of Alexander in 322 B.C.E., and thefirst evidence of the rings’ magnetism comes in the first-century-B.C.E. writings of Lucretius. While both inscrip-tions and rings reflect familiar Greek cultural conventions,their force as mechanisms of secrecy derives from the clus-ter of daimones who are unique to the Samothracian rites.These daimones are present in the earliest textual evidencefor the mysteries; it is their oblique materialization in theseannouncements of initiation that constitutes an innovation.The ritual secrecy that defines the cult as a mystery is thuslinked to innovation and change.Models of secrecy yield several new approaches,methodological and interpretive, for Samothrace. They clar-ify the limitations of comparison with Eleusis and suggestthe productive potential of a comparison with Lemnos—celebrating the same gods, situated in the same sea, andyet divergent enough in their histories to generate more-focused questions regarding the dynamics of the Samothra-cian cult itself. They challenge the traditional archaeologicalapproach to myth, which is limited to iconographic and epi-graphic manifestations on site, and propose a broader reachinto evidence from ritual types beyond the sanctuaries. At ahistorical level, the exclusion of the daimones from inscrip-tions problematized their semantic relevance for the cult. Tothe extent that the daimones may have enabled discussionof a perennial economic concern—the interaction betweenGreeks and non-Greeks—their inclusion in the analysis ofthe rites open further doors for investigation, which focuson the social and historical dynamics of human interactionrather than the contents of the secret itself.It is in the question of secrecy and change over time thatarchaeology’s capacity for contribution to the anthropologi-cal discussion is most clear. Archaeology is uniquely posi-tioned to measure the capacity for change over thelonguedur ́eeand in a supraregional context. For Samothrace, weare not limited to imagining the moment when Lucretius’informant demonstrated the powers of his Samothracianring—the kind of interpersonal exchange that is essentialfor the ethnographic experience. Samothrace responded tothe challenge of innovation by reinventing its own historyand by materializing the secrecy that defined the rites inportable, wearable tokens of initiation. These tokens createdand responded to the rise of social power that is, as Simmeland the anthropologists inform us, the essence of secrecy’spractice.ReferencesAlcock, Susan E.1997 The Heroic Past in a Hellenistic Present.InHellenistic Constructs: Essays in Culture, Historyand Historiography.
