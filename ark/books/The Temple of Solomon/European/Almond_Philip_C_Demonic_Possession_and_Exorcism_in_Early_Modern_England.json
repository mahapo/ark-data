Over twenty yearslater, it remains still largely unexplored. This book is intended to continuethe work then begun. It hopes to open up further territories then merelyglanced at, and to provide new maps of terrains thus far merely sketched.Itis my hope that the modernised versions of nine of the most significantcontemporary stories of demonic possession and exorcism offered belowwill encourage others to search further.The introduction proceeds from the assumption that the meaning ofdemonic possession and exorcism is to be found within the context of thesocial, political, and religious life of early modern England. More specifi-cally, it argues that possession and deliverance is a cultural drama playedout by all the participants within the confines of a cultural script known toall of them. And it suggests that the experiences of demonic possession hadbydemoniacs, exorcists, and audiences are shaped and configured by theircultural setting. Thus I hope that we come closer to a comprehension ofhow this aspect of popular religious belief and practice was lived out andexperienced in the context of early modern English life and thought.Butthis book aims too to bring its readers closer to the events it describes.Morethan anything else, the texts themselves enable the reader to enterthe alien world of the demonically possessed. The nine stories transcribedbelow were all written by people who were eye-witnesses, or were derivedfrom their reports. They reflect lives lived in radically different ways toours. They involved matters of life and death, of sin and sanctity, of guiltand innocence, of crimes which could not be committed and punishmentswhich could not be deserved, in ways difficult for us to grasp.

His chest and body began to swell and his eyes to stare.Hebeat his head against the ground. He was often seen, we are informed,to have a lump running up and down his body between the flesh and theskin. He gnashed his teeth and foamed at the mouth. He shrieked withpain, and wept and laughed. He had the strength of four or five men, andhis features were horribly disfigured. ‘The body of the said Alexander’, hisbrother Edward informs us, ‘being as wondrously transformed as it wasbefore, much like the picture of the Devil in a play, with a horrible voice,sounding Hell-hound, was most horribly tormented.’1Hisbrother had made an instant diagnosis of the cause of Alexander’sbehaviour, that he was being molested by an evil spirit. It was a diagnosismade in the presence of Alexander. And it was one which Alexander repeat-edly confirmed for Edward and his family by his subsequent speech andactions. Edward’s quick diagnosis may have been intended to highlight hisownperspicacity. But it does suggest that the symptoms of possession byevil spirits were sufficiently common to make the diagnosis possible.Itis impossible to make an accurate estimate of demoniacal behaviourin the early modern period. The exorcist John Darrell reported in1599that he had seen ten demoniacs and had heard of six more.2The physicianRichard Napier treated148people who were believed to be haunted orpossessed by spirits.3Ihave found references in the contemporary literatureto over one hundred possessed persons during the period from1550to1700.Daniel Walker makes the observation that cases of possession were commonenough ‘for ordinary people to understand them and believe in them’.Butashepoints out, and contemporary writings confirm, they were ‘rare1Anon.,1615,sig.b.1.r (see below, p.52).2SeeDarrell,1599[?], sig.d.4.v.3SeeMacdonald,1981,p.199.1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2Demonic Possession and Exorcismenough to be an exciting novelty and thus attract large audiences’.4What isundoubted is that the discourse of possession was a common feature of theelite and ‘popular’ grammar of the supernatural in early modern England.In1621,for example, Elizabeth Saunders taught Katherine Malpas howto simulate possession ‘in expectation and hope that much money wouldbe given unto her...bysuch persons as would come to see her in pityand commiseration’. As James Sharpe remarks, ‘these two women wereconfident that possession of this type would be widely recognised, andknew how to simulate it’.5The diagnosis of demonic possession was not usually made so swiftly, norby‘amateurs’. Often reluctant to accept their loved ones were possessed by ademon, relatives generally consulted the medical experts. Most physicians,when unable to find a natural reason for the symptoms of those afflicted,werenot averse to suspecting possession. Their judgement was importantin determining that the cause of the afflictions was beyond the natural.Thus, for example, the Denham demoniac Richard Mainy was sent foramedical opinion which concluded that ‘there was no natural cause ofmy disease, and so there was no remedy but I must needs be possessed’.6When Jane, daughter of Robert Throckmorton, fell ill in November1589,her parents sent samples of her urine to the physician Doctor Barrow inCambridge. Only after he had ruled out possible natural explanations didhe raise the possibility that the child was bewitched. Similarly, a MasterButler, having examined the child’s urine, could find no natural explanationof her ailments.7Inearly1596,Thomas Darling’s aunt took his urine to aphysician for analysis. Although he doubted that the boy was bewitched,he could find no signs of any natural disease in the boy.8Later in that sameyear, Nicholas Starkie consulted the celebrated John Dee, alchemist andastronomer, about the behaviour of a number of people in his household,all of whom showed signs of possession. Dee advised him to seek the helpof godly preachers and to engage in prayer and fasting.9Half a centurylater, convinced that her torments were from God, Margaret Muschampwould refuse the drugs prescribed by the physicians for whom her motherhad sent.10William Ringe was able to persuade the astrological physicianRichard Napier that he was possessed by four spirits whom he named asLegon, Simon, Argell, and Ammelee, the tempter.114Walker,1981,p.4.5Sharpe,1995,p.193.6Harsnett,1603,p.405.7Seeanon.,1593,sigs.a.3.v.–a.4.r (see below, p.79).

In the case of Thomas Darling, it was the cunning man Jesse Bee whofinally diagnosed bewitchment. Soon after the onset of Anne Gunter’s ill-ness, her father began to consult cunning men.12The cunning man EdmondHartley, called in to treat his family by Nicholas Starkie in mid1595,waseventually to be seen as the cause of the problems.13John Barrow soughtmedical and astrological advice before seeking out a cunning man whodiagnosed his son as bewitched.14Notall physicians would countenance a diagnosis of demonic possession.Edward Jorden, for example, explained the symptoms of possession in termsof the disease of hysteria or ‘the suffocation of the mother’. Jorden wasmotivated by the possession of Mary Glover, and by the trial of ElizabethJackson in December1602for having bewitched her. On that occasion,Doctors Hering and Spencer testified to the supernatural origins of herillness, Doctors Jorden and Argent to its natural origins. Judge Anderson,completely unconvinced by Jorden’s explanations of Mary’s symptoms,found Jackson guilty.15According to Jorden, hysteria was ‘an affect of the Mother or wombwherein the principal parts of the body by consent do suffer diversly accord-ing to the diversity of causes and diseases wherewith the matrix is affected’.16Jorden was following the tradition of including under ‘hysteria’ a wholerange of symptoms all believed to arise from gynaecological irregularities,symptoms of which were often included as signs of possession. His bookon hysteria was intended to demonstrate that ‘divers strange actions andpassions of the body of man, which in the common opinion, are imputedto the Devil, have their true natural causes, and do accompany this dis-ease’.17While he did not go as far as to deny the possibility of possessionand witchcraft, he did plead for caution in the diagnosis: ‘both becausethe impostures be many, and the affects of natural diseases be strange tosuch as have not looked thoroughly into them’.18And of the cure of thoseseemingly possessed by the prayer and fasting of others, Jorden has a readypsychological explanation in the confident expectation of the patient tofind relief through those means.Jorden’s account was predicated on the assumption that naturalisticand supernaturalistic accounts of disease were incompatible. And it was12SeeSharpe,1999,pp.57–8.13See More,1600,p.16(see below, p.206).14See [Barrow],1663,p.8.See also [Barrow],1663,p.18;and Drage,1665,p.39.15SeeBradwell, in MacDonald1991,pp.26ff.

As StephenBradwell wrote, ‘Whereas he [Jorden] supposes by placing natural effects tocall in natural causes, and by admitting natural causes to exclude supernat-ural out of doors, he is much deceived. For supernatural efficients can doall the natural may and much more.’19Still, Jorden’s account of possessionas an illness did allow for the possibility that the symptoms of demonicpossession did not have to be taken only as either genuine evidence ofthe supernatural or as the result of intentional fraud by the apparentlypossessed. Disease was, for Jorden, a genuine alternative to fraud or theactivities of the devil and his minions.Thus, in the summer and autumn of1605,the demoniac Anne Gunterwas interviewed by King James I. Anne had become a subject of consid-erable public interest, sufficiently to arouse the King’s interest. Soon afterthe first of their meetings, Anne had been handed over to the scepticalRichard Bancroft, then Archbishop of Canterbury, and thence to his chap-lain Samuel Harsnett, who had been earlier involved in investigations ofcases of alleged possession. As in the case of Mary Glover, Edward Jordenalso became involved. At her final meeting with James on10October, sheconfessed that her vomiting of needles and pins had been a fraud, but thatshe had long been afflicted with hysteria.20Under formal examination, other demoniacs also put forward hysteriaas an explanation for their behaviour in mitigation of their apparent fraud.Between the spring of1585and the summer of1586,six demoniacs wereexorcised by twelve Catholic priests, mostly in Denham, Buckinghamshire.Fifteen years later, Bancroft and Harsnett decided to investigate. Three ofthe demoniacs, Anne Smith, Sara Williams, and Richard Mainy claimedto have suffered from hysteria at the time of their supposed possessions.21ToHarsnett, that they were really suffering from hysteria made the oppor-tunism of the exorcising priests even greater: ‘let them turn over but onenew leaf in Sprenger, Nider Mengus, or Thyraeus, and see how to discover19Bradwell, in MacDonald1991,p.57.20ForJames’s account of her confession in a letter to Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury, see Hunter,1963,p.77.For a comprehensive analysis of the case of Anne Gunter, see Sharpe,1999.21SeeBrownlow,1993,pp.223,349,381,386,401,409.Brownlow’s work includes a critical edition ofthe book upon which our knowledge of the Denham case is based, namely, Samuel Harsnett’sADeclaration of Egregious Popish Impostures,London,1603.OfMainy’s ‘hysteria’, Brownlow points outthat Harsnett applies the term ‘the mother’ contemptuously to Mainy, but he also uses the correctterm ‘hysterica passio’. And Mainy himself is not sure of the correct term. Brownlow suggests that‘the mother’ was used colloquially to describe a male condition, but that ‘hysterica passio’ wouldnormally only be used of women.

In1621,before he became convinced that his daughter Elizabeth was the victimof witchcraft, Edward Fairfax, ‘neither a fantastic Puritan or superstitiousPapist’ as he put it, attributed all that she said and did in her fits to ‘thedisease called “the mother” ’.23SirKenelm Digby related the story of awoman who, suffering from hysteria, believed herself to be possessed by thedevil.24The Puritan divine Richard Baxter wrote of a maid from Bewdleywho, suffering from a disease of the uterus from1642for four or five years,manifested the symptoms of possession.25As late as1698,Susanna Fowles,having been exposed as a fraud, accepted the diagnosis of hysteria ‘as agood cloak, as she thought, for her preceding imposture, thinking therebyto colour over the matter, and blind the world’.26Apart from hysteria, epilepsy also was often looked to as a possible naturalexplanation of demonic symptoms. When Thomas Darling’s illness began,many believed that he was suffering from epilepsy or the falling sickness‘by reason that it was not a continual distemperature, but came by fits,with sudden staring, striving and struggling very fiercely, and falling downwith sore vomits’.27Certainly, there were comparable symptoms – fallingdown suddenly on the ground, grinding the teeth, foaming at the mouth,self violence, deprivation of the senses, swelling of the body.28The matterwas further complicated by the belief that epilepsy could be demonicallycaused. But some symptoms of possession were recognised as distinctive ofpossession, and not associated with epilepsy by those for whom demonicpossession was a real possibility – knowledge of other languages, especiallyGreek and Latin, clairvoyance, extraordinary strength, and revulsion atsacred things, particular sections of the Bible, especially the opening ofStJohn’s Gospel, religious objects of various sorts, and so on.The diagnosis of a natural disease did not necessarily mean the denial ofdemonic involvement. Some saw natural diseases in general as demonicallycaused.29Others saw those suffering from natural diseases as good candi-dates for infection by the devil. The Dutch physician Levinus Lemnius, forexample, many of whose works were translated into English, believed it was22Brownlow,1993,p.225.23Grange,1882,p.37.24Digby,1669,p.183.25Baxter,1691,pp.193–5.26Anon.,1698,p.18.27Anon.,1597,p.1(see below, pp.157–8).28Foracontemporary list of symptoms of epilepsy, see Willis,1685,p.239.29Seee.g., Mason,1612,pp.41f."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6Demonic Possession and Exorcismfrivolous to refer the causes of illness to evil spirits. But he did accept that theDevil could make naturally caused ailments worse.30Thomas Browne testi-fied in a1664witchcraft trial in England that the fits of some females ‘werenatural and nothing else but what they call the mother, but only height-ened to a great excess by the subtlety of the Devil, cooperating with themalice of these which we term witches’.31The presbyterian divine RichardBaxter believed that Satan used melancholy to move men to despair and sui-cide.32Inlate seventeenth-century New England, Cotton Mather believed‘that the evil angels do often take advantage from natural distempers inthe children of men to annoy them with such further mischiefs as we callpreternatural’.33Demonic possession was often also linked with melancholy, itself anillness which covered a vast array of symptoms. For Robert Burton, reli-gious melancholy was itself caused by the devil, and demonic possessionwas included in his categories of diseases of the mind. ‘The last kind ofmadness or melancholy’, he wrote, ‘is that demoniacal (if I may so callit) obsession or possession of devils whichPlaterusand others would haveto bee praeternatural: stupendous things are said of them, their actions,gestures, contortions, fasting, prophecying, speaking languages they werenever taught &c.’34There were occasions when those suffering from what Burton woulddiagnose as religious melancholy35werebelieved to be possessed by theDevil. Suicidal impulses were seen as evidence of demonic activity. InAugust1590,for example John Dee diagnosed Ann Frank, a suicidal nursein his household, as possessed by an evil spirit.36Hisattempts at exorcisingthe spirit were unavailing. She died in late September having cut her throat.The wife of Francis Drake of Esher in Surrey threatened to kill herself onmany occasions. She believed that she was doomed to eternal punishmentin hell, that God had forsaken her, that everything she did ensured hereventual condemnation, and that it was too late for her or anyone else todo anything to avoid her destiny. Those around her were convinced thatshe was possessed by the Devil, and a regime of prayer and fasting wasbegun to effect her release.37Suicidal impulses were common among those who, not merely melan-cholic, also showed the symptoms of possession.

For Reginald Scot, for example,the natural explanation excluded the supernatural. The fantasies of witchesweremerely the result of their melancholic imaginations.41Konrad Gesnerprescribed a powder as a cure for demoniacs: ‘Many also that be Limphatici,that is, mad or melancholic, whom they believed commonly to be resortedto by devils, we have cured them with the same.’42In1601,the AnglicansJohn Deacon and John Walker included melancholy along with hysteriaand epilepsy among the causes of the symptoms of demonic possession.43Their colleague Samuel Harsnett concurred: ‘The Philosophers’ old apho-rism is,cerebrum Melancholicum est sedes daemonum,amelancholic brainis the chair of estate for the devil.’44Harsnett saw manifestations of possession as reflecting any number ofillnesses. If any have an idle or sullen girl, he wrote, ‘and she have a littlehelp of theMother,Epilepsy,orCrampto teach her to roll her eyes, wry hermouth, gnash her teeth, startle with her body, hold her arms and handsstiff, make comic faces, girme, mow, and mop like an ape, tumble likeahedgehog, and can mutter out two or three words of gibberish, such asobus, bobus,and then with-all old MotherNobshas called her by chance idleyoung housewife, or bid the devil scratch her, then no doubt but MotherNobsis the Witch, the young girl is owl-blasted and possessed’.45While not denying the reality of the demonic realm, Deacon and Walker,like Harsnett, drove an Anglican wedge of secularism between papists andPuritans. Reports of rare and strange feats arose not from supernatural,38Brownlow,1993,p.342.39SeeDarrell,1599,pp.11,14,37.40Blagrave,1672,p.174.See also, Baxter,1691,p.193;[Barrow],1664,p.7;anon.,1647,p.3;Jollie,1697,p.10;Mather,1914,p.118;Hall,1991,p.274;Crouzet,1997,p.193.41Scot,1584,p.42.See also Anglo,1973,p.220f.42Konrad Gesner,The Treasure of Euonymus,1559,p.331.Quoted by Kocher,1950,p.21.43SeeDeacon and Walker,1601,pp.206–8,Walker,1981,pp.69–70.44Brownlow,1993,p.304.45Brownlow,1993,pp.308–9."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8Demonic Possession and Exorcismthey declared, but from natural causes, ‘from disorderedmelancholy,fromMania,from theEpilepsy,fromLunacy,fromConvulsions,fromthemother,from themenstrual obstructions,and sundry otheroutrageous infirmities’.46Richard Bernard did not deny the reality of demonic possession. But he didadvise jurymen not only to look for counterfeits among demoniacs, but torecognise that such may also suffer from natural diseases such as epilepsy,melancholy, andhysterica passio.47Miracles and strategiesScepticism about the possibility of possession and exorcism was bolstered bythe belief that the age of miracles had passed. This enabled both scepticismabout miracles in the present and commitment to the truth of the accountsof miracles in the Bible, at least those of Christ, the apostles, and theprophets. Thus, for Reginald Scot, for example, not only did miraclescease after the time of the apostles, but even those biblical miracles notperformed by Christ, the Prophets, or the Apostles were not miraculous atall.48Whether aware of it or not, Scot was reflecting an Anglican traditionthat the means of salvation was made sufficiently available in the gospel ofJesus Christ, and that there was consequently no need of further miraclesnor, for that matter, of prophecies. As F. W. Brownlow points out, when, incanon72in1604,Bishop Bancroft prohibited any minister from taking partin ‘prophesyings’ or in exorcisms by the use of prayer and fasting underpain of deposition from his ministry, ‘Skepticism towards prophecy andmiracles thus became legally and institutionally a part of the Church ofEngland.’49The denial of the possibility of possession and exorcism on the groundsof the impossibility of miracles in the present was an important part ofBancroft’s campaign against exorcism, both Catholic and Protestant. And itwas supported in John Deacon and John Walker’sDialogicall Discourses.Astheir representative in theDialogues,Orthodoxus, puts it, ‘All true ChristianChurches, and the soundest Divines in our days, do generally conclude afinal discontinuance of the miraculous faith, in these days of the Gospel;and therefore (by consequence) the undoubted determination of the Devil’sextraordinary power of actual possession.’50Moreover, evenifthe age of46Deacon and Walker,1601,p.206.47SeeBernard,1627,pp.47–8.See also Cotta,1617,pp.60ff., Lemnius,1658,p.391,Taylor,1697,pp.28–9.48SeeScot,1972,pp.89–90.OnScot, see Estes,1983.49Brownlow,1993,p.64.50Quoted by Brownlow,1993,pp.71–2."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction9miracles had not ceased, they argued, the Devil does not have extraordinarypower beyond the ordinary powers of nature, and so cannot work miracleslike possession.51That the age of miracles had ceased was a proposition also accepted bythe Puritans, at least in their propaganda against the papists. But for thoseactively involved in demonic possession, the matter was more complex. ThePuritan divine Arthur Hildersham, for example, declared it a dangerousopinion that miracles occur still in the Church. But he did want to arguethat, in the case of possession, prayer and fasting had a good purpose insanctifying God’s judgement on the demoniac ‘to the beholders, and thepossessed himself ’.52The puritan exorcist John Darrell’s colleague GeorgeMoreclearly recognised the strategic power of miracles in general, andexorcism in particular: ‘if the Church of England have this power to castout devils, then the church of Rome is a false Church. For there can bebut one true Church, the principal mark of which, as they say, is to workmiracles, and of them this is the greatest, namely to cast out devils.’53Yet, hewished utterly to disclaim that the consequences of his and others’ prayerand fasting were the consequence of any ‘extraordinary power in us’.54Similarly, the anonymous author ofAbrief Narration of the Possession...ofWilliam Sommersin1598,indefending John Darrell, had to respond toaccusations that ‘It is Popery to hold that there is any possessions sinceChrist’s time’, that ‘it is heresy to maintain that the Devil may now be castout by prayer, and fasting’, and that ‘miracles are now ceased’.55Inresponseto the first, he pointed to contemporary examples of the symptoms ofpossession, and in response to the second, to the statement of Jesus that thepossessed may be delivered through the prayers and fasting of the faithful.56While claiming that there is no biblical warrant for the ceasing of miracles,he nevertheless declared that removing the Devil by prayer and fasting isnot miraculous. The miraculous was only present when those involvedhad power over unclean spirits, as the disciples of Christ had, and thepapist priests don’t. Nevertheless, Christians have ‘an extraordinary andsupernatural lawful means of cure. This is by long and earnest entreaty tobeseech Almighty God by mediation of Christ Jesus to release the party.’57Miracle workers they may not have been. But the Puritans wanted it knownthat they had influence in high places.51Deacon and Walker,1601,p.208.See also Harsnett,1599,Epistle to the Reader.52Anon.,1597,p.27(see below, p.177).53More,1600,sig.a.3.r (see below, p.199).54More,1600,sig.a.3.v (see below, p.199).55Anon.,1598,sig.b.4.v (see below, pp.258–9).

Darrell’s strategywas a two-fold one. First, he naturalised possession, arguing that it was nomore than ‘to be sick of a fever, or to have the palsy, or some other disease’.58Second, he maintained that, while casting out devils by prayer and fastingis wondrous, it is not miraculous. The key to a miracle, he claimed, wasthat it be done and brought to pass without any means set and appointedbyGod. To apply prayer and fasting to the disease of possession is to do nomore than to apply an appropriate natural medicine to a natural disease.‘The expulsion of Satan by prayer, or fasting and prayer’, he wrote, ‘is nomiracle, because it is brought to pass by means ordained to that end.’59And thus, prayer and fasting ‘is as effectual through the blessing of Godupon this his ordinance to cast Satan forth of those he possesses as the bestmedicine we have is to cure any natural disease’.60Miraculous it may not have been. But Darrell recognised the strategicvalue that exorcism held for the Puritan cause. The practice of prayerand fasting to expel demons, he believed, would more effectively enableProtestants to ‘stop the mouth of the adversary, touching the priviledge oftheirs of casting forth devils wherein, with their other lying miracles, theyglory so much’.61God, through his delivering of the demoniacs, wouldappear to be favouring the Puritan cause.As aware of the strategic value of dispossessions as Darrell, SamuelHarsnett suspected a disastrous outcome were Protestant dispossessions tobecome widespread: Protestant would turn against Protestant, and not onlyagainst Catholic. Were Darrell and his like not dealt with, wrote Harsnett,‘weshould have had many other pretended signs of possession: one Devilwould have been mad at the name of the Presbyter, another at the sight ofaminister that will not subscribe, another to have seen men sit or stand atthe Communion’.62Harsnett’s fears were not realised among Protestant demoniacs. Theirdevils were more involved in the struggle for individual souls than eccle-siastical bodies, their presence more the outcome of bewitchment by awitch than a symbol of conflict between or within Christian groups. ButHarsnett’s concerns were confirmed by Catholic demoniacs. He was famil-iar with the French demoniac Marthe Brossier. Abraham Hartwell had pub-lished a translation of a French account of Brossier in1599,dedicated toBishop Bancroft.63Herdevil had declared that all the Protestants belonged58Darrell,1599[?], sig.d.3.v.

As Harsnett put it, ‘When the cogge-devilspeaks of us, O that is our disgrace and confusion; when he speaks of theRomish Church and the bleeding of the Sacrament, O that is God’s oracleand their triumphant exaltation. O despicable heathenish beggery, to gobegging good words and credit from the Devil!’69Ofcourse, Harsnett’s concerns were only valid ones on the assumptionthat the Devil would be taken as speaking the truth. And in general he was.There was biblical authority for the Devil’s knowing religious truth. Theunclean spirit within the demoniac in the synagogue cried out to Jesus, ‘Iknow thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.’70The Gadarene demoniacrecognised Jesus as the Son of God.71There was an expectation among bothCatholics and Protestants that the devil within the possessed would speakthe truth. Paradoxically, the Devil was a defender of the faith. His abilityto possess and the faithful’s ability to deliver those possessed by him wereadefence against scepticism and atheism. Who knows, asked John Darrellrhetorically, ‘whether God has therefore sent evil Spirits into sundry Englishpersons to vex them in their bodies that thereby he might confound theAtheists in England? . . . for some special thing no doubt there is movingthe Lord more at this time than in former times to send devils into men,Yea, into divers.’72But, the demonic attestation of religious truth, or any sort of truth forthat matter, was something of a two-edged sword. For it contained withinitself the possibility of its own denial. And biblical authority pointed inanother direction.73Inthe gospel of John, Christ had called the Devil a liarand the father of lies.74Thus, as early as1593,the non-conformist divine64SeeWalker,1981,pp.34–5.65SeeBrownlow, pp.226–7,368.66Brownlow,1993,p.386.67SeeBrownlow,1993,p.373.68SeeBrownlow,1993,p.323.69Brownlow,1993,p.332.70Mark1.47.71Mark5.7.72Darrell,1599[?], sig.g.1.v.

But if he wouldyield to him, he would save him.’78John Darrell was convinced that the Devil could also produce the illu-sion of demonic possession. Satan, in his subtlety, declared Darrell, ‘hasdone in the boy some sleight and trifling things, at divers times, of pur-pose to deceive the beholders, and to bear them in hand, that he didnever greater things in him: thereby to induce them to think, that hewas a counterfeit’.79Soconvinced was he of the Devil’s repossession ofSommers that he refused to accept the boy’s capacity to mimic his formerfits.80InDarrell’s world, satanic activity was impervious to refutation, evenbythe demoniac himself. Where the oppositionality of fraud and posses-sion is undermined, truth is forever indeterminate. As Stephen Greenblattremarks, ‘If Satan can counterfeit counterfeiting, there can be no definitiveconfession, and the prospect opens to an infinite regress of disclosure anduncertainty.’81Devils and witchesThat there were many possessed by the Devil was not for many a matterof surprise. It was to be expected.

God is as ready tochastise men in these as in former days, wrote Darrell, ‘And the Devil inregard to the shortness of his time more ready than ever to do his service andbest indeavour.’87Moreover the sufferings of the possessed on this side ofthe grave were a latter day sign of the final destiny of those to be tormentedin Hell: ‘If the Devil deals thus with man being sent forth of God but tochastise him for his amendment, how will he intreat him when he shall fallupon him to execute the vengeance to come? . . . If in the former case hecause such crying, gnashing of teeth, and tormenting...what gnashingof teeth, what tormenting shall there be in the latter?’88Even Harsnettwas inclined to see the ‘lying signs, feigned wonders, cogged miracles, thecompanions of Antichrist’, as evidence of the latter times.89The bodies of the possessed were also sites of eschatological conflict.The increasing wrath of Satan at the end of his time in the body of thepossessed mirrored the increase in his activity in the historical realm. Theseven demoniacs of Lancashire were increasingly tormented as the timeapproached for the departure of the Devil.90‘I imagined’, said John Swanas the deliverance of Mary Glover approached its conclusion, ‘that his malice82Seeespecially Clark,1997,chs.26–8.83James,1597,p.81.See also Clark,1977.84Revelation12.12.85Anon.,1597,Tothe Reader (see below, pp.155–6).86Anon.,1597,pp.30–2.87Darrell,1599(?), sig.d.4.v.

And so it fellout.’91All were agreed that only with divine permission was the Devil ableto enter into anyone. This was a simple consequence of the doctrine ofthe sovereignty of God. As George Cole reported, ‘The wrath of God isalready gone forth against one of Master Darrell’s greatest enemies, namely,Master Sale, official of Wesson, whose child is lately vexed with an evil spiritbecause, as his wife reports, he has been an adversary to Master Darrell.’92Onthe other hand, both the possessed themselves, and those involved intheir deliverance, were apt to give the firm impression that, in their case atleast, the Devil was firmly in control, or at best, that God and the Devilwereinvolved in a battle which it was possible for either to win.This was an ambivalence at the heart of Christianity itself. For Satanwas both divine emissary and divine enemy. This was an ambivalence oftenpresent in the literature of witchcraft and possession. Thus, for exampleLevinus Lemnius informed his readers that God winks at the hurts broughtupon men by the Devil, indeed, he ‘partly instigates the devils and theirinstruments to rage against many that have deserved to be so punished’.93Buthealso reminded them that since Satan’s chief end is to abolish theglory of God, he assaults man, both within and without, ‘and sometimeshe troubles the body, sometimes the soul, and sometimes both, to worktheir destruction’.94The matter is further complicated by the possibility of two modes ofpossession. In the one case, the demoniac is possessed as a result of the directaction of devils, in the other, as a consequence of the presence of witchcraft.The difference had important moral consequences. In general, where theDevil has directly entered the body of the demoniac, it is generally as aconsequence of the sin of the latter. The possessed are ultimately responsiblefor their plight. Thus, in the case of Alexander Nyndge, his possessed body isthe sign of his sinfulness. The story of Alexander functions as a reminder toits readers of the need for rigorous moral examination of the self to avoidthe punishment of God: ‘For describing the horror and unheard of miserythat fell on him, we may be thereby drawn to descend into ourselves, and tolook into our souls while there is yet time, lest Heaven pour down its vialsof wrath on us.’95Inthe case of William Sommers, God used the bodyof the demoniac to demonstrate the sins of the whole community: ‘WhenSommers began his gestures, Master Darrell affirmed that they were the91Swan,1603,p.21(see below, p.306).92Anon.,1598,sig.a.3.r (see below, p.246).93Lemnius,1658,p.385.94Lemnius,1658,p.386.95Nyndge,1616,sig.a.3.r (see below, p.48)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction15signs, whereby the Devil showed the sins that reigned in Nottingham, anddid himself interpret some of them . . . By this course the people were verymuch amazed, as thinking the Devil to preach so unto them, and so notethe sins that reigned in that town.’96Bycontrast, where the Devil has gained entrance as a consequence ofwitchcraft, the demoniac is more to be construed as an innocent victim ofthe machinations of a witch. It is hardly then a matter of surprise that thosewho were possessed and their families were inclined to point the fingerof responsibility elsewhere. Accusations of witchcraft were more the normthan the exception. Of the nine cases of possession below, only the firstdoes not include accusations of witchcraft.Forthe accused, the results were serious, occasionally fatal. As JaneKamensky points out, ‘to cry witch was to create a witch’.97Alice Samuel,her daughter Agnes, and her husband John were all hanged as a resultof accusations of bewitchment made by the Throckmorton children.98As a result of the accusations of Thomas Darling, Alice Gooderidge wasimprisoned and died in gaol.99Edmond Hartley, the cunning man, washanged twice, the second time successfully.100William Sommers’ accusa-tions saw thirteen persons making court appearances.101Elizabeth Jacksonwas indicted for witchcraft on the basis of Mary Glover’s accusations, andfound guilty.102William Perry blamed Joan Cocke for his torments. Shewas indicted but acquitted.103Margaret Muschamp’s illness is blamed on avariety of people, but only Dorothy Swinow, who had had a history of badrelations with Margaret’s mother, is eventually indicted.104In1616,ninewomen were hanged as a consequence of Henrie Smith’s accusations thatthey had sent their familiar spirits to torment him.105Sixwomen were triedand found not guilty of bewitching the children of Edward Fairfax.106Although there is no biblical precedent for a connection betweenwitchcraft and possession, there is a cultural expectation that the two arerelated. Within the texts, possession is presented as the direct consequenceof an unpleasant encounter with a person later identified as the cause ofbewitchment. John Darrell informs us that William Sommers’ fits beganafter he encountered an old woman who extorted money from him andforced him to eat bread and butter.107Itwas after Thomas Darling had heard96Harsnett,1599,p.117.97Kamensky,1997,p.155.98Anon.,1593.99Seeanon.,1597,p.43(see below, p.191).100See More,1600,pp.21–2(see below, pp.207–8).101Seeanon.,1598,sig.b.1.r.102SeeBradwell in Macdonald,1991,pp.26ff.103Anon.,1622,p.61(see below, p.345).104Anon.,1650,p.27(see below, p.390).105SeeKittredge,1956,pp.322–3.106SeeGrange,1882,pp.32–4.107SeeDarrell,1600a, p.14."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16Demonic Possession and ExorcismJesse Bee tell his Aunt that he is bewitched that he fortuitously recalled andrecounted the story of his meeting in a wood with an old woman on thesame day on which he had become ill. ‘As I passed by her in the coppice’,he reported, ‘I chanced, against my will, to pass wind which she, taking inanger, said, “Gyp with a mischief, and fart with a bell.

The blood of the witch was most often sought as a means of cure.The story of the Throckmorton children is punctuated by various attemptsto scratch the accused witches.111Inthe case of Thomas Darling, someof the bystanders persuaded him to scratch the witch Alice Gooderidge,although it was a practice that the editor of the text disapproved of.112Margaret Muschamp believed that her life was saved by the two drops ofblood that had been procured, under some duress, from the cunning manJohn Hutton whom she had accused of bewitching her.113Onoccasion, the causal relation of witchcraft and possession was rein-forced by the claim that the death or imprisonment of the witch curedpossession. The cessation of possession demonstrated the truth of the ver-dict. The execution of the witches both acted as a judicial exorcism anddemonstrated the authenticity of the possession. Thus, the story of thepossessed Throckmorton children concluded with the following ‘proof’: ‘Ifany be desirous to know the present state of these children, how they areand have been since the death of these parties, you will understand that,since their day of execution, not any one of them have had any fit at all,neither yet grudging or complaining of any such thing.

Demons often appeared in animalform as rats, cats, and dogs, on occasion as birds, and even as bears. Devilsappeared to some as black men, often as children, black, white, or red.Margaret Byrom was terrified by a vision of the Devil in the form of thecunning man Edmond Hartley.121Onanother occasion she was ‘grievouslymolested and sorely frightened with a terrible vision . . . like a foul blackdwarf, with half a face, long shaggy hair, black broad hands and black clovenfeet’.122On31August1590,Elizabeth Throckmorton cried out grievouslyabout a vision of Mother Samuel with a black child sitting upon hershoulder.123Possessions, good and badWhere the demoniac was the innocent victim of witchcraft, she could beconstructed as a model of piety and morality.

On Good Friday,1586,for example, Westonrecorded that Mainy, lying upon his bed, told the Catholics present thathis hour was come, exhorted them to be loyal to their faith, and desired allthe company to pray with him, ‘every person present being moved to greatdevotion’.126After falling into a trance which lasted two hours, he awoke,‘fetching a great sigh and a groan, and then used these words: My time isnot yet come; our blessed Lady has appeared unto me and told me that Imust live longer yet, for that God has reserved me for a further purpose todo more good, and to tell of strange wonders.’127Onother occasions, hewas able sufficiently to persuade his audience that he saw Christ himselfaccompanied by angels, or the Virgin Mary attended by blessed virgins,that all present would ‘fall down upon their knees to worship them, and topray unto them’.128Acentral feature of Thomas Darling’s possession was his conversationswith the Devil.

But to speak beyond themselves was typical ofthose possessed by either God or the Devil. William Withers, for example,was said to have preached as though he were a learned divine: ‘and whenhe speaks, his voice seems to be of such power that all the bed shakes,to the astonishment of the hearers’.132John Darrell was concerned thatDarling’s piety was in reality the Devil disguised as an angel of light. Buthe had fewer doubts about William Sommers. He spoke ‘most profoundlyof some mysteries of religion’, wrote Darrell, and ‘expounded the Creed,and that very divine-like.’133In1592,speaking to Alice Samuel of the joysof heaven and the torments of hell, the Throckmorton children exhortedher to confess to her witchcraft in such heavenly and divine speeches ‘thatif a man had heard it, he would not have thought himself better edified atten sermons’.134Seventy years earlier, as Thomas Cranmer informs us, a maid possessedhad strange visions and revelations of heaven, hell, and purgatory. While inatrance for three hours or more, a voice could be heard speaking tunefullyfrom her stomach which, ‘when it told anything of the joys of Heaven, itspoke so sweetly and so heavenly, that every man was ravished with thehearing thereof; and contrary, when it told any thing of Hell, it spoke sohorribly and terribly, that it put the hearers in a great fear’.135ElizabethBarton, the so-called Maid of Kent, showed many signs of demonic posses-sion but spoke eloquently of heaven, hell, and purgatory, ‘and of the joys,and sorrows that sundry departed souls had’.136Margaret Muschamp’s illness began with a ‘good’ possession. From theoutset, she was a model of childish piety. Recovering from her first trance,she cried out, ‘Dear Mother, weep not for me. For I have seen a happy sight,and heard a blessed sound. For the Lord has so loved my poor soul thathe has caused his blessed trumpet to sound in my ears, and has sent twoblessed angels to receive my sinful soul.’137Margaret Muschamp preferredthe world of her angels to that of the everyday. She continued with themin conversation for hours at a time. She is distraught when her angels arekept from her. When after an absence of twelve weeks her angels return, acrowd gathers to witness the event and to listen to her conversation withthem for two hours.

That itwas so was the consequence of the possibility that the Devil, or any num-ber of demons, could physically locate in the demoniac’s body. Sceptics likeDeacon and Walker argued that when the scriptures spoke of possession bydemons they did so only metaphorically. To interpret possession literally,they maintained, ‘would pester the Church with many absurd and inconve-nient opinions’.139Similarly, Thomas Hobbes maintained that the biblicalaccounts of Satan’s entering were to be interpreted metaphorically. And hewent on to suggest that, since spirits are corporeal, and since two corporealentities cannot both occupy the same space at the same time, thereforecorporeal possession is impossible.140Inorder to get around this sort ofproblem, Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, was later to construct thecorporeality of the Devil in terms of the Platonic account of the vehicles ofthe soul. The Devil in a ‘vehicle’ of air could be intermingled with othervehicles.141Though metaphor and reality often overlap in the description of theentrance and exit of the demonic, the possession texts themselves have anoverall commitment to a demonic quasi-corporeality. Thus the Devil isseen to enter through bodily openings, nostrils, ears, wounds, the anus,and so on. Most commonly, the Devil entered through the mouth, oftenmingling with the air that was breathed.142The Denham demoniac SaraWilliams reported that ‘the thing’ entered through her mouth, thence to herheart, where it ‘burnt her intolerably’.143Elizabeth Throckmorton accusedMother Samuel of putting a mouse, a cat, a frog, and sometimes a toad intoher mouth.144Edmond Hartley was accused of having breathed the Devilinto the Starkie children by kissing them.145William Sommers affirmedthat the Devil tried to re-possess him by entering his mouth in the likenessof a rat.146The Devil asked Helen Fairfax to open her mouth and let himcome into her body.147And the demons exited in similar ways, through the ear, the vagina, mostoften through the mouth. John Barrow was delivered of five devils ‘as ifhe was ready to be choked, bursting forth with a kind of belching’.148Thedevil in the daughter of Goodman Alexander departed invisibly with a greatcry and hideous noise, accompanied by a sudden gust of wind.149Elizabeth139Deacon,1601,p.16.140Kors and Peters,1973,pp.346–7.141SeeAlmond,1991,pp.775–91.142SeeLemnius,1658,p.385.143Brownlow,1993,p.340.144Seeanon.,1593,sigs.b.4.v–c.1.r.145More,1600,p.16(see below p.205).

As a consequence,possession by many, both named and anonymous, was more the rule thanthe exception.162Profiling the possessedDriven as they are by their own strategic intentions, it is often difficultto read behind the possession texts. But, even granting that they are oftenprone to imagining how the possessed ought to have behaved rather thandescribing how they did behave, they are suggestive of a number of clearpatterns among those who were considered to show definitive signs ofpossession. It is clear, for example, that the manifestations of demonicpossession differed little across the range of ages and across gender. Thus,male demoniacs showed the same behaviour as female, and older demo-niacs had the same repertoire as younger. Although demoniacal behaviouris nuanced in terms of the denominational allegiances of the possessed,the same general features of possession are evident among the tormentedin English Protestant and Catholic contexts, and, one might add, in theEuropean Catholic and Protestant contexts more generally. The featuresof possession cross borders, as did the texts also. Moreover, over the earlymodern period more generally, there are no discernible shifts in the natureof possessions. William Sommers is recognisable in Richard Dugdale, theSurrey demoniac, a century later,163as is William Perry, the Boy of Bilson,in Susanna Fowles some eighty years later.164Itis evident, however, that children and adolescents were more prone topossession than adults. Children lived in a supernatural world populated byelves, ghosts, hobgoblins, bogey men, and demons.165Ofthe twenty or sodemoniacs whose stories are recounted below, only one can be consideredas a young adult, and two as adults: William Sommers was in his lateteens, Jane Ashton thirty years of age, and Margaret Byrom three yearsolder than Jane. Of sixty-four identifiable English demoniacs whose ages Ihave estimated from the sources, either directly or indirectly, only eight areover twenty years of age. Females, and particularly girls and young women,werealso more prone to be possessed than males. In sixty-two cases ofpossession where the genders of the possessed can be determined, forty-four are females and eighteen males.

Of the forty-four females, only three can be said to beof adult age. Thus, among the possessed in early modern England, aroundtwo-thirds are female children or adolescents, and around one-fifth boys oradolescent males.Itis not surprising then that analyses of demonic possession have pointedto its function as a form of rebellion against adult authorities. James Sharpe,for example, has pointed out that the possessed had a licence for badbehaviour: ‘The decent and comely behaviour which the writers of conductbooks recommended as the norm for youth was clearly blown aside bythe possessed. They could do and say things which would not otherwisehave been tolerated.’166Similarly, Diane Purkiss has remarked on the wayin which the possessed child’s body, if not its mind, ‘escapes from thediscipline of the godly household’.167Atthe least, it was one way of avoidingprayer. Thus for example, no sooner had Doctor Dorrington begun to praythan the Throckmorton children all fell into their fits, ‘with such terriblescreeches and strange sneezings, wonderfully tormented as though theywould have been torn in pieces’.168When the doctor ceased praying, thechildren ceased being tormented. But ‘When he began to pray, they beganto shriek. When he ended, they ended.’169John and Anne Starkie, EllenHolland, and Ellinor Hurdman, it was observed, were never troubled at allwhen allowed to play cards or other games. But if the scriptures were read,prayers used for them, or exhortations addressed to them, ‘they fell intotheir fits’. The consequence of this behaviour was that, for about two years,‘they never came to the church for fear of only increasing their torments’.170Possession was a means by which moral imperatives could be violated,guilt mitigated if not removed, and parental authority avoided. DianePurkiss suggests that Margaret Muschamp’s possession ‘allowed a rangeof fantasy ways out of the impasses of the mother–daughter bond’.171Katherine Wright, one of the exorcist John Darrell’s early successes, wasavictim of physical abuse as a child.172The devils in Mary Hall said thatthey would have possessed her father if they had had the power.173Inthemost general sense, accusations of witchcraft by young demoniacs againstadults can be read as subversive of all adult authority. Their possession wasan extreme reaction to the restrictive piety of the households in which manyof them were being brought up.166Sharpe,1995,pp.198–9.167Purkiss,1998,p.241.168Anon.,1593,sig.b.3.r (see below, p.85).169Anon.,1593,sig.b.3.r (see below, p.85).170More,1600,pp.39–40(see below, p.217).171Purkiss,1998,p.247.172SeeHarsnett,1599,p.279.The text is oddly paginated, beginning again at p.279,after p.296.173SeeDrage,1665,p.32."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24Demonic Possession and ExorcismThese were not then cases of ‘the Devil made me do it’ so much ashis actually being the doer. Possession provided an excuse for outrageousbehaviour, and a complete mitigation of it. Far from being condemned,the demoniac received sympathy and concern. The language of demoniacswas clearly often obscene – at least to seventeenth-century ears. On occa-sion, if only rarely, so was their behaviour. William Sommers, for example,breached the boundary between the human and the bestial. John Darrellreminded his readers of Sommers’ behaviour ‘in acting the sin of whoredomin the manner he did, and that in the presence of so many: also his filthyand abominable carriage of himself with a bitch before divers’.174The limitsof blasphemy were undoubtedly pushed. When the preachers called for theBible, some of the Lancashire seven ‘fell to laughing at it, and said, “Reachthem the Bibble bable, bibble babbell”’. John Starkie, when asked to saythe Lord’s Prayer after the preachers, misnamed every word in it, until theystopped, ‘exceedingly grieved that they [the children] had despised suchholy things like dogs and swine’.175The maid Joan Harvey sometimes spatat the name of Jesus, and blasphemed God saying ‘God is a good man Ican do as much as he; I care not for Jesus, &c.’176Children in the early modern period lived on the periphery of adultattention. Not so possessed children and adolescents. They moved fromthe margins of attention to the centre. Demoniacs took hostages. Ironi-cally, they possessed their parents. Edward Fairfax, always convinced of thegenuineness of the possession of his children, was aware that some believedthat his children feigned their possession so as to be more cherished byhim.177MaryMoor was progressively alienated from others as a result ofher conviction that her daughter Margaret was genuinely bewitched. At theend of the day, John Darrell, more guilty of credulity than fraud, appearedmore a victim of the possessed than they of the Devil.And they drew large crowds. The audience is central to the event ofpossession and deliverance as event.

He confessed that hedid not wish to be dispossessed too soon since ‘many people did resort tohim, and brought him many good things’.183When Margaret Muschamp’sangels were due to return, many waited patiently for the appointed time.184The presence of crowds suggests not only the fascination in seeing thepossessed and hearing the Devil speak. The crowds also acted as judges onthe authenticity of what they observed, and consequently as witnesses tothe veracity of the events. The texts are full of the names of those who havebeen or can be called on to testify to what they saw and heard. But theywerenot merely observers. For they were active participants in the dramaof possession and dispossession. And they became emotionally involved. Inthe words of Rudolf Otto, these were numinous occasions. The mysteriousother which they confronted was both terrifying and fascinating, awe-inspiring but captivating.185Butthe thrill of the demonic was tempered bysympathy for the possessed. The onlookers wept out of pity. While MaryGlover was being tormented, there were many among the company whocried out, ‘Jesus help. Lord show mercy. Lord strengthen, Lord, confoundSatan. Lord, send deliverance.’186The story of Margaret Muschamp openedwith an account of her piteous state and the onlookers’ reaction: ‘She wassuddenly stricken with a great deal of torment...theuseofhertonguewas gone, with all her limbs, striving to vomit, and such torments as noeyes could look on her without compassion.’187Demoniacs became very much principal actors in a public drama. Therewerelong periods of time during which they stayed ‘in character’. During athree-hour period, Margaret Hurdman acted out with words and gestures‘the proud women of our times, who cannot content themselves with anysober or modest attire but are ever ready to follow every new and disguisedfashion, and yet never think themselves fine enough’.188Jesse Bee and Thomas Darling engaged in battle with Satan for longperiods of time. Joan Throckmorton had extensive public conversationswith the spirits which possessed her. Spectators saw Margaret Muschampconverse on many occasions ‘most divinely and heavenly’ for hours withher angels.189181SeeSharpe,1999,pp.45–6.182See [Barrow],1664,pp.5–6.183Anon.,1622,pp.69–70(see below, p.353).184Seeanon.,1650,p.13(see below, p.376).185SeeOtto,1958.186Swan,1603,pp.43–4(see below, p.317).187Anon.,1650,p.2(see below, p.365).188More,1600,pp.26–7(see below, p.210).189Anon.,1650,p.13(see below, p.377)."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26Demonic Possession and ExorcismTheir possessions were not shortlived. In only being possessed for oneday, Alexander Nyndge was unusual.190Protestant England did not witnessthe routinisation of possession that saw, for example, the French demoniacMarie des Vallees, possessed from1609to1655.191Possessions for months oreven years were common, although sometimes with periods of remission.The Throckmortons were possessed for three and a half years until April1593,the Lancashire seven from February1595to March1597with eighteenmonths’ remission during that time. Thomas Darling’s possession lasted forthe better part of the first half of1596,William Sommers’ for several monthsin late1597,with a number of re-possessions in the months following. MaryGlover’s possession ended in December1602,her torments having begunin late April of that year. William Perry was possessed for several monthsfrom Easter1620.Margaret Muschamp’s problems lasted from August1645until February1648,James Barrow’s for nearly two years.192Possession by the Devil then was a culturally available means by whichchildren and adolescents, and especially young women, escaped their sub-ordination. They expressed their powerlessness in the only way available tothem – through their bodies. In so doing they were empowered. Possessionbyspirits enabled them to break through the culturally imposed limits ontheir speech and behaviour. The worst excesses of their rebelliousness couldbe excused and laid at the Devil’s door. But they were often vessels, not onlyof the demonic, but also the divine. To the extent that they resisted thedemonic powers and strengthened the faiths of others, they were exemplarsof faith and piety. They manifested within themselves both angry rebellionagainst social norms and passionate adherence to them. Their rebellionthen was at a cost – the loss of themselves as integrated personalities, andthe creation of their bodies as tortured sites of conflict between good andevil.The signs of possessionThe bodies of the possessed were quite literally ‘bodies of evidence’, asJames Sharpe has pointed out. Anne Gunter’s body was ‘something uponwhich contemporaries could draw for proof of the ceaseless war betweengood and evil’.193The signs of possession provided the evidence that Satanhad taken up residence within.

John Fisher, for example, in1564,gave elevenevidences of Anne Mylner’s being possessed.194From the depositions pro-vided at the trial of William Sommers, the author ofAbrief Narrationin1598produced a list of twenty three signs ‘proving that William Sommersof Nottingham of the age of twenty years was possessed by Satan, and didnot counterfeit as some pretend’.195In1599,John Darrell gave a list offourteen evidences in defence of Sommers’ authenticity, and a year lateroutlined sixteen evidences of his possession. In hisDaemonologie,KingJames listed three defining criteria of possession, strength, physical rigidity,and the ability to speak various languages, though the last of these couldbe dispensed with were the demoniac possessed with a dumb and blindspirit.196After listing eighteen signs of the possession of the Lancashireseven, George More concluded that ‘the harmony and consent in signs andactions, both for the matter and manner of strange handling of all thesein their several fits, does make it evident that they were all really and cor-porally possessed’.197Morewent on to remark that some of his criteria ofpossession could occur singly or in combination without the Devil havingpossessed the person. But when all or most occurred, he maintained, andespecially when they were joined by any one sign beyond the power ofnature, then there was a genuine possession. In order to assist jurymen indetecting natural disease or counterfeit demoniacs, Richard Bernard listedten true signs of possession.198The criteria of possession evidenced in demoniacs in the New Testamentprovided many of these. John Darrell, for example, pointed to ‘crying,gnashing the teeth, wallowing, foaming, extraordinary and supernaturalstrength, supernatural knowledge, with sundry others to the number ofeighteen’.199Inaddition to those listed above, the biblical texts also includeviolence to self and others, inability to hear and speak, entering into coma-like states and pining away, nakedness, dwelling among graves, and in thewilderness. Of these, only the last two failed to occur among early moderndemoniacs. It is not perhaps a matter for surprise that most of the biblicalsigns of possession were common among the possessed of the early modernperiod. The author ofAbrief Narrationin1598pointed to the biblical signsof possession – extraordinary strength, knowledge, tormenting of bodies,194SeeFisher,1564.195Anon.,1598,sig.e.3.r–v (see below, p.284).196SeeJames,1597,pp.70–1.197More,1600,pp.47–8(see below, p.220).198SeeBernard,1627,pp.49–52.199Darrell,1599,p.9."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28Demonic Possession and Exorcismfoaming, wallowing, self beating, gnashing of teeth, casting into the fire –as evidence of possession in his own time.200Butthe biblical signs of possession were not the only signs of demonicpossession. Nor were they considered definitive of it. For it was recognisedthat some of the biblical signs of demonic activity could appear amongthose suffering from natural illnesses, and others were reasonably easy tocounterfeit. Early modern demoniacs had extended the repertoire of theirbiblical models. Out of their creativity, a theological virtue was made. Thus,for example, the author ofAbrief Narrationargued for the necessity of other,and less ambiguous signs of possession: ‘But seeing men in this matter aregrown more incredulous than heretofore, it has pleased God, besides thesigns of possession mentioned in Scripture, to give other signs also, morefrom cavil to make his glorious works most apparent and certain.’201Formany, the supernatural signs of possession, those which appearedto be beyond nature, were the defining signs. Supernatural knowledgeor clairvoyance, knowledge of other languages, levitation,202knockings,smells,203demonic ventriloquism, evidence of living things beneath theskin of those possessed, the vomiting of strange objects, were all seen asincontrovertible proofs of possession since, on the face of it at least, theydefied natural explanation.ForAbrief Narration,the running lump beneath the flesh of Sommers,about the size of a mouse was decisive: ‘This one thing alone, if therewerenothing else, is sufficient to convince any man whose heart is nothardened that Sommers did not counterfeit.’204There has been seen andheard running up and down Sommers’ body, reported John Darrell, ‘alump or swelling between his flesh and skin, in some part of his body of thebigness of an egg, in some other greater or less, moving immediately fromone leg to another, and so into the belly, making it as big again as naturallyit is, thence into his throat, cheek, forehead, tongue, eyes’.205The runninglump was attested to in three depositions inAbrief Narration.And Darrellelsewhere points to the depositions of twelve witnesses to it.206Itwas a phenomenon often reported among the possessed.

Michael Mac-Donald has demonstrated clearly how easily the speech of Napier’s patients‘could move from trope to true conviction that evil spirits worked within’.213Notsurprisingly, the reports of them occur in those works whose strate-gic intention is to authenticate a possession. On at least one occasion, theaccount of the running lump is clearly a literary invention. Thus, in the1615version of the possession of Alexander Nyndge, it was reported that ‘hewas often seen to have a certain swelling or variable lump to a great bigness,swiftly running up and down his body between the flesh and the skin’.214Itwas a phenomenon not reported of Nyndge in the original version, andmore than likely derived from reports of Sommers. It would be harder toaccount for the many reports from witnesses of Sommers’ running lumpwereit not for the fact that Sommers confessed to achieving the illusionbyvarious means.215Buthis own explanation of his manual dexterity doesnot adequately explain how so many could be so convinced by a trick thatought to have been easily seen through.216Atthe end of the day, it is notunfeasible to suggest that the will to believe may have been so powerfulamong those present as to create the perception that there was a lumpbetween the skin and the flesh of demoniacs.207Thwaites,1576,p.149.See also Whatmore,1943,p.464.208Bradwell, in MacDonald1991,p.11.209More,1600,p.33(see below, p.213).210Quoted by Ewen,1938,p.38.211See Ewen,1933,p.452.212Jollie,1697,p.54.See also Jollie,1698,pp.57,69;Taylor,1697,pp.44,47.213Macdonald,1985,p.203.214Anon.,1615,sig.a.3.v (see below, p.49).215SeeHarsnett,1599,pp.213–14.216Although one witness, grabbing at the lump, claimed to have seized hold of Sommers’ hands, andto have been able to expose and mimic other parts of his repertoire.

Clairvoyance was almost always found amongthe lists of signs, and few texts failed to give examples of it. John Cotta saw itas one of those signs which ‘detect and prove a supernatural author’.217Andit showed itself in a variety of ways. The Maid of Kent, for example, foresawthe death of a child.218And she was able to tell of events occurring elsewheresimultaneously of which she could have had no knowledge. Anne Went-worth was said to have told many men the secrets of their hearts.219JohnDarrell also claimed that William Sommers knew of things done and spo-ken miles away, and ‘to divers strangers coming unto him he made knownsuch secrets, that both they and others, upon the acknowledgement of thetruth thereof, wondered greatly’.220Four of the Throckmorton childrenwereeach able independently to gather the same kind of leaf from everyherb in the garden at the same time while in a state of trance.221WilliamPerry, the boy of Bilson, demonstrated his supernatural knowledge by dis-cerning whenever the woman who had bewitched him was brought into theroom where he was, even when ‘she were very secretly conveyed thither’.222Richard Dugdale had the useful skill of, among other things, being able topredict the weather.223The speaking of languages, usually Hebrew, Greek, or Latin, which ‘informer time they did never know, nor could afterward know again’224wasoften seen as decisive. Thus, for example, in1612James Mason reported onayoung man who, it was finally realised, was possessed by a devil ‘especiallybyspeaking of greek and latin’ of which the boy was formerly ignorant.225The two youngest girls among the Lancashire seven were able to answerquestions in Latin.226William Sommers answered questions in both Greekand Latin, although as Harsnett sceptically reported, only in single wordsand short phrases.227The illiterate John Fox was said to have blasphemedfearfully, ‘both in Hebrew and in Greek, cavilled and played the critic, andbacked his allegations with sayings out of the Fathers and Poets in theirownlanguage, which he readily quoted, so that the company trembled to217Cotta,1616,p.77.218SeeThwaites,1576,pp.149–50.219See Cox,1846,p.65.220Darrell,1600b, p.15.See also Darrell,1599,pp.13,37;anon.,1598,sig.e.3.r (see below, p.285).221See More,1600,pp.37–9(see below, pp.215–16).222Anon.,1622,p.60(see below, p.344).223SeeJollie,1697,pp.3,23.See also Blagrave,1672,pp.170–1;Sinclair,1685,p.138;Sharpe,1999,p.104;Cullen,1698,p.13;Barrow,1663,p.6;Drage,1665,p.40;Clarke,1660,p.92;Ewen,1933,p.97.For a contemporary account of how the Devil can know such things, see Bernard,1627,pp.64ff.224Cotta,1616,pp.76–7.225Mason,1612,p.20.226More,1600,p.41(see below, p.217).227SeeHarsnett,1599,pp.253–5."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction31hear such things from one that understood no learning, and that movedneither tongue nor lip’.228This ability to speak without moving the mouth, lips or tongue, generallyfrom the stomach (ventriloquy), re-inforced the belief that here, not thedemoniac but the Devil was the vocal source. Not only the eyes of thewitnesses but their ears also testified to the presence of the demonic. Fordemoniacs spoke in tones different to their normal voices. For their latertheatrical descendants, the ventriloquists’ ‘dummies’, the purpose was topersuade the onlookers that their moving lips expressed their own thoughts,and not that of another. But, unlike their wooden counterparts, these‘dummies’ did not move their lips. And therefore to the onlooker thevoice which spoke from within expressed the thoughts of another presencewithin the possessed.229The disjunction between voice and body, and the consequent convictionthat here were voices from the realms of Hell, was no doubt reinforcedwhen a voice with a low, deep, thick, male timbre emanated from a femalebody, or from that of a young boy. Joyce Dovey, for example, spoke ‘in abigger and grosser tone than her ordinary speech, and when she speaks,she looks fiercely with something arising big in her throat, and commonlywith swearing’.230John Fox spoke ‘with an audible voice in him, whichseemed sometimes to be heard out of his belly, sometimes out of his throat,and sometimes out of his mouth, his lips not moving’.231MaryGlover couldspeak with her mouth firmly closed,232Susanna Fowles in a shrill, hollow,counterfeit voice with ‘her teeth so fast set, that no endeavours could openthem’.233Thomas Cranmer in1533wrote of a maid from whose belly a voicewas heard which ‘when it told any thing of the joys of heaven, it spoke sosweetly and so heavenly, that every man was ravished with the hearingthereof; and contrary, when it told anything of hell, it spoke so horriblyand terribly that it put the hearers in a great fear’.234Inthe case of WilliamSommers, blasphemy, knowledge of ancient languages, and ventriloquismcould all come together. Thus, Richard Newton heard William Sommersspeak plainly ‘with his mouth wide open, his tongue drawn into his throat,so that there nothing could be seen of it but the roots in his throat, neitherlips nor jaws moving. And he uttered this speech among others, “Ego sum228Clarke,1660,p.93.See also, Gee,1624b, p.57;Jollie,1697,pp.7,23;anon.,1693,p.61;Baxter,1691,pp.83,126.229Onthe history of ventriloquism, see Vox,1993.Onthe relation of demonic possession and secularventriloquism, see Schmidt,1998.That in some recent films, ventriloquist dolls can themselves bepossessed is an inchoate reminder of their origins.230Anon.,1647,p.2.231Clarke,1660,p.92.232SeeBradwell, in Macdonald,1991,p.23.233Anon.,1698,p.16.234Cox,1846,p.243."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32Demonic Possession and Exorcismrex, Ego sum Deus”, with some other speeches, which this examinant couldnot understand well, for he is not a good Latinist.’235The passive body in general was a sign of the presence of the demonic.Tobe possessed by another was to be closed to sensations, impervious tothe world outside. William Sommers would lie as cold as ice, as if dead,‘senseless and speechless, his eyes out of his head like walnuts, his faceblack in a strange manner, and all his members and the parts of his bodyinstantly cold for the space of an hour’.236According to George More,the spirit threw Margaret Byrom backwards: ‘her senses were taken fromher, her eyes were closely shut up, her tongue was plucked double intoher throat, her mouth was open, her jaws set, and all her body stretchedout as stiff as iron. And thus she lay many times for the space of an houras a spectacle very fearful to behold.’237MaryGlover was rendered blind,dumb, and often paralysed.238Almost a century later, Christian Shaw was‘struck dumb, deaf and blind’. And like other demoniacs, her tongue wasimmobilised, ‘drawn to a prodigious length over her chin’.239Demoniacs were also thought to be insensitive to pain, and not to bleed,while in their states of trance. It was certainly one way to test their authen-ticity. William Sommers, for example, had ‘pins thrust deep into his handand leg to test if he did counterfeit. But he was senseless, and no bloodflowed.’240Anne Gunter had pins inserted in the ends of her toes, and inher breast ‘as if it had been a pinpillow’, but she did not bleed when theywere removed.241Itwas reported of Katherine Waldron, visited by KingJames around1597,that ‘she would endure exquisite torments, as to havepins thrust into her flesh, nay, under her nails’.242MaryGlover demon-strated her insensibility when she failed to react to hot pins being appliedto her cheek and close to her eye, and being burnt with lighted paper infive places.243William Perry never showed any feeling whether pinched,tickled, pricked with needles, or whipped with a rod.244235Anon.,1598,sig.d.2.r (see below, p.272).

As in modern times, eatingdisorders were more prominent among possessed females than males. Thetightly clenched jaw of the possessed was a visible sign of the malice of Satan.Elizabeth Throckmorton’s eating disorder progressed to the point whereher jaws were so tightly clenched that she could not take milk through aquill forced between her teeth.245Margaret Byrom was incapable of eatingand drinking for days at a time, alternating with periods of binge eating.246MaryGlover did not eat for eighteen days, ‘save by way of injection, orforcible powering down with a spoon, and that but a little at once, it wasso much resisted in passing down for all that’.247Demonic anorexia empowered the spiritual selves of the possessed, and,it was often claimed, with no loss to their physical selves. Their survivalin the face of their failure to eat, and their general well being, pointed toGod’s special care of them. Thus, Elizabeth Throckmorton’s relatives wereconvinced that ‘God’s mercifull providence and care towards the child’would see her through.248MaryGlover, at the end of her eighteen days offasting, was said to be ‘impaired neither in flesh nor strength’.249MargaretMuschamp would let nothing come within her jaws, though her lips weremoistened with milk and water. Her sixteen weeks of fasting seemed not tohave harmed her at all. Margaret, ever the model of piety, ‘would smile andshow her arms and breast, and say that God fed her with angels’ food’.250Satan took up his abode in the place from which he spoke. So it is nosurprise that he controlled what went into the stomach. Nor is it surprisingthat a sign of the Devil’s presence was the regurgitation of objects whichhe had presumably brought with him. It was undoubtedly one of the moreexotic evidences of his having taken up residence within the demoniac.In1616,John Cotta, for example, reported that the possessed had beenseen ‘to vomit crooked iron, coals, brimstone, nails, needles, pins, lumpsof lead, wax, hair, strawe and the like’.251Hesaw it as one of the certainsupernatural effects of possession. To his list, William Drage added knives,scissors, whole eggs, dogs’ tails, pieces of silk, live eels, large pieces of flesh,bones and stones, wood, hooks, and pieces of saltpeter, both vomited and‘voided by stool’.252The boy of Bilson added threepenny pieces, walnut245SeeAnon.,1593,sig.c.4.v.246See More,1600,p.30(see below, p.212)247Bradwell, in Macdonald,1991,p.4.See also, Fisher,1565,sig.a.3.v.; de Heer,1658,p.11.For maledemoniacs, see Kittredge,1956,pp.128–9;[Barrow],1663,p.5;Petto,1693,p.9.For naturalisticreadings, see Reynolds,1669;Casaubon,1672,p.52.248Anon.,1593,sig.c.4.v.249Bradwell, in Macdonald,1991,p.4.250Anon.,1650,p.3(see below, p.366).251Cotta,1616,p.76.252Drage,1665,p.5."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34Demonic Possession and Exorcismleaves, and feathers to pins, wool, thread, and any food he had eaten.253Anne Gunter’s repertoire was limited to pins, but she could not only vomitthem out of her mouth, but from her nose, out of her chest, and in herurine.254The eleven-year-old Christian Shaw merely vomited. But her listof objects was large: different coloured hair, curled, plaited, and knotted,hot pieces of coal the size of walnuts, straw and pins, sticks and bones, haymixed with dung as if from a dung hill, feathers, stones, lumps of candlegrease, and egg shells, said to have been vomited.255As with the running lump, where there were many who were no doubtdisposed to believe the evidence of their own eyes, others saw only skul-duggery.256And confessions of counterfeiting did occur.

In thereaction of the demoniacs to the cultic objects and rituals of Catholicism,the Devil was seen as legitimating Catholic doctrine and practice. In accordwith the more limited range of Protestant cultic paraphernalia and rituals,Protestant demoniacs were more limited in the range of objects and practicesthat provoked their outrage.

For Protestants, the biblical assertion thatthis kind only comes out by prayer and fasting was extended to all kinds ofevil spirits. But extended periods of prayer and fasting were also a centralpart of a developing Protestant regime of spirituality throughout the period,and believed to be efficacious for all manner of special needs.283And whilethere was a theological acceptance that deliverance from possession was upto God, there was too a conviction that prayer could wear the Devil downuntil he finally submitted and departed.284That it worked was, for thoseinvolved, more proof that Protestantism could be genuinely competitivewith Catholicism. Even among the sceptics, there was sufficient recognitionof its effectiveness to call forth an explanation. Thus, for the physicianEdward Jordan, for example, prayer and fasting is a natural remedy. Whenprayer and fasting work, he declared, ‘it is not for any supernatural virtue inthem, either from God or from the Devil...butbyreason of the confidentpersuasion which melancholic and passionate people may have in them’.285Itwas a view in keeping with the common medical belief of the time in thepower of the imagination upon the body.Protestant demoniacs, if not the Devil himself, clearly resented the pri-mary mode of deliverance – prayer. When Doctor Dorington began to prayfor the Throckmorton girls, ‘at one instant of time all the children fell intotheir fits . . . wonderfully tormented as though they would have been tornin pieces’.286When the bishop prayed with John Harrison, ‘the boy was sooutraged that he flew out of his bed, and so frightened the Bishop’s menthat one of them fell into a swoon’.287Others reacted vehemently to thewords ‘God’, ‘Christ’, or ‘Jesus’. At the mention of God or Christ, JohnBarrow ‘would roar and cry, making a hideous noise’.288Joan Harvey wouldspit at the name of Jesus.289InProtestant exorcisms, prayer and preaching was interspersed withreading of the Bible. As the prime cultic object in Protestantism, the Biblealso provoked rage in the possessed. Jesse Bee saw the Devil’s reaction tohis reading of the Bible in the presence of Thomas Darling as a way ofinspiring ‘due and godly regard’ for the Bible among the spectators.290Beewould call Satan to battle by reading the first chapter of the gospel ofStJohn.

On other occasions, he was thrown into fits at the fifth verseof the first chapter of the book of Revelation, and the twelfth and twentyfifth verses of the twelfth chapter of St John’s gospel.291Within Protestant demonology, the printed word had a quasi-magicalpower. When Mary Hall went to read in the Bible, the two spirits whichpossessed her would say, ‘“Mary, do not read;” or “Mary you will not read,for books are all against us;” Her Father would say, “She will read in spiteof all the devils”, and so she did always without interruption; for whenshe read she was not molested.’292The Devil tried on several occasions topersuade Thomas Darling to tear the book of devotions given to him byJohn Darrell. His first act, after his deliverance, was to take the book. And‘he read very cheerfully a good time’.293Frauds and fakes?Inthe early modern period, three possible causes of possessed behaviourwererecognised; genuine possession, illness, or fraud. On occasion, a com-bination of the last two was recognised as the best explanation. There wasno shortage of demoniacs, aspects of whose behaviour was exposed as trick-ery, or who confessed to having dissembled. And there was no shortage ofsceptics, in high and low places, eager to expose them. Agnes Briggs andRachel Pinder both confessed to fraud.294William Sommers confessed andreneged on a number of occasions,295although his defenders continued topoint to the impossibility of simulating many of the features of his pos-session.296Thomas Darling knew that he had sceptics among his audiencewhose credibility he needed to call into question, lest they damaged his.297With King James actively involving himself in possession cases from thetime of the possession of Mary Glover in1602,and Samuel Harsnett’sinvolvement in the cases of Darrell and the Denham demoniacs, secularand ecclesiastical politics were in play, and well publicised exposures werenot uncommon.298The medical explanations of Edward Jorden in the caseof Mary Glover, and the exposure of Anne Gunter no doubt created a newgroup of readers more open to the possibility of naturalistic explanations ofpossession.299William Perry’s guilt as an imposter droveThe Boy of Bilsonin1622.300Ifthe sub-title didn’t make it abundantly clear, to title a work291Seeanon.,1597,pp.13,17,19,22(see below, pp.166–71).292Drage,1665,p.33.293Anon.,1597,p.43.294Seeanon.,1574.295Seeanon.,1598,sig.b.1.r (see below, p.250).296Seeanon.,1598,sig.c.2.v (see below, pp.263–4).297Seeanon.,1597,p.42(see below, p.190).298SeeClark,1977.299SeeSharpe,1999,pp.180–1.300Seeanon,1622,title (see below, p.334)."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Introduction39The Second Part of the Boy of Bilsonseventy six years later was sufficient toalert its readers that demoniacal imposture was to be found.301Naturalistic explanations of possession and exposures of fraud also sig-nificantly affected the history of witchcraft.

The judges, itwas reported, were ‘somewhat discountenanced’ when they learned theyhad hanged nine innocent people.303As Michael MacDonald has pointedout, the examples of Glover, Gunter, and Smith ‘helped to increase theburden of proof and in doing so to refine the debate in terms that madeit harder and harder to resolve individual cases decisively in favour of thesupernatural’.304Such judicial care came too late to save the likes of JohnSamuel, and his wife and daughter.305Itwould be as unwise to take at face value confessions of fraud bydemoniacs as to believe confessions of witchcraft by those accused of havingsent the Devil into them. In both cases, the circumstances were often such asto be conducive to confession, namely, the hope of getting off more lightly.Certainly, the strategic intention of the texts makes it difficult for us to readbehind them to the actual events, and to be definitive about counterfeiting.Butthere are occasions on which the behaviour of the possessed was clearlyfraudulent. William Perry’s mixing his urine with black ink is a notableexample.306Butwecan say that the will to believe was as often presentamong spectators as the will to persuade was often among the possessed.Having said that, it is clear too that the line between simulated and non-simulated behaviour was not a clear one in cases of possession. The onepossessed person could at one time be both actively associated with and301Seeanon.,The Second Part of the Boy of Bilson: Or, a true and particular Relation of the Imposter,Susanna Fowles,1698.302Anon.,1593,sig.o.2.r (see below, p.144).303SeeKittredge,1956,p.323.304Macdonald,1991,p.li.305Seeanon.,1593,sig.o.3.v (see below, p.149).306Seeanon.,1622,p.64(see below, p.347)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40Demonic Possession and Exorcismdissociated from their actions. And the boundary between ‘authentic’ andsimulated behaviour shifted at various points in a demoniac’s career.Inshort, possession was learned behaviour. And it was ‘contagious’. AgnesBriggs became a demoniac the same night that she saw Rachel Pinder’sbehaviour. Possession spread like the plague among the Throckmorton chil-dren. Eventually, twelve people were possessed. Among the Starkie familyit began with one son and daughter, and eventually spread to another fivepeople. The demoniacs and their families were also often aware of otherepisodes of possession. William Sommers, for example, read the story of theThrockmorton children soon after his fits began, as had John Darrell.307Richard Mainy heard of the signs of the possession of Nicholas Marwoodbefore he ever visited Denham.308Anne Gunter’s father had read the storyof the Throckmorton children, a work by Darrell, and Harsnett’sADec-laration of Egregious Popish Impostures.Anne admitted that her behaviourwas much influenced by that of the Throckmortons.309The repertoire of demoniacs also increased during the period of theirpossession. Mary Glover’s behaviour ‘developed and changed in responseto the actions and expectations of others, some of whom as magistrates,physicians and divines were experts in what to look for’.310And what is trueof Mary Glover is true of most demoniacs who sustained their activitiesover time and in various contexts. They were seldom left in doubt aboutwhat was expected of them. Sara and Friswood Williams reported thatthe priests would often talk in their presence of the possessed overseasand the manner of their fits.311John Darrell would tell of the possessionof Katherine Wright, and of the scriptural signs in the hearing of ThomasDarling: ‘Master Darrell then also repeats unto them the signs of possessionmentioned in the Scriptures: as foaming at the mouth, and some others...Master Darrell told my friends in my hearing, that they should see me castinto very strange fits the next day, and namely (as I remember) that theyshould hear the Devil speak in me.’312When Darrell preached on the signsof possession in the ninth chapter of St Mark’s gospel, ‘the very same signsthere spoken of appeared most evidently in the said William Sommers inamost terrible manner’.313As the various signs of possession were namedin a sermon, the four youngest of the Lancashire seven mimicked thepreacher ‘with unseemly gestures, fearful looks, and ugly countenances in307SeeHarsnett,1599,pp.93,97,138.308SeeHarsnett,1603,p.400.309SeeSharpe,1999,p.62.310Macdonald,1991,p.xxxvi.311SeeHarsnett,1603,p.232.312Harsnett,1599,pp.273–4.313Anon.,1598,sig.c.4.v (see below, p.268)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Introduction41every particular, and in the very same instant and point of time when theywerenamed’.314Itwas to such theatrical aspects of possession and exorcism that SamuelHarsnett pointed as the key to its explanation as a theatre of imposture. ForHarsnett, the deliverance from possession was a carefully scripted perfor-mance, and the exorcists the writers and directors. As Stephen Greenblattremarks, ‘Harsnett is determined to make the spectators see the theateraround them – to make them understand that what seems spontaneousis rehearsed; what seems involuntary, carefully crafted; what seems unpre-dictable, scripted.’315This connection between theatricality and possession was noted byShakespeare, for whom, like Harsnett, possession and exorcism were fraud-ulent. As Stephen Greenblatt notes, it is the convergence of the exorcismand the theatrical that allows Shakespeare to borrow from Harsnett in hisdepiction of Edgar’s madness, hishysterica passio.Demonic possession, hewrites, is ‘responsibly marked out as a theatrical fraud’.316That Harsnett in hisADeclaration of Egregious Popish Imposturesfocusedon the exorcisms of the Catholic demoniacs at Denham was not accidental.The elaborate forms of Catholic exorcism with its attendant paraphernaliaof potions, fumigations, vestments, relics, sacraments, invocation of theSaints, holy water, holy oil, and so on, made for a liturgical event moreovertly ‘theatrical’ than the fasting and long prayer and preaching sessionsof the Puritan exorcists.Determined to expose both demoniacs and exorcists as collaborators inan elaborate drama, the metaphor of ‘theatre’ served Harsnett’s purposein demonstrating the fraudulent activities of both the possessed and theirdeliverers. But the image of theatricality is less persuasive if, as I have sug-gested, the boundary between simulation and authenticity in the possessedis opaque. And there is no logical incoherence in an exorcist’s accepting theauthenticity of possession, recognising the strategic value of a successfulexorcism for one’s church, and furthering one’s personal ambitions. JohnDarrell made the most of his opportunities. But, in spite of Harsnett’sclaims, there is no reason to suspect him of fraud.This is not to deny the theatricality of possession and exorcism. But itis to suggest that the roles of demoniac, exorcist, and spectator are playedout, improvised, developed, embellished, and refined in a series of ongoing314More,1600,pp.40–1(see below, p.217).315Greenblatt,1985–6,p.338.316Greenblatt,1988,p.119.See also Brownlow,1993,pp.107–31.See also Shakespeare’sComedy ofErrors(act4,sc.4),Twelfth Night(act3,sc.4,act4,sc.2), andKing Lear(act4,sc.1,act4,sc.6)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42Demonic Possession and Exorcismnegotiations and interactions between all the participants within the formatof a loosely constructed cultural script known to all the participants.

And for this reason, then as now, it is difficult to determinewhere the real and the unreal begin and end.The drama itself was ended only when the demoniac, delivered fromthe Devil and returned to normality, was integrated back into the humancommunity. Thus, for example, with the exception of Jane Ashton, theLancashire seven resumed their normal lives: ‘now they can pray and takedelight in praising God. They go to church to hear the word, and con-tinue there with much comfort, and are every way better than they werebefore.’317Those present at the deliverance of Alexander Nyndge, after aprayer of thanksgiving, ‘took the said Alexander, and all of them joyfullyaccompanying him, to his brother Thomas Nyndge his house, after whichhis coming thither, he was not known to be perplexed with the like terriblevexations.

On20January1573,weareinformed, he demonstrated a whole range of behaviours suffi-cient to lead them to this suspicion. His chest and body swelled, his eyesbulged, he shook, he refused to eat, he bashed his head and other parts ofhis body against the ground and the bedstead, he gnashed his teeth andfoamed at the mouth, a lump ran up and down his body between theskin and the flesh, he was horribly disfigured, and he showed enormousstrength.2Alexander’s brother Edward, Master of Arts from Oxford University, readthe symptoms quite differently. He saw them as the result, not of madness,but of Alexander’s being possessed by a demon. It was a diagnosis whichAlexander himself accepted: ‘Alexander Nyndge, having his speech thenat liberty, said to the same Edward, “Brother, he is marvellously afraid ofyou, therefore I pray you, stand by me.”’3Alexander now speaks from theplace which Edward has constructed for him and in the role which Edwardhas determined for him, as a person possessed by the devil. He physicallyshows the demon within: ‘And within a little time after, the body of thesaid Alexander, being as wondrously transformed as it was before, much likethe picture of the Devil in a play, with a horrible roaring voice, soundingHell-hound, was most horribly tormented.’4Something else speaks withinhim in ‘a base, hollow-sounding voice’.5The1615text was a much elaborated version by an unknown writer ofthe original edition of the1570swritten by (or at least ascribed to him in1The town ‘Lyeringswell’ listed as the place of possession on the title page is unknown.

The description of his torments in the laterversion is much developed, and includes many of the almost stylised featuresof possession that appeared in possession narratives between the time of thetwo versions. Into the mouth of the Alexander of the later text are placedseveral lengthy prayers of thanksgiving suitable for all occasions, and notmerely on deliverance from possession.Both versions of the text are driven by the assumption of the authentic-ity of Alexander’s possession. But, somewhat unusually for sixteenth andseventeenth-century English possession narratives, there is no suggestionthat Alexander is the innocent victim of witchcraft. On the contrary, thepossessed body of Alexander Nyndge is a visible sign, not of his innocencebut of his sinfulness. Alexander is himself the cause of the Devil’s atten-tion. But, ‘If you do earnestly repent of your sins, and pray to God forthe forgiveness of the same, my life for yours, the Devil cannot hurt you.’9Moreover, the Devil has been given permission by God to enter Alexander.Heis the instrument of God’s fatherly correction, sent to remind Alexanderof his duty to God. In the absence of bewitchment, God is seen to be theultimate and only source of possession. The story of Alexander Nyndge isthus a vivid reminder to the reader of the need for self-examination: ‘Fordescribing the horror and unheard of misery that fell on him, we may bethereby drawn to descend into ourselves, and to look into our souls whilethere is yet time, lest Heaven pour down its vials of wrath on us.’10Alexander’s final prayer is clearly intended to reinforce the message thatGodalone is the cause of deliverance. But, in the original text, the com-munity of believers is active. And it is their united action which is finallyeffective in expelling the devil. The twenty or more persons present say the6The use of the third person plural in the original text suggests the author was an eye witness.

The1615version locates the story of Alexander in a context of the history of evilspirits, and presents it as an example of the successful activity of thosemalignant spirits which have fallen from heaven. And Edward is clearlyfamiliar with the general rules of exorcism. The evil spirit who wishes onlyto speak to Alexander is forced to speak with Edward. Edward seeks outthe reason for the possession and is told by the demon that he has comefor Alexander’s soul and body. Edward and the demon engage in debateabout the propriety of prayer to the Virgin Mary (with the latter on theCatholic side). Peter Bencham, the town’s curate, demands of the spiritwhere he came from (Ireland), what his name was (Aubon), and whetherhe intended to leave (‘I would come out’).Demonologically, these activities variously constitute the developmentof the power of the exorcist over the evil spirit. More mundanely, the dia-logue with the demon enables the exorcist to manage the extraordinary.The engagement with the possessed through demonological discourse is‘intended to reclassify a protean uncanniness within an established lan-guage’.13Unlike a diagnosis of madness, the diagnosis of possession allowedfor the possibility of restoration to normalcy. The discourse and practicesof demonology provided a series of strategies to effect this return. At theend of the day, or at least at the end of six months, Alexander ‘was notknown to be perplexed with the like terrible vexations’.1411Anon.,1615,sig.b.3.r (see below, pp.55–6).12Anon.,1615,sig.b.3.r (see below, p.56).13Michel de Certeau,The Writing of History(New York: Columbia University Press,1988), pp.255–6.14Anon.,1615,sig.b.3.v (see below, p.56)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Atrue and fearful vexation of oneAlexander Nyndge: being most horribly tormentedwith the Devil, from the twentieth day of January To thetwenty third of July.

At the beginning, as God’s Word teaches us,he was created a holy Angel, full of power and glory. He sinned, and he wascast down from Heaven. He was utterly deprived of glory, and preservedfor judgement. This therefore, and this change of his, did not destroy nortake away the former faculty of devils, but utterly corrupted, perverted, anddepraved the same. The essence of Spirits remained, and the power andunderstanding such as is in angels. The heavenly angels are very mightyand strong, far above all earthly creatures in the world. The infernal angelsare, for their strength, called Principalities and Powers. Those blessedones apply all their might to set up and advance the glory of God, and todefend and succour his children. The devils bend all their force against46"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The story of Alexander Nyndge47God, against his glory, and against his truth and people. And this they dowith such fierceness, rage, and cruelty, that the Holy Ghost pictures themunder the figure of a great red or fiery dragon and roaring lion and, in verydeed, anything comparable to them. He has such power and authority thathe is called the God of the World. His Kingdom is bound and enclosedwithin certain limits, for he is the Prince, but of Darkness. But yet withinhis said dominion, which is in ignorance of God, he exercises a mightytyranny. Our Saviour compares him to a strong man, armed, which keepshis castle.15And what will we say, for the wisdom and understanding of angels whichwas given them in their creation, was it not far above that which men canreach to? When they became devils, even those reprobate angels, theirunderstanding was not taken away, but turned into malicious craft andsubtlety. He16never does anything but for an evil purpose. And yet he canset such a colour that, the Apostle says, he changes himself into the likenessof an Angel of light.17For the same cause, he is called the old Serpent. Hewas subtle at the beginning but continual practice and long experience havemade him much more subtle. He has searched out and knows all the waysthat may be to deceive. So that if God should not chain him up, his powerand subtlety joined together would overcome and seduce the whole world.There be great multitudes of infernal Spirits as the Holy Scriptures doeverywhere show. But yet they do so join together in one that they be calledthe Devil in the singular number. They do all join together, as our Saviourteaches, to uphold one Kingdom. For though they cannot love one another,in deed, yet the hatred they bear against God is like a band that ties themtogether. The holy angels are ministering Spirits sent forth for their sakesthat will inherit the promise. They have no bodily shape of themselves. Butto set forth their speediness, the Scripture applies it to our rude capacityand pictures them with wings. When they are to rescue and succour theservants of God, they can be present with them straightaway from the highestHeavens, which are thousand on thousands of miles distant from the earth.15See Luke11.21.16The Devil.17See2Corinthians11.14."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48Demonic Possession and ExorcismSuch quickness is also in the devils.

The recordsof their examinations and confessions were read to those gathered by thepreacher. That they publicly confessed to having counterfeited demonicpossession is not to be doubted. But whether their possessed behaviour wasintentionally simulated is not quite so clear. Different strands within thetext make possible alternative readings.The editor of the work remains anonymous, but he is responsible forwriting the preface, attaching a number of scriptural verses and part of ahomily of St John Chrysostom.1Heis also to be credited with includingfour other documents (or parts thereof ). Two of these were pamphlets, nowlost, which give two different accounts of the exorcism of Rachel Pinder.2Both were published shortly after16July, the date on which the handwrittenversion of the longer of the two was made. The third document gives anaccount of the examination and confession of Agnes Briggs, conducted byRobert Hodgson on the direction of Sir John Rivers, the Lord Mayor ofLondon, independently of and probably prior to the confession of RachelPinder. Archbishop Parker’s examination of Rachel Pinder and her eventualconfession of fraud on11August is the fourth document incorporated bythe editor.3The longer of the two different versions of the exorcism of Rachel Pinderconcludes with a list of witnesses, which include the two officiating minis-ters, William Long and William Turner, and fourteen others, among whomare their wives, Rachel’s father and mother, and (probably) her father’sbrother Peter and his wife, and his sister Susan Pinder.

The shorter account of theexorcism of Rachel is written down by George Allen (who was not listedas a witness in the first account) and may not have been present, and listsas witnesses to the event the two ministers, Rachel’s father, Sarah Davers(listed in the first account) and William Edwards (not previously listed).The clear purpose of both of these accounts is to attest to the authenticityof the possession of Rachel, and the authority of the ministers, who areprobably dissenters, to deal with Satan.Itwas the publication of these accounts of the exorcism of Rachel Pinderwhich motivated the Archbishop of Canterbury to examine her. ‘I havetravailed much by myself alone, for want of other commissioners’, he wroteon13August to Lord Burghley, ‘to try out a possession, which was veryearnestly believed, and set forth and by print recorded and spread withoutlicence. The two printers whereof with others that sold those pamphletswerecommitted to prison.’4Archbishop Parker’s letter to Burghley suggests that his examinations ofPinder were not unprejudiced. He saw demoniacs as socially disruptive.And he was convinced that Rachel’s mother Elizabeth was complicit insetting up her daughter as a demoniac. Failing to extract a confession fromElizabeth on11August, he imprisoned her at Westminster gate until Racheland Agnes had done penance at Paul’s Cross.The Disclosing of a late counterfeited Possession,decrying as it does thepublication of unlicensed books, was probably published with the approval,if not at the instigation, of the Archbishop. While accepting the realityof witches and sorcerers, the text mounts a series of attacks against thepopular acceptance of the reality of possession.The Prefacedeclares demonicpossession to be ‘mere vanity and falsehood’. The confessions of AgnesBriggs and Rachel Pinder are presented to counteract public acceptance ofdemonic possession and to warn that even ‘godly men’ like William Longand William Turner may act out of ignorance.As witches and sorcerers are not to be looked to as the cause of illness,so the text makes clear that they are not to be turned to for its cure. Thebiblical passages included by the editor exhort the reader to seek assistancefrom physicians and not from ‘wise men and women.’ And the homily fromJohn Chrysostom reminds the reader of those who have turned for help toGodand not to witches, soothsayers, or enchanters: ‘Therefore counsel thesick party manfully to suffer corporal pains, to the end that he might obey4Bruce and Perowne (eds.),1853,p.466.Note1confuses Briggs and Pinder."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60Demonic Possession and ExorcismChrist, and not to go to witches, or to counsel with wise women (as theybe called) which are Christ’s mortal enemies.’5Rachel Pinder was eleven years old when, according to her Mother, shehad become possessed by the devil. It was a claim made by Elizabeth Pinderat the home of John Foxe, author ofActs and Monuments, more commonlyknown asFoxe’sBook of Martyrs.Perhaps she was seeking endorsement ofRachel as a new form of protestant martyr, one persecuted by the Devilhimself, rather than his emissary the Pope.That Rachel was possessed was a conclusion that her mother had drawn,she told the assembly, as a result of Rachel’s entering into trances, swellingsand heavings of her body, and the vomiting of hair, a silk thread, and afeather. She also exhibited other typical features of demonic possession –demonic ventriloquy, visions of the devil in human and animal form, andaccusations of having been bewitched, in this case by an elderly womanJoan Thornton – all of which she eventually confessed to having feigned.Itwas from Rachel Pinder that the twenty-year-old Agnes Briggs wasto ‘catch’ possession, perhaps influenced by the attention and approvalwhich Rachel may have received. For she had been present at the home ofFoxewhen Elizabeth Pinder had ‘exhibited’ her daughter. On that samenight, after she returned home, Agnes began to enter into trances, and tovomit hair, and later lace, nails, crooked pins, to exhibit disfigured facesand strange voices and noises, all of which she too later confessed to havingfaked.Wedo not know if attempts were made to rid Agnes Briggs of herdemons. Presumably her fits ceased after her confession of fraud. But thepamphlets included within this text had the original intention of provingthat Rachel had been possessed as a result of bewitchment, and that shehad been successfully dispossessed in the presence of her family and friendsbyWilliam Long and William Turner. They report a battle of wits betweenthe Devil and the Protestants assembled, with victory to the latter. Theirpurpose is propaganda – to demonstrate that Satan (like Catholicism) isthe enemy of Protestants, and that they have the power of dispossession.Protestant dispossession by common prayer is already present. But Longand Turner also mimic Catholic exorcists: they ‘commanded Satan still, bythe mighty power and kingdom of Jesus Christ, to depart out of her.

They had been convicted of the bewitching ofthe five daughters of Robert Throckmorton of Warboys, and the bewitch-ing to death of Lady Cromwell, second wife of Sir Henry Cromwell ofHinchinbrook. After the deaths of the Samuels, the text informs us inits concluding paragraph, none of the bewitched children manifested anysigns of possession. ‘But they have all of them been in as good a state andas perfect health as ever from their birth.’1This was the first well-knowncase in England of accusations of bewitchment by possessed girls leadingto the deaths of those accused.Forthe previous three and a half years, the Throckmorton children hadshown all of the signs of the possessed. Around10November1589,Jane,ten years of age and the second youngest of the five girls, began to exhibitconvulsions and a trance. Within two months, all the sisters, ranging inage from nine to fifteen years, were having violent fits from several to manytimes a day, of which they later claimed to have no memory.2The oldestgirl Joan predicted that twelve people in total would be bewitched, herselfand her five sisters, and seven female servants. And thus it happened. Whenthe servants were sent away they recovered, but their replacements becamesimilarly afflicted.All of them, the servants and the children, blamed Mother Samuel, thenext-door neighbour, for having caused their afflictions. The accusationsagainst Mother Samuel continued until her execution in early1593.Threeyears after the first accusation against her mother, around Christmas1592,Agnes Samuel was also accused of bewitching the children. And in earlyMarchofthe following year, her father was implicated by Elizabeth, the1Anon.,1593,sig.o.4.r (see below, p.149).2The sisters ranged from the ages of nine to fifteen at the beginning of their possession: Joan fifteen,Maryaround thirteen, Elizabeth around twelve, Jane ten, Grace nine.

By Christmas1592,Alice Samuel had confessedall, but her daughter and husband remained defiant to the end.The overall intention of the text is clear. It is to persuade the reader thatthe daughters of Robert Throckmorton were genuinely possessed by evilspirits, that his neighbours the Samuels were responsible, and that theirdeaths were therefore warranted. Unlike the story of Agnes Briggs andRachel Pinder, the issue of whether the girls were counterfeiting was neverseriously addressed as a possibility, although there remains the textual hintthat Alice and Agnes had thought so.3The text also rejects a natural medicalexplanation for Jane’s behaviour. Dr Barrow, a Cambridge physician, havingexamined the girl’s urine and found no natural cause, suspected witchcraft.Being newly arrived in the neighbourhood and not having made any localenemies, it was not a diagnosis they were readily willing to accept.4But asone child after another fell ill, they became convinced.The text stresses the physical symptoms of the children, iterates andreiterates a set of ‘empirical’ tests for bewitchment upon various of thechildren. It emphasises the tests for witchcraft made with Alice Samuel,and then Agnes, and finally in court with John Samuel. Thus, it inexorablydraws them into incrimination by themselves and the girls. Granting theguilt of the Samuels, the text constructs the children as victims, justifies theexecution of the local yeoman Samuels family as perpetrators, and clearsthe gentle families involved in pursuing them – the Throckmortons, theCromwells, and the Pickerings – from responsibility for their deaths. It isclear that others within the community of which the Throckmortons werealeading family needed to be convinced that the Samuels were guilty andthat the decision of the Throckmortons to apply the full weight of the lawwas justified.5The matter was clearly urgent, for the text was written verysoon after the trial.The text thus provides a clue to the authorship of this anonymouslypublished work. It is more than likely edited and published by the fatherof the children Robert Throckmorton, with authorial contributions byanumber of people, Robert Throckmorton himself, Gilbert and HenryPickering, Dr Dorington the parson of Warboys, and Edward Fenner thepresiding judge.6The text falls into two main chronological periods: from3Seeanon.,1593,sigs.f.4.r., I.2.v (see below, p.106).4Seeanon.,1593,sig.a.4.r (see below, p.79).5Seeanon.,1593,sig.h.1.r (see below, p.116).6Daniel Walker sees the hand of Gilbert Pickering as the authorial one.

The childrenacted out an available cultural script – that of possession by evil spirits.With the possibility of fraud or natural illness ruled out, the continualclinical ‘testing of the spirits’ and the recording of the results over a longperiod of time by Robert Throckmorton and Gilbert Pickering (at least)attest to the conviction of the parents and their relatives and friends thatthe children were the victims of witchcraft. And the beliefs, attitudes, andactions of the parents reinforced the possessed behaviour of the children.All wrote and acted in a drama which sustained itself for three and ahalf years. The world created by the children and endorsed by the adultswas persuasive and pervasive; so much so that eventually even MotherSamuel herself was convinced of the connection between her presence andthe children’s health, and confessed to having bewitched the children on23December1592:‘“O Sir,” said she, “I have been the cause of all thistrouble to your children.”’15The Mother Samuel constructed by the girls is a stereotypical witch.

There is no hint that she had had confrontations with the childrenprior to their possession. Like any neighbour, she visits a sick child and sitscomfortably by the fire.17Twoand a half years later, she visits the houseupon the birth of a child to Elizabeth Pickering, an aunt of the children.18Eventually in desperation, she tries to present herself, like the children, ashaving been invaded by evil spirits.19Pitiful is her attempt, at the age ofeighty, to stave off execution by pleading pregnancy.20The text presentsher as victimiser. We can only read her as victim.The Throckmorton children constructed a similar picture of Alice’sdaughter Agnes. When she is bailed from jail and taken to the Throck-morton household, the spirits accuse her of bewitching the children allover again, and of intending to deal with them even worse than her motherhad done.21Butthe text also pictures an Agnes terrified of becoming impli-cated,22warning her mother not to trust those to whom she confessed,23submitting meekly to the tests demanded of her, but finally strong enoughto refuse to confess or to plead pregnancy: ‘it will never be said that I wasboth a witch and a whore’.24Itis only a month before his execution that we first hear of an accusationagainst John Samuel made by Elizabeth.25Hisresponse to her is of a kindwith other images of him in the text–adifficult, verbally abusive, andviolent man (though innocent of witchcraft). When found guilty he cursedhis wife: ‘A plague of God light on you, for you are she that has broughtus all to this, and we may thank you for it.’26Atthe time of her execution,Alice declared her daughter innocent. Her husband she declared guilty. Itwas her only act of malice.16Anon.,1593,sig.f.4.r (see below, p.106).17Seeanon.,1593,sig.a.3.r (see below, p.77).18Seeanon.,1593,sig.e.3.r (see below, p.95).19Seeanon.,1593,sig.g.1.v (see below, p.108).

Sometimes she would sneezevery loudly and thickly for the space of half an hour together, and presently,as one in a great trance and swoon, lay quietly as long. Soon after, she wouldbegin to swell and heave up her belly so that none was able to bend her, orkeep her down. Sometimes she would shake one leg and no other part ofher, as if the palsy had been in it, sometimes the other. Presently she wouldshake one of her arms, and then the other, and soon after her head, as if shehad been infected with the running palsy. Continuing in this state for twoor three days, amongst other neighbours in the town, the aforesaid AliceSamuel came into the house of Master Throckmorton to visit this sickchild. She dwelled in the next house on the north side of the said MasterThrockmorton. When the old woman came into the parlour, the child washeld in another woman’s arms by the fire side. So she went into the chimneycorner and sat down close to the child, the grandmother of the child andthe Mother being also present. She had not been there long but the childgrew somewhat worse than she was at her coming. And all of a sudden shecried, saying, ‘Grandmother, look where the old witch sits’ (pointing to the77"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"78Demonic Possession and Exorcismsaid Mother Samuel). ‘Did you ever see,’ said the child, ‘one more like awitch than she is? Take off her black fringed cap, for I cannot abide to lookon her.’ The Mother of the child, little then suspecting any such matter asafterwards fell out, was very angry with her child and rebuked her for sayingso. And thinking that it might proceed from some lightness in the child’sbrain by reason of her great sneezing and want of sleep, took her and laidher down upon a bed. And she hung curtains against the windows, therebyhoping to bring her into a sleep. But much ado they had to pacify and quietthe child. The old woman, hearing this, sat still and said never a word. Yetlooked very ruefull, as afterwards was remembered by them that saw her.The child still continued her manner of sickness, rather worse than better.Within two days after, her parents sent the child’s urine to Cambridge toDoctor Barrow, a man well known to be excellently skilful in physick. Hereturned this answer, namely, that he did perceive no kind of distemperaturesave only that he thought she might be troubled with worms. And thereforehe sent his medicine accordingly. But the child was no whit the better. Sowithin two days after, they sent again to the same man, declaring to himthe manner of her fits more at large. He said that the urine which theythen again brought to him showed no such kind of disquietness to be inher body. And the falling sickness,27which the parents did suspect to be inthe child, he would warrant her clear from that disease. Then he sent otherprescriptions as he thought good to purge her body, which took no placenor prevailed anything in the child like he looked for. Then the parents sentto him the third time, as his desire was to understand how his physick hadworked, declaring that it wrought nothing at all as he looked for, neitherthat the child was in any way recovered. Then Master Doctor, looking againin the urine, and perceiving the child’s body to be in good temper, as hethen said, for anything that he saw, demanded whether there was any sorceryor witchcraft suspected in the child. Answer was made, ‘No.’ Then he said,‘All surely cannot be well.’ For it was not possible that the child’s bodyshould be distempered by any natural cause as then was declared to him,and no sign thereof at all to appear in the urine. Notwithstanding, for their27Epilepsy."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children79better assurance, if the messenger would go to any other skilful man inthe town to take further advice, he said he would be very well contented.Whereupon the messenger went to Master Butler who, considering of theurine, and hearing the manner of the child’s trouble, said that he thoughtit might be the worms. Yet by the urine, he did not perceive it to be. Andif it were the worms, then it was a very strange kind of grief to be causedby them in that way. And he appointed the same medicine and physick(for the remedy) which Doctor Barrow had prescribed before. This, beingknown, was not applied to the child, because Master Doctor Barrow hadsaid that if Master Throckmorton, whom he wished very well, as he thensaid, by reason of ancient acquaintance with him, would follow his advice,he should not strive any more therewith by physick, nor spend any moremoney on it. For he himself said that he had some experience of the maliceof some witches, and he verily thought that there was some kind of sorceryand witchcraft wrought towards his child. After this answer from MasterDoctor Barrow, Master Throckmorton resolved himself to rest on God’spleasure, not striving any further by physick to help his daughter. Yet bothhimself and his wife were free from any such conceit of witchcraft, whichMaster Doctor Barrow did suspect, until within just one month after, thevery day and hour almost observed, two more of his daughters, older thanthe other by two or three years, fell into the same like extremities as theother sister before them. And they cried out against Mother Samuel, saying,‘Take her away. Look where she stands here before us in a black fringed cap,’which kind of cap she did indeed usually wear, but she was not then present.‘It is she,’ said they, ‘that has bewitched us, and she will kill us if you donot take her away.’ This thing did somewhat move the parents and strikeinto their minds a suspicion of witchcraft. Yet considering for what cause itshould be wrought on them or their children, they could not imagine. Forthey were but newly come to the town to live, which was but at Michaelmasbefore. Neither had they given any occasion, to their knowledge, either toher or any other, to practise any such malice against them. Within less than amonth after that, another sister, younger than any of the rest, about the age ofnine years, fell into the like case, and cried out against Mother Samuel as theother did."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80Demonic Possession and ExorcismSoon after, Mistress Joan, the eldest sister of them all, about the age offifteen years, was in the same state and worse handled indeed than any ofthe other sisters were. For she, having more strength than they, and strivingmore with the spirit than the rest, not being able to overcome it, was themore grievously tormented. For it forced her to sneeze, screech, and groanvery fearfully. Sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up herbody with such violence that, had she not been kept on her bed, it could notbut have greatly bruised her body. And many times, sitting in a chair havingher fit, with her often starting and heaving, she would almost break the chairshe sat in. Yet there was no striving with them in this state, for the more theylaboured to help them and to keep them down, the more violently they werehandled, being deprived of all use of their senses during their fits. For theycould neither see, hear, nor feel anybody, only crying out against MotherSamuel, desiring to have her taken away from them, who never came againafter she perceived herself to be suspected.These kinds of fits would hold them, sometimes longer, sometimesshorter, either an hour or two, sometimes half the day, yea, the whole day.And many times, they had six or seven fits in an hour. Yet when it pleasedGod to deliver them from their fits, they neither knew what they had said,nor yet in what way they had been dealt withal, as hereafter shall be declaredin particular.After Mistress Joan had been thus handled a while, the spirit, so it wouldseem, would sound in her ears something which she would declare in herfit. And amongst the rest, it showed to her one time that there should betwelve of them which would be bewitched in that house, in one way orother. And it named them all to her, being all womankind, and servantsin the house, herself and her sisters being five of the number. All whichproved afterwards very true, for they had all their several griefs. And mostof them were afflicted in the same sort and manner as these five sisters were,of whom and the manner of their faith, if it would be written in particularhow they were dealt withal, there would be no end of this book.And this may suffice to be known concerning the servants. When theyfirst fell into their fits, they all cried out against Mother Samuel, as thechildren did, saying, ‘Take her away, Mistress. For God’s sake, take her"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children81away and burn her. For she will kill us all if you let her alone.’ They hadthe same miseries and extremities that the children had. When they wereout of their fits, they knew no more than the children did, either whatthey had done or said. And presently, on their departure from MistressThrockmorton’s house, they were all very well as at any time before, and sohave continued ever since without suspicion of any such kind of vexations.And those servants that came in their places, the most of them were afflictedin the like way as the others for the space of two years together.On Friday the thirteenth of February,28being Saint Valentine’s Eve, inthe thirty second year of her Majesty’s reign, Gilbert Pickering Esquire ofTitchmarsh Grove, in the County of Northhampton, being Uncle to thesaid child, and hearing how strangely they were vexed and troubled, went toWarboys to visit and see them and also to comfort their parents. Comingto the house where they were, he found them all, at that time, very well,as any children could be. And about one half hour after, the said MasterPickering was informed that one Mistress Andley and Master Whittleof Saint Ives, and others, were gone to the house of Mother Samuel topersuade her to come to see and to visit the said children. And becausethey tarried long, it seemed to the said Master Pickering that they couldnot get her to come, although the said Mother Samuel had often said thatshe would come to the said children, whenever it pleased their parents tosend for her, and that she would venture her life in water up to the chin,and lose some part of her best blood, to do them any good. But now, asit seemed, her mind was clean altered. The cause was, as it was suspected,that all the said children, as it was said before, cried out against her intheir fits, saying that she had bewitched them, and that she also feared thecommon practice of scratching would be used on her. Nothing less at thattime was intended, for both the parents and the said Master Pickering hadtaken advice from good Divines of the unlawfulness thereof.29Whereforethe said Master Pickering went to Mother Samuel’s house, as much tosee her as also to persuade her that, if she were any cause of the children’strouble, it might be amended. He, coming to the said house, found therethe aforesaid Master Whittle, Mistress Andley, and others, persuading her281590.29That is, of scratching."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82Demonic Possession and Exorcismto visit the said children. But she, with loud speeches, utterly refused thesame. Whereupon, the said Master Pickering told Mother Samuel that hehad authority to bring her. And if she would not go with him willingly andof her own accord, he would force and compel her whether she would ornot. This he then did, together with her daughter Agnes Samuel, and oneCicely Burder, all of whom were suspected to be witches, or at the leastin the confederacy with Mother Samuel. And as they were going to thesaid Master Throckmorton’s house, Master Whittle, Mistress Andley andothers went ahead of Mother Samuel, Agnes Samuel, with the said CicelyBurder in the middle, and the said Master Pickering behind them. The saidMaster Pickering perceived that old Mother Samuel would have willinglytalked with her daughter Agnes. But the said Master Pickering followedso closely behind them that they could not confer. And when they came tothe door of Master Throckmorton’s house, Mother Samuel courteouslyoffered the said Master Pickering to go into the house before her, which herefused. And in the entry of that same house, she thought that, either thenor not at all, she would have had time to speak to her daughter. The saidMother Samuel thrust her head as near as she could to her daughter’s head,and said these words, ‘I charge you, do not confess anything.’ Which wordsthe said Master Pickering, being behind them, perceived. And he thrust hishead as near as he could between their heads whilst the words were spoken.And hearing them, he presently replied to old Mother Samuel, ‘You naughtywoman. Do you charge your daughter not to confess anything?’ ‘No,’ saysshe, ‘I said not so, but I charged her to hurry herself home to get her Fatherhis dinner.’ In the meantime, whilst these words were being spoken, MasterWhittle, Mistress Andley, and others went into the house. And three ofthe children were then standing perfectly well in the hall by the fire. But nosooner had Mother Samuel entered the hall but at one moment the saidthree children fell down on the ground strangely tormented. So if they hadbeen allowed to lie still on the ground, they would have leapt and jumpedlike a quick pickerel30newly taken out of the water, their bellies heaving up,30Ayoung pike."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children83their head and their heels still touching the ground as though they had beentumblers. And they would have drawn their heads and their heels togetherbackwards, throwing out their arms with great groans, most strangely tobe heard, to the great grief of the beholders. But not long after they werethus fallen to the ground, the said Master Whittle took up one of the saidchildren, which was Jane Throckmorton, and carried her into an inwardchamber, laying her upon a bed. And being a man of as great strength asmost be this day in England, and the child not above nine years old, yet hecould not hold her down on the bed. But she would heave up her belly farbigger and in higher measure for her proportion, than any woman with childready to be delivered, her belly being as hard as though there had been forthe present time a great loaf in the same. And in such a manner, it wouldrise and fall a hundred times in the space of an hour, her eyes being closedas though she were blind, and her arms spread abroad so stiff and strongthat the strength of a man was not able to bring them to her body. Then thesaid Master Pickering went into the parlour where the said child was. Andstanding on the further side of the bed from the child, viewing the state ofher, the said child presently stretched forth her right arm to that side of thebed next to the said Master Pickering. And there scratching the covering ofthe bed, said these words very often, ‘Oh, that I had her. Oh, that I had her.’Whereupon, the said Master Pickering wondered greatly what the meaningof the said words would tend to, and the rather, because the said MasterGilbert Pickering was of that opinion that scratching was merely unlawful.Yet the said Master Pickering put his own hand to the child’s hand whilst shewas speaking the words. But the child, feeling his hand, would not scratch it.But she forsook his hand and scratched still on the bed, her face being turnedto the contrary side from the said Master Pickering, her eyes being closed.And Master Whittle lying in a manner with his whole body and weightover her to hold down her belly, feared that she would burst her back.Notwithstanding the occasion being thus offered by the child, or ratherby the spirit in the child to disclose some secret whereby the witches mightbe by some means or token made manifest and known, the said MasterPickering went into the hall and took Mother Samuel by the hand. She"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84Demonic Possession and Exorcismwent as willingly as a bear to the stake. And he brought her to the furtherside of the bed from the child, who lay scraping with her nails on the bedcovering, saying, ‘Oh, that I had her.’ Then the said Master Pickering, invery soft speeches so that the child could not hear, said to Mother Samuel,‘Put your hand to the child’s hand.’ But she would not. Then the saidMaster Pickering, for example’s sake, put his hand to the child’s hand, asdid also Mistress Andley and others at the same instant. But the child wouldscarce touch, much less scratch any of their hands. Then the said MasterPickering, without either malice to the woman, confidence, or opinionabout scratching, only to taste by this experiment whereto the child’s wordswould tend, took Mother Samuel’s hand and thrust it to the child’s hand.The child no sooner felt the same, but scratched her with such vehemencythat her nails broke into splinters with the force and earnest desire thatshe had for revenge. Whilst the child was thus scratching, the said MasterPickering did cover Mother Samuel’s hand with his own hand, to test whatthe child would do in this extraordinary passion. But the child would notscratch his hand, but felt to and fro on the bed for that which she missed.And if, by any means, she could come with her hand or but with one ofher fingers to touch Mother Samuel’s hand, she would scratch that handonly and none other. Yea, sometimes, while the said Master Pickering withhis hand did cover Mother Samuel’s hand, the said child would put oneof her fingers between the fingers of the said Master Pickering and scratchMother Samuel’s hand that lay nethermost with that one finger, all her otherfingers lying on the hand of the said Master Pickering without moving.And in this passion, if at any time Mother Samuel’s hand was hiddenor withdrawn from the child, she would mourn and show apparent tokensof dislike, as though there had been some great discourtesy offered. Andthis is to be noted for a most certain truth, for so it was by the said MasterPickering at the Assizes in Huntington given in evidence, that the child’seyes were closed, so that she could not see any person, for so was the natureof their fits. And though at that time the child could have seen, yet herhead and neck were so turned backward into Master Whittle’s bosom, whocovered, as before is said, both her head, face, and body with his body in"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children85such a way and so closely that it was impossible for the child to see thecompany which stood on the further side of the bed.This being done, the said Master Pickering departed out of that place intoanother parlour, where there was a woman holding one of the other children.As the said Master Pickering passed by, this child scraped the woman’sapron that held her, saying, ‘Oh, that I had her. Oh, that I had her.’ Thenthe said Master Pickering went into the hall, and brought Cicely Burderto the said child. And, for brevity’s sake, as the said Master Pickering didwith Mother Samuel to the first child, so did he to Cicely Burder. And asthe first child did to Mother Samuel, so this second child did to CicelyBurder in all respects.31There was also a third child at that time in the hall who spoke the samewords. But the Father of the children, and Master Doctor Dorington,parson of the same parish, came then into the house, not allowing thatwhich was done, by reason of which the third was not put in proof.The same night after supper, the children being all very well and out oftheir fits, Master Doctor Dorington made motion to have some prayersbefore the company departed. The company then kneeling down, DoctorDorington began to pray. But no sooner had he uttered the first word, buteven at one instant of time all the children fell into their fits, with such terriblescreeches and strange sneezings, wonderfully tormented as though theywould have been torn in pieces. This caused Doctor Dorington to stop in themidst of his prayers and say these words, or the like in effect, ‘Were we bestto go any further?’ But he had no sooner stopped, and his breath ceased frompraying, but the children were quiet, but still in their fits. Then he began topray again. And then the children, or rather the wicked spirit in the children,forced them as before. This was proved often in the time of prayer. For whenhe had made an end of any one prayer, the children ceased and were quiet.When he began to pray, they began to shriek. When he ended, they ended.The next day, being Saint Valentine’s Day, the said Master Pickeringbrought home to his house at Titchmarsh Grove aforesaid, one of the31Although Cicely Burder is an early suspect, she is dropped from the story from this point."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86Demonic Possession and Exorcismsaid children called Elizabeth Throckmorton. Being in her fit, she was nosooner on horseback and out of Warboys Town but she was well. And soshe continued until she came into the said Master Pickering’s house. Butno sooner had she entered into the house, but the fit took her suddenly.Being not able to speak, gasping only, ‘Thus it comes,’ she pitched herselfbackwards. All the joints of her backbone were, as it were, drawn together.She thrust out her belly so strongly that none could bend her back again,being very strong and heavy. She shook her limbs, and oftentimes her headwhen it rises so high, but specially her arms, like those who struggle andplunge betwixt life and death. Being both dumb, deaf and blind, her eyes wereclosed up. Now this held her not a quarter of an hour. But with a gasp shecame again to herself, stroking her eyes as though she had been but asleep.Sometimes, being taken in her fit, she is but deaf only when she canspeak, or rather as we think the spirit in her, but very vainly. And she cansee also, but with a small glimmering when, if you look on her, you woulddeem her to have no sight at all. Sometimes also she can only hear, and noteverybody, but someone whom she likes and chooses out from the rest.Sometimes she sees only, and as plainly as any other, but neither hears norspeaks anything, her teeth being set in her head. Sometimes she both hearsand sees very well, and yet is not able to speak.Above all things, she delights in play. She will pick out somebody toplay with her at cards, but one only, not hearing, seeing, or speaking toany other. But being awake, she remembers nothing that she did, heard, orspoke, affirming that she was not sick but only slept.She continued well until night. And before supper, at the time of thanks-giving, it vexed her very strangely, taking her at the very name of grace, andholding her no longer than grace was in saying. She sat very well at thetable. But no sooner had she put up her knife, but it pitched her backwards.Then, being taken from the table, she was well until thanksgiving, all whichtime she was most grievously vexed and no longer. Afterwards, she wasvery quiet and well until motion was made for prayers, all which time itseemed as though it would have rent her in pieces, with such screeching andoutcries and vehement sneezing that it terrified the whole company. Butprayers being ended, she became quiet, but still in her fit."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children87Then Master Pickering, and others that were acquainted with the mannerof it, said that if any should read the Bible, or any other godly book beforeher, it would rage as before as long as they read. But because it was a thingvery strange, and therefore hardly believed, one did take a Bible and readthe first Chapter of Saint John, the first verse. At the hearing of this, shewas like one out of her mind. When he that read held his peace, she wasquiet. When he read again, it tormented her. When he ceased, it ceased.This divers did prove many times...32As it has been further very truly observed in this child Elizabeth Throck-morton remaining at Titchmarsh Grove, it follows to declare that everymonth, from March to July, she has had some vexation of body which istermed by the name of fits, because of the divers manner thereof, so thatshe was never clear and perfectly freed as it may be thought since her firstvisitation, although in some of the months she had but only one fit. Andnow, because it seems to give a fresh onset and a new attempt on her, wehave noted in particular how she has been variously handled.As for the manner of it, you have heard it before to be very strange. It isfirst perceived commonly to be in her belly by the great swelling and heavingup thereof. From thence, it arises up into her throat stopping the passageof her breath, so that she is oftentimes forced to draw the same with greatdifficulty as if strangling. Remaining there, it ties her tongue many times,and sets her teeth together. It will further ascend up into her head, and shakethe same as if she had the palsy, benumbing all her parts, and depriving herof the use of her senses. Sometimes it will be in her arms and hands in thesame way, sometimes in one place, many times in another, and sometimesin all places at once.For the continuance of it, it has been either short or long, mild or morevehement, as it pleased God to permit. For it has always from the beginningkept a very mutable and uncertain course in dealing with them...3332Iomit a section here which gives virtually daily details of her fits from February15until March18or thereabouts (sigs.b.3.v–c.2.r).33Iomit a section here which details the period from July29to September8(sigs.c.2.v–d.3.v).

If it were particularly tobe observed as is done in her, just as strange wonders, if anything hithertoseem strange, befell every one of them severally, as are these which youhave already heard. And by some of them were shown matters of far greateradmiration. But this may suffice, lest in entering into the rest, no end couldbe found, so infinite is the matter.It pleased the Providence of God that, not long after Master GilbertPickering had carried away this child to his house, about a month or so,the Lady Cromwell, wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, Knight, who then lay inRamsey, a town two miles distant from Warboys, came to Master Throck-morton’s house, together with her daughter-in-law, Mistress Cromwell,to visit these children and to comfort their parents, with whom she was wellacquainted. She had not long been in the house, but the children which werethere all fell into their fits, and were so grievously tormented for the time,that it pitied that good Lady’s heart to see them, insomuch that she couldnot abstain from tears. Whereupon, she caused the old woman MotherSamuel to be sent for. She dared not refuse to come, because her husbandwas tenant to Sir Henry Cromwell. After she was come, the children grewto be worse than they were before, which caused the greater sorrow. Thenthe Lady Cromwell took Mother Samuel aside, and charged her deeplywith this witchcraft, and used also some hard speeches to her. But shestrongly denied them all, saying that Master Throckmorton and his wifedid her great wrong, so to blame her without cause. The Lady answeredher that neither Master Throckmorton nor his wife accused her, but thechildren themselves did it in their fits, or rather the spirit by them. One ofthem, Mistress Joan by name, being then in her fit, hearing the old womanthus clearing herself, for she heard not the Lady nor any other, said thatthis time at Titmarsh Grove, the name of Mother Samuel is regularly invoked. On one occasion,Mother Samuel is said to have put a mouse in her belly (sig.c.1.r). On another occasion, she appearsto Elizabeth in a white sheet with a black child sitting on her shoulders (sig.c.4.r)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children89it was she that caused all this. And there is something, she said, that doesnow tell me so. She asked if nobody heard it but she. She affirmed that itsquealed very loudly in her ears, and marveled that nobody could hear it,wishing the old woman to listen to it. But Mother Samuel still continuedher denial. Then the Lady Cromwell would have taken her up into a cham-ber to have her examined more closely, Master Doctor Hall, a Doctor ofDivinity, being present. But by no means would she go with them, but ratherinvented many excuses to go home. In the end, when the Lady perceivedthat, by no good speeches, neither she nor any other prevailed with her,and that gladly she would have been gone, she suddenly pulled off her headscarf and, taking a pair of shears, clipped off a lock of her hair, and gave itsecretly to Mistress Throckmorton, Mother of the children, together withher headband, willing her to burn them. Mother Samuel perceiving herselfthus dealt withal, spoke to the Lady thus, ‘Madam, why do you use methus? I never did you any harm as yet.’ These words were afterwards remem-bered, although they were not at that present time grasped by any. Towardsnight, the Lady departed leaving the children much as she found them.The same night, after the Lady Cromwell departed from Warboys, shesuffered many things in her dream concerning Mother Samuel. And she wasvery strangely tormented in her sleep by a cat, as she imagined, which MotherSamuel had sent to her, which cat offered to pluck off all the skin and fleshfrom her arms and body. But such was the struggling and striving of the Ladythat night in her bed, and the mournful noise which she made, speaking tothe cat and to Mother Samuel, that she awakened her bedfellow. This wasMistress Cromwell, before named, wife to the worshipful Master OliverCromwell, son and heir to Sir Henry Cromwell, who that night was awayfrom home. Mistress Cromwell being awakened, and perceiving the Ladythus disquieted, awakened her also. She greatly thanked her for it, declaringhow she had been troubled in her dream with Mother Samuel and her cat,with many other circumstances which she did very well remember. Neithercould she take any quiet rest or sleep all that night after for fear thereof.Not long after, the Lady fell very strangely sick. And so she continued toher dying day, which was some year and a quarter after her being at Warboys."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"90Demonic Possession and ExorcismThe manner of her fits was much like the children’s, save only that she hadalways her perfect senses. For sometimes there would be pain in one arm,sometimes in the other, now in the one leg, by and by in the other, many timesin her head. Yea, sometimes it would take her only in one or several fingersor toes, and always shake the grieved part, as if it had been the palsy. And thatsaying of Mother Samuel, which she used to her at Warboys, which was,‘Madam, I never hurt you as yet,’ was never out of her mind. And thus, leavingthis good Lady in Heaven with God, we will return to these children.About Christmas after, the year 1590, for there was nothing noted all thattime although there befell a hundred wonders, Master Henry Pickering,uncle to these children, being then a Scholar of Cambridge, went to MasterThrockmorton’s house. And he stayed there some three or four days. Hedesired to speak with Mother Samuel. And choosing a convenient time, herequested two other scholars of his acquaintance, then being in the town,to go with him. They agreed to go. And presently they went without theknowledge of any in Master Throckmorton’s house. As they were going, shecame out of her own house, and crossed the street before them. When theysaw her, they determined rather to follow her whither she went than stay herreturn, because her husband was a contrary man, and would not allow her totalk with any, if he knew of it. She went to a neighbour’s house for some balm,and carried a little wooden tankard in her hand and a little barley in her lap, toexchange for the balm. When she came to the house to which she intendedto go, the scholar followed her immediately. And he heard her tell her errandto the wife of the house, who did not have that for which she came. Beingready to depart, the scholars desired to speak with her. But she seemedunwilling to stay. Yet they, entering into questions with her, kept her therefor a little. But she was very loud in her answers, and impatient, not allowingany to speak but herself. One of them desired her to keep a woman’s virtue,and be more silent. She answered that she was born in a mill, begot in akiln, she must have her will, she could speak no more softly. The greatestpart of her speech was railing words against Master Throckmorton and hischildren. She said that he did misuse her in allowing his children so toplay the wantons in accusing her and bringing her name into question. She"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children91often repeated that the children’s fits were nothing but wantonness in themand that, if they were her children, she would not allow them so to escapewithout punishment, one after the other. The scholars inquired about herservice of God, and profession of her faith. But all that they could get fromher was that her God would deliver her, her God would defend her, andrevenge her of her enemy. She always used the phrase, ‘My God will dothis and that for me,’ which, being noted by one of them, he asked her ifshe alone had a God, or if she did not serve the same God that others did?She answered, yes, that she did. Yet much ado they had to bring her fromthe phrase ‘My God,’ to say ‘The God of Heaven and earth.’ In the end shewould needs be gone, saying that her husband would beat her for her longtarrying. Then the uncle of those children, being somewhat more movedthan the rest, said at the parting that, if she were the woman that had wroughtthis wickedness on these children, the vengeance of God would surely waiton her to death. And however she might deceive herself, and she would foratime, yet there was no way to prevent the judgements of God but by herconfession and repentance, which if she did not in time, he hoped one dayto see her burned at a stake. And he said that he himself would bring fireand wood, and the children would blow the coals. Her answer to him wasthis, for they were then in the street hard by a pond. ‘I had rather,’ said she,‘see you doused over head and ears in this pond.’ And so they parted.Now to come to the point, the eldest of Master Throckmorton’s daugh-ters34was then in her fit, sitting at home in a parlour. Her Father andgrandmother, with some other of her sisters in their fits, were present withher. Suddenly she said, ‘Now is my uncle,’ naming him, ‘and the two others,’whom also she named, ‘going to Mother Samuel. We shall hear some newsby and by.’ Presently she said, ‘Look where Mother Samuel goes, crossingin the streets before them, with a wooden tankard in her hand, and her apronso tucked up before her. I believe,’ says she, ‘there is somewhat in it. Sheis gone into such a man’s house that keeps an alehouse.’ The man’s nameshe could not hit on, but described him by his red head. ‘Hark,’ said she34Joan."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"92Demonic Possession and Exorcismto her sisters, ‘Mother Samuel is very loud, and my uncle bids her speaksoftly, but she says she cannot.’ And she repeated to her Father and therest the same words, viz., that she was born in a mill, &c., in the same waythat Mother Samuel spoke them to her uncle and the other scholars. Tobe short, she declared particularly every word that passed between MotherSamuel and those scholars at that time. And at the parting she said, ‘ThereMother Samuel, my uncle did touch you I think.’ And she repeated againthe very same words that her uncle had done, wishing that that day were oncecome. ‘For I myself,’ said she, ‘would blow the coals.’ But it had been asgood as if he had said nothing to her, said she, for she wished him over thehead and ears in the pond for it. Master Throckmorton was standing by andhearing all this. After the child had said that now Mother Samuel and thescholars were parted, he inquired of his brother, the child’s uncle, askingif he knew whither he was gone. Answer was made that he had not comehome from the Church since evening Prayer, for it was on a Saturday, butnobody knew where he was. ‘It may be,’ said Master Throckmorton, ‘thathe is with Mother Samuel.’ And immediately he went out of his own houseto see if he could perceive where they were. As he went, he met them in theChurchyard coming from Mother Samuel’s. ‘Where have you been,’ saidhe? They told him. ‘I could have told you as much myself,’ he said. Andhe repeated to them the whole matter, as his daughter before had shown.When they had come into the parlour where she was, there was also anotherof her sisters in her fit sitting by. And this her other sister could hear hersaid uncle speak to her, and nobody else. And so by her mouth, for theycould for the most part hear one another in their fits, he inquired of hersister all those matters over again, which she did in his own hearing repeat.‘But,’ said she, ‘the wind was so great that I had much ado to hear them,’whereas indeed there was then no wind stirring. After this, the spirit, or thething, as the children called it, would many times appear to them in theirfits in some kind of shape or other, but most commonly in the likeness ofadun35chicken, and would talk familiarly with them, saying that they camefrom Mother Samuel, whom they called their dame, and were sent by herto the children to torment and vex them in that way. It would declare to the35Mouse-coloured."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children93children many times concerning Mother Samuel, insomuch that she coulddo almost nothing at home for a great time, but the spirit would discloseit. If it were required by the children in their fits, viz., to know what shewas then doing at home or in what place of her house or elsewhere she was,the spirit would tell. This was proved true by a messenger presently sent onpurpose.Now the spirits manifestly began to accuse Mother Samuel to thechildren in their fits saying that it was she that had bewitched them andall those servants which were bewitched in the house. And the spirits toldthem that, whenever they were in their fits and were either carried to MotherSamuel’s house or she forced to come to them, they would presently be well.This was proved true many times, and never failed once. So if the childrenwere at any time in their fits, and in such a state that a strong man couldscarcely hold them, they would so struggle, jump, and sprawl in his arms,and were carried to Mother Samuel’s house, for it was a very hard thing toget Mother Samuel to Master Throckmorton’s house. Yet if they came butonce to the threshold of Mother Samuel’s door, they would wipe their eyesand say, ‘I am well. Why do you carry me? Set me down,’ as though someshame had been offered them, in that they were carried in the streets, notknowing anything of the state in which they had been. While they remainedin the house, they were very well. But determining once to come away, andoffering to come out of the door, they fell presently down on the ground, andwere brought from thence in the same state that they were carried thither.Contrariwise, whenever Mother Samuel came to Master Throckmorton’shouse, whatever kind of extremity these children were in, as it was mostwonderfully strange to see them many times, as soon as ever she had set footinto the parlour or hall where they were, they would all presently jump uponto their feet and be as well as any in the house, and so continue while shewas present. But when she went to depart, they would all sink down as a stoneon the ground. If she turned but her face again and came towards them, theywould be as well as before. This was tried twenty times in one hour. Andwhen she departed from the house, she left them in the same state whereinshe found them, so long as their fit continued upon them. After this, MasterThrockmorton thought good to disperse his children. And he sent them"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94Demonic Possession and Exorcismabroad, some to one friend’s house, some to another for a time, to see howthey should be dealt withal. Yet he always kept some one of them at homewith him.If it should be declared how these were all severally handled for the timethey were abroad, it would take a long discourse, and longer indeed thanis thought meet at this time, although very strange things, and such as mayseem worth the noting befell every one of them, such as this for example.Being in their fits, they could tell in what case or state their other sisterswere at that instant, some of them being separated eight, ten, or twelve milesasunder. And they have said, ‘Now is my sister’, naming her and the placewhere she was in her fit, ‘very sore handled’, as she herself also was at thatinstant. It was proved to be most true by the just computation of times,with many such like things.But this may suffice concerning them being abroad, that they were neveraltogether clear and free from their fit, although it be true that some ofthem, whether at home or abroad, had not their fits above once in a month,sometimes once in half a year, and one of them was clear a whole yeartogether. And this also is verified and true in some other of these fivesisters, that they were never clear nor free from some kind of fit or otherthree weeks together, I think, scarcely three days since the first day it tookthem except now, since last Assizes in Lent, at which time these witcheswere executed.To pass over all that which might be spoken of them for a year andalmost a half,36we will come nearer to these latter times, wherein thespirits, whether moved by their own malice, as it surpasses the reach ofman to sound the depth of the Devil’s malice to mankind, or moved bythe malice of the senders and setters on, or both, it is not known. Orwhether for the conclusion and consummation of their parent’s patiencein this point, it pleased the wisdom of God, who in his Providence haddetermined their end, to grant them therefore more liberty for the time, toexercise their malice against these children, we leave it to God. But truth itis, that they were more strangely vexed, and more grievously tormented intheir body now of late, and take them generally altogether, than at any time36Toaround mid1592."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children95almost from the beginning. And to begin this time at Michaelmas37lastpast, or thereabouts, four of these children were all together at Warboys intheir Father’s house, and the fifth, which was the eldest of them, was at herUncle’s house, Gilbert Pickering Esquire, dwelling at Titchmarsh Grove.About this time, which was Michaelmas 1592, one of these four children,the youngest save one,38near the age of fourteen years, was in a very strangekind of fit, the manner of which was as follows. Every day for the spaceof three weeks or more, she had a senseless fit, some time of the day orother, and sometimes many fits in one day. In this fit, she could neither hear,see, nor speak to anybody. Besides her inward grief, she would heave andstart and swell up her body, which was very troublesome to her for a time.When she was out of these fits, she would go up and down the house verywell. She would eat and drink, and sometimes be very pleasant in outwardgesture with her sisters. She would do anything which, by any sign, she didunderstand should be done. She would make a reverence as she passed byto those where she saw it was due, insomuch that any man ignorant of herstate could perceive nothing to be amiss in her. Yet she would never speakto any in particular. Neither could she hear any that spoke to her duringthat time, except sometimes she would prattle a little to an infant, whichwas newly home in the house, in which she took great delight.It pleased God that, around the beginning of these kinds of fits in her,an aunt of hers was then in the house. She was delivered of a child, uponwhich occasion many of her uncles and aunts, and other kindred and friends,resorted to the house. And some of them stayed a week or ten days together,all which time the child was in these kinds of fits. And as it happened, MotherSamuel amongst the rest came to the house. And she was brought up intothe gentlewoman’s chamber, where commonly the greatest company was.As soon as she came in, the child in question, being there, espied her. Andpresently she spoke to her, bidding her welcome, and saying that she wasagreat stranger there. She fetched her up both meat and drink, and woulddo anything readily that she willed her to do. In the end, she asked MotherSamuel whose that little child was which she herself had in her arms. Theold woman told her, and likewise the name of it, which thing she had also3729September1592.38Probably Jane."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96Demonic Possession and Exorcismdemanded. The child marvelled, saying, ‘Is my aunt brought to bed? I amvery glad of it. Why then,’ she said, ‘such and such of mine uncles and auntspromised to be here.’ They were then indeed in the house, and some ofthem in that company. Then Mother Samuel told her that such and suchwhom she asked for were present. The child said that she saw nobody buther and that little child which she had in her arms, although she looked fullin their faces. Many such like strange things then fell out, which are toolong to speak of. When the old woman departed, the child lost the use ofall her senses, and continued in the same state in which she was when theold woman came into the house.When she had continued thus three weeks or more, one day she cameout of her aunt’s chamber into the hall. And she had not been there long,but she fell into a most troublesome fit for the time. But it did not continuelong. Presently she spoke and said, ‘I am glad, and very glad,’ repeating itoften. Suddenly, she wiped her eyes and came out of her fit. Her Mother,being in the hall, she asked her blessing, and inquired of many things. Andamongst others, she asked how her aunt did, from whom a little before shehad come. And she knew of nothing that was done, nor that any companyhad been there for the space of three weeks before.It follows to speak of the rest of her sisters together with herself, all ofwhose grief and extremity of troubles increased, as the year grew towards anend, insomuch that every day brought with it increase of pain, and strangenessin their manner of fits.Towards Hollantide,39the spirits grew very familiar with the children.And commonly, towards the end of their fits when the greatest troublewas over, they would talk with them half an hour together, and sometimeslonger. The greatest matter of their talk was about the manner of fits whichthey would have, and concerning Mother Samuel, whose pleasure it wasthat they should be so used. But the spirits said many times that they wouldbring her to shame for it in the end. If in this time, being in their fits, theyhad inquired of their spirit when they would come out of that fit in which39All Saints’ Day,31October."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children97then they were, and when they should have another, it would have told them,and not missed any whit at all.If they had asked how many fits they should have the next day following,and the third day, or any day that week, and how many fits they should havein one day, and what manner of fits they would be, whether more grievousor less, how long every fit should continue, and in what part of the day theyshould begin, and when they should end, it has told them, and not failed inany one point. For it has been presently set down in writing, as the childrenhave spoken it, for it was not possible to remember the times for them all,and proved wholly true.The times and signs which the spirits did appoint to them, for thebeginning or ending of their fits, were usually these: In the morning, assoon as they did offer to arise out of their beds; as soon as they wereup or ready; as soon as they asked their Father or their Mother or theirgrandmother blessing; as soon as they took a book in hand to pray or whenthey had ended their prayers; as soon as they went to breakfast; as soon asdinner was set upon the board or as soon as they did offer to say grace eitherbefore or after dinner; as soon as they themselves were set down to dinneror at the first bit of meat they put in their mouths; or as soon as dinner wasended or they had put up their knife after dinner. The same circumstanceswere also observed at supper. Or if it had been on the Sabbath day, or anyday on which the bells ought to be rung, as soon as the first, second, or thirdpeal rings, or has done ringing, with many such like signs, which would betoo long to speak of, appointed by the spirit for the children to fall in orout of their fits, which they duly observed, and failed not a minute, as maybe thought.After they had continued in this state about a month together or there-abouts, whether the spirits were weary, as they oftentimes said to the childrenin their fits that they now waxed weary of their dame Mother Samuel, orwhether through the power of God’s goodness and special protection ofthe children, the spirits perceived that their own malice and the malice oftheir dame to the children was restrained and kept under in such a way thatthey could not kill the children as they desired. For we may not think that it"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98Demonic Possession and Exorcismagrees with the nature of the evil spirit to sport and play with man, as thesespirits oftentimes did with these little children. They said to them that now,before long, they would bring their dame either to her confession or confu-sion. And this was the greatest stay of comfort and prop of patience whichthe parents and friends of these children always had. Namely, when thesechildren were in their greatest torment and miseries as might be devised,in such a way as made the heart of the beholders many times to melt intheir bodies, being without all hope ever in this world to see them aliveagain, yet whenever it pleased God to deliver them out of their fits, theywould wipe their eyes and be presently well as if it had never been they, notknowing anything that had befallen them. So that now it would seem thatGod himself would take the matter into his own hands. And having in hiscounsel determined an end thereof, so he would also appoint the means tobring it to pass, which was even by the spirits themselves, the instrumentsof this wickedness. For now they began to accuse Mother Samuel openlyto her face, and say that they will not be well in any place, unless they stay inher house, or she be brought to stay with them. And besides that, they shallhave more troublesome fits than ever they had, except one of these two bebrought to pass.Master Throckmorton, still thinking that the spirits might lie, was con-tent to try the uttermost for three weeks together. All this time, his childrenhad very many most grievous and troublesome fits, inasmuch that when nightcame, there was never a one of them able to go to their beds alone, theirlegs were so full of aches and pains. They had many other griefs besides intheir bodies, being out of their fits, which were not usual with them. Andone of them also, for all that time of three weeks, never had use of her legs,except it were an hour or two in one day while Mother Samuel was in thehouse. And then she was able to walk and was very well, as the rest alsowere. Otherwise her legs were thrust up to her body as if they had been tiedwith strings. And where you set her down, there you would find her, unlessshe crept away.Master Throckmorton perceived that by no means could he get permis-sion of old John Samuel for the old woman to come to his house, although"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children99he offered to allow him up to ten pounds in the year for the board and wagesof the best servant in Huntington Shire to do his business in her steadif he wished, besides his promise and bond if he required it, for the wellusing of his wife while she was with him. He could find no other remedyfor the health of his children but to carry them thither which he did. Assoon as they came into the house they were all presently well. Realisingthis, he said that his children should dwell there and that they should notgo out of the house. He would provide for their necessities. The man40seeing that there was no striving with the company extinguished the firealthough it was a cold season. He said that he would starve them, besidesvery many evil words which came from him and his daughter at that time.All that day they continued there very well, and did both eat and drink,and read in their book, and were very merry. At night, when the man, JohnSamuel, perceived that they would lodge there, he thought that they wouldbe very troublesome to him. And therefore he gave his faithful promise thathis wife would come to Master Throckmorton’s house the next morning,and stay with him. Whereupon Master Throckmorton took his childrenhome. And they were in their fits as soon as they came out of his doors, andso continued all that night. The next morning Master Throckmorton wentfor the old woman. But she was gone, nobody knew whither. So he sentagain for his children who, as soon as they came into the house, were well.Towards night, the old woman came in. She said that she had been two orthree miles out of the town. And her husband knew of her going, becauseshe would not come to Master Throckmorton’s. When he understood thatshe had spoken, for she spoke it privately, desiring them to whom she spokeit not to tell her husband, he utterly denied the matter. And presently hefell on his wife and beat her very sorely with a cudgel, many being present,before she could be rescued by them. In the end, when the man perceivedMaster Throckmorton still to continue in the same mind aforesaid, he wascontent to let his wife go home with them that night. All went to MasterThrockmortons house very well together and so continued the space of40John Samuel."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100Demonic Possession and Exorcismnine or ten days following, without any manner of soreness, lameness, orany manner grudging of fits, and in better state than they had been, as it waswell known all of them together, for the space of three whole years before.This made the parents right glad, and to use the woman as a welcome guest.At the ten days’ end, the old woman entreated Mistress Throckmorton, forher husband was gone forth that morning, that she might go home, makingher excuse to fetch something that she wanted. Mistress Throckmortonwas very reluctant to grant it, promising that she herself would rather fetchwhat she would have than that she should go out of her house. Yet theold woman said that nobody could come by that thing that she would havebut herself, which happily was true. And promising her present return, sheyielded to her request.Soon after she was gone, some of the children fell into their fits again asbefore times. And the spirit then talking with them said that now MotherSamuel was feeding her spirits, and making a new league and agreement withthem. This was that, although now she came again to the house, they wouldbe no whit the better but rather the worse for her being there, becauseshe did not wish to remain there any longer. This thing seemed to betrue that the child spoke. For as soon as she came again, which was notbefore she was sent for four or five hours after she went, the children whichwere in their fits at her coming, so continued. And they that were not, afterher coming, fell into their fits, all of them crying out that now MotherSamuel had made a new agreement with her spirits, and now they shouldbe no whit better for her presence, but rather the worse.Master Throckmorton, when he came home and perceived the state withhis children otherwise than when he left it, and the cause why, could notbe but heartily sorry. Yet he referred all to the good pleasure of God, andwould not allow the old woman to depart his house, chiefly for this cause,because his children being in their fits, could neither hear, see, nor speakto anybody but to her. And some of the children could take nothing butthat which she either gave them or touched with her hands.Mother Samuel thus remained with the children. She could not be inany place of the house alone, nor doing anything about the house, but the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children101children in their fits would reveal it, specially when she was feeding herspirits. For then the children would say, ‘Now is Mother Samuel in suchaplace of the house feeding her spirits.’ When they went and looked, therethey would find her, but whether doing any such thing or not, God and herconscience are the best witnesses.Many times also, as she sat talking with these children being in their fitsby the fire side, they would say to her, ‘Look you here, Mother Samuel,do you not see this thing that sits here by us?’ She would answer, ‘No,’not she. Why, they would say again, ‘I marvel that you do not see it. Lookhow it leaps, skips, and plays up and down,’ pointing at it with their fingershere and there as it leaped. Sometimes also they would say, ‘Hark, MotherSamuel, do you not hear it? Hark how loud it is. I marvel you do not hearit. No, you cannot but hear it.’ She would deny it, and bid them ask theirFather, or some other whom she saw standing by whether they heard it ornot. The children would answer that they saw nobody although they stoodhard by them. Then would they tell Mother Samuel that it tells them thatshe both hears it, sees it, and sent it. The Father of these children, MasterThrockmorton, to make a kind of test of this matter, one night willedMother Samuel, as he might have done to any other then being present, toname how many fits those three children that then were in their fits, wouldhave the next day following, and what kind of fits they would have, whenthey would begin, and how long they would continue. Mother Samuel wasvery reluctant to do it. Yet, in the end, their Father said that she shoulddo it. She said, ‘One of them will have three fits,’ naming the child, suchand such for the manner, namely, easy fits, appointing the time for theirbeginnings and endings. ‘The other will have two in a like way,’ the timeappointed by her. And the third will have none, but be well all the day. Allwhich fits proved very justly in every one of them the next day, as she hadspoken.At another time not long after, Mother Samuel was sitting by thesechildren being in their fits as before. Master Throckmorton, their Father,and some other also being with him, demanded of Mother Samuel sayingthat he had heard that those that were acquainted with these spirits, as the"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102Demonic Possession and Exorcismchildren say that she is, and had retained them in their service to do forthem as they commanded, did feed them and reward them with some thingfrom them, but most usually with their blood, and that every day. ‘Nowtherefore,’ said he, ‘make open confession and shame the Devil in tellingthe truth, whether you do any such thing or not.’She most vehemently denied it, with many bitter words and curses uponherself, desiring the Lord to show some present token from Heaven on her,that all the world might know that she was such a kind of woman as theysuspected her for, if she used any such thing, or rewarded them any suchway, or had any spirits, or knew what they were.Presently after, Master Throckmorton and Master Henry Pickering,uncle to the said children, who was then with him, heard her use suchprotestations. Being half terrified in their hearts, because they always vehe-mently suspected her guiltiness, that she would thus violently with her ownhands, as it were, pull down the judgements of God on her head, they wentout of the doors. And before they were gone ten paces from the house,another young gentleman, Master John Lawrence, cousin to the said chil-dren, that stayed behind in the parlour, came to Master Throckmorton andMaster Henry Pickering and said that Mother Samuel’s chin did bleed.Whereupon they returned into the parlour again where she was. And theysaw the napkin, with which she had wiped away the blood from her chin, to bebloody to the quantity of eight or ten drops. Then Master Throckmorton,with the rest, looked on her chin. And there was no more to be seen than onthe back of a clean hand. Only there did appear some few little red spots, asif they had been flea-bites. Then Master Throckmorton demanded of herwhether her chin used to bleed so or not. She said that it did very often.He asked her who could witness it but herself. She said, ‘Nobody,’ for itdid always bleed when she was alone, and she never told anybody of it.After she was condemned, she did confess to the said Master HenryPickering this, her bleeding at the chin, to be the spirits then sucking at herchin, when she made that protestation to M. Throckmorton and him. Andshe said that when she wiped them off with her hand, her chin bled, whichsometimes it had done before, after their sucking, but not often and neverso much as then, nay, scarcely the quantity of one drop at any time before."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children103And this by the way, as a general note throughout the book, where there isone of these strange things set down, if they be so accounted as strange, thereare ten omitted, which may as well be put in and, in the judgement of themthat hear of them, are no less strange than these. And for that which this bookdoes contain, it is set down suddenly and as it comes to present memory,at the request of divers Right Worshipful, and especially for the motion’ssake of the Right Worshipful, Master Justice Fenner, one of the Patronshereof. And for the truth of the most of these things herein contained, theywere given in evidence, and ready to be given against the parties accused,if either need should have required or time served, on the oath of diversgentlemen on the Assizes day at Huntington, before the said parties. Andfor the rest which were not then alleged, if any will make doubt thereof,there are divers gentlemen of honest report ready to confirm the same ontheir oaths if need should so require, that were present, some at one time,and some at another, at all these several tragedies as they may be termed.At another time soon after, the spirits told the children, then beingin their fits, the old woman also standing by them, that if their FatherMaster Throckmorton would then presently go to John Samuel’s house,his daughter Agnes Samuel who then dwelt at home with her Father and wasnot yet brought into question about any of these matters would hide herself,and not be seen by him.41Master Throckmorton, hearing them, said that hewould go presently and make a test thereof. It is not known whether AgnesSamuel perceived Master Throckmorton or any of his company or whateverelse when he came to the house. But she went up into the chamber, therebeing but one in the house, the stairs of which stood in the same parlourbelow where her Father was, and the door of which was a trap door. Onthis, she set sacks of corn and tubs with some such like things to keep itdown. Master Throckmorton, hearing a noise in the house, thought therewas some such matter in hand and continued still knocking at the door.Presently, John Samuel asked who was there, and what he wanted, withsome such like questions. And in the end, knowing whom he was, said thathe could not come in. Then Master Throckmorton went to the other side41The children now begin to involve Alice’s daughter Agnes in their accusations."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104Demonic Possession and Exorcismof the house and, finding the back door open, went in. And when he cameinto the parlour where the man was in his bed, being about eight o’clock orsomething before, he asked for Agnes Samuel, his daughter, and where shewas. John Samuel was not asked to swear an oath. But presently, he sworethat as God judge his soul, which was his common oath and used also diverstimes before the Bench at his arraignment, yea, and until the very time ofhis execution, he did not know where she was.Master Throckmorton asked when he last saw her. He answered thatsince nightfall she had been in the house. But where she now was, he did notknow. He asked if she was not in the chamber over them. He swore that hedid not know. This thing he could not indeed but know. For it was a verylow chamber. And she could not stir her foot in it, but he must needs hearher, besides her going up into it. For the stairs stood close by the foot ofhis bed. And there was also the noise that she made in the hearing of MasterThrockmorton and the rest coming into the house. Master Throckmorton,verily suspecting that she was there, called to her three or four times. Andhe willed her to answer if she were there, for all that he desired to knowwas where she was. But she would not answer. Then Master Throckmortontook the candle and said he would go up and see. But when he came tothe top of the stairs, the trap door was so tight that he could not budge it.Realising this, he said that he would surely break open the door or break upthe ceiling of the chamber. For he would go into it before he left the house.And he willed one of the company to fetch him a bar of iron or some suchlike thing, for he would do it indeed.The maid, hearing Master Throckmorton thus resolute, answered thatshe was there. Then Master Throckmorton willed her to come down, whichshe did, removing those things that before she had set on the door. So hedeparted home to his house, challenging the man for his naughty lie, whichyet he stiffly stood in. But, to let a hundred of these things pass with theirfellows, and to come nearer the old woman’s confession and the manner ofit. You will understand that Mother Samuel grew now to be marvellouslyweary of Master Throckmorton’s house, both because she could do nothingin the house, but the children in their fits would reveal it, and especiallybecause the children in their fits likewise had told her twenty times to her"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children105face that she should confess this matter before the Tuesday after Twelfthday42,and that the spirits had told them that they would force her to confessit despite her, and she had often experience, that whatever the spirits foretoldproved most true.Now this Tuesday which the children so often named, was not thenthought, of any that heard it, to be the Sessions day at Huntington, as itis generally in most places of England, no, not within a week or more afterthe children had spoken of it. Yet they often whispered among themselves,always in their fits as you must understand, about that Tuesday, wishingoftentimes, that it were once come. For that was likely some happy day forthem, they would say. For after that day, the spirits had told them, theywould never have more fits. So all their joy in their fits was for that day.Yet they would say to themselves that the spirits tell them, that happily itmay be before that Tuesday. But on the Tuesday at the farthest, she mustconfess it, and they must be well. But if she would confess it before, theyshould be well presently whenever she did confess it.For this cause, the children in their fits continually would exhort herto confess it, that they might be well. Yet she always would refuse to doit, saying that she would not confess that which she never did know of,nor consented to. The children would answer that they would not wish herto accuse herself for anything, and therefore willed her to look to that inany respect. Yet they said that they enforced no more on her than what thespirits had told them. Yet to speak the truth of these children and no more, ifanything herein written of them be strange, this for strangeness goes beyondall other, and for truth equal to the rest. Such were the heavenly and divinespeeches of these children in their fits to this old woman, some at one time,some at another, concerning her confession of this fact, that if a man hadheard it, he would not have thought himself better edified at ten sermons.The matter of their speech concerned chiefly the joys of Heaven whichshe would lose, and the torments of Hell which she would endure if she,being guilty, would not yet confess, and the eschewing of the one andenjoying of the other, if she would confess and be sorry for what she haddone. They rehearsed likewise to her her naughty manner of living, her usual42The Tuesday after6January."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"106Demonic Possession and Exorcismcursing and banning of all that displeased her, and especially of their parents,and of them, which she could not deny, her negligent going to Church andslackness in God’s service. All of which she confessed to them. But shewould now begin to amend, she said. Her lewd bringing up of her daughter,in allowing her to be her dame, both in controlling of and beating of her,which before had been proved to her face and she herself had also confessed.They reminded her also of that which they had heard some speak of whenthey were out of their fits, namely, that she had said that their fits were butwantonness in them. They asked her now, whether she was still of that mindor not. She answered, ‘No,’ with many such like speeches. And in the endthey concluded with their hearty prayer to God for her, saying that theywould forgive her from the bottom of their heart, if she would confess itthat they might be well. Besides, they would entreat their parents and theirfriends, as much as in them lay, clearly to forgive and forget all that waspast. Their manner of behaviour in this their exhortation to her was that, asfor the most part they began with tears, so they continued. And they alwaysended with tears, inasmuch as there was not any that heard them that couldabstain from weeping. Only the old woman was little or nothing moved.This kind of behaviour in the children went on until nearer Christmas,yet without the old woman being at all touched or stirred. In the meantime,every day almost, this old woman had a fit of bleeding at the nose. And shebled very much at a time, which is not usual in old age, so that she now waxedfaint and looked very pale, insomuch that Master Throckmorton and hiswife were very careful for her, fearing some harm would come to her in hishouse. And they comforted her by all the means they could, not allowingher to lack anything that she desired, if possibly they could come by it.So that she did confess to all that came to her, that she was marvellouslywell treated by Master Throckmorton, and thought herself greatly boundto him, as truly she had no other cause.As for her business, she did nothing but her own work, and for her diet,she sat at his own board, or with his children if they were in their fits andcould not sit down. And for her lodging, she lay continually in his ownchamber, and for the most part with one of his children."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children107And to tell you one thing more of her before her confession. One ofthese children, Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton, was one day ill at ease,and could not eat any meat. Yet, when night came and supper was ready,she thought to make herself amends. But when she was ready to sit at thetable, she fell presently into her fit. And yet that was not all the punishmentshe had. But her mouth was locked up, so that she could neither eat, drink,nor speak. It was a usual thing with them all, to have their mouths shutup especially at meal times, and other times shut and open, half a dozentimes in a dinner. So would the spirits sport with them. But she wentso to bed, very sorrowful and weeping. What her grief was, none can tell,because she was not able to utter it. When the next day came, she was assick and ill as the day before, yet out of her fit, and ate very little or nothingat all. When night came, she said she felt herself well amended, and veryhungry, not knowing for her part but that she had eaten her supper the nightbefore.Then was she counseled by them that feared the worst to eat something.But she said that she would not, intending to eat her portion at supper.When the time came and meat was set upon the board, she fell into the samestate as she had been in the night before. Master Throckmorton, perceivingthis, said to the old woman that stood by her, ‘I think, Mother Samuel,you are disposed to torment that wench.’ She answered him, ‘No,’ that shewas rather sorry to see it. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘surely you will neither eat nordrink until she can do both. And therefore,’ said Master Throckmorton,‘whilst she fasts, you will fast, and when she can eat, you will eat, but notbefore, use the matter as you will.’ And thus they both continued fastinguntil supper was almost ended and the company ready to arise, the onefasting on necessity because she could not eat, and the other for MasterThrockmorton’s pleasure because she might not.The old woman perceived that Master Throckmorton was in good earnestwith her and that the meat was carried out of the parlour. Suddenly, Godknows for what reason, the child fetched a great sigh, for she had beenweeping all supper time, and spoke, saying, ‘If I had some meat now, I couldeat it.’"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"108Demonic Possession and ExorcismMistress Throckmorton, the child’s Mother, hearing her speak, as didalso all the rest that were in the parlour, commanded presently that meatshould be given to them both, the company not giving notice to MotherSamuel of the matter. So they both fell to their meat very heartily, butespecially the old woman, who, as it would seem, was then very hungry, asshe had always a good appetite. And from that time onwards, during the oldwoman’s stay in the house, neither that child nor any of her sisters had theirmouths shut up at any time when they would eat their meat. Or if they were,they did not long continue so, although it was a common custom with thembefore to have gone supperless to bed on that very occasion many a time.After all these matters were passed over, and as it waxed every day nearerand nearer to the time appointed, Mother Samuel every day complained ofanew grief to befall her. Sometimes she would cry out about her back, thatit was so full of pain, that she was not able to stir herself in her bed all theday long, nor take any rest at night.Sometimes she would cry out in a similar way about her head, othertimes about her stomach. Yet she would eat her meat saying that she hadagnawing at her heart. And the next day after, it would be in her knee orlower, so that she would go limping up and down the house. And to speakthe truth of her, it would seem that there was something that troubled her,whatever it was, for she would so groan and moan in the night time, onetime complaining of this part of her body, another time of that, that indeedshe rested but little in the night time herself, and greatly disquieted thosealso that lay in the chamber by her.And one night amongst all the rest, she cried out very pitifully about herbelly, inasmuch as she disturbed and awakened both Master Throckmortonand his wife that lay by her. Master Throckmorton said, ‘In God’s name,Mother Samuel, what ails you, and why do you groan so?’ Said she, ‘I havesuddenly a marvellously great pain in my belly, and I know not how it iscaused.’ ‘Why,’ said he, ‘what is the matter in your belly?’ She answeredthat there was something in it, which she thought stirred. And it was asbig as a penny loaf and put her to marvellous pain. Whereupon MistressThrockmorton arose out of her bed, and went and felt on her belly. And"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children109there was indeed a marvellous swelling to the quantity before likened. But,not staying long with her for the weather was so cold, she did not feel itstir. And be it spoken without offence to women, it may be that she bredthen that child with which she said she was, when she was asked what shecould say by my Lord the Judge, why sentence of death should not be givenagainst her, as hereafter you shall hear. But whatever it was, she cried outto Master Throckmorton about her belly, and said that she was full ofpain.43And further, she said that she had often told him that she thoughtthere were some evil spirits that haunted his house, which did thus tormenthis children. This, he told her, he did easily believe was true. ‘And now,’said she, ‘I verily believe, that one of them has got into my belly.’ MasterThrockmorton said that all this might very well be true. So she said that itwas an evil house and haunted with spirits, and she wished that she had nevercome into it. He told her that, if there were any evil spirits that hauntedthe house, they were of her sending, and so he would grant all that shesaid. In the end, she passed that night groaning and moaning. And the nextmorning, she said that she was very ill at ease. But the swelling in her bellywas gone. And she could not tell where her greatest pain was, it was in somany places. But her stomach was the best of any other part. And after this,she continually complained of one part of her body or other, as long as shestayed in the house.Within a very short time after, one of the children44fell into a mostterrible fit, Mother Samuel standing by. And it was so grievous on her forthe time that neither she nor any of her sisters had the like for the spaceof a year or two before. And her sneezing fit especially was so terrible andstrong on her, as if it would have caused her eyes to start out of her head.This fit did greatly frighten Mother Samuel. For she herself did then thinkthat she would see the child die at that moment. And this wrung prayers outof her, so that she desired the Lord then to help the child and to protecther from danger, and she hoped never to see her in the like again. But themore earnest Mother Samuel was in her prayers, the greater was the child’s43There is a hint here that she may have conceived a child by the Devil.44Jane."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110Demonic Possession and Exorcismtrouble and torment. And the more often she named God or Jesus Christ,the stronger the child’s fit was on her. And at that very instant, as hereafteryou shall hear of the rest, when she had thus continued some two hours ormore, the spirit spoke to the child and said that there was a worse fit thanthis to come yet, in which she must be worse handled than this. The childanswered that she cared neither for him nor his dame, but willed them todo the worst they could to her for, she said, she hoped that God woulddeliver her. And soon after, she came out of her fit and was very well. Butthe sight of this fit was so terrible to Mother Samuel that she would manytimes pray that she might never see the like again in any of them.All of the children still continued calling on Mother Samuel to makeconfession of this matter, saying that she must do it before long, and asgood at first as at last. But if she would now do it, so that they might be wellbefore Christmas, they would then think themselves beholden to her. Theytold her further that now Christmas was at hand. And if she would nowconfess it, they would be presently well and keep, by the grace of God, amerry Christmas. She answered that she would do for them all the good shecould, but for the confession of this matter, she would not. For it was a thingshe never knew of, nor consented to. Their Father, Master Throckmorton,hearing his children and the old woman thus talk together, stepped in andsaid, ‘Mother Samuel, you hear what these children say, which is, that ifyou would confess this fact, they would be presently well. And they say thatyou must confess it before long. And you know that they are not used totelling lies in their fits. Now therefore, in the name of God, if there be anysuch matter, confess it. It is never too late to repent and to ask for mercy.’But she made the same answer to him that she had done to the childrenbefore. Then he said, ‘But what do you say to that grievous fit which theSpirit of late threatened to my daughter Jane? I would like to know whenthat should be.’ ‘Oh,’ says she, remembering the terror of it, I trust in GodIshall never see her in such a state again, nor any of them all.’ ‘Yes,’ saysMaster Throckmorton, ‘I verily think that she will have it, you know, andshortly. For the spirit has not to failed them in anything he promises.’ ‘Oh,’says she, ‘I trust in God that she will never have it,’ speaking marvellously"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children111confidently. ‘Why then,’ says Master Throckmorton, ‘charge the spirit, inthe name of God, that she may escape this fit which is threatened.’ Shepresently said, ‘I charge you spirit, in the name of God, that Mistress Janenever have this fit.’ The child sitting by said, ‘The thing speaks truly. Ithank God that I will never have this fit that he has foretold of me.’ MasterThrockmorton says, ‘Why, that is well, thanks be to God. Go on MotherSamuel, and charge the spirit, in the name of God, and speak from yourheart that neither she nor any of them all have their fits any more.’ So she saidas Master Throckmorton willed her, speaking marvellously heartily. Thesame child again said, ‘The thing speaks truly. I thank God that I will neverhave it more after the Tuesday after Twelfth Day.’ Master Throckmortonsays, ‘It is well, thanks be to God. Charge the spirit again, in the name ofGod, and speak from your heart and be not afraid, that he depart from themall now at this moment and that he never return to them again.’ These wordsshe uttered very loudly and very boldly. As soon as she had ended, thenthose three children that were then in their fits and had so remained for thespace of three weeks, wiped their eyes. And at that instant, they thrust backthe stools on which they sat and stood on their legs, being as well as everthey were in their lives. Master Throckmorton now had his face towardsthe children and his back to the old woman. And seeing them stand up sosuddenly, he said, ‘Thanks be to God.’ While he was thus speaking, littleknowing or thinking indeed of any such matter, the old woman fell downbehind him on her knees and said, ‘Good Master, forgive me.’ He turnedaround and, seeing her fallen down, said, ‘Why Mother Samuel, what is thematter?’ ‘O Sir,’ said she, ‘I have been the cause of all this trouble to yourchildren.’ ‘Have you, Mother Samuel,’ said he? ‘And why so?

Mother Samuel asked thosethree children that were there forgiveness, and afterwards the rest, kissingall of them. The children easily forgave her, for they knew not that she hadoffended any of them, in their own persons, except what they saw in theirsisters, when they themselves were out of their fits.

Yet she would not be comforted by anything that they could say. ThenMaster Throckmorton sent for Master Doctor Dorington, the Ministerof the town, and told him all the matter with the circumstances. He desiredhim to comfort her, which they all, joining together, did as well as theycould at that moment. Yet could she not forbear weeping, and so continuedall the night. The next day, which was the Sabbath day, and ChristmasEve, Master Doctor Dorington chose his text of repentance out of thePsalms on set purpose to comfort her. And he declared there in the openassembly all the matter of Mother Samuel’s late confession, applying hisspeech directly to the comforting of a penitent heart, and so by consequenceto her. All this sermon time, Mother Samuel did nothing but weep andlament. And many times she was so very loud with sundry passions thatshe caused all the church to look on her. And thus much farther you willknow on this point. Master Throckmorton, the same day after prayers wereended, very wisely remembering himself and the old woman’s inconstancyheretofore, recalled to mind that there was none present at her confessionbut himself and Master Doctor, with his own household, who might allbe thought partial in this matter. He therefore willed Mother Samuel tocome into the body of the Church. And there he demanded of her, beforehis neighbours, whether that confession which she had made to him and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children113Master Doctor overnight was wrested and wrung out of her, or whetherit proceeded frankly and freely of and from herself. She answered beforethem all that it came of herself, and she desired all her neighbours to pray toGod for her, and to forgive her. Towards night, Master Doctor Dorington,understanding the old woman still to continue in this heavy state, cameto Master Throckmorton’s house, who is his brother-in-law by marriage,and entreated him, simply out of good will, tendering to the old woman’scomfort, to give her leave to go home to her husband. And he would be ago-between so that her husband would receive her, and to reconcile themtogether, in which the old woman was marvellously obliged. At first, MasterThrockmorton did easily grant this request, being as willing to comfort theold woman as any, and acted also as a go-between so that her husband mightreceive her, little suspecting that anything should fall out thereby otherwisethan well. The man,45when he heard of it, spoke bluntly, as his manner was,saying that she might come home if she wished.Now that you have heard this old woman’s confession, it may perchanceseem strange in some points to some. But for the truth of it, it is as certainlytrue as is any part of this book, both the matter and the manner, and thewords also observed in all points, as near as possibly could be remembered.Mother Samuel is now on Christmas Eve at night gone home to her husbandand her daughter, where we doubt she has a cold welcome for her reception,and the rather because she has confessed this matter. For it would seem thatthey both set on her, as she herself after confessed, and so far forth prevailedwith her that the next morning, which was Christmas day, she denied allthat she had said before, and it was no such matter with her. Before night, itcame to Master Throckmorton’s hearing that this new convert had revoltedagain, and had denied all that she had spoken to him. The best comfort hehad in this was the open confession she made in the church, and thereupondid hardly believe that which was reported of her.The same day, in the evening, Master Doctor Dorington and MasterThrockmorton went to her house to know the truth. And when they cameto the door, it pleased God that John Samuel, his wife, and his daughterwere talking of this matter. For it would seem that it was all their talk. They,45John Samuel."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"114Demonic Possession and Exorcismrealising this, halted a while. And they heard the daughter say these words,‘Believe them not, believe them not, for all their fair speeches.’ Hereuponthey both went presently into the house and charged the daughter with thesewords, which she utterly denied, as did also the Father and the Mother.Then did Master Throckmorton question her concerning the matter whichbefore she had confessed in his house and in the Church, telling her that hehad heard that she had denied it again. She answered that she would denythat she was a witch, or any cause of the troubling of his children. ‘Why,’said he, ‘did not you confess as much to me?’ ‘I said so indeed,’ says she,‘but it is not so.’ ‘Why then,’ said he, ‘I must not show you that favour whichIpromised. I will surely have you before the Justices. But,’ he said, ‘whydid you confess it to be so to me, if it be not so?’ She answered, ‘For joy.’‘For joy,’ said he smiling to himself, marvelling what she could make ofit, ‘and why for joy?’ ‘Because,’ said she, ‘I saw your children so instantlywell, after your good prayers and mine.’ Then said Master Throckmortonto her, ‘I pray God so continue them. Notwithstanding howsoever it be, Iwill not let pass this matter thus. For seeing it is published, either you or Iwill bear the shame of it in the end.’ And so they departed for that night.Early the next morning, Master Throckmorton went to Master DoctorDorington’s house. And he told him that he would not allow this matterthus to die in his hand, lest the worse sort of the people should imaginethat this was but some device of theirs to bring the old woman into furtherdanger. So they agreed to test her once again in this matter. And sending forher to the Church, they found her farther off from confessing anything thatshe had said or done than ever she was before. Then Master Throckmortontook her by the hand, and said that both she and her daughter would thatday, by God’s grace, go with him to my Lord, the Bishop of Lincoln. Sohe presently sent for the constables. And he charged them with the Motherand daughter, and requested them to provide for the journey.When the old woman perceived preparation for the journey, the consta-bles ready, and Master Throckmorton also putting on his boots, she cameto him and said, ‘Master, if you will go with me into the parlour, I will con-fess all to you alone.’ He said, ‘I will go.’ So they went together. And there"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children115she confessed the whole matter again to him, which she had done before.‘Why then,’ said he, ‘tell me why have you denied it all this time?’ ‘Oh,’said she, ‘I would never have denied it but for my husband and daughter,who said that I was a fool in confessing to it. And they said that it had beenbetter for me to have died in the same state I was in than to confess myselfawitch. For now everybody will call me old witch while I live.’ MasterThrockmorton told her that if she would persist in confessing the truth, hewould show her all the favour he could. In the meanwhile, Master DoctorDorington comes in to them, and he fell into questioning her. But sheseemed somewhat reluctant to confess that to him which before she haddone. So he drew her aside, and Master Throckmorton left them. Then didMaster Doctor Dorington call for pen, ink and paper, and wrote down thatconfession which she made.In the meantime, Master Throckmorton sent to the Church whichadjoins his house. And divers of his neighbours were there, for it wasabout prayers time. He desired them to come with him. And telling themthe matter, he placed them close underneath the parlour window, whereMaster Doctor and this old woman were talking together. When noticewas given to Master Doctor, he spoke very loudly. And he willed the oldwoman to lift up her voice also, faining something, so that the neighbourswhich were outside might easily hear all the words that passed betweenthem. When they had done, Master Throckmorton went into them in theparlour, and desired them to come forth into the hall. When they came,there stood all the neighbours that had heard this matter. Then began MasterDoctor to read in their presence that which the woman had confessed. Butshe would fain have denied all again. ‘No,’ said the neighbours to her, ‘it istoo late to deny anything now for we heard all this with our ears.’ They toldher the place where they were. When she perceived herself thus caught in atrap, she would have made the best of it. But it would not prevail. As theywere thus in the house together, John Samuel, the old woman’s husbandwho had understood that there was something ado in the house concerninghis wife, came in. When he was come, Master Throckmorton told him thatwhich his wife had again confessed, and, with the rest, that his wife would"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"116Demonic Possession and Exorcismnever have denied that which she did but for him and his daughter. ‘Haveyou said so?’ said he to his wife, calling her a foul name. And with that hewould have struck her, had not others stood between them. The old woman,seeing her husband thus fiercely coming towards her, fell down presently inacounterfeit swoon before them all. Mistress Throckmorton, standing by,was suddenly marvellously alarmed at this, and called foraqua vitae46forher. When they took her up, they saw that her countenance was unalteredand that she looked cheerful enough. One of her neighbours standing by,better acquainted, as it happened, with her ways than the rest, said that ifthey would let her alone, he would be their warrant that she would do wellenough. So, soon after, she came to herself again and all was well. Thesecircumstances about her confession are therefore the more expressly setdown, although they be not so pertinent to the matter. Nor indeed wouldthey have been declared at all, had it not been reported by some in thecountry, and those that thought themselves wise, that this Mother Samuelnow in question was an old simple woman, and that one might make her byfair words confess what they would. But to leave that to the judgement ofthem that knew her well enough, Master Throckmorton continued on hisjourney, intending to discharge himself on the matter. And he caused theold woman with her daughter to be carried the same day to my Lord, theBishop of Lincoln, and there he examined her and her daughter.The Examination of Alice Samuel of Warboys, in the County of Hunt-ington, taken at Buckden before the Right Reverend Father in God, William,by God’s permission Bishop of Lincoln, the twenty sixth of December,1592.Being asked whether a dun chicken did ever suck on her chin, and howoften, the said examinant says that it sucked twice and no more sinceChristmas Eve last. Being asked whether it was a natural chicken, she saysthat it was not. She knows that it was not a natural chicken because, when itcame to her chin, she scarcely felt it. But when she wiped it off with her hand,her chin bled. She says further that the said dun chicken first came to herand sucked on her chin before it came to Master Throckmorton’s house,46Spirits such as brandy or whisky."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children117and that the ill and the trouble that has come to Master Throckmorton’schildren has come by means of the said dun chicken. The chicken, sheknows, is now both gone from them and from her. And further, she says thatMaster Throckmorton and Master Doctor Dorington will bring furtherinformation of such things as she has not yet declared.The Examination of Alice Samuel of Warboys in the County of Hunt-ington, taken at Buckden the twenty ninth day of December 1592, beforethe Reverend Father in God, William, by God’s permission Bishop ofLincoln, Francis Crummel, and Richard Tryce, Esquires, Justices of herMajesty’s peace within the aforesaid County.She says that she never did hurt to any, except to the children in question.Being asked how she knows that the said dun chicken is gone from the saidchildren, she says that it is because the said dun chicken, with the rest,47arenow come into her. And they are now in the bottom of her belly, and makeher so full that she is likely to burst. And this morning they caused her tobe so full, that she could scarcely lace her coat. And she said that on theway, as she came, they weighed so heavy that the horse she rode on fell downand was not able to carry her. And further, she says that the upright man,of whom she has confessed to Master Throckmorton, told her that MasterThrockmorton was a hard man and would trouble her much. For this reason,he said that he would give her six spirits that would vex and torment hischildren, and so he did. The spirits had a reward from her by sucking herblood oftentimes when they were outside her body. And she says that thesaid spirits did suck her blood before she sent them forth anywhere. Shesays further that, whatever the children of Master Throckmorton spoke intheir fits proved true and was true. For example, whenever the said childrensaid that they saw the said spirits then the spirits were there, and she didalso see them. And she says that oftentimes she did give a private beckor nod with her finger or head. And then the spirits presently stopped thechildren’s mouths, so that they could not speak until they came out again.And then the children would wipe their eyes and be well again. Further, shesays that it was taught her by a man that came to her house. But where he47Ofthe spirits."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"118Demonic Possession and Exorcismdwelt or what his name was, she cannot tell. He told her that if she wouldcall the said six spirits they would come. And she called them, and theyappeared in the likeness of dun chickens. Their names were as follows: first,Pluck; second, Catch; the third, White; and the other three she called withher mouth with three smacks. And two of them, she, this examinant, sent toMaster Robert Throckmorton of Warboys and his wife. And they returnedagain, and told her that God would not allow them to prevail. Whereuponshe, this examinant, sent the said spirits to the children of the said MasterThrockmorton, by means of which they have been so strangely tormented,as has been seen by the neighbours and country. She says further that whatthe children spoke in their fits in her hearing was true, and so it happened.Being asked further what the upright man’s name was that gave her the devils,she said that she could not tell. At this, she was persuaded to go into anotherchamber and demand of her spirits what his name was. Presently she didthis. And there with a loud voice, she said these words as follows, ‘Oh youDevil. I charge you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,that you tell me the name of the upright man who gave me the devils.’ Shedid this three times. And then she returned, saying that her spirits had toldher that his name was Langland. And being asked where the said Langlanddwelt, she said that she could not tell. Then was she persuaded to go intothe said chamber again, and demand of her spirits where the said Langlanddwelt, which also she presently did. And there with a loud voice, she saidthree times, ‘Oh Devil, I charge you in the name of the Father, the Son, andthe Holy Ghost, tell me where the said Langland dwells.’ Then she returnedand said that he had no dwelling. Then was she further persuaded to go againand demand where the said Langland was at that moment. This also she did.And she demanded as before. And she returned with the answer that herspirits told her that he went on the last voyage beyond the seas.After these confessions were thus made, Mother Samuel and her daugh-ter were committed to the gaol of Huntington. Now that we have broughtMother Samuel to the gaol, we will let her rest there in God’s peace andthe Queen’s until the next general Assizes day held at Huntington. Andmany things fell out unhappily concerning her, during her continuance inthe gaol, of which she was greatly suspected, such as the death of one of"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children119the gaoler’s servants whom she threatened, the extreme sickness of one ofhis children with his present recovery after the scratching of her, and diversother things which are shrewd pieces of evidence against her, if there hadbeen nothing else laid to her charge. Yet because they do not concern thetrouble of these children, neither is the matter so perfectly known to theauthors of this book, it is therefore but mentioned in passing.And to come to the daughter Agnes Samuel, who now comes on thestage with her part in this tragedy. You will understand that she was leftwith her Mother in the gaol until the Session’s day held at Huntington theninth of January following. This day was the Tuesday that the children hadso often spoken of to the old woman.48At dinnertime, Master Throckmorton made his request to the HighSheriff and the Justices to bail this maid, and to have her home to his house,to see, if it might please God, whether any such evidences of guiltinesswould appear against her, as had before appeared in the children againstthe Mother. This suit was not easily granted. For it was a demur amongstthe Justices whether the maid was bailable by the law in this case or not. In theend, Master Throckmorton continuing his suit, they were resolved of thedoubt and granted it. But it was almost three o’clock in the afternoon, aseverybody can witness that was then present. The time is here mentionedbecause it has relation to the next point that hereafter follows, as you willhear.The report of Master Doctor Dorington of that which happened atWarboys, on Tuesday which was the Sessions day at Huntington, the ninthof January.About twelve o’clock, a little before dinner, Mary, Joan, and Grace, thedaughters of Robert Throckmorton of Warboys aforesaid, Esquire, fellinto their accustomed fits of lameness, blindness, deafness, and lack offeeling. Only their youngest brother Robert, of the age of nine years, mightspeak to Jane with her understanding, and she only might speak in the likemanner to Mary and Grace...4948The Tuesday after Twelfth day.49Iomit here a brief section in which these children forecast the coming of Agnes, and the nature oftheir fits on her arrival (sigs.h.3.r–h.3.v)."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"120Demonic Possession and ExorcismAfter Agnes Samuel was brought to Master Throckmorton’s house, thechildren continued for three or four days without any fits at all, so thattheir parents were put in great comfort that their children would then havebeen clean delivered from their torments. But it would seem that the matterwas not yet brought to an end, for the children fell all of them afresh intotheir fits again, and were as grievously afflicted as ever they were in theold woman’s time. And then the Spirits did begin as plainly to accuse thedaughter as ever did the Mother, and to tell the children that the old womanhad sent over her spirits to her daughter. And the spirits said that she hasbewitched them all over again, and that she will deal worse with them thanever her Mother did...50The next day, which was Saturday the tenth of February, for it wouldbe too long to speak of every particular hour although almost every hourbrought variety with it, as she51lay by the fire side groaning in her fit inthe afternoon, she suddenly began bleeding at the nose. And she bled verymuch. At this she marvelled, for she perceived it, saying, ‘I pray God send megood news after this. For it is strange with me to bleed. I did not bleed thismuch even years before.’ When she had much bloodied her handkerchief,she said that it was a good deed to throw the handkerchief into the fire andburn the witch for she knew, she said, that this bleeding came of no goodcause. After she had talked thus to herself a little, it would seem that thespirit came to her. For she said, thus smiling to herself and casting her eyesabout her, ‘What is this, in God’s name, that comes thus tumbling to me?It tumbles like a football. I think it be some puppet-player. It is much likehis dame’s old thumbed cap. What is your name I pray you,’ said she? Thething answered, so it would seem, that his name was Blue. For presently, onthe question demanded of his name, she made answer again herself saying,‘Master Blue, you are welcome. I never saw you before. I thought,’ said she,‘that my nose did not bleed for nothing. What news have you brought?’ Ittold her as before. ‘What do you say,’ says she, ‘that I shall be worse handled50Iomit here a brief section which sets the stage for the progressive incrimination of Alice’s daughterAgnes by the children (sigs.h.3.v–h.4.r).

Ha,’ says she, ‘what do you say.’ For she would ever repeatthe spirit’s words after him, as they all would do when they were talkingwith them, bending their heads to the ground. ‘Do you say that I will nowhave my fits, when I will both hear, see, and know everybody? That is a newtrick indeed. I do not think any of my sisters were ever so used. But I carenot for you,’ said she, ‘do your worst. And when you have done, you willmake an end.’ These were her very words...52At night presently, on her Father’s and Mother’s rising from supper, shefell into the fit which before Master Blue had threatened. For she was mostgrievously wrung and twitched in every part of her body. Sometimes shewould thrust forth her arms so straight and so stiff that it was not possibleto bend them. Sometimes again, she would so wrest and writhe them cleanbackwards that no man or woman was able to do the like by their naturalstrength. She herself cried out very pitifully, sometimes about her stomach,saying that she was very sick, and wanted to vomit. Sometimes she criedout about her head, and at some other times about her belly. And therewas never a part or member of her free from extreme pain, she herself evercalling on God to think on her, and deliver her. Sometimes it would sostop her breath, and hold it so long, that when she could recover it again,she fetched a marvellously deep and loud groan. And being oftentimes inthis fit and asked by divers that stood by how she did, she answered that shewas marvellously sick and full of pain, affirming that she both heard andsaw all that were present. In this woeful state, she continued the space ofhalf an hour and more, to the great grief of the beholders, for this was oneof the first fits that either she or her sisters had, having their perfect senses.Now suddenly, as she was thus complaining, she fell into her senseless fit,having her mouth also shut up. And now she is deprived of all manner ofsense again. Remaining thus quietly a little space, she fetched a great groan,whereupon her mouth was opened. And she spoke saying, ‘Here is a ruleindeed. I perceive that you are as good as your word with me. From whencedo you now come, and what news do you now bring, I pray you?’ The thinganswered that she must yet be worse handled than all this comes to.

For you will not be ableto hurt me. But tell me, why do you punish me worse than all my sisters,having my fits when I can know everybody?’ The thing answered, because shetold tales of their dame. ‘Who is your dame,’ she says? He answered, ‘NanSamuel.’53And this you must understand. In all their manner of talkingtogether, that the children would first repeat the first spirit’s answer, beforethey would ask any further question of them. Then she said, ‘If Nan Samuelbe your dame, I will tell more tales of her yet. And I hope to tell such a taleof her one day, that she will not be able to answer it, nor you for her.’ Thething answered that he would then punish her the more for it. She said thatshe cared not for that. Then said the thing, ‘When was Smack with you?’This Smack was another of the spirit’s names. She says, ‘I know no suchfellow as Smack.’ ‘Yes,’ says the thing, ‘that you do. And he it is that tellsyou all these things. But I will beat him for it.’ Says she, ‘Do your worst tohim or to me, for I care not for you. Farewell.’ The thing says, ‘Do you bidme farewell?’ Says she, ‘Fare you well and be hanged.’ For you will have thetruth as she spoke it. ‘And come again,’ says she, ‘when you are sent for.’Soon after this, she came forth from her fit. And she was very sick and fullof pain in her legs. The next day, which was the Sabbath, she was reasonablywell all the morning, as she was all other days. But her greatest pangs andfits were always towards night. And thus leaving her until night, you willhear what happened the same day, amongst other of her sisters.Soon after dinner was ended, there came to the house one MasterThrockmorton of Brampton to see how these children did. And stayingin the parlour a little while, one of these children, Mistress Elizabeth byname, as she was coming in at the parlour door, fell suddenly into her fitin the sight of them all. This was not strange to any but to the gentleman,because it was a usual thing with her. Continuing thus a little space, MasterThrockmorton, the child’s Father, said to the other Master Throckmortonhis kinsman, ‘Will you see cousin,’ he says, ‘a wonder?’ Says the gentleman,‘Have you any greater wonders than to see this sight?’ The child’s Fathersays, ‘I have as great. For you will see this child brought out of this state in53That is, Agnes."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children123which you now see her, at the pronouncing of certain words by a maid in thishouse.’ Says the gentleman, ‘I would like to see that, for I am sorry to seethis sight.’ So the child’s Father called for Agnes Samuel, and willed her tosay to the child these words, ‘I charge you Devil in the name of the God ofHeaven and earth, as I hate you and am no witch, nor guilty of this matter,that you depart from this child, and allow her to come out of her fit.’ Thissaid by the maid, the child moved not. Then the child’s Father willed herto say thus, ‘I charge you, you Devil, as I love you and have authority overyou and am a witch, and guilty of this matter, that you allow this child tobe well at this moment.’ These words were no sooner ended, but the childwiped her eyes, and was as well as any in the parlour. As the gentleman wasthus wondering and talking with this maid about the matter, saying that shecould tell a pretty tale for herself, another of those children, Mistress Jane,standing by, fell presently into her fit, and the same experience was had byher, as was had by her sister before. And this was very usual amongst them,for it had been proved divers times. And it was foretold by the spirit to oneof them being in her fit a fortnight before this time, that whenever AgnesSamuel should say these words, they would be presently well...54On Monday next following, which was the twentieth of February, she55began after supper to talk again, having been in her fit an hour or morebefore. For she had eaten her supper in her fit with two other of her sistersthat were also in their fits. Suddenly she said, ‘What, are you come now? Ihad thought you would have come no more, and that we would have beenwell rid of you. But where have you been,’ she said? He answered that hiscousin Smack and he had been fighting with Pluck and Catch, and they hadbeaten them both very much, so that they dare not come to her any more.So they had very much talk about fighting and such other matters, whichbefore are set down. In the end, she asked when she would scratch AgnesSamuel. The spirit answered that if she would now scratch her, then herface would be whole before the Assizes, which must not be. So she willedhim to look to that which he promised, for she would keep her nails for54After this interlude with the kinsman of the Throckmortons, the story returns to Joan and herSpirits.

Even like enough, I thought so,’ says she.‘Yes,’ says the spirit, ‘and to prove this to be true, whenever any stranger willcome into the house, you will fall into your fit. And if then Agnes Samuelwill come to you and say, “As I am a witch, and consenting to the deathof Lady Cromwell, so I charge you to depart and to let her come forth ofher fit,” you will presently be well.’ So Mistress Joan repeated after thespirit the same words which were then set down in writing. ‘If it be so,’ saysMistress Joan, ‘why then I hope she will be hanged at the Assizes as wellas her Mother, and that Sir Henry Cromwell will look to that matter.’ Indrawing the talk to a close, the spirit told her that she would have her fitson the Assizes day, and all the kinds of fits which she has ever had before.But after the day she would have no more fits. But if she had, then woe beto Agnes Samuel. ‘For then,’ says the spirit, ‘I will make her pay for it’ . . .56On Thursday following, which was the first of March, Mistress Mary,who had been well and without any fits ever since the Sessions day lastat Huntington, was somewhat ill at ease all the morning. And about nineo’clock, she fell into a marvellously great quaking and trembling, and couldnot hold a joint of her, yet knew no cause why. Soon after, she was takenand fell into a marvellously troublesome fit, continuing therein about halfan hour. In the end, she waxed a little better, and she said, ‘Is it true? Doyou say that this is the day wherein I must scratch the young witch? I amheartily glad of it. For I will surely pay her to the full, both for myselfand my sisters.’ Master Edward Pickering and Master Henry Pickering,two of the child’s uncles standing by with divers others, caused the maidto be brought up into the chamber where the child was to see what wouldbe the outcome of it. They knew very well that the maid was able to keepherself from being scratched, if three such as the child was were to be seton her at once. As soon as the maid came into the chamber where the childwas, the child said, ‘Are you come, you young witch, who has done all this56Iomit here further testing of Agnes by Joan and her spirits (sigs.i.4.v–k.2.r).

So one inthe company willed the maid to take up the child and carry her down, forher legs were taken from her.Mistress Mary allowed herself very quietly to be taken up in her arms,and clasped her hands about her neck. But even as the maid began to lift herup, she fell to scratching of her so eagerly and so fiercely that it was a wonderto all that saw it, saying, ‘I will scratch you, you young witch, and pay you infull for this punishing of me and my sisters. The thing tells me, that I wouldhave been well, and never had had my fits any more but for you.’ The maidstood still holding down her head, for the child knelt on her knees, andcried very pitifully, yet either would not or could not once pluck away herhead. ‘No,’ said the child, ‘I know you cry, but the spirit said that I wouldnot hear you, because I should not pity you. And he it is that holds younow so that you cannot get away from me.’ So the child scratched her faceuntil the skin came off the breadth of a shilling. But there came no blood atall but water. In the end, the maid brought her down into the parlour wherethe child, sitting a while on her stool, seemed to be wonderfully sorry forwhat she had done. And she said, ‘I would not have scratched Nan Samuel,but the thing told me that I should do it. And it forced me thereunto,stretching forth my arms, and straining my fingers whether I would or not,and made me scratch her.’ And truly, they that saw the manner of it and knewthe mild disposition of the child, might easily see that she was overruledin the action, for she was carried with such vehemency and cruelty for thetime against the maid that it appeared to be altogether besides her nature.The child continued in her fit till an hour after dinner. And then, beingasked of these matters, was altogether ignorant of any such thing and wouldnot believe it. But when she saw the example on the maid’s face and, beingtold that she had done it, she broke into tears and was marvellously sorryto see it.The next day, being Friday, Mistress Mary was in a very mild and solemnfit all the morning. And a little before dinner she said to herself and hersisters that were also in their fits, ‘I am glad and marvellously glad.’ But she"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"126Demonic Possession and Exorcismwould not tell the reason why. Presently, she said to the thing that stood byher, ‘But I know that you will lie to me as you have oftentimes done.’ ‘No,’said the thing, ‘I used not to lie.’ ‘No ado,’ said she, ‘who are you, I prayyou?’ The thing answered, ‘Smack.’ ‘What,’ said she, ‘are you that Smackthat used to come to my sister Joan and tell her so many things?’ ‘Yes,’ hesaid, saying further that he never told her sister Joan any lie hitherto, neitherwas this a lie that he told her. Then Mistress Mary declared to her sisters,all being in their fits, what Smack had told her. This was that, after dinner,she would come out of her fit and never more have any fit, because she hadscratched Agnes Samuel. So her sisters wished that Smack would come tothem, and tell them the same. So after dinner she came forth from her fit,as she said, and never had more fits afterward from that day to this, thanksbetoGod...57Mistress Elizabeth, one of these children and before spoken of, was allthis week troubled with very sudden and extraordinary fits. For she wastwitched and wrung in her body more grievously this week than she wasmany months before. These violent passions in her made us conjecturethat there was some extraordinary matter in hand. For it could not be thatsuch violence should continue long. If it had, it could not but have costher her life. And to pass over many matters of strangeness which befell inthat week, we will come to Saturday which was the tenth of March. Onthis day, as this child sat at supper, it would seem by the manifold signsshe made with her hands and head and by her humming with her voice, thatshe would gladly have spoken to something that stood on the table. But shecould not. Her mouth was shut up. Then she began to lament marvellouslybitterly for a good while. Yet she could not declare her grief. Soon after,she fell into a most troublesome fit which would not allow her to sit onher stool. Then the maid, Agnes Samuel, was willed to hold her, whichshe did. And after a while, she began to grow more quiet. And another ofher sisters younger than she, Grace by name, was more troubled than shewas. So Nan Samuel set down the one, and took up the other. And as she57The story returns to Joan and her dealings with her Spirits (sigs.k.3.r–k.4.r). We pick it up again onsig.k.4.r with Elizabeth on10March."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children127was holding this Mistress Grace in her arms, the other child, MistressElizabeth, that sat close by her, suddenly said to her in a marvellous anger,‘Now I can see the young witch which I could never do before, since shecame to the house in my fit.’ The company that sat at supper thought thatthere was some extraordinary matter in hand, that the child should call theyoung maid witch. For it was never heard by anybody that she ever gaveeither her or her Mother any ill word before, either in her fit or out of herfit. Presently she said to her, ‘My sister Joan’s Devil told me, just now as Isat at supper, that I must scratch the young witch.’ As soon as she had saidso, she slipped from the bench on which she sat. And she fell on her knees,for she was not able to stand. And she caught the maid, that stood closeby her holding the other sister, by the hand. And she scratched one of herhands most fiercely to see, with both of her hands. And she said that it wasshe that had bewitched her and all her sisters, and that she would have beenwell long since but for her. ‘Oh, you young witch, Oh, you young witch,shame on you, shame on you, who ever heard of a young witch before?’ Andthus she cried, with such vehemency of speech and eagerness of scratching,that both her breath and strength failed her. When she had regained herbreath, she fell on her again. And she said that this was her sister Joan’sDevil who used not to lie, that made her scratch her for, said she, ‘I wouldnot have scratched you, and it was completely disagreeable to my will todo it. But the Devil makes me scratch you, stretching forth my arms, andbending my fingers. Otherwise I would not do it. But I must do it, and somust all my sisters scratch you, though they be ever so unwilling to do it,as I myself now am.’ These words she uttered and many more to the likeeffect in that time, in which she scratched her. All this time, the maid stillheld the other child in her arms, never once offering to pluck her hand awayfrom her. But she cried out very pitifully, desiring the Lord to think on her.Then one that stood by demanded of her, and willed her to speak her mindas she thought, whether the child did scratch her of her own will and desireor not. She answered that she thought she did not. ‘No,’ says she, ‘I knowshe did not, and it is no part of her will thus to scratch me.’ The child, whenshe was weary the second time with scratching of her, suddenly put forth"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128Demonic Possession and Exorcismboth her hands and said, ‘Look you here. The Devil says that I must scratchher no more now, for my fingers are thrust forth so straight that I cannotbend them.’ And so it appeared that they were. For she held forth her hand,and her fingers were very straight and stiff. Then she rubbed her hand onthe maid’s hand that bled a little, and wiped the blood on her own hands.And the child did this oftentimes, while she talked with her. Presently, thescratching ended. The child began to weep, insomuch as many tears fellfrom her eyes. And she cried marvellously bitterly, and said to the maid, ‘Iwould not in any way have scratched you. But the Devil made me and forcedme whether I would or not. Oh, that you never had deserved to be thusused.’ And her manner of complaining was as if she had committed somegreat offence. When this weeping fit was somewhat assauged, she began toexhort her, lifting up her voice with such vehemency and desire for heramendment, that we may verily think that the like was never heard to comeforth from a child’s mouth. It is not possible to set down all the wordsof exhortation she spoke to the maid at that time. But these were some ofthem, and the very words as near as could be remembered. ‘Oh, that youhave grace to repent of your wickedness that your soul might be saved. Foryou have forsaken your God, and given yourself to the Devil. Oh, if youknew what a precious thing your soul was, you would never then so lightlyhave parted with it. You have need to pray night and day to get God’s favouragain. Otherwise your soul will be damned in Hellfire for ever. You dooftentimes pray here at home when we pray, and likewise at Church. Butyou pray in vain because you do not pray with your heart. But I will prayfor you with all my heart, and I will forgive you, and desire all my sistersand all my friends to forgive you, if you will confess your fault. But youhave a hard heart,’ said she, ‘and the Devil holds your heart, and will notallow you to confess it. But you must confess it whether you wish to ornot, when your time is come. But oh that you would now confess it so thatyour soul might be saved.’ When she used these words, as she often did,she would repeat them over, three times at the least, with such vehemencethat it was strange to hear. For she would never cease uttering them as longas her breath would serve. Then she told her, ‘My sister Joan’s Devil stands"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children129here before my face.’ And she pointed with her finger to the place. ‘And hetells me that, in spite of you, you shall one day confess it or else you will behanged. For before you do confess it or be hanged, we will not be well. Butif you would even now confess it, we will be presently well. Therefore, defythe Devil now and confess it, so that God may forgive you, and so that yoursoul may be saved. If you would think,’ said she, ‘of the torments of hell, andthat your soul must burn in hellfire, unless you do confess and repent, thenyou would not now stand so stiffly in the denial of it as you do. But you areawicked child, and you have been a witch this four or five years and more.You have done more hurt than to me and my sisters. For you have killed myLady Cromwell and more. The Devil that stands here tells me so. And youwould have killed my sister Joan in this her sick week. But God will not letyou. What a wicked heart you have that nothing will content you but ourdeaths. You and your Father,’ said she, ‘were the cause why your Motherdenied that which she did once confess. She was in a good way,58and wouldnever have gone from her words had not you and your Father been. And ifyour Mother’s soul be damned, you and your Father must answer for it,’with many such like speeches. ‘For your Mother,’ said she, ‘had confessedatruth, and was sorry for her naughtiness. Everybody had forgiven her, andwould have prayed for her. Oh, that she had never gone home, so that hersoul might have been saved. Your Mother is a witch, your Father is a witch,and you are a witch. But of all the three you are the worst. Your Motherwould never have done so much hurt as she has done but for you. And thushas the Devil told me, you wicked child. You are a wicked child. The Lordgive you grace to confess and to repent that your soul may be saved. Oh, thatyour Father were now here. For the Devil now says that I should scratchhim also. He is a witch and a naughty man. Oh, that he were here that hemight hear me now speak to him.’ Then two of the child’s uncles, MasterJohn Pickering, and Master Henry Pickering, being there present, wereentreated by the child’s Father to see if they could, by any means, procureold Samuel to come to the house. But it was thought by the company to be a58Forsalvation."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130Demonic Possession and Exorcismlabour lost before they went, the man was of so churlish a nature, and alwaysso difficult to bring to the house. Notwithstanding, they went. And whenthey had gone twenty paces from the house, they did perceive the same manto be coming along very quickly towards the house. So they agreed to passby him in silence, to see whither he meant to go. The man went directly toMaster Throckmorton’s house. They, perceiving this, followed him backagain, and were as ready to go into the house as he. When they were comeinto the hall, and were even at the door ready to go into the parlour wherethe child and the other company were, the child herself says, ‘He is come,he is come. I will go scratch him.’ So she pressed forwards on her knees, forshe had no use of her legs, towards the parlour door as if she would go tohim. Yet this is most certain, that she was then in such a place of the parlourthat she could not see any part of the hall, and therefore not the man. ThenMaster Doctor Dorington, being present, perceiving the child so to go onher knees, stopped her, and caused the man to be called into the parlour.When he came in, she still pressed to go towards him, and said, ‘I mustscratch him, I must scratch him.’ Suddenly she stopped, saying, ‘I must notscratch him. Look you here.’ And she showed her hands, how her fingerswere shut up close together. ‘If he had been here even now,’ says she, ‘thedevils say I should have scratched him, but now I must not.’ Then MasterThrockmorton, the child’s Father, demanded of the man John Samuel whyhe came to his house. He answered that one in the field told him that hisDaughter was sick and therefore he came. Then Master Throckmorton andMaster Doctor Dorington charged him to tell the truth who it was andnot to lie, as he would answer for it. He answered that he would not tellthem. Notwithstanding they urged him. At last, he said that his brother’sdaughter came to his house and told him that she saw Master DoctorDorington and Master Throckmorton’s man come to this house together.And then he, thinking that it was something to do with his daughter, cametherefore to see the matter. But this was thought by the company not to beasufficient cause to bring him to the house, where before he could not begotten to come without a precept from the Justices. The child continuedstill crying out against him. And she said that he was a naughty man and a"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children131witch, and but for him and his daughter, his wife’s soul might have beensaved, and therefore he must answer it before God one day. And so sherepeated over again many of her speeches to him, which before she had saidto his daughter, exhorting him to prayers and to ask God forgiveness. Theman was so rude in his behaviour, and so loud in his speeches, that thechild could not be heard for him. His answers to the child were, that shelied, and so did all the company, in saying he was a witch. And he said thatshe had been taught her lessons well enough, and that she was above sevenyears old,59though indeed she was not twice seven, with many such likespeeches. And he would not be silent, nor allow the child to speak anythinguntil he was almost forced to it by the child’s Father, although he mightperceive very well, as also did all the company, that the child could not hearhim, nor answer to any of his speeches. Nor yet did she stop her words athis talking in anything she intended to speak to him, although he greatlyinterrupted the same if she could have heard him. But she neither heard himnor any other in the company. Yet she saw him and his daughter, and not anyother. Towards the end, when the child had thus exhorted the Father andthe daughter for the space of an hour and an half, Master Throckmorton,the child’s Father, told the man John Samuel that his daughter Agnes, by acharge which she had, commanded the Spirits to depart from his children,and they had departed. He therefore willed him to use the same words whichhis daughter before had used, to see what would come of it. He said thathe would not, neither would any make him to speak them, and he wouldnot be brought to it for anything. Then did Master Throckmorton tell himthat, seeing he came to his house unsent for, he would not depart until hehad spoken them, as long as the child continued in her fit, if it were a weekbefore she came out of it. Then did Master Doctor Dorington, the ratherto bring him on, speak the words before him. So did also two or three ofhis neighbours, honest men in the town, that were then present and saw allthese matters in the child. But this would not persuade the man, until inthe end he perceived that Master Throckmorton was resolute not to allow59The age of understanding."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132Demonic Possession and Exorcismhim to depart until he had spoken them. Then he began to speak them ashe was taught by Master Throckmorton. The words were these. ‘As I am awitch, and consenting to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge thespirit to depart from Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton at this time, andto allow her to be well.’ The man had no sooner spoken the words, but thechild presently arose, and was very well, marvelling to see such companythere. Then was the child asked if she knew of anything which she had doneor said. And divers particulars were named to her. But she knew of no suchthing, saying that she had been asleep. And she was ready to weep becausethey charged her with such things. So the company departed. And she wentto bed, being very well...60Within two days after, Mistress Grace, the youngest of all those fivesisters sat in the maid’s arms in a very troublesome fit. Suddenly she fellto scratching the maid’s hand, marvellously fiercely to see. But she was notable to speak. Her mouth was shut up. Yet did she groan and weep greatly asif she had been doing something against her will. But such were the child’sshort nails and want of strength that she could not once graze the skin of theback of her hands. Of this child, there are not many things noted because,for the most part, her mouth was shut up during the time of her fits. Yet shehad very many most grievous and troublesome fits. For she has sat in a chairor on a stool by the fire side sometimes a whole day together, groaning andweeping most lamentably to see, and was never clear from her fits since thefirst beginning . . .61The next strangers that came to the house were Master Henry Cromwell,one of Sir Henry Cromwell’s sons and, with him, one of Sir Henry’s men.And this was on the Thursday following being the twenty ninth of March.When they came into the house, Mistress Joan was well. But they had notstayed there a quarter of an hour but she fell into her fit, and was very severely60The story reverts to Joan talking with Smack about scratching Agnes (sigs.l.3.v–l.4.r). A brief accountof Grace is now given concerning her scratching of Agnes on21March.61The story returns again to Joan. On25Marchshe has a long conversation with Smack. All theSamuels are accused of bringing about the death of Lady Cromwell. The spirit foretells that herfits will end on the Assizes Day. He tells Joan that Agnes’s Mother had nine spirits, three namedSmack, Pluck, Blue, Catch, White, Calico, and Hardname. John Samuel is accused of bewitchinghis next-door neighbours, the Chappel’s (sigs.l.4.v–m.3.v). It is now29March, four days beforeJoan’s scratching of Agnes to which she had been looking forward for some time."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children133handled before them, as was also her sister Jane, whenever the maid62namedGod, or Christ Jesus. And in the end, she was brought out of her fit threeseveral times by three several charges as before. Many strangers in thatweek came to the house. And she had these several fits as you will hear onMonday following which was the day appointed for scratching. MistressJoan fell into her fit a little before supper, and so continued all suppertime, not being able to stand on her legs. As soon as thanksgiving aftersupper was beginning to be said, she jumped up on her feet and came to thetable side, and stood with her sisters that were saying grace. And presently,when grace was ended, she fell on the maid Nan Samuel, and took her headunder her arms, and first scratched the right side of her cheek. And whenshe had done that she said, ‘Now I must scratch the left side for my AuntPickering.’63And she scratched that also until blood came out of both sidesvery abundantly. The maid stood stone still, and never once moved to gofrom her. Yet she cried very pitifully, desiring the Lord to be merciful toher. When she had done scratching, Mistress Joan sat herself on a stool, andacted as though she had been out of breath, for she breathed marvellouslyheavily, though the maid never struggled with her, and was never able tohold a part of her. But she trembled like a leaf, and called for a pair of shearsto pare her nails. But when she had them, she was not able to hold them inher hands. So she desired somebody to do it for her. Then Master DoctorDorington’s wife who was her aunt, standing by her, took the shears andpared her nails. But Mistress Joan herself saved the nails as her fingers werepared. And when she had done, she threw them into the fire, and called forsome water to wash her hands. After she had done this, she also threw thewater into the fire. When this was done, this Mistress Joan fell on her knees,and willed the maid to come and kneel down by her, and to pray with her.They said The Lord’s prayer together and likewise the Creed. But it wouldseem that Mistress Joan could not yet hear the maid, for she would speakincorrectly many times. And then the company would help her out. ButMistress Joan did not wait for her, so that she had ended her prayers before62Agnes Samuel.63This is Mistress Pickering, wife of John Pickering of Ellington. Joan had accused Agnes on25Marchof having bewitched her."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"134Demonic Possession and Exorcismthe maid had half done hers. After this, Master Doctor Dorington tookaprayer book, and read certain prayers which he thought good. And whenhe had done, then Mistress Joan fell to exhorting the maid, and gave hermany good exhortations. And as she was thus speaking to her, she fell into amarvellous weeping. And she sobbed so greatly that she could not utter herwords well, saying that she would not have scratched her, but that she wasforced into it by the spirit. As she was thus complaining, Mistress ElizabethThrockmorton, one of her younger sisters, being suddenly taken in her fit,unknown to any in the company, came hastily on the maid and caught her byone of her hands and gladly would have scratched her, saying that the spiritsays that she also must scratch her. But the company willed the maid tokeep her hand from her, which she did. So they strove together for a greatwhile until the child was breathless. Then the child said, ‘Will nobody helpme?’ She repeated the words twice or thrice. Then her sister Mistress Joansaid, being still in her fit, ‘Will I help you sister Elizabeth?’ ‘Aye,’ said she,‘for God’s sake, good sister.’ So Mistress Joan came and took one of themaid’s hands and held it to her sister Elizabeth. And she scratched it untilblood came. And she seemed to be marvellously joyful that she had gottenblood. She pared her nails also and washed her hands and threw all into thefire. After all this, before the company departed, the maid helped MistressJoan out of her fit three several times one after the other, by three severalcharges as you have heard before. And likewise she brought MistressElizabeth Throckmorton out of her fit by saying, as she has bewitchedMistress Elizabeth Throckmorton since her mother confessed.We will now leave Mistress Joan until the Assizes day, and retire a littleback again to Mistress Jane, who is the youngest of Master Throckmorton’schildren save one, and has drunk as deep of this cup of affliction as any ofher sisters has done. And as she first talked of it, so she was the first thatdisliked, and disclosed the author of it, for she it was that first cried outagainst Mother Samuel, and said that it was she that had bewitched her,before either her parents or any other that came towards her suspectedany witchery at all. Since this time, as there has been great cause to think,whereas she was the first that gave occasion to suspect the old woman, and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children135indeed did herself openly accuse her, so she has been therefore amongstall the rest the most extremely dealt withal. For there was never any ofher sisters, Mistress Joan excepted, that did abide such heavy blows, suchdangerous and mortal temptations, as she has done. For she has been oftenand divers times tempted to cast herself into the fire and into the water, andto deprive herself of life by cutting her throat with her own knife. And thesethings have thus appeared in her, namely, that she has many times in her fitssuddenly pulled the knife out of her sheath, and if she had been abroad, shehas thrown it from her as far as she could. If within the house sitting at thetable, or in any other place, she has thrown it under the table or in somecorner of the house, saying that the spirit now tempts her to kill herself.But she will not, desiring the Lord to strengthen her against them. Andwhen she has come out of her fit, she has acknowledged no such matter,marvelling who has taken her knife from her. And as for the danger of fire,this thing has also been proved many times in her. For she has pressedforwards, and strained herself to thrust her head into the fire. And she hasbeen permitted to come so near the fire with her head and face that, restingonly on the strength of one that restrained her, had she been let go, shewould have fallen flat into the fire, to her utter danger of perishing therein.And the same experience in her has as often been made by water, sayingalways that the Devil does tempt her to both. Yet this has been observedcontinually in all these temptations, that she was never tempted to any ofthese dangers, that ever was known, being alone, but always when there weresome company and assistance by to help her. Which thing thus considered,whether it has proceeded of the gracious Providence and goodness of Godit cannot be denied but that it has shown itself most strange and mostwonderful, both in the preservation of her, as also in the rest of her sisters,in these their troublesome extremities. Or whether it has been some secretillusion and mockery of the Devil to deceive the bystanders, it remainsdoubtful and cannot be determined amongst men. But whether one or theother, or whatever, God deserves the glory.On Friday, which was the fifteenth of March 1592, this Mistress Janewas very much troubled with her fit, sitting at the table in dinner time, as she"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"136Demonic Possession and Exorcismhad been for a fortnight or three weeks before that, more extremely used atmeals than at any other time of the day. For always, a little before she wouldsit down either in giving of thanks or presently after, her fit would surelytake her. On this day, as she sat at dinner, it seemed that something thatsat on the table talked to her about Nan Samuel. For she would listen forawhile to it and then look back with a heavy countenance to the maid thatstood behind her, shaking her head as if some sorrow were at hand. Nowthis Mistress Jane had been often told by her other sisters being in theirfits, that the spirit had told them that she would also scratch Nan Samuelbefore the next Assizes, happen when it would. But she would always makethis answer to them, that she would not scratch her, let the Devil do whathe could against her, although the spirit had told her as much as she hadoftentimes said. But she always withstood the spirit in words to his face,saying that she would not do it. On this night, as she sat at supper withthe rest of her sisters, she fell into a very extreme fit, bowing and bendingher body as if she would have broken her back, shaking her hands so thatshe could not hold her knife steady. And many times, it would thrust itagainst her arm. When this fit was ended, then the spirit seemed to talk toher again, as it did at dinner. For she used the same manner of gesture toAgnes Samuel that stood behind her as before, and gave rather great signsof sorrow than otherwise. Suddenly, she arose from the table and wentto the upper end thereof, casting a marvellously heavy and discontentedlook to the maid. By this it was perceived that the child had somethingin her mind that she could not utter, for her mouth was shut up whichshe did greatly dislike. Then the maid was willed to ask her how she did.The child’s mouth was presently opened and she answered her, ‘The worsefor you, you young witch,’ and turning away her face from her, as if sheloathed to look on her. This was news to the maid to be called young witchat her hand. So she continued questioning her, as she was willed. But thechild turned away her face, and covered her ear which was closest to hersaying that she could not abide to hear her or see her. Then the maid waswilled to ask her what the matter was. The child answered that the spiritsays that she must scratch her. ‘When must you scratch me,’ says the maid."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children137Presently, the child’s mouth was shut up so that she could make no answer.Then did the child begin to weep, most lamentably to see. Yet her weepingwas so mixed with anger towards the maid that oftentimes, looking onher, she would suddenly turn away her face from her, with such a yearningvoice, her teeth being set together as if the evil spirit had been whettingand kindling her fury against the maid. Continuing thus a quarter of anhour, the maid was moved to ask again when she should scratch her. Thechild answered by signs, for she could hear her but not speak, holding upher finger at ‘Yes’, and holding it down at ‘No’. So it was easily gatheredthat she would scratch her presently after supper as soon as grace was said.Then the maid asked in what part she would scratch her. She answered bysign that it would be on her right hand, which was the contrary hand tothat which her sister Elizabeth had scratched a week before. Then MasterThrockmorton, the child’s Father, caused Master Doctor Dorington andsome other neighbours in the town to be sent for. When they were comehe declared to them what the child had uttered concerning the maid. Inthis time, before they had come together, there was half an hour spent. Allthis time, the child continued marvellously pensive and heavy, weeping verypitifully, yet often fiercely darting out of the place where she sat towardsthe maid, as if she would have fallen on her before the time. So one of thechildren, being in her fit, gave thanks. As soon as it was ended, the childsank down on her knees, for she could not stand, and fell on the maid withsuch fierceness and rage, as if she would have pulled the flesh of her handfrom the bones. Yet was she scarcely able to scratch the skin, saying tothe maid that the spirit that stands there by her tells her that Pluck holdsher heart and her hand, meaning the maid’s, and will not allow the bloodto come. When the child was weary with scratching, she breathed and saidthat she must have another fit at her. Then Doctor Dorington moved thepeople to pray with him, all which time she kneeled very quietly. But whenprayers were ended, she presently fell to work again on the maid as before,saying these words to her with tears trickling down her cheeks, ‘I would notscratch you, but the spirit compels me saying that I must scratch you as wellas my other sisters have done and as my sister Joan also must do before the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"138Demonic Possession and ExorcismAssizes.’ For this was, if the time be marked, almost three weeks before theAssizes.At the first scratching, the maid seemed to move somewhat from her.But the child followed still on her knees, saying to her that it were as goodto take it now, as at another time, for she must fetch blood on her, and shemust have her pennyworths of her. She further said that she knew that shedid now cry, which indeed she did, but that she could not hear her, for somuch the spirit told her before, because she would not pity her. When thechild was weary and breathless, she stopped scratching, and wiped that littleblood and water together, which came from the maid’s hand on her ownhands. Then Doctor Dorington began to instruct the maid and to exhort herwith many good speeches saying that God would surely not suffer her to bethis cried out on by these wicked spirits and afflicted in this sort by theseinnocent children contrary to their wills, if she were not consenting or at theleast concealing and had some knowledge of these wicked practices, whichher Mother had confessed. The maid very stiffly denied all that could besaid, and desired God to show some present token on her that they all mightknow that she was guilty of these matters. Presently, after these words, hernose began to bleed, and she bled very much, which, whether it were a signof God’s sending at that time in token of her guiltiness or not, that heonly knows, and man, I think, may without offence greatly suspect. Yet thisshe could say, being charged withal, that she had bled four times the daybefore, which thing was very true. She bled very much every time, alwayssaying that she had not bled so much to her remembrance in seven yearsbefore, wishing that this often bleeding would foreshadow no evil towardsher. In the end, the child herself said that the thing which now stands by herdoes tell her that she must not come out of her fit until the old man JohnSamuel, the maid’s Father, will come and pronounce certain words to her,which she must tell him. Then was she asked by the maid and others thatstood by what those words would be. But the child could not hear anybody.By and by she herself said, ‘What, is her Father come into this reckoningnow? And will I never come out of my fit until he speak these words that,even as he is a witch and consented to the death of the Lady Cromwell,"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children139so to charge the spirit to depart from me, and then I will be well and notbefore? He looked so ill-favouredly at me, I did even think,’ said she, ‘thathe was as bad as the worst.’ Then Master Throckmorton, hearing thosewords of his daughter, desired Master Henry Pickering, the child’s uncle,and two other of the neighbours, to go and see if they could procure himto come. But he refused to come. So the company departed for that night.And the child went to bed in her fit and so continued until the Assizes day,as hereafter you shall hear. Yet her Father did not cease to send for the manevery day, and to go to him himself. Yet he could by no means procure himto come to his house. On the Sunday following, which was the eighteenthof March64in the morning, the spirit came again to her. Then the childsaid, ‘The thing says that I would not both hear and see the young witch ifshe were here,’ for so the spirits always called her, ‘and see the thing65alsowhich I never did before, all of them together.’ Then the maid was calledfor. And she asked the child what the thing says to her. She answered thatthe thing tells her that now she must be startled as well as her sister Joandoes whenever she names God, that she must not come out of her fit thisweek nor the next, and perhaps never, until one of these three things cometo pass. These are, she said to the maid, ‘Either your Father must comeand speak these words to me, even as he is a witch and has consented tothe death of the Lady Cromwell, or you must confess that you are a witchand have bewitched me and my sisters, or else you must be hanged.’ Thenthe maid was willed to ask the child whether she would come out of her fitwhenever or where ever her Father spoke these words to her. Then the childasked the spirit. And the spirit answered that she would. And so for thattime, the thing departed. And she continued in her fit, the manner of whichwas as follows. She would sit sometimes in the house all the day long, likeone in a melancholic passion, not speaking to anybody nor desirous of anycompany. Sometimes again she is very lightsome and merry and will sportand play with her sisters a great part of the day, yet not hearing nor seeinganybody, nor speaking to anyone particularly. When anyone passes by her,64This should probably read17March.65The spirits."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"140Demonic Possession and Exorcismshe will say, ‘Yonder goes such a coloured gown, I marvel how it goes alone.Yonder is a pair of nether stocks of such a colour, or yonder is a hat, a pairof shoes or a cloak, but I can see nothing else.’ If one had shown her theirhand with a ring on their finger, she would say, ‘Yonder is a ring hanging inthe air. I marvel how it hangs and nobody holds it.’ Many will think thesematters incredible, but assuredly they are most true. This thing also wasmany times proved while those kinds of fits continued on her, that, sittingat dinner or supper, she would suddenly have her mouth shut. And if AgnesSamuel had then come and held a knife to her mouth and put it betweenher lips, her mouth would have been presently opened, and not before. Andthus the spirit has dealt with her five or six times in a dinner time. And inthis fit, she continued three weeks but one day, for so long did it take herbefore the Assizes...66And in the same evening, after the Court was broken up, Master JusticeFenner, who for that time was Judge alone, had a desire to see Mistress JoanThrockmorton, then being at the sign of the Crown of Huntington. Beingthe place where the said Judge then lodged, he went into the garden to thesaid Mistress Joan, then in the company of other women. There the Judge,with a great assembly of Justices and gentlemen, met the said Mistress JoanThrockmorton in a fair garden walk. She was at that time out of her fit andperfectly well. And after some speeches made by the said Judge to MistressJoan, she fell into one of her ordinary fits. Her eyes were closed up, shakingher shoulders. And her arms were stretched right out. She was ready tofall to the ground, but that she was assisted by her Father. And not beingable to stand, she was led into an arbour, whither went also both the Judgeand the other company. There they saw the said Mistress Joan grievouslytormented, most pitiful to behold. Many good prayers were made both bythe Judge and all the company, but no ease appeared. Then the Father ofthe said Mistress Joan told the Judge that there was one in the company,naming Agnes Samuel, that, if she would say certain words in the manner66Onthe day of the Assizes, Joan travels with Agnes to Huntington and lodges at the CrownInn. During the day she is visited by ‘five hundred men’ who tested her and viewed her fits(sigs.n.3.r–n.3.v). That evening she is visited by Judge Fenner."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children141of a charge, then the said Mistress Joan would be presently well, a thingdesired by all the company. Therefore the Judge caused the said AgnesSamuel to stand forward, and to know the charge, which was repeated byMaster Throckmorton, Father of the said Mistress Joan. The words werethese. ‘As I am a witch, and a worse witch than my Mother, and did consentto the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the Devil to let MistressJoan Throckmorton come out of her fit at this present.’ But before AgnesSamuel spoke the charge, to make some trial in others of the effect thereof,the Judge himself, Doctor Dorington, Master Throckmorton and others,spoke the words of the charge. But the said Mistress Joan had small ease bytheir speeches, neither would she come out of her fit. Then both the Judgeand the other company made many good prayers and petitions to God, butno improvement appeared. After this, Agnes Samuel was commanded by theJudge to make some good prayers to God for the ease of the said MistressJoan, which she did. At which time, if the said Agnes Samuel prayed to Godor Jesus Christ, then the said Mistress Joan was in effect more troubledthan before. And the reason was foretold by the said Mistress Joan and allher other sisters by the spirit, that whenever the said Agnes did use thename of God or Jesus Christ, they would be worse troubled than when anyother spoke the words. For he that is perfect God Almighty will not allowhis name to be used in the mouth of such a wicked creature, which wasthen proved true. Then Agnes Samuel was commanded to say, ‘As I am nowitch, neither did consent to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I chargethe Devil to let Mistress Joan come out of her fit at this present.’ But allthis was to no purpose. Lastly, the said Agnes Samuel was commanded tosay the right charge, which was, ‘As I am a witch, and a worse witch than myMother, and did consent to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I chargethe Devil to let Mistress Joan Throckmorton come out of her fit at thispresent.’ These words were no sooner spoken by the said Agnes Samuel,but the said Mistress Joan Throckmorton wiped her eyes and came out ofher fit. And she made a low curtsy to the Judge. And so she remained abouthalf a quarter of an hour. And then she fell into another kind of fit, firstshaking one leg after the other, then one arm after the other, and then her"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142Demonic Possession and Exorcismhead and shoulders, with other extraordinary passions, to the great grief ofthem that were present, and the Judge greatly lamenting the case. When bothhe and many others had made some good prayers, and finding no ease, theycaused the said Agnes Samuel to repeat another charm, viz., ‘As I am a witchand would have bewitched to death Mistress Joan Throckmorton in the lastweek of her great sickness, so I charge you Devil to let Mistress Joan comeout of her fit at this present.’ Which words being said by the said AgnesSamuel, the said Mistress Joan was presently well. Then the Judge askedher where she had been. She answered, ‘I have been asleep.’ ‘I pray God,’said the Judge, ‘send you no more such sleeps.’ Soon after, she fell into oneof her other ordinary fits, with a most strange and terrible kind of sneezingand other passions. These were so vehement and pitiful to be heard, that itmoved all the company at one instant to pray to God to save her, fearingthat her head would have burst in sunder, or her eyes start out of the same.So the Judge made no delay, but caused the said Agnes Samuel to speakthe other charm which was, ‘As I am a witch, and did bewitch MistressPickering of Ellington, since my Mother’s confession, so I charge youDevil to let Mistress Joan come out of her fit at this present.’ Which wordsbeing spoken, presently the said Mistress Joan was as well as ever she wasin her life, and so has continued without any grief or fits until this day. TheLord be thanked therefore.The next day being Thursday, in the morning, there were three severalindictments made and delivered to the great Inquest, of which the one wasagainst old Father Samuel, old Mother Samuel, and Agnes their daugh-ter, for bewitching to death the Lady Cromwell, late wife of Sir HenryCromwell, Knight, of Finchingbrook in the county of Huntington, con-trary to God’s Laws and the statute made in the fifteenth year of the Queen’sMajesty’s reign that now is &c.67The other two indictments were framed on the said statute for bewitchingof Mistress Joan Throckmorton, Mistress Jane Throckmorton and others,contrary to the said statute. The indictments being delivered to the grandJury, the evidence was given them privately by Master Dorington, Doctor67The1563Witchcraft Act."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children143of Divinity and Parson of the town of Warboys aforesaid, by GilbertPickering Esquire, of Titchmarsh in the County of Northampton, byRobert Throckmorton Esquire, Father of the said children, by RobertThrockmorton Esquire, of Brampton in the said County of Huntington,by John Pickering and Henry Pickering Gentlemen, and by Thomas Nut,Master of Arts and Vicar of Ellington. The grand Jury made no great delaybut found them all guilty. And about eight o’clock, the evidence by theforenamed gentlemen was openly at large delivered in the Court to the Juryof life and death. And with great patience of the Judge, it was continuedtill one o’clock in the afternoon. So many of these proofs, presumptions,circumstances, and reasons contained in this book were at large delivered,as that time would afford, which was five hours, without intermission orinterruption, until both the Judge, Justices, and Jury said openly that thecause was most apparent. Their consciences were well satisfied that the saidwitches were guilty and had deserved death. And there withal, the gentle-men ceased to give any further evidence. And this as no final thing is tobe remembered, that Mistress Jane Throckmorton on Friday the twentysixth of March last past, being in one of her accustomed fits, said that thespirit told her, she would never come out of her fit until old Father Samuelhad said these words, ‘As I am a witch and consented to the death of LadyCromwell, so I charge the Devil to allow Mistress Jane to come out of herfit.’ And this she published openly in the hearing of many. Therefore herFather sought means, both by himself and others, to have John Samuel cometo his house to the child, but they could not prevail. Wherefore the saidJane continued in her senseless fits with many pangs and vexations in everypart, as they are before described, from the said sixteenth of March untilthe fourth of April, which was three weeks except a day. Also on this day,68the said Mistress Jane was brought to Huntington. And there in her fit wasset in the Court before the Judge, where many questions were demanded ofher. But she answered to none, for the Devil would not allow her to speak.Her eyes were open, yet such a mist was before them that she neither knew68The account of Jane’s cure in court is placed out of sequence. It should have been included beforethe decision was made on the guilt of the Samuels."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144Demonic Possession and Exorcismnor did see her Father who was next to her, and divers of her uncles andfriends. Then the Judge caused old Samuel to be brought from amongstthe other prisoners to the upper bar, near to the place where the Clerks sat,where also stood the said Jane. And the Judge was told before that if oldSamuel would speak the words before recited, the said Jane should be well.The Judge therefore asked him whether he by any means could cause thesaid Jane to come out of her fit. He denied the same. Then the Judge, ashe was informed that the said Samuel had a charm made of certain wordswhich, if he would speak them, the child would be well, therefore recitedthe charm. And he willed him to speak the words. But he refused the sameand said, ‘I will not speak them.’ The Judge persuaded him and entreatedhim, insomuch that the said Judge, the rather to encourage the said Samuel,himself openly spoke the charm, as did also Master Doctor Dorington andothers then present, by the Judge’s appointment. Yet he refused the same.Many good and godly prayers were openly made to God, both by the Judgeand others, for the ease of the child, at which the child seemed not to bemoved. Then the Judge willed Samuel to pray to God for the comfort of thechild, which he did. But when he named God or Jesus Christ, the child’shead, shoulders, and arms were sorely shaken, and in effect more troubledthan before. Then the Judge said that, if he would not speak the words ofthe charm, the court would hold him guilty of the crimes of which he wasaccused. And so eventually, with much ado, the said Samuel, with a loudvoice, said in the hearing of all that were present, ‘As I am a witch, and didconsent to the death of the Lady Cromwell, so I charge the Devil to allowMistress Jane to come out of her fit at this present.’Which words, being no sooner spoken by the old witch, but the saidMistress Jane, as her accustomed order was, wiped her eyes, and came out ofher fit. And then, seeing her Father, she knelt down and asked his blessing.And she made a curtsy to her uncles that stood near her, whom before shegave no indication of knowing. And wondering, she said, ‘O Lord, Father,where am I?’ For it seemed that she neither saw nor heard before, nor knewhow she was brought into such a presence. Then the Judge said, ‘You allsee, she is now well, but not with the music of David’s harp,’ alluding to the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children145place of Scripture where King Saul, being vexed by an evil spirit, receivedcomfort and help when David played on his harp before him.69Then theconfession of old Mother Samuel, before specified, made the twenty sixthday of December, 1592 last past at Burkden, before the Reverend Fatherin God, William, Bishop of Lincoln, was openly read. So also was readthe confession of the said Mother Samuel made at Burkden aforesaid thetwenty ninth day of December, 1592 before the said Reverend Father inGod, William, Bishop of Lincoln, Frances Cromwell, and Richard Tryce,Esquires, Justices of her Majesty’s peace within the county of Huntington,which also is before specified. After these confessions read and delivered tothe jury, it pleased God for the further proof and overthrow of these wickedpersons to rear up more witnesses unexpected at that time, who spoke somethings of their own knowledge, and some of report. The first was RobertPoulter, vicar and curate of Brampton aforesaid, who said openly that oneof his parishioners called John Langley, at that instant being very sick in hisbed, had told him that one day he, being at Huntington at the sign of theCrown, did in the hearing of old Mother Samuel forbid Mother Knowlesof Brampton aforesaid, to give her any meat for that she was an old witch.And thereupon in the afternoon, as he went from Huntington to Brampton,having a good horse under him, it presently died in the field. And withintwo days after, by the Providence of God, he did escape death, twice orthrice very dangerously. And though it pleased God not to allow the Devilto have the mastery of his body at that time, yet presently after, he lost asmany good and sound cattle to all men’s judgements, as were worth twentymarks. And he himself, not long after, was in body extraordinarily handled.And the same night of the day of the Assizes, as after it proved true, the sameJohn Langley died. Also the forenamed Master Robert Throckmorton ofBrampton, who before had given some evidence against the said witch onthe children’s behalf, now spoke for himself that he likewise at Huntingtonand in other places, having dealt very roughly in speeches with the saidMother Samuel, on Friday the tenth day following, had one of his two691Samuel16.23"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146Demonic Possession and Exorcismyear-old beasts die. And on Sunday next after, another beast of the samecompany and like age died also. The next week after, on Friday, he had ayearling calf die. And the next Sunday following, he had another calf of thesame company and like age die also. The next week after, on Friday, he hadahog die. And the next Sunday after, he had a sow having ten pigs suckingon her die also. Whereupon, advice was given to him that whatever thingnext died, to make a hole in the ground and burn the same. Likewise, thefourth week on Friday, he had a very fair cow worth four marks die. And hisservants made a hole in the ground and buried the same cow in it. And theythrew faggots and fire on her and burnt her. And after that, all his cattle didwell. Of this last matter, Mother Samuel being examined the night beforeher execution, confessed the bewitching of the said cattle, in manner andform as is declared.Then the gaoler of Huntington gave this evidence. A man of his, findingMother Samuel very unruly whilst she was prisoner, at one time chainedher to a bed-post. Wherefore, not long after, his man fell sick and in allrespects was handled as the forenamed children were, with heaving up anddown of his body, shaking his arms, legs and head, having more strength inhim in his fits than any two men had, crying out against Mother Samuel,saying that she did bewitch him. And thus remaining in this extraordinarycourse of sickness, about five or six days after, he died.The said gaoler said also that, not long after the death of his servant,he had one of his sons fall sick, and was for the most part handled as hisservant beforenamed was. So that it was most apparent that he was bewitched.Therefore the said gaoler went into the prison, and brought Mother Samuelto his son’s bed-side. And there he held her until his son had scratchedher, and so presently his son recovered. And to draw to some end, the juryof life and death, in the afternoon, found all the IndictmentsBilla vera,which, when old Father Samuel heard, he said to his wife in the hearing ofmany, ‘A plague of God light on you. For you are she that has brought usall to this, and we may thank you for it.’Then the Judge came to sentencing. And he asked old Father Samuel whathe had to say for himself, why judgement of death should not be pronouncedon him. At this, he answered that he had nothing to say, but the Lord have"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children147mercy on him. Then the Judge asked old Mother Samuel what she had tosay for herself to stay judgement. At this, she answered that she was withchild, which set all the company to laughing greatly, and she herself morethan any other because, as she thought, no judgement would have been givenfor that reason. Her age was near four score. Therefore the Judge movedher to leave that answer. But by no means would she be driven from it, untilat length a jury of women were empanelled and sworn to search her. Theygave their verdict that she was not with child unless, as some said, it waswith the Devil and no marvel. For after she was found guilty, there went theforenamed Master Henry Pickering to her where she stood amongst theprisoners to persuade her to confess the truth. And, amongst other things,she confessed that the forenamed William Langley who gave the spirits toher, had carnal knowledge of her body when she received them. Some areof the opinion that it was the Devil in man’s likeness.After all this, the Judge asked Agnes Samuel, the daughter, what shehad to say why judgement of death should not be given her. At which timethere was one, a prisoner standing by her, that willed her to say that shewas also with child. ‘No,’ said she, ‘that will I not do. It will never be saidthat I was both a witch and a whore.’ And so the Judge, after very soundand divine counsel given severally to them all, proceeded to judgementwhich was to death. The next day, certain godly men went to the prisonto persuade the condemned parties to repentance and to confess their sinsto the world, and crave pardon at God’s merciful hands. At which timeMother Samuel was asked by Master John Dorington, Esquire, one ofher Majesty’s Justices of the County of Huntington, whether she did notbewitch the Lady Cromwell. She said, ‘No, in truth, I did not.’ Then herhusband, old Father Samuel, standing behind and hearing her deny the same,said, ‘Deny it not, but confess the truth. For you did it one way or other.’The confession of the old woman Alice Samuel to certain questions thatwere demanded of her by master Doctor Chamberlain at the time and placeof her execution being on the ladder.First, being demanded what were the names of those spirits with whichshe bewitched, she said that they were called Pluck, Catch and White,which names she often repeated. Being asked whether she had bewitched"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148Demonic Possession and Exorcismthe Lady Cromwell to death or not, she answered that she had. Being askedwith which of her spirits she did bewitch the said Lady to death, she said,‘With Catch.’ And being demanded for what reason she did it, she answered,‘Because the said Lady had caused some of her hair and her hair-lace tobe burned.’ And she said that Catch willed her to be revenged of the saidLady and thereupon the said Mother Samuel bade him go and do what hewould. And being asked, what Catch said to her when he came back again,she confessed that he said that he had been revenged of her. Moreover sheconfessed, and on her death did say for truth, that she was guilty of thedeath of the Lady Cromwell. Being demanded whether she had bewitchedMaster Throckmorton’s children, she confessed that she had done it. Beingasked with which of her spirits, she said that it was Pluck. Being asked whatshe said to him when she sent him about that matter, she confessed thatshe willed him to go torment them, but not hurt them. Being asked howlong they should be in that state, she said that she could not tell and thatshe had not seen Pluck since Christmas last. Being asked what she didwith White, she said that she never did hurt with him. And she said thatshe had sent him to the sea, and that he had sucked on her chin. But theother two had not any reward. And likewise, she confessed that she hadthose spirits from one whose name, she said, was Langley. Where he dwellsshe knew not. And because her husband would not confess anything of thewitchcraft at the time of his death, nor of the awareness of himself or hisdaughter as accessories to the same, it was demanded of her whether herhusband was privy to the death of the Lady Cromwell or not. She answered,‘He was.’Being demanded whether her husband was a witch or had any skill inwitchcraft, she said, ‘He had,’ and that he could both bewitch and unwitch.But touching her daughter, she would in no way confess anything, but foughtby all means to clear her. And as for her daughter herself, she confessednothing at all touching the witchcraft. But being willed by Master DoctorChamberlain to say The Lord’s Prayer and the Creed as she stood on theladder ready to be executed, she said The Lord’s Prayer until she came tosay, ‘But deliver us from evil,’ the which by no means she could pronounce."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The story of the Throckmorton children149And in the Creed, she missed very much, and could not say that she believedin the Catholic Church.After the execution was ended and these three persons were thoroughlydead, the gaoler, whose office it is to see them buried, stripped off theirclothes and, being naked, he found on the body of the old woman AliceSamuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teatto the length of half an inch. Both he and his wife perceiving this, at the firstsight thereof, they meant not to disclose it, because it was adjoining to sosecret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing toconceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that private place a littleabove which it grew, they made open show of thereof to divers that stoodby. After this, the gaoler’s wife took the same teat in her hand and, seemingto strain it, at first there issued out as if it had been beesenings, to use thegaoler’s word, which is a mixture of yellow milk and water. At the secondtime, there came out in similitude like clear milk, and in the end very blooditself. For the truth of this matter, it is not to be doubted of any. For it isnot only the gaoler’s report to all that require it of him, but there are fortyothers also in Huntington shire, of honest conversation, that are ready toconfirm the same on their own sight.And thus you have the story of these three witches of Warboys, as plainlyand briefly as may be delivered to you. If any be desirous to know the presentstate of these children, how they are and have been since the death of theseparties, you will understand that, since their day of execution, not any oneof them have had any fit at all, neither yet grudging or complaining of anysuch thing.

In February1603,hewas sen-tenced to lose his ears for having libelled the Vice Chancellor of theUniversity of Oxford, John Howson, a vehement opponent of Puritanism.Itwas the third occasion on which he had come to the attention of thepublic. In1600,hehad been involved in the trial of the Puritan exor-cist John Darrell for fraudulently claiming to have dispossessed ThomasDarling, and a number of other demoniacs. And he had been the leadingcharacter in the events which took place in Burton on Trent in1596whichform the backdrop to this text, and which led, in part, to the trial of JohnDarrell.On17February,1596Thomas Darling began to have a series of fits whichwereto continue throughout the next five months. Earlier on this day hehad come across an old woman in a wood wearing a grey gown with threewarts upon her face. As he passed by her, he passed wind, to which sheresponded, ‘Gyp with a mischief, and fart with a bell. I will go to Heaven,and you will go to Hell.’1Suspicion for having bewitched Thomas fell onthe sixty-year-old Alice Gooderidge who, like her mother Elizabeth Wright,had long been suspected of devilish practices. She was arrested and confinedin Derby gaol on14April.After scratchings, and the discovery of witch’s marks upon her body, sheconfessed upon2Maythat she had met Thomas in the wood and respondedto his calling her the witch of Stapenhill by asking him ‘Every boy does callme witch, but did I ever make your arse to itch?’2The next day,3May,she repeated the statement, adding that she had sent the devil in the formof a little red and white dog which she called Minny to torment the boy.Alice was returned to jail where little more is heard of her fate until the last1Anon.,1597,p.4(see below, p.159).2Anon.,1597,p.25(see below, p.177).150"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling151sentence of the book: ‘Now the witch is dead. Had she lived, she wouldhave been executed.’3Onthat same day,3May,Thomas was visited by the staunch Puritandivine Arthur Hildersham, and a number of other ministers includingJohn Darrell,4all of whom prayed for his deliverance. On27Maythe boyreceived another visit from Darrell who suggested that his family and othersshould follow a regime of prayer and fasting. The following day a numberof devils are vomited out of his body. Although attacked by Satan again on8June, Thomas resisted. God bound ‘Satan fast in a chain’,5and Thomasremained untroubled from that day.The version of the text which we have was edited and prefaced by JohnDenison6at the request of a Mr Walkeden, Thomas Darling’s grandfather.Before its final publication it was read by Hildersham and Darrell, thelatter of whom (Denison later claimed) made a significant amendment.7ButDenison worked from notes made by Jesse Bee who had been presentthroughout Thomas’s possession. Jesse Bee was a ‘private Christian andman of trade (Preface)’, ‘a sadler’.8Buthewas also a ‘cunning man’. Calledin after the failure of medical treatments of the boy, it was his diagnosis ofbewitchment,9which set the stage for the ensuing events.As with the narrative of the Throckmorton children, this text is driven bythe need to demonstrate that Thomas Darling was genuinely bewitched,and that the punishment of the guilty witch was merited. Alice Good-eridge is implicated, accused, scratched, examined for the witch’s marksshe had pathetically attempted to remove, confesses, even elaborates onher activities. The reality, of witchcraft, good and bad, is embedded in thenarrative. Bee is a witchcraft specialist. Not only Alice and her Mother, buther husband and daughter are suspected and examined.10On17April, awitchfinder accuses Alice and offers to cure the boy.11The next day, WidowWorthington, the good witch of Hoppers, offers her assistance, as does3Anon.,1597,p.43(see below, p.191). Alice is tormented by a demon after its departure from Thomas(see p.38,below, p.187). As a first offender, Alice would have been sent to prison for a year. Certainly,she died in prison during this time. See Darrell,1600c, p.40.4Although no mention is made of Darrell being among the ministers in this text, we know fromSamuel Harsnett’s account of Thomas Darling that he was present along with his “right hand man”George More. See Harsnett,1599,pp.270–1.5Anon.,1597,p.42(see below, p.190).6The Preface was signed ‘J. D.’ But Harsnett,1599,p.267cites a John Denison as the editor.

Thomas’s mother ‘sharply reproved themfor attempting a thing so unlawful’.12Aweek later, Thomas’s uncle cannotbe persuaded to seek help from other witches. His mother relents, but theattempt is forestalled as ‘wicked and dangerous’.13OneofDenison’s main purposes is to combat those who deny the realityof witches. A mysterious stranger who visited the boy on17April said that‘there were no witches’ and accused him of dissembling.14Thomas wasdistressed, but his piety won the day. Just before his final return to healthin mid June, God reminded Thomas, ‘you have an enemy here on earththat says you are a dissembler. He will fry in Hell torments.’15The text also voices Puritan concerns about Catholic claims that onlytheir priests have the power to dispossess.16Arthur Hildersham expressedthe orthodox Anglican position on exorcism, before hinting at the useof prayer and fasting to sanctify what was God’s judgement.17Darrell’seventual active intervention established the Puritan case for the power ofcommunal prayer and fasting in deliverance from the devil against papistpretensions.18Denison also saw the possession of Thomas Darling as being played outin an apocalyptic context. The vexing of Thomas is a proof of the prophecyin the Revelation of St John: ‘The Devil, says he, has great wrath, knowingthat he has but a short time.’19Heis thrown into cruel fits when Jesse Beereads the first chapters of this work. Thomas has visions of heaven and helland the day of judgement. The body of Darling is itself a site of warfarebetween good and evil, and prefigures the final battle between God andSatan. ‘“Come Thomas,” says Jesse Bee, “will we provoke him to battle?” Towhom the child answered, “yes, very willingly”.’20This consisted in readingthe Bible, usually the Gospel of John, which Protestant activity inevitablyprovoked Satan’s rage.21Just as Satan’s activity in the world increases towardsits end, so also does his tormenting of Thomas as his departure from the12Anon.,1597,p.18(see below, p.170).13Anon.,1597,p.22(see below, p.174).14Anon.,1597,p.15(see below, p.168).

And Thomas’s fits increase in number and severity untilthe arrival of Darrell on27May.As the site of the battle between good and evil, Thomas mimics Christin his resistance to the Tempter. He is the exemplar of Puritan piety andProtestant faith. When he is first afflicted he accepts the prospect of deathwith equanimity, although he wished ‘that he might have lived to be apreacher, to thunder out the threatenings of God’s word against sin andall abominations, wherewith these days do abound’.22Inhis torments,he becomes a true martyr. The spectators react as if witnessing a martyr-dom: ‘Satan’s raging against him did increase in such a manner as causedthe beholders to shed tears abundantly.’23John Foxe saw the connectionbetween the torments of martyrs and those of demoniacs when he dispos-sessed a law student called Briggs in1574.Foxe’s account circulated widelyamong Puritans and may well have influenced Denison (and/or ThomasDarling).24Howdoes the text view Thomas Darling? He is certainly not consideredto be simulating his behaviour. He is a saint and not a sinner, a puritanmartyr, and a victim of bewitchment. But does it see him as both divinelyinspired and possessed by the devil? Judging from the work’s title, JohnDenison thinks so. But the text itself is much more opaque, reflectingas it does uncertainty among those who were actually involved. And theuncertainty turns on the issue of whether genuine puritan faith and pietyis compatible with genuine demonic possession.That he is bewitched, and that the devil is the cause of his fits, allbut the anonymous stranger are agreed. But the diagnosis of possessionis only made by John Darrell towards the end of the narrative. Darlinghimself was later to claim that only after Darrell’s diagnosis did he think ofhimself as possessed.25And only after this diagnosis, do we have a ‘genuine’possession when we hear the devils themselves speaking through Thomas.Prior to this, we only hear Thomas’s divinely inspired responses to hisinternal dialogue with Satan. But the diagnosis of possession raised thequestion whether these godly responses were themselves demonic, and itthreatened his saintly status.Darrell himself was later to conclude that all the speeches of Thomas were‘uttered by Satan transforming himself into an Angel of light’.26Eccarshall,the pastor of Burton, suspected the same.27Jesse Bee, on the other hand,22Anon.,1597,p.2(see below, p.158).23Anon.,1597,p.28(see below, pp.178–9).24SeePurkiss,1998,pp.237–8;and Thomas,1972,pp.574–6.25Harsnett,1599,p.272.26Harsnett,1599,p.292.27Seeanon.,1597,p.16(see below, p.169)."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154Demonic Possession and Exorcismheld firm to his conviction that Darling was both possessed and, in hisresponses to Satan, ‘directed by the spirit of God’.28Under duress, Darlingwas later to confess that he was a counterfeiter, a confession he withdrewshortly after.

But I suspect that his originaldeposition in Darrell’s trial reflects his genuine conviction of his own specialstatus: ‘as I know at this present for a certainty, that I have the spirit of Godwithin me, so do I with the like certainty believe that, in my dialogues withSatan . . . I had the spirit of God in me, and by that spirit resisted Satan atthose times, by alledging the scriptures to confound him.’2928Harsnett,1599,p.291.29Harsnett,1599,p.290."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The most wonderful and true story of a certainWitch named Alice Gooderige of Stapen Hill, who wasarraigned and convicted at Derby at the Assizes there.As also a true report of the strange tormentsof Thomas Darling, a boy of thirteen years of age, thatwas possessed by the Devil, with his horrible fits andterrible Apparitions by him uttered at Burton onTrent in the County of Stafford, and of hismarvellous deliverance.Printed at London for J.O., 1597.To the ReaderTime has proved by experience, Christian reader, that which St John bythe spirit of Prophecy foreshadowed.

But, besides that, forthe particulars, a hundred more witnesses might be produced than are hereinserted, and divers of them of good worth and credit. The matter itselfis well known to the right Honourable Sir Edmund Anderson, Knight,Lord Chief Justice of the common pleas, as being voluntarily confessedto him by the witch, who was on the same arraigned and convicted beforehis Honour at Derby, and therefore is not lightly to be excepted against.Besides also, it was compiled by a private Christian and man of trade who,being with the boy in almost all his fits, did both take notes at the time of allthat was done and spoken, and conferred also afterward with the witnessesof best judgement and credit, that he might be sure of that which he had setdown. In a word, I think there can scarcely be any instance shown, the HolyScriptures excepted, whereby both the peevish opinion that there are nowitches, and the Popish assertion that only their priests can dispossess, maybe better controlled than by this. The first kind of people, I rather think, areto be pitied than confuted, daily experience crying out against their folly.The other may hereby see their too peremptory conclusions overthrown,since he whose advice and help was used in this matter is very well knownto be a faithful preacher of the Gospel, and so consequently an enemy toPopery.

He took the boy with him. And being earnest infollowing his game, he lost him. After he had wandered up and down for awhile and could not find his uncle, he returned home to his Uncle’s house,where he waited. Having come home, he waxed heavy. And afterwards, hegrew to be very sick, vomiting and casting up what he had eaten at dinner,and so was got to bed. The next morning, he had sore fits with extremevomitings, so that all who saw him judged it to be some strange ague.In the time of this extremity in his fits, he would point many times withhis hand, saying, ‘Look where green angels stand in the window.’ And notlong after he would often complain that a green cat troubled him, whichthing was judged by his friends to proceed from lightness in his head.Many other things also happened in these times worth noting, whereofin respect of the unexpected event, there was no note kept. His sicknesswaxing more vehement, his aunt went to a physician with his urine. Hesaid that he saw no signs of any natural disease in the child, unless itwas the worms. His sickness still increasing, notwithstanding anythingprescribed or ministered, she went again with his urine to the physician.He judged as before, saying further that he doubted that the child wasbewitched, which she, holding incredible, imparted to nobody. Rather,she imagined it to be although some strange, yet a natural disease.

Also, it tookaway the use of his legs, so that he needed to be carried up and down, save inhis fits, for then he was nimble enough. How he spent the time between hisfits, it is worth the observing. His exercises were such as might well havebefitted one of riper years, wherein he showed the fruits of his education,which was religious and godly. With those that were good Christians hetook great pleasure to confer. To them he would signify his daily expectationof death, and his resolute readiness to leave the world and to be with Christ.And all his love to the world, he said, extended thus far, that, if God hadso been pleased, he might have lived to be a preacher, to thunder out thethreatenings of God’s word against sin and all abominations, wherewiththese days do abound. In these fits and such like speeches, he continued tillmid-Lent Sunday, being the twenty first of March. That day, besides thathis wonted fit took him, he began in other and more strange manners tobe vexed. For he sank down like one in a swoon. Forthwith they took himup, and laid him on a bed where, having lain some small time, he rose upsuddenly, striving and struggling in such a way that it was enough for twoor three to hold him. Then he fell suddenly on his back and, lying in such amanner, raised up his legs one after the other so stiffly, that the bystanderscould not bend them in the back of the knee. And thus, continuing a whilewith grievous roaring, at last he raised himself up on his feet and his head,his belly standing up much above his head or feet. Continuing so a littletime, he fell down on his back groaning very pitifully. Then rising up, he ranaround on his hands and his feet, keeping a certain circular course. Afterthat, striving and struggling with groaning, he began vomiting. And then,coming to himself, he said, ‘The Lord’s name be praised.’ This was the firstfit that he had. And he was ordinarily handled in this way during the time ofhis possession, save that he did seldom run around in that manner that isaforesaid. The fit being thus ended, he fell on his knees suddenly in prayer,and that so pithily that the bystanders wondered thereat, as much as theydid at his strange visitation, being no less comforted by the one, than theywere before grieved at the other.The next day he had many fits, in which he would often point at a green catthat troubled him, and still entreated his friends that were present to pray"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling159for him. Between his fits, he requested them to read the Scriptures which,when they could not do for weeping to behold his misery, they sent, at theboy’s request, for one Jesse Bee who dwells in Burton on Trent. He took thenotes of the whole matter. And after some speeches, the boy entreated himto read where he would. He read the eleventh chapter according to SaintJohn till he came to the fourth verse, at which time the boy was throwninto a fit like the former. This usually lasted about half of quarter of anhour. Jesse continued reading the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth of John’sGospel, and the first and second of Revelation. During which time, his fitscontinued one immediately after the other. Ending with a vomit, he usedto say, ‘The Lord’s name be praised,’ and many times, ‘Lord Jesu receivemy soul.’ When Jesse either ceased to speak of any comfortable matter orto read the Scriptures, the boy was quiet from his fits. But when he wasso religiously occupied, they came thick upon him. Jesse Bee, consideringand observing this, told the boy’s aunt that he suspected that the boy wasbewitched. On which occasion, though she doubted of the matter, shetold him as before, both of her going to the physician and the physician’sjudgement concerning the boy’s sickness which he33overhearing, yet saidnothing. The next morning, he said to the maid that made him ready, ‘I heardmy Aunt tell Jesse Bee that I was bewitched. The same Saturday that mysickness took me, I lost my uncle in the wood, and in the coppice I met alittle old woman. She had a gray gown with a black fringe about the cape,abroad fringed hat, and three warts on her face. I have seen her beggingat our door. As for her name I know it not, but by sight I can know heragain. As I passed by her in the coppice, I chanced, against my will, to passwind which she, taking in anger, said, “Gyp with a mischief, and fart withabell. I will go to Heaven, and you will go to Hell.” And forthwith shestooped to the ground. I stood still and looked at her, viewing every partof her, wondering what she stooped for. So I came home, and she wentto Winfell.’ Hereupon, a more vehement suspicion arose. Some judgedit to be the witch of Stapen Hill. Others, because she was old and littleabroad, rather thought it to be Alice Gooderidge her daughter, who was33The boy."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"160Demonic Possession and Exorcismheld in great suspicion by many to be a dabbler in these devilish practices,as afterward it proved. Thus the boy’s fits continued daily, from the twentythird of March till the eighth of April, to the great trouble of his aunt inlooking after him, and attending on such as came to see him, whereof manywere of very good account. When, in his fits, he was deprived of the useof speech, he would make signs of praying with folded hands, sometimeslifting them up, and sometime striking them on his breast. Oft times alsoin these fits, he would suddenly and amazedly open his eyes, staring andshrieking most pitifully, clapping both his hands on his face, not being ableto endure the sight of such fearful objects as he beheld. In this manner hewas tormented in the day, and had reasonably good rest in the night, exceptfor some fearful dreams, whereunto he was much subject. Being asked ifhe could remember what he did when he made such signs, he answered thatsometimes he prayed, and sometimes the cat tossed him up and down in astring. And thus for a good time he could remember, and readily tell of histroubles.The Thursday before Easter, being the eighth of April, there came tosee the boy Mistress Walkeden of Clifton, his grandmother, and MistressSaunders, his aunt. When they were told what the boy said concerningmeeting a woman in the wood, Mistress Walkeden, on the witch’s cursing,the boy’s sudden sickness, his strange handling, and the physician’s judge-ment, thought it more than probable that the boy was bewitched. And by themarks that he had taken, she perceived that it was Alice Gooderidge whichhad thus bewitched him. Yet out of conscience reluctant to accuse her till itappeared on sure proof, she sent for her to come into the town to talk withher privately. When, with much ado, she was come, they brought her intothe chamber where the boy was. The boy fell suddenly into a marvellouslysore fit, which being ended, Mistress Walkeden asked her if she knew thatboy. She answered that she knew him not. Many other questions were askedbut in vain, for she would not confess anything. Some of the bystanderspersuaded the boy to scratch her, which he did on the face and the back of thehands, so that the blood came out apace. She stroked the back of her hand onthe child, saying, ‘Take blood enough child, God help you.’ To this, the boy"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling161answered, ‘Pray for yourself. Your prayer can do me no good.’ Here by theway, touching this practice of scratching the witch, though it is commonlyreceived as an approved means to discover the witch and procure ease tothe bewitched, yet, seeing that neither by any natural cause nor supernaturalwarrant of God’s word it has any such virtue given to it, it is to be receivedamongst the witchcrafts, whereof there be great store used in our land tothe great dishonour of God. But to our matter. When Robert Toone, theboy’s uncle and his schoolmaster, saw that Mistress Walkeden could notprevail with this bad woman, they took her aside. After many questions, shegranted that she was in the wood that Saturday which the boy spoke of, andthat she saw no boy but Sherrat’s boy. Further, they demanded of her whenshe received the Communion. She said, ‘twelve months ago.’ And askingwhat she received, she answered, ‘Her damnation.’ They asked her whethershe knew what she said. She answered again, ‘What would I receive but mydamnation?’ They caused her to say The Lord’s Prayer and the Creed, whichshe hurried through with much ado. But when she came to these wordsin The Lord’s Prayer, ‘And lead us not into temptation’, and in the Creedto ‘Jesus Christ,’ ‘the Holy Ghost,’ or ‘the Catholic Church,’ she wouldnot say any of those words. After these examinations, she departed to herown house. The next day he had many sore fits in which, because he wouldclap his hands on his face and shriek pitifully, they asked him the reasonthereof at the end of his fit. He answered that the green cat which he saw hadeyes like flames of fire and that caused him thus fearfully to hide his eyes.And he said that the pain which he endured was very grievous, like beingpricked with daggers or stung by bees, which caused his crying. As thishis vexation moved many that came to see him to shed tears, so did it notalittle grieve his Uncle Toone who, seeing these fits to increase, thoughtit good that the witch was brought before a Justice. And so he went withJesse Bee, on the tenth of April before Master Thomas Graysley, Esquireand Justice of Peace, craving his precept to that purpose. This he grantedand directed it to the Constable of Stapen Hill, to bring both this AliceGooderidge, who was almost sixty years of age, and old Elizabeth Wrightalso, Mother to this Alice, who had been four or five times before him on"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"162Demonic Possession and Exorcismsuspicion of many such crimes. The precept thus granted forth, they werebrought before Master Graysley to whom she would confess nothing, savethat she met a boy, which she thought to be Sherrat’s boy, who had brokenher basket full of eggs, in Abel’s Close and, said she, ‘If my words did himany hurt, I am sorry.’ But that word ‘bell’ she did not remember that sheused. The next morning when the boy would rise, his shirt was knit in diversknots between his legs. And being asked how that came, he said he couldnot tell. All that day he continued in senseless fits, with grievous groaningand fearful screaming, crying out, ‘Look where the witch stands with threewarts on her face.’The next morning, being Saturday about six o’clock, at which time hiskeepers, thinking not the hour of his fits to be come, took no great careof looking to him, he was suddenly thrown under the bed, crying fearfully,‘Flames of fire, flames of fire.’ Forthwith he got on the bed, being fearful andamazed in his countenance. About four o’clock, at which time his fits werewont to leave him, they did now take him in a wonderfully fierce mannertill midnight, with greater extremity than at anytime before. He had seldommore intermission than to vomit and say, as it was his usual manner in mostextremities, ‘The Lord be praised.’ In these fits, he shrieked pitifully andfearfully, desiring them to take away the black cat. Both now and most timeshe made signs of prayer with folded hands, striking on his breast.The fourteenth of April, Sir Humphrey Ferrers and Master Graysleymet at Robert Toone’s, who caused thither to be brought Elizabeth Wrightand Alice Gooderidge, together with her husband and daughter. MasterGraysley, after some questions concerning his fits, commanded that theBible should be delivered into the boy’s hands. He began to read the firstChapter of St John’s Gospel, till he came to the fourth verse. At whichplace, when he read, he was thrown into a most cruel fit. Presently after this,the old woman Elizabeth Wright came into Robert Toone’s house which, assoon as Master Graysley understood, he caused her to be brought into theparlour where the child was. But she was very unwilling to come in, crying,‘Alas that ever I was born. What will I do?’ Master Graysley spoke loudly toher, asking if she could do the boy any good. She answered that her daughter"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling163had that at home with which she would do good. He caused her, with muchado, to look on the boy. As soon as ever she did, he fell into a strange andcruel fit. Lying on his back, his eyes standing staring open in fearful manner,his teeth set in his head, his arms clapped close to his sides, and all the partsof his body quaking very fearfully. Master Graysley had her kneel downand pray for him, which she did, but so as nobody could understand whatshe said. Whilst she prayed, the fit continued. And therefore they thrust herout of doors. This being done, the boy’s fit presently ended. Sir Humphreyand Master Graysley agreed that certain women should search the motherand the daughter severally, to see if they could find any such marks on themas are usually found on witches. They stripped the old woman and foundbehind her right shoulder a thing much like the udder of an ewe that givessuck with two teats like two great warts, the one behind under her armpit,the other a hand’s length off towards the top of her shoulder. When theyhad found these, they put on her clothes again, leaving the place bare, that itmight be seen both of Sir Humphrey, Master Graysley, and divers othersof good worth, as indeed it was. They bade her say The Lord’s Prayer,which she hurried through after her manner, leaving out these words stillunsaid, ‘And lead us not into temptation.’ Being then asked how long shehad those teats, she answered that she was born so. Then did they searchAlice Gooderidge, and found on her belly, a hole of the bigness of twopence, fresh and bloody, as though some great wart had been cut from theplace. The justices examined her concerning the bewitching of the boy, butshe would confess nothing. Then Sir Humphrey took her to the boy, andasked him whether this were she that thus bewitched him. He answered thatit was surely she. Then did Sir Humphrey bid him to scratch her. When theboy offered to do this, his hand was presently benumbed and plucked to hisside. And he was tormented in every part. Four several times he attemptedto do this, but still with like success. He was bidden to lay his hand onthe bystanders, which he did without difficulty. Then they proceeded toexamine her concerning her hurt. She said that she went to fetch a littlemeal on Easter Eve out of the chamber. And coming down on a ladder,her foot slipped and she, having a knife in her hand, thrust herself in the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"164Demonic Possession and Exorcismbelly. They asked the judgement of a surgeon. His answer was that it waslikely to have been so a long time, for it was not festered, and seemed to besucked. Sir Humphrey charged her with witchcraft about one Michael’scow which, when it broke everything that they tied her in, ran to this AliceGooderidge’s house, scraping at the walls and windows to come in. Herold Mother Elizabeth Wright took it on herself to help on condition thatshe might have a penny to bestow on her God. And so she came to theman’s house, knelt down before the cow, crossed her with a stick in theforehead, and prayed to her God, since which time the cow continued well.With this she was urged by the justices, and with the hurt on her belly, howit could be so and her clothes not cut, whereto she made shifting answersto no purpose. Then they put her aside, and examined Oliver Gooderidgeher husband, and her daughter also. They were found to disagree in theirtales concerning the matter. Whereupon Sir Humphrey committed her toDerby Gaol, but dismissed her Mother.The next day, the boy had a very grievous fit in which, lying still a while, hebegan to throw up both his feet suddenly, beating them against the groundwith great vehemency. And at length, being in a trance, he spoke saying, ‘Doyou say you are my God, and that I am your son. Go Satan, there is no Godsave the Lord of hosts.’ Pausing a while, at last, he said again, ‘And wouldyou have me worship a molten calf? I will worship nothing but the LordGod, and him only will I serve.’ Again, being silent awhile, he said, ‘Willyou give me three towns if I will worship you? Go Satan, it is written, I willworship the Lord God only. And do you say that if I will not worship you,you will torment me three times more? If you torment me three hundredtimes, yet can you not touch my soul.’ After this, he was tormented threeseveral times over every part of his body. This being ended, he desired togo to the window to refresh himself, being hot and faint. There he praisedGod for his mercies, telling them that stood by that, if Satan came again,he would ask him many questions and charge him with many things, for heremembered what he had spoken as well as any that was present. Havingthus rested about a quarter of an hour, he was thrown into two several fits,comparable with the former in cruelty. And at the last, he spoke saying,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling165‘I charge you by the living God to tell me who sent you. Do you tell meyour Mistress sent you?

My hope is in theliving God, and he will deliver me out of your hands.’ Having spoken thesewords, he was cast into two several fits like the former which, being ended,he desired the bystanders to join with him in humble and hearty prayer.And so he fell on his knees, praising God that he had somewhat revealedhis enemy Satan to him, and beseeching him to continue his goodness inmanifesting him more plainly. The bystanders asked him what he heard andsaw in the sharp conflicts, for they neither saw nor heard anything but himreplying and answering. He told them that the great cat tossed him up anddown in a string, and that a thing spoke to him with a voice small and shrill.The next day, about nine o’clock, he was cast into a grievous fit and, beingcast on his back, he was bereft of all use of any part of his body. And atlength he spoke, saying, ‘Do you say I am your son? I am none of yours.

At thistime, there came divers worshipful personages on purpose to behold themanner of the child’s so strange vexing. They caused him to read the Bible,which caused Satan to rage, so that he was cast into a fit terribly tormentedand vexed, so that it did much humble the beholders and move them tocommiseration and pity, for the child’s so distressed state. While thesethings happened, it was reported that the old witch Elizabeth Wright was inthe town, a thing somewhat rare. For it is thought that, except at the time ofher former examination, she was not so far in half a year before. Presentlythey sent for her.In the mean time came in master Bagot the younger of Blithfield, wishingto be an eyewitness of these strange reports. He requested the boy to takethe Bible and read. He, being unwilling to read himself, wished Jesse Bee todo as much, which he did. And when he came to the fourth verse of the firstchapter of St John’s Gospel in these words, ‘In it was life and the life wasthe light of the world,’ the boy was thrown into a fit.

Whilst they stripped her, she cursed the day of herbirth, making great outcries and using utter speeches against all that offeredto accuse her. And being asked who brought her to Burton, she said, ‘TheDevil.’ Being asked divers questions she did not like, she would answerthat she did not hear. Much ado they had to get her to come near the boy orto look on him. And it would have been good for him if she had never comeat him.

And whenhe came to the fourth verse, the boy was cast into a fit like to those whichbefore he had on the like occasion.In these his fits, as also in those that he had after, he could neitherconceal what he said nor what Satan said to him. The next morning, he hadtwo fits between eight and twelve o’clock, at which time Master Graysleycame again to see the child. And whilst he was there, there came in twomen of Stapen Hill, near neighbors to Alice Gooderidge, who said theycame from Derby. They were entreated by her to tell Robert Toone that, ifhe would be good to her, she would reveal the whole truth of the matter.And further, they offered him their company thither on Monday, whichwas agreed on by the advice of Master Graysley. But news came that therewas one who, being skilful in discerning of witches had been with AliceGooderidge at Derby, and affirmed flatly that she was a witch, offering tomake open trial of it and to cure the boy. Robert Toone accepting this offervery willingly, a time was appointed for this man’s coming thither. But toreturn to the boy. About eleven o’clock, he had a sore fit, with increase oftorments, groaning very grievously, and shrieking very pitifully. And beingcast on his back with his legs thrown out, as commonly he was, at the last heuttered these words, ‘Do you say that I am your champion? I will be noneof your champion. I am the servant of the Lord of hosts. What, do you offerme a bag of money if I will worship you? Go Satan, I will none of yourmoney. The Lord in Heaven has money enough in store for me. And do yousay that you will torment me twice more grievously than before? Do yourworst Satan, my trust is in the Lord God. Do you say your Mistress will"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168Demonic Possession and Exorcismhave it so? I charge you in the name of the Father, &c., to tell me what yourMistress’s name is. Do you say you will not reveal your Mistress?’ Withthat, Satan tormented him again. This passing with a vomit, his Motherbegan to comfort him, exhorting him to put his trust in God, to whom hesaid, ‘My whole trust is in him. For the Lord has my enemy in a chain,and keeps him in a circle which he will not pass.’ And having remainedwell about half an hour, he was again pitifully tormented. And at the last hespoke these words, ‘Do you say you will give me whatsoever I will ask you,if I will be your champion? I defy you and all that you offer me. I will benone of your champion. I charge you in the name of the living God to tellme what your Mistress’s name is. Do you say that your Mistress has givenyou a drop of her blood for your dinner, and that therefore you will tell notales of her? And do you say my faith is but weak? Satan, it is too strongfor you to overthrow. Do you say you will torment me worse than ever youhave done? Do your worst. My trust is in the Lord my God.’ Forthwith hewas pitifully tormented, after which, being asked what he saw, he answered,‘The green cat,’ as he usually told them, asking angrily, ‘Did not you seeher? Oh,’ said he, ‘This has been a grievous torment to me.’ This ended,being hot and faint with the extremity of his torments, he desired to becarried to the window to take the air. Whilst he sat there, there came inone whose name I’ll pass over in silence. And being a stranger, he beganto examine the boy concerning poetical and other school points. The boywas weary of his company and conference, as indeed he had great reason,being unfit for such an occasion. And he desired to be carried into anotherchamber which was immediately done. But this supposed friend followedhim and renewed his former speeches, uttering also an oath that grievedthe boy exceedingly. The Mother, understanding it, came and asked whatthe stranger said to him that so troubled him, for he wept pitifully. Theparty himself answered before the boy, ‘I spoke no hurt to him.’ ‘No,’ saidthe child, ‘You bade me I should not dissemble, saying that there were nowitches. Also you asked of me if I thought there were a God? God save mefrom such comforters. I pray you all to pray for me that the Lord woulddeliver me from this temptation.’ At the speaking of these words, he was"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling169thrown into a cruel fit which, being ended, that man who thought therewere no witches departed. But Master Eccarshall, the pastor of Burton,being present stayed, still comforting the boy and his sorrowful mother,persuading him that if Satan spoke to him again he should not answer him,because he was a liar. And he endeavoured by his words to make the boybelieve him. These things ended about two o’clock. he remained well tillfour. Then was he thrown into four several fits, one presently after another,the last whereof was most intolerable, coughing and tormenting him verypitifully. It seemed by his looks and gestures that the evil spirit spoke. Butbecause of Master Eccarshall’s advice, he kept a discontented silence, as hetold afterward to his Mother. But she advised him that, if it should speakagain, he should not fear or forbear to answer it. About this time, somemeat was prepared for him. But before he could take it, he was thrown intoacruel fit wherein, after Satan had shown a while his rage, he spoke saying,‘Do you say that I will worship you? I will worship the Lord of hosts only.Icharge you, in the name of the Father, of the Son, &c. to tell me what yourname is. Do you say you will not tell me before tomorrow? You are a liar.Ihave ever found you so, and I will not believe you. Do you say you willtorment me far more grievously than ever you have done? I care not for allthat you can do to me. In the Lord is my trust, who will deliver me when hisgood pleasure is.’ Presently Satan tormented him according to his wontedmanner. After that fit was ended, and he had been quiet a while, Jesse Beepersuaded him to be courageous, to take to himself the shield of faith, andto offer Satan the combat. The child, finding himself strong in the Lord,whose assistance he had before obtained in his former conflicts, agreed tohis motion. So Jesse read the first chapter according to St John till he cameto the ninth verse, ‘That light was the true light,’ &c. At these words, hewas thrown into a marvellously sore fit, which vexed and tormented him inevery part of his body. This being ended, Jesse asked him if he should readagain? The boy answered cheerfully, ‘Read on in God’s name.’ So he readtill he came to the thirteenth verse, ‘Which were born not of blood,’ &c. Atthese words, he was thrown into grievous torments, like the former. Whenthese ended, Jesse asked if he should still read? The boy answered, ‘Proceed"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"170Demonic Possession and Exorcismin the name of God.’ Then read he the fourteenth verse, ‘The same Wordbecame flesh,’ &c. At these words, he was tormented the third time, yet notso vehemently as before. He, proceeding forward, read till he came to theseventeenth verse, ‘The law was given by Moses, grace and truth came byJesus Christ.’ Forthwith, he fell into the fourth fit, the feeblest of any he yethad, Satan no doubt finding his force quailing and his fiery darts quenched.So Jesse read on, the child cheerfully and attentively hearkening, till hehad finished the chapter without any trouble to him. The next day, amongother fits, he had one much more vehement than the rest, his torments beingincreased, and his strength so great that two strong men were not able torule him. After this fit, Jesse Bee said, ‘Come Thomas, will we provokehim to battle?’ The child answered, ‘Yes, very willingly.’ So they lookedfor the Bible. But the boy’s uncle had taken it to the Church. Then did theboy desire Jesse to resolve him in this doubt, whether it were hurtful forone to eat or drink before he receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.Being satisfied concerning this point, and casting down his head to call toremembrance something else whereof he doubted, he was suddenly throwninto a grievous fit, groaning and screaming most pitifully, turning aroundon all fours, like a pig on a spit. And suddenly, do what the keepers could,he leaped up to the top of the bed, catching hold on the testern34with hishands and hanging by his arms, not withstanding his eyes were closed up.And being in this state, he said, ‘Do you say that I shall hear news withinthese two or three days? I pray God it be good news.’ He was at last cast intoatrance, uttering divers such comfortable speeches, as he did in his othertrances. This day there came one to them, having been of her own accordwith widow Worthington, the good witch of Hoppers, as they call her, andtold them, ‘She said that the boy was bewitched. Yet she could not helphim, unless his Mother or some of his nearest friends came to her.’ Thesame answer was given by a witch around Coventry to another, looking forsome help on the boy’s behalf. But the Mother of the child, detesting theDevil’s help, thanked those two for their kindness towards her, but sharplyreproved them for attempting a thing so unlawful. After these fits, he rested34The wooden framework supporting the canopy and curtains."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling171reasonably quietly till the next day, when at about one o’clock, seemingvery well, he received some meat. But Satan showed himself to a be a rightSatan, even a sore enemy to the child, envying the good of his body when hesaw himself unable to hurt his soul. He hindered his digesting of it, as manytimes he did by casting him presently into divers fits, which, like all his fitsusually, lasted about half a quarter of an hour and ended with a vomit. Manythat were beholders of the child’s torments little hoped that he could haveever lived or recovered. But God be praised that Satan’s power is limitedby him who is Lord of both life and death.When these conflicts were ended, Jesse Bee said to him, ‘Thomas, willwe take the sword with two edges, and bid Satan the battle?’35The boy,being well acquainted with the phrase, answered, ‘If you will read, I willgladly hear.’ So he read the first chapter of St John’s Gospel which, whilsthe was reading, the child was thrown into three fits. After these fits, he wasvery cheerful and desirous to have the book so that he might read himself,which he did. And when he came to the fifth verse of the first chapter ofRevelation, for that chapter he read, he was thrown into a cruel fit which,being ended, he gave the book to Jesse Bee, entreating him earnestly to readonward. So Jesse Bee finished the chapter, and read also the second andwas never interrupted in reading them with any more of the boy’s fits.On the twenty first of April, between nine o’clock in the morning andtwo in the afternoon, he had ten fits, yet the last of them was most extreme.In the midst of it, he would open his eyes amazedly and presently clap bothhis hands on them, being thrown into most violent torments throughout allthe parts of his body. And being cast on his back, he threw forth his legsfiercely, beating them against the ground vehemently. And after that, lyingin a quiet trance, he opened his mouth, saying, ‘Do you say that you willgive me a crown, if I will worship you? I regard you not, nor your crown.For the Lord has reserved a crown of righteousness for me in Heaven.’Then, pausing awhile, he spoke again saying, ‘Do you say that you willgive me towns and countries if I will worship you? Away Satan away, youare a liar, and the Father of lies. I will not believe you, away.’ Forthwith,35Revelation2.12."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"172Demonic Possession and Exorcismhis mouth was closed up, and his teeth set fast in his head, inasmuch thathe laboured to open them with his own hands. But he could not. Yet whenhe had remained a while thus, the Lord, by his almighty power, opened hismouth, and he boldly said, ‘I charge you, Satan, in the name of the Fatherand of the Son.’At this word, his mouth was fast closed again. Yet was it not long beforethe Lord, by his power, opened it again. So he proceeded, saying, ‘I chargeyou, tell me what is your Mistress’s name? Do you say that you will not?And do you say you will torment me ten times more?’ No sooner were thesewords spoken, but he was tormented above measure. Next day between tenand one o’clock, he had two ordinary fits, and at the end of these, oneextraordinary in which, being thrown on his back, with his accustomedtorments, he uttered these words, ‘Would you have me worship you, youliar, you wicked wretch? You are the Father of all lies. I charge you, getaway from me, away, away.’ These words he uttered disdainfully, shakinghis hands at him. And after he had paused a while, he said, ‘Do you promiseme all my desire, if I will worship you? Ah, wicked tempter, I charge youin the name of the Father,’ &c., ‘to tell me your Mistress’s name.’ Thesewords he uttered with an interrupted voice, but repeated them presentlyvery courageously, saying also, ‘And do you say that your Mistress hasgiven you a draught of her blood? I am glad of it, for then will I know hershortly. And do you say you will torment me twice more?’ At these words,he was cast into two sore fits, so that Satan kept his promise to him. Historments caused him to scream very loudly and groan pitifully, flinging outhis hands as though he fought with Satan, and stamping fiercely as if he trodhim under foot. This combat ended, he lay still about a quarter of an hour.And then, having been a while tormented lying on his back, he said, ‘Do yousay that, because I vex your Mistress, you will torment me more?’ Thesewords being spoke, he was cast into such torments as were grievous to thebeholders. And having overcome the extremity of the same, he spoke, withhis eyes shut saying, ‘What, do you say that I will worship you? You have nofaith Satan. I will fight with you with the word of the everliving God. Away,away, I charge you in God’s name to get you hence.’ Again, after more fits,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling173he said, ‘What, do you say that you will make me as strong as a giant andas rich as the greatest potentate in the world, if I will worship you? TheLord my God can make me strong, and give me all good things.’ Havingpaused a little, he spoke again saying, ‘Do you say, if I will not worshipyou, you will make me a four-footed beast? That lies not in your power,since God has made me a reasonable creature. My faith, Satan, is strong.And do you say that you will torment me grievously for your Mistress’ssake?’ Forthwith he was grievously tormented, crying out, ‘A bear, a bear.’His mouth was stretched out, and he roared fiercely like a bear, crying out,‘He tears me, he tears me.’ These torments ended, he lay amazedly, withthe sweat running down his face. Being again tormented, he spoke saying,‘Will you give me a land full of all fruits if I will worship you? The Lord inHeaven has goods enough for me. You did send a bear, your Hell houndto torment me. You did tell me that I should hear news within two or threedays. Do you say your Mistress has commanded you not to be an hourfrom tormenting me, because I vex her? Is that your news?’ At these words,he was presently cast into grievous torments, staring amazedly and cryingout, ‘Flames of fire, flames of consuming fire.’ He threw away all thingshe could find by groping, for his eyes were shut, and wound himself upclosely in the bed clothes. Scarcely had these torments an end, but othersbegan wherein, being grievously afflicted, he cried out, ‘A fiery dragon, afiery dragon.’ These torments continuing, he said, ‘Now you foul fiend, nowyou show yourself in your likeness.’ Presently he struck both his handson his face, shrieking and crying fearfully, ‘A fly, a fly.’ Being asked whathe had seen in these conflicts, he answered, ‘Many and fearful things.’ Buthe remembered them not, neither could he tell that he spoke, though hecalled to mind a thing spoke to him. The twenty fourth day, about eleveno’clock, he fell into an extreme fit, which shook him pitifully in all parts ofhis body, making him roar like a bear. Being asked after the fit what he hadseen, he answered that a great bear came roaring on him. Four fits more hehad before four o’clock, at which time Master Edward Cockin came intothe house and, finding him well, bade him read the twelfth of John, whichhe did till he came to the fifteenth verse, ‘I am glad for your sakes that,’ &c."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"174Demonic Possession and ExorcismAnd then was he cast into a fit presently. On this, there came in anotherdesiring to see the like trial. So the boy read till he came to the twenty fifthverse, ‘I am the resurrection,’ &c., at which words he was again thrown. Thisdesire that many had to have the boy read that they might see him in his fits,savoured but of a tempting curiosity, and is not acceptable. But to go on.The boy’s torments continuing, Robert Toone was altogether without hopeof his recovery, both because the witch confessed nothing and the man thatpromised help failed, whereat he grieved exceedingly. Many persuaded himto send divers witches, which he refused. But his wife purposed to attemptit, and sent for a messenger who had before been employed by others inthe like business. He found the boy in a fit when he came, and thereuponuttered these words, ‘Who would allow him to lie thus, and not seek anyhelp he could get?’ Whereunto, an honest man, not acquainted with theirpurpose, answered, ‘To seek help from a witch is wicked and dangerous.’The messenger was pricked in conscience with his speech, and would notgo. Robert Toone was not a little glad they were stopped in so unlawful anenterprise. This day also, unknown to the boy’s friends, another had beenwith widow Worthington, the witch of Hoppers, and brought this answerthat, unless the boy and his friends believed her, she could do him no good,which they detested.The twenty sixth of April, after nine fits in the morning, about one o’clock,he was thrown into a very sore fit, and in the same was grievously vexed andtormented. At the last, he spoke thus, ‘What do you say? If I will worshipyou, you will make me a God, but if I will not, you will make me a toad? Itlies not in your power, Satan, to make me what you wish, but in the powerof my Creator. And do you say you will torment me twice? Do your worst,the Lord is my trust, and I know he can and will deliver me.’ Being thensuddenly tormented, he did struggle most fiercely, roaring fearfully like abear crying, ‘A bear, a bear,’ and by and by, ‘A dragon, a dragon.’ After this,he was quiet about a quarter of an hour. And then suddenly, he fell into thelike torments, and spoke as before saying, ‘Do you say that you have broughtme good news? I pray God it be. And do you say that if I will curse God,you will release me from all my pains and torments? What Satan, would you"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling175have me curse my Creator, who spared not to send his only begotten SonJesus Christ out of his bosom to shed his most precious blood for my sins.Ah, wicked tempter, I charge you in the name of the Father, the Son, andthe Holy Ghost, to tell me what is your Mistress’s name? Do you say thatyour Mistress has rewarded you, and therefore you will torment me morethan ever you did? I care not a straw for you. What, Satan, do not seek toinsult in your subtle cruelties. For the Lord will release me from you whenhis good will and pleasure is.’ And so, with some more torments, this fitended.The next day he that promised to cure the boy came to prove her, whowas had in suspicion, plainly to be a witch. He wished Robert Toone only toprocure him a warrant to fetch her from the Gaol promising, since he hatedall conjuration and enchantment, that it should be manifest what course hetook for effecting those matters. This day and both the next he had manysore fits. On the last of April, between nine and three in the afternoon, hehad fourteen fits. At this time, the witch’s liberty being procured, she cameto town, and was brought to the boy, to whom she said, ‘God help youmy child.’ Whereupon he was presently cast into most strange torments,differing both in manner and cruelty from the former. Three strong mencould hardly hold him, he was so strong. He shrieked pitifully, stickingout his tongue, and having his neck so twisted that his face seemed to standbackward. This pitiful spectacle did wring many tears from the beholders. Sofrom three till nine at night, he had twenty seven of these torments, and thenthey left him quaking and marvellously dismayed. These fits being laid to thewitch’s charge, she answered that she indeed did vex the child, but if theywould forgive her, it would cease. Two or three went to Stapen-Hill to seewhat the old woman did this while, suspecting she had a hand herein. Whenthey came there, they found her on her knees praying, no doubt, to the Devil.On the first of May, about seven in the morning, he was cast into a fit. Thiswas the day wherein the cunning man would make the witch confess, and aweek after cure the boy. So he sent for her from the Town Hall to RobertToone’s, where many worshipful personages were ready to see proof ofhis skill. Being brought, they laboured to make her confess voluntarily,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176Demonic Possession and Exorcismto whom she answered that this was the first that she ever committed, and ifthey would procure her liberty, she offered to confess all the truth freely.Presently her speech was interrupted so that she could not speak. But sheprayed them to forgive her. Then the man, seeing this would not prevail,began to test his conclusion. He put a pair of new shoes on her feet, settingher close to the fire till the shoes, being extremely hot, forced her throughincrease of the pain to confess. This was his ridiculous practice. She, beingthoroughly heated, desired a release and she would disclose all, whichgranted, she confessed nothing. Being therefore threatened more sharply,she offered to reveal all privately to Mistress Dethicke. And going withher into a parlour, when she began to speak, her wind was stopped, so thatshe could not say anything but, ‘I pray you, forgive me.’ By this time, itwas eleven o’clock, and the boy had had eight fits, and was brought into theparlour where she was. She said, ‘Thomas, I pray you forgive me, and begood to me.’ At which words, he fell into a marvellously sore fit. After this,the company continued threatening and persuading her. But all she wouldsay was that she was sorry for him for she mistook him, thinking him to bethe Sherrats’ boy, and thinking to have been revenged on him for breakingher eggs. When they saw that they could prevail no more, they sent her againto the Hall. And the company departed, after which the boy had eight fits.The next morning Jerome Horabin, Edward Weightman, and MistressCaldwall went with others to hear what confession she would make. At theircoming she spoke thus, ‘I met the boy in the wood the first Saturday in Lentand, passing by me, he called me witch of Stapen Hill. I said to him, “everyboy does call me witch, but did I ever make your arse to itch?”’ Further shesaid, ‘I pray you, get help for the boy. For God’s sake, get help for the boy.’Again she said, ‘God give me grace to confess the truth.’ And when shewould have spoken more, she said, ‘I cannot, I cannot, my wind is stopped.’Mistress Caldwall asked her if she would be prayed for. ‘Yes,’ said she,‘I pray you desire Master Eccarshall to pray for me that the Lord would openmy heart so that I may speak the truth.’ The third of May, in the morning,Robert Toone, Edward Weightman, Richard Teate, and others went againto examine the witch. She confessed to them saying, ‘The first Saturday in"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling177Lent toward evening, I met the boy in the wood, and he called me witch ofStapen Hill. And I said again, “Every boy does call me witch, but did I evermake your arse to itch?” Forthwith, I stooped to the ground, and the Devilappeared to me in likeness of a little spotted dog, red and white, and I calledhim Minny. Seeing that every boy calls me witch, therefore go your ways andtorment this boy in every part of his body at your own pleasure. Forthwith,Istrained every part of my body, forcing my self to vomit, saying in thismanner, “Vex every part of him.” ‘Further,’ said she, ‘The dog followed theboy to Burton. And as I returned from Winfell, whither I went to buy agroat’s worth of eggs, he met me again telling me he had fulfilled my request.And at my yard’s end he departed from me, since when he has been diverstimes with me at Derby Gaol, and these two nights at Burton Hall. Andcontinually he scratches my head and scrapes in the straw.’ Again she said,‘The boy will not mend unless you seek for help. You may have help enough.’She would have spoken further, but something stopped her throat. Andshe said, ‘Come out you foul serpent.’ From eight till twelve, the boy hadtwelve sore fits with pitiful groaning. At three, came Master Hildersham ofAshby de la Zouche with divers other godly ministers. After having madetrial of the boy’s faith by certain questions, Master Hildersham said openlythat, howsoever the Papists boasted much of the power their priests had tocast out devils, and the simple everywhere noted it as a great discredit to theministers of the Gospel that they do lack this power, yet did he profess thatthere was no such gift in them, and that though the Lord oft in these days,by the prayers of the faithful, cast out devils, yet could he not assure themto cure him. To hold this faith of miracles to remain still in the churchis an opinion dangerous. That seeing to be possessed is but a temporalcorrection, and such as whereby both the glory of God and the salvationof the party may be furthered, it can not without sin be absolutely prayedagainst. All which notwithstanding, he said that there is a good use of prayerin such a case, and of fasting also, to procure that the judgement may besanctified to the beholders, and the possessed himself, yea to obtain that hemay be delivered also from it, if the Lord see it be best for his own glory.In which persuasion, he being the mouth of the rest, they all prayed, during"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"178Demonic Possession and Exorcismwhich time the child was not interrupted. Whereas Alice Gooderidge saidher familiar was like one William Gregory’s dog of Stapen Hill, there arosearumour that his dog was her familiar. Wherefore he,36with his neighbourMaster Cox, went the next day to examine her concerning this report.And she said, ‘My Devil, I say, was like your dog.’ ‘Now out upon you,’said Gregory, and departed. She, being further examined, said that she hadher familiar from her Mother. On the sixth of May, he had twelve fits inthe forenoon, and ten in the afternoon. These last were as grievous as anybefore. After one of them there took the chamber pot, he started suddenlysaying, ‘Look where a man comes out of the chamber pot.’ In another fithe cried out, ‘Flames of fire, flames of fire.’ And in another, he said, ‘I seethe heavens open.’ In most of these fits he stuck out his tongue which wasvery black, having his face twisted towards his back, groaning and shriekinglamentably. Being asked if he remembered what was done, he said that itseemed to him that he was wrung and tossed up and down. After these fits,he remained well till next morning. On Friday he was, by seven o’clock,cast into a fit. But about eight, he fell into marvellously strange torments,both for continuance and extraordinary cruelty, his tongue thrust out of hishead, his mouth drawn awry, first toward one ear, then to another; his facevery strangely disfigured. In his extremity, he made signs to the bystandersto pray, and he, by folded hands and other gestures, gave testimony that theSpirit of God was mightily labouring against his infirmities.By and by, his eyes opened. And whatever he caught, he, as it seemed,threw it against Satan. And straightaway his eyes were shut up again, sothat he could not open them with his fingers, which he tried to do. Hismouth was opened, and he said, ‘Oh pray, pray, never more need to pray.’So the company joined in humble and hearty prayer. But he, hearing themnot, though they prayed loudly, said, ‘Why do you not pray?’ Presently hismouth being shut and his teeth set fast in his head, he stamped, as it were,in triumph of Satan. And lifting his hands towards Heaven, he struck themwith reverence on his breast. Satan’s raging against him did increase in such36William Gregory."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling179amanner as caused the beholders to shed tears abundantly. For they couldno sooner imagine a ceasing, but straightaway his fit began again. And thisconflict lasted long, in which time he often uttered these words, ‘Do whatyou can, Satan. This will do you no good. Is it so?’ And such like. And afterobtaining the use of his tongue, he proceeded saying, ‘Away, Satan. I haveon my head the helmet of salvation, and I am girded about with truth. JesusChrist has shed water and blood for my sins, and I sweat but water. O Lord,your apostles were whipped and scourged for your truth, and they departed,rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer for your name’s sake.And now, O Lord, I rejoice that you account me worthy to suffer thesecruel torments.’ Presently, he fell into torment again. At the last, lying onhis back quietly, he desired the bystanders to sing the sixth Psalm. And sothey did, he singing with them very cheerfully. While they were singing, hewas often interrupted and joined with them again toward the end, havinglain in a trance, so that they could scarcely perceive any motion. He said, ‘Isee the Heavens open. Hearken, I hear a heavenly noise.’ And lying still awhile, he met with them at the tenth verse, ‘And now my foes.’ ‘That,’ saidhe, ‘is Satan.’ And so he continued singing till the psalm was ended. Allthe psalm through, he sweated exceedingly, and dried his face as if he hadnot been in his fit. After this, he desired them to pray for him whilst he laydown and slept, and so fell into a trance. Having lain still a while, he fell toquaking and starting fearfully saying, ‘Do you say my sins are great, Satan?The Lamb of God has taken them away.’ Divers other interrupted speecheshe uttered, and slumbered again. At length, he cried out, ‘Wild horses, wildhorses, they tear me, they tear me.’ And then was he tormented over all theparts of his body. After that, he slept somewhat slumberingly, having a mostheavenly and joyful vision. When he awoke, he looked cheerfully. And beingasked what he saw in these trances, he could not call anything to mind.This day, he was cast into seven cruel fits exceeding all he had before. Forbesides his mouth being drawn awry, and he in every part vexed, his shoul-der bones were thrust out of joint, with other torments most lamentable.Thus they ended, for he remained till eleven o’clock grievously vexed, andalmost without intermission. In these his torments, being for the most"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"180Demonic Possession and Exorcismpart senseless, he used to utter divers interrupted speeches, some fearful,others comfortable, the bystanders being requested by him to sing psalmsand pray. Many times he had his ears shut and his mouth stopped, so thathe could neither hear nor speak. Yet he would join with them in prayer andsinging as long as he could without interruption. When he was fully recov-ered, he looked very cheerful, giving God thanks for his assistance. Theyasked him many questions concerning his trances, but he could remembernothing that was done. On the nineteenth day of May, he fell into trancesmixed with torments in which, as he suffered grievous pains, so did he uttermany strange speeches. Sometimes he was so writhed, that no beholderthought it possible for him to live. Sometimes he lay so still, that therescarce appeared any sign of life in him. After he had lain a while in a trancehe said, ‘My Saviour Christ Jesus was tempted, and why then should notIbeso?’ Pausing a while he said, ‘I hear a voice from Heaven. The Lordspeak to me.’ And pausing again, he held up his hands, his eyes being fastclosed, and said, ‘Look where my brother Job is.’ Then he opened his eyes,but his mouth was fast shut. He would have opened it with his hands, butcould not. Then pausing a little, he said, ‘No, no, I will not. The Lord hasflatly forbidden it in his word.’ So lying a while he said, ‘Heaven opens,Heaven opens. I must go thither.’ Then, clapping his hands for joy he said,‘I see Christ Jesus my Saviour. His face shines like the sun in its strength.Iwill go salute him.’ And indeed he did rise, going apace with such strengththat his keepers could scarcely hold him. Presently, he began tremblingand stamping, crying, ‘A dog, a dog, for God’s sake, take away this dog.Away with this filthy dog that came out of Hell.’ And after a pitiful scream-ing, he said, ‘O Master Hildersham, I thought he would have torn me inpieces. Preach judgement against all sinners, flames of fire, flames of fire.See Master Hildersham, preach and teach. Oh, fast and pray night andday.’ After these speeches, he clapped his hands, looking cheerful, thoughhis eyes were closed, saying, ‘Christ Jesus my Saviour comes clothed inpurple.’ Then he seemed, by his gestures, to embrace him, saying, ‘Holy isyour name. Your name, Lord Jesus, is to be exalted for evermore. I have seensuch sights. O Lord Jesus bless me from them.’ Presently he was overtaken"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling181again with fear, saying, ‘Do you say this is the bottomless pit where thedamned be? Master Hildersham, we have need to pray. Oh, preach andpray.’ Straightaway after he looked cheerful, even pleased, saying, ‘Yourname, O Lord Jesus, is to be exalted above all things. Your name is to beblessed for ever.’ Lying a while in a trance, he clapped his hands saying, ‘O,O, Christ Jesus my Saviour and his apostles.’ Then seemed he to embracethe apostles, and worship our Saviour saying, ‘O Lord Jesus, you sufferfor my sake. Your name be praised. Yea, I say from my heart, your namebe praised.’ By and by, turning his head, he pointed saying, ‘Look whereJudas is frying in torments.’ After this he fell again into a trance, and layas if he were dead. But he spoke fearfully thus, ‘Ah, look in this place oftorments where drunkards are hanged by the throats, swearers and filthytalkers by their tongues.’ And having spoken of other torments for othersins, he said, ‘Oh great judgements, great judgements,’ which words heuttered as woefully as if he had been in the jaws of Hell, and the contraryas comfortably as if he had been in Heaven. After this, falling into a trance,he started suddenly and said, ‘Yonder comes Mother Red Cap. Look howthey beat her brains out. See what it is to be a witch. See how the toads gnawthe flesh from her bones. Oh pray, pray, look what wailing, and weeping,and gnashing of teeth yonder is. Lord show us your mercy. Take me by thehand Master Hildersham, and let us go to Heaven.’ Thus, this fit endedafter half an hour. Being asked what he had been doing, he answered, hehad been sleeping for he remembered nothing. Having been well about aquarter of an hour, he fell into a quiet trance, and at length said, ‘O MasterHildersham, look where God’s chariot is come to fetch you and me.’ Seehow God loves us. By and by, he began to quake, and cried, ‘Lo, lo, thegreen cat comes out of Hell.’ Then falling into a quiet trance, he said, ‘Lookwhere the seven churches be,’37and presently he screeched saying, ‘Lo, lo,seven ugly devils. Look, they go down to the bottomless pit.’ Pausing againhe says, ‘See how many kings and rich men go to Hell, even they that wereso brave, and fared so daintily, and were so strong.’ After this, he fell into a37The reference is to the seven churches in Asia to whom the Book of Revelation is addressed. SeeRevelation1.4."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"182Demonic Possession and Exorcismtrance saying, ‘Come Master Hildersham, the Lord bids us come. Let usgo.’ And so he went on, and could hardly be stopped. But straightaway hisjoy turned into heaviness, for he seemed to have bodily combats with hisspiritual enemy. These fits ended, he remained well a quarter of an hour.Then falling into a sudden trance, he said with trembling, ‘Ha, ha, ha, Itold you of this before, that after joy comes sorrow. Look you how I amtormented. Oh that I could see my Saviour Christ Jesus.’ Forthwith hearose, clapping his hands with great joy, and said, ‘Look where he comes,your name be praised, your name be praised.’ Anon, he had a comfortablevision of the day of judgement, crying aloud, ‘The trumpets sound. See, see,the graves open. The dead arise, and all men come to judgement. Hark howthe angels cry, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.”’ Then pausing alittle, he said, ‘Look, look how the wicked fly away like a flock of doves.Yet see, a flame of fire overtakes them.’ After much variety of fits he cried,‘A fiery Dragon, a fiery Dragon tears me in pieces. Oh, he tears me, hetears me.’ And with these torments, this fit ended between twelve and one.About three, he fell into a trance and torments like the former. For, afterhe had spoken fearfully of the torments of the damned, he burst into pitifulspeeches. Quaking, he said, ‘Look where seven devils are. Look where aroaring lion is.’ Then he fell into a quiet trance and forthwith clapped hishands, saying, ‘I see a milk white dove flying towards me. See where mySaviour comes. His face shines like the sun.’ These words uttered, he wasagain terrified. And so with some more torments and trances this fit ended.The two days following, he had many fits and some trances, uttering the likespeeches as before. The twelfth of May, he was removed from his uncleMaster Saunders’ house at Caldwell being three miles distant, where hehad six fits. From the thirteenth to the twenty third, he was handled afterhis accustomed manner. The twenty third of May, he was cast into eighteenfits, worse than the former. For his shoulder bones were thrust out of joint,his mouth drawn awry. And amongst other complaints, he cried out abouthis legs, saying that they thrust pins into them. And this is worth the obser-vation, that commonly, on the Sabbath, when the boy was remembered byprayer in godly assemblies, Satan did show his most extreme cruelty. The"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling183twenty fourth and twenty fifth, he was tormented much like the day before.The twenty sixth, he was assaulted more fiercely, both in respect of thenumber and quality of his fits and torments. In these, he did oftentimes cryout saying, ‘Look where Satan comes from under the bed.’ And oftentimes,‘Thunder, thunder, lightning, lightning, flames of fire, flames of consumingfire, a bear, a bear, a dragon, a dragon. Look where Satan comes down thechimney. Look, look, for God’s sake, take me from him.’ And thus, in theseterrible fits, this day passed. The next day, there came one John Darrell, afaithful preacher of the Word, to him. Seeing him in divers of his fits, heassured his friends and him that he was possessed with an unclean spirittelling him, out of St James chapter four, verse seven, that the only wayfor his deliverance was to resist Satan in which, if he failed, he would sinagainst God because it was a breach of a commandment, ‘Resist the Devil,’&c. He told him that, for his further encouragement, he had a promise ofvictory, in that it is said, he will or shall flee, that by the Devil is not to beunderstood only the temptations of the Devil, but even Satan’s very person.And proceeding to confirm the child’s faith in this resistance, he afterwardsexhorted his parents and the whole family to prepare themselves againstthe next day for that holy exercise of prayer and fasting alleging, to put byall doubts, the words of Christ, ‘This kind goes not out but by prayer andfasting.’38Whereto, they being very willing, importuned John Darrell forhis presence and assistance. To which he answered, his assistance in prayerand fasting they should have, but not his presence, as well to avoid noteof vainglory, as also that he saw no such necessity by reason of the child’sstern faith. Nevertheless, giving them order for their exercise, appointingthem the help of a book calledThe Enemy of Security,39and puttingthem in good comfort, he foretold them what interruptions were likely tofollow by the enemy’s rage. And, says he, ‘When you will see these thingscome to pass,’ which indeed fell out accordingly, ‘then know for certainas he is possessed,’ which his friends at Caldwell stood in doubt of, ‘solook that deliverance is at the door, and therefore faint not in the mid-way.’38Mark9.29.39Icannot identify this work."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184Demonic Possession and ExorcismThus he departed. The next day, the family with some others in the fear ofGod being together, the holy exercise of prayer and fasting was taken inhand. And after some prayer was used for the assistance of God’s Spirit andprayer for the remission of sins, he was very grievously and often tormentedand, as a result of his fits and torments, much interrupted therein, spendingmuch time about the same. A prayer against the temptations of Satan wasused. And in the beginning thereof, he was presently taken with a dumb fit.And coming to himself, he began to pray again. And his fits came again andagain, as often as he came to any substantial point. After a while, he fellinto a trance. And at length, a small voice came from him saying, ‘BrotherGlassap, we cannot prevail, his faith is so strong. And they fast and pray,and a preacher prays as fast as they.’ After these words, he fell into a fit,and so into a trance, a voice being heard from him, big and hollow saying,‘Brother Radulphus, I will go to my Master Belzebub, and he will doubletheir tongues.’ Then beginning again to pray, he fell into a fit, and after intoatrance. Afterward, coming to himself, he pointed towards the chimney,saying, ‘Lo where Belzebub stands, and the witch by him. I charge you in thename of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost to tell me whether thisbe she that did bewitch me or no? Do you say it was she? Now the Lord, Ibeseech him, forgive her, and I forgive her.’ Further he said, ‘I charge you inthe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost to get you from me,and come no more at me. For it is written, “Resist the Devil, and he will flyfrom you.”’40And presently he said, ‘He is gone, he is gone.’ Then prayedhe again, and at the third word was thrown into a fit and a trance, wherein avoice was heard from him, his mouth being wide open, as still it was whenthese voices were uttered, saying, ‘Radulphus, Belzebub can do no good.His head is struck off with a word. But I will go fetch the flying eagle andhis flock.’ Presently after these words, he fell into another fit and a tranceand, lying so said, ‘I see an angel in the window like a milk white dove, sentfrom the Lord to be with me to comfort and assist us. But that is nothingin respect of the Lord himself.’40James4.7."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling185Then, beginning to pray again, he fell into a fit and a trance, in which oneof the old voices was heard from him, saying, ‘We cannot prevail. Let usgo out of him, and enter into some of these here.’ This voice came twice,and it made the bystanders afraid. Then, reading again, he fell into a trance.And the former voice was heard from him, speaking very hollowly, as boththose unnatural voices not uttered by himself were, and saying, ‘I wouldthey were all gone but one that is among them, and then we would do wellenough.’Then he read again and, being cast into a trance, one of those voices washeard, saying, ‘There is a woman earnestly at prayer. Get her away.’ One inthe company called John Alsop answered aloud and said, ‘We cannot spareher.’ Yet did none of them all that were there know that she was prayingtill, looking back, they saw her earnestly at prayer in a corner, being behindthem.Beginning again to read, he was suddenly cast into a trance. And a voice washeard which said, ‘He will be tormented till tomorrow at night, do God andyou what you can.’ But Satan was proved a liar. Recovering and reading again,he was again snatched into his trance. The voice was heard again, saying, ‘Wecannot prevail, we cannot prevail, their Church increases.’ At which time,two came in to join in prayer with the company. After this, reading again,he fell into a trance. And a voice was heard from him saying, ‘Here comesone of my people.’ With that they looked back, and were aware of a man ofbad life coming into the parlour. And although the boy was in his fit, yet hemade signs with his hand to the company to get him away, which one of themperceiving did so. Presently he awoke and read. And he was interrupted byatrance, wherein a voice said, ‘Tear the book, tear the book.’ And with that,although his eyes were closed, he snatched at the book which one had in hishand and tore out one leaf from it. He also attempted this in every one of hisfits from that time till two o’clock. And being restrained, by reason that oneheld the book and another his hands, he would bite, strike and spurn themwith his feet at the beginning of his fits, wherein he was far stronger thanhe was wont, and his torments more exceeding in greatness and number.Between eight in the morning and two in the afternoon, his countenance"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"186Demonic Possession and Exorcismwas strangely disfigured, his mouth set wide open, and sometimes drawnawry, his face turned backward, and his arms and shoulders thrust out ofjoint. In this time he had one fit and trance, wherein a voice said, ‘We cannotprevail, for they will not be assisted by witches. Brother Radulphus, wecannot prevail. Let us go to our Mistress and torment her. I have had adraught of her blood today.’ Forthwith it ceased, and straightaway he was inatrance again. And a small voice was heard saying, ‘I will stop your mouth.Iwill stop your mouth.’ At which instant, he was so stopped in his throat thatthe company thought he had been strangled. In another fit, a voice said, ‘Yourprayers do not prevail. They are not heard.’ Whereunto Master Rampan, theschoolmaster of Burton, replied, ‘You are a liar of Satan, for it is written,“Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I inthe midst of them,”’ &c.41About two o’clock, he had a marvellously strangefit, tormenting him most pitifully, in the end whereof he strained to vomitwith great vehemency, and got up some phlegm and bile. At which time, ifhe were possessed with two spirits, as it is probable he was, one of themwent out of him. So from two till four, his fits continued but decreasingin strength, and being without speech. About three, the company perceivedhim to be faint. They persuaded him to eat something to refresh him, whichhe did, having touched neither meat nor drink all the whole day before. Butbefore and after his meat, he said The Lord’s Prayer, and other prayers inthe book, which before he had attempted to read and could not, without anyinterruption. About six o’clock, being carried on his keeper’s back, for hehad no use of his legs from three months before, his fit came on him verysuddenly, and he cried out like a bear. The bystanders betook themselvesto prayer. During this fit, he had many miserable torments, causing him toroar and shriek extremely. On the day of his deliverance, he had many suchsenseless trances that yielded no sign of life, save that his heart might bediscerned to pant a little. At last, being laid on his bed, anon he began toheave and lift vehemently at his stomach and, getting up some phlegm andbile, pointing with his finger and following with his eyes, he said, ‘Look,41Matthew18.20."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling187look, see you not the mouse that is gone out of my mouth,’ and so pointedafter it to the furthest part of the parlour. Then he fell into a quiet trance.When this ended, he was well till seven o’clock, at which time he and two orthree more went to supper. And as he was sat at the table, he fell into a tranceand was thence carried to bed. As he lay there, a voice was heard saying, ‘Myson, rise up and walk. The evil spirit is gone from you. Arise and walk.’ Onthis happening, his keeper said, ‘Let us see if he can walk with our help.’ Buthe answered, ‘No, I can go by myself, I thank God.’ And so, standing onhis feet, he went presently forward without any difficulty. And consideringwith himself this blessed change of his miserable estate, of his own accord,he fell flat on the ground, giving God thanks for his wonderful deliverance,and that in such an excellent manner as was to be admired in a child. Butno doubt, the same Spirit which armed him with faith and patience in thetime of his torments, instructed him how to give thanks and pray. Beingthus fully recovered, he went presently into the town that it might appearwhat Jesus had done for him to the praise of his glory and admiration ofthose that had been acquainted with his marvellous visitation.The next morning, Robert Toone went to the Gaol and demanded ofthe witch how she did. ‘O Master,’ said she, ‘never worse. For I have hadsuch an ague this night that I had thought my joints would have been tornasunder.’ They that dwelt by the prison could not sleep for the noise thatwas there that night. So it is likely that the Devil was as good as his word,when he said he would torment her.After he was thus marvellously delivered, he stayed the next day atCaldwell, and from thence went to his Grandfather’s, Master Walkeden’s,at Clifton. There the aforesaid John Darrell repaired to him, and counselledhim to be now most heedful lest the unclean spirit, returning and his heartempty of faith, bring seven worse than himself with him as our Saviourexpresses, assuring him that Satan would strive to repossess him.John Darrell departing, the boy dwelt at Clifton till the fifth of June,which day he returned to Burton. There, the sixth day being the Sabbath andthe seventh, he spent in religious exercise. The eighth, he went to school,from whence Satan had long kept him. In the afternoon sitting at his book,"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"188Demonic Possession and Exorcismhe said to his fellows, ‘If you will go with me into the churchyard, I will showyou a strange thing.’ Whereupon they went into the school porch, whichtheir Master did not mind because they had their books in their hands,where, after he had walked a while, he sat down and said he was weary. Andpresently, he complained of one of his legs, even crying out. His Masterhearing this, came to him. And remembering his former trials, he prayed,moving the child to say after him, ‘O Lord, for Jesus Christ’s sake, havemercy on me.’ But mostly he cried, ‘Oh, my legs, my legs.’ Here is to benoted that, however Satan grievously assaulted him, yet did he not oncetorment him, because he was not as before in him, which also some of theboy’s words confirmed.Being brought home to his uncle’s with many following and flocking afterhim, he groaned pitifully, crying also, ‘Daggers, daggers.’ And at length hesaid, with a fearful countenance, ‘I am afraid of Satan.’ The company didencourage and comfort him against such temptations, persuading him toprayer. This he performed with great difficulty, crying as before, ‘Oh, mylegs. Oh, my legs.’ They urged him to pray. He pointed with his finger,saying, ‘What woman is that which stands there?’ Still they urged him withprayer. And while they expected it, he said, ‘What a thundering is here? Icannot abide this thundering.’ Then he fell into a trance and, having lain awhile, a voice was heard from him saying, ‘He fell a little and I caught him.’By and by awaking, he rose up amazedly and said, ‘Where am I? I was just nowin the school.’ But they told him what had happened. So he came down fromhis bed and, seeing himself well, he prayed and read a chapter quietly. And sohe remained well all that night. The next morning, the boy’s uncle thoughtit very convenient to labour by prayer to remove this heavy displeasure ofGod, and the danger of these temptations wherewith the boy began again tobe assaulted. And to that end, he sent for two of his neighbours, and spent anhour in prayer and reading the Scriptures. At last, as the boy was reading, hestopped, saying, ‘What woman is that which stands there?’ They persuadedhim to go on and not regard the illusions of Satan. So he read on and waspresently cast into a trance. And after he had lain a while, he said, ‘Behold Isee a Lamb, hark what the Lamb says. “You did fall and he caught you. Fear"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The story of Thomas Darling189not, the Lord is your buckler and defender.”’ After this, he read on and,within a little time, fell again into a quiet trance, saying, ‘Do you say thatif I will worship you, you will make me understand the secrets of all men’shearts? Away Satan, it is hidden from you. The Lord only is the searcher ofthe hearts and reins.’ Then did he read again. And forthwith, he was cast intoatrance. ‘What fair woman is this that is so gorgeously apparelled? Do yousay that you will give her to me if I will worship you? Away Satan. I neithercare for her nor you. The Lord is my comfort, and him only will I worship.the Lamb and the Dove desire not to be worshipped, but you always desireworship.’ Again he read and fell into a trance, saying, ‘Do you say that ifIwill swear an oath you will give me a hundred pounds? Away Satan. Wouldyou have me take God’s name in vain? I will not.’ He read again and, at thethird word, was snatched into his trance, saying, ‘Would you give me a bagfull of gold and silver, if I will never read nor pray to God any more? AwaySatan. I neither regard your gold nor silver. The Lord and his Word is betterto me than all the gold and silver in the world.’They offered him the book again. And he falls presently into a trance,saying, ‘Would you have me tear the book? I will not tear it, do what youcan. Will you tear him in pieces that continues reading?’ He meant RichardTeate, who read on when the boy was interrupted. ‘Satan, you cannot touchhim. The Lord will not allow you to hurt a hair of his head.’ Straight afterthese words, he was snatched into his trance and said, ‘Do you bid me openmy mouth? What if I do open my mouth? Do you say that you will enterinto me? Away Satan, you cannot enter into me, except the Lord give youleave, and I trust he will not.’ Again after this, he falls into a trance saying,‘Come Master Hildersham, let us six go to Heaven,’ at which time therewere just six in the parlour. Then, before he could read two words, he fellagain into a trance and said, what Satan, would you have me become a traitor?God defend.’ These words proceeded from him with great vehemency andearnestness of spirit. Then, pausing a while, he says again, ‘Do you say thatwhen I am asleep you will pluck out my throat? I care not for you.

Do your worst, Satan, you cannot touch our soul.’ Then he readagain, and at the second word started amazedly saying, ‘Look where the bearcomes.

Hark how he roars.’ Then said he, ‘Away Satan, and get you hence.Yes, I charge you in the name of the everlasting God to get you hence.’ Theyoffer him the book again, and he read not three words but he was overtakenwith a quiet trance wherein, lying a while, he said, ‘Oh, I see a milk whitedove. The dove says, “Fear not, you will have better news.”’ Again he beganto read. And again he was snatched into his trance, and said, ‘Do you say thatthe Lord has given you leave to enter into me. Away Satan, you are a liar. Iknow he will not allow you to enter into me.’ Again, after he offered to read,he was cast into a trance. And, lying very quietly, he says, ‘Hark, ho, lookwhat a fair dove is there. The dove says that the Devil uses enemies towardsme. Hark, hark what the dove says. You have an enemy here on earth thatsays you are a dissembler. He will fry in hell torments. Your eyes will seehis judgements. For his sins do smoke up into the elements, and do piercethe Heavens.’ Then pausing again a while, he says, ‘Hark what the dove says,“Wheresoever the glory of God is shown, there are always some enemiesto resist it.”’ He began to read again, but at the third word fell into a trancesaying, ‘What, do you say that you will torment me? Do you say that youwill carry me into a wood, and cast me out at the window? My Redeemerlives. The Lord of Hosts is his name. I fear you not. Remember that Satan.’And pausing a while, he says, ‘Master Hildersham, see, see how the worldpasses away. Yea, it must pass away, it hurries on apace.’ Then he beginsto read again and, at the third word, is cast into a trance. And at length, hesays, ‘See what a little of God’s word does, how it chases him away. See,see how Satan flies away.’ Again, being about to read, he started suddenlyand said, ‘This book is a flame of fire.’ And presently, he fell into a trance,saying, ‘Would you have me tear the book? Away Satan. I will not tear it.’Then lying still and pausing a while, he said at length, ‘Look where the dovecomes. Hark what the dove says, “The Lord your God has tied your enemySatan fast in a chain. Unless you fall again, he will never tempt you.

And so, having continued in prayer a good while, the boy at lastarose, finding the dove’s words true and himself very well, both in mindand body. And so, thanks be to God, he has remained ever since, whichthe Lord continue to his own glory, the joy of the godly, and the child’scomfort, Amen. Now the witch is dead.

In February1595,his daughter Anne and his son John, nine and tenyears of age, began to show signs of possessions. Later three other chil-dren resident in the household, Margaret Hurdman, Ellinor Hurdman,and Ellen Holland, became similarly possessed. Eventually, a maid JaneAshton, thirty years old, and a poor relation Margaret Byrom, thirty-threeyears of age, acted demonically.John Dee had had experience of demoniacs. In August1590anurse inhis household, Ann Frank, had become possessed by an evil spirit which hehad attempted to exorcise by prayer and (unusually) the anointing of herbreast with holy oil. The exorcism was unsuccessful. Two weeks later shetried to drown herself in his well, and three weeks after that successfullycut her own throat.1John Dee, perhaps as a consequence wary of any direct involvement,counselled Nicholas Starkie to gain the assistance of ‘some godly preachers,with whom he should join in prayer and fasting for the help of his children’.2And it was upon this advice, and having heard the story of Thomas Darling,that Starkie sought the services of John Darrell and George More.John Dee also called in Edmond Hartley, a witch, whom he sharplyreproved. Edmond Hartley had been engaged by Nicholas Starkie in mid1595to treat Anne and John, and the other children who became pos-sessed after his arrival. They responded well to his treatment of ‘certain1This is one of the rare cases of a demoniac successfully taking her own life. There is no evidencein Ann Frank’s case of the usual manifestations of possessed behaviour. The diagnosis of beinginhabited by the devil may have been made, not on the grounds of the usual signs of possession,but on that of the oft made connection between severe depression and demonic possession.

Threatening to go over-seas, Hartley, a cunning man in more ways than one, was able to extractforty shillings a year from Starkie on the promise that he would stay andtreat the children. It was his further demand of a house and grounds fromStarkie, and Starkie’s suspicion that he was the cause rather than the cureof the children that sent him to Manchester to consult John Dee.After Dee’s reproof of Hartley, the children were quiet. But three weekslater, they began again their accustomed fits, now joined by the two olderwomen, Margaret Byrom and Jane Ashton. Hartley was not only greedy,but lecherous. He had kissed all of the possessed, so the text alleges. Thiswas his downfall. Rarely for the English cases, the sexual and the demoniccombined: ‘His manner was that, when he meant them a mischief, thenhe would kiss them if he could, and therewith breathe the Devil into theirbodies.’4Only the maid Joan Smith was able to escape his advances; onlyshe, we are assured, escaped possession.Itwas his pursuit of Margaret Byrom to her home in Salford that was tobe his undoing. Found with her by some preachers there,5they suspectedwitchcraft and had him arrested. He was tried at the Lancaster Assizes inearly March1597and convicted of having bewitched the children. Themost decisive piece of evidence was Nicholas Starkie’s account of Hartley’sconjuring. While he was with Hartley in a wood around Autumn of1596,Hartley had made a circle on the ground ‘with many crosses and partitions’which he desired Starkie tread out. After which, he said, ‘now I shall troublehim that troubled me, and be even with him that sought my death’.6Hartleydenied any wrongdoing. But at his execution, the rope broke whereuponhe ‘penitently confessed’.7Hewas hanged a second time.When George More wrote this work, he had been in prison for almosttwo years. In May1599,John Darrell had been condemned as a counterfeit,and he and George More, deposed from the ministry, had been impris-oned. For George More, the conviction and execution of Edmond Hartleywas a crucial part of Darrell’s and his defence. The first part of More’strue Discoursewas intended to demonstrate that he and Darrell, and theseven possessed, could not have been guilty of ‘cosinage and counterfeit-ing’8as Samuel Harsnett’sADiscovery of the Fraudulent Practices of John3More,1600,p.13(see below, p.203).4More,1600,p.16(see below, p.205).5According to Darrell,1600a, p.6,byMatthew Palmer, a preacher, who was coincidentally, the curateof John Dee.6More,1600,p.14(see below, p.204). According to Darrell,1600a, p.1,his words were, ‘I will meetwith them that went about my death.’7More,1600,p.21(see below, p.207).8More,1600,p.6(see below, p.199)."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"194Demonic Possession and ExorcismDarrell(1599)had alleged. On the contrary, for More, the legal outcomedemonstrated that the seven had been genuinely possessed and had beentruly bewitched by Edmond Hartley.Inthe second part ofATrueDiscourse,More re-inforces his argumentthat the possession of the seven was genuine by detailing the signs of pos-session that they all exhibited. For More’s readers, the signs must have beensufficiently known to them as signs of demonic possession that the iterationof them would be persuasive. And while More recognised that the scepticalmight find any one of the signs symptomatic of more common naturalillnesses, the union of all or most of eighteen signs listed in the one indi-vidual (and in this case seven individuals) would, he believed, ‘prove a verysound and corporal possession’.9And the presence of acts above the powerof nature – preternatural knowledge, extraordinary strength, unexplainablefamiliarity with Latin – was, for More, decisive.Most of the possessed also demonstrated demonically inspired skillsunique to them. John Starkie preached eloquently and sang angelically,Margaret Hurdman possessed a gift for mimicry, Margaret Byrom was adeptat visions of demons, and the untutored Ellen Holland showed advancedskills in spinning. John, Anne, Ellen, and Ellinor showed remarkable botan-ical knowledge, and expertise in dancing. Somewhat surprisingly, More issurprised that the children are well when playing games, but were fearfullytormented when the Scriptures were read, prayers were said, or exhortationsweredirected at them.More’svivid account of the dispossession of the seven follows.10Itwasten days after the death of Hartley, on the afternoon of16March1597that Darrell and More arrived at Cleworth. There had been some respitesince the death of Hartley. But Darrell and More were convinced thatSatan was present but dormant. They were not disappointed. The childrenimmediately threw fits in their presence. By midnight, the family had beenprepared by More and Darrell for the deliverance of the seven which wasto take place on the following day.Byseven o’clock on the following morning, the five children, togetherwith Jane Ashton and Margaret Byrom, had been brought into the parlourand were laid on couches while the family and a large crowd of neighboursgathered.11After an initial Satanic outburst, prayer and preaching continueduntil three o’clock in the afternoon with the possessed reasonably quiet,until in a sign that Satan (always at his most violent before his expulsion)9More,1600,p.48(see below, p.221).10See More,1600,pp.49–63(see below, pp.221–8).11According to Darrell1600,p.10,inaddition to himself, More, and the local pastor Dickens, aboutthirty people were assembled."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven195recognised the end was near, the seven ‘broke out into exceeding loud cries,all seven roaring and bellowing in such extreme and fearful manner thatthey troubled us all, being so violent and outrageous that they had muchado to be held’.12After almost two hours of battle, Satan departed.The core of Samuel Harsnett’s charges against John Darrell was thathe was the chief actor in ‘juggling and deluding the people by counterfeitmiracles’13in the dispossessions of William Sommers, Thomas Darling, andthe seven of Lancashire. More’s defense of Darrell inAtrueDiscourseis tominimise Darrell’s role in the deliverance of the possessed in the Cleworthcase. According to Darrell himself, he, More, and Dickoms were all equallyinvolved in the dispossession of all seven.14ButMore provides an alternativestory, one which, by marginalising Darrell’s role, magnifies his, an outcomeMoreboth recognises and hopes to avoid.15According to More, towards the latter part of the day of17March, JaneAshton, being exceptionally violent, was separated from the others andtreated alone by Darrell and Dickoms. In the meantime, the prayers ofMoreand the crowd in attendance effected the deliverance of the remain-ing six, to the expressed disappointment of Darrell. The seven signs ofdispossession listed in the last part of the text were intended to demon-strate the authenticity of their deliverance and the state from which theyweredelivered. The next morning, Darrell, More, and Dickoms prayed inturns until around midday when Jane, hearing that More wished anotherto take his place, begged him to continue. The Devil departed soon after.Inspite of the key role of More in the story of the Lancashire seven, thetext makes no suggestion that More has any unique powers as an exorcist.Onthe contrary, it endorses a Puritan theology of exorcism. Deliverancefrom possession is ‘no extraordinary gift, peculiar to any one man, butcommon to all the faithful, as well to one as to another. And the mean andsimple people have as great privilege and power to cast out Satan by theirfaith and fasting and fervent prayer, as either he, or I, or the best and chiefestpreacher.’16Dispossession is ascribable to the ‘ordinance of Christ’17andnot to powers inherent in any individual, in spite of papist claims to thecontrary.Except for Jane Ashton, all remained free of Satan and continued fromthat time in good health.

This sort may dislike the handling of this strange story inthis harsh manner, while they affect great and high things. Yet the movingcauses of setting it out being considered, may overcome that curiosity andwork some contentment.First then, the story of the possession and dispossession of ThomasDarling, and also many things concerning the strange handling of WilliamSommers to second the same, are both put in print. And though the truthof both be sufficiently cleared therein, yet there is great opposition both byword and writing offered on set purpose to hinder the crediting of either. Ithought it fit to add to these two the story of those in Lancashire, as famousas the rest, both in that they were seven in one family all possessed at once,as also that they were all seven dispossessed within two days by prayer andfasting, and that this also being published as the third glorious witness ofthe wonderful works of God wrought and seen in three several Shires ofour land, all men might be the more moved to believe the truth of thesethings, seeing at the mouth of three such sufficient witnesses, it is so surelysealed up and confirmed.Secondly, in respect of the Papists who do more malign this particularof Lancashire than any of the rest, labouring mightily and by many meansboth to discredit and abolish it, whereupon some of them have given itout, that those seven were not possessed. Others say that they were allseven possessed, but never yet dispossessed. And some others of themaffirm that they were all dispossessed, yet not by preachers of the Gospel,but by their seminary and mass priests, and this last runs currently amongthem.For there being eight or nine seminaries in the Clink, divers of themstood out against me to my face, and told me that whatsoever was done inLancashire by us was done by conjuring and knavery. And though MasterStarkie himself did justify the whole matter and cleared it from all their"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven199slanders, and that before the chiefest of them in the Clink, yet they receivednot his testimony. But they told him that they had received the reportof this from a gentleman in that country, whom they would credit beforehim in this case. And no marvel, for if the Church of England have thispower to cast out devils, then the Church of Rome is a false Church. Forthere can be but one true Church, the principal mark of which, as they say,is to work miracles, and of them this is the greatest, namely to cast outdevils. And hereupon, conferring at another time with two of them, theybrought out this bold protestation, that if we could prove any such powerto be in our Church and show them an infallible instance or example tojustify the practice thereof, then would they join themselves to our Churchassemblies, and freely embrace our religion.Thirdly, in respect of that gross and great error which is a commonand received opinion among the most, namely, that we do challenge toourselves some special gift to cast out devils above other men. Thoughwe have utterly disclaimed this, yet many do ignorantly ascribe the effectof the work wrought rather to some extraordinary power in us than to theordinance of Christ, which in no case ought so to be.But chiefly I have taken in hand this brief discourse for the better clearingboth of Master Darrell and myself from those accusations and slanders ofcosinage21and counterfeiting, with which we are charged both by word andwriting, as if we were guilty thereof, even in this particular of Lancashire.For there is a book of a large volume lately come out under the name ofS.

Some of these,partly for religion, and partly because the land descended not to the heir’smale, wished and vowed still to pray for the perishing of her issue. Andaccordingly, four of her children, though at their birth likely to live, yetafterward pined away in a most strange manner.Some of Mrs. Starkie’s kindred, observing how one child after anotherpined away, moved with compassion told Mistress Starkie of the saidunnatural vow. She hereupon conceived such a grief, that she made anestate of her land to her husband and his heirs, all issue failing herself. Afterthis conveyance was made, Mistress Starkie had two children, a son andadaughter, both of which prospered well till they came to ten or twelveyears of age. But then, with five more in her family, they were possessedand vexed with evil spirits, as the sequel does declare."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven203First, in the beginning of February 1594, Anne the daughter was takenwith a depressed heavy countenance, and with a certain fearful starting andpulling together of her body. About a week after, John Starkie the son wastaken as he was going to school, and was compelled to shout vehemently,not being able to stop himself. After this they waxed worse and worse,falling often into strange and extreme fits.Wherewith Master Starkie grieved and, having been charged two hundredpounds or thereabouts, carelessly sought a remedy. For, to speak of no more,he went to a Seminary Priest who could do no good because, forsooth,he had not then his books. Whereupon Master Starkie continued stillseeking for help and heard of one Edmond Hartley, a witch. He made himacquainted with the state of his children, and with large offers craved hishelp. In the end, Hartley consented to come. He, being there and havingused certain popish charms and herbs, by degrees the children were quiet.And so they continued, seeming to be well almost a year and a half. All thistime, Hartley often came to visit them. At length he feigned as though hewould go into another country, but whither Master Starkie might not know.And when he began to go his way, John Starkie began bleeding. And Hartleycame to him and said that if he had been but forty roods23from him, nonecould have staunched the bleeding. And thus it fell out at other times.Then Master Starkie, fearing lest his children would be much troubled inhis absence and he uncertain where to find him, offered to give forty shillingsayear pension for his assistance in time of need. At first, he consented toaccept this offer. But afterward, not satisfied, he coveted more, a houseand ground. When Master Starkie refused to give these, he threatened in afume, in the absence of Master Starkie but in the hearing of many, that ifhe would not satisfy his desires, he would make such a shout at Cleworthas never was heard. This was also effected in such a hideous and fearfulmanner, as the like in England has not been heard.After this Master Starkie went to his Father’s house. This Hartley wentwith him. After he24was in bed, he was sorely tormented all night long. The23Arood or rod is about six to eight yards in length.24Hartley."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204Demonic Possession and Exorcismnext day being recovered, he went into a little wood not far off from thehouse, where he made a circle a yard and half around, with many crossesand partitions. When he was finished, he came back to call Master Starkie,telling him what he had done. And he desired him to go and tread out hiscircle, for he said he might not do it himself. This being also accomplished,he said, ‘Well, now I shall trouble him that troubled me, and be even withhim that sought my death.’When Master Starkie perceived this, and many other bad qualities inthis fellow, he waxed weary of him, especially seeing that there was noamendment in his children but rather that they became worse and worse.He then sought, though secretly, for other help from the physicians. Andafter that, he went to one Doctor Dee at Manchester, who wished MasterStarkie to crave the help and assistance of some godly preachers, with whomhe should join in prayer and fasting for the help of his children.He25procured also the said Hartley the witch to come before him, whomhe so sharply reproved that the children had better rest for some three weeksafter.But then they began their accustomed fits. First, John Starkie, about thefourth of January 1596. As he was reading a book, something gave him suchathump in the neck that he was suddenly struck down with a most horribleshriek. And he said that Satan had broken his neck, lying there pitifullytormented for the space of two hours.At night on the same day, being in bed, he suddenly leapt out with such aterrible outcry that amazed them all, being tossed and tumbled a long time,being exceeding fierce and strong like a mad man, or rather like a mad dog,that I may so speak, snatching at and biting everybody that laid hold on him,not sparing in that fit his own Mother, smiting furiously all that came nearhim, hurling the bed-staves at their heads and throwing the pillows into thefire.His sister Anne likewise began again to be troubled, and three otheryoung girls in the house, of whom Master Starkie had the education, with25John Dee."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven205their portions committed to him by their parents. The first was MargaretHurdman, fourteen years of age; the second Ellinor her sister, of ten years;the third Ellen Holland, of twelve years. All these had many strange andsore fits, being possessed by this witch’s means. His manner was that,when he meant them a mischief, then he would kiss them if he could, andtherewith breathe the Devil into their bodies. He kissed John Starkie, andall the maids that were possessed, Margaret Byrom, Jane Ashton, and all.He struggled much with one Joan Smith to have kissed her. But with muchado she escaped his hands so that, of all the maid servants, she only waspreserved and not once troubled at all. Whereupon Ellinor said in one ofher fits, that if Edmond had kissed her, three men could not have held her.Margaret Byrom of thirty three years, a kinswoman to Mistress Starkie,came to Cleworth to see her friends. While there, she began to be troubledlike the rest, and by the same means. For Hartley the witch, being in a sorefit in the night, she in a desire to comfort him, went into his chamber and satdown by his bed side, and began to speak to him. And it was not long beforehe rose up. And sitting on his bed, he leaned his head down to the maidwho sat just underneath him, whereupon she was suddenly taken that shecould neither stand nor speak. When she endeavoured to arise, she couldnot. When others held her up, she sank down and became senseless. ButEdmond the witch left her and went to another room. And he had no morefits after while he was at Cleworth, though he had divers before he met withthis maid.Jane Ashton, of the age of thirty years, was the last that was possessed.She confessed that once, coming across Edmond, he told her that she hadbest be content, or else he would anger the best vein in her heart. At othertimes, she said, he offered great kindness and large promises in the way ofmarriage, and had kissed her also. The like loving affections he sometimesshowed to Margaret Byrom, as she confessed. And he had kissed her alsoas it was thought.About the fourteenth of January, the five youngest began their strange fitsagain, entering into them normally by a very sudden and fearful shrieking,barking and howling, in such a hideous noise as cannot be expressed."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"206Demonic Possession and ExorcismShortly after this time, Margaret Byrom hastened homeward to herMother’s house at Salford near Manchester, hoping to find some moreease and relief from her fits than she did at Cleworth. She taking her leave,Edmond the witch said he would go home with her even though he nevercame again. So she went, accompanied by him and another. Seven miles onthe way, she had ten fits. When she was recovered, she desired Edmond totell her how she might be helped. He told her plainly that both she and therest were past his hands, and that no one man could do them any good. Itwas too great a work, but they must be three or two at the least with ferventand hearty prayer.After she came home, her fits doubled and still increased. Edmond cameto her every day. As soon as she saw him, she fell straight into a fit, in whichshe was more sorely handled than ever before. There came in divers to seeher. And some preachers, who found Edmond with her, and suspecting himby some signs, asked him what he did with the maid. He said that he cameto pray with her. ‘Pray’, said one, ‘Why man, you cannot pray.’ ‘Yes, but Ican,’ said he. ‘Say The Lord’s Prayer then,’ said the preacher. And he beganto fumble around it very ill-favouredly, and could not for his life say it tothe end. They then thought him to be a witch, and caused him presently tobe apprehended and brought before two Justices of the Peace, where he wasexamined. And after divers witnesses had come against him, the Justicessent him back to Margaret Byrom so that she might accuse him to his face.But as soon as she saw him, straightway she fell down backwards and becamespeechless. This was tried the second time. Yea, five times was he broughtto her, and she was ever cast down and struck dumb, so that she could notspeak one word against him.Yet, when he was taken away and set behind the backs of the people,she recovered herself, began to speak to him and to charge him with manythings. On these accusations of hers and many other testimonies takenagainst him for witchery, he was sent by the Justices to Lancaster Gaol. Onthe way there, on the second of February 1597, he came by Cleworth tofetch his clothes to take with him. And all the children, seeming to be wellbefore he came, presently they fell into very violent and outrageous fits."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven207They went at him all at once, attempting to strike him. It was much ado fortwo strong men to hold the least of them. And if they had not been forciblyrestrained, the witch would have been in great danger, for they were as fierceand furious against him as if they would have torn him to pieces.After this, about the beginning of March, Master Hopwood, Justice ofthe Peace, came on purpose to take the testimony of these five childrenagainst Edmond the witch, to carry to Lancaster at the Assizes to further hisindictment. Then these five each became speechless. And being called forone after another, they fell and sunk down on the way, not being able to go, norto stand nor speak one word. After the Justice was gone, they complained thatEdmond had stopped their mouths, and would not allow them tospeak.At the same time, Jane Ashton began to howl and to bark, when she was tobe brought in for a witness against Edmond. Whereupon one of the youngergirls in her fit then said, ‘Ah, Edmond. Do you trouble her now, when shewould testify against you?’.Margaret Byrom also, two nights before her examination againstEdmond, had divers apparitions, wherein she was sorely terrified by theDevil in Edmond’s likeness, charging her deeply to take heed what she saidagainst him, for now the time was come.And when the Assizes came, Edmond was brought forth, arraigned andconvicted. Master Starkie, charged him with bewitching his children. Heproved this sufficiently and made it evident to the whole bench. For all that,they could find no law to hang him. Whereupon Master Starkie called tomind the making of the circle, whereof we have already spoken, which, beingdelivered on his oath, was received. Yet Edmond stiffly denied it, and stoodout against him. And he told him to his face that he should not hang him,let him do what he could. For the Devil had promised him that no halterwould hang him. Yet the Jury convicted him, and the Judge condemnedhim. Hartley was hanged and the halter broke. Whereupon he penitentlyconfessed that he had deserved that punishment and that all which MasterStarkie had charged him with was true.

By which I hope that it will appear to theimpartial reader, that such great things were done by them as be very hardand unusual quite beyond the nature of things, and such as neither by artnor any human skill could be counterfeited. So that, as the first part ofthis Discourse has cleared us from counterfeiting, this may be sufficient toprove the truth of their possession, contrary to that overbold and confidentconfutation made by the Discoverer, who labours both tooth and nail tocross and contradict the same.First, John Starkie, son and heir of Master Nicholas Starkie, amongsundry, had some very rare and strange fits, in which he showed very extraor-dinary knowledge. For he, being but the age of twelve years or thereabouts,did in his trance declare the strange sins of this land committed in all estatesand degrees of people, and denounced the fearful judgements of God due tothem. He then exhorted his parents and the people there present to repent,that they might avoid all those grievous plagues, and wished that all thewhole land might do the like. After this, he made a most excellent prayer,first for the whole church, then for the Queen’s Majesty for the subduingof her enemies, for the continuance of her life and peaceable government,for the upholding of the Gospel and for all the true Ministers of Christ,for those that have authority, for his parents, and all the people of God.In this exhortation and prayer, he continued over two hours performingthe same so excellently, both for the matter and manner of handling anduttering the same, that they that heard it did admire it, and thought that agood preacher could very hardly have done the like. This being done, hesung a good piece of the fourth Psalm in a most sweet and heavenly tuneas ever might be heard. All this was done in a trance, his eyes being closedup. And he neither knew what he said or did. In this long and continuedspeech, his Father wished him to lie still and to speak no more, saying tohim, ‘Son, you injure your head, and cannot tell what you say.’ ‘Yes,’ Father,said he, ‘I know well what I say.’ ‘Then,’ said his Father, ‘you can tell me howmany persons are in this chamber and what are their names.’ Thereupon hecounted them and told the names of every one of them to the number ofeighteen or nineteen, his eyes being closely shut up, as they had been all themorning before, the neighbours and some strangers having come in after"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"210Demonic Possession and Exorcismhe began his fit. And in the end, he said to his Father, ‘There is now oneof your tenants newly come into the chamber.’ He told him his name andthat he dwelt far off in the peak. ‘Let him come,’ said he, ‘and take me bythe hand, and I will see and be well for this time.’ And so it came to pass,at which they all marvelled. And they asked him whether he rememberedwhat he had said all that long time. And he flatly denied that he had spokenanything at all.Secondly, Margaret Hurdman, of thirteen years of age, being in a trancethree hours long, and possessed at that time, as it seemed, with a spirit ofpride, did most lively express both by words and gestures the proud womenof our times, who cannot content themselves with any sober or modestattire but are ever ready to follow every new and disguised fashion, and yetnever think themselves fine enough. Whereupon she said, ‘Come on mylad,’ for so she called the spirit that stood before her in that likeness toteach her all the tricks of pride, ‘Come on and set my neckerchief on theone side as I do on the other.’ And as she was a setting of it, she said to him,‘Thus, my lad, I will have a fine smock of silk. It will be finer than yours.Iwill have a petticoat of silk, not of red but of the best silk that is. It willbe embroidered a foot high. It will be laid on with gold lace.

I will none of it.’ And then reverting, she said,‘Jesus bless me.’ But remembered nothing that she had either said or done.At another time in her fit, she went to the maids as they were washingclothes, and began to wash with them. And though they were two lustywomen, and she but a young girl, yet she washed more for the space of anhour so quickly and so finely, that they could not come near her.The third is Margaret Byrom, of whom there be many things worthy tobe observed. She, being at Master Starkie’s house about the end of January,was for the space of a whole day and a night grievously molested and sorelyfrightened with a terrible vision. It appeared to her lying in bed, swelling andtumbling, like a foul black dwarf, with half a face, long shaggy hair, blackbroad hands and black cloven feet. She, ever fearing lest he came to carryher away, began to pray. He threatened that, if she did pray, he would carryher away. She was in such a strait, that she knew not what to do, whetherto pray or not to pray. Yet in the end, she resolved that she would pray tothe Lord, for her help was in him alone, who indeed gave her strength andcourage to call earnestly to him. Presently Satan left and vanished away.28Astrip of wood, steel, whalebone or other rigid material used to support a corset.29An ornamental chest covering worn under the lacing of a bodice.30An outer petticoat worn to protect the dress while riding."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"212Demonic Possession and ExorcismAt her Mother’s house at Salford, six times within six weeks, Satansought to torment her by not allowing her to eat or drink for divers daystogether. And if at the earnest request of her friends she did offer to drink,he would cast both her and the drink down together. And again at othertimes, she would eat up all, were it never so much, with such snatching andgreediness like a hungry dog. All was fish that came to the net. She sparednothing, devouring all that came, and yet still crying that she had nothing.She thought she could have eaten up half a calf. And yet after that greatabundance of meat and drink, her belly seemed as empty as at the first, sothat they all wondered at that which she had eaten, and marvelled also whichway it went.Sometimes also, the spirit would appear to her in the likeness of a greatblack dog, with open mouth and the greatest chain that ever she saw, beingvery thick and long, drawing it after him, with which he crossed her, andtook her legs from under her. She had little rest for the space of six weeks,either day or night. Yea, many times when the people stood round abouther, she was taken suddenly, and violently cast headlong sometimes underthe bed, sometimes under the covers. And sometimes she was thrown tothe bars of the fire, and there she lay as if Satan meant to roast her. Whenshe sat on a stool, he would suddenly throw her quite backwards, as if hemeant to have broken her neck.After this he appeared in the likeness of a big black cat with very fearfulbroad eyes, which came staring her in the face, running by her and aroundher. And throwing her down and leaving her senseless, he departed. Andabout half an hour after that fit, the spirit came like a big mouse leaping onher knee, and cast her down backwards as before. Her senses were takenfrom her, her eyes were closely shut up, her tongue was plucked doubleinto her throat, her mouth was open, her jaws set, and all her whole bodystretched out as stiff as iron. And thus she lay many times for the space ofan hour as a spectacle very fearful to behold.It was usual also, with the spirit, to come to her in the night in the likenessof a black man with half a face, which took her just as she was going to bed,and would be sure to throw her backwards. And she being recovered and"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven213got into her bed, it would come and sit on the top of her head, holding itsfour fingers on her forehead very heavily. It held her very firmly so that shecould not see nor stir. Yet for all that, her kerchief and headgear were pulledoff. And though they had tied it up and bound it on very fast, yet suddenly inamoment he plucked all asunder. And her hair, that was so tightly tied up,was broken loose, and brought about her ears. And this was tested twice orthrice in a night. When they had done the best they could to keep it on yet, inthe twinkling of an eye, it was all undone. He marred their work in that point,and they lost all their labour. And whenever he took his leave and departed,his manner was to give her a great thump on the back part of her head,insomuch that with those thumps she felt her head sore a good whileafter.At another time, she learned three very excellent graces by the apparitionand instruction of the spirit. She never could read, nor ever heard thembefore in all her life, as she protested. Yet she learned them suddenly, andshe rehearsed all three very perfectly. And so it is like she can do till thisday.About the tenth of February and at some other times before, she felt, asshe thought, some great thing roll up and down in her belly, like a calf. Itpricked as if the head and nose thereof had been full of nails, as she thought,with which, being sorely pained, she was compelled to shriek. She wasexceedingly swollen by it. And sometimes it pulled her as she thought in ahundred pieces. It made a loud noise in her belly, like that in the belly of agreat trotting horse. It caused her to bark and howl. Then it would plumpdown into her body, like a cold whetstone on her left side, whereupon therest of her body was benumbed with an extreme cold, wherewith she fell aquaking, her teeth also chattering in her head. And if then she offered towarm herself at the fire, she was presently thrown backwards. After thesefits, her breath stank so ill that her neighbours came not near her for thespace of a day and a night. Yea, it was so exceedingly offensive that, afterthe fit, she herself could perceive it, and could very hardly endure it.Further to finish this particular, six several times in her fits at Cleworth,every time six spirits appeared to her, five of them very black, fouler than"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"214Demonic Possession and Exorcismblackamores,31marvellously ugly to behold. These she felt shoving andthrusting great nails into her to torment her, as she thought, wringing andbending her, as if they would break her backbone. The other spirit was inher eyes, like a very fair little child, so fine and comely as ever might beseen. She said that it always sat next to her, and would say to her, ‘Fearnot, for you will have no harm.’ And because it was so amiable, she wasever catching and desiring to take it, but her hand being stayed by some thatstood by, immediately she was more sorely troubled, and fell a tossing andtumbling as at other times.Ellen Holland and Ellinor Hurdman, the one being ten, the other twelveyears of age, were both of them, by the malice of Satan kept fasting for thespace of three days and three nights. For so long, they remained senseless,and did neither eat nor drink anything, wherein he laboured that they mightboth of them perish and pine away. And when the third night was come,Ellen Holland called for the hour glass. And she told them that she mustnow have a fit, and must not come out of it for the space of four hours.She then called for a distaff32and a spindle, and bade them turn the glass,for she would spin an hour and a half of that time. And though she was butachild and, as it were, but beginning to learn to spin, yet she did it at thattime so finely and with such expedition as was thought impossible for a veryskilful woman to do the like, and stopped just at the end of the appointedtime. And then she had most cruel and terrible fits, till the glass had runout the rest of the time, and reverted just at the four hours end, as beforeshe had said. But what she had said or done in all this time, that she did notremember.Likewise, Ellinor Hurdman told them that she must have a fit threehours long. She called for the hour glass, and bade them turn it and mark itwell. Presently, with the turning of the glass, she fell into a trance, her eyesclosely shut up, and her face turned quite from the glass, the other way.Notwithstanding, she measured the time most distinctly as the glass didrun, dividing the hour into four quarters by very just and equal proportions,31Ethiopians.32Ametre long cleft staff on which wool or flax was wound."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven215according as it was most duly observed. She reckoned it herself, and namedevery quarter as it had run out, saying thus, ‘A quarter run,’ ‘Half hour run,’‘Three quarters run,’ and the fourth time, ‘Turn the glass,’ even just when ithad run out. And so did she the second time and missed not, and the thirdlikewise till it was out. And then, just at the very time, she reverted and said,‘Jesus, bless me,’ and so was restored for that time. Among all the strangethings acted by them, there was none better marked than this. It was donein the day, in the presence of many witnesses. Master Starkie was himselfthe man that did chiefly observe it. And to the best estimate that he couldgive, the quarters were most equally divided and the proportion most justin the measure. They all marvelled greatly at this, and could not choosebut impute this supernatural skill to the work of Satan, who as well by hisstrange and cunning suggestions, as by other enforced signs, does make itevident, that that working subject is in his power, and possession.Furthermore John Starkie, Anne Starkie, Ellen Holland and EllinorHurdman, these four, had the use of their legs taken from them for thespace of seven hours. And being so all that time, they went only on theirhands and their knees, out of one chamber into another, and that as fast asif they had had the use of their feet. They could rest in no place, but wentwithout ceasing all that while. They could leap up from the floor to the bed,and down from the bed to the floor, hopping so up and down, as lightly asfrogs. And so they continued for the space of seven hours at the least.This time being out, they were restored to the use of their legs. But yetthey still remained both senseless and speechless. In this state, they all fourwent into the garden. And forthwith, every one of them gathered one leafof every kind of herb that grew therein. From the greatest to the least, theymissed not one, even to the very grass. This being done, they came againinto the house. And then they went first into the hall, then into the parlour,and then into every chamber in the house, excepting one which was locked.And there in the windows of these several rooms, every one of them laiddown one leaf, of the same kind of herb which they had gathered. For look,where any of them did lay down one, there all the rest would lay downanother of the same sort, and no more, nor no other."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"216Demonic Possession and ExorcismNow mark the strangeness of this act which, howsoever it seem in itself tobe but a trifle, yet in the trial of it, it will prove a wonder if the circumstancesbe duly considered. For first, the herbs were many, seeing the garden is large.Secondly, the rooms were many, for it is a gentleman’s house, and it is ofgood receipt. Thirdly, they were four, and they were but children, the eldestwas not above twelve years old. And yet, that they should gather of everysort, one leaf only and no more. Fourthly, that the herbs being mingledaltogether in their hands, yet that every one did most quickly and readily,without any searching at all, lay down the right herb, so that in every placethere were ever four, just of one and the same kind. Lastly, and that which isthe chiefest of all, that all this, as was duly observed, was done and dispatchedwithin less than one hour, in so divers rooms and sundry places, yea, on thestairs and thresholds of these rooms, and in their own chamber where theylay themselves. Not only in every window, but against every staunch of thewindow were these herbs thus laid down in the manner aforesaid.This was searched and found to be thus speedily and exactly done, asis said above. If it would have been performed by another four of gooddiscretion, the circumstances considered, it would have been the work of awhole day, and yet not so excellently performed, as it was by these. Whenthey did it, they were all out of their right minds, not knowing at all whatthey did, in so much that, when they came out of their trance, they marvelledwhere they had been. And they could not be persuaded that they had donethis strange thing, though it was shown to them by plain demonstration.These four also in another trance did dance as finely as if they had comeout of the dancing school, one of the youngest playing with her mouth ascunningly for the present as if she had been a minstrel.It was further observed that, in those times when they were so subjectto have their fits very often and very thickly, and to be sorely vexed andtormented, yet for all that, if they went to cards or other games, they werenot troubled at all during the whole time of their playing and gaming. Andthough they went away from home, being invited to a gentleman’s house tohear a play, yet all that while they were not troubled nor one whit disquieted.But contrariwise, if either Scriptures were read or prayers used for them or"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven217exhortations applied to them, then ordinarily they fell into their fits. Andthey were very fearfully tormented, so much so that for the space of twoyears or thereabouts, till they were delivered, they never came to the churchfor fear of only increasing their torments.Moreover, the four youngest girls, being possessed with scorning spirits,in the day of their dispossession and in the time of the last sermon did showthe same. For when the word was applied to them, showing what strangethings Satan works in the children of disobedience, such as grinning andgnashing of teeth, staring with their eyes, making grimaces with their lips,thrusting out their tongues, and drawing their mouths awry very ugly, &c., asthese particulars were named, one after another, so they all four did in actionanswer the word of God which was spoken. They showed such unseemlygestures, fearful looks, and ugly countenances in every particular, and inthe very same instant and point of time when they were named. And thoughnot one of them did see what another did, yet for all that they did jumpso rightly in showing and setting out these unseemly signs, as that it couldvery hardly be discerned which of the four was first or last in performing ofthe same. Further, such was the great and extraordinary strength that werein these four in the time of their fits, that though some of them were butof the age of ten or eleven years, yet two or three strong men could hardlyhold one of them.And the two youngest and some of the rest, though they were unlearnedand never went to school, yet in their fits they were able to make answerto Latin questions propounded to them so truly and readily, as if theyhad soundly understood them. And herein were they tested sundry times.And if now they should be examined therein, they can neither answer norunderstand one word.There be also many other very strange things, acted by every one of thesein particular, which if they should be set down, every one, they would fillalarge volume. For brevity’s sake therefore, most things are omitted. Andthis also is most certain, that very many strange things, and as wonderful asany that here have been spoken of, were lost and let slip for want of care andgood observation."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"218Demonic Possession and ExorcismNow it is worthy to be marked that, though these possessed persons hadevery one some things peculiar to themselves which none of the rest didshow, and that so rare and strange that all the people were forced to confessit was the work of an evil spirit within them, so had they also many things incommon one with another, and were in their fits for the most part handledalike.(1) They had all and every one of them very strange visions and fearfulapparitions, whereupon they would say, ‘Look where Satan is. Lookwhere Beelzebub is. Look where Lucifer is. Look where a great blackdog is, with a firebrand in his mouth. See how Satan runs at me withaspear in his hand to stick me to the heart, but God will defend me.’(2) They had every one of them two spirits at the least, one to tormentthem inwardly, with all the torments of Hell, as it were, for thepresent, and either one or more to stand before their faces, most uglyand terrible to behold, to drive them into all fear and astonishment.(3) They heard very hideous and fearful voices of the spirits sundry times,and did make marvellous answers back again to them very directlyand strangely.(4) They were in their fits ordinarily so held in that captivity and bondagethat, for an hour, two, or three, and longer time, they would neither seenor hear nor taste nor feel anything but the devils, they employing themwholly for themselves, vexing and tormenting them so extremely, thatfor the present they could feel no other pain or torture that could beoffered to them, no, not though you should pluck an ear from thehead, or an arm from the body.(5) They, all of them, were taken suddenly with a very fearful shriekingand a marvellously strange howling and shouting, making a noiseas it were to call on and to waken one another, so that the spirits,being raised up, might go to their work and proceed to tormenttheir subjects according to their custom. When one began, they allfollowed after in order, observing time and tune, as if it had beenthe ringing of seven bells. And such was the strangeness of these"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven219voices, that the uttering and framing of them exceeded all cunninginvention or the skill of any counterfeit imitation. And the effectwas also so fearful, that it was both terrible and troublesome to thewhole country, and wrought a wonderful astonishment in all thatheard it.(6) Further, they all of them had their bodies swollen to a wonderfullyhuge bigness, and almost incredible, if there had not been manyeye-witnesses to it.(7) They had also a marvellously sore heaving and lifting, as if their heartswould burst, so that with violent straining of themselves, some ofthem vomited much blood many times.(8) They had their faces disfigured, and turned towards their backs, afearful thrusting out of their tongues with a most ugly distorting oftheir mouths, being drawn up, as it were, to their ears.(9) They were all of them very fierce, offering violence both to themselvesand others, wherein also they showed very great and extraordinarystrength.(10) They blasphemed God and the Bible, they reviled the preachers,railed on such as feared God, scorned all holy prayers and wholesomeexhortations, which being offered and applied to them, they becameever much worse.(11) For the most part, they delighted in filthy and unsavoury speeches,very agreeable to the nature of that unclean spirit which then dwelledwithin them, insomuch that, in the very sermon time when suchunseemly behaviour was spoken against, the evil spirit wrought mostmaliciously and spitefully against the grace of God. And it forcedone of them, though she was a maid, to utter openly in the hearing ofthe people such filthy uncleanness as is not to be named.(12) Most of them were both blind, deaf, and dumb for divers daystogether.(13) They were out of their right minds without the use of the senses.They were especially void of feelings, as much sense in a stock as inone of them. Or, in a way, it was as possible to bring a dead man back"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"220Demonic Possession and Exorcismto life as to alter or change them in their trances or fits, in anythingthat they either said or did.(14) They were kept fasting a long time. And divers of them, for the spaceof three days and three nights, did neither eat, nor drink anything,Satan intending thereby to procure their pining away.(15) In their fits, they had divers parts and members of their bodies sostiff and stretched out as were inflexible, or very hard to be bent.(16) They showed very great and extraordinary knowledge, as may appearby the strange things said and done by them, according to that whichwe have already set down in the particulars.(17) They all in the end of every fit always said thus, ‘Jesus, bless me.’ Yea,though they had forty or a hundred fits in one day, as it is certain someof them had, yet they never missed saying thus. But as sure as theyhad a fit, whether it were short or long, so sure it was that it wouldbe ended with this prayer, ‘Jesus bless me.’ This was ever a sure signthat they were restored to the use of their senses for that time, whichnever failed.(18) After their fits, they were always as well as might be. And they feltvery little or no hurt at all, although they had been ever so sorelytormented immediately before.Now this harmony and consent in signs and actions, both for the matterand manner of strange handling of all these in their several fits, does makeit evident that they were all really and corporally possessed.Notwithstanding, that is true which is objected, namely, that sundry ofthese signs may be in one that is not possessed. For one may see very fearfulsights and strange apparitions, and may be haunted with evil spirits anddriven into great fears and frights, and yet not be possessed.Another may be both lame and blind, and dumb and deaf.The third may be very fierce, offering violence both to themselves, andothers.The fourth may gnash and foam and stare with his eyes, and fall downfearfully and suddenly, and lie as if he were dead."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven221And so it may be said of divers others, which may in many other ways bevery strangely handled, and yet not one of them truly possessed.The reason is because when sundry of these signs are severed from therest, and go alone by themselves, or else are found but two or three, orsome few together, then such signs may arise, as effects from some otherworking cause in the subject, or from the immediate hand of God, or someother way.But when all these signs concur and meet together in one man, or the mostof these, being joined with any one act above the power of nature, such assupernatural knowledge, and extraordinary strength, or any such impossiblework, then, if it will be examined either according to the Scriptures orhistories or reason itself, it will prove a very sound and corporal possession.And so by consequence, the great variety of strange signs and supernaturalacts performed by these seven, and shown as well in every particular, asin those things which they had in common one with another, does easilyconclude a very true and sound possession.The third partThe third part of this discourse concerns our coming to Master Starkie’shouse and the occasion thereof, how we came to have to deal with theseseven persons. Our entrance into, and our whole carriage in that actionbeing truly set down, may serve to discharge us of those grievous slanderscontained in theDiscovery,charging on us both the names and practice ofcousiners, jugglers, exorcists, imposters, &c.First then, the continuance of these troubles in Master Starkie’s house,the remembrance of Doctor Dee’s counsel to send for some preachers, theimprisoning of Edmond the witch in Lancaster Gaol, the hearing of the boyof Burton33who, being strangely afflicted, received help and deliveranceby Master Darrell’s advice. On these occasions, Master Starkie sent forMaster Darrell three several times before he came. He always impartedthe news to the brethren as it came to his hand, because he would attempt33Thomas Darling."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"222Demonic Possession and Exorcismnothing in those cases without very good consideration and lawful consent.In the end, it was concluded that he should go. And he thought fit that Ialso should go with him, as a companion on the journey and a witness to allhis proceedings according to his own request.This being done, Master Darrell wrote his letter to Master Starkie, inwhich he promised that, after some present and important business wasdispatched, he would come and visit him, desiring likewise the assistanceof some faithful ministers about Master Starkie, especially his pastor, tojoin with us.Master Starkie read this letter in the presence of John Starkie, his son,and some others. After which time, he, the said John, had no fit at all till theday of our coming thither. The rest had some little fits, but not as grievousas before. In these fits, they would say to the spirit, ‘You naughty lad, youmake us sick, for you know the preachers will come shortly.’So we, having prepared ourselves for this journey, went at the timeappointed towards Lancashire, where we had never been in our lives before.And on Wednesday the sixteenth of March, about one o’clock, we came toMaster Starkie’s house at Cleworth. Hearing that we were come, MistressStarkie with John Starkie her son and Anne her daughter, with some othersof the family, came forth to meet us, and received us with great joy. Andthey brought us into the hall, where we found Master Starkie himself, beingthen ready to rise from dinner. After our welcome to him, he commandedthe meat to be brought again. And he desired us to sit down at table, andso we did. Presently, after praising of God, we began to inquire of MasterStarkie the state of his family, and asked him how they did. He answeredthat he thanked God that they were all much better than they had been. ButJohn Starkie especially had been well for a fortnight together and not somuch as once troubled. And Anne Starkie his daughter had been well diversdays before our coming, without any fit at all. And the rest began to mendnow since Edmond the witch was hanged. And both he and his wife did notdoubt but that they would now do well. When we heard this, we suspectedgreatly Satan’s lurking in them. And we desired to see those that were stilltroubled, which were particularly three who were all quiet in the kitchen.He called for them to come up into the hall. And so they came. First, the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven223eldest came near to the table and made a low curtsy. And presently, in amoment, she was thrown into a chair, about three yards distant from theplace where she stood. There, she reared backward in the chair as thoughshe had been asleep, her body stretched out to the furthest, and as stiff asiron. This being done, in comes the second, who did like the first, and wassuddenly cast to a tableside, just opposite the other. Afterwards, comesin the last with both her hands close to her face. And she uttered thesewords, ‘I am come to counsel before I am called.’ And straightaway, whilethe word was in her mouth, she was thrown backward to the benchside,where she sat all aghast like the rest. Hereupon we arose from the table,being much amazed at the strangeness of the sight. And we went to lookat them and see in what manner they were visited. And after we had viewedthem well, within a quarter of an hour, they all stood up. And among manyoddly pleasant though unusual speeches, one of these three spoke merrilythus about the hanging of Hartley the witch who was newly executed.‘Do they think that they could hang the Devil. I wish no. They might hangEdmond, but they could not hang the Devil, for they were two, Edmond andthe Devil.’And afterwards, they began to rail and revile and to strike with bothhands and feet. And they could not be controlled till they were moved intoan upper chamber. There they continued together, talking one to another,mocking and scorning such as held them down, or said, or did any goodto them. And so they remained, deprived of the right to use their senses,both speaking and doing much evil, and yet utterly ignorant and senselessin all that passed from them. Thus they continued from that hour, beingtwo o’clock on the Wednesday till six at night on Thursday, when it pleasedGod to deliver them and the rest.Then we went into the garden and consulted with Master Starkie what wasto be done. We agreed on this course, namely, to take in hand the exerciseof fasting and prayer the next day, considering with ourselves where wemight get some other godly preacher to join with us, to assist us in thatwork. We thought of divers. But in the end we made choice of one MasterDickoms, the minister at Leigh, which is the Parish Church of MasterStarkie. Whereupon we sent for him."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"224Demonic Possession and ExorcismIn the meantime, we determined to prepare the whole family for the nextday, to make them all as fit as we could for that holy work, and chieflythat they might be truly humbled and sanctified, that so we might with themore courage and comfort join with them the next day in fasting and prayer.But when some of the possessed were tested, they were found incapableof all good counsel and instruction, and yet had the ability and power toresist and scorn the same. After some half hour spent this way with someof them, the rest of the possessed had all come into the chamber. MargaretByrom, whom Master Starkie had caused to be sent for, was newly comefrom Manchester, and Jane Ashton also, who before our coming was notmuch suspected. Yet she that day, in the morning, had her belly swelledas big as a woman with child. And straightway on our coming, she madeastrange shrieking and howling, like the rest had. So Master Starkie,holding his son John, and Mistress Starkie holding her daughter Anna fastin their arms, Master Darrell began to exhort them. Presently John Starkieand Anne cried out mightily, with such outrageous roaring and bellowingthat they could not for a long time be restrained. And John Starkie, beingcast and held down on a bed, was most fearfully tormented, and as painedin his stomach and pulled in his belly, heaving and lifting, as if his heartwould burst. Whereupon he shed many bitter tears. And so he continued,sometimes crying out exceedingly loudly in these tormenting fits to thegreat grief of the beholders. And while we laboured to comfort them byexhortations, we were scorned by the first three that lay by on beds in everygood word that we spoke. And they would take it into their mouths, andmock it. When we called for the Bible, they fell to laughing at it, and said,‘Reach them the Bibble bable, bibble babbell.’ It went so round in theirmouths from one to another, and continued with many other scornings andfilthy speeches that we could not stop. Thereupon we proposed to leavethem for a while, again exhorting John Starkie to trust in the Lord, to bepatient in that affliction, and to pray to God. And we desired him to sayafter us The Lord’s Prayer. But he was the more tormented a great deal,and not a word could he speak. But that scorner that lay next him did sayThe Lord’s Prayer after us, misnaming every word as far as we went in it.For when we perceived such horrible blasphemy, we dared not proceed."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven225But we gave up before we ever came to the end, being exceedingly grieved,that they had despised such holy things like dogs and swine, that would, ifthey could, have turned again and all to rent us. Whereupon we were forcedto give place to the Devil, who indeed at this time bestirred himself. Heworked mightily such torments and such troubles in all the possessed, withsuch outrageous spite and contempt, I am persuaded, the like of whichwas seldom or never seen. And all of this was intended to discourage us inthat skirmish, to drive us out of the field and, if it were possible, not to dareto set on him any more.The truth is, we were greatly discouraged at that time, not knowingwell what to do. We left them so, having spent a good while with them.And we went into a garden to refresh ourselves. It grew towards suppertime.We were requested to come in and, being set at supper, Master Dickoms,whom we had sent for, came in. We told him what strange things had fallenout since our coming thither, and of our purpose to fast and pray with thefamily, if he would join with us. This thing he was very ready to do. Andhaving decided also to prepare the family thereunto, we went about it. Havingthe whole family together, and divers honest neighbours for the holdingand tending of the possessed, we made entrance into the preparation, whichwas by way of exhortation. We found them very loud, forward, and roughto deal with, to such an extent that we could hardly get an audience. Butwe perceived the great malice and spite of the Devil that wrought againstus, labouring violently to trouble us that we might again give up the workas we had done before. We were provoked in this respect with great zeal topray against him, and with all the desires of our souls to entreat the Lordto put the Devil to silence, and that he would charge and command the evilspirits to hold their peace so that we might both have good audience inpraying and speaking the Word, and also perform all other duties profitablywithout hindrance. This came to pass accordingly. For we found the Lordnear and ready to hear us. He presently showed his power in commandingSatan to silence and to be still. And they obeyed him, for there followedagreat calm. So we went forward, performing that service which remainedwith much comfort. This preparation being finished, by this time it drewtoward midnight. We all went to bed to take some rest, that being thereby"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"226Demonic Possession and Exorcismrefreshed, we might be the better able to perform a greater service the nextday. We had bound ourselves to this, being exceedingly encouraged to seton it with sure hope of the victory, in that the Lord had put the pawn andpledge of it into our hands overnight, giving us such plain experience bothof his presence and of his power. By reason whereof, our faith gatheredgreat strength that, seeing the Lord had blessed our endeavour thus far inthe entrance and given us such good success in the preparation, he wouldnot fail to be present with us in the battle itself, to show his power and towork with us till we had trodden Satan under our feet. Therefore, whenthe morning came, we prepared ourselves in the best way that we could,that that holy exercise of fasting and prayer might be performed both byourselves and all that should join with us therein, with most fruit, that wemight attain to the mark that we set before us, namely, the confoundingof Satan and the full deliverance of the possessed. There was also greatpreparation in the family to set all things in good order, that we might notbe troubled in the work. And having a fair large parlour already trimmed, theybrought in thither certain beds or couches, on which they laid the seven sickpossessed persons. All this while, the honest neighbours nearby comingin, the room filled apace, some holding and tending the sick possessed,and some sitting by. It was now about seven o’clock, and all things weremade ready. The parties were still being troubled. Their torments were stillincreasing and their fits doubling on them. Sometimes, they were eitherhowling or crying, or else lifting, heaving, or vomiting, or else scorningor railing, or cast into a trance which was always at the end of their fits,being like a time to catch their breaths, and then to it again. The sight andhearing of these things was so wonderful that a man cannot possibly comenear to describing it. Nor was there ever such a thing seen in our days norin the days of our fathers, such a number in one place lying in such a fearfulmanner, so miserably vexed by the Devil. We could not choose but beexceedingly affected with great sorrow and grief in compassion for theirmiseries, which provoked us to offer up our prayers with strong cryingand tears to God who was able to hear and to save us from that which wefeared."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven227With such reverence as was meet, we then began the exercise of humblingour souls to God, in the mediation of Jesus Christ. And by the directionof the Holy Ghost, we proceeded in the work till it was finished. In thisproceeding, it is fit to observe divers strange events which happened. Forthe possessed, being of divers kinds, we had more ado with them. For fourof them were possessed with scorning spirits and quite bereft of the rightuse of their senses. We were much more troubled with them than with theother three who were ever very sober, though they were very sore tormented.And yet through the great mercy of God, after we had made a beginning,God bridled the rage of Satan and so restrained his fury, that after he hadmade his flourish in the beginning and showed his power, as then he will dothe worst he can, it pleased God, as before in our preparation overnight, soin the exercise itself where many were assembled together, to make themall quiet and to keep them all in order. Thus, from seven o’clock in themorning till three o’clock in the afternoon, we went forward without anygreat interruption save that, now and then, some of them had some suddenfit for the space of half a quarter of an hour which, being ended, we went on.We still perceived the Lord working with us, giving us oftentimes sundrysigns of the victory, whereby we were much encouraged. For in the firstsermon, whilst Master Dickoms was preaching, Margaret Hardman, whowas the principal and chief of the scorners, was plainly heard, both by someof the preachers and of the people, to use these words oftentimes, ‘I mustbe gone, I must be gone, whither will I go? Whither will I go? I will not die,Iwill not die,’ repeating over again and again the same thing, half a dozentimes at the least, in a fine low voice and in the tune of singing.After this, there appeared no great distraction till three o’clock in theafternoon. And toward the end of my sermon, as the Discoverer has revealed,the above named Margaret Hardman was heard again to utter these words,‘I cannot tarry, I cannot tarry, I am too hot, I am too hot, let me go, letme go.’ These words gave us this comfort, that Satan would not long keephis hold. For he was so heated by fasting and prayer, and by the word ofGod so zealously and powerfully applied, as if fire were put into his holeto burn him out. For hereupon, before the sermon was or could be ended,"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"228Demonic Possession and Exorcismshe with all the rest broke out into exceedingly loud cries, all seven roaringand bellowing in such extreme and fearful manner that they troubled us all,being so violent and outrageous that they had much ado to be held. ForSatan then being ready to depart, did first vex all the veins of their heartsand did so torment them, that they were forced to lay about them with bothhands and feet, to pull their hair and to rent their clothes, to knock theirheads and to strike themselves, crying out with open mouths and roaringas if they were mad.Then was there such struggling and striving between us and those sevendevils, crying out so loudly with such violence and extension of voice,labouring who should be loudest, till our voices were spent and no strengthalmost left in us. This battle continued very nearly the space of two hours,till we were exceedingly weakened with long and loud crying up to Heaven.But it pleased God to weaken Satan’s power much more, and to tread the evilSpirits under our feet. And thus much may serve to show, what beginningwe made in this work, and how we proceeded therein, and that our wholecourse and carriage held in this cause thus far may clear us, that we neithersought work nor set ourselves to work, though we be charged so to do bythisDiscovery,asmay appear by the scope of the whole last chapter of thefirst book. Neither in dealing with these strange afflictions, have we usedeither delusions, jug-glings, exorcisms, or any such vainand ridiculous fooleries as they havedetected in the popish priests, noryet any such lightness as shouldbe condemned by men thatmeddle with mattersof such moment.The fourth partNow, it follows in the fourth place, to describe briefly the means and mannerof the dispossession of these seven persons, so that it may appear that Master"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven229Darrell was neither the only, nor yet the principal agent therein, contraryto that which the Discoverer falsely reports of him, chapter 1, page 2,namely, that though he had gloried in two exploits, yet his name was not sofamous till he had dispossessed seven persons in Master Starkie’s house atone clap. And for proof hereof, they allege the story of the boy of Burton,in the end of which book it is thus written, viz., ‘Shortly you will have thetrue story come forth of those seven in Lancashire, that were possessedwith unclean spirits, and all seven delivered at one time by this man.’34Andthe more to confirm this, they allege Master Darrell’s own testimony inhis answer to the six articles of his examination, quoted in the margin,thereupon inferring thus, ‘By this man,’ meaning Master Darrell, ‘as hehimself has confessed.’ I will therefore first set down the truth concerningtheir deliverance, and prove after that Master Darrell is made the principalin this action by this Discoverer, but only under a pretence, and for a furtherstratagem.For the truth, first, you have heard already, that we were three preachersthat exercised that day, of whom I was the last. And indeed in the latter endof my sermon, as the Discoverer has revealed, they grew to be so strongthat they could very hardly be held down on their beds, though they had lainbefore reasonably quiet.But chiefly one of them, namely Jane Ashton, being both the strongestand worst of all the rest, was also more violently vexed, having her fits sosorely and so thickly, that we feared she would either have fainted and fallendown, or else have yielded to Satan, who laboured mightily to make herworkable to his purpose. Whereupon Master Darrell and Master Dickoms,the other preacher that joined with us, being much affected with her miseryas by force of her fits, had her forcibly carried aside from the rest. Theyboth attended on her, striving with all their power to uphold and strengthenher.In the meantime, the other six, being sorely tormented and struggling withthose that minded them, were got from them and were tumbled from theirpallets to the floor and near to the fire side where, by the good providence of34Seeabove, p.191."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"230Demonic Possession and ExorcismGod, I was brought, even into the midst of them. And there, being assistedwith the prayers of their parents and the people, we earnestly entreated theLord for them, with strong and mighty cries. And it pleased God to hearus at that instant. For those six were all suddenly strangely and fearfullycast down before us, where they lay all six alongside one another altogethersenseless, their bodies stiff and stretched out, as if they had been stark dead,for the space of half a quarter of an hour.In this time, Master Dickoms came to me. And he saw all of them laidas dead, and how they rose up again one after another in order as they fell,acknowledging that they were freed from the evil spirit, and that he wasdeparted from them.Whereupon every one, on their own, with great joy and gladness of heart,gave thanks to God for that benefit.All this while, Master Darrell was with the other maid, standing at a greatwindow in another part of the parlour, which was both long and large, sothat he neither saw nor heard of the deliverance of these six. He neitherknew when they were cast down, nor when they rose up, nor once suspectedany such thing until such time as they, being perfectly restored, stood ontheir feet, leaping and dancing and praising God. We also were all filled withexceeding joy, which was testified by shouting and clapping of hands, sothat the earth rang with the praises of God, and the whole house was filledwith the sound thereof.Now the diligent observing of the state and condition of these six personsin one hour: what violent passions and extreme outrage they were in for thebeginning of the hour, driven and drawn to cry and roar with all madness andfury, and to do they knew not what; and then, secondly, in the last part ofthe hour, to be quite changed into another condition, carried as it were withall force and violence into other contrary extremities of unspeakable andexcessive joys the best way, to be so suddenly brought from the bondageand torture of Satan into the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters ofGod. By these signs and sudden change, it is most evident that the firststate is so manifest the work of Satan, and the second so cleared to be thework of God, that it cannot possibly be the work of flesh and blood, neithercould it be counterfeited by any man. For I am persuaded that if six of the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven231most cunning wits that be in the world would join their heads together tomake another such work, yet they could not deceive the senses of suchmen as had seen by experience, and had made some trial of these strangeand great works. For they could quickly discern their close juggling andcrafty conveyance to be but delusions and hypocrisy, and so would theirwickedness be manifested to all men.By this it may appear that Master Darrell was not the principal or chiefactor in their dispossession. Nor can he indeed be so accounted, seeingthat at the very time while we were crying to the Lord for these six, hewas separated to another work and busily employed another way, namely,instructing, comforting and strengthening the maid, who remained all thiswhile miserably vexed by the Devil.Whereupon, at our being there, he complained to me concerning thedispossession of these six and told me that he saw never a one of them whenthey were delivered which, he said, grieved him exceedingly.After this also, I confess that to be true which the Discoverer has dis-closed book 1, chapter 10, page 56, namely, that I took all these six tome and exhorted them to continue in the fear of God, telling them thatSatan would seek to enter into them again. I admonished them to resisthim by faith and prayer, and by putting on all the whole armour of God,encouraging them by all means to stand fast, saying thus to them, ‘If youdo manfully resist, no doubt but you shall see that Satan will fly, not beingable to do you any harm.’And as they regarded well this counsel, so it pleased God to bless itaccordingly. For he gave them such strength and courage, though five ofthem were but children, that they did most strongly resist him, so that thoughhis assaults were usually very fierce and importunate for the present, yetcould he not prevail with the least to yield to him. And so hitherto they haveall six been preserved both safe and sound, without any further molestation,to the great praise and glory of God.Now while I was thus employed about those six, Master Darrell tookgreat pains with the maid, hoping still that she would have been dispos-sessed that night also. But it came not so to pass. Whereupon, through thedeceitfulness of Satan who had drawn her to dissemble and brought her"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"232Demonic Possession and Exorcismto an impudent outfacing of the truth, we were driven to give up for thattime, intending in the morning to renew the exercise of fasting and prayeron the behalf of that maid only. When we had entered into this, she wasmore sorely vexed and tormented than ever she was before till it was aboutnoon or one o’clock. About this time, she also, through the great mercy ofGod, received help and deliverance.For when we had all three in order performed this duty of prayer, shehaving wrought us all one after another till we were weary, when it cameto my turn the last time, having continued sometime, I desired another totake my place. When the maid heard this, she suddenly caught me by thehand, held me fast, and said to me, ‘No, for God’s sake, do not leave meyet. Stick to it a little longer, and you will see that he will depart shortly.’Hereupon, receiving this good encouragement, I continued still. Andwith the joint assistance of the rest, we earnestly entreated the Lord forher. So it was not long before she was cast into a trance, lying as if shehad been fast asleep. Anon, she burst out into weeping so that the tearstrickled down her cheeks apace in a very extraordinary manner. After this,she presently rose up, and thanked God that the evil spirit was departedfrom her.She also, being violently assaulted by the Devil, resisted manfully as therest did, and likewise prevailed, and so was by the mercy of God preservedduring all the time she was in her Mistress’s house. But afterward shedeparted thence. And she dwelt with her uncle, a Papist, in the furthestpart of Lancashire, where there resorted to her certain seminary priests, bywhose conjurations and magical enchantments, as it is reported, the evilspirit was brought into her again. Since this time, she has been exceedinglytormented, and so, like Sommers, continues still repossessed.As therefore the good providence of God may be discerned in the dis-posing of all things, so also it shows itself most clearly in the well orderingof this whole action, if it be well observed: First, in sending me with Mas-ter Darrell to be a witness of those strange and unwonted works of God;secondly, in not using Master Darrell as the chief instrument, neither forthe dispossessing of the six the first day, nor yet for the deliverance ofthe seventh on the second day; thirdly, in that without his labor they were"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven233prepared by faith and prayer and other spiritual armour to resist the evilspirit, by means whereof they were preserved from repossession.For if Master Darrell had been the most chief in dispossessing of theseseven and of Thomas Darling, as he was of other two, namely KatherineWright and of William Sommers, then surely it would have been thoughtthat he had had some special gift that way above other men, and this Dis-coverer might have had the greater show of advantage in charging him sodeeply and so often with that matter.For which cause, without question, it pleased God to prevent him inthese seven. And as for Thomas Darling, Master Darrell only gave adviceto his friends to fast and pray, and humble themselves on his behalf, andso they did. Neither he nor any other preacher being present, it pleasedGod at their prayers, being but nine or ten simple people to be entreated,and to deliver the party from that possession. The result was that, by diversand sundry experiments, it might appear to all the world that this is noextraordinary gift peculiar to any one man, but common to all the faithfulas well to one as to another. And the mean and simple people have as greatprivilege and power to cast out Satan by their faith and fasting and ferventprayer, as either he, or I, or the best and chiefest preacher.Out of the premises then, it may be inferred that, if there be any evil inthis work, it is rather to be imputed to me than to Master Darrell. For intruth, as the Lord lives, there is no occasion of evil in him concerning thismatter. For if he had wrought craftily at other times and practised deceit,why would it not have appeared and broken out as well in dealing with theseseven as in other places? But I am persuaded, such is his simplicity, that heis as clear and was ever as free from counterfeiting as I myself am. And Idare boldly protest, even before the Lord, that such a thought came neveronce into my mind.Now howsoever it might seem more expedient for me to be silent inthese things least I should seem or be taken even as a fool in boasting myself,yet herein I may say with the apostle, you have even compelled me.35Forindeed, so great is the inconvenience that has come by the misconceiving352Corinthians12.11."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"234Demonic Possession and Exorcismand misreporting of this matter of fact, that it has enforced a necessity ofmanifesting the truth thereof in the plainest manner which yet hitherto,for modesty’s sake, has been suppressed for the space of three years, andlikely never to have come to light, if our innocence could have been clearedwithout it.But now I must return to the Discoverer and proceed to perform mypromise, which is, to prove that the purpose of the detector, to make MasterDarrell the principal agent in this dispossession, is only under a pretenceand not that he is so persuaded. My reasons are these. First, to pretendMaster Darrell to be principal in this as well as in all the rest is great policy.For under this pretence, all that they charge him with concerning teachingof Sommers has the greater colour of truth. Secondly, by enforcing this, asthey do much in their book, it does more easily persuade men to believe thathe is a very common and lewd practicer and deceiver. Thirdly, by this title ofprincipal and in all places where he comes to be the chiefest, it presupposesan extraordinary juggling skill, and a singular cunning in legerdemain, asthey term it. Whereupon they say that when he began with Katherine Wright,then he dealt but rudely and unskillfully, but after he had practised withThomas Darling and the seven of Lancashire, then he was his craft’s master.Fourthly, it helps to justify that accusation of vain glory, and that he desiresto have a great name and to make himself famous, or else that he is the onlyman that has a peculiar prerogative to cast out devils above all men, seeingthat wheresoever he comes, he bears away the bell, as they say, and that nobody can do the feat but he. Fifthly, under this pretence, they may with lessprejudice proceed against him, seeing that in four several actions, thoughthey find some accessories, yet they find none principal but himself. Andthus policy has preferred him to be principal, when indeed they know he isnot, so of purpose to do him a mischief, and to dishonour the cause itself,even the great work of God.And that they are not persuaded that he is the principal in this work, it maythus appear: Because they have the story of this matter of Lancashire pennedby Master Dickoms, as is plainly confessed and proved in theDiscovery,wherein the dispossession of these seven is most plainly described withthe circumstances thereof, according to that which I have here set down."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven235And therein, Master Darrell, except that he was the man that was sent forto come, and principally aimed at, is made equal. Concerning this book,Ispeak that which I know, for I was examined in that whole story out ofit, from the beginning to the end. And yet the Discoverer will take noknowledge of this matter which is written there, though it be most sureand certain, because it makes against him, and takes the rash testimony ofthe printer, which spoke only as he heard that Master Darrell was the man.And as for Master Darrell himself in his testimony, it was either mistakenor misreported. For I dare say that he would not say that those seven weredelivered or dispossessed by him principally. Yet theDiscoveryurgesboth these testimonies to the full, because they seem much to make forhim in all the former respects.If then, this may be received for the truth, as indeed it is, I doubt notbut that all suspicion of counterfeiting and conjuring, and of all other baddealing wherewith we have been most unjustly charged, may be removed, asmay also that gross error, which is too, too common, of ascribing any giftor extraordinary power of casting out devils to any one man more than toanother, be both vanquished and suppressed. For herein all men may mostclearly see that the good hand of God, in blessing his own ordinance, andthe poor endeavours of his servants, is the only inward and efficient causeof this great work of dispossession, that so all the glory there-of may wholly and only be ascribedto him who works allthings, according to thepleasure of his own will,to whom be praisefor ever.The last partNow it follows, last of all, to set down the signs of dispossession shownforth by these seven immediately before their deliverance, in, and after thesame. And therewith also briefly to show the return of the spirits being cast"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"236Demonic Possession and Exorcismout, how sundry times and divers ways, by many strange and fearful assaults,they seek to re-enter. This also may serve as an answer to that proof oftheDiscoverycontained in the ninth and tenth chapters touching thosepoints, so that these signs being conferred according to divine and historicalobservation, those that be indifferently minded may be able to judge whatcause they have to scorn these signs, and to sport themselves with them asthey do.The first sign to manifest these dispossessed was that the spirits did rentand tear the possessed, insomuch that they were more sorely vexed andtormented immediately before they left them, and even as it were at theirdeparture, than ever they were at any time before. So it is said, when Christcharged the spirit to come out of the child, then the spirit rent him sorely,and afterwards came out, Mark 9.26.The second sign is that they cried out with loud voices, and roared outexceedingly after the manner of beasts, most fearful and lamentable to hear,being never so fierce and outrageous in any of their fits, as even then whenthe spirits were forced and compelled to come out of them. And of thissign it is thus written, that unclean sprits, crying with a loud voice, cameout of many that were possessed, Acts 8.7.Thirdly, they were cast down suddenly and lay all along stretched out asif they had been dead. And so leaving them as dead, the evil spirits departedfrom them. And thus it is written of the child whom Christ dispossessed,when the unclean spirit came out, he was as one dead, insomuch that manysaid, ‘he is dead,’ Mark 9.26.Fourthly, the evil spirits departed out of the possessed in the likeness ofsome ugly creature. And every one of the seven saw and perceived the spiritsto depart out in a several likeness. One was in the likeness of a crow’s head,round, which when it was out, went and sat in a corner of the parlour, withdarkness about it a while. Then it went out of the window with such a flashof lightning that all the parlour seemed to her to be alight with fire. It leftalso behind it in the maid a sore throat, and a most filthy smell, insomuchthat her meat was very unsavoury for a week after.3636[Margaret Byrom]."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven237Another said that it went out like a man with a great hunch on his back,as big as a man, very evil favoured and ugly to behold.37The third saw him go out like an urchin or hedgehog. And he crept out,as she thought, at a very little hole of the window.38The fourth, like a foul ugly man with a white beard and a great bulge onhis breast, bigger than a man’s head.39The fifth, like a black man, or like the fourth as aforesaid.40The sixth perceived it to go out in the likeness of a great breath, ugly likeatoad, and round like a ball.41The last, like an ugly man with a great hunch on his back, &c.42Fifthly, the evil spirits did presently return to them again in the samelikeness that they went out, and sought to re-enter. And being resisted, theydeparted. And then they returned after in other likenesses seeking still,both by promises and threatenings, to prevail. Sometimes the spirit in thelikeness of a man proffering bags of gold and silver, and showing them allmanner of costly and sumptuous things, tempting them thereby to yield tohim, and to let him in, enforcing his temptations by promising of honoursand pleasures, and great preferments. Of the return of the spirit when he iscast out, and his seeking to re-enter, we read in Matthew 12, Luke 11.43And for his diversity of temptations and large offers to prevail, it is evidentin his dealing against Christ, Matthew 4. In these assaults to re-enter, thespirits appeared sometimes in the likeness of a bear with open mouth,sometimes of an ape, sometimes of a big black dog, sometimes of a blackraven with a yellow bill, sometimes of a flame of fire, sometimes of diverswhelps. But most usually they appeared in the likeness of Edmond Hartley,aconjurer who had bewitched them, and was also hanged at Lancaster forthat fact, and for conjuring. In these apparitions, if he could not prevailwith his large offers and fair promises, then he would terrify them withvery fearful threatenings, that he would cast them into pits, or break theirnecks, or some other way to plague them, saying that they would neverprosper.37[John Starkie].38[Ellinor Hurdman].39[Anne Starkie].40[Ellen Holland].41[Jane Ashton].42[Margaret Hurdman].43Mt.12.43–5;Lk.11.24–6."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"238Demonic Possession and ExorcismWhereupon, when he saw that, in assaulting of them, he lost all hislabour and prevailed not, he laboured at the length to be revenged of themfor resisting of him. To which purpose, he did trouble them in all the partsof their bodies, in their eyes, with many uncomfortable sights, to terrifythem. He tied their tongues that they could not pray, nor speak as theyshould. He pinched them in their arms, so that they could not lift them up,nor stir them for a good time. He pricked them in their knees and in theirlegs so that they could not walk, or yet if they did walk, that then they wentlame and limping for an hour or two together, and could not possibly goupright. They had pain also in their feet and in their head. Thus they weremolested. But still they so resisted that they gave him the foil, so that inthe end he was forced to leave them and to flee away.Sixthly, they being all dispossessed by fasting and prayer according tothe ordinance of Christ, since that time all their swellings and tormentshave ceased, neither have they been troubled nor vexed with any more fits.Only Jane Ashton, repossessed, has manifested the same by sundry fearfulsigns, and is now become worse in every way than she was. But as for therest, they have continued now for the space of two years and a half verypeaceably and quietly. Nor have they shown forth any sign of possession,nor any suspicion thereof.Lastly, they all gave great thanks to God for their deliverance, and that ofthemselves so freely and cheerfully in so excellent and heavenly a manner,so that they could never do the like, neither before, nor since. They are alsoso changed in their conditions, and their manners so well reformed, that aman will hear no evil come from them, nor any unseemly behaviour. Andnow they can pray and take delight in praising God. They go to church tohear the word, and continue there with much comfort, and are every waybetter than they were before.And thus I have finished this discourse, wherein I have dealt faithfullyto my power, and whereby I have detected this Discoverer to be a greatdeceiver, like a traveller that takes on him to discover divers countrieswherein he never came, and to describe the state and people of certain newfound lands, the situation whereof he never knew nor heard of, only a mere"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The story of the Lancashire seven239fiction of his own invention.

John Darrell was out of prisonbut in hiding some two years after. Darrell had been convicted, upon theword of William Sommers, that he had taught Sommers how to counterfeitpossession when Sommers was a young man of around nineteen or twentyyears of age.Abrief Narrationis the first of thirteen works, the publication of whichwas motivated by the case of Sommers and the trial of Darrell.2Itbeginswith an editorial introduction by a George Cole, written after the trialof Darrell. A narrative account of the possession of William Sommers isfollowed by a series of arguments for the genuine possession of Sommersagainst reasons to the contrary which were written between the Archbishopof York’s Commission in March1598and Darrell’s trial in June of that year.3These two sections may have originally come from the pen of John Darrellin prison. The text concludes with a number of depositions given at theYorkCommission by witnesses to Sommers’ behaviour as a demoniac.Because of the large number of texts around the story of William Som-mers, and the controversy surrounding the case, it is difficult to constructthe story. But the broad outline inAbrief Narrationis consistent withother accounts. In early October1597,William Sommers, apprenticed to amusician in Nottingham, began to throw fits which suggested he was pos-sessed.

Darrell was persuaded that ‘Satan would notgive him over, until in the end he had repossessed him.’4Mr Aldridge, thevicar of the church, reported that the people became offended ‘with thehearing of, nothing in his sermons, but of the Devil.’5Ithad become important to Darrell’s credibility that Sommers should berepossessed.

One of these was Doll or Alice Freeman, cousin to a MrFreeman, who was an Alderman of Nottingham.6Shehad also been namedas a witch by Mary Cooper, Sommers’ sister, who had also become pos-sessed. Alice was eventually acquitted in April1598.But in the meantime,Freeman attacked Sommers, accusing him of having bewitched to death acertain Sterland of Swenton.7InJanuary1598,Sommers was committedto prison. He was soon released on bail, but confined in an institution,StJohn’s, in the care of John Cooper and Nicholas Shepherd.8Thenbegan the long series of possessions, confessions of counterfeiting, andre-possessions which were to characterise Sommers’ career as a demoniacfrom this point.Crucial to the defense of Sommers’ authenticity and Darrell’s credibilitywas the claim that Sommers’ confessions of fraud were made under physicalduress, and more importantly, under demonic persuasion: ‘Sommers wascommitted to prison, where the Devil appeared to him in likeness of amouse, threatening that if he would not let him re-enter, and would notsay that all he had done touching his tormenting during his possessionwas but counterfeit, then he would be hanged. But if he would yield tohim, he would save him.’9Thus, it could be argued by those who believedSommers was genuinely possessed that his confessions and his simulationsof possession were themselves an aspect of his possession. To his detractors,his confessions and his ability to simulate his fits became the crucial evidencein constructing all of his behaviour as fraudulent.

The depositions contained inAbrief Narra-tionweretaken at this time. Sommers was called before the Commissionand confessed that he was a counterfeit. He then proceeded to act so con-vincingly as a demoniac that the Commission concluded he was genuinelypossessed.11Sommers rejected his former confession: ‘being come to him-self, he did confess his possession and gave himself body and soul to theDevil, if he did counterfeit’.12Dissatisfied with the outcome of the YorkCommission, the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, summonedDarrell to London to be examined by the Commissioners for EcclesiasticalCauses, and there imprisoned him, along with George More.Abrief Narrationtells us that Sommers accused Darrell, not only ofhaving conspired with him in Nottingham, but of having trained him as acounterfeit demoniac as early as1592in Ashby, all of which Darrell denied.13Itdoes not tell us that Katherine Wright and Thomas Darling were alsosummoned as witnesses, confessed to fraud, and to having been trained byDarrell in simulating possession. But it does make the point that a manwhose character had never before been questioned was condemned by theword of a young man about whose integrity there was serious doubt: ‘butSommers’ bare word, now grown to be a man of great credit, though he hadconfessed himself heretofore to have been a counterfeit, was better believedthan Master Darrell, a godly and faithful man of honest conversation, longapproved by the best Christians and ministers where he lived’.14There can be little doubt that, even by Elizabethan standards, Darrellwas treated unfairly, not least in not being allowed to present a defence,to have the Nottingham depositions included, nor to have Sommers sim-ulate some of the more extraordinary features of his demoniacal behaviourmentioned in the depositions – particularly the rare though not uniquefeature of the running lump. On the other hand, Darrell’s sincerity vergedon gullibility. Sommers was given ample opportunity to ‘pick up’ demoni-acal behaviour from Darrell’s public utterances.

If, I say, all these things werefully discovered and well weighed, doubtless a man must needs be aston-ished and expect a rarer event of these things than can be yet conceived.Aman must needs be equally astonished by the way the Providence ofour merciful and heavenly Father is to be wisely observed and with greathumility to be reverenced, that he has allowed this matter to be called inquestion, and for so long time to be ventilated and scrutinized as it hasbeen. Doubtless, as we have experience of our dullness in apprehendingand profitably meditating on other marvellous acts of the Lord daily shownbefore our eyes, so if this work had not been mightily impugned, we wouldalso have negligently flipped over it and the residue of like nature latelyperformed, without yielding such due honour to God and to the powerfulexercises of prayer and fasting as appertains.

I pray, consider with me a little these circumstances and proceed-ings, and impartially consider with whom the right stands. Master Darrelland Master More, who are now imprisoned for giving testimony to thistruth, have been both of them for many years approved godly ministers, justand simple hearted men, fearing God, of good reputation among the bestChristians, and diligent preachers where they lived. God has marvellouslyblessed their joint labours in dispossessing seven persons together in Lan-cashire, which is so notorious and free from challenge that the enemiesto this action of Nottingham dare not once to call it into question. ThePapists take knowledge of the possession and dispossession in Lancashire.But they would fain have us believe that their seminary Priests were theonly actors. Yea, this fancy has taken such impression in them that someof them have not doubted to say, if it can be proved that Master More, andMaster Darrell did perform that work, they would disclaim their religionand embrace ours. They that have accused and prosecuted against MasterDarrell are men that have blasphemed the Scriptures, Popish persons, andknown enemies to the preaching of the Gospel.

He was putto silence by the Archbishop of York without sufficient cause warrantedby law.

Some stormed that anyshould be present as witnesses to their doings. They would not allow one ofthe depositions to be read before them. The Commissioners and deponentswere contemptuously rejected. A charge was given that no copies of thedepositions should be divulged. Imprisonment was threatened to divers,only because they were acquainted with Master More, saying none oughtto be favoured that were disgraced before them. Master Darrell, having butone copy of the depositions, delivered it to them for their satisfaction. And,though they promised him that it would be returned when his wife requiredit, they threatened her with Bridewell.18There has been running to the courtto forestall the Lords and Ladies of honour, and to hinder the presentingof petitions on Master Darrell’s behalf to the right Honourable Lords ofthe Privy Council. And because Thomas Darling, a boy of Burton on Trentof the age of fifteen years or thereabouts, had been dispossessed by prayeron advice taken from Master Darrell, as appears by a book published someyears ago, in hatred of Master Darrell, the books were called in and theprinter imprisoned as if he had published a fined matter. Master Bainbridge,agentleman of good reckoning in Derbyshire, was required by the Bishopof London to show his opinion touching the said Darling. He answered thatit was the common voice of the country, which he believed to be true, thathe was indeed possessed and dispossessed. The Bishop told him in greatanger that if he had not heard well of him, he would clap him in prison for sosaying. Thus having dealt with the printer and Master Bainbridge, he thenthought meet to examine the matter perhaps to see whether he had donewell or not, thus to determine, and then to hear. So he sent a pursuivant19for the boy of Burton. The pursuivant, having received forty shillings fromthe boy’s friends, the boy was kept in the Bishop of London’s house andcommitted to the tuition of Master Harsnett who lately had been vomited18That is, with prison.19Awarrant officer."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"248Demonic Possession and Exorcismout of Cambridge for his erroneous opinions. None of the boy’s friendswere allowed to come to him. He was allured by promises, terrified bythreatenings such as that he would be hanged as the Burgundian was, whomthey showed to him, hanging at London all a day long for a murder. Also itwas threatened that he would be whipped and laid in Newgate. He was a closeprisoner in a chamber two days, the boy of Nottingham appointed for hiskeeper, who with the profane serving men were always scorning him, beingastranger among them. Letters were contrived in Master Darrell’s name tohim, willing him to acknowledge a counterfeit possession. And letters werereturned by him wherein he protested the truth, and would not in any waybe removed from it. All this was practiced to heap shame, if it might be, onMaster Darrell. But when they perceived that the power of God in the boywas stronger than the malice of Satan, they let him go. But I do not hear thatthe forty shillings was again restored. Not finding any help herein to proveMaster Darrell a practitioner in counterfeiting with this boy of Burton,aCommission was directed to five persons in Nottingham, Satan couldnot have wished better, that is, to the very same men who have persecutedMaster Darrell at Nottingham, York, and London ever since this mattercame in question. This was to dispute the former depositions taken byvirtue of a Commission awarded from York as is set forth in this treatise. Itfell out that Robert Cooper, the Clerk of St Mary’s in Nottingham causedthe ninety fourth Psalm to be sung before these Commissioners sat inCommission.

These proper Commissioners refused such as were willingto justify the truth on their oaths. They picked out whom they wished, andwrote what pleased them. When they were to examine Master Aldridgeand his curate, they caused them to swear that they would not reveal toany others the things whereof they should be deposed.

And he gave great signs that hewas possessed by a wicked spirit, whereupon the Mayor and some of thealdermen of Nottingham, understanding that Master Darrell, a ministerof God’s word dwelling in Ashby de la Zouche, had by prayer and fastingrestored eight or nine persons that in like sort had been vexed, did instantlysend for the said Master Darrell to come to Nottingham to take some painsabout the said Sommers. This he refused to yield to sundry times, becausehe took on himself no greater power in such cases than was incident to anygodly minister, or other persons, which was only to entreat the Lord in thename of Christ Jesus to dispossess the wicked spirit out of the possessedperson. Yet, by their importunate letters and messengers, he condescendedto their desires.

The seventh day of November, being Monday was appointed forthe exercise of prayer and fasting, to the end that the said Sommers might bedispossessed, which Almighty God, only at the prayers of Master Darrelland others to the number of one hundred and fifty persons brought to pass.Whereupon Master Darrell was retained as preacher in Nottingham, thatpopulous town, having had no settled preacher before this time since thebeginning of her Majesty’s reign. Sommers, being dispossessed, revealedcertain witches, whereof one was called Doll Freeman, allied to one Freemanan alderman of Nottingham. This Freeman, offended that his kinswomanshould be called in question, threatened Sommers that he was a witch,laying to his charge some presumptions tending that way. Sommers wascommitted to prison, where the Devil appeared to him in the likeness of amouse, threatening that if he would not let him21re-enter, and would not saythat all that he had done touching his tormenting during his possession wasbut counterfeit, then he would be hanged. But if he would yield to him, hewould save him. Thus a new stipulation being made between them, the Devilentered. And afterwards Sommers still pretended that all which before hehad done was only counterfeit. Yet this notwithstanding, on his repossessionhe was horribly, in spite of his face, tormented as before, as appears fromdivers of the deponents if the time when the things which they deposed weredone be well observed. To search into the truth hereof, a Commission wasawarded from the high Commissioners for the province of York to certifythe matter to twelve principal persons of account thereabouts. MasterDarrell had taken the names of three score persons who were ready to havebeen deposed touching the extraordinary handling of the said Sommers.Seventeen of them being sworn, examined, and their depositions taken,Sommers was called before the Commissioners to be examined himself,whether he had counterfeited or not. He told them that all that he didwas but counterfeit. The High Sheriff exhorted him in the name of God21[That the Devil desires to re-enter is proved by Matthew12.42and Mark9.25,and by experience,and from Thyraeus,de Daemoniacis,part4,chapter1,sections6–7.] The reference to Matthew’sGospel should be to12.44–5.The work of Petrus Thyraeus isDaemoniaci cum Locis Infestis(Cologne,1598)."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The story of William Sommers251to tell the truth. Then suddenly Sommers was violently cast into one ofhis fits before them all, where he wallowed up and down the chamberwhere they sat in a fearful manner. There were pins thrust deep into hishand and leg to test if he did counterfeit. But he was senseless, and noblood flowed. At length being recovered as out of sleep, they asked whathe had done. He said that he could not tell. Whether he had not beenpricked with pins, he said, ‘Yes.’ They asked where, and he showed thewrong hand. When he was examined, how the hole came in his other handwhich had been pricked, he said that it was there before. Being demanded,why he fell down, he answered that a pain came over his stomach. Thenhe was conveyed away. And being absent, he was worse tormented thanbefore. They brought him back again to know if he would confess whopersuaded him to say he had counterfeited. As he went up a set of stairsthrough a gallery, if he had not been stopped, he would have cast himselfheadlong over the gallery in order to break his neck. When he was broughtbefore the Commissioners the second time, he was more terribly handledthan before, inasmuch that the Commissioners and all that were presentwere fully satisfied that he then was corporally possessed. And they ceasedto examine any more witnesses. Master Walton, Archdeacon of Derby,being present, and a principal enemy to Master Darrell, acknowledged itwas the finger of God on this rare accident. Then there was generally greatrejoicing in Nottingham inasmuch as it had pleased God thus to manifestthe truth when it came to trial. After the Commission was returned to York,Sommers was committed to the custody of certain honest persons wherehe was still tormented as before. And in his fits, he said how the Devilhad appeared to him in prison in the likeness of a mouse as aforesaid, andhow the Devil and also certain persons22had advised him to say that hewas but a counterfeit, and what promises they made to him.

These things were taken down in writing by some that heard him.And they are ready to be deposed thereof, if they might be allowed.

Yet he told him that this was his private opinion, and that he wouldwillingly alter it if he might be better informed. But the Archbishop neverendeavoured to inform him better. But after good words, such as that he wasan honest man, &c., he sent him away silenced. The matter thus apprehendedat York, the Commissioners of the province of Canterbury summonedMaster Darrell before them. He appeared for the day and being used withhard speeches, was sent to the Gatehouse. Sommers was brought up toLondon, and committed to a barber of East Smithfield, a man of evilreport.

This one thingalone, if there were nothing else, is sufficient to convince any man whoseheart is not hardened that Sommers did not counterfeit. Much less couldMaster Darrell be an accessory to him in such iniquity. Second, all the signsmentioned in Scripture might more easily be deluded by this conceit ofcounterfeiting than this moveable swelling.41Yet the Devil in those days wasnot so witty as to ascribe all possessions to counterfeiting. But seeing men inthis matter are grown more incredulous then heretofore, it has pleased God,besides the signs of possessions mentioned in Scripture, to give other signsalso, more free from cavil to make his glorious works most apparent andcertain.The kitlings that seemed to move vnder this coverlet, where he laie,was but the motion of his own hand. One put his hand under thecoverlet and caught Sommers’ hand moving.42First, if this be truethen he had five hands in bed with him for there seemed to be five kitlingssometimes, as is deposed by Robert Aldridge.43Second, it may be afterthe time that he pretended to counterfeit. Some confederate of his mightcatch his hand under the coverlet to delude the former accidents. Third,this motion was when Sommers’ hands and feet were held. Deposed byThomas Gray. Fourth, lastly deposed, that the rising up under the coverletbeing felt, it yielded like a bladder full of wind when it is pricked, and filledagain as with wind. And sometimes it tapped, like the foot of a kitling.Those things which he told in his fits to be said and done in hisabsence, he understood by the people who were with him that talkedof such matters, supposing he heard them not.44By the depositions,it is plain that he spoke of things done in his absence, at the instant when hespoke of them, such as that of the examination of Millicent Horseler, andof Master Darrell’s and Master Aldridge’s coming, unknown to any therepresent.4541[Such swelling is observed in others as a sign of possession.

It is deposed by Master Langford that he continued hisfoaming for the space of an hour in such an abundant manner, that the foamdid hang down from his mouth to his breast, notwithstanding that it wascontinually wiped with cloths, in such abundance as to not able to be utteredby any human creature, not having received anything from six in the morningtill five at night to augment it.49When he threw himself into the fire, he knew there were somepresent speedily to rescue him.50He was thrown with such violenceagainst the chimney that they that were present thought that his neck hadbeen broken.51He could not suddenly be taken out of the fire for, it isdeposed, he was of such a weight as is not possible to any natural body. Soas there were three or four forced to join in taking him up, yet he had nothis hair singed, nor was himself hurt.When he fell down before the Commissioners, it was done by theadvice of the Mayor, and some of the aldermen at Nottingham, whopersuaded him to it. And they should have given him a watchwordwhen to rise up, but it was forgotten. Whereby, alas the poor boywas in great pains through the Mayor’s forgetfulness.52First, thenperhaps the Mayor and aldermen were co-plotters in this counterfeiting.53Methinks they should be punished as well as Master Darrell.

However it is an easy matter to delude such as were absentby words, yet the Commissioners being choice men of the country both forlearning and authority could not be deceived by such a paltry companion.For the matter was so apparent to them that they held it superfluous to pro-ceed any further to examination of witnesses, inasmuch as Master Daltonthe Archdeacon confessed it to be the finger of God, and shrunk awayashamed, being convinced with the evidence and demonstration of truth.He says that Master Darrell taught him to counterfeit, and how tobehave himself at the dispossession.54First, this relies on the axiom andinfallible principle whereupon most of the objections are founded, namelythis, ‘Whatsoever Master Sommers says is true.’55He says that MasterDarrell instructed him to counterfeit, &c. Let them prove the proposition,and we will yield the conclusion. As if a godly minister were not better to bebelieved on his oath, than the bare affirmation of a lewd boy whom they saywas a counterfeit. Second, if Master Darrell should say or swear that Som-mers by his teaching can do these things, he were not to be believed. For nonecan by teaching or learning practise impossibilities. Therefore, it is a merevanity to seek to draw Master Darrell into any confederacy in this action,unless they prove these witnesses to be all perjured persons. Third, MasterDarrell never came to him without always also finding company with him.He never, to his knowledge, saw him before the fifth of November, 1597, ashe has deposed. Fourth, why would Master Darrell teach him to counterfeitmore than others, whom he has dealt withal in like cases of dispossession,especially the seven in Lancashire, whereof four were under twelve years,troubled two years before he came to them? Two of them were children ofagentleman of good credit, who was out two hundred pounds of chargesas a result of their possession and could not expect any advantage by givingout that six in his family were vexed by Satan. The procurer of their troublewas indicted and executed for conjuration.

In this, and in other58questions, it is fit to be known what men learned in the law do tell us59thatthe Ecclesiastical Commissioners ought not to determine any matter to beheresy, but only such as has heretofore been determined to be heresy byauthority of the Canonical Scripture, or by the first four General Councils,or any of them, or by any other General Council, wherein the same wasdeclared to be heresy by the express and plain words of the CanonicalScripture, or such as has heretofore been judged heresy by the Parliamentwith the assent of the Clergy in the Convocation, as appears by the statutemade in the first year of her Majesty’s reign and the first chapter. Therehave been possessions before Christ’s time, which may be seen by thesethings which are recorded of the exorcists among the Jews,60and of the61Oracles, Engastrimythoi,62and others among the Gentiles.

Whenthe godly men have called on the Lord to dispossess the wicked spirit outof the tormented creature, he has answered, as it were from Heaven, ‘Beit to you, as you have defined.’ Lastly, when Satan has been dispossessed,he has, as the Scripture says, walked in dry and barren places, seeking rest,but finding none, and returning back into the house from whence he came.He has appeared in divers shapes,74persuading the parties by promises andthreatenings to let him re-enter. Some have yielded, like Jane Ashton inLancashire, this Sommers and others.

Likewise there besome who call themselves Christians, and also ministers of the Gospel whoyet, in their practices, live like atheists and make a scorn of the exercisesof religion, namely, preaching, praying, fasting, sanctifying the Sabbath,reading the word of God, giving thanks at meat, using the phrases of theScriptures. And they do revile and hate others because they refrain fromswearing, lying, filthy speaking, gaming, plays and such abominations of thisage wherein we live. It is to be doubted that neither the word nor miraclescan prevail with those men. ‘When God shuts, no man can open.’ WhenLazarus was raised from the dead, ‘Many believed, but some were hardenedand complained about our Saviour.’Though some saw Christ visibly risen from the dead, yet they stilldoubted.

A number of people in that town whosehearts were opened hereby to receive the Gospel are left to the wolf.The holy exercises of prayer and fasting are shamefully scorned.

And they being three or four, taking him up to save him from101[His body doubled, &c.].102Acylindrical wooden vessel containing around a bushel, eg. of wheat.103[Extraordinary strength].104[Leg, heavy, inflexible].105[Cast into the fire]."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"270Demonic Possession and Exorcismburning, could not set him in the chair again.

And neither his head hair, nor any part of his body washurt or burnt by the107fire. And she further says that there was a small linewhich tied up a painted cloth which was hung over the bed, to which thesaid Sommers stretched out his hand. But he could not reach it. And then,to their imagination, he, seeming to exceed the stature of the tallest man inthe town, suddenly got his chin over the said line. And so with his hands,he plucked the line so firmly about his neck that they who stood by hadmuch ado108to save him from hanging. She further says that the boy, inone of his fits the night before Master Darrell came, said that Darrell wascoming, when neither she nor any other to109her knowledge had any certainintelligence that Master Darrell would come. For the messengers whichwent for him had brought answer that he intended not to come till the nextweek. And she also further says that, on the said Saturday on which MasterDarrell came to the town, he was more extremely handled than before. Andhe lay many times with his mouth extraordinarily void and strangely open.And he spoke these words, viz., ‘I will use W. S.’s tongue and members forthree days,’ without moving or stirring his110tongue or lips in speaking anyof the said words. And she says that the speech was in the ordinary voice ofW. Sommers. And this deponent further says that an hour and a half beforeMaster Darrell’s coming to the town, the boy fell into an extreme fit in suchmanner as she and those who were present judged that verily he was dead.For he lay111senseless and speechless, his eyes out of his head like walnuts,his face black in a strange manner, and all his members and the parts of hisbody instantly cold for the space of an hour. And being asked, when hisfits were past, whether he remembered the extremity or any part, he deniedthat he remembered anything. And during the time of his extremity,112they endeavoured many times to recover him by giving him aqua vitae andother comfortable things, but it wrought nothing in him to revive him. AndMaster Darrell being come into the town, the boy instantly spoke of it withthese words, ‘I have but a small time now to stay, but I will shortly return.’106[Leg bowed].107[Though so heavy as hardly by three or four taken out, yet unhurt].108[Extrordinary stature].109[Extraordinary knowledge].110[Speech without moving tongue or lips].111[For dead].112[No remembrance]."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The story of William Sommers271And Master Darrell coming in113at the rear-side of the house without theknowledge of the boy, as she verily thinks, the boy foretold his coming.And he had also foretold Master Aldridge’s coming at sundry times.

Amongst the rest he namedone Millicent Dorselie, who dwelt at Bridgeford, whom Master Darrelland Master Aldred carried to Master Parkins to be examined.

And this129examinant, thinking with himself that it was impossiblethat a boy of his age and strength should in such a way stretch three orfour lusty fellows, desired to know whether his strength was such as theypretended or not. In another of his fits, which lasted from between nine andten o’clock until it was past twelve, this examinant desired to deal with himhimself for satisfaction of his own mind. And to the end he might have thebetter advantage, as he thought, he stepped behind him as he was sitting inachair and got a firm hold of the muscles of his arms, as though he wouldhave pinioned him.

And learningalso that the said W. Sommers was with his said keepers at Lenton, thisexaminant desired to talk with him to the end that he might test whether hecounterfeited or not. For he thought to himself that, if he did counterfeit,he would remember something that this examinant did to him, consideringthat he never came to him but once. And to the end that no exceptionsmight be taken against this examinant’s words, he requested his neighbourMaster Forster, a very honest and God fearing man, to accompany himthither. Telling him beforehand the purpose of his going, he willingly wentwith him. When this examinant came to him, after they had given over theirwork, and all the workmen were departed, he asked leave of his said keepersthat he might talk with the said W.

Being asked by this examinant what it was thathe did, he said that he nipped him by the finger with his thumbnail.

For, said this deponent, ‘Every lie is of the Devil.’Whereto the said Sommers answered that indeed he did not nip his finger.‘But,’ said he, ‘you did bend my finger thus.’ And with that, he bent his fingerwith his own hand. To the end, said he, that ‘you might try whether I hadany sense or feeling, or not.’ This examinant likewise affirmed that to be anuntruth also. He exhorted him again in the fear of God to speak the truth.Then after he had paused a fair time, this examinant asked him the third timewhat he had done.

Life returned to herbody, and lifting her hands up high, she cried out ‘He is come, he is come’,and then, ‘The comforter is come. O Lord, you have delivered me.’ Thesewerethe words of her Grandfather, Robert Glover, we are informed, as hewas going to be executed by burning.1MaryGlover was the granddaughter of Robert Glover, burned at Lich-field during the reign of Mary on20September1555.For the Puritan JohnSwan, Mary, like her grandfather, is the victim of persecution both demonicand official. Swan’s anger, like that of John Darrell and George More, isdirected against Samuel Harsnett in his capacity as Chaplain to RichardBancroft the Bishop of London, and discrediter of exorcists, both Catholicand Protestant. Harsnett had referred to Swan, along with three other Puri-tan ministers involved in the dispossession of Mary, as ‘devil-finders anddevil-puffers, or devil-prayers’ in hisADeclaration of Egregious Popish Impos-tures.2Itwas both this defamation and Harsnett’s belief that ‘the opinionsof witches [to] be brainless imaginations’3that motivated Swan to give ushis very detailed account of a Puritan exorcism.Inprefacing his work with a letter to King James I, Swan was no doubtoptimistic that he would receive a sympathetic hearing. Being familiarwith James’Daemonologie,he was aware of the King’s belief in the reality ofwitchcraft and possession.4And he knew that the details of Mary Glover’s1Swan,1603,p.47(see below, p.318.)

James was soon to become more sceptical about possession.

And Swan had also the support of the presiding judge, LordAnderson, that Mary Glover was the victim of a supernatural and not anatural malady. ‘Divines, Phisitions’, he declared, ‘I know they are learnedand wise, but to say this is natural, and tell me neither the cause, nor thecure of it, I care not for your judgement. Give me a natural reason, and anatural remedy, or a rush for your physick.’8Atthe end of April1602,Mary was sent on an errand by her motherto Elizabeth Jackson. Accusing Mary of malicious gossip, Elizabeth cursedher, hoping that ‘an evil death will come upon her’.9Maryimmediatelyfelt ill. The following Monday afternoon, after another confrontation withElizabeth, she became speechless and blind, her neck and throat swollenand misshapen. For the next eighteen days, she had fits three or four timesaday, was unable to eat, and was sufficiently ill for her parents to havethe church bell rung for her. Elizabeth Jackson rejoiced publicly in herimpending death.Marybecame increasingly ill, progressively showing all the symptomsof possession – immobility of her body, foul breath, the extension of herneck, a gaping and distorted mouth, swellings which moved from her stom-ach to her throat, violent movements, and so on. Mary had ‘ordinary fits’every second day until the time of her dispossession, and ‘extraordinaryfits’ in the presence of Elizabeth Jackson. These latter were characterisedbyventriloquism: ‘the mouth being fast shut, and her lips closed, therecame a voice through her nostrils, that sounded very like (especially some-times) “Henge her”, or “Honge her.” The repetition of this never ceased5Swan,1603,p.4(see below, p.294). This is probably the manuscript “Mary Glover’s Late WoefulCase” (MS Sloane831)inthe British Library by the physician Stephen Bradwell. Michael MacDonaldconjectures that the second author may have been William Scott, a barrister of the Inner Temple,who wrote a narrative of the case used by Bradwell.

They occurred on allthose occasions when Mary and Elizabeth were brought together: at thehouse of Mary’s Uncle William Glover, a former Sheriff; in front of SirJohn Harte, a former Lord Mayor; before Lady Bruckard and many divinesand physicians; at the Inner Temple, in the chambers of the Recorder JohnCroke who staged a whole series of activities to test the authenticity ofMary’spossession; and finally, on the first day of the trial of ElizabethJackson on1December1602.Onthat day, Mary was brought to the Sessions house to give evidenceagainst Elizabeth who had been indicted on a charge of witchcraft. Althoughunaware of Elizabeth’s presence, Mary fell into a fit and was carried out of thechamber by three strong men who affirmed that ‘they never carried a heavierburden’.11Later, Lord Anderson, the Recorder, Sir William Cornwallis, SirJerome Bowes, and other judges paid her a visit. After considering thestiffness of her body, the Recorder burned her hand with lighted paperuntil it blistered, without Mary returning to normal consciousness. UponElizabeth Jackson’s entry to the room, the voice in Mary could again beheard saying ‘Hang her.’ Upon Elizabeth being forced to touch Mary, herbody was thrown around violently. Jackson was unable to say parts of theLord’s Prayer, and struggled with the Creed.The trial continued with the medical evidence divided. Doctors Heringand Spencer testified to her illness being supernatural, ‘having strangereffects, than either the mother [i.e. hysteria], or any other natural diseasehas ever been observed to bring forth’.12Doctors Argent and Jorden, and aDivine Doctor Meadowes, argued that she suffered from a merely naturaldisease, more specifically incurable hysteria. Judge Anderson, convincedthe land was about to be overwhelmed by witches, was not persuadedbyArgent, Meadowes, and Jorden, the agents of Bishop Bancroft, andElizabeth Jackson was found guilty.Fifteen days later, on16December, John Swan, five other preachers, andeighteen others13met at Mistress Ratclife’s in Shoreditch.

Mary remained comfortable however until after twoin the afternoon, when her fits began, different in sequence, length, andintensity to those of other days. Mary’s fits have an apocalyptic resonance.Satan’s expected increase in wrath before the end of the world (Rev.12.12)and before his ultimate cosmic defeat is replicated in the body of Mary.‘I imagine’, declared John Swan, ‘that his malice was rather grown greatertowards the end of his kingdom. And so it fell out.’14The preacher Bridgerinvokes the eschatological imagery of Christ’s overcoming Leviathan, thelion and the adder, and the dragon.15Mary’sbody is thus the site of an apocalyptic struggle between Godand Satan. The rhetoric of warfare predominates. ‘The battle seemed tobe more fearfully renewed’, wrote Swan.16Evans was again called upon tobuckle on his harness ‘as the heat of the battle increased’.17Swan spoke ofhis falling back ‘into the rear of the battle’, and noted fear and trembling,tears and sobbing ‘in the more ancient, expert, and experienced soldiersand Captains that were there’.18Throughout the process of her dispossession, Mary’s demonic fits alter-nated with her prayers and singing, the former the sign of Satan’s power,the latter the sign of God’s presence. Mary is a site of conflict, but alsoan active participant in her own deliverance. Hers was a good possession:‘many a hearty Amen was yielded to many points of her prayer’.19Sheseesherself as an exemplar of pious resistance against the wiles of the Devil: ‘giveme victory against this my enemy’, she prays, ‘that I and others may rejoiceand tell to others the great things that you have done for me.’20Atthe endof her day of deliverance, she is the ideal Puritan daughter. And this is how,Swan concludes, she remains: an example to the pious, an inspiration tothe godly, and a warning to the sceptical.MaryGlover and her supporters seem to have remained free from theimmediate attentions of Harsnett and Bancroft. But their victory was short-lived. The new Church Canons of1604ruled that, without the specialpermission of his Bishop, no minister was to attempt ‘upon any pre-tence whatsoever whether of possession or obsession, by fasting and prayer,to cast out any devil or devils, under pain of the imputation of impos-ture or cozenage and deposition from the ministry’.21Officially, at least,possession and dispossession were now in the control of the establishedChurch.14Swan,1603,p.21(see below, p.306).15SeeSwan,1603,p.43(see below, p.316).16Swan,1603,p.29(see below, p.310).17Swan,1603,p.30(see below, p.310).18Swan,1603,p.34(see below, p.312).19Swan,1603,p.24(see below, p.307).20Swan,1603,p.38(see below, p.314).21Thomas,1973,p.579."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Atrue and brief report, of Mary Gloversvexation, and of her deliverance by the means of fastingand prayer.

Myself, I confess, was not at thistheir meeting. I knew not then of their purpose. But hearing overnight ofthe next day’s action, I so fitted myself to it that, that morning, I was thethird person that arrived in the room where the work was performed, yetwith the purpose, as God knows, to be but a beholder, and to join in theaffections of my heart with the prayers of the rest, and to be partaker oftheir preaching. And so I would have sat still, had I not been drawn out ofmy place, as I am sure many there present can testify.But touching their preparation, which I am now ready to report althoughIwas not, as I said, present at it, yet I had it from one of them that couldbest tell. And having read it before the others, I find it confirmed by theirtestimonies.By consent of the godly ministers, at the pressing request of the parentsof Mary Glover, it was decided that there should be one day set apart, andthat presently for good reasons, for prayer and fasting, so that by humblesupplication God might be entreated to have mercy on them and on hisdistressed servants of that family, especially on the maid herself who wasthe occasion of the others’ grief. After that, it was agreed that the ministerswho were to be employed in the action should meet together on Tuesdaythe fourteenth of December to advise of the order that, among themselves,they would observe both in prayer and preaching. This being accomplished,it was thought good that one should be appointed who would, the nightbefore the exercise, prepare the company that would be partakers with theministers in that needful and holy action.At the time appointed for this preparation, with much ado, they met,some ten or twelve, at Master Glover’s house in Thames Street. There"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"298Demonic Possession and Exorcismthey continued for a time, and then the preacher28that was appointed firstprayed God to direct him to speak and the people to hear, and all toprepare themselves that they might be fitted to come before the God ofHeaven. That done, he framed some words of exhortation to repentance,and especially to an earnest humiliation of their souls and bodies before theLord, that he, seeing them, especially those that were most interested in thedistressed, truly humbled, might in mercy and goodness lift them up, bygiving deliverance and granting comfort in his good time, in what mannerand measure it pleased him, and that not for any other sake but that of hisown truth and promise.The ground of his exhortation was the tenth verse of the fourth chapterof Saint James: ‘Cast down yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift youup,’ which consists of a commandment, ‘Cast down,’ and of a promise, ‘Toexalt.’He showed the necessity of the former, if we mean to enjoy the latter,first by the commandment of God, and secondly in regard of ourselves, whocould not otherwise be cured, being naturally too much advanced in somevain conceits of our own goodness. He described the nature and propertyof this grace and work. He noted the way to come by it, namely, first byserious meditation in the law of God that lays open our sins and God’sjudgements, secondly by observing the judgments of God on others andon ourselves, thirdly by prayer and other outward means sanctified for thatpurpose. Fourthly, he showed that, if a man will be truly humbled, he mustcast his eyes on God’s mercies. For fear may astonish and judgements mayterrify, but they cannot work true humility unless God in favour do workit by his Spirit and the ministry of grace. And therefore the said preacherjoined this grace to true conversion, as a fruit to his own tree. And this wasthe sum of the first part, namely, of humbling or casting down, saving thatsomewhat was added for the sincerity and continuance in this grace of God,because the Apostle says, ‘In the sight of God.’Touching the second part, he observed the verity and constant truth ofthis promise, and so the excellency of it, by considering the nature and will28[Master Skelton]."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover299of the promiser, secondly by the gracious effects and works of mercy andtruth shown to all his Saints, Abraham, David, Joseph, and our Lord JesusChrist, the Prince of our salvation. Here he thought it needful to exhortthat, having this promise of help and of honour, we should not abuse it,neither prescribing to God the time when to perform it since he has saidit will be in due time, 1 Peter 5.6, nor the means, since his wisdom isunsearchable and knows how to do it with means or without means; or elseby fainting in ourselves by the consideration of our unworthiness and sin,forasmuch as God respects his own glory, his truth and promise in thiswork, and not our worthiness or the measure of our faith and repentance.For we have in us the worthiness of Christ. And so he concluded withprayer agreeable to this speech as near as he could.The time when this exercise began was about six o’clock at night. Theycontinued in prayer, in hearing and speaking for somewhat more than anhour, none using either prayer or speech at this time, but only the ministerwho was the mouth of God to the rest, and of the rest to God, joiningwith him in prayer, and reverently attending the actions in hand. The maidand her Mother sat near the preacher, religiously hearkening to both in thetime of exhortation and prayer. The Father in the time of prayer did sendforth many hearty sighs which so concurred with the words then uttered tothat purpose, that it might be thought by others that the preacher purposelypointed at him in his speech and prayer. The action being ended, the maidand her Mother came and, with sober countenance and gesture, gave thanksto the preacher.

In so doing, if she at any time failed, either by grief of body,or infirmity of mind or concentration, or by failing of sight, which seemedsometimes so to be by the rubbing of her eyes with her hand, then a womansitting by was always ready in that behalf to help her, especially at the instanceof the preachers who, directing their speeches many times to her by name,would call on her to turn to the place alleged and so would stop till she hadfound it.In the meanwhile, namely, after her coming into the chamber until it wasfully eight o’clock, for so long we waited expecting the coming of an ancienthumble-hearted preacher whose presence we much longed for, one of thepreachers30made motion to spend a little time till all were come in readingsome parts and portions of the word of God by meditation, whereof eachone might privately make such observations and raise up such thoughts thatby their means we might be the better fitted to the work following. And so,having first prayed, he did to this end read the fourth and fifth chapters ofJames, and after them he read the fifty first Psalm throughout. Having done30[Master Skelton]."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover301this, to help us, he pointed to some principal or special points therein thatseemed to him most meet to be observed for the present purpose, and soagain concluded with prayer agreeable. This being finished, the hour of eightwas come, and the company was such as gave comfort and encouragementto begin.Then the first preacher31did set hand on the work and, preparing himselfto it, framed his speech for the addressing of us to the more dutiful andreligious carriage of ourselves in the action, humbling us by prayer, con-fessing our sins, our weakness and unworthiness, begging pardon, cravinggracious assistance, and a happy issue of our enterprise, for Christ Jesus’ssake, who is blessed for ever, Amen.The prayer being finished, he took for his text Psalm 50.15, ‘Call onme in the day of trouble, so will I deliver you, and you will glorify me,’wherein the parts observed were: 1. a precept to call; 2. the party on whom;3. the time when; 4. The promise of deliverance; 5. A duty thereupon to beyielded.For the first, we are not only allowed, or exhorted to call if we wish,but commanded to do it, as a part of God’s worship. For the second, henoted in the party to be called on, wisdom in seeing all things, willingnessto hear, and power to help. And in the first point of his wisdom, he urgedhis all-seeing eye. And pressing the same point on the parents and on thepoor maid by name, to rip up the secrets of their lives touching their livesalready spent, the poor soul the daughter began to weep. Yet, composingherself, she endured all his speech, even to the end of his morning sermon,whereof let it suffice to have reported thus much, saving that he furtheradded this, that God did see our wants before we ask, he prepares our heartsto beg and then bends his ear to hear. His sermon being done, he endedwith an effectual and suitable prayer to the purpose, having spent in prayersand preaching some hour and a half. And truly, touching the man, and soof the rest, I speak not to flatter. I write in the fear of God to gain glory tohis Majesty, and not praise to men, to whom belongs nothing but shame.Iknew him long before, but I knew him not so, having never heard him31[Master Lewes]."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"302Demonic Possession and Exorcismbefore. And here, I appeal to his heart and so to the others that succeededin prayers and preaching, whether they did not that day find in themselvesan extraordinary presence and supply of God, his gracious and powerfulSpirit in them, in the performance of these most holy and reverent actions.After this action of preaching and prayer ended, the poor creature beingpale and wan-coloured was asked by her Mother and others how it faredwith her. She acknowledged that she felt pain in her body. And she weptand prayed to God to be merciful to her and to help her, and said withalthat she could and would endure further proceeding in the former exercise.And so she sat for a while rubbing hard, or stroking down with her hand,her left side and flank.Then succeeded the second preacher,32who would have begun the exer-cise himself if he had come on time. But he came a little after the actionwas entered into by the first preacher. This man did happily second the first,and that presently without intermission, beginning with a most sweet, mild,according to his disposition, long, earnest, and powerful prayer. Havingdone this, he took for his text Matthew 11.28, ‘Come to me all you thatare weary and laden, and I will ease you.’ Having read this, he observed init first, an allurement to come, secondly, the party to whom, thirdly, theparties that should come, and lastly, a promise of ease. Of all these parts, Icould report somewhat. But as I said, I must apply myself to be brief. Onlythis, as I remember, he pressed most, at least it made most impression onme, the third part, viz. of the parties that should come. These were suchas, in time of their wantonness, could not or would not intend it, but beingpressed with afflictions purposely sent are ready to come to the hand thatgave the wound, whose drift was also herein, to get occasion to make showof his skill and good will to heal. Further, he noted that there be a greatmany that are laden with sin but not wearied with the burden thereof. So,ending again with prayer containing points agreeable to his text and fittingthe present occasion, he made an end of that his talk.Then he himself, in the mildness of his charitably disposed mind, askedthe maid how she did. And perceiving her to wax pale-coloured, weeping,32[Master Evans]."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover303and answering faintly, he made motion that there might be a little pausethat everyone that wished might walk down a while and refresh themselves.Divers went, but more remained behind, and amongst them myself, whocame on purpose to mark as precisely as possibly I could all the actionsand circumstances of that day’s work. In this meantime, I observed hersitting, weeping bitterly, wringing her hands extremely, complaining ofunaccustomed pain, yea casting out words of fear that God would not hearus in calling on him for her, so wretched a creature. This circumstanceIdothe more willingly retain and insist on, to meet with a project ofthe opposite Doctor of physick,33who lays it down for a ground, thatmany are cured of strange diseases, even of the Mother,34with a very bareconceit or apprehension that prayer and fasting will do them good. For thispoor creature, as hereby you see, was so far from having embraced any suchstrong imagination that she uttered words of doubt, distrust, yea of dreadfuldespair. But to return, I will observe this withal, that all this pause was notabove the space of less than a quarter of an hour.Here it is fit that this also should not be omitted, namely, that she feltpains this day before the accustomed hour. For now they came about nineo’clock, which was four or five hours before the usual time of her fits,which were wont to keep their returns as due as the tide. And again, whenthe vehemency of the fit began to seize on her this day which was also herfit day, being every second day, it began somewhat after the ordinary time,which was wont to be two o’clock in the afternoon. And again, the saidvehemency of the fit, when this day it was come, kept not the like course asusually before it had done. For first, in former fits, blindness invaded her.And so also it was this day when the fit came after two o’clock. And thisblindness was accompanied with a pale dead colour of face and eyes closed,yet so as you might perceive the whites of them to be turned up. Secondlyfollowed dumbness which also was so now. But herein they differed, thatthe former blindness and dumbness having once seized on her, she nevercame to have freedom of speech till the whole fit was ended which wasabout eleven o’clock at night. But now they gave place by turns. Thirdly33That is, Edward Jorden.34Hysteria."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"304Demonic Possession and Exorcismsucceeded a heaving or swelling in the belly, breast, and throat. Fourthly,on this day, followed the wagging of her cape, which stirred much up anddown, not with over hasty motions but with some leisure. Fifthly, deadnessof the left side, with inflexible stiffness of leg, arm, hand, and fingers. Thesewere also now. But they made not the like coming and going, neither didthey follow each other in their ordinary kind of sequence. So that, as one35sets down in his notes, there was no coherence to this day’s affliction withher former fits or passions. And thus much, as it were by the way, of thedisparity of this day’s vexation from the perturbations or torments whichshe had sustained before.Hitherto, she had sat on a stool by the bedside when, at her first arriving,she had taken her place. But now, she was advised to change her place and tosit in the middle of the chamber in a low wicker chair, with her face towardsthe fire and her left side towards the preacher. Then the aforesaid ancientpreacher called for a new supply of a third man36who in much modestybegan to pray. And having fruitfully finished the same, he read a large text,namely, Daniel the ninth, from the first to the end of Daniel’s prayer, verse19. Pointing to points going before and running over that which he had read,he delivered very good and pertinent observations, which the very contextof the chapter does plainly offer, and a man exercised in the scriptures mayraise in his own meditations, if he will advisedly and with reverence readover the same. And therefore, as I also will be brief I pass it over. Thus,ending again with a comfortable prayer agreeable to his humbled spirit, inwhich prayer he remembered, amongst other things, the power of David’ssling in overthrowing Goliath who defied the heart of Israel, he ceased forthat time.By this time, as I remember, it was past twelve o’clock. And now diversof the company called on the preachers still to be doing, and not to givethe Lord any rest until he had heard us, much less to give Satan any rest toharbour where he did. And in this behalf, one of them, I know not who, putus in remembrance that ‘When Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed,but when he held them down, Amalek prevailed,’ Exodus 17.12.3735[Robert Midnall].36[Master Bridger].37Itshould read Exodus17.11."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover305Hereupon, there was a little straining of courtesy whose turn shouldbe next, either to pray or to preach. Then a fourth preacher38succeededin prayer, who besides the special points of the other prayers fitting thepresent occasion, as namely that it would please God to cast a mousell,39that was his word, on the jaws of that raging lion that goes about seeking todevour. He also complained that, amongst all the miseries that poor men areplunged into by means of sin, they should be subject to such a judgementas this was. Yet he raised comfort in that there was a victorious lion ofthe tribe of Judah, stronger than he, &c. I say, besides the ordinary pointsof the prayers, he complained that we might not, but in fear of men, meettogether to perform such duties, and such means as God has sanctified, andthe Church heretofore practised in such cases, for relief and recovery ofpoor creatures distressed in this kind. And so much for his prayer.Then he that preached the first sermon40at eight o’clock in the morningreturned to his text, taken out of Psalm 50.15 as before is said. But first heprayed effectually for graces necessary for himself, the afflicted party, andfor the benefit of us all there present, yea and for all the servants of Godwheresoever. That done, he repeated not much of that which in the morninghe delivered but proceeded to handle the rest. And especially, as I thought,he bent his force to that point, namely, of the time when we should callon God, and that was, ‘The needful time of trouble.’ This he handled afterthis manner. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but sent of God thatwe might call more earnestly. And so, by him being delivered from themall, he might receive the thanks of all and for all favours. Here he notedalso that the wicked had their share of troubles. But the troubles of theone and of the other differ greatly. For the one proceeds from a Judge, theother from a Father. The one is light and momentary, the other durable andthe beginnings of greater woe. The one to correct, to purge, and to refine,the other to confound, to make more obstinate and inexcusable. Thus withprayer he also ended, as with prayer he began.Now it was, as I remember and others in their notes observe, past twoo’clock. Until this time, the maiden having remained in reasonably good38[Master Barber].39muzzle.40[Master Lewes]."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"306Demonic Possession and Exorcismpeace and ease, I asked one what he thought of the matter. He answered thathis hope was that we should have a calm still, nothing but fair weather, andthat Satan would steal away like a thief. Whereunto I replied nothing, asone that could have been glad it might be so. But I doubted it, consideringthat his malice, who heretofore had raged in her, would not be so gentleas to be gone without a parting blow, but especially calling to mind themanner of his departing in those days when the power of doing miracleswas given to the sons of men, which is now ceased, namely, that he used torent, and tear, and leave for dead. And I imagined that his malice was rathergrown greater towards the end of his kingdom. And so it fell out. For evenalittle after that time, the poor soul began to be senseless on one side, tobe blinded, dead-coloured, and eye turned up, to be stiff in the left leg andarm &c. But these were not in such manner as in former times, both fortheir sequence and continuance, as I told you a little before. At which time,the good old preacher,41even without entreaty, fell to prayer. And havingcontinued therein a good while, the Mother who held the leg, and anotherwho held the hand, acknowledged that natural liberties and motion began tocome again, the preacher still continuing in his prayer. And anon, the poorcreature began to gasp and to strive to speak. And within a while, she spokesomewhat. But I could not then perceive what, it was so softly uttered. AndI, being further off, saw many laying their ears to her head to hear. But anon,her speech began to be louder and louder, so that I did very well hear agreat deal more than I can remember. Yet that which I do remember, I willfaithfully report, referring myself again to my brethren herein to be helpedwith their additions. The first word that she delivered when she began tolabour to utter anything that was like speech was, ‘Almost, almost’, theaccent being on the syllable ‘Al’.But first, before I begin to set down her prayer, let me observe a circum-stance or two. Drops of tears did steal down the cheeks of many, oftentimesin the time of the sermons and prayers before mentioned, both from womenand men, yea, the preachers themselves. But now, at the prayer of the damselherself, they did abound. The preacher continued a while praying as he began,41[Master Evans]."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover307and ceased not, although the maid’s words were now waxing loud, for helikely thought she would presently have ceased. But she continued. Thiswas thought to be confusing, and therefore he ceased and gave us leave tohearken to her. This we were very willing and glad to do, he or anothersaying further, ‘Let her alone, you will see that she will do it herself. Shewill procure her own deliverance.’Iwill come to report her prayer by and by, but first one thing more. Iheard a gracious young gentleman42(I knew him not, I had no acquaintancewith him, they say he is one of the Inns of Court) who, having first heard herlow voice and discerning what she said, hastened from her with blubberingcheeks, his tongue being scarcely able to be the messenger of his heart,overwhelmed with joy. But at last he broke out with the matter thus. ‘I haveseen her often heretofore in her fearful fits, but I never saw or heard that,being once entered into a first fit, she ever recovered free liberty of speechagain until the last fit was ended,’ which was also usually the most terrible,but remained both blind and dumb till then. This lasted commonly frombefore two o’clock in the afternoon until eleven or twelve at night. Well,her prayer goes on, and we give joyful attendance and silence to the same,saving that many a hearty Amen was yielded to many points of her prayer.This lasted about half an hour, she sitting all this while in her said chair andleaning backward, her face ruddy-coloured and directed upward, her eyelidsalittle opened, her hands both at once continually lifted up but not joinedtogether, and presently falling down at the end of every period or perfectpetition. She laboured so in it, and that with tears, that a little froth wroughtout at the corners of her lips. And so she continued until, I think partlyweariness of her weak body caused her to cease. So she rested. But as theevent showed, she was then growing to a sharper fit which, being perceived,there then was one who very unwillingly was drawn to prayer. But before Ispeak of his prayer, I will discharge my promise concerning the report ofhers, wherein I know I will fail in remembrance of many points, as also forthe time when and in which of her prayers each request was made. For sheused four prayers as you will hear afterwards. But that which I will set down42[Master Oliver]."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"308Demonic Possession and Exorcismwill be such as I can safely bear testimony to, both for the matter and, Ithink, not much missing the words. And herein I will be the more plentiful,because in reporting her next succeeding prayers, I will peradventure referto this, as containing many points which she afterwards did iterate and soease myself of labour in writing, and the reader in perusing.43‘O Lord, I beseech you, look on me your poor handmaid with the eyesof mercy. Have mercy on me for Jesus Christ’s sake. Be merciful to meand pardon all my sins. Let them not stand up as a wall to stop and hinderyour favours from me, but wash them all away in the death and bloodshedof Jesus Christ, your only, true, and dear Son. I have been a vile wretchand sinful creature, but deal not with me as I have deserved. Rememberyour own promise that, at whatsoever time a sinner does repent of his sinsfrom the bottom of his heart, you will put all his wickedness out of yourremembrance. O Lord, I repent of all my sins. I believe, help my unbelief.Grant comfort, Lord, comfort. You who are the God of all comfort andconsolation, add strength Lord to my strength, rebuke Satan and help me.44OLord, in mercy behold me and grant me deliverance, O Lord, deliverance,and that even now O Lord, if it be your blessed will. Nevertheless, not mywill but your will be done. Give me patience O Lord, and strength to bear,and lay on no more, then I will be able to bear. And confirm my hope tobe delivered when you will see it good. Give me grace to say as Job said,‘Though you kill me, yet will I put my trust in you,’ and to say with yourservant David, ‘If you have no pleasure in me, behold here I am, do withme as pleases you.’ Yet, O Lord, though you would let Satan kill my body,let him have no power over my soul. Let the same be precious before you.Nevertheless, grant if it be your will that I may one day rejoice with yourservant David and say ‘It is happy for me that I was in trouble.’ And, OLord, be merciful to her by whose means this trouble was brought on me. Iforgive her with all my heart, even for all that has been done to me from thebeginning. And I pray you, O Lord, to forgive her, to give her grace to see hersin and to repent, and to believe, that so she may be saved. Satan was hereinyour rod, O Lord, on me, and she but the instrument. And as for the rod,43[Her first prayer].44[Her words were so]."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover309when you have done with it, it will be cast into the fire. But the instrumentthat has been by that serpent abused, O Lord, have mercy on her and forgiveher all her sins, even as I forgive her with all my heart. You know, Lord, thatthat which has been done against her has not been done of malice or desireof revenge on my part, but that the truth might be known, and so you to havethe glory, and that I might be delivered from the slander of men. Hear me,OLord, from Heaven and grant me these requests for Jesus Christ’s sake,in whose name I further call on you as he has taught me saying, ‘Our Fatherwhich is in Heaven,’ &c. throughout to the end. After The Lord’s Prayer,she added some few other short petitions, and so made an end. And let thissuffice for report of the chief contents of her first prayer, which lasted aboutthe space of half an hour. For, striving to proceed, she fell into another fit.And then immediately, there was calling both by the preachers and peoplefor a new man to the helm. And then there was drawn forth one,45beinggreatly urged thereunto, to pray. He yielded to that only, for indeed hemeant not to be employed at all, but only to join in prayer with the rest ofthe company, and to be partaker with them of the word there taught andapplied, as appeared by his keeping himself aloof. But being, as is said,urged by the preachers and company, he began his prayer with a meditationout of the speech of Jacob, Genesis 28. 16,17: ‘Surely God is in this place,and I was not aware. How fearful is this place,’ &c., applying the same thus,that this fear came on us, because the place being holy by the presence ofGod, we were unholy in the inclinations of our hearts continually. Andso he pleaded for mercy by the mediation of him who in the days of hishumiliation, being taught obedience by the things he suffered, did send upmighty cries and was heard in the things he feared. And therefore he, beingafaithful High Priest and touched with our infirmities, could tell how tohave mercy and help, Hebrews 4.15 and 5.7, &c. And in the process ofhis prayer, he began a little to alter the tune of the former doleful ditties,and began to thank God for mercies presently vouchsafed on the preachersin their sermons and prayers, yea, and on the poor maid whose tongue,being by his goodness let loose, had so spoken as before you heard. And45[Swan]."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"310Demonic Possession and Exorcismtherefore, he began to be bolder and to encroach on further favour sayingthat we would take this at God’s hands as an earnest penny of further help.And therefore he prayed God to make perfect the good work which he hadmost graciously begun, that with comfort we might depart in the end, everyman to his home. But behold, this proved but a triumph before victory. Foreven then the maid entered again into another fit, and the battle seemed to bemore fearfully renewed. He therefore, rising from the cushion at the table,another took his place, namely, he46that read to us the fourth and fifth ofJames in the morning, the sum of whose prayer was, first, a confession ofour unworthiness to appear before the God of Heaven to obtain mercy,secondly, an acknowledgement of the justice of God in punishing the worldwith bodily and spiritual chastisements, and therewithall he confessed thatGod for sins, even since our meeting, might justly withdraw his helpinghand. Thirdly, he prayed for pardon, for favour and grace to us, to thedistressed, present or elsewhere, in hearing our prayers, and the prayers ofothers and that, not for our humiliation’s sake, for that was sinful as it camefrom us but for Christ’s sake, to the glory of his own name, the profit andcomfort of us all there assembled and the afflicted party, and to the stoppingof all mouths opened against the truth of God. And lastly, he prayed forthe comfort of all distressed souls who, hearing of God’s goodness to hischildren, should see that it is not in vain to go to him in trouble and to castour cares on him. Then was the old preacher47again called on to fight. He,buckling on his harness, began to cry for help, not because, he said, troublewas at hand, but because he saw it present and pressing on us. And so heproceeded with fervent vehemency as the heat of the battle increased. Butnow, alas, his free meditations were interrupted, being forced to cast hiseyes oftentimes on the poor maid diversly distressed, as also being troubledwith the confused outcries of the company. But still he continued, thoughnow by snatches, as it were, and with imperfect periods. Yet, see God’sgood mercy who did not let this heaviness to lie long on us. For behold,even herewithal, the maid began again to gasp and strive for recovery, whichcaused the old man to say, ‘Let everyone of us help her in our private prayers,46[Master Skelton].47[Master Evans]."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover311seeing a set order cannot be observed.’ But in the time of his prayer, thoughshe were deaf as we thought, yea, dumb and blind, yet she turned her bodyfrom him with all violence, and gaping, as if she could not abide him. Soafter a while she spoke. And the first word she uttered was as before with aweak, hollow and, as it were hoarse voice, yet reasonably loud, ‘Once more,once more,’ making her accent on the word once. And so she immediatelyproceeded to her second prayer, the matter and words whereof were, asIbear witness, for the most part like the former. But some things wereadded, both in this second prayer, and also in the third and fourth followingwhereof I will call to mind some points as well as I can. This second prayeralso continued as long as the first, her voice waxing stronger, and she sittingstill in the same chair, with the same position of body, countenance of face,and gesture of hands.48‘O Lord, you have begun to be gracious to me. You have done more forme than I looked for. I beseech you, O Lord, perfect the work which youhave begun, that you may have the praise, and these your children may becomforted. Let my prayers ascend up to your presence, and the prayers ofthese your servants, and all the prayers that this day are made for me in anyother place. You have commanded us to call on you in the time of trouble,and have promised that you then will hear and so have the praise. Hear ustherefore, O Lord, now calling on you in the needful time of trouble, sothat hereafter I may praise you and magnify your name. Give me a heart tosubmit to your will and to wait on you. You know, O Lord, my affliction,and you can help me, for you are stronger than Satan. O Lord, now showyour strength, and let us see your saving help. Put your power to my power,and49your will to my will. Fight for me, confound his malice, destroy hiswork, and darken the power of Satan, O Lord, and let him be trodden underfeet like dirt (this was her very word). Let not my sins, O Lord, nor the sinsof my parents come to remembrance, which have been the cause of this heavychastisement laid on us. But, O Lord, give us true repentance, and blot outall our sins, that they rise not up in judgement against us, nor hinder your48[Her second prayer].49[Her words were so, and are well thus interpreted: Add more of your power to the power you havealready given me, and your full will to accomplish that right desire which you have formed in me]."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"312Demonic Possession and Exorcismmercies at this time towards us.

Then again,both preachers and people called for prayer. And then the unworthiest andweakest50was put to it again, who began with the speech of the prophet, thatthe fruit was come to the birth but there was no power to be delivered, &c.And so bemoaning our weakness and calling for strength from the authorof all power, he went on, stumbling and stuttering by means of the perplexitythat he and the company and the poor creature were then in, rather poweringout short requests than a set prayer, just as present trouble enforced. Thisdone, he fell back into the rear of the battle, with purpose to strike no morestrokes nor do any other service than by giving encouragement to those thatfought, applause to their well doings, and to mark the variable inclinings ofthe combat. But yet, even then, he was thinking of a weapon or two, whichhe would have used if he had again been summoned to appear before theGeneral. And true it is, there was some fearfulness noted in that party. ButIhope it was not much offensive to God or to them that observed it. For Iam sure that I also saw fear and trembling, yea tears and sobbing in the moreancient, expert, and experienced soldiers and Captains that were there. Andagain, let it be thought on what it is for dust and ashes to come before thehigh possessor of Heaven and earth, for sinners to come before him whoseeyes cannot abide imperfections, yea, for sinners to be importunate, and thatat such a time when terror seems to compass about on every side, and in suchaseries as seems exceedingly difficult to be obtained. To this purpose maybe remembered that which was raised out of Daniel, of his consternation ofmind and feebleness of body at such a presence. To conclude, I think that50[Swan]."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover313fear and trembling does better fit such business, than to be senseless, orwithout feeling of any such passions. Well, this feeble-spirited fellow beingthus caused to retire, an old experienced soldier steps into the forefront.51And he begins his prayer by calling to mind a saying of one of the prophets,namely, that ‘Those that are the Lord’s remembrancers, should not give himrest until he be moved to remember his people,’ &c. Yet notwithstandinghis courage in the process of his prayer, he disclosed a fear and a doubt ofhis own, namely, that if the Lord were not pleased to hear us at this time,that he would yet remember his own cause, his own glory, and the cries ofhis people, and pity and relieve and release the distressed estate of his poorcreature when and where he will see fit to make more for the best, at theintercessions of himself and of other brethren. And yet this was the man who,alittle after he was risen up, did give out the first victorious cry, ‘He flies, heflies.’ But on what occasion he so did, I cannot now call to mind. He pressedalso the more to be heard, because Elias and such of God’s people prevailedby prayers, who yet were men compassed with infirmities, as we were.After him, immediately succeeded the aforesaid ancient preacher52who,Imust remember and I think he will acknowledge to be true, seemed to faintin his mourning. For, beginning his prayer, he bemoaned that the darknessof the night now coming on did much abate the comfort and courage of ourminds and that, being not all this while heard, resulted from the weaknessof our faith and coldness of our prayers, or from sins not repented of.And thereupon he prayed that if there were any present that came withunsanctified affections, or kept any such corruption secretly hid as Achandid, whose concealed sin injured the Lord’s host,53he might be humbled,brought to repentance, and pardon obtained. And thus, all impedimentsremoved, we might the better be heard and prevail. He also urged the Lordto hear us the rather, because we took no indirect course or unlawful meansfor remedy, but went directly to him who has all power in his hand to helpand is ready to hear, yielding herein obedience to his ordinance, and relyingon his promises, according also to the practice of his Church and childrenfrom time to time in such cases.51[Master Barber].52[Master Badger].53SeeJoshua, ch.22."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"314Demonic Possession and ExorcismAbout the time of his prayer, the afflicted patient began to revive, havingin the time of this fit shown much torment by her arms distorted or writhedthe outside inward, the left side of her body benumbed, both leg and arm,her fingers stretched out, and standing stiffly upright as inflexible as iron,as one that tested her presently reported, and called others to try, and sincehas delivered to me a note thereof under his hand.

And then, sitting as before in her chair, she fell to her third prayer,which continued as long as the former and contained such requests for themost part, and that in such words, as are before mentioned. And yet, in thisprayer, she had some points not touched before, as namely.54‘O Lord, your mercies have been exceedingly comfortable to me. Youhave begun to be gracious. O Lord, be merciful to me still, and leave me notuntil you have set me free. Let your glory appear in my deliverance, and letSatan be confounded. Strengthen me, O Lord, against that Goliath. Yourgrace is sufficient for me. Give me power, and patience to attend at yourleisure. Give me faith to believe your promises. Give me victory against thismy enemy, that I and others may rejoice and tell to others the great thingsthat you have done for me. I believe. Help my unbelief. You have taught methat if Satan is resisted he will fly. Now, Lord, give me strength to resist,so that he may fly and I, being delivered, may praise you, and others thathear of it may also magnify you and may always say, “The Lord be blessedwho has done such things for the sons of men,” and so learn to fear you andcall on you and put their trust in your mercy,’ &c.This prayer, as I said, was drawn out much more in length, partly byway of repeating things formerly mentioned, and partly by supplying otherpetitions, which neither I nor the others can now call to mind. And here,54[Her third prayer]."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover315by the way, if in all her prayers she had beaten still on the same matters, andthat even with the same words, she had had a good pattern of one who, beingin anguish, went again and prayed and spoke the same words, Mark 14.39.And truly the preachers, if they had done so too, would have agreed withthis that I have just said. And further, if it be a profitable thing to preach onething often, it cannot be unprofitable to pray one thing often, the occasionthereof still remaining. But, to say the truth, the preachers had much varietyof matter in all their prayers, neither can I call to mind many repetitions,except in the time of her extremities when set or continued prayers couldnot be admitted.And now it was the time of about six o’clock at night. And now was comethe hardest of all the day’s labours, both in respect of the party’s sufferings,the preachers’ prayers with vehemency therein, the people’s perturbation,her deliverance, her thanksgiving and our rejoicing. And now I perceive iscome the heaviest part of my task, to marshal each matter in its due place,and to pen it accordingly. But hoping for the like assistance as has directedme hitherto, I thus begin afresh to set on the work.Now, as I said, was she entered into her sharpest conflict. Now had Satanappalled her senses, especially benumbed the left side of her body. Nowwere her eyes fearfully turned upward, her tongue black and curled inward,her countenance ugly and distorted, her mouth excessively wide, gapingsometimes more in length upwards and sometimes again more stretchedout in breadth. Her face was fierce, sometimes as if it were scornfullydisdaining, sometimes terribly threatening, and so nodding her head andgaping at the women that stood or kneeled before her as if she woulddevour them. Then her head tossed from one shoulder to another, often,and severely and that with swiftness, and was sometime so far writhed to theone side, and stayed there so long that I feared it would have so remained.Here, when the ancient preacher prayed God to rebuke this ‘foul mali-cious Devil,’ she suddenly turned to him, though blind and dumb and deaf,and did spew out froth at him. With her head, she sometimes bounced back-ward on the pillow which a preacher called for a little after the beginning ofthis fit. And so laying it on the top of the chair, he stood, and sometimeskneeled behind her with his arms under hers supporting her body. Then"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"316Demonic Possession and Exorcismshe, with her foot and leg that was at liberty, stamped vehemently on thefloor and, getting some hold or stay with her foot, she raised her bodyaloft, and forced backward both the chair and him that stood behind her,notwithstanding that he and others resisted strongly, while certain of thewomen were busily employed in holding her down from beneath to keepdecorum, lest any unseemliness should occur. Her voice at this time wasloud, fearful and very strange, proceeding from the throat like a hoarse dogthat barks, casting from thence with opened mouth abundance of froth orfoam, whereof some did light on the face of one that kneeled by, in suchaway that his wife was moved to cast him her handkerchief to wipe it off.The noise and sound of her voice one expresses in his notes of observationby the word ‘cheh cheh’, or ‘keck keck,’ another by ‘twish twish’, or thehissing of a violent firework, another to a hen that has the squack. Anothercompares it to the loathsome noise that a cat makes striving to vomit hergorge.55And indeed she did very often and vehemently strain to vomit.In the time of this turmoil, another of the preachers,56kneeling down alittle on the one side of the chair, with a mild spirit and low voice, began andcontinued a sweet prayer, whereunto there was much attention given. In thisprayer, I remember some passages of the Scripture, whereof he aptly madegood use, as namely, mentioning the seed of the woman that would breakthe serpent’s head who, notwithstanding, would turn back and be nibbling atour heels. Again, he remembered the victorious lion of the tribe of Judah,that would daunt the roaring lion who seeks to devour us. And again, herepeated the prophecy concerning Christ, that he would overcome the greatLeviathan and put a hook in his nostrils, and that he would walk on the lionand adder and tread the young dragon under his feet, &c., praying that wemight see the present performance hereof. And so gathering courage andmaking application to raise up in us a comfortable hope and expectation ofdeliverance, he ceased.The afflicted party continued still in fits, whereof some were grotesquesuch as tossing her head, and heaving her shoulders, turning her bodyfrom side to side. And some again were more fearful such as her hip bone55The contents of her stomach.56[Master Bridger]."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover317standing up in her belly at the place of her navel, accompanied with theformer disfigurings of eye, mouth, hands, arms, fingers, throat, &c. Andhereupon, there were many crying out amongst the company saying, ‘Jesushelp. Lord, show mercy. Lord, strengthen. Lord, confound Satan. Lordsend deliverance.’ In the meanwhile, the preachers were forced to forbearset prayer because of the people’s confused cries. Yet one of the preachersrebuking Satan and calling him a foul spirit, she turned her face towards him,though her eyes were shut, and did belch out spittle at him disdainfully, asalso at others that kneeled on each side of her, holding her arms, insomuchthat one of them in his large observations says that he had much ado toforbear spitting again in his foul face. ‘I say “his”,’ says he, ‘for that Ithought I saw his ugly countenance in her then deformed visage.’At this time the Father of the maid roared right out with abundance oftears in the disquietness of his mind and anguish of his heart. And withal Icame to him from the place where I stood which was somewhat in front ofthe party’s face noting how things went. And taking him by the hand, I saidthat now I conceived more hope than before. ‘For if your daughter,’ I said,‘were not thus rent and torn, I would not look for deliverance.’After this the preacher57that kneeled behind her, thought to himself, ashe has since informed me, that the pride and rage of Satan was but a tokenof his ruin not far of. And he called to mind the manifest tokens of favourthat God had showed to us all the day till then, and also the promise ofGod, Ps.50.15, whereof he had entreated. And grounding himself on thetruth of that promise, he suddenly lifted up his voice and prayed loudlyand vehemently, urging the parable of the unrighteous judge, who by mereimportunity of a poor woman, was forced to hear her. So he urged theLord now to show his power and to give check to Satan and commandhim to be gone, whom he often defied. And he called him a proud spiritand yet cowardly, loath to let loose his hold, and often times with tears, yetsmilingly, he cried out, ‘He flies, he flies.’ At this, as also before, she turnedtowards him a direful menacing and sometimes mocking countenance. Andwith an open mouth she did cast out foam upward into his throat as he spoke.57[Master Lewes]."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"318Demonic Possession and ExorcismAnd the louder and more earnest that he was in his prayer, the more sheraged in his arms, attempting to rise. And with her strength she lifted him upwith her, striving to turn her breast and face towards him. Notwithstandingthis, her eyes were shut like a dead body’s, except that she lifted up hereyebrows, which made her look the more ghastly.While he was thus contending with her to keep her from turning fullyround towards him, she labouring, as I said, with often tossing the headfrom shoulder to shoulder to get her face opposite to his, another preacher58began to pray. And having a little while continued the same, the maid felldown suddenly into the chair. There she remained without motion, her headhanging downward, somewhat inclining towards the shoulder, her face andcolour deadly, her mouth and eyes shut, her body stiff and senseless, so thatthere were those that thought, and I think we all might have said, ‘Behold,she is dead.’ There were some that then observed and afterwards constantlyaffirmed, as also one of the men of good credit who stood near amongst thewomen and in his notes sets it down, that there was a thing creeping underone of her eyelids, of the bigness of a pea. But because it was not generallyseen and noted by us, it was thought good I should not much insist on it.After she had continued a while in this deadly state, in a moment life"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover319They that held her perceived this and yielded to see what she would do.And then she presently and suddenly slid down out of the chair and, veryspeedily recovering herself on her knees, with a countenance truly to myseeming exceedingly sober and full of a kind of majesty and reverence,with hands held up equally high, her eyes very broadly open, said to one,‘He is come,’ pronouncing it distinctly and somewhat loudly with a littlemotion of her face and hands upward, and making the accent on the word‘come.’ And again, turning around to another, she said, ‘He is come,’ andso to another and another, I think six or seven times. Then, from that, shefell to a most sweet prayer of thanksgiving, wherein she continued long,even to fainting through feebleness. Of this prayer, I will set down as muchas I can remember, referring myself herein to be further helped with thememories of others.59‘O Lord God and gracious Father, I humbly thank you for your merciestowards me a vile creature. I am unworthy of the least of them all, muchmore of this so great a mercy vouchsafed to me at this present. In givingme health, strength, and comfortable deliverance, Lord, make me trulythankful for it. Let me never forget it. Let me and all of us here present,and all that will hear of it, make true use of it, namely, to praise you foryour mercies kept in store, and to trust to your promises, and to depend onyour Providence, who does such things for your poor servants. And nowLord, grant that beginning, as it were, anew, it would please you to take me,even like a newborn babe, to your good grace that so I may become a newcreature, make me to hate sin with a perfect hatred, and detest Satan and hisworks and tread him under my feet as dirt. Fill my heart with thankfulness,fill it with the graces of your blessed spirit, working in me sanctificationand newness of life, to walk worthy of so great a mercy, that so glorifyingyou in this life, I may see and enjoy your glory in the life to come,’ &c.And so continuing on, iterating, and multiplying these and such like points,till we perceived her to be weary, she was interrupted and asked to favourherself, and to commit that duty of thanksgiving to another, who wouldimmediately take it on him, which was done accordingly. But before that,59[Her thanksgiving]."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"320Demonic Possession and Exorcismeven in the time of her prayer, one of the preachers said with a loud voice,‘Oh, what a sweet smelling evening sacrifice is this to the Lord?’ Well,another preacher60addressed himself to prayer, she being placed again inher chair, all the company falling down on their knees, and the preacherkneeling somewhat behind her.His prayer was indeed a sweet sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, con-taining much variety of excellent matter serving that purpose. In the endwhereof, he added petitions for the continuance of God’s good hand ofstrength, and grace on the party, and namely, that he would clad her with thecomplete armour, Ephesians, chapter 6, the particulars whereof he went overand so drew to an end. Then also the first preacher,61who before stood at herback holding her, did presently take over, taking the like words of thanksgiv-ing in his mouth and ending with prayer, desiring God to grant to us wisdomand discretion in publishing this great work of mercy to the world. This lastpoint of his prayer, concerning our care and discretion in publishing thisgreat work of God, the other ministers did think well off and afterwardsapprove, even as one62of the company also in his notes of remembranceconcludes the matter thus, ‘For which I pray God make me unfainedlythankful, and bold with wisdom to verify the truth hereof in due time.’Then another preacher63offered to make the like prayer of thanksgivingand that, as he said, briefly. But it was not allowed, fearing time would notsuffice.This done, one, I think a kinsman, went to the maid still sitting in herchair and said with joyful tears, ‘Welcome Mary, you are now again one ofus.’ The Father also, in a like way, took her by the hand as not being ableto speak a word. And the Mother went, and taking away the handkerchiefwith which her daughter sat covering her blubbering face, with like waterycheeks kissed her. Then she was asked to go near the fire. And so she wentand sat on the settle, where she took her place at her first entering into theroom. Thither I myself went to her and, taking her by the hand, I thankedGod for her, and bade her grow in comfort and courage and strength toresist if she should again be assaulted. ‘Fear not,’ said I, ‘the main battle is60[Master Skelton].61[Master Lewes].62[Robert Midnal].63[Master Bridger]."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover321fought. The other will be but a light skirmish, if there be any at all.’ So I lefther with the women standing about her, whom I heard soon after to observeand make known, that her belly was fallen and become as flat as it was twelvemonths before. Then also they gave her to drink a kind of posset,64whichshe took and drank with ease, to their marvel and rejoicing. For one of themen says in the notes of his remembrance that the day before, which alsowas her good day, he and another stronger man were troubled to hold her,so violently did she resist, whilst she did eat a little broth. But now she didtake twice the like quantity with bread also in it without any show of checkor resistance at all.In this meanwhile, the ministers drew themselves together in a corner ofthe chamber to consult on divers points meet to be considered of and agreedon. Firstly, that it was good that about six or seven days after, we should meettogether again in some convenient place, there to be exercised for the spaceof three or four hours in a solemn manner of thanksgiving. Secondly, that thenames of all that were present should be taken. Thirdly, that one should takethe pains to pen the actions of the day now past. And here, sorry we were thatwe had not taken pen and paper at the first, that someone might orderly haveset down brief notes of things as they passed. But howsoever that fell out,this task was committed to him that was not the fittest, who yet undertookit, and with help of the others has done as well as he could. Fourthly, thatthe company should be admonished not to publish this that was done asyet, but stay to see some continuance of her estate and, if they reported itto any concealing the place and the persons, to do it with wisdom and withareligious heart, least by foolish and vainglorious tattling, the cause mightbe hindered, and themselves receive hurt. Fifthly, that if any of them shouldfall into the hands of any to be examined, they would then be as careful asmight be to keep the poor ministers out of danger, who losing peradventurehereby their liberty of preaching, should lose all the means they had oftheir maintenance. Sixthly, that we should conclude with a prayer generalfor the whole state, which the old fatherly preacher65very well performed,even plentifully and powerfully praying and praising God for her Majesty,64Hotmilk curdled with ale, wine, or other alcohol.65[Master Evans]."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"322Demonic Possession and Exorcismthe Counsellors, Nobles, Magistrates, Ministers, people, those that werepresent, and lastly the poor delivered maid. Seventhly and lastly, that toshow our thankfulness we would seal it up with another sacrifice, namely,with contributing something that might be bestowed on some poor.This done, we sang a Psalm. The thirty fourth was called for, but the sixthwas chosen by that ancient preacher, which we sang with a low voice, verydecently and comfortably. And now it was past seven o’clock at night, andthe company began to talk of departing home. But see, the woman of thehouse66whose countenance truly I did behold before whilst the anguish wasgreatest. And I did imagine that she thought what a guest she had admittedinto her house, not knowing how quietly she should be rid of her again. Isay, the woman of the house had in the meantime, namely, whilst we wereconsulting, writing, and singing, bestirred herself and got together, whetherall of her own or with help of her neighbours, I cannot tell, sufficient storeof meat to refresh us all. Though it were not of the daintiest or most orderlyserved, yet I thought it was as comfortable a supper as ever I was at, puttingme in mind of Acts 2.42, ‘And they continued in the Apostles’ doctrineand fellowship, and breaking of bread and prayer.’The giving of thanks both before and after meat was committed to him67who had before desired to succeed in the action of thanksgiving after ourcomfort received. But being then, as I said, not hearkened to because itgrew late, and many things remained to be done, he now undertook thisoffice at the table very readily. And in his grace after meat he bestowed,as I think, some of his former meditations which he would have deliveredif he had been then allowed. For now in his thanksgiving after supper, hevery aptly recounted the songs of Moses and Myriam after the Red Sea,68of Deborah and Barak after Sisera’s overthrow,69of the women’s songconcerning David after his conquest of Goliath,70&c.By this time it was past nine o’clock. So rising from the table, we stoodawhile talking one with another, especially recording that of Luke 5.26,‘And they were all amazed, and praised God, and were filled with fear saying,66[Mistress Radcliffe in Shoreditch].67[Master Bridger].68Exodus15.69Judges5.701Samuel18.7."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover323“Doubtless we have seen strange things this day.”’ And here let me trulyreveal an apprehension which I had in the time of our trouble, namely, that wewere the more likely to succeed because we were such mean, base, despised,and contemptible men that were employed. For so God commonly worksby foolish things to confound the wise, and by weak instruments to bringdown the proud. And, as I remember in my poor prayer I noted, Satan isoftentimes overtaken in his craft. For by making his match thus to ragein and on little ones, as was this poor creature in respect of her sex andage, his foil should be the greater, when such a worm should be enabled towithstand his malice and prevail against his strength. But to return.Thus, though we were replenished with much joy, yet we dared not departwith banners displayed for fear of men. But we crept away by two and bythree in a company till we were all gone. But before I departed, I asked themaid a question or two. First, whether she did see anything depart from herwhen first she felt release? Whereunto she answered that she saw nothing,but she did feel something depart. And withal she felt such a freedom of allthe powers and faculties of soul and body as she never felt the like before,which caused her in that way to spring out for joy.But whether Mary Glover were possessed or dispossessed, I will notmaintain. For I see that that question grows not only disputable, but dan-gerous to hold. It passes my skill to define when a man may be said to bepossessed. For although many signs of possession, even such as the evange-lists do observe, may be found in anyone, yet to say how many of them, andin what degree they must concur to make proprium quarto modo,71apper-taining to that affliction, I see it hard to say. And I understand that a greatscholar of Cambridge, disputing that point not long ago, had even his handsfull of that work, inasmuch as some that heard it, conceived thereby, I meanby his defence, and by the terms of obsession and circumsession which hein his sense used, not that Satan was commanded to come out of the man,but the man was commanded to come out of the devil. Here also it may beremembered, that the Heads of the University would not admit his ques-tion to be disputed of as he propounded it, namely, Nulla est hiis diebus71Appropriate to a quarter measure."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"324Demonic Possession and Exorcismpossessio ac dispossessio Dæmoniorum,72but in their learned wisdom didfirst qualify the question, so making an abatement of his writ, nulla est hiisdeibus ordinaria possessio ac dispossessio Dæmoniorium.73But if a manconsider that the malice of Satan, the wickedness of men, and the justice ofGod are as great as ever they were, he will perhaps think whether he has readof any absolute revocation of any kind of punishment formerly inflicted orthreatened. No, our Sovereign King is more resolute in hisDaemonolo-gie,p.47, saying, ‘Why may God not use any kind of extraordinary punish-ment when it pleases him, as well as the ordinary rods of sickness or otheradversities,’ &c. Again, a man would think perhaps that those words of ourSaviour, ‘This kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting’74may be extendedto a further time than when miracles were wrought, especially if he do here-withal consider the practice of the Church in succeeding ages, whereuntoalso our King in his said book (lib.3, p. 71) gives good allowance.But a man may say, ‘Why then, you may cure palsy, gout, ague, andleprosies in a like way.’ I answer, ‘No, we have not the like warrant for thatkind, and physicians can tell the causes and cures of such maladies.’ But ifthey suspect witchery, not finding any natural distemperature of the body,they will not meddle. What then? Will such poor, distressed creatures be leftat sixes and sevens to sink or swim at Satan’s pleasure? God forbid. A man,Ihope, may at least say, ‘Lord have mercy on them.’ Though skill of physickherein does fail, yet this skill that taught physicians theirs, can work within,without, and above means and therefore is worthy to be called on, both whenthe means are used and when they fail. But, as I said, I will not meddle withthe question, only this, that Mary Glover was vexed by Satan, by the meansof a witch. Methinks I may safely say it, since the jury has found it, and theHonourable Judges determined so of it. And therefore I cannot think butthat they did a charitable and warrantable deed that prayed for her.The next day also I asked her whether she ever did pray so before, orwhether she could pray so again? To which her answer was, ‘I pray God72There is, in these days, neither possession nor dispossession of demons.73There is, in these days, usually neither possession nor dispossession of demons.74Mark9.29in the King James versions. Modern versions generally delete ‘and fasting’ on the groundsof the textual evidence."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"The story of Mary Glover325enable me to pray as I will have occasion.’ Again, I asked her merrilywhether she could now gape so wide as I might put in my fist. For a manthat will now look on her will not think her mouth could possibly stretch aswide as it did. Whereunto, with staid countenance, she answered nothing.But to draw to an end, because it was supported that the young recoveredsoldier might perhaps be set on again not long after, it was thought goodthat she should not be carried home to her Father’s house, but should lodgetogether with her Mother at one of the minister’s houses, which was doneaccordingly.The next day, there was a lecture not far off. And thither came the maidin the company of certain women, religious and matronly citizens. Thepreacher was he75that gave thanks at the table the night before. His text was2Thessalonians 12, ‘Grace be with you and mercy, and peace from Godour Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.’ Whether he made a deliberatechoice of this text or not I cannot tell. But sure I am that from the wordsof grace, free from God, and peace, the effect, first between God and man,then between man and man, and thirdly found and felt within man himself inhis own conscience, he raised and delivered such doctrine and use as I thinkthe poor party present made good use of. That night she, with her parents,was invited to sup with a religious citizen, who like Cornelius had calledtogether some of his kinsfolk and special friends, Acts 10. And he gavethanks before and after meat in a very good way, beyond my expectation, tosee an ordinary citizen perform it so well. But I can testify of a truth thatthe city is not destitute of many such as are very well qualified this way.This I do of purpose report, not only becauseS. H.jibes at his fraternityof holy, illuminate men, and at his sisternity of mymps, mops, and idle holywomen, but also because this citizen of whom I speak was bitterly taken upby the Bishop of London for performing, privately in his family as becameavirtuous Christian man, a religious duty of humiliation by prayer andfasting on an occasion of a heavy cross which at that time lay on one of hischildren. Again, I have heard jolly chaplains in their lofty vein scornfullyreport the practice of prayer and singing of Psalms in Londoners’ houses,75[Master Bridger who still yet lies in prison]."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"326Demonic Possession and Exorcismand also deride and scoff at their sober and religious behaviour in openassemblies at time of public prayer, and of the word preached.Well, the next day, Saturday is come, when divers of the preachers andothers repaired to the place where the maid had lodged, to understand howthings went with her, and that the more because a voice began to be raisedabroad that she was relapsed into her former estate, this being the day of herordinary fits. But thanks be to God it was not so. But being well all that day,at night she went with other company about half a mile to supper, whereappeared such a disposition in many as was sometimes in men that desired tosee even Lazarus that was raised, John 12. After supper, she returned to herformer lodging. And on the way homeward I noted this, that being weary ingoing up a street somewhat ascending, she was glad to sit down and rest on abench, saying, ‘O Lord, how is my strength abated. I could once run nimblyup and down our stairs. And being sent to market, I could lug home happilyaheavy burden without weariness.’ This I observe that it might appear, itwas not rest and slothfulness that caused her grief, which yet the oppositeDoctor insinuates in his treatise of the suffocation of the Mother.76The next day, being the Sabbath, she spent morning and afternoon inreligious exercises, being present at two public sermons, and behavingherself there christianly. That day also, there was thanks publicly given forher by a worthy preacher in his great assembly, who also had prayed forher there by name many times before. This thanksgiving he made, though Iknow that one of the aforesaid preachers of our company was very carefulthat notice might in time be given him to forbear, because he knew that itstood not with the Bishop’s liking that it should be so, even as in the timeof her grievous vexations there was a notice given by means of the Bishopof London. He could never yet be gotten to ‘Come and see,’ although sentto and earnestly moved by certain worshipful and honourable personagesto that end. There was, I say, a fear cast on such as resorted to her, wherebythey were terrified either to pray themselves, or to be present at prayer forher, inasmuch as at one time, when in a terrible fit the beholders were muchamazed, there was a gracious young gentleman that called for prayer.

For I find, I praiseGod, therein a labour of his love towards me, provoking, nay, urging me themore thereby to perform a point which I begged then in my poor prayers,namely, that that may be found in us, which Moses on an occasion whichcaused like humiliation prayed for in his Israelites, ‘Oh that this peoplehad such an heart in them continually.’ And here I appeal to the hearts andconsciences of all that were there present, whether they did not then find inthemselves a great measure of a Christian disposition to good. And I prayagain, as then and there I did, that God would remove that judgement farfrom us, that we should be like swine returning to the mire.But to conclude, the next Wednesday she was at the lecture at theBlackfriars. And from thence returned home to her parents who are religiouspersons, of good credit and estimation among their neighbours.

Along with the Cock Lane Ghost, the Drummer of Ted-worth, the Ghost of Julius Caesar and Mary Toft the woman who gavebirth to live rabbits, there is pictured a small boy huddled beneath the pul-pit, vomiting hob nails and iron staples. The youth pictured is the twelveor thirteen-year-old William Perry, otherwise known as the boy of Bilson,who confessed on8October1620to having counterfeited his possession.The Boy of Bilsonis a collection of texts brought together by RichardBaddeley, secretary to the inquiry which led to the apparent exposure ofWilliam Perry. It consists of seven different texts. The first of these is adiscourse on the Catholic exorcising of unclean spirits in twenty-threeadvertisements or admonitions, the last of which is the account of theexorcism of William Perry by Master Wheeler, one of the priests involved.1There then follows an account of the trial of the witch accused of bewitchingPerry, and of Perry’s exposure as a fraud probably written by Baddeley. Twoexaminations and confessions of Perry before Thomas Morton, Bishop ofLichfield and Coventry, are followed by Perry’s acknowledgement of hiscounterfeit. The edition concludes with the Catholic gentleman ThomasNechils’ declaration that Wheeler’s written account of the case was a genuineone, personally given to him by the priest.The treatise as a whole is meant to expose the pretence of Catholic priests‘exorcizing and expelling of devils out of bodies possessed’.2The confessionsof Perry can be read as suggesting that the Catholic priests involved in hisexorcism were as much the credulous dupes of Perry as many others. Thereis the hint that the mysterious old man called Thomas who, according toPerry had instructed him in demoniacal skills, was a Catholic plant.3Butthere is no reason to think of Thomas as anything else but the product of1Only the twenty third admonition is transcribed below.2Anon.,1622,sig.a.3.r (see below, p.335).3Seeanon.,1622,pp.61–2(see below, pp.348–9).331"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"332Demonic Possession and ExorcismPerry’s imaginative desire to lay blame everywhere but upon himself. Andwecan read the account of the exorcism of Perry by the priest Wheeleras one which arose from his conviction that Perry was not a fake but wasgenuinely possessed, even if he took every opportunity in the exorcism itselfto highlight Catholic truths and demonise Protestantism.Beall that as it may, even if the texts themselves are various and ambigu-ous with respect to the involvement of the priests in any counterfeit,Perry’s confession did provide Baddeley with the opportunity editoriallyto present the Catholic priests involved in Perry’s exorcism as active fellow-conspirators in his fraud. And even if Perry did not name the priests asinstigators of his pretence, he certainly says enough to suggest that, at theveryleast, they, along with the large crowds who came to view him, werewilling participants in a play which he cleverly directed, in which he starred,and, along with the other participants was a co-writer of the script.Around Easter1620,William Perry was cursed by an old womanunknown to him. Within days, he fell into fits so extreme that up to fourmen could hardly hold him. He brought up pins, wool, thread, feathers,and so on. He could not digest food, his tongue was stiff and hard androlled up towards the roof of his mouth so that he seldom spoke. He coulddiscern the presence of the woman he claimed had bewitched him, andcould not endure hearing the beginning of St John’s Gospel. In short, heshowed the symptoms of possession.After visits by several priests, the first of whom diagnosed possession bythree spirits, Wheeler arrived around Thursday beforeCorpus Christidayand began to exorcise the boy with holy water, oil, and frankincense. Atvarious times, William attested to the truth of Catholicism. His possessionwas both good and bad. He exhorted his family to become Catholics, hesaw the devil assault him in the form of a blackbird when Puritans werepresent, he acted out the fate of those who died outside of the CatholicChurch, and especially Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Foxe. Buthe also accused the priest of killing him, and cursed him saying, ‘A poxof God light on the Priest.’4After the departure of the priest around midJune, Perry was as much tortured as before, a result Wheeler attributes toWilliam’s father having sought the assistance of witches and sorcerers.5The accused witch, Joan Cocke, was brought before the summer Assizeson10August1620.Judicial scepticism, now fostered by King James, sawthe charges as the result of ‘fantastical delusions’.6The woman was quickly4Anon.,1622,p.52(see below, p.342).5Ewen(1933), p.236interprets these as Protestants.6Anon.,1622,p.61(see below, p.345)."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry333found innocent, and William Perry handed over to Thomas, Lord Bishopof Lichfield and Coventry and placed in the Castle of Eccleshall.Doubts about Perry remained, some symptoms suggestive of fraud, oth-ers of a natural disease. The Bishop was determined to test the authenticityof his possession by reading to Perry passages from St John’s Gospel inGreek: ‘Boy, it is either you or the Devil that abhors those words of theGospel. And if it be the Devil, . . . he knows and understands all languagesin the world. So he cannot but know when I recite the same sentence in theGospel out of the Greek text. But if it be yourself, then you are an execrablewretch, who plays the Devil’s part, in loathing that part of the Gospel ofChrist’.7Having fallen into a fit at the reading of the twelfth verse, and nothaving done so at the reading of the first verse of the first chapter, Perrywas exposed.Hisattempt to avoid further examination by feigning illness and colour-ing his urine with black ink having been discovered, Perry confessed on8October1620,tohis having faked possession, and having been taughtdemoniacal skills by the mysterious Thomas. There is no doubt he hadenjoined his time as a celebrity: ‘He answers, because many people didresort to him, and brought him many good things.’8Hewas held in Eccle-shall Castle until26July in the following year when his recovery wascomplete. Brought back to the Stafford Assizes, he begged for pardon fromGod, and from Joan Cocke, forgiveness.The boy of Bilson was a site of conflicting interests. For Richard Baddeley,Perry’s imposture was a key element of the anti-Catholicism which anchoredhis edition of the story of William Perry. For the priest Wheeler, he providedan (ultimately unsuccessful) occasion to demonstrate the power of theChurch against Protestants. For the judiciary, he was deluded at best, afraud at worst, but not a site of bewitchment. As for Perry, he constructedhis own role opportunistically to reflect the interests of those who variouslystepped onto his stage. The last we hear of William Perry is his publiclyrequesting ‘the whole country, whom he had so notoriously and wickedlyscandalized, to admit of that his so hearty confession, for their satisfaction’.97Anon.,1622,pp.58–9(see below, p.346).8Anon.,1622,pp.69–70(see below, p.353).9Anon.,1622,p.73(see below, p.356)."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"The boy of Bilson: or, a true discovery of thelate notorious impostures of certain Romish Priests intheir pretended Exorcism, or expulsion of the Devilout of a young Boy, named William Perry, son ofThomas Perry of Bilson, in the County ofStafford, Yeoman.On which occasion, hereunto is premittedAbrief Theological Discourse, by way of Caution,for the more easy discerning of such Romish spirits,and judging of their false pretences, both in thisand the like Practices.2Thess 2.10,11.Because they received not the love of the truth, that theymight be saved.

But I said that if he would not deal with witches and40[A conjecture why the child might be possessed].41[The child, being himself, denies all the Devil had uttered by his tongue]."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry343sorcerers, I would come as often as I could. The Father42said that he wouldseek witches or any other for help. I, being sorry to hear his bad resolution,told him that I would not mingle God and the Devil together. And thenIgot his promise that he would not use holy water and blessed oil if theymeddled with witches. Yet I hear that he has not complied with his promisein the extremities of the boy’s fits, having recourse to blessed things, sayingthat he will beat him with them. Well, the substance of all this that I havehere written, at my coming away, I declared before three Protestants andthe child’s parents, desiring them that, if I did not speak truth in all things,they would challenge me therein. Then the child being in a sounding fit,and anointing him with holy oil, I brought him to himself, inasmuch as hewalked up and down with a staff. And since then, he did eat, drink, sleep, andwalk, having only short fits, as I am faithfully informed, yea, till shortly afterthey entertained many witches and sorcerers. Notwithstanding the help ofthese, sought in vain, he is more grievously tormented than ever before.Here, before my departure, the parents of the child offered me money andgold. I refused it. And thanking them, I said that if they would give me twentypounds, I would not have one penny, charging them that they should notendanger their own souls and the soul of the poor boy in seeking unlawfulmeans. And thus, Monday was a fortnight since I left him. And the truth ofthis, I must say with St Paul, that God knows that in all this I do not lie.Thus, desiring that all may succeed to God’s glory, the good of the child,and the confusion of all sorceries and charms which in my heart and soul Idetest, I leave the parents, child, and you, Christian reader, to the mercy ofGod.July the first, 1620.Non nobis Domine, non nobis, sed Nomini tuo da Gloriam.43Yours in charity, love, orin any good office,J.

In those fits, he appeared both deaf and blind,writhing his mouth aside, continually groaning and panting and, althoughoften pinched with men’s fingers, pricked with needles, tickled also onhis sides, and once whipped with a rod, besides other like extremities, yetcould he not be discerned, by either shrieking or shrinking, to show theleast passion or feeling. Out of his fits, he took, as might be thought, nosustenance which he could digest but, together with it, did void and castout of his mouth, rags, thread, straw, crooked pins, &c. Both in and out ofhis fits, his belly, by wilful and continual abstinence deceiving his own guts,was almost as flat as his back. Besides this, his throat was swollen and hard,his tongue stiff and rolled up towards the roof of his mouth, inasmuch ashe seemed always dumb, save that he would speak once in a fortnight orthree weeks, and that but in very few words.Two things there were which gave most just reason for the presumptionthat he was possessed and bewitched. One was that he would still discernwhen that woman44who was supposed to have bewitched him was broughtinto any room where he was, although she were very secretly conveyedthither, as was one time tried before the Grand Jury at Stafford. The secondwas that, though he would abide other passages of Scripture, yet he couldnot endure the repeating of that text, viz., ‘In the beginning was the Word,’44[Joan Cocke]."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry345&c., John 1.1. But instantly rolling his eyes and shaking45his head like onedistracted, he would fall into his usual fits of groaning, panting, distraction,&c. In this plight, he continued many months to the great wonder andastonishment of thousands, who from divers parts came to see him. Thusmuch of his cunning.The means of discovering his dissimulation.At the summer Assizes held at Stafford, the tenth of August, Anno Domini1620, the46aforementioned woman, supposed to have been the witch, wasbrought to her trial before the Right Worshipful Sir Peter Warburton, andSir John Davies, Knights, then his Majesty’s Justices of Assize for thatCounty. Before them, there appeared some slender circumstances whichwere vulgarly esteemed strong proofs of witchcraft. But after some speechmanifesting the idleness of such fantastical delusions, the woman was freedby the Inquest. At this time, the Judges were pleased to commit the careand, if it might so be, the cure of the boy to the Lord Bishop of Coventryand Litchfield, then and there present. He had been with him at the Castle ofEccleshall about a month, much of which time his Lordship was necessarilyabsent from home. There were divers symptoms though which gave justcause to suspect that he did but counterfeit, namely, the easy and equalbeating of his pulse in his strongest fits, his quiet rest and sleep, commonlythe whole night long, his clear complexion, his swallowing of whole morselsof bread without chewing which plainly tells every beholder that his tonguelied in saying nothing, his spitting forth from him as naturally and perfectlyas ever he could do in his best health, neither of which could possiblybe done with a tongue turned upwards and doubled towards his throat,as he would seem to have it. Besides these, there was his usual comingforth from his fits always with one kind of loud and large tuneful groan.Notwithstanding these, his usual vomiting up of his meat, his much fastingand lank belly, his patience or as it might rather seem senseless stupidity inenduring those many prickings and violent extremities without any sign offeeling did yet argue some bodily disease and infirmity.45[John1.1].46[Summer Assizes held at Stafford, xviii.

Nevertheless, after a long expectation of such a one,an occasion offered itself which required and exacted a more speedy andpresent trial.The Father of the boy, an honest husbandman of sufficient ability, inno-cent and ignorant of any practice in his child, came with an aunt of his tosee him. When he was out of his fit, the Father earnestly demanded whatmight be thought of his son’s case, and whether he were possessed or not.Whereto it was purposely answered that nothing seemed so marvellous orso much to betoken such a thing as that, at the hearing of those words ofthe Holy Gospel of Saint John, ‘In the beginning was the Word,’47&c., hestill used to fall into his fits. For further proof whereof then, presently, inthe Father’s hearing, those words were repeated. And accordingly, on therepetition thereof, the boy fell instantly into his fit. ‘Lo,’ his Father thensaid, ‘do you see? What think you of this?’ ‘This,’ said the Bishop, ‘I likevery well. For on this I must begin to work.’The same day in the afternoon, when word was brought that the boy didspeak, divers resorted to him. The Bishop, calling for a Greek Testament,said to him, ‘Boy, it is either you or the Devil that abhors those words ofthe Gospel. And if it be the Devil, being so ancient a scholar of almostsix thousand years’ standing, he knows and understands all languages inthe world. So he cannot but know when I recite the same sentence in theGospel out of the Greek text. But if it be yourself, then you are an execrablewretch who plays the Devil’s part, in loathing that part of the Gospel ofChrist which, above all other Scriptures, expresses the admirable union ofthe God-head and manhood in one Christ and Saviour, which union is thearch-pillar of man’s salvation. Wherefore, look to yourself, for now youare to be put to trial. And mark diligently whether it be that same Scripturewhich will be read to you, at the reading whereof you do seem to be somuch troubled and tormented.’47[John1.1]."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry347Then was read to him in Greek the twelfth verse of the first chapter ofSaint John’s Gospel (\u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011 \u0012\u0013 \u0014\u0015\u0016\u0017\u0010\u0018 \u0016\u0019\u001a\u0010\u0018,&c.)48which he, supposingit to be the first verse, accordingly fell into the passion of a trance, as he wasformerly wont.This fit being quickly passed over, next was read to him in Greek thefirst verse, being indeed the aforesaid text,\u0004\u0018\u000b\u001b\u001c\u001d\u001e \u001f\u0018\u000e \u0015\u0010!\u0010\"# $\u0016\u0011&c.49Yet he, suspecting that it was not the same text, was not any whit troubledtherewith.By this means was his notable fraud, in a manner, fully discovered, inas-much as he seemed to be greatly confounded herewith. Notwithstanding,staring with his eyes and casting his head on both sides of the bed whereonhe lay that he might dissemble his dissimulation the better, he told thecompany that he was troubled at the sight of two mice.After this discovery, to the end that he might be freed from further trialand be sent home again to his Father, he complained of extreme sicknessand, by writing as well as he could, did signify that he had a great pain in hisbelly. And the morning following, making water in a urinal, his water was asblack as ink. For there were some people that wrote very legibly therewith.And in the like manner, two days following, he seemed to make water ofthe same colour. In the making of this, so that he might the more cunninglydissemble, he vehemently groaned. And thereupon, one came into the roomto him. The boy showed him his manner of making water, whereof a littletrace then came from him of the same black tincture, which he purposelyhad reserved within the skin to make it appear that it so came immediatelyfrom him.But the third day following, which was the Lord’s day, by diligent watch-fulness and other means which were used to observe him, he was espiedmixing ink with his urine, and nimbly conveying the ink-horn into a privateplace. When he was suddenly caught in this his stealth, after an earnest butloving exhortation made to him, this deaf began to hear and dumb to speak.And at the sight of his ungracious and godless practices, he broke out intoplentiful tears, confessing all to his own shame and God’s glory.

But I cannot remember his surname. Hehad a gray beard, russet apparel, and carried a cradle of glasses or pots onhis back. He spoke to me in this manner. “Now, pretty boy, where do youdwell? Do you go to school? If you will do as I will teach you, you will notneed to go to school. For,” said he, “I can teach you such tricks and featsthat the people that see you will believe that you are bewitched, and so willlament and pity you.” Whereupon I, being willing not to go to school forfear of whipping, desired to learn such tricks. By and by, this old man beganto teach me first, how to groan and moan. Next, how to roll and cast up myeyes, so that nothing but the white of the eye would be seen. After that, hetaught me to twist and turn my neck and head both ways towards my back,then to gape hideously with my mouth and grate with my teeth, to clingand draw in my belly and guts, to stretch out my legs and clutch my hands.After that, he taught me to put crooked pins, rags, and such like baggageinto my mouth, that I might seem to vomit them up. And “although,” saidhe, “some folk will put you to pain by pricking and pinching you, yet youmust endure all patiently.” In this way, he taught and learned me some sixseveral times privately in a close, where none could see us.And further, that old man made me believe that a body possessed couldnot endure to hear the first verse of the first chapter of St John’s Gospel,viz., “In the beginning was the Word,” &c.,50and that therefore whensoever50[John1.1]."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry349Iheard it, then I should fall into my fits. Besides, he willed me that I shouldbegin to do these feats when it next happened that I was sick, and that thenIshould accuse somebody or other, whom I had heard to be accounted awitch, to have bewitched me. And thereupon afterwards, of myself, I didaccuse one Joan Cocke. And I was once minded to have made my picturein clay and to have conveyed it into her house, for the better proof of herbewitching me.’Being examined how long after it was that he began to put these thingsinto practice and on what occasion, he answered, ‘Not long after, which wasabout the Easter following, I began to be sick, and my Father sought helpfor me in divers places. And then some Papists did persuade him to seek forhelp at the hands of some Catholic Priests. But my Mother desired ratherto have some learned scholar or Divine that was no Papist. Yet at length,by their persuasions, there was first brought to me a Priest, of a fairly tallstature, with long black hair, in a greenish suit, his doublet51opened underthe armpits with ribbons.As soon as he came to me, he drew a stone out of his pocket and hungit about my neck. He said some Latin prayers over me, also putting hisfinger into my mouth. Whereupon I seemed to come out of my fit. Afterthat, he made holy-water and witch-water, saying certain prayers over them,and putting salt into the witch-water. Then he gave me a bottle full of oneof those waters. But of which I do not remember. He willed me now andthen to cast some of it over my bed. And he himself, with a little hyssop,did sprinkle me therewith also. Before he went away, he said certain otherLatin words or prayers over those waters which to my remembrance didsound thus, “Eggse eggse atque famulo Dei Gulihelmo ante damnando,”and more thereof I cannot remember.The next morning, as I remember, this Priest came again. At this time,because I lay in a lower room where many people thronged in to see me,they moved me into an upper room, more private and fitter for them topray in. There they continued. And they used the like means towards meas they had done before, betwixt a fortnight and three weeks period, during51[Priest]."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"350Demonic Possession and Exorcismwhich time I continued my wonted fits. Then at last, this Priest said that hecould not help me because he lacked a book. He sent for this from London.But after the book was brought, he then said that he could not help mewithout the aid of another Priest whom, after that, he brought with him.He was a52short, big, fat man, with blackish long curled hair, in a kind ofrusset-coloured suit, with a sword by his side. As soon as he saw me, hesaid that, by the help of God and our Lady and the holy Saints of Heaven, hewould either cast the Devil out of me that night, or else it should go hard.And first, he drew out a little book of the size of a Pueriles, from which hecontinued praying until about eleven o’clock at night, and casting holy wateron me.Then both of these Priests went away. But they came again to me inthe morning. And then they made as much holy water as a pail could hold.But in the end they confessed that they could do me no good without thehelp of a third Priest, whom53they did send for through a weaver of ourtown.About a week after, the third Priest came, being a reasonably tall, old manin a horseman’s coat, with long head-hair. Before he came to our house, hedid say to the man that fetched him, as I heard, that if the spirits came to me,then I was obsessed, but if they were within me, then I was possessed. Thebig, fat Priest came in with this last Priest. And first, he put his finger intomy mouth. And he said that I was bewitched at the tongue’s end. Wherefore,he bade me drink three or four draughts of holy water, which I did. Hetaught me also to pray to the Virgin Mary, and to my good Angel, and to allthe Saints in Heaven to help me. Then he washed my head, feet, and bellywith the same water saying now and then to me, “You are now somewhatbetter, boy?” And I would say, “Yes, a little better.”About the same time, my Father came home one day before supper. Heasked me what I had seen in my fits. And I told him that a thing came to mein the likeness of a blackbird. And now the Priest that came last to me wentout of town, these three Priests having been with me about three weeks.But they could do me no good.52[Second priest].53[Third priest]."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry351About a week after, the big fat Priest came again. And he held to hisformer course,54and said that by God’s grace he would help me. About thistime, he gave a sermon to certain Catholics who were with me. He had onawhite surplice, with a stole as I remember they called it about his neck.His text was, “My flesh is bread indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.”After his sermon, he prayed with me as he had used to do. And then hemade another pail-full of holy-water, wishing them to boil certain herbs inwater, to wash me withal, such as thyme, hyssop, and such like.On the Sunday following, people came in so thickly to see me that thePriest dared not preach. And he intended to be gone the next day.His fashion was to bless and cross all the meat which both themselvesand I did eat, so that when my Mother once gave me some of a syllabub,which the Priest had not crossed in the same manner, he told them thatthere was a Puritan spirit entered into it.These three Priests entreated me at sundry times that I should confessmy sins to them. Sometimes I did this when I chose to speak. But that wasbut now and then. They wished me also to turn to their religion, and then Iwould have help.On that Sunday night before this fat Priest was to go away, he said that,by the help of the blessed Virgin, and the angels and Saints in Heaven, hewould cast the Devil out of me.Alittle after, he began to ask certain questions of the Spirit within me.First, what would become of the Puritans when they died? And he toldme that, if they went to Hell, then the spirit would tug and shake the bed-clothes, which I did do after the same manner he bade me. Next, he askedwhat would become of Roman Catholics, and if they would go to Heaven?And then, in sign thereof, he said that I should lift up my hands, which I didalso.Then the Priest said, “Come out of your fits, Will, in the name of theFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Whereupon I seemed tocome out of a fit. And then he prayed by me, and said that he would castthree devils out of me that night. And so he hung about my neck and put54[Second priest]."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"352Demonic Possession and Exorcismunder my arm a fine stole, wrought with great silver letters. And with theone end thereof, being very hard, he did beat me about the head and faceuntil, to my thinking, he made me black and blue, chafing and rubbing myneck with that stole. It was so rough that it made my neck very sore. Andstill he spoke to the Spirits within me thus, “Come out, you rogues, youvillains. I charge you by God and the blessed Virgin, and by all the angelsand Saints in Heaven, that you allow the boy to eat and sleep.” And withal,he stamped with his feet as he spoke those words.Then he told my Father that he would throw out those three Spirits oneafter another, so that they would plainly see them come forth. And if heshould do so, he asked my Mother whether she would become a Catholic,or not. She answered him that she would consider it. “Then,” said he, “Iwill also consider whether I will help your son or not.”But yet the Priest continued as he had begun. And he said to me, “Ifthere be three devils in you, then give three knocks as a sign thereof.” Andso I did. But at the biggest devil, he willed me to give the greatest thump,which I did at the last. And still the Priest did beat me with his stole. Andso he continued with me till about three o’clock in the morning, duringwhich time certain Papists were sent to pray with me, bringing hallowedcandles with them.At the same time, the Priest took such55things as I had seemed to vomit.And burning them with frankincense, he took an old rusty sword and saidaLatin prayer, resembling it to the sword wherewith Peter did cut offMalchus’s ear. He also beat the same things with a hammer, betokeningthat hammer which nailed Christ to the cross.The morning being come, the Priest was to be gone. And then my Fathersaid to him, “Sir, I see you can do my child no good. And therefore Imust seek for some other help.” “Yes” said the Priest, “you will go seekfor help from witches to ease his body, but you care not for damning hissoul.” But yet, before he went away, he hallowed more water, and then hedeparted.’55[Viz., crooked pins, straw, &c., and such things as the boy could find and steal into his mouth, ashe did once half a knitting needle]."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The story of William Perry353And here the boy was allowed to pause andrepose himself, by reason of his weakness.And was not then furtherexamined till the next time.The second examination and answer of the saidWilliam Perry, made to certain other questions, which onjust and special presumptions were propounded to him by theReverend Father in God, Thomas, Lord Bishop of Coventryand Lichfield, taken at Eccleshall Castle, the thirteenthday of October. Anno Domini 1620.First, it was demanded of him, seeing the old man called Thomas persuaded56him that at length he would be cured by some Popish Priest, whether hemeant not accordingly in the end to seem to be dispossessed by some orone such of them?He answers, yes, and further, that thereupon57he meant to become aPapist.Second, he was asked why then, if he did mean so after so long a timeand so great pains taken about him by those Priests, would he not yield totheir exorcisms and seem to be dispossessed by their means?He answers, because many people did resort to him, and brought himmany good things, and also that he was not willing to go to school again.Yet in the end, his intention was to be helped by them.Third, he was asked whether in his grief and fear that all would cometo light, after58he saw himself half discovered, he had not an intent to dohimself some bodily mischief. He answers that he had. For, says he, ‘TheDevil had59steeled my heart, so that I cared not to hang myself, and hadintended to do so one night, but that I was watched and hindered.’Fourthly, he was asked how it could be thought that he would be movedby any Papist60to charge a woman for bewitching him who was herself anobstinate recusant?56[First].57[Second].58[Third].59[It was his own word].60[Fourth]."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"354Demonic Possession and ExorcismHe answers that he was moved by Thomas the old man to lay it on somewoman so suspected, but that only by himself, without the persuasion ofany other, he named this61woman, because she was a woman ill thought ofand suspected of such like things.He was here put in mind of the desire which formerly, before his dis-covery, he had62to be prayed for, as was accordingly then done but, as atthe same time was told him, it was done not to drive the Devil out of hisbody, but only out of his soul, wherein the Devil had possessed him by adevilish obstinacy of his heart in faining himself to be bodily possessed ofthe Devil. And being further reminded how, after those prayers, he wroteon a paper that he had found much ease thereby, he was hereupon demandedwhether he did not as then intend and resolve with himself to make an endof his former course and counterfeit practices, and seem to be dispossessedby such prayers.He answers that it was indeed in his mind to do so, because he had thenwearied himself with dissembling so long, and was also in fear of beingdiscovered and found out.And although this was easily discerned to have been his resolution, yet, aswas at that time told him, it did not become the professors of truth to imitatethe Popish Priests in such cases, who falsely arrogated to themselves suchan Apostolical power, by exorcizing to expell devils, although it mightin man’s opinion much work for the glorifying of God, the edifying ofChristian people in our Church, and also for the converting of Romishrecusants to our true religion.

As Diane Purkiss has remarked, ‘The voiceof Mary Moor[e] comes and goes like a distant radio station, now vivid,now obscured by other signals. The result inevitably is hard to follow.’4The voices of Margaret and her mother are sometimes fused. Margaretspeaks often in her mother’s defence. She complains to her angels, forexample, ‘“No justice abroad, no peace at home.

For that godless thief Dorothy Swinow, by the instigationof the Devil, had hardened the heart of both judges and justices againsther. And now at this instant,” she said, “she is using means to harden herhusband’s heart against her too.” This she knows will be the cruellest of allto her. And she has begun withal to consume her eldest sister. And she saidthat she would go to the Judge this night or tomorrow morning, and begonce more for justice.’5Margaret worries too that the ‘hardening of folks’hearts against her [Mother] will be insufferable’.6Swinow and her fellowwitches sought her Mother’s life, ‘but could not get it’.7The story is further confused by the complex family relations of MaryMoore. The children who are bewitched (Margaret, her eldest brother, andher sister), along with two others, are those of Mary to her deceased husbandGeorge Muschamp. A niece, Elizabeth Muschamp, is also in residence.Maryis married to Edward Moore whose children (six sons and a daughter)from his first marriage also live in the house. During the story, a furtherchild, Sibilla Moore, is conceived, is born, and dies. Margaret had accusedDorothy of attempting to kill this child while in the womb. It is for thepost-natal death of this child that Dorothy Swinow is eventually indicted.Unusually, for a case of witchcraft accusation by one bewitched, there isno suggestion of a direct conflict between Margaret and Dorothy Swinow.Butthere is a fairly evident history of bad feelings between Mary Mooreand Dorothy Swinow. ‘I fear her more than anyone else’8declares Mary ofDorothy, before her suspicions of Dorothy’s witchcraft are firm. Margaretsees her own woes as the result of Dorothy’s hatred of her mother.9AndDorothy Swinow was later to be accused by John Hutton, ‘one of whom itwas suspected that he could do more than God allowed of ’,10and MargaretMuschamp of bewitching to death Mary’s sister Lady Margery Hambleton,the better to gain access to an inheritance for her son.11During the course of Margaret Muschamp’s illness, a variety of people isaccused of having bewitched her: the cunning man John Hutton who diesin prison during the course of the story (accused by Margaret); DorothySwinow, the wife of Colonel Swinow (initially accused by Margaret andlater by John Hutton); later two other women are accused of witchcraft,‘the Miller’s and the Webster’s Wives’12(initially accused by Hutton, andlater by Margaret) – these are presumably Margaret White, who confessesin her deposition to having collaborated with Dorothy, along with her sister5Anon.,1650,p.14(see below, p.378).6Anon.,1650,p.16(see below, p.379).7Anon.,1650,p.19(see below, p.383).8Anon.,1650,p.6(see below, p.369).9Seeanon.,1650,p.15(see below, p.379).10Anon.,1650,p.7(see below, p.370).11Seeanon.,1650,p.9(see below, p.372).12Seeanon.,1650,p.10(see below, p.373)."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"360Demonic Possession and ExorcismJane Martin, in attempting to kill Mary’s children, and of having succeededin the case of the infant Sibilla.13The exact chronology of Margaret Muschamp’s affliction is difficult todetermine. But the whole text has a liturgical rhythm to it. Both Mary andMargaret used the old Anglican calendar. Margaret’s affliction came to anend on2February1648,onthe feast of Candlemas. It was on Lammas, thefirst of August, that her sister’s torments began,14her brother’s on St John’sDay.15Atthe time of her deliverance in February1648,itwas, according toher, exactly two years and one day since she had been first afflicted, that is,on Candlemas Eve1646.16Butshe had her first visions of angels some twomonths before Michaelmas and therefore around the beginning of August(Lammas)1645.17Herfirst affliction on Lammas was a divine malady, although it frightenedher Mother sufficiently to call in assistance. Margaret was in a ‘heavenlyrapture’ and continued all night receiving heavenly visions.18Shewas amodel of children’s piety throughout her troubles. When physicians werecalled in ‘her signs from the beginning were, “Away with these Doctors’drugs.” God had laid it on her, and God would take it off her.’19Godfed herwith angel food. Her angelic friends came and saved her from her enemies.Sheconversed for hours with her angels, which she vividly described as‘embodied like birds, as big as turkeys, and faces like Christians, but thesweetest creatures that ever eyes beheld’.20Shewas a visible link betweenheaven and earth, and crowds flocked to see her.Hertorments began on Candlemas Eve1646.Losing the use of her limbs,unable to speak or eat, she has violent fits. She now becomes a tormentedmartyr. ‘Privately to be “tormented’ may have meant achieving at last aperfection – psychic, bodily, spiritual – which the godly child must alwaysseek but never complacently discover in herself, a perfection that couldnever be acknowledged or reflected by parents, but only by an outsideagency – angels, ministers of grace.’2113Seeanon.,1650,pp.24–5(see below, pp.388–9).14Seeanon.,1650,p.21(see below, p.385).15Seeanon.,1650,p.4(see below, p.367).16Seeanon.,1650,p.21(see below, p.385).17Seeanon.,1650,p.1(see below, p.364). Sense can only be made of the chronology within the text ifweassume that Margaret’s release was on Candlemas day1648.The chronology is then as follows. Ifher torments finished two years and one day before Candlemas as Margaret claims (see p.21,belowp.385), then she fell ill on Candlemas Eve (as is suggested on p.2,below p.365),1646.This wouldmake her first visions in August1645(two months before Michaelmas), and her brother’s illness fromDecember1646,inthe Christmas following her Candlemas Eve torments (see. p.4,below p.367)and some thirteen months before her eventual release (see p.21,below p.385). Her sister would thenhave fallen ill in August1647.18Anon.,1650,p.2(see below, p.364).19Anon.,1650,p.3(see below, p.365).20Anon.,1650,p.12(see below, p.375).21Purkiss,1998,p.238."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp361Margaret appears to be saved by the godly prayers of the Puritans RichardBalsom and others.22Something of a latter day John Darrell, Balsom’s suc-cess with Margaret was noted in an account of his life, as was his exorcism inBerwick during the same period of the Scottish steward of Lord Granson.23ButBalsom’s success was shortlived, his prayers a failure. For Mary, Balsomhad failed to diagnose correctly the cause of Margaret’s afflictions. Withinseven or eight weeks, Margaret’s torments began again, and her brotherfell ill.The nature of the torments has now changed. Margaret is the victim ofaphysical assault. She has become a site of conflict between evil forces andher angels: ‘as if some were striking at her, she seemed to save herself fromblows with hands and bedclothes, portraying a wretched creature as we allknew after by her description. Sometimes he would fight with her in theshape of a dragon, of a bear, a horse, or cow...Andgood things, she said,fought for her and still got the better of him. The enemy’s weapons wereaclub, a staff, a sword, and dagger.’24Inanote written in code, Margaretaccuses John Hutton and Dorothy Swinow of the attacks.The text inhabits a world of magic and counter-magic. Mary becomesconvinced that Margaret is bewitched. Margaret declares that drops ofDorothy’s or Hutton’s blood are necessary to save her life. Hutton giveshis blood to Mary and her companions who visit him in Sunderland, butonly after she threatened ‘his heart-blood would go’25if he would not bebled. They encounter an unusually wild storm on the return journey toBerwick. The storm signifies witchcraft in the air, as do the two lambswhich accompany them divine protection. Margaret celebrates the blood:‘for these two drops of blood had saved her life. Otherwise she wouldhave been seven years in torment without any ease, or death would havecome.’26Hutton is brought to Berwick to provide more blood, this timefor Margaret’s brother. While he is there, Margaret is quiet, but after hisdeparture, she falls into a terrible fit.As the drama proceeded, Mary and those around her came more andmore to inhabit the world which Margaret progressively created extempore.Margaret’s angels had been frightened away for three months.27Atthe timeof their expected return, a crowd gathered. For two hours, the spectatorslistened to her discourse with the angels: ‘With the tears running downher face, she prayed for her enemy Dorothy Swinow that if the Lord hadmercy in store, to grant her it.

Her Mother, being frightened, called company, and withmuch ado recovered her. As soon as the child looked up, she cried out,‘Dear Mother, weep not for me. For I have seen a happy sight, and heard ablessed sound. For the Lord has so loved my poor soul that he has causedhis blessed trumpet to sound in my ears, and has sent two blessed angelsto receive my sinful soul. Oh, weep not for me, but rejoice that the Lordwould have such respect to so sinful a wretch as I am, as to send his heavenlyangels to receive my sinful soul.’ Among many other divine expressions, shecalled, ‘Good Mother, send for my dear brother and honest Master Huet.Perhaps the Lord will give me leave to see them. That faithful man may helpmy soul forward in praying with me, and for me. For we know the prayers ofthe faithful are very powerful with the Lord.’ They, being three miles off inthe Holy Island, were sent for and, with what speed might be, came. All thiswhile in her heavenly rapture, she uttered such words as were admirable to thebeholders. Her brother and the Minister came to her, who heard her expressmuch joy. The Minister exhorted her. To him she gave such satisfaction,that he blessed God in showing such mercy to a child of eleven years old. Allthat night she continued, apprehending these heavenly visions, the Ministerpraying with her and for her, as she desired him. Afterwards she fell into alittle rest. And when she awoke, she remembered nothing that she had said ordone."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp365Witnesses to this, first,Master Huet, Minister.Mistress Kennedy, her two brothers and two sisters, with her Mother.George Robinson, and his wife.Katherine Graeme.Odnel Selby, and his wifeMargaret Dickson, with divers others in the house then present.After this she continued well till Candlemas.On Candlemas Eve, betwixt the hours of one and two in the afternoon,being the Sabbath, her Mother with most of her servants were at Church.Only her two brothers and two sisters were with her. She was suddenlystricken with a great deal of torment. She called for a little beer. But beforethey could come with it, the use of her tongue was gone, with all her limbs,striving to vomit, and such torments that no eyes could look on her withoutcompassion. Her Mother, coming home with a sad heart, beheld her childand used what means she could. But there was no ease till eleven or twelveo’clock at night when she fell into a slumber and slept till six in the morning.As soon as Berwick gates were opened, her mother sent for physicians, bothof soul and body, with the Lady Selby, Colonel Fenwick’s widow, and withother friends. They forthwith came to behold this sad sight, with manyothers. Waking out of her sleep, the child was without present torment,but had lost the use of both limbs, tongue, and stomach. She only smiledon them, and signed that we could understand she had all her other sensesvery perfect. But she would let nothing come within her mouth of anynourishment, for her jaws were almost closed. Physicians gave their advice,with other friends. And what could be had was gotten for her.

Yet herMother, to her great expense, neglected no lawful means that could be used.About twelve o’clock, she had a tormenting fit before all the company. But"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366Demonic Possession and Exorcismit was not above an hour. But from that time till Whitsun Eve, being sixteenweeks, she slept as well in the nights as anyone. But as soon as she awokein the morning, her torment began. First, three or four hours every day,increasing till it came to eight hours, every hour a several torment, suchstrong, cruel ones that cannot be expressed. As many with weeping eyesbeheld it, Ministers would pray by her till the sad object would make themleave her to the Lord, expecting nothing but death. Sir William Selby, hisLady, the Countess Lendrik, the Lady Haggarston, with many others, wouldlook, till sorrow would make them cease. Yet as soon as these tormentswere over, the child would instantly smile, and make signs that she felt nopain at all. So lying quietly till the next morning, we only wet her lips with alittle milk and water. For she would let nothing come within her jaws. Butshe would smile and show her arms and breast, and say that God fed herwith angels’ food. For truly, all the sixteen weeks of fast did not appear todiminish her fatness or favour in any way at all.On Whitsun Eve in the morning, she had eight hours of bitter torment.In the afternoon, her Mother, being abroad, left her husband’s brother’sdaughter, Mistress Elizabeth Muschamp, with her. She30made signs to herto carry her into the garden in her Mother’s absence. Her cousin, castingamantle about her, gave her her desire, and sat in the garden with her onher knee. In bringing her down, she had so little strength in her neck, thather head hung down wagging. But she was not sat a quarter of an hour till,showing some signs to her cousin, she bolted off her knee, ran thrice aboutthe garden, expressing a shrill voice, but did not speak presently. She thatwas brought down in this sad condition, came upstairs on her own legs inher cousin’s hands. Captain Falset, his wife and his daughter, being then inthe house, beheld this miraculous mercy of the Lord done to this child.Her Mother, being at Berwick three miles off, was sent for and impartedher joyfulness to the Lady Selby and good Master Balsom, whose prayerswith the rest, as the child said, had prevailed with God for mercy. When herMother came home, her daughter whom she left in so bad a condition, camedown to the gate with her clothes on, calling, ‘Mother, Mother, welcome30Margaret Muschamp."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp367home.’ Now the Mother’s joy may be imagined, but not expressed. Shepresently desired her Mother to send many thanks to Master Balsom andMaster Strother that the Lord had answered their prayers for her. The nextday, being the Sabbath, she begged her Mother to return thanks to theglorious God, who never failed any that trusted in him, and she herselfwould ride into the Holy Island and join in thanks and prayers to the Lord,with Master Huet, Sir Thomas Tempest, Captain Shaft, and with the restof the parish that feared God. By God’s power, she did it herself the nextThursday, there being a lecture in Berwick. And with Master Balsom andMaster Strother, she gave glory to the Lord for his never forgotten mercyto her. Though her flesh did not diminish, yet her strength was but weak,and her stomach by degrees came to her again. And for seven or eight weeksshe was very well. Then her Mother moved to Berwick, where the Garrisonwas kept. The discharge of a musket would cause her to fall into very greatecstasies. Being there several times for a period of twenty four hours, shewould be suddenly taken with her former torments. For a period of threeweeks, she lost her stomach and all her limbs. And suddenly, she recoveredall again, not remembering what she had either done or suffered. To avoidthis inconvenience, her Mother moved from Berwick and carried her, inone of these sad conditions, one mile from Berwick, where she continuedseven weeks more in these afflictions.On St John’s day, on the Christmas following, betwixt the hours of oneand two at night, her eldest brother was taken so exceedingly ill, that it wasthought that he would not live. The next morning he was a little eased of hisextremity and pain. But both his stomach and the use of his legs were takenfrom him, so that he was forced to have help to put on his clothes, and waslifted into a chair where he sat all day long. But he could neither eat nordrink anything but a little milk or water, or sour milk. He consumed awayto nothing, yet not heart-sick. But he would reason, talk, and laugh with anyfriend as if nothing ailed him. His Mother, now being pressed down withsorrow, sent to the doctors both at Newcastle, Durham, and Edinburgh,not doubting or suspecting any unnatural disease. The physicians all agreedthat, by the course of nature, he could not live a month to an end, whichwas sad news to his sorrowful Mother, God knows."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"368Demonic Possession and ExorcismAfter two or three weeks, she had another fit of her former torments.After she had lain three or four weeks in her extremity, she began to cry,‘The Rogue’, never till then offering a word in her torments. But as if somewere striking at her, she seemed to save herself from blows with her handsand bedclothes, portraying a wretched creature as we all knew after by herdescription. Sometimes he would fight with her in the shape of a dragon,of a bear, a horse, or cow. Many fancies she did express. And good things,she said, fought for her and still got the better of him. The enemy’s weaponswere a club, a staff, a sword, and dagger. Her good things got them all, asshe thought, and afterwards the wretch, she thought, got the dagger again.Now when she fixed her eyes on her objects, no action you could usewould move either eyes or gesture till she came out of her fits. Then she didnot remember anything that she either did or said. After a while she wouldmake her hand go on her breast, as if she would write, with her eyes fixed onher object. They laid paper on her breast and put a pen with ink in her hand,and she, not moving her eyes, wrote, ‘Jo Hu. Do. Swo. has been the deathof one dear friend, consumes another, and torments me.’ Whilst she waswriting these words, she was blown up ready to burst, shrinking with herhead, as if she feared blows. Then she would be stretched, as in convulsionfits, till she could get that writing from them that had it, and either burn it inthe fire, or chew it in her mouth, till it could not be discerned. Let any onesnatch the paper from her, and hide it as privately as he could, she would havegone to the party and place, still in torment, till she got it. And she eitherburned it or chewed it, so that none could discern one word she had written.Then immediately, she would have ease. Thus for a month or six weeks, everyother day, with several torments, such like expressions continued. Her goodthings, as she called them came still and saved her from her enemies.These written words, and her other expressions, caused her sad Motherto have very contradictory thoughts. Thus, one day her niece Muschamp,31that had been her companion in most of these sad conditions, being troubledto think what this child’s writing should mean, said to her aunt, ‘There isone that I have ever feared since my cousin Margaret was first afflicted. But31Elizabeth Muschamp."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp369Idare not name her whom I have suspected.’ Her aunt answers, ‘and only oneIsuspect. And these letters32make me tremble to think on it. But the Lordpardon our thoughts if we think amiss.’ So we revealed our thoughts to oneanother, and both pitched on Dorothy Swinow. Her niece says, ‘MistressSwinow came to see the child when you were away and spoke harshly ofyou. And besides, the child’s looking on her, which she never did on anyelse, makes me fear her.’ Her aunt answered, ‘If she could do me hurt, andnot her own soul, I fear her more than anyone else. But that cannot be. SoLord pardon us, if we think amiss, and let us not speak any further of her.’This child’s Mother’s business called her to Newcastle, which was notapleasant journey, leaving so sad a house at home. And her child’s writing,and her niece’s thoughts and her own, made her very sad, so that her servant,wondering to see such a change, presumed to ask the cause of it. She,knowing her servant to be trusty, revealed the suspected party to him, noliving soul being by. Her business being dispatched, she returned home.But in her absence, her daughter had been quite distracted, running upand down with a staff in her hand, saying that she would kill the rogue.In this rage, she apprehended her good things, for so she called them, inthe likeness of a dove, and a partridge. And she began to sing, ‘Judge andrevenge my cause, O Lord.’ Next, ‘How long will you forget me, Lord.Will I never be remembered?’ And she concluded, ‘Behold and have regard,you servants of the Lord.’ And so she came out of her fit, not rememberinganything either done or said. She never knew any of these Psalms by heart,nor any book by her, nor any voice to sing them to this day.By her, at that time, was my niece Muschamp, Master Moore’s six sonsand his daughter, with my own children and servants, and divers neighbours.After my coming home, she fell into another of these strange fits. TheMinister of Tweedmouth, being by, saw and heard many strange passages,half of which cannot be remembered. But part of her discourse was that ifshe had two drops of his blood33or hers34within ten days, it would saveher life. If not, death would be long coming but torment perpetual.32That is, ‘Jo. Ho. Do. Swo.’33That is, John Hutton’s.34That is, Dorothy Swinow’s."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"370Demonic Possession and ExorcismShe had divers of these fits. In every one, she said that their blood wouldsave her life. from ten days to six, from six to three, which was on a Saturday,being heavily tormented, her tongue was taken from her. With her eyes fixedon her objects, she wrote thus again, ‘Jo. Hu. Do. Swi. has been the death ofone dear friend, consumes another dear friend, and torments me. For threedays, they have no power. But the fourth they will torment me. Two dropsof his or her blood would save my life. If I do not have it, I am undone, tobe tormented for seven years before death comes.’ Whilst she was writingthe tears came down her face, still saving herself in this bitter agony, as itwere, from her enemies’ blows.As soon as her Mother came from Newcastle, she sent that servant towhom she revealed her mind at Newcastle to one John Hutton. He was oneof whom it was suspected that he could do more than God allowed of.35Shebade him to confess who had wronged her child, or she would apprehendhim, her child in her extremity having written the first two letters of hisname, with another’s.So when this servant told him his message, another was present to witnesshis answer, which was thus. ‘William Hall, your Mistress knows as wellas I who has wronged her child. For the party that, with a troubled mind,your Mistress had concealed all this time, and told you of at Newcastle inher chamber all alone, is she that has done her all this wrong.’ The servantanswered, ‘God bless me, how could he tell what his Mistress said to him,no other living soul being present, bidding him reveal the party?’ the roguesaid, ‘A great stone is not easily lifted, and he had one foot in the gravealready,’ repeating many old sayings. But he said that Dorothy Swinow,wife then to Colonel Swinow, was the party that had done all the mischiefto her child, and was the cause of all her further crosses.This answer was brought. And for the three days since the child’s lastwriting, they had no power.

She desired him to tell herhow he came to know so far off what she spoke to her servants all alone.He repeated before all the company what he had formerly spoken.She said that her eldest son was very ill too, the Lord bless him, notthinking that he was wronged. But the rogue answered that one was thecause of both. Bewildered, she said, ‘I had a sister that died in a restlesssickness.

The wretch,still using godly words and his prayers, desired to take his blood privately,so that none should see. So the child nicked him half a dozen times inthe forehead. But no blood appeared.

She knew that my aunt’s estate was but for life.And her only son had married Fauset’s daughter who, to enjoy the estate, hehaving but one son, was the cause of young James Fauset’s unnatural fits. Butshe thought that Master Fauset would come after her more vigilantly therethan we could do here. So she left him alone, to be the more vehement withus, every fit promising me ease, if I would consent to lay it on my Mother.But I will never consent, but if it were possible endure more torment, sinceshe is all that the Lord of his goodness has left to take care of us five fatherlesschildren, except our Father in Heaven who protects her for our sakes.’Thus for two hours together she continued in a very heavenly, religiousdiscourse with these angels, rejoicing that she had got two drops of blood.She said that, if her brother had as much, it would save his life also. Witnessto these words were Master Moore of Spittle, his six sons and a daughter,Miss Elizabeth Muschamp, Mistress Margaret Selby, Anne Selby, andGeorge Lee, who was almost cast away coming into Barwick Harbourin a ship by that fearful tempest which Hutton raised. George Armorer,William Hall, William Beard, Henry Orde, with divers neighbours werealso witnesses. All admired the Lord’s great power expressed in that afflictedchild. Her Mother, desiring to have some small quantity of Hutton’s blood,rode to him the next day with two servants. They brought him to her son, henot being able to go to him. He acknowledged that his life was still in her"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp373hands. And he came, riding behind one of her servants home to the Spittlewhere she dwelt. And being brought before Master Moore, he confirmedall that he had formerly confessed, and withal said, ‘Mistress Swinow hadtwo bad women about her, the Miller’s and the Webster’s wives, who hadbeen the death of John Custerd and his wife,’ with many other things abouttheir wickedness. That night he desired to go to rest, and when he36pleasedto call him, he would confess further to him alone. The next day cameMaster William Orde, Master Broad, minister, with Master Heberin, andEdward Saufield, who heard all this confirmed. And so the Mother tookher son in her arms to the place where the wretch was, and got his blood.He stayed there seven or eight days. And yet Master Moore never hadpower to examine him any more, the wretch still desiring to be gone. TheMother, in the presence of Margaret Selby, Margaret Orde, and WilliamBeard, charged him, although he had long been the Devil’s servant, to beat last but a bridge for God’s creatures to go over, in confessing the truth.He answered, ‘Mistress, Mistress, if I were a young man able to endure allthe torments that would be laid on me, I would take my death that MistressDorothy Swinow was the death of the Lady Hambleton, the consumer ofyour son, the tormentor of your daughter, and the cause of all your othertroubles.’Now whilst he was there, the girl was never troubled. But he was notpast the town’s end when she fell into a terrible fit, saying that DorothySwinow with two more witches were come to torment her worse than everHutton did. And the one was a young woman, and the other an old. Shesaid that, till they had justice from Dorothy Swinow, her Mother and theyshould never be at peace. On this, her Mother rode to Justice Foster ofNutham, and gave information on oath against both Hutton and MistressSwinow to apprehend them. He, after delays, apprehended him and senthim to Newcastle Gaol. But he did not apprehend her, though it will appearshe was three several times in his company after he had the information onoath, whereof he gave her a copy, with the copy of Hutton’s examination.36Presumably, Master Moore."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"374Demonic Possession and ExorcismBut he would never let Mistress Muschamp see it. Seeing that delay, shespoke with a Durham Justice at Belford, which is not in the county. Andhe could not speedily grant her a warrant to apprehend the said MistressSwinow, but bade Master Foster do justice, which is not yet done.The girl had many tormenting fits, in the midst of which her angels alwaysappeared to her, and banished the witches which she apprehended. The girlwould cry out and relate to her angels how she had been tormented by thetwo witches, forcing her to get the information, whereof her Mother keptacopy. So that let her Mother give the paper to whom she would, or lay itanywhere. The child would go to either place or party most strangely. Assoon as her angels departed, her torments leaving her, she told them thather enemies would have killed her. But justly might she sing the thirty fifthPsalm, ‘Plead my cause, O Lord,’ &c., repeating the first part thereof sosensibly and distinctly that the Ministers there present admired to hear it.Likewise, she declared the death of the rogue Hutton in prison before itwas known there, saying that, if he had been urged, he would have divulgedthe other two witches. Foretelling many strange truths, appointing diversmeetings with her angels, such a day and such an hour, to consult withthem what would become of her brother and what punishment her enemieswould have, she bade everyone that they should not so much as look afterher. For if they did, it would anger her angels and undo her. For there weresome strange angels besides her own to meet her. This being the fourthmeeting with them, they would declare all. She said that she must haveall clean clothes about her; for this day or tomorrow she must meet themunder such a tree in the garden. After coming out of her fit, she rememberednothing of what was done or said.Her Mother, observing her words which hitherto had been so remarkable,clothed her child all in white, and freely commended her to the Lord,watching his glorious time. In the afternoon, being on a walk under a treewith her brothers and sisters, she suddenly gave a great shriek, and skippedover a double ditch and another, and ran to the garden door. Her eldest sistercame to her Mother saying, ‘Margaret is gone to her angels’ meeting.’ Shehastily ran with the key of the garden door, where the child was standing,"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The story of Margaret Muschamp375beating at it, saying, ‘I come, I come.’ She opened the door and left herto her protector, and hastily went to the other side of the house to securethat part of the garden. But alas, before she came, a wicked creature set onby the enemy’s instigation had been looking after her. And her child waswringing her hands and weeping bitterly, as if she could have torn her fleshfrom the bones, or hair from off her head, asking, ‘Who was here’ and whatwicked creature had kept her blessed angels from her? And for three hourstogether, she took on grievously. Her Mother wept with her, begging theLord not to punish the innocent for the wicked’s fault. After some time,the child went into the garden again where, finding one of her angels, shesaid, ‘Lord, it was not my fault. But it is well that you will come to me! But,alas, where are the rest?’ Her Mother being within, heard these words, ‘Aquarter of a year. A long time to be without comfort, still weeping.’ Thenshe had this answer from her angels, that for twelve weeks they would notvisibly appear to her. She remembered this for three days. And she relatedto her brothers and sisters and the rest of the household the shape of thoseangels. They were embodied like birds, as big as turkeys, and faces likeChristians, but the sweetest creatures that ever eyes beheld. One of thestrange ones came flying over the trees with a sweet voice, and gave hernotice that the rest were come. This she found most true. Two or threelighted on the ground, and the rest with the most heavenly voices that everwere heard, with a resolution to declare all the truth. And if the justices andjudges at the Assizes would not do justice, her own two angels, who werealways to her like a dove and a partridge, would visibly, to the admirationof all the beholders, appear like a man and a woman, and justify the truth,if the wicked wretch had not scared them away. But now, one of her angelsbade her to have a care that she was neither frightened nor angered for twelveweeks. In this time they would not come to her. But in the meantime, herenemy would make every third fit a terrible one.

If it were so, it would be moresad to me than all my pain. Though you be not in my sight, yet I trust inGod’s mercy so much that you will still watch over us and protect us.God grant that we never forget God’s mercies, to be impatient, seeingwe have rest in torment.What mercies can be shown to a creature, but it has pleased God to showto me? It has pleased him to grant me so much patience, though of myselfIwas not sensible of my torments. That was a mercy and much comfortto my soul that, though they tormented my body, they never had power tocause me speak unbefitting words to hazard my soul.But had it not pleased God to have sent you to me that time, what wouldhave become of me? I would have been distracted and like a mad body.When the Devil was strong and had most power, God still thwarted himof his opportunity.Seldom anything satisfies the minds of those that are so malicious, savethis extravagant way. That is a sore thing. Many times, malice is neversatisfied without life. Will I never see you with my eyes here? Yet you willreveal this, either by me or by some other means.It will be more strange before it is all declared. Now, after this time, Iwill never have more torment by any witch, nor none I hope. Will I meetyou in such a place, at such a time? I will.47Exodus22.18.48Herangels."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"388Demonic Possession and ExorcismSeeing you have set me that time of appointment, I hope you will put mein mind of it.
