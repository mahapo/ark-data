Since his earliestendeavours ( Le Feste di Venere , 1996,Astronomy and Calendar in AncientRome , 2001), not to mention his workson the Etruscan language ( La Paroladegli Etruschi , 1987 and L’Etrusco,lingua dall’Oriente Indoeuropeo ,2007), all of his research has amplydemonstrated the author’s interest inthe origins of Roman civilization, andjust how much Roman civilizationowes to the culture of its Etruscanneighbours."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Magini draws on an impressivenumber of Latin and Greek texts which,though indubitably hailing from laterperiods, nevertheless make up a well-consolidated body of opinion.

In other words, it was a worthysuccessor to the cycle of Saros, a factthat itself points to a Mesopotamianinfluence.

I touchonly briefly on areas where certaintyremains elusive: the rhythm of themotion of the superior planets,particularly Jupiter and Saturn, and theposition of zero degrees Aries. Lastly,work still needs to be done to clarifythe astronomical significance of the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"nundinal letters, the true significanceof the days of Agonalia (March 17,May 21, December 11 and January 9),and of the opening of the mundus(August 24, October 5 and November8).Fourth, we know without a shadowof doubt that there was an astrologicaltradition in Rome, among other things,because of the protection afforded towomen—the guarantors of thecontinuity of the species—by the twomost “feminine” of celestial bodiessince the proto-history of astrology: theMoon and Venus.

Public lifewas ruled by the Vestalia, theRegifugium and the interrex , and bythe October Equus, the Fordicidia andthe Parilia . 3 Private life was whollyruled by the celestial bodies.Conception, the seventh month ofpregnancy, preparation for birth, birthitself, namegiving, all of the rites ofpassage associated with puberty,marriage and conception anew, all ofwhich are notable life landmarks—particularly in the lives of women—"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"were cadenced by celestial movementsand the rhythm of their associatedfestivities: Matralia and Carmentalia,Matronalia and Liberalia , Tigillumsororium and Anna Perenna, Veneraliaand, once again , Matralia . 4 Indeed,the circularity of human life on Earthreflects the circularity of the motion ofthe celestial bodies in the heavens.Having established thesefoundations, our enquiry must shift totheir origins.

There is alsothe matter of explaining why no otherancient Italian population, despitesignificant similarities in manyrespects, was able during the sameperiod of time to achieve a similarlevel of astronomical and calendarknowledge. Indeed, how could it havebeen possible in historical times for theRomans to “misplace” the origins of acultural and intellectual heritageacquired through endless years ofresearch and complex mentalprocesses, ever since prehistoric times?An alternative hypothesis wouldlead us to a source from outside theRoman sphere.

Thisis where we should seek the “barbariansuperior to Pythagoras” who, accordingto Plutarch, put the finishing touches toeducating the Roman king. And yet thisadds a further layer of complexity, forPythagoras himself is complex enough:known as “Tyrrhenian” by birth andupbringing, Pythagoras studiedgeometry, mathematics and astronomyin Egypt and Mesopotamia, beforereputedly teaching so much to Numa—though not, it turns out, the calendar towhich the king would lend his name. 6The picture only becomes much"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"clearer if we accept that the Etruscanshailed from the Orient—from Lydia, asHerodotus claims. This would appearto be confirmed by “the sale ofSardians”, that is to say, the Etruscanswhom Romulus captured at Veio. 7First, the Mesopotamian/Anatolianarea had achieved a whole sequence ofscientific achievements and anelaborate worldview that was theculmination of at least two millennia ofdevelopment. Thereafter, over what canin no way be described as a brief periodof time, an educated and cultured élitebelonging to a population living on thefringes of this area acquired thesenotions of astronomy and astrology,along with a worldview that gave them"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"a rounded meaning. Finally, as eventsunfolded, this population—includingits élite—travelled to Italy, defeatedRome, and as conquerors imposed acalendar that, far from being“agricultural/pastoral” as has long beenclaimed, was based on a surprisinglysophisticated accretion of astronomicalknowledge. This knowledge wasinitially held by the élite; given itscomplexity, it was impossible to pass itdown through the ensuing centuries.Pursuit of this line of enquiry—which today would be validated byexamination of “the genetic data of thepopulations in potential areas oforigin”, to quote Cavalli-Sforza 8 —would also explain the sudden step"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"change in the Roman calendar, fromthe mysterious, cobbled-together 304-day Romulean Calendar (unless behindthis astronomically meaninglessnumber lies a 61-day interval betweensignificant astronomical phenomena,but then what phenomena would theybe?) 9 to the complex and sophisticatedcalendar adopted by the followinggeneration (i.e. Numa’s generation),which was light years ahead of thepreceding simple—and basic—lunarcalendar.I believe that the same path wasfollowed by other customs, beliefs andideas regarding the relationshipbetween men and divinities or, morespecifically, the life of man and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"celestial messages.

Indeed, in Ancient Babylon,where every single month was 30 dayslong, the number 49 was bad luck:“The week of weeks was determined bythe 49th day after every new Moon—ina 30-day month, that meant that it ranfrom the 19th day of the following"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"month.
