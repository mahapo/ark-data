Many changes and additions have been made for the English translation. Firstly, it includes new gold tablets found or published after the release of the Spanish edition and new readings or interpretations about all texts. Secondly, the authors have rewritten some chapters, taking new research into account. The preparation of a collective work on Orpheus and the Orphic tradition, edited by Alberto Bernabé and Francesc Casadesús, has had an important in\u0003 uence in this undertaking.The edition of the texts has been revised according Bernabé’s edition of the gold tablets for Poetae Epici Graeci, Testimonia et Fragmenta Pars II, Orphicorum et Orphicis similium testimonia et fragmenta fasc. 2, Monachii et Lipsiae, Saur 2005. Indexes have been added in order to facilitate the use of the book.We are grateful to our colleagues Gábor Betegh, David Jordan, Richard Janko, Dirk Obbink, Robert Parker and Christoph Riedweg for having allowed us to use their suggestions and/or unpublished papers. We are particularly grateful to Yannis Tzifopoulos for having sent us his excellent monograph about Cretan Gold Tablets before its publication and for allowing us to publish the text of the new gold tablet from Sfakaki.We would also like to thank Ephtychia Stavrianopoulou for providing us with many papers published in Greek reviews, which are dif\u0002 cult to \u0002 nd in Spain, and Giovanni Pugliese Carratelli for having sent us a copy of his \u0002 rst editon of the Orphic Gold Tablets, as magni\u0002 cent as it is impossible to obtain.Luc Brisson and Radcliffe Edmonds have discused with us many topics. Their valuable comments and skeptical attitude towards the Orphic interpretation of the Gold Tablets have forced us to re\u0002 ne our arguments. Michael Chase has made a careful translation of the original and Sarah Burges Watson and Susana Torres have offered us many interesting suggestions. To all of them, many thanks.We are also grateful to our fellows of the research group on Greek Religion of the Complutense University in Madrid ( Juan Antonio Álvarez-Pedrosa, Rosa García-Gasco, Miguel Herrero, Eugenio Luján, Sara Macías, Raquel Martín, Carlos Megino, Julia Mendoza, Francisco BERNABE_f1_i-xii.indd xi11/7/2007 9:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Molina, and Marco Antonio Santamaría) and particularly to Francesc Casadesús (Universitat de les Illes Balears), with whom we have debated at length many details and from whom we have learned a great deal.We appreciate specially Richard Buxton’s generous aid in days very sad for him.Last, but not least, we are very grateful to the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, for having given us \u0002 nancial support for edit-ing this book (Consolider C Project HUM2006–09403/FILO) and its translation (Grant for Translation and Publication in Foreign Languages of Scienti\u0002 c Works by Spanish Authors; Ministery of Culture of Spain, Directorate General for Books, Archives, and Libraries).Madrid June MMVIIxii preface to the english editionBERNABE_f1_i-xii.indd xii11/7/2007 9:51:41 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION0.1. The gold tabletsThe Orphic gold tablets, despite the brevity of the texts they contain and the dif\u0002 culties which their analysis presents, are fundamental docu-ments for our understanding of Greek religion, since they give us direct access to the most ancient stages of Orphic religion and literature, and present a very signi\u0002 cant panorama of the rituals and beliefs of this religious group, which exerted a powerful in\u0003 uence on other Greek authors and thinkers: some Pre-Socratic philosophers, lyric poets like Pindar, Plato, and then the Neoplatonists. The considerable list of titles presented in our bibliography, which collects the studies that have been dedicated to them by a growing number of the best specialists in philology, philosophy, or the religions and history of Greece is, we believe, a good indication of their importance.The study of these texts is in a state of genuine \u0003 ux, since new documents continue to appear, which oblige us to continually alter our assumptions about particular cases. There are even some tablets that have not yet even been published. However, this prolonged effort on the part of many eminent philologists has enabled us to make con-siderable advances in analysis, and to reach some reasonably certain conclusions. This is why it has seemed to us opportune to offer here a complete edition of the texts so far known, together with a translation and commentaries in which the principal \u0002 ndings of this investigation are synthesized.The text presented is very similar to that published by Alberto Ber-nabé in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana.We also present a series of iconographical notes, which include reproductions (with drawings by Sara Olmos) of a few artistic repre-sentations that are related to the universe of the tablets, selected and commented upon by Ricardo Olmos.BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 110/31/2007 3:09:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 introduction0.2. External aspects of the tabletsLet us begin with the least debatable aspects of these documents, the external ones: their formal characteristics, the places in which they came to light, and the form of the language in which they are written.1The objects in question are a series of gold tablets of very small dimension (they vary between 8 and 4 cm. wide and 3 to 1 cm long). The use of gold no doubt corresponds to the search for a material intended to be noble and long-lasting, useful for avoiding malign in\u0003 uences and a symbol of the durability of the life that the deceased hoped for. By contrast lead, which was used in de\u0002 xiones, symbolized the destruction and death that these were intended to bring about.The writing that appears on them is minuscule in size and very careless in its ductus. The people who wrote, or rather scribbled these tablets were obviously not highly literate. Often, the letters appear to be traced so summarily that a \u0002 or a \u0003 is reduced to a vertical line. Spelling mistakes are innumerable. In addition, the gold surface, thin and shiny, has tended to curl up and form wrinkles, which are some-times hard to distinguish from letters. All this makes their reading and interpretation extraordinarily dif\u0002 cult.They are found in graves, but the limited number of graves that have yielded documents of this type, compared to the thousands that have been excavated, indicates that the users of the tablets were a minority group, with a certain unity of beliefs, probably initiates, or followers of a religious movement which, after several years of doubt, we must now, without hesitation, call “Orphic”,2 and convinced that a special destiny was reserved for them in the beyond.They have come to light only in a few places, and differ widely in date, with almost six hundred years between the oldest, the one from Hipponion, c. 400 B.C., and the most recent, which appeared at Rome and is datable to 260 A.D. The majority of them, however, date from between the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C.3A group came to light in Magna Graecia. The oldest one, although it was among the latest to appear, is the Hipponion tablet, found in Vibo 1 On archaeological questions, which we shall not go into in detail, cf. Zuntz (1971) 287 ff., Guzzo (1991) 123 ff., and above all Bottini (1992).2 Despite the reticence of some researchers, who today are in the minority, cf., for instance, Edmonds (1999), (2004). See the discussion in § 10.3 For a very complete survey, cf. Cole (2003) 200 ff. pl. 8.1.BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 210/31/2007 3:09:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" introduction 3Valentia, Calabria, ancient Hipponion, city of Persephone, a colony of the Epizephrian Locrians. As we said, it is dated with complete certainty, for epigraphical and archeological reasons, to around 400 B.C. Later by half a century than the \u0002 rst is a tablet that appeared in Petelia, also in Calabria, to the north of Crotona. It was the \u0002 rst of the entire collection to be found. Very similar in its text is another copy, appar-ently found in Sicily, and in rather poor condition. Since this piece is in the possession of an unknown private collector, we know nothing of its archaeological context (although it seems it must have appeared in Petraro, near Entella). The \u0002 rst editor dated it to the 3rd century B.C., but in our opinion we must raise its date to the 4th century B.C. In the so-called timpone or tombs at Thurii, \u0002 ve tablets were found, including three that are very similar to one another, another somewhat different, and a \u0002 fth very large one, showing signi\u0002 cant differences from all the others. All of them date from the mid-4th century B.C.Also in Magna Graecia, in San Vito di Luzzi in Cosenza, some curi-ous inscribed earrings or pendants were found, which we must place chronologically between the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Despite not being gold tablets, it seems they had similar eschatological functions.The second region to offer \u0002 nds of this kind has been Thessaly. We have a tablet from Pharsalus, from the 4th century B.C., and two found in Pelinna, now Paleoyardiki, one of the most recently published \u0002 nds. In all probability, another one, now in the Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, California, also comes from Thessaly. Yet another two have been found in Pherai.In addition, eight tablets have come to light in Crete, all in the same places, at Eleutherna in Milopotamus and in Rethymno, but at varying intervals of time. They are highly uniform in content, and are datable to the 3rd century B.C.; there are also two brief greetings to the underworld gods.In Macedonian Pella and Amphipolis, specimens with very brief texts have been found, dating from the 4th century B.C., to which we must add some very brief texts from Paeonia, also in Macedonia, from Methone and Aegion in Achaia, which go back to Hellenistic times, two tablets, one of them almost illegible, found at Hagios Athanassios near Thessalonica (of indeterminate period).The most recent tablet is one found at Rome, dating from around 260 of our era, which is extremely interesting as a proof of the persis-tence of this type of documents, more than seven hundred years after the \u0002 rst one we possess.BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 310/31/2007 3:09:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 introductionFinally, we know nothing, other than the news of its discovery,4 about another tablet, found in Lesbos and preserved in the Museum of Mitilini.It is odd that none have appeared in Attica. The reason may be that this region was dominated by Eleusis, and the Eleusinian mysteries did not make use of this kind of text,5 or else that the Orphics were buried elsewhere than average citizens,6 and their cemetery has not been either found or excavated.In some cases, the tablets appear in open form, in others folded. In the former case, they were placed in the hand of the deceased; in the latter, they could be placed on the deceased’s chest or in his mouth, like the obol for Charon. Some of the Cretan ones may have been used as epistomia, or coverings for the lips of the deceased.7 The two tablets from Pelinna, which have the exceptional form of an ivy leaf (or a heart)8 and contain nearly identical texts, were deposited on the dead woman’s chest, one on each side. The one from Petelia appeared rolled up and stored in a cylinder held fast with a tiny gold chain; but this was not its original position, since the cylinder is much later, probably from the 2nd century A.D., which indicates that the tablet must have been re-used as an amulet in the Roman period (cf. App. II, n. 15). The tablet from Pharsalus was placed inside a sumptuous hydria (cf. App. II, n. 8).90.3. The texts: a brief approximation of their contentsThe leaves contain brief texts in verse, mainly dactylic hexameters, although there are considerable metrical problems, which we cannot 4 News of the \u0002 nd appeared in the AD 43 B 2 1998 [1993], 459. Our attempts to obtain a photograph or transcription of this document, more than ten years after its discovery, have been completely unfruitful.5 This is the view of Burkert (1999) 64.6 As is made evident by a stele found in Cumae in which it is prohibited to bury anyone who has not achieved the Bacchic experience, which has been interpreted, with very solid arguments, by Turcan (1986) as Orphic.7 Gavrilaki-Tzifopoulos (1998).8 Cf. Paus. 2, 37, 2–3 on a “heart of copper-ore”, referred to the mysteries of Lerna. We thank David Jordan for calling our attention to this passage.9 See the bibliography cited at App. II n. 8. BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 410/31/2007 3:09:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" introduction 5go into here. Suf\u0002 ce it to say that there are occasional heptameters and pentameters, with various instances of metrical license.10It is, however, curious to observe that on more than one occasion prose sequences are introduced (or perhaps other rhythmic structures, not of course hexametric), which seem to correspond to mystical for-mulas, passwords, or other phrases of a ritual character. In general, these phrases are dif\u0002 cult to interpret, and in many cases they have given rise to long scholarly discussions. A fundamental cause of this variety of interpretation is, in our opinion, that the expressions in question are suggestive and ambivalent; when they give rise to diverse interpretations we must ask ourselves not whether they mean A or B, but whether they might not mean both A and B.With regard to the dialect in which they are written, it is a kind of mixture. For the most part, they are in the epic dialect, but with abundant Dorianisms. There are even occasional linguistic “monsters” produced by mixtures between different dialects.11As far as the content of these documents is concerned, if we leave aside a few divergent specimens (the shortest ones—containing a proper name and/or the word mystes, or not even that—, and the long one from Thurii, which has very peculiar characteristics), they display con-siderable unity. In general, they contain references to the other world: either indications about its “geography”, greetings to the infernal gods, wishes that the soul of the deceased may \u0002 nd happiness in the Beyond, or else suggestions for help in \u0002 nding it. They often include elements of dialogue, and the people who used them quite clearly hoped to obtain a special position in the other world, not so much thanks to the tablets themselves (although a gold object always possessed a certain value as a talisman or as a marker of identity), but because through them they are reminded what to do or say.The substantive question most debated with regard to the tablets is the religious movement that sustained them, the ensemble of beliefs shared by those who bore them, and above all the question of whether or not we can consider it certain that this religious movement was identical with that which we know as Orphism.10 For instance, there is a heptameter en L 1, 2; a pentameter, in L 10ab, 7 (in which, moreover, we must measure \u0004\u0005\u0002\u0006\u0007 with a short -\u0006). On the metrics of the tablets, cf. Gallavotti (1978–1979), Tessier (1987), Giangrande (1993) 235 ff.11 On the linguistic aspects, cf. Iacobacci (1993) 249 ff., and above all Cassio (1994) and (1996).BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 510/31/2007 3:09:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 introductionSince we will return to this question in chapter 10, suf\u0002 ce it to say here that they were \u0002 rst described unequivocally as Orphic, until Wilamowitz adopted a position of extreme scepticism with regard to the existence of Orphism as a religious movement, in which he was followed by other authors. However, the subsequent appearance of various documents, such as other tablets, the bone tablets from Olbia, or the Derveni Papyrus, cast doubt on this hypercritical attitude. In the last few years, a number of highly regarded scholars have advanced more nuanced opinions on the subject.Other problems have also arisen, such as the precise interpretation of the mystical formulas and the way in which such interpretation can illuminate the beliefs to which they make reference, what speci\u0002 c destiny the believers in this religion expected after death; whether or not the tablets go back to one and the same religious scheme and even, on the formal level, to the same original text of which they might be excerpta, or to a kind of archetype.Furthermore, as we shall see, iconographical evidence can shed important light on certain aspects of what is narrated in these texts.0.4. Sketch of a typology of the tablets. Our groupingIt is worth adding a few words on the arrangement we have adopted for the texts, and on the organization of the commentary. The tablets may be structured thematically in various groups, based on the fact that some of them present texts that are very similar and even identi-cal to each other.We will structure these groups following what we might call the soul’s transition toward the other world, since most of the tablets refer to various stages of its journey.In the \u0002 rst group (which consists of the tablets from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia, and Pharsalus), the subject is the soul’s arrival in the subterranean world, and what it must do to confront the trials which face it there, including the question of the guardians that watch over the fountain of Memory. An ample set of tablets from Crete is grouped together thematically with these, although they feature a greatly reduced text, limited to the guardians’ question and the answer that must be given. The tablet conserved in the J. Paul Getty Museum, probably of Thessalian origin, has a very similar content (all of these are included BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 610/31/2007 3:09:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" introduction 7in the \u0002 rst chapter). In the second chapter, we analyse the two nearly identical tablets from Pelinna, which present us with what we might call a “ritual of the dead”: here, someone addresses the deceased, con-gratulating him because his death is a new birth. It is announced to him that he has the privilege of wine, and that he will share the happy destiny of the other initiates. In Chapter III, we will study a tablet from Thurii in which the soul is guided in its path to the other world by a series of good wishes. There is no question of giving instructions to the deceased, but an external perspective is adopted, as if the soul’s passage to Hades were seen from this world, and it were taken for granted that the deceased has achieved his objective. In chapter IV, we collect the tablets in which the soul presents itself before the goddess Persephone and, in its request to be received by her, refers to a large number of questions related to Orphic ritual and to the beliefs of the adepts of this religion. In chapter V, the tablet from Rome is examined, which we may consider as a variant of the preceding group, although, because it is much later, it presents some atypical features. Even more atypical is the “great” tablet from Thurii, studied in chapter VI, which we have called somewhat humorously (although without falsifying its nature overmuch) a “word search” for deceiving non-initiates. It seems to contain a series of signi\u0002 cant terms from the Orphic message, surrounded by meaning-less letters. In chapter VII we encounter two brief texts, discovered in Pherai, one of them containing passwords for acceding to the meadow of the blessed, and the other including a prayer, probably addressed to Persephone by a mystes, who declares that he has been initiated in several mysteries. In chapter VIII, we examine other, shorter tablets: two Cretan ones, with greetings to Pluto and Persephone, and others, found in various locations, which contain the name of a mystes and/or the word μ\b\t\u000b\u0007, or some other indication of belonging to the god. We dedicate chapter IX to synthesizing what is said in the tablets on the souls’ ultimate destiny, chapter X to the question of whether or not they are Orphic, chapter XI to non-Greek texts, earlier or later than the tablets, which feature typological coincidences with them, and chapter XII to problems of a literary nature that affect our documents. Two appendices are devoted to the edition of the texts and to signi\u0002 cant iconographic references.BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 710/31/2007 3:09:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 introduction0.5. EditionsEditions of the ensemble of the tablets have continued to be carried out, but have grown obsolete with the appearance of new specimens. The \u0002 rst edition was by Diels in 1908, followed by another by Murray in the same year (both of them also offered later editions), followed by two very notable works, both Italian and with ample commentary, one by Comparetti in 1910 and another by Olivieri in 1915. After the edi-tions of Wieten in 1915, and of Kern in 1922, many years passed until, in 1971, Zuntz carried out the \u0002 rst modern edition of these texts, with very ample commentary, deeply marked by the scepticism that charac-terized references to Orphism at the time. Very shortly afterwards, the Hipponion tablet appeared, which gave rise to new editions: that by Pugliese Carratelli in 1974, that by Colli in 1977 (19813), and that by Gallavotti in 1978–1979. More complete, because it already included the tablets from Pelinna, and was accompanied by very interesting notes, is the edition by Pugliese Carratelli in 1993, after which came that by Riedweg in 1998, which also presented the tablets from Entella and Pherai. In 2001 Pugliese Carratelli made a new edition (2001a, there was a French translation in 2003), and the Spanish edition of the present work was also published. Bernabé’s edition appeared in 2005, in the context of the complete text of the Orphic fragments. In 2006 a new edition was published by Tortorelli Ghidini and in 2007 another one by Graf-Johnston appeared.BERNABE_f2_1-8.indd 810/31/2007 3:09:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEARRIVAL IN THE SUBTERRANEAN WORLD(The Tablets from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia and Pharsalus and the Reduced Versions, L 1–6)Translation of Tablets L 1–6Let us begin with the tablets from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia and Pharsalus, which constitute a very coherent group with a fairly similar text.

Yet the text of the tablet does not point in the direction of this type of interpretation, since it is focused on giving the deceased precise instructions for his journey through the world of the dead, where he must and must not go, who will come to meet him, and what he must say to them. Everything in it indicates that what is important is not the tablet itself, as a speci\u0002 c object, but that which the tablet helps to remember.Luppe suggested, with hesitation, \u0013\t\u0014\u0005,16 with the meaning “woolen thread”.

Hdt. 2, 81 (OF 650, where the abundant bibliography on this passage is cited).18 The translation would then be “this is consecrated to Mnemosyne”. This sugges-tion is by Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 23 f., and has been defended by Tortorelli Ghidini (1995b) 473 f. However, the translation “this is devoted to Mnemosyne” cannot be easily reconciled either with the metrics or with the vestiges of the word in the tablet of Petelia (L 3). Di Benedetto (2004) 304 f. reads !\u000b\u0005.19 \u001b\u001c\t\u000b\u0005 ‘that which comes later’, by Ricciardelli Apicella (1987) 501 f. presents dif-\u0002 culties.

We understand, then, that “this” (the text itself, the following dictum) is possible thanks to the capacities of Mnemosyne.1.2. MnemosyneThis leads us to ask why the text of the tablets is the work of Mne-mosyne, who is none other than a personi\u0002 cation of Memory. In the \u0002 rst place, it is clear that the text of the tablet (“this”) is the work of the goddess because it is something that must be remembered. This is one of the reasons why it is in verse; to facilitate its memorization. The goddess takes care that the initiate recalls what he must do, and the instructions that have been revealed to him while alive (probably in the course of initiation), thus becoming the protectress of souls and the guide of his journey.Mnemosyne presides over the poetic function, insofar as her daugh-ters, the Muses, as responsible for poets’ “recalling” the contents of their poetry.21 The \u0019\u0014%\u0016\u0002 that Mnemosyne dispenses to her chosen ones is an “omniscience” of a divinatory kind.22 However, just as the fact that the poet sings through the inspiration by the Muses does not exclude him from a dif\u0002 cult preparation and learning of the art of a seer, so a similar preparation is demanded of the initiate who invokes the divinity at the entrance to Hades.Yet there is something more. The coincidences between Mnemosyne and Orphism are clear. In the domain of myth, Mnemosyne is related to Orpheus—concretely, she is his grandmother—since her daughter, the Muse Calliope, was Orpheus’ mother. Like the mythic bard, she is a native of Pieria, and like him she is related to poetry and music, since she is the mother of the Muses.It would not be outlandish to think23 that for Mnemosyne, the daughter of Earth and Heaven, it is almost a sacred duty to help her 21 Gallavotti (1978–1979) 339 f. denies the identi\u0002 cation of the Mnemosyne of the tablets with the divinity who is mother of the Muses. In his opinion, it is rather the noun “memory”, that is, the soul’s ability to remember a notion acquired dur-ing initiation. We cannot share his view, since it is clear that not only is the memory of initiation the means of salvation, but that the deceased trusts in Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, to help him not to forget his experiences as an initiate during his infernal pilgrimage.22 Vernant (1965 [= 1955]) 81 f.23 Cf.

Yet in addition to this mythic relation, which we might consider super\u0002 cial, there is a deeper one, of a religious character, which affects a system of beliefs. In an Orphic hymn, dedicated precisely to this goddess, the function we are supposing for Mnemosyne in the tablets is made explicit (Orph. Hymn. 77, 9–10):24Awaken in the initiates the memory of the pious ritualand send forgetfulness far from them.What is hoped for from Mnemosyne is that she may make the initiates remember the ritual, probably that of initiation. At an elementary level, one has recourse to Mnemosyne in order to prevent an unexpected lapse of memory in a moment that is crucial for the initiate: that is, when he presents himself before the guardians and confronts their obliga-tory interrogation. It is possible, however, that the predominance of Mnemosyne in the tablets is related to the role that some philosophers attribute to memory as an instrument of salvation. The Pythagoreans laid great importance on exercising it, and created systems intended to improve it.25 Pythagoras is said to have claimed to remember the persons in whom his soul had become incarnate in existences previous to his own, among them that of Euphorbus.26 It is probably to Pythagoras’ wisdom that Empedocles alludes (fr. 99 Wright = B 129 D.-K.) when he refers to a man’s ability toEmbrace with his gaze what there is in ten or even twenty generations of men.27For Empedocles as for the Pythagoreans, remembering one’s previous lives is a fundamental exercise for knowing who one is and getting to know one’s soul. Anamnesis constitutes a puri\u0002 cation of the soul.2824 See Ricciardelli (2000a) ad loc., Morand (2001) 223.25 As we are informed by Iambl. Vit. Pyth. 164 (58 D 1 D.-K.). See also Arist.

B 1 D.-K.) may be Mnemosyne. Even Plato speaks of how he prefers a soul with a good memory.30 For him (Republic 621ab), to drink from Lethe means to lose the memory of eternal truths.A further meaning may also be found for the reference to Mne-mosyne. Given that the concept of truth in Greek (\b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002) means etymologically the “absence of forgetting”,31 to remember therefore also means “to know”.32 Memory breaks down the barrier between present and past, thus extending a bridge between the world of the living and the Beyond, to which all who have abandoned the light of the sun return.33 Whereas Forgetfulness is the water of death, because no one can approach the realm of shadows without having lost memory and consciousness, Memory, by contrast, is the fount of immortality, since he who conserves the memory of things in Hades transcends the mortal condition.34To remember in the other world also means to overcome the divi-sions of time that mark this brief mortal life. In its mnemonic faculty, the intellect recognizes its ability to overcome what is limited, sensible and mortal, in such a way that the soul becomes aware of its identity by means of memory, that is, by means of the knowledge of its own experience, its responsibility for its actions, and their consequences after death. With the memory of the entire series of his previous lives and the faults that he may have committed therein, man can pay the price of his injustices in full, and bring the cycle of his individual destiny to a close. The exercise of memory is thus transformed into a means of salvation and liberation with regard to the world of becoming and death.29 Pugliese Carratelli (1988b) 336 ff.

The image of Hades as a desolate region and world of forgetfulness is now applied to terrestrial life, conceived as a place of trials and pun-ishments.35 Contempt for temporal existence can be deduced from the central role that Mnemosyne occupies in eschatological myths, since she represents the power to leave time behind and return to the divine. To drink from the water of Mnemosyne is not only a remedy against eventual loss of memory on the initiate’s part, but it also facilitates his achievement of the immortality proper to numina, in contrast to the traditional image of death as the annihilation of consciousness.36Once personi\u0002 ed, moreover, Mnemosyne is not simply the other face of Forgetfulness, but an active reality with a sacral dimension. Not everyone can reach her water, since even for initiates the ultimate decision is in the hands of the sovereign of the nether regions, Perse-phone. Mnemosyne is a religious power that guarantees the initiate’s soul, after its death, the remembrance of its original condition, which means the possibility of not living once again, thereby removing itself from the dimension of time and becoming.37We may possibly have a late iconographic testimony to these beliefs. It has been suggested that Mnemosyne is the divinity who appears next to a fountain in a wall painting from a Roman hypogeum found beneath the Viale Manzoni and dating from 250 A.D. (cf. App. II, 35 On the death that is life, cf. § 2.2. Turcan (1956) 140 f. points out the use of a term like '\r\u0004\u000b\u0012, which is normally applied to Hades (Hes.

Crossing over to the other worldIn this group of tablets (excluding the one from Pharsalus), we \u0002 nd a series of references to the moment when the deceased will cross over to the Beyond. In the tablet from Hipponion, the phrase “when he is on the point of dying”39 serves as a mise en scène before introducing indications concerning infernal geography. Death is conceived as a passing, so that in the tablet from Hipponion the verb “to die” is con-strued as a verb of motion, “to die towards Hades”.40 The subject to be supplied is probably “the initiate”41 or, rather, “a hero”, according L 2, 2, L 3, 13.In the tablet from Petelia, the sentence “when he is on the point of dying”42 also seems readable at the end of the text, and we \u0002 nd similar expressions at the beginning of the tablets from Entella (L 2), where the words are in a very damaged part of the text, and Hipponion (L 1). If Janko’s reconstruction is correct, there were further indications both in the Petelia and the Entella tablets:[ let him] recall and get this grav[ed on gold43lest] the murk cover [ him] and lead [ him] down in dread.38 In the wall there is a Latin inscription in which the word refrig<eri>um can be read. Cf. Chicoteau (1997) 81 f. and the bibliography cited in App. II, n. 13.

We \u0002 nd it in the tablet from Petelia (L 3, 11):you will reign with the other heroes.44In a fragment from Pindar (fr. 133, 5 Maehl.),45 often interpreted as an expression of Orphic ideas, we also hear of souls which, after the \u0002 nal reincarnation,Until the end of times are called “immaculate heroes” by men.46Moreover, the expression “he who remembers” (μ\u0004μ\u0005\u000eμ\u0011\u0005\u0014\u0012) must refer to the necessary precondition for becoming one of these “heroes”, or these beings with a special destiny in the other world, namely, that of remembering one’s initiation in order to know what to say and do. The expression seems to be equivalent to the one we encounter in tablet L 8, 2: “keeping everything very well present”.47Everything seems to indicate that the condition of being a 1\u0007\u0012 is acquired precisely by having the ability to remember one’s initiation, and probably previous lives and transitions as well, which enables the soul not to make the mistake of drinking from the fountain to which all the other souls \u0003 ock. The gold tablet helps the hero to remember.44 “Hero” also appears, apparently with the same meaning, in the great tablet from Thurii (L 12), cf. Bernabé (2002c).45 Cf. Cannatà Fera (1990) 94 f. and n. 65 (see also the commentary, 218–231). Interpretations of this interesting passage also may be found in Rose (1936) 79–96, Linforth (1941) 345–355, Bluck (1961) 275–286, Bernabé (1999b).46 Cf. also a magical papyrus (P. Mag. IV 1226, [I 120 Preisendanz-Henrichs]), in which we hear of the “beings of the lower world and pure heroes”, or a passage from Diogenes Laertius (8, 32 = Pythagorici 58 B 1 D.-K.) “they believe that the entire air is \u0002 lled with souls, and that they are considered demons and heroes, and that it is through them that dreams and the symptoms of illnesses come to men . . .”, etc. From a much more ancient period, we \u0002 nd a fragment of Asius (14, 4 West; 1, 4 Adrados), in which a personage is spoken of “as a hero (“a phantom”, in Adrados’ translation), come forth from the mud”, which seems to be a way of saying “a man who appears to have come from the other world”. On mud in the beyond, cf. Plat. Phd. 69c: “he who arrives in Hades without having been initiated and without having celebrated the rites, will lie in the mud”, Aristoph. Ran. 145 (in a description of Hades), “and then a lot of mud”; cf. 273 “shit and mud”, Plut. fr. 178 Sandbach “in the midst of a great deal of mud and the thick atmosphere”; cf. also Plot. 1, 6, 6, Ael.

In another similar expression,51 the covering of the eyes is explicitly related to death:And death covered him.52In the gold tablets the Homeric words have a new meaning. The murk covers the eyes of the non-initiated, like the Homeric men. The text must be written, then, just “when he (the hero) is on the point of dying” (Hipponion L 1, 1, this reading is also supplied at verse 12 from Petelia L 3), so he will avoid the terrors of Hades and the confusion.We see that the instructions in this group of tablets refer to the moment when the soul enters Hades, or to the passage of death, when it is most necessary for the soul of the deceased to bear in mind where it must go and what it must say. This is a crucial moment, in which it is faced by options, some of them undesirable and others desirable, although the text limits itself to indicating which are desirable and which are not, and does not, in general, clarify the reasons for the choice, just as it indicates what must be said, but not why. Knowledge of the reasons for these instructions is clearly presupposed in the initiates. It is natural that our ignorance of such presuppositions contributes to the dif\u0002 culty of interpreting these texts.The Orphic version of the location and the overall vision of Hades are not fundamentally very different from what we \u0002 nd in other authors. It is a subterranean place (souls “go down” to it L 1, 4 and probably in L 2, 6, and its queen is “the subterranean queen” L 1, 13; L 2, 16). It is consequently dark and shadowy (L 1, 9; L 2, 11).53 In a tablet from 48 Guarducci (1985) 391 f.49 Il. 4, 461, 503, 526; 6, 11; 13, 575; 14, 519; 15, 578; 16, 316; 20, 393, 471; 23, 181; cf. h.

Yet except for these circumstances, it seems similar to the world of the living: there are fountains, trees, and meadows in it. In the tablets from Petelia and Pharsalus we even read of the “mansion of Hades” (L 3, 1; L 4, 1), which in the tablet from Hipponion is presented as a well-built dwelling (L 1, 2).54 We are reminded of the \u0002 gurative representations in which the deceased is situated in the other world in a kind of aediculum with columns.55The deceased is informed of the location of two fountains, one of which is unnamed and whose position is indicated by a white cypress, where the souls of the dead refresh themselves, but which he must avoid, and another one further on, called that “of Mnemosyne”, from which he must drink. There are a few differences at this point between some of the texts. In the ones from Hipponion (L 1, 2), Entella (L 2, 4) and Pharsalus (L 4, 1) we hear of a fountain on the right which must be avoided,56 but the one from which he must drink is not found on the left, but “further on”. In L 3, 1 the fountain that must be avoided is situated “to the left of the mansion of Hades”. It is not explicitly stated that the good fountain is on the right, but this is implicit in the expres-sion “you will \u0002 nd, on the other side . . .” (L 3, 4). There are, then, two models: one in which we \u0002 nd a path on the right with two fountains, for phonetic and semantic reasons, and conjectured \u00146\u0014\r{\u0004} (sic) \u001b\u0005\f\u000b\u0012, ‘inside the boundary’.

Ebert (cited by Luppe [1978] 25) preferred 5%\u0005\u0010\u0004\u0005\f\u0014\u0012 ‘obscure, somber’, a term which, although it is attested in very late authors like Quint. Smyr. 3, 657 or Man. 4, 53 f., seems to correspond well with what is read in the tablet from Entella (\u0019'\u000b\f\u0014]\u0012 5%{\u0014}\u0005\u0010\u0004\u0005\f\u0014<\u0012> according to Riedweg [1998] 396, Frel [1994] 183 f. reads μ\u0014\r %\u0014\u0005\u000e\u0004\u0005\f\u0006 [sic], which is meaningless). This is why we accept 5%\u0005\u0010\u0004\u0005\f\u0014\u0012 in our edition, as was also done by Pugliese Carratelli (2001a) and (2003).

Lloyd-Jones (1975) 226 points out the possibility that the text may be corrupted from \u00048\u0010\u0019\u0004\t\u0012, and Zuntz (1976) 137 thinks of a confusion between \u0015\u0004\u000b\u0004\t\u0012 ‘nebulous’ and \u000479\u0004\t\u0012 ‘mossy’, applied to the infernal world at Il. 20, 65, etc. For his part, Gil (1978) 85 suggests hesitantly that one should read \u0004:\u000e\t\u0012 \u001a;, a form of the verb “to \u0002 nd”, whereas Galavotti (1978–1979) 341 f. defends the transmitted text, translating it by bene ordinato. More radical are the positions of Marcovich (1976) 222 f., who establishes a lacuna after \u00047\u0010\u0004\u0002\u0012 and reconstructs two half-verses: <<\u0012 \b%\t'\u0006\u0005\u0004\t\u0012,/\u00048\u0010\u0019\u0004\t\u0012 μ\u0004&\u0006\u0005\r\u001a\u0014\u0005 \u001b'\u0004\u0018\u0017;> {\u001b\u0019\f;}, and of Lloyd-Jones (1990) 96 n. 43, who also believes two verses have been confused into one.

Finally, in one of the tablets from Thurii (L 8, 2, 5) there are two references to the right-hand side: in the \u0002 rst place, when the soul leaves the light of the sun behind, it must head in this direction. Then, the initiate is congratulated for having chosen the correct path: the one on the right.59Various attempts have been made to explain this divergence, which, in any case, is minor. It has been supposed, either that the writers of both texts had a different reference point for the indication of the correct side, and the writer from Petelia will have written “on the left” in reference to the side of the palace of Hades corresponding to the right-hand side of a person observing it from directly in front,60 or else that the infernal references might be tinged with euphemism and antiphrasis, so that the texts from Hipponion and Pharsalus avoided saying “left” because of a linguistic taboo, and said “on the right” instead.61 In any case, the initiate must always head towards the right.62 In the remaining testimonies (Eleutherna, Thessaly and Thurii) there is no confusion, and what is “on the right” is what is good: the fountain from which one must drink, the correct path or the cypress that indicates the desirable fountain. We also encounter an echo of the same motif in Pythagorean beliefs, according to the testimony of Aristotle (fr. 200 Rose):The Pythagoreans called right, above, and in front “good”, and they called left, below and behind “bad”.57 Zuntz (1971) 368. 58 In L 6a, which is atypical in almost every respect, one reads “to the left of the cypress”, for reasons we cannot explain.

We \u0002 nd the same idea in Hegesippus fr. 5 G.-P.

The cypress of the underworldIn all the tablets of this group (including the brief ones from Crete), it is emphasized that the location of the fountain is indicated by a cypress.The presence of the cypress is not surprising. In the \u0002 rst place, it had been since ancient times a funerary tree, connected with Hades.66 We \u0002 nd it adorning cemeteries in the most diverse cultures and in all periods, perhaps because of its evergreen leaves, its highly resistant wood, and the fact that once cut down, it does not bloom again, as one might expect of the dead. It is, moreover, a symbol of mourning, and an emblem or attribute of the underworld divinities in Oriental cults, Greece, Etruria, and later Rome.67What is new in the tablets is not so much the cypress, as the adjective by which it is quali\u0002 ed, &\u0004\r'\u0010, which means ‘shining’ or ‘white’. Some authors have defended the translation ‘shining’,68 but the choice between ‘white’ and ‘shining’ is in reality a problem of our translations, not of the Greek term, which includes both notions simultaneously.69Since the cypresses common in Greece and the neighboring Mediter-ranean (cupressus sempervivens [ pyramidalis]) are not white, but of a dark green tone, the interpretation of this adjective has given rise to a long discussion. One interpretative line, already old and today abandoned, is based on the hypothesis that white alludes to some real characteristic of the tree, so that either an attempt is made to identify the infernal tree with some other different species, like the white poplar,70 which 66 Cf. the passages cited by Guarducci (1972) 324 n. 5.

This interpretation would be supported by various ritual dispositions like a sacred law from Keos from the 5th century B.C., prescribing that the dead were to be wrapped in three white mantles,72 another one of the Delphic phratry of Lebadeia from the end of the same century, ordaining that a dead brother is to be wrapped in a grey mantle,73 or the custom of the Messenians, which must have been very ancient, of burying their dead in white clothing.74 Finally, a law found in the sanctuary of the Despoina at Lykosoura and datable to the third century B.C.75 prohibits the faithful from appearing in the sanctuary in black clothing, and orders them to offer white poppies and white victims to the goddess.b) It is ‘white’ by association with the vestments of the initiates.76c) It is white because it is phantasmatic, like an apparition in the other world.77d) It is a designation a contrario,78 as if the infernal world were a kind of “upside-down world”.In sum, the adjective evokes both the ideas of the whiteness proper to objects of the afterlife and mourning clothes, and of the shining which, in the midst of the darkness supposed to permeate the after-life, must make it appear as kind of beacon, or a genuinely deceptive signpost of life (or false life) that attracts the souls of non-initiates to the light and, ultimately, to the fountain of Lethe and forgetfulness of all they have learned.71 Gruppe (1912) col. 105 f.72 IG XII 5, 593 (Sokolowski [1969], n. 97 A) 11, 2 f.73 Sokolowski (1969) n. 77 C 6.74 Paus. 4, 13, 3.75 Sokolowski (1969) n. 68.76 In the words of Gigante (1975) 223: “as white as dress of the initiate”.

App. II, n. 12). The deceased asks permission to take refreshment at a fountain near a tree, but the latter is always a sycamore, situated in a place to which one accedes after passing through many others, whereas the Greek cypress is found right at the entrance to the other world. Finally, the Egyptian dead man draws water from among the trees, or else it is offered to him by an arm that bursts forth from the tree, or a goddess located inside it—Nut, Nphthys or Hathor—; he does not have to choose between two fountains as in some of the Orphic tablets. Zuntz concludes that the motif of thirst is universal, and that it is therefore unnecessary to postulate an Egyptian model for the texts of the tablets. In his opinion,80 the cypress is more than a mere local place marker or picturesque detail: it seems to possess magical or mystical qualities, emphasized by its description as “shining-white”.81 He considers that this “Tree of Life” is not necessarily identi\u0002 able in botanical terms.82 It embodies the idea of immortality and the guarantee of abundance on earth and, simultaneously, it is a symbol of the water that grants life. Tree and water are sought by mortals like Gilgamesh, Adapa, Aeneas (the Golden Bough), and the deceased in the Egyptian Book of the Dead and those of the tablets, but they are guarded by gods, demons, or monsters, which proves the concept of in\u0002 nite vitality they 79 Zuntz (1971) 371 f., with the approval of Burkert (1975) 91 f. and the criticisms of Guarducci (1974) 19 f.

According to Zuntz, the Egyptians are not the only ones to offer an elixir of life, since these features are also found in the Ancient Near East, in such texts as Genesis, where the tree of good and evil appears, in Sumerian tablets, which speak of the tree of Kiskanu, or in the poem of Gilgamesh, who at the end of his long journey through the darkness contemplates the magic tree, black and shining with precious stones (end of tablet IX).82 Under the appearance of a cypress, we \u0002 nd it on an Elamite seal, and probably also on another Akkadian one. Cf. Van Buren (1945) 22 ff., for a discussion of sacred trees as objects of cult. In the tablets, however, there is no cult of trees. More interesting seems to us to be Van Buren’s alternative (1945) 29 on the evolution of the meaning of trees, from sacred object to symbol of fecundity and fertility. If this were so, the cypress of the tablets might represent the return to terrestrial life in the tablets, where it indicates the pernicious fountain, or, on the contrary, the rebirth to eternal life in the Cretan series, where it indicates the favorable fountain.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 2711/7/2007 9:52:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 chapter onecontain within themselves. This symbolism extends from Zoroastrianism, where the tree of life is called “white Hôm”, and the Greek garden of the Hesperides, to Celtic and German mythology; its rami\u0002 cations reach Persian poetry, medieval literature, and folklore, and it is even re\u0003 ected in some stories by the Grimm brothers.A \u0002 nal clue to the symbolism of the cypress is provided by the reports of Iamblichus and Hermippus,83 according to which in Orphico-Pythag-orean ritual, attendants of funeral ceremonies dressed in white, and it was not legitimate to build cof\u0002 ns of cypress-wood. The explanation these authors offer for such prohibitions is either that Zeus’ scepter was made of cypress-wood, or that it obeys a “mystic tale”.84 The religious cause could well be that proposed by Burkert,85 who agrees with Zuntz that the white cypress represents the tree of life, but whereas it is pos-sible to eat from this tree (Genesis 3, 22) the cypress gives no edible fruit whatsoever. The white cypress, adapted to the color of the white rock of hell, is a tree of corrupt life, a symbol of duration on earth and cyclic regeneration, for which reasons it was associated with resurrection to terrestrial life, which the initiate seeks to avoid, and therefore he must not touch the body of those who wished to remain in the other world and not return to life.Finally, it is worth noting that although direct allusions to obscurity and darkness are scarce in the texts of the tablets, nevertheless particu-lar emphasis is given to contrasts between light and shadow: opposite the dark obscurity of the ultraterrestrial world rises the white cypress. For similar reasons, the relatives of the dead woman from Hipponion deposited a small lamp in the tomb, and one initiate was buried in the Timpone Grande of Thurii wrapped in a white sheet.8683 Iamb.

The thirst of the dead and the two fountainsThe motif of the thirst felt by the dead in the Beyond is a universal belief that is still maintained in popular traditions.87 Libations and the custom of depositing recipients with water on tombs were often intended to assuage the thirst of the dead. The deceased is given drink and food for his posthumous existence, as Lucian tells us (On mourning 9):Those who have led a mediocre existence, who are the majority, wander through the meadow without their bodies, transformed into shadows, imperceptible to the touch, like smoke. They feed on the libations we make to them here, and on the offerings we consecrate before the graves. Thus, unless some friend or relative on earth remembers him, this dead man would remain without eating and would live hungry among the other shadows.88In the Myth of Er in the Republic (621 ab), Plato, who in many details seems to have taken Orphic sources as his models, speaks in his descrip-tion of the underworld path that leads to the plain of Lethe, which goesthrough terrible and suffocating heat, since it is bare of trees and of all fruits of the earth.Other testimonies to this belief could be cited, among them a signi\u0002 cant number of Greek inscriptions89 in which it is hoped for the deceasedthat Osiris may give you cold water.90not to mention infernal torture like that of Tantalus, who suffers eternal thirst in the other world as a punishment.91However, thirst can lead the deceased into an authentic trap, and he is therefore informed of the existence of two fountains:92 one, which 87 This theme has been amply studied by Deonna (1939).

Indeed, in the myth of Er, to which we have just referred, Plato tells us (Republic 621 ab) that the souls that return to earth go to the \u0002 eld of Forgetfulness (=\u0010\u0017\u000e) and drink water from the river of Lack of Worry ($μ\u0004&\u0010\u0012), which leads them to forget everything.94 The “water of forgetfulness” is also mentioned by an inscription of the 1st century B.C., in which a dead spouse consoles her widower (IKnidos 303, 11):I did not drink the last water of the forgetfulness of Hades,which means that she still preserves her identity and still remembers her husband. Lucian, for his part, after describing the place where dead arrive, in which there are also a lake and a meadow, speci\u0002 es in his On mourning 5:The drink that is memory’s enemy; that is why it is called “of Forget-fulness”.We are given the following explanation in a scholium to the Odyssey:95The soul of Elpenor, since it had not yet arrived at the plain of Forgetful-ness and had not yet drunk, recognizes Odysseus,which presupposes that if he had drunk, he would have lost his memory and his capacity of discernment. The “plain of Forgetfulness” is also mentioned by Aristophanes in his parody of the underworld journey in the Frogs (186). Dionysius of Halicarnassus also mentions it (8, 52, 4):And if there exists a place that receives human souls, once they have become separated from the body, no mute and subterranean place, in Tortorelli Ghidini [2006] 117 ff., who distinguishes between a '\u0010\u0005\u000e of the water of Forgetfulness and the stable waters of the &\u0016μ\u0005\u000e of Mnemosyne, in which she notices a pun with &\u0004\tμ9\u0005).93 Cf., among others, Nilsson (1943) 1 ff., (19612) 238 ff., Wagenvoort (1971) 130 ff.

There he must drink from the water called Forget-fulness, in order to forget what he had thought until then. Then he must drink from another water, that of Mnemosyne, by which he remembers what he saw when he went down.It is the clear that the “scenography” of the mystical sanctuary is con-\u0002 gured as a kind of imitation or correlate “to scale” of the entrance to the underworld.Propp,97 however, suggested a different interpretation of the formula of the tablet from Petelia (L 3, the only one known in his time), when he compared it with the theme of “living and dead water” of Russian tales, for instance Afanasiev 102:She sprinkled Prince Ivan with the dead water, and his body was put back together; she sprinkled him with living water and Prince Ivan got to his feet.Propp believes that the water being guarded is “dead water”, which gives the person who has just died a de\u0002 nitive death and the right to live in Hades for ever; the other, which is drunk by the deceased who do not know what they must do when they get to Hades, is “water of life”, which prevents them from entering Hades and leads them to a new life on earth.98Tortorelli Ghidini99 even suggests that the verb we have translated by “refresh themselves” (4-,\u0014\u0005\f\u0002\t) means ‘they receive life’,100 since 96 Cf. Bonnechere (2003) 169 ff. 97 Propp (1974) 287 f. (and much earlier, Comparetti [1910] 35 n. 1), followed by Scalera McClintock (1991) 400 f. Cf. Lincoln (1982) 19 f.

Et. M. s. v. 4-,\u0007 “has two meanings, ‘to give life’, whence also ‘soul’ (4\r,\u0010) and ‘to blow’”. Tortorelli Ghidini even suggests that we should read 4\r,\u0014)\u0005\f\u0002\t, since BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 3111/7/2007 9:52:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32 chapter onethe root 4\r,- would be related to 4\r,\u0010 ‘soul’ as well as ‘life’, rather than to 4\r,\u000b\u0012 ‘cold’.It would not be at all strange if the text were playing on both meanings, etymological puns on words, both explicit or suggested, and double-meaning expressions are characteristic of this type of text.101 It is clear that the verb has the meaning ‘they refresh themselves’. The thirsty souls approach the unnamed fountain to drink because they are thirsty and hot. Cold water (4\r,\u000b\u0005) is then mentioned, and we may recall the Latin inscription with the word refrig<eri>um in the Roman hypogeum from 250 A.D. beneath the Viale Manzoni, to which we referred,102 as well as the Christian refrigerium (App. II n. 14). However, since it is water of forgetfulness, when they drink it they forget every-thing they have learned during the initiation or in the experience of previous incarnations, and they no longer know what to do in order to be accepted into Hades. This implies that they will have to confront once more the '-'&\u0014\u0012 \u000f\u0004\u0005\u0011\u0019\u0004\u0007\u0005 that returns them to life in a body: they condemn themselves to returning to the world, and to living once more. In one way or another, in the prohibition of approaching the \u0002 rst fountain there is a reference to the fate of reincarnation.103Even in this case, however, we can suppose, adopting Tortorelli Ghidini’s suggestion, that the anonymous poet has taken advantage of the similarity between 4\r,\u000b\u0012 ‘cold’ and 4\r,\u0010 ‘soul’ so that the word 4-,\u0014\u0005\f\u0002\t ‘they refresh themselves’ can simultaneously connote etymo-logically the idea of ‘receiving life’. The allusion to reincarnation, which the -\u0014- in the Hipponion tablet can stand for either \u0014 or \u0014\r. In the tablet from Entella, however, \u0014 is distinct from \u0014\r, and this same verb clearly exhibits \u0014, not \u0014\r. Cf. Tor-torelli Ghidini (2006) 62, 121 where she reads 4-,\u0014\u0005\f\u0002\t.101 Cf., for the Orphic hymns, Morand (2001) 61ff.

Lloyd-Jones [1975] 226). Zuntz (1976) 138 f. has rightly observed that the mean-ing is completely different in the two expressions, although both are characterized by the same etymological \u0002 gure (cf. also Plat. Crat. 399 d–e, Arist. de Anim. 405b 27 f., Philol. in Timpanaro Pitag. 2, p. 186 f.). On puns with this verb, cf. Watkins (1995) 282, Bernabé (1999a). On 4-,\u0007, cf. Jouanna (1987). Prontera (1978) 48 and 56 ff. offers an ample list of parallels, and points out that we are in the presence of a con-notation of 4\r,\u0010 as ‘life’, more than as ‘soul’, with a value that is particularly negative for initiates, who understand that this revivifying (refrigerium) of non-initiates is in fact an ‘eternal dying’.102 Cf. supra § 1.2, n. 38 and App. II n. 13. Gallavotti (1978–1979) 342 maintains that 4-,\u0004\u0019\u0017\u0002\t contains the notion of cooling and cold, not of relief or refrigeration: the souls grow cold, but are not refreshed. This hypothesis was refuted by Guarducci (1985) 393, who prefers the more usual sense of ‘to refresh oneself ’.103 Scalera McClintock (1991) 401.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 3211/7/2007 9:52:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" arrival in the subterranean world (tablets L 1–6) 33scholars until now had assumed by means of external comparisons or interpretations of certain expressions from other tablets,104 would thus receive textual con\u0002 rmation. In this way, the souls, at the same time as they ‘refresh themselves’, also ‘receive life’ (false life, naturally, or mortal life).What is clear, moreover, is that the classical image of Hades has been altered.105 In the Homeric imagery, the souls entering Hades forget their previous existence, and remain there forever as mere \bμ\u0004\u0005\u000e\u0005A '\u0006\u000e\u0005\u0002 (Od. 10, 521, etc.), as specters without memory or knowledge. For the Orphics, by contrast, what the person who drinks the water of Forgetfulness forgets is initiation and previous experiences, and when he does so he erases his memory of the world and of the celestial realities, to which the soul is related. As a consequence, it must return to earth for a new incarnation. The water of Forgetfulness is now a symbol of the return to life, and to existence within time; this is the real exile of the soul, and the worse thing that can happen.On the other hand, in order to remember their experiences as initi-ates in due time and place—which represents precisely remaining in Hades—they must drink from the fountain of Memory, and for this they must be authorized by Persephone. However, keeping memories alive is not the only function of this salutary fountain. It is an indis-pensable element in the process of puri\u0002 cation and liberation from all forms of terrestrial life (human, animal, or vegetable).106 In short, cold water presupposes the de\u0002 nitive death of the corporeal element, whose de\u0002 ning feature is heat.107 Memory is also the source of immortality. Precisely because death is de\u0002 ned as the domain of Forgetfulness, he who, in Hades, conserves the memory of things, transcends the mortal condition, as we have already said.108 To drink from the fountain of Mnemosyne is the indispensable prerequisite for the initiate’s salvation,109 104 Concretely, on the Platonic Myth of Er (Resp. 614c, 621a) or on the verse from Thurii (L 9, 5) “I \u0003 ew out of the painful cycle of deep sorrow”, which alludes to the cycle of metempsychosis from which the initiate has succeeded in escaping.105 Vernant (1965 [= 1955]) 88 f.106 Pugliese Carratelli (1975) 230.107 Cf. also Gallavotti (1978–1979) 347.108 Vernant (1965 [= 1955]) 88 f. Cf. § 1. 2.109 In the words of Giangiulio (1994) 16. In the tablet from Petelia (L 3, 10) the fountain is called “sacred”, which, according to Velasco López (1990–1991) 180, can be considered as an anticipation of the becoming of a hero refered to in the following verse: since it is a divine fountain, it is logical that whoever drinks from it should share in such a nature. However, it seems instead that its divine character explains why it BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 3311/7/2007 9:52:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 chapter onesince the soul thus concludes its pilgrimage and achieves de\u0002 nitive death, enabling it to free itself from the cycle of reincarnations, and to participate in the privileged destiny enjoyed by the beati, among whom it henceforth belongs.We \u0002 nd no mention of the fountain of Mnemosyne outside of the tablets, except for the text from Pausanias we have cited, which refers to the cave of Trophonius. It would therefore not be odd to suppose that the Orphics, in search of a different and better destiny for their adepts, should have imagined a Beyond with a fountain whose waters would bring about a de\u0002 nitive death, that is, the end of the cycle of reincarnations. Its diffusion will therefore not have been as great as that of the fountain of Forgetfulness. The new mythical elaboration might have been an adaptation of an old myth of the two fountains, to which it gave a new meaning,110 or else may simply involved the creation of a new fountain of Mnemosyne, as a counterpoint to the fountain of Lethe.111 In this new mythical elaboration, some in\u0003 uence may be attrib-uted to the traditional motif of the ingestion of a pomegranate seed, which makes it impossible to return to the world of the living.112It has also been suggested that an Egyptian myth found in the Book of the Dead was used as a model.113 Some chapters begin with phrases like “To drink water in the divine region down below”, “Oh sycamore of Nut, give me your water”, or “Let me reach your water” (cf.

(= [1991] 49 f.) believes that we have to do with an ancient Indo-European motif.111 The hypothesis of Nilsson (1943) 4 ff. must be corrected in so far as the author attributes the innovation to the Hellenistic period, but the discoveries of the new tablets, such for instance as the one from Hipponion, force us to advance it at least until the 4th century B.C.112 Cf. h. Cer. 393 f. Scalera McClintock (1984) 132 f. reminds us that in his journey to the Beyond in the Odyssey, Odysseus must keep the thirsty souls away from the blood until the seer Teiresias has instructed him (Od. 10, 536 ff.). Thanks to this physiological \u0003 uid, the indispensable precondition for human life, the seer can recover its memory and ratiocination and thus speak the truth (\u0005\u000eμ\u0004\f\u0011\u0002 Od. 11, 96). Like Teiresias, the initiate is faithful to the truth, but before he drinks the water. In the tablets, blood, the immediate image of life, is substituted by water, which presupposes a more abstract and rationalized metaphor, suppressing all relations with earth. For Scalera McClintock, the initiate will receive true initiation after death, and only then will he drink the water of memory, which may represent the dissolution of the individual in the cosmos, the return to a kind of anima mundi, under the supposition that the Monad is named Mnemosyne.113 Cf.

The possibility of an in\u0003 uence should not be ruled out, although this in\u0003 uence is not unequivocal, given that the motif of thirst and the search for water are universal and are found in many cultures, from Antiquity down to our times.114 If there was such an in\u0003 uence, there-fore, there has been a profound adaptation of the motif: the Egyptian dead solicit water because it is thought that they will be hungry and thirsty if they are not given the offerings due to them, and in the Book of the Dead there is no reference to the disappearance or the conserva-tion of memory.In the Hellenistic period, Leonidas seems to have the model of the gold tablets in mind in an epigram that could be an interesting variation of the topic of the two fountains in Hades (A. P. 16, 230).Drink not here, traveler, from this warm pool in the brook, full of mud stirred by the sheep at pasture;but go a very little way over the ridge where the heifers are grazing; for thereby yonder pastoral pine you will \u0002 nd (\u00048\u0010\u0019\u0004\t\u0012)bubbling through the fountained rock a spring colder (4\r,\u000b\f\u0004\u0014\u0005) than northern snow.The importance of drinking the water of Mnemosyne for the initiate’s salvation explains why the fountain is watched over by guardians, and this will be another test to which the deceased must submit, and from which they will have to \u0002 gure out how to emerge successfully.1.6. The soul faced by the guardiansIn its journey, the soul encounters guardians (%-&\u0002'\u0004\u0012). The idea that guardians watch over the entrance in a secret place that only certain souls can reach is recurrent in Antiquity, and survived into Christianity.115 Other authors mention %-&\u0002'\u0004\u0012 associated with souls. For instance, Heraclitus116 speaks of certain souls whichRise once again and become guardians watching over the living and the dead.114 Cf. Deonna (1939) 53 ff. Nilsson (l943) 6 denies this explicitly, and Zuntz (1971) 370 f. considers it highly dubious.115 On the Christian testimonies, cf.

Naturally, the model here is that of the “password” uttered before sentinels, by whom the speaker is authorized to pass, provided that he knows information reserved for a concrete group. Here, the information proceeds, in all probability, from the initiation.The guardians of whom we are speaking seem to be represented on an amphora discovered at Vulci, dating perhaps from the 4th–3rd cen-turies B.C. Unfortunately, the piece has been lost, and all that remains to us is a description from the 1920’s:120In a \u0003 owery meadow, separated from the region of the condemned by trees with birds in their branches, there appear on a grassy hillock from which a spring \u0003 ows forth two naked young men, crowned with ivy and carrying a thyrsus, behind each of the trees, where a kneeling Oriental archer is in the act of shooting an arrow.The young men with thyrsi and crowned with ivy are obviously initiates, and the archer could be the guardian who prevents them from passing if they do not answer his question correctly. The idea that this is an underworld scene is corroborated by the fact that on the other side a demon was represented tormenting a woman with a torch, which could be interpreted as a stereotype of infernal punishment.Punishments in Hades are never mentioned in the tablets, since a situation never arises that the soul makes a mistake and fails to say what it should. In Platonic texts,121 we are informed that non- initiates (and 117 Plat. Resp. 620d. Not much can be inferred from the mention of guardians (%-&\u0002B\t\u0005) in a badly deteriorated part of the Bologna Papyrus (OF 717, 176), which contains an Orphic katabasis. Cf. also Plat. Phd. 107d–108c, and Calame (2006) 242, and Graf-Johnston (2007) 111 ff. who quote other similar texts about guardians in the underworld.118 Cf. P. Derveni col.

Most probably, in the context of con-solation for the dead represented by the tablets, it is not appropriate to speak of anything other than salvation.The concrete form of the guardians’ question varies from one tab-let to another, and may even be omitted. In the one from Hipponion (L 1, 9), it is expressed in indirect style in the following form:Why are you investigating the darkness of gloomy Hades?123The vestiges of the tablet from Entella (L 2, 11) seem to coincide with this same text. In the one from Pharsalus (L 4, 6) the guards ask:What necessity brings you to them.In the tablet from Petelia (L 3), the guards do not even formulate the question. Obviously, what is important is not that the deceased recall the question, but the answer. In the tablet from Pharsalus (L 4, 7) an interesting speci\u0002 cation is added, which does not appear in any of the others in the series. The deceased is urged:And you will tell them absolutely all the truth.However, the response is the same, or very similar, to the one that appears in the other tablets. Why is the deceased’s answer called “the truth”?Formally, the phrase is a topos found already in Homer. Thus, for instance, the elderly Priam urges the messenger Argeiphontes, servant of Achilles (Il. 24, 407):Come, then, tell me all the truth.In the Homeric expression, however, there are no religious connota-tions. All that is desired is that the interlocutor begin at the beginning and proceed point by point until the end. By contrast, such connota-tions are present in our text,124 and once again have an etymological 122 Cf. Bernabé (1998a) 76, (2002d).123 At v. 9, we must accept the correction 5%\u0005\u0010\u0004\u0005\f\u0014\u0012, on the basis of a text reading CDCFFGHCJ, rather than C=CFFGHCJ. Cf. § 1. 3.124 In contrast, Tortorelli Ghidini (1990) 73 f. points out that in the tablet, “to speak the truth” and “to drink from the fountain of Mnemosyne” are one and the same BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 3711/7/2007 9:52:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 chapter onefoundation (which, in this case, is correct). Etymologically, \b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 ‘truth’ is a privative compound of &\u0010\u0017\u000e ‘forgetfulness’, which means that ‘truth’ is conceived as ‘non-forgetfulness’.125 Whereas in Homer, what is requested is that the interlocutor ‘not forget’ anything and tell all that has happened, in the universe of the tablets, given the con-notations exhibited by forgetfulness, we are entitled to suppose that the truth is none other than that which must not be forgotten: again, the truth that has been learned during initiation or in previous lives. When the initiate is asked to tell exactly all the truth to the guardians of the lake of Mnemosyne, so that they may allow him to drink, he is asked to remember the truth that was revealed to him during his life, that is, the password indicating that he belongs to a group of initiates, who are the only ones to know certain doctrines.The truth implies a total memory that excludes &\u0010\u0017\u000e, or forgetful-ness, from the soul, just as the water of Memory excludes the water of forgetfulness in eschatological geography. Once again, we \u0002 nd an allusion to the contrast underlying the image of the two fountains.One of the most interesting parallels to this reference to the truth is the one provided by the bone tablets found in a temenos of Olbia Pon-tica, the ancient Borysthenes.126 These are three brief texts in which the word ‘truth’ (\b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002) appears in conjunction with mystical doctrines, occupying an outstanding position.The texts are as follows:127thing: the truth associated with cosmic Memory is transformed into a fundamental religious virtue, whence we witness the formation of a link between religious and logical truth. The concept of \b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 would also be related to that which appears in the ideal voyage of Parmenides, where $&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 is a divine personi\u0002 cation, or the revelation conceded to the man who knows. In his judgment, an Orphic in\u0003 uence can be detected in the intimate experience undergone by the \u0004\u0003\u001aK\u0012 %9\u0012 of the knowledge of $&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 and of overcoming the limits of his mortal nature. The relation between the prooemium of Parmenides and the tablets is even more clear if one accepts the suggestion of Pugliese Carratelli cited above (§ 1. 2.), who sees in the goddess Mne-mosyne the revealer of truth.125 Cf. Pugliese Carratelli (1988a) 165, Bernabé (1999a) 459 f.126 This is also the city in which Herodotus (4, 77–79) situates the initiation of the Scythian king Scylas into the mysteries of Bacchic Dionysus. Now, thanks to the \u0002 nds of the bone tablets in this same city, we can af\u0002 rm that what Herodotus describes was an Orphic cult.127 Cf. Dubois (1996) 154 f. n. 94 abc.

The concrete presence of the term \b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002—and no other—in the Orphic documents cited would agree with the tendency of the mid-5th century B.C., at which time the lexical group \b&\u000e\u0017\u0010\u0012-\b&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 began to be generalized to the detri-ment of its semantic equivalents, the groups \u001b\f\u0004\u000b\u0012-\u0013\f\rμ\u0014\u0012-\u001b\f\u0010\f\rμ\u0014\u0012; \u0005\u000eμ\u0004\f\u0010\u0012; \b\f\u0004'\u0010\u0012, which expressed the notion of true in Archaic Greek (cf.

Outside of the tablets, $&\u0010\u0017\u0004\t\u0002 was the personi\u0002 cation of the Truth in Greek as well, and as such was associated with various divinities, such as Zeus or Kronos, whose daughter it becomes, cf.

In what follows, we will try to provide an integrated vision of some of them, and present some alternative opinions.We must start from the basis that this phrase, like all the other mysti-cal declarations that appear in the tablets, is dense with meaning and, in its ambiguity, can express several meanings at the same time.In the \u0002 rst place, this is a belief that plunges its roots into very tra-ditional ideas, already expressed by very ancient authors. At Theogony 106, Hesiod refers to Earth and Heaven as a primordial couple, with very similar phraseology:Those who were born from Earth and starry Heaven.While at Works and Days 108, he provides a complementary view-point:As the gods and mortal men had a single origin.Pindar begins the 6th Nemean with a very similar declaration:One is the race of men, one that of the gods,Since we both breathe through a single mother (Earth).134While Porphyry (De abstinentia 3, 25 [222, 3 N.]) also attributes to Euripides (fr. 1004 Kannicht) the phrase:Earth and Heaven, common parents of all.135Naturally, this traditional idea is not suf\u0002 cient to explain why the deceased would declare a \u0002 liation as distant as this one precisely at this crucial moment. If this were an innocuous af\u0002 rmation, or an allusion to an admitted truth, it would scarcely be adequate for a particularly solemn moment in which the initiate must demonstrate his condition, that is, the fact that he is in possession of a knowledge that is not acces-sible to everyone, but only to the group to which he belongs. Hence in the \u0002 rst commentaries on the tablets, those who took for granted that they were Orphic considered that the deceased was alluding to 134 Pugliese Carratelli (1974) 120 f., (1976) 40 reduces to this comparison his sugges-tion that the initiate demonstrates that he has knowledge of a special dignity deriving from his awareness of a divine origin.135 It is maybe only an echo of Eur. Melan. fr. 484, 2 Kannicht “Heaven and earth had one form”, cf. Kannicht ad loc.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 4011/7/2007 9:52:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" arrival in the subterranean world (tablets L 1–6) 41the central myth of Orphism, that of Dionysus and the Titans. This was the interpretation maintained by such authors as Rohde, Harrison, and Olivieri.136According to this myth, Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Perse-phone. When he was still a child, Zeus delegated sovereignty over the gods to Dionysus. Inspired by jealousy that was probably provoked by Hera (it should be recalled that Dionysus is her stepson), the Titans, \u0002 rst-born divinities and prototypes of violence, decide to put him to death and devour him, which they do. Zeus punishes them by striking them with lightning, and Dionysus, in one way or another, recovers his integrity.137 The Titans’ being struck by lightning is placed in relation with human nature, the idea being that we have something of Dionysus within us, namely the part that had been ingested by the Titans. This is our positive, divine part, which desires to reintegrate itself with its originary nature. On the other hand, we have within us the remains of the Titans themselves. This is our sinful, proud, and wicked part, from which we must liberate ourselves. To expiate the abomination it has inherited from the Titans, the soul must suffer various punishments in Hades and a lengthy series of reincarnations. With time, and by means both of initiation into the knowledge of what enables it to save itself and of a life of purity and the observance of ritual taboos, the soul is able to purify itself of its crime and liberate itself from the eternal cycle of reincarnations, to achieve a state of beatitude in Hades.Thus, to return to our tablets, the declaration: “I am the son of Earth and starry Heaven” may be an allusion to the myth we have just related, as the \u0002 rst interpreters thought, since the Titans were sons of Earth and Heaven, and human beings, as descendants of the Titans, could refer to the same lineage.The criticisms of this line of approach are not consistent: neither the claim that it would seem to be dif\u0002 cult for an initiate to wish to rank equally with beings of such baneful destiny, nor the claim that 136 Rohde (18982) I 116 ff., Harrison (19223) 575, Olivieri (1915) 13 f.

It may seem illogical to present oneself before Persephone, declaring oneself to be a descendant of the assassins of her son, but not if one also declares oneself to be a descendant of Dionysus139 himself, and, moreover, if one also makes it very clear that he has liberated himself from blame (that is, the “titanic” part).Man can base some pretension to divinity upon the Titans’ crime, which enabled human beings to have something of the Dionysiac (and therefore divine) nature within them, but the mention of this lineage has a different meaning in the mouth of the initiate: all mortals are sons of Earth and starry Heaven, but only the initiates, who have lived the Orphic life, suffocating the Titanic aspect and cultivating the Dionysiac, can seek to claim special treatment in the Beyond, which probably consists in recovering their divine nature.140Man’s recognition of his Titanic origin has additional implications: the \u0002 rst is that the deceased initiate acquires brotherhood with the god-dess Mnemosyne herself, since she herself141 is the daughter of Earth and Heaven. The second is that he admits his dual essence, earthly and heavenly.142 We know of other texts that speak of how man’s body is of terrestrial origin, whereas his soul is related to the celestial ether. We \u0002 nd it, for instance, in the inscription of a tomb from Pherai:143138 Argument of Zuntz (1971) 364 f.139 The Titans ingested him, and in the ashes of his “combustion” there are remains of Dionysus’ body; therefore, mortals also descend from him.140 Guthrie (1935) 176.141 Hes.

Marcovich (1990) 77.142 The belief in mankind’s double origin is the only implication accepted by Festugière (1972) 62, who in turn bases himself on Dieterich (19253) 69, although he does not go into the matter in detail. Zuntz (1971) 366 gives rather more speci\u0002 cations when he proclaims man’s dual potentiality: man feels himself tied on the one hand to the earth, suffering and loving, yet, on the other hand, he is aware of his heavenly element.143 Datable to the 3rd century B.C., the \u0002 rst edition is due to Theocharis (1967) 297.

This celestial eschatology seems instead to be Pythagorean (and this would be a feature that separates the Pythagoreans from the Orphics, since the latter postulated an eschatology in Hades). The beliefs of the users of the tablets and those expressed by Lycophron, for instance, coincide with regard to the origin of the soul, but not with regard to its destiny. They share the idea of body/soul dualism, but the Orphic initiates buried with our tablets do not seem to believe that their optimal destiny is located in the stars. On the contrary, the initiate is told in the tablet from Petelia (L 7a, 7):you will go underground, once the same rites have been accomplished as the other happy ones.in addition to the fact that the path described in the texts of this group is always one that leads downwards (L 1, 4 “when going down”, and in all the others, the path passes through Hades and only through it).Other authors have studied in detail the meaning of the phrase “I am the son of Earth and starry Heaven”, making observations that seem highly interesting.

When he declares such an origin, the deceased initiate adopts a primordial and cosmic position, and asserts that he belongs to the universe. His consciousness is transformed: he is no longer a puny man in progress, but the “son of Heaven and Earth”, with all the rights of primogeniture.148For his part, Sabatucci149 insists that the phrase distinguishes the condition of the dead from that of the living, the idea being that the genuine human condition is only acquired at death. Human life is not real as compared to the reality represented by the divinity, because man’s life is ephemeral, whereas the gods are eternal. When he is alive, the human being belongs occasionally to a lineage (\u000f\u0011\u0005\u0014\u0012). Once he dies, the soul enters the eternal world of the gods, and therefore renounces its earthly \u000f\u0011\u0005\u0014\u0012 and considers itself to participate in another general and universal lineage.150Both interpretations are not only compatible, but completely recon-cilable with an Orphic vision.In some of the tablets an additional reference may be added to the basic declaration:L 4, 9 my name is Asterius,L 2, 15, L 3, 7 but my race is heavenly, know this, you too.Theoretically, one might think that Asterius was the name of the deceased, since it is well attested epigraphically as an anthroponym,151 but the name of the deceased man or woman is not included in any 148 According to Cosi (1975) 398, by this reply the initiate (μ-\u0019\f\u000e\u0012) manifests his awareness that he possesses a special dignity, owing to his divine origin and to the fact that he belongs by birth to Ouranian lineage, which allows him free access to the water of Mnemosyne, and therefore to a happy destiny. Marcovich (1991) 142 offers a series of parallels, where remembering one’s heavenly origins is indispensable for achieving eternal life: Od. 24, 1–2, Emped. fr. 111 Wright (= B 119 D.-K.), Hippol.

When he renounces his personal name, the initiate renounces the sign of mundane living and assumes a new name, not as a physical distinguishing feature, but as an indicator of the substance of a liber-ated soul.156 Coincidentally, this renunciation is accompanied by an almost complete absence of funerary furniture in these tombs. Both the expression “my race is heavenly” and “my name is Asterius” are additions necessary for eliminating any doubt that the guardians might have on the heavenly origin of the soul that is addressing them.157 It is the same certainty that the bearer of the tablet from Thurii tries to convey (L 9, 3 and 10, 3) when he confesses:Since I, too, boast that I belong to your blessed lineage.As far as this ideology is concerned, there are a couple of iconographical representations that exhibit striking coincidences with the phraseology of the tablets we have just seen. The \u0002 rst one comes from Ripacandida, a center inhabited by people of “North Lucanian” culture, near the Bradano valley, through which there was a path of communication with Metapontum. The \u0002 nd consisted of a jar found in a burial from the \u0002 rst part of the 5th century B.C., in which we \u0002 nd a human personage 152 Only in the tablet from Rome, which is much later and which, as we shall see in chapter V, exhibits very different characteristics. Also in the tablets that limit them-selves to pointing out the name of the mystes and/or his condition as such, examined in chapter VIII. 153 A son of Tectamus, married to Europa, who ruled in Crete, cf. Diod. 4, 60, Apollod. 3, 1, 4 etc. (cf. Willets [1962] 110, 166 f.). Zuntz (1971) 367 had already rejected the suggestion that Asterius was a human name, as well as any relation with mythical personages of the same name, and he defended this expression’s equivalence with verse 7 from Petelia (L 3), \u001bμ\u0014\u001d \u000f\u0011\u0005\u0014\u0012 \u00147\u0006\u0005\t\u0014\u0005.154 Decourt (1995) 130 recalls that a few kilometers from Pharsalus, where the tablet was found, was the city of Piresia, called Asterion in Homeric times, accord-ing to Strabo (1, 3, 18; 10, 2, 16), whose eponymous hero was a certain Asterios, cf. Decourt (1990) 162 f.155 Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 3 notes that “for the Orphics, Asterius must have immediately evoked the starry heaven (\u00147\u0002\u0005+\u0012 \b\u0019\f\u0004\u000b\u0004\t\u0012)”.156 Pugliese Carratelli (1975) 230 f.157 Verdelis (1950–1951) 103 f.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 4511/7/2007 9:52:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 chapter onewith one foot resting on a sphere, which seems to be traversed by a lightning bolt (represented by a zigzag line, ending in three points at each end).

For these reasons, Tagliente158 has placed them in relation with the Metapontine Pythagorean environment, and with the tablets we are studying.The text continues with the deceased declaring his thirst,159 and ask-ing to be given water from the fountain160 of Mnemosyne:I am dry with thirst and dying. Give me, then, right away,fresh water to drink from the lake of Mnemosyne.The formula recurs in almost all the tablets, with slight variations.161 The adjective we have translated as ‘dry’ (\u00026\u0014\u0012) is generally applied to the earth, to trees, or to fruit, that require water to live. This is the meaning that comes closest to the value it has in the tablets, since the initiate must accede to the water of Mnemosyne if he wants to save himself and begin to live a genuine life.

The verb is in the present tense, which indicates that he has not yet died (which would be expressed in the perfect), so that he can save himself if he succeeds in drinking from the salutary fountain.What is interesting about this entreaty is that through it the deceased person demonstrates that he has been initiated in two ways: the \u0002 rst because he is still thirsty (which indicates that he has not drunk from the other fountain), the second because he knows he must drink from the fountain of Mnemosyne. The ensemble of his words is thus a kind of “password”, which enables the soul of the deceased to identify itself as an initiate.A very similar scene can be read in the Egyptian Book of the Dead,163 where we read:Who are you, and whence did you come to the Beyond?(And the dead man replies:)I am one of you.The parallel is obvious, although the Book of the Dead includes a formula to remind the dead man of his name, which is alien to the conceptual world of the tablets.162 A very frequent meaning in theater, cf. Aristoph. Pax 354; Nub. 1077. In Christian literature, the term was to acquire the meaning of ‘to be lost, to condemn oneself ’; cf., for example, Eu. Io. 3, 16, Ep. Cor. 1, 18, Ep.

Continuing journeyThe tablet from Pharsalus (L 4) ends with a request for water. The tablets from Hipponion (L 1,13–14), Entella (L 2, 16–17) and Petelia (L 3, 11) specify that the guards allow the souls to drink. The tablet from Hipponion (and probably the one from Entella, although it is located in a lost part of the tablet) even adds an indispensable step to be taken after an adequate answer is given: (L 1, 13, L 2, 16):And to be sure, they will consult with the subterranean queen.This translation, which is that of our text, is based on two controversial readings.a) We read \u001b\u0011\u0014\r\u0019\t\u0005 ‘they will consult’,164 instead of \u001b&\u0004\u0014)\u0019\t\u0005 ‘they will take pity’, as was read previously.165 The dative case referred to the subterranean queen (or king, as we shall see has been read by oth-ers) makes it very dif\u0002 cult to accept \u001b&\u0004\u0014)\u0019\t\u0005. It obliges us to divide 8\u001c\u0014,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t into the two words 8\u001c+ ,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t, and to force the sense of the phrase into a dif\u0002 cult “and they will take pity, for the sake of (8\u001c\u000b) the earthly monarch (or queen)”. 8\u001c\u0014,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t ‘subterranean’ is in\u0002 nitely more adequate to the context, whereas a “pity by delegation” on the part of the guardians seems dif\u0002 cult to believe. On the other hand, it is rather more logical to understand that the guards must “ask” or “consult with” the divinity, since they are not the ones who decide on the fate of the deceased person, but they refer the matter to the authority on which they depend, and in whose hands the ultimate decision lies.b) We read 8\u001c\u0014,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t (\u0002\u0019\t&\u0004\u0016<\u0002\t>,166 identifying the divinity con-sulted as Persephone, as opposed to 8\u001c\u0014,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t (8\u001c+ ,\u0017\u0014\u0005\u0016\u0007\t) (\u0002\u0019\t&L[ ‘the subterranean monarch’, which would imply that the dead person is handed over to the presence of a masculine god.

However, the ensemble of the tablets and iconography suggest that it is the goddess Persephone, and not Hades, who has in her hands the decision over the fate of the dead in this religious context.

In sum, it seems much better to read (\u0002\u0019\t&\u0004\u0016<\u0002\t> “queen”, and think that it applies to Persephone, whose role in this eschatology we shall return to discuss in more detail (§ 2.3).The consequences for the soul of the initiate of his success in the tests to which he has been submitted are, one supposes, good. This is no doubt a happy situation, far from the dark destiny that awaits souls in the Homeric vision. The guardians allow it to drink, but the tablets we have read tell us very little about the continuation of the path and the achievement of the goal.L 1, 14–15So that, once you have drunk,171 you too will go along the sacred way by which the other mystai and bacchoi advance, gloriousL 3, 11and afterwards you will reign with the other heroes.In the tablet from Pharsalus (L 4) all indications are omitted at the end. In the one from Entella (L 2, 18 f.) there was a continuation, but it is in a broken part of the tablet.

For the moment, we shall devote a few lines to the mention in the tablet from Hipponion of the “sacred way”.1.8. The sacred wayThe meaning of the reference to the sacred way has been much dis-cussed. One interpretative approach175 considers that the allusion is to a real sacred way. The three most famous sacred ways in Greece were those of Eleusis, of Delphi, and of Elis, but the only one that could be traveled by both mystai and bacchoi was the Eleusinian one, which led from Athens to the sanctuary of Eleusis. Although the idea of a real road may seem suggestive, we do not believe that the !\u0004A ]\u001a\u000b\u0012 of the tablets can be identi\u0002 ed with any concrete path; the mythico-religious solidity of the mention of the path in the text from Hipponion does not seem to have been determined by the concrete experience of a local ritual context.176 In addition, if privilege in the Beyond is a reiteration of the privilege represented by initiation, we shall have to look at the Bacchic mysteries more than the Eleusinian ones.In any case, it can be accepted as a projection of the terrestrial model, that is, as a model of inspiration for the ideological con\u0002 guration of that other sacred way,177 conceived as a repetition of the initiatory path 173 Bernabé (1999c) suggests the reading ^\u0004[\u0019\u0004%\u000b\u0005\u000e\t?2 Chaniotis in Chaniotis-Mylonopoulos (2000) 21 suggests ^\u0004[\u0019\u0011%\u0002\u0019\u0019\u0002.

There, the Ocean breezes blow about the Isles of the Blessed, golden \u0003 owers shine, some on the ground, on the branches of splendid trees, while others are nourished by water. With them they weave hands and crowns in garlands, under the right counsels of Rha-damanthys.Another link between the mystes and Rhadamanthys is found in a verse by Posidippus of Pella (fr. 118, 24–25 Austin-Bastianini = fr. 37, 21 ff. Fernández-Galiano):May I travel the mystic way towards Rhadamanthys.182In a passage we have already cited in § 1.3 (Hegesippus, fr. 5 G.-P. = Anthologia Palatina 7, 545), Hegesippus, a slightly younger contemporary, tells us:By the road that goes from the pyre towards the right, they saythat Hermes leads the good towards Rhadamanthys.In this last case, it is “the good” that reach Elysium, rather than the mystes.178 Feyerabend (1984) 1 ff., who in this context also takes into consideration the prooemium to the poem of Parmenides, which, he claims, derives from two different traditions: the poetic and secular one of Homer and Hesiod, and that of the mystery cults. The relation between ritual practices and the itineraries of the souls of initiates is already shown by Plato (Phd. 108a) “He (Aeschylus) says that the path that leads to Hades is simple, but it seems to me that it is neither simple nor unique . . . unless it is because it presents many bifurcations and crossroads. I say this by conjecture on the basis of funeral rites and usual ceremonies of that place”. 179 As does Burkert (1975) 91.180 Cf. Eur. Bac. 194 “The god will guide us effortlessly to both of them”, Aristoph. Ran. 402 ff. “Show how effortlessly you travel a long road”. Cf.

Mystai and bacchoiMystai and bacchoi are mentioned in L 1, 16. The meaning of the \u0002 rst word is clear: the mystai are initiates into a mystery religion. We encounter the term again in other tablets (e.g. L 16 b–e). With regard to (\u0006',\u0014\u0012, it is in reality an epithet of Dionysus. The term corresponding to a believer would be (\u0006',\t\u0014\u0012, but there is an inversion in the use of both quali\u0002 ers.185 It is worthwhile asking why both are mentioned.186 .-\u0019\f\u000e\u0012 is the generic term for designating an initiate with no concrete reference to a particular cult, whereas (\u0006',\u0014\u0012 is more restricted to the Dionysiac environment.183 Cf.

B 1, 2–3 D.-K.: “the mares that carry me . . . escorted me, once they had come and fetched me onto the wide-renowned road of the divinity that carries the man who knows through all the cities”. This Parmenidean way, far from the roads of men, is open only to the person who is willing to travel the path of wisdom and salvation: cf. ibid., v. 27: “this road for in truth, it is far from what is walked by men”.

The souls destined to be reincarnated drink from Lethe, return to a mortal body, and are born again.We do not believe that the parallel can be sustained in the extreme form it assumes in Guthrie. His reconstruction is based too much on the Platonic scheme, as if the Athenian philosopher had faithfully followed the Orphic model and were therefore a reliable source for reconstructing Orphism.On the contrary, everything indicates that the parallelism between Plato and the situation alluded to (if not described) by the tablets is not quite so strict. The “geography” coincides, but only in part: the fount of Lethe, the paths on both sides, the plain in which one experiences great thirst. Yet there are profound differences. Plato tells us nothing of the deceptive cypress tree, and, on the other hand, neither in our tablet nor in any other are any judges mentioned in this description. Above all, however, there are two distinct schemes. In Plato, we hear of a judgment, after which the soul, completely passive, is judged, rewarded or condemned, and is taken to its corresponding place. Its fate is decided, for the sins or good deeds of its past life will be its only credentials. The person who is judged and “approved” goes to Elysium for his merits. Plato speaks194 of guides, who are not mentioned in the tablets (although Guthrie195 thinks he can \u0002 nd them in the person who pronounces some of the words in the tablets, which is unlikely). If the deceased is condemned to reincarnation, he is given water from Lethe to drink.On the other hand, in the scheme described in the tablets, the soul, which is active, \u0002 nds itself faced by a test it must overcome. This is the behavior demanded from the soul in the moment of its transition to the other world: that it should not take the wrong path. Everything depends on it, and on the fact that it remembers what it must do: this is why it has recourse only to Mnemosyne, so that she may help it to remember the teachings it has received. If it does what it should do, it will be successful. If it makes a mistake, it will be reincarnated.

Instructions for use?In a broken part of tablet L 3, 13, one reads ]\f\u000b\u001a\u0004 \u000f\u00024[. Some authors consider that this sequence (together with the reference to the moment in which the deceased has just died and been covered by the veil of darkness) could refer to the occasion in which the tablet itself was fashioned or used.

Short versions: the Cretan tabletsWe \u0002 nd a series of tablets (\u0002 ve at Eleutherna and one in Milopota-mus) with a text that is practically identical, with minimal variants199 and various insigni\u0002 cant graphic errors (L 5a–f). Another one, with a slightly longer text, is at Malibu, California (L 6). Recently, another tablet from Sfakaki with a similar text (but with some strange readings) has been found (L 6a).In this group of brief tablets, the theme we have seen in the longer ones from the same group has been reduced to its minimal expres-sion. Only the soul’s request to drink “from the fountain of eternal \u0003 ow” is taken up.200 The fountain that always pours forth and is never exhausted evokes the eternity that, in the tablets from Hipponion, Pete-lia, Pharsalus and Entella, is represented by the lake of Mnemosyne. The fountain is near the cypress tree. We see, then, that the motif of the cypress tree has been reversed: from being an indication of the fountain from which one must not drink, it becomes the indication of that from which one must drink. The guardians’ question201 is included, and the standard reply:I am the son of Earth and of starry Heaven.The tablet from Malibu (L 6) is a kind of intermedial stage of the text between the \u0002 rst four and the seven Cretan ones. It is almost identical to the latter, but with two signi\u0002 cant differences: one is that the cypress is not explicitly associated with the fountain (L 6, 2):199 Particularly in the formula of the request for water, studied in detail by Velasco (1994) 455 ff.200 Comparetti (1910) 39 maintained that \u0002\u0003\u0011\u0005\u0002\u0014\u0012 was more noble and poetic than \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0016\u0014\u0014\u0012, Kern (1922 [= 1972]) 106 considered \u0002\u0003\u0011\u0005\u0002\u0014\u0012 preferable because it was less common, Olivieri (1915) 15 af\u0002 rmed that \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0016\u0014\u0014\u0012 was a gloss on \u0002\u0003\u0011\u0005\u0002\u0014\u0012. The term \u0002\u0003\u0011\u0005\u0002\u0014\u0012 is better adapted to the dactylic meter, for which reason some scholars, like Velasco López (1990–1991) 282, consider it to be older than \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0016\u0014\u0014\u0012, whose appear-ance may be related to a word from the same root, \u001c\u0014\u0011\u0014\u0005, which is present in other tablets, like those from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia and Pharsalus. In any case, this is a traditional epithet (cf. Hes. Op. 595, Apoll. Rhod. 3, 222, etc.). We \u0002 nd it in rela-tion with the world of the dead and the Beyond in Plato (Phd. 111d), who speaks of “rivers of eternal \u0003 ow”, in Apollonius Rhodius (3, 860), who refers to the perennial waters in which the magician Medea bathes as she invokes Brimo, whom she quali\u0002 es as “sovereign of the dead”, and in Aristophanes’ parody of the Beyond (Ran. 146), where we read of “mud and shit of eternal \u0003 ow”.201 As was already noted by Guarducci (1939b) 169, and not from the fountain itself, as was thought by some of the \u0002 rst interpreters.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 5611/7/2007 9:52:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" arrival in the subterranean world (tablets L 1–6) 57On the right, a white cypress.Whereas in the majority of the Cretan tablets (L 5, 2), this does take place:On the right, where the cypress is.Note that the whiteness of the cypress has also disappeared.The second signi\u0002 cant difference is the addition at L 6, 4:but my race is heavenlywhich coincides exactly with an expression contained in the tablet from Petelia (L 3, 7) and the one from Entella (L 2, 15). This links the short tablets from Crete even more closely to the longer tablets from the same group.The tablet from Sfakaki (L 6a) is rather anomalous. In the \u0002 rst verse, the verb \b\u001c\u000b&&\rμ\u0002\t changes to \u001c\u0002\u0002\u001c\u000b&&\r\f\u0002\t, in the third person, as if it did not form a part of the soul’s speech. Consequently, the rest of the verse is restructured.In the second verse, which refers to the fountain, one reads \u0002\r\u0014\r, which sequence we may interpret as “of eternal \u0003 ow” (\u0002\u0003<\u0004\t><\u000b>\u0014\r), just as in other tablets of the series, or “of the lizard” (<J>\u0002-\u0014\r);202 in addition, the fountain is located “on the left of the cypress”.In the third verse, there appears the strange reply:I am the mother of Earth and starry Heaven.which does not have much meaning. It is likely that there has been a contamination between the better-known formula “I am the son of Earth and of starry Heaven” with an alternative “The Earth is my mother and the starry Heaven, my father”.The last verse is followed by a line with a meaningless sequence of letters, which “seem to be a repetition by confusion of the beginning of the text, or perhaps a new formula of the process of question and answer”.203 In our opinion, the capricious sequence of letters might obey the desire to cover the surface of the tablet completely with writing.202 If this were the case, we would have here an allusion to the Lizard Fountain, cited by Theophr. Hist. Plant. 3, 3, 4: “In Crete . . . there is a fountain called ‘of the Lizard’ ”; cf. Tzifopoulos forthcoming, ad loc.

The relation between the long and the shorter tabletsIn our opinion, the Cretan tablets and the Thessalian one from the Malibu museum are the result of changing the ancient freedom of the longer tablets into a more schematic and formalized model. The most obvious case is that of the Cretan tablets. In view of the itinerant character of the Orphics—whom we may call “missionaries”—they will probably have transplanted these new religious beliefs, originat-ing in Magna Graecia, to Crete, bearing with them a model of tablet than was highly stereotyped and schematized. Even the tablet that preserved at Malibu (found in Thessaly, L 6) is shorter than the \u0002 rst four ones, but somewhat longer than the ones from Crete. It preserves the phrase “but my race is heavenly”. In it, the cypress, which is still white, still remains on the right, but it should be understood that we must interpret, by paraphrasingon the right (where the soul must not go, there remains) a white cypress.The tree’s change of situation and the loss of the symbolic value of its whiteness, whatever it was, take place in the adaptation of this Thes-salian model (represented in the one from Malibu), to the tablets of Crete, through a misunderstanding due to the syntactic ambiguity of the Thessalian original. The phrase we have just cited is transformed toon the right, where the cypress is.204The contrary has been proposed:205 that the short tablets are not the result of the abbreviation of the long ones, but, on the contrary, are the more primitive form of those documents in which there would be only one fountain for cooling off the thirst of the dead, pointed out by a cypress. Later on, as a consequence of the adaptation of this image to Orphic beliefs, this scene of the fountain and the cypress, almost a perfect locus amoenus, would be relegated to the deceased in general, with a new fountain being created exclusively for the initiates. Several 204 Also, from other points of view, Burkert (1975) 91 f. and n. 21 considers that the symbolism of the white cypress would be lost in the version from Crete, where the cypress marks the good fountain, with the result being a similar confusion between right and left. 205 For instance, Velasco López (1990–1991) 52 ff. Also Calame (2006) 255 f. thinks that the short text is addressed to the common mortals.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 5811/7/2007 9:52:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" arrival in the subterranean world (tablets L 1–6) 59motives prevent us from accepting this viewpoint: a) The long tablets are a century older than the Cretan ones. b) They are distributed throughout a wider area (Magna Graecia, Thessaly, and Sicily), whereas the brief ones are concentrated in a smaller area. c) As we have just seen, the passage of the text from the longer ones to the Cretan ones, through the model of the one from Malibu, which will have been misunderstood, can easily be explained. This is not the case for the inverse process. It therefore seems more likely and more in accordance with the chronology and distribution of the documents to think that the long documents are older, and that a reduced model that was later “exported” to Crete, where it became stereotyped.1.14. Gender hesitationsSome hesitations are found in the tablets in the use of grammatical gender. In L 1 and L 4 the deceased confesses that he is “dry” (in the masculine), and in all cases, except for some of the brief tablets in which one speaks of a “daughter”,206 declares himself “son (in the masculine) of Earth and of starry Heaven”. This is curious, since the cadaver that wore the tablet from Hipponion was a woman. Nevertheless, in L 3 the adjective “dry” appears in the feminine gender, although in this case, our very poor information on the archaeological context of the \u0002 nd prevents us from knowing the sex of the believer. These hesitations on gender can be explained by the factors encountered: on the one hand, the formulary character of these phrases brings it about that a deceased woman can utter a stereotyped formula in the masculine. On the other hand, there is always considerable ambiguity surrounding the determination of whether the speaker is the deceased person (who, if he is a male, would speak in the masculine) or his soul (which would speak of itself in the feminine, since 4\r,\u0010 is feminine in Greek.207 In view of this situation, hesitations are not surprising.206 Cf. the material in Graf (1993) 257 ff.; see also Betz (1998) 402 n. 11. There is a different interpretation in Edmonds (2004) 65–69, who believes that there was a predominance of female over male initiates. Calame (2006) 248–250 compares the gender hesitation in gold tablets with those present in Pindar and other Archaic and Classic lyric poets.207 Cf. Comparetti (1910) 40, yet it should be recalled that 4\r,\u0010 is only mentioned in Hipponion, Petelia and Thurii.BERNABE_f3_9-59.indd 5911/7/2007 9:52:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"BERNABE_f4_60-94.indd 6011/7/2007 9:52:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOA RITUAL FOR THE DEAD: THE TABLETS FROM PELINNA (L 7AB)Translation of tablets L 7ab from PelinnaThe two tablets from Pelinna (L 7a and 7b) were found in Thessaly in 1985, on the site of ancient Pelinna or Pelinnaion. They were placed on the breast of a dead female, in a tomb where a small statue of a maenad was also found (cf. a similar \u0002 gure in App. II n. 7). Published in 1987, they revolutionized what had been known and said until then about these texts, and contributed new and extremely important view-points.1 They are in the shape of an ivy leaf, as they are represented on vase paintings,2 although it cannot be ruled out that they may represent a heart, in the light of a text by Pausanias that speaks of a “heart of orichalcum” in relation to the mysteries of Lerna.3 Everything in the grave, then, including the very form of the text’s support, suggests a clearly Dionysiac atmosphere, since both the ivy and the heart evoke the presence of the power of Dionysus. The text of one of the tablets is longer than that of the other. It has been suggested4 that the text of the shorter tablet was written \u0002 rst, and since the entire text did not \u0002 t, the longer one was written. We present the text of the latter:51 These tablets were studied in depth by their \u0002 rst editors Tsantsanoglou-Parássoglou (1987) 3 ff., and then by Luppe (1989), Segal (1990) 411 ff., Graf (1991) 87 ff., (1993) 239 ff., Ricciardelli (1992) 27 ff., and Riedweg (1998).2 For the relation of ivy with Dionysus, cf. Eur. Bac. 81, where the initiates, crowned with ivy, honor Bacchus; Aristoph. Thesm. 988, where Dionysus is invoked as \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t \u000b\u0002\f\t\r\t, and Orph.

For ivy crowns in the cult of Dionysus, cf. Blech (1982) 212 ff.3 Paus. 2, 37, 2–3. Let us not forget that the heart was the part of Dionysus that was not ingested, and from which he was reborn, according to the Orphic myth (OF 314 f. and 327). We owe this suggestion to David Jordan. The possible form of heart has been also proposed by Theodossiev (1996) 224 and Martín Hernández (2006) 448 ff.4 Ricciardelli (1992) 27.5 The shorter one exhibits the same text, without lines 4 and 7.BERNABE_f4_60-94.indd 6111/7/2007 9:52:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62 chapter twoL 7a–b Two tablets from Pelinna, 4th cent.

He refers to the present (“you have wine”), to the past, both immediate (“you have just died and have just been born”) and distant (“Bacchus himself has liberated you”), and to the future (“you will go under the earth”), and he urges the soul to say something in the presence of the goddess of the underworld (which implies a reference to the immedi-ate future). The possibilities for the speaker’s identity are set forth by Riedweg:7 it is either someone talking in the underworld, or the tablet itself, or the initiating priest, or someone taking part in the funerary rites.8The reference to a concrete day (“on this day”) on which the deceased has just died probably situates us at the funeral.

However, it is doubted whether the formulas mentioned are those of the funeral or of the initiation.The metrical form is also strange. The \u0002 rst verse has an almost hexametric form, although it is broken by the word \u001a\b\u0003\u0004\u0007\u001c\u0003\t ‘thrice happy’. Whatever the explanation one may give for this phenomenon,9 the fact is that the author has preferred to use a word that surely has strong ritual implications and alters the meter, rather than using another less signi\u0002 cant one to maintain a metrically correct sequence. There follows a perfect hexameter with the indication to the mystes that he should declare to Persephone that Bacchus has liberated him. One sup-poses that such a declaration must take place in an immediate future. The following three lines are not hexametric. They are probably in prose, with a rhythmic, but not metrical structure.10 Line 4 consists of four dactyls (perhaps the end of a hexameter), and \u0002 nally, a perfect hexameter.It is possible that the changes in metric structure and the intrusion of prose result from a different origin and/or a different function of the parts. We will have occasion to return to this question. 9 Tsantsanoglou-Parássoglou (1987) 11 suggested that in the model μ\u001d\u0002\u000b\b or \u001e\t\u0007\u0014, which could be adapted to the verse, were read instead of \u001a\b\u0003\u0004\u0007\u001c\u0003\t. In the \u0002 rst case, it would have been substituted because μ\u001d\u0002\u000b\b cannot be used to address the deceased of both sexes, while in the second, it was to mitigate the notion of dei\u0002 ca-tion. These reasons are criticized by Ricciardelli (1992) 29, since dei\u0002 cation is clear in other parallel expressions of the tablets, which we cite further on. Graf (1991) 88 and 99 suggests that \u001a\b\u0003\u0004\u0007\u001c\u0003\t could be substituted for μ\u001d\u0002\u000b\b because the former is more emphatic and could be better adjusted to the oral situation of ritual macarism, in which he suggests the text would be represented. He cites in support the testimony of Lucian, Nigr. 1, in which the word \u001a\b\u0003\u0004\u0007\u001c\u0003\u0005\u0014 is mentioned, and quali\u0002 ed as \u001a\u001f \u0015\u0016\u001f \u0004\u0002\u001b\u000f!\u0014 \"\u000f\u0005μ\u000b ‘theater-word’, which is therefore used in an eminently oral situ-ation (cf.

Giangrande (1991a) 82 f. opts for another explanatory approach, and thinks the verse is a dactylic heptameter with \u001a\b$\u0014 measured long by nature. The truth is that it is useless to worry about meter in this tablet, where there is more rhythm than meter. What seems clear is that \u001a\b\u0003\u0004\u0007\u001c\u0003\t, with the references to number three and to happiness, which links up well with \t%&\u000b'μ\u0005\u000f\u000b in l. 6, is perfectly framed here.

The consideration of the deceased as happy, the mention of the fact that death and birth have occurred in unison, and the use of the verb “to liberate” in the following line imply that the speaker is convinced that the deceased has not simply suffered a death from which a new human life has been reborn, but has de\u0002 nitively abandoned the human sphere12 to accede to the place of the blessed. The macarism formulas of the other tablets express the initiate’s newly acquired status with greater clarity:L 8, 4 You have been born a god, from the man that you were.L 9, 8 Happy and fortunate, you will be god, from mortal that you were.L 11, 4 Come, Caecilia Secundina, legitimately changed into a god-dess.In Pindar (fr. 137 Maehl.), we \u0002 nd a reference that seems to allude to a similar doctrine, albeit in an Eleusinian environment: Happy is he who, having contemplated that,13 goes beneath the earth!For he knows the end of life, and knows the beginning given by Zeus.We no doubt have to do with a mystery ritual, in which happiness after death is promised.

In Pindar (Ol. 2, 75 f.), there is a distinction between the good, who after their death lead an existence without pain, and the souls of superior quality, who are able to complete the full cycle of existence three times without stain, and who, following the path of Zeus, go to the bastion of Kronos, in the island of the Blessed.18 Empedocles (fr. 107, 6 Wright [= B 115, 6 D.-K.]) speaks of a penalty that will last for times that are thrice uncountable,19 and Herodotus informs us about the avatars of the human body when it separates itself from the body, according to the Egyptians:20 man’s soul suffers reincarnations in various animals and human beings, in a process that lasts three thousand years, and this doctrine, according to him, “was followed by the ancient Greeks”.

It may also be for the same reason that the formula involving the fall into the milk is uttered three times, albeit with variations.The macarism is pronounced at a precise moment (now, on this day). The insistence on the element of time has been pointed out,22 as has the particular urgency that characterizes this tablet, as it does other Orphic tablets.23 One gets the impression that everything must be decided in little time. This impression of urgency is corroborated by the verbs of the central lines: (\u001e\u0005\b\t\u0014 ‘you leapt’, and (\u0016\t\u0004\t\u0014 ‘you fell’.

Everything supports the interpretation that the text of the tablet re\u0003 ects the precise moment of the funeral, which is also conceived as that of the deceased’s passage to another kind of life, this one happy and durable. It has been suggested that the occasion could be that of initiation,25 but this is a false problem, since for the Orphics both are one and the same thing.262.3.

The tablet is limited to the following phrase:Tell Persephone that Bacchus himself has liberated you.27This is a phrase laden with meaning, which requires a thorough com-mentary, both with regard to the role played by Persephone and Bac-chus in this eschatology, and to the meaning of the “liberation” that is mentioned.Let us begin with Persephone. In reality, the goddess had already been alluded to in the \u0002 rst group we studied, since she is the “subter-ranean queen” before whose presence the deceased had to present himself, after correctly answering the guardians’ question, but here she is called by her name.In other tablets, she also appears as the queen of the underworld, in whose dominion the paradise promised to the initiates is located:L 8, 5–6 Hail, hail, when you take the path to the right towards the sacred meadows and groves of Persephone.L 10, 6 Now I come as a suppliant before the chaste Persephone.We also \u0002 nd her in the short tablets from Milopotamus (L 15), and Pella (L 16b). Although her name does not appear in one tablet from Pherai (L 13), the presence of Brimo (one of her invocations) and the allusion to the “sacred meadow” evoke “the sacred meadows and groves of Persephone” cited in the tablet from Thurii (L 8, 6). She is also, no doubt, the “queen of the underworld beings”28 mentioned in the tablets from Thurii and Rome, and she appears as such in the Orphic Hymns (29, 6):Mother of the Eumenides, queen of the underworld beings.Likewise, she is mentioned several times in the “great” tablet from Thurii (L 12), according to our interpretation:L 12, 1 To Cybelea, daughter of DemeterL 12, 5 Nestis27 The same formula may have been in L 2, 20 f., cf.

Perhaps this is why the hopes for a life in the Beyond could be placed in the goddess, which must have promoted the extension of her cult through Magna Graecia and Hellas.31 In the Orphic Hymn to this goddess, one also \u0002 nds re\u0003 ected her generative and destructive ability, and she is begged to send the fruits of the earth to mortals (Orph. Hymn. 29, 15 ff.):Life and death you alone are for long-suffering mortals,Persephone, since you always feed everything and destroy everything.Listen to me, happy goddess, and send us the fruits of the earth.Persephone plays an important role in all the Eleusinian rites, for which reason some authors have supposed a connection of these tablets with the Eleusinian world rather than the Orphic one. Further on,32 we shall offer the reasons that make us prefer the relation with Orphism.According to Orphic tradition, Persephone is born as the result of the rape of Demeter by Zeus. Zeus in turn violates her as well, and she gives birth to Dionysus Bacchus.33 As the mother of Dionysus, Perse-phone can also be considered the mother of mortals, who, according to the Orphic myth, descend from the Titans who had devoured her son.34 Indeed, according to our interpretation of the “great” tablet of Thurii, it is she that the deceased addresses, calling her “mother”:29 Hdt. 6, 134; 7, 153 calls Demeter and Persephone “underground goddesses”. The use of \u000b\u0004'\u001c\t\u0003\u000b (cf. Zuntz [1971] 308) is a highly original expression, non-Homeric, and closer to Hesiod’s references to ,\t\u0011\u0014 \u000b\u0004\u0003\u001c\t\u0019\u0014 than to the application of \u000b\u0004'\u001c\t\u0003\u000b to Hera in the Homeric Hymn to that goddess (Hom.

In this sense, the information provided by Cavallari,35 the archaeologist who excavated the tumulus of Timpone Grande at the end of the 19th century, is highly interesting. He mentions among the objects found, like the tablets, on the torso of the deceased:due solidissime pistrelle di argento coll’impronta ognuna di una teste muliebre con capelli radianti ed ornamento al collo.This description is similar to that of many Apulian vases, in which the woman is Persephone.36 Indeed, Dionysus and Persephone appear side by side in Apulian iconography to ensure the deceased’s passage and reception in the Beyond. On an Apulian vase37 there appear Persephone, with her torch, representing her infernal function, held crossways, and Hades seated opposite, greeting Dionysus. Dionysus is accompanied by two maenads with torch, thyrsus and tambourine, and the satyr Oenope (‘wine-face’). Finally, the presence of Hermes in a position symmetrical to that of Dionysus favors its interpretation as a scene of passage. The familiarity of the gesture of shaking hands indicates Dionysus’ in\u0003 uence among the infernal gods and is a sign of his salvi\u0002 c function.It cannot be a coincidence that the portrait of the goddess is situated in the same place, over the torso, as the tablets that allude to her, which indicates that if the deceased has had himself buried either with a gold tablet inscribed with a message for Persephone, or else with a silver plaque with a portrait of the divinity, it is because he has con\u0002 dence in her protective power.

In the tablet from Pella (L 16b), her name appears in the dative, which is to be understood in the same sense as in the texts from Pelinna: the goddess’ attention is attracted, and Posidippus’ condition as an initiate in the mysteries is communicated to her, so that she may guarantee him a favorable position in the Beyond.39The various mentions of Persephone in the tablets show her as a divinity who protects the initiates, and plays a fundamental role in their salvation,40 since she is the judge who ultimately determines their 39 Cf. Dickie (1995) 82, Rossi (1996) 59 ff., and the commentary on the tablet from Milopotamus (L 15) in § 8. 2.40 Di Filippo Balestrazzi (1991) 75 f. has studied the similarity between Persephone and other goddesses of the Mediterranean area, and wonders whether the personage hidden beneath the epithet of the tablet from Thurii might be Kore, daughter of Cybele, according to the view expressed in the chorus of Euripides’ Helen (v. 1301–1365), or some kind of identi\u0002 cation of the latter, who is no doubt Persephone, with the Anatolian goddess. He postulates that there is a single religious system behind the Cybele of the Sards, the Orphic Baubo, the divinity of the Thurian tablet, the mask of a Locrian idol, and the protomoi from throughout the Mediterranean, as well as behind the faceless (\u0015\u0016\b\u0007\u0004+\u0016\u0005\u0014) goddess of Cyrene. This is deduced from the funerary value acquired by the “lap”, or the earth, into which man sinks, according to a ritual whose model is handed down to us, albeit in sketchy form, by the verse from the Thurian tablets in which the initiate asks to plunge into the sovereign’s lap (cf.

It must be speci\u0002 ed that the word that appears is not Bacchus, but \u001d\u0002\f\u0003\u0005\u0014, the epiclesis of the god of the \u001d\u0002\f\u0005\u0003, or ecstatic adorers, a situation one achieves through personal initiation.42 The deceased, one of Bacchus’ faithful, is himself a \u001d\u0002\f\u0005\u001443 (cf. L 1, 16), whereas the god, in turn, is \u001d\u0002\f\u0003\u0005\u0014 like his worshipper.44 An interesting parallel45 is the Dionysus \u001d\u0002\f\u0003\u0005\u0014 of Olbia, cited by Herodotus as the god into whose cult the Scythian king Scylas46 was initiated, which is connected with the eschatology of the bone tablets found in the same city and dated to a very proximate period: the bone tablets also associate the Orphics with Dionysus, whose name appears several times in abbreviated form.47 The text from Pelinna has the same characteristics: Dionysus is present under the name \u001d\u0002\f\u0003\u0005\u0014, but is also symbolized in the ivy form of the tablets, and closely related to the statue of a maenad found outside the sarcophagus (cf. another \u0002 gure of a maenad in App. II n. 7).The myth of the Orphic Dionysus can be reconstructed from the fragments of the Orphic theogonies, especially the Rhapsodies,48 in the terms we have set out in § 1.6. Since human beings issue forth from the ashes of the Titans, united with the earth, we have within us residues of the Titanic nature, but also of the Dionysiac nature, since the Titans had eaten the \u0003 esh of the god. Consequently, Bacchus, the very victim of the Titanic crime, is the only one who can liberate the human race from the guilt of their ancestors. This is why the tablets from Pelinna say explicitly:41 Dionysus is also meant in L 16n “I am a limpid one, consecrated to Dionysus Bacchus” and .\u001d\u0002\f\u0005\u000e can be read in the lacuna of L 13a, 1.42 Graf (1985) 285 ff.

This is the same situation alluded to in a Pindaric fragment (133 Maehl.), in which49 we are told ofthe souls of those from whom Persephone accepts compensation for their ancient sorrow.50The role played by the god in the liberation and de\u0002 nitive absolution of the soul is therefore fundamental; not for nothing is 1\u000e\u0004\t\u0019\u0014 ‘Libera-tor’ one of Dionysus’ epithets, a liberation that cannot mean only the liberation of the soul from the body, for then we could not understand the role of Dionysus and the relevance this fact has for Persephone. The absolution of Dionysus, the victim of the Titanic crime, is indis-pensable for obtaining the forgiveness of the god’s mother, the queen of the underworld.51Hence the puri\u0002 catory function of the Bacchic mysteries can be deduced. Before the discovery of the tablets from Pelinna, it was believed52 that liberation on the part of Dionysus was obtained thanks to initiation into the mysteries during life, without the god intervening once the initiate had died. There was no evidence for Dionysus leading his initiates in the Beyond, as he had led them in this world. Despite his partially chthonic character, his function with regard to the μ\u0019\u0004\u001a\u000b\u0003 \u0002\u000b\u0010 \u001d\u0002\f\u0005\u0003 concluded as soon as they were laid down in their tombs. That is, the initiate would already have done what was most dif\u0002 cult, and all that remained for him was the ultramundane passage, carrying his tablet like a reminder. Nevertheless, as result of the new discover-ies, we can af\u0002 rm53 that in the beliefs re\u0003 ected by the Pelinna tablet, Dionysus ful\u0002 lls a puri\u0002 catory function in a personal and eschatological sense: he assists the initiate at the junction of the limit between life and death, between the human and the divine. Liberation after death is a consequence of initiation in the mysteries, carried out during life.49 Cf. Cannatà Fera (1990) 94 f. (as in n. 65; commentary on pp. 219–231).50 Cf.

But Hades is the same as Dionysus, for whom they go mad and hold bacchanals,or in Herodotus’ story of the initiation of the Scythian king Scylas into the Dionysiac-Orphic mysteries of Olbia (Hdt. 4, 79), or the reference to the gold amphora, a present of Dionysus, in which the bones of Achil-les and Patroclus (Il. 24, 73 ff.) are mixed, or the episode of a poem of Stesichorus, in which Dionysus offers an amphora to Thetis when she receives him under the sea, and she, in turn, gives it to Achilles, so that his bones may rest there after his death (Stesich. PMG 234 Page).The importance of Dionysus the Liberator appears in other testi-monies.55 In addition to the Orphic hymns where he receives the same epithet,56 we may cite a text from Pausanias (2, 2, 6), which tells us that two wooden statues of Dionysus were exhibited in the agora of Corinth, one with the epithet of Lysios ‘liberator’, another that of Bac-cheios.57 In Sicyon, too, the statues of Dionysus Baccheios and Dionysus the Liberator were carried to the sanctuary in a nocturnal procession.58 It is clear that Bacchic liberation was associated in funerary ritual with liberation through death: the \u0002 rst one often constitutes the indispensable preamble for the second.In the fragments of the Theogonies, we \u0002 nd references to this same liberation. Here, Proclus tells us:59Taking the soul to the happy life, after the wanderings around the world of becoming, which those who in Orpheus are initiated into Dionysus and Kore, pray to obtain (OF 348)“liberation from the cycle and a respite from disgrace”.54 Heraclit. fr. 50 Marcovich (= B 15 D.-K.). 55 Cf.

And Orpheus says (OF 350):“men send perfect hecatombsin any season throughout the whole year, and they carry outrites, striving for the realization of their impiousancestors. But you,62 possessor of power over them, will freewhom you choose from the hard sufferings of the eternal goad of passion”.We can reconstitute the religious context of the tablets by seeing how a salvi\u0002 c function is attributed to a divine mother-son couple, typical of the pre-Olympian conception of the Aegean-Anatolian world. It has been pointed out63 that the association between the mystery god and the subterranean goddess, who is the mother of Dionysus in the Cretan tradition, evokes the existence of an archaic religious model that could reinforce the hypothesis of a Cretan origin of Dionysism: the original link between Dionysus and Persephone and with the chthonic world might have arisen as a result of the literary tradition in which Semele and Ariadne, mortals, mother and wife of the god in his terrestrial vicissitudes, obtain from him the prize of immortality. The mystical role of the two numina places the Cretan Dionysus in relation with the Orphic Dionysus: the Orphic Dionysus was also born of Persephone, with whom Zeus unites in the form of a serpent. In any case, we can-not go into detail here on the complicated question of the origins of the Orphic Bacchus and his presence in various cultural contexts.64 We have tried to pro\u0002 le his mythic story in Orphic contexts, and \u0002 x his 60 Damasc. in Phaed. 1, 11 (35 Westerink).61 Drexler (1894–1897) 2210 de\u0002 nes him as a divinity that liberates from torments and endless misfortunes.62 The reference is obviously to Dionysus.63 Tortorelli Ghidini (1995a) 80 ff.64 Burkert (1975) 91 claims the af\u0002 nity of the Orphic story with Egyptian parallels. The identi\u0002 cation of Dionysus with Osiris was obvious for Herodotus (Hdt. 2, 132 ff.), and probably also for Hecataeus. According to Murray (19112) 342 ff., the clearest common element is the myth of laceration. The Egyptian parallels have been studied by Casadio (1996) and Bernabé (1996b), (1998a) 36 ff. Moreover, several passages from Sophocles’ Antigone (1119 f., 1150 f.) demonstrate the presence of Bacchus in Eleusis already in the mid-5th century B.C. (cf. Musti [1984] 65 ff.).BERNABE_f4_60-94.indd 7411/7/2007 9:52:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" ritual for the dead: tablets from pelinna (L 7AB) 75role in the tablets. Here, Bacchus is situated midway between the world of the living and that of the dead, because initiation in the mysteries carried out during life obtains its recompense after death, with libera-tion from the painful cycle of reincarnations.Finally, it is appropriate to ask ourselves about two aspects of Diony-sus’ “liberation”: from what does he liberate, and to what does liberation lead, that is, what new situation does the liberated soul achieve?The mention of liberation in the moment in which it is stated that the deceased has died and, at the same time, been born, suggests, as we have seen, that what the soul has achieved is liberation from its corporeal bonds, the de\u0002 nitive abandonment of the corporeal prison, in which it had been incarcerated because of the misdeed committed by the Titans.No doubt the liberation granted to the deceased by Dionysus-Bacchus requires \u0002 rst of all initiation, and second it is necessary that one lead a life that is subject to speci\u0002 c norms of purity (cf. the initial declaration of tablets L 9–11), and, \u0002 nally, that one submit oneself to the god’s judgment. It might be thought that Bacchus’ liberation would refer to misdeeds committed during life. However, the majority of authors65 prefer to see here a reference to liberation from the crime committed by the Titans,66 which, moreover, is congruent with other mentions in the tablets, where the soul declaresI have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious acts (L 10, 4),or admits having been subjugated by the Moira, or by him who wounds from the stars with the lightning-bolt (L 9, 4; 10, 5), having left the pain-ful cycle (L 9, 5) and arrived as a suppliant before Persephone (10, 5). However, the longest of the tablets from Pelinna ends with a verse that is rather signi\u0002 cant in this regard:And you will go under the earth, once you have accomplished the same rites as the other happy ones.The answer to the question of whether the mysteries had the soul’s liberation as their goal is found within the tablet itself: once the rites 65 Cf. Ricciardelli (1992) 30 f., Graf (1993) 243 ff.66 Cf. the fragment of Pindar (133 Maehl.) cited previously (p. 72).BERNABE_f4_60-94.indd 7511/7/2007 9:52:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76 chapter twothat others have already accomplished have been completed, the initiate will be reunited with them. We shall return to this theme in § 2.6.Plato uses this same mystery terminology, applying it to philosophi-cal concepts. He recommends the puri\u0002 cation of the body during life, in order to obtain wisdom at the moment of death, that is, when the divinity frees us from the bonds of the body (Phd. 67a); he insists on the idea that the ultimate puri\u0002 cation (\u0002\u001d\u001e\u000b\b\u0004\u0003\u0014) is the separation and liberation of the soul from the body; and he intimately links liberation (\u001c\u0019\u0004\u0003\u0014) not only with death (Phd. 67d), but also with philosophy (Phd. 82d). In this last detail, we can easily appreciate how Plato takes concepts from Orphic doctrines and re-elaborates them in agreement with his own theories, equating philosophical with mystery initiation.In short, the role of Dionysus and the relevance this fact has for Perse-phone give us the key for interpreting the expression we are analyzing: the soul has succeeded in liberating itself from its Titanic crime, the primordial guilt for which it has had to go through its sojourn in the mortal world. This expiation presupposes the soul’s liberation from its corporeal bonds. This trial is surmounted by means of initiation, rites of puri\u0002 cation, and the way of life to which the initiates are subject during their earthly existence. And it is the god Bacchus, Dionysus Lysios, the victim of the crime himself, who must ultimately approve this liberation.2.4. The formulas of the animal fallen in the milkAfter the announcement of the soul’s liberation by Dionysus, three phrases appear in the tablets from Pelinna (L 7a, 3–5):A bull, you leapt into the milk.Swift, you leapt into the milk.A ram, you fell into the milk,which present a great similarity with others that were already known previously, in the tablets from Thurii:L 8, 4 A kid, you fell into the milk.L 9, 9 A kid, I fell into the milk.In none of the variants does the formula appear forming part of hex-ameters.

A \u0002 rst way of approach to the problem was to think that the expression had its own meaning, and that it alluded to a concrete ritual in which milk played a part. Three variants have been suggested along these lines:a) According to the \u0002 rst one,70 this would be an allusion to a rite in the Orphic religion consisting in the immersion (or aspersion) of the initiate in milk, so that, given the expense supposed by a bath in milk, it was thought that milk could be substituted by water, either alone or mixed with some substance that would give it that appearance (the substitution of elements of the ritual is attested in antiquity). The problem71 is that there is no documentation of any such practice.b) Other authors72 have preferred to relate the reference to the kid fallen into the milk to an Oriental ritual of the sacri\u0002 ce of a nanny goat, which was then cooked in the milk, described in a mythologico-ritual text from Ugarit in a ceremony of initiation and expressly 67 On the phonic sequences, cf. Watkins (1995) 278 f. According to Riedweg (2002) 164, the formulas appear to be hymnic acclamations, which might be part of a ritual con\u0002 rmation.68 Ricciardelli (1992) 31 ff., Graf (1991) 94 f.69 Burkert (1975) 99 f.70 Maintained by Reinach (1901) 204 ff. and Pichon (1910) 60.71 As is admitted by Reinach himself (1901) 211.72 Reinach (1901) 211 f., Wieten (1915) 44 and 149 n. 2, Cook (1914) 676 ff., Burkert (1975) 99 f.

Thus, Apuleius74 describes for us a procession of Isis (also a specialization of Mother Earth), one of whose participantscarried a glass of gold molded in the form of a nipple, with which he made libations of milk.The philosopher Sallustius75 informs us that food consisting of milk was also known in the mysteries of Attis:after this, feeding by milk like the newborn, which is followed by mani-festations of joy, crowns, and something similar to an ascent towards the gods.A “milk-carrier” (#\u000b\u001c\u000b\u0002\u001a\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0005\u0014) is mentioned in Thessalonica.76 Even the Maenads suckled the young of wild animals.77 In the famous fresco of the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompei, in a clearly mystical context, a panisca appears offering her breast to a fawn (cf. App. II n. 10).Thus we read in some 2\u0016+\u0003&\u000b', written on lead leaves, dated to dif-ferent times and found in several places, sentences such as “at milking time”, “he drives the goat from Persephone’s garden by necessity”, and “for suckling from the endless spring of \u0003 owering milk.”78 There are many symbols in these 2\u0016+\u0003&\u000b' very similar to those referred to in the gold tablets. They have been found, furthermore, in the same areas (Magna Graecia and Crete) in which the gold tablets were found.Milk is an extremely important element in the ritual of Dionysus: when the Bacchants struck the rocks and earth, springs of wine and 73 The one called \u0002\u0003r and \u0002lm, cf.

App. II n. 11).2. A second line of investigation81 prefers to start from the assump-tion that in this text, #\u001d\u001c\u000b signi\u0002 es “the Milky Way”. According to this proposal, the deceased would return to the \u0002 elds of milk of the happy life, that is, the Milky Way, seat of the blessed. This would associate this expression with the following declarations:L 1, 10 etc. I am the son of Earth and starry Heaven.L 4, 9 My name is Asterius.And it would lead to interpreting the mention of the kid and the bull as related to the zodiacal signs of Aries and Taurus.

Likewise, in L 8, 2 one reaches the path on the right that leads to the meadows of Persephone when one leaves behind the light of the sun, that is, when one enters into Hades. The gods mentioned are all subterranean, while the heavenly indications (the declaration that one is a son of Earth and of starry Heaven, the name Asterius) refer to the divine race to which the initiate declares himself to belong, which does not prejudge his \u0002 nal destiny.3. Another analytical approach interprets the phrase as a proverbial expression for manifesting the satisfaction produced by the ful\u0002 llment of an ardent desire,85 as in the expression “like a \u0002 sh in water”,86 which passed into mystical language, where it assumed the dignity and esoteric meaning of a religious formula. The problem is that this kind of phrase would be applicable to a young ram, as in the examples from Thurii, conquering death: without the milk of Hera, the source of the Milky Way, none of the sons of Zeus could aspire to the honor of the heavens (cf. Pellizer [1989] 280). 83 Giangrande (1991b) 87 ff., Diels-Kranz (1903) I 224, and Index, s. vv. #\u001d\u001c\u000b and #\u000b\u001c\u000b4'\u000b\u0014.84 This argumentation is valid, even if one accepts the variant “and they await you beneath the earth” (cf. n. 6).85 Nilsson (19612) 236 thinks we have to do with an expression proper to the popular speech of herdsmen, but Zuntz (1971) 326 f. argues that those who erected the great tumuli at Thurii could not have been herdsmen, and defends the view that it is some kind of proverb.86 Zuntz (1971) 326 cites such Greek examples as “like rain for a frog”, among others.BERNABE_f4_60-94.indd 8011/7/2007 9:52:39 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" ritual for the dead: tablets from pelinna (L 7AB) 81but less probably to a bull or a ram, adult animals that are mentioned in the tablet from Pelinna.87 In spite of everything, an attempt has been made to save the hypothesis by thinking that the expression from Thurii is the original one.88 The truth is that it is hard to think that a trivial phrase like “like a \u0002 sh in water” could be adequate in a ritual context in which an attempt is being made to enunciate a profound experience on the part of the initiate at the moment of his death.4. We must, therefore, seek for explanations for the enigmatic phrase in the context in which it is enunciated, and in the sphere of the beliefs that we are studying. Thus, we see that the formula, in any one of its variants, is always expressed after a reference to a rebirth as a god after death:L 7, 1–2 You have just died and have just been born, thrice happy, on this day. Tell Persephone that Bacchus himself has liberated you.L 8, 4 You have been born a god, from the man that you were.L 9, 8 Happy and fortunate one, you will be a god, from the mortal that you were.Whatever interpretation we are to give this phrase must therefore move between the coordinates of rebirth and identi\u0002 cation with a god, both of which conditions produce a great happiness, all of this without leaving the framework of Hades.a) Associated with the idea of rebirth are the suggestions89 that consider that the kid, as a symbol of purity90 and innocence, like the agnus for the ancient Christians, represents the initiate, who, at death, would be reborn like a nursling kid.

A passage from Apol-lodorus can also be adduced, in which it is told how Dionysus was metamorphosed into a kid in order to shield him from the wrath of Hera.96As far as the relation of Dionysus and the bull in cult and poetry is concerned, it is well attested. Thus, for instance, in Euripides’ Bacchants he is called “the god with the bull’s horns”, and it is as a bull that Pentheus sees him in his hallucination and that the chorus acclaims 92 h.

The quali\u0002 cation of \t%&\u000b'μ+\u000f ‘happy’ is frequent for persons, but not for things or abstractions; however, it is not rare in the Dio-nysiac sphere.105 Its use in this context can be understood as a kind of enallage, as when we say “a happy event”, when what is happy is not the event, but those who participate in it.106In the Gurôb Papyrus there is an explicit mention of the fact that the initiate drinks to ease his thirst during the \u001a\t\u001c\t\u001aA, and wine is even mentioned,107 also in a context of liberation in which Dionysus appears as a savior god.As far as ‘privilege’ is concerned, it translates \u001a\u0003μA, a word we also \u0002 nd referring to the privileges of a deceased person who receives special treatment in the Beyond in a funerary epigram (Carm.

One of the most signi\u0002 cant texts in this regard is a pas-sage from Demosthenes (De cor. 259) in which Aeschines is presented as participating as an auxiliary in initiatory rites, who has wine-mixing as one of his functions. In a sense, drinking wine entails drinking the god: thus, Cicero (Nat. deor. 3, 41) does not consider it an exaggeration that some should believe they were drinking the god when they brought the cup to their lips, given that the wine was called Liber. Among \u0002 gurative representations, we may cite an Italic vase in which Dionysus is carry-ing out a miracle: without human intervention, the wine pours from the grapes to the cups.112 A woman, probably an initiate, approaches from the right to collect the wine in a large crater. A mortal appears on the other side. Schmidt believes they are beings destined for bless-edness, since participation in the mysteries of Dionysus includes a quasi-paradisiacal state already on earth.113 Another representation that deserves to be mentioned in this context is a relief from the Farnesina in Rome, in which wine plays an eschatological and mystical role. The 109 Graf (1991) 92.110 The expression \u000f\u0017\u0002\u001a\u000b\b (\f\t\u0003\u000f designates a wine-waiter in a funerary epigram from the Imperial period (cf. Cole [1984] 39).111 Cf.

Basically, pure wine was used in funerary libations, as opposed to that, always mixed, which was used in banquets (a symbol of civilization, as opposed to the pure wine drunk by the barbarians). The bones of incinerated bodies were washed with wine; wine was present at the funerary banquets, and an amphora with its bottom \u0002 lled with holes often \u0002 gured next to graves.117 Libations of mixed wine, which were most customary, presuppose a relation with the here and now, whereas neat wine appears in marginal contexts, especially when contact with the Beyond and the dead are sought.118There are literary testimonies of Bacchic rituals carried out next to the tomb of deceased persons belonging to various groups. In addition, grapes, wine, drums, including thyrsi or satyrs are painted on Apulian funerary vases,119 as if mourning and ecstasy were somehow fused together.120 The idea of life is associated with neat wine: wine is an elixir of life,121 or wine itself, on the words of Trimalchio: vita vinum est,122 114 Cited by Graf (1991) 100, who considers that the texts engraved on the tablets were also used in an initiatory ritual that staged death and resurrection, which was fol-lowed by the makarismos with vital instructions and the promise of future blessedness.115 Velasco López (1992) 215.116 Tsantsanoglou-Parássoglou (1987) 14, Graf (1991) 99 ff., (1993) 247 ff., Riedweg (1998) 373 f.117 Onians (19542) 282 ff. and 296ff.118 Cf.

For instance, the emphasis placed in the tablets on the temporal expressions “now”, and “on this day”.128However, alongside the testimonies that relate wine to initiatory rites or, in any case, to practices of life, or to funerary rituals, we also have others that show that this wine that the initiate has already enjoyed in life, is that which he hopes to enjoy in the Beyond. A crown and a state of eternal intoxication were the rewards promised to Orphic and Dionysiac initiates in a famous Platonic passage in which the philosopher mocks the image of the paradise promised by Musaeus and his son:129are frequent. According to Onians (19542) 217 ff., wine is identi\u0002 ed with life on the basis of the relation between man and plants: this liquid would be for the human being what sap is for vegetables, and this is why, dying of thirst, he needs a liquid that contains life and strength. Likewise, he relates this theme to the thirst of the dead, but as was rightly noted by Segal (1990) 413, the initiate always drinks water, never wine, even in the tablet from Hipponion where the initiates are informed of their quality as \u001d\u0002\f\u0005\u0003.123 Onians (19542) 478 ff.124 Xenarch. fr. 5.125 Il. 6, 526 ff. “we shall raise the free (2\u001c\t\u0019\u001e\t\b\u0005\u000f) cup in the palace”.126 1\u000e\u0004\t\u0019\u0014: Orph.

At the culmination of his ecstasy, the initiate obtains the desired prize.128 Ricciardelli (1992) 28, Graf (1991) 97 ff., (1993) 247 ff., Riedweg (1998) 373 f.129 Plat. Resp. 363cd, cf. Plut. Comp.

[. . .] On the other hand, the impious and the unjust they plunge into a kind of mud in Hades, or force them to carry water in a sieve.Other passages illustrate the delights of the Beyond like a banquet in which wine cannot be lacking at the heroes’ table: for instance, Aristo-phanes alludes at Frogs 85 to the “feast of the happy” in the other world, and a fragment speaks of the need to go down soon to Hades to drink, because that is why those who are there are called happy. Pherecrates tells how in the Beyond, young maidens offer cups \u0002 lled with wine. And an epigram from Smyrna describes the fate of the deceased:and next to the tripods and the immortal tables, while I enjoy the banquet,the gods look upon me as their friend.130Passages like this have led Pugliese Carratelli131 to consider that Orphism, which had originally been a purely mystical theology, became debased by a materialist vision diffused subsequently, and despised by Plato. Yet the situation could be precisely the opposite: that the more ancient view was precisely that somewhat crude one, and that the mystical theology was a later elaboration to which such authors as Pindar, Plato, and the 4th-century interpreters in general will not have been foreign.Whatever interpretation we give the phrase must be integrated within the general context: the celebration of achieved blessedness. Bacchus has liberated the initiate who is now already thrice fortunate (an expression echoed by the “happy” of the \u0002 nal formula), ready to arrive before Persephone, and to go beneath the earth with the other happy ones. The two verses of the beginning and the two at the end (one in L 7b) refer, then, to the initiate’s happiness, and they frame the central formulas of the bull and the kid that fall into the milk. Note the contrast between the two liquids, milk and wine, and the temporal difference between past (milk) and present (wine).

The use of the present tense, and the references to the now and the present day, together with the very presence of the text in a grave, authorize us to think that libations were made to the dead person at the moment of burial. However, it is also clear that wine appears as the \u0002 nest of the excellent things the initiate would enjoy in the Beyond, as an essential component of post-mortem happiness. This association of wine with eternal happiness could be forged thanks to the pleasant connotations the drink had for initiates from the ritual activities carried out during life.In sum, it appears that the various hypotheses proposed for our phrase (an echo of ritual practices, a reference to a libation in funeral ceremonies, an expression of post-mortem happiness) not only are not mutually exclusive, but may be complementary.133 Even the text’s curi-ous structure can be adequately explained in this way. In this sense, Riedweg has made an extremely likely suggestion:134 verses 2 and 7, the only correct hexameters, are the only ones that deal with the soul’s path to the underworld and its destiny there, and as such hexameters, they may derive from a more extensive poem.135 Verse 1, which is an altered hexameter, and 6, which is part of another, are completely centered on the funerary ritual next to the tomb, and we can perceive in them the re\u0003 ection of a libation of wine or the offering of a recipi-ent of wine. In lines 3 to 5, which are in rhythmic prose, our atten-tion is directed towards the ritual past of initiation, in which they were certainly inserted.136132 Riedweg (1998).

This leads us to the second textual problem, in which we have preferred to read \u001a\t\u001c\u0017\u0004\u000b\u0014 L\u0016\t\b138 instead of \u001a\t\u001c\u0017\u000b L\u0004(\u0004)\u000b\u0016\t\b,139 understanding \u001a\t\u001c\u0017\u000b as ‘prizes’ or ‘honors’.

Those who are charged with carrying out these rituals, obviously the same as those whom other sources call “Orpheotelests”, depend on the holiness of the written word; in other words, it is the possession and control of Orphic writings that confers on them their authority (cf. App. II n. 1).We are also told that initiations could be applied to individuals and to entire cities,147 which implies that their value was recognized and was not exclusive to one sect: the seers and reciters of oracles were specialists that could be hired by whoever needed them. The practices of the Orpheotelests were not secret, and to Plato they seemed to be a game, and therefore contemptible for a serious person.We must interpret the expression “both in life and once we are dead”, in the sense that that these rites claimed to project their valid-ity to the Beyond.144 2\u001a\u0017\u001c\t\u0004\u000b\u000f can be supplied if one reads \u001a\t\u001c\u0017\u0004\u000b\u0014, because it is the same verb that has already been expressed.145 Cf.

Another testimony, likewise Platonic, also tends in the same direction:149“In Hades, however, we will pay the penalty for whatever crimes we may have committed here, either we ourselves, or else the sons of our sons”. “But my friend”, he will say in a calculating way, “also very great is the power of the initiations and of the liberating gods, as it said by the most important cities and the sons of gods who have become poets and prophets of the gods, who attest for us to the reality of these facts”.“The sons of gods who have become poets and prophets of the gods” are obviously Orpheus, Musaeus, and other poets like them. Plato seems to imply that these poets and their followers (the Orpheotelests) promise liberation from the punishments of Hades without any other prerequisite than the celebration of speci\u0002 c practices.The de\u0002 nition of \u001a\t\u001c\t\u001aA as a religious act, the promise of a better fate after death, and the differentiation between initiates and non-initiates are also characteristic of the mysteries of Dionysus. We have literary testimonies beginning with the 4th century B.C. that attest the realization of Bacchic \u001a\t\u001c\t\u001a\u000b' and other kinds of initiatory ceremonies carried out by small organizations of a local or familial character.150 Plato (Leg. 815b–d) mentions Bacchic dances associated with \u001a\t\u001c\t\u001a\u000b' and \u0002\u000b\u001e\u000b\bμ\u0005', unconnected with the polis (\u0005%\u0002 (\u0004\u001a\u0003 \u0016\u0005\u001c\u0003\u001a\u0003\u0002\u0007\u000f).

This passage is generally attributed to the rites of Sabazius, but Harpocration tells us that the same crowns of white poplar that, according to Demosthenes, the initiates wore the day after the ceremony, were worn by those who were initiated into the Bacchic rites. In any case, the passage shows that speci\u0002 c initiatory ceremonies depended on written texts, and that, by their means, the participants were helped to \u0003 ee from unhappiness and \u0002 nd something better. The texts of the tablets point in the same direction, where the choice between something better and something worse is inherent in the instructions from Hipponion (“do not approach that fountain, [. . .] further on you will \u0002 nd . . . water”), and the expressions from Thurii “I \u0003 ew forth from the painful cycle of deep sorrow, I launched myself with agile feet for the longed-for crown”, and from Pelinna “tell Persephone that Bacchus has liberated you [. . .] you have wine, a happy privilege”. Plutarch consoles his wife for the loss of her young daughter with the hope that Bacchic initiations have taught her not to fear death (Plut. Cons. ad Ux. 10 p. 611D–E).151 A series of Dionysiac \u001a\t\u001c\t\u001a\u000b' are engraved upon epitaphs,152 the idea being that the ceremony marks the difference between his followers and the others after death. Archaeological data indicate that such beliefs were already current in the 4th century B.C. Many of the vases found in graves of Apulia, Campania or Lucania are decorated with Dionysiac themes, and exhibit speci\u0002 c characters connected with the later mysteries153 (cf. App. II nn. 5 and 6). Two terracotta maenads have also been found, one in the hand of a dead female154 (App. II n. 7), and the other next to the tablets from Pelinna. Without being aware of this last discovery, Cole conjectured that the deceased might perhaps have hoped to unite with his thiasos after death, a proposal corroborated by L 13a, 1 and the new readings of L 8, 2. Like the tablets, the maenad may have been a kind of reminder of the reward guaranteed by initiation. The new tablets from Pelinna are therefore an extremely important written document that con\u0002 rms the 151 Cf.

Unlike what occurs in the tablets from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia, and Pharsalus, the point is not only to give instructions to the deceased. The perspective opted from v. 3 on is external, as if the soul’s transit to Hades were seen from this world, and it were taken for granted that the initiate will have done what he should have done and achieved his objective.

The dif\u0002 cult reading of verse 2The beginning of the tablet is clear. Like those from the \u0002 rst group, this tablet begins with a reference to the situation, or the moment when the soul leaves the light of the sun, that is, when it abandons its body in its passage to Hades.On the other hand, verse 2 is unfortunately dif\u0002 cult to read. There seems to be a reference to the path towards the right, as in the tablets from the \u0002 rst group. There follows something illegible, and then the expression “keeping everything very well”, which seems to have the same meaning as the “hero who remembers” of the tablet from Entella (L 2), and as the “light to the intelligence” of the “Great” tablet from Thurii (L 12), that is, the deceased must remember what he learned in his initiation. Attempts to heal the verse have so far been in vain.1 It is therefore perhaps advisable to accept an ingenious suggestion, according to which between the incipit “Yet when the soul leaves the light of the soul behind” and the explicit “maintaining it all quite pres-ent”, the engraver will have implied the complete Hieros Logos in which the soul’s entire passage up to its arrival in the other world was related, and intentionally intercalated a pair of fragmented words and letters with more or less meaning, by way of \u0002 ller.2Another reading is however better:3 \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 \b)\t !\u000b\f\r<\u000e\u0007> \u0002\u0003\u000f {\u0004} <\r\u0010> )\u0011<\u0012>\u0007\f\u0005 ‘go to right thiasos’, ‘go to the thiasos that is on the right’ (i.e. the initiates’ thiasos). \u000b\f\r\u000e\t can be read now in L 13a, 2.

The great experienceThe narrator then refers to “the experience you never had before”. This is not just any experience, but, as indicated by the de\u0002 nite article, it is “the” experience.5 Taking the context into consideration (the reference to being converted into a god and the new mention of the mystical phrase of the kid fallen into the milk, which, as we have already seen, evoke rebirth and the happiness of the new of identi\u0002 cation with the god),6 the experience alluded to may be death or initiation, or better yet, as Burkert would have it,7 both at the same time.8 In making this af\u0002 rmation, he bases himself on an interesting text by Plutarch:9In this world [sc. the soul] has no knowledge, except when it reaches the moment of death. It then undergoes an experience like that of those who participate in the great initiations. This is why they resemble each other so much, both in word [sc. \u0014\u0003\u0018\u0003\u0019\u0014\u001a\u0007 ‘to die’ and \u0014\u0003\u0018\u0003\u000f\r\f\u0005 ‘to be initiated’) and in action. First there is a wandering without direction, the tiring turns and running about in the darkness with the suspicion that they are never going to end, and then, before one reaches the actual end, all the terrors, shudders, trembling, sweat, and confusion. From here, however, a wonderful light comes to greet him, and he is received by pure places and meadows, full of sounds, dances, and the solemnity of sacred words and sacred visions. Once he has had his \u0002 ll of this and has been initiated, he becomes free and walks as a free man. Crowned, 4 Cf. Sourvinou-Inwood (1995) 195 ff., where a good number of examples of this use may be found.5 Velasco López (1990–1991) 559 ff. points out that \u001b\u001c\u0015μ\f very cleverly includes the twofold meaning of the word: negative (death) and positive (true life). This is the same paradox as in verse 1 from Pelinna (L 7a and 7b), \u0007\u001d\u0007 \u001e\f\u0007\u0003\t \u001f\f! \u0007\u001d\u0007 \b\"\u0012\u0007\u000e\u0019, or in the bone tablets from Olbia, #\u000b\u000e\t, \u001c\u0007\f\u0014\u000e\t #\u000b\u000e\t (cf. § 1. 6).6 On this, cf. § 2. 4.7 Burkert (1975) 96.8 Comparetti (1910) 8 f. had already interpreted the phrase as a reference to the initiate’s transformation into a god. Delatte (1913) 127 f. believes that the experience is the voyage itself, and Alline (1912) 99 interprets it as drinking the water of Mnemosyne. Other suggestions may be found in Olivieri (1915) 17.9 Plut. Fr. 178 Sandbach. On this passage, cf. Burkert (1975) 96, Brillante (1987) 39, Díez de Velasco (1997) 413 ff., Riedweg (1998) 367 n. 33, Bernabé (2001) 10 ff.BERNABE_f5_95-98.indd 9710/31/2007 3:33:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98 chapter threehe celebrates the mysteries and in the company of holy and pure men, he sees from there the uninitiated, impure crowd of living beings, in the midst of the mud and the darkness, trampling and pushing one another, persisting in the fear of death and the union of the malevolent, for lack of faith in the good things that are there.The initiatory experience prepares us for death, and in death there is a repetition of what was experienced in initiation.

The meaning is practically identical.2 The adjective \u0002\u0005\u0004\u0005\u0006\t is a predicative referring to the subject, as was established by Zuntz (1971) 306 ff., and not to the goddess, as is the view of those who place the comma after the genitive: “I come from among the pure, pure queen of the subter-ranean beings”. Kotansky (1994) 109 points out that \u0002\u0005\u0004\u0005\u0006\t is appropriate for describ-ing those who have experienced ritual puri\u0002 cations, but not a goddess, who would be quali\u0002 ed as \"#\b$ or \"#\u001b\u0005.3 Cf. § 1. 14.4 As was proposed by Comparetti (1910) 40 for the feminine \u0005\u001f% of the tablet from Petelia (L 3) (cf. Zuntz [1971] 306). This interpretation would agree with the tablet from Thurii (L 8) in which the subject of discussion is the soul, and not the deceased.5 Unfortunately, we lack suf\u0002 cient archaeological information on the bodies found in the graves at Thurii. Cf. Bottini (1992) 38 ff. The skeletons on which the lamellae from Hipponion and Pelinna were found (L 1, L 7a and 7b) belonged to women, and it is likely that one of the Cretan texts was also on a female cadaver (L 5d), if we can judge by \u0004\u0010#\t\u0014%\u0006.BERNABE_f6_99-132.indd 9910/31/2007 9:27:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100 chapter fourL 9 Tablet from Thurii, 4th cent.

The introductory formulaThese tablets begin with a formula containing the exact words that are to be pronounced by the mystes, not in the presence of mere intermedi-aries, like the words he or she declared before the guardians in L 1–7, but before the very infernal divinities themselves in whose presence he or she has arrived: &\u0006!\u0003μ\u0005\u0015 is also the verb used in the tablet from Hipponion (L 1) to refer to the initiate who is to go by the sacred way of the mystes and bacchoi.We should ask ourselves the kind of purity to which the speaker is referring. We most probably have to do with a ritual purity that results from having experienced initiation (which seems to be an indispensable BERNABE_f6_99-132.indd 10010/31/2007 9:27:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" before persephone: more tablets from thurii (L 9–10AB) 101prerequisite) and having maintained a life that observes the precepts of this religious group, which renders the initiate deserving of a new life in the Beyond.6 It has been thought that \u0002\u0005\u0004\u0005\u0006'\u000e is synonym of ()\u0015\u0003\u000e,7 the name given by Plato8 to those who have deserved the eter-nal banquet in the Beyond. However, it has rightly been objected9 that whereas ()\u0015\u0003\u000e designates the state of mental and ritual purity required for the initiate to appear before the divinity, \u0002\u0005\u0004\u0005\u0006'\u000e denotes purity in a particular aspect, and from a concrete stain.10Despite this observation, we believe that in our case the use of the term is justi\u0002 ed, since the initiate refers to the fact that he has expi-ated a concrete penalty, the penalty for unjust acts, to which he refers in L 10, 4. According to what we know of the Orphics, expiatory puri\u0002 cation included the observance of a series of precepts,11 such as a vegetarian diet, abstinence from beans and eggs, and the prohibition of wearing wool, as well as a certain degree of sexual renunciation. It was probably also indispensable to participate in some ritual, although we are particularly poorly informed with regard to this aspect. Plato contrasts the “uninitiated” and “non-participants in the rites”, who are condemned to the mud once they have died, with the \u0002\u0011\u0002\u0005\u0004\u0005\u0006μ*\b\u0003\u000e ‘he who is puri\u0002 ed’,12 and \u0014\u0011\u0014\u0011\f\u0011)μ*\b\u0003\u000e ‘he who has participated in the rites’, who will dwell with the gods.13The use of the syntagma “pure among the pure”14 implies that the speaker de\u0002 nes himself/herself as belonging to a group characterized by solidarity and the maintenance of a similar ritual situation, but 6 Cf. Comparetti (1903) 168. 7 Olivieri (1915) 5. 8 Plat. Resp.

The meaning of the term evolves from “lacking any physical stain” (its inherent trait) to “free from blame”, and \u0002 nally “pure”, a process that occurs on the basis of semantic neutralization with \u0013\u0011\u0015\u0002$\u000e or, as a \u0002 nal stage, through metaphor.11 Cf.

In the \u0002 rst place, no doubt, to Persephone, since she is none other than the “queen of the subterranean beings”.17 Eucles and Eubouleus are the next ones addressed, and \u0002 nally, with a vague formula of politeness, the remaining gods. We must linger over Eucles and Eubouleus, since there has been discussion with regard to their identity.Eucles is not a name in the strict sense, but an epithet meaning ‘famous, of good reputation’. It is most probably a euphemistic designa-tion of Hades,18 similar to the other, more common one of /\f\u0012μ\u0011\b\u0003\u000e. In all probability, the same name is to be found in the Etruscan Evklúi.19 This interpretation is, moreover, adequate for the place occupied by the name in the text, immediately after the queen of the underworld.20As far as Eubouleus is concerned, it is also an epithet meaning ‘the good counselor’. In various texts it refers to Dionysus:21 thus, in line 2 of the tablet from Rome (L 11), we read:Eucles and Eubouleus, son of Zeus.It is also an epithet of Dionysus in various Orphic hymns:15 In the P.

It was also the denomination of a very important personage in Eleusinian spheres, a swineherd who witnessed the rape of Persephone and informed Demeter thereof, in return for which she taught him the cultivation of grain.2622 The personages to whom this term is applied in the Orphic hymns also include Adonis (56, 3), the father of Dionysus (42, 2) or of Tyche (Fortune, 72, 3), and others (41, 8, etc.), but none of them is acceptable in this context.23 Macrob.

For this reason as well, some authors prefer to see in the Thu-rian Eubouleus an epithet of Hades; but this would only be possible if we understand that Eucles and Eubouleus are two epithets of the same god, which is hard to believe. Schwarz,31 for his part, denies the identi\u0002 cation of Eubouleus with Hades, on the basis of the representa-tion of both \u0002 gures on the dedicatory relief of Lacretiades. From the viewpoint of cult, Pluto and Eubouleus are also separate, since one has a priest, and the other a priestess.32 For Schwarz, Eubouleus was originally the name of an underworld divinity in Eleusis, who now appears as a hero, alongside the chthonic divinities.In view of the data, it seems the most probable interpretation that Eubouleus is an epithet of Dionysus, so that we would have, in the tablets, an invocation of the “infernal trinity” of Persephone, Hades and Dionysus, none of them called by their name.

For Sfameni Gasparro (1986) 103, the Zeus of this triad is a personage of the type of the chthonic Zeus invoked in Hesiod (Op. 465 ff.) together with Demeter, fundamentally analogous to the Pluto or Clymenus who, in other Greek centers, includ-ing Eleusis, accompanies the two goddesses. That this \u0002 gure belongs speci\u0002 cally to a religious sphere in which a Demetriac character and agrarian and chthonic allusions are predominant can be deduced from the fact that this Zeus, now forming a couple with Demeter, is called Damatrios in an inscription from Rhodes (cf.

We should ask ourselves what impious actions are being referred to, and what punishment must be paid. The formulaic character of the expression encourages us to exclude the possibility that we are dealing with faults committed by the deceased during his lifetime, that is, with a particular blameworthy act.37 It is either a fault that goes back to a previous existence,38 or else it refers to a general, primordial fault, that was part of Orphic beliefs.34 Cf.

Zeus, angered, struck them with lightning, and the human race was generated from the ashes of the Titans. Mankind is thus born stained by guilt, that of murdering and devouring the god, yet, at the same time, it has community with the divine, since it derives from the Titans, who were gods, and from Dionysus, who was ingested by the gods. Given that in Orphic tradi-tion Dionysus is the son of Persephone, the “ancient sorrow” would be a mother’s pain over the death of her son. Human beings are thus obliged to expiate the guilt they inherit from the Titans, until they have paid their compensation.We \u0002 nd a similar conceptual universe in other Orphic texts.

Expiation of the penalty must be made through the soul’s enclosure in a body, which is thereby converted into a kind of prison or even a “tomb”, since human life is not genuine life, but a period of puri\u0002 cation and trials, until one achieves the genuine life that begins after death. In this sense, some very revealing texts may be compared:Indeed, some af\u0002 rm that the latter [sc. the body] is the tomb of the soul, as if it were buried in its current situation . . . However, it seems to me that Orpheus and his followers gave it this name above all because the soul, which pays the price for that for which the price must be paid, holds it in a kind of enclosure, like a prison, where it can see itself as safe and sound, and that, consequently, it is the “salvation” ()\u0007μ\u0005)42 of the soul, as is indicated by its very name.43 Well, what is stated in the secret writings on this point, that people are in a kind of custody and above all that we must not free ourselves from it or escape, seems to me to be something great and not easy to divine.44An interesting speci\u0002 cation is introduced in this last passage. Suicide as a means for freeing oneself from this life is prohibited. In the Orphic conception, whoever commits suicide is guilty of a fault similar to that of someone escaping from jail before serving his appointed sentence.It remains for us to cite a fragment by Aristotle:45By nature, we all \u0002 nd ourselves, as is said by those who recount initiations in the mysteries, subject to a kind of punishment, for the ancients say that it is divine to say that the soul is expiating a penalty, and that we are alive in order to be punished for certain grave misdeeds.In view of these texts, the most logical approach is to think that under the mention of impious actions there lies a reference to the dismem-berment of Dionysus at the hands of the Titans, the central myth of 42 Here, Plato no doubt expresses this word as if it were the action noun in -μ\u0005 of )9\u00158-.43 Plat.

Thus, it has been pointed out47 that this belief in mankind’s punishment, without any reference to original and terrestrial human guilt, implies dualistic presuppositions. In other words, the origin of the world and human existence are due to an inferior but superhuman agent, opposed to the divinity. Dualism presupposes an absolute gap, inherent in the very roots of human existence, which is therefore established in exis-tence by an “antecedent” sin. This sin is neither human nor terrestrial, and it is brought about either by the damage in\u0003 icted by a supreme entity or, conjointly, the egoistic intervention and sacrilegious pride of a demiurge.48 Alternatively, one may speak49 of an active guilt extending to all mankind, as a kind of “guilt of existence”.Be this as it may, we are obviously not dealing with a purely passive expiation. The soul did not recuperate its original situation simply through the passage of time. The \u0002 rst indispensable precondition for the soul’s salvation is initiation. Through it, the soul knows the sacred history through which it \u0002 nds itself in its current situation, and the way it should conduct itself is revealed to it. Highly signi\u0002 cant in this sense is one tablet from Pherai (L 13), in which the soul is invited to enter the meadows of Persephone “since the initiate is free of punish-ment”. Being a mystes is the conditio sine qua non for freeing oneself from the cycle of reincarnations. The non-initiate appears to suffer a double punishment. In the \u0002 rst place, he suffers pains in the beyond (we hear of being immersed in mud or of carrying water in a sieve),50 and, in 46 However, “sin” must be understood mutatis mutandis, since the reference in Orphic belief is to an original impurity that is rather physical, without the moral charge implied by the Christian term “sin”.47 Bianchi (1966) 119.48 For Bianchi (1966) 120 ff., the pre-existent nature of this guilt, and its insertion within a prologue in the sky or in a cosmic-ontological drama, justify the idea’s lack of precision, and there is no need to have recourse to any particular sin, such, for instance, as the dismemberment of Dionysus in the case of the tablets.49 Cosi (1987) 223 f., following the approach sketched by Burkert (1975) 95 with regard to a general guilt.50 Plat., Resp. 363d–e, Gorg. 493b, cf. also Resp. 364e.

Every dismemberment implies the spilling of blood, which, for Orphic dogma, was one of the great-est impurities.51 The myth of the sacri\u0002 ce of Dionysus becomes a kind of archetype of sacri\u0002 ce in general. This explains why the Orphics were vegetarians, and why they prohibited the spilling of blood, as an indispensable condition for maintaining purity. Similarly, other precepts had to be observed, such as abstaining from woolen clothing, among others.52 This is why some authors speak of “puritanism” in referring to the Orphics.In sum, the Orphic acceded to awareness of his soul by means of initiation, and then acted by celebrating a series of rites and observing various precepts in order to keep it pure. Once this had been accom-plished, and guilt had been expiated, the soul, returned to its original purity, could \u0002 nally escape the cycle of rebirths, free itself from gen-eration and death, and have access to that immutable and permanent form of existence that was proper to the gods.4.3.

Cf. for instance, fr. 107 Wright (= B 115 D.–K.) “when one, by the errors of his mind, contaminates his members and thereby violates the oath he swore—I mean demons who have been granted a long life—he must wander for times that are thrice uncountable, far from the Happy ones”. On the relations between Orphism and Empedocles, see Riedweg (1997 [= 1995]) and Megino (2005).52 Cf. § 4. 1.53 The scribe has erroneously repeated “and the other immortal gods” from verse 2 (cf. App. I).

Traditionally, Moira is the divine personi\u0002 cation of destiny and death. We \u0002 nd an expression parallel to that of the tablets in Homer; cf., for instance:Il. 18, 119: but fate subdued him, and the terrible wrath of Hera.The reference is to Heracles, for even he was unable to free himself from death. In the Odyssey, Odysseus speaks to Euryclea about the death of the suitors:Od. 22, 413: but fate subdued them, and their cruel acts.We note that in the Homeric passages as well, the expression for refer-ring to death is duplicated, from two points of view: a general one, “fate subdued them” (that is, the hour of death arrived for them), and another speci\u0002 c one, indicating the mediate or immediate cause (the wrath of Hera, who has sought Heracles’ downfall, or the acts of the suitors, which have provoked the vengeance of Odysseus).However, as is almost always the case, the Orphics adapt a tradi-tional phraseology to alter its meaning, forcing it to \u0002 t the context of their beliefs.Indeed, according to another Orphic text, the theogony of the Derveni Papyrus,54 Moira is a divine name that can be assigned to Zeus. The poet identi\u0002 es Zeus with Moira55 because the Moirai are divini-ties of fate, and for the Orphic poet as well, Zeus becomes the lord of destinies, as he governs the world and determines the course of events. Moira is the thought of Zeus, as Ocean is his power, the two characteristics that render him \u0002 t to carry out his role as ruler. The same identi\u0002 cation with Zeus can also be seen in the Orphic hymn dedicated to the Moirai:56For all that happens to us, Fate and the mind of Zeus know fully.Thus, we may consider that in whichever of the two forms it appears in the tablets (whether with a copulative or a disjunctive conjunction), the double reference to Moira and Zeus is a mere hendiadys, or two 54 P.

Various interpretations have been offered. According to one, which is nowadays utterly rejected, the passage should be placed in parallel with another one by Plato:60and there was thunder and an earthquake, and suddenly the souls were hurled from there—some to one side, some to another—upwards, like shooting stars, for their birth.According to this interpretation, Zeus projects the souls into space like sudden bolts of lightning or like shooting stars, the idea being that the souls pass through a kind of “celestial purgatory”. As we have seen, however, there is nothing in the tablets that alludes to the souls’ destiny, whether \u0002 nal or transitory, in the heavens. All that is mentioned is the souls’ passage from this world to Hades.61A second possibility is that the expression should be taken literally,62 that is, we are to believe that the men buried in the Timpone piccolo, all of whom were initiates, died from being struck by lightning. This would explain the peculiarities of the Timpone piccolo: three burials carried out at distinct times, and the traces of ashes and coal that testify to a burial 57 Il. 1, 580, 609; 7, 443; 12, 275; Hes.

In addition, the rather formulaic character of the expression in the tablets, which seems to be part of a stable tradition (which could therefore hardly be reserved for a phenomenon so extremely exceptional as being struck by lightning), points, in our opinion, rather in the direction of the expression of a mystical content.In the search for an interpretation along these lines, we \u0002 nd that Zeus’ thunderbolt appears in various mythic themes that are intimately related to the Orphics:a) First, we should recall that it was with the lightning that Zeus struck the Titans who had dismembered Dionysus,65 and that it was from their ashes that mankind was born. If there is an allusion to this episode, we would think that mankind, in solidarity with his ancestors the Titans, feels himself to be wounded by a thunderbolt at the moment of his passage to the other world: once he goes through the trial of the thunderbolt, he is liberated and puri\u0002 ed of his Titanic nature. Such an interpretation would also coincide with the expression uttered by the initiate in the previous verse of the two tablets from Thurii:L 10, 4 I have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious acts.There is, then, an ambiguity or ambivalence implicit in the concept of being struck by lightning,66 which may be understood as a divine 63 Musti (1984) 63 f. raises the possibility of a common burial for the members of an Orphic community.64 Burkert (1975) 103 f. even suggests that the personage buried in the tomb in which L 8 and L 12 appeared was the seer Lampon.65 Cf. § 1.6.66 Pointed out by Burkert (1975) 93 ff., who, without ruling out the possibility that we may be dealing with dead people who really were struck by lightning, thinks there is a reference here to the Titans. By this kind of compromise, he tries to transcend the rigid alternatives of previous interpretations, where the reference to the myth seemed incompatible with death by being struck by lightning. Burkert (1960–1961) 208 ff. had already observed the same ambiguity in the term +\b\u0011\f\u0012)\u0015\u0003\u000e ‘wounded by the thunderbolt’. Whoever is struck by lightning is not a normal dead person, but is invested with a special force, and enters into a superior existence, acquiring a heroic status, as is demonstrated by the cases of Asclepius or Capaneus. This special force is even attributed to the very places where the lightning strike took place, or to the BERNABE_f6_99-132.indd 11210/31/2007 9:27:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" before persephone: more tablets from thurii (L 9–10AB) 113punishment, as in the case of the Titans, or as a reward consisting in an elevation of rank, or even in apotheosis. The vicissitudes of the Titans,67 the founding myth of Orphic doctrine, ritualize the faithfuls’ being struck by lightning. Since mankind is conceived according to the anthropological dualism that considers the soul to be divine, but to have fallen into the body as a result of guilt, being struck by lightning reveals the doctrinal premises that justify the positive evaluation of a special death in which the body is immediately dissolved and negated by destructive \u0002 re.b) It has been objected, however,68 that an allusion to the Titans, who are a source of disgrace for mortals, would contrast with the mystic tone of the tablets, because it would not be logical for the initiate to evoke once again the terrestrial experience he wishes above all to forget. However, this objection is, in our view, invalid, since the initiate has just declared that he has paid the price, and has thereby liberated himself and is ritually pure upon his arrival in Hades. Moreover, the mention of Zeus as hurler of lightning would enable the thunderbolt of the tablets to be interpreted as an instrument and sign of the passage from a mortal state to another divine one. Relatively close examples would be the myth of Semele’s being struck by lightning,69 and the birth of Dionysus, tutelary numen of all kinds of μ\u0012%)\u0015\u000e, whether Orphic or not, and the guide for the initiates’ rebirth to a true and eternal life.70c) There are still further examples of episodes of death by being struck by lightning in relation to the Orphics: thus, we know of a secondary version of the death of Orpheus, in which he is burned to a cinder by Zeus’ thunderbolt,71 and another tale,72 according to which Zeus graves of those struck by lightning, like the pyre of Heracles or the tombs of Lycurgus or Euripides.

There are no data allowing us to ascertain that the protagonists belonged to Orphic circles, although the localization in Tarentum and Iapygia situates them in areas that are topographically close to such circles.d) For his part, Porphyry tells how Pythagoras himself, who came to Crete to be initiated, was puri\u0002 ed by the “lightning stone”.73e) We can also mention West’s observation concerning a curious design in the form of a zigzag that appears on the bone tablets of Olbia, which could, among other interpretations, represent a bolt of lightning.74f ) Finally, this expression has also been placed in relation with the episode narrated by Herodotus,75 according to which the house of the Scythian king Scylas, who was initiated into the mysteries of Bacchic Dionysus at Olbia, was struck by a thunderbolt.76We therefore consider that the expressionbut fate subdued me, and he that wounds from the stars with lightningalludes to the initiate’s death, conceived as a purifying passage symbol-ized by the thunderbolt, which evokes the fate of the Titans or Semele. Being struck by lightning allows him to be liberated from his last Titanic vestiges, in order to be re-united with the gods.

Two variants at the end: a) the supplication to PersephoneAt its end, tablet L 9 differs considerably from L 10a and b. In L 10, the soul declares itself to be a suppliant before Persephone, so that she may send it to the dwelling-place of the pure. In L 9, the deceased makes a few metaphorical references that are not easy to interpret, and ends with a makarismos similar to those we have already encountered. Let us \u0002 rst consider the simplest variant (L 10, 6 f.):Now I come as a suppliant before chaste Persephone,to see whether, benevolent, she may send me to the dwelling of the limpid ones.The soul of the deceased is practically at the end of its path: all that is missing is for Persephone to authorize it to join with other pure souls in a special, reserved place. The goddess is quali\u0002 ed as \"#\b$, an epithet we translate as ‘chaste’, but which includes a constellation of connotations that are impossible to re\u0003 ect in translation.In ancient epic, \"#\b$, frequently applied to goddesses, includes a notion of veneration and fear,77 as does the verb from the same root, D8\u0003μ\u0005\u0015. It indicates a negative respect felt in the presence of a god or a divine personage, which consists in avoiding or abstaining from something.78 In the Odyssey,79 we encounter \"#\b. :\u0011\u0006)\u0011E'\b\u0011\u0015\u0005, in a pas-sage clearly imbued with death, where the sovereign of Hades disperses the souls of the women. The epithet also reappears in an underworld context in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter.80In the tragedians, the word comes to be applied to a human being as “ritually pure, ful\u0002 lling the state required for a ceremony”. In the tablets, this nuance of the fear experienced by the μ\u0012)\u0014%\u000e in the pres-ence of Persephone can probably still be appreciated.81 In a fragment of Euripides’ Cretans,82 we \u0002 nd the phrase \"#\b@\b \u001aF \u000f\u001b\u0003\b \u0014\u0011\u001b\b\u0003μ\u0011\b ‘we lead a pure life’ as the synthesis of a form of life that corresponds 77 Cf.

For instance, Pausanias84 speaks of the sacred grove of Carnasius in Messenia, particularly full of cypresses and presided over by an image of Kore Hagne next to a fountain, in the place where the mysteries of the Great Goddesses are celebrated. The author regards them as second in rank after those of Eleusis as to their venerability. Eustathius85 associates puri\u0002 cation with liberation, precisely one of the key aspects of the goddess Persephone. The epithet is often found applied to the same goddess in epigraphical sources.86 Finally, the same appellative applied to the goddess87 reappears in hymns within ritual contexts or in sacred Orphic ceremonies, in reference to other personages related to the goddess of the infernal depths,88 including Demeter herself.89In the light of all these testimonies, we see that the Orphic poet has used a traditional epithet of the goddess, already Homeric, maintaining 83 Cf. Casadio (1990) 282.84 Paus. 4, 33, 4 ff.85 Eust. 1691, 47 “calls Persephone ‘pure’ because, given that the dead require puri\u0002 cation, the body is puri\u0002 ed by \u0002 re”.

The adjective now summarizes the values of the Orphic life: chastity and asceticism, as expressed in the fragment from the Cretenses. The mystes who presents himself as a suppliant before Persephone because he wishes to be accepted for his purity among the pure, addresses the goddess as pure herself. In addition, the role of Persephone in liberation is fundamental, and liberation and puri\u0002 cation cooperate in the Eustathius’ interpretation of \"#\b$. The mystes knows that the ultimate decision depends on Persephone, and trusts in her benevolence to be accepted into the dwelling of those who, like him, are initiates and have led a life of purity.4.5. b) The second variant: the cycle, the crown, and the lap of the goddessThe second variant is more complicated, for it alludes to various beliefs that con\u0002 gured a framework of references that the initiate knew, but we can only guess.Let us begin with the \u0002 rst of these cryptic phrases (L 9, 5):I \u0003 ew forth from the painful cycle of deep sorrow.The Greek word \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e (which we must translate by ‘cycle’) has vari-ous meanings, which do not contribute to clarifying its interpretation. It can mean ‘circle’ or ‘ring’ (that is, a geometrical \u0002 gure), with a wide variety of concrete uses, such as ‘cycle’ (a series of events that repeat themselves) or ‘wheel’. The interpretations of the meaning of this phrase have been multiple.An initial explanation is that \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e refers to a real circle,90 formed in an initiatory rite carried out during one’s life. It might be a wheel, or else a circle drawn around the neophyte, from which he had to escape.91 Such a hypothesis can neither be con\u0002 rmed nor denied. In any case, the partisans of this idea understand that another kind of “wheel” or “cycle” is represented symbolically in the rite, so that the suggestion does not contradict other interpretations.90 Harrison (19223) 588 ff., as could have been expected from a representative of the Cambridge ritualist school.

We \u0002 nd a similar af\u0002 rmation in Aristotle:It is customarily said that human affairs are a kind of circle . . . and it also appears that time itself is a kind of circle.94The expression “it is customarily said” indicates that such an idea was current in the Stagirite’s time. In the light of this principle, it can be supposed that the believer considers that his individual destiny is not clearly distinguished from the cosmic “circle”. Indeed, we \u0002 nd that in some Orphic texts the presence of Necessity (A\b\t#\u0002%) is mentioned at the very origins of the world, as a principle that surrounds and unites it, the companion of time (H\u0006'\b\u0003\u000e), conceived in its turn as a twisted (I\f\u0015\u0002\u0014'\u000e)95 serpent with wings. The world of births and deaths of mortals seems to be united and dominated by the “circle” of the heavens, identi\u0002 ed with the \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e 8-\u0015\u001a\u0015\u0005\u0002'\u000e, the solar ellipse, the \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e #\u0005\f\u0005,\u001b\u0005\u000e or \u0005J\u0004.\u0006 )E\u001b##-\b 5\u0011\u0006\u0016 \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\b D5\u0005\b\u0014\u0005 (Emped. fr. 28, 4 Wright [B 38, 4 D.–K.]). On the other hand, the ideal, eternal world to which the soul aspires is outside the “circle”, as Plato indicates in a tale that is not Orphic, but is inspired by its imagery:96The (souls) called immortal, once they reach the summit, heading outside, rise above the back of the heavens, and as they rise the circular move-ment carries them along.We \u0002 nd an image in Empedocles that is probably closer to what we have here. The philosopher also speaks of an eternal \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e of the conversion of the multiple into one and the one into the multiple.97 Speci\u0002 cally, fr. 47, 10 Wright (B 35, 10 D.–K.) mentions the ultimate 92 Cf.

This last example is interesting because, as we shall see, the ideal re\u0003 ected in the tablets is that of escaping from this world to move on to another better one.However, there are a few questions that are important for interpret-ing what \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e refers to. The \u0002 rst is that it is de\u0002 ned in an abso-lutely negative form, “painful” and “of deep sorrow”. It is signi\u0002 cant that Empedocles uses the same adjective \u0013\u0006#\u0005\f*\u0003\u000e with reference to human life in a fragment which mentions precisely a “Decree of Necessity”:98while he keeps alternating the painful directions of life.It is, then a painful cycle, and escaping from it presupposes a libera-tion and a triumph. Proclus, a great connoisseur of Orphism, speaks along the same lines:99Given that the human soul, alternating with the cycles of time, moves from one living being to the other.This is not the only testimony to the Orphic idea of a “cycle”. In other Orphic fragments and in the texts of the Neoplatonic philosophers who present them, we \u0002 nd the word \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e to refer to the cycle of the metempsychosis of the soul, because of which it must become incarnate again and again until, once its faults have been expiated, it can enjoy its sojourn alongside the other happy ones.Thus, for instance, Proclus, after af\u0002 rming thatThis is the soul’s only salvation, which liberates it from the cycle of generation and from long wanderings,he ends his explanation by presenting a verse from the Orphic Rhap-sodies, in the following terms:The happy (. . .) life, far from the roaming of generation, that is desired by those who, in Orpheus, are initiated in Dionysus and Kore: “To cease from the cycle and enjoy respite from disgrace”.100Simplicius also includes the same verse, with the following explanation: 98 Emped. fr. 187 Wright (= B 115 D.–K.), v. 8. 99 Procl. in R.

Thus, Diogenes Laertius reports a notice on Pythagoras:102They say he was the \u0002 rst to af\u0002 rm that the soul, following the changing cycle of necessity (\u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\b \u0013\b\t#\u0002%\u000e \u0013μ\u0011\u001b\u000f\u0003\u0010)\u0005\b), sometimes \u0002 nds itself united to one animal, and at other times to another.Scholars usually maintain that the idea gestated in a Pythagorean envi-ronment, and that this is where the Orphics took it.103 However, there is no proof for this af\u0002 rmation: it could have happened in the reverse way, or else both Orphics and Pythagoreans could have adapted a concept that was already known—albeit not widespread—in the Greek world.In addition, the use of the verb +,*5\u0014\u0005\b ‘I \u0003 ew forth’ in the tablet under examination recalls the metaphor of the soul as a bird that \u0003 ies forth from the body when it is freed from its prison, to which Plutarch refers in the work he wrote to consoles his wife over the death of their daughter.104 This is consistent with liberation from the circle of births.Yet we can be even more speci\u0002 c. The image contained in \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e can be more complex. Thus, some scholars105 have seen in it a metaphor for the well-known torture of the wheel. For the Orphics, on this view, the series of reincarnations is not seen merely as an abstract circle, but as a metaphor of the wheel of torture. Clement of Alexandria offers a highly interesting text:106By means of symbols, like the wheel that turns in the sanctuaries of the gods, taken from the Egyptians.101 Simpl. in Aristot.

In addi-tion, wheels formed part of the sacred furniture of certain sanctuaries, and on some vases from South Italy we even \u0002 nd wheels hanging next to the deceased who appears next to Orpheus.108We can conclude that by the expressionI \u0003 ew forth from the painful cycle of deep sorrow,the initiate manifests above all that his soul has abandoned the cycle of reincarnations in this world; that is, he has succeeded in liberat-ing himself from the mortal life to which he was condemned for the fault committed by his ancestors the Titans. The expression reveals or implies that the initiate conceives of life, or better, the succession of the lives through which the soul must pass, both as a cycle—within a cyclical conception of the universe,109 in whose process of becoming one series of events succeeds another in an ordered, necessary way—and as a wheel, understood as a repeated, terrible punishment, as terrible as the tomb we \u0002 nd as a metaphor for life in other allusions to the Orphics in Plato.110There follows the phrase:L 9, 6 I launched myself with agile feet after the longed-for crown.111Formally, we \u0002 nd traditional echoes in our verse,112 but in the context of the tablets, the expression, as always, acquires a new meaning.

On the basis of the fact that )\u0014*E\u0005\b\u0003\u000e can sometimes mean ‘a crown of forti\u0002 cations’,113 it was thought that it could be a kind of fence that protected the seat of the blessed,114 or the kingdom of Persephone.115 However, the local interpretation is ultimately hardly acceptable: \u0002 rst, because this value of “crown” is very occasional and unexpected in our context. Second, because the crown is quali\u0002 ed as “longed-for”, and one would have to understand it as a metonymy, in the sense that the deceased manifests a desire for the fence in order to refer to the desire for the happy place that is enclosed behind it. Above all, however, because there are no indications of an enclosed space in the meadows and groves of Perse-phone, but the loca beatorum are always imagined as being in regions that are remote and isolated, but not fenced in.116 For all these reasons, we can consider this interpretation as completely rejected.Another interpretation, likewise local, is also unacceptable. According to it, )\u0014*E\u0005\b\u0003\u000e should be given the meaning, also local, of ‘orbit’.117 On the basis of this interpretation, two moments are to be distinguished in the soul’s path towards liberation from the cycle. An initial moment is represented by the cycle of rebirths on earth, followed by a second one in which the soul is bound to a new cycle, this time astral, which means that the stars are the seat of the souls in this second moment. Only once the soul had also freed itself from this second cycle will it have concluded the path of puri\u0002 cation, and have open before it the +μ\u000f\u0005[\u0014\u0011\u0012)\u0005\b\u0014\u0011\u000e, denoting the physical act of entering the \u0013\b\t\u0002\u0014\u0003\u0006\u0003\b or the new status achieved by the initiate after a stage of his initiation.

For these interpretations, the same argument holds that we have already presented with regard to other interpretative proposals of the soul’s sojourn in the heavens:119 there is nothing in the tablets that indicates that the soul leaves the infernal world for a heavenly journey.120If we start out from the basis that )\u0014*E\u0005\b\u0003\u000e here has the meaning of ‘crown’, it will be best to orient our explanations towards the value that Greeks of the time attributed to crowns.121 Basically, we \u0002 nd crowns in relation to various realities: banquets, the funerary world, triumph in athletic competitions, certain rituals, and an ensemble of mystical symbols.Crowns are related to banquets because the participants in symposia had the custom of wearing crowns. For instance, we may cite a pas-sage from Xenophanes,122 in which the preparations for a banquet are described:Now the ground is clean, and the hands of all,and the cups: one dons woven crowns . . ., etc.Crowns were also used in funerary rituals. A couple of examples may suf\u0002 ce. In Euripides’ Phoenician women, Creon proclaims, with regard to the corpse of Polyneices (1632 f.):Whoever is caught trying to place a crown on this corpseor to cover it with earth, will pay for it by death.In Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, the protagonist offers a crown and a honey cake to the counselor, when suggesting that he die (600 ff.):118 Giangrande (1991b) 87 ff., salvaging an interpretation by Diels-Kranz (1903) I 224 and index, s. vv. #\t\f\u0005 and #\u0005\f\u0005,\u001b\u0005\u000e.119 Cf. § 2. 4.120 See also the interpretation by Onians (19542) 451, who tries to differentiate between \u0002\u0012\u0002\f\u0003\u000e, understood as the invisible “circle” of destiny from which the initi-ate has escaped, and )\u0014*E\u0005\b\u0003\u000e as the visible “crown”, inside which he has placed himself. 121 On the functions of crowns, cf.

To give a couple of examples, Pindar tells us that those who have led a spotless existence weave crowns in the kingdom of Rhada-manthys.124 Virgil also gives an account of the representation of the souls crowned in the Beyond:They all bound their temples with a snow-white band.125Crowns of gold or gilded metal also seem to have played a role in the funerary rites of Magna Graecia.126In addition, the relation of crowns to triumphs in athletic compe-titions is particularly well known. Even a rapid reading of Pindar’s epinician poems would provide us with a dozen examples.127 The metaphor of the crown as the symbol of the believer’s victory after a life of struggle is not foreign to Greek literature, whether in pagan (as in the case of Eleusis) or in Christian contexts.128The crown is part of many rituals that are close to the Orphic world. For instance, Demosthenes testi\u0002 es to the cultic use of the crown when he describes129 the Bacchic thiasoi guided by the of\u0002 ciant Aeschines:In the daytime, guiding the beautiful revels, those crowned by fennel and poplar.123 The crowns, wheels, or ribbons placed on the deceased’s head probably symbol-ized a happy destiny on earth.

Even from the relation established by the lexicographer between wearing crowns and the chthonic character of Dionysus, we may assume that crowns would occupy a preferred place in a hypothetical represen-tation of the god’s suffering and triumph over death. In this case, the crown’s importance in the funerary ritual and in the representations of the practices of the mystes in the Beyond, which we shall see later on, would go back to a rite celebrated on earth that pivots around the god’s death and rebirth.Plutarch131 mentions thiasoi of women who wore crowns, among other attributes peculiar to these rites.And in the thiasoi she (sc.

In the description of an amphora from Vulci from the 4th/3rd cent. B.C., now lost, to which we alluded in § 1.6, the initiates were described as crowned with ivy and bearing thyrsoi.135 It should be recalled, moreover, that the tablets from Pelinna (L 7a–b) have the form of an ivy leaf. For all these reasons, it is not surprising to learn that an enormous mystical gold crown appeared in the Dionysiac procession of Ptolemy II, above the door of the Bereniceion, the sanctuary of the divinized queen.136The ceremonial result of the initiation concludes with a corona-tion.137 The crown, as a symbol of triumph and metaphor of the laurel wreath that was offered as a prize for the victors in games, would give symbolic expression to the fact of having been initiated, and having ensured oneself the prize of glory.138 However, we consider it very risky to attribute the creation of such an extended metaphor to the Orphics. It seems more logical to think that they used a term whose evolution from a concrete to an abstract meaning had already taken place. All these values of the crown: symposiacal, funerary, as a sign of triumph in a competition, and mystical, although they seem highly diverse, can nevertheless appear together in our context.We are therefore dealing with a concrete object, desired and received as a prize (Lμ\u0011\u0006\u0014'\u000e), as a proof of success in the passage through Hades, like wine in the tablets from Pelinna.139 The initiate’s liberation from the cycle of rebirths is conceived as a triumph, and the achievement of a goal obtained after many efforts. In this sense, the crown is a symbol 134 Cf. the interesting book by Blech (1982) 212 ff., for crowns of ivy in the cult of Dionysus; 94 (n. 15), dealing on the relation of myrtle with the cult of Demeter and Kore.

It is also a funerary symbol, insofar as the triumph does not take place in this world, but in the Beyond, since the victors do not have to return to a mortal life, but will remain as eternal residents in the other world. Likewise, it has a mystical basis, since it is a kind of sign of identity for the initiate, as on the vase from Vulci, where initiates are recognized precisely by this external feature. Finally, it is associated with banquets, since a perpetual banquet is promised to the good mystes.Several passages allow us to see how some concepts overlap with one another, even outside our text. A poem by an unknown author, datable to the mid-3rd cent. B.C., is addressed to the tragic poet Philicus, whose head is crowned with ivy at the moment of his departure towards the places of the happy and the island of the Blessed:140Go, happy traveler, go to seethe beautiful choruses of the pious, O Philicus,tossing forth auspicious words from your ivy-crownedhead, and go in festive procession to the islands of the happy.The poem echoes the language and the ideology of the tablets of the initiated dead. Philicus’ ivy-crowned head seems to be a sign of his initiation into the mysteries. Funerary and initiatory aspects are united. Still more signi\u0002 cant is another text from Plato, in which he mocks the bene\u0002 ts promised by Musaeus and his son (that is, Orpheus) to the just in the Beyond, which we have seen and commented with regard to the use of wine.141They transport them in imagination to Hades, and there they set them at the table and organize a banquet of the just, in which they have them spend their entire lives crowned and drunk, as if there were no better reward for virtue than perpetual inebriation.We \u0002 nd the same panorama in a fragment of Aristophanes,142 which, although corrupt, allows us to glimpse that there is a reference to some initiates who participate, crowned, in a banquet in the Beyond.

The philosopher Theo of Smyrna describes the stages of an initiatory ritual that consists \u0002 rst in puri\u0002 cation, fol-lowed by the performance of a ritual, contemplation, and the initiate’s coronation, all of which produced a state of happiness in him.147 Once again, the initiatory ritual, the world of death and the soul’s destiny are implicated in the metaphor of the crown, simultaneously mysti-cal, triumphal and symposiacal, a rich combination of aspects, woven together like the leaves and \u0003 owers that compose it.The parody of initiation in the Clouds148 can also be remembered, where Socrates gives the initiand a crown and explains to him the procedure followed by all the initiates.There follows a new expression, which is dif\u0002 cult to interpret:143 In the distribution of powers among the gods.144 In burial.

After liberating himself from the cycle of births, and surging forth to obtain the crown, thanks to this intimate relation with the goddess, the initiate achieves his goal absolutely, is transformed, and reappears, happy, dei\u0002 ed and compared to a kid fallen into the milk. The subject of debate is in what such a special relation consists concretely. An older line of interpretation seeks a parallel in a passage from Clement of Alexandria, describing the mysteries of Sabazius:149The symbol of the Sabazian mysteries for those who are initiated into them is “the god through the lap”. It is a snake that slides through the initiates’ lap, a proof of Zeus’ sexual incontinence.The tone of Clement’s description suggests that the ritual in which a snake (real or \u0002 ctitious) was made to pass beneath the initiates’ clothing was a kind of commemoration of Zeus’ sexual union with Persephone in the form of a serpent. In this perspective, the initiate would unite mystically with the god in a kind of correlate of sexual union, whose result, according to some authors, was adoption by the goddess.150There are some obstacles to accepting this suggestion: the act described in the tablet does not seem to be a rite (which would take place in a \u0014\u0011\f\u0011\u0014$), but something that occurs in Hades.151 Other argu-ments can be added to this objection: \u0002 rst, the sexual atmosphere seems particularly far removed from the Orphic rituals and from Orphic life in general, which is characterized by unadulterated puritanism.152 The second argument is that sexual union does not seem to be the most adequate ritual means for an adoption. The third is that in this context, the initiate’s conversion into a suckling kid would be rather shocking.149 Clem. Alex. Protr. 2, 16, 2.150 Dieterich (1891) 37 ff. (= [1911] 97 ff.) interprets it as an act of symbolic adop-tion of the mystes; cf. Harrison (19223) 593 ff. Festugière (1932) 137 f. prefers to see in it a L\u0011\u0006@\u000e #\tμ\u0003\u000e. Colli (19813) 402 saw in it a reminiscence of obscene elements. Bacchus is born through the violation Zeus commits in Persephone’s lap in the guise of a snake, according to the passage cited by Clement of Alexandria. 151 As is argued by Rohde (18982) II 421. 152 Burkert (1975) 97 rejects the possibility of an obscene allusion such as \u0014\u0007\b N5@ \u0002'\f5\u0003\b \u0014\u0015, as in the adulterated mysteries of Alexander of Abonouticus, or the symbol N5@ \u0014@\b 5\u0005)\u0014@\b N5*\u001a\u0010\b of those of Attis.BERNABE_f6_99-132.indd 12910/31/2007 9:27:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130 chapter fourA second, more acceptable line of interpretation sees in the reception in the goddess’ bosom an everyday image: that of the child who \u0002 nds peace, well-being, security and refuge beneath the lap of his mother or nursemaid.153The expression N5@ \u0002'\f5\u0003\b is already present in the Homeric poems: Demeter holds the child Demophoon in her lap; Thetis receives Dio-nysus in her lap to protect him, and even when the divine Eidothea enters the sea, she also plunges into her lap. Dionysus himself is called N5\u0003\u0002'\f5\u0015\u0011 ‘he who is in the lap’ in an Orphic Hymn.154In the light of these texts, the initiate takes refuge in the protective lap of the goddess. However, although this connotation is acceptable, it still remains insuf\u0002 cient for understanding why the transformation takes place. It therefore seems necessary to have recourse to an inter-pretation that goes further.Here, too, a starting point is Dieterich,155 who sees in the formula an allusion to a kind of second birth from the divine mother after death. Burkert,156 who comes out in favor of this line of interpretation, relates the phrase to a passage from the end of Plato’s Republic (621a), where the souls, once they have chosen their destiny, must “pass beneath the throne of Necessity”. Burkert considers that the phrase we are studying and the Platonic one are illustrations of the same ritual sphere: we have clearly to do with a ritual of birth, which, in myth, leads to rebirth. He even presents as a parallel the Lady of Baza, a seated statue of an Iberian goddess with a hollow beneath her lap, in which the ashes of a dead person were deposited.157 In a similar light, a series of female idols from Anatolia, the Cyclades, and Asia Minor, have been studied as goddesses of life and death.158 Likewise an Etruscan \u0002 gure, rather late,159 which represents Gorgo, the mistress of animals, with her legs open, may be mentioned. Still more interesting, since they are closer 153 Zuntz (1971) 319.

They represent goddesses with a child, half of whose body appears beneath her clothing, sometimes accompanied by a bird.161 Such images have been interpreted as a symbol of the initiate’s penetration within the goddess’ bosom in order to be born again. Other similar \u0002 gures show the goddess suckling a child.162In the light of these \u0002 gures, it is appropriate to interpret that when the initiate says N5@ \u0002'\f5\u0003\b &\u001a\u0010\b ‘I plunged beneath the lap’, it means that he penetrates inside the goddess’ womb in order to be born again, converted into a god.163 His falling into the milk would imply that he is transformed into a nursling of the goddess’ milk (cf. the sarcophagus of Tarquinia, discussed in App. II n. 9).This belief has been compared with various Oriental myths and rituals164 in which the dead person returns to the uterus of the mother, particularly a myth involving Enki, the Mesopotamian god of fresh water, and Ninhursag.165Although we lack suf\u0002 cient data to con\u0002 rm that we are dealing with a rite,166 and even if neither the Oriental nor speci\u0002 c philosophical explanations are accepted, the fact is that we seem to have reasons to suppose that the Orphic initiate, re-creating very ancient beliefs of the Mediterranean world, believed that after having been born from his mother’s womb, he is received at his death by the womb of Mother Earth, from which he is reborn, but to a new, higher, and divine life. Let us recall, in this respect, that the ancient Great Mother of the Aegean was later adored by the Greeks in the \u0002 gures of Aphrodite, Demeter, 160 Fridh-Haneson (1987).161 A similar motif appears on a mirror from Perugia, conserved in National Library of Paris, cf.

He wonders whether becoming one with the god means returning to the unity of the cosmic egg.166 Cf.

Then if the soul exists beforehand, and if it is necessary for it when it goes to live and to be born, not to be born from any other thing but from death and from being dead, then how can it fail to be necessary for it to exist once it as died, given that it is inevitable for it to be born again?” Then there are the verses by Euripides placed in the mouth of Socrates, Plat.

The transla-tion we offer is based on the conjecture \u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\b,3 which enables the text to be understood with a certain clarity: Eubouleus, son of Zeus, is none other than Dionysus, who is likewise a son of Persephone,4 and Eucles is Zeus, identi\u0002 ed with the infernal god.Curiously in a tablet containing the formula of presentation before Persephone, such as those from Thurii, we \u0002 nd a mention of Mnemo-syne in what follows, such as in those from the \u0002 rst group we examined, which constitutes a proof that at least at this time—and we believe it was always that way—Mnemosyne and Persephone belonged to one and the same religious scheme.We can then ask ourselves what the poet is referring to when he speaks of “this gift of Mnemosyne”. Some authors believe it is the poem,5 but 1 As suggested by Zuntz (1971) 334.2 As in the proposal of Riedweg (1996) 479.3 Suggested by West (1975) 231, in opposition to that of Diels (1907) 46 f. \u0002\u000b\u0003\f\r, \u000e\u0007\u000f \u0005\u0010.

I have this gift from Mnemosyne, etc.” Yet this text (accepted by the majority of modern editors) seems unacceptable to us, for several reasons: a) to whom does “splendid offspring of Zeus” refer?—as Kotansky wonders (1994) 110–, since it cannot be Caecilia Secundina herself, as Marshall (1911) 380 would have it. b) Who is the subject of “I have”? Not much is solved by the suggestion by Colli (19813) 236 f. who punctuates after \u0011\u0006\u0012\u0013\u0014 and interprets as “splendid (viz. I, the soul), I have . . .”. It does not seem adequate to suppose that the soul that arrives in the other world to be received should do so by bragging about its splendor. The only more acceptable solution would be if the subject were the tablet itself. c) Above all, however, \u0011\u0006\u0012\u0013\u0014 is neuter, and we should expect \u0002\u000b\u0003\f\u0015\u0016 (cf. the question by Lagrange [1937] 140, n. 2, as to whether the engraver could have allowed himself to write \u0002\u000b\u0003\f\u0006 for \u0002\u000b\u0003\f\u0015\u0016).

A disconcerting discoveryThe so-called “great tablet” (81 \u0002 23 mm.) from Thurii was discovered in the large grave called Timpone grande, in 1897. It had been folded nine times, and served as a wrapper for L 8. Also dated to the turn of the 4th and the 3rd centuries B.C., it has remained largely incomprehensible for many years, and has been a genuine enigma for scholars.After the initial perplexity brought about by its discovery2 (since the tablet turned out to be unintelligible), a copy of the text reached an extremely competent philologist, Hermann Diels, who, in 1902, by applying his enormous knowledge of Greek and no less enormous doses of imagination, reconstructed, or, as one might more accurately say, invented the \u0002 rst six lines of the text.3 According to him, it was a Sicilian Orphic poem on Demeter, supposedly copied again and again, which generated a great accumulation of mistakes. Diels’ well-deserved prestige immediately made this reconstruction acceptable and the model for other subsequent proposals,4 in which the attempt continued to be made to obtain a coherent text from the tablet. In contrast, Compa-retti5 criticized Diels’ hypothesis of an accumulation of errors, given that South Italian scribes spoke and wrote Greek \u0003 uently, and that there is an in\u0002 nitely lower proportion of errors in the other tablets from Thurii. He reached the conclusion that the text was deliberately incomprehensible, arcane, and linked with mysteries, as divine names are masked among meaningless letters, and that it may have been read as an exhortation to the divinity for the soul of a dead initiate in funeral ceremonies (since it does not, in fact, contain any unpronounceable sequences). Consequently, he considers it naive to try to understand a text that was created precisely in order not to be understood.2 When the tablets were discovered, Barnabei took charge of them, but was unable to make sense of the large one, and therefore sent a facsimile of it to Comparetti, who was also unable to read it, but published some notes in which he recognized a few words (cf. Comparetti [1878–1879] 329).3 Diels (1902), later included in the edition of the Presocratics (195415 [= 1903]) I b 21).4 Murray (1908) 664 ff.5 Comparetti (1910) 12 ff.BERNABE_f8_136-150.indd 13810/31/2007 9:28:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" the “great” tablet from thurii (L 12) 139Some authors have tried to elaborate on the idea that we might be dealing with a magical text.6 In particular, the very fact that it was used as a wrapper for another tablet has been interpreted in the sense that it served as a kind of phylactery to safeguard the other text,7 or even as a kind of amulet,8 related to enchantments, such as those we \u0002 nd in the magical papyri to be used in the other world, which also contain incomprehensible formulas. However, others have rightly emphasized the fact that our text does not follow the familiar pattern of the magical texts.9 It does not feature the phonic sequences that are usual in this type of text, and in addition, we might add, in the other magical texts the abracadabra’s are preceded by indications on their powers or their effects, on the manner of pronouncing them, or on the gestures that must accompany them. Consequently, most editors have maintained the hypothesis of a text \u0002 lled with errors by an extraordinarily incompetent scribe.10 The textual situation is ultimately so desperate that Pugliese Carratelli restricted himself to transcribing the capital letters in order, giving up on obtaining a continuous text in his successive editions of the tablets,11 and is open to the possibility that we may have to do with a kind of magical phylactery. To conclude the catalogue of proposals, we must cite the old idea that we might be in the presence of a text in another language, distinct from Greek, which preserved only the names of the gods.126.2. A proposal for a new readingWe cannot share the interpretation that the “great tablet” is written in a language other than Greek. Neither does the text resemble, even dis-tantly, that of any known Italic dialect, nor can we expect its appearance 6 Murray (1908) 665, Burkert (1974) 326, Kingsley (1995) 310. 7 Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 67. 8 Kotansky (1991) 114 ff., 121. 9 Murray (1908) 665, Olivieri (1915) 22 ff., Zuntz (1971) 345.10 Olivieri (1915) 22 ff. presents a reconstruction of the text with very little convic-tion while Zuntz (1971) 346 ff. resigns himself to recuperating only a few segments. For his part, Colli (1995 [= 1977]) 190 ff. tries to recuperate all he can (which is, in fact, not very much), and concludes that Diels’ interpretative approach (197115 [= 1903]) was the most acceptable.11 Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 66 f., (2001a) 125 f., (2003) 129 ff.

Nor can we accept that we have to do with a text that is simply corrupt, copied very badly by a deliriously incompetent scribe. We ought to recall that it was written on a expensive gold tablet, which accompanies on her path to the other world a socially prestigious individual, with a comfortable economic situation and apparently a higher than average level of culture, who could be more demanding with her suppliers. There are other tablets in the area (one of them in the same grave) which are much more comprehensible.Nor can we consider it a mixture of meaningless letters in which sequences that correspond to extant words might have appeared by chance. In the legible sections, we \u0002 nd words that are clear and have a meaning, a logic, and a relation with one another that exclude the possibility that their presence may be due to chance, and in them the number of errors is minimal.In brief, the situation is as follows. We can read more than \u0002 fty words in the text (either isolated words or syntagmas), connected to each other by logical relations, which form part of one and the same ideological and religious scheme. Around them, we \u0002 nd sequences of letters that are inevitably meaningless and resist any attempt to recon-stitute a continuous text. One of the authors of this book13 has sug-gested accepting the idea that this duplicity is deliberate, that various divine names and mystical formulas have been gathered together in the tablet, which constitute a signi\u0002 cant system, and have been surrounded by sequences that can be pronounced, but are voluntarily meaningless from the outset, for which reason it is absurd to try to form from them a coherent text, which never existed. We would thus be dealing with a message that is similar (mutatis mutandis) to a world search puzzle: that is, columns of letters, a determinate number of which form words, which have a relation among themselves (in word search puzzles, one searches, for instance, for rivers or movie actors, and they can also be related to a series of drawings which accompany the mysterious text). Both in the aforementioned pastime and in our tablet, the point is that the person who sets out to read the text knows what to search for in 13 Cf. Bernabé (2002c), which served as the basis for this chapter, and where more details may be found. For his part, Betegh (2004) 332 ff. utilizes this reconstruction and compares it with some passages from the Derveni Papyrus and Heraclitus, and Tortorelli Ghidini (2006) and Graf-Johnston (2007) present it, although Tortorelli Ghidini and Betegh (forthcoming) include some different proposals regarding details.BERNABE_f8_136-150.indd 14010/31/2007 9:28:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" the “great” tablet from thurii (L 12) 141the mishmash of meaningless letters, and this gives him the key to set aside some letter sequences as the products of chance, and accept only those that refer to what he is searching for. This is what Comparetti,14 in a curious turn of phrase, calls ‘cryptosemasia’, or ‘hidden signi\u0002 ca-tion’, whereas Betegh prefers to speaks of “encryption”.15We understand, then, that the text is not awfully corrupt, but that it was written for people who knew what to look for in it (divine names, mystical formulas), and that there were other letters without value, which were not to be taken into consideration. The basic difference that exists between a “word search puzzle” and our text is the purpose of the text. The tablet is not an amusement, but has mystical intentions, on which its user’s salvation depends. Only the initiate is able to \u0002 nd the holy words in the sequence of letters and discern what is signi\u0002 cant from what is not, and this knowledge is useful to him in the other world, where the tablet accompanies him. In contrast, if the text were to fall into the hands of a non-initiate, it would be completely useless to him, because he could not read it.166.3. Sacred formulas among meaningless letters. Some parallelsLet us consider, then, the words we believe may be read.17 Naturally, in a work of this nature it is not always easy to decide whether we are 14 Comparetti (1910) 15 n. 3.15 Betegh (forthcoming).16 A magical use of the text can be neither con\u0002 rmed nor denied, but the same could be said, with equal justi\u0002 cation, of the other gold tablets, which are simultaneously the proof that their bearer belongs to the group of initiates, an aid for remembering what one must say or do in the other world, and perhaps, at the same time, a kind of magical protection, like the scapularies, medals, and other elements of popular religios-ity, which for some people have a function that is identifying, salvi\u0002 c, and—why not call a spade a spade?—magical. However, the cryptic text does not, in and of itself, add any magical element to the pure use of the tablet, but the letters that apparently derive from abracadabras have their own function: to hide the message and make it apt only for the initiates able to interpret it. Other similar texts dated in 5th–4th B.C. have been found in places near Thurii, cf. Martín Hernández (forthcoming).17 The heterogeneous character of these mentions, which stem from various origins, explains why they lack dialectal unity. The most striking aspect is the coexistence of South Italic Doric (which probably derives from the \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 of the ritual) with the Ionic of the poetic tradition.BERNABE_f8_136-150.indd 14110/31/2007 9:28:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 chapter sixin the presence of an intentional word or the result of chance.18 It is necessary, in addition to distinguishing what is signi\u0002 cant from what is not, constantly to consider the possibility of errors in the text which we might call “signi\u0002 cant”, which complicates our task a great deal more, obliging us to be prudent and demand that the text we accept be justi\u0002 ed within the context. As a second requirement, we must base our reconstructions on parallels from texts that derive from the same religious environment: viz., Orphism.19In line 1, we can separate the signi\u0002 cant words:To the First-Born, to Mother Earth, to the Cybelean, daughter of Demeter.In the Derveni Papyrus, somewhat prior to our text, the First-Born is Heaven;20 in Euripides it appears to be Eros, and in the Rhapsodies21 it is Phanes, a god whose name means ‘who appears’ or ‘the resplendent one’, described as a being with four heads, winged and serpentine, the \u0002 rst demiurge of the world prior to the re-creation carried out by Zeus, after having devoured it. The appearance of this god, the First-Born Phanes, in literature and iconography goes back to a much later date,22 for which reason it seems highly unlikely that we should \u0002 nd him in a text from the end of the fourth century B.C. Since in what follows there is a mention of Mother Earth, who is the partner of Heaven, and taking into account the Orphic password we gave already analyzed (L 1, 10, etc.):I am the son of Earth and of starry Heaven,it is most likely that the First-Born here, as in the Derveni Papyrus, is Heaven, the \u0002 rst child of Night. The Girl, daughter of Demeter,23 is 18 It should be borne in mind, moreover, that when a text with the characteristics we postulate, that is, in which meaningless sequences are mixed with others which do have meaning, is copied, it is easy to make mistakes, because the person making the copy does not have the support of a de\u0002 nite logic of the text.19 The details concerning the text may be found in the critical apparatus (see App. 1), as well as in Bernabé (2002c), where a discussion of other suggestions will be found.20 The question is highly debated, and we cannot enter into it here. We refer the reader to Bernabé (2002e), (2003a), (2004b), where the relevant discussion may be found.21 Eur. Hyps. fr. 758a, 1103 ff. Kannicht (OF 65), OF 109 IX, 123 and 143.22 Cf.

The deceased thus addresses his ultimate ancestors, Heaven, Earth, and Persephone, the divinity of the dead, who decides his fate in the other world.In line 2, we \u0002 nd three vocatives and a brief phrase:Zeus, Air, Sun. Fire conquers all.25The identi\u0002 cation of the god with the air already occurs in Derveni Papyrus;26 for the phrase on the cosmic power of \u0002 re (we recall the idea of the initiate as transformed by Zeus’ purifying lightning-bolt in L 9–10) we \u0002 nd parallels in Heraclitus:27Upon its arrival, \u0002 re will discern and subdue all things.Night-wanderers, magoi, bacchoi, Lenai, mystai: they are threatened by what comes after death; \u0002 re is predicted for them.As far as the Sun is concerned, it is an important divinity among the Orphics.

Illustrious demon.Fortune (\u0010\u0003\u0011\u000b) is a goddess who appears identi\u0002 ed with Artemis in Orphic literature.29 As far as Phanes is concerned, as we have already said, we do not think it likely that he should be the god cited in the 24 Cf., for instance, the Hymn to Demeter in the Derveni Papyrus, 4th cent.

A more likely alternative is offered by Diodorus (1, 11, 2) who, with regard to the Sun, which he identi\u0002 es with the Egyptian god Osiris, tells us that some Greek mythologists call Dionysus Osiris, and cites a verse he attributes to Orpheus:30and that is what they call him (sc. Sun-Osiris) Phanes and also Dionysus.Judging by this parallel, we would have in our tablet, approximately contemporary with the text cited by Diodorus, a new case of the use of the epithet Phanes to refer to Dionysus, identi\u0002 ed with the Sun. And this would support the hypothesis we have advanced for the preceding line. With regard to the allusion to the Moirai, it seems to be due to a desire to insist on the fact that these divinities of the other world take each one of the events in the deceased’s life into consideration, in order to know what his destiny will be after death.31We can only speculate on the god alluded to by the last expression “illustrious demon”, since in the Rhapsodies we \u0002 nd that Phanes (OF 140), Kronos (OF 239), and Zeus (OF 243) are all called !\u0007\u001aμ\u001e\". Zeus’ candidacy would be more likely if we were to understand that the same god is being referred to as in the following line.Indeed, in line 4 we read:Father who subdues all.

Aidoneus (that is, Hades) is the earth, while water is identi\u0002 ed with Nestis, a little-known Sicilian divinity35 who is probably nothing other than an epithet of Persephone.36There is also an allusion to the four elements in our tablet, but it is in the vocative: the \u0002 rst two by their name, air and \u0002 re. The third, mother, is obviously a reference to the earth, habitually called “mother earth” in an in\u0002 nite number of texts, among others line 1 of this very tablet.

There are two masculine divinities, a god of the upper region and of the light, of the world of the living, and two feminine ones, of below and the darkness, of the world of the dead.

The most interesting parallel is constituted by two verses from a Hymn to Zeus contained in the Rhapso-dies (OF 243), in which, to assert that Zeus contains the totality of the Universe within himself, the poet mentions the four elements and the elemental temporal sequence: night-day, that is, the same six referents mentioned in our line:unique sovereign body, in which all things complete their cycle,\u0002 re, water, earth and ether; night and day.We do not consider it possible that such a close coincidence could be the result of chance.

With regard to the mother, she is, for the initiated believer, none other than Persephone, the mother of Dionysus, whom the Titans dismembered and devoured according to the Orphic myth. Since the human beings derive from the ashes of the Titans, whom Zeus struck by lightning, there is a part of Dionysus in them, and to this extent they can consider Persephone their own mother. The prayer is addressed to her because, as we have seen, she is responsible for the fate of the Orphic believer in the lower world.Finally, we \u0002 nd a reference to the “beautiful rites” like that which appears in the Gurôb Papyrus, a text which also comes from Egypt and is dated to the 3rd century B.C., that is, a chronological environment that is very close to that of our text, although it is unfortunately in a rather poor state.44 Here an Orphic ritual is described whose elements present a considerable coincidence with some of those we have seen in our tablet:Save me, great Brimo (l. 5)Demeter and Rhea (l. 6)we shall celebrate beautiful sacri\u0002 ces (l. 8)prayer (l. 16)40 For instance, the fast at Eleusis; cf. Plut. Dem. 30, h. Cer. 47 ff., Ovid. Met. 10, 73 f., Orph. Hymn. 41, 4. It cannot be excluded (for we know a great deal about the Orphics’ love of plays on words) that in \"\u000e\u0002\u000f\u001b\u0007\u001f there is a play on the etymology of the goddess (\r\u0002\u000f\u001b\u001f, who has just been mentioned. In fact, Hippolytus, Haer. 7, 29, 4, interprets the name (\r\u0002\u000f\u001b\u001f precisely on the basis of \"\r\u0002\u000f\u001b\u001f ‘fast’, so that it is not surprising that our unknown author should have done so before him.41 OF 141.42 The same epithet is also applied to Zeus in a verse from Aeschylus, Eum. 1045.43 Cf.

Light to intelligence. The Counselor seized the Girl.The key to the interpretation of this conceptual sequence is given by line 2 of the tablet from Entella, in which there was mention of a “hero who remembers”. In both texts, the term “hero” refers to the condition acquired by certain dead persons who successfully undergo the trials to which they are subjected in the other world, and achieve a happy life. What he remembers is no doubt his initiation, for only by remembering what it has learned during initiation can the soul of the deceased do what needs to be done in the other world, thereby achieving its condition as a hero, or an eternally happy deceased per-son. In our tablet, the phrase “light for intelligence” would be a clear reference to the illumination of the believer’s mind, probably by means of initiation.The phrase “the counselor seized the girl” can be clari\u0002 ed because \u0016\u000e\u0002\u000f\u001e ‘counselor’ is an epithet of Zeus in some texts, already in Homer.45 The Girl can only be Persephone, so that we have a clear allusion to Zeus’ union with his daughter, precisely in order to give birth to Dionysus, a myth that is well-known in the Orphic theogonies.4645 Il. 8, 22; 17, 339: “Zeus, supreme counselor”.46 Cf. the Theogony of Hieronymus and Hellanicus, in Athenag.

Reconstruction of the religious backgroundWe see how, once the gibberish of letters has been set aside, a series of terms emerge that show an intimate link among them. This con-ceptual union gives them meaning, as does the fact that they belong to a coherent scheme of religious reference, which we can synthesize as follows: I. The fundamental gods mentioned are the \u0002 rst couple, Heaven (= First-Born [of Night]) and Mother Earth (= Demeter = Cybele); Zeus, the supreme god of the new order, who unites with Demeter to produce Persephone (= the Girl) and who, uniting with Perse-phone, produces Dionysus (identi\u0002 ed with the Sun). II. The structure of the Universe. The universe is constituted by four god-elements: Air (= Zeus), Fire (= Sun = Phanes [Dionysus]), who conquers all, Earth (= Demeter = Cybele), and Water (= Nestis [Persephone]). It also has a temporal structure, based on night and day, as well as a power structure, based on Zeus’ domination in the world (almost shared with Dionysus), and with that of Persephone in the infernal world. This structure is eternal (“always”). III. Man’s situation in the Universe. Each person has a personal destiny (ruled by Tyche), and is subject to the constant vigilance of Zeus, who sees all. All his actions are taken into consideration by the Moirai, who forget nothing. He will have to pay compensation for all he does on earth in the other world. However, he can propitiate the infernal goddess (the Mother of Dionysus, also alluded to as a mother by the speaker of the prayer, because he aspires to be identi\u0002 ed with the god).daughter, and she becomes pregnant by him. My witness shall be . . . Orpheus”. In the Rhapsodies as well, Procl. Theol. Plat.

The rite as an instrument of salvation. Initiation is thought to offer the initiate the possibility of coming to know the features de\u0002 ned in I to III, and this initiation is like an illumination of the mind. Subsequently, other instruments of mediation are possible, such as fasting, supplication, and the “beautiful” sacri\u0002 ce. V. The happy result of the entire preceding process is to obtain the status of “hero” and a happy life in the other world.We have found the same schemes, or very similar ones, in reference to a literature related to Egypt (the Egyptian Hieros logos and the Gurôb Papyrus), in other ancient Orphic texts like the Derveni Papyrus47 and in later Orphic poems. The schematic phraseology reminds us of the Gurôb Papyrus, and well as those of the bone tablets from Olbia.

L 13 is written in prose, and apparently concerns a shorter password, which gives direct access to the meadow of the blessed. A consider-able problem is to whom the soul is speaking, since the tablet does not say. One possibility might be that it is addressing the \u0002 rst guardians, with a change in the formula. Another, that the soul is speaking to some second guardians, who, in the last stage, would give access to the meadow.

The passwordsThe \u0002 rst tablet begins ex abrupto with the word \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 ‘passwords’, which introduces the text and quali\u0002 es it. Everything that follows is, therefore, a password. We should ask ourselves what we should under-stand by this. In the \u0002 rst place, we have to do with words the mystes must utter in order to be recognized as an initiate, in the way soldiers know passwords that let them identify themselves as friends before others from the same army. In the Gurôb Papyrus,2 where a ritual is recorded that is very probably Orphic, we also hear of passwords, in a context which, although it is in a very fragmentary state, exhibits great similarities with this tablet, since Brimo is also invoked, and Ericepaeus is mentioned:save me, great Brimo . . . Eubouleus, Ericepaeus . . . passwords . . .Firmicus Maternus3 speaks of the use of such passwords for mutual recognition among initiates, and so that they may be given access to places where the profane cannot enter:We must explain what signs or symbols this miserable crowd of men use in such superstitions to recognize one another. They have their own signs, their own replies; which, when they are heard, they are accepted into recondite places, from which the profane are excluded.4We \u0002 nd references to \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 in the mysteries in other authors, which increase our knowledge of the value of such expressions. For instance, Plutarch tries to console his wife over the death of their daughter by reminding her:5Concerning what you have heard from others, who try to convince many people that for the person who has passed away there is nowhere any evil nor sadness,6 I know that you are prevented from believing this by the doctrine of our fathers and the mystic passwords (\b\t μ\u0002\b\u000b\f\t \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007) 2 Cf. § 6, p. 147 n. 44.3 Firm.

Bit by bit, \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 acquired the meaning of ‘symbolic reference’, or of hidden allusions (“symbolic” in our current mean-ing) to profound beliefs, with phrases that super\u0002 cially seem to mean something else. A passage from Proclus8 is revealing in this sense, where the barbarity of the ancients’ theogonic stories is interpreted as a mere symbolic expression of profound truths:Of the ancient poets who thought it well to compose, in a way that is only too reminiscent of tragedies, the secret theologies, and therefore converted the gods’ wanderings, castrations, wars, dismemberments, robberies, and adulteries and so on into symbols of the truth about the divine that was hidden within them.On the other hand, since the tablet records the password that must be spoken, it itself, in its turn, is a password that identi\u0002 es the mystes. It is not surprising that in some later authors \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 also designates the objects used in the ritual.9In sum, the “symbols” in our context seem to be brief expressions that synthesize aspects of the initiate’s doctrine (although in such a concentrated form that they would be incomprehensible to the profane, owing to their ignorance of the context in which they are uttered), and they have the added value of serving the followers of the same doctrine as identifying marks.In § 1.7, we saw that the word \u0002\u0003μ\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 also appears in the tablet from Entella (L 2, 19), indicating that it also mentioned passwords, but 7 Boehm (1905), Burkert (1972) 166 ff., Parker (1983) 294 f. and n. 64.

It appears in the Gurôb Papyrus, probably in reference to Dionysus. Proclus mentions the epithet as an appellation of Dionysus:14Dionysus is often also called Phanes and Ericepaeus.as does the lexicographer Hesychius:Ericepaeus: Dionysus.and an inscription from Selendus in Asia Minor:15To Dionysus Ericepaeus.In our context, it is more likely that we are dealing with an allusion to Dionysus-Bacchus (as in the case of Phanes in the tablet from Thurii, L 12, 3, cf. § 6.3), which accompanies the reference to Persephone 10 Cf., however, 50f. n. 172.11 We \u0002 nd the same procedure in an Olbian inscription from 300 B.C., engraved on the base of an Attic vase from the 5th century B.C.

The reverse process is, of course, possible, that is a name Ericepaeus (whose meaning was certainly already unknown even to the faithful) being deformed, by a kind of popular etymology, but the Pherai tablet is the oldest attestation of this name, for which reason we consider the \u0002 rst explanation more plausible.The thyrsus, which forms the second part of the epithet, is the emblem of the followers of Dionysus. Several passages relate it to the Dionysiac cult.17 We should recall the famous verse already transmit-ted by Plato:Many are those who bear the thyrsus, but few are the bacchoi.18As far as Brimo, “the terrible one” is concerned, it is usually an epithet of Persephone, Rhea, Demeter and Hecate. It is most reasonable to think that in the tablet it refers to Persephone, or at least would evoke her for the initiate. In the passage from the Gurôb Papyrus we referred to earlier, the mystes begs the goddess:Save me, great Brimo, and Demeter-Rhea.Here, we obviously have to do with a female divinity, with the ability to “save” the initiate, who in the immediately preceding line declares that he has “paid the penalties of his fathers”.

Lucian gives a burlesque presentation of her in his Necromancy 20, howling her approval of a decree in an assembly in the other world. It then changes into an epithet applied to various goddesses associated with the chthonic or infernal world, such as Demeter, Rhea, Hecate, or Persephone.20 We can also cite the existence of a (masculine) Brimo, nickname of Iacchus, the son of Persephone who appears in a text, whose recitation accompanied part of the sacred drama performed in the Eleusinian mysteries.21Our epithet appears applied to Persephone in an Orphic context in the Argonautica attributed to Orpheus. It is placed in the mouth of Orpheus himself, among the themes he dealt with (17):The race of powerful22 Brimo and the destructive works of the sons of the Earth.If we identify Brimo with Persephone in this passage, the “race of Brimo” is a reference to Dionysus,23 whereas the “destructive works of the sons of the Earth” would allude to the crime of the Titans.24 In our tablet, it is most likely that we should identify Brimo too with Persephone, to whose sacred meadows the mystes arrives free of pun-ishment, exactly as is declared in the tablets from Thurii before the infernal goddess (L 10, 4):I have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious acts,in the hope that she will send him to the seat of the pure, that is, save him de\u0002 nitively.19 Kern (1897) 853 f.

The effects of the passwordsOne supposes that once the mystes utters the key words, the password “Andricepaedothyrsus, Andricepaedothyrsus, Brimo, Brimo” is rec-ognized as such and is judged worthy of being accepted. Therefore, someone (the goddess herself ? or a priest from this world?) invites him to enter the “sacred meadow”. We shall return to speak of the meadow in the chapter dedicated to the initiate’s \u0002 nal destiny in the beyond (§ 9.3).The \u0002 nal phrase,since the initiate is free from punishmentcontains the idea that the initiate and practitioner of the Orphic reli-gion does not receive the \u0012\u0005\u000b\u000e\u0019 or punishment he owes for the death of Dionysus. However, the expression may mean several things:In the \u0002 rst place, it could mean that by virtue of being initiated, he does not have to expiate his guilt. It does not seem that we should accept this possibility. In the religious scheme with which we are familiar, the mystes declares that he has paid a punishment (L 10, 4):I have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious acts.Second, it may refer to the fact that he does not need to pay more punishments (on earth) because he has already paid them. Initiation would not be the procedure that automatically concedes salvation, but the means used by man to accede to the knowledge of his situation, and of what he must do to save himself. This second interpretation seems more congruent with the remaining texts.Finally (and without contradicting the previous interpretation), it might mean that the mystes need not pay punishment in the other world, which would imply the existence of infernal punishments for whomever has not been initiated. This interpretation is consistent with the Platonic BERNABE_f9_151-160.indd 15711/7/2007 9:53:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 chapter sevenallusions to the fact that whoever has not been initiated will lie in the mud or suffer punishments like carrying water in a sieve.25In the light of this tablet one can, we believe, more clearly explain the mere passwords from Pella and other places noted on L 16, in which a person is identi\u0002 ed by his name or/and by his condition as μ\u0003\u0002\b!\u0017. It is understood that the bearer of this kind of tablet considered himself to be %\u0012\u0005\u000b\u000e\u0005\u0017, and claimed to demonstrate this fact.At the end of the tablet, there is a word in inverted letters that seems to read &'()*#,26 which should perhaps be read +\u0012,\u000f\u000e ‘I plunged’,27 which would place our tablet in relation with the one from Thurii (L 9, 7):I plunged beneath the lap of my Lady.Hence, the word would be a kind of declaration that the mystes has returned to the womb of the goddess in order to be reborn.7.4. A prayer: -\u0010\u001b\u000b\u0007 and \b,\u0006!L 13a contains a prayer. The mystes addresses an unknown divinity, but the parallels of the other gold tablets suggest strongly that she is Persephone. He prays:Send me to the thiasoi of the initiates.This mention of the thiasos supports the interpretation of L 8, 2 (cf. § 3.1.). The thiasos is the reunion of initiates in the Beyond, and the mystes makes “a claim of membership”,28 arguing that he is initiated in several different mysteries, because the place of initiates is the privileged abode, the locus amoenus in Hades. We \u0002 nd other proof that the reward for initiates is imagined as a collective one; the mystes belongs to a group during his life and after death belongs again to a group.2925 Cf.

But, as Graf and Johnston point out,33 Orpheus was associated with the foundation of many mysteries.7.5.

The name of Bacchos is not sure, because it has been restored in a lost part of the tablet.

Comparison with other tablets (like L 16k “Philiste greets Persephone” and 16b “Posidippus, a pious mystes, [ greets] Persephone”) seems to favour the interpretation we have adopted. The deceased would be trying to propitiate the infernal gods by using a greeting that identi\u0002 es him as a mystes.6 Once again, Persephone—this time accompanied by her husband—is depicted as the goddess who guarantees the initiate’s happiness in the other world and must be propitiated accordingly.L 14, found in Sfakaki, is similar, and it is limited to the names of Pluto and Persephone in the dative case.L 15a, found in Heraclea, is also similar, because contains greetings, but in these instance addressed to a Lord (\u0011\t\u0012\u0013\u0014\u0015\t\u0003). Hatzopoulos7 considers \u0011\t\u0012\u0013\u0014\u0015\t\u0003 a name of Dionysus, to whom the soul requests her acceptance among the blessed. However, this epithet is never applied to Dionysus in the gold tablets. The comparison with L 14, 15 and 16k), in which we read the names of Pluto and Persephone in the dative case, makes it preferable to identify the \u0011\t\u0012\u0013\u0014\u0015\b\u0016 from Heraclea with Hades, the Lord of the subterranean world. This god is not so called in the gold tablets, but her wife Persephone has the name \u0011\u0017\u0012\u0013\u0005\u0003\u0018\u000b, “Lady” in L 9, 7.88.2. Identi\u0002 cations of the mystai; tablets from Pella and other placesIn L 16, we collected a series of tablets with shorter texts, which seem to belong to this same religious atmosphere, although they are less explicit than the preceding ones. Several of them (a, b, c, e) are shaped like a laurel or an olive leaf, and extend over a period of time which runs from the end of the 4th cent. B.C. to the end of the Hellenistic period.9 6 On the use of \u0007\u000b\u0019\u001a\t\u0003\u0018 to greet a person about to be heroicized or divinized, cf. § 3.2. Just as the greeting identi\u0002 es the mystes in his new heroic status, the greeting to the gods presents the initiate as equal to the divinity.7 Hatzopoulos (2002) 28.8 See also Jiménez San Cristóbal (2007). Hades is called \u001b\t\u0012\u0013\u0014\u0015\b\u0016 in Diph. fr. 136 K.-A., in an escathological context.9 On the shape of the tablets from Pella, and on the mysteries said to have been celebrated there, cf. Dickie (1995); Martín Hernández (2006) 453 ff. proposes that the collocation of the tablets in the mouth of the defunct would suggest their interpreta-tion as tongues with which the dead speak to Persephone. There are an indeterminate number of other tablets from the 4th cent.

The identi\u0002 catory function of the mystes predomi-nates in them over the other characteristics of the tablets, such as that of reminding the bearer of what he must do in the other world. Some of them were worn by the bearer on the forehead, which makes their identi\u0002 cation function all the more obvious.The most interesting one is L 16b, in which a certain Posidippus presents himself before Persephone. We know a Hellenistic poet of the same name, and the possibility cannot be excluded that we may be dealing with someone from his family (if the dating of the tomb is correct, he would be of the generation of the poet’s grandfather).11 It is nevertheless curious that certain extant verses of the poet contain references to the mysteries:12In my old age, may I travel the mystic road to Rhadamanthys.13This “mystic road” is reminiscent of the sacred way at the end of the tablet from Hipponion (L 1), since Rhadamanthys is an infernal judge.As far as L 16m14 is concerned, its nature is uncertain. It is made of silver, and some authors classify it with the Orphic gold tablets.15 However, it is not clear whether the Girl (\u001c\u000b\r\u0016) refers to Hera, follow-ing a parallel in Pausanias:16In ancient Stymphalos, they say that Hera was raised by Temenos, who called her by three surnames (among which is that of Girl).an inscription, found in Pella, cf.

Nevertheless by looking collectively at all the scarce references to this question we may put together a partial but coherent picture of what the initiates believed.We will begin by assembling all the mentions of the soul’s \u0002 nal destiny:a) In the tablet from Hipponion, once the soul has answered the guardians and drunk the water of Mnemosyne, it is prophesied (L 1, 15 f.)So that, once you have drunk, you too will go by the sacred wayby which the other mystai and bacchoi advance, glorious.b) In the tablet from Entella, once the same conditions have been established, there is mention of “passwords” (L 2, 19) followed by a portion of the text that is practically destroyed. On the basis both of the remains of the letters in the last lines, and of the parallel references to passwords in one tablet from Pherai (L 13), where they are uttered in the presence of Brimo (that is, before Persephone), we have suggested that it may also allude to Persephone.c) In the tablet from Petelia, after mention of the same conditions, we \u0002 nd the af\u0002 rmation (L 3, 11):and afterwards you will reign with the other heroes.d) In two instances a thiasos in the netherworld is mentioned: in L 8, 2 the thiasos is on the right side; in L 13a, 1 the reference is to an initiates’ thiasos.BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 16910/31/2007 9:29:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170 chapter ninee) In the tablet from Pelinna, after the soul has been informed that it has just been born as it dies and that Bacchus has liberated it, and once the formula of the animal fallen into the milk has been reiterated, we \u0002 nd the statement (L 7a, 7):You have wine, happy privilege,and you will go under the earth, once you have accomplished the same rites as the other happy ones.f ) In one of the tablets from Thurii, after the soul has been congratu-lated for having undergone a great experience (L 8, 3), it is assured (L 8, 5):You have been born a god, from the man that you were.Once the formula of the kid fallen into the milk has been mentioned, we \u0002 nd the following conclusion (L 8, 5 f.):Hail, hail, take the path to the righttowards the sacred meadows and groves of Persephone.g) In another tablet from Thurii, once the soul has declared, in the presence of Persephone and the other gods, that it is arriving in a pure state and that it belongs to the race of the gods, there is men-tion of exit from the circle, achieving the crown, and reaching the lap of the goddess. We then encounter the prophecy (L 9, 9):Happy and fortunate one, you will be a god, from the mortal you were.The tablet closes with the formula of the kid fallen into the milk.h) In two other tablets from Thurii, once the same declaration of purity and belonging to the lineage of the gods has been set forth before Persephone and the other gods, the soul af\u0002 rms that it has paid the punishment for its impious acts, and adds (L 10a,b, 6 f.):Now I come as a suppliant before chaste Persephoneto see if, benevolent, she may send me to the dwelling of the limpid ones.This phrase agrees with the tablet from Amphipolis (L 16n), in which the initiate declares herself to be “limpid”.i) In the tablet from Rome (L 11, 3), when only the declaration of purity has been reiterated, someone personally assures the believer:BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17010/31/2007 9:29:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" the soul’s final destiny. results and conclusions 171Come, Caecilia Secundina, legitimately transformed into a goddess.j) Finally, in one from Pherai, once the initiate has uttered the pass-wordAndricepaedothyrsus. Andricepaedothyrsus Brimo, Brimo,he is urged to (L 13)Enter the sacred meadow, since the initiate is free from punishment.We should ask whether it is possible to reconstruct a common scheme on the basis of all these mentions.1 Before doing so, however, we should review the conditions which the mystes must meet in order to accede to his new condition.9.2. Previous conditionsThe tablets require that the mystes ful\u0002 ll certain conditions, some during life, before the soul arrives in the underworld, and others in the course of his post mortem voyage.Among the conditions that must be ful\u0002 lled during life, \u0002 rst and foremost is that of belonging to a select group, to which one is admitted through initiation. This admission constitutes a determinate experience, probably ecstatic, which transforms the subject into a “bacchos” (cf. L 1, 16 “the other mystai and bacchoi”). Correlatively, as we shall see, the initiate is also integrated into a select group in the other world (cf. L 3, 11, “with the other heroes”).2 Both the initiation and the ecstatic experi-ence seem to imply a knowledge of the soul’s situation—in reality, it is the daughter of Earth and of starry Heaven—as well as an awareness of its prior guilt, for which a punishment has been paid (cf. L 10, 4 “I have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious acts”).Participation in speci\u0002 c rites also seems to have been a necessary prerequisite (cf. L 7a, 8 “once you have accomplished the same rites as the other happy ones”). It is never made explicit in what such rites consisted, but it seems likely that in addition to initiatory rites, the soul 1 Pace Edmonds (2004), who considers that every tablet belongs to a different religious group, but cf.

L 10, 4 “I have paid the punishment . . .”), and the achievement of ritual purity. Purity must be maintained, and the initiate was probably subject to speci\u0002 c taboos or prohibitions throughout his or her life. In solidarity with the group to which it belongs, the initiate’s soul therefore declares that it has kept itself pure (cf. verse 1 of L 9–10 “I come, pure from among the pure, pure”), and that it aspires to be part in the other world of a select group of souls, which are also pure (L 10, 7 “to see if, benevolent, she may send me to the dwelling of the limpid ones”).So much for the conditions that must be carried out during one’s lifetime. Regarding those that must be carried out during the eschato-logical journey, we can list the following:In the \u0002 rst place, one must have traveled the right road when arriv-ing in the underworld (on the right, avoiding the temptations of the shining cypress tree and the lake of Forgetfulness).In the second place, one must have given the correct answer to the guardians that keep watch over the fountain of Mnemosyne. “I am the son of Earth and starry Heaven”: an answer that serves to identify the mystes, and a demonstration that he knows the sacred story that sustains his belief. The mention of the new mystical name for the ini-tiate, Asterius in L 4, 9, which implies his separation from his earthly race, refers to the same divine ancestry.In the third place, and as a consequence, one must have drunk the water of Mnemosyne (L 1–4), by means of which one is supposed to maintain knowledge of initiation in the other world, and perhaps the memory of past experiences in previous lives as well.In the fourth place, the soul must travel the sacred way (L 1, 16) that brings it before Persephone. This goddess has the last word con-cerning the soul’s destiny in the other world, but there is another god who plays an important role in this decision: Dionysus, since the soul must previously have been liberated by Bacchus (L 7a 2), hence in L 16n the dead woman from Amphipolis declares herself consecrated to Dionysus Bacchius.3 Martín Hernández (2006) 477 suggests that the Orphic rite described in P. Derveni col. VI is a cleansing of a miasma.BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17210/31/2007 9:29:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" the soul’s final destiny. results and conclusions 173Finally, in the presence of Persephone, the deceased must undergo a new test. The tablets from Thurii and Pherai differ on this point. We will therefore examine them separately.In the tablets from Thurii, the soul refers in the presence of Perse-phone to its conditions of purity (L 9–10), and alludes to aspects of what we could call the soul’s great experience, and its mystic history (cf. L 8, 3):a) Acknowledgement of a divine origin (L 9, 3: “Since I, too, boast that I belong to your blessed race”).b) Awareness of the existence of prior guilt and of the punishment that must be paid for it, namely, a painful cycle of reincarnations. The soul declares itself to be \u0002 nally at the end of this process, and therefore liberated (L 10, 4: “I have paid the punishment correspond-ing to impious acts”; L 9, 5: “I \u0003 ew forth from the painful cycle of deep sorrow”; cf. L 7, 2: “Tell Persephone that Bacchus himself has liberated you”).c) Experience of a rite of passage, de\u0002 ned as being struck by lightning (L 9, 4: “but fate subdued me, and he that wounds from the stars with lightning”, and 10, 5: “either fate subdued me, or else he who makes the lightning blaze forth”).d) The belief that if Persephone yields to the prayer, and victory has been achieved in a dif\u0002 cult trial, symbolized by the “crown” (L 9, 6: “I launched myself with agile feet after the longed-for crown”).4e) The interpretation of the passage to the underworld as a rebirth in the bosom of the mother goddess (L 9, 7: “I plunged beneath the lap of my lady, the subterranean queen”), which signi\u0002 es the achievement of a divine status (L 9, 9: “happy and fortunate, you will be a god, from the mortal that you were”).5 The formula of the animal fallen into the milk emphasizes the mystes’ identi\u0002 cation with the god, and his rebirth to a new, happy life.We understand that the entire process of the passage post mortem (that is, death and underworld journey) is alluded to in L 8, 3, in the phrase 4 The crown has, however, manifold symbolic values, cf. § 4.5.b.5 Similar declarations appear in the Carmen aureum 71 and in Emped. fr. 102 Wright (= B 112 D.–K.).BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17310/31/2007 9:29:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"174 chapter nine“after having had an experience such as you never had before”, the great experience of liberation and the transfer to a new life.In contrast, in one tablet from Pherai (L 13), the encounter with Persephone seems to have been reduced to the passwords (\u000b\fμ\r\u0006\u000e\u000f), consisting in a couple of mystical phrases (cf. also the obscure reference to the \u000b\fμ\r\u0006\u000e\u000f in the tablet from Entella L 2, 19), and in the other (L 13a) the mystes addresses a prayer to the goddess. We do not know whether both schemes coincide, that is, if the passwords from Pherai and Entella correspond to be the last stage before accession to the meadow of the blessed, or if, on the contrary, both schemes correspond to substantial variants in beliefs about the soul’s itinerary.9.3. The scenario of the happy lifeThe ultimate destination of the soul is clearly a sacred place in the underworld; cf. above all L 7, 7:and you will go under the earth, once you have accomplished the same rites as the other happy ones.It is imagined as a meadow:L 8, 5–6: Hail, hail, take the path to the right towards the sacred meadows and groves of Persephone.L 13: Enter into the sacred meadow, since the initiate is free from punishment.This place is reserved for habitation by those who are in a state of ritual purity:L 10, 7: to see if, benevolent (sc. Persephone), she may send me to the dwelling of the limpid ones.Synesius also speaks of a meadow of the pure (Hymn. 3, 394 ff.):weaving you this crown6 from the meadows of the pure.There are other passages in which the blessed are presented as living in a meadow in the other world:6 On crowns, cf. § 4.5.BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17410/31/2007 9:29:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" the soul’s final destiny. results and conclusions 175Pind. fr. 129, 3 Maehl.:7 in meadows of purple roses.Pherecr. fr. 114 Kassel-Austin: in a meadow fruitful with lotus \u0003 owers.Aristoph.

In a series of passages possibly in\u0003 uenced by Orphism, we are told that the judges pronounce their de\u0002 nitive sentence in the meadow from which two paths leave, one towards the Island of the Blessed, the other to Tartarus;10 or that the souls must remain in a meadow for seven days, before they march towards Necessity and the Parcae to learn their des-tiny;11 or else the enclosure of the pious is described,12 full of crystalline fountains and \u0003 owering meadows; the initiates participate in sacred ceremonies and philosophical symposia; they celebrate plays, choruses, musical performances, and banquets. Nevertheless, the philosopher has innovated13 by transforming the meadow into the place where the judgment of the souls is held, which as we have already indicated does not seem to be an originally Orphic theme.14Many texts associate the meadow with the underworld goddess,15 so that the mention of the meadow evokes an encouraging picture, whose relation with Persephone is obvious. 7 A fragment that is probably of Orphic ancestry (OF 439). 8 Quoted in extenso in § 3.3. 9 On this question, cf.

A.D.). This author, highly in\u0003 uenced by Orphism, describes the happy realm of the god-dess as a pleasant place with woods and meadows:17Nor will tender meadowsbe lacking ; there, beneath softer zephyrs,immortal \u0003 owers, which even your Etnadid not produce, exhale their fragrance.In the dense woods, there is even a wealthy treewith boughs resplendent, bent by the green metal.Comparison with other testimonies from Greek literature helps us to identify where the meadows and woods to which the initiates aspire might be situated.18 In the Odyssey, Proteus predicts the destiny of Menelaus in Elysium, at the ends of the earth. Hesiod also places the heroes of Troy in the Isles of the Blessed, a place to which Plato also refers.19 To these testimonies we can also add those concerning the “sacred way”.20 However, the equivalence between these places and the meadows and woods of Persephone is not absolute.

They may be compared, although they are not identical, with the Isles of the Blessed, the Elysian Fields, or the dominions of Kronos, the \u0002 nal resting-place of the fortunate in other landscapes of Greek literature. This will be the \u0002 nal place where the initiate will enjoy eternal bless-edness.9.4. Characteristics of the afterlifeThe tablets mention a series of bene\u0002 ts which the souls of initiates enjoy:1) In the \u0002 rst place, the initiate is free from punishment, the implica-tion being that the non-initiate is not (cf. L 1, 16).2) Secondly, the possession of wine as a privilege. This comes close to the situation ridiculed by Plato (Resp. 363cd) as “perpetual intoxi-cation”.3) There is also mention of the achievement of “happiness” (\u001e\u000e\r\u0011\u0006\u0007, L 7a, 7, L 9, 9), a complex concept that we do not know whether to de\u0002 ne as a kind of “material well-being” or as a deeper feeling.4) Finally, the achievement of glory is also mentioned (cf. L 1, 16 “they advance, glorious”). All these conditions are coherent with the sense of “triumph” that underlies the mention of the crown (L 9, 6 “I launched myself with agile feet after the long-desired crown”). Once the hard trial of life or lives in this world has been endured, and after the constant training of the man who leads an ascetic life, the soul achieves the crown of triumph. After his victory in the \u0002 nal trial, it is glorious and happy and celebrates in an eternal banquet.5) As far as the condition acquired by the soul is concerned, it is de\u0002 ned in various ways. Sometimes the soul is assured that it will be transformed into a “hero” (L 2, 2; L 3, 11), a transformation of the traditional heroic status, which belonged to those who had 21 On the iconography of the garden of the Beyond, cf. Cabrera (1998).BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17710/31/2007 9:29:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"178 chapter ninedistinguished themselves by their wartime deeds.22 At other times, it is foretold that the soul “will reign” (L 3, 11), so that, since it is a reign that is shared with a group (“you will reign with the other heroes, L 3, 11), we suppose that nothing is meant other than that the soul has freed itself from all subjugation. Finally, the soul’s new state is de\u0002 ned alternatively as “being transformed into a god” (cf. L 8, 5: “You have been born a god, from the mortal that you were”, L 9, 9: “Happy and fortunate, you will be a god, from the mortal that you were”,23 and L 11, 3: “Come, Caecilia Secundina, legiti-mately transformed into a goddess”). However, we may doubt that this phrase is to be taken literally, since divinization was exceptional in the Greek religious world,24 and only in the Hellenistic period was the dei\u0002 cation of the dead integrated into the framework of the of\u0002 cial religion, but as a privilege reserved for sovereigns. We must imagine that the situation achieved by the initiate after his libera-tion and de\u0002 nitive death, variously represented as a rebirth in the bosom of the chthonic goddess (L 9, 7), as a divine kid suckled by her in its happy new life (L 7a, 5; L 9–10) and as an identi\u0002 cation with Dionysus,25 is a glorious new life in the other world, which although it is not perhaps completely equal to that of the gods, implies a stage above the human condition and the acquisition of a superhuman status.26 This status is synonymous with that of “hero”. The group of privileged is de\u0002 ned as a thiasos in the underworld (L 8, 2 and L 13a, 1).22 Di Benedetto (2004) 294 considers that \u001f\u0003\u0014\u000b\u000b with μ\u0002\u0018\u0014 and dative in L 3, 11 does not indicate status of \u0010\u0003\u000f!, but dominance over the other \b\t\u0002\u0007, cf. Tortorelli Ghidini (2006) 126 f. 23 Scarpi (1987) 200 ff. has pointed out the difference in the use of tenses: “you will be a god” projects dei\u0002 cation into the future, as opposed to “you are already a god” right now, as a consummated fact, perhaps the result of an experience never before undergone.24 Cf. the reference in Hdt. 4, 94 to the followers of Zalmoxis.25 We recall that the initiated are \r\u0014\"#\u0006\u0011 in L 1, 16, whereas the god is \r\u0014\"#\u0011\u0006\u0007 in L 7a, 2. Tortorelli Ghidini (2006) 127 considers that \b\t\u0002\u0007 and \r\u0014##\u0006\u0011 are equivalent because both epithets go from the initiate to Dionysus, and so the god is \b\t\u0007 in the chorus of the woman from Elis (PMG 871, 1 [= Plut. Aet. Gr. 36 p. 299B]) and \r\u0014\"#\u0011\u0006\u0007 in the Pelinna tablet.26 Scarpi (1987) compares it to the situation of men of the race of gold in Hesiod (Op. 109–126), who, when the earth hides their bodies, become demons that are guard-ians of justice and givers of wealth.BERNABE_f11_168-178.indd 17810/31/2007 9:29:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE CENTRAL QUESTION: ARE THE GOLD LEAVES ORPHIC?10.1. Discussions of the religious atmosphere of the tabletsIn 1836, when the \u0002 rst gold leaf, the one from Petelia, was published, scholars of the history of religions considered the existence of Orphism to be an indubitable fact, which is why the tablet was interpreted as Orphic.1 The same thing happened with those that appeared in sub-sequent periods.2The skeptical and hypercritical reaction initiated by Wilamowitz3 cast doubt on the Orphic character of the tablets, and due to his prestige the question was set aside for years.4In spite of everything, not even in the times of the greatest skepti-cism about the existence of Orphics have the tablets been attributed in a convincing way to any other known religious movement, and the usual solution has been to write “Orphic” in quotation marks.There has, however, been an effort, on the part of Pugliese Car-ratelli,5 to separate two types of tablets that supposedly derive from two distinct religious environments:a) Those in which Mnemosyne gives instructions based on memory and in the formula of recognition “I am the son of Earth and of starry Heaven”, and whose goal is to travel “the sacred way by which the other mystai and bacchoi advance, glorious”. There is no allusion 1 Franz (1836) 149 f. Comparetti (1910) 36 thinks that one should read “wrote this” at the end of the tablet, and that the subject would be Orpheus.2 Dieterich (1893) and Harrison (19223) considered them Orphic, and they were edited as such by Comparetti (1910) and Olivieri (1915).3 Particularly Wilamowitz (1931).4 It is signi\u0002 cant that Linforth (1941) does not even mention them, although he gives a meticulous analysis of the Orphic testimonies. Cf., in the same sense, Dodds (1951) and Zuntz (1971). In West’s entire book on the Orphic poems, they scarcely receive more than a couple of allusions, and the comment “we have no warrant for calling the gold leaves themselves Orphic” (West [1983] 26).5 Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 11 ff., (2001) 17 ff., (2003) 10 ff.BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 17911/7/2007 5:53:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"180 chapter tenin them to a divine state, nor, it is claimed, is there any mention of Persephone, Eucles, Eubouleus or the other immortal gods, but only of the “king of the underworld”.6 Pugliese Carratelli calls them “Mnemosynian”, and thinks they are Pythagorean.b) Those that deal with Persephone and other chthonic gods, and whose formula is more generic: “I come from among the pure, pure”. Here, the initiate insists on the fact that he has overcome terrible trials and on expiation, but there is no allusion to the fountain of Mnemosyne. The goal of the soul’s passage is its transformation into a god. These tablets are considered Orphic.In our opinion, it is not possible to separate the religious scheme of different tablets, since there is overlap between the two groups. “Mystes and bacchoi” are mentioned in L 1, 16, but they have little to do with the Pythagoreans, whose god is Apollo, and a great deal to do with the Bacchic mysteries of the Orphics. Bacchus and Persephone appear together in L 7, 2,7 while in L 11 we \u0002 nd the queen of the subterranean beings (that is, Persephone), and Eucles and Eubouleus, mentioned in the tablets from Thurii, together with Mnemosyne, the protagonist of the “Mnemosynians”.8 At the end of L 2, 19–21 some letters are read that could be interpreted as part of a reference to Persephone by name.9For all these reasons, it seems most likely that although the vari-ous types of text refer to different moments of the soul’s journey (on which cf. § 10.3) and to various functions, the authors of the tablets and their users belong to the same religious movement, characterized by the belief in a special destiny for the initiate’s soul.10 Riedweg gives 6 His argument is based on a reading of L 1, 11 \u0002\u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u000b \f\r\u000e\u000b\u000f\u0010\u0011, that differs from the one we have followed, \u0002\u0003\u0007\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u000b \f\r\u000e\u000b\u000f\u0012\t<\r\u000b>, proposed by West (1975) 233 and also accepted by Riedweg (1998). 7 Musti (1984) 63 ff., Scalera McClintock (1991) 397, Tortorelli Ghidini (1995b) 472 f., Riedweg (1996) 447, (1998) 387, Bernabé (2000b) 56, Morand (2001) 224; cf. the excellent study by Graf (1993) 250 f., who distinguishes the tablets only from a formal viewpoint; cf. in the same sense Albinus (2000) 141. 8 Nor is Mnemosyne alien to the Orphics, since she is mentioned in Orph.

Such knowledge and authority could only be attributed to someone who has visited Hades.We must exclude the possibility of an infernal divinity, because the most important ones are mentioned in the tablets in the third person. If it were Persephone, for instance, who was speaking, we would expect such expressions as “tell me that Bacchus liberated you”, rather than “tell Persephone that Bacchus has liberated you” (L 7, 2).With regard to the possibility that it may be someone who has visited the underworld, the most adequate framework is a type of eschatological poetry, which usually assumes the form of a #\r\u001a\u0017\f\r\u000e\u000b\u0015, spoken in the \u0002 rst person by someone who is said to have gone down to Hades. The subjects of this poetry are the geography of Hades, the soul’s liberation from the cycle of metempsychosis and the special destiny reserved for initiates.18 Various personages in the Greek mythic tradition undertook a journey to the subterranean realm: the best known are Odysseus, The-seus, Pythagoras, Heracles, and Orpheus. Of these, however, Orpheus was the only poet, and the only katabatic hero to whom poetry on the theme of the afterlife was ascribed. In particular a hexametric poem was transmitted under his name entitled Descent to Hades.19At an early date scholars suggested that these texts be attributed to Orpheus.20 The period of Orpheo-scepticism led to the question’s being set aside for many years. Recently, however, several authors21 have once again defended the view that the speaker is none other than the mythical Orpheus.The fact that the name of Orpheus never appears in the tablets is not a suf\u0002 cient argument to deny that the texts were attributed to the 18 Cf. Riedweg (2002).19 The author of Orph. Arg. 40–42 refers to a work of this type attributed to Orpheus. Clem. Alex.

To cite better-known parallels, neither Parmenides nor Empedocles mention their names in poems that have many points of contact, above all formal, with the katabatic literature. In these conditions, then, who could be a better candidate for authorship of the tablets than Orpheus, the mythical Thracian bard, visitor of the infernal regions, revealer of matters of the Beyond, presumed author of a corpus of literature on these themes, and transmitter of the \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t in which information useful for confronting death is offered?10.3. The Geography of the tabletsA second argument concerns the places in which tablets have been found, including South Italy, Thessaly-Macedonia, Crete, Achaia and Lesbos.22 The majority of these places have a speci\u0002 c connection with Orpheus or with Orphism, either because some episode of the myth of Orpheus was situated there, or because other documents of an Orphic character have appeared there. We shall cite only a few examples.In south Italy, numerous Apulian ceramics portray Orpheus in the infernal world (cf. § 10.7).Several places in Macedonia have speci\u0002 c connections with Orpheus.23 These include one of the most important Orphic documents, the Derveni Papyrus. According to Conon, Orpheus denied women access to the mysteries he had instituted in the Macedonian town of Libethra,24 which was his home, according to the Orphic Argonautica25 and other sources. There was an image of Orpheus in that city.26 Another Macedonian city, Dion, claimed to be the scene of the poet’s death.27Orpheus’ connections with Crete are numerous and explicit.28 Thus, Diodorus maintains that the Orphic \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t have their origin there,29 22 Cf. § 0.2.

B.C., which comes from a temple of the Magna Mater,30 has clear Orphic resonances, as do a few verses from the Cretenses of Euripides, in which priests appear with all the characteristic features of the Orphics.31As far as Lesbos is concerned, several authors who deal with the myth of Orpheus from the Hellenistic period on, such as Phanocles, Virgil, Ovid, Conon, and Lucian,32 told how the head of Orpheus was cast into the Thracian river Hebros or into the sea, and journeyed to Lesbos, where it received honors and continued to dictate poems or oracles. We also \u0002 nd the theme in \u0002 gurative representations.33 In addition, archaic poetry testi\u0002 es to relations between Lesbos and Thrace, the mythical homeland of Orpheus: Alcaeus, in a fragment of a poem that may perhaps have dealt with Orpheus,34 praised the river Hebros as the most beautiful of rivers and mentioned the location of its mouth next to the town of Aenus. It is possible that Aenus, a colony of Mytilene, was the starting point for Orpheus’ connection with Lesbos.Finally it must be remembered that in addition to these coincidences between the location of the tablets and myths about Orpheus, the tablets show thematic continuity despite their wide separation in space and time. This excludes the possibility that we are dealing with local religious movements. Instead, they suggest a coherent, albeit dispersed, religious orientation, persistent in time and not integrated with of\u0002 cial religion. All these features are congruent with Orphism and not with any other known movement.30 Guarducci (1939) I XXIII 3, Colli (19813) 4 [B 20] p. 216 ff., Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 46, (2001) 86 ff., (2003) 87 ff., Tortorelli Ghidini (2000) 40 f., Tzifopoulos (2002) 164 ff., Martínez Fernández (2006) n. 23, pl. 38.31 Eur.

Belonging to a mystery ambience10.4.1. References to initiationThe religious movement to which the tablets belong is mystical, as is made evident by the direct and indirect references to initiation. In L 1, 16, we read that the initiates (\u001e&\u000e\u001a\r\u000b) and bacchoi advance in their glory along a path that leads to happiness in the afterlife. The knowledge of certain “passwords” (\u000e&\u001e\f\u0007\u000f\r) enables the initiate of L 13 to accede to a meadow that represents eternal well-being. In L 16b–e, the deceased identi\u0002 es himself as a \u001e&\u000e\u001a\u001f\u0015, certainly in order to be identi\u0002 ed by Persephone. There are various Orphic passages35 where \u001e&\u000e\u001a\u001f\u0015 or the middle-passive participles \u001e,)\u001e\u0012\b\u0007\u0015, \u001e,\u001f\u0006\u0012\t\u0015 or \u001e\u0012\u001e,\u001f\u001e+\b\u0007\u0015 appear in a similar context, in which initiation is connected with a way of life subject to rigid prescriptions and the ful\u0002 llment of rituals that provide access to a happy existence after death. It is, more-over, signi\u0002 cant that in some of these examples36 the terms \u001e&\u000e\u001a\u001f\u0015 and \f\u0017-\u0005\u0007\u0015 appear together, as they do in L 1, 16.37The mention of the sacred way in L 1, 15–16 constitutes an indirect reference to initiation, which con\u0002 rms the mystical character of these texts, since this path can be conceived as a repetition of the path of initiation in this world, or perhaps as a projection of the terrestrial model.38 We ought not to forget that in the Hipponion tablet the sacred way is reserved for \u001e&\u000e\u001a\r\u000b -\r. \f\u0017-\u0005\u0007\u000b, since it is initiation that guarantees the promise of happiness in the Beyond.The “experience” mentioned in L 8, 3 may be considered another indirect reference to initiation. As we saw in § 3.3, the experience alluded to is the preparation for death that is acquired with initiation, and its result is the initiate’s state of blessedness, which consists in his identi\u0002 cation with the god. As far as we know, such a conception of initiation is found only in Orphism.3935 Heraclit. fr. 87 Marcovich (= B 14 D.-K.) (OF 587), Eur. Cret. fr. 472 Kannicht (OF 567), P. Derveni col. VI 8 f.

The importance of doctrinal knowledgeWhy should the tablets be ascribed precisely to Orphism, when it is not the only mystical movement in Greece, although it is one of the most important ones we know? In the Dionysiac and Eleusinian cults, the initiate participates in an initiatory rite that familiarizes him with the divinity and its vicissitudes, but he does not acquire knowledge that transforms him. On the other hand, Orphism can be de\u0002 ned as a mys-teriosophic religion,40 since the Orphic \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t are oriented towards the acquisition of eschatological knowledge that enables initiates, and only initiates, to know the nature of the soul, its situation in the world, and how to liberate it from its mortal condition. This practice is summed up in the introductory verse to the Orphic Hieroi logoi, of which we know two variants:41a) I will sing for those of understanding: close your doors, ye profane.b) I will speak for those entitled: close your doors, ye profane.Only the initiates know what is necessary for salvation. And only it is permitted to them to acquire the knowledge offered by Orphic poetry and its interpretation.In the tablets, the emphasis on knowledge can be noted in various details: a) Mnemosyne is the divinity who presides over the universe of the tablets; b) the insistence on the truth; c) the questions of the guard-ians, whose mission is to prevent those who cannot answer them from approaching the place of blessedness; and d) the passwords (\u000e&\u001e\f\u0007\u000f\r) the mystai must give as a proof that they know the truth.42a) In the tablets, Mnemosyne43 is pro\u0002 led as the divinity who protects souls and guides them on their journey: through her agency the initi-ate is able to keep the initiatory ritual present in his mind. By merely remembering what he has learned in the initiation, the soul of the deceased will be able to get through the test to which it is subjected in the other world with \u0003 ying colors and achieve a happy life with the status of a /\u0013\u0015.b) When, in L 4, 7, the initiate is asked to tell precisely the entire truth to the guardians of the lake of Mnemosyne so that they may let 40 Bianchi (1965) 154 f., 167 f.41 OF 1ab.

The insistence on the truth presupposes the existence of an initiatory revelation: they must have acquired the knowledge of this truth previously, during life, and it is not shared by everyone, but is possessed only by initiates.c) The various passwords consigned to the tablets, and the phraseol-ogy that alludes to the condition of the soul of the deceased and the circumstances of the passage to the Beyond are a clear example of the fact that the teachings of the initiation are indispensable for overcom-ing the underworld passage. It seems logical that the faithful should be indoctrinated in these teachings during their ritual experiences, where they will learn and repeat them. Most of them acquire their full mean-ing in the light of other Orphic fragments, and only in that light. Let us brie\u0003 y recall the phrases that mark the various stages of the initiate’s infernal journey. Before the guardians, he must, in order that they may grant him access to the lake of Mnemosyne, declareI am the son of Earth and starry Heaven,which presupposes the declaration of belonging to a mystical (+\b\u0007\u0015, and recalls man’s Titanic origin.44 Added to this in some tablets is an additional reference, by which the initiate renounces his personal name, a symbol of life in this world, and eliminates any doubt concerning the soul’s heavenly origin.45The initiate faces still more trials. First, he declares his thirst, and requests the water of Mnemosyne:46I am dry with thirst and dying. Give me, then, right away,fresh water to drink from the lake of Mnemosyne.He thus demonstrates that he has been initiated, for two reasons: because he is still thirsty (which indicates that he has not drunk from the other fountain), and because he knows he must drink from the fountain of Mnemosyne.44 Cf. § 1.6.45 “My name is Asterius”, L 4, 9, “my race is heavenly”; L 2, 15; L 3, 7; “I too boast to belong to your blessed race”, L 9–10a, 3.

In the tablets from Thurii, and, with some variations, in that of Rome,47 someone solemnly declares:I come from among the pure, pure.48Ritual purity turns out to be indispensable. For it enables the divini-ties to recognize the deceased as an initiate, and thus is allowed the domain of the pure.49In L 9, 5 the deceased declares before the infernal divinities:I \u0003 ew forth from the painful cycle of deep sorrow.The interpretation of the -&-\u000f\u0007\u0015 as the cycle of births and deaths not only has parallels in the Orphic fragments, but also helps us to understand the phraseology of guilt and punishment that follows a consistent scheme in other tablets.50 According to the tablets, human beings carry along with them a guilt that must be paid in order for one to be liberated:I have paid the punishment (\u0003\u0007\u000b\b\u0014) that corresponds to impious acts (\u0019\u0013(\b 0\b\u0012-\r \u00071\u001a\u000b !\u000b-\r<\t>\b).51Payment and liberation are achieved by means of the \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\u0014, since in L 13 it is speci\u0002 ed that the initiate in the mysteries (\u001e&\u000e\u001a\u001f\u0015) is free from punishment (2\u0003\u0007\u000b\b\u0007\u0015), which in turn implies that those who are not initiated will be punished. We must suppose that this is a general punishment of the entire human species, which the tablet L 9, 5 de\u0002 nes as a terrible cycle from which only the initiates are able to liberate themselves. The only relation known between guilt and the punishment paid through \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\u0014 and exit from a cycle is that connected with Orphic \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\u0014, in which the guilt is caused by the Titanic sin, the punishment (among others) is metempsychosis, and the cycle from which one must liberate oneself is that of births. Once again, the phraseology of the tablets is similar to that of the other Orphic texts, cf. § 4.2.47 Cf. § 4.1.48 On the possibility of reading 3- -\r[\u0006\r\u00134\b in the Gurôb Papyrus col.

Thus, Orphism provides a solid context for a coherent interpretation of the crown in the tablet from Thurii.At the end of L 7, we read:You have wine, a happy privilege.52The image illustrating the delights of the Beyond as a banquet in which wine cannot be lacking is not exclusive to Orphism,53 nor are the ritual use of wine and funeral libations. Yet Orphism is the mystery religion that offers the best parallels for an adequate interpretation of the men-tion of wine in the tablets. The particular connotations for the Orphics of the wine used in the ritual would explain its use in funeral libations, as well as its presence in descriptions of post-mortem blessedness.54 Wine transcends the limits of ritual practice, to become a key symbol of the Orphic doctrine of salvation.10.4.3. Reconstruction of a hieros logosThe underlying structure of the texts in the tablets also re\u0003 ects the importance of the doctrinal knowledge contained in them. In § 12.3, we will see how, on the basis of the totality of the text of the tablets, it is possible to reconstruct a hieros logos.

As we have seen, the concept of knowledge is intrinsic to the nature of the Orphic \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t, whereas in Dionysiac cult the initiate participates in rites that famil-iarize him with the god and his vicissitudes, but he does not acquire knowledge that transforms him. In the Classical period, no extant literature is ascribed to the Dionysiac religion; Euripides’ Bacchai may re\u0003 ect cultic reality, but it is not a book created to accompany rituals.57 Some of the later testimonies that are adduced as examples of Bacchic literature are linked in one way or another to Orpheus or to Orphism. This is the case for the sacred tale mentioned in the Papyrus of Ptolemy Philopator58 or for the titles Bacchica and Teletai of Dionysus attributed to Arignote,59 of which we know only passages that in some case are connected with Orphic rites.10.5. Purity and justiceThe initiates who seek a place in the locus amoenus declare that they are in a special state of purity.60 We \u0002 nd this same demand for purity as the condition of a better destiny in the Beyond in texts that are unquestionably Orphic, such as the Rhapsodies, where it is contrasted with the state of those who have worked against justice:6155 Jiménez San Cristóbal (2002b).56 The de\u0002 nition is that of Bianchi (1974) 131 (= [1977] 189); cf.

The same association and contraposition of concepts is found well before in Plato, who af\u0002 rms ironically that Musaeus and his son (i.e. Orpheus) reward the just (!7-\r\u000b\u0007\u0015) with a banquet of the pious (8\u000e\t\b), crowned and inebriated, the same prize which, as we have seen, awaits the initiates of L 7.

In an ancient Orphic theogony, she appears as a goddess, the companion of Zeus who watches over the injustices of men so that Zeus may punish them,64 while in a passage from a judicial speech, one of the litigants quoting Orpheus tries to in\u0003 uence the jury’s vote by referring the deci-sion to the vigilance of Justice over the unjust.65The scheme presented by the tablets also re\u0003 ects a link between ritual purity and justice (!\t-\u001f) and the cultic practice we \u0002 nd clearly developed in Orphism.66 To be just is equivalent to being without pun-ishment, 2\u0003\u0007\u000b\b\u0007\u0015, as the initiate declares in L 13.

The gods in the tablets and in other Orphic textsThe presentation of the gods in the tablets shows a number of similari-ties to that found in other Orphic texts.6810.6.1. First-born gods and elementsIn the Great Tablet from Thurii, the First-Born (Heaven), Mother Earth, and the daughter of Demeter are mentioned; then Zeus, Dionysus, Demeter and Nestis-Kore are identi\u0002 ed with the four elements, and in what follows, Night and Day appear as the basic components of the temporal sequence. We have seen how all this is also found in other works of the Orphic tradition,69 and that the tablet can be understood only in this light.10.6.2. MoiraIn L 9 and 10, we \u0002 nd a reference to Moira, who is practically identi-\u0002 ed with Zeus, and in § 4.3 we commented that such an identi\u0002 cation was found in such Orphic texts as the Derveni Papyrus, col. XVIII f. or in Orphic Hymn 59, 13.10.6.3. PersephoneFor Homer, the principal authority on the Olympic religion, Perse-phone is a divinity characterized by the vagueness of her features, habitually described only as terrible and unpleasant. He mentions her seven times,70 in six of which he characterizes her as “awful” (3\u0003\r\u000b\b\u0014), while in the other71 he simply mentions the “groves of Persephone”. In Hesiod, she appears in four passages. One of these seems to be an 67 Plat. Phd. 69c, Gorg. 493a, Resp. 364e, Iulian. Or. 7, 25, Plut. fr. 178 Sandbach.68 For Derveni Papyrus, cf.

She appears (passim) as the Mistress of the underworld. No doubt, she is the “queen of the subterranean beings” (L 1, 13, L 9, 7, L 11, 1 etc.), the same title she receives in Orphic Hymn 29, 6.74 She inhabits the meadow of the blessed (L 8, 6, L 13, in this case with the epithet ?\u0013\u000b\u001eA), and it is to her that the initiate comes as a suppliant (L 10, 6), and to whom his declarations of purity and liberation are addressed (L 9–10, 1). The guardians submit the initiates’ fate to her decision (L 1, 13).75 In L 7, 2 we read:Tell Persephone that Bacchus himself has liberated you.In this declaration, the goddess clearly aligns herself with Dionysus. She decides the fate of the deceased, but Dionysus acts as mediator. In a fragment that is unequivocally Orphic,76 we \u0002 nd that both are men-tioned as liberating gods, with the same function as the one attributed to her in L 7:. . . the happy life, that after having wandered, those who in Orpheus are initiated in Dionysus and Kore, pray to obtain:“to be freed from the cycle and \u0002 nd refuge from misfortune”.The same ideas appear in Pindar,77 who speaks of the liberation of certain souls by Persephone, after having accepted compensation for her “ancient pain” (the death of Dionysus).None of this resembles the “atrocious goddess” of Homer and Hes-iod. It would be appropriate to think of relating the tablets with the 72 Hes. Theog. 768, which also quali\u0002 es her as “awful”.73 Hes. Theog. 913, in an account of the wives and daughters of Zeus, fr. 185, 4 M.-W. of the Eoiai, too destroyed to provide information, and in a papyrus fr. which may belong to the Hesiodic Peirithous’ Descent to the underworld, or to the Minyad (Hes. fr. 280, 19 M.-W. = Minyas fr. 7 Bernabé).74 Cf. similarly, other mentions at L 12, 1 “the Cybelean one, daughter of Demeter”, 5 (Nestis), 8 (The Subterranean Girl [#)\u0013\u001f]), 9 (#)\u0013\u001f).75 In L 16b, the goddess’ attention is attracted, and Posidippus’ condition as an initiate in the mysteries is communicated to her, so that she may guarantee him a favorable position in the Beyond.76 Procl. in Tim.

The principle ones are:a) The association of Persephone with Dionysus, her son in the Orphic tradition, who, as we shall see (§ 10.7.3), is also associated with her in Apulian iconography.b) The fact that the tablets emphasize “liberation” more than the initiate’s visual experience,80 which is characteristic of the Eleusinian rites.c) The fact that the deceased addresses her as “mother”81 in the “great” tablet from Thurii (L 12). We \u0002 nd the same form of address in the Gurôb Papyrus (OF 578),82 which has as its background the Orphic myth of the Dionysiac part of human beings.d) The striking absence of tablets at Athens, the place most intimately related with Eleusis.10.6.4. DionysusDionysus appears in the tablets with various epithets.a) In L 7, 2 Dionysus appears mentioned as ?\u0017-\u0005\u000b\u0007\u0015. In L 16n, the deceased proclaims that she is consecrated to the same god. It is curious that the divinity is called by the name that should be proper to the worshipper, the appropriate name for him ought to be ?\u0017-\u0005\u0007\u0015. In L 1, 16, in contrast, it is the initiates that are called \f\u0017-\u0005\u0007\u000b. There is thus an identi\u0002 cation between the worshipper and the god, so that their appellations become interchangeable.83 He is the one that intercedes before Persephone so that she may liberate the soul of the believer in the tablet from Pelinna. There could be no one more \u0002 tting than Dionysus for the task of indicating to his mother the moment at which a person should be liberated.78 Cf.

It will be found that the universe of the tablets is much closer to that of South Italian iconography than it is to the Homeric one. This relation is relevant because, as is well known, Orpheus forms an important part of the Apulian netherworld imagery.10.7.1. Localization: the abode of the BeyondThe tablets locate Hades, the seat of the dead, in a subterranean world, which they describe as obscure, but also as a building (!)\u001e\u0007\u000b, !4\u001e\r).89 Homer also presents Hades as a subterranean building,90 but there is an essential difference between the “musty and horrible dwelling, which even the gods abhor”, described by Homer,91 and the “well-built” house alluded to in L 1, 2. Apulian ceramics coincide better with the descrip-tion of the tablets, since, as we shall see, they present us with a Hades that is dark (the infernal gods wear torches), but which boasts buildings with elegant columns, an abode worthy of its divine inhabitants.10.7.2. A uniform Hades vs. a dual HadesAnother basic difference between the imagery of the tablets and that of Homer is that Homer’s Beyond is unequivocally unpleasant, whereas the one described by the tablets contains two paths, or two destinies for its inhabitants. There are two springs, that of Mnemosyne, which is frequented only by those who have assimilated the warning given by the author of the sacred text—that is, the initiates—, while the other souls of the dead come to the other spring, which is unnamed environment, which is in all probability Orphic. The arguments developed in this sec-tion may be found adduced there.89 A subterranean place: souls “go down” to it (L 1, 4, and probably L 2, 6) and it is inhabited by “the subterranean queen” (L 1, 13). It is “gloomy” (L 1, 9, L 2, 11) and one reaches it “after abandoning the light of the sun” (L 8, 1). It is described as a building: “dwelling (!)\u001e\u0007\u000b) of Hades” in L 3, 1, L 4, 1. For its part, L 1, 2 adds an epithet of disputed meaning \u00125\u0014\u0013\u0012\r\u0015, but which seems to mean “well-built”. 90 Cf., for instance, Il. 8, 477–481; 22, 482 f.; Od. 24, 203 f.91 Od. 20, 64 f.BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 19611/7/2007 5:53:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" the central question: are the gold leaves orphic? 197but must be that of Forgetfulness.92 There is also a privileged space in Hades, a sacred meadow93 separated from a much more unpleasant and gloomy place, often identi\u0002 ed with Tartarus. However, access to the locus amoenus is controlled by various personages, guardians and Persephone successively. A similar situation may have applied in Ital-ian vase paintings. In an amphora from Vulci, which has now disap-peared, the souls of the initiates may have been represented guarding the fountain of Mnemosyne.94Apulian iconography represents this duality, within the proper limits of iconographical language. On a volute crater from St. Petersburg,95 we see a sumptuous edi\u0002 ce, seat of the infernal monarchs Persephone and Hades. Below it, the Danaids are represented carrying jars of water (presumably in order to try to \u0002 ll vessels that can never be \u0002 lled). In the upper part of the vase, Ixion, tied to the wheel and accompanied by a fury,96 again represents those who are punished in the Beyond. In two other examples, we \u0002 nd Hades and Persephone, outside their naiskos. In one from Saint Petersburg they appear with a fury on the right, whereas the Danaids are represented in the center, below. On another one from Ruvo,97 a fury punished a condemned man, terri\u0002 ed by the “terrors of Hades” before the underworld divinities. The tablets refer to a privileged space, reserved for initiates. Located underground in Hades, it is imagined as a meadow.98 Apulian pottery does not furnish clear images of a happy place, which we could identify with the one referred to in the text. A series of pieces, however, evoke a paradisiacal atmosphere related to Dionysus.9992 Cf. § 1.5.93 L 8, 6: “the sacred meadows and the groves of Persephone”, L 10a, 7: “to see if, benevolent, she may send me to the domain of the limpid ones”; L 13: “enter the sacred meadow, for the initiate is free from punishment”. 94 Cf. § 1.6, n. 120.95 B 1717 (325–310 B.C.)96 On the furies in Apulian ceramics, cf. Aellen (1994) passim.97 Saint Petersburg B 1716 (330–310 B.C.), Ruvo 1094 (360–350 B.C.).98 Cf. § 9.3.99 We refer to the images studied by Cabrera (1998). Of course, other works from the immense Dionysiac iconography are not incompatible with this universe, as for instance the amphora from Basel (S 29), in which we \u0002 nd the miracle of the “automatic” wine (which reminds us of the “wine, fortunate honor” of L 7). On this piece, which came to light in the same tomb as the Orpheus amphora and the dead man with the papyrus roll commented on in App. II n. 2, cf. Schmidt-Trendall-Cambitoglou (1976) 6 and 35 ff., \u0002 g. 8e, 10a. Other examples might include a crater from Tarentum (61.602) on which a woman receives a satyr in a naiskos, as well as the numerous symposiac scenes which may allude to a banquet in the Beyond, including the ones that decorate BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 19711/7/2007 5:53:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"198 chapter tenFurthermore, we may consider the presence of Orpheus or the door opened by Nikê (of which we shall speak later) as symbols of the accession of the initiates to the happy place.10.7.3. Divinities presiding over the BeyondAnother point of contact between the tablets and Apulian ceramics is the image of the gods of the Beyond, very different from the Homeric one. In § 10.6.3, we saw the crucial role of Persephone, who is respon-sible for the ultimate decision concerning the destiny of those who arrive in the underworld. Alongside her, mention is made of Eucles, a name for Hades. This god does not seem to participate directly in the souls’ destiny; he is mentioned only occasionally. We have also seen (§ 10.6.4) that Dionysus, mentioned by various names, appeared as a divine mediator who authorizes the liberation of the deceased’s soul in L 7.It was likewise clear that both Dionysus’ role as a mediator in the liberation of souls, and that of an amenable Persephone, are foreign to the Homeric world and to that of Hesiod. Nevertheless, both features of this vision of the Beyond also appear in the South Italian imaginary.Persephone is the protagonist of the netherworld imagery in most of the Apulian pieces we are studying in this section. She is also the most frequent presence in the pinakes from Locri from the second quarter of the 5th cent. B.C.100 In several of these images, Dionysus is the mediator who substitutes symbolically for the suppliant believer in his arrival at the kingdom of death, when he presents himself before the god’s mother.Dionysus also acts as a divine mediator on an Apulian volute crater in the Museum of Art of Toledo (Ohio).101 Its message is clear: the initiates in the mysteries of Dionysus, the mystai, will obtain special treatment and will \u0002 nd rest from their evils in Hades. This is the same message we encounter in the Orphic tablets.the well-known sarcophagus of the Tuffatore (cf. Warland [1999]). It is obviously hard to demonstrate an Orphic presence in these works, but given the virtual absence of information about a Dionysiac Beyond, it seems much more probable to relate them to the Orphic atmosphere.100 Two of them are studied in the iconographical appendix, cf. App. II n. 3.101 340–330 B.C., also included in App. II n. 6.BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 19811/7/2007 5:53:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" the central question: are the gold leaves orphic? 19910.7.4. Orpheus, the human mediatorAlongside Dionysus, the divine mediator, we often \u0002 nd in Apulian ceramics the presence in Hades of a human mediator, Orpheus. On an Apulian volute crater from the Munich Museum,102 he accompanies a family of initiates before Pluto and Persephone. This crater repre-sents the cosmic order, in which Justice punishes the impious acts of the non-initiates. In accordance with this cosmic con\u0002 guration Queen Persephone and her spouse preside over the subterranean sphere.We \u0002 nd a very similar model in other Apulian craters, such as one from Matera and another from Karlsruhe.103 In another from Naples,104 the same themes are repeated, but without the characteristic represen-tation of a building. Orpheus arrives before Hades and Persephone, and leads a woman by the hand. In the light of the other examples, it seems clear that we must infer that Orpheus is introducing a dead woman to the gods of the Beyond, rather than considering that she is Eurydice.On another crater from Naples,105 we \u0002 nd other characters and per-soni\u0002 cations along with Orpheus, such as Megara, the Poinai, Ananke, Sisyphus, Hermes, Triptolemus, Aeacus or Rhadamanthys. The pres-ence of the 'EFGHF is interesting, in view of the importance of the concept of \u0003\u0007\u000b\b\u0014 in the tablets and in other texts that are Orphic or related to Orphism.106We \u0002 nd a different type on a calyx crater of the British Museum in London.107 At the entrance to Hades, marked by a herm, Orpheus leads Cerberus by a chain, for he has tamed him by his music. He thus assumes the function of a protector who defends a young man standing before him, no doubt an initiate, from the terrors of Hades.10.7.5.

On a red-\u0002 gured Apulian amphora attributed to the Ganymedes painter,108 we see, inside a little white temple or naiskos, very similar to the palace of Persephone represented on other pieces, an old man (the deceased) seated on a portable chair who is visited by Orpheus.109 The most interesting point is that the dead man is holding a papyrus roll in his hand. As to its content, we cannot imagine anything more appropriate than a text of the type we encounter in the tablets. The image makes explicit the value of the text as the depository of the knowledge that Orpheus transmits to the initiates.Similar in many respects, but without the presence of the text, is a Sicilian piece from Leontini,110 on which Orpheus and Hermes appear in a naiskos with a dead woman.This complex of representations seems to reaf\u0002 rm the hypothesis that the text of the tablets was considered a work of Orpheus, as would be the papyrus carried by the dead man on the Basel amphora, so that the Thracian bard would be considered by the users of the tablets as a human mediator who, through initiation, explains the path the souls must follow in order to achieve their salvation. The numerous texts that attribute to Orpheus the \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t, or ideas on the Beyond that are related to them, insist on the same idea.11110.7.6. Nikê and DikêAn interesting variant is offered by a crater from Ruvo,112 on which are represented, alongside Persephone, Hecate and Orpheus, Nikê opening a door, and Dikê or justice. The door opened by Nikê seems to open the way for a dead follower of Orpheus towards a more pleasant place, or towards his own triumph.Nikê and Dikê do not appear mentioned explicitly in the tablets, but their presence is completely coherent within an Orphic atmosphere, and in the tablets there are re\u0003 ections of the same imagery, especially 108 330–320 B.C., cf.

The reservations of Margot SchmidtWe ought, however to consider the arguments of Margot Schmidt, a great specialist of Apulian iconography, who expresses reservations about connecting this iconography with the world of the tablets:114The original inspiration of the netherworld images in Apulian art perhaps must be sought in an epic of religious coloring, or better in religious poetry belonging to a certain cultural level. This poetic background is not necessarily Orphic.Nevertheless, the presence of Orpheus and that of the amphora by the Ganymedes painter lead this scholar to add:We could suppose that the \u0002 gurative creation derived from these sources would have been reused also by followers of some Orphic ideas . . . in the . . . image of the new amphora by the Ganymedes painter . . . we could see an “Orphization” of a more generic prototype.Neither of these two arguments is persuasive. Rather they are perhaps dictated by two prejudices concerning Orphism which now seem to have been superseded, or should be:113 Although the image of the crown is polyvalent in the tablets, simultaneously a funeral crown, a mystical crown, and a crown of banquets and of triumph.

Yet it does not seem appropri-ate to attribute the character of “popular religion” to the subject of belief for people who could afford highly expensive gold tablets, deposited in wealthy tombs, a belief which seems to have been shared by the Sicilian tyrants who hired Pindar.b) That the verses of the tablet are a sub-literature. Riedweg has made an extremely plausible case115 that there is a hieros logos behind them, which would no doubt belong to “an epic of religious tonality” or to a “religious poetry belonging to a speci\u0002 c cultural level”, rather than to a “sub-literature”.There is still a third equivocation that must be argued against. Schmidt considers that the representation of the birth of Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus which we \u0002 nd in Apulian iconography is not Orphic either, since the son of Semele is not Orphic.116 Bernabé has demon-strated that this theme was dealt with in the Rhapsodies and probably before, and it is therefore re\u0003 ected in the corresponding fragments of his edition. Rudhardt has also argued convincingly for the presence of Semele in the Orphic hymns.11710.7.8. Recapitulation of Apulian iconographyWe see that basic features of the Beyond represented in Apulian ico-nography suggest a conceptual universe that is practically identical with the one presented to us by the tablets and other Orphic textual fragments:a) The Beyond is a dark and subterranean place, but well-constructed.b) It is presided over by Persephone, a welcoming and affable goddess, accompanied by Hades.c) It is a dual space, with rewards for the initiates and punishments for those who are not.d) For the punishments, the painters select as paradigms the most notori-ous punished sinners of the mythic tradition, such as Sisyphus, Ixion, 115 Riedweg (2002) cf. § 4.5.116 Schmidt (1975) 133.117 Bernabé (1998c), cf.

The punishments are meted out by the Erinyes or the Furies.e) The rewards are based on proximity to the divine, symbolized by the presence of the mediators.f ) There is a divine mediator, Dionysus, and a human one, Orpheus (represented on the frontier between the palace and the rest of the space, sometimes with the believer).g) On one occasion, we \u0002 nd a representation of the text as evidence for written transmission of Orphic revelations.h) The personi\u0002 cation of Dikê alludes to the fact that the faithful must respect her, for she is the one that gives to each person the retri-bution he/she deserves. The personi\u0002 cation of Victory represents the triumph that the mystes obtains in the Beyond in the form of a privileged status.i) The presence of Orpheus in ceramics, especially in the case of the Basel amphora, in which he appears before an initiate who carries a text, gives particular reinforcement to the hypothesis that the text of the tablets was attributed to Orpheus.The only possible doubt is whether we are justi\u0002 ed in calling “Orphic” this religious continuum we have reconstructed, which might present differences in detail from one place to another. It is obvious, however, that if we do not do so, the explanation becomes more complicated. What other movement could we reconstruct that unites Persephone and Dionysus, with Orpheus as mediator, that has recourse to sacred texts, that presents a Beyond with the possibility of rewards and punish-ments? It is more plausible to think that the texts on which the painters based their imaginary landscape are those used in the \u001a\u0012\u000f\u0012\u001a\r\t, which might include representations of the sacred mystery in the form of a -\r\u001a\u0017\f\r\u000e\u000b\u0015, in a kind of imitatio mortis that prepared the believer for the great experience.The reasons for the discordances—there are few—between the texts and the representations must be seen in the very nature of each medium, one discursive, the other a visual representation, which obliges the painter to represent, condensed within one scene, that to which the texts allude in several episodes, and to visualize some concepts that are hard to translate into images.BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 20311/7/2007 5:53:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 chapter ten10.8. ColophonCompilation of a series of different arguments results in an ensemble that cannot be associated with any other known religious movement, nor can it be arbitrarily segmented, and which, on the other hand, coincides in every point with the image we have today of Orphism: a) the features of the possible author of the tablets, b) their geographical distribution, c) the references to an initiation associated with doctrinal knowledge, d) the phraseology, symbols, and details that other texts relate to Orphism, e) the hieros logos whence they seem to derive, f ) the identi-\u0002 cation of purity and justice, g) the relation between Persephone and Dionysus, h) the idea of liberation from a cycle, and i) the coincidences with south Italian iconography, in which Orpheus is the protagonist.This accumulation of data can, of course, be debated, and we can \u0002 nd similar references to isolated parts of it in other religious environ-ments. On this point, however, we can point out that the problem of the tablets is basically the same as that of Orphism in its totality. Almost none of the features of this religious movement belongs to Orphism alone. The \u0002 gure of Orpheus appears in contexts that are not Orphic; abstinence and transmigration are shared with Pythagoreanism, Bac-chic ecstasy with Dionysism, the idea of Zeus as principle and end of all may be found in such non-Orphic authors as Aeschylus, and there are coincidences with the Eleusinian environment. Yet what seems to us signi\u0002 cant is that although each of these features may perhaps be found in other environments, there exists no other religious movement in which they all coincide. Even at the risk of simplifying matters, it could be said that what does belong to Orphism is the combination of all those elements, or of a large number of them. By accepting this principle as a starting-point, we see that there is a combination of Dionysiac, Pythagorean, and Eleusinian elements in the tablets. The Dionysiac features would include the repeated allusion to Dionysus and the mention of bacchoi and initiates. Well-known elements of Pythago-rean beliefs that appear in the tablets include purity, metempsychosis, and the cycle of reincarnations. The predominance of Persephone resembles the Eleusinian world. The factors mentioned are found, then, both within Orphism and outside it, but as far as we know the combination of all of them is present only in Orphism. The religious scheme of the tablets presents us with the soul of a dead person who, thanks to a life of purity, has liberated himself from a painful cycle of births. It is Dionysus who liberates the soul, but it is Persephone who BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 20411/7/2007 5:53:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" the central question: are the gold leaves orphic? 205must give her ultimate permission for it to reach the happy meadow, in which it is reborn, reintegrated, to a divine or semi-divine state which was its original state.To attribute the imagery of the tablets to the Orphics (with whatever vagueness one wishes to bestow on the term, including Nilsson’s expres-sion118 “Orphism and kindred religious movements”), is more logical than to maintain an excessively skeptical attitude and imagine that we may have to deal with yet “another religious movement” that we can neither qualify nor situate.Therefore, the idea seems gradually to be gaining ground that the tablets are Orphic, and it is once again becoming customary to call them so, without restrictions.119118 Nilsson (1935).119 For example, in the two recent editions of the texts, Tortorelli Ghidini (2006) and Graf-Johnston (2007).BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 20511/7/2007 5:53:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"BERNABE_f12_179-206.indd 20611/7/2007 5:53:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENPARALLELS TO THE TABLETS IN OTHER CULTURES11.1. IntroductionOutside Greece, we \u0002 nd documents with characteristics similar to those of the Orphic tablets. In some cases, they may be distant models; in others, in\u0003 uence may run in the opposite direction, or we may be dealing with parallel developments. The most ancient ones stem from Egypt, India, and Iran, while the most recent are found in Gallic area and, much later, in Western Europe.11.2. The Egyptian “Book of the Dead”Various scholars have pointed out similarities between the gold tablets and the Book of the Dead,1 the fundamental repository of Egyptian beliefs about the Beyond. In both works, the soul travels to the Beyond, there are paths to the right and the left,2 and the dead man is thirsty. In some chapters of the Book of the Dead, the dead man asks to be refreshed at a fountain close to a tree, and we \u0002 nd such phrases as “To drink water in the divine region below”, “O sycamore of Nut, give me your water”, or “Let me reach your water”. In addition, many Egyptian images offer the representation of a goddess in the form of a tree, suckling a dead man or allowing him to eat and drink at a rest stop on the road to the afterlife.3In the Book of the Dead, as in the tablets, we \u0002 nd a guardian who interrogates the dead man. The latter must reply with some speci\u0002 c passwords. For example, we read the following dialogue (ch. 122):1 Cf. Foucart (1895) 71, Diels (1907) 43 n. 4, Dieterich (19132) 95 f., Guthrie (1935) 177 f., Zuntz (1971) 370 ff., 389 ff., West (1971) 64 f., (1975), 229 f.

Thus, as pointed out by Zuntz,6 the tree in the Egyptian texts is almost always a sycamore, situated in a place which one reaches after passing through many others, whereas the cypress we \u0002 nd in the gold tablets is found right at the entrance to the other world. In addition, the dead Egyptian draws water from among the trees, and it is offered to him by an arm that sprouts from the tree or a goddess inside it, so that he does not have to choose between two springs, as in the Orphic tablets. Zuntz concludes that the motif of thirst is universal, and that it is not therefore necessary to suppose the existence of an Egyptian model for the texts of the tablets.7The Book of the Dead also includes a formula enabling the dead man to remember his name. This is alien to the conceptual world of the tablets. On the other hand, the idea of guardians who guard the entrance to an exclusive place, to which only certain souls may gain access, is a motif that is repeated in Antiquity and extends as far as Christianity,8 so that it is not certain that there were direct in\u0003 uences.4 Hornung (1989) 14, Betz (1998) 401.5 86, 23 (p. 176 Hornung), cf.

A Hittite parallel: the “Great voyage of the soul”We know of a Hittite text on the voyage of the soul through the other world,9 whose considerable thematic similarities with the Orphic tablets were noted right from the start, despite their highly fragmentary state. All of nature is described as in a dreaming state,10 apparently because “growth” has left its place. There follows a reference to the human soul, which is conceived as something that survives the body,11 and we then encounter imperatives, which indicate that someone is trying to change the situation:[ Wher]e did it come for it? If it is in the mountain, let the bee bring it and put it in its place. If, however, it is in the plain, let the bee bring it and put it in its place. That which is towards the plowed \u0002 eld, let the bees bring and put it in its place. Let the bees go a journey of three days, of four days and bring my Growth. If it is towards the sea, let the lahanza-duck (loon?) bring it and put it in its place. But if it is towards the river, let the huwalas-bird (owl?) bring it and put it in its place.But whatever is towards the sky, let the tapakaliya-eagle bring it in his talons.The “growth” belongs to the speaker, who seems to be a divinity, who tries to have it brought to his place, and into his control. Since the human soul appears in this context, and since this soul’s path towards the Beyond is then described, it is tempting to think that the restitution of order has something to do with guiding the soul under discussion to its correct location in the underworld. The text then continues:Let the Desired One be struck with their talons. Let the goat strike him with its horns. Let the ram strike him with his horns. Let the mother sheep strike him with her nose. The Mother Goddess is tearful. She is struck with tears. What things are dear to her are “opened” upon the nine body parts. They must be struck. But the soul is thriving with (all) its parts (?). Let there be no oracle for it. 9 KBo 22. 178 + KUB 43.109, cf. Hoffner (1988), Watkins (1995), Bernabé (2005b), and (forthcoming 2).10 Both the description of the sleeping lethargy of nature (which also has parallels in Alcm. fr. 89 Page = 159 Calame), and the sending of the bee and the eagle are found in the Hittite myths of the disappearing god, such as that of Telipinu, cf. Bernabé (19872) 39 ff. and 47 ff.11 Watkins (1995) 284.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 20911/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"210 chapter elevenThe af\u0003 iction of the mother goddess indicates that she has an emotional relation with the Desired One, who is “what things are dear to her”, and very probably her son.In the face of the destruction of the Desired One, the soul appears to be in full possession of its faculties. It is not necessary to consult any oracle on it, because in its optimal situation it does not need it. The soul thus bene\u0002 ts from the destruction of the Desired One, which seems to be the precondition of its safety and the guarantee that it can undertake its great voyage. There follows a dialogue in direct style, which has even been said to have the structure of a catechism,12 between the soul and another character, who may be the of\u0002 ciant of a rite “of the dead” at the moment when the soul is about to undertake its journey, or the divinity who has been speaking previously.13“The soul is great. The soul is great.”“Whose soul is great?”“The mortal(’s) soul is great.”“And what road does it travel?”“It travels the Great Road. It travels the Invisible (?) road.”“The Guide(-deity) has himself/herself prepared it for the road.”“A holy thing is the soul of the Sun Goddess (of the Earth?). To the gods belongs the soul. Why must I, a mortal, go into the sea? (Why must) I go into the place of punishment? I will fall into the river. I will fall into the pool. Let me not go to the tenawas, I go [ ] The tenawas is evil [ ] . . . the meadow no . . . to a god . . .”The path is the one that the soul must traverse at the death of its host body, towards the Beyond; this is why it is “great” and “Invisible”.14 The phrase “The Guide(-deity) has himself/herself prepared it for the road” indicates that there is a divinity who acts as the soul’s guide in the underworld, so that it may reach the right place.With the declaration “Something sacred of the Solar Goddess of the Earth is the soul”, the soul proclaims its own divine origin. This may 12 Cf. Watkins (1995) 288. The direct style is revealed by the presence of the particle -wa- (which indicates precisely this circumstance in Hittite) at the beginning of the phrases of lines 26–27 and the questions and answers, as well as the repeated verbs in the \u0002 rst person.13 The two interpretations are not mutually exclusive. The of\u0002 ciant may be repre-senting the divinity in the ritual. And if the text were a ritual of the dead, the dead man’s answers would also be given by someone playing his part.14 “Invisible” strongly evokes Greek Hades and its etymology as \u0002\u0003 \u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b (Plat. Gorg. 493b).BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21011/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" parallels to the tablets in other cultures 211explain the relation of the Desired One with the human soul. The text has a remarkable coherence if the Desired One is interpreted as the \u0002 rst-born man and son of the Sun Goddess of the Earth. Such a myth would be very appropriate for recitation in a ritual of the dead, provid-ing a paradigm in illo tempore for explaining both man’s position in the cosmos, with a mortal body but a divine soul, and the conditions that propitiated his journey to the Beyond in mythical time. According to this interpretation, the mortal body of the \u0002 rst-born man, the Desired One, had to be destroyed in order for his soul, now liberated, to go to its place in the other world. The cosmic con\u0003 ict bought about by his death may arise from the fact that the Desired One has a divine part (his soul) and a mortal part. The solution of the con\u0003 ict is to take the divine part to the Divine, and destroy the mortal part. The order of the world thus requires that man die and like the \u0002 rst man, every man, after death, must reach a happy place in the Beyond.15 In addition, the theme of the Desired One has parallels in the human son whom Demeter tries to divinize in the Hymn to Demeter (164 f.):A very dear son, in the well-built dwellingis raised, late, highly desired and received with affection.The boy is not Demeter’s son, but the goddess, who has lost her daugh-ter Persephone, tries to make the child immortal as if he were hers, giving him ambrosia as food and placing him in the \u0002 re to eliminate the mortal part from him. She fails, however, since she is caught in the act by the child’s mother. In the Homeric version, the child survives, but in the Orphic version16 he is burned alive. Both in the Greek and in the Hittite myth, then, we \u0002 nd the related, but distinct themes of the termination of life on earth and the existence of the semi-divine child (in the Greek myth, only an attempt at existence).17In what follows in the Hittite text, the soul expresses its desire not to fall into the tenawas, and perhaps not to undergo physical harm: it 15 Watkins (1995) 288 rightly points out the relations of this terminology with that which appears in the road to the divine land of the tomb of Suppiluliuma II.16 Transmitted by the P. Berol. 44, 100 f. (OF 396).17 The plot of the Hymn to Demeter is complicated by the rape of Persephone, but it is revealing that it is not the loss of her daughter that provokes the anger of the goddess and the stoppage of life, but her failure to convert the child into a divinity. In the Hittite myth, the stoppage of life seems to be a consequence of the birth of the semi-divine child, not of his death. The same elements are combined in a different way and with a different meaning.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21111/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212 chapter eleventhus refers to a vision of the Beyond in which there are two alterna-tives. There is a good path (into which one “falls”), which leads to a meadow, a river and a pool, and a bad path (to which one “goes”),18 de\u0002 ned as a tenawas, and conceived as a sea and as a place of punish-ment, where the soul may be attacked by a god. In a later fragment we see the effects of the tenawas:The evil tenawas [holds (?) him (?), so that] he does not recognize [them]. One doesn’t recognize the other. Sisters having the same mother do [not] recognize (each other). Brothers having the same father do [not] recognize (each other). A mother does [not] recognize [her] own child. [A child] does [not] recognize [its own] mother. [. . .] does [not] recognize [. . .] does [not] recognize [. . .]The tenawas produces forgetfulness in souls, like the river Lethe or the fountain of Forgetfulness in Orphic literature.19 Yet it seems that in the Hittite version, the tenawas is a sea of the Beyond, and its effect (causing forgetfulness) is not produced by drinking its waters; instead, it seems that the soul is “devoured” by a sea of forgetfulness. Let us continue, however:From a \u0002 ne table they do not eat. From a \u0002 ne stool they do not eat. From a \u0002 ne cup they do not drink. They do not eat [good] food. They do not drink my good drink. They eat bits of mud. They drink waste waters (?) (a few lines below one may read drink! and the prohibitory negation do not . . .).It is most probable that this is the destiny of those who are in the tenawas.20 The use of the possessive in the expression “my good drink” indicates that the speaker is the divinity who administers it, and decides which souls must end up in the tenawas, drink swampy water and eat clay, and which souls can enjoy good food and good drink, invited by 18 This phraseology recalls the use of “to fall” (\t\t\u0002\u000b) in the Orphic tablets, cf. Watkins (1995) 289. The fact that one “falls” into the good path and one “goes” to the bad one may be due to the fact that in the \u0002 rst case the divinity intervenes in order to “place him there”, whereas if it does not intervene, the traveler will be lost and will “go” to the bad path. 19 Hoffner (1988).20 Hoffner (1988) 193 and n. 9 points out that the situation once again reminds us of what occurs when a god disappears but even more so of the Mesopotamian texts that refer to the situation of the dead. Likewise, others point out the parallels with the Hittite texts that re\u0003 ect the funerary rites of kings.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21211/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" parallels to the tablets in other cultures 213him to his table, and one supposes they are ones who have followed the “good path” to the underworld.21In short, there are two possibilities in the other world: good or bad food and drink, controlled by the divinity who recites the text. Some souls may enjoy the hospitality of the netherworld divinity, whereas others, through ignorance or through inadequate (ritual?) behavior, are brought face to face with muddy water. The function of the ritual would be to bring it about that the soul enjoys the divine banquet in the Beyond.We \u0002 nd surprising analogies between the Voyage of the Soul and the Hittite text, but there are also notable differences. Both texts conceive the soul’s passage to the underworld as a journey,22 which can have two destinies, in two different locations, one good and the other bad.23 The good place is a moist meadow, a desirable place in all Indo-European literature,24 and banquets are celebrated in it.25 The bad place is associ-ated in the Voyage of the Soul with forgetfulness, punishment and the presence of mud. In the tablets there is a reference to a fountain from which the initiates must not drink, no doubt because it is the water of forgetfulness.26 In the Hittite myth, the tenawas consists in a kind of sea of forgetfulness. Mud is not mentioned in the tablets, but it is in the Orphic texts we have just cited,27 which refer to punishments. And it is not certain that the Voyage of the Soul mentions punishments; at any rate, it does not specify them.In the Hittite text the privileged enjoy good food and good drink, contrary to the other people, who eat mud and drink swampy water, whereas the tenawas is described as a place. In the Orphic texts, there is mud in the place of condemned, but it is not eaten, whereas good 21 Watkins (1995) 289 considers that good food is proper to the fortunate soul, which may have been instructed or “initiated”.22 In the tablets, it is speci\u0002 ed that it is a journey to the subterranean world, a detail that does not appear in the Hittite text. However, the mention of the “Sun Goddess of the Earth” seems to indicate that here, too, the voyage is towards the lower world.23 In the tablets, the bad space is only suggested, but we know something more of it from other texts, for instance, Plat. Resp. 330d, Phd. 69c, Gorg. 493a–c. See Bernabé (2002d) and § 12.3.24 Cf. Puhvel (1969), Velasco López (2001).25 In the tablets, we only encounter one reference to wine, in L 7, but other texts indicate that the Orphics believed the blessed enjoyed an eternal banquet in the Beyond, cf. § 2.5.26 Cf. § 1.5.27 Cf. n. 23.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21311/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"214 chapter elevenfood for privileged people appears in association with wine. On the other hand, an opposition, absent from the Hittite text, is established between water of Forgetfulness and water of Memory.In addition, in the imagery of the tablets some guardians ask the initiate for a password which will enable him to enter into the good place. To achieve or not to achieve the right path depends on the initi-ate, on his knowing what he must say and where he must go. In the Hittite tale, the fate of the soul depends on whether or not the divinity guides it (it “falls” into the good place, but “goes”, if left on its own, to the bad one). One has the impression that the soul depends on the decision of the divinity, rather than on any process of initiation. Nor is it stated that the water of forgetfulness has a relation to reincarna-tion, as it does in the Orphic world. Again there is no \u0002 gure similar to Mnemosyne. And whereas in the tablets it is the guardians that allow the soul to drink from the good fountain, in the Voyage of the Soul it is the divinity, narrator of the entire passage, who instructs or authorizes the soul to drink.As far as the myths alluded to are concerned, in both texts the human soul stems from the destruction of a god, but in the Voyage of the Soul it is the destruction of the Desired One, who seems to be the \u0002 rst man, son of the Sun Goddess of the Earth, that makes possible the life of the soul, despite the pain it causes the mother goddess. In the Greek myth, the Titans’ dismembering and consumption of Dionysus also causes pain for his mother, Persephone. Zeus strikes the Titans down with lightning, and men are born from their remains. The pain experienced by the Sun Goddess of the Earth at the laceration of the Desired One by a thousand wounds evokes that of Persephone, caused by the dismemberment of her son. It also evokes that of Demeter for the child she was unable to convert into a divinity.Nevertheless, the differences are highly signi\u0002 cant: in the Voyage of the Soul, the Desired One is dismembered by animals, his dismem-berment is necessary for the reestablishment of order, and the soul even bene\u0002 ts from his destruction. In contrast, the Titans’ crime of dismembering and consuming Dionysus leads to disorder. Men come from the destruction of the Titans, and must purge their prior guilt through puri\u0002 cations and reincarnations. Man’s soul is harmed, rather than bene\u0002 ted, by the dismemberment of the primeval being.It is clear that the Hittite Sun Goddess of the Earth has points of contact with the duo of Demeter and Persephone. She is a Sun God-dess from above who is found in the underworld, and therefore the guarantor of the souls’ passage from this world to the Beyond. We can BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21411/7/2007 5:54:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" parallels to the tablets in other cultures 215also \u0002 nd a distant echo of the theme of the Voyage of the Soul in another detail from the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. When Demeter fails in her attempt to create a divine son, she makes vegetation disappear. It is possible that in the Voyage of the Soul the responsibility for the disappearance of growth lies not with the Desired One, but with the operations of the Sun Goddess of the Earth to make her son immortal. There is, however, nothing in the text to indicate this.As far as the soul is concerned, in both texts it manifests its divine origin as something separate from the mortal body, and in both texts mention is made of its purity (ritual, it must be understood), which seems to be a necessary prerequisite for a satisfactory destiny in the Beyond. On the one hand there are two themes in Orphic ideology, associated with each other, which are not to be found in the Hittite myth: the idea of a prior guilt, a reason why the human soul pays the penalty, and the necessity of being reincarnated until liberation is achieved. In addition, the foundational myth in the Hittite text seems to explain the relation between death and the cessation of growth. According to this myth the \u0002 rst man, the Desired One, son of a god-dess, stops growth when his mother tries to turn him into an immortal; the myth offers the ritual solution for leading his soul to the Beyond and returning growth to its place. The same ritual procedure must be followed by any dead person, and there is a close relation between the soul’s destiny and fertility. On the other hand, as we said, there is no connection with initiation. In the Orphic texts, the alteration produced in illo tempore is the death of a god, from whom men are born. The purpose of the ritual is to give instruction on the reasons for man’s position in the world, and to accelerate the process of reintegration of his soul to its divine state.Finally, there is a series of similar literary and discursive elements in both texts: in the \u0002 rst place, the reference to the path of the Voyage of the Soul recalls, as Watkins points out,28 the sacred way from the tablet of Hipponion,29 and the path of Zeus in Pindar.30 Secondly, an allu-sion is made in both texts to swiftness,31 as if the rite had to be carried 28 Watkins (1995) 288.29 L 1, 15 f.: “So that, once you have drunk, you too will go along the sacred way /by which the other mystai and bacchoi advance, glorious”.30 Pind. Ol. 2, 70. Cf. the \f\r\u000e\u0002\u0005\u000f\u0003\u0010 \u0011\u0012\f\u0011\u0010 of Posidipp. fr. 118, 24–25 Austin-Bastianini (= fr. 37, 21–22 Fernández Galiano).31 Twice in the Voyage of the Soul, and passim in the tablets; cf. for instance L 7: “on this day”, and “swift”, L 1, 11; L 3, 8, in which the soul asks that it be given to drink “in a hurry”; cf. Ricciardelli (1992) 28.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21511/7/2007 5:54:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"216 chapter elevenout urgently, which is consistent with a ritual for the dead. Third, the ritual schema of questions and answers to the soul in the Hittite myth is similar to that found in the Orphic tablets, where the soul declares its divine origin and does not refer to its “terrestrial” identity.Nevertheless, the nature and function of the questions are not the same. In the Orphic tablets, the soul plays a more obviously leading role: it must utter a password to demonstrate that it has been initiated, and only thus can it continue its way towards the meadow, whereas in the Voyage of the Soul it is not subject to any examination. Neither are there any indications in the tablets that the soul fears for its des-tiny. The dead man is certain that since he knows the answers, he will achieve a happy outcome. In the Voyage of the Soul, by contrast, the soul expresses its fear of falling into the tenawas.In addition, the text in the Voyage of the Soul always seems to be spo-ken by the god who hosts the underworld banquet, and no instructions are given to the deceased, whereas in the Orphic tablets the hosts would be Persephone and Hades, but the person who instructs the initiate’s soul is not them, but a narrator who appears to be Orpheus. The latter knows what happens in the Beyond, but has no control over it.Other points of similarity include verbal reiteration (although this is a generic ritualistic feature), and the use of the verb “to fall” to refer to the soul’s arrival in its new state of blessedness.32 Finally, there is yet another interesting connection, not with the tablets, but with other Orphic texts: the reference to mud by means of an onomatopoeic term, which in the Hittite text is mirmirrus and in the Greek ones,33 \u0013\u0014\u0015\u0013\u0011\u0015\u0011\b.In sum the Hittite text of the Voyage of the Soul shows noteworthy af\u0002 nities with the Orphic tablets and other documents of the religious circle that took Orpheus as its guide. There are also signi\u0002 cant differ-ences between the two, especially with regard to the ritual context. The reason for the similarities could be that Orphism recuperates features of very ancient Mediterranean religion, which had remained somewhat hidden in Greek literature by the imposition of Olympian religion. The differences must re\u0003 ect the cultural and ideological differences between Hittites and Greeks, and, above all, the fact that Orphic texts derive 32 Watkins (1995) 289.33 For instance, in Plat. Phd. 69c, Plot. 1, 6, 6 and Aristoph. Ran. 145. Other pas-sages are given in Watkins (1995) 289 f.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21611/7/2007 5:54:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" parallels to the tablets in other cultures 217from a mystery religion, for initiates, unrelated to of\u0002 cial religion (but not contrary to it), whereas the Voyage of the Soul, a text that was preserved in palace archives, was probably better integrated within the of\u0002 cial religion.11.4. Indian ParallelsWe \u0002 nd some parallels between the tablets and religious texts from India.34 The theme of the Path to the heavens is already central to Vedic eschatology, and the funerary ritual is intended to set the soul in the right direction by helping it to get by the Path guardians: the two dogs of Yama, who accept whoever deserves a blessed destiny, rejecting anyone else.35 However, it is in later Vedic speculation that the problem of the destiny of the souls acquires fundamental importance. The criterion for the selection of souls changes then, since knowledge of the Vedic texts is an exclusive prerogative of the priestly class. The \u0002 nal development of this doctrine is to be found in the versions of the Upanishads, where the theory of reincarnation is formulated, and two paths are mentioned:36 the Gods’, the devay\u0002na or ascending path, which traverses the luminous halves of the solar, lunar, and daily cycles, lead-ing to liberation; and the Fathers’, pit‰y\u0002na, the descending path, which traverses the opposite halves of the aforementioned cycles, in which the light diminishes until it disappears, and leading back to a new birth.The text in which we \u0002 nd most similarities with our tablets is the Jaimin\u0003ya Br\u0002hma\u0004a ( JB),37 the most extensive of the Br\u0002hma\u0004as, ascribed to the S\u0002maVeda, which we still have. We can \u0002 nd in it a description of the soul’s path to the Beyond,38 from which we offer a few passages:34 Studied by Mendoza (forthcoming), where many more details of the highest importance may be found. The present section is a summary of this study.35 On the exhortation to walk the right path, cf. RV X 15, 7 (1); on the two dogs of Yama, RV X 14, 11.36 Cf.

The world that is won by him due to his offerings is where he stops. Eventually, Death gets holds of him as well.

One of the °tus, holding a hammer in his hand, comes down towards him on a ray of light, and asks him “Who are you, man?”(50) To him he must answer“Oh °tus, from the Shining one, wrung out every fortnight, he who is intimately related to the Fathers, semen is born”.(For there43 . . . they make an offering to the shining king Soma)44“Thus, you hurl me as a man, your agent”(For they send it here45 as an agent)“from this man, your agent, your spill me onto a mother”(Since he (the father) introduces it into a mother)“Consequently, I am produced, being added by the thirteenth as the additional month to the twelve”.(It is the thirteenth one that burns here)“Thus I know this, I am sure of it.

I am the truth. Lead me, °tus, to immortality”.The °tus take it with them. . . . They welcome him. It is not a human being who knows thus, it is one of the gods he who knows to that extent.We \u0002 nd analogies and differences between this text and the tablets. In the JB, the spirit with the smoke takes an ascending path, climbing the units of temporal succession. It is, thus, a heavenly eschatology. In the Orphic eschatology, the soul’s path towards the privileged seat is directed downward, towards Hades. In the \u0002 rst section of the path, we \u0002 nd a difference: in the Indian tradition, not all souls are capable of following the ascending path, only those of certain deceased, who have been granted a correct ritual of incineration. In the tablets, the path is common in the \u0002 rst section for all the souls, without previous conditions. In contrast, the Orphic itinerary has an initial bifurcation (the \u0002 rst spring), which the Brahmanic itinerary does not have.In the JB, when the soul reaches the month, governed by the moon, it meets the body once again and restructures its personal identity, an encounter that is neither possible nor necessary in Orphism, where the principle of identity resides in the spirit (\u0016\r\u0017\u0018) and the body lacks any value.The closest coincidences occur in the process of selection of the fortunate souls. In both cases, the soul in its advance encounters a point at which it must stop, since it is halted by entities that play the role of guardians of the path and of “judges”, who admit or reject those who reach them. In the JB, towards the month, and along a ray of light, a character belonging to the world of the gods, but not a god himself (a °tus) descends, ful\u0002 lling the function of guardian of the entrance to the world of the gods. In both cases, the soul is asked a question (in the Indian text, “who are you, man?”, in the tablets: “who are you and where do you come from?”), upon whose answer depends its acceptance or rejection. In both texts, we \u0002 nds descriptions only of the sole further path of the chosen souls, but in the JB the same section must have been common for the rejected ones as well. The destiny of these souls is a return, in the descending direction, and, \u0002 nally “dying again”. The Orphic tablets are not concerned with the fate of the rejected ones, probably because of the very nature and purpose of the text, instructions given to the soul for achieving access.The correct answer to the question in both texts requires a self-de\u0002 nition on the part of the deceased which has nothing to do with his BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 21911/7/2007 5:54:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"220 chapter elevenpersonal identity, but rather with the possession of speci\u0002 c knowledge that “transforms him into a god”. The answer, which in both cases is formulaic, reveals that the deceased has acquired knowledge of the origin of human life on earth, derived from a metaphysical and mystical vision of life in the Cosmos. In the JB, it explains the human condition in its origins, according to the doctrine of the \u0002 ve \u0002 res; in the Orphic text, allusion is made to the Titanic origin of the human being. The theme is the same, but the religious environment is different.The path for those who are accepted does not end at the point of selection. Accepted by the guardians, the Greek mystes and the Indian sage continue along a new section of the path which takes them to their de\u0002 nitive destiny. In the Indian text, the soul no longer walks in solitude, but takes along a guide, who accompanies it as a friend and an equal in the right direction. Finally, the soul is accepted by the gods and acquires a new nature: it is no longer a man, but becomes similar to the gods,46 which enables him to live among them. Except for the enormous differences of various kinds, there is in both texts an atmosphere of connection and brotherhood, deriving from the feeling of belonging to a cast of chosen ones.Many of the elements present in both stories belong to the inherited tradition, or appear in other eschatologies of Indo-European or Meso-potamian cultures: the idea of a Beyond with a guarded region reserved for a few privileged deceased, the \u0002 gure of a “guide of the souls” who sets them on the right path towards their \u0002 nal destiny, the selection of the souls at an intermediary stage, and even the questioning of identity as a means for selection, are found in the two stories we have studied and in Iranian eschatological conceptions,47 but in this case there is a coincidence of motifs rather than a parallelism in the narratives.On the other hand, the idea that the \u0002 nal destiny of souls leads to a region of peace, in the company of a few gods and with those who deserve it likewise, does not have the same antiquity in the Greek world as it does in Indian thought. This idea is relatively recent in Greece, and it does not belong to the most ancient conception of the Greek 46 “You have been born a god, from the mortal you were”, L 8, 4; “happy and fortunate, you will be a god from the mortal you were” L 9, 8; “it is not a human being that knows in this way, it is one of the gods who knows as far as this point”, at the end of the text from the JB.47 Cf. infra. § 11.5.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 22011/7/2007 5:54:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" parallels to the tablets in other cultures 221Hades, but it is found in the most ancient Vedic tradition of the reign of Yama.The similarities that become apparent after the comparison of the two itineraries cannot be explained by a mere coincidence of motifs, but are assembled into a common story line, with such a parallel structure, whose similarities are so close in the process of the selection of souls, that it exceeds what could be ascribed to casual coincidences, and allow us to think about the possibility of an in\u0003 uence of one tradition over the other.11.5. Parallels in the Iranian worldSimilarly, interesting parallels to the tablets have been found in Iranian texts.48 Despite the absence of any narrative of the fate of the souls after death in the G\u0002th\u0002s, some elements, which were to be developed in later literature, are already present, such as the place of the souls’ passage, the Cinvat Bridge, along which only the initiates will pass, whereas the evil will be confronted by the da\bn\u0002, who will not let them pass. In later texts, the details of the souls’ path to Paradise or to Hell and the geography of the Beyond are ampli\u0002 ed. Thus, in Had\txt Nask 2, 7–8, aspects of the passage of the just man’s soul are collected.When the sun comes up after the third night, the just man’s soul has the impression of sticking up its head and traveling through perfumed vegetation; it seems to feel a wind blowing towards it from the regions of the south, laden with perfumes, more perfumed than other winds.The fragrance allows us to suppose that the just man’s soul walks through a garden, although it is only perceived by the sense of smell. Then in 2.9–14, we encounter the question “who are you?”, but this time it is formulated by the soul.His own da\bn\u0002 appears to him in the form of a beautiful damsel, radiant, white-armed, robust, attractive, upright, with \u0002 rm breasts and well-pro-portioned body, of noble birth and glorious lineage, seeming to be \u0002 fteen years old, more beautiful than the most beautiful of creatures. The soul of the just man then says to her: “Young woman, the most beautiful I have ever seen, who are you?”. The da\bn\u0002 answers him: “Young man of good 48 Cf. Álvarez Pedrosa (forthcoming).BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 22111/7/2007 5:54:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"222 chapter eleventhought, good word, good deed, and good da\bn\u0002, I am your own da\bn\u0002”. “And who has loved you for the grandeur, the goodness, the beauty, the perfume, the strength of victory and the defeat of hate with which you appear before me?” “Young man of good thought, good word, good deed, and good da\bn\u0002, it is you who love me for the grandeur, the goodness, the beauty, the perfume, the strength of victory and the defeat of hate with which I appear before you. Every time you saw someone burning (a cadaver?),49 practicing idolatry, causing oppression, or cutting down trees, then you sat down reciting the G\u0002th\u0002s and sacri\u0002 cing to the good waters and the \u0002 re of Ahura Mazd\u0003 and taking in the pious man who comes from near or from far. In this way, I who am pleasant, you have made me more pleasant; I, who am lovely, you have made me more lovely; I, who sit at the front, you have placed me still closer to the front”.The explanation of the reason why the soul has been chosen from among the blessed, which refers to the adequate ritual accomplish-ment it has followed during life, evokes such phrases from the tablets as “I come from among the pure, pure” (L 9–10), or “once you have accomplished the same rites as the other happy ones” (L 7a).In other texts, the da\bn\u0002 appears in successive personi\u0002 cations, as a cow, a maiden, or a garden, which differ according to whether the person contemplating them is a just man or a reprobate. A couple of very interesting parallels with the Iranian da\bn\u0002 are found in the Orphic environment, aside from the tablets: one in the Derveni Papyrus, where mention is made of guardian demons and demons who impede the soul’s passage (\u0019\f\t\u0011\u0006\u001a\u0010);50 both would be the Orphic parallels to the Iranian da\bn\u0002 in its double manifestation as a beautiful damsel or a hideous witch, according to the condition of the dead man’s soul. Another is the \u001b\f\t\u0011\r\u000e\u001c who appears in Aristophanes (Ran. 293), and who transforms herself into a cow, a mule and a beautiful woman, similarly to the Zoroastrian da\bn\u0002, who transforms herself into a cow, a woman or a garden, which are beautiful or horrid according to the condition of the dead man’s soul.51 A fourth transformation, into a dog, relates the dogs that accompany the da\bn\u0002 in the Vid\bvd\u0002t 19, 30.49 On Zoroastrianism, the cremation of bodies is a contamination of \u0002 re, one of the sacred natural elements.50 P.

This is powerfully reminiscent of the af\u0002 rmation made by the soul in L 10a–b: “I have paid the punishment that corresponds to impious actions”, as well as the repeated allusions to the “terrors of Hades” in Orphic literature aside from the tablets.52Yet there are also noteworthy differences between the religious conceptions of both texts. The major one is the complete absence of references to reincarnation in the Iranian tradition. Nor is the geog-raphy of the Beyond comparable in all its details. The Zoroastrianism of the Sassanid period af\u0002 rms the existence of three places: a paradise, a hell and an intermediary place (Hamistak\u0002n), where those who have accumulated merits and sins in equal measure will end up. In addition, the soul’s path towards its interrogation is described in the tablets as a descent, whereas in the Iranian texts it is an ascent to a heavenly eschatology. Furthermore, the formulaic question “Who are you?”, asked by the guardians in the Greek tradition, is reversed, and in the Avestan tradition it is formulated by the soul of the deceased.Among the parallels cited, some may go back to a common origin, as may be the case of the motif of the garden with trees and water, or the question “who are you?” (although it has undergone a reversal of actors in the Iranian texts), as well as, perhaps, the post-mortem maiden and the special food reserved for the blessed, which are also present in other Indo-European traditions. Others may have passed from a peripheral Western Iranian tradition to the Greek world, like the idea that the blessed experience rewards of a sensual nature in the Beyond, such as wonderful music or fragrant odors, the terrors experi-enced by the soul after its death, understood as a partial expiation, the two paths that bifurcate according to whether the souls are those of the condemned or the blessed. Above all, the double existence in the Beyond of demons and Eumenides, as described in the Derveni Papyrus, or alluded to by the Aristophanic \u001b\f\t\u0011\r\u000e\u001c,53 are very obvious proofs of an Iranian in\u0003 uence on the Orphic texts.52 Cf. Bernabé (2002d).53 With transformations adjusted to the Avestic literary model, preserved in such texts as the Titrya Yat.BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 22311/7/2007 5:54:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"224 chapter elevenThe importance of ritual ful\u0002 llment in giving the correct answer that enables the separation of the just man from the condemned, may perhaps be of Iranian origin, since it is already in the spirit of the G\u0002th\u0002s, but they may also have a common origin, given the ritualistic character of the Indo-Iranian religion. Nevertheless, ritual purity in the Orphic texts has a speci\u0002 c eschatological meaning.5411.6. “Tablets” in the Italian environmentWe \u0002 nd some documents in the Italian ambience whose characteris-tics are comparable to the Orphic gold tablets. This is the case of a Lucanian inscription of the 3rd–2nd cent. B.C. (Ve 185),55 which can be translated into Latin as follows:(Proper name) \u0002 o deus hic, salvus (sis) vale,I, X, am here converted into a god. May you be safe: farewell.We also preserve an inscription from Saepinum, of an uncertain date between the 3rd and the 1st cent. B.C., which may be translated into Latin as:quis tu? ego X. cuia? Baeti Adii Ae\u0002 niWho are you? I am X. Of whom? Of X.Both can be compared in some aspects to the Orphic tablets: \u0002 rstly, the conversion of the mentioned individual into a god, as well as the salutation given to him by another character, equivalent to the Greek \u0017\u001c\u001d\u0015\u001e. Secondly, the dialogue in which the question of identity is raised. Documents such as these could reveal a certain penetration of the Greek religious world among South Italian peoples.56 One should also recall in this respect, the image represented on the Ripacandida jar,57 of North Lucanian culture, which seems to have been in\u0003 uenced by the Metapontine Orphico-Pythagorean world.54 See Parker (1983) 300.55 [\u001f?] \u001c\t\u0011\u0010\u0005\b !\u001c\u000f\"#\u0005\b $\t\u0005\u001e\b \t\u0005\u0011 \u001c\u0005\b \u001e\u000f\u0011 \u000e\u001c \u001c\"\b \"\u001c \u001e\u000256 Cf.

A tablet in GalliaIn Baudecet (Gembloux, Belgium) a gold tablet came to light, which was initially interpreted as Gallic, without great success, and which seems to contain various formulas.58 At line 3, one may perhaps read in Greek:a kid,59 I submerge myself in milk.At line 4, Lambert reads:pure (?) of the immortal,a reading we consider doubtful. In contrast, Jordan thinks he can read the word “bull” in the second word, left undeciphered by Lambert. Finally, at line 5, Lambert understands (in Latin)I will go to the fountain of Memorywhereas Jordan prefers to understand the \u0002 rst word as “sheep”.The readings are doubtful, and the environment of the tablet is not, in any case, Orphic, so it would be attractive to think that a kind of itinerant mage turned up in Belgium in the 2nd cent. A.D., bear-ing a gold tablet that imitated the old Orphic tablets, now used as an amulet—as we suppose it happened with the one from Rome, L 11, somewhat later than this one—in which echoes of old formulas were contained, some translated into Latin, among a jumble of abracadabras that were incomprehensible for its “customers”.11.8. The ‘Punic’ tabletsIn places of Phoenician in\u0003 uence such as Sardinia, Sicily, the North of Africa, the Balearics and the South of Spain, gold and silver tablets and papyri documents have been found, dated about 7th–5th B.C., that can be considered in some way parallel to Orphic gold tablets.60 Some of these documents contain inscriptions in the Phoenician alphabet 58 Cf.

Echoes in modern timesFinally, we shall limit ourselves to a mere allusion to parallels to the tablets, of very recent date, in which there is a voyage of the soul to a locus amoenus and questions and answers, but now in a Christian setting. There are examples from Mordovia,61 at the con\u0003 uence of the Volga and Kama rivers, and Romania.62 It seems that the ancient model refuses to disappear, and transforms itself by adopting new forms to respond to a different religion.61 Jordan (2001).62 Marian (2000) 79 and 304 ff., Poruciuc (2002).BERNABE_F13_207-226.indd 22611/7/2007 5:54:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVELITERARY QUESTIONS: CHARACTERISTICS, MODELS AND ARCHETYPES12.1. Problems of a literary natureAnother important series of questions is raised by the Orphic tablets, which do not concern as much their contents as issues of a philological and literary nature. The term “Orphic” is not only applied to a type of religion, but also to a concrete form of literature: an ample quantity of pseudo-epigraphic poetry attributed to Orpheus. If the tablets are representative of forms of Orphic literature, the basic questions are: What are they, from a literary viewpoint, and whence do these texts derive? Regarding these last questions, we might also ask ourselves whether the coincidences between certain tablets (as is primarily the case for those from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia and Pharsalus) are to be attributed to the fact that they derive from a common archetype, and if so, what kind of archetype was it, and what kind of transmis-sion do they conceal.Regarding the \u0002 rst question, as long as only a few tablets had ap-peared, the \u0002 rst interpretation provided was that they were extracts from an Orphic book of poems, either verses from a Descent to Hades (\u0002\u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t \u000b\f\r\u000e\u000b\u000f\u0006\u0004) attributed to Orpheus,1 or else passages from various works from the Orphic canon, “taken from here and there, without any other intention than to choose verses that refer speci\u0002 cally to future life”.2Clearly, there are pieces of information to support this interpreta-tion. To cite just a few, L 8 begins with the adversative \u0010\u0011\u0011\u0012, the \u0002 rst verse of L 3 includes an adversative \u0007\u0013, as does L 5d. In L 9, 2 \u0014\u0015\u0011\u0016\u0004 \u0014\u0015\u000e\b\t\u0011\u0002\u0017\u0004 \f\u0002 appear, invoked by means of the nominativus pro vocativo. If the contention is that these texts derive from another longer one, both the coordinating particles (which would link the phrase to 1 Dieterich (19132) 128, cf. Guthrie (1935) 172 f., who thinks they are extracts from a poem or book of poems, datable at least to the 5th cent. B.C.2 Comparetti (1882) 117.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 22711/7/2007 5:55:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"228 chapter twelvethe preceding one in the original work) and the nominativus pro vocativo, resulting from a poor adaptation of a context in which this sequence of gods was stated in the nominative, could be explained.This explanation, however, was criticized from an early stage. Many oracles begin with \u0010\u0011\u0011\r and are complete,3 while the nominativus pro voca-tivo is a habitual phenomenon. The weakest point of this interpretation is that if they were “a series of extracts”, they would be unrelated texts, and this is not the case. In essence, this is not the correct hypothesis.Edmonds has argued that a comparison of the gold tablets with other traditional verse oracles quoted in sources such as Herodotus and Pausanias reveals that all the features of the tablets that might make the tablet texts resemble a didactic poem are also features of traditional verse oracles.4 According this scholar, the tablets could well be from a famous oracle response in answer to a question about the nature of the afterlife.By contrast, others think that the tablets collect brief, complete poems. In the case of similar ones, like those of the \u0002 rst group we have studied, explanations provided concerning the kind of relation between them are either vague,5 or else speci\u0002 cally considering it as a normal case of transmission from an archetype to its copies, an archetype that has even been the subject of attempted reconstructions, in whole or in part.6 Thus, West sets off from the idea that the archetype is a brief Ionic poem, datable to the 5th cent. B.C.,7 which has undergone changes and additions to its content, including the intrusion of Doric or semi-Doric forms. For his part, Janko8 starts out on the basis that we are dealing with memorized and oral, not written texts. The author, who has broad experience in sub-epic stages and in formulaic adaptation, 3 As was pointed out by Zuntz (1971) 330.4 Edmonds (forthcoming).5 Lloyd-Jones (1975) limits himself to observing that they “appear in various forms and with various errors”. Gallavotti (1978–1979) 337 thinks that they are the \u0011\u0018\u0019\u0006\b\u001a of a sect, a popular text, transmitted in various redactions contaminated by each other, specifying that each one must be understood within itself, although related ones help to explain each other. Marcovich (1976) seems to be satis\u0002 ed with stating that he does not think it possible to reconstruct an archetype of the versions. 6 Merkelbach (1975) speaks of an eigentlicher Text of which he reconstructs a few verses. West (1975) and Janko (1984) attempt a reconstruction of the entire archetype.7 West (1975).8 Janko (1984).BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 22811/7/2007 5:55:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" literary questions 229tries to apply such methodology to the reconstruction of an archetype of the tablets.9However, regardless of method employed, there is, nevertheless, an ample degree of arbitrariness,10 which ends up giving the impression that an archetype is being reconstructed, once the kind of archetype one wishes to reconstruct has already been decided, thus making cuts, additions, or transformations in accordance with certain presupposi-tions. In the case of alternative forms, some are chosen, without any \u0002 rm criteria upon which such selection should be based. Therefore, when one copy presents Ionian forms and another Dorian ones, what authorizes us to determine the dialect of the alleged archetype?11 We might even point out that there is a basic prejudice according to which the archetype had to be a text that was of high poetic quality, which the scribes limited themselves to spoiling, forcing the choice of the variant in each case according to what seems to be more beautiful aesthetically, better constructed, or which “sounds better”.The position of Pugliese Carratelli seems to be more cautious.12 He considers that it is obvious these texts derive with more or fewer altera-tions from a \u001b\u0002\u001c\u001d\u0004 \u0011\u0018\u0019\b\u0004, but he argues that the relations between the canonical model and the texts incised on the sepulchral tablets cannot be assimilated to the archetypes of a literary text and manuscripts. Alterations, which are well known, can occur in every manuscript tradi-tion. Yet, regarding this type of esoteric text we may also have to take into consideration the lack of will to \u0002 nd meaning in expressions that are transcribed incorrectly, in a pious and mechanical way. Pugliese Carratelli concludes that there was a \u001b\u0002\u001c\u001d\u0004 \u0011\u0018\u0019\b\u0004 (read? oral?), from which they preserve essential elements, and the copies recovered the 9 More recently, Cassio (1994) tries to reconstruct the language of the archetype.10 Cf. Bernabé (1992), (2000b).11 Why should one refer \u001e\u000f\f\u001f\t \u000b\u001a etc. to the archetype—that is, an Ionic form rather than \u001e\u000f\f\u000b!\u000b\u001a, as in L 1? Why should one prefer the formulation of Pharsalus \b\u001b \u0007\u0013 \u000f\u0002 \u0002\u0003\u001c\"\u000f\b\u001a\f\u000b\u0006 # \f\u0006 $\u001c\u0013\b\u0004 \u0002\u0003\u000f\u000b%\u0006\r\u001a\u0002\u0006\u0004 to the one from Hipponion (which, we should not forget, is more ancient) \b\u001b \u0007\u0013 \u000f\u0002 \u0002\u0003\u001c\"\u000f\b\u001a\f\u000b\u0006 &\u001a' %\u001c\u000b\u000f' (\u0002\t\u000b\u0011)*\u000b\u0006\u000f\u0006, etc.? No doubt because the ancient reading \b\u0015\u0011\b\u0013\u0002\u001a\f\b\u0004 of the following verse from Hipponion did not give a suf\u0002 ciently clear sense. It is of no use when Janko, faced by this same situation, chooses to give both variants, as a “doublet”, marked with an antisigma. \u000b\u0015\f+\u001c &*\b' \u0019,\u001a\b\u0004 \b\u0015\u001c\u0012\u001a\u0006\b\u001a is referred to the archetype because it is also in the tablet from Malibu. Is this a good enough reason? Why is \u000b-.\u000b better than /\u000b? Why does West, with a stroke of the pen, eliminate from his archetype the two \u0002 nal verses of the tablet from Hipponion? Many other questions of the same order could be raised.12 Pugliese Carratelli (1975) 227, Calame (2006) 234 f.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 22911/7/2007 5:55:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"230 chapter twelveformulas as well as they could. According to him, these considerations invite us not to intervene too drastically in the texts, which are certainly related but not twin, and which re\u0003 ect particular aspects of diverse milieus and moments.12.2. Functional textsHaving reached this point, we must associate the literary problem with two important questions in order to try to solve it: the characteristics of their physical support, and the fact that we are dealing with func-tional texts.Our texts’ physical support consists of very small gold tablets. They have to be small, both because the price of gold dissuades people from using a very long text, and because the dead man or woman had to transport them into the other world. The size of the tablets does not allow for long, complete literary written texts, as might be the case for a poem, in which a more or less closed structure is created, where anything considered necessary is to be said.Regarding their character as functional texts, the tablets are clearly intended to achieve an immediate end (some to help the dead man to remember fundamental details when he enters into the other world, others to accompany the dead man in his passage with words of good omen, perhaps with magical pretensions, and others, to put words into his mouth that are acceptable to the infernal deities). The text must therefore be reduced to the indispensable minima. Let us adduce an example that is vulgar and distant, but, we hope, valid. Just as no one writes down meticulously what he has to bring home from the super-market, nor does he note down a telephone message with the totality of what has been said, so the deceased cannot take with him to Hades a \u0003 owery description of what awaits him. He takes along with him, noted down, the indispensable elements, for instance, in the case of the tablets from the \u0002 rst group, which fountain must be avoided, where he must go and what he must say. The rest—including the excellent destiny, eternal and happy, that awaits him—will be given to him in addition, and the initiate probably has some idea of all this. During his life, he has probably heard one or several Orphic poems in which what was awaiting him was described in detail, but he does not need to take this detailed written description with him to Hades. One takes along a kind of aide-mémoire, in which not everything is explicit, but whose complete oversight represents an irreparable error.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23011/7/2007 5:55:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" literary questions 231The consequence of this demand for brevity and its utilitarian char-acter is that basic postulates of Orphic beliefs are included in these texts, selected due to their importance, probably ritual or informative, which created a closed ensemble in each document. In some cases (that of the Cretan tablets), a highly established, highly reiterated text has been set, leaving very little margin for improvisation. However, this is not the most general case. In the longer tablets of the \u0002 rst group, we see much greater room for maneuver.The \u0002 xed and indispensable data to guide the soul through the Beyond coincide (the cypress tree, the fountains, the passwords, what must be said to the guardians), and refer to one and the same type of literature. However, each text has used the minimum of data necessary to con\u0002 gure a different unit, which is also conditioned by the size of the gold tablet available. Each poet strings together these well-known, formulaic utterances that derive from tradition, mixed with varied mortar of other verses from the Orphic corpus, Homeric formulas, etc., according to the greater or lesser competence of their author. This diverse origin also gives a satisfactory explanation of the dialectal mixtures we constantly \u0002 nd in our documents.If this opinion is correct—and we believe it is at least likely—trying to make a compositum from several of them is an almost impossible under-taking. The tablets may not have a unique archetype. They derive from a variety of models, and each one con\u0002 gures an independent reality.Nevertheless, we can go somewhat deeper into the study of this set of problems. Thus, it is appropriate to ask ourselves now from what literature the coincident elements might derive (§ 12.3), the relation of the tablets to ritual (§ 12.4), the possible uses of the tablets (§ 12.5), and the relation between use and thematic motifs (§ 12.6).12.3. The possible model of the tabletsThe model that was to provide the materials for the composition of the tablets could well have been a Descent of Orpheus to the lower world, of which we have several reports,13 including fragments of a late version with great similarities to book VI of the Aeneid, the Bologna Papyrus.14 We do not know whether this was a single poem, or a tradition as unstable 13 Cf. OF 707–711. On this question, cf. Riedweg (1998).14 Cf. OF 717, with bibliography.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23111/7/2007 5:55:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"232 chapter twelveas that of the Theogonies. Since we lack fragments transmitted by another means of this or these works, we can only reconstruct hypothetically what may have been the order of the events narrated.It would probably start with a reference to the beginning of the journey, at the moment when the initiate’s death and his soul’s voyage to Hades occur. It is at this moment that Mnemosyne, the goddess of Memory, plays an important role: she must help the initiate to remember what he must and must not do and say.The tablets from Hipponion, Petelia, Pharsalus and those from Eleutherna relate to the \u0002 rst stage. Reference would be made to how the remaining dead drink from the fountain of Lethe and forget, whereas the initiate must resist the bait of the fountain situated beside the shining cypress tree and come, on the contrary, to the fountain of Mnemosyne, and how he will \u0002 nd himself there before guardians to whom he must pronounce the password: “I am a son of Earth and of starry Heaven”.This enables the initiate’s soul to continue along the sacred path along which his fellow companions in initiation travel, a path that would bring them before Persephone and other infernal gods (in a scene that would not, in our opinion, be very different from the characteristic setting we \u0002 nd on the Apulian vases).15 The dialogue between the soul and the goddess, recorded in the tablets from Thurii, would then be narrated. The soul declares its purity, and the fact that it belongs to a group of the pure ones, and manifests a series of mystical passwords that allude to the set of Orphic beliefs concerning the Beyond. After this exchange, the soul would accede to the meadow of the blessed, and would achieve its \u0002 nal happy state.An account was probably given in this katabasis of the alternative possibility, that is, the destiny met by those who have not been initiated, who forget the password before the guardians or who are not accepted by Persephone. All the known poems narrating descents to the under-world of this type (from the Bologna Papyrus by way of Book VI of the Aeneid, to Dante’s Divine Comedy) present both the fate of those who do achieve a better destiny and that of those who fail to achieve it. In the tablets, we lack information with regard to those who fail to achieve a better situation in the other world. And it is logical that things should be this way, for only the information that is immediately useful for the initiate has been selected, that which refers to what he must do and 15 Cf. § 10.7.3.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23211/7/2007 5:55:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" literary questions 233say, therefore references to what he must not do or say are taken for granted. It might also be considered a bad omen to recall such a pos-sibility of failure at the moment of death.However, Platonic references to a Sacred Tale in which it is said that the non-initiates will lie in the mud or will be condemned to carry water in a sieve, the omnipresent references in other sources to those who have “fallen into the mud”16 make feasible the supposition that in the poem or poems that served as a basis for tablets’ references, there could have also been a mention of the punishment received by the non-initiated in similar terms.Riedweg has made an interesting attempt to reconstruct, on the basis of the tablets, a \u001b\u0002\u001c\u001d\u0004 \u0011\u0018\u0019\b\u0004 concerning the fate of the soul in the Beyond, which would have been transmitted to the faithful during the ritual.17 Based of the text of the tablets, this scholar distinguishes six different scenes or moments in the story line: death and katabasis of the soul, description of the topography in the palace of Hades, meeting with Persephone and the other gods, exchange of passwords, situation of the blessed, and \u0002 nal exhortation of the initiate. To defend the ritual use of this \u001b\u0002\u001c\u001d\u0004 \u0011\u0018\u0019\b\u0004, Riedweg presents reasons of a for-mal nature such as the combination of verse and prose offered by the text of the tablets.18 He and other researchers have applied modern methods of analysis to the narrative and dialogic models of the tablets, in an attempt to determine the structure of the story line (following structuralist methods such as those of Greimas and Propp), examin-ing the actantial components and distinguishing the informative and descriptive acts from the performative ones, which tend towards the realization of what is said.1912.4. The tablets’ relation to ritualThe tablets’ relation to the ritual world seems clear. It can even be said that they provide a perfect illustration of the relation between ritual 16 Aristoph.

Among the \u0007\u001c0*\u0002\u001a\u000b, we \u0002 nd mentions of fasting and sacri\u0002 ce,23 no doubt bloodless, allusions to the ingestion of milk or wine,24 and mentions of other cultic elements, such as \u0002 re, thunderbolts, crowns, and, of course, references to the ritual purity of the believer.25 In addition, the numerous references in the tablets to the ritual \u0011\u0002\u0019\u0018*\u0002\u001a\u000b include invocations and supplications to divinities,26 puns on words and passwords. According to Graf,27 the verses of L 7 were used in a ritual that staged the death and resurrection of the initiate, after the god’s image and likeness, which would be followed by the makarismos with vital instructions and the promise of future blessedness.The size of the tablets made it necessary to reduce the references to the \u0007\u001c0*\u0002\u001a\u000b and the \u0011\u0002\u0019\u0018*\u0002\u001a\u000b to an indispensable minimum, but it is most likely that the dead initiate had previously learned the clues to decipher this synthetic content in the ritual.28 It has been suggested29 that the dactylic verses and the passages in rhythmic prose were recited by a telestes or by the initiates themselves during the ritual. Moreover, some dialogues30 suggest that the teaching of this type of experience took place as a dramatic representation, in which a narrator, who 20 As is shown by the enigmatic expression (L 8, 3) “Hail, after having had the experience you never had before”.21 L 1, 15–16 denotes the fact that the believer belongs to a select group of initiates: “you too will go along the sacred way / along which the other initiates and bacchoi advance, glorious”. L 7, 7 speaks of rituals that have been completed. 22 Riedweg (1998), (2002a), Graf-Johnston (2007) 137 ff.23 L 12, 6: “Fasts for seven days. Zeus who sees all”, 7 f.: “Beautiful sacri\u0002 ces/ Sacri\u0002 ces”.24 L 7, 3 ff.: “as a bull, you leapt into the milk”, “as a ram, you fell into the milk” (cf. L 8, 4; L 9, 10), expressions of beatitude that probably refer to a ritual in which the initiate drank milk. L 7, 6: “You have wine, that happy privilege”. 25 L 9–10, 1: “I come from among the pure, pure”, which reveals the fact of belonging to a group of initiates, characterized by its solidarity and its maintenance of a similar ritual situation.26 Such as the First-Born One, Mother Earth, the Cybelean One, the daughter of Demeter (that is, Persephone), or Zeus, among others; cf. L 12.27 Graf (1991) 98 ff.; cf. Graf-Johnston (2007) 138 f., Obbink (forthcoming).28 The symbolism, and the dif\u0002 culty implied in knowing how to choose the right formula and the appropriate moment to pronounce it, especially in the ultraterrestrial passage, do not seem to leave room for improvisation.29 Riedweg (1998) 371 and n. 49.30 For Calame (1996) 12, the words of the tablets pronounced by the faithful often have the value of cultic acts.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23411/7/2007 5:55:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" literary questions 235might have represented the mythic Orpheus, and the faithful would take part. In accordance with all these factors, it might be argued that the faithful came to the ritual with their own tablets, in order to use them as a reminder of what they were to do and say. Some facts might point in the direction of this hypothesis. First, the ivy-leaf form of the tablets from Pelinna, a plant that played a prominent role in Dionysiac cults.31 Secondly, the tablet from Pharsalus was placed inside a rich bronze hydria, a recipient which is associated with the symposiac and the funerary world, and with which libations were offered to the dead in the ritual that would later be known as \u0010\u001a\r.\t1\u0006\u0004 or refrigerium,32 so that the fact that the tablet was placed there may have been dictated by ritual reasons. Finally, we must not reject out of hand the possibility that some tablets may have been folded as a ritual act. Contrary to these indications, the numbers of tablets that have appeared is small, probably because of the high price of gold. It may perhaps be prefer-able to think that another type of “book”—that is, of support—was generally used in the ritual, more economical and easy to handle, made of a perishable material, such as, for instance, papyrus.We know that ritual books were used in the Orphic cult.33 The Gurôb Papyrus (OF 578) no doubt constitutes the clearest and most complete testimony to what one of them must have been like: it is written on a an easy-to-handle support, and contains essential guidelines on what was to be done and said at various acts of the ritual. In a certain sense, the tablets may be considered the equivalent of the books the initiates used in the ritual: they are brief because they contain only the minimum indications necessary for helping the dead believer remember everything fundamental for mastering the passage through Hades, and they are made of gold, because, unlike ritual texts on papyrus, which can be replaced, the tablets are intended to last forever. In a belief-system in which the \f\u0002\u0011\u0002\f\" is conceived as a preparation for confronting corpo-real death, it is logical to suppose that in it the believer was instructed on such aspects as the underworld geography or the soul’s destiny in the other world, and it is not far fatched to think that believers and priests may have used texts similar to the contents of the tablets for 31 Cf. Jiménez San Cristóbal (forthcoming 3) § 3.4.2. If the tablets have the form of a heart, they would allude to the ritual of the death and resurrection of Dionysus.32 Cf. App. II n. 8.33 Jiménez San Cristóbal (2002b). On Orphic Hieroi logoi, see also Baumgarten (1998), Riedweg (2002), Henrichs (2003).BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23511/7/2007 5:55:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236 chapter twelvetheir rites, although they were certainly inscribed on physical supports that were more economical and, unfortunately, perishable.34 In any case, the Gurôb Papyrus and the Orphic tablets are two examples of fully functional texts, used at two moments that are transcendental for the believer: the \f\u0002\u0011\u0002\f\" and the death.12.5. Various uses of the tabletsThe text of the tablets and the form in which they appear presents us with some orientating pathways regarding the functions attributed to them. It seems clear that the answers concerning the use of the tablets can be various, and not necessarily mutually exclusive. Almost always, one and the same tablet may include different functions, although some may be predominant in some copies, while others in others. The fact that the same functions are encountered in different copies in various combinations, without any contradiction, indicates that the differences between the texts of the tablets are rather the result of a selection on the part of the poet (or the client) than of differences in religious context. As principal uses, we could indicate: the soul’s instruction concerning its transmundane journey, the identi\u0002 cation of the mystes or proof of initiation, the anticipation of \u0002 nal destiny (which is at the same time an attempt to propitiate it), the salutation to the underworld gods, their use as ritual \u0011\u0002\u0019\u0018*\u0002\u001a\u000b and their magical use. We shall say a few words about each of them.12.5.1. Instructions for the BeyondThe tablets from Hipponion, Entella, Petelia, and Pharsalus, and more brie\u0003 y those from Crete and Thessaly (L 1–L 6) are like a vademecum,35 instructing the deceased on his passage to the Yonder World from earth. A personage describes to him the geography he will encounter upon his arrival in the Beyond, and exhorts him to carry out or avoid spe-ci\u0002 c acts, and to utter speci\u0002 c words in the presence of guardians who 34 On an Apulian representation of a dead man before Orpheus with a papyrus in his hand, and on the papyrus from Callatis, cf. App. II nn. 1–2.35 Pugliese Carratelli (1974) 124 and (1975) 228.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23611/7/2007 5:55:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" literary questions 237will come forth to meet him. These tablets are like an aide-mémoire, in case he should, at the last moment, forget the words he was supposed to pronounce, the last stage before achieving the promised destiny of blessedness. The dead woman from Hipponion even bore a lamp in order to be able to read the text in the darkness of the Underworld.12.5.2. Identi\u0002 cation of the mystesIn addition to the password, one tablet from Pherai could itself be a password identifying the initiate. Yet this identi\u0002 catory function is exclu-sive to those tablets (L 16 a–j, m–n) in which a person is identi\u0002 ed by his or her name and condition of *\u0017\u000f\f\u001f\u0004 ‘initiate’. It is understood that the bearer of this type of tablet claimed to demonstrate his condition as an 2(\b\u0006\u001a\b\u0004, ‘free of punishment’. The fact that this group of tablets has this function only does not exclude the possibility that other tablets may have also had, secondarily, this identi\u0002 catory function. In fact, L 1–L 6 do not identify the mystes, but they do denote that the bearer is an initiate, since through his answers he gives evidence that he knows what he must do and that he has participated in the rites.12.5.3. Anticipations of \u0002 nal destinyMany tablets contain an allusion to the souls’ \u0002 nal destiny (L 1, 15–16, L 3, 11, L 7 and 8, L 9, 9, L 10, 7, L 11, 4). Yet L 1, 15–16 limits itself to alluding vaguely to the end of the road, although its main aim is in recalling the obstacles that must be mastered along the road itself. In contrast, L 7 and 8 are salutations to the deceased made by another person. They speak for the soul, and we could say that they are the viewpoint from the world of the living, who salute the dead man, congratulating him on the happiness that awaits him. In L 9–10ab from Thurii, passwords must be uttered referring to its pure condition before Persephone herself. In this case, the tablets are not of the same nature. Not a single one seems to give instructions. One would say that it is the tablet that speaks for itself. The function in these last tablets is not only informative, but also performative, insofar as it is claimed that the promise of blessedness has an effect, like that of a magical enchantment.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23711/7/2007 5:55:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"238 chapter twelve12.5.4. Ritual usesIn § 12.4, we saw that the tablets seem to have a close relation to ritual, and that we can consider some of them (especially those in the Thu-rian series, which accumulates “enigmatic” phrases of a clearly ritual nature), as part of a hieros logos, or its \u0011\u0002\u0019\u0018*\u0002\u001a\u000b. The relevance of the tablets in a funerary environment may be indicative of their impor-tance in earthly ritual, particularly for a cult that conceived ritual as an anticipatory experience preparing the initiated to confront the death of the body. Consequently, we may ask ourselves whether the holders of these beliefs did use texts in which the ritual theme was predominant in their celebrations, as they did at the moment of dying.12.5.5. Use or reuse as amuletsSome scholars have suggested a magic function of the tablets, as an amulet or a talisman.36 For our part, we are inclined to think that such a use can only be demonstrated—at least as predominant—in the post-classical period. In sum, a written gold object that is taken to the grave (and which in some cases was worn during life) cannot com-pletely fail to acquire, in and of itself, an effective value, contributing to the instructive or performative value of the text. Furthermore, we could say that the performative function of the tablets from Pelinna and Thurii is very close to their magical use. Neither the future ‘you will be a god’ (L 9, 9) nor the aorist ‘you became a god’ (L 8, 4) or ‘you have just been born’ (to a new life, L 7, 1), nor the perfect ‘you have been transformed into a goddess’ (L 11, 4) express a desire, but the observation of a reality, whether imminent or already realized. There is only a step from expressing desires for the deceased’s happi-ness to the idea that it is the declaration itself that produces its effect automatically. It is clear, \u0002 nally, that the tablet from Petelia must have been reused as an amulet in the Roman period.37As far as the Roman tablet is concerned (L 11), either Orphic beliefs had changed a great deal in the centuries intervening between it and the 36 Marshall (1911) Introd. XLVII; “phylacteries” according to Cumont (1949) 277; eine Art Titel zum Talisman according to West (1975) 232 (although Tortorelli Ghidini [1995b] 469 distinguishes between amulet and talisman), cf. also Guthrie (1935) 172 (“the magical was not foreign to Orphism”), Zuntz (1971) 282 ff., Kotansky (1991) 114 ff., Martín Hernández (forthcoming).37 Cf.

The relation between use and appearance or thematic motifsThere have been attempts to correlate different “uses” of the tablets with the form in which they have come to light: in some cases open, in others folded or rolled up. According to Pugliese Carratelli,39 the tablets containing mots de passe appear folded, owing to the need to hide the instructions from the eyes of the profane. However, several of the tablets from Thurii,40 which do not contain such instructions, appear folded, whereas one of the tablets from Crete including pass-words and two from Thurii41 with responses to be given to Persephone were found extended. In general, the extended tablets were placed in the dead man’s hand, whereas the folded ones could be placed in the mouth of the deceased,42 as was done with the obol for Charon, for which reason it has also been thought43 that they were folded so that they could \u0002 t better. However, this hypothesis does not \u0002 t with the fact that the tablets from Pelinna, which were found extended, had been placed on the dead woman’s chest,44 but with signs of having been folded previously. The fact that the tablets were folded45 as a ritual act intended to conceal the sacred words is an attractive hypothesis. The deceased wore some of them on the forehead,46 a place which reveals their identifying function. Exceptional are the cases of the tablet from Petelia (which appeared rolled up and kept in a cylinder held shut by a chain, this not being, however, its original location, since the cylinder is probably from the 2nd cent. A.D., which indicates that the tablet 38 Kotansky (1994) 107; cf. already Zuntz (1971) 334 and Kotansky (1991) 115. In any case, the ritual use of the tablets is not incompatible with their use as amulets.39 Pugliese Carratelli (1974) 124 f.40 L 8, 10a, 12.41 Crete (L 5d), Thurii (L 9, 10b).42 The tablet from Hipponion (L 1). Zuntz (1974) 335 f. n. 2 suggests that placing the tablet in the mouth of the deceased could respond to the desire of placing the correct words on his tongue.43 As was done by Guarducci (1974) 17 f.44 Cf. Tsantsanoglou-Parássoglou (1987) 4.45 In some cases, like the one from Hipponion, they were folded four times, cf. Pugliese Carratelli (1993) 20 ff., (1996) 219.46 L 16, cf. § 8.2.BERNABE_F14_227-240.indd 23911/7/2007 5:55:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"240 chapter twelvemust have been re-used), and the one from Pharsalus, which was placed inside a rich bronze hydria that contained a cremation.47Another question is why different moments of the soul’s journey to the underworld are selected, even in tablets having the same predomi-nant function.L 1–6 refer to the initial moments of the great journey: the \u0002 rst obstacles, the deceptive fountain and the guardians. In contrast, L 9 and L 10 focus on the presentation before Persephone (which we might call the “second obstacle”).The tablets from the Thurian series and the ones from Pelinna describe the \u0002 nal destiny that awaits the initiate, anticipating the condi-tion which the soul will enjoy, its de\u0002 nitive abandonment of the human nature and its accession to the realm of happiness. L 7ab and L 8 are salutations to the dead, made by another person, and the tablets from Pelinna seem to have almost a rather magical, as an amulet (cf. supra). The greeting formulas to the underworld gods seem to refer to the moment at which the deceased enters the grove of the blessed. In general, the ones we have called “identi\u0002 catory” would refer to any moment of the journey, insofar as they would serve for the mystes to be recognized anywhere.It is, however, important to point out that no relation can be estab-lished between the various stages of the journey re\u0003 ected by the tablets and the places in which they have come to light, since, as we have just seen, in Magna Graecia, for instance, we \u0002 nd tablets that are vadem-ecums, others with an identifying function, and others that describe the initiate’s \u0002 nal destiny. Nor can a relation be established between the various “types” and different religious contexts, since we have seen all kinds of combinations. Thus, among the tablets we have called “identifying”, some contain what seems to be a formula of salutation to the infernal goddess (L 16b: “to Persephone, Posidippus, pious mystes”), which unites the Macedonian tablets to those from Crete. The identi\u0002 cation as a mystes is also important in the tablets we have called vademecums. Finally, the ritual references appear anywhere, and noth-ing indicates that they contradict each other. Once again and again, we observe that the tablets belong to one and the same religious scheme, which we have no hesitation in considering as Orphic.47 Cf.

Each of the images collected here establishes a dialogue, sometimes necessarily conjectural and imprecise, with the contents of the texts. In general, the reader will not \u0002 nd a reproduction or faithful copy of literary quotations in these representations, for word and image are ruled by their own laws, and develop in their own environments and contexts. Not always coinciding interests canalize the realization of both aspects.Since the 19th cent., researchers have tried to see in some images certain correlations to throw light upon the more obscure contents of Orphism. The modes of approximation have varied over the course of the years. Our vision, still uncertain, is today more rich and nuanced than it was then. The volume of documents has grown. Above all, viewpoints and readings have broadened.In our text, the images will guide us along multiple paths towards the environment of Orphism. Some of them are mere thematic allusions. In other cases, we can see that the correspondence between world and \u0002 guration is more precise and direct.The \u0002 rst two examples introduce us to the funerary meaning of read-ing, the psychological relation between the deceased and the written text. Thus, the woman reading, with the unrolled uolumen, in number 1 (according our numbering), which decorates a lekythos, a vase intended for the grave; or the man on the Apulian vase—number 2—who receives a visit from Orpheus the citharist. He listens to him, seated within the naiskos—his temple and, at the same time, his grave—with a roll in his hand. The initial moment of the passage is represented. Does the roll contain a text with Orphic instructions? We do not know for certain. However, a mediating Orpheus, dressed in the rich attire of an Oriental bard, knows the way towards the subterranean palace of Persephone and Pluto on the Apulian vase, which we describe in number 5.We also include two pinakes or small votive pictures, in clay, from the southern Italian sanctuary of Locri. They allow us a glimpse into the reign of Persephone and Pluto, the solemn gods of the Beyond (n. 3); or else they describe Dionysus in his mediating visit to the infernal worlds (n. 4), a situation we will later encounter in another Apulian vase, n. 6, where the agreement between Dionysus and Pluto is narrated in the form of a dextrarum iunctio.

Since the \u0002 nal decades of the 5th cent. B.C. at least, this representation of Bacchus as mediator in the infernal world over\u0003 ows in numerous Ital-ian images of death.Our n. 8 is of a different nature: a bronze hydria from Pharsalus in Thessaly, the recipient both of the ashes of the deceased and of an Orphic tablet. The handle of this luxurious vase alludes to the mythical rape of Oreithyia by Boreas: a voluntary rape towards the Beyond by the divinity of the winds, assumed by the nymph.The ninth document reproduces the lid of a sarcophagus from Tar-quinia, and once again raises the much-debated problem of the adop-tion of Orphic beliefs on the part of some members of the Etruscan aristocracy. The image of the kid who comes to drink from the pitcher of the dead woman—a follower of Dionysus—has been associated with the enigmatic formula from the Orphic tablets: “A kid, you fell into the milk”. Yet the precise content of this expression still remains an enigma. Other cases of mythical breast-feeding have been adduced in recent research: that of the female Pan who offers her young breast to a kid in the Villa dei Misteri at Pompei, if the decorative ensemble of the room is understood as the initiation of the domina or lady of the house into the mysteries (n. 10); or the numerous terracottas of kourotrophoi goddesses found in the Italian funerary surroundings (n. 11), but also in other areas of the Mediterranean, as well as within the Iberian region (Olmos 2000–2001). It is suggested that entry into the Beyond is a reception into the kolpos or womb of the feminine divinity, a role played by Persephone in the Orphic tablets.The motif of the refreshing drink after a long, dif\u0002 cult journey such as death’s, the refrigerium, is documented in various cultures of the ancient world, from the Near East and Egypt to Rome. The comparison enables us to extend the paradigm widening its borders in time and space. We have chosen a few examples from Egyptian eschatology (n. 12). The motif of living water persists in Christianity and in Gnostic beliefs (nn. 13 and 14). The meaning of some of these images is dif\u0002 cult to grasp and elusive, like the paintings from the late hypogeum of the Aurelii at Rome, where some authors have wished to see an amalgam of Homeric motifs and Orphic allusions.We conclude our selection with a mention of the images and contexts of some Orphic tablets, such as the ivy leaf from Pelinna in Thessaly, and the gold sheath, with a \u0002 ligree chain, which contained the folded tablet from Petelia at a later period (n. 15). We thereby wish to point BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 27611/8/2007 1:00:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" iconographical notes on the orphic tablets 277out the abundance of relations and possible readings that are hidden in the contexts in which the tablets were deposited, as well as the very avatars of their history.Undoubtedly, the selection of images could have been different. Our choice has only the ambition of being a collection of samples, without any pretension of exhausting the theme. Instead, our text aims at formulating a mere suggestion of how word and image are related and how they interact. The content of this dialogue consists of the instructions of the Orphic tablets. These images would lead us back to the study by Alberto Bernabé and Ana Isabel Jiménez, since the chapters by these authors have constantly invited the reader to contrast the multiple perspectives and horizons of the problem in the world of images.N. 1. Attic LEKYTHOS of a woman with a VOLUMENThe lekythos is a perfume vase for offerings on the tombs of the dead. This example, from the Louvre, has the elegant tubular form of the lekythoi made at Athens in the mid-5th cent. perfumes B.C. (\u0002 g. 1). The shoulder is decorated with the usual palmettos in dark outline. On the cylindrical body, in red \u0002 gures, a standing woman wearing a \u0002 ne tunic with thick folds over her left shoulder constitutes the axis of the pictorial composition that centers our attention. She is framed on both sides by various objects, which situate the scene in a domestic interior. On the right hangs the wide ribbon, carefully folded, of the bonnet or sakkós with which virtuous women cover their hair. At her feet we see an open chest, probably wooden, with its lid open. The woman has just taken a papyrus roll from the chest, which unrolls before her eyes. Absorbed, her head inclines slightly towards the writing. There is a perfect harmony, characteristic of the classical moment, between the position of the body in light repose, and the intense inner attitude.Gilles Sauron1 has put forth a suggestive conjecture: the reader may be holding a book on the afterlife in her hands. Charles Picard2 had already previously suggested that the little boxes represented next to the deceased in stelae from classical times (like the one of Hegesus at 1 Cf. Sauron (1998) 77–78, \u0002 g. 11.2 Cf.

The precise meaning of the Louvre lekythos remains ambiguous. Here, it is clear that the precious object relating the woman to the chest is the uolumen. However, other Attic vases from the Classical period represent the paideia of a woman exercising herself in poetry and in music through the possession and reading of a papyrus roll.3 On a hydria from a private collection in New York, a woman seated in a klismos on a bema or stool plays the lyre at the same time as she \u0002 xes her gaze on an open roll held by a companion on her right. At the musician’s feet, a large open box indicates, on our lekythos, the rich chest that preserves and transports the uolumen. On another hydria, the absorbed reader is Sappho, accompanied by the Muses who offer her the lyre. “The world of women is not alien to the Muses”, we read in Euripides’ Medea (v. 1089). Various Attic vases of the Classical period emphasize this paideia of a woman of high rank, her mastery of singing and writing through mythical models (the environment of Helicon) and the idealized past (Sappho). There is a noteworthy temporal ambiguity in these representations: the woman within her home is, at the same time, the dead woman in the Beyond. The exercise of recitation linked both worlds together. She is simultaneously mortal and a Muse.Our lekythos belongs to those vases that ennoble a woman’s activity in death, her high rank and paideia. However, we must not discard the attractive proposal of Gilles Sauron: that it is indeed a funerary text that absorbs the reader’s attention, like the Orphic papyrus found among the remains of an aristocrat’s pyre at Derveni in Macedonia, or the tomb, from the mid-4th cent. B.C., erected on a tumulus of stones, from the Greek colony at Callatis on the Black Sea:4 the right hand of a male skeleton held a written papyrus roll, scarcely decipherable. A patera with eggs—we recall the Orphic symbolism of the egg—accompanied the burial.3 On women exercising in reading, cf. Kaufmann-Samaras (1997). Sappho as a reader among the Muses: red-\u0002 gured hydria from Athens, MN 1260, ca. 460 B.C. (Kaufmann, \u0002 g. 6); a young reader of a uolumen: medallion of a red-\u0002 gured cup from the Louvre by the Wedding Painter (Kaufmann, \u0002 g. 8); a reciter of poetry: hydria from a private collection in New York, ca. 460 B.C., by the Niobid Painter (Kaufmann, \u0002 g. 9).4 On the tomb at Calatis, cf.

The fact that the \u0002 gure is alone in her feminine environment—which in turn is a metaphor for her tomb—invites the hypothesis that the papyrus was for exclusively individual use, kept like a jewel. The \u0002 gure gains access to a superior environment by means of the privilege and distinction of writing.See n. 2.N. 2. Apulian amphora with Orpheus and a man with a VOLUMENThis large Apulian red-\u0002 gured amphora5 from the Basel Antikenmu-seum, attributed to the Ganymedes painter, is dated to between 330 and 320 B.C., and attracts our attention because of the singular theme of its principal scene (\u0002 gs. 2–3). Inside a small white temple or naiskos, framed by two slender Ionian columns, a seated male greets Orpheus. The temple is raised above a high podium decorated with a fret. It is crowned by a pediment, partially preserved. The beams of the ceiling and the red walls behind the columns suggest depth and perspective. This is a funerary monument: it is a noble building that exalts the deceased and establishes the limits of this world and the Beyond.6 Before it, the entourage presents libations and offerings; one of them has even deposited an oblong shield, which leans on its base against the foot of the column.The interior of the temple represents the dwelling-place of the deceased in the realm of the afterlife, the heroic space proper to the \f\r\u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011\u000e or meliores. Its appearance is similar to the domain of the infernal gods, whom the man is emulating (cf. n. 5). Paradoxically, from the viewpoint of the external space of life, this is an environment of splendor and whiteness. The man’s body stands out like a statue in white, like his tunic. Only the purple-colored mantle, gathered up on the lower half of his body, serves as a contrast and visual relief. The objects that hang from the roof and background of the naiskos are the man’s belongings, which allude to his heroic condition: on the left, the conical cap or pilos (similar to that of heroes like Odysseus); the two 5 Antikenmuseum and Ludwig Collection, Basel, inv. n. 540.

The man, with long beard and long white curly hair that falls over his shoulders, is seated on a folding chair or diphros okladias, a portable chair suitable for a journey or a road.7 Orpheus the priest is dressed in a rich Oriental out\u0002 t, with long sleeves, a red Phrygian cap and a \u0003 owing tunic, which suggests he is still walking, or has just arrived. His cithara, which he plays with a plectrum, is white and decorated.An intense relation is established between both \u0002 gures. The man may be holding a text of funerary initiation in his hands. He addresses Orpheus the priest with the extended \u0002 ngers of his right hand, and asks him a question. On the tablet from Hipponion, it is Mnemosyne, the Muse of memory who probably reminds the deceased of the path to the afterlife (cf. § 1.2.). Here, it is Orpheus, a descendant of the Muse and connoisseur of the meanders of the underworld, who recalls with his song before the deceased the contents of the written papyrus, which the latter, on the threshold of death, keeps in his hand. He is certainly a devotee initiated into Orphism. He drinks up attentively the words of Orpheus, which will introduce him into the underworld. Whatever the contents of the text may have been, he receives from the Thracian bard the privilege of the sacred scripture, his condition as a mystes.For the dwelling-place of Persephone and Pluto, see our n. 5, the great crater from Munich. Both the temple and the seated heroic \u0002 g-ure of the man recall very closely the scene from Munich. One may, moreover, compare his expressive gesture with that of Pluto’s \u0002 ngers. The wheels of the chariot also evoke the infernal palace. Perhaps, as researchers on the vase propose, the deceased aspires to identify with the god, in his post-mortem repose. The initiate into the mysteries himself becomes a god. Orpheus’ song could very well deal with the descent to the underworld, whose traces we \u0002 nd in the tablets, or perhaps, as in the charred papyrus from Derveni, with the re-encounter with his divine origins, or his own theogony.See also n. 1.7 On the reverse of one of the bone tablets from Olbia (which we translate as c in §1.6.) appears a schematic drawing which West (1982) 24 f. interprets tentatively as the representation of a chair such as this, comparing it with one from a skyphos from the 5th cent. B.C. preserved in the Louvre (G 146), in which another chair has been drawn, covered by something that may be a \u0003 eece.

The PINAKES of Locri and the realm of PersephoneAt the beginning of the last century, excavations at Locri brought to light a rich store of terracottas hidden in wells in the sacred area or sanctu-ary to Persephone, in the region or “contrada” of Mannella. These are votive deposits, in which offerings were accumulated after having been exposed for some time in the sacred enclosure of the goddess: they all display two openings in their upper part, from which they would be hung in a visible place in the sanctuary. The set is now preserved in the Archaeological Museum at Reggio. Although the sanctuary was used much later, all these tablets or pinakes are curiously dated to the second quarter of the 5th cent. B.C.Their iconography is related to feminine rituals around Persephone: nuptial initiations, processions of girls, the preparation and care of the peplos and dresses for a bride, the presentation of a divine child (Adonis?) in a wicker basket, etc.8 Scenes related to the telluric world and the afterlife are abundant. Some present the ritual of the anthologia or collection of \u0003 owers, and the karpologia or collection of fruit, which a nubile girl carries out with stylized gestures before Persephone: she collects pomegranates, a sacred fruit that introduces young women into the realm of death, in the ample kolpos or lap of her peplos. Various fruits are represented.The infernal couple of Pluto and Persephone stand out, although this type of votive relief also presents this goddess in relation with Dionysus. On a pinax from Locri,9 the god of the vine approaches with religious respect his mother Persephone—like a believer or a “bacchios”—, to whom he offers the attributes of wine: the kantharos and the branch over his shoulder, covered with heavy bunches of grapes (\u0002 g. 4). She holds a cock, an infernal animal of passage (on the cock, cf. n. 4) and a sprouting stalk of wheat, a display accompanied by the sacred, nuptial gesture of uncovering herself.8 On these representations, cf. Langlotz-Hirmer (1965) plates 71–75; Pugliese Car-ratelli (1990a) 279, and \u0002 gs. 431–437 on pp. 294–295; (1996) 700 f., n. 166. Sourvinou-Inwood (1978) defends a reading of these images in the sanctuary in relation to the feminine universe.

PINAX from Locri with Persephone and Pluto enthronedIn the example we reproduce here,10 Persephone, represented as the “queen of the subterranean beings” to whom the tablets from Thurii allude, is seated beside her paredros Hades on a rich throne with a soft cushion (\u0002 g. 5). Her bare feet rest on a shared footstool. The divine couple is solemnly portrayed in its twofold attitude of presenting their gifts and accepting offerings before an invisible donor, with whom they establish a silent, attentive relation.Persephone is covered respectfully by a long nuptial veil: the tablets from Thurii call her “chaste” (cf. § 4). A diadem embraces her hair. We can distinguish her ear with an earring—she is a goddess who is epekoos, or ready to listen—as well as a collar with the edge of a long lock that falls over her breast. The tunic, with the \u0002 nest of folds, reaches her feet. In her hands she holds a cock, and three ripe sprigs, her usual attribute, the “fruits of the earth” which she will send to men as sung in the Orphic Hymn 29, 17 (cf. the text in p. 68).Hades, bearded and wearing a vegetal crown, presents a \u0003 owering branch and a patera or phiale decorated with an egg-and-dart motif, no doubt made of precious metal. In front of the throne rises a tall bronze perfume burner or thymiaterion. Burned perfume is appropriate for the goddess, who reigns among the pure. The oblong lid of the thymiaterion ends in a small cock, who faces the divine couple.11 It is the animal that belongs to Persephone, since it appears for a third time, attentively \u0003 anking the throne of its mistress. Cocks allude to the world of the afterlife: as intermediaries between the soul and the Beyond, they intercede between the world of the dead and that of the living.The thymiaterion and the offerings allow us to imagine the presence of the invisible believer who, by depositing the image in the temple, renders himself present before the infernal couple.

Large Apulian crater with Persephone and Pluto in their underworld palaceThe detail we note here belongs to a monumental South Italian volute crater from the Munich Museum.12 The work of an Apulian workshop, of the so-called “Underworld Painter”, the vase offers one of the most complete representations of the complex Greek eschatological universe of the last decades of the 4th cent. B.C. (\u0002 g. 6).We are interested in the center and the upper zone of the large main panel. A white aedicula presides over the scene and attracts our gaze. It is the palace of Pluto and Persephone, sustained by six elegant Ionian columns. This building may be compared with the naiskos of the Orphic initiate described previously (\u0002 gs. 2–3). It is conceived from a conventional perspective. Two wheels hang in the background, alluding to the chariot of the god in which Kore, the girl who now is queen, arrived one day, having been abducted by Hades or Pluto to this subterranean realm.The god, in richly embroidered attire, is seated on a throne, and his shod feet rest on a footstool. In his left hand he holds the regal scepter, which ends in the shape of a bird. The goddess is walking towards the entrance, but turns towards Pluto and looks at him. He then addresses Persephone with an expressive hand gesture. Something is happening. The arrival of an unexpected visitor has caused expectation in the palace. It is Orpheus, before the royal threshold. Persephone, in a meditative attitude, listens to the announcement and instructions of her husband. Or is it Hades who, as a male, begins the dialogue directly with the newly arrived person? We recall the gesture of the male on the amphora from Basel, in our \u0002 gure 3.12 Apulian volute crater, Munich n. 3297. Cf.

As is customary in these scenes, she holds a great \u0003 aming torch in the shape of a four-armed cross with both hands, with which she illuminates the infernal world. Yet the \u0002 ngers of her right hand do not neglect to raise the edge of the veil, disposed beneath the white basket or kalathos that crowns her head, in a gesture appropriate to conjugal devotion. This is the anakalypsis or unveiling of the face before the husband, which can quickly turn into a modest conceal-ment (enkalypsis) before the recently arrived \u0002 gure. In the gold tablets, Persephone is called pure, chaste (cf. supra, the commentaries on § 4).Orpheus is dressed in the Oriental manner, as a Thracian bard. His long sacerdotal vestment stirs to the rhythm of his dance steps. He strikes the earth with the tips of his toes, which he measures to the sounds of the seven-chorded cithara “which he now plucks with his \u0002 ngers, now strikes with his marble plectrum” (Verg., Aeneid 6, 647), while he looks the gods in the eye in an attempt to seduce them with his song. He has arrived at the threshold of the underworld kingdom accompanied by a small family group, a male, a woman and a child, who follow his steps to the sound of the magical instrument.13 This scene has gener-ally been interpreted as Orpheus’ introduction of a family of initiates, “free of punishment” as is said in one tablet from Pherai (L 13; cf. § 4.2.). Others doubt this, however, and propose that they must be three mythical personages, whose names we cannot specify.Amongst the extremely rich decoration of the rest of the vase, numer-ous personi\u0002 cations and heroes populate this realm of the Beyond. Here Dikê or Justice appears alongside Theseus and Peirithous; here are the Judges of the Underworld, Aeacus, Minos and Rhadamanthys; here are the Erinyes and the Furies; here are such sinners as Sisyphus with his rock, and Tantalus; here is Hermes psychopompos. In this realm that depicts cosmic justice and punishment for the impious acts of non-initiates, a character who cannot be missing is the guardian of the infernal world, the three-headed dog Cerberus, tamed by Hercules, the liberator.13 Orpheus’ offering of a lyre to a dead man in the realm of Hades, represented on an Apulian crater by the Underworld Painter, is interpreted by M. Schmidt as a possible vademecum for the latter’s eternal salvation.

Apulian funerary crater depicting the pact between Dionysus and Pluto in the afterlifeA volute crater preserved in the Museum of Art in Toledo (Ohio, U.S.A.),offers us the only extant representation of a pact in the infernal world between Dionysus and the god Hades (\u0002 g. 7). A suggestive study by Sarah Iles Johnston and Timothy J. McNiven sheds light on the relation between this scene and the beliefs of Orphism, and the role played by Dionysus as mediator.15Our drawing focuses on the central detail of this vase, dominated by the palace of Hades, framed by Ionic columns and \u0002 nished off with lovely \u0003 oral acroteria which reproduce polychrome terracotta models. This is the type of building we encounter in many South Italian repre-sentations, as in the previous crater from the Munich Museum (n. 5).Inside the naiskos are the spouses Hades and Persephone. The god of the infernal world is seated on a raised, decorated throne. His feet rest on a stool. He is dressed with an ample tunic, but as he is a god in majesty his torso is shown naked. His long curly hair falls over his shoulders, as a sign of extended time or the long duration of his reign. He holds a scepter topped with a bird in his left hand. Persephone is on his right, standing, wearing the tunic, mantle and veil of a married woman, and a polos or cylindrical cap, characteristic of goddesses. She holds the usual cross-shaped torch, which illuminates the realm of shad-ows. The spouses’ gaze is focused on the recently arrived character, a young Dionysus wearing a decorated tunic, with an embroidered fringe, and high boots, which may be an evocation of a theatrical costume. He holds his scepter in his left hand, his narthex or \u0003 owering cane, with ritual ribbons tied to it. Standing before the threshold of the infernal palace, Dionysus meets Pluto’s glance, and extends his hand to him. This is the gesture of the dextrarum iunctio, the interlaced right hands 14 Cf. Aellen (1994).15 Johnston-McNiven (1996). It has been attributed to the Darius Painter, active around 340–330 B.C.

On the right, almost symmetrically to the \u0002 gure of Dionysus, Hermes, another psychopompos god, leans against the temple column: he wears winged shoes, a caduceus, a wide-brimmed hat, a traveler’s petasus and a tunic over his shoulder, \u0003 uttering in the wind, an indication of his recent movement. Hermes, the mediator between both worlds, is a witness to the unusual divine pact. The characters are named in respective inscriptions.At the feet of the naiskos, tied to a column with a long chain, rests the three-headed dog Cerberus, two of whose heads are reposing in the presence of the pact between Dionysus and his master. The third turns backwards, still vigilant. A small Pan with a playful expression entertains the dog, announcing in his way the new agreement of the infernal world. He belongs to the entourage of Dionysus, since he carries a drum or a tambourine in his hand. He is not included in our image.The rest of the vase, not reproduced in our drawing, is covered with scenes on both sides of this central group. Behind Dionysus are the personages of his retinue, the world of the bebaccheumenoi or initiates in Bacchus or Dionysus Lysios, the god who liberates the blessed after death. Among them, a maenad with thyrsus and tambourine dances bare-breasted. On the other side of the temple there is an allusion to the condemned, Actaeon and two mortals who did not receive Dionysus when they had the chance, Actaeon and Agave, the latter leaning on a louterion, or a white basin.We are not witnessing this time a mere encounter of a hero, like Heracles or Orpheus, both travelers to the Beyond, with Hades and Persephone at the underworld palace This is a mediation by Dionysus in favor of his adepts. The authors of the aforementioned article place this image in relation with Orphic eschatology. They recall that in the tablets from Pelinna the soul is to tell Persephone that Dionysus has liberated it (cf. § 2.3.). The message of the pact is clear: the initiates in the mysteries of Dionysus, the mystai, will be freed from the wheel and \u0002 nd rest from evils. The vase sheds light on the representation of Dionysus as a divinity of Orphism. It expands and illuminates the pres-ence of so many other Dionysiac images in the South Italic world.BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 29311/8/2007 1:00:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"294 appendix iiN. 7. Terracotta from Locri with a dancing maenadThis lovely little polychrome \u0002 gure found in a grave at Locri16 represents a dancing maenad (\u0002 g. 8). She wears shoes, and her head is crowned. A collar with amulets protects her neck. It depicts the instant of the initia-tory dance in which the \u0002 gure, with both arms outspread and the torso cast slightly backward, directs her gesture and her attentive gaze towards the invisible companion who goes along with her and guides her steps. She imitates her initiator. Filled with Bacchus, the young woman lets her long hair fall freely over her shoulders. With her movement, her tunic or chiton slips from her shoulder, leaving her right breast bare. Her body achieves the freedom of Dionysiac ecstasy; in the mysteries, Bacchus is called Lysios, the Liberator. The sacred nebris—the mottled roe deerskin in which the maenads dress (Euripides, Bacchantes, 111)—hangs over her right arm, next to the tympanon or tambourine, decorated with a star: could this be an allusion to the one who is asterios, or as bright as a star?The statuette was found in the dead woman’s right hand. Her dearly beloved placed it there so that the woman might be initiated into the path of the Beyond as a maenad or follower of Dionysus. She has assumed the new name: she is a dancing Bacchant. Remains of a triple-lobed mouth—which we cannot see in the image—have been identi\u0002 ed on her head: the statuette also served as a wine jug, the wine of the inebriation of Bacchus that accompanies the initiates into the Beyond. It is she herself who contains and offers the wine with her body, for the initiates of Dionysus enjoy an “eternal drunkenness” in the “banquet of the holy” (Plato, Republic 363c–d).In a female tomb (perhaps of an infant) of a necropolis from Meta-pontum,17 excavated in 1983, the statuette of a maenad seated on a rock, resting next to her tambourine or tympanon was found (\u0002 g. 9).Here, the attitude of rest has been chosen, the beatitude that follows the orgiastic dance. In this tomb too, next to the bracelet and a gold collar, a small bronze coin was found, with the image of the two Meta-pontine ears of grain. Coins of small value were generally deposited in the mouth of the deceased, as a symbol or passport for the path in the afterlife.16 Locri Epize\u0002 rii, necropolis of Lucifero contrada (tomb n. 934).

It was a fashion particularly widespread in the 4th cent. B.C. Images of dancing satyrs and maenads are also documented as terra-cotta decorations on 4th cent. sarcophagi. The famous bronze crater of tomb B from Derveni, now in the Museum of Thessalonica, narrates the story of the person cremated there as a “bacchios”, that is, the person who is identi\u0002 ed and assimilated to Bacchus.18 The signs of the great crater associating the pleasure of wine and the symposiac life with the initiate’s mystical knowledge are repeated in Tomb A at Derveni, close to Tomb B described above. In this second case, however, the pyre in which the corpse was burned was also accompanied by an Orphic papyrus, which fortunately was saved from complete combustion.19Let us return to the statuette from Locri, and associate it with the terracotta of the maenad that accompanies the trousseau of the tomb at Pelinna, in Thessaly, where the two ivy-shaped Orphic tablets that are studied in this book came to light (cf. supra, § 2).

Mixed with the ashes, once they had cooled down, the diminutive Orphic tablet whose text is analyzed in this book had been deposited (ch. 1). The container can be dated to the mid-3rd cent. B.C. (\u0002 gs. 10–11).18 On followers of the Bacchic dance, who assume the names of the Dionysiac entou-rage in initiations and imitate its mimicry, as in our statuette, cf.

With it, libations are offered to the dead, in the ritual that would later be known as the anapsyxis or refrigerium. Around the same date as the example from Pharsalus, we also \u0002 nd a hydria at the feet of the lovely Aphrodite by Praxiteles, alluding to the goddess’ ritual bath, which grants her strength and renewed vitality.Water and thirst, banquet, puri\u0002 cation and renovation are some of the attributes that relate the hydria to the deceased who chooses its bronze walls as dwelling place. From the 5th cent. B.C.—and then throughout the 4th cent. into Hellenistic age—the metal or ceramic hydria was to be the favorite vase among the Greeks as a cinerary urn.Often a watchful siren, guardian and protector of the tombs, decorates the beginning of the vertical handle on these hydrias. In this instance, instead of the siren the god Boreas, the North wind, is represented, abducting the Athenian nymph Oreithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens. The god, bearded and naked, with broad wings outspread, one of which enfolds and protects the nymph, raises the girl into the air. She, her hair free and one breast bare, is dressed in a \u0002 ne moving tunic, whose transparent cloth has been made to cling and fold over the curves of her body by the impulse of the wind. The god encircles Oreithyia in his arms, while she tries with her left arm to free herself—or, on the contrary, to hold on—while the \u0002 ngers of her right hand still grip the veil, now useless, with which the maiden used to hide her modest face from men. The gesture now serves to suggest feminine display -anakalypsis-, and along with it her surrender to the god who is abducting her. The attitudes are full of pathos: the man’s face is raised towards the sky, eager; the woman bends down in impotence and, at the same time, acceptance. “If they did not want it, they would not be abducted”, as Herodotus af\u0002 rmed (1, 4).21This image adds a signi\u0002 cant symbolic dimension to the burial, completing the text of the tablet. The person buried there remembers and experiences again the destiny of Persephone, abducted by Pluto and converted into an infernal spouse and queen (cf. n. 5). The motif of abduction expresses the violence of the approach to death and the new condition of the person abducted. Boreas is a demon of transition. 21 On the ambiguous anakalypsis/enkalypsis—unveiling/covering—see the attitude of Persephone in \u0002 g. 6. On feminine abduction in Herodotus, cf.

Violence precedes the liberation the soul will \u0002 nd at the end of its pilgrimage as an initiate. Oreithyia’s implied nudity, and her loose hair, are signs of this new condition, and of her surrender. In the words of Angelo Bottini:Divine intervention becomes a metaphor for the hope of achieving, through faith, a “new life” of the soul, free at last.The image of the hydria, the resting-place of the ashes of the deceased, thus prepares and complements the text of the tablet.The group of the abduction is repeated, with variations in costume and gestures, in other hydrias from this workshop, such as the one from Nesebar (Bulgaria).22N. 9. Sarcophagus from Tarquinia with Bacchant and fawnThe lid of this stone sarcophagus comes from the so-called Tomb of the Triclinium at Tarquinia (Etruria) and is preserved in the British Museum. It is dated to the 3rd cent. B.C.23 (\u0002 g. 12).It represents a woman of serious and solemn expression, dressed as a Bacchant. She rests on a bed with her body slightly bent towards the left side and the right leg folded, indicating her readiness to move. Her head rests on a pillow, making conspicuous her matronly status. This is no idealized and generic \u0002 gure, like the young maenad from Locri (n. 7), but the representation of a real, adult woman.The woman is dressed in a long tunic, which reaches down to her bare feet. Around her breast, she wears the skin of a fawn or nebris, which she gathers up over her right shoulder. Various jewels adorn her, in particular a collar with \u0002 ve bullae or amulet holders, proper to an initiate. Her left hand holds the Bacchic thyrsus, ending in a pine cone, while her right arm, semi-naked and bent at the elbow, grasps Dionysus’ 22 Cf. Los tracios (2005) 157 n. 258.

A baby deer, or perhaps a kid, as some authors have proposed, is approaching. On other sarcophagi from Tarquinia, such as the one named “della Cerbita”, or the little deer,24 the young animal at the dead man’s feet drinks the liquid—milk—from a patera. In that case, it is a man who offers the sustenance. In our example, it remains ambiguous whether the kid or the fawn has come to drink wine from the kantharos, or rather a Dionysiac liquid miraculously transformed into milk. The kantharos’ proximity to the female breast opens the possibility that Dionysus’ vase, in the hands of the maenad, contains indeed milk.The scene has been placed in relation to the mystical nurslings of the Dionysiac world, and with the formula from the Orphic tablets: “a kid, you fell into the milk” (cf. supra § 2.4). In our example, the Orphic allusion is feasible, but is still far from providing a satisfactory explana-tion to the enigmatic formula, which expresses above all the instant and the \u0002 nal result of an impetuous act. On the contrary, the animal approaches cautiously to drink in the images on these sarcophagi, and it seems hard to imagine that it could hurl itself into a closed container much smaller than its body, such as a kantharos.The protection of young animals by goddesses who take them into their lap is a widespread motif in Mediterranean plastic arts. The type of Artemis with a fawn is frequent in terracottas.25A parallel to this motif from other cultural areas of the Mediterra-nean is offered by a large terracotta bust from a necropolis at Cadiz:26 a strange infernal goddess, of superhuman looks, nurtures a young four-legged animal (a fawn?) from a vase she holds in her lap. We do not know if in the examples from Etruria or in this terracotta from Semitic Cadiz we have an echo of the Orphic formula, a mytheme of mystic nursing received and transformed in various cultures of the Mediterranean.The presence of Orphic allusions in Etruscan religion has been much debated, on the basis of ambiguous iconographical support. The scene from the Tarquinia sarcophagus has been adduced as evidence of an Orphic penetration into privileged and Hellenizing layers of Etruscan 24 On the “sarcophagus of the Cerbita”, in Tarquinia, cf.

The woman from Tarquinia, a noble aristocrat, will have held Orphic-Dionysiac beliefs that were in full bloom at the time in Greek colonies of South Italy. Converted into a Bacchant, as in the terracotta from Locri (cf. n. 7), she carries out the functions of the followers of Dionysus in the Beyond.27 According to this interpretation, the animal would be the image of a god-child, nursed after his birth, and the maenad his divine nursemaid, a veritable kourotrophos goddess, freed from her mortality, raised up to the sphere of the dii animales.See also nos. 10 and 11.N. 10. Female Pan nursing a kid in the Villa of the Mysteries at PompeiiMany interpretations have been proposed for the great fresco that decorates the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii. A suggestive reading by Gilles Sauron,28 which we follow here, considers that we have in the pictorial ensemble of this feminine room the initiation of the Domina or Lady of the House into the mysteries of Dionysus and his mother Semele (\u0002 g. 13).The detail reproduced in our image separates two different settings: that of the of\u0002 ciants at the mysteries, ordered and human, on the left, and the wild space of myth on the right. The pillar or “terma” on which the Silenus is leaning with his lyre would de\u0002 ne this limit, as Erika Simon has suggested.29 We already \u0002 nd ourselves in this second atmosphere, the mythical one. Old Silenus is an of\u0002 ciant of Apollo (he plucks the lyre and wears the crown of laurel around his head), while the couple of young paniskoi—a male and a female—belong to the wild, mountain realm of Pan. While the Silenus leans against the pillar carved by the hand of man and is dressed in the mantle of men, the two young paniskoi, with pointy, goat-like ears, are sitting on a rock. Over their tunics, the male wears the lank black fur skin and a long hairy wolf tail; the female the roe-deer skin of the maenads, or nebris, whose animal head we see vaguely over her bare right breast.27 On the adoption of Dionysiac signs in Etruscan funerary iconography, especially on the part of women, cf., most recently, Steuernagel (1998) 145.28 Sauron (1998) 135–136, pl. on p. 26; cf. also Maiuri (19674), Simon (1998).29 Simon (1998) 96 ff., particularly 105–106 and \u0002 g. 8.4.BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 30411/8/2007 1:00:39 PM"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" iconographical notes on the orphic tablets 305Fig. 13BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 30511/8/2007 1:00:39 PM"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"306 appendix iiThe bucolic atmosphere is appropriate for this little scene or idyll of Hellenistic \u0003 avor. The young male, whose shepherd’s staff is hinted lying down, holds in his hands the instrument of his lord and master, the seven-reed \u0003 ute. He has interrupted his melody to look sideways at his companion, who offers her adolescent breast to a kid which extends its muzzle to reach it, as if it were its mother’s udder. The young panisca’s glance guides us towards the nursing scene. In front of them, another kid, the animal of Dionysus, has paused in its walk and turns its face to the front: with attentive ears, it perceives the singular quietness that envelops the moment.The scene is interpreted as a mystic nursing, characteristic of the mysteries of Dionysus. Nature has become magically peaceful, and the kid fearlessly approaches shepherds who—in the case of the male—are dressed in the fearsome wolf-pelt. The power of Bacchus Lysios, the Liberator, does not intervene only in this communion with the animal world. From the breast of the childlike, adolescent shepherd, gushes milk, more \u0002 tting to a mother. In Euripides’ Bacchants (vv. 699–702),30 the maenads carry wild fawns or wolf cubs and nurse them with their snow-white milk. In the Villa of the Mysteries, the young panisca has been transformed into a maenad who suckles the young god, trans-forming herself into the nursemaid of Dionysus. The god’s resurrection announces the concordance of contraries in nature, the coincidence of opposites, or sympatheia. It is an instant in which all is silent.The image has been placed in relation to the enigmatic formula of the Orphic tablets: “a kid, you fell into the milk”. However, as we have already seen in the Etruscan sarcophagus (n. 9), this scene remains a mere approximation, not succeeding in explaining the precise meaning of the Orphic text.N. 11. Suckling beneath the divine mantleProminent among the terracotta statuettes offered as ex-votos in sanc-tuaries or found in graves are the types of the kourotrophos or nourishing divinity, sometimes standing but usually seated, who holds and suckles a child, whom she may also cover beneath her own mantle. This ico-nography is widespread in the Western Mediterranean from the 4th 30 Cf.

B.C. on, and is particularly frequent in Italy, as in the example we have shown from the sanctuary of Juno at Gabii (\u0002 g. 14),31 although there are also examples from the Iberian world.32 However, Egyptian and Near Eastern sources exist from much earlier with this motif of the divine nursemaid, as is the case of Nephthys and Isis suckling the divine child Horus or the pharaoh in the afterlife. In the Italian examples, it is sometimes not a child but an adult who nurses or sleeps in the female’s lap. On other occasions, the child is represented as inert and lifeless beneath the goddess’ nourishing breast. Britt Marie Friedh-Haneson has suggested the following interpretation for some of these examples: the suckling personage—whether adult or child—would represent the deceased as adopted by the goddess of the afterlife, who offers him the milk of immortality.33 In sanctuaries and tombs, the offerings of these terracottas suggest the initiate’s adoption of a new life through divine maternity: he is reborn, and through this rite of transition he changes his condition and status.Friedh-Haneson associates these images with Orphic religion, which could have incorporated various in\u0003 uences from the Mediterranean, including those from Egypt. She takes up the enigmatic expression of the tablets from Thurii “like a kid I fell into the milk” (cf. L 8, 4; L 9, 8), which she associates with the suckling of Dionysus—and of the initiate as Dionysus—by the goddess Persephone. Likewise, she alludes to tablet L 9 from Thurii, in which we \u0002 nd the expression \u0012\u0013\u0014 \u0005\u0015\u0016\u0013\u0011 \u0017\u0018\u0007, “I plunged beneath the lap of my lady, the subterranean queen”, which we can relate to those images in which the goddess’ mantle receives the initiate.We also reproduce here the drawing of an Etruscan mirror from Perugia, currently in the National Library at Paris, studied by Friedh-Haneson (\u0002 g. 15).34 Some authors interpret the scene engraved on thismirror as the adoption of Heracles by Hera, as the adult hero’s entry into his new, divine condition. The mythic episode takes place on a decorated bed, beneath the protective mantle of Hera and the offering of her bare breast. The image represents the hero’s symbolic second birth. The \u0002 gure standing next to the bed, who observes the reclining couple attentively, could be Athena, the Etruscan MENRVA or Minerva. 31 Aubet (1980) 77–78, pl.

The deceased drinking water under a palm tree or a sycamore tree in Egyptian eschatologyMany Egyptian images, in relief or wall paintings, in papyri of the Book of the Dead,35 in sarcophagi, or in ushebtis boxes, show a repre-sentation of goddesses in the form of a tree that suckles the deceased or gives him a pause along the road to the afterlife (\u0002 gs. 16 and 17).36 The trees most often represented are, in the \u0002 rst place, the sycamore, whose thick, whitish sap resembles milk and, secondly, the palm tree, with its sweet fruit the date. Both species, but especially the sycamore, give good shade and shelter for those walking in the desert. Water is found near to it. In a consolatory way, the image of life is transferred to the landscape of death.In the representations of these metamorphic trees, we see hands, breasts, and feminine arms sprouting, as if the plant were endowed with a force or power similar to that of humans. We are in the presence of a goddess who manifests herself as a sycamore, assuming its qualities and power. The texts that accompany these images often allow us to identify the goddess transformed into a tree (cf. § 1.5.). They are usu-ally Nut, the goddess of the sky, or Isis, or Hathor. Yet the tree is also represented by itself, without human mutations. It is easy to suppose that we have in them a divine gift to men. Thus, the sycamore would 35 Cf.

From the protective tree of the goddess—or from the god-dess herself—he receives shelter, food, and refreshing water. This, in synthesis, is the interpretation that Egyptologists, basing themselves on images and texts, have agreed to give to these images.Let us look at two examples. The \u0002 rst is a well-known design painted on the tomb of Tutmose III (1479–1425 a. C.) (\u0002 g. 17). The goddess Isis lets the deceased suckle the milk of the sycamore, beneath which she manifests herself. This representation of the divine tree is very ancient, and may be the origin and inspiration of the innumerable later representations.The second large-scale image comes from the tomb of Irunefer, of the Ramesid period, in the 19th Dynasty (\u0002 g. 18); however, we also \u0002 nd it in the vignettes of papyri in chapter 59 of the Book of the Dead. The deceased bends down to drink the water from a pool under a palm tree laden with dates that rises beside him. Vertical zigzag lines represent the icon of the water. Chapter 59 of the Book of the Dead is entitled “on the air that must be breathed and the access to water in the realm of the afterlife”. The text goes on:Hail, sycamore tree of the goddess Nut ! Offer me the gift of water and of air that are within you.In a vignette from the Ani papyrus, the goddess Nut appears inside the sycamore, pouring water from a long vase into the hands of Ani, who has knelt beside a pool.This motif, with its successive variants, persists until the Roman epoch. On a situla,37 the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, each of them behind a tree, the personi\u0002 cation of a garden, offer fresh water to the dead Osiris.Since the beginning of the 20th century, historians of religion have compared the refrigerium in the Beyond of some Orphic tablets with this eschatological development of ancient Egypt. The suckling by which the deceased is initiated into the Orphic-Dionysiac rituals may also have vague parallels in the funerary images of Egypt. Yet although the comparison is relevant and expands our horizons—either because simi-larities come from remote common mythemes, or because they can be 37 Keel (1992) \u0002 g. 51c.BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 31311/8/2007 1:00:43 PM"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"314 appendix iiFig. 18 (From Keel [1992] \u0002 g. 112)BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 31411/8/2007 1:00:43 PM"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" iconographical notes on the orphic tablets 315explained as a human universal—it is no less true that the motifs of the Orphic refrigerium and suckling must be understood within themselves, as signs of their own system.N. 13 Orphic allusions in the hypogeum of the Viale Manzoni?The hypogeum of the Aurelii in the Viale Manzoni at Rome, discovered in 1919, is dated to slightly before the midpoint of the 3rd cent. A.D., between 210 and 240 A.D.38 The paintings that decorate its interior are probably inspired by a pagan-Christian syncretism that juxtaposes motifs from various beliefs: a bearded personage—Christ?—reading a uolumen, sitting on a mountain at whose feet are various goats, an allegory of the Sermon on the Mount;39 a personage haranguing the crowd in the market square, supposedly an image of the Celestial Jerusalem; another personage on horseback on a victorious aduentus, etc. Next to these scenes, for which no proper parallels are known in the Paleochristian world, we \u0002 nd other images of obscure pagan content.40We shall focus on the fresco, beneath a decorated dome, that covers the east wall in the so-called room C, the subject of various and con-tradictory interpretations (\u0002 g. 19). The painting is arranged in two great friezes. Inside, with a great vertical loom that divides the scenes into two parts, one may read an allegorical motif inspired by the Odyssey. Sug-gestions have varied: it may be the loom of Penelope, identi\u0002 ed in the standing feminine \u0002 gure, who would be engaged in conversation with Odysseus, with his hair unkempt and sitting, in an expressive attitude, on the right.41 The three naked men holding hands and in an almost frontal position could be the converted suitors. More convincing argu-ments42 have been used to adduce the Odyssean episode of Circe, the famous weaver whose bucolic landscape would be completed by the 38 Editio princeps, Bendinelli (1922–1923), fig. 30 and pl.

Below, the seated personage and the three naked males would be none other than Odysseus and his companions after the episode of their freeing from enchantment.To the allegorical obscurity acquired by these uncertain Odyssean interpretations in a possibly Gnostico-Christian environment—all suggestions fail if we wish to integrate the details into a coherent whole—is added the material obscurity of the image, in equivocal, evanescent traits. Today, our research is based primarily on the excel-lent watercolors made by the artist O. Ferreti, in 1920, or on those, slightly later, made by C. Tabanelli upon request from G. Wilpert in 1924. Since then, the paintings have seriously deteriorated, the reason why it is practically impossible to carry out a new and more precise examination of them.A recent reading43 associates the representation in the upper frieze with a wall inscription, beneath the painting, which mentions a certain Remius Celerinus and A . . . Epaphroditus. According to Chicoteau, the painted scene represents two fountains, with the motif of the refrigerium to which the inscription probably refers.Let us try to situate ourselves in the dif\u0002 cult upper image. A scene of idyllic-pastoral content is portrayed with a hortus suburbanus before a city, sketched in the background, in accordance with the landscape tradition of Roman painting: over a great arched vaulted gate, houses can be discerned. In the foreground stretches a great meadow, populated by various and heterogeneous animals in various attitudes—cows and oxen, goats (one of them gamboling), a seated dromedary, a braying ass, two horses . . . one’s attention is seized by the diversity of species, one of them as exotic and enigmatic as a dromedary. On either side, we see two rustic buildings, with a covered porch, a door, an upper window and a roof with two sloping roofs. The construction of a fountain stands before the left-hand building. From a vertical wall, a great stream of water \u0003 ows into a kind of pool in front of which a woman slightly leans, standing next to the door. It is less obvious that the similar building on the right is a second fountain, as Chicoteau proposes. Two large trees, the one on the left with a twisted trunk, cover the background.Chicoteau directs our attention to two signs: the woman in white, standing in front of the left-hand fountain; and a great white tree, on 43 Chicoteau (1997).BERNABE_F16_273-326.indd 31711/8/2007 1:00:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"318 appendix iithe right of this fountain. The same author stresses the funeral symbol-ism of white, and relates these \u0002 gures to the refrigerium or anapsyxis of the Orphic tablets (cf. § 1.5.). The scene would take place in the sacred meadows and groves of Persephone (L 8, from Thurii). Because of its greater spatial and chronological proximity to the hypogeum, Chicoteau reminds us of the late tablet of Caecilia Secundina at Rome, now in the British Museum (cf. § 5, L 11). It mentions the famous gift to men of Mnemosyne, the Muse of memory. Could this white woman, the nymph of the waters who is standing, vigilant, next to her nymphaeum (the fountain of forgetfulness or of memory?), from which the souls drink, also be Mnemosyne? The hypothetical duality of fountains to which Chicoteau alludes should correspond to the afterlife landscape of which the Orphic tablets, like the one from Petelia (cf. § 1), inform us, yet, I repeat, we cannot be sure that this second fountain really exists. Finally, the animals, who to a great extent stand out by their dark color, are the souls (Gnostic psychikoi or sarkikoi, as Chicoteau af\u0002 rms) who wander through the infernal meadows of Persephone.The second element is the supposed white tree to which Chicoteau alludes: a cypress—as this author af\u0002 rms—“which shines even today” next to the fountain of life. The white tree, in contrast with the dark animals, would be an illuminating sign, an indication of the path to the afterlife, although here we can only manage to see a tree in an idyllic Roman landscape (cf. §1.4.). Let us add that in a syncretistic pagan-Christian interpretation, the central gate in the arch of the wall, in the background, could be the entry towards Hades or the Celestial Jerusalem, being therefore related, in a complex iconographical pro-gram, to the decoration alluded to on other walls.A coherent reading of the details and of the whole and of the interrelation of both scenes, still remains to be offered. The three male \u0002 gures holding hands could be three initiates who are advanc-ing naked towards their new life. The mythical weaver, whether she is Penelope or Circe, may be allegorically weaving the destiny of those who are buried there, an ancient pagan metaphor.44 Let us recall the 44 On the theme of the peplos in the Orphic poems, cf. Porph., Antr., 56, 10 (cf. OF 286) and OF 286 III (to weave the mantle of the world). On allegorico-religious interpretations of weaving in the Odyssey: Moret (1991) especially 238–240.

We might also recall how Persephone, now queen of the infernal realm, was weaving a mantle that ordered heavenly things when she was abducted by Pluto (Proclus, in Tim. III 223). It is not hard to associate the activity of weaving with the eschatologies and initiations of the afterlife. Finally, if we are truly in the presence of an Odyssean theme, it is \u0002 tting to evoke the frequent association in the \u0002 rst centuries of Christianity of Odysseus, the exemplum virtutis, with the \u0002 gure of Christ.45 Let us not forget, however, that we are dealing with a chain of conjectures based on a unique monument, extremely complex and very precariously conserved. A coherent reading of the ensemble, which is undoubtedly of philosophical-religious content, is still lacking. At present, the ques-tions are more open than the answers.See, in addition, the commentary on n. 14. On the survival of Orphic beliefs in the Roman Imperial period, cf. the tablet of Caecilia Secundina, from Roma (L 11, § 5).N. 14. The REFRIGERIUM of first ChristiansThe fresco painted above an arcosolium in the Roman catacomb of Callixtus, in whose central part a loculus or funerary niche was later carved out, represents the Good Shepherd (\u0002 g. 20).46 Christ is an elegant adolescent in a short tunic and a mantle, holding a sheep over his shoulders. The scene takes place in the bucolic landscape of tree-\u0002 lled meadows in which the \u0003 ock gambols, with many fountains of fresh water that \u0003 ow from a rock. The apostles Peter and Paul are drawing handfuls of water from them.The scene from this tomb, from the 3rd cent. A.D., has a funer-ary meaning not very distant from the pagan motif of the refrigerium ‘refreshment’ of the souls in their path to the Beyond, to which the Orphic tablets also refer, and on which it is also possible to trace a long 45 On the Christian allegories of Odysseus, see, in addition to Cechelli (1944) 53 ff., Pépin (1982).

In Christianity, the pagan motif is endowed with renewed Christian meaning through the Biblical tradition: the water of life or the living water (\u0019\u0018\u001a\r \u001b\u001c) can take on an eschatological dimension. The Gospel of John (4, 13–14) places the following phrase in Jesus’ mouth:whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.And a passage from the Apocalypse (7, 16–17) reads as follows:Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb (. . .) will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water (\u001d\u0013\u001e \u001b\u001a\u001f \u0013\u000b!\" \u0012\u0018#\u0010\u001a).Images of the Samaritan in the well of Jacob or the marvelous well of Moses in the desert abound in the catacombs of Rome.47 Here, they are an expression of the refrigerium, a metaphor for the “fountain of eternal life”.Franz Cumont48 had already sketched the long history of this extended topos, that was to relate the Orphic tablets with Christianity and the Egyptian religion (see the commentaries to our n. 12). The description is vivid, since it is based on experience:Beneath the blazing Egyptian sky, beside the arid sands in which the traveler succumbs, devoured by thirst, what one desires for the dead man in his posthumous peregrinations is that he may \u0002 nd a limpid fountain to quench the ardor that devours him (. . .). This water was soon transformed into the image of the fountain of life which pours forth immortality upon the thirsty souls. The metaphor was so widely accepted that the Latin refrigerium ended up as a synonym of well-being and beatitude. In this sense, the expression continued to be used in the liturgy of the church . . .The great Belgian scholar of ancient religions (1868–1947) placed the tablet from Petelia in relation both with Egyptian ideas and with their survival in Christianity. In these examples, comparativism in the history of religions showed a more fruitful and enriching aspect.47 On Paleochristian images of the Fountain of Moses and the Samaritan at the well of Jacob, cf. Wilpert (1903) pls. 36, 46, 49–50, 55, 57, 60, 98, etc. Likewise, vol. I, p. 266 “Moses in the desert”; pp. 423–426: “Das Refrigerium”.48 Cumont (19092) 152. On Christian refrigerium, cf.

Allusion has been made to the parable of the rich Epulus and poor Lazarus (Ev. Luc. 16, 24). Now in the afterlife, the perverse rich man begs Abraham to allow Lazarus to moisten his \u0002 nger in water and refresh his tongue: a \u0003 eeting refreshment, perhaps heard as a kind of prelude to paradise.Whether or not these relations are true—we are surely in the presence of manifestations characteristic of each culture, which are interwoven and related alongside a vague common background, or even a general, if not universal mytheme—it is clear that Christianity adopts quite concrete motifs from pagan iconography, clothing them as Christian allegories. The same motif of the refrigerium \u0002 nds another Hellenic formulation in the image of doves drinking from a vase. It reinterprets the emblema from the pavements of Hellenistic and Roman houses with doves perching on the edge of a basin, as described by Pliny (Natural history, 36, 184) (\u0002 g. 21). The brilliant artist Sosus of Pergamum had created it towards the second half of the 2nd cent. B.C.49 In turn, Sosus may have had in mind the famous cup of Nestor described in the Iliad (11, 632–637). In early Christianity, the doves next to the vase are the souls, who drink the water of salvation of Christ.The water that mitigates the heat of this world is translated to the imaginary of the Beyond. Throughout the Near East, in Asia Minor and Egypt, in Ugarit, Phoenicia and Carthage, many excavations have brought to light installations that guided water to the tombs. Drinking glasses are not lacking among funerary furniture. Let us recall once again that the initiate from Pharsalus deposited his ashes in a hydria (cf. n. 8).49 On the mosaic with doves by Sosus of Pergamum, cf. Havelock (19812) 258, pl.

Images and contexts of some Orphic tablets: Pelinna, Petelia, Hipponion, RomeIn this image, we reproduce the Orphic tablets from Pelinna and Petelia. Both examples from Pelinna (Thessaly)50 have the shape of an ivy leaf (\u0002 g. 22). The link is clearly the symbolism of ivy, a leaf that is always verdant and fecund, with Dionysus: hedera est gratissima Baccho (Ovid. Fast. 3, 767, cf. § 2). In particular, one of the leaves contains an extremely closely-written text in which the corners of the heart-shaped outlines are used to maximum advantage. They speak of Bacchic liberation, and of the initiate’s new birth. We recall that the terracotta of a mae-nad, whose image completed the mystical meaning of the Dionysiac initiation of the woman buried there, was also associated with this burial. The image (ivy), as well as the context support the meaning of the writing. Cf., in a similar sense, our n. 7, in the terracotta of the dancing maenad from Locri.Let us consider the example from Petelia, which creates enormous dif\u0002 culties from an archaeological viewpoint (\u0002 g. 23). Whereas other tablets were deposited in the hand or on the head of the deceased, this example, carefully folded, appeared in a sheath, a small pentagonal cylinder closed at one end. The sheath hung, by two tiny rings, from a \u0002 ligree chain, with its links plaited into units forming \u0002 gures of eight. It was entirely in gold. We must, then, suppose that it hung around the neck, which is exceptional in our case.The set was found in 1836 “in the environs of Petelia” in Calabria, between Thurii and Crotona, and it is the \u0002 rst known example of our Orphic series. It has been in the British Museum since 1843. The facts concerning its provenance are extremely scarce. It might belong to an Italian tomb, that is, not a Greek one. Yet the major problem arose when it was determined that both the sheath and the chain date from well into the imperial Roman period.51 Two possibilities may be considered: either the totality of the \u0002 nd is a modern manipulation, combining diverse ancient elements, which seems unlikely; or else the tablet, already in Antiquity, was extracted from a tomb and reused, at least \u0002 ve centuries later, as a magical amulet, carefully folded and kept in its new amulet-holding sheath. This is the option we prefer. In the Roman period, the placement of late tablets and Gnostic texts in cylin-50 Cf. Bottini (1992) 129 ff.51 Cf.

It has even been suspected52 that the lower lines of the tablet from Petelia were cut off at this second stage, so that it could \u0002 t in the sheath. However its careful folding could already have been carried out in the 4th cent. B.C., since other tablets, like the one from Hipponion,53 are folded four times, perhaps as a ritual act that hid the sacred words from profane eyes.Reusing of Petelia tablet is linked by Bottini54 with the survival (or rebirth) of Orphic tradition in Roman times. He reminds also the gold tablet of Caecilia Secundina found in Rome next to San Paolo fuori le mura (L 11).55 In addition, the possible Orphico-Christian interpretation of the hypogeum of the Viale Manzoni (between 210 and 240 A.D.) must be brought up (cf. n. 14).52 Zuntz (1971) 356.53 Cf.
