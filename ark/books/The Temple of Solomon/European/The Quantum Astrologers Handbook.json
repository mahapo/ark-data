In England, Guy Fawkes is a newborn baby in his mother’sarms and Queen Elizabeth I is feeling the sting of her excommunication from theCatholic Church. In Italy, the once-great Jerome Cardano, now sixty-nine yearsold and feeling it, is also about to fall foul of the religious establishment.He is in Bologna for a meeting of the city’s syndics, the governing officialswho pronounce on civil law. Jerome hopes to persuade them of his innocence —that he has not, as the Milanese College of Physicians has suggested, committedsodomy and incest. Forbidden to enter Milan to plead his case, his only hope isthe Bolognese syndics. But his hope is misplaced and he seems to have no conceptof just how impossible his position has become. In the public’s eyes, he is nowa madman. In Milan, he was spotted begging for alms at the gates of the Collegeof Physicians — where he once held the office of rector. There are moments whenJerome is overcome by his new misfortune, by his hunger, and by the ignominy ofhis position, and is found loudly cursing in the streets. It doesn’t help thathe has taken to wearing a gift given to him many years earlier by the Archbishopof Scotland: a belted plaid that he wraps around his waist and secures with aleather belt, throwing the rest of the heavy mottled cloth over his shoulder. Noone in Italy has ever seen — let alone worn — anything quite like it. Who canblame the locals for laughing?How the mighty fall. Just two decades earlier, this man was summoned all the wayto Edinburgh to treat the Archbishop’s asthma. On his long journey to Scotland,the physicians to the French king had organised for Jerome to speak at a seriesof conferences in Paris. Then, while in Edinburgh, the courtiers of the youngKing Edward VI of England had begged him to come to London and provide a medicalconsultation for the ailing royal youth. Not satisfied merely to tap Jerome’smedical skill, they prevailed upon him to construct the royal astrologicalchart. He left Edinburgh a rich and celebrated man; he left London even richer.On his journey home, he travelled via all the major cities of Europe,entertained by noblemen and the ambassadors of the Holy Roman Emperor.Now he has no money to pay for lodgings and spends his nights in an abandonedhovel where the wind whistles through the gaps in the walls. What is left of theroof creaks ominously above his head. Every evening, before he goes to sleep,the celebrated physician, the royal astrologer, the inventor of numerousmachines and mathematical abstractions — among them probability theory — eyesthe rotten beams. He attempts a calculation of the likelihood of the building’scollapse. There is a part of him that would welcome such a swift end.But morning comes and the building still stands. His stomach empty and groaning,Jerome emerges warily into the light and looks down the street. He has woken ina good mood. There is a lightness in his stride as he sidesteps a mangy,sleeping dog — he has developed a phobia of dogs that he will attempt to explainin the pages of his autobiography — and turns towards the city centre. Today, hewill see the Bolognese syndics and they will listen to him. These are not likethe petty, sour-faced goats that rule over Milan. From tomorrow, he will bepermitted to earn his living again. And then, across the road, he sees someonestaring at him. At first, the disfigured, bearded features of Nicolo Tartagliaare not clear. But then the man known as The Stammerer steps forward, and withhim steps a cohort of the city guard, their armour gleaming in the early morningsun.‘There he is,’ Tartaglia says. His words are barely discernible, so profound arethe childhood injuries to his face. But the gleam in his eye is unmistakable.‘Arrest him.’As the guard moves to cross the street, another figure is revealed. Watchingwith a cold, intense gaze is Aldo, Jerome’s youngest son. Slowly, the young manturns and walks away. But not before the father sees a sly smile, a grin thatcelebrates a long-sought revenge, bloom on the face of his only surviving child.ψHave you ever wanted to understand the universe? Once that desire burns away atyour soul — really burns — there’s no going back. That’s why some peoplededicate their lives to physics. Or to philosophy. Or to Buddhism. Or tomathematics. They are all searching for answers. I am not saying that they areall ultimately following the same path — I know which I think is the best bet —but none is able to satisfy everybody.I chose physics as my path to enlightenment. Some prefer the teachings of Jesus.Others go for Krishna or Kabbalah. My friend Jerome Cardano — indulge me, for wehave spent a lot of time together — opted for astrology. He didn’t ever reallytrust it, though. Jerome used to worry at astrology, to work it hard, to askdifficult questions of it. I’m not convinced everyone does the same, even withphysics — a predicament that provides much of the reason for this book.I am a physicist. My expertise, such as it is, is in quantum mechanics, thetheory that describes how the world works on microscopic scales. My interest inJerome arises from the fact that he used his sharp mind to unearth themathematical pillars on which quantum theory, our most successful scientificguide to the universe, is founded. Astrology and quantum physics rattling aroundin one Renaissance skull — who’d have thought?Jerome would be happy that I am introducing him to you: his work, his mind, andhis life. He always wanted to be famous; by the age of twelve, he had decided todedicate himself to creating something that would bring him lasting renown. Thatyou know next to nothing about him points to one of his many dashed hopes.He hoped also to make his fortune at the gambling table. Despite inventingprobability theory for just that purpose, he gambled away his marital bed andall his wife’s jewellery. Then there was his hope that his wife, Lucia, wouldlive a long and happy life. For all the good doctor’s successes in treatingothers, he could do nothing to halt her death after just fourteen years ofmarriage. He hoped that his elder son would be a successful physician.Unfortunately, Giovanni’s marriage into a family of gangsters made thatparticular aspiration particularly optimistic, and the young man’s execution formurder, a plot twist that broke Jerome’s heart, put an end to that hope. Jeromealso hoped for grandchildren, but ended up raising only the grandchild of a manwho tried to ruin him.The one thing for which he held no hope was probably his most important andlasting creation. It is the square root of a negative number, something we nowcall the imaginary number. Though it initially seemed like nothing more than astrange mathematical abstraction, it has turned out to be essential tounderstanding how the universe holds together.It was a privilege to be the one to tell him.You’re probably thinking that I have lost my mind. You might be right. Myobsession with Jerome has, in the last few years, taken me over. I have a mindthat has been schooled in quantum physics and trained to think rationally,dissecting facts and ideas dispassionately. And here I am, not only celebratinga Renaissance astrologer, but talking as if we are contemporaries.To me, though, it makes sense. I talk to Jerome. He talks to me. Theseconversations take place in my head, true, but they are informed by hiswritings, and by things written about him. We are intellectual contemporaries.We are both rational, both seeking to understand the universe, both convincedthat nobody has a good grasp of it yet. We both believe that space and time —time, in particular — are not what you and I have been raised to believe theyare. So, yes, this book is not quite what you have come to expect from a sciencewriter with my training and history. But I can’t help that. In my head I havevisited Jerome in his prison cell. And maybe it is not just in my head. Withinthe books that Jerome wrote after his release I see unmistakable traces of myvisits.Perhaps you should walk away before I drag you into this madness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1Jerome has been in this cell for eleven weeks since his arrest. The weather hasturned cold and damp, and he struggles to keep himself warm. Until yesterday, hehad no idea why he was in prison; no one would tell him anything. The hunchedman who brings fresh straw every day refuses even to look at him. The tall, thinboy who brings the food smiles as he sets the bowl down on the writing desk, buthas nothing to offer but a shrug in response to Jerome’s questions. Yesterday,though, a new face entered the cell. When the guard turned the key and opened upthe door, the stranger took one step in, threw down the yellow robe, smirked,turned, and walked away. And then Jerome knew.He puts down his pen and turns his attention to the robe that now smothers hisemaciated frame, pulling at it as if it burns his skin. It is embroidered withdemons who are using forks and fiery flames to torture hapless, grimacing men.Jerome knows its significance: it is what the heretics wear when led to thestake.We are in December now. Christmas is coming and the last light of the day isfading ever earlier. The cell is small and dark, with a window big enough onlyfor a small boy to climb through. It has been many decades since Jerome was asmall boy. He is sat behind a rickety desk — a small mercy afforded to him bythe authorities. Perhaps they hope he will write more blasphemies and make theircase easier to prosecute.Jerome looks up from the robe and stares at me through the gloom. He is not sureif I am an apparition. I am not sure, either. Eventually, without shifting hisgaze from my eyes, he puts his fingers to his mouth and pulls out a smallemerald. It is held on a chain around his neck. He lets the stone fall to hischest.‘Do I know you?’ he says. His voice is thin and high pitched — reedy — entirelyunbecoming to a man in his seventh decade.‘I don’t think so,’ I say.‘Did they send you to spy on me?’‘They?’‘My Inquisitors.’ He pulls at the yellow robe again.‘No.’ I break from his gaze and survey the cell again. ‘I’m just here. As far asI can tell.’ It is all I have to offer.It seems to satisfy. ‘Oh,’ he says. He picks up the pen again. ‘Well, welcome,then.’‘Are you writing to Archbishop Hamilton?’ I say.He stares at me. ‘Why would I do that?’‘To ask for his help.’Jerome shakes his head. ‘He will be dead by now,’ he says. ‘I’m sure of it.’I have read the history books and I know the truth. ‘He’s not. Your treatmentwas more successful than even you might have hoped.’ I hesitate, unsure whetherthis constitutes some breach of the rules of engagement. I decide I don’t care.Nobody has told me the rules. ‘You should write to him,’ I say.And that is how, I like to think, I came to save the life of Jerome Cardano.ψIt is going to be difficult to convince anyone that I saved Jerome. Jerome wasborn in 1501 and I in 1970. Bound as we all seem to be by time’s arrow, I cansee that there are problems with the concept. I may already be coming across asan unreliable narrator. But, before you judge, first learn something about whereI’m coming from and — more importantly — familiarise yourself at least a littlewith the ideas of quantum theory.According to our best description of the atomic and subatomic world, atoms andtheir constituent particles are able to exist simultaneously in two places atonce. It’s there in the theory and we’ve seen it in experiments. They can evenexist at two different moments simultaneously. So, even as they gather to formmy body, their notion of time and space is utterly different to the one Iexperience. And so, I ask, why shouldn’t I be in two places and epochs at once?I’m playing with you, of course. I am an unreliable narrator. That’s the wholepremise here. But aren’t we all? After all, I’ve already mentioned my‘experience’ of time as if I know what that means. All I can tell you about thatparticular phenomenon is that my experience involves my consciousness —something that scientists can’t even define, let alone explain. If quantumphysics is slippery, it’s nothing compared to the minimal friction you’llencounter when you try to pin down a neuroscientist on consciousness.One of the problems is that consciousness is entirely subjective. I believe I amconscious; I have no way of telling whether you are. You, to me, are thereforean unreliable narrator. A narrator is only reliable when we can corroboratetheir version of events. We take the view that if several people agree on anarrative arc, it is probably a trustworthy description of how things happened.But how can I trust anyone else if I don’t know what’s going on — if anything —in their head? What’s more, it doesn’t mean that other things — things no onementioned — didn’t happen. Even the agreed narrative may not tell the wholetruth.I certainly cannot corroborate Jerome’s version of events. I can only go by whathe says — and what he says is sometimes odd. I first came across him some yearsago now, when researching a book about how science works. I was writing achapter about the origins of scientific creativity and was seeking out examplesof strange sources of inspiration: hallucinogenic and dream states, daydreams orpoetry-inspired visions, and so on. Most scientists chose to hide thesequestionable sources. But not Jerome.He invented the mechanical gimbal that was to make the printing press possible.His idea led to the ‘Cardan joint’ that takes the rotary power in the driveshaftof your car’s engine and allows it to be transmitted to the front and rearaxles. We have already mentioned the mind-bending imaginary numbers that aremultiples of the square root of -1 and the original mathematics of probability.He pioneered the experimental method of research in areas as diverse as medicalcures for deafness and hernia, cryptography, and speaking with the dead (forgivehim, these are not strictly scientific times). Jerome’s autobiography detailssome of these achievements, yet when he documents their source he says they camefrom ‘the ministrations of my attendant spirit’.Here we would say he is indulging in unreliable narration. We tend not tobelieve in visiting spirits, especially those that impart scientific insights.So this is surely a lie, or the raving of a disturbed mind? Jerome’s father alsohad a spirit visitor, as it happens. As a trained scientist, I should probablyput all this down to a genetic predisposition to psychosis or schizophrenicdelusions. Yet despite, or perhaps because of, this I became quietly fascinated.I read everything on Jerome that I could find. The vast majority of his fourmillion words of writings (four million!) are only available in Latin (not mystrong suit), but there are a few biographies in English. A couple were writtenin the nineteenth century. A Norwegian mathematician called Øystein Orepublished another in 1953, focused on Jerome’s probability work. There’s a moregeneral biography from 1969, written by a jobbing journalist called Alan Wykes.More recently, some academic scholars have dissected Jerome’s astrologicalstudies and his medical work. All this seeped into me, permeating my thinkingand my imagination, and mixing itself with my experience and my knowledge. Thenit set hard in my brain as thoughts and imaginings about the possible, theprobable, and the unlikely. It became a new narrative for me, as compelling asquantum theory and just as unreliable. Jerome and I are now inextricablyentangled across space and time, just like the photons that spooked Einstein sobadly.Photons, I should explain, are the fundamental particles of light and otherradiation. They travel at — unsurprisingly — the speed of light, which is themaximum speed of anything in the universe. In his special theory of relativity,Einstein showed that travelling at the speed of light is equivalent to haltingtime. That means photons do not experience time, as such. However, that didn’tstop him balking at entanglement, arguably still quantum theory’s most shockingrevelation.This is the discovery that you can cause two photons (or any other quantumparticles) to interact so that their properties become shared between them. Youcan then separate the pair by half a universe, do something to one andimmediately see the effects of your action in the properties of the other.Einstein dismissed entanglement as proof that quantum theory must be somehowincomplete, deriding it as ‘spooky action at a distance’. We know now thatentanglement works across time as well as space. We’ll get into this later. AllI’m saying is, given that Jerome is spooking me now, perhaps I spooked him then.For the moment, let’s go back and visit the beginning.ψIt is astonishing — a testimony to his tenacity — that Jerome is born at all.This is the beginning of the sixteenth century and Italy is in its Renaissanceperiod. As far as most of its inhabitants are concerned, this is not theRenaissance Italy you are thinking of, with its glorious legacy of art andculture. True, Leonardo’s creativity is in full flow, and in a few monthsMichelangelo will return to Florence and begin work on his statue of David. Butthis Italy is a patchwork of regional states, broken by centuries of pettyinternal conflict and civil war, and rotten with plague, poverty, andsuperstition. Its rulers are in thrall to a succession of bloated,self-aggrandising popes. Living through the harsh reality of everyday life inItaly’s Renaissance is not glamorous, and that is why, when Chiara Micheria, afat little widow with a short temper, realises she is pregnant again, she seeksout an apothecary.Having gained herself a consultation, she asks the apothecary how best to inducean abortion. The church’s newly published witch-hunting manual, MalleusMaleficarum, has pronounced abortions the work of the devil, and midwivesinducing them are to be treated as witches. But, however dangerous the movemight be, Chiara feels herself in no position to deal with yet another bastardchild. After all, she already has three brats of dubious parentage.Truth be told, Chiara is a woman of somewhat loose morals and everyone aroundknows her brood may not have been her husband’s progeny. Not that he is aroundto protest. A few years ago he was murdered in a bar brawl, the result of beingcaught cheating at the card table. To Chiara’s credit, the father of this latestbaby is known, at least — and almost respectable, too. Fazio Cardano is amathematician and jurisconsult. He is not much to look at, though: fifty-sixyears old and toothless, with shoulders that are stooped and rounded from hourshunched over Euclid’s books on geometry. And even if love were blind, marriageis not an enticing prospect for these two. The couple argue constantly andneither wants to bind themselves to the other just because of a child. What’smore, Milan is beset by new cases of the plague. Chiara is a practical woman,which is why she has left Fazio to take his chances, gathered up her children,and headed twenty miles south to plague-free Pavia.It is here that the apothecary recommends she drink a poison to bring on amiscarriage. She follows his advice to the letter, but it doesn’t work. Neitherdo the next two doses. Despite all her efforts and expenditure, on 24 September1501, after a three day labour, a nursemaid violently pulls a child with a headof curly black hair from between Chiara’s thighs. At first, it seems thereluctant mother is in luck: the child appears to be stillborn. However, thenurse puts him in a bath of warm wine and Jerome Cardano kicks into life.This is not the last time that Jerome stares death in the face. Less than twoyears later, while he is still being suckled by a wet nurse, an outbreak ofplague kills his half-brothers and half-sister. The nurse, too, catches theplague and dies. Her infected milk brings him out in five carbuncles, includingone on the end of his nose, which scar and mark him for the rest of his life.But he survives, growing into a sickly boy who is prone to long bouts of illnessand is often confined to his room in the family home in Milan’s Via del Rovelli.The illnesses are frequently severe, but they never defeat him. Perhaps he ismade hardier by the rough treatment he receives at the hands of his parents,both of whom beat and whip him. From the age of five, Jerome accompanies hisfather on visits to clients, acting as his book-carrying page. Occasionally,when Fazio needs to consult a volume en route, he orders Jerome to stand stilland places the book on his crown. If Jerome moves, disturbing his father’sconcentration, he receives a blow to the head. It is dark testimony to thetreatment he gets from his mother that Jerome recalls his father as the ‘moreloving’ of the two.It’s not all hardship though. Such journeys give Jerome experience of the besthis world has to offer. He sits in on discussions between his father andLeonardo da Vinci. He sees Leonardo’s The Last Supper on the refectory wall atthe convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, long before it decays. The artistexperimented with paints that lasted only a couple of decades before they beganto flake and fade. Seeing it later in life, Jerome called it ‘blurred andcolourless’ in comparison with the glorious painting he had seen as a boy. Idaren’t tell him about Napoleon’s troops peppering it with stones and horsedung.For all the occasional glamour, serving his father fixes Jerome’s gaze on adifferent path. Fazio is grooming his son for a legal career, but in vain: bythe time he is eight years old, the boy has decided that legal books are tooheavy and legal arguments too dull and inconclusive. Numbers, geometry, andmedicine are much more attractive. By the age of twelve, he has enoughunderstanding in arithmetic to read the works of the Arabic alchemist Jabir ibnHayyan and has developed a theorem that allows him to calculate the distancebetween stars from their latitude and longitude. The theorem is almost certainlyriddled with errors. Nonetheless, the young Jerome’s desire to explore thecosmos is making itself clear, as is his lust for lasting fame. ‘I desire todefend myself from obscurity,’ the precocious twelve-year-old writes in a letterto a friend.ψ‘Five hundred years later, people still know your name,’ I tell him. He looksunconvinced.He steeples his hands together, laying his elbows on the splintered wood of thedesk. The apex of the steeple covers the pox scar on his nose — the pose lookspractised, useful for hiding this small disfigurement.‘It’s what you wanted, isn’t it?’He gives me no response. Just a continued fixed stare. He appears to be suckingon the emerald again. It is hard to know how to take this forward. I want toflatter him, to convey my admiration. I don’t want to tell him that he isactually overwhelmingly unknown. Really, it is only a few mathematicians and asmattering of historians who have any familiarity with his work. Every day,hundreds of millions of people drive around in cars whose power transmissiondepends upon a Cardan joint, but they don’t know anything about the man himself.Also, I’m wary of opening up a discussion of cars and internal combustionengines. That might be a lot to take in for a man who has just learned he is toface the Inquisition.‘What are they accusing you of?’ I ask, nodding to the door that leads out ofthe cell. I ask as if I don’t know.Jerome’s eyebrows lower and his eyes narrow. He stares at me in open suspicion.Finally, he takes the stone from his mouth and breaks his silence.‘My father told me he was visited by a familiar spirit the whole of his life,’he says. ‘Are you the same one?’‘Is that what you think I am?’ The idea makes me laugh out loud. ‘A spirit? Yourguardian angel?’He stares at me, confused, then begins to smile, an endearing but ugly sightthat lifts the pox scars on his face out from behind the hairs of his beard. ‘Itwas you,’ he beams. ‘You sent me the warnings. About my mother’s death, andGiovanni’s marriage, and …’He stops because I am still laughing. This is the trouble with us human beings.We have no ability to confine ourselves to the realities of the naturaluniverse. As soon as anything remotely inexplicable happens, we reach for thesupernatural.ψPerhaps this is a good time to tackle the astrology question. Here’s the simpletruth: I could not be such good friends with Jerome if I did not consider him arational man. He is not one to attribute supernatural causes to everything thathe can’t explain. In fact, he celebrates the strange and wonderful abilities ofthe human mind, its seemingly endless capacity to reason, imagine, and invent.He records his encounters with a variety of technologies and innovations thathave impressed him over the years, things such as a hinged, hooked hand thatwould close on a thief’s fingers if he tried to take money from a purse. ‘Ourage is prolific of distinguished and very great inventions,’ he says in DeSubtilitate (On Subtlety), a book he published in 1550, aged forty-nine.Nothing impressed him more than the skills of a great conjuror. He marvels atthe card tricks that confuse, then amaze, the onlooker. He doesn’t understandhow the conjuror can cause his audience to choose specific cards from the pack.‘It was too extraordinary for us to follow by human deliberation … unless he hadsometimes asked us to take out a number of different cards, I would havesuspected that he had supplied a pack consisting of cards of the same kind,’ hesays. For all the mystical thinking of his epoch and his own belief in thereality of the supernatural, he sees no dark influence at work. ‘The evidencewas that it all was the work of a conjurer rather than demons,’ he writes.If the card sharps were entertaining, the Renaissance showmen were astonishing:There is no end to the inventions of this skill — shifting things, hiding them,swallowing them, emitting floods of fluid from one’s eyes or forehead, producingnails and string from one’s mouth, chewing glass, piercing one’s arms and handswith a spike, uniting iron chains while the links remain intact — indeed, agreater feat, I have seen three rings thrown up and coming down interlinked,though they were unbroken and separate before and while being thrown up … Theyshow a child without a head, and the head without the child — but they are allalive, and the child comes to no harm in the meantime.Then there are the rope walkers, who would climb steep lines from the ground upinto a tower, often while balancing something — or someone — on their shoulders.Jerome assures us in On Subtlety that there is no occult power at work. It is,he says, simply a demonstration of the extraordinary feats to be achieved whenwe gain an understanding of how nature is. ‘It is in fact magic, when somethingextraordinary is done on natural principles, concealed though these are,’ hesays.I am telling you all this because I want you to understand he is no different toyou and me, even if he does believe in the influence of the stars and planetsover the lives of humans. Such a belief is a completely tolerable idea at hisstage in history and it is still surprisingly inviting to an intelligent humanmind. I know this because I tried it out.I decided quite early on that, if I am to understand Jerome, to know him alittle, I should dabble in astrology. To this end, I had a couple of readingsdone. One was by an Indian astrologer called Vishal. He knew only my name, anddate and place of birth, and didn’t tell me anything terribly profound until Iasked him about the car I had just bought. His astrological charts were all onhis laptop computer (a pleasing conjunction of ancient and modern) and it didn’ttake him long to tap something car-related into the program.‘I see two cars in your future,’ he said.I laughed. ‘Does that mean I’ve bought a dud?’‘I can’t tell you that,’ he said.Apparently, Vishal just saw two cars. And two weeks later, my mechanic wasworking on the one I had bought when he found a significant problem. He informedme I had indeed bought a dud. I wish I could tell you it was an issue with theCardan joint, but it was a simple case of hidden but chronic chassis corrosion.He advised me to return the car, get my money back, and buy another — preferablyfrom a reputable dealer.My other reading was by a woman called Sue. Perhaps I had been primed by Vishal,but some of her pronouncements seemed uncanny. Then, however, I had apsychologist listen to a recording of the session and he was gloriouslyunimpressed. Sue was performing the classic generalisations designed to connectwith almost anyone of my age and gender, he said. Vishal, he added, had justbeen lucky with a stab in the dark about the car.I felt suitably chastised. But it made me realise how easy it is to believe thathidden causes lie behind everyday events.Jerome’s investigations of astrology were, to him, entirely rational. In aworldview formed by the biblical scriptures, heavenly portents are a given. Thebook of Revelation declares that the heavens are like a scroll of parchment — sowhy not see what’s written on it? Genesis tells us that the stars and the moonwere given ‘for signs and for seasons’. There are moments in Israelite historywhen we are told the sun stood still in the sky. The prophets saw all kinds ofcelestial signs associated with divine judgement: Isaiah tells us the sun willbe ‘dark at its rising’; Joel tells us ‘the stars withdraw their shining’. True,there are passages condemning astrology used for divination, but that strictureis about attempting to know the mind of God. The writers clearly want us to beaware of God’s control over nature and its betrayal of his mood in signs writtenon the sky.Even within this paradigm of reasonable astrology, Jerome is something of aprogressive, imbued with a rising scepticism. Take that as a mark of his finemind: the scepticism arose despite his conservative upbringing. Jerome’s fathertaught him the principles of casting horoscopes and he was often in the companyof men — always men — discussing the art of interpreting the celestial sphere.Which makes it all the more remarkable that the young Jerome writes this to afriend in 1519, at the age of eighteen:It was very well for my father to wring his hands at the issue of fortunedetermined by the heavenly bodies on the houses where we set our homes; but Irecall thinking that the distance was very great for such an issue to be made,for might not the sun shine on Cathay when rain fell upon Padua? And if thebiggest star of all could not stretch its warmth thus far, how could the smallerones seem to malign from such a height? Now I know I was in error; but it was achildish curiosity and not without the gleanings of a cynic.Centuries later, we science lovers consider ourselves to have a moresophisticated perspective. There is no physical force — and certainly not oneassociated with the stars or planets — that might influence our personalities orlife events. Yes, there are forces that act at a distance — gravity andelectromagnetism, for instance — but they are weak and ineffectual, even overthe kinds of distances that stretch between Earth’s countries and continents.What force could possibly exert influence on us from the planets or stars?But even in Jerome’s time, it was not a modern thing to question astrology.Cicero and Augustine had offered criticisms. Logical thinkers had pointed outthat the time and date of birth could not determine character and destiny, asastrologers claimed, because twins often had very different characters anddestinies. The Genesis account of Jacob and Esau makes that abundantly clear.What’s more, astrologers were adept at self-examination. Ptolemy, theGreek-Egyptian mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer, was a vicious criticof his own predictive powers and their limitations. It was acknowledged that, ina world created only a few thousand years before, as the contemporary cosmologyhad it, there hadn’t been time for some of the conjunctions and other phenomenato occur repeatedly. Thinkers acknowledge that if the celestial events hadhappened only once in recorded history, any claims about their significancerelied on entirely spurious single-point observations.Jerome remained conflicted. The stars and planets are not too distant to exertsome influence, he suggested. It is clear from his other writings that he isconvinced an influence does exist. However, he admits he has only the vaguestidea of what is going on and that it may not be exerted over everything in life.‘A man is a fool who attaches too much meaning to insignificant events,’ he saysin his autobiography, The Book of My Life. He was seventy-five years old thenand clearly still believed the heavenly portents were signs of something — theywere just incredibly difficult to read. ‘There were stars which threatened, fromevery aspect, my death, which all declared would be before my forty-fifth year,’he writes, ‘all vain findings, for I live, and I am in my seventy-fifth year! Itis not the fallibility of the art; it is the inexperience of the artificer.’ψJerome’s views on astrology mirror our own on quantum physics. In quantumexperiments we see things appear in two different places at once, or exert aninstantaneous influence over something that is half a world away. We cannot makesense of it, but we don’t dismiss it as ridiculous. We have the evidence of ourexperiments, after all, just as the astrologers have the ‘evidence’ ofexperience.For three years, I worked in a research laboratory studying quantum physics. Atthe end of those three years, I produced a report of my research: my PhD thesis.It sits on the shelf above my desk, bound in blue with the title embossed ingold: ‘Quantum mechanical behaviour of superconducting weak link capacitorcircuits in the range from 9K to 0.3K.’ It describes a project to take a ring ofniobium metal and make the electrical current circulating within it travel intwo directions at once. Let me be clear: this is not two different currents, butone, doing two things simultaneously.The phenomenon is known as superposition. I was not the first to create asuperposition in a niobium ring — far from it (though I was the first to do itat the particularly low temperatures to which my niobium ring was cooled). Norwas I the last; others have followed up the work. But we still don’t reallyunderstand it.The explanation of superposition — such as it is — is more commonly laid out interms of the ‘double slit experiment’. It demonstrates that matter cansimultaneously exist as discrete objects, like an archer’s arrow, and as waves,such as those that travel through a large, continuous body of water.Imagine an archer trying to fire arrows into the watchtower of a fortifiedmedieval castle. His only hope of getting his arrows to the inside is by firingat one of the two narrow arrow slits set two metres apart in the wall. Assuminghe is good at his job, his arrows will hit the wall behind the arrow slits.There will be a cluster of arrows at two distinct points on that wall.Now imagine a trebuchet that throws a huge bucketful of water at the wall. Thewater will go through both slits and the two portions that emerge into the roomwill hit each other as they travel towards the far wall. That means they affecteach others’ paths, so there won’t be two distinct splashes on the wall, but amessy wet patch that stretches across its extent. It might be a bit wetter atthe points directly behind the arrow slits, but much of the rest of the wallwill be wet, too.We can imagine this because we know how single objects or particles behave andwe know how things like large bodies of liquid behave. What we also know now isthat there are things that behave like both — and neither.Physicists generally describe the double slit experiment in terms of light. Thelight is fired at two very narrow slits in an opaque barrier. The far wall onthe other side of the barrier is a light-detecting screen.When English scientist Thomas Young shone light on a pair of slits in 1803, hefound that the light hit the screen giving a peculiar pattern of bright and darkareas. He explained this in terms of two light beams emerging from the slits(one from each slit) and ‘interfering’ with each other. Interference was a knownproperty of waves. When two water waves, for example, travel in the samedirection, they will spread out and overlap. If the crest of one wave coincideswith the crest of the other, their strength is doubled, and a larger crest iscreated. Similarly, if the wave troughs coincide, the trough is deepened. Wherea crest meets a trough, the wave is destroyed and the water is, effectively,flat.The pattern of light and dark ‘fringes’, to Young, was long-sought proof thatlight is a wave, not a particle. An old debate was finally settled.Except that it wasn’t. Early in the nineteenth century, Einstein showed thatlight exists as particles we now call photons. He won a Nobel Prize for hisefforts and a few decades later we learned to control lasers that could emit onephoton at a time. That changed the face of physics forever.Repeat Young’s experiment with just a single photon fired at the slits andsomething utterly extraordinary happens. You have to replace the light-detectingscreen with one that permanently records the impact site of each photon bychanging colour, say from black to white, but it is worth the effort. You alsohave to be patient: with just one photon hitting the screen at a time, it takesa little while for the miracle to emerge. But emerge it does.Eventually, the screen has turned from black to white in exactly the same placesas it would if two beams of light were emerging from the slits. There is stillinterference, despite the fact that there is only one photon in the apparatus atany one time. The only explanation is that the single photon has somehowtravelled through both slits simultaneously and then interfered with itself.This experiment — which has been conducted countless times without any failures— contains what the celebrated physicist Richard Feynman called ‘the onlymystery’ of quantum physics. The mystery is that, given a choice of two paths, aquantum particle takes both. It happens with single electrons (Claus Jönsson ofthe University of Tübingen was the first to observe that, in 1961) and withlarger particles, such as atoms and molecules. It happens with the large body ofquantum material (known as a Bose–Einstein condensate) that makes up theelectrical current within my ring of niobium. Yet none of these occurrences makesense.What makes it even more confounding is the fact that, if you try to see whichpath the particle took by placing some kind of detector on one of the slits, theinterference pattern goes away and you go back to two distinct clumps. Underobservation, continuous waves turn back into discrete particles. It is as ifwatching the water emerge from the arrow slit makes the water change itsfundamental character and suddenly behave like the archer’s arrows. In thequantum world, it seems, the weirdness doesn’t like to be watched.This is entirely within the theory’s predictions. Quantum theory is our mostsuccessful mathematical framework and its predictions have never been wrong.However, it is utterly bankrupt when it comes to explaining the physical world.It tells us what we will see in any given quantum experiment, but leaves the‘interpretation’ — a description of what is actually going on — entirely up tous.So, what happens between the time when the photon enters the apparatus and isdetected at the other side? When does the photon begin its double existence? Ifthose slits could talk, what would they tell us? We don’t yet know.The interpretations of quantum physics are the tales we have constructed aroundthis simple experiment, and any one of them might be true. One interpretation —explanation, if you like — says the photon simply isn’t real until you detect itat its final resting place. That means you can’t actually say that it wentthrough both slits; in the absence of detection, it didn’t have any existence inthe experiment. Another interpretation says there is an undetectable ‘guidingwave’ that determines the photon’s path through one slit, while leaving a falsetrail that suggests it went through both. Another is that there is a branchingof worlds where, in one world, the photon went through one slit and,simultaneously, in another world, it went through the other. The interferencepattern we see is the ‘crosstalk’ between these worlds.What do you make of this? Are you comfortable with things pinging into existenceonly when they hit a detector? Can you stretch to a false trail created by anundetectable wave? And what about these parallel worlds? Does that seem like itcould ever be the simplest, most plausible explanation for the outcome of anexperiment?Of course not. So we delve deeper, convinced that the fault lies with our poorgrasp of reality. ‘Quantum theory does not trouble me at all. It is just the waythe world works,’ the great physicist John Archibald Wheeler once wrote. ‘Whateats me, gets me, drives me, pushes me, is to understand how it got that way …the quantum is the crack in the armor that covers the secret of existence.’ψFor the young Jerome, curious and sharp-minded, the only way to learn the secretof existence was to practise the art of astrology. This he did throughout hislife, quickly becoming expert at getting under the skin of his subject — andgaining the attention of paying customers.The speed of his advances is illustrated in the difference between his first andsecond astrological publications. The first, published at his own expense whenhe was thirty-three, was a ‘Prognostico’. Typical of the genre, it comprised aseries of short- and long-term predictions about developments in anything fromreligion to politics to the weather. Such pamphlets were commonplace — Europewas crawling with astrologers. No amount of official derision would dampenpublic enthusiasm for foretellings. The Archbishop of Canterbury dismissedMichel de Nostredamus’s 1558 prognostication as a ‘fantastical hotch-potch’, forexample, but a vast swathe of Europeans, from merchants in the market to princesin their palaces, acted on Nostradamus’s words.Jerome was keen to divert some of this attention (and money) his way. Todistinguish himself from other, lesser practitioners who were ‘defiling thisnoble science’, as Jerome put it, he announced himself as relatively unknown.Not, Jerome added, because he was a poor practitioner of the art, but because hewas not one of those people who is happy to achieve fame by saying what noblemenwant to hear.Having set out his stall with this humblebrag, he blinds the reader of hisPrognostico with details of offset axes in the celestial spheres and theprecession of equinoxes. There is no shortage of technical detail by which heestablishes his scientific credentials. He stops short of predictions about warsbecause ‘there is no part of astrology harder than this one, and yet the bulk ofthese crazy diviners speak more boldly about it, in their bestiality, than aboutanything else.’Jerome later refers to his works of this time as ‘astronomical tables’, buthowever scientific Jerome wanted his astrological works to appear, they wereprimarily published to make money and create a reputation. As a backup, he wascareful to record himself as ‘a doctor from Milan’ on the title page — anadvertisement for his other line of business. He was, at this stage, not yetlicensed to practise medicine by the Milanese College of Physicians and, withouta licence, he couldn’t officially see patients within the city. Yet he needed toscrape together a living and was open to offers. Jerome knew he had his work cutout making it as an astrologer in such a controversial and overcrowded space.That’s why he followed a different path with his second publication: Supplementto the Almanach. Published four years later, in 1538, its unique selling pointis its inclusion of a primer on astronomy. ‘One who wishes to attain knowledgeof the stars must begin with knowledge of the planets,’ Jerome explains. And sohe lays out the movements of the known planets and instructs the reader on howto find each of them in the sky. He explains how to find the pole and all theconstellations of the Zodiac. He gives tips on remembering all the variouspositions. It is an unprecedented popularisation of astrology, removing thebarrier between amateur and professional; Jerome is extending an open invitationto anyone wanting to understand the secrets of the stars. He is, according tothe twenty-first-century scholar Anthony Grafton, ‘a sixteenth-centurycounterpart to Patrick Moore or Carl Sagan’.All he needs from his client is humility and tolerance. ‘This alone I ask you, Oreader, that when you peruse the account of these marvels that you do not set upfor yourself as a standard human intellectual pride but rather the great sizeand vastness of earth and sky.’ It is Jerome’s way of excusing hisapproximations and errors: astronomer and astrologer cannot hope for absoluteprecision when dealing with the near infinite phenomena of the celestial sphere.That said, Jerome considers himself well within the limits of the plausible.‘And, comparing with that Infinity these slender shadows in which miserably andanxiously we are enveloped, you will easily know that I have related nothingwhich is beyond belief,’ he says.A second volume of this publication — Corrections to Errors of Time and Motion —explains the latest thinking about the motions of the planets, offeringcorrections to errors in accepted texts. These revisions were drawn fromJerome’s own observations of the sky. It is a triumph: he paints himself as ahands-on astronomer, a trustworthy guide who has done more than just read thetexts of the ancient sages. Two centuries later, the great Tycho Brahe will citeJerome’s works with respect. Having laid out his scientific credentials, Jeromethen explains how science can improve on traditional astrology. And having donethat, he ensures its popularity by going on to offer ten celebrity horoscopes.Some were bigger celebrities than others, it has to be said. His father, Fazio,for example, was on the lesser-known side. But he also drew up a chart forSuleiman the Magnificent; for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; for King FrancisI of France; and — perhaps most importantly — for Pope Paul III, himself a greatbeliever in astrology.This isn’t just about catching public interest. It is a calculated bid forinfluence. Jerome fully believes he is worth listening to. He believes himselfpossessed of gifts and insights that he wants to share widely. He is approachinghis fourth decade and keen to get on in the world. And so he dedicates the bookto an old acquaintance of whom we’ll hear more very soon: Filippo Archinto.At that time, Archinto was the governor of Rome. In return for Jerome’sdedication, Archinto told Jerome that Pope Paul might be open to a gift or two,which could establish the astrologer as a major public figure. So Jerome wentall-out and created a horoscope of Christ to be presented to the Pope. Andnearly forty years later, in 1570, that is what has landed him here, awaitingtrial at the Inquisition and convinced that God has been protecting him througha guardian angel.It seems odd that Jerome would think of me as any kind of useful guardian — heis in prison, after all. And this angel certainly did nothing to protect himfrom the machinations of Nicolo Tartaglia."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Nicolo Tartaglia’s story begins in the north of Italy, in the late fifteenthcentury. In the city of Brescia, fifty miles east of Milan, a baby boy has beenabandoned in a haycart. The baby is taken to a home for waifs run by local nunsand they name him Michele. The boy grows, but not much: Michele is so small hebecomes known as Micheletto.Eventually, the sisters find Micheletto a kitchen job with a local dignitary. Heis clearly resourceful: he manages to have himself transferred from the kitchento the stables, and then, somehow — no one knows how — reaches the almostmiraculous position where he owns a horse. Within a short time, he is known asMicheletto the Rider. Very quickly, the horse proves its worth when it enablesMicheletto to become the local postman. He is the most reliable man to carryletters around the lakes, hills, and valleys of the Lombardy region of northernItaly, riding at good speed between Brescia, Verona, and Bergamo.One of Micheletto’s journeys takes him to the house owned by a gentleman ofVerona, where he encounters a serving girl called Maria. Evidently, Michelettoand Maria hit it off, because in 1496 they are married. In a short while, theyhave three children. It is the middle child, Nicolo, that is to become Jerome’snemesis.These are not happy times in Italy, but Maria and Micheletto are happy enoughfor their part. Tragically, however, their love is to become the victim ofpolitical intrigue.Ten years into their marriage, the world around them is falling apart. TheFrench control the Lombardy region, but rumours abound that the Brescians arebeginning to stir against the occupying force. Keen to nip the rebellion in thebud, France’s commander for the region, General Gaston de Foix, orders thatletters from Brescia be intercepted so that any plans for an uprising can bediscovered. The postman’s days are numbered.Shortly after the order is given, Micheletto is ambushed by Gaston’s men in thefoothills of the Lombardy Alps. They find nothing incriminating: Micheletto’smail sacks contain only a handful of dull missives on trade agreements and theeveryday correspondence of Brescian nobles. But the French soldiers kill himanyway.Maria is devastated. Not only is her heart broken, but her household is strippedof its income and the family is thrown into poverty. And then, just when itlooks like things can’t get any worse, they do.General Gaston’s suspicions about the Brescians were well founded. By the timeNicolo is twelve, the simmering discontent has boiled over. In an act of supremecourage, the Brescian community of weavers and blacksmiths rises up and drivesout the French soldiers stationed in the city’s garrison. But not for long.Gaston returns to Brescia with his entire army, and shows no mercy. In sevendays of slaughter and arson, the French kill 46,000 Brescians, most of thecity’s inhabitants. The survivors — including Maria and her family — seeksanctuary in the cathedral. However, the French have no respect for the claim ofsanctuary. Gaston’s men burst in, brandishing swords and knives, and set uponthe women and children. Though a screaming Maria does her best to protect herfamily, Nicolo takes an appalling blow to the face that cuts through his lipsand palate and takes out most of his teeth.Without Maria’s care, Nicolo would have died. She has no money for professionalmedical help, but she has seen dogs lick their wounds and decides to follow thatinstinct. She bathes her son’s cuts in her own saliva and keeps his injuries asclean as is possible in the aftermath of such brutal slaughter. Nicolo ishideously disfigured and robbed of the ability to speak. But he recovers. Oncehis strength has returned, a ruthless ambition kicks in. It is first manifest inhis education. His schooling had stopped years earlier, immediately after hisfather’s death, because there was no money. Aged fourteen, however, Nicoloarranges fifteen days of schooling on credit. This is only enough time forNicolo to learn to form the letters of the alphabet up to k and he is thrown outonce it becomes clear to the tutor that the pupil can no longer pay. Not,however, before the student has stolen his teacher’s textbook. Returning homewith his loot, Nicolo sets about instructing himself in the basics of literacyand numeracy. Then he learns everything else he can: ‘I continued to labour bymyself over the works of dead men, accompanied only by the daughter of povertythat is called industry,’ is how Tartaglia describes that self-education.When he is old enough, Nicolo covers his scars with as much beard as he cangrow. He teaches himself to communicate as well as his wounds will permit. Hisassociates come to know him as ‘Tartaglia’: The Stammerer. Thanks toMicheletto’s illegitimate origins, he has no proper surname and he takes his newmoniker with a defiant pride. It suits the young man to wear his grim brush withdeath as a badge of honour. Nicolo Tartaglia is not easily overcome.ψIn Milan, fifty miles to the west, Jerome is afforded opportunities which TheStammerer will never have. Jerome’s parents are learning to live together underthe same roof — they even marry, eventually — and his father teaches him Latinfor an hour every morning. This is the language of scholars and debate, thelanguage of learning, which no one teaches Tartaglia. That is why Tartaglia’swritings will not be granted space in the academic libraries; The Stammerer willfeel forever inferior because he can read and write only in the clumsy Venetiandialect of his youth.Yet as Jerome learns Latin, he also learns about his culture. He studieshoroscopes, unicorns, the rules of dice games, the features of the naturalworld, and more. He is taken to the houses of the great and good of the ItalianRenaissance. He even remarks upon his father’s elevated contacts in his journal:‘My father’s reputation as a scholar was such that he was consulted by superiorpersons,’ the twelve-year-old writes (rather pompously). He develops anappreciation for music and takes every opportunity to surround himself withmusicians and singers. The shadow that comes with being born out of wedlockhangs over him, but does not seem to rob him of respectability.For all his father’s attentions, however, Jerome only attends university becauseof his mother.It is 1519. Fazio is seventy-four, and every year seems to weigh heavier uponhis stooped shoulders. Jerome is now eighteen and keen to fly free, but Faziowants — deserves, the old man thinks — to keep his son at hand as a porter andscribe. Eventually, he reasons, Jerome can train as a lawyer, following in hisfather’s footsteps. Fazio can even arrange for his son to inherit his annual onehundred crown stipend from the city courts. It is not a large sum, but it issomething on which the boy could build a business. These are austere times andit makes perfect sense. Unfortunately, the son is not sensible. Jerome is notmotivated by money and the desire for life’s comforts. A life as a small-townlawyer is no path to greatness and that is the path he intends to walk. And soJerome refuses to listen to his father’s pleading. He wants to study medicine athis father’s alma mater in nearby Pavia instead. Aware of the rift opening upbetween the men of her household, Chiara jumps in. Perhaps she wants her son tobe happy or perhaps she is simply keen for Jerome to supplement the householdincome. Whatever the reason, she implores Fazio to let Jerome strike out on hisown, leave Milan, and study at Pavia. They throw the idea back and forth, eachhoping to score a palpable hit. And then, one afternoon, matters come to a head.In the middle of an argument over their son’s future, Fazio hits Chiara acrossthe shoulders with his staff. She falls, knocking her head on the table beforeshe collapses onto the stone floor.Unfortunately for Fazio, Chiara’s sister, Margarita, is living with them. Shewitnesses the assault and begins to curse Jerome and his father, threateningcriminal proceedings against her sister’s assailant. Chiara, not terriblywounded and ever wily, sees her chance. She wipes the blood from her foreheadand extracts a promise from Fazio: if she brings no charges, will he relent, andsend their Jerome to the university to study medicine?This moment of violence and calculated manipulation defines Jerome’s path. Faziohas no choice but to concede and the youth enrols at Pavia in the medicalschool. Finding that he needs money to pay his way, however, Jerome takes upgambling. It is for this reason that he becomes the first person to applymathematics to the problem of winning at cards and dice. His notes, which layout what we now know as the mathematical rules of probability, give him areliable means of beating his opponents. Erudite as they might seem with fivehundred years of hindsight, those probability calculations did not begin as anoble venture in pure mathematics. They were simply Jerome’s best chance ofpaying the bills.ψNight has fallen. It may be the same night; it may be another. All I know isthat I am here and Jerome is aware that I am sitting on the straw in the cornerof his cell. There is moonlight and every now and then I see him look up fromhis writing and turn his head towards me. He no longer looks at all disturbed bymy presence; he seems to welcome it.‘Tell me something,’ I say. ‘Did you exaggerate the story about Senator Lezun?Did he really fish you out of the canal after you had attacked him?’The hint of a smile moves across Jerome’s lips, but he says nothing.‘I bet you weren’t really wearing armour,’ I say.His weak eyes light up at the word. ‘I accept your bet,’ he says. ‘What are thestakes?’I hesitate. Is it foolish to gamble against the inventor of probability?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3When it comes to the rules of chance, Jerome Cardano hasn’t received the credithe deserves. The best-known version of the theory of probability’s genesisbegins almost a century after Jerome’s death, with the confusion of aseventeenth-century gambler, the Chevalier de Méré.Known to his friends as Antoine Gombaud, the Chevalier was a successfulaccumulator of other people’s money. Back then, he made a good living by bettingwith less insightful men that he could throw a six in just four separate dierolls. He gave them even odds and pocketed their cash night after night.Then he became ambitious. Gombaud’s first problem arose when he extended hishustle to throwing a double six in twenty-four dice throws. He reasoned that itshould work and tried it out. To his surprise, it was an utter failure. Gombaudtook his disappointment, with furrowed brow, to an amateur mathematician calledPierre de Carvaci. He couldn’t understand why it failed, either. De Carvaci thencalled on Blaise Pascal, the physicist and mathematician, for help. Alsoconfounded, Pascal in turn decided to pass the problem to a Toulouse-basedlawyer, Pierre de Fermat, of Last Theorem fame. Pascal and Fermat had a few backand forths on the subject in 1654, and eventually teased out the fact that itwould take twenty-five throws to achieve a double six.That this set of exchanges is widely considered the first effort intounderstanding probabilities would have horrified Jerome, with his ever-presentdesire for lasting fame. After all, he had first addressed the problem in a setof notes written more than a hundred years earlier, while still atwenty-year-old medical student in Pavia.ψBy 1520, according to Giovanni Targio, a tutor at the University of Pavia,Jerome is spending his evenings ‘drinking and gambling in the taverns’. Targiowrites of his student that he ‘gave offence too often for his life to be free ofenemies’. And the truth is that the young Jerome would often roam the streets ofPavia at night in a crude disguise, sword drawn — in flagrant contravention ofthe laws concerning naked weapons on public streets — ‘determined to live somefantasy life’, as his long-suffering tutor put it. That said, Jerome was nofool, and adroitly applied his mathematical mind to working out winningstrategies for the gambling table.Gambling is, at heart, about the random appearance of a string of numbers. InJerome’s time, however, no one believed in randomness. If numbers appeared to berandom, that was only due to a lack of information. The prevailing view was thatGod controlled the die and the result of a roll (or the appearance of a card —cards being merely another way of creating random numbers) was the province ofthe Almighty. If you were out of luck, you must somehow have offended theDivine.‘So God knows everything. But what determines lotteries? — is it from Him?’Jerome asks in On Subtlety. His answer is somewhat confused. ‘Not at all, butfrom some inspiration. However, our law states that lotteries are introduced andcontrolled by God.’ Hard to see it now, perhaps, but Jerome’s Book on Games ofChance, published posthumously in 1663, is an audacious first attempt to — asthe physicist Stephen Hawking put it four and a half centuries later — know themind of God.There are thirty-two chapters. In Chapter 14, the world receives the firstattempt at a law of probability to be applied when the die is cast:So there is one general rule, namely, that we should consider the whole circuit,and the number of those casts which represents in how many ways the favourableresult can occur, and compare that number to the rest of the circuit, andaccording to that proportion should the mutual wagers be laid so that one maycontend on equal terms.In modern terms, Jerome means consider all the possibilities (the ‘wholecircuit’), then think about the number of ways in which you might get the resultyou want. Then find the ratio of those two numbers (the ‘proportion’). Thattells you how the bets should be placed.More than a hundred years were to pass before Gottfried Leibniz came up with thesame formula in 1676:If a situation can lead to different advantageous results ruling out each other,the estimation of the expectation will be the sum of the possible advantages forthe set of all these results, divided into the total number of results.And it would be nearly another century before, in 1774, Pierre-Simon Laplacedelivers what is today generally assumed to be the start of probability theory:The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to it,to the number of possible cases, when there is nothing to make us believe thatone case should occur rather than any other, so that these cases are, for us,equally possible.Bravo Jerome! Yet back in 1520 he did not stop at a simple definition of theprobability of a single event. He also worked out the probabilities associatedwith repeated throws of the die. That isn’t easy. You might struggle, forinstance to work out the probabilities — and thus the right way to bet (andaccept bets) — with two throws of a die.If you can only win with a one or a two, what are the odds of your two throwsboth giving you a win? Here is Jerome’s solution, where a one is an ‘ace’ and atwo is a ‘deuce’:Thus, in the case of one die, let the ace and the deuce be favourable to us; weshall multiply 6, the number of faces, into itself: the result is 36; and twomultiplied into itself will be 4; therefore the odds are 4 to 32, or, wheninverted, 8 to 1.In more modern terms, we start with the first roll and divide the number ofwinning outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, that is, two dividedby six, or one third. The same is true for the second roll, and so we multiplythe two results together: one third times one third is one ninth. That is, thereis one favourable outcome in nine throws. Put another way — Jerome’s way — youlose eight times for every one time that you win. In other words, youropponent’s odds are eight to one.And then three throws:If three throws are necessary, we shall multiply 3 times; thus, 6 multipliedinto itself and then again into itself gives 216; and 2 multiplied into itselfand again into 2, gives 8; take away 8 from 216: the result will be 208; and sothe odds are 208 to 8, or 26 to 1. And if four throws are necessary, the numberswill be found by the same reasoning …From this, Jerome deduced a general rule: Cardano’s Formula, which is a means ofworking out and understanding probabilities.Nor did Jerome stop there. Instead, he went on to deduce what we now call the‘law of large numbers’, which shows that large numbers of repetitions of aprobabilistic process produce a predictable overcome. Jerome has, to all intentsand purposes, pioneered statistics.Imagine flipping a coin four times. You know you should expect two heads and twotails, but you wouldn’t be surprised if you got three heads and one tail, orvice versa, or even four heads or four tails. We know that, in processes thatdepend on chance, flukes happen.Now imagine flipping that coin a thousand times. If you ended up with onethousand heads, you would assume the coin was weighted. Flukes are reasonableonly with small numbers. Even six hundred heads out of a thousand tosses wouldbe suspicious because, with such a large number of coin tosses, we expectsomething close to a fifty-fifty ratio.Jerome worked out that one thousand tosses of a fair coin, where the odds of ahead is one half, should give five hundred heads. In other words, you take thenumber of repetitions and multiply it by the probability of a particularoutcome. That gives you the rough number of times that that outcome shouldoccur. If it doesn’t, someone is probably cheating.Sadly for Jerome, this law of large numbers has been attributed to amathematician, Jacob Bernoulli, who only worked it out — calling it his ‘goldentheorem’ — 150 years later. But at least Jerome reaped its benefits, for it ishis hard-won understanding of how the odds play out that tells Jerome, during avisit to Venice a few years after his graduation, that something is amiss at thegambling table of Senator Thomas Lezun.ψIt is 8 September 1526, the day of the Blessed Virgin’s birthday. Those of amore devout disposition have spent the day in Venice’s fine churches, recitingthe appropriate prayer:Let it be thy glory, O Virgin who destroyest all heresies, to restore unity andpeace once more to all the Christian people.Jerome, though, is not at prayer. Virgins are not really his thing — especiallyvirgin mothers. In a quarter of a century, in On Subtlety, he will even dare towrite of the ‘notorious faked feat, that children are born to women withoutsexual intercourse’. It may not have been his wisest move, given his eventualarrest by the Inquisition.Today he is in the Senator’s house, trying to win back the property he hadpreviously lost to his host. He is also hoping to win a night with a beautifulprostitute, a stake that had been on the table the night before. As atwenty-five-year-old man suffering from debilitating impotence, that had been aparticularly alluring bet. It may even have distracted him from watching theSenator’s play more carefully. Yesterday was a bad day. Jerome lost his clothesand his rings, as well as his chance of curing his problem through theattentions of a beautiful woman. But things are different today. On the Virgin’sbirthday, he has regained his footing. He knows now why he has done so badly.After so many hands of cards, it has become clear that the law of large numbersis not setting the scores straight. After all, this law says that all the cardsshould come up equally often and that no outcomes should be particularlyguessable. Barring a few minor anomalies, everything should therefore follow thelaws of probability that Jerome worked out a few years ago. But the statisticsare skewed. The best explanation is always the most obvious: the Senator hasbeen cheating. Jerome’s brain is working well today. He has worked out that thecards are marked, and how, and in a few well-judged hands he wins back hisclothes and jewellery. He sends them home with his servant because he knows heis about to make a hurried exit and doesn’t want to be encumbered. He carries onwith the game and wins enough money that he needs to bag it up. He puts all butone bag into the pockets of his cloak.His heart is racing, but he is determined to make his accusation. He takes amoment to weigh his options. The front door is locked and the Senator has twoservants in the room. The house is festooned with weapons, not all of themdecorative. He glances up. Two lances hang from the beamed ceiling within easyreach of the servants. This is a brave — maybe foolhardy — thing to do, but theadrenaline is pumping and rationality is receding from his brain. So he drawshis dagger.Foolish and extreme as it may seem, Jerome has done his calculations and isconfident enough to strike. His blade slashes across the Senator’s face. Hethrows a bag of money across the table to make amends for his violence. ‘Yourmaster’s cards are marked,’ he announces to the servants. ‘Unlock the door andlet me go, or I will kill you.’ They look to their master, who is weighing thebag of money in his hand. Jerome waits for the Senator’s response, his heartstill beating wildly. He has gambled well. The Senator puts down the money bag,considers his own reputation, and, with a hand wiping the blood from his cheek,orders the door to be unlocked. Jerome is free to go.Outside, Venice is in darkness. Jerome begins to doubt. What sentence, hewonders, might he receive for an attack upon a respected public figure? It wouldbe wise, he decides, to lay low until he can be sure the Senator doesn’t haverevenge in mind.He dons a cloak, and — apparently — some leather armour. He keeps his weapon tohand. He wanders through Venice, keeping to the shadows. If the Senator hasreported him to the magistrate, the peace keepers will be out looking for him.And then, after a few hours of careful shadow hopping, it happens. With hisnervous glances to left and right, his peering through the dark, Jerome is notpaying enough attention to the ground beneath his feet. Slipping on a wet board,he fails to regain his balance and falls into the freezing, stinking waters of aVenetian canal. His clothing makes it hard — too hard — to swim. He begins tothink he might drown.Then, above his splashing, he hears the sound of an oar slapping at water. Outof the darkness looms a boat. Jerome makes a grab for one of the oars. Hecatches it, and the attention of the man wielding it. Shouts go up, and the crewbegin to pull him, slippery, dripping, and heavy as he is, out of the water.Eventually, after much effort, he is lying facedown on the deck. He turnshimself over, looks up, and finds the owner of the boat staring down at him. Herecognises the man immediately, despite the bandages that cover half his face.Of all possible rescuers, it is Senator Thomas Lezun who looks down upon him.Jerome’s eyes widen and his mind begins a new calculation of probabilities. WillLezun, afforded this opportunity by fickle fate, take his revenge?ψTo Jerome, everything happens for a reason. If the dice land a certain way, itis because the Prince of Fortune decrees it. If he is rescued from a canal by aman whom he earlier insulted, it is God’s way of making a point.To me, it is just coincidence. Coincidence makes fools of us all — we cannothelp but read it as significant, but we are easily deluded. How many times haveyou heard someone declare that ‘everything happens for a reason’? It doesn’t.Not if quantum theory is to be believed.One of the most famous quotes in all of modern science is Einstein’s commentthat ‘I cannot believe that God plays dice with the universe.’ This was hisresponse to the contention that some of the material world’s occurrences are notpreceded by a cause. A single atom of a radioactive material, for example, willemit a particle at random. There is no way to predict when this will happen andthere is no known trigger. You can observe lots of atoms emitting particles anduse the law of large numbers to give you an average time for emission to happen.But that tells you nothing about what makes it happen in any one atom.Here it is worth stressing that this is only true, as far as we know, on verysmall scales. If I use a billiard cue to hit a ball into a pocket and know allthe angles and forces involved, I can use the laws of physics developed byNewton to predict the paths of both cue and ball. Nonetheless, if I take oneatom from one of those balls and fire it at two suitably sized and suitablyseparated openings — rather like two billiard-table pockets placed next to oneanother — there is no way to tell into which pocket it will drop. This isanother manifestation of the double slit experiment that haunts our imagination.After a few dozen perfect repetitions I will get the sense of the most probableoutcome, but each individual atom seems to make up its own mind. In each event,the effect has no cause.The same is true if I fire a particle of light — a photon — at a mirror. Thereis a small probability it will pass straight through, and a larger probabilitythat it will be reflected. If I fire a million photons at the mirror, perhapsonly three will go through unreflected. But there is nothing special about thosethree. It is simply that random chance has dictated that they are not reflected.It is another cause-free event, nothing more significant than an outcome of thelaws of probability. This is just like you winning the lottery when you havebought no more tickets than anyone else. God, it turns out, does play dice.There is an obvious question to confront here. Why are the smaller particles —atoms and photons, for example — subject to purely random outcomes and events,whereas billiard balls are not? Nobody knows. Something happens to make theevents of our world, the ‘macro’ world, deterministic, predictable, not random.All we can say is that we do not follow the same rules as the ‘micro’ world ofatomic and subatomic particles, where probability theory, the theory birthed byJerome, is the only way to predict the future. There is an unsatisfactory darkspace in our knowledge.ψ‘So what did Lezun do?’ I ask.‘He handed me a set of his own clothes,’ Jerome says. ‘I can still see hissmirking face now.’‘And were you wearing armour?’‘Where did you read that I was?’‘In your autobiography, De Vita Propria Liber: The Book of My Life.’He smirks, calculating quickly that he has the bet sewn up. ‘Interesting,’ hesays. ‘I haven’t written it yet.’Thanks to my sudden confusion, I forget to ask about the prostitute.Scientifically problematic, isn’t it, that I am conveying information fromJerome’s future? This is one of the strongest arguments against time travel; ifyou can influence the past, chronology, cause and effect, and common sense canbe broken down far too easily. But, as we have already discussed, quantum theory— and its experiments — have shown time and again that cause-and-effect are notfundamental attributes of the universe. In order to understand why that is, wehave to go back to basics, to the origins of quantum theory. And that storybegins before history.Ever since our species’ birth, humans have looked for correlations betweenphenomena in the heavens and on Earth as a means to progress and success.Correlations between planting seeds at a new moon and reaping a bumper harvest,for example. Or perhaps we linked the appearance of a comet and an unexpecteddefeat in battle, or a particular arrangement of the planets with the birth of aking.To make sense of these links, we began to note them down on stone and claytablets. Later, we used paper. Once we had permanent records, we begansystematically analysing that data, mining them for patterns that would help usto predict future events. A small subset of people even began to try to makesense of how the universe itself works. That subset of people — we now call themscientists — eventually showed that the hypothesis that the motions of the starsand planets cause effects on Earth could not be supported by the data. So whilethe predictors of the future carried on with their practice — unsupported byevidence, but eagerly watched by the general public — the scientists intent onunderstanding how the universe works abandoned the skies and began to pull theworld apart. This is what led us, eventually, to the quantum.Imagine taking a clock apart piece by piece. You will see its constituent parts— the cogs and wheels — and gain a sense of what they do. But now imaginewanting to know how the cogs and wheels obtain their properties. It won’t belong before you are investigating the properties of iron. Grind away at someiron and you’ll eventually get down to the very fundamental building block ofthat element: an atom of iron.The atom has always been controversial. A Greek scientist, Democritus, contendeda few hundred years before the birth of Christ that the atom was as far asmatter could be split while retaining its essential character. Atoms of salt, hesaid, are sharp; atoms of water are smooth; atoms of iron are solid and strong.For millennia, though, the existence of the atom was just speculation. Only inthe twentieth century did scientists — led, as it happens, by Einstein — reachconsensus that they do indeed exist.Atoms, we now know, are the bricks of our physical environment. They vary insize and have various different properties. There are atoms in the air youbreathe. They flow in rivers and make up the oceans. Your body is built fromthem. However, they are not indivisible. Atoms, too, can be broken down, intothe particles that we call electrons, protons, and neutrons. And all of theseparticles — isolated atoms included — can behave strangely, in ways that you andI cannot.Somewhat surprisingly, we have the alchemists to thank for the eventualemergence of the quantum rules that govern atoms and subatomic particles. It wasthey who became obsessed by light being the ‘great primary cause’, as thenineteenth-century scientist Robert Hunt puts it in his 1854 book, Researches OnLight.Hunt traces the science back to Benvenuto Cellini, one of Jerome’scontemporaries. Cellini was a celebrated goldsmith and jeweller — much of hiswork commissioned by popes and nobles — an ‘eccentric and extraordinary genius’,Hunt claims. His contemporaries might have been less kind. Cellini wasundoubtedly a gifted craftsman, but ‘eccentric’ would have to cover variouscharges of sodomy (brought against him by men and women whom he had used in whatwas known as ‘the Italian fashion’), and murder, and several hefty fines andprison sentences for his misdemeanours.Cellini’s Treatise on Jewellery, published two years before Jerome’s arrest,contains a passage discussing observations of a ‘carbuncle glowing like a coalwith its own light’. When held up to the lamp, and then put in a darkened room,this stone would light the room.The publication caused quite a stir among the alchemists and they soon got towork seeking out, and creating for themselves, more and more materials thatwould ‘phosphoresce’, emitting their own light. A Bolognese shoemaker calledVincenzo Cascariolo made the biggest breakthrough: his alchemical experimentsculminated in the synthesis of the first artificial phosphorescent material.Cascariolo managed to roast sulphur-rich barium sulphate for long enough tocreate a golden glowing mineral.Eventually (and much more slowly than most like to think) the alchemiststhemselves transmuted into scientists, who began to investigate the propertiesof materials for their own sake, rather than in the pursuit of riches or theElixir of Life. As Hunt put it, ‘the hypothesis of the Alchymist has beenconverted into a probable theory by the discoveries of the modern chemist.’Now the names become a little more familiar. Robert Boyle and David Brewster,for example, entered the fray, as did Newton, an alchemist through and throughwho wondered aloud whether solid bodies and light are interconvertible, andwhether light is the source of the ‘activity’ of solid bodies. Eventually, itwas realised that this light — all light — is a manifestation of energy. We knowthis energy as radiation and have more modern scientists such as Marie Curie tothank for these discoveries and their applications.Radiation is not just light, though. There also exists invisible radiation, asHenri Becquerel discovered through his investigations of uranium salts. As thenineteenth century turned into the twentieth, we discovered a range of energeticparticles that come from the component parts of atoms. Experiments showed thatthe atoms within these stones and metals break apart spontaneously, forming intodifferent kinds of atoms and emitting energetic radiation. And as a result ofexamining this radiation very closely and precisely, we learned something veryodd.Have you ever seen an iron horseshoe in a blacksmith’s fire? If so, you willknow that, left in the heat, it glows red, then orange, then eventually white.This radiation comes from the individual atoms, with each one giving out a tinybit of light that adds to the glow. The white glow is a composition of lots ofdifferent colours, just as you can obtain different colours from mixingdifferent coloured dyes. Cellini, as a jeweller, would have seen the rainbow ofcolours projected onto a nearby wall when white light hits a diamond (aphenomenon, as it happens, that Jerome once discussed with King Edward VI ofEngland). The process in the blacksmith’s forge is, essentially, the reverse:all the colours united together as the heat takes hold.As the twentieth century dawned, observations through spectrometers showedexactly how much of each colour of light an object like a white-hot horseshoewould give out. Scientists set themselves to explaining this distribution ofenergy in terms of the atoms’ behaviour. It proved remarkably difficult. In theend, they only managed to solve it using the same technique that brings successin dice games: probability.Imagine you need to roll a twelve, with two dice, and your opponent needs toroll an eight. You know there is only one roll that allows you to win: twosixes. But your opponent can win with any of five rolls: two fours, or a two anda six, or a three and a five on either of the dice. He is therefore five timesas likely to win as you.Max Planck, a German physicist working at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität inBerlin, did the same calculation with atoms. If you have ten atoms together, asif they were ten dice, certain colours of radiation are more common. That,Planck surmised, is because more combinations of those atoms’ activity lead tothose particular colours. Some colours are almost never emitted, much as a sixtyis almost never achieved by throwing ten dice.To match the observations of the colours emitted by hot objects, Planck dividedup the energy of atoms into discrete amounts as if each ‘quantum’ of energy wasa dot on a die. So there is nothing between 1 and 2 lumps of energy, just asthere is nothing between 1 and 2 on a die. He then laid out the probability ofthe various possible quantum changes in energy. He didn’t accept straight awaythat that was how atoms really were. He just wanted to see if it worked.To Planck’s surprise (and distaste, it has to be said) it did, and he discovereda peculiar relationship. According to the wave theory of light, we can quantifyits colour in terms of ‘frequency’ (f). Imagine it coming towards you as asequence of up and down oscillations: the frequency is the number of peaks inthe wave that reach your eyes every second. Blue light has more peaks per secondthan red light; green is somewhere in the middle. Blue is therefore a higherfrequency of visible light. Violet — and ultraviolet — is higher still.Planck divided the amount of energy (E) in a ‘quantum’ packet of light (adoptinga term already in use for other small packets of material) by its frequency (f).When he did so, he would always obtain the same number. We now know that numberas Planck’s constant. It is usually written as h, and E equals h times f.Planck’s extraordinary observation — that radiation must exist as indivisiblequanta whose energy is related to the properties of its waves — was the start of‘quantum mechanics’. This theory, which has taken over science as our ultimateexplanation of how the universe works, splits every observable quantity — notjust energy, but momentum, position, and so on — into indivisible, separableamounts, like the dots on a die.Why? The answer is both simple and utterly confounding. It does so for no betterreason than it fits the observations of what happens when you throw a horseshoeinto the fire."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4It is 1525. The thirty-one-year-old William Tyndale is putting the finishingtouches on his English translation of the New Testament, a book that willoutrage and excite the population of Europe in equal measure. Jerome, justtwenty-four, is more prolific. He already has two books under his belt. Inaddition to his manual on winning games of chance, he has written a volume aboutthe failings of the medical establishment. He calls it On the Differing Opinionsof Physicians, though it will later be published under a more inflammatorytitle. In its pages, Jerome has exposed the fact that doctors are using entirelysubjective means — whims, mostly — to diagnose illnesses and prescribe cures.Neither of Jerome’s books are yet published, however, and if he wants topractise medicine he needs to keep it that way. The path to becoming a doctorhas been difficult enough already. When he first attended the university, Jeromediscovered himself to be a quick student and completed his Bachelor of Arts — anessential precursor to a medical degree — with ease. He took the examination forhis medical conversion after just three terms of tutoring; most students needednine. His insights into the profession were sharp enough that he had written Onthe Differing Opinions of Physicians even before his conversion course. Now, in1525, the doctors here in Milan don’t yet know about the book. Nonetheless, theywill be keen to exclude him from their number.Jerome is almost resigned to his fate. He has already experienced a hard time athis own university, despite everyone there knowing that his medical skills andunderstanding were beyond question. Thanks to an outbreak of plague, the Paviafaculty had decamped some two hundred miles to the east, to Padua. It was there,in the Great Hall of the University of Padua, that Jerome faced his final hurdlebefore qualification. This rigorous questioning and debate was a public event,with great potential for humiliation. However, Jerome’s defence of his medicallicence was so sublime that the faculty gave him a standing ovation. It was onlywhen he withdrew from the Hall, so that the faculty could vote on his inclusion,that the knives came out.The ballot was returned at forty-seven to nine against him and he was denied theright to practice medicine. He was outraged. ‘No doubt the disgrace attaching tomy bastardy, the odium of my attendance so frequently in places where dice andcards were the idols, and my rudeness in dispute, were more than these sages ofthe faculty could digest,’ he fumed.Jerome clearly appealed because two more ballots of the Faculty weresubsequently taken. On the third, he finally won and was sent out from themedical school with the words, ‘Go, and heal those who need you.’The very next morning, sick of the prejudices of Pavia, he sets out to ride thetwo hundred miles to Milan. The journey is hard and Jerome is in the darkest ofmoods, consumed by a growing depression. Despite his triumphant graduation, hisacademic achievements cannot counter a self-loathing bred of an addiction topornography, varied success in his sexual encounters with male and femalelovers, and a gnawing problem with impotence. He is convinced he will nevermarry. The five-day journey through the foothills of the Alps sees him sink intodespair. He is dogged by thoughts of suicide, a means to ‘vanquish all ills forever, and life with them’. And all this before his arrival in a city that willreject him out of hand.Here is Jerome’s problem, in a nutshell: his Pavia licence is not enough. Inorder to practise as a physician in his home city of Milan, the Milanese Collegeof Physicians must also grant Jerome a licence. So on arrival he goes — thebiretta of a physician on his head and the ring of his profession on his finger— to present himself to the College. There, he hands over letters ofintroduction from the faculty at Padua. When the Milanese faculty discuss hisapplication, one of the higher-minded academics points out that the Collegestatutes require that all members must be born within holy marriage. The rulehad been flouted before, but it would not be flouted now. Jerome’s applicationis refused.ψ‘What did you do?’Jerome is reclining on the straw mattress. I am sitting on the stool behind hisdesk. A rat scurries across the corner of the cell.I dread his answer. Jerome has a penchant for the dramatic, especially wheredespair is involved. In On Subtlety he writes that the darker things in lifealways outdo the lighter moments. ‘We come to grief and are disabled in an hour— indeed in a moment,’ he says. ‘To get enriched, to be healed, takes a longtime. A vast evil arrives by chance, in a word; we are hardly kept safe by manyfriends and by their assistance. To sum up: so many calamities, griefs, pain,disease, dishonour, unrequited love, fear, poverty — and just one single goodthing: not to be in need.’ He goes on: ‘What pleasure can be matched inmagnitude to torture, what hope to fear, what happiness to bereavement, whatagreeableness to imprisonment, what health to disease, or what wealth to theburdens of poverty, what honour to contempt or derision? Finally, there is thatnotorious last of all things, death, and even the joys of a thousand livescannot be compared to its contemplation.’ He is not a man easily inclined tohappiness.‘I walked out of there without saying a word,’ he says.Dawn is coming and the light from the window casts a shadow of his beaky profileon the wall behind his bed. ‘I went back to a room my mother had set aside forme in her house and lay down on the bed in black despair.’ He turns his head sothat he can look at me. ‘Much as I am lying here now.’You see my point?ψAs if things weren’t miserable enough, in Milan Jerome finds himself living in abrothel. Fazio is dead and his money and properties are tied up in legalwrangles. Chiara, in desperate need of an income, has set herself up as a madam.She is born to it and the house is busy — too busy for Jerome’s liking. No doubthe is reminded hourly of his impotence. He stays a few months, but is lookingfor an opportunity to get out. So when a doctor friend from Padua writes to tellhim of the lack of physicians in Sacco, a small town a few miles southeast ofPadua, he wastes no time. Anticipating a decent wage, he makes the journey anduses his scant resources, accumulated from gambling and tutoring, to buy himselfa small house. Contrary to his friend’s assurances, however, there is no medicalwork to be had in Sacco. Now aged thirty, Jerome is about to have his firstexperience of severe poverty. First, though, he is to fall in love.Jerome meets his future father-in-law, Aldobello Bandarini, before he meets hisfuture wife. Bandarini is hairy, dark-skinned, and rotund, with a personality tomatch his figure. An innkeeper, a businessman, and the captain of the Saccogarrison, he is a man of wealth, stature, and status. Bandarini also lives lifeboldly, hosting lavish and noisy parties, and standing drinks in his tavern.This is where the two men’s paths cross, with Jerome attempting to earn a crustthrough his gambling skills.Bandarini clearly likes Jerome. When he learns that the doctor’s insomnia makessleep impossible, Bandarini gives him licence to roam the town at night.Ordinary people would be challenged and perhaps arrested for nocturnalramblings, but Bandarini tells his guards to let Jerome wander where he likes.Then, thanks to a house fire that turfs the Bandarini family out from undertheir roof and into a rented property next door to Jerome, he provides abeautiful young wife. It is lust at first sight. Jerome claims he saw LuciaBandarini in a dream even before he set eyes on her in the flesh, and sheexcites something deep within him. According to his autobiography, the sight ofLucia Bandarini, his ‘new-found love’, immediately set him ‘free from the bondsof impotency’. The poor girl has no idea of the troubles coming her way.It almost didn’t happen because Jerome initially decides he is too poor tomarry. He dramatises the moment. ‘“Oh,” said I, “what have I to do with thismaiden? If I a pauper, marry a wife who has nothing save a troop of dependentbrothers and sisters, I’m done for! I can scarcely pay my expenses as it is!”’Astonishingly, he contemplates an abduction, or seduction, but in the end thereis no need. Her father is bewilderingly overjoyed at the match and offers Jeromenot only a huge dowry but financial support for the couple for as long as theyremain in Sacco.It is now February 1532. The forty-one-year-old King Henry VIII of England ismoving heaven and Earth, risking everything to be able to marry Anne Boleyn, thewoman with whom he has fallen head over heels in love. Jerome, a decade youngerthan Henry, has had love and his future security handed to him on a silverplatter, and he is moving heaven and Earth to make his own life as difficult aspossible. Jerome is too proud to accept Bandarini’s offer. He will marry Lucia,he says, but will not take a dowry and they will not live in Sacco. He will setout to make a proper living, and support his new wife himself.ψ‘Why?’ My stomach is tight, my jaw clenched.‘Why?’‘You could have been happy in Sacco. Lucia would have had her family and friendsaround her.’Jerome’s watery grey eyes narrow then soften. ‘I was young,’ he says. ‘Young andin love, and foolish, and proud, and full of optimism.’He is right. His writings make clear how wonderful and beautiful, how preciousLucia was to him. Which only makes his treatment of her all the more perplexing.‘You made her life so miserable.’‘Yes,’ he says. He stares down at the flagstone floor. ‘I know.’ψIt is one thing to choose poverty. It is entirely another thing to choose it foryour pregnant wife. Jerome and Bandarini argue endlessly about the dowry and theoffer of support, but the more educated man prevails in his stupidity. Thenewlyweds move to Milan, where the College of Physicians take great pleasure indenying him a licence for the second time. Chiara is happy and prosperous in herbrothel, but Jerome and Lucia are unable — or unwilling — to take advantage ofher earnings. Jerome describes the couple’s lodgings as ‘desolate’. He acceptsonly the minimum of his mother’s charity, just enough to keep them alive. Theirpoverty brings ill health and, for Lucia, miscarriage. Also miscarried areJerome’s plans to become a published author. He has developed his writings aboutprobability into a manuscript for the Book on Games of Chance. His book aboutthe failings of the medical profession remains unpublished. He has also writtena treatise on chiromancy, the study of portents read from hands. He offers themall around, but no one wants to publish them.In an attempt to earn some coins, Jerome puts on his cloak, raises its hood overhis face, and goes out into the night to practise medicine illegally. His onlyclients are poor and miserable themselves, and can pay little. He returns togambling to supplement this meagre income, but in his present state he is poorcompany and unable to find victims willing to put up with his moods andoutbursts. He goes — to all intents and purposes — mad. He has a permanentringing in his ears; he rants in the streets against the College of Physicians;and he moans to his few patients and pupils about his illnesses and misfortune.So appalling is his situation that he seeks solace in the supernatural. ‘Inthose days I was sickened so to the heart that I would visit diviners andwizards so that some solution might be found to my manifold troubles,’ hewrites. ‘Many of them advised me, as it might be that on certain days I shoulddrink only from cups that contained ochre, that on other certain days I shouldwalk only on the left side of the arcades and shield myself from the moon’srays, or that on waking I should sneeze three times and knock on wood.’All of this he does — and it doesn’t help. ‘Though I was at great pains tofollow these advices they availed me nothing.’ He looks at the stars and theplanets. He examines the lines in his hands. There is no relief from his fate.Destitute, weak, and tempestuous, Jerome decides that the Cardanos must move tothe countryside to subsist more cheaply. In April 1533, with Lucia pregnantagain, they leave Milan and head northwest to the small country town ofGallarate. Their possessions are tied to the backs of the only two mules Jeromecan afford to hire. He and his wife make the twenty-five mile journey on foot.It is too much for Lucia, and she suffers her second miscarriage.‘So,’ I say. ‘Your decision to refuse your father-in-law’s generosity reducedyour beautiful young wife to a life of poverty, two failed pregnancies, and noprospect of a child. And how did Gallarate work out for you?’Jerome’s gaze is fixed on the window. ‘I gambled away my wife’s jewels and ourmarital bed.’‘And then?’‘And then, when all else failed, I became a writer.’ He raises himself up on oneelbow, turning to face me. He says, with one eyebrow raised, ‘Worse. A sciencewriter.’This is the moment when I understand that Jerome is starting to know me.Somewhere in Gallarate, almost certainly in an inn and within the fellowship ofthe dice, Jerome has met a local nobleman. Filippo Archinto — not yet theGovernor of Rome to whom Jerome will dedicate his second book on astrology — isintelligent and curious, a lover of life. People instinctively like and trusthim, and he does not abuse their trust; he is known to be kind, as well as goodcompany. Perhaps it was Archinto who won Lucia’s jewels and maybe the bed. Hecertainly feels some kind of obligation towards the destitute couple: learningthat they have nowhere to live, he allows them to use a suite of rooms in hissummer house.Archinto does more than just put a roof over the Cardanos’ heads: he alsocreates a job for Jerome. There is no medical practice to be had, and the townis too small for Jerome’s skill at calculating odds to serve him for long; oncea few have lost money, word quickly gets around and opponents vanish like mistin spring sunshine. Archinto is impressed by Jerome’s intellect, though. He hasacademic pretensions himself, which he channels into work as an amateurastronomer. Although he can make observations, he finds himself unable to writethem down in a coherent manner. Jerome, he realises, can turn his thoughts intodancing prose that will impress the scholars of Europe.And it does. To Archinto, Jerome is a ‘genius’. He has, Archinto writes in hisletters, ‘dwelt upon the secrets of the skies’; he ‘knows of numbers as much asany man; delights in music and performs it with grace; can spend upon philosophygreat argument; and in the little time when he might be idle puts down notationsand sketches of many ingenious engines and toys’. It is all true — but none ofthat pays. Not like ghost writing for Archinto pays. Constructing Archinto’sbook, Judgements of the Astronomers, keeps Jerome and Lucia alive with housingand a small income.These are happy days. Chiara takes time off from the brothel and comes to visit.She finds her son and daughter-in-law in good health and good spirits. Optimismfills the air and Chiara writes back to Milan that Jerome is about to becomefamous. ‘I am certain,’ she says.She is wrong. Out of nowhere, in the middle of one winter night, Archintodisappears. When the morning comes, Jerome looks for him, hoping to pick up thediscussion on writing that they were enjoying last night. Archinto is nowhere tobe found. After a couple of hours, Archinto’s lawyer arrives and tells Jeromewhat has happened. A messenger came during the night with a sealed command fromthe Holy League. Barbarossa, Grand Admiral of the Ottoman fleet, has attackedthe coast of southern Italy. Archinto has been conscripted to fight for thePope’s army, with orders to leave immediately. He is obedient and faithful; hehas gone. For Jerome and Lucia, it is a disaster.The lawyer quickly makes his way to the summer house. Everything is to be closedup during the owner’s absence, he says. Since his client left no instructionsabout the Cardanos, they are to leave immediately.Once again, the Cardanos are homeless. Once again, Lucia is pregnant."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5It is 1534. England is recovering from its disappointment at the birth of adaughter, Princess Elizabeth, to King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Lucia Cardano,though, will be happy with any living child, whatever its sex. This time she islucky. Despite the circumstances, her third pregnancy progresses withoutincident.Jerome and Lucia are now living in a rented hovel in Gallarate. They grow a fewvegetables and forage for food in the countryside. The mathematician is gamblingagain, though without much success. Yet Jerome is optimistic — perhaps insanelyso. ‘I hear continual voices and dream visions promising fame,’ he announces tohis mother in a letter. He is even welcoming the prospect of an extra mouth tofeed, convinced that the third time is the charm. ‘The trinity of Lucia’spregnancies will be fruitful, for there is a sacred quality in this number,’ hetells Chiara.Ten days later, on Thursday 14 May, he is proved right — though not without ascare. The birth itself is uneventful, but shortly afterwards Lucia begins tohaemorrhage. Finally, Jerome gets to practice some worthwhile medicine: he saveshis wife by administering a coagulant. The baby is a boy, a weak, mewling infantwith ‘small, white, restless eyes’ as Jerome recalls. The child is deaf in hisright ear and has a curved spine. The third and fourth toes of his left foot arewebbed together. Hindsight grants Jerome more perspective than he was capable ofat the time. ‘Had I known then of the wickedness that was to seize the boy andthe evil that he was to cast upon other people,’ he writes later, ‘I might in myanguish have been tempted to cast him aside and let him pule in vain.’Of course they don’t cast the baby aside. Given the child’s weakness, however,they resolve to baptise him sooner rather than later. Facially, he lookssomething like his paternal grandfather and Jerome is tempted by the name Fazio.Lucia objects and prevails. After some argument, on a warm, sunny Sunday, he isanointed Giovanni Battista.The baptism takes place in Lucia’s bedchamber, but it does not go well. Thescene could have inspired the Brothers Grimm to concoct the story of SleepingBeauty: at the last minute, just as the newly named child is lifted from thefont, an unwelcome visitor arrives.‘Suddenly a great wasp flew into the room, though it was by no means the seasonfor wasps, and circled angrily around the child,’ Jerome recalls in hisautobiography. ‘We beat it away in fear that it would harm him with its poison,and it flew angrily against the wall and for some moments continued a resoundingnoise like a drum. The creature disappeared as suddenly as it had come, no oneseeing its departure although all eyes were upon it.’Jerome is left shaken and fearful. ‘I was filled with horror by the menacingpremonition that a spell was cast upon my son by an evil insect, and that thoughits sting had not afflicted him it had through the powers of darkness poisonedhis spirit.’Later in life, Jerome was to advise that the real power of curses lies in theaccursed person’s self-sabotage. ‘It is of use to withhold belief,’ he writes inOn Subtlety. Now, though, the curse takes hold. While Lucia is still recoveringfrom the haemorrhage, Jerome falls ill. He suffers a high fever and ‘agues andvomitings’. He is so weak that he is unable to work for a month and thehousehold falls into penury. His solution is as stubborn as the mules thatbrought them to Gallarate: they will move back to Milan.It is late August 1534. Poverty mandates that they have no mules this time, justa flat trolley laden with books that Jerome pulls behind him. Lucia carries herbaby. For the three days and nights of the journey, they beg for food and sleepin fields.On arrival in Milan, they are unable to find anywhere to live — Jerome’s mother,it seems, is no longer a resident. For four weeks, Jerome, Lucia, and Giovannispend their days and nights on the streets. They are still begging for theirfood; now, in the city, they are considered vagrants, and are frequently abusedand spat upon by passers-by. Jerome’s obstinate, self-aggrandising decisionshave reduced the beautiful, radiant Lucia to a life of utter misery and shame.In October, as the temperature begins to drop, Jerome gives up the attempt toprovide for his family through begging and applies for them to enter theworkhouse. His application is successful and, from October until the end ofDecember, Jerome and Lucia perform menial tasks in exchange for shelter andmeagre rations of food. Then, as the year draws to a close, a fellow recipientof workhouse charity pulls Jerome into a dark corner and whispers in his ear.The man is old, decrepit, and clothed in rags. ‘You are cursed,’ he tells theastonished Jerome. ‘If you want, I can help.’The old man, it turns out, is a wizard.ψJerome won’t say whether he consulted his wife. Nor will he be drawn on theissue of why a decent wizard should be so down on his luck as to be living inthe workhouse. He avoids dwelling on the legalities of the activity; performingspells is not an uncommon practise, but it is witchcraft and the church isoperating a zero-tolerance policy on magic these days: witches and wizards areburned at the stake if caught. Nonetheless, Jerome, ever prone to going with hisgut, always game for a new experience, and still convinced that a bright futurelies just around the next corner, agrees to let the old man help.The wizard’s prescriptions are many and various. The first task is to rid Jeromeof the demon that has taken possession of the good doctor. A daemonifuge herbperforms its purgative functions, then the wizard pummels Jerome with stones togrind the bones of the devil within. The ringing in Jerome’s ears, the wizardtells him, is the screams of that devil. ‘From that time forth I neverexperienced that ringing again,’ Jerome wrote in On Wisdom.Now things take an even stranger turn. The wizard knows of a stagnant pool, notfar from the workhouse. It will, he says, provide the perfect stage for the nextpart of the exorcism.They venture to the pool on a night when the full moon is reflected in the deadcentre of the water. ‘Toads leapt upon its edge and the plants and weeds on itssurface were of a glutinous kind with slime,’ Jerome recalls. On the wizard’sinstruction, Jerome puts his head into the water exactly where the moon’sreflection is sat and keeps it immersed while the wizard utters an incantation.He can hear only a murmur of the wizard’s voice, but the words, he says, causethe vapours of his curse to be ‘drawn upward to the atmosphere of that nearestand most benign of the planets.’I think he means the moon. Anyway, the incantation is done and Jerome must nowdry his head upon unfouled straw and give the wizard a pouch of powdered alicorn— that is, powdered unicorn horn. He will not say how he came by the means topurchase this, but he clearly considers it a worthwhile investment. ‘From thattime forward, this strange necromancer told me, I should fare famously. And Ihave no cause to declare him false.’Nor we. Within a few weeks, Jerome is on the way up. A sceptic would argue thatit is pure coincidence that Filippo Archinto happens to return just now from theHoly War. The fact is, Archinto is shocked to learn — from a letter written bythe wretched Lucia — that his friend is living in the workhouse. He immediatelytravels to Milan and provides Jerome and his family with lodgings in the city.What’s more, he nominates his ‘genius’ friend for a new position as a publiclecturer on geometry, astronomy, and arithmetic.The post has been created in the will of a philanthropic resident of Milancalled Thomas Plat, who left a small legacy as a salary. Archinto’s socialstatus is on the rise, thanks to his noble birth and service to the church, andhe uses his growing influence to secure Jerome the job. The prestige of theposition — and the fact that Jerome cannily makes his lectures more popular byreplacing the more boring parts of geometry with geography, and arithmetic witharchitecture — opens up work as a tutor. In 1535, Jerome earns fifty crowns,which provides his household with enough money for a mule, two servants, and anurse for the baby. His mother comes to live with them, bringing extra incomefrom her brothel. A year after leaving the workhouse, the Cardanos are respectedmembers of Milanese society. So respected, in fact, that Jerome decides to haveanother shot at obtaining a medical licence from the College of Physicians.He fails. There are some strings that even Archinto can’t pull.‘And so you decided to get your revenge by publishing Bad Medicine?’‘My book was called On the Differing Opinions of Physicians,’ Jerome says. Thesmile playing on his lips betrays his acceptance of my appraisal — yes, revenge,in part. ‘I was practising in secret, treating a whole host of patients who toldme that the College’s physicians had done nothing for them,’ he says. ‘It seemedto me that these people deserved to know how little we doctors agreed on thebest way to treat a patient.’‘Ah,’ I say. ‘So it was a noble gesture. Not revenge?’ I smile. ‘Not even alittle bit?’Jerome lies back down on the straw, his face lost in the dark again. ‘Maybe alittle,’ he mutters into the gloom. ‘But I had so little to lose, and as itturned out, so much to gain.’ψIt can’t have hurt that Jerome’s oldest friend from university had inherited aprintworks. Ottaviano Scoto owed him a favour too: years ago, when they wereboth students in Pavia, Jerome had loaned him some essays. Scoto, a pale youngman burdened by a sense that he was Jerome’s intellectual inferior, hadcompounded his feelings of inadequacy by losing the pages. Now that Scoto is theowner of a printing press, Jerome thinks it might be time to call in the debt.The response he receives overwhelms him with joy. Scoto’s reverence for Jerome’sintellectual abilities is still in full bloom: he can’t believe that Jerome’swritings have yet to be published. He volunteers for the honour and privilege —and is happy to do so unpaid. ‘Joyfully he said that he would take all the riskof publication,’ Jerome says, ‘and that even if he were to lose by it, it wouldbe small cost for the privilege of being the first to put Doctor Cardano intothe vision of the public.’And that is how On The Differing Opinions of Physicians came to publicattention. With a publisher’s eye for profitable controversy, Scoto puts it outas On The Bad Practice of Medicine in Common Use. It is an immediate hit and theMilanese College of Physicians is furious. Doctors, according to Jerome’s text,are apt to prescribe unnecessary medicines and to bleed and starve patients totheir detriment. He discusses ‘the tribal insecurities of men who bandedthemselves together and showed to the world a surface of pomp and learning thatsatisfactorily concealed from the beholders the depth of ignorance beneath.’A vicious, but entirely predictable, backlash hits Jerome with full force. Thefaculty broadcasts the fact that Jerome has no practice at all, and is thereforein no position to criticise. This book, they say, will put patients’ lives indanger. He is nothing more than a lecturer on arithmetic, with a famous grudgeagainst the College. What’s more, they point out, the text is almostincomprehensible.In this last point, at least, they are right. In his hurry to publish, Scoto hasfailed to perform any proofreading. There are more than three hundred misprintsand typographical errors. ‘I reaped nothing but shame,’ Jerome said later. ‘Thebook damaged me in every respect save one: it sold in great quantities … Myfriend Scoto rejoiced, but I grieved.’In the end, he needn’t have worried, for he is about to become a recognised andfully employed doctor, even without the College’s approval. To the faculty’sastonishment and outrage, Jerome has received a job offer: would he like tobecome official physician to the city’s Augustinian friars?Once again, the hand of Filippo Archinto is deeply involved. Francisco Gaddi,the city’s Augustinian prior, has been ill for two and a half years with a skindisease — almost certainly a type of leprosy — that none of the city’s doctorscan cure. After two years, depressed and burdened by a morose fascination withdeath, Gaddi asks his friend Archinto’s opinion. You must, Archinto says, callfor my friend Jerome.And so he does. Quickly realising that the city’s doctors have tried everypharmaceutical available, Jerome quizzes the prior at length about his diet androutine. Shocked at the self-neglect of the spiritual life, he prescribes somepampering. Mortification of the flesh is out: no more sackcloth; no moreproscription of soap and water so that the outer dirt mirrored the inner man; nomore fasting and sleep deprivation. Gaddi was to sleep well and eat well,denying himself neither fish nor wine.Now, six months later, Gaddi is a changed man, in rude health and grateful forit. And Jerome has a smile on his own face. All those nights shuffling throughthe streets of Milan in cloak and cowl, working for the recompense of coppersand owed favours, risking criminal charges if he were to be caught practisingillegally — they have not been in vain. Justice is finally paying her debt. Heaccepts the job at the priory gleefully; he does not need the permission of theMilanese College of Physicians to practise there. Though the position is notwell paid, it is a long overdue poke in the eye for the College physicians. InJerome’s eyes, that is payment enough.ψ‘So you came good,’ I suggest to Jerome with a smile. ‘You put Lucia andGiovanni in a decent home, finally published a book, and became a respectedmember of Milanese society. And you made the first recorded prescription of aspa treatment.’Jerome sits up. He looks unimpressed. ‘A lot of good it did Gaddi. He died insome prince’s dungeon ten years later,’ he says. ‘How do you cure a man whosechief ailment is a tendency to make enemies of the whole world?’ He pronouncesthe question loudly, like an actor on a stage. Then he hesitates, and looksaround his cell. His demeanour collapses, as if he has suddenly realised his endmight be no better. ‘I should have seen the signs,’ he says. ‘There must havebeen signs.’‘You don’t believe in signs.’Jerome looks at me as if I have gone mad. ‘There are always signs,’ he says.‘You just have to know where to look.’‘Do you know this sign?’ I ask. I get to my feet and scrawl on the rough cellwall using a small pebble. My sign looks like a three-candled menorah; the Greekletter psi. Jerome stares at it, one eyebrow raised in curiosity.ψ‘I do,’ he says. He pauses, and points at my drawing. ‘What does it mean to you?Is it part of your magic?’I throw down the pebble and laugh. ‘You could say that.’Psi — Ψ — means everything to a quantum physicist. It is the symbol assigned tothe full mathematical description of an object. That object might be a universe,or an electron. No one knows if psi is a real thing, with physical propertiesthat you can measure in experiments, or just a mathematical summary. It is knownas the wave function.Remember Planck’s frequency, f, which describes the colour of light emitted by ahot horseshoe? That’s actually a measure of how fast a back-and-forth orup-and-down oscillation occurs, and it is related to the wavelength of thelight. Imagine a child on a rope swing. If the rope is long, it swings back andforth slowly. A short length of rope creates a fast oscillation. Waves are thesame. Long wavelength gives low frequency; short wavelength gives highfrequency. This wave idea is how an Englishman, a Frenchman, an Austrian, and aDane arrived at the theory that gave birth to psi.First, the Englishman. This is Ernest Rutherford, who in 1908 instructed hisstudents to fire radiation at thin sheets of gold to see how the radiation wouldbe affected by the gold atoms. The way the radiation was deflected showedRutherford that almost all the mass of an atom is concentrated in a tiny regionat its centre. This is what we call the nucleus and it carries a positiveelectrical charge. In a much bigger space around the nucleus — if the nucleuswere the size of a fly, the atom would extend to the size of a cathedral — thereis a balancing negative electrical charge: the electrons. Taken as a whole, theatom has no electrical charge.Enter the Dane, Niels Bohr. In 1913, he suggested that, following the model ofthe planets going round the sun, the electrons existed in particular orbitsaround the nucleus. When they gained energy — as when an iron horseshoe is putinto the fire — they moved out to orbits that were more distant from thenucleus. Eventually, they would fall back to their original orbits, giving theextra energy back as emitted radiation: that is, light.Bohr came up with a formula that would explain why the light energy only took oncertain values — Planck’s discrete, quantum values — and nothing in between. Theelectron orbits, he suggested, must exist at particular distances from thenucleus, with no available orbits in between them. That would mean the electronshad to make jumps involving a particular amount of energy, which corresponded toPlanck’s quanta.Now we come to a quick cameo by the Austrian: a patent examiner called AlbertEinstein. He showed in his special theory of relativity, published in 1905, thatthere is a speed limit to the universe. The mathematics describing how radiationis emitted by objects only makes sense if nothing can move faster than the speedwhich we now call the speed of light.So here comes our final player: a French prince called Louis de Broglie (it ispronounced ‘de Broy’). De Broglie was a graduate in medieval history, as ithappens, but also a keen student of the new physics. He was the genius whosuggested in 1924 that Bohr’s electron orbit, Planck’s frequency (and itscorresponding wavelength), and Einstein’s universal speed limit work together toexplain the origins of quantum theory.An electron orbiting a nucleus, he said, could be thought of as a wave thattravels round in a circle. For the atom to be stable, the distance it travels inthat circular orbit must correspond to a certain number of complete waves, or‘wavelengths’. That would make the wave perfectly smooth and continuous, with nougly jumps as the circle is completed.That is only possible if the orbits are at particular distances from thenucleus. Imagine the electron is at a distance from the nucleus where itscircular orbit allows it to complete, say, two whole waves in a trip round thenucleus. Now move the electron out, radially away from the nucleus. Eventuallyyou will reach a point where the circular orbit would be able to fit threecomplete waves. In between those two positions, de Broglie said, is forbiddenground.De Broglie worked out the mathematics and showed that we can indeed treat theelectron as either a wave, or a particle. The numbers all add up. That means youcan talk about its energy, or you can talk about its frequency and wavelength.Either is fine; both are correct.All of that works fine without Einstein’s input, in fact. But to make everythingwork, de Broglie’s electron waves travelled too fast: their speed exceeded thespeed of light. That was forbidden by Einstein’s relativity. To get round this,de Broglie reasoned that there must be a component of these waves thatrepresents something outside the physical universe ruled by Einstein’s speedlimit.‘Ah,’ says Jerome, ‘It lives in the aevum.’I should have seen that coming. During the course of his lifetime, Jerome gave agreat deal of thought to time and space, and our place within it. He eventuallyconcocted his own theory concerning the geometry and topology of the universe,which suggests a new, inaccessible dimension.He called it aevum.Aevum is the place where intelligences dwell — where information resides,effectively. It has a temporal dimension: it is eternity, and is ‘analagous tothe centre of the sphere,’ Jerome says in On Subtlety. ‘The centre correspondsto every point of the circumference and remains stationary as the sphererotates. In this way, eternity remains fixed within the infinity of time. Itdoes not expand, it does not flow, it is always at rest.’ Our visible cosmosresides within this aevum. ‘The universe, apparently at rest, is containedwithin eternity, and within the universe time flows.’‘Am I right?’ Jerome is beaming, clearly pleased with himself.‘Honestly,’ I say. ‘I don’t understand your aevum. And I don’t really understandthe consequences of de Broglie’s work properly, either.’The part of de Broglie’s wave that exists outside of our physical universe isfound within its ‘phase’. Phase is an abstract concept that has long beenassociated with waves, or anything that performs a repeated motion. It is oftenused to compare the state of two or more systems: two swimmers could bedescribed as ‘in phase’ if their arm movements are synchronised. Put twograndfather clocks next to each other, and the motions of their pendula are ‘inphase’ if they move to left and right at the same time and ‘out of phase’ iftheir movements are always in opposing directions. In a single system, such as atravelling wave, the phase is a quality that describes the stage of the wave:the peaks and troughs of an ocean wave, for example. Quantifying it, we say thephase describes the proportion of each oscillation that has passed.But de Broglie’s genius was to make phase into something physical, a quality inits own right, and locate it outside of our normal physical reality. An electronhas a mass and a velocity, say, and it has a phase. No one knew what it meant,exactly, but it made the mathematics work. The numbers added up.Thanks to de Broglie, we finally had a convincing explanation for the glow ofradiation from a hot horseshoe: quanta of radiation whose properties wereultimately determined by a phase that transcends the physical universe. That,however, may have been the last fully convincing moment in quantum theory.ψ‘And the phase is psi?’ Jerome has hardly batted an eyelid. He looked confusedby the concept of electrical charge and raised an eyebrow at the mention of theplanets going round the sun. Aside from his interjection about the aevum,however, the rest was absorbed without murmur. I can’t tell if he understood it.‘No. The phase is just one component of psi.’ I hesitate. ‘There’s another partto this whole thing. Do you remember the numbers you discovered as a solution tothe cubic equation? The square roots of negative numbers?’He scowls. ‘Ah, the impossible quantities,’ he says. ‘What useless sophistry.’I smile. ‘Not useless at all. When I learned about them at school, they werecalled imaginary numbers, but they’re not imaginary and they are certainly notuseless. They make up an essential part of the quantum phase.’‘They are taught to children?’ Jerome looks sceptical.‘Yes. Although they are largely unwelcome in young minds. Children always askwhat the point of them is, if they’re imaginary. The point is, they aren’timaginary. It’s just a bad label. They are used in all kinds of ways.’ I walkover to the wall, pick up a pebble and scratch an i onto the wall. ‘When you putyour imaginary numbers together with your work on chance, you can derive quantumtheory. And that can explain how everything in the universe works.’ I turn backfrom the wall, expecting to find him looking triumphant, or at least pleased. Ihave forgotten, just for a moment, that this is a man who will find a fly inevery ointment.‘Can it explain why I was arrested?’ he says, lowering himself onto themattress. ‘Can it explain on what charges I am being held here?’The sceptical question, the refusal to celebrate his achievement, draws the airout from within me in a deep sigh. I sit down on the straw beside him.‘You don’t need imaginary numbers or probability to explain that,’ I say.‘Although they both played their part, as I understand it. Mostly, though, yourstay here’ — I wave a hand at the cell — ‘is the work of Nicolo Tartaglia.’"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 61535, the year Jerome and his family leave the workhouse and begin to rise inMilanese society, is the year William Tyndale is arrested in Antwerp for heresy.All across Europe, religious disputes are boiling over. Sir Thomas More is soonto be executed for refusing to recognise King Henry VIII as head of the Churchof England. In Holland, the Anabaptists attempt to take control of Amsterdam —and fail. In Germany, they succeed, ruling the city of Münster for five months.Six French Protestants are burned in front of Notre Dame Cathedral fordistributing printed condemnations of the Catholic Church. They are only thethin end of the wedge, so King Francis I has decided to ban use of the printingpress.None of this bothers Nicolo Tartaglia, who is just trying to keep his head downand earn a living. It hasn’t been easy. Perhaps through circumstances, perhapsthrough bad luck, The Stammerer is not blessed with an amiable personality.Since growing up to become an intelligent, scholarly young man, he has beendriven out of his hometown of Brescia not once, but twice for being avaricious,morose, and, above all, rude to everybody.Biting his thumb at the Brescians, he has settled in Venice, where he writesdown ideas in his own crude version of the Venetian dialect. Though it is farfrom the erudite language of scholarship, these ideas are clever and innovativeenough to pass muster. A local nobleman has recognised his talent and helped himwith money to study at the University of Padua. Tartaglia has become a teacherof Euclid’s theorems. It is a solid enough career for any self-taught man andone that Tartaglia is pleased to call his own. No wonder, then, that he is soincensed when Antonio Maria Fior arrives in town, his eye firmly fixed onTartaglia’s hard-won job.Fior is an inferior mathematician with a superior mathematical lineage. Histeacher was a celebrated scholar, Scipio Ferreus, a professor at Bologna. Andhere Fior was in the right place at the right time. In 1505, Ferreus worked outa way to solve a particular type of equation known as a cubic. Cubic equationsare those that include x raised to the power of three. That is, x multiplied byx multiplied by x. A simple way to visualise it is as the volume of a cube,whose sides are of length x. The volume is its length multiplied by its breadthmultiplied by its height: x3. If x is two, say, the cubic power is 2 x 2 x 2 =8.In Jerome’s time, however, there is no mathematical notation, so all problemsare laid out in convoluted sentences such as ‘cubs p. 6. rebus aequalis 20’. Inmodern notation, we would write that as x3 + 6x = 20. This makes itsignificantly easier to solve. The idea is to find a numerical value for x, butat this point some cubic equations were thought to be impossible to solve.In 1494, the Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli had published a book, expansivelyillustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, in which he explained why there would never bea general solution to the cubic equation. Ferreus didn’t have a generalsolution, but he could solve an equation of the form x3 + bx = c. It was animpressive innovation, involving many complicated routines of substituting onevariable for another, and making a variety of assumptions that allow a solutionto emerge. However, it was still not the long-sought general solution. GiveFerreus something like 3x3 + 8x2 - 7x = 15 and he would be undone. A newsolution was necessary.To a medieval mathematician, a new solution to an equation is a precious thing.It is a stick with which to beat your enemies, a dagger by which to slay themand take their jobs. That’s because no one publishes their solutions then waitsfor their peers to give them acclaim. The modus operandi is to humiliate yourrivals by challenging them to mathematical duels.The public relish these occasions. This is Renaissance sport, featuringintellectual heavyweights sparring in the mathematical ring. It isn’t just aboutmathematics, either. In February 1498, for instance, Leonardo da Vinci joined apublic battle with various mathematicians, astronomers, astrologers, andphysicians. This was a contest designed to establish the pecking order of allthe arts and sciences. It’s not clear who won the battle, but the occasion didlead da Vinci to write that painting — because it is based on observation,mathematics, and geometry — should be considered a science. ‘No humaninvestigation may claim to be a true science,’ he says, ‘and if you would saythat those sciences which begin and end in the mind possess truth, this is notconceded, but denied for many reasons. The foremost [reason] is that such mentaldiscourses do not involve experience, and nothing renders certainty of itselfwithout experience.’Battles between mathematicians, though, bring entire populations to the citysquare. This is about more than who can make an argument for their intellectualsuperiority. Here, there are concrete problems to solve, points to score,answers that are definitively right, wrong, or unachievable. There is cheeringand catcalling, a referee, champions, and underdogs — all accompanied, ofcourse, by drinks and snacks. Once the contest is over, the winner takes all. Intheory, the loser is supposed to buy his conqueror a dinner for each of theunsolved problems. In reality, he often has to cede fame, money, and sometimeseven a job. No wonder Tartaglia is worried.A battle starts with the competitors giving each other thirty problems to solve.They must be able to solve their own puzzles, so anyone with a solution thatothers don’t have is at a distinct advantage — they can set problems that theirrival simply cannot figure out in the allotted time.It is not clear whether Ferreus ever used his solution to the cubic equation ina public mathematical battle. But he knew its value and only passed it forwardfrom his deathbed. The recipients were Fior, his pupil, and Ferreus’sson-in-law, Annibale della Nave. The son-in-law did nothing with it, but Fiorhad no qualms about putting his teacher’s skill to work.Fior was a lazy student and an unskilled mathematician. Ferreus’s solution washis only card and he knew it. For two decades, he guarded it jealously and usedit to great advantage in public duels. But then, in challenging Tartaglia, hepushed his luck too far. Fior wanted Tartaglia’s job and Tartaglia needed it tolive. So when Fior challenged The Stammerer to an algebraic duel, Tartaglia tookit as seriously as an assault on his life. What Fior didn’t know was thatTartaglia had already been working on cubic equations. Moreover, unlike Fior, hewas born to the task. In many ways, Fior’s rising fame had worked against him.Tartaglia had discussed Fior’s wielding of cubic equations with a Brescianschoolteacher called Zuanne da Coi, a tall, lean, hollow-eyed man, with astrange, slow gait. Da Coi had then encouraged Tartaglia to think about thepossible solutions and so he had — with some success. Tartaglia now possessed asolution for equations of the type x3 + ax2 = b, and x3 = ax2 + c.Following the usual protocol, Tartaglia and Fior exchanged problems two weeksprior to the duel. Tartaglia evidently knew — perhaps from da Coi — about Fior’sweak grasp of mathematics and exploited it by setting him a range ofmathematical tasks, including some that involved the new cubic solutions.Predictably, Fior’s problems were only of the type for which he alone had acast-iron schema that would generate solutions. The Stammerer took them to bedwith him and rattled the equations around in his mind. It worked. Almostcertainly because he had already worked out solutions to equations of a similarkind, Tartaglia worked out Ferreus’s method a full eight nights before thecontest was to take place. He then went on to work out the solution to yetanother form of the equation. By 13 February 1535, the night before the publicduel, Tartaglia knew he would win.Tartaglia was impressive. Fior’s face must have worn a look of pure horror when,in less than two hours, Tartaglia solved all the problems that had made Fior’sliving for the last thirty years. Fior, for his part, couldn’t solve any of theequations Tartaglia had set. There was a clear winner. Fior asked Tartaglia todemonstrate his methods, but The Stammerer walked away. He didn’t even claim histhirty dinners. For him, a burnished reputation was enough.ψ‘Tartaglia was good, wasn’t he?’The sun is almost up. Jerome’s skinny student, Rudolf Silvestri, has justdelivered a bowl of boiled vegetables, setting it down on the floor at my feet.When he stood up and seemed to look right through me, I took offence, until Iremembered that I am not sure whether I am actually, physically present. Jeromehas picked up the bowl and set it on the table. Now he is fixing it with anintense stare, as if it contains the secrets of the universe.‘Fior was hardly a great opponent,’ he says, eventually.I smirk at Jerome’s withering snark, but decide not to pursue the point. ‘So, atthis point, Tartaglia is riding high in mathematics and you are riding high inmedicine, thanks to the job at the Priory. What went wrong?’‘It wasn’t enough, I suppose,’ Jerome says into the bowl. He picks out a pieceof turnip and brings it to his lips. ‘I didn’t want to just cure the sick. Iwanted to move things forward — to understand.’‘Understand what?’‘Everything.’ He takes a bite of the turnip. It is soft and he barely chews itbefore swallowing. ‘Life. The cosmos. Everything. This is my calling, my onlytask.’In this regard, Jerome reminds me of Erwin Schrödinger, the most famous quantummechanic of them all. Schrödinger once said that to understand ourselves is theonly task of science.Fittingly, it is Jerome’s mathematical innovations that made Schrödinger’s workpossible.Remember the glowing horseshoe? The radiation comes from atoms of iron. Moreprecisely, it comes from an electron that surrounds the nucleus of those atoms.As the electron loses energy, it effectively falls between these differentorbits. The properties of that radiation are determined by the wave that fitsonto the orbit. But that wave is no ordinary wave: it is psi, the wave function.The wave function has a phase, which — as de Broglie pointed out — must existoutside of the pure physical reality of the time and space that we know. And theonly way to fully describe that phase is to use mathematics that involve theimaginary numbers, written as i.i is the square root of -1. I know I haven’t explained exactly what Jerome didto discover it yet (and that discovery is almost a decade away still), but trustme for now: the fact that Jerome did anything with such an oddity isextraordinary. In his day, negative numbers were themselves suspect. Peopleunderstood what it meant to have two apples. They did not understand (andperhaps we don’t, really) what minus two apples could possibly be. How, then, totake a square root of a negative number? After all, you know that the oppositeprocess — squaring a number — never gives a negative? We know that 2 x 2 = 4. Weknow that -2 x -2 = 4. We know that the square root of four is therefore two andminus two. But what is the square root of minus four?Where we call such solutions ‘imaginary’, Jerome termed them ‘sophistry’. If youcame across imaginary numbers at school, you probably hated them. Who knew theywere hated for centuries prior?If mathematical conundrums like this leave you floundering, you are in goodcompany. They left Jerome floundering, too. But he was the first to face up tothem. When the geometer Heron of Alexandria was working out the volume of atruncated pyramid in the first century AD, he found he had to deal with thesquare root of minus sixty-three. Heron just fudged his calculation, quietlydropping the negative number. In 250 AD, the Greek mathematician Diophantusderived a square root of a negative number in his calculations. He assumed hehad made a mistake. That was also Jerome’s first thought when he discovered hehad to deal with the square root of a negative number. But he checked, and therewas no mistake. He gave the notion a name: ‘impossible quantities’. And then hewent on to put them to use in solving fiendishly difficult equations. It was, hesaid, ‘impossible’ to find numbers that solved these equations, but there arecertain ‘objects’ — his ‘impossible quantities’ — that get the job done.Translators argue about the proper way to interpret Jerome’s Latin in thispassage of his 1545 book on the art of algebra and arithmetic. Some believe heregarded the imaginary numbers as ‘mental tortures’ that had to be ignoredbefore you could complete the calculation. Others infer that he was simplysaying that the ‘imaginary parts’ become lost in the process, making all thingswork out in the end. One translation contends that Jerome said this mathematicsis ‘truly sophisticated’, another that he thinks it ‘truly imaginary’. Stillothers have translated it as ‘truly sophistic’ — that is, something of anelegant fudge. And yet we see him demonstrating a difference between ‘purenegative’ numbers (minus two, for example) and ‘sophistic negative’ numbers,such as the square root of minus two:Note that √9 is either +3 or -3, for a plus [times a plus] or a minus times aminus yields a plus. Therefore, √-9 is neither +3 or 3 but is some reconditethird sort of thing.That ‘recondite third sort of thing’ is central to our very existence, as itturns out. It is not only used in engineering bridges, aeroplanes, and mobilephones (and truncated pyramids, of course), but it is central to the mostfundamental theory of physics. Without Jerome’s imaginary numbers we cannotexplain how the universe works or even the most basic processes of atomicphysics. It was Schrödinger, an Austrian, who worked that out over the Christmasholiday of 1925.Schrödinger is the Pablo Picasso of physics. He was a genius, who representedreality in a way that defied all previous conventions and was also unrepentantlyuninterested in living a ‘conventional’ life. Schrödinger’s lifestyle gave noquarter to the morals of his contemporaries and he left tragedy and a trail ofshocked bystanders in his wake. Early in his professional life he became mathstutor to a thirteen-year-old girl called Itha Junger. In his diaries he admitshe groomed Itha by writing her poems and engaging her in grown-up conversationsabout religion and science. Their maths lessons included petting, cuddling, andfondling her until she was seventeen, when he finally felt able to seduce her.Their secret relationship continued on and off for years. In 1932, she fellpregnant and sought an abortion because Schrödinger would not leave Anny, hiswife. The procedure went badly and left Itha unable to have children.Anny tolerated Schrödinger’s insistence that their relationship be ‘open’,commenting that ‘it would be easier to live with a canary than a racehorse, butI prefer the racehorse’. In 1934, Schrödinger took up a position at theUniversity of Oxford and brought both his wife and a new mistress, setting uptheir household in a ménage à trois that the Oxford dons could barely tolerate —especially as his mistress was pregnant.None of this detracts in any way from his genius — perhaps it even stimulatedit. He was certainly stimulated at Christmas 1925, when he left his wife behind,picked up a different mistress — this one’s identity remains unknown — and acopy of Louis de Broglie’s work, and went on a trip to the Swiss Alps.By the time he returned home, he had a world-changing equation that would winhim a Nobel Prize. We now call it the Schrödinger equation, and we write it likethis:[_images/equation.gif]I have filled in the gaps on the wall with my stone scrawl.Jerome shakes his head. ‘I don’t understand your notation,’ he says. Of coursehe doesn’t. The notation is a product of the centuries that are to follow.‘The h with a bar through it is Planck’s constant divided by two times pi. Twothings placed next to each other means multiply them together. d divided by dtmeans the rate of change of the thing it precedes.’‘H?’‘H is something called the Hamiltonian operator. It contains information aboutthe energy in the system and varies from system to system — you just plug itinto the formula.’‘Hamiltonian?’‘It’s named after a William Hamilton.’Jerome raises his eyebrows at the name. ‘The Archbishop?’ he says. There is hopein his voice.‘I’m afraid not. He was an Irish mathematician. Or he will be.’Jerome looks disappointed. ‘Perhaps a descendant, then?’‘Perhaps. William Hamilton had Scottish ancestors, I know that.’It seems enough to satisfy him. ‘And this Hamiltonian,’ he points a finger atthe wall. ‘What does it do?’Now there is a question.Schrödinger’s equation is a means to predict the physical properties of a system— not just an electron in an iron atom that might emit radiation, but anythingthat follows quantum laws. Because psi has a phase that exists outside of ourordinary three dimensions of space, we know that psi must itself inhabit anotherrealm, something like Jerome’s aevum. Physicists call it Hilbert space, afterDavid Hilbert, the mathematician who came up with the concept. Hilbert space hasan infinite number of dimensions. It is generally described as an ‘abstract’space, rather than a physical one, but there is an ongoing argument as towhether the wave function is physical or abstract. We’ll get to that. First wehave to deal with a slightly more accepted oddity associated with the wavefunction’s behaviour within Hilbert space: it relies on Jerome’s probabilitytheory.Physicists use the Schrödinger equation to make predictions of what to expectfrom quantum experiments and processes. Very early on, they realised that —although the equation officially depends on the wave function, which describesthe unfolding events — all we can actually do is work out the square of the wavefunction, Ψ2. The square of psi gives you a probability associated with anythingyou want to know. And the right choice of Hamiltonian operator, which depends onthe physical system you’re working with, tunes the equation to each particularthing.Understandably, Jerome looks confused. I don’t know if I can make it any easier.‘Psi squared is linked to the probability of the atom’s position, say. Youspecify a position, and it will tell you how likely you are to find it in thatposition if you carry out a measurement.’‘So it is like a bet?’‘Worse. It’s like a bet that depends on imaginary numbers.’‘And the equation won’t guarantee that you win?’‘All it will do is give you the odds of winning.’‘So the atom might be somewhere else when you look for it.’I take a deep breath. ‘It’s not somewhere else. It’s everywhere else. Andnowhere. Until you make a measurement.’I stare at Jerome to see how he reacts to this. It baffles me. It baffleseveryone I know.Clearly, it doesn’t baffle Jerome. He looks intrigued. And rather pleased.‘So you call it into existence with this measurement?’ he says. ‘Like a magussummoning a demon?’My brow furrows. Is that right? I hesitate, then decide it’s as good as anythingI’ve heard. I nod, as sagely as I can.ψThis is not quite the whole truth. This understanding of what the Schrödingerequation tells us is known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanicsbecause it was invented and promulgated — quite forcefully, at times — by thegreat Dane, Niels Bohr. It is the most popular of the interpretations amongphysicists — but not the physicists who think particularly deeply because it isactually bankrupt as an explanation of what happens in the quantum world.Niels Bohr is widely considered the father of quantum theory. His researchcentre in Copenhagen, which was sponsored by the Carlsberg brewery for a time,was certainly the hub for the theory’s development. Bohr was well liked by mostof his contemporaries. Although he was frustrating to argue with, since he gaveno quarter and generally considered himself right about everything, he was farfrom dull. There were times when he engaged his colleagues in mock gun fightsbecause he had developed a theory — drawn from watching American cowboy movies —that the person who draws second will always win.For a highly intelligent man, Bohr was astoundingly slow to understand anythinggoing on around him. From movie plots to presentations at physics conferences,he tended to need everything explained to him several times from severaldifferent angles. That didn’t prevent him from being a Nobel Prize–winninggenius, however.Here’s how Bohr’s explanation of the quantum world works. Go back to the doubleslit experiment, where a single photon has two apertures to pass through inorder to reach a detector on the other side. Think of the photon as an arrow andthe detector as two archery targets placed side by side. If the bullseyes arelined up with the two slits, you’d expect the arrows to hit only the bullseyes.That would be the everyday, ‘classical’ outcome. But after you watch the quantumarcher fire one arrow at a time for a few hours, you go and look at the target.You find the arrows are clumped around a few particular points, with no arrowsat the points between.Now let’s change the spectator’s view. Instead of looking at the archer, look atthe slits to see which one the arrow goes through. After a few hours, go andlook at the targets. You’ll now find that the arrows are only in the bullseyes.The act of watching the arrow pass through the slits has changed the outcome.Going back to the photon in the double slit experiment, what does this mean?According to Bohr’s Copenhagen interpretation, the photon — faced with twopossibilities given by the two slits that it can pass through — exists as awave. That means it is in a region of space, but not definable at one particularpoint, much like a wave on the sea. So we can’t say anything about the photon’sspecific position. All we can do is talk about its wave function — themathematical description that Schrödinger gives us. But remember, the wavefunction’s only purpose is to describe what the outcome of a measurement mightbe. Its square gives the probabilities of the various outcomes occurring. Itsays nothing about the photon’s life story, only its final outcome. In fact,Bohr would say there is no life story — there is no photon to talk about,effectively — until that measurement happens.However … nowhere in the Copenhagen interpretation is the ‘measurement’ defined.Instead, Copenhagenists talk about the ‘collapse’ of the wave function from awide array — a ‘superposition’ — of many possible states into just one definitestate.So, what is the measurement? How does it cause this ‘collapse’? There have beenlots of attempts to find out. One group of researchers based in Vienna areworking particularly hard at this and are convinced that it is something to dowith information carried by the photon.Think of the photon as Tartaglia’s father, Micheletto, the postman. His job isto carry letters from one place to another. He doesn’t know what is in theletters, but we do know they contain information. Whoever reads the informationis carrying out a measurement. While the letters are sealed, only the senderknows what is in them. To everyone else, all possibilities are open, which is tosay that they are in a superposition of all possible pieces of information.Maybe it’s a bill? Maybe it’s a love letter? Maybe it’s an order for unicorn’shorn? Once they are opened and read, however, the information is suddenlydefined. That is a measurement.What the Viennese researchers did was, effectively, to try melting the seal onthose letters. At first just a little bit. They heated up the photons, and thenthey looked at the pattern on the detector. I know I’m conflating letters,photons, and arrows here, but what they saw was that the arrows were lessclumped. The pattern was less stark. As they heated the photons more, so thedistribution of the arrows became more and more like you’d expect in theeveryday world — focussed on the bullseyes, with just a few strays elsewhere.The act of heating, they suggested, tells us something about measurement. Asanything gets hot, it radiates energy. That’s how we began this whole tale, ifyou remember. And the different wavelengths — the colours of that light energy —can contain different quantities of information. The result of heating was thatsome of the information about the photon — the contents of the letter — becamereadable. It’s as if the yielding wax allowed a corner of a page to roll up andbe read. Only a few words became visible, but it was enough to allow the readerto see that it was probably a love letter. Perhaps the words ‘your lips’ cameinto view. Now it was definitely not a bill, nor an order for unicorn horn. Itmight still have been something other than a love letter. It could have been aninstruction to keep silent: a threat, for instance, to a witness of a crime notto let a single word about the incident pass their lips. Whatever the truth, notall possibilities about the nature of that information are open any more. And sothe weird quantum pattern is less stark. The Viennese researchers think that theinformation radiating away from the hotter photons is enough to read theirlocation as they pass through the slits — in other words, that it could betraywhich slit the photon passed through.This leaking of information is known as ‘decoherence’ and that’s about as muchas we understand about it. There seems to be, according to the Copenhagenists, athreshold beyond which information leakage will cause the wave function’ssuperposition to ‘collapse’.Niels Bohr first presented what came to be known as the Copenhageninterpretation of quantum physics in 1927, at a conference in Como, Italy. Hispresentation came after what was almost a two year silence about quantum theory,during which he had wrestled with the idea that a photon was both a wave and aparticle, and — simultaneously — neither. In the end, his view was that we couldsay nothing about what it actually was. All we could say is what we see. In thatway, the observer becomes an integral part of the system.‘There is no quantum world,’ he once said. ‘There is only an abstract physicaldescription.’ And later, ‘an independent reality in the ordinary physical sensecan neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation’.The reception to Bohr’s talk was mixed, with most people rather underwhelmed.One of the physicists in the audience, Eugene Wigner, was entirely unimpressedby Bohr’s Como lecture. It would change no one’s mind about their own take onthe meaning of quantum physics, he said. But, in the end, Wigner was wrong.Louis de Broglie, for instance, changed his mind, coming over to Bohr’s point ofview. There are many who wish he hadn’t. But to understand why de Broglie cameround, we have to pursue Jerome’s story, too."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Nicolo Tartaglia’s self regard is dramatically inflated after his victory overFior. He is aware he now possesses unique knowledge that will provide him withan income for years to come. He guards it jealously and to good effect. Hisenhanced reputation brings him various teaching posts, including a publiclectureship in Milan as well as his Venetian teaching post. This gives him themoney and time to turn his mind to subjects no one else is thinking about.One of those subjects is artillery. No one has yet put mathematics to work inthe service of kings and generals at war and Tartaglia finds himself wellequipped. However, he is filled with a pacifist’s remorse. For all his vainself-aggrandising nature, he remains a devout man of high moral standards. Thecreation and refinement of killing machines does not sit well with him, as thispassage from his writings makes clear:One day I fell to thinking it a blameworthy thing, to be condemned — cruel anddeserving of no small punishment by God — to study and improve such a damnableexercise, destroyer of the human species, and especially Christians in theircontinual wars … I destroyed and burned all my calculations and writings thatbore on the subject. I much regretted and blushed over the time I had spent onthis.That attitude only softened when Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan of the OttomanEmpire, began to slaughter Christians in the crusades. ‘It no longer appearspermissible to me at present to keep these things hidden,’ Tartaglia says. ‘Ihave hence resolved to publish them partly in writing and partly by word ofmouth, to every faithful Christian, so that each may be better fitted in offenceas well as defence.’ In 1537, convinced he can help the Pope’s cause, heself-publishes his treatise on the trajectory of cannonballs, The New Science ofArtillery.Good as the book is, it misses its target. Tartaglia simply doesn’t have thereach, the connections, to attract the attention of military minds. So whenJerome gets in touch two years after its publication and offers to help,Tartaglia takes the bait.Jerome is desperate to know Tartaglia’s secrets. Having heard a great deal aboutthem, he is suffering a base professional jealousy. Jerome sees algebra as hisspecialist subject and yet he is painfully aware that he doesn’t know all thereis to know about it.It is a particular problem because he has decided to write a revolutionary bookon arithmetic. This is to be no high-minded endeavour to impress his academicrivals, but a maths book for the common people. It will be sixty-eight chapterslong, with an introduction that lays out the journey the reader is to take.That decision was made fourteen years ago and, in the years since, he hasalready completed much of the book. So far, The Practice of Arithmetic has dealtwith basic operations, such as multiplying and dividing. It has taught integersand fractions, and even the supernatural properties of numbers. Jerome hasreached the more advanced chapters now. The problem is that Tartaglia’sconfidante, the hollow-eyed Brescian schoolteacher Zuanne da Coi, has come toMilan. He is talking loudly about Tartaglia’s new solutions to the cubicequations. Jerome knows these new solutions must be published in his book. Buthow to get them?Fortunately, Jerome has trained a student, Lodovico Ferrari, whose talent willhelp achieve this tricky task. Lodovico came to Jerome’s household as afourteen-year-old servant on 30 November 1536. Initially, he was a replacementfor his cousin, who had run away from the notion of working hard for a living.Unlike his cousin, Jerome noted, Lodovico could read and write, so he put theboy in charge of the household secretarial work. When Lodovico proved able andclever, Jerome began to teach him mathematics. Lodovico may well have been theguinea pig on whom Jerome tested the efficacy of his blossoming maths text.Five years later, in 1541, Jerome had become convinced of Lodovico’s gift andwas determined to give it space to flower. He resigned one of his teachingposts, as a lecturer at the Piatti Foundation in Milan, knowing this would giveLodovico an opportunity to break into academia.There were only two candidates for the newly vacant position: Lodovico and theteacher Zuanne da Coi. The choice was resolved in a public maths duel — ofcourse — and Lodovico won easily. The twenty-year-old servant is now also alecturer in geometry, feels a great debt to Jerome, and is fiercely loyal to hiscause.Jerome and Lodovico work well together, researching new algebraic solutions todifficult problems. But still they cannot crack Tartaglia’s secret. Eventually,they decide on a more direct approach. They will ask Tartaglia to share hisknowledge for the common good.Aware of Tartaglia’s prickly reputation, Jerome and Lodovico enlist a localbookseller named Zuan Antonio as a go between. He will convey Jerome’s carefullyphrased question to Tartaglia and bring back the reply, with all communicationdirected to Antonio as a third party.It starts off politely enough:Master Nicolo Tartaglia, I have been directed to you by a worthy man, aphysician of Milan, named Master Girolamo Cardano, who is a very greatmathematician. And because he has understood that you have been engaged indisputation with Master Fior, putting to him for a wager certain questions thatcould only be answered by knowing the general rule for resolving the case of thecubic, which general rule you had found by your own discovery. Therefore hisexcellency prays you that you will kindly make known to him the rule discoveredby you, and if you think fit will make it public under your name in his presentwork, but if you do not think fit that it should be published he will keep itsecret.The reply, predictably, came in the negative:Tell his excellency that he must pardon me: when I propose to publish myinvention, I will publish it in a work of my own, and not in the work of anotherman, so that his excellency must hold me excused.The full back-and-forth becomes a little tedious — most particularly for thoseinvolved. However, Jerome does not give up. He even offers never to publish thesolutions, if Tartaglia will only reveal them. Tartaglia refuses.Jerome then asks for the list of questions which Fior had set him in thecompetition for Tartaglia’s post. These Tartaglia reluctantly supplies,commenting that, ‘his excellency, whatever his competence, will be unable toresolve them, for to do that would mean his excellency had a wit like to my own,which he has not’.Chiding his correspondent for such an ‘unhandsome reply’, Jerome remarks thatwhatever Tartaglia might think, he is himself ‘nearer to the valley than themountain-top.’ It is then that he drops into the conversation the fact that hehas passed a copy of Tartaglia’s book on artillery to a friend. A friend whohappens to be Alphonso d’Avalos, Marquis del Guasto.The Marquis, as Tartaglia knows — and Jerome knows that he knows — is a powerfulmilitary man. Jerome now dangles the chance of an offer of employment before hisrival. He invites Tartaglia to come to Milan to meet the Marquis. Jerome’smasterful move puts Tartaglia in a bind. In the margins of a letter from Jerome,Tartaglia scrawls out his frustration: ‘I am reduced by this fellow to a strangepass, because if I do not go to Milan the lord marquis may take offence, andsuch offence might do me mischief, I go thither unwillingly: however, I willgo.’And go he does. When he arrives, however, the Marquis is out of town. Jeromeinvites Tartaglia to visit his house instead. There he repeats his promise that,if he could just learn the secrets of the cubic equations, he will refrain frompublishing them. Tartaglia brazenly says he is not willing to take Jerome at hisword. Jerome swears several oaths and says he’ll even write the solutions downonly in code, so that no one can discover them, even after his death.And it is then — for reasons that remain unclear — that The Stammerer wavers. Hesays he will ride off in search of the Marquis; on his return, he will showJerome the solutions. Seizing the moment, Jerome says no — tell me now. And,using a poem as a cover, Tartaglia does so:When the cube and things togetherAre equal to some discreet number,Find two other numbers differing in this one.Then you will keep this as a habitThat their product should always be equalExactly to the cube of a third of the things.The remainder then as a general ruleOf their cube roots subtractedWill be equal to your principal thingIn the second of these acts,When the cube remains alone,You will observe these other agreements:You will at once divide the number into two partsSo that the one times the other produces clearlyThe cube of the third of the things exactly.Then of these two parts, as a habitual rule,You will take the cube roots added together,And this sum will be your thought.The third of these calculations of oursIs solved with the second if you take good care,As in their nature they are almost matched.These things I found, and not with sluggish steps,In the year one thousand five hundred, four and thirty.With foundations strong and sturdyIn the city girdled by the sea.Yes, it seems unbelievably, painfully contrived. But this is Renaissance Italy;this is how they are. Indeed, Tartaglia is by no means the first algebraist tosummarise his insight in poetic form. Decades earlier, for example, themathematician Luca do Borgo had expressed his algebraic rules in Latinquatrains.Tartaglia is proud of his rhyme: it ‘speaks so clearly’, he tells Jerome, ‘that,without other example, I think your excellency will be able to understand thewhole’. Jerome, in reply, assures Tartaglia that he has understood almosteverything about the solution on his first reading of the poem. Remember yourpromise not to publish, is Tartaglia’s response. And then there is silence. Fivemonths pass. Tartaglia, regretting his weakness and hearing disturbing rumours,writes to Jerome from Venice:I am very sorry that I have given you already so much as I have done, for I havebeen informed, by a person worthy of faith, that you are about to publishanother algebraic work, and that you have gone boasting through Milan of havingdiscovered some new rules in Algebra. But take notice, that if you break yourfaith with me, I certainly shall not break promise with you (for it is mycustom); nay, even undertake to visit you with more than I have promised.Jerome holds his nerve. He has indeed published a book containing algebraicrules, The Practice of Arithmetic. But, no, he hasn’t broken his promise. Hesends Tartaglia a copy, so that he can verify this for himself. Tartaglia’sresponse is cruel and petty. He writes to Jerome that the book contains nothingnew. It is simply a synthesis of what we already knew. What’s more, he adds, thebook is confused and full of mistakes: ‘The whole of this work of yours isridiculous and inaccurate, a performance which makes me tremble for your goodname.’ He points to one particular howler: ‘your excellency has made such agross mistake that I am amazed thereat, forasmuch as any man with half an eyemust have seen it — indeed if you had not gone on to repeat it in diversexamples, I should have set it down to a mistake of the printer’.Nor has he finished. So numerous are the errors, Tartaglia says, and sometimesso rudimentary, that Jerome is clearly incapable of innovative work. The ideathat Jerome could have worked out Tartaglia’s solution to the cubic equation forhimself, he writes, ‘sets me off laughing’. Enter Lodovico Ferrari, Jerome’sbrilliant pupil, spoiling for a fight. Ferrari clearly believes it is below hisbeloved master’s dignity to pursue the quarrel. But Ferrari has no trouble withbrawls himself, having lost two fingers to a rival’s dagger in a tavern fight.Now, seeming to relish taking on Tartaglia, he writes on his master’s behalf:You have the infamy to say that Cardano is ignorant in mathematics, and you callhim uncultured and simple-minded, a man of low standing and coarse talk andother similar offending words too tedious to repeat. Since his excellency isprevented by the rank he holds, and because this matter concerns me personallysince I am his creature, I have taken it upon myself to make known publicly yourdeceit and malice.He even makes a mathematical joke. With all Tartaglia’s talk of square roots,cube roots, and more, he says, ‘I promise you that if it were up to me to rewardyou, taking example from the custom of Alexander, I would load you up so muchwith roots and radishes that you would never eat anything else in your life.’You probably had to be there. But the reality is that very many people were, forthe correspondence between Tartaglia and Ferrari is sold in the streets likenewspapers. Indeed, it circulates around Europe as other academics take it uponthemselves to explain to everyone what the dispute is about. The row has becomefamous, as have its protagonists. The unexpected side effect is that the publicis learning mathematics in order to follow the soap opera. To be precise, thepublic is learning about cubic equations and conic sections.That might seem implausible now, but in Renaissance Italy the public is stillaware that these subjects belong to a revered intellectual lineage. For most ofhistory, conic sections — the points where a cone meets a surface — were just amathematical challenge, the geometrical Sudoku of the professionalmathematician. The Greeks, for instance, loved playing around with these puzzlesand, a couple of hundred years before the birth of Christ, a geometer andastronomer called Apollonius of Perga wrote an eight volume treatise on themathematics of the conic section. More than a thousand years later, OmarKhayyam, the Persian mathematician and poet, wrote his Treatise on Demonstrationof Problems of Algebra, in which he showed that the intersection of a hyperbolawith a circle provides a geometric method for solving cubic equations. This, itis worth saying, is not a pointless pursuit. Conic sections trace out an ellipseor parabola and can be used to calculate the trajectories of planets through thesky, or artillery through the air.ψ‘I simply had to have them in the book.’ Jerome’s tone is defensive, almost sly.‘Students of algebra needed to know these solutions. Do you understand?’I nod, but slowly and with my head inclined; I can see his point, but I can alsosee Tartaglia’s. ‘I suppose so,’ I concede eventually. ‘It’s funny: we teach ourchildren to solve these equations, but I don’t think they ever know why they areuseful.’Jerome frowns at this. ‘Why not?’‘Most of our children give up studying mathematics as soon as they are able.’‘And come back to it when they are older?’I shake my head. ‘No. They almost never come back. They may go through theirlives knowing the formula for solving a quadratic equation, but never once applyit to anything.’‘So there are bakers on the streets of sixteenth-century Milan now who feel morein tune with mathematics than the educated children of your city?’‘More in tune than the educated adults, if I’m honest.’You know it’s true. Remember this? x equals minus b, plus or minus the squareroot of b squared minus four ac, all over two a. It is a phrase that meanssomething to people educated to secondary level across the world. Few of usrealise that the Babylonians knew it too, as the formula to solve a quadraticequation of the form (as we would write it now): ax2 + bx + c = 0.Jerome and Tartaglia and all their peers certainly knew this trivial piece ofmathematics. What hadn’t been resolved was how far you could go. Could there besolutions for all equations that involved the cubic: x3? And what about thequartic: x4? The quintic: x5?Years earlier, Scipio Ferreus had gone some of the way with cubic solutions andTartaglia had gone further still. Jerome and Lodovico had derived two moresolutions to algebraic problems. Jerome was eager to publish them, but he washamstrung. His work relied on Tartaglia’s solution, revealed in the poem, and hehad promised not to publish that. And then he found a way to sidestep TheStammerer.ψIn 1543, someone — we don’t know who — whispers in Jerome’s ear that it wasScipio Ferreus, not Tartaglia, who came up with the first solution. If that istrue, why not go straight to the source? Or, given that the source is dead, thesource’s son-in-law?Here, fortune smiles on Jerome. It turns out that the son-in-law, Annibale dellaNave, is still very much alive, and living in Bologna. Jerome and Lodovico pitchup at his door. Annibale shows them Ferreus’s papers. In an ‘aha’ moment worthyof any great detective story, they see the solution — and see immediately thatit is the solution that Tartaglia hinted at in his poem. Yes, Tartaglia mighthave worked out a solution to the cubic equation, but Ferreus had worked it outfirst. That means the solution is not the exclusive property of Tartaglia. Andso, Jerome reasons, it could be published in his next work, a book on the ‘GreatArt’ of algebra.‘My heart was skipping,’ Jerome says. His eyes glint. ‘After that, the solutionspoured out.’‘The quartic? And all the various cubic solutions?’He nods. ‘And now I was free to publish them. My oath to Tartaglia wasirrelevant’‘Because you could publish his solution as Ferreus’s work.’He grins: a wide, ugly leer. ‘Exactly,’ he says.In his new book, The Great Art (Ars Magna), Jerome gives Tartaglia and Ferrariall credit for their contributions, which, to his credit, he lays out with greatskill. Scipio Ferreus also receives credit where it is due.To Tartaglia, however, a credit is not enough. The Stammerer is incensed.Jerome doesn’t understand why, but then there are many things to do with theseequations and their solutions that he doesn’t understand. The negativesolutions, for example, which he calls ‘fictitious’. And there are worse cases.There are, for instance, the solutions that involve the square roots of negativenumbers — the famed imaginary numbers.Jerome’s Ars Magna is the first published acknowledgement that mathematicalprocedures can produce the square roots of negative numbers. In it, they appearas the solution to a relatively simple problem: ‘divide 10 into two parts, oneof which multiplied into the other shall produce 40’. The only solutions, Jeromeshowed, were (5 + √-15) and (5 – √-15).Jerome had seen that solving cubic equations often produces square roots ofnegative numbers along the way. That is because his formula for solving anequation of the form x3 = 3px + 2q was x = 3√(q + √(q2 – p3)) + 3√(q – √(q2 –p3)).Once you start plugging numbers into that formula, square roots of negativenumbers can appear very quickly. You can start with very ordinary numbers andsometimes progress through to solutions that contain very ordinary numbers, butyou must be prepared to encounter strange and scary beasts along the way. AndJerome was.Not that he has received the credit he deserved for such boldness. Nowadays,mathematicians tend to credit Descartes with recognising the importance of these‘imaginary’ numbers. In his 1637 book La Géométrie, Descartes says, ‘Neither thetrue nor the false roots are always real; sometimes they are imaginary.’By ‘false’, Descartes means negative numbers, which were themselves consideredsuspicious and problematic. How much more troublesome the imaginary numbersseemed. Newton called them ‘impossible’ in his Universal Arithmetic of 1707.Newton’s arch rival, Gottfried Leibniz, was more positive. In 1702, Leibniz, whowas a great admirer of Jerome’s work, spoke of the imaginary number as ‘a fineand wonderful resource of the human spirit, almost an amphibian between beingand not being’.In the end, it was the Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, who broughtimaginary numbers into the mainstream. In the eighteenth century, he followedDescartes’ idea and named them imaginary numbers, denoting the square root of -1as i. He connected i to the real world by showing that a mathematical constantknown as e — Euler’s number — is connected to pi via i: eiπ = -1.That e ties together with i and pi is one of the great mysteries of themathematical universe. e was being used in myriad calculations — fromcalculations of compound interest, to the power of cannons — and so it wasn’tlong before Euler’s work turned Jerome’s ‘useless’ numbers into an essentialcomponent of a mathematician’s toolkit. By the end of the eighteenth century,they were required everywhere.If I want to take something that varies over time, for instance, and calculateits exact value at a certain time, I need the imaginary numbers. That is becausethey exist in the formula and, as soon as the formula involves squaring anumber, they become real. For all their ‘imaginary’ nature, if you don’t putthem in, you get the wrong answer.So, when are the imaginary numbers required in a formula? The answer is whenthere is more than one dimension to a problem — which, in the real world, isalways the case. Say I wanted to calculate how fast a team of oxen could plougha field. It is not just about how much power they apply to the plough — there isalso the issue of the soil’s resistance to their movement. And the amount ofresistance changes depending on how fast the plough is moving. It is a complexproblem and it requires complex numbers. And ‘complex numbers’ is the name wegive to the combination of real and imaginary numbers.How does ploughing a field relate to the solutions for cubic equations? Well, Ican plot a graph of the speed of the oxen versus the resistance of the soil tothe plough. Because the soil’s frictional resistance to the ploughshare dependson the speed of the oxen, it wouldn’t be a straight line; it would be a curve.And if I wanted to add in a third factor — the change in resistance as thespring sunshine dries out the soil, say — then I would have not just a curve,but a three dimensional curve. That is a solid object, essentially, somethinglike a curvy cone. If I want to know where this curvy cone intersects withanother factor — the availability of labourers during the day, say, so that Ican work out the most efficient time at which to start ploughing — then I amtrying to find solutions to where the curvy cone meets another, related curve. Iam, in fact, looking for the solutions to a cubic — possibly quartic — equation.We are back in the territory of Omar Khayyam and Apollonius of Perga.No one wanting to plough a field in Jerome’s day would think about consulting amathematician. However, people calculating the interest owed on loans certainlydid. Bankers and loan sharks lent money with property as security — your house,perhaps, or the contents of a grain-storage barn. With the value of the propertychanging on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the economic climate, andaccepted interest rates varying on a daily basis, those calculations involvedsolving what were, at the time, rather complex equations. The bankers didn’tneed to think in terms of conic sections because the educated men they hired asin-house mathematicians generally had plug-and-play formulae at their disposal.Except, of course, where they didn’t. In those cases, a new solution methodwould, quite literally, put money in the bank.Things are no different now. When I was doing my PhD I worked with a colleague,Daniel, who eventually pursued a career in finance. His abilities in solving‘differential equations’ — the name given to equations that involve a cohort ofsmoothly varying factors, all of which can change the outcome — have earned hima fortune. His variables are not mud and ploughs, sun and workmen, but commodityprices and shipping times, along with the minutiae of supply and demand. This iswhy, for decades now, the world’s banks have been mopping up some of the bestuniversities’ mathematicians and physicists. All of these people know the valueof i. To them, it is priceless.ψ‘And why didn’t you work for the bankers?’ Jerome looks genuinely puzzled. ‘Youknow quantum theory, too. You can solve these equations. You could have madeyour fortune.’I raise my eyebrows and smile. ‘I could ask you the same thing, surely?’‘I never cared about money,’ Jerome says with a shrug.‘Me neither. Otherwise I wouldn’t be a writer, would I?’Jerome acknowledges the joke with a grin, but says nothing.‘And I would never have discovered all of this.’ I tap my stone on the psi. ‘Iwould have had all the knowledge and none of the wisdom. Daniel can solveequations for money, but he doesn’t understand the nature of reality.’‘And you do?’ He knows the answer.‘Not yet,’ I reply. ‘But I’m ever hopeful.’I can see the smile twitching at the corner of his mouth. ‘And is it theCopenhagenists that give you such optimism?’He is being sardonic, and enjoying it. Jerome had very little time for theDanes. He was once asked by King Christian III of Denmark to travel toCopenhagen and become the royal physician for a salary that was twice what hewas earning at Pavia — plus a house, servants, and horses. Jerome politelydeclined. The Danes, to his mind, were uncultured barbarians and their climatewould be the end of him. What, he later wrote, is the use of riches and comfortwhen the cold and the damp are ‘an entrance to death’s caverns’?‘I told the King of Denmark that I couldn’t help him because I couldn’t be intwo places at the same time,’ Jerome says. He looks thoughtful. ‘I said I was awidower with children and that I had to oversee their education. I couldn’t bein the north when my heart was in the south.’‘That was an expedient excuse, though, wasn’t it? Your children’s educationdidn’t stop you going to Scotland, after all.’Jerome laughs, a low chuckle that makes his shoulders shake for a moment. ‘No,’he says. ‘But Archbishop Hamilton needed my help more than King Christian.’‘And now you need his.’Jerome picks up his pen. ‘Yes,’ he says. ‘And now I need his.’"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8What to deal with first? That Jerome is a widower — the death of poor Lucia, themuch loved wife about whom he wrote so tellingly little? The children whobrought their father such misery? Or Archbishop Hamilton?The Archbishop? At least that story has a neat beginning and a happy ending.Let’s start there.It is 1551. Jerome is entering his sixth decade and is the talk of Europe. Hehas cured cases of tuberculosis by prescribing clearer air outside of the city.He has healed the tetanus-stricken son of a Bolognese Senator. By 1539, twelveyears after their first denial of his suitability to practise medicine, theMilanese College of Physicians had admitted him to their ranks. Two years later,he accepted the offer to become their rector. It is a position of such status inEurope that it brings Jerome to the attention of foreign powers — and, inparticular, to the attention of the medical team responsible for ArchbishopHamilton.Born a bastard like Jerome, Hamilton has risen to become Archbishop of StAndrews and Lord High Treasurer, Comptroller, Collector General, and Treasurerof the New Augmentation of Scotland. However, he is a martyr to his debilitatingasthma. His personal physician, John Cassanate, has abandoned trying to come upwith a cure. Instead, Cassanate has used Scotland’s status as a solidlyindependent Catholic state to engage the services of both the doctors at thecourt of the King of Catholic France and those who attend the French King’snemesis, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, none has managed to be of theslightest help.Then Cassanate hears great things of one Jerome Cardano. On 28 September, hewrites a letter to the Milanese doctor. It takes six weeks to make its waythrough a violent, war-ravaged Europe. Eventually, though, it is delivered intoJerome’s hand.The letter announces, somewhat presumptively, that the Archbishop will travelfrom Scotland to Paris to receive treatment from Jerome. All expenses will becovered by the letter’s bearer. Flattered, Jerome sets out from Milan on 12December 1551. He heads due west into France to begin the journey to Paris, butis stopped in his tracks after three hundred miles, in Lyon. By this time, wordof his journey has reached Lyon’s governor. He is met outside the city walls andtold, with flourishes and more flattery, that he simply cannot take another stepfurther — not until the governor has had time to arrange a proper civicreception for the esteemed Doctor Cardano.Jerome is put in a decorated carriage, with outriders and postilion, and, whensuitable preparations have been made, paraded through the city. He is not immuneto adulation and he happily stays six full weeks in Lyon, consulting with localdignitaries and offering advice to their physicians. What’s more, a secondmessenger has arrived from the Archbishop and asked Jerome to wait in Lyon forDoctor Cassanate, who will personally accompany him to Paris.While he waits, the sick of Lyon flock to him, paying good money for hisattentions. He even receives a lucrative job offer. If he will remain in thecity, a local military commander called Marshal Brissac will hire him asmathematician and designer of artillery. He stands to earn one thousand crowns ayear. He turns down the Marshal’s generous offer, however, because historybeckons.Jerome is about to step into one of the great intrigues of the century becauseArchbishop Hamilton is the brother of James Hamilton, Regent of Scotland.James’s right to the regency is fiercely disputed, however, with a CardinalBeatoun vying for the position. To shore up his position, James has made analliance with King Henry VIII of England: that Mary, the daughter of Scotland’slast king, James V, would marry Henry’s son, Edward. James will send Mary — tobe known as Queen of Scots — to London when she reached the ripe old age of ten.With her would go six hostages who would ensure every part of the pact isupheld.The Scottish barons hated what they perceived as this weak, subservient attitudeto England and conspired with Beatoun to take Mary and her mother, Mary ofGuise, captive so that the promise could not be fulfilled. And so the Archbishopencouraged his weakling brother to declare Beatoun an enemy of the state.Scotland entered what was, effectively, a civil war. Beatoun was murdered, thenHenry VIII died in 1547, putting the young (and wifeless) Edward VI onto theEnglish throne. When Edward’s Protector, the Earl of Somerset, then invadedScotland, the Scots asked France for help fighting the English and offeredlittle Mary’s hand in marriage to the Dauphin. So it was that Mary, now sixyears old, travelled to France in 1548 with the returning fleet that had broughtsix thousand French soldiers to Scotland.Three years later, in 1551, France negotiated a delicate peace between Englandand Scotland. However, Mary of Guise, now residing with her daughter in theFrench court, has designs on the Regency of Scotland. The weakling JamesHamilton has clung to the position, but only through the strength and advice ofhis brother, the Archbishop John Hamilton. And now the Archbishop’s asthma ismaking it all but impossible to continue this role. The fear is that, ifHamilton’s health doesn’t improve, Scotland will quickly become Mary’s dominion.By the time Jerome is in Lyon, the asthma attacks are coming weekly and lastingfor a full day each time. Regent James Hamilton, who feels his brother is not inany state to stand by his side, has promised Mary of Guise that she can have theRegency by January 1552. She is well on her way to achieving all her ends. OnlyJohn Hamilton stands in her way.Which is why the Archbishop cannot afford to leave. Instead of coming to Paris,his personal physician will come to Lyon and escort the good Doctor Cardano allthe way back to Edinburgh. It looks like it will be worth Jerome’s while. For acure, Hamilton says, he is willing to pay ‘all the riches of my revenues’. Lessthan twenty years after finding himself homeless and spat upon in the stinkingstreets of Milan, Jerome looks set to be celebrated with pomp and publicacclaim. And lots of gold, of course. The next few months will be the mostlucrative of his career.On the journey north, Jerome is subjected to further fawning. Although he iskeen to reach his destination as quickly as possible, the luminaries of Pariswill not hear of it. He is given a lavish civic reception and a tour of thecity, and persuaded to speak at several specially arranged medical conferences.He is given a chance to wield the sword of St Joan, which is surprisingly heavy— ‘an indication of the maiden’s unusual strength,’ he said. He is also shownthe talon of a griffin, which he doubts is real. His most memorable moment, hesays, was at the church of St Dionysius, where he was allowed to handle aunicorn’s horn. This, he later writes, was truly impressive, ‘perfectly smooth …perfectly straight’.I can’t let it go. ‘You know it wasn’t really a unicorn horn? It’s from anarwhal — a kind of whale.’Jerome looks affronted. ‘How do you know?’‘Unicorns aren’t real. They’re just mythical. Like the griffin. The hornprobably came from some sailors making a huge profit from a lucky catch.’‘All of the great minds, writers of some of the most reliable books, tell ustales of the unicorn. What makes you so sure?’What to tell him? Once, on a guided tour of Vienna’s Museum of Fine Arts, I wasshown a ruby- and diamond-encrusted goblet. Crafted from horn and gold, it wasmade for carrying powdered unicorn horn. At the time the goblet was made, thepowdered horn was twenty-two times more expensive than gold, weight for weight.But microscopic analysis of the residues inside such vessels has shown them tocontain nothing more exotic than narwhal horn.On the face of it, Jerome is fairly good at sifting evidence and using criticalthinking to come to reasonable conclusions. ‘It is the role of wisdom to putforward first of all the petty doubts,’ he writes in On Subtlety, ‘and even ifthis can be done, then to bring up useful solutions and the cause, and to saynothing ludicrous about the presentation of the cause.’ He offers usefultakedowns of those who claim to have made perpetual motion machines, and evenuses his faculties to pre-empt Darwin’s ‘survival of the fittest’ ideaconcerning evolution in the natural world. His thoughts about the origins of theabilities and physical characteristics of herbivorous beasts include this gem:‘being foolish and timid, they need to be fleet of foot to survive … those thatcannot be speedy do not establish a species’. And yes, in 1550, he uses theLatin word ‘species’ to talk about a class of animals. According to etymologicalsources, the word became used in the 1560s to describe a distinct class (ofsomething) based on common characteristics, and its biological use began around1600. Jerome is an impressive innovator.And yet, despite this surprising level of insight, Jerome often falls flat onhis face — especially where animals are concerned. In 1605, Francis Bacon willpublish a book called The Advancement of Learning in which he will berate Jerome— and Pliny and the Arabian diviners, to be fair — for lacking rigour in thestudy of natural history. ‘There hath not been that choice and judgement used asought to have been,’ Bacon says. There is, in Jerome’s writings, ‘much fabulousmatter, a great part not only untried, but notoriously untrue …’Bacon has a point. Jerome opines, for instance that Lithuanians ‘are the mostvoracious of men’ thanks to the influence of Lithuanian wolverines, creatureswith ‘the size of a dog, the face of a cat, the back and tail of a fox, roughand tough feet and claws, and teeth too’.Where the observations appeal, Jerome eagerly swallows and repeats second orthird hand reports. Pliny’s observation that ‘an elephant making its way onto aship demands an oath that it will return’ is one. In fact, Jerome seems to beutterly credulous where elephants are concerned. They are, he tells readers ofOn Subtlety, ‘sensitive to pity, and revere a king’. Moreover, elephants‘recognise and enforce an oath, and worship the stars, and feel distress forthemselves; they recognise their driver, and extract vengeance from those whohave harassed them unfairly, and appear to fall short of humanity only inlacking speech, since many human beings appear more savage than elephants intheir practice and their movements’.The bald truth is that Jerome loves elephants, or at least the idea of them. Theideas we love are always subject to a little less scrutiny. So it is easy toimagine him in Paris, impressed by a unicorn horn, reflecting back to that pouchof powdered alicorn he had given the old wizard in the workhouse. And justthink: from abject poverty, to a civic reception in Paris; a few ounces ofground horn must have seemed a small price to pay. Why rob him of that happydelusion, when I have my own mythical creatures? After all, I believe the wavefunction psi is a real, measurable thing. For many of my fellow physicists, thisis akin to believing in unicorns.ψAs it happens, I undertook that trip to Vienna, where I encountered the gobletfor carrying unicorn horn (and some of Benvenuto Cellini’s finest works), forthe very purpose of understanding psi. I had been invited to attend a conferenceat which some of the leading lights of quantum theory would gather to debatewhat the wave function is — and, by extension, what quantum theory is, really.If we can understand psi, the rest should follow. Except that we failed to reachour destination. How could we not fail, in such a few short days, when thedebate was almost one hundred years old? But I had been hopeful and I leftVienna dejected.In the time since, I have come to think about the wave function like a game ofpoker. At the card table you make predictions based on probabilities. But thosecards are real, physical objects. Just because I can’t predict which card willcome out next doesn’t mean the cards aren’t real. I just don’t have all theinformation about their order in the shuffled pack. In the same way, psi is realfor me.The fact that psi is constructed of real and ‘imaginary’ parts is not a problem,either. Once you accept that this construction is the mathematical setup thatworks to explain all the observations, you can get over the fact that the setupis so different from the everyday, ‘classical’ world.It’s not as if we don’t have other areas of expertise where there are real andimaginary parts. One of the reasons quantum theorists are so valuable to citybankers is because many commodity prices are constructed from two (or more)things that work in very different ways — sometimes those things are made up,too. Take silk, for example. A silkworm produces silk in volumes that silkfarmers will tell you depends on the ambient temperature. But temperature is nota physical property of the environment. Temperature is a construct: a shorthandfor the kinetic energy available to the atoms in the environment. Temperaturetells us nothing about the amount of energy each of those atoms actually has,only what the average amount of energy might be. So the price of silk depends onsomething real — such as the number of available silkworms — and somethingabstract — the temperature at which they are housed. I think of these as realand ‘imaginary’ parts. I could describe the weather and the weather forecast insimilar terms. While Niels Bohr might prefer to think that psi is nothing morereal than a forecast — a declaration of information about a potential state — Iconsider it to be the weather itself.Feel free to disagree. Plenty of people do, and I with them, and so we go on, nocloser to resolving this argument that Jerome unwittingly started by opening upthe worlds of probability and imaginary numbers. In Vienna, I sat at tableswhere grown men and women would agree on the facts of an experiment and thendisagree entirely about what had actually happened. The most belligerentattendee was an Israeli, Lev Vaidman, who believes that the answer to everythinglies in a multiplicity of universes: the Many Worlds interpretation of quantumtheory.As a writer, I owe this interpretation a great deal. It was the subject of myfirst piece in a national newspaper. The Many Worlds interpretation of quantumtheory is really quite simple. It says that the wave function exists in thatabstract, infinite dimensional Hilbert space that Jerome likened to his aevum.And so, if the space has infinite dimensions, there is no shortage of possibleoutcomes for the processes of the universe. In the double slit experiment, weconcern ourselves with the wave function of a photon moving towards a doubleslit because that is all we are aware of. However, in Hilbert space that wavefunction is encountering all the other wave functions describing everything else— from atoms in the light-detecting screen, to stray atoms of air in theapparatus, and photons of heat radiation emanating from the material in whichthe slits have been cut. These intertwine with all the wave functions of all thestuff in the room and beyond, forming something we can talk about as equivalentto the wave function of the whole universe.The outcome, from our point of view, is an interference pattern that looks as ifthe photon has gone through both slits. According to the Many Worldsinterpretation, however, the outcome is the result of interactions between thewave function of the photon in various dimensions of Hilbert space.Essentially, all possible quantum eventualities can and do occur — but in theinfinite Hilbert space, not in a real (to us) physical space. Many Worlds isoften misrepresented as an extravagantly wasteful interpretation where aninfinite number of universes sit alongside the one we inhabit. It’s neater thanthat, though. The infinity of universes only exist in an abstract mathematicalspace. In this worldview, my PhD research didn’t involve a current going round aring of niobium metal in two different directions at once. It only looked thatway. In reality, the current was going clockwise in some dimensions of Hilbertspace and anticlockwise in others.The man who came up with this provocative idea was Hugh Everett III, a fiercelyintelligent, impetuous, and ultimately self-destructive young man. Born in 1930,Everett grew up to be a genius computer programmer who had almost top-levelsecurity clearance in the US military machine. It was Everett who wrote the codefor American computer simulations of what would happen in an all-out nuclearwar, causing one high-ranking general to comment that Everett was ‘worth hisweight in Plutonium 239’. It was also Everett who dreamt up Many Worlds. Thatwas in the 1950s and he went to his grave three decades later believing he hadfound an answer to all the Copenhagenist fantasies. There is no need for a wavefunction collapse, he said. There is no need to talk about the role of an‘observer’. He could account for the experimental results and the probabilitydistribution that arises from quantum measurements. The only price to pay was abelief in the existence of a near infinite number of abstract universes.Everett wasn’t bothered by the outlandishness of his idea. ‘We do not believethat the primary purpose of theoretical physics is to construct ‘safe’theories,’ he wrote in 1956, directly challenging Bohr and the Copenhagenists.The ‘collapse’ of the wave function’s superposition was a ‘philosophicalmonstrosity’ to Everett, ‘hopelessly incomplete’ and ‘overcautious’. To Everett,quantum theory could only be explained by a bold idea — and his certainly wasbold.You may not be surprised to learn that Everett convinced few of his peers. Sofew, in fact, that he went to his grave a broken man, beaten down by depressionand addiction. In part, that was down to the stubbornness of Niels Bohr, thegreat Dane. Everett’s mentor was a Princeton physicist called John ArchibaldWheeler and Wheeler was incapable of living life without Bohr’s approval. Sowhen Bohr refused to countenance Everett’s ideas in any way, Wheeler ended uppublicly denouncing Everett, crucifying the younger man in order to keep Bohronside. The rejection and the sniping drove Everett to a dark place deep withinhimself. He died of a heart attack aged just fifty-one, a chain-smokingalcoholic who left behind a trail of devastation in his family.Yet, despite their shaky start, Everett’s ideas are now venerated by some of ourgreatest minds. The idea that the world branches every time we measure theposition of an atom, the spin of an electron, or the energy of a light photonsounds outlandish. But why not?One argument against this theory is that it requires multiple copies of you.After all, there is a universe where an ion moved left to right across aparticular synapse within your brain this morning, and there is one where itwent in the opposite direction. That moment alone created two versions of you.In which universe are you conscious? Or are you you in all of them? There issimply no way to deal with the consequences of the Many Worlds interpretationwithout breaking through the limits of what we understand. What’s more, it is anuntestable idea because we can’t access the other branches of this‘super-universe’, ‘multiverse’, or whatever else you choose to call it. It’s afascinating place nonetheless. It is somewhere where everything happens — foranything that can happen will happen because the infinite possibilities are alloccurring with some finite probability.So what should you think about the Many Worlds idea? That is enormouslydifficult to answer. As with all the other interpretations, it is largely amatter of taste. Can you swallow the idea of multiple copies of you (or at leastyour wave function) circulating in myriad disconnected, abstract worlds? If youcan, you are also signing up to a universe — or multiverse — where a team ofmonkeys has sat at a typewriter and written the complete works of Shakespeare.And one where you can play Russian roulette and never die.This latter universe was the subject of my newspaper debut, an article in TheGuardian. Essentially, it involves a macabre version of the double slitexperiment. Instead of a photon being in two places at once, we have a bulletbeing in two states at once: fired and not fired. And whoever holds the quantumgun to their head is both dead and alive. It was Max Tegmark, a perfectlywell-respected quantum physicist, who worked out that this experiment wouldprovide proof that a near infinite array of universes does exist.Tegmark’s quantum gun only fires a bullet fifty per cent of the times that youpull the trigger. The bullet’s emergence from the chamber is the result of aquantum action — a measurement on whether a lump of radioactive rock has emitteda particle, for example. If it has emitted the particle, the bullet fires intothe subject’s brain, ending their consciousness in that branch of themultiverse. But, according to the Many Worlds idea, there is always a universewhere the rock hasn’t emitted anything. So for every pull on the trigger thereis a universe where the subject never dies. You could never prove it to anyoneelse, but the surviving you would know — if you went through with it — thatevery event that involves you and a quantum particle will cause your life toplay out in a succession of new and different realities. In all the others, yourconsciousness is shut off. So if the Many Worlds interpretation is right, youhave an ongoing experience of immortality. That immortality, Tegmark says, wouldbe your proof of the correctness of the interpretation.But, he adds, it’s just a thought experiment: don’t try it. What’s more, it is alimited proof. Just as no one else can be sure that you are conscious (becauseconsciousness is a subjective experience), no one else would believe your claimsto never once have died while playing a quantum version of Russian roulette.Tegmark does try to live with the multiverse as a reality. He has said that hefeels ‘a strong kinship with parallel Maxes’, even though he never gets to meetthem. ‘They share my values, my feelings, my memories — they’re closer to methan brothers,’ he says. Maybe that’s why he hasn’t yet performed one hundredrounds of quantum suicide to test the hypothesis.I suspect that we are living in a universe where David Deutsch, another eminentMany Worlds proponent, has done it, though. How else could he be so sure thatthese other worlds exist? He once told a colleague of mine that he is as sure ofthe existence of the multiverse as he is of the past existence of dinosaurs onEarth. This is the man who drew up the blueprint for the quantum computer, amachine that is already changing the face of technology in the twenty-firstcentury.He’s no simple-minded fool. And yet …If you find Copenhagen too oblique and Many Worlds too fantastical, there areother interpretations that may be more to your taste. We’ll get to those. In themeantime, we ought to return to the world where, on 29 June 1552, Jerome finallyarrives in Edinburgh.ψJerome’s journey has been interesting, but largely uneventful. He travelled fromParis to Calais via Rouen, which, he says, has fine architecture and handsomeinhabitants. Rouen, to his mind, is a beautiful city: ‘only Rome is even bettersituated and still more imposing and beautiful’. It is, he says, altogether abetter place than Paris, which is ‘a rather filthy place, filled with stench andpoisoned air’. In Dieppe, he marvelled at a gooseberry bush. Once across thechannel, he says little of England, but the weather is clearly not to hisliking. In On Subtlety, Jerome offers a list of twelve celebrity intellectualswho have impressed him. Two are from what he calls ‘the part of England known asScotland’ and he remarks that ‘the Barbarians are not our inferiors in talent’despite living ‘under a foggy sky’. He also speculates on whether the cold ofthe region stimulates hair growth. ‘I remember seeing a younger man in Englandwhose front-body was to my amazement completely covered with hair,’ he says. ‘InScotland I saw another man who had hair over his entire body; one would havecalled him a big bear.’To further his understanding of the locals, Jerome has purchased The History ofScotland, written in Latin by Hector Boece. Within its pages he — and, a fewdecades later, Shakespeare, via Holinshed — first encounters the macabre tale ofthe Scottish king, Macbeth. Jerome is also enthralled by the ‘most wonderful’fortitude of the Scots, who take a piper with them to their executions: ‘he, whois himself often one of the condemned, plays them up dancing to their death’.For just over two months, Jerome attends to the Archbishop, changing hisroutines and regimens. He writes copious notes about the causes of the breathingdifficulties and the best course of action. He alters the Archbishop’sbedclothes, swapping his feather-stuffed leather pillows for seaweed- andsilk-filled linen. He supervises the preparation of His Grace’s meals andbeverages, and oversees his exercise routines. And it seems to work.Within two weeks, the Archbishop has declared himself delighted with progressand let everyone know that Jerome has put him on the road to recovery. In fact,the doctor’s spare time is now taken up with other paying customers, for theScottish nobles all want consultations over their ailments. Then comes theletter from King Edward VI of England:It has come to Our ears that you, the great and beloved physician GerolamoCardano, have raised from a death bed our holy Archbishop of Scotland and have agreat skill in treating these ills of the chest. Therefore at your pleasure waitupon us when you return to London.Though summoned by a king, Jerome does not leave at once. First, he ensures thatthe Archbishop and his entourage will be able to continue the variousprescriptions in his absence. For the entourage he writes a forty page documentand supplements it with a personal handbook for the Archbishop’s own eyes.Hamilton, grateful but not quite satisfied, wants more. He has heard aboutJerome’s skill as an astrologer and asks for a personal horoscope.Here, Jerome is less happy to help. He has just spent two months putting theArchbishop’s body back into action and he knows the power of placebo — or rathernocebo, the negative effect that an emotional upset can have on health. TheArchbishop’s horoscope might dampen his spirits and a depressed man is moreprone to illness. Though he hasn’t yet cast it and doesn’t know what it mightcontain, he does not want the horoscope to undo all his good work.So, when he eventually casts the horoscope, Jerome tells the Archbishop some —but not all — of what he sees in the charts. His Grace, he says, will findhappiness — but only through worry and danger. There is no immediate cause forconcern, but he might find his life in peril in two years time, in 1554, andagain in 1560.Much like the wiliest of weather forecasts, the prediction couldn’t ever beproved wrong, but it is certainly not an accurate depiction of future events asJerome saw them. That is clear now, in 1570, when Jerome’s heart tells himHamilton is already dead, and cannot help him out of this prison cell.‘You, presumably, know the date of the Archbishop’s death?’ Jerome is looking atme with a peculiar stare.‘I should, but I don’t.’ I say. I never paid it much attention. ‘I just know heis alive now, as we sit here.’I have looked it up since, of course. As Jerome and I talk, the Archbishop isfifty-eight years old and less than six months away from being hanged for hisrole in the assassination of Scotland’s Regent Moray.Jerome looks pleased. Not the kind of pleased that results from the realisationthat his life might be spared; more the kind of pleased that he did a very goodjob of being the Archbishop’s doctor. Smug, you might say.‘He was a very sick man. That is one of my greatest achievements,’ he says.Smug, but correct. Indeed, the Archbishop’s condition was so improved that hebegged Jerome to stay until April, promising to lavish him with even more goldthan the doctor had already amassed. Jerome, flattered but genuinely unmoved bypromises of gargantuan wealth, replied that he was too homesick to stay anylonger. And so — with horses, chests of gold, and a cavalry escort — he set offfor London.‘You liked the English, didn’t you?’I have read his description of the sixteenth-century inhabitants of London,published posthumously in his Somniorum Synesiorum. They seem to him ‘urbane andfriendly to the stranger’, like white-skinned Italians. His observation is that,as well as being hairy, they are broad chested, quickly angered (‘and in thatstate to be dreaded’), almost as gluttonous as the Germans, and utterly unafraidof death. ‘With kisses and salutations parents and children part,’ he writes.‘The dying say that they depart into immortal life, that they shall there awaitthose left behind; and each exhorts the other to retain him in his memory.Cheerfully, without blenching, without tottering, they bear with constant thefinal doom.’He finds their language impenetrable. ‘When they opened their mouths I could notunderstand so much as a word,’ he admits. ‘For they inflect the tongue upon thepalate, twist words in the mouth, and maintain a sort of gnashing with theteeth.’ It leaves me wondering how, then, he gained any impression of theEnglish. But then I am also wondering how it is that he and I are able toconverse. Perhaps some things are beyond mere words?ψIf Scotland is a political mess, London is no better. It doesn’t take long forJerome to realise he has walked into a spider’s web: almost immediately he isoffered a thousand gold crowns to treat the young King Edward and endorse hisnew title as Defender of the Faith. Jerome extricates himself from this stickysituation with unusual tact and diplomacy. He is a subject of Italy and thus ofthe pope, he says: his endorsement counts for nothing. Such integrity costs himdearly, for the fee on offer drops immediately to one hundred crowns. He isinvited to the French ambassador’s house, where he is offered a stipend of eighthundred crowns a year if he will walk away from the royal court in Londonwithout treating the king. Jerome politely declines, as he does with emissariesof the Emperor Charles V, who also wants the celebrated Doctor Cardano to spurnthe English heretics.The manoeuvring doesn’t stop there. He is only allowed to examine the king aftera few weeks of hanging around. There is nothing terribly wrong with the boy, isJerome’s diagnosis. That is when he realises he has been brought here for otherpurposes. Pressed for the king’s horoscope, Jerome decides that the pragmaticresponse is to obfuscate.Edward VI had been crowned King of England at the age of nine on the death ofhis father, Henry VIII. He is now fifteen years old. Although Edward is notparticularly unhealthy during the time of Jerome’s visit, measles and smallpoxhave made him prone to illness and the courtiers want to know a date of deathand a foretelling of the political consequences.Here is the dilemma: it is clear to Jerome that the royal court is preparing forchaos. With the king too young to rule alone, England is already governed by aRegency Council that is led by noblemen loyal to Henry Tudor’s Protestantism.When Edward dies — and most believe his demise is imminent — the attempt to keepthe pope out might be undone by his Catholic half-sister, Mary, who couldreasonably ascend to the throne. Her claim would be supported by France andSpain, and her ascension would be a severe blow to the Reformation in England.If he says the wrong thing, Jerome could find his exit blocked. If he says thewords English ears want to hear, however, he could find himself persona nongrata back in Catholic Italy.So Jerome procrastinates. He spends time with Edward, whom he clearly liked andadmired. ‘He was a marvellous boy,’ he wrote later. ‘I was told that he hadalready mastered seven languages. In his own language, French and Latin, he wasperfect.’ Jerome noted that Edward was quite open to being taught and quitecapable of holding a philosophical discussion in Latin — and of askinginsightful questions.Not being able to escape the situation forever, Jerome eventually draws upEdward’s horoscope. He gives a plausible but generally positive account:At the age of twenty-three years, nine months, and twenty-two days, languor ofmind and body would afflict him. At the age of thirty-four years, five months,and twenty days, he would suffer from skin disease and a slight fever. After theage of fifty-five years, three months, and seventeen days, various diseaseswould fall to his lot. As long as he lived he would be constant, rigid, severe,continent, intelligent, a guardian of the right, patient in labour, a remembererof wrongs and benefits; he would be terrible, and have desires and vices growingfrom desire, and he would suffer under impotence. He would be most wise, and forthat reason the admired of nations; most prudent, magnanimous, fortunate, and,as it were, another Solomon.And then he runs off home. Within a year, King Edward VI is dead and England isin turmoil.‘Did you see he was going to die, and thought it best not to mention it?’‘Are you telling me you believe in the powers of astrologers?’ Jerome allowshimself a sly grin. ‘It’s hard to know what I saw, really,’ he shrugs. ‘Butthere was nothing to be gained by predicting his imminent demise. We astrologershave a long tradition of not making such pronouncements. There are uncertaintiesin our information about the future and sometimes we feel we shouldn’t trustourselves to convey it well.’ He pauses and points a finger at my scrawls. ‘Areyou certain of everything you tell me about psi? Would you risk someone’s lifeon your interpretation of its powers? Would you risk your own life in order tovindicate the wave function?’I don’t answer. I’m certain of nothing to do with psi. This wave function maynot represent anything beyond a mathematical tool for making bets on quantummeasurements. There is no certainty to be had here yet. And as for thepossibility of information from the future being known in the present, well, Iknow a very eminent Israeli man who believes that is possible. His name is YakirAharonov, and he has a National Medal of Science that was bestowed upon him bythe President of the United States, Aharonov’s adopted home. It’s almost funny:Jerome worried, on hearing about Christopher Columbus’s journey, that thediscovery of the Americas was a harbinger of the end of time itself. It is amoment that is ‘sure to give rise to great and calamitous events,’ he writes inhis autobiography. Inadvertently, he may have been right.ψAharonov’s interpretation of quantum mechanics is as much of a mind-bender asany idea about time travelling must be. But, he argues, if it’s a mystery tohave a photon be in two places at once, it’s perhaps even more of a mystery tohave the photon know whether it’s being watched.The issue here is that experiments have shown that if we put a detector on oneof the slits in the double slit experiment, the interference pattern disappears.Why? Because, before it even gets to the slits, the photon has seen that itcan’t pass through unnoticed.Aharonov solves this with a simple tweak to our understanding. The photon’s wavefunction, he says, is put together by information from the future as well asfrom the past. In the future, the photon will encounter the detector on the slitand this changes the wave function so that the superposition collapses before ithas even formed.You might, at first glance, find this a bit hard to swallow. Aharonov, though,says this ‘solves the measurement problem’. And surely that’s a reason to takeit seriously.Aharonov is one of the physicists whom I met in Vienna. He is a giant ofphysics, quite simply one of the most brilliant people, one of the clearestthinkers, of our day. It may not always be easy to understand what he’s saying —he has a speech impediment that makes me think of Nicolo Tartaglia — but whenyou get it, it’s very convincing.So here’s what Aharonov says: forget what you think you know about time. Forstarters, it’s not about a progression of moments. Instead, time is actuallyabout the flow of information. For us, it flows only forwards: we haveinformation from the past, but we can’t access information from the future.However, the deeper reality is that time — and, by that, I mean the flow ofinformation — runs both forwards and backwards. And if you know how to accessthat future information, you can resolve the mysteries of the present.You’re probably thinking of astrology. Aharonov is thinking of two controversialideas in quantum physics called weak measurement and postselection.A weak measurement is a measurement that doesn’t disturb the system enough tochange it significantly. Imagine you want to learn the mass of a bicycle that ismoving at speed. To measure it properly, you’d have to stop it and put it on aset of scales. But you can gain a tiny sense of its mass by giving it a littlesideways nudge as it passes. It will deviate from its course for a moment, butit recovers and continues forward. The amount of deviation, compared with theeffort you put into the nudge, will have given you some sense of the bicycle’smass. That’s a weak measurement. The point about a weak measurement is that yougain a small amount of information that is clothed with a huge amount ofuncertainty. In other words, you have learned something, but you’re not surewhether it is true. However, if you probe the system enough times, you mayachieve a consistency to the answers that convinces you of their essentialcorrectness.Applied to measurements on a photon in a double slit experiment, Aharonov says,that gives you a new capability. Throughout those weak measurements, thephoton’s state is a mix of its past state and its future state. In other words,it contains information from the future. And so your weak measurement isrecording a tiny sliver of what the future holds.But for Aharonov, that is not quite enough heresy. He also advocates discardingexperimental results that you don’t want.‘You can’t do that,’ Jerome says. His eyebrows have arched, and his jaw drops.‘It undermines the whole point of doing an experiment.’Perhaps you are shocked that Jerome is shocked? Somehow in the last couple ofcenturies we have convinced ourselves that experimental science only began inthe century after Jerome died. We think of Newton performing experiments thatshow the dispersal of white light by a prism, or of Galileo dropping cannonballsfrom the tower at Pisa to test the nature of gravity (he almost certainlydidn’t, but he did perform other related experiments).What we haven’t absorbed, largely because of cultural bias, is the long Islamichistory of experimentation. In 1021, for example, the Islamic scholar IbnAl-Haytham used a camera obscura to prove that light travels in a straight lineto the eyes. In the following century, Al-Khāzini’s The Book of the Balance ofWisdom describes a huge variety of experiments that prove theories of mechanics.A few centuries later, scholars began to translate Islamic scientific andmathematical texts from Arabic into Latin. Inspired, Jerome and many of hiscontemporaries began conducting their own experiments to test the validity ofideas about how the world worked.The main difficulty they faced was the need for craftsmen. Every piece ofequipment had to be designed and built, sometimes to exacting specifications.That was time consuming and expensive, so experimentation was not for the fainthearted, or the poor. Nonetheless, we possess records outlining the experimentsof Guidobaldo del Monte (who helped Galileo acquire his first academicposition), the Neapolitan Vicenzo Pinello (another friend of Galileo’s), and acertain Nicolo Tartaglia.These experiments were mostly to do with the balance. Think of the old grocer’sscales, where the weight of a measure of flour in one pan is balanced against aset of known weights in the other pan. This was the kind of apparatus by whichTartaglia and his peers worked out the rules governing forces associated withweights and levers. Tartaglia’s experimental contributions were nothing special,but his writings do him credit when it comes to the philosophy of science.Tartaglia openly disputed the work of Aristotle, which made no distinctionbetween theoretical arguments about the operation of a balance and theperformance of a real world balance. Aristotle dealt with abstract mathematics;Tartaglia points out that when translated into the real world, the mathematicswill be subservient to the limits of apparatus and experiment. It might seemobvious to us now, but it was a valuable contribution. ‘The physicist considers,judges, and determines things according to the senses and material appearances,while the mathematician considers and determines them not according to thesenses, but according to reason, all matter being abstracted,’ he says in his1546 book Diverse Questions and Inventions.For that reason, Tartaglia argued, you have to take into account the weaknessesof your apparatus:Smaller balances are found to be more sensitive than larger ones. That this istrue in material balances, experience makes manifest; for if we have a wornducat and want to see by how many grains it is too light, using a large balancesuch as one of those used to weigh spices, sugar, ginger, cinnamon and suchmaterials, we shall get a poor result.This is, he says:[Because of the] difference between the material parts or members of which theyare composed, which parts or members are the two arms and the pivot … For thesaid arms and pivot in the larger scale or balance are much more gross and bulkythan in the smaller. And since the arms of those scales or balances are to beconsidered mathematically, that is, apart from all material, they are consideredand assumed to be as simple lines, without breadth or thickness; and the pivotor axis is assumed to be a simple indivisible point.It is a good point and well made.Tartaglia, as we know from his book on artillery, also performed experimentsrelated to the trajectories of various armaments. It is more laudable thanJerome’s insight into artillery, which was based on observation rather thanexperiment. Jerome noted that a projectile’s trajectory ‘imitates the form of aparabola’, but he didn’t actually investigate it.Jerome’s experimental interests lay in more abstract areas. He made an effort,for instance, to measure the relative density of air and water by shooting abullet from the same source through the two media. His hypothesis was that thedistance travelled by the bullet is inversely proportional to the density of themedium. Water, he concluded, is fifty times denser than air. That’s an enormousunderestimate and we definitely cannot celebrate Jerome as a brilliantscientist. Sometimes, he even led himself to a false understanding of the worlddespite carrying out experiments.Take his encounter with Turin physician Laurentius Guascus Cherascius.In a gathering with Jerome and some of his friends, Cherascius claimed thattouching a needle to a lodestone, a piece of magnetite, would imbue it withanaesthetic properties. ‘As one might expect, since we thought this absurd, heconfirmed the state of affairs by experiment on my companions,’ Jerome writes inOn Subtlety. Jerome’s friends were convinced, so he decided to test this‘incredible state of affairs’ on himself. ‘I rubbed a needle first on thelodestone and introduced it into the skin of my upper arm. At first I felt theslight impression of a prick; later, since it was making its way virtuallystraight though the whole muscle, I could feel the needle penetrating into thedepths on its journey, but I felt no pain whatever — and then I believed myfriends because I had tried it out on myself.’Don’t try this at home. It doesn’t work.‘I felt no pain.’ Jerome is adamant. His eyes are wide and willing me to acceptthe truth.‘I believe you,’ I say. I do — he wouldn’t lie. ‘But that doesn’t mean thelodestone works. When your mind becomes convinced you will feel no pain, yourbody releases its natural painkillers. We call it the placebo effect. I expectCherascius’s gift was in talking you into a conviction the experiment hadworked.’Although Jerome looks unconvinced, he says nothing. He has the habit of notchallenging certain things that I offer up. Behind his eyes, something tells mehe is squirrelling my observations away for contemplation — and use — at a laterdate. He is a voracious consumer of knowledge. I sense that I am only whettinghis appetite.And to be fair, he is still working out what constitutes knowledge. He is aware,for instance, that experiments can be misleading and that reports can befraudulent. Experiments, he contends, are best observed directly — a cautionthat the Royal Society of London would put into practice a century later. He isparticularly sceptical about reports of alchemical success. ‘A Venetianapothecary by the name of Tarvinius allegedly changed mercury into gold, in thepresence of administrative authorities and scholars, and this wondrousoccurrence is still remembered,’ he writes in On Subtlety. ‘But whichever waythis may have come about, it is quite certain that mercury cannot be changedinto gold.’He also doesn’t fall for appeals to authority. He questions Aristotle’s claimthat air is naturally hot. Discussing the atmosphere in On Subtlety, he pointsout that ‘the air in the upper part, where it is not warmed by the reflectedrays of the Sun, is cold’. This, he says, ‘must cast great doubt on thefollowers of Aristotle’. In a discussion of a piece of Hippocrates’ wisdom, hedeclares that ‘I believe Hippocrates not because it is Hippocrates speaking, butbecause I am forced by his reasoning to concur in what he says.’Jerome also balks at ‘received wisdom’, such as comets heralding great events.He compares the occurrence of significant celestial sights against outbreaks ofplague, for instance. Popular wisdom, even among scholars, says that theseevents are linked, but Jerome sees the truth: ‘if nothing else ensues, the signis misleading’, he says. ‘In fact in 1531 and the subsequent years there weremany comets, and from 1539 right to 1551 so many solar eclipses and great lunareclipses were seen that more and greater ones are never recorded — yet Italyfrom 1524 to the present year 1559 has suffered no notable disastrous plague,indeed not even a trace of one.’But he is a great believer in guardian angels, let’s remember. And his reasonsfor assuming that the Venetian demonstration of alchemy was a fraud have a greatdeal to do with his belief that stones and metal are animate, organic substanceswith properties akin to living things. But I don’t want to be too hard on him.That belief — and all his others — were always subject to review if the rightevidence came in. He built his knowledge through ‘inferences from many factswell-known’. One of his self-imposed rules of conduct was to ‘observe allthings, and not think that anything happened fortuitously in nature’. This isnot a path to riches, he ruefully acknowledges (and all working scientists wouldconcur). ‘I am richer in the knowledge of Nature’s secrets than I am in money,’as he writes.In short, he knows the dangers of ignoring or discarding inconvenient evidence.This Aharonov,’ he says, stroking his beard. ‘What does he look like?’It is my turn to raise an eyebrow. ‘Why?’‘Because a man’s character is written in his face and on his body.’ Jerome looksat me as if I am a dullard. ‘That is,’ he says, ‘why humpbacks and squint-eyedmen are not to be trusted.’My eyes widen. ‘What?’‘It’s true. People say such deformities are caused by witchcraft, but that’swrong: it is simply a consequence of nature’s errors. Nonetheless, a humpbackhas a deformity around his heart and a squint is an error near the brain. Bothwill affect character.’I open my mouth to respond, then let this pass. ‘Aharonov looks a bit like you,actually.’Jerome’s eyes narrow. ‘Then perhaps he is not too dishonest,’ he says. ‘But Istill don’t believe in throwing away our hard-earned facts.’To be fair, neither does Aharonov — not exactly. What he believes in is a methodinvolving what he calls preselection and postselection. This, he says, is how wecan read information from the future.ψImagine a stream of particles moving around my ring of niobium metal. I want toknow each particle’s momentum, but I can’t measure it directly, as that wouldaffect the result. So I first ‘preselect’ a particular state for the particles.This is like applying a filter. I’m going to choose to deal only with particlesthat are moving clockwise around the ring. Next, I perform a series of weakmeasurements on each of the particles, gently probing the property I aminterested in — the momentum — without disturbing them. The final act is to makea strong measurement on each of the particles. Then I look at the state each oneis now in. Is it still travelling clockwise or has it been so disturbed by thefinal measurement that it is now travelling anticlockwise?Now for the analysis to find the momentum of these quantum particles. The firstthing to do is to discard all the particles that weren’t properly disturbed inthe final measurement. I ‘postselect’, keeping only those that are nowtravelling anticlockwise. Aharonov showed that quantum statistics can accuratelyinfer their momentum at a time before they were disturbed. And that, he says,contains information about their future state. So postselection and weakmeasurement are crystal balls that allow us to glimpse the future of our quantumobjects, but with the added twist that those future states are real now.However, for me, this way of interpreting superposition and the measurementproblem feels like a step too far. Am I really meant to get my head around this?Despite my admiration for Aharonov, and the fact that some of the smartestpeople on the planet think it’s plausible and indeed correct, I find myselfunconvinced. I can justify that: some of the other smartest people on the planetthink it’s a con.The one reason I think there might be something to Aharonov’s idea is that wealready know that our notion of time and space is fundamentally flawed. Perhapsit’s time to visit the ever-astonishing topic of quantum entanglement."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9The idea that someone or something controls all events goes a long way back.Democritus, for instance, said two and a half millennia ago that any apparentrandomness in the world is just down to a lack of information. Faced withquantum theory, Einstein felt the same: ‘Quantum mechanics is very impressive.But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theoryproduces a good deal, but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One.I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice.’Einstein’s problem starts with the Schrödinger equation, the one I havescratched onto the wall of Jerome’s cell. This describes how the properties of aparticle — an electron, say — will evolve over time. Let’s consider the positionof our electron. The quantum description of that position — given by theSchrödinger equation — cites an ‘amplitude’, formed from psi, which is composedof two components: a set of real positive or negative numbers, and a set ofJerome’s imaginary numbers. The particular numbers — real and imaginary — thatare relevant to a real world experimental situation depend on the kind ofmeasurement being considered.All you can do with this amplitude is to specify a position and work out theprobability that a single measurement on the electron will give that particularposition as the result. When you actually perform the measurement, you might notget that result. But if you do the measurement many times, resetting the systemeach time, the distribution of results will match the probability-basedpredictions of the Schrödinger equation. That’s why, ultimately, our worldbecomes deterministic — the predictable pattern is the net result of many, manyunpredictable individual events and processes.Here is Einstein’s dilemma. Probability and statistics has produced a usefultheory that matches experimental observations. But the theory does not explainanything. It can be used to predict what will be observed in experiments, butsays nothing about why electrons, photons, and atoms behave as they do.Electrons jump between energy levels, producing radiation at wavelengths andintensities that the theory predicts. But why do they jump when they do?An analogy might be the ancient saying, ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight.’Humans have known for millennia that an orange-scarlet tint to the evening skyis a herald of sunny weather when morning comes. It is useful and mostlyaccurate. But it doesn’t have anything to say about why the two phenomena arelinked. The fact is that a red evening sky does not cause a sunny morning. Whenthe saying was invented they were two facets of some mysterious meteorologicalphenomenon.Not that it has remained mysterious: we know now that the red evening sky is theresult of a region of high atmospheric pressure moving in from the west. Thispressure traps dust in the atmosphere and the dust scatters blue light away fromour line of vision, leaving only a red glow. Because of the way the Earth turns,dragging the atmosphere with it, that high pressure ridge moves in from the westovernight to be overhead in the morning, and high pressure generally means goodweather.In stark contrast, we have failed to find any mechanism behind quantum events.Einstein thought there must surely be some way to predict when an electron willmake its jump and send out a flicker of light. Until we have that in our hands,he reasoned, we cannot call quantum theory ‘the real thing’. At the moment ofwriting that passage to Max Born, in December 1926, Einstein felt quantummechanics was incomplete.Now, almost a century later, it is still incomplete by Einstein’s standards. Ourfundamental belief now is that quantum mechanics operates at random. The Old Onedoes play dice, if you will, which means probability is the only way to quantifywhat will happen in our experiments. Jerome wrote that his book On Subtlety —published in 1550, when he was forty-nine years old — aimed to be his ‘completeaccount of the universe in a single volume’. But it turns out that his Book onGames of Chance, written three decades earlier, might have been a more succinctaccount of the operating principles of the universe.No one worked harder than Einstein to think through the issue of fundamentalrandomness. He worried at it for years, formulating thought experiments andseeking acceptable, sensible solutions to the conundrums it threw up. In theend, he went all the way back to the Schrödinger equation and worked withSchrödinger to try to make sense of it all.Together, Einstein and Schrödinger alighted on two thought experiments that havebecome the touchstones for quantum strangeness. They are known as ‘Schrödinger’scat’, and ‘EPR’ (where the P and the R refer to Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen,the colleagues who helped Einstein formulate his ideas).Schrödinger’s cat goes back to the equation that bears his name. Apply it to aradioactive source, such as a lump of radium, and it gives a probability that anatom within the radium will decay, emitting a burst of radiation, within acertain time. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, until that decay ismeasured the atom is in a superposition of decayed and not-decayed. In 1935,Schrödinger published a paper containing a novel thought experiment thatEinstein considered the ‘prettiest way’ to show the incompleteness of quantumtheory. In it, the radium is placed next to a radiation detector that causes ahammer to fall when it detects a burst of radiation. If the hammer falls, itsmashes a vial of cyanide. Next to the vial is a live cat. Should the vial ofcyanide be smashed, the cat will inhale the toxic gas and die. All of this isheld within a closed box so that no one can tell whether the cat is dead oralive.Now, instead of a superposition of different photon trajectories, as in thedouble slit experiment, we have a superposition of live and dead cat. The radiumatom’s decayed-and-not-decayed state — a reasonable scenario within the normalparameters of quantum theory — has been strung out into an absurdity. Clearly,Schrödinger said (and Einstein agreed), this shows that something is missingfrom quantum theory.If it was missing then, it still is now. We could have endless discussions aboutthe question of measurement. Does the cat seeing the hammer fall count as ameasurement? If Schrödinger opens the box with his eyes closed, is that ameasurement? The simple truth is that no one has resolved this paradox. Wesimply live with it.The second thought experiment — EPR — has been resolved, but not in a way thatmakes the quantum world an easier place to understand. Einstein’s EPR paper waspublished in 1935, the same year as the Schrödinger’s cat paradox. Its title was‘Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?’The answer that it suggested, using a simple setup, is a resounding ‘no’.EPR is, essentially, this: imagine two quantum particles, A and B, that brieflyinteract, then move away from each other. The way the mathematics of theSchrödinger equation work out — including a significant contribution from theimaginary numbers — means that an interaction between two particles leaves themas somewhat altered entities. They are now one system and the properties of onecannot be separated from the properties of the other.According to the Schrödinger equation, the interaction creates a new quantumstate, one that Schrödinger called ‘entangled’. Entanglement, he said, is the‘defining trait’ of quantum theory, setting it apart from any other field ofphysics. Once the particles are entangled, they have no individual existence.Though they might become physically separated, the information needed todescribe their various properties fully — and thus to make predictions about theoutcomes of measurements on either one — is shared between them.As Einstein and Schrödinger noted, this had very odd repercussions. Perform ameasurement on one, turning its inherent, random potential into a definedproperty, and you have also affected the outcome of a subsequent measurement onthe other. The mathematics of the link between them — the entanglement — meanstheir properties on measurement will be ‘correlated’. That might not seemstrange at first glance, but delve into the implications and you’ll soon see whyEinstein called it ‘spooky’.Imagine those two measurements were carried out within a split second of eachother, with the particles extremely widely separated in space. So widely, infact, that there is no way that a signal travelling from one to the other,limited as it would be by the speed of light, can allow one measurement toinfluence the outcome of the second.Now let’s focus on the details of the measurement. EPR uses the fact thatposition and momentum share what is known as ‘an uncertainty relation’. We’llget into the details of this oddity later; for now, let’s simply use the factthat, if we measure the position of particle A precisely, there is a concomitantfuzziness to its momentum. If we measure A’s momentum, the position becomesuncertain. Now apply that to entangled particles and the Schrödinger equationtells you that the choice of measurement — position or momentum — on particle Awill immediately affect the outcome of a measurement on B. The two are‘correlated’, in other words. Instantaneously, B somehow knows which property —its position or momentum — must be precisely defined. That is true regardless ofwhether A is on Earth and B is on the surface of Mars. A signal travelling atthe speed of light — the maximum speed of the universe — would take thirteenminutes to pass between A and B, so there is no way for B to ‘know’ how itshould behave. That’s why Einstein dismissed this whole thing as impossible‘spooky action at a distance’.In their paper, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen made it clear how they felt. ‘Noreasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this,’ they said.They argued that there must be something missing from the Schrödinger equation —that quantum theory was, as yet, incomplete, with some missing information theycalled ‘hidden variables’ waiting to be included.They were wrong, as it turns out.In 1964, an Irishman called John Bell formalised Einstein’s objections and laidout an explicit test for the existence of the hidden variables. He started withpairs of entangled particles — two photons, say, that have interacted at somepoint in the past. These photons now have shared properties — that is, a fulldescription of photon A involves some of the characteristics of photon B, andvice versa.According to standard quantum theory, a measurement on photon A produces arandom result, something like a coin flip. But according to the Schrödingerequation, the entanglement means a measurement on photon A will instantaneouslyaffect what you’ll get as the result of a measurement on photon B — even if theyare millions of light years apart. So the result of measurement B is not quiterandom when compared against the value yielded by a measurement on A. Is thatbecause there are as yet undiscovered properties — hidden variables — in A and Bthat correlate the outcomes of the measurements? Or is there really something inquantum theory that spookily defies our cherished notions of space and time?Bell thought up a way to tell if the results are determined by hidden variablesor by random processes. His setup is complex and subtle, but you can imagine itas a hypothetical team sport, based on choosing a type of measurement to performand guessing the outcome.The teams play in two different kinds of universe. Team Einstein makes thechoice of measurements in a common sense universe, where there are hiddenvariables that carry information. These variables are constrained by the laws ofphysics, meaning their influence cannot travel faster than the speed of light.Here, any apparent magical correlation between the outcome of a pair of distantmeasurements is an illusion created by the hidden variables.Team Bohr, meanwhile, is working in a universe where the result of a measurementreally is utterly random, but correlations exist between the two particles’properties that will be manifest once one particle’s properties become definite.The setup of the game runs something like this (I’m only going to be able toconvey a rough impression — the real world version is fiendishly complicated).Each team is composed of two players, one of whom is on Earth and the other onMars. It takes thirteen minutes for a signal limited by the speed of light totravel between them. Each of the players has one of an entangled pair ofphotons. Playing the game involves making measurements: first on the Earth-boundphoton, then on the one on Mars. To avoid accusations of cheating, the secondmeasurement must happen within thirteen minutes of the first, so that there canhave been no communication between the two players, who we’ll call Alice andBob.Having seen the outcome of the first measurement, Alice then chooses to hold upher left or right hand. Bob, who doesn’t know anything about the outcome ofAlice’s measurement, or which hand she has raised, then performs his measurementand chooses a hand to raise depending on the outcome. There are two ways thepair can score a point: either by raising the same hand when the two measurementresults are different, or by raising different hands when the two measurementresults are the same.If you slave your way through all the possibilities, using Jerome’s mathematicsof probability, you can work out that the best that Team Einstein can do intheir common sense universe is score a point on seventy-five per cent of itsplays. But Team Bohr, which is operating in a universe with entanglement, canscore points on eighty-four per cent of its plays. Why? Because entanglementslightly alters the probabilities. The instantaneous, appear-from-nowherecorrelations of entanglement skew the properties of the second photon in a waythat makes it slightly more likely that Bob’s guess about which hand to raisewill be correct. In other words, entanglement means that Team Bohr should alwayswin.To determine which kind of universe we live in, you just have to play the game.It’s possible to do this without going to Mars; you just have to situate yourtwo experimenters far enough apart that the time elapsing between theirmeasurements is less than that needed for communication between them at thespeed of light.The first people to do it properly were Stuart Freedman and John FrancisClauser. They played Bell’s game in 1972 and their results showed clearly thatwe live in Team Bohr’s universe. The players scored points eighty-four per centof the time and there is no way they could do that if they were living in TeamEinstein’s universe.Freedman and Clauser’s experiment showed entanglement is real. The outcome ofthe second measurement was influenced by the choice made in the firstmeasurement. The first photons’ properties materialised at random when measured.But the measurement choice for the first photon instantaneously affected whatwould happen when its entangled twin was measured: its properties were not quiteas random.In the years since that first experiment, we have got better and better atexploring the nature of quantum entanglement. A notable landmark came in 2008,when a Swiss physicist called Nicolas Gisin separated his photons by eighteenkilometres. One was in Jussy, a town east of Geneva. The other was in Satigny, atown to the west. The measurements allowed the players to score pointseighty-four per cent of the time, and the time between measurements was so shortthat any influence would have had to travel at ten thousand times the speed oflight. Entanglement, that phenomenon that is written into the Schrödingerequation and results from the phase and its imaginary numbers, is indubitablyreal.No one knows how it works. The entangled particles are chained together by aconnection that we don’t understand. They may be one particle that manifests inour world in two separate places. They may even be, by some hidden, contortedgeometry of space, right next to each other.We just don’t have any idea of how the measurements can be so well correlated.ψ‘Fate,’ Jerome says.I shrug. ‘Maybe.’As a trained physicist, you might think I shouldn’t believe in fate, but youwould be wrong. I can believe that everything is controlled by an externalinfluence, that all things are ordained, and there is no such thing as a choice.Why? Because Gerard ’t Hooft can believe it. He has a Nobel Prize in Physics, isuniversally respected as one of the smartest physicists on the planet, andbelieves in something called superdeterminism, another selection among theinterpretations of quantum theory.Remember how Jerome once said that wisdom is to ‘say nothing ludicrous’ aboutthe cause of an effect? I am going to have to ignore that advice. We’ll startfrom the premise that quantum mechanics is nothing more than a mathematical toolthat gives you a way to calculate the outcomes of experiments. By the end, youwill have lost all free will and will understand that you are nothing but abiological tool of the universe … Ready?It begins at the beginning of the universe. There was a Big Bang moment and someof the energy of that moment condensed into matter, taking the form of particlesthat went on to create atoms. That means the fundamental particles — theelectrons, quarks, neutrinos, and so on — all had a common origin. In that case,could their common origin have a lasting effect? What if certain aspects oftheir properties are, and always will be, correlated?The consequence would be, essentially, that we are fooling ourselves when wethink we are conducting experiments on uncorrelated, independent, entirelyseparated systems. That is what the superdeterminism interpretation of quantummechanics says: all those conclusions we have drawn about spookiness or weirdsuperpositions are a consequence of our blindness to the threads that connecteverything in the universe.Superdeterminism doesn’t permit randomness. There is always cause and effect. Sowhen a radioactive atom decays, that doesn’t happen at random. There is a reasonfor it — and that reason is tied up in the hidden threads that we can’t access.Similarly, if we prepare two identical atoms in the same state, put them inexactly the same environment, and watch what happens, we may well see twodifferent end results. The Copenhagenists put this down to inherent randomnessin the evolution of quantum systems. Superdeterminists say it’s because you werefooling yourself when you assumed you had prepared the atoms in the same state.You couldn’t have because you have no way of controlling the hidden threads. Andthe difference between the hidden threads controlling the properties of the twoatoms is what gave you two different outcomes. There is no randomness, onlyignorance.Essentially, the superdeterminists’ view is that we are not in control of ourexperiments.There is no way to separate the settings of a detector, say, from the state ofthe particles it is about to detect. So you can try all you like to control yourtest for eighty-four per cent correlations. You can set up and operate yourdouble slit experiment, if you so desire. But who is to say that the atoms ofthe material that is emitting the photons are not linked to the apparatus usedto detect the photons? Maybe a tweak to the emitter tweaks the detector in somehidden way, giving you the illusory result of an interference pattern at thedetector — which makes you think that the photon went through both slitssimultaneously, or that entanglement is real.There is no superposition in the superdeterminists’ view. The photon in thedouble slit experiment is not in two places at once. There is no spooky actionat a distance, either. Those are just shorthand descriptions that make sense ofthe mathematics of quantum theory — and quantum theory, as it currently stands,is not the final answer.The big problem with superdeterminism is philosophical. It requires that scienceis an act of self-delusion because all the atoms of the universe are linked in away that destroys human free will. You’re not free to choose how to tweak theemitter because the atoms in the neurons of your brain are also subject to thosehidden threads. And, by extrapolation, scientists are not freely choosing thetasks they perform. We are just a part of the complex clockwork mechanism ofsubatomic physics. Think of yourself as a cog, with teeth that are enmeshed withthose of another cog. If that cog turns, can you choose not to?This idea has been labelled the ‘ultimate conspiracy theory’. One researcheronce put it to me like this: ‘According to superdeterminism, you’re allowed tosay about any experimental result: “Well, maybe that happened because of agiant, universe-wide conspiracy involving both the particles you measured andthe atoms of your own brain — which allowed the particles to know in advancewhich experiment you were going to do and to get into just the right state,thereby fooling you into thinking that, had you chosen to do a differentexperiment (which is actually impossible, since you lack free will), youwould’ve continued to see results consistent with standard physical theory. Soit all looks like the standard physical theory is valid, but really it’s not.”’It’s safe to say, he wasn’t a fan.Gerard ’t Hooft is unconcerned. His take on superdeterminism is that you canbelieve in the other interpretations if you like, but you won’t ever have asatisfactory explanation for what is going on. There’ll be inexplicablemeasurement-induced collapses, things in two places at once, and spooky actionat a distance. With superdeterminism, you simply assume there’s more to theworld than we can currently see — there is a God’s eye view — and that all theweirdnesses would have a perfectly good explanation if only our experiments wereable to probe things down to the ultimate, fundamental scales of reality.But even then we’d need to use our own brains and they are part of theconspiracy. The brain is a machine made of atoms that have particularproperties, and those properties determine what our conscious state is at anymoment. Those atoms weren’t always inside our skulls: they have been in starsand travelling through intergalactic space. They were part of a water molecule,perhaps, or once skirted the event horizon of a black hole on the other side ofthe universe. Ultimately, they can trace their origins to the moment after theBig Bang, when the universe first saw matter. And the imprints that one atomleft on another back then continue to exert their influence now, even ascarbon-based life forms attempt to construct stories about how the universereally works. Yet even ’t Hooft doesn’t yet fully believe in superdeterminism.There are lots of holes, he admits — although in Vienna he did tell me that it’sthe only explanation that he trusts. ‘I can’t help being disgusted by the ManyWorlds interpretation,’ he said. ‘I want to know what is really going on …’I’d tell you to make up your own mind. But, if ’t Hooft’s suspicions arecorrect, you really can’t.ψ‘I like this idea,’ Jerome says.Of course he does. If it’s right, nothing — his incarceration, the fate of hissons and his wife — is his fault. Everything is outside of his control. I’mtempted to point out that it also means his successes are nothing to glory in.His return from England, for example, gave him enormous satisfaction. Hetravelled through Europe a celebrated man. He effectively went on tour, invitedto visit and be entertained by the most famous doctors, publishers, bishops, andphilosophers of the continent in Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, Louvain, Michelin, andAntwerp. The procession continued to Aix-La-Chapelle, Cologne, Mainz, Worms,Speyer, Strasbourg, and Basel. From there he went on to Berne and Besançon,Zurich, and — finally — Milan.Crowds had lined the streets of Milan in welcome, in stark contrast to Jerome’slong-forgotten return from Gallarate as a penniless pauper with a wife, a youngbaby, and a trolley of books. ‘Now they put up bowers for me to pass under andmy treasure-boxes are great enough to be drawn on a cart flanked by guardsmen,’he wrote of the occasion. ‘Where I was despised I am now the chief physician,where I was unknown my skills in medicine, numbers, the stars, wisdom andmachines are everywhere discussed. Honours and awards have been flung at me tillI grow weary of them. Sovereigns of church, palace and battlefield have summonedme to their aid.’Such celebrated success must have been particularly galling for NicoloTartaglia, a man whose reputation had, thanks to Jerome, been in tatters forsome years."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10Let’s skip back a little, to 10 August 1548. For the three years that havepassed since the publication of The Great Art, an ever-more incensed Tartagliahas been trying to goad Jerome into a public debate. Jerome has refused everyrequest, reasoning that he has nothing to gain. Jerome’s student, the hot-headedLodovico Ferrari could not say the same, though, and so has repeatedlychallenged Tartaglia himself. Tartaglia has steadfastly refused the youngupstart; what could he gain from defeating such a nobody?This impasse continues until Tartaglia comes across the opportunity of alifetime: a lectureship in his hometown of Brescia. He applies for the post andis told it is his — on one condition. The faculty are aware of his feud withJerome and Ferrari — everyone is — and have decided to have some sport. AllTartaglia has to do to get the job, they say, is to beat Lodovico Ferrari in amathematical contest.Everything in the Garden of the Frati Zoccolanti in Milan is ready for the duel.The arrangements are spectacular. Don Ferrante di Gonzaga, the governor ofMilan, takes centre stage on the dais, presiding over the day’s festivities. Heis flanked by everyone who is anyone in Milan — scholars, city officers, and thenoblemen of the district, along with their families. Mathematics has never beenso glamorous.The church is looking beautiful and so is the garden. The carpenters have beenhard at work. At the front of the stage are two desks, set facing each other.Behind each desk there is tiered seating for each man’s supporters. Betweenthem, an arrangement of flowers is spread over the grass, a symbol of the sweetatmosphere that this scholarly tussle is meant to maintain.Each competitor will answer sixty-two problems, scientific and mathematical,posed by his opponent. Ferrari, for instance, has asked:Divide eight into two parts such that their product multiplied by theirdifference comes to as much as possible, proving everything.and:There is a cube such that its sides and its surfaces added together are equal tothe proportional quantity between the said cube and one of its faces. What isthe size of the cube?The methods for solution of the problems could be derived from the algebra laidout in The Great Art. But that required some deep thinking, not all of which hadbeen completed. Take this one, for instance:There is a right-angled triangle, such that when the perpendicular is drawn, oneof the sides with the opposite part of the base makes 30, and the other sidewith the other part makes 28. What is the length of one of the sides?The Great Art contained an example of such a problem, but not a general rule forsolving them. This latter problem even defeated Ferrari, as it turned out.According to the rules, that means Ferrari shouldn’t have set it. As Tartagliapoints out. ‘It is a very shameful thing,’ he says, ‘to put forward such aquestion in public, and not to know how to solve it by a general rule. I havethe same opinion of your Problems 26 and 19, but I reserved to myself my replyto you on them, in front of the referees …’In front of the referees, it turns out, Tartaglia is himself somewhat shameful.He is irritable and poorly behaved. As the competition degenerates into a rowdywar of words, Tartaglia is repeatedly urged to ‘resume the dignified mantle ofthe scholar’ by the officials. By the end of the first scheduled day of thecontest, Tartaglia has had enough. It is clear to him that Ferrari has workedharder at algebra than he, and has a better command of it. Some of Ferrari’sproblems, he knows, are beyond his abilities. That night, Tartaglia leavesMilan. In the morning, Ferrari is announced as the victor.The result is a tonic to the careers of both Jerome and Ferrari. The latter isoffered a plum position as tutor to the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Itis a testament to Ferrari’s hot-headedness that he turns the job down,protesting that it is too poorly paid. Clearly impressed by the young man’schutzpah, the Emperor improves his offer. Ferrari can, if he wishes, become taxassessor for Milan, one of the most lucrative positions in the Emperor’s gift.Decades later, Ferrari retires a wealthy man — though it is an enforcedretirement. The position had involved a great deal of horse riding, whicheventually gave Ferrari a career-ending fistula in one buttock.There is a further sting in the tale of Lodovico Ferrari. Though he had risenfrom servant boy to Milan’s chief tax collector, he had not forgotten hisfamily, and had brought his beloved sister, Maddalena, to live with him.However, she betrayed his generosity — and was herself betrayed.In 1560, Maddalena poisoned Ferrari with white arsenic, inherited his riches,and refused to grieve — or so Jerome records it. Fifteen days after herbrother’s death, she married a man who took possession of everything she owned.Within a short time he had abandoned her. Maddalena ended her life in abjectpoverty in a rural hovel. Jerome, in a break from his typical character, showedher not the tiniest indication of pity.‘You cannot betray your family and expect to be pitied.’ Jerome’s expression issteel.‘Even with a family like yours?’Jerome stares at me, but he does not respond.There was a time, as a young man newly qualified in medicine, when Jeromethought he would never father children. He made his doubts public — he didn’tbalk at discussing sexual matters, especially his impotence. In On Subtlety, henotes that ‘it is a help to associate a great deal with pretty girls, and toread an erotic tale,’ but admits that he has on occasion spent three wholenights with a girl, making ‘energetic, if ineffectual, efforts to relieve hiscondition,’ as one biographer tactfully put it.Eating scrapings of bull penis on an empty stomach didn’t help, as he had beenassured it would. ‘I have not yet tested whether an oven-dried wolf penis, ifchewed, can instantly kindle sexual desire and the power of having sexualintercourse,’ he writes. Clearly, he talks about the issue with others. He knowsof a man who ‘would not erect unless he was being beaten, and many who would notunless they were giving a beating’. Others need to suck on a nipple to achieveorgasm. He tells of a man who used a herb imported from the Indus: ‘when he hadchewed it, he could complete sexual intercourse seven times in a day’. ButJerome didn’t have this herb and didn’t know what might cure his impotence.He hadn’t always had a problem. Some of his writings intimate that he’d had sexsuccessfully with a girl when he was eighteen and had liaisons involvingcunnilingus and fellatio — with males and females — before that. He writes aboutenjoying erotica and frequent masturbation. But, by the time he complains abouthis impotence in a letter to a friend, it has clearly been going on for sometime. ‘I maintain that this misfortune is to me the worst of evils,’ he says. ‘Ibitterly weep this misery, that I must needs be a laughing-stock, that marriagemust be denied me, and that I must ever live in solitude.’ He is unable toexplain the cause, but laments that it means he eventually shunned the societyof women, bringing on himself suspicions of ‘still more nefarious practices’.Nonetheless, the advent of the angelic Lucia cured him and he did have children:first Giovanni, then his daughter Chiara, and finally Aldo. All three broughthim a share of sorrow.Giovanni was born to a bad portent, with his curved spine, his webbed toes, andthe wasp at his baptism. No wonder that, when Chiara is born, Jerome remarkswith relief that the horrors of Giovanni’s early years were not repeated: ‘Shewas in no way disfigured as was our firstborn, nor was her baptism marked by anyuntoward incident.’ Her only bad luck was to be unable to conceive children.This was, in time, a severe blow to Jerome, who craved grandchildren. Nor didGiovanni or Aldo have children — but that was the very least of the problemsthey brought him.For starters, Giovanni is quite simply a dullard. Somehow, with heroic effortand no small amount of string pulling, Jerome manages to push him throughmedical school. He then uses his influence to have Giovanni admitted to theMilanese College of Physicians. His son will make a hopeless doctor, Jeromeknows, but even he doesn’t see just how hopeless. Soon after his practicebegins, Giovanni inadvertently administers a fatal dose of poison to a localofficial. ‘That was, indeed, the beginning of all ills,’ is Jerome’s laterdescription.There is no proof that Giovanni meant to kill the clerk, but that is hardly thepoint. What matters is that details of the deed have fallen into the hands ofthe Seroni family.The Seronis were once wealthy. However, the father, Evangelista, has spent everycrown. Destitute and desperate, they have turned to crime. They have never beenknown to miss an opportunity for blackmail — it is something of a speciality —and Giovanni is an opportunity on a silver plate. The silverware in thisinstance belongs, as do many other desirable things, to Jerome. A propositioncomes to Giovanni: you can have your crime exposed to the College of Physicians,or you can marry our Brandonia. Giovanni must have had to think hard. BrandoniaSeroni is fat, plain, bad tempered, and widely known to be promiscuous. She is,as Jerome put it, ‘destitute of all good qualities’: marriage material only forsomeone who had no option. Giovanni accepts the proposal.Jerome only learns of the marriage when it is a fait accompli. A breathlessservant who had been looking for his master pants out the news: Giovanni hascome home with Brandonia as his wife and is looking to set up a household underJerome’s roof. That household, Jerome quickly learned, would include most of theSeroni clan. He can see that the Seronis’ plan is to bleed the wealthy doctor ofall his money and so Jerome refuses to let Brandonia in the house. Giovanni isfurious — and no doubt terrified at what might happen to him if the Seroni plotis foiled. His father refuses to back down, but writes him two books’ worth ofadvice — he calls the volumes Consolation and Adversity — and offers somefinancial support. His letters chastise Giovanni for bringing all this troubleupon himself: ‘for all the ills that now hang over you, your poverty, your wife,your ill repute, your absence from your father’s house, all these I say you haveprepared for yourself willingly and knowingly’.Perhaps that judgement is what drives Giovanni to kill his wife.ψJerome is in his university lodgings at Pavia when the letter from the rector ofthe Milanese College of Physicians arrives. His spidery scrawl states simplythat Giovanni, his younger brother Aldo, and a servant have all been arrested inMilan for the murder of Brandonia Seroni. Jerome is to return to Milanimmediately, the rector says. The good name of the College must be defended.‘He said nothing about defending my sons’ names — nor my own,’ Jerome says.‘Did you ever doubt they were innocent?’Jerome gives me a long stare. ‘I never doubted Giovanni,’ he says. ‘My firstthought was that Aldo must be to blame.’Despite what I have read, I am still shocked at Jerome’s matter-of-fact tone.‘You never thought Aldo might also be innocent?’Jerome shrugs. ‘You don’t know my younger son, do you?’"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11Aldo was born on 25 May 1543. There were no evil omens. ‘A fine child,’ Jeromesaid, ‘with no disfigurement or fault attending him, or any trouble to my wife.’Perhaps that should have taught Jerome the fallibility of his ‘signs andportents’ approach to predicting the future. Just over three years later, Lucia,Jerome’s wife, was dead and the boy was being raised by a nursemaid.In 1546, Lucia had slipped into sickness. Jerome mentions a ‘decline’, a‘paleness’ and ‘lassitude’, but little else. Towards the end of that year, shedied, aged thirty-three. Lucia’s passing seemed to happen in the background.Jerome writes more about the syphilis-ridden genitals of his friend OttavianoScoto than he did about the illness that robbed him of the love of his life.Perhaps some things are too painful to dwell upon. ‘She was brave, indomitablein spirit, gentle, affectionate, fine to look upon,’ he wrote. And that was it —as if he could bear to write no more. She had captured his affection for sixteenyears, suffered poverty and loss, seen her jewels gambled away, enjoyed a fewyears of prosperity, and then, aged thirty-three, she was gone. Jerome was leftalone with his children.Aldo grew up in the care of a servant and he did not grow up well. He was brutaland cruel to the household animals, of whom there were plenty — Jerome is fondof creatures. In his early teens, Aldo developed a habit with the dice, but hadnone of his father’s skill with numbers. When the addiction raged, it turned himtowards the life of a criminal. First he stole from his father’s household andthen, when possessions began to be more securely locked away at home, he robbedothers. His father despaired at the money he spent bribing the authorities tolet Aldo out of jail: ‘thousands of crowns to release him from just punishment’.Yet if Jerome found things missing from the house, it can’t have given him anyless grief to find the things Aldo occasionally left strewn about the place.They were receipts for work carried out, but not the kind of work to warm afather’s heart. ‘Messr Aldo Cardano, public executioner, for torturing by rackand vice, Valentino Zuccaro, 3 scudi. And to the same for having in due courseburnt Zuccaro and thrown the cinders of his flesh into the river, a further 7scudi.’Aldo is now a freelance torturer, working — when the opportunity arose — for theInquisition.ψJerome is to hurry back to Milan, the rector writes. Jerome must put everyeffort into supporting his sons’ exoneration, ‘that their innocence may bedefended with that of the name of this learned College, lest it fall intodisrepute by association’. The letter is blatantly self-serving and the irony isnot lost on Jerome. He had barely been elected to the College because of theshame of his bastardy. Suddenly, when the growth of his fame has brought theCollege a reflected glory, he is the one called to defend its reputation; ‘Now,bastard or no, I was commanded to still the fluttering in the dovecotes ofrespectability,’ he later recalled. There is no wry smile here, for Jerome isutterly wretched at the woeful predicament of his children. ‘I cared no more formy credit in Milan or the world,’ he wrote later. ‘I cared only to throw all myinfluence at the feet of my sons.’ And so he sets out, determined to defendthem. ‘A man sixty years old, greyheaded and bent, is no less able to plead withjudges,’ he says.The crime, as laid out by the prosecution, is the poisoning of Brandonia Seroniby arsenic that was baked into a cake. But no fewer than five doctors from theself-serving Milanese College of Physicians are on hand to testify thatBrandonia had not died by arsenic poisoning; the appearance of the corpse is allwrong, if these fine upstanding members of society are to be believed. Arsenicpoisoning blackens the tongue, they say; it lifts the fingernails and corrodesthe internal organs. None of this is true of Brandonia’s body, they report. Intheir learned conclusion, Brandonia had been suffering from lipyria, a wastingdisease. This, they insist, is the true cause of death.The Seroni family are having none of it. With a flourish, their lawyers bringout the servant who baked the cake. He overheard Aldo and Giovanni plotting, hesays. He was handed a vial of liquid to put in the cake mixture, he had bakedthe cake and served it to his mistress; she vomited immediately.The doctors counter that Giovanni, being a qualified doctor, must have intendedthe mixture as a treatment for some malady his wife was suffering and that suchtreatments do occasionally cause accidental harm. White arsenic, they point out,is a treatment for lipyria. Perhaps Giovanni had simply erred in the dosage?A stalemate ensues. Then, several days into the trial — out of the blue —Giovanni confesses to premeditated murder. This, he announces, was his thirdattempt to kill his wife; the first two times he tried, the poison failed to doits job.Until this point, Jerome has not been allowed to speak in his son’s defencebecause the law does not permit relatives to offer evidence. Now, with the courtdebating only motive, Jerome is permitted to address the assembly. What a shame,then, that oratory was not his gift and that, aged twelve, he had abandoned thestudy of persuasion.As a young boy, Jerome had decided to follow a path of medicine and mathematics,rather than the law. ‘I had had enough and enough of law; its books, by myexperience, were heavy and its conclusions unsatisfactory … numbers I thoughtgreatly of for what they could prove.’ At this juncture in the trial, the oldman, now in his fifty-ninth year, must have suffered a twinge of regret aboutthat decision because he turned out to be a poor advocate for his son.Even by the standards of the day, Jerome’s two hour speech is odd. He arguesthat poisoning is barely murder — at least the boy hadn’t stabbed his wife,which would have been far worse. Then he addresses the character of the victim.Brandonia was no saint, as everybody knew. Jerome rakes through the dead woman’slist of crimes without mercy or respect for the deceased. She was an unfitmother who had let her first child die through neglect. She had given birth totwo more children during the marriage whom Jerome, worried for their safety, wasnow raising. What’s more, she had openly told Giovanni during the course of aheated row that neither child was his. Her mother, who was in the room at thetime, backed up Brandonia and went so far as to name the fathers who hadcuckolded Jerome’s son. Such provocation, he argues, almost justifies his son’scrime. His speech was a character assassination that must have stirred venom inthe hearts of her family.And then comes the condemnation of Aldo. Giovanni, Jerome tells the court, isjust too simple-minded to have hatched such a plot. He must have been under theinfluence of his wicked younger brother, who probably persuaded him to confess,too. ‘Surely my son is worthy of excuse and pardon,’ Jerome cries to the courtin his impassioned summation. ‘A youth as simple of wit as any in the state … Heis so simple that I take no more thought in the buying of my shoes than he tookin the marrying of his wife … Was he not foolish, if he meant murder, inchoosing as his confidants a mischievous brother and a servant boy who wouldbreak any silence for reward … Would you sacred senators inflict death on alunatic who in a lucid interval killed a man?’To be fair to Jerome, his sons had, up to that point, served as each other’saccomplices. They had worked together to strip their father’s house of saleableassets and no doubt had split the proceeds. Aldo had to pay off his gamblingdebts to avoid being murdered by his benefactors. Giovanni, if he could not takehis in-laws into the house, would take the house — or at least its contents — tohis in-laws. Brandonia had even handed her father her wedding ring, a gift thatJerome had made to his son, so that her father could sell it.It is worth noting that, by the time Jerome accuses Aldo, the old man isaltogether wrung out. He has spent all his money on Giovanni’s defence. He hasargued for two hours in his elder son’s favour. He is tired and emotional.Somewhat oddly — and possibly self-defeatingly — Jerome then switches to laudingGiovanni’s academic achievements: ‘Is he not a baccalaureat, a man honoured byAcademy and College … He is a learned man in his profession. Is the head maturedand educated by so many nights of toil to be cut off like the head of a man asignorant of yesterday as of tomorrow?’His closing words, tears running down his face, are a straightforward plea forhis son’s life. ‘O Sacred senators, you cannot condemn a son to the galleyswithout condemning to a worse fate the father, who is innocent; and to kill himwould be a fate worse than death to me. I beseech you therefore, that if youprove him guilty you sentence him to perpetual exile, and spare him his life anddignity. For in that way you will also spare mine.’The pleas fall on deaf ears. The Senate sentences Giovanni to death. The onlyway out, the court says, is if the Seronis could be satisfied with financialcompensation — and they are to name their price. ‘They demanded,’ Jeromerecalls, ‘more gold and treasure than could be found in the coffers of a king.’They know he can’t meet their demands — for once, money came second. They arefar more interested in humiliating Jerome and witnessing the execution of hisworthless son.As it turned out, there were no public witnesses. Jerome’s twenty-six-year-oldson was executed within the prison walls that same night. On 8 April 1560,Jerome takes delivery of his son’s decapitated body. Brandonia’s daughter diesin the same week, quickly followed by the nurse whom Jerome had hired to lookafter his daughter-in-law’s children.In the space of seven days, the broken old man has arranged and funded threefunerals.‘It must have been appalling. I can’t imagine how that feels.’I am sat on one end of Jerome’s straw mattress; he is lying, curled up in aball, at the other. He doesn’t respond straight away; he has told me the storyof his son’s demise. Even though those events unfolded a full decade ago, therevisiting of it has exhausted him. I sit in silence. After ten minutes, hepulls himself upright and, hands holding the green jewel to his lips, turns hishead towards me.‘Do you have children?’ he says.‘Two,’ I reply. ‘A girl and a boy.’‘How would you feel to lose one?’‘I think it would crush me,’ I say. ‘I don’t think I would ever recover.’‘I am certain I will not,’ he says.ψCertainty is always misguided. It is something we use to comfort ourselves, adelusion we often indulge in the wake of disaster. We become certain ‘some goodwill come of this’, or — as in Jerome’s case — that recovery is impossible.Perhaps it says something about humans that we never feel certain about anythingwhen life is going well. A state of happiness is rarely taken for granted. That,perhaps, is when we are at our most perceptive because the appalling truth isthat uncertainty is inherent to the cosmos.There is a chapter in Jerome’s autobiography called ‘The Disasters of My Sons’.Within its few short pages, Jerome describes Giovanni’s calamitous marriage andeventual execution, and ‘the folly, the ignominious conduct, and violentactions’ of his younger son, Aldo. He is not seeking pity — Jerome writes thathe is ‘by no means unaware that these afflictions may seem meaningless to futuregenerations, and more especially to strangers’ — but wants to make a point.There is, he says, nothing in this mortal life ‘except inanity, emptiness, anddream-shadows’. The only basis on which mortals can find a firm foundation fortheir lives is to extract wisdom from significant events. Within the greatadversities of life, Jerome argues, ‘mortal things may find, now here, nowthere, new meaning and testify that they are destined for a purpose and a usenot to be despised’.It seems like a reasonable attitude. But quantum theory tells us it is utterlymistaken. So far, we have stated that God does play dice, that there is nopattern or purpose behind the cosmic drama of existence. Now we are about todelve deeper into the mathematics behind the Schrödinger equation and discoverwhy. The fundamental rules of the universe — rules that Jerome helped toformulate, let’s remember — tell us that the universe only exists because of arandom event. Even the formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and people isdependent on random chance. If quantum theory is to be believed, there is nopurpose except that which we deluded beings construct for ourselves.I am talking about quantum theory’s ‘uncertainty principle’. We skirted thisearlier, when we talked about entanglement, but this seems a good moment to faceit head on.The uncertainty principle may be the least understood concept in physics, whichis somewhat ironic. It is nothing to do with practical problems, such aserror-prone measurements. It starts from the mathematics behind the Schrödingerequation, which says that multiplying a by b is not the same as multiplying b bya. That sounds ridiculous when we are used to a world in which three times fivegives the same answer as five times three. But this quantum world, as we arediscovering, is very different from our own.In the Schrödinger setup, the things we seek to multiply together are notstraightforward numbers, but pairs of quantities such as a particle’s position(we’ll call it p) and its momentum (which we’ll call q, so as not to confuse itwith the shorthand for mass). In this notation, multiplication is denoted byputting two things next to each other. So position times momentum is pq. Andthat is not the same as qp. Why? Because the mathematical rules that governoperations with the Schrödinger equation are not the same as standardmultiplication.The difference between pq and qp is given by a simple quantity. It involvesPlanck’s constant (h), Jerome’s imaginary square root of -1 (i) and π. Inmathematical notation, that is: pq – qp = h/2πi.There are other forms of the Schrödinger equation where different pairingsfollow the same rule. Energy and time, for example, make another such couple.The upshot of all of them is that it is impossible to calculate a precise valuefor both parts of a pair. If I am applying the equation to an atom and I want toknow its position precisely, I have to sacrifice accurate knowledge of itsmomentum — and vice versa. The more accurately I know one of these quantities,the less accurately I know the other.This unavoidable gap in our knowledge is not a consequence of some inability tomake accurate measurements. It is written into the theory. And it means that youcan’t ever predict the future state of a quantum system. That’s because youcan’t plug exact values for all its properties into an equation that will letyou work out how its state will evolve. There will always be some uncertainty inthe sum of the starting conditions, so you will always be uncertain about itsfuture.That said, there is a link to the practicalities of measuring thesenot-exactly-wave, not-exactly-particle objects. If we want to find an object’sposition, for instance, we have to bounce something off it — a photon of light,say. But the very act of bouncing a photon off the object will give it a kick,altering its momentum. So we have gained information about position at the costof obscuring information about its momentum at that moment. Similarly, findingits momentum involves measurements at two different times in two differentplaces, which means the associated position is rather vague — by the time ourmomentum measurement is in, the position has changed. Another source ofuncertainty.Finally, it is worth noting that the principle seems to be linked to thephenomenon of entanglement. You can use quantum mathematics to show that twoentangled objects — that is, two objects that have distributed the informationabout themselves between the two of them — are less subject to the uncertaintyprinciple than two objects that have no connection. Experiments have shown thatthe uncertainty principle applies to the first measurement on one photon of anentangled pair. But when a subsequent measurement is done on the second photonof the pair, the information gained about the state of the first one is moreprecise than came in the first measurement. Repeat that process, and you canknow the state of the first photon to arbitrary precision.Given that entanglement defeats our understanding of space and time, there islittle point trying to make full sense of the uncertainty principle. But it doesseem to be fundamental and related to issues of the amount of informationcarried by quantum objects and their entanglement partners.Uncertainty and entanglement are also somehow related to the second law ofthermodynamics, which says that every process in the universe tends towardsproducing disorder. It seems to be a fundamental, defining principle behind theway the universe operates — classically and quantumly. Imagine the position andmomentum of an electron as two intertwined streams of information, each oneencoded so that the more you read of one, the less you can read of the other.Essentially, it’s another formulation of the uncertainty principle. However,working from the Schrödinger equation and our knowledge of thermodynamics,researchers have shown that the energy of the electron is related to theinformation needed to describe it, and the information uncertainty prevents youfrom extracting more energy than the system contains. In other words, withoutthe uncertainty principle, we would break the second law of thermodynamics.Nothing has ever broken the second law. The physicist Arthur Eddington once saidyou should never back an idea that opposes it. ‘If your theory is found to beagainst the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope,’ he said,‘there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.’ Quantumtheory, though, is safe.What is this telling us? Somehow, the Schrödinger equation and its answer to deBroglie’s challenge about everything having both wave-like and particle-likeproperties, has tapped into something that is utterly fundamental to theuniverse, more fundamental even than space and time. This fundamentaluncertainty is more than an abstract notion or an impediment to our experiments.Its application to the energy and time associated with quantum objects affectstheir very existence. It means there is no such thing as completely empty space,for instance, because that would imply that the universe had precisely zeroenergy and nothing can have a precise value of anything. A consequence of thisis that, for a short enough time, the universe will lend energy to a particle sothat it can come into being. And so the emptiness is filled with a constantlyappearing and disappearing set of ‘virtual’ particles.These virtual particles have real, physical effects. One is known as the Casimireffect. To see this, put a pair of metal sheets next to each other in a vacuum.They will move towards each other because the virtual particles appearing in theempty space will create tiny electric fields that interact with the electrons inthe metal. The geometry of those fields differs depending on whether theparticles are confined between the plates or in the empty space on either sideof them. The difference between those geometries means the plates feel a forcethat pulls them together. And so they move. The movement was first measured in1948: it is real and so, therefore, is the fundamental uncertainty in theuniverse that was revealed by the Schrödinger equation.But this fundamental uncertainty doesn’t just apply to events within ouruniverse. It applies to the universe itself. The physicist’s explanation for thecosmos’s existence is that it came into being because of an uncertainty insomething outside the physical space of the universe. Maybe a type of Hilbertspace, or Jerome’s aevum — we don’t really know. But, as in the Casimir effect,that uncertainty led to a moment of spontaneous creation. We call it the BigBang. When we look at the evidence for the Big Bang — a sea of primordialphotons known as the cosmic microwave background radiation — we see that thereare occasional random fluctuations in the photons’ energy. These fluctuationswere the seeds for the stars and galaxies that led, ultimately, to ourexistence. Life, like the cosmos it inhabits, is born of randomness, and therecan be no such thing as being ‘destined for a purpose’.There is no comfort to be found, Jerome."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12For a decade after his son’s execution on 7 April 1560, Jerome’s life spiralsinto chaos. The first three years are perhaps the gentlest on him. At first, hefeels vindicated by the strange fates that befall those who condemned Giovanni.The president of the court has to feign his own death to avoid prosecution forhis wife’s murder. A senator drowns after falling from a bridge. Another senatorcontracts phthisis, coughs up a lung, and dies. Evangelista, the Seroni family’spatriarch, is jailed, stripped of his position as a debt collector, and becomesa beggar. The prison governor is sacked and is similarly forced to beg on thestreets. The prosecuting counsel loses a son to smallpox and a jurisconsult whogathered evidence against the Cardanos is jailed for corruption. ‘Of all thosewho brought accusation against my son not one escaped without some terriblecalamity — being either smitten or destroyed,’ Jerome recalls.Soon after all this, perhaps because of it, Jerome is greeted everywhere withsuspicion. He still holds academic positions in Milan and Pavia, but he hasbecome someone to avoid. ‘As I walked about the city men looked askance at me;and whenever I might be forced to exchange words with anyone, I felt that I wasa disgraced man.’ Aware of the atmosphere, he withdraws from society. ‘I had nonotion what I should do, or where I should go. I cannot say whether I was morewretched in myself than I was odious to my fellows.’Jerome is soon convinced everyone in Milan is plotting to kill him. A return toPavia does nothing to relieve his fears. He becomes a wanderer. It is a time hewill choose not to look back upon when he writes his memoirs. Others makemention of seeing him in Padua, Milan, Bologna, and Pavia, but Jerome leaves norecord of what he did in those cities or what impels him to move between them.He writes: terrible ravings, most of them, philosophical volumes strewn withnonsensical rants and asides. But there are gems, too, in the form of geometry,philosophical, and medical textbooks that will be the standard texts for decadesto come. His readers will include Johannes Kepler, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,and William Shakespeare. Scholars of the Bard have even identified an Englishtranslation of Consolation, Jerome’s three volume meditation on dealing withtragedy and disappointment, as the book Hamlet carries during the soliloquy thatbegins ‘To be or not to be …’POLONIUS: What do you read, my lord?HAMLET: Words, words, words.What words? ‘In holy scripture, death is not accounted other than sleep, and todie is said to sleep,’ says Jerome in Consolation. ‘Seeing, therefore, with suchease men die, what should we account of death to be resembled to anything betterthan sleep…’ Hamlet, for his part, says, ‘To die, to sleep / — no more — and bya sleep to say we end / The heartache and the thousand natural shocks / Thatflesh is heir to …’I could cite more examples, none entirely conclusive. But in 1807, FrancisDouce, Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum, said, ‘Whoever will take thetrouble of reading the whole of Cardanus as translated by Bedingfield will soonbe convinced that it had been perused by Shakspeare.’ Six years later, JosephHunter, author of New Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings ofShakespeare, cited passages of Jerome’s Consolation that ‘seem to approach sonear to the thoughts of Hamlet that we can hardly doubt that they were in thePoet’s mind when he put [certain speeches] into the mouth of his hero’.Anyway, all that is in the future. In the present, Jerome must live with adebilitating paranoia. Wooden beams and lead weights, he believes, have beenbalanced above doors so as to fall on his head. At mass, he thinks that thechoirboys are whispering plans to poison the wicked old doctor. This, heremembers, for he writes it in a chapter of his autobiography entitled ‘Perils,Accidents, and Manifold, Diverse, and Persistent Treacheries.’ In the end heoutlives all his would-be assailants: ‘all who sought my life perished,’ hesays. He cannot avoid calamity forever, though.As 1563 draws to a close, the Milanese College of Physicians withdraws his rightto teach. Jerome is accused, by numerous witnesses and in sworn statements, ofsodomy and incest. There is no trial, just a sentence. Now, aged sixty-three, heis an exile from Milan. ‘Reduced once more to rags, my fortune gone, my incomeceased, my rents withheld, my books impounded, my only companions prejudice andcalumny,’ he writes. He resides in a Padua workhouse for a time. He is permittedto treat plague victims at a monastery in nearby Gallarate, but no other work isforthcoming — and the shadow of the Inquisition is looming larger. AcrossEurope, thinkers and writers are being arrested, questioned, and sometimestortured and executed in an attempt to quell the growing tide of dissent againstthe Church. These days, if you have published novel, provocative ideas, you canbe sure they will have been read by the Inquisitors. And if you are withoutfriends or money, you are unlikely to survive their attention unscathed.ψThe spirit of the Inquisition has never been fully extinguished, as David Bohmwould testify if he were still among us. During the latter part of World War II,when he was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, Bohm’sPhD supervisor, J Robert Oppenheimer, recruited him into the newly formed effortto build an atomic bomb. Bohm’s contributions to the Manhattan Project were sovaluable that they were immediately classified and Bohm was shut out, not evenbeing allowed to write his own PhD thesis. He did get his PhD, though, afterinsisting that Oppenheimer vouch for the quality of his work.By 1950, Bohm was working with Einstein at Princeton, where his past came backto haunt him. Early in his PhD studies he had joined a trade union and, briefly,a couple of communist groups. Those communist associations, coupled with thenational security implications of his PhD work, made him a target for SenatorJoe McCarthy’s crusade against un-American activities.Bohm refused to answer questions, and refused to name anyone that theMcCarthyists should investigate. He was arrested. By the time he was acquitted,he had been suspended from Princeton. In 1951, unemployable in the UnitedStates, Bohm took a job in Brazil. The US authorities then confiscated hispassport and he was forced to apply for Brazilian citizenship. It was as aBrazilian that he travelled to England and began a long career as a professor oftheoretical physics at Birkbeck College in London. There, he successfullyapplied for a British passport. Then, in 1986, he won back his Americancitizenship in a legal battle with the US government.Nothing in that long and painful saga distracted David Bohm from physics. Hemade significant contributions in a variety of areas, but it is for hisinterpretation of quantum physics that he is best known. In 1952, Bohm publisheda seminal paper that is now seen as a complementary, but independently derived,version of work begun decades before — and then abandoned — by Louis de Broglie.Let’s go back to the experiment where we fire those quantum arrows through thoseslits and get a weird pattern. While the Copenhagenists would say the arrowshave no definite position or momentum until they hit the target, de Broglieformulated another idea, written up in his 1924 dissertation. He brought it upagain when he gave a talk in October 1927, at the same meeting where Einsteinand Bohr had their famous debates over quantum theory. In his talk, he spokeabout the ‘théorie de l’onde pilote’ — pilot wave theory.According to de Broglie, each photon fired at the double slit exists as a realobject. He suggested it has a definite position and momentum at all times. Whatyou can’t know is the initial position. And since the initial position would bewhat you combine with the momentum to give you the final position, you can’tknow the final position in advance, explaining the apparently random outcomes ofeach measurement.Because it is a real object, with a well-defined position, the photon can passthrough only one of the slits. However, its trajectory is guided by a ‘pilotwave’, in much the same way that a ferry entering a treacherous harbour isguided by a pilot boat. This pilot wave is also real and has properties that area reflection of the wave function in the Schrödinger equation.Because of this link to the Schrödinger equation’s wave function, although theparticle will only pass through one of the slits, there is still a finaldistribution of particles determined by an interfering wave. That means themajor consequence of interference — the strange clumping at certain points onthe target and absence at others — will occur.Eventually, de Broglie abandoned his idea and became a Copenhagenist. It wasn’tthat the pilot wave theory was particularly flawed; it was just that Bohr wasprobably too powerful and charismatic a figure to resist. So the pilot wavetheory sank.In 1952, however, it resurfaced in the hands of David Bohm. Bohm’s idea of aninvisible, undetectable pilot wave was roundly criticised, but a man who hadsurvived the McCarthy witch hunts was not easily put off. Having overcome themost heinous character assassination of the era, he could take a little heat.And so he stuck to his guns, suggesting we needed to look at quantum experimentsin a different way. In a 1952 paper, published in Physical Review, he said, ‘thehistory of scientific research is full of examples in which it was very fruitfulindeed to assume that certain objects or elements might be real, long before anyprocedures were known which would permit them to be observed directly.’ In otherwords, why shouldn’t there be an as-yet-undiscovered pilot wave?Of course, we must avoid postulating a new element for each new phenomenon. Butan equally serious mistake is to admit into the theory only those elements whichcan now be observed … In fact, the better a theory is able to suggest the needfor new kinds of observations and to predict their results correctly, the moreconfidence we have that this theory is likely to be good representation of theactual properties of matter and not simply an empirical system especially chosenin such a way as to correlate a group of already known facts.So far, so good, perhaps. But there are two problems. The first is that, inorder to get the predictions right about the interference effect and theultimate distribution of the photons at the detector, you have to work backwardsfrom the final result.The second problem is that Bohm’s pilot wave is odd — in a way that physicistscall ‘nonlocal’. This means that the properties and future state of our photonare not determined solely by the conditions and actions in its immediatevicinity. The photon’s pilot wave and the photon’s wave function are linked tothe wave function of the much, much larger system in which they sit — the wavefunction of the whole universe, effectively. So our photon can beinstantaneously affected by something that happens half a universe away.Many physicists — most physicists — are not happy about allowing this nonlocalaction. After all, such action is prohibited by Einstein’s special theory ofrelativity, which says an influence can’t travel faster than the speed of light.On the plus side, it does give us an explanation for entanglement-basedphenomena. And it’s not clear that accepting Bohmian mechanics is any worse thanshoehorning entanglement into a relativity-friendly physics. Many finephysicists are certainly happy to talk in terms of Bohmian mechanics. In Vienna,for instance, an experimenter called Aephraim Steinberg explained hisexperimental results from a Bohm-eyed view; this, he says, is the easiest way tothink about it. What Steinberg presented was a picture showing the trajectoriesof photons as they pass through the double slit apparatus. In the Copenhageninterpretation, remember, this is impossible because the photons have nomeaningful existence before they are detected. Without an existence, they can’tlogically have a trajectory.So how did Steinberg come up with the photons’ trajectories? The answer is, byusing Yakir Aharonov’s weak measurement. All things are indeed connected.The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum physics, as it is now known, isnot popular. Only one venerated physicist has ever really championed it: JohnBell, the Irishman who came up with the test for the existence of entanglement.Here’s what Bell had to say:While the founding fathers agonized over the question ‘particle’ or ‘wave’, deBroglie in 1925 proposed the obvious answer ‘particle’ and ‘wave’. Is it notclear from the smallness of the scintillation on the screen that we have to dowith a particle? And is it not clear, from the diffraction and interferencepatterns, that the motion of the particle is directed by a wave? De Broglieshowed in detail how the motion of a particle, passing through just one of twoholes in screen, could be influenced by waves propagating through both holes.And so influenced that the particle does not go where the waves cancel out, butis attracted to where they cooperate. This idea seems to me so natural andsimple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way,that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored.Bell felt de Broglie-Bohm was a better bet than anything the Copenhagenists hadto offer. They had elevated the issue of measurement to the status where it wasfundamental to the subject without ever making clear what it actually entailed.‘The concept of “measurement” becomes so fuzzy on reflection,’ Bell said, ‘thatit is quite surprising to have it appearing in physical theory at the mostfundamental level … does not any analysis of measurement require concepts morefundamental than measurement? And should not the fundamental theory be aboutthese more fundamental concepts?’Bell is widely venerated. Go to quantum physics conferences and his name comesup again and again, with some people quoting from his writings as if fromscripture. He has the advantage, from the fame perspective, of having diedsuddenly and relatively young. A cerebral haemorrhage took him out of the bluein 1990, aged just sixty-two. But even his influence is not enough. When itcomes to quantum interpretations, the Copenhagenists appear to have won the day.How? By sheer weight of personality.Niels Bohr, in particular, was so influential that he controlled much of thefunding available for quantum research. He was also a likeable character: peopleenjoyed his company, craved his approval, and tended to bow to his way ofthinking. Too little is made of the importance of personality in science. Somehave called Bohr a bully, but unfairly, I think: he was simply persistent inarguments and reluctant to change his mind. In one lengthy discussion he reducedWerner Heisenberg to tears. In another, Schrödinger fell ill while staying atBohr’s house, took to his bed, but was still harangued by his host, who sat onthe edge of the bed and continued their argument.ψ‘One man can change everything,’ Jerome says, looking around his cell.I assume he is thinking of Nicolo Tartaglia. ‘Yes,’ I say. ‘It is astonishingwhat The Stammerer has done to you.’ My eyes burn through the gloom of the cell,aching with pity for poor Jerome. Tartaglia, his every action toxic with malice,has arranged for the full weight of the Holy Church to fall on Jerome. ‘He hasfinally wreaked his revenge.’Jerome looks at me, puzzled. ‘I don’t think so,’ he says.My eyes narrow in protest. ‘Yes. It was Tartaglia who alerted the authorities,who oversaw your arrest. With your son. Aldo traded your freedom for a post withthe Inquisition.’‘What makes you think that?’‘I read it. In a book by a journalist called Alan Wykes.’Jerome shakes his head. ‘I can believe it of Aldo,’ he says. ‘Aldo would do allyou suggest, I agree.’ Jerome’s eyes are narrow, staring intently toward me asif attempting to diagnose my mental state. I can feel that something is wrong.‘But?’‘But Tartaglia has been dead for more than a decade.’I don’t know what to say."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13I’m so embarrassed. How could I have fallen for Wykes’s fabrication? For all mysupposed knowledge of the universe, Jerome has exposed my utter foolishness.Surely Wykes hasn’t just shifted the date of Tartaglia’s death to fit with hisown desire for a satisfying narrative? I have no choice but to dig for answers.Alan Wykes wrote a slew of books. Would anyone have kept his notes? I can’t helpthinking of my own family; it seems a long shot that they would keep mine afterI’m gone.An internet search tells me many things. Wykes died in 1993 after a long careeras an ‘author, journalist, raconteur and professional clubman’. He was ‘aprolific storyteller with a prodigious memory for historical detail’. But peopledid question his reliability. A book on the composer Lord Berners had peoplegrasping for Wykes’s sources for certain anecdotes: it turns out he learned thestories at second or third hand and they remained uncorroborated. Similarly, hisvolume on Adolf Hitler contained the contention that the Führer’s anti-Semitismarose when he contracted syphilis from a Jewish prostitute — an idea roundlydemolished in previous studies. ‘Wykes’s witnesses were either mistaken ordishonest,’ one reviewer says. My suspicion is that the witnesses may not haveexisted.I can find no mention of a surviving spouse or children. But there is the‘clubman’ angle. For more than a quarter of a century, Wykes had been honorarysecretary and chairman of the benevolent fund of the Savage Club, a Londongentleman’s club whose former members included Sir Edward Elgar, Dylan Thomas,and JM Barrie. The internet is a goldmine here too: Mark Twain had once been aguest at the club; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle mentions the Savage Club in The LostWorld; and the fascist Oswald Mosley turned up one evening (as a guest of HenryWilliamson, author of Tarka the Otter), but was immediately asked to leave. Iemail the club. And then, a couple of weeks later, my phone rings and I findmyself speaking to Philip Voke, the man who inherited all of Wykes’s notes andmanuscripts.The two men had met in the 1970s, when Voke moved into the house next door toWykes. The boxes of materials left to Voke after Wykes’s death are now in thepossession of Reading Library. So, within a couple of weeks, I have lunched withVoke at the Savage Club and taken a train to Reading.It is a short walk from Reading station to the Library’s reading room.Adrenaline is pumping through my body as I collect the box I have requested. Ilay out my notebook and pencils — no pens are allowed in the reading room — andopen the box.In the movie of this book, there should be a quiet, apprehensive moment of tightfocus on the box, with perhaps a single instrument sounding out the anticipationin a low tone. But there is no Eureka! moment to merit such drama. I do notunearth a pile of missing notes and sources, and find everything suddenly makingsense. The problem is that the footnotes and references in Wykes’s handwrittenversion of his Doctor Cardano book are the same as in the typescript, which arethe same as in the published version — with just one exception.The note ‘2’ on page 174 of the published hardback is not in the manuscript orthe typescript. This is the crucial fact. The published book, where the notedoes appear, has no corresponding reference. Had it been there, it would havereferred to the passage where Wykes details Aldo and Tartaglia’s directinvolvement in Jerome’s arrest:On 13th October 1570, at Tartaglia’s instance, Cardano was arrested while inBologna. ‘The boy Aldo, to whom I had promised the reward of the appointment ofpublic torturer and executioner in that city, came to me in Rome with theintelligence that his father was in Bologna awaiting an interview with thesyndics. I thought to myself, “Ah! This will be pleasant, to raise his hopesthat at last the restrictions are to be lifted from him and then, an instantbefore the realisation of those hopes, to cast him into prison.” And so it was.I hastened to Bologna, and there he still sheltered, in the ruins of a hovel,awaiting an ascent to his former status. I instructed the guards to arrest himas he set out for his appointment.’ [2]I can come to only one reluctant conclusion. It is all made up. At the lastminute, perhaps, someone at the publishing house called Wykes and asked that hedeclare his source. They inserted the ‘[2]’ in anticipation of his supplyingsome reference. He never did. How could he? At this point, Tartaglia is longdead, his body lying in the crypt of Venice’s San Silvestro church.Within the box are some pages of handwritten notes that look like an author’ssnagging list. Some are struck through in red ink. On one page I read ‘Aldo —what happened to? Chiara ditto’ and ‘Aldo part of plot with T?’.In the synopsis of chapters, written before embarking on the manuscript, thefacts are laid out unembellished. Wykes has written to his publisher, FrederickMuller Ltd, that he aims to ‘produce a fully documented piece of research thatwould, I hope, be accepted as a serious contribution to historical literature’.There is nothing here about Jerome’s daughter Chiara, whom Wykes’s publishedbook painted as a brazen nymphomaniac. In his narrative, she seduced her olderbrother and rendered herself infertile when she aborted Giovanni’s child. Wykeshas Chiara’s husband complain to Jerome that she has ‘insatiable lusts’ andcarries incurable syphilis that has withered away her charms: ‘she is like adead twig and bears nothing but her pudendum’. Neither is there any mention ofAldo. Even Tartaglia doesn’t merit a mention in the synopsis. Somewhere alongthe path to publication, Alan Wykes succumbed to an ever-present temptation forwriters. He crafted a story that was too good to be true.‘He wasn’t the first.’Jerome seems almost pleased. I am crestfallen to be found wanting in myresearch, and he is trying not to smile. Perhaps it fuels that insatiable desirefor eternal fame: he clearly enjoys being the focus of books written hundreds ofyears after his death. And Jerome is right. The fabrications began even beforehis arrest.In 1557, the year in which Nicolo Tartaglia died, an aspiring intellectual namedJulius Caesar Scaliger published what has been called ‘the most savage bookreview in the bitter annals of literary invective’.Exercitationes comprised a nine hundred page refutation of Jerome’s book OnSubtlety. To be fair, Jerome’s work is a ridiculously wide-ranging book. Withinits thousand pages he discusses the structure of the universe; lactating males(Jerome describes one Antonius Benzes, whom he met in Genoa: ‘thirty-four yearsold, pale, with a scanty beard and a fatty constitution, from whose breasts somuch milk flowed that he could almost have suckled an infant’); attempts atpowered flight (which contains a withering put down of Leonardo da Vinci’sinventive powers: ‘Da Vinci … tried it, and failed; he was an outstandingpainter’); and a recipe for lip salve. On Subtlety meanders and stalls andjumps, but it does entertain. It’s not that bad.It seems that Scaliger was just looking for someone — anyone — to take down. Hewas, after all, a man who raised himself up on the coattails of others. Agedtwelve, he had been page to the Emperor Maximilian. By the time he left theEmperor’s service, aged twenty-nine, he had his eye on the position of Pope, noless. There is talk that he gave this ambition up when he could no longer bearthe company of monks. He went back to soldiering (for the King of France).Eventually, Scaliger married a girl of thirteen who bore him fifteen children.He was, according to one of his children, a ‘terrible’ man, more feared thanloved. And his unpleasantness had not yet run its course.Scaliger’s subsequent literary career was built on attacking the public’sfavourite scholars. Once he had stuck his knife into the much-loved scholarErasmus, Scaliger turned on Jerome. As the 1854 biography written by HenryMorley puts it (I won’t be referring to Wykes again), ‘It was a thick militarybook, full of hard fighting, with no quarter and no courtesy’ and riddled with‘railing, jeering, and rude personal abuse’.At first, Jerome didn’t dignify the attack with a reply. In fact, his silencewas so deafening that some joker told Scaliger that his vitriol had put Jeromein the grave. Taking this wag at his word, Scaliger issued an apology to thepublic. Scaliger’s funereal oration assures Cardano’s fan base (somewhatself-servingly) that ‘the distress of mind occasioned to Jerome Cardano by mytrifling castigations was not greater than my sorrow at his death’. This waseverybody’s loss, he said: ‘the republic of letters is bereft now of a great andincomparable man’.Scaliger goes on for pages and pages. And then, in what must have been amortifying moment, Jerome published a polite and erudite reply to Scaliger’scriticisms without even mentioning his assailant by name.‘That was a nice move,’ I say. ‘You didn’t even give him the satisfaction of acitation.’ With a grin, I swipe my hand away towards the door. ‘Scaliger, youare dismissed.’Jerome looks puzzled again. ‘It wasn’t meant to be dismissive,’ he says. ‘Men ofletters simply ought to act with dignity in their dealings with one another.’Jerome’s dignity certainly did Scaliger no favours. Most contemporaries agreedScaliger suffered a heavy defeat. An eighteenth-century literary scholar calledTiraboschi likened the dispute to a fight between a giant and a girl.Jerome shrugs. ‘I have known girls who fight well,’ he says. ‘My mother, forexample.’It’s not that Jerome is impervious to assault. Later slurs on his character andtalents hit him hard, especially when they took hold in Pavia. Though Milan hadalways caused Jerome grief, the people of Pavia had always been kind andrespectful to Jerome — it was, to him, a place of refuge. But, after Giovanni’sexecution, the mud of Milan still clung fast and there were mutterings among thePavia scholars about whether Jerome’s position should be reconsidered.The Milanese scholars had played a perfect hand. It is in 1562 that Jerome firstlearns that Scaliger had not been the only one who was out to get him. Some ofthe Milanese senators who condemned his son to death two years ago have beenbragging about doing so in a deliberate attempt to drive Jerome mad with grief.Writing of this time, he claims to ‘not know whether I was most wretched or mosthated’.He is not destitute yet, though. He still has a house and a job, at least: he isa Professor at the University and, as a member of the Pavian College ofPhysicians, he can practise medicine to recoup some of the savings that are nowgone. However, Jerome’s lifestyle is making his position even more precarious.His three young lodgers are inciting gossip. They are handsome boys, given tomusic and gambling — passions that Jerome shares and encourages. They arewhispered about as an immoral household. The faculty at Pavia is starting toturn against him.Jerome’s solution is to seek employment in Bologna. There, he approaches CarloBorromeo, a family friend who has risen through the clerical ranks to become acardinal — indeed a saint. Borromeo agrees to help, as does Cardinal Morone,another old friend. With an appointment in Bologna all but secured, Jeromeoffers his resignation to the University of Pavia. The Senate, interpreting theoffer as a rash act by someone in an agitated state of mind, refuses to acceptit.The intrigues are not over. One morning, a courier arrives at his Pavian housewith a letter. It purports to be from his daughter, Chiara, and her husband, ‘amost infamous and vile letter,’ Jerome calls it in his autobiography. In it, thecouple claim to be ashamed of their relationship with Jerome and suggest thatPavia’s Senate and the College should sever all relations with him in reactionto the appalling acts he has committed. Then another condemning letter comes.This is from a colleague at Pavia named Fioravanti. As Jerome recalls, the tenorof it is that ‘he was ashamed of me for the sake of his country, the college,and the faculty; that the rumour was being circulated everywhere that I wasusing my boys for immoral purposes; and that not satisfied with one, I had addedanother to my household — a state of affairs absolutely unprecedented’.Jerome dons his cloak and sweeps out of the house to confront Fioravanti. Theconfrontation works: Fioravanti breaks down and confesses that he wrote theletter purporting to be from Jerome’s daughter and son-in-law, and that he didso on behalf of the rector at the University of Pavia. He also says anaccusation is coming, nonetheless. Immediately, Jerome works out what is goingon. It is another academic tussle. A man called Delfino, a friend of the rectorof Pavia University, has designs on Jerome’s position.The accusation, when it comes, is — predictably — of impropriety with the boysunder his roof. Jerome is pulled into slanging matches in the street, writinglater of the ring of onlookers attracted by the war of words. The repercussionsreach Bologna, where Jerome’s enemies side track an emissary from the universitythere and tell him that the old man is unworthy of a job. He is not even popularas a teacher, they say — he lectures to empty halls in Pavia. And so reportsreach the Bolognese Senate that Jerome is ‘a professor without a class, but onlybenches; that he is a man of ill manners, and disliked by all; one full offolly. His behaviour is repulsive; and he knows but little of the art ofmedicine, expressing such sectarian opinions about it that he is rejected by allin his own city, and has no patients.’On hearing the report, the Senate at Bologna halt the recruitment process.Fortunately for Jerome, Cardinal Borromeo knows the report is false, at least inpart. Jerome, Borromeo tells the Senate, once cured his mother when all otherphysicians failed. Another member of the Senate confessed he had once beentreated — and treated well — by Jerome and that he knows of other respected menwho can say the same. The Senate quickly realises the reports are part of aconspiracy. They can’t help wondering if there is something behind it, though,and exercise caution: Jerome is offered a short-term position. He can work forthe university for a year, during which he must prove himself. Only then can hebegin negotiations over a better salary.Humiliated by the offer, Jerome refuses the terms. But not without regret. Histenure at Pavia has ended; in the wake of the accusations, that refusedresignation letter was suddenly accepted. He is running out of money and of waysto earn it. He becomes ever more reclusive and paranoid — not a bad thing, as itturns out. Thinking his enemies’ next move might be to present his writings in adark, twisted light to the growing spectre of the Inquisition, he pre-empts themby sending all his published works to the Council at Rome. It is a move thatmight well have saved his life.However, that good news is still some way down the line. Here in Pavia, thingsare about to get worse. Having resigned from the University of Pavia and turneddown the offer from the University of Bologna, Jerome is desperate anddestitute. When four Milanese senators write to him suggesting he is a goodcandidate for a professorship there now, he has no choice but to start theapplication procedure. And then he is forced to halt it. The Milan Senate’srepresentatives report that two of their physicians have told the universitythat they have witnessed Jerome perpetrating ‘grave crimes’. Out of respect, hewill not be arrested, the Senate tells him. That is, not unless he strays withinMilanese territory.For three weeks, Jerome is an exile everywhere. A shadow hangs over him inPavia, Milan, and Bologna. But he still has powerful friends, a number of whomwork hard to refute the charges and ridicule his accusers. Suddenly, for reasonsthat Jerome will never discover, the charges are dropped. Bizarrely, the processhas gained him a certain notoriety and Jerome finds himself a celebrity. ‘I grewin fame,’ Jerome later recalls. ‘The citizens, indeed almost the whole state,embraced me with peculiar love, admired my innocence, and pitied mymisfortunes.’ Cardinals and councillors sought him out: ‘I never met with asuccess greater or more splendid.’He even receives a new, unrestricted offer from Bologna. He accepts,deliberately turning his back on the Milanese. ‘I knew of nothing worse than toendure life surrounded by the cruel faces and hard voices of the men who hadtorn from me my sweetest son,’ he says.Even the spirits are kind: he has a dream in which he is told to put an emeraldin his mouth whenever he wants to forget the pain of Giovanni’s execution.Emeralds, he knows, are a means to call information from the future; perhaps hismind will be so busied with prophecy that the troubles of the past will fadefrom memory. From that morning until the end of his life, he is barely withoutthat green gem tucked under his tongue. It is removed only for eating andtalking.ψJerome will live in Bologna from 1562 until his arrest in 1570. This is where hetakes on a student: Rudolf Silvestri, the skinny young man who will care for himin prison. He is also overjoyed to find that his former pupil, Lodovico Ferrari,is one of the university’s lecturers, teaching mathematics.Within a year, Ferrari will be dead at his sister’s hand, but Jerome doesn’tknow this, of course (where are the signs and omens when they could be useful?).And it is good that he doesn’t: these are happy times. The only taint is fromthe continued jealousy of academic colleagues furious at the ease with which hewalked into the job.In petty spite, the University of Bologna administrators timetable Jerome’slectures for after the dinner hour — the graveyard slot, when students areunlikely to attend. The lecture hall is frequently (and deliberately) doublebooked so that he is always competing with other teachers for the space. Secretletters are sent to Jerome’s powerful friend Cardinal Morone, repeating theallegation that Jerome lectures to almost empty benches. For a while, Jeromealso becomes embroiled in a very public row with a particularly pricklycolleague: Fracantiano, the Professor of the Practice of Medicine. It is theage-old tale: Jerome is Professor of the Theory of Medicine, and a clash betweenTheory and Practice is almost inevitable. Indeed, Fracantiano so hates his rivalthat he cannot bear to be in Jerome’s presence, instructing his attendants towarn him if Jerome should ever come near. Students being students, it becomestheir favourite sport to bring Jerome to wherever Fracantiano is teaching. Onone occasion, they succeed in enticing Jerome into one of Fracantiano’s lecturesand are rewarded with a wonderful sight. The Practice Professor is in such arush to evade the Theory Professor’s presence that he trips over his long blackgown and falls facedown on the floor.Years pass without anything more significant happening.And then comes the arrest.ψJerome is in a conciliatory mood tonight.‘It is not hard to imagine how your man Wykes could have seen Aldo betraying meto my Inquisitors,’ he says. ‘Aldo has been nothing but trouble. It is a matterof public record that I had him arrested a few months ago. And that wasn’t thefirst time.’Jerome had been paying off his son’s gambling debts, but that didn’t solve theproblem. Tired of having his own money and possessions disappear, he threw Aldoout of the Bologna house. Even that wasn’t enough. Conspiring with one of hisfather’s assistants, Aldo performed an audacious burglary, sneaking into thehouse, smashing open an ironbound strongbox and carrying away cash, jewellery,amulets, and precious stones. Jerome reported the crime, and his suspicionsabout the perpetrators, to the authorities.‘My assistant went to the gallows. Eight spells in a prison cell had donenothing for Aldo, so I had him banished.’ There is a wry smile on his face.‘There are some perks to being a freeman of the city.’‘And now the freeman is in prison.’He sighs, a resigned look spreading across his features. ‘I imagine there aremany people enjoying that irony.’"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14The bigger they are, the harder they fall. That is one way to interpret the factthat large objects, such as you and I, don’t appear in two places at once. Toput it another way, maybe we find the quantum world so weird because, in ourworld, everything is so big that it has significant consequences andrepercussions that stop the ‘weirdness’ in its tracks.That’s certainly what Roger Penrose thinks. Penrose, a mathematician at theUniversity of Oxford, doesn’t dispute that superpositions collapse somehow. Butalthough he believes there is a real world, physical process behind thecollapse, he doesn’t think it is to do with leaking information.For Penrose, it all comes down to gravity.Gravity is a mysterious force. It creates a weak pull between any two objects.We know the pull is proportional to their masses, but no one knows how thatactually works. All we know is that it exists and that a simple formuladescribes just how strong the attraction is. And we’ve known all that for a longtime — Newton worked it out.At the beginning of the twentieth century, Einstein reformulated Newton’sgravity. He showed mathematically that the pull can be interpreted as a resultof geometry. Something that has mass distorts the space around it (it alsodistorts time, but we’ll get to that) in a ‘gravitational field’. The classicillustration is the effect of a heavy object sitting on a rubber sheet. Therubber gets distorted, and anything else moving on the sheet will move not in astraight line, but along a curve determined by that distortion. Similarly, aplanet moving through space distorted by the sun’s mass will move in a curve —an orbit.Einstein’s theory is called general relativity and it works very well, fittingall the facts. It even explained a mystery or two, such as a strange anomaly inthe orbit of Mercury that had puzzled astronomers for two hundred years.Einstein also showed that energy does the same thing as mass — they are actuallyequivalent. So a photon’s energy will distort the space around it, just as anelectron’s mass will do.Now let’s go back to the double slit. We send our photon in and its wavelikeproperties cause it to take on a superposition. It is in two places at once. So,Penrose asks, what does its gravitational field look like?Well, the superposition means it must now be a distortion of space that has twofocuses, not one. The amount of distortion depends on the mass — if the objectis light enough, or has very little energy, the distortion will be very small.Imagine holding a tapestry set loosely in a frame. You have it horizontallybetween your knees and place a small pebble on it. There is a tiny indentation —a distortion — where the pebble sits. Now place another small pebble somewhereelse on the fabric. There will be another tiny indentation in the fabric. Makethose pebbles bigger, and the indentations will be bigger. Once they get to acertain size, the indentations will merge and the pebbles will smash together.Two become one.From here, it’s not hard to see what Penrose is saying: above a certainthreshold, superpositions of mass or energy will create gravitationaldistortions of space that can’t be sustained. That, he claims, is how wavefunction collapse happens.It’s a neat explanation. It tells you why you can’t put a cat into asuperposition, for instance: it’s too heavy. The cat’s mass creates an extendedgravitational distortion in space that means the two positions of the cat rolltogether into one immediately. The fabric of space simply can’t keep them apart.That’s conjecture, of course; we can’t do experiments with a cat. However, ourbest experiments have shown us that large collections of atoms seem to be unableto exist in superposition. We have made interference patterns with moleculescomposed of hundreds of atoms, but the more massive they get, the shorter-livedthe superposition. That said, at this stage, we are talking about astonishinglymassive things. Markus Arndt at the University of Vienna has createdsuperpositions of molecules composed of more than eight hundred atoms. He andhis colleagues are now working on firing viruses at a double slit and watchingthem produce an interference pattern on the other side, just as if they werewaves, and not biological entities with a well-defined location. According toArndt, viruses and vitamins will form superposition states. So, we haven’t yetseen a quantum cat, but within a decade the kinds of big biological moleculesthat make up cats may well exist in two places at once.Arndt thinks it’s just a matter of engineering solutions — for him, there’s noindication that a high mass directly impedes superpositions. And it is true tosay that nothing in the gravitational explanation tells us why observing whichslit the photon goes through would cause its superposition to collapse.This interpretation does have one huge advantage, which is that it can betested. And we can do more than just send ever more massive objects through thedouble slits. We can test the effects of the flow of time, for example.Einstein’s general theory of relativity says that clocks will run faster if theyare put in a weaker gravitational field — further from the centre of the Earth,say. The notion has been tested using hyper-accurate atomic clocks. First yousynchronise them, and then put them at different heights above the Earth’ssurface. Wait a while, then bring them back together for a comparison — and theyshow different times. That’s why, over your lifetime, your head ages threehundred nanoseconds seconds more than your feet. You can harness this effect tomess with an atom or photon in a double slit experiment — if the slits are atdifferent altitudes, there should be a difference in the two branches of thesuperposition that affects the result you get when they recombine at thedetector.Einstein’s other theory might help, too. Ten years before he came up withgeneral relativity, Einstein created the ‘special’ theory of relativity. Thissays that anything moving through space will have a unique experience of theflow of time. It’s a phenomenon that is called ‘time dilation’ and we know it istrue because we have also tested this idea using atomic clocks. Fly twosynchronised clocks around the world along two different routes, and they areout of sync when you bring them back together.Now think of that photon moving towards the double slit. It is in asuperposition, which means its time dilation is occurring along two differentpaths at once — it will be different on each path. Then it hits the detector andthe two become one. So how much time has passed for the photon? There is afundamental mismatch: it would now have two times (in its internal phase clock,controlled by Jerome’s i, if you’re wondering). That simply can’t be, surely?We’ll see. If we can learn to control the effect, it might have an interestingand informative effect on the interference pattern at the detector.There is a fundamental problem with this interpretation. We know that quantumphysics and Einstein’s general theory of relativity are incompatible. We suspectthat’s because relativity does not give the final answer to the fundamentalquestion of the nature of space and time. It works superbly as a way of probingwhat happens when you send a light beam or a particle through space inhabited byother massive or energetic objects. But it’s a hand-waving, geometry-basedillustration of some of the properties of space and time. Not how it actuallyis. For that we need a quantum theory of gravity.Einstein spent the last decades of his life trying to unite quantum physics withrelativity, a fruitless quest that saw him move in ever decreasing circles andrendered the old man an embarrassment to his colleagues. The same quest alsoreduced Schrödinger to a similar end. In the eyes of their younger peers, bothwere reduced to near ignominy.ψ‘The world is cruel to the old,’ Jerome says. There is a weariness about himtonight, as if my tales of the failing old men of physics have pulled the lastvestiges of resolve from his scrawny frame. He waves his hand at the cell walls.‘You don’t see young men thrown into prison for their books.’‘Young men don’t often publish books,’ I say. ‘They keep their thoughts in theirheads, where they can grow and change. It’s good insurance against being definedby foolish, half-formed ideas.’Jerome eyes me for a moment. ‘How old are you?’ he asks.‘Forty-six.’ I know what is coming next.‘And in how many books have you set down your foolish, half-formed ideas?’I hesitate. Five? Six? ‘Four that are any good.’He smiles. He is bouncing back. ‘Anything you regret publishing?’‘One. But it doesn’t matter — hardly anyone read it.’Jerome’s smile broadens, then he breaks into a gentle laugh. His shoulders shakeand he wheezes as he tries to catch his breath. When he calms, he looks directlyat me. Suddenly he is enjoying himself. ‘Having readers is overrated,’ he says.‘Look where it got me.’Jerome never explained the reason for his arrest. That is almost certainlybecause he was told to keep the details of his interrogations to himself. Theend result has been centuries of speculation. His biggest problem, scholarsagree, was Antonio Ghislieri. In 1566, Ghislieri ascended to the papal throne asPius V: a sombre, dogmatic, cheerless soul who had himself been a GrandInquisitor. His zeal probably came from a sense that the Roman Catholics were onthe back foot: the Protestants were ruling England and Scotland, and had strongfootholds in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Ghislieri took the step ofexcommunicating Elizabeth I and committed himself to stemming the tide of heresycreeping into Italy. It would, he reasoned, come from the north of the country.Jerome’s life in Bologna may simply have put him in the wrong place at the wrongtime.He was also in the wrong profession. One of Pius V’s edicts was that doctorsshould not treat patients who had let more than three days pass withoutconfession. This stricture applied even to bedridden patients who presumably hadlittle opportunity — or appetite — for heinous iniquities.Jerome had ignored this law, as any number of sly, ungrateful patients mighthave testified. Then there was the Pope’s decree that the Inquisitors shouldrake over the last two decades of writings by leading figures. That Jerome hadalready submitted his books for scrutiny no doubt helped. However, that wasunder a less stringent regime. Under Pius V, Jerome’s stances on variousdoctrines were bound to suggest heresy.There was, for instance, the passage in On Subtlety that compared and contrastedthe views of Jews, Muslims, and Christians. There, Jerome’s take was that Godwould be rather lenient on anyone who was trying to exercise faith of any sortand unlikely to condemn someone to the fires of Hell just because they followeda different set of doctrines. He even praises the opposition. ‘The Mohammedansthemselves have strong points,’ he says, for ‘they refrain from slaughter, dice,adultery, and unprincipled deeds against God, and unspeakable blasphemies, fourfaults by which the whole Christian population is almost crushed.’ He lauds themfor their focus on a single deity, uncomplicated by the idea of Father, Son and,Holy Spirit, and for their straightforward, honest reputation. ‘What if you lookat the good reputation of their women, and their mosque worship?’ he asks.It is likely Jerome’s religious tolerance is born from his admiration for themathematical insights of men such as Mohammed ibn al-Khwārizmī, the author ofthe ninth-century text Al-jabr wa’l muqābalah (from which we have derived theword algebra). Jerome revered al-Khwārizmī enough to mention him in the veryfirst chapter of his own contribution to algebra, The Great Art. The thinkingseems to be straightforward: if the pursuit of mathematical and scientificknowledge was nothing less than the pursuit of the mind of God, how can a devoutMohammedan mathematician be any lower in God’s eyes than a Christian one?Then there was Jerome’s discussion of the immortality of the soul. This isdangerous ground in a time when a fear of eternal punishment was a useful meansfor suppressing the growing dissent against the church. Jerome’s argument insupport of the doctrine is pragmatic in the extreme: people, he says, areincapable of being good without the spectre of eternal punishment hanging overthem. Therefore, it is important that they be led to believe in an afterlife.It’s hardly a ringing endorsement of the Holy Church’s beliefs.Or perhaps it was his astrology. Jerome’s horoscopes, especially that horoscopeof Christ, are a potent source of controversy. Pius V is set full againstastrology, and that goes double when it is applied to our Lord and Saviour.ψJerome remains bemused by the idea that a horoscope of Jesus is any kind ofheresy. ‘I published it within a work on Ptolemy — and alongside Ptolemy’s ownhoroscope of our Saviour,’ he says. ‘Plenty of others have done the same andalways shown that our Lord was all that he claimed. What heresy is there inbacking up the truth of the Gospels?’‘Ideas evolve,’ I say. ‘These days, horoscopes are seen as a suggestion that thestars influence their Creator. And, by casting a horoscope, you are aiming toinfluence Him, too.’ I hesitate. ‘You know John Dee?’I know he knows Dee, a mathematician and astrologer who advised Queen ElizabethI of England. They met almost twenty years ago, at Southwark dock on the Thamesin London. Dee’s notebooks record that they went together to the Frenchambassador’s house to examine a gemstone that could draw down the power of theplanets.Jerome’s brow has furrowed. ‘We carried out some investigations together,’ hesays cautiously.‘Did you know he was arrested for casting horoscopes of Queen Mary and thePrincess Elizabeth? It was considered meddling, an attempt to influence themthrough occult means. His colleague burned at the stake for it.’His eyes have widened. ‘And Doctor Dee?’‘Talked his way out of it.’Jerome’s features relax into a smile. ‘Yes. That sounds like him.’ He frownsagain. ‘You know he’s not a real doctor?’It is my turn to raise an eyebrow. ‘The point, Jerome, is that castinghoroscopes is dangerous. It looks like magic. It looks like casting spells, orsuggesting mystical influences can intervene. Your horoscope of Christ is, tothem —’ I point to the door, ‘an attempt to twist God’s arm. It is a suggestionthat the planets — the creation — can control the Creator.’Jerome’s expression is blank. He is staring at the door, following mystill-extended finger. Eventually, the spell breaks and he raises an eyebrow atme. ‘So what should I do, my guardian angel?’His ever-constant conviction is touching. ‘You still have friends in highplaces,’ I suggest. ‘Cardinal Morone, for one. And Archbishop Hamilton. Didn’the write you a letter offering help if you ever needed it?’He smiles, opens his arms, and does a passable Scottish accent. ‘If I can be ofuse to you in anything, with aid, service, or money, you will send word to me …the moment I have tidings of it, consider the thing done.’Jerome’s memory astonishes me. Without further protestation, he sits back downat his desk and begins to write.ψConsider the thing done. On 8 March 1571, five months after his arrest, Jeromeis told to gather his possessions and get ready to leave his cell. He is to livethe remainder of his days under house arrest. I don’t know if it was Hamilton.He was still alive — just — and capable of colluding in an assassination plot atfifty-nine years old, so he could certainly answer a letter. But it seemsunlikely, given the time that it would take to send a letter to Scotland andthen another back to Rome. It’s only been a few weeks since our lastconversation. So maybe it was Cardinal Morone, or Cardinal Borromeo? Maybe Icannot claim to be the one who saved him by pointing him to Hamilton. Whateverthe truth, this cell is to be Jerome’s home no longer.There are conditions to Jerome’s freedom. Many, many conditions. First, he mustabjure — that is, renounce and repudiate his heresy — in front of the assemblyof Inquisitors. This is something of a let off, though. Many of those on trialhave to abjure in the city square for all to see. Someone is clearly looking outfor Jerome and recommending his punishment not be too severe.Second, he is stripped of the right to teach in any of the Papal States. Hisdays as a Professor are over.Third, he must give up the right to publish any of his writings. No one can stophim scrawling down his thoughts, but they are not to be broadcast, lest he leadthe public astray again.Fourth, he is to deposit a sum of eighteen hundred crowns with the church andlive under a self-imposed house arrest. He will receive from it an annual incomeof 180 crowns. This will be, to a man used to earning four times that from hisprofessorial salary alone, a life of penury.Fifth, he is not to speak of the Inquisition’s charge or methods.‘Not even to you,’ he says, eyeing me from the open door of the cell. I am saton the straw mattress, wondering if I will see him again.I won’t.ψMonths later, Jerome moves from Bologna to Rome. From the little informationavailable, it seems that this was at Cardinal Morone’s suggestion. The RomanInquisition, ever zealous under Pius V, has taken over proceedings at Bologna;Jerome will be safer in Rome, away from those who know him and might accuse himanew. He will also be better placed to negotiate with the authorities over hisstatus. Once settled, he works hard to have the condemnation of his writingslifted and to achieve a licence to teach and publish once more. Jerome beingJerome, settling for obscurity and poverty is not an option.It was not a good time. Morley records that the French intellectualJacques-Auguste De Thou happened upon Jerome in Rome, ‘walking about thestreets, not dressed like any other person’. Some kind of Scottish kilt,perhaps? De Thou visited Jerome in his house and recalls that he was ‘a madmanof impious audacity, who had attempted to subject to the stars the Lord of thestars, and cast our Saviour’s horoscope’.Mud sticks, and de Thou was an enemy of the Catholic Church, and a fan andfriend of Scaliger. Enough said. These are men who thought so little of Jeromethat they created and broadcast the myth that he starved himself so that hewould die on the date his horoscope had predicted.Fools.There’s clearly something between Jerome and the French of that time. A Frenchlawyer, Francois D’Ambrose, also visited, and also paints a picture of a madman.Jerome, D’Ambrose reports, was living in a room with banners on the walls thatdeclared TEMPVS MEA POSSESSIO — ‘Time is my Possession’.But things do improve. On 1 May 1572, just over a year after Jerome’s release,Pius V succumbs to a rampaging cancer. Within twenty-four hours, the conclavehas chosen Cardinal Ugo Boncompagni as his successor. Boncompagni takes the nameGregory XIII and ushers in a host of reforms, including a revision to the listof forbidden books. Gregory XIII is a lover of astronomy — a passion that ledhim to instigate the reform of the calendar, despite widespread opposition.What’s more, Gregory has an illegitimate son, which surely makes him a littlemore sympathetic to Jerome’s plight. Even better, the new Pope counts CardinalBorromeo among his former students, and Cardinal Morone among his friends.The stars have aligned. By the end of October 1572, the seventy-one-year-oldJerome is in possession of a licence to republish his existing medical works. Afurther eighteen months of petitioning grants him the right to publish somethingnew. Then, in September 1574, he is accepted into the Roman College ofPhysicians. The Pope grants that the interest on his eighteen hundred crown bondbe paid to him as a papal pension. It works out to be slightly less than his 180crowns per month, but it is a valuable public acknowledgement of hisrehabilitation, which is worth money in itself. At the beginning of 1576, Jeromewins the right to return to his teaching post in Bologna.He never makes the journey.ψThere is hardly any more to say. What little I can find about the end ofJerome’s life is scraped together from a variety of meagre sources. There islittle of these years in his autobiography, which was published after his death.In my more whimsical moments, however, I can at least read myself into thosepages. ‘It has been my lot to be attended by a good and compassionate angel,’Jerome says. Remember how I wondered whether Rudolf Silvestri ever saw me?Clearly, he did, because Jerome admits it. ‘In prison,’ he writes, ‘my guardianappeared to me and to my youthful associate … in order that he might confirm mein my hope of divine favour whereby I should escape death, and that all thosetrials which I was suffering should seem less hard to bear.’ In hisautobiography’s last chapter, which revels in the utilitarian title ‘And This IsThe Epilogue’, Jerome describes himself as ‘a teller of the truth, an uprightman, and indebted for my powers to a divine spirit’.The more sceptical among you will point out that I read those words before Iconceived the conceit in these pages. But because you are humans and inpossession of a brain that has not evolved beyond entertaining superstition andmystery, some of you will be more open to the idea that I really did visitJerome, that we really are somehow connected. Vishal, my astrologer, would haveno problem with the concept, I suspect. After all, there is even evidence of ourconversations about the nature of the universe. Jerome ends the book describinghis source on such matters: ‘for all things more than mortal there is myattendant spirit which can neither be described nor alluded to and is not undermy control’. He wonders on the page whether what he calls his ‘boundless love oftruth and wisdom’ drew this spirit to him. His next suspicion may be moreaccurate: ‘perhaps my angel was present with me for an end known to himselfalone’.Perhaps. In the spirit of quantum theory, I’ll leave the interpretation of thesematters up to you, the observer."},{"pageContent":"And This Is The Epilogue‘An evil fate wills it that men will from time to time revert to darkness out ofboredom with light. Ours is such a time, with great opportunities to learn theright things being spurned, and a wealth of the most lucid truths beingdisregarded in favour of obscure trivialities.’That was how Gottfried Leibniz, mathematician and philosopher, expressed hisfrustrations at the beginning of the eighteenth century. You might think he wascomplaining about people rejecting the rational lines of enquiry that were bornin the Enlightenment — people persisting with astrology, perhaps, in an age whenastronomy was in the ascendant. In fact, the jibe was aimed squarely at Newton,and his weird and occult idea of ‘forces’. The complaint comes in a treatiseLeibniz called ‘Against Barbaric Physics’ directed at those who ‘speak ofattracting and repelling, adjusting, expanding and contracting forces’. Leibnizadmits that the idea of the planets ‘gravitating and striving toward each other’has been confirmed as correct. But he rejects the new idea that ‘matter issupposedly able to perceive and covet even things which are remote’. Physicsstripped of all mysticism is ‘too clear and simple for these people,’ Leibnizcomplained. ‘Instead they revert to fanciful ideas.’Leibniz compares Newton to those who suggest a foetus is formed by intelligentspirits that attend to it in the womb. ‘How can any reasonable person todaysubscribe to a belief in fantastic qualities that is tantamount to a betrayal ofall natural principles? … all this is bound to lead us completely into the realmof the obscure …’ Everything, Leibniz says, should ultimately be reduced tomechanisms, for mechanics.Leibniz would be horrified at where we have got to today. David Bohm suggestedthat quantum mechanics is a misnomer: it should be called quantum non-mechanicsbecause everything we have learned says there is no physical mechanism to befound within the theory. There is certainly no mechanism that explainsentanglement. There is no physical conception of what happens when the photonapproaches the double slit. And as for Newton’s gravity, a proper mechanicalexplanation still eludes us.Einstein reworked Newton’s gravity as a set of contours in space and time: wecan predict the trajectories of the planets if we consider them as traversing alandscape of hills and valleys created by the mass and energy contained withinthe universe. But we sometimes confuse our success in explaining what happenswith an explanation for why or how it happens. Einstein’s work has proved anextraordinary success, with myriad successful predictions and explanations ofphysical phenomena under its belt. But it is not an explanation of why and howmass and energy should give shape to the cosmic landscape — or even that theshape is really there in the way we say it is. After all, a deformation in a twodimensional rubber sheet requires a third dimension. If we are distorting thefour dimensions of space and time, into what dimension are they distorting?Don’t misunderstand me — Einstein’s explanation is wonderful. But that doesn’tmean the explanation is actually how it is. Where gravity is concerned, wehaven’t progressed much beyond ‘red sky at night, shepherd’s delight’.The truth is that quantum mechanics and relativity remain our best theories, yetalso provide our most frustrating impasse. We present them as useful schema forexplaining observed phenomena, but only to a point. We cannot actually accountfor the details of either. ‘Nobody knows how it can be like that,’ RichardFeynman said of quantum theory. And relativity, most agree, is a theory alreadyin need of an overhaul, for it simply doesn’t give us meaningful answers to allthe questions we ask of it. Hundreds of years after Jerome’s investigations ofthe universe, the job is still only half done.If that. Roger Penrose’s ‘gravitational collapse’ interpretation of quantumtheory is an attempt to sketch out what a theory that unites relativity withquantum mechanics might achieve, but it is barely even a sketch. It isimpossible to know how far along the path to such a ‘final theory’ we havetravelled. In Jerome’s time, astronomers had made major steps forward since thetimes of the ancients, but to us their tiny, Earth-centred universe still lookslike a primitive and wholly inadequate attempt at understanding the nature ofthe cosmos. Unless we live in a special time in the history of humanity — and itis unscientific to think that we do — there is no reason to believe that thehumans of the twenty-fifth century will look at us any differently from how welook at our scientific predecessors. But what will they make of our inability toparse the meaning of quantum theory? Will our take on entanglement andsuperposition look to them as Jerome’s astrological inference looks to us?If they were to visit us in the prison cells of our ignorance, what secretsmight they convey? Part of me hopes they would tell us that the astrologers wereonto something. Something deep within me, deep within all humans that have everlived, yearns to be connected to the cosmos, to be a cog, however tiny andinfinitesimally unimportant, that turns because of a distant rotation elsewherein time and space. I suppose that is part of the appeal of Gerard ’t Hooft’ssuperdeterminism interpretation of quantum mechanics: it feeds the desire to bepart of something bigger. It absolves us of the duty to explain, and allows usto just be, to let Fate direct our path through the cosmos.Not that most physicists would subscribe to superdeterminism. But neither arethey comfortable with what is currently considered the best hope forunderstanding how the universe works: string theory.Remember how Einstein and Schrödinger were reduced to dust by the attempt tounite quantum theory with relativity? There were times when they refused to talkto one another, so intense was the competition between them to crack thispuzzle. They even spoke of lawsuits to prevent the other from stealing ideas.String theory, our current best candidate for a quantum theory of gravity isvery different from anything that pair suggested, but it is proving equallydivisive.To its critics, it is so far off the mark that it is ‘not even wrong’ and a ‘newversion of medieval theology’. Those who think it worth pursuing, on the otherhand, are often puzzled by others’ inability to appreciate its ‘beauty’.What is string theory? A true understanding of this attempt to unite quantumtheory and Einstein’s relativity is only possible for those who deal inmathematics more easily than in language. So I can only tell you anapproximation of its claims: string theory says that all the familiar particlesarise from the different vibrational modes of strings and loops of pure energy.The energy vibrates one way and it creates a photon. Another kind of vibrationgives us an electron. And so on.The idea has arisen from work carried out in the 1920s, when even quantum theorywas young. Two mathematical physicists, Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein,independently worked out that Einstein’s relativity can give birth to theelectromagnetic theory governing the behaviour of photons and electrons if theuniverse is allowed to have four spatial dimensions instead of the usual three.Kaluza and Klein’s extra dimension had to be curled up into a tiny circle forthe maths to work, but it was an interesting result that mathematicians playedwith for decades, slowly expanding its sphere of influence. By the 1980s, theidea had become a theory that accounted for the existence of all the fundamentalparticles. There was only one problem. The mathematics only worked if the stringtheorists invoke even more spatial dimensions. According to string theory, thereare ten dimensions of space, with seven of them lying, curled up, beyond ourperception. What’s more the theory doesn’t describe our universe specifically.It describes a plethora of universes, each with slightly different physicalproperties. We inhabit — hopefully — one of 10500 universes described by stringtheory.It is a situation that some have described as nonsensical. It is, after all, atheory that doesn’t make any testable predictions and so can never be tested. ‘Ihave been brought up to believe that systems of belief which cannot be falsifiedare not in the realm of science,’ is how Nobel laureate Sheldon Glashow hasdismissed string theory. Hence his contention that it is no different tomedieval theology.Glashow probably doesn’t appreciate that it is closer to medieval — or at leastRenaissance — science. In some sense, Jerome’s aevum is still with us. Stringtheory even has a contemporary version of Jerome’s centre that ‘corresponds toevery point on the circumference’. It is known as the ‘holographic principle’,and was conceived by an Argentinian string theorist called Juan Maldacena. Hisidea is that all of what we term physical reality results from information heldon the edge of our cosmos — a cosmos that has many more dimensions of space thanthe three we experience. Our physical universe, in other words, is just a smallmanifestation of something that exists in the great beyond, something that isunreachable, and beyond our understanding.Though many of today’s physics luminaries, Stephen Hawking among them,enthusiastically subscribe to the holographic principle, there is noexperimental test that can tell us whether it is right. It is simply our beststab at a final theory. We are still very much on the road towardsunderstanding, still travelling in the dark, with still only the faintest hopeof arriving at our destination. And we are almost certainly only a few stepsahead of the man who showed us the path that we should follow, my friend Jerome."},{"pageContent":"Author’s NoteIn case you were in any doubt, this is not an academic work. It is not somethingto be referenced, or consulted as if it were scholarly research. That is why Iwould like to introduce you to my sources, many of which do fit thatdescription.First, nothing compares to reading Jerome’s own descriptions of his life andwork, his hopes and regrets. The Book of My Life, translated by Jean Stoner, iswonderfully entertaining. There are some moments of self indulgence in there,but it’s an autobiography — what can you expect? Also wonderful, though a lot,lot longer, is The De subtilitate of Girolamo Cardano, a translation fromJerome’s Latin by John M Forrester edited by the University of Edinburgh scholarJohn Henry. There are so many gems in these pages that I feel I will be miningthem for the rest of my life. I do miss Jerome now that this book is finished,but I still get to hear his voice through these two works.The Quantum Astrologer’s Handbook would never have been written without HenryMorley’s exhaustive Jerome Cardan: the life of Girolamo Cardano, of Milan,physician. That is partly because this biography, published in 1854, informedAlan Wykes’s Doctor Cardano, Physician Extraordinary, the book that finallytipped me into dedicating time to getting to know the real Jerome.Wykes says Morley’s book is ‘afflicted with Victorian turgidity’. I don’t agree,but I can see where he is coming from. Wykes’s book, published in 1969, iscertainly not turgid — it is an entertaining and lucid tale, great company infront of a roaring fire, a single malt in hand. But it is also, as you’ll knowby now, not to be trusted. That is not a condemnation, exactly. I have friendswho could be described using the exact same phrasing and I would not be withoutany of them.I also used a few other books on Jerome’s life and work which can be trusted.Let’s put them into chronological order:JEROME CARDAN:a biographical studyby William George WatersWaters’ 1898 volume is essentially a distillation of Morley’s work (and alsoafflicted with ‘Victorian turgidity’, according to Wykes). There’s not much moreto say about it, except to be thankful, in the light of Morley’s magnum opus,for its relative brevity.CARDANO:the gambling scholarby Øystein Ore‘An all but extinguished scientific luminary of 16th-century Italy shinesagain,’ gushed The New York Times on this book’s publication in 1953. ‘Brisklyinteresting to lay readers, sometimes scarcely falling short of being racy,’said the New York Herald Tribune. Well, ‘racy’ perhaps meant something differentback then, but it’s certainly interesting. Ore was a Norwegian mathematician.It’s not clear how he came to celebrate Jerome’s life in print but hisdissection of Jerome’s work on probability is thorough and informative.GIROLAMO CARDANO 1501-1576:physician, natural philosopher, mathematician, astrologer, and interpreter ofdreamsby Markus Fierz (translated by Helga Niman)This biography was written by a Swiss mathematical physicist working fromJerome’s collected works, the Opera Omnia, in 1977. For a physicist, Fierz iswonderfully generous towards Cardano, giving him credit for his open-mindednessand appropriate use of astrology. I particularly like his assertion that‘Cardano did not reject the Copernican theory completely.’THE CLOCK AND THE MIRROR:Girolamo Cardano and Renaissance medicineby Nancy G SiraisiWe are in 1997 now — only twenty years ago! Siraisi’s book is primarilyconcerned with Jerome’s medical practice, how it fitted with the times, and howit compares with the work of today’s practitioners. There is much to enjoy here,and Siraisi is generally impressed by Jerome’s insight. She highlights hisunderstanding that men could be rendered impotent by a curse, as long as theybelieved in it, and that magical remedies for impotence worked simply becausethey ‘substituted hope for the patient’s despair’. Siraisi’s view is thatCardano was a level-headed investigator of the physician’s art. ‘He repeatedlyurged, in a manner highly unusual in the sixteenth century … that the firstthing to ask about a supposed marvel was not what had caused it but whether ithad happened.’CARDANO’S COSMOS:the worlds and works of a Renaissance astrologerby Anthony GraftonGrafton’s book, published in 1999, offers deep insight into the human mind’syearning for advice, however unreliable the source. My favourite part is thedissection of economics as the modern counterpart to astrology. ‘Like theeconomist, the astrologer generally found that the events did not match theprediction,’ Grafton says, ‘and like the economist, the astrologer normallyreceived as a reward … a better job and a higher salary.’There were sources other than books. It was a revelation and an utter joy todiscover that my friend and colleague Professor Artur Ekert was also somewhattaken by Jerome. In 2008, Ekert wrote a short treatise, ‘Complex andUnpredictable Cardano’, laying out why his discovery of probability and complexnumbers linked Jerome to quantum theory. Ekert is one of the inventors ofquantum cryptography, the art of using the fundamental laws of physics toencrypt information. I feel that Jerome would, in many ways, rather have talkedwith him than with me.Finally, two Jerome-free publications that have informed these discussions.First is John Gribbin’s In Search of Schrödinger’s Cat. This is quite simply awonderful, measured, intelligent introduction to quantum theory. I’m not sure ithas been surpassed, despite having been published way back in 1984. Second isAstrology Decoded: a step by step guide to learning astrology by Sue MerlynFarebrother. Do I need to say that I don’t believe it? Well, that doesn’tactually matter. I liked its ambition. I think Jerome would approve, too.That’s enough of the written word. I must mention a few people who have assistedme along the way. The staff of the British Library were unfailingly helpful. Ihave had equally helpful conversations with Ian Maclean, John Henry, DarioTessicini, Alec Ryrie, Tom McLeish, Giles Gasper, Chris French, and Artur Ekert,among others. The generosity of the Fetzer Franklin Fund enabled me to travel toa gathering of quantum desperadoes in Vienna. I am grateful to Philip Voke, whoentrusted Wykes’ papers to Reading Library, and generously pointed me towardsthem. I would also like to thank my friend Helen Bagnall for her encouragementto press on and finish what frequently looked like a doomed project.Now to those whose sharp minds assisted the production of this book. Here, ArturEkert merits another mention for his comments on an early draft. My agent,Patrick Walsh, his assistant, John Ash, and Scribe’s irrepressible Philip GwynJones have all made invaluable suggestions concerning the manuscript. MollySlight proved an invaluable copy editor, picking up all kinds of errors andomissions.Jerome, who still inhabits my dreams on occasion, remains in splendidsuperposition as my chief critic and supporter. On his first reading of themanuscript, PGJ suggested I might be a little in love with Jerome. Perhaps. I domiss having him all to myself now, I must say.—Michael Brooks, March 2017"}]
