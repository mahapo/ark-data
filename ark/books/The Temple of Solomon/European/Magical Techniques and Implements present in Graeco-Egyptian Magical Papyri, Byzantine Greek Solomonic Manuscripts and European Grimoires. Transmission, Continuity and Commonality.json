The evolution of magical techniques is traced from one period to another, using the papyri, manuscripts and printed editions of handbooks actually written, used or owned by magicians, rather than the literature about them. In this way magic is treated like any evolving technology, where a surprising degree of continuity and commonality has been found, stretching over periods up to two thousand years. There is no intention to examine social, political, economic or religious issues, or the reaction to magicians of their surrounding lay community, or to assess the effectiveness of these techniques, purely an intention to identify the commonality, continuity and transmission of their techniques and equipment. The nature of the blending of Egyptian, Greek and Jewish magical techniques, equipment and nomina magica in Alexandria in the first five centuries of the Common Era is discussed, and the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are analysed from the point of view of methods, materia and intended outcome, with a detailed breakdown of sources and rite types. The commonality between these methods and ingredients so established, and their reappearance in the Byzantine Greek Hygromanteia and related texts is demonstrated, with an analysis of why some methods persisted and others faded away. The migration of these methods and nomina magica from the Greek Solomōnikē to the Latin grimoires, particularly the Clavicula Salomonis, is analysed on a technique by technique basis, with illustrative passages drawn from vernacular Solomonic manuscripts like the Lemegeton. Areas of discontinuity are evaluated, and the sources of material from other sources, such as the pentacles of the Key of Solomon, ascertained and identified.

Summary of Objectives This study is primarily a study of learned Solomonic ritual magic, geographically restricted to Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, including Egypt. The objective is to research and identify the transmission, continuity and common elements of magical techniques and implements present in Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri (2nd century BCE – 5th century CE), Byzantine Greek Solomonic manuscripts (6th century – 16th century) such as the Hygromanteia, through to European Latin and English Solomonic grimoires2 (13th century - 19th century) from both manuscript and printed sources.3 Research Question being Addressed The research is designed to answer the question: “What are the sources of the material in European grimoires (or handbooks of magic), specifically the manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis?” The research will look at specific identifiable techniques, diagrams, consumables, nomina magica and implements, and not just generalized themes. Grimoires such as the Juratus or the Ars Notoria circulated in manuscript in Western Europe as early as the 13th century. The most popular grimoire, the Clavicula Salomonis appeared in Europe apparently fully fledged in the 15th century, rather than evolving from simpler works. The usual assumption, voiced by a number of scholars is that it must derive from Jewish originals. The assumption of a Hebrew origin is based on their typical attribution to Solomon the Hebrew king, a typical target for pseudepigraphic authorship. This assumption was given further credence by the discovery of the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh, or the Book of the Key of Solomon, a grimoire written in cursive Hebrew dating from 1700.4 The present thesis intends to disprove that assumption, and discredit this support by demonstrating that this specific Hebrew manuscript cannot be the source of the Latin Clavicula Salomonis, as it was itself translated from a Latin and Italian original.5 The thesis will then break new ground by establishing a lineage for the Latin Clavicula Salomonis back to the Byzantine Greek Solomōnikē, specifically the Hygromanteia. This transmission will be based on a detailed analysis of the specific techniques, equipment, nomina magica and chapter contents in relevant source texts, not merely on their thematic   2 Grimoires are handbooks of ritual invocation and evocation. The word is usually derived from the French grammaire meaning ‘grammar,’ as in a grammar or primer of magic. 3 Obviously the Byzantine Empire straddled part of Asia Minor and Europe, and so in that sense is also European. The distinction is more of a linguistic one (Greek versus Latin) than a geographic one. 4 Gollancz and Skinner (2008). 5 See also Rohrbacher-Sticker (1993/94), pp. 263-270."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 content. No researcher has, as yet, shown in detail the transmission of specific sections and procedures from the Greek manuscripts of the Hygromanteia to the Latin Clavicula Salomonis, although Richard Greenfield has indicated its possibility.6 At the same time the origin of one part of the Clavicula Salomonis, the pentacles, appearing in a few Text-Groups of the Clavicula Salomonis, has been traced to a previously unnoticed Hebrew manuscript.7 Furthermore, it is planned to explore commonality and a possible line of transmission between the Greek Hygromanteia and the PGM of Egypt, a connection that has not been investigated in any detail before. In summary, the theory to be tested is that mediaeval Solomonic grimoires, and indeed most of the Solomonic magical tradition in both the Latin and Greek worlds, owe their earliest origins to the Graeco-Egyptian papyri, not to some unknown Hebrew antecedents, not just in a general or thematic sense, but in the transmission of specific techniques, words and implements from one culture to another. I intend to prove that the use of Hebrew god names is simply a by-product of their having filtered into Graeco-Egyptian magic practice from Jews living in Alexandria rather than an indication of the origin of these techniques. There is no intention to look at social, political or religious issues, their reception by the surrounding community, or to assess the effectiveness of these techniques. The intention is purely one of identifying their commonality, continuity and transmission using handbooks written by or used practically by the magicians themselves. I therefore propose to approach magic as another form of technology, establish how its techniques evolved, and chart their development and evolution.8 The original idea for the thesis came from two passages in Richard Greenfield’s Traditions of Belief in Late Byzantine Demonology in which he sets out his work on Byzantine demonology. His book takes two distinct approaches to defining the place of demonological belief in Byzantium. The first is made within the context of the Orthodox Church and establishment view, which is then contrasted with the view of magicians and the less orthodox monks of the period who had access to, or owned, magical handbooks. It is this second approach, in which he examines texts like the Hygromanteia, Testament of Solomon and the Book of Wisdom of Apollonius of Tyana or the Biblos, which I wish to use as my point of contact with Byzantine   6 Greenfield (1995), p. 161. 7 Sepher ha-Otot. 8 The exclusion of social, political, economic and religious issues has been made in an effort to narrow the focus of the thesis, but also because to a large extent, the transmission of magical knowledge was achieved by a closed master-pupil apprenticeship system, or the rediscovery of techniques in books and manuscripts by each new generation of students, rather than the teaching of the subject in open schools regulated by either civil or religious authorities."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 magicians’ methods: It is clear from even a brief reading of the Treatise [the Hygromanteia]9 and material related to it that it has close connections with texts and practices of ritual magic which were current in the West in many languages and in many countries from the 13th century onwards, although again the best and most elaborate of these texts only survive in manuscripts of the 16th or 17th centuries. Very little comparative work has been done on the literature of this ritual magic, the magic of the notorious Claviculae and Grimoires of the later Middle Ages, and not much is known of its precise development and origin. Although any attempt to answer such questions...must be the subject of a great deal of further research, it is nevertheless clear from the Greek Treatise [the Hygromanteia] and related material, which is what is of concern here, that traces, and in some cases quite large portions, of much older traditions are preserved in these now rather muddled and confused texts.10 Some of the material here is thus very similar to techniques and rituals preserved in the very much older Greek magical papyri...11 As part of his literature review Greenfield remarks that there is also a need for a study that relates his work back to Hellenistic, Classical and other branches of eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern magic: What has been, and still is needed is a systematic and comprehensive study of the history and content of Byzantine beliefs about demons and other supernatural evil beings... Ideally such a study would also enable these beliefs to be placed in relation to their antecedents in early Christianity and in Classical, Hellenistic, Jewish and other branches of Near Eastern thought, as well as to contemporary and parallel beliefs in Western Europe...12 Obviously much more detailed work has yet to be done in the same arena, but identification of parallels between these different traditions in terms of practice and equipment is a beginning. The specific questions that arise from this passage are: a. How do the techniques and practices recorded in the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri relate to the Byzantine Greek Solomonic manuscripts, specifically the Hygromanteia? b. To what extent have the techniques and practices found in the Byzantine Greek Solomonic manuscripts been transmitted to the Western European grimoires, specifically the Clavicula Salomonis, and how were they transmitted to the Latin West? c. To what extent is there a commonality of techniques, texts, nomina magica and ritual practices between the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri of Late Antiquity, the Byzantine Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis? There are obviously dangers implicit in examining such a wide geographical and literary range, and perhaps a detailed study of just one of the periods or cultures, or just one item of practice, would have been more prudent. But it is sometimes necessary to draw the wider outlines of a subject, in order for the specialists working on just one facet to be able to   9 Correctly referred to by Greenfield as the Magical Treatise or just the Treatise. 10 The present thesis will also show that, once the specific strands making up the magical techniques are clearly identified, the degree of confusion and muddling is much less than has commonly been supposed. 11 Greenfield (1995), p. 161. 12 Greenfield (1995), p. xi."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 appreciate its origins and later development. I am emboldened by Mastrocinque’s observation: Let us then, just for once, leave aside the endless and often fruitless arguments about method and abstract philosophical concepts, and concentrate on ancient texts and monuments. This procedure carries with it a risk of error, of course. Personally I admire the errors made by great scholars such as K. Reitzenstein, W. Bousset or A. Dieterich, who have taken risks in order to open up new fields of inquiry and to advance research, far more than the sensible and impartial critiques and discussions on method of so many others.13 Research will therefore be primarily from ancient texts, many still in manuscript, especially those written by the practitioners of magic themselves rather than those written by their (predominantly Christian) adversaries. My approach to magic and current research position is very similar to Ritner when he wrote of Egyptian magic: To date, no treatment of Egyptian magic has concentrated upon the actual practice of the magician. Both general studies and textual publications have emphasized instead the religious elements in the contents of recited spell, while the accompanying instructions with their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actions remained uninvestigated. This study represents the first critical examination of such “magical techniques,” revealing their widespread appearance and pivotal significance for all Egyptian “religious” practices from the earliest periods through the Coptic era, influencing as well the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri.14 My objective is to take this enquiry forward from the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri to the grimoires of 19th century Europe. In the course of researching the main questions, a number of subsidiary questions arose, some of which needed to be answered before further progress could be made with addressing the main question: a. What are the defining qualities of Solomonic magic? b. What is the relationship between ritual magic and astral magic? c. What is the relationship between Greek and Hebrew Solomonic magical texts? d. What were the inputs from Jewish magic into the PGM, Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis? e. What is the date/place of first assembly or composition of the Hygromanteia? f. What was the original or correct title of the Hygromanteia? g. What is the origin of the pentacles section of the Clavicula Salomonis? h. What is meant by ‘manteia’ in the context of the Hygromanteia, and how does it relate to skrying?   13 Mastrocinque (2005), p. 7. 14 Ritner (2008), p.2."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 1.2. Review of the Scholarly Literature and Source Texts The core of the thesis is to examine source texts, in the first instance to identify and define specific techniques, after which these techniques will be pursued across the boundaries between cultures with the aid of secondary sources. The main texts in each category are therefore: Ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian Sources. These are in the broadest sense the Pyramid and Coffin texts, as have been edited by R. O. Faulkner (1973-78), followed by some chapters in the Book of the Dead.15 These texts by definition focus on post-mortem magic, and are not for the most part for the use of the living. Specific magical handbooks from the Dynastic period are therefore few. The most significant Demotic texts are from The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leyden, which was originally edited and translated by F. L. Griffith and Herbert Thompson (1904). Their translation has however been improved upon and incorporated in Hans Dieter Betz’s The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, including the Demotic Spells (1996). Robert Ritner’s The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice (2 Vols., 2008) is undoubtedly the best secondary text (for the purposes of this thesis) as it concentrates on the mechanics of specific magical techniques. The ten essays in Panagiotis Kousoulis’s Ancient Egyptian Demonology: Studies on the Boundaries between the Demonic and the Divine in Egyptian Magic (2011) expand Ritner’s work, and underline the point that demons/daemons in the Egyptian world do not have the negative connotations that later accreted to them, but act as intermediaries between the gods and man in a ritual context. Otto Neugebauer’s Egyptian Astronomical Texts III (1969) gives useful background to the selection of auspicious times by Egyptian magicians. Wallis Budge’s Amulets and Talismans (1970) shows the mass produced nature of many Egyptian amulets as opposed to the ‘made for one purpose’ talismans. Despite no longer being held in such high scholarly regard, the breadth of Budge’s research (across a wide range of cultures) and linguistic reach has seldom been matched by subsequent researchers. Erica Reiner’s Astral Magic in Babylonia (1995) is one of the best organised summaries of Mesopotamian magic, a source of some of the techniques examined in this thesis. The Graeco-Egyptian Magical Papyri. The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation edited by Betz (1996) is the key text for the Graeco-Egyptian magic in the Ptolemaic period and the first five centuries of the Christian era. To Betz must also be added Robert Daniel and Franco Maltomini’s Supplementum Magicum (1990/1992). Jacco Dieleman’s Priests, Tongues, and Rites   15 Budge (1967)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 (2005) supplements this with very useful background material.16 The original Greek texts, which are very useful for checking the exact meanings of key technical words, are to be found in Karl Preisendanz’s Papyri Graecae Magicae, Die Griechischen Zauberpapyri (1928/1931, revised and reprinted in 1973-74). William Brashear’s The Greek Magical Papyri: an Introduction and Survey (1994), is still the most systematic and well organised summary of the PGM. Other important secondary sources include Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (1995), and Christopher Faraone and Dirk Obbink, Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (1991) both of which contain key essays on the topic. John Gager, Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World (1992), is a very thorough study of one specific method (the defixiones) but also contains useful material on other forms of Graeco-Egyptian magic. Naomi Janowitz’s Magic in the Roman World: Pagans, Jews and Christians (2001), although a relatively slim volume, makes a number of very useful observations on the intersection of these three cultures, and draws a clear line between learned magic and witchcraft.17 Matthew Dickie in Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (2001) provides cogent background on the various shades of meaning of Latin and Greek terms for the different varieties of magic and divination.18 Greek and Roman Necromancy by Daniel Ogden (2001) ventures into the mechanics of necromancy and evocation from a classical Greek perspective, with excellent chapters on lecanomancy (bowl skrying) and the technology of necromancy and magic. Ogden takes a linguistic approach carefully distinguishing the different shades of meaning of the original Greek and Latin technical terms of magic, a very necessary approach. His Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds (2002) provides an excellent selection of classical sources, with incisive comments. Ioannis Petropoulos’ Greek Magic (2008), on the other hand, is a slim and disappointing collection of very short (some only two pages long) essays which treat their topics at a superficial level. A notable exception in this collection is the essay by Sarah Iles Johnston on ‘Magic and the Dead in Classical Greece.’ Theurgy. Undoubtedly the most important source for theurgy is Iamblichus. The most usable editions of the Greek text of De Mysteriis are those of Gustav Parthey (1857) and Des Places   16 Especially chapters on the various scripts (chapter 3); ingredients (chapters 4.3.1 and 6.2) and specific rituals (chapter 5). Dieleman (2005), pp. 64-80 also spells out the methods by which the scribes indicated the correct pronunciation of the nomina magica. 17 “The ancient practitioners [of magic] would have been horrified to be lumped together with “witches” and “warlocks” ” – Janowicz (2001), p. 3. 18 Interestingly his cover illustration is taken from the 1440 B2 manuscript of the Hygromanteia, rather than from a Late Antiquity source as one might have expected."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 (1996). The English translations of De Mysteriis include the charming but wordy translation by Thomas Taylor (1821), and that of Alexander Wilder (1911), but these have been surpassed by the 2003 translation by Clarke, Dillon and Hershbell. Emma Clarke’s Iamblichus De Mysteriis: a Manifesto of the Miraculous (2001) and Finamore and Dillon’s Iamblichus, De Anima (2002) provide useful background material. More recently, work by Ilinca Tanaseanu-Döbler in Theurgy in Late Antiquity has provided a window on the development of theurgy after Iamblichus. Although not directly involved with theurgy, Hans Lewy’s classic Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy: Mysticism, Magic and Platonism in the Later Roman Empire (1978) is necessary reading. Algis Uždavinys in Philosophy & Theurgy in Late Antiquity (2010) provides useful, if somewhat controversial, links between magic, theurgy and Neoplatonic philosophy in Late Antiquity. Byzantine Sources. In the early 20th century, most of the scholarly work on the Byzantine Greek texts was confined to the astrological rather than the magical aspects.19 The Testament of Solomon, published by Chester McCown in 1922, helped establish the existence of three important early (1st/2nd century CE) magical techniques: the procedure of binding spirits; the procedure of listing them in the form of a register, along with their powers, a procedure which became a hallmark of later Solomonic grimoires like the Lemegeton; and the mechanics of linking each daimon/demon20 with a corresponding thwarting angel.21 The Testament of Solomon provides a useful list of these demons and thwarting angels which partially maps on to the demon lists of the Hygromanteia (see Table 06). The most significant increase in the availability of texts of Byzantine manuals of magic occurred with the publication of a wide range of key Solomonic texts by Armand Delatte in his Anecdota Atheniensia in 1927. Delatte brought the magic of the Hygromanteia to public notice, as he also did for the Greek versions of geomancy.22 Of the Byzantine Greek Solomonic magical texts the Hygromanteia is the most numerous, relevant and detailed. For the most part it is still in manuscript, but some sections appear in transcript, translation and chapter summary in the secondary literature, as listed in Appendix 3. The most complete manuscript source is British Library Harley MS 5596. The publication in 2011, some time after the commencement of this thesis, by Ioannis Marathakis of partial translations of 12 manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, and his attendant commentary, is a welcome step forward in the study of this key text.   19 For example Heeg (1911) in CCAG, Vol. viii, 2. 20 Both spellings will be used in this thesis, with ‘daimon’ indicating a Greek source, and ‘demon’ a Latin or Christian source. 21 Each of these techniques will be enlarged upon later in this thesis. 22 Skinner, Geomancy (2011), pp. 42-44."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 The main secondary source is Richard Greenfield’s excellent Traditions of Belief in Late Byzantine Demonology (1988) which traces the antecedents of the Hygromanteia and where it fits into the continuum of belief in demons, both orthodox and popular. Pablo Torijano’s Solomon the Esoteric King: from King to Magus, Development of a Tradition (2002) is more focussed on Solomon in various contexts, as king, magician, etc. It also helpfully provides partial Greek transcripts of some of the manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, specifically manuscript M, but fails to give a coherent sense of the overall content, which appears only in a very sketchy form in several widely separated pages. Paul Magdalino and Maria Mavroudi provide necessary background material in The Occult Sciences in Byzantium (2006), together with useful insights into the career of Stephanos of Alexandria, a potential candidate for authorship. Henry Maguire’s Byzantine Magic (1995) gives much useful further analysis. Jewish Sources. The input of magical methods from these sources is not as great as is commonly thought. Bohak’s article ‘Hebrew, Hebrew Everywhere?’23 was a useful corrective to this common conception. It therefore became necessary to consider this input in order to correctly position the transmission of some magical techniques. The provenance and chronological relevance of the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh are considered in chapter 3.3. Amongst early texts, the Testament of Solomon is the most useful, as it enunciates features of the Solomonic method such as the use of rings and thwarting angels.24 A later source of Solomonic style magic is the Sepher Raziel, particularly in its 16th century Latin and English manuscript incarnations.25 Other Jewish works on magic are more concerned with the use and manipulation of the Hebrew nomina magica, and do not utilise the Solomonic method as such. Relevant texts which demonstrate the nature of Jewish magic include: Sepher ha-Levanah, translated by Kalnit Nachshon in Karr and Nachshon, Liber Lunae, the Book of the Moon & Sepher ha-Levanah (2011); Sepher ha-Razim edited by Mordecai Margalioth26 and the Harba de Moshe (Sword of Moses) translated by Moses Gaster, The Sword of Moses, an Ancient Book of Magic (1973). Regrettably, Gaster chose to replace many nomina magica with an ‘X,’ a procedure that has sadly not been rectified in more recent editions.27 Gideon Bohak in Ancient Jewish Magic (2008) and Joshua Trachtenberg in Jewish Magic and Superstition (2004), provide solid background material on Jewish magic, but much updating   23 Bohak (2003). 24 Translations by Duling (1983) and McCown (1922). 25 Karr and Skinner (2010). 26 Translated in Michael Morgan, Sepher Ha-Razim, the Book of the Mysteries (1983). 27 This omission has been partly rectified by Joseph Peterson on his website www.esotericarchives.com."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 needs to be done in the light of magical texts now emerging from the Cairo Genizah.28 Mastrocinque, in From Jewish Magic to Gnosticism (2005), provides an excellent and very useful bridge between Gnosticism and the progress of Jewish magic in the first few centuries CE. Surprisingly, the Kabbalah does not become relevant to the Solomonic method till the Renaissance, and then only through the medium of the Christianised Kabbalah. Much useful material on the use of amulets for the purposes of health or general protection can be found in Don Skemer’s Binding Words: Textual Amulets in the Middle Ages (2006). At least one of the manuscripts he examines has an importance for the history of the lamen, although simple amulets do not intersect with Solomonic magic at many points. Latin and Vernacular Grimoires. Of the Latin, Italian, French and English grimoires of the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, the most widely disseminated of all magical manuscripts is the Clavicula Salomonis. The 19th century translation by MacGregor Mathers (1909, 2000) is still a useful reference, and has been edited from a handful of manuscript sources, mainly of the Abraham Colorno Text-Group. Robert Mathiesen recently identified and began to categorise over 100 manuscripts of this text.29 The Veritable Key of Solomon edited by Skinner and Rankine (2008) has updated this classification, taking into account 125 manuscripts, and providing a more extensive analysis, as well as including a full translation of three more of the French manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis. Skinner and Rankine also produced an edition of the Lemegeton, under the title of The Goetia of Dr Rudd (2007),30 which looks at the techniques of the Solomonic method as it developed in the 17th century in England.31 An increasing number of vernacular grimoires has been edited and published over the last ten years, particularly by Joseph Peterson, providing much material for analysis: Lesser Key of Solomon (2001); Grimorium Verum (2007); Clavis or Key to the Magic of Solomon (2009); and Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses (2008). Commentaries based on these and other grimoires include Claire Fanger’s Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic (1998), as well as her excellent Invoking Angels: Theurgic Ideas and Practices, Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries (2012). John of Morigny, the Juratus and the Ars Notoria are central to her interests. Although the latter ascribes its authority to Solomon, it does not contain Solomonic ritual magic. Richard Kieckhefer’s Forbidden Rites: a Necromancer’s Manual of the Fifteenth Century (1995) is a major contribution   28 Although found over a century ago, the magical fragments have been ignored by scholars until the last couple of decades. See Schiffman (1992). 29 Mathiesen (2007), pp. 3-9. 30 Based on Sloane MS 6483. 31 The earliest as yet unpublished manuscript of the Goetia that I have discovered dates from 4th January 1494, 150 years prior to the earliest manuscript documented by Joseph Peterson."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 to the fund of published Solomonic grimoires, and Benedek Láng’s Unlocked Books (2008), provides an excellent survey of grimoires in lesser explored central European libraries. Frank Klaassen’s The Transformations of Magic (2013) is, like Claire Fanger’s books, mostly focussed on the Juratus and Ars Notoria, but does tend to blur the boundary between ritual magic and astral magic. Where he notices interesting texts such as the Vinculum Salomonis or Liber Consecrationum, he fails to explore their contents in any detail or to set them within the continuum of the development of the grimoire. Several significant journal articles have been published recently which have stressed the evolution of god and angel names across the whole geographical and chronological spectrum from the Graeco-Egyptian papyri through to European grimoires, although omitting the intermediate steps passing through the Byzantine texts. These are Julien Véronèse’s ‘God’s Names and their Uses in the Books of Magic attributed to King Solomon’ (2010) and especially David Porreca’s ‘Divine Names’ (2010). An as yet unpublished Ph.D thesis kindly lent to me by Liana Saif on The Arabic Theory of Astral Influences in Early Modern Occult Philosophy (2011) provides information on the roots of astral magic and its relationship to the ongoing development of magic in Europe. Although it does not specifically touch upon Solomonic magic, it covers the parallel line of transmission of astral magical knowledge via Harran and Toledo in such texts as the Picatrix, making clear the distinctions between ritual and astral magic. Boudet, Caiozzo and Weill-Parot in Images et Magie: Picatrix entre Orient et Occident provide an even clearer line of demarcation. Among the more recent and wide ranging products of modern scholarship, mention should be made of Wouter Hanegraaff’s Esotericism and the Academy (2012) and Bernd-Christian Otto and Michael Stausberg’s Defining Magic: a Reader (2013)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 The Corpus to be Analysed The primary texts in each cultural area are: a) The Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri, as edited by Betz in The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation.32 All translations from Greek are from Betz (1996) and his contributors, with some marked amendments derived directly from the Greek in Preisendanz (1928, 1931) by the present author. b) The manuscripts of Byzantine Greek Solomonic magical texts of the Hygromanteia as they appear in 17 manuscripts scattered in various European libraries.33 All translations are from Marathakis (2011), unless otherwise stated. c) The Latin, Italian, English, French and Hebrew Clavicula Salomonis and grimoires of the Middle Ages and later, specifically the Key of Solomon, found in over more than 125 manuscripts.34 All translations from French are from Skinner and Rankine (2008), supplemented by Mathers (1909).

M ethodology John Walton contended that a comparative study of religion and magic in a Near Eastern context should have just four methods and goals: historical, archaeological, literary and linguistic.35 The present thesis touches upon the history in chapter 2; examines the literature in chapter 3, but only of one specific genre (magicians’ handbooks); utilises linguistics to trace the transition of god, angel, daimon and spirit names across cultures in chapters 4, 5 and Appendix 5; and touches upon archaeology only where necessary for the identification of magical implements in chapter 6. The history of magic, and related subjects, can be tackled in a number of ways: 1. as a history of the main figures involved in the subject. Typically a history of literature might take this approach, outlining the lives of each of the great authors. 2. related to this is the setting of a subject in its social milieu. Norman Cohen’s Europe’s Inner Demons (1977) is a persuasive example of this, in relation to witchcraft history. 3. as a history of documents, manuscripts and books, an approach exemplified by Lynn Thorndike’s A History of Magic and Experimental Sciences (1925-1958). 4. as a history of the development of the main theories or ideas, their adoption, mutation, and abandonment. 5. as a history of the development of practical techniques. Obviously some histories employ the whole range of modes. In the case of magic, popular histories most often take the first approach of outlining the lives of famous, or infamous, practitioners. More scholarly texts, before 1990, take the second approach and try to show the development of attitudes to magic and witchcraft in terms of the social or legal setting, particularly in the case of witchcraft trials, or where magic has clashed with Christianity. Thorndike and Henry Lea’s Materials Towards a History of Witchcraft are examples par excellence of the third approach. The recent history of theoretical physics is a good example of the fourth approach, where successive theories have been discovered, discarded, or radically modified, over time.36 A history of engineering or chemistry might very well be written in the fifth manner.   35 Walton (2006), p. 28. 36 Only one subject, geometry, does not show this progressive overthrow of one set of theories by another over time. Theorems set out by Euclid 2500 years ago remain unchallenged today."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 In terms of magic, the fourth and fifth approaches have seldom been attempted. Modern researchers, trained in scientific method, and conditioned to assume that there is nothing methodical about magic, may have difficulty accepting that a discipline such as magic may have well defined techniques which have been employed and improved upon by a succession of intelligent and experimentally orientated practitioners over time. This is precisely what I intend to do in this thesis, to examine the development of a selection of key techniques used and recorded by magicians37 themselves over the period 200 BCE to 1900 CE ranging from the Graeco-Egyptian magic of Alexandria, via Byzantine Solomonic magic to the Solomonic grimoires of Western Europe. Although there is an historical and geographical backdrop to the subject of this thesis, the methodology is primarily internal textual analysis, rather than an examination of the historical or social context, which would necessitate a much longer thesis. A pertinent passage sums up the methodological approach to magic in this thesis: The question of how to approach the subject of magic is belaboured unnecessarily. There now exists consensus that, functioning within an appropriate causal framework, magic is just another form of technology or applied science. This should be the simple and acceptable starting point for an investigation...38 The research methodology is therefore qualitative historical research based on archival manuscript sources and published editions of primary texts, designed to identify specific concrete techniques, formulations, nomina magica, and implements used by practitioners of magic across this period. This is an intercultural study documenting the development and transmission of examples of magical practice, rather than of magical beliefs, ideas or theories. The first step in the analysis of the contents of the PGM was to analyse the various sections and sub-sections of every single passage in every papyrus included therein, grouping them by desired outcome and rite type. Clearly the invocation of a god is quite different from the construction of an amulet to reduce fever, even if the same god’s name is used in both procedures. A basic taxonomy of the rite-types of magical procedure was thus established, and every section and subsection of the Graeco-Egyptian papyri allocated to one or other of these categories, so that similar material could be analysed together despite a wide separation by pagination, period, provenance or papyrus. This was then tabulated to bring similar operations together for comparison, and to assist in the identification of patterns.39 The same approach was taken with the Hygromanteia, in which 59 sections or ‘chapters’ were   37 Used in the sense of ‘practitioners of magical techniques’ without any attribution of special powers to them. 38 From a review by T. Langermann of P. Travaglia, Magic, Causality and Intentionality: The Doctrine of Rays in al-Kindi, Florence, 1999, as quoted in Magdalino and Mavroudi (2006), p. 44. 39 See Appendix 2 for the full tabulation."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 identified.40 This clarified the structure of the text, so that it became apparent that chapters on, for example, skrying were all grouped together at the end of the text. It also pointed up the presence of two different methods of evocation, and the segregation of a separate group of chapters concerned with the equipment. Much of the work of identifying the content of chapters in the Clavicula Salomonis has already been done,41 and this previous work was built upon. From these listings a clear indication of which sections, or procedures have been transmitted, and which have not, has been derived. The connections between the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis were then tabulated to precisely identify the overlap or missing sections (such as the chapter on pentacles). The research has been evidence-based. Having established a set list of discrete techniques, formulations, nomina magica and implements; instances of their occurrence in each of the sources were then identified. Any commonalities (or discontinuities) were then evaluated, indicating how much of a particular technique/item is common, and possible reasons why it has either evolved, transmitted but remained the same, or ceased to be part of the magician’s repertoire. These commonalities were finally mapped on to an extended Venn diagram to visually convey the results of this research in a more simplified form (see Figure 62). The discovery of discontinuities has been one of the more fertile areas of research. For example, the sudden appearance of pentacles in the Clavicula Salomonis, while only rudimentary seals appeared in the Hygromanteia, resulted in research which uncovered their previously unnoticed (Jewish) source. It is not the purpose of this study to determine if the techniques were effective. It is sufficient to note that the magicians using them thought them to be so. Nor is it the purpose of this study to examine the reaction of non-magicians, or of society at large, to the use of these techniques. The Background of the Research Because the subject is magic, many researchers in the past have approached the material as if its procedures were inherently unworthy of close study and devoid of historical development, content, consistency or interest. I propose to show that individual magical practices and techniques are not arbitrary, nor simply invented, nor dreamed up by practitioners in isolation. Further, that these practices are almost invariably based on earlier practices in the same or a different culture, with a gradual modification of technique over time, depending partly on the changing cultural and religious milieu, but more noticeably   40 The chapter numbering follows Marathakis (2011), pp. 362-365, with a few minor rearrangements. 41 Skinner & Rankine (2008), pp. 425-28."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 changing because of refinements, improvements, or simplification of techniques. In other words, these are the types of changes that occur within the development of any technology. Nomina magica and nomina barbara are, I believe, simply words whose original roots, free of corruption, have not yet been established, rather than being deliberately created nonsense words. The exception to this is Greek vowel strings, which anyway indicate the seven planets, and have no other meaning as such. In the course of examining these magical techniques, a surprising degree of consistency is apparent over a long period, and in various cultural contexts, from Alexandrian Egypt, through Byzantine Greece and mediaeval Europe, to 17th century England. Seldom has an analytical approach to the mechanics of the subject of magic been taken. This is precisely what I intend to do in this thesis, to examine the development of these key techniques used and recorded by magicians themselves over the time periods and in the cultures defined above. Almost all previous work in this field has concentrated on one or other of these groups of documents, or just one of the periods mentioned above, in isolation. That approach means that to a large extent the analysis of individual ritual practices tends to be difficult and speculative, for without knowledge of their roots and evolution over time, it is difficult to see their original rationale or even their current meaning. This is particularly true of magic, where the sources can be sparse, and the understanding of their rationale limited. Once the line of historical development of individual techniques is known, and the original modus operandi behind each technique or practice understood, then the rationale for each practice, its method, and its place in the history of magic, becomes a lot clearer. By tracking the development of specific magical techniques through time, the ability to see the development of the whole tradition is expanded, and the nature of what exactly magic was, to those who practised it, will hopefully be clarified. Therefore the definition of ‘magic’ used here, must be one that its practitioners would have recognized and been comfortable with, rather than one that fits the worldview of the modern historian, theologian, anthropologist or sociologist. The hoped for outcome of this study is that the actual methods of magic, and the chronological relationships between the development of these techniques in each of these geographical and cultural areas examined will be made much clearer, enabling future researchers to more accurately understand the thinking behind the use of each of these techniques, and so interpret them correctly in terms of their own area of specialisation, rather than having to sometimes guess at their meaning. Hopefully this thesis will also aid in the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 dating and tracing of the primary texts, the handbooks used by the magicians themselves. The significance of this research is that by showing the historic development of these practices over an extended time period, their roots can be ascertained and verified, and the reasons behind apparently arbitrary ritual behaviour explored and explained. At the same time some of the original words of invocation (nomina magica) can be restored, and the nature of equipment, ingredients and otherwise previously inexplicable ritual actions will in many cases become apparent, giving the whole field of research into Solomonic magical ritual behaviour and method a more concrete basis and cogent framework of reference. No comprehensive treatment of magic, as far as I know, has focused on the actual practices of the magician in both a European and eastern Mediterranean context. General studies have instead investigated the historical background, religious elements, or social and legal conditions which perpetuated, or persecuted, or surrounded it (for example European witchcraft histories). The actual magical procedures, the materials, instruments, sequences of ritual actions, and the origins of many nomina magica, have to date remained uninvestigated."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 1.4. Scope of the Study and Definitions of Terminology By using the term ‘magician’ there is no implied or overt claim for special powers on the part of the practitioners, simply an assertion that the people so designated were practitioners of magical techniques.42 The term ‘spell’ will seldom be used, but where it is used it simply refers to any technique practised by a magician involving verbal invocation. The term ‘rite’ covers any magical or religious ritual procedure. The fact that such techniques have been utilized consistently over long periods of time often by learned people suggests that some apparent consistency of results was obtained. Otherwise if no such consistency of results had been obtained, then one might expect to find a wide and random diversity of fantasy techniques being independently invented and speculatively tried out at different times and in different cultures: but this is not the case. Of course the great conservativeness of magicians might be invoked to explain this consistency. As William Brasher once remarked: These two papyri, the Philinna papyrus and the Oxyrhynchus parallel, written as they were five to six centuries apart from each other, provide remarkable testimony to the conservatism of magic and magicians in antiquity.43 Although mankind has a long history of discarding methods that do not work, yet many detailed magical techniques survived literally for thousands of years. As Betz puts it: It is one of the puzzles of all magic that from time immemorial it has survived throughout history, through the coming and going of entire religions, the scientific and technological revolutions, and the triumphs of modern medicine. Despite all these changes, there has always been an unbroken tradition of magic. Why is magic so irrepressible and ineradicable, if it is also true that its claims and promises never come true? Or do they?44 However it is not the intention of this thesis to correlate these methods with their effectiveness, but rather to chart the evolution of the methods themselves. Just as it is not necessary to believe in Darwinism to be involved in the taxonomy of plant and animal classification, so it is not necessary to believe in the efficaciousness of magic in order to chart the different varieties and the evolution of its techniques. Before proceeding I would like to clarify the scope of this thesis by eliminating from this discussion a number of subjects and techniques often associated with magic, in popular literature, but which are not a part of learned Solomonic ritual magic.   42 Just as the terms ‘carpenter’ or ‘priest’ define a trade or a profession, rather than a claim to special skill or special sanctity. 43 Brashear (1998), p. 374. 44 Betz (1996), p. xlvii-xlviii."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Magic versus Divination Although divination is often seen as part of magic, divination is essentially a passive method, whereas magic is nothing if not proactive. Divination seeks to foretell the future, while magic seeks to change the future. Therefore those techniques relating to prediction like astrology, geomancy, or tarot will not be part of this study. An exception will be made in the case of electional astrology. Electional and katarchic astrology have been used from time immemorial by magicians to determine the best time to conduct a rite. A second exception will be made in the case of techniques like lychnomanteia, lekanomanteia and hygromanteia, which were included in the PGM and practised throughout the Byzantine period, where skrying is supplemented by active ritual evocation of spirits. Oracles, although a few are present in the PGM, are not part of magic.45 Emilie Savage-Smith makes that distinction: That magic seeks to alter the course of events, usually by calling upon a superhuman force...while divination attempts to predict future events (or gain information about things unseen) but not necessarily to alter them.46 As Fritz Graf concludes, the confusion between magic and divination dates from the Christian era: Only when divination is read in terms of demonology, as in mainstream Christian discourse, do divination and magic converge.47 Otherwise these two fields of endeavour are not really connected. Learned Magic versus Folk Magic Secondarily, I would like to eliminate ‘village magic’, ‘low magic’ or ‘folk magic’ from this study. The present study will concentrate upon ‘learned magic’ rather than folk or village magic.48 The former is much better documented, as it was usually practised by literate members of the ruling establishment or priestly class in every culture being analysed. The latter is by its very nature passed on verbally, often by illiterate practitioners, and therefore has left very little trace in terms of cogent written remains. If required, it can also be easily demonstrated that the style of magic used by these two classes is also very different. In the ancient world magic was considered to be very real, and not a random assemblage of nonsense actions and words, and the insiders who practised it: ...were far from illiterate, and some of these magical texts even display the scribal hands,   45 In most cases these ‘oracles’ are in fact invocations of a god in order to receive answers or advice. 46 Savage-Smith (2004), p. xiii. 47 Graf (2011), p. 133. 48 See Benedek Lang (2008), chapter 1 for definitions."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 writing styles, and modes of textual production which come only with many years of scribal learning and practice. Moreover, when we do find evidence outside the actual magical texts as to who practiced such magical rituals, that evidence repeatedly demonstrates the acceptance, and even practice, of magic by members of the Jewish elite, including the religious establishment itself... Most of these sources were not the product of Jewish “folk magic,” but of “intellectual magic,” produced by learned experts who mastered a specialized body of knowledge and consulted many different sources, sometimes in more than one language.49 Although these comments were applied to Jewish magic, they are equally applicable to other forms of European or Mediterranean littoral learned magic. Likewise, Egyptian magicians were mostly of the priestly class, and later in the Europe of the Middle Ages, grimoires beautifully written in Ecclesiastical Latin were found often in the possession of aristocrats or highly educated clerics. It is this “specialised body of knowledge” in all of these cultures which is the object of this study. Learned Magic versus Witchcraft Thirdly, I would also like to eliminate at this stage, the terms ‘witch’ and ‘witchcraft’ from this discussion of ritual magic. ‘Witch’ is a much abused term. It reputedly comes from the Anglo-Saxon word wicca which means ‘wise woman’ and implies village cunning woman, who traditionally used techniques quite different from the practitioner of learned magic, as outlined above. There is in fact no word for ‘witch’ in Latin, because the concept in its current form was absent from the ancient world, no matter how often commentators have attempted to impose it retrospectively. When Heinrich Kramer decided to write his infamous Malleus Maleficarum, he used the word ‘maleficarum’ as the best substitute. Despite this title often being translated as ‘The Hammer of the Witches’, the word maleficus simply meant ‘wicked or criminal,’ and initially had no specific tinge of ‘magic’ about it. Despite maleficarum being feminine, the term still does not directly equate with witch. As ‘witch’ is a word that was not used in antiquity, being of Anglo-Saxon derivation, it is not relevant to the present study which is of techniques firmly rooted in antiquity. ‘Wicca’ (or Wica) is a term which is not attested until 1086,50 and certainly not at any time in Middle Eastern, Graeco-Egyptian or Roman practice.51 Witchcraft is therefore primarily concerned with European village or folk magic from the 11th century to the late 17th century. Any subsequent use of the term is a dilution or perversion of its original meaning, which helps to obscure its original meaning. Modern neo-witchcraft reconstructed in the 1950s and 1960s by Gerald Gardner, Alex Sanders, etc., has no part of this study, nor has the application of this   49 Bohak (2008), p. 36. 50 Latham (1965), p. 522. 51 Except where scholars have retroactively applied the term to ancient practices."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 word to non-European, Asian or African cultures. Researchers such as Keith Thomas have made a clear distinction between the witchcraft practised at the village level and the learned magic of more literate practitioners, often priests or lawyers: By this period popular magic and intellectual magic were essentially two different activities, overlapping at certain points, but to a large extent carried on in virtual independence of each other. Most of the magical techniques of the village wizard [or witch] had been inherited from the Middle Ages, and had direct links with Anglo-Saxon [magical practice]... they were only slightly affected by the Renaissance revival of magical inquiry or by the learned volumes which were its most characteristic product.52 There is a clear distinction between the simple spells or cantrips of witches or village cunning folk, and the traditions of learned magic. Simple rhymed spells offered by local witches are quite distinct from the full ceremonial of learned magic, which is primarily confined to the class that could both read Latin and had the leisure and space to perform such rituals.53 Witchcraft was handed down from one practitioner to another, often within the same family, was seldom written up in books of practice, and relied upon herbs, dolls, images and adapted household goods and simple materia magica. Learned magic is that form of magic practised from complex handbooks (grimoires) requiring inscribed circles, much preparation, robes, and pre-consecrated equipment such as pentacles and lamens. Greenfield also makes the point quite emphatically that Byzantine Solomonic magic has no connection whatsoever with witchcraft: The first point to be made here is that evidence of late Byzantine belief concerning the use of demons by men falls almost entirely into the realm of sorcery as opposed to witchcraft. The idea of the inherently evil, inherently demonic man or woman, the classic figure of witchcraft, is absent, and it is apparent that the Byzantines thought of magic as being almost exclusively performed by sorcerers and magicians who learnt their techniques from teachers or books, who practiced and perfected their...craft.54 The term witch, not being a Greek word, also does not appear in any of the Byzantine magical handbooks.55 Under the same heading, I would like to eliminate the study of ancient Greek folk magic, especially as found in Thessaly, to which the label ‘witchcraft’ has been   52 Thomas (1978), p. 271. Strangely senior lawyers and politicians make up a high proportion of the recorded angel magicians of the 17th century. See Skinner and Rankine (2010), pp. 43-47. 53 In the 20th century, with almost universal literacy, you might have expected such a division to have broken down. This has occurred, but only in the last half of the 20th century where practitioners like Gerald Gardner were aware of, and attempted to mix, both styles of magic to forge Wicca or modern ‘witchcraft.’ 54 Greenfield (1988), pp. 249-50. 55 Only one figure that might be interpreted as a witch appears in the story of Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe, a well known Greek romance from 1310-1340, in the fairy tale genre. She is described as demonic, and associates closely with demons, and at the end of the poem she is condemned to be burned “like a witch.” But none of her actions in the poem relate to the magical texts we are considering here."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 retroactively applied by some scholars.56 Ritual Magic versus Astral Magic Having now indicated the historic, geographic and taxonomical limits of this study, it is necessary now to sub-divide learned magic. Magic first divides into ‘astral magic’ and ‘ritual magic.’ It is useful to observe how the definitions of these two species of magic evolved historically. In the context of Islam, Ibn Nadim (c. 930-995/998 CE) in the encyclopaedic Kitāb al-Fihrist distinguished four different types of magic (sihr):57 1. Mu’azzimun, which is closest to Solomonic ritual magic, seeks to subjugate devils, jinn, and spirits via the licit method of invocations reinforced by purity, devotion, prayer, and fasting. This is effectively the Solomonic ritual magic method. 2. Deals with demons, jinn, and spirits, but involves instead offering them illicit sacrifices, and probably concurrently leading a dissolute life;58 3. Astral magic concerned with the passive charging of talismans and the associated astrological calculations;59 4. Tricks and sleight of hand. Four centuries later Ibn Khaldūn (1332-1406), who drew some of his ideas from the Picatrix, distinguished only two types of magic (amalgamating the first two types of Ibn Nadim, and ignoring the fourth): 1. Illicit demonic magic, identified as sorcery (which includes Solomonic magic); 2. Talismanic magic, acting upon the world of the elements using the ‘spiritualities of the stars,’ numbers, the corresponding qualities of physical things, and the position of the stars in the firmament.60 Perhaps the longest 16th century list of books on magic is to be found in the Antipalus Maleficiorum of Trithemius, which contains in excess of 77 titles. It dates from 1508, but was not published till 1605. This list clearly makes the distinction between books of ritual   56 The much quoted passage in the Greek text of Lucian (Vol. VII, 281) Dialogues of the Courtesans is translated by Macleod as: “Don’t you know that her mother, Chrysarium, is a witch who knows Thessalian spells, and can bring the moon down?” The word translated as ‘witch’ is \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0005\u0006\u0007. It is now recognized that pharmakis is much more closely allied to root-cutting, the compounding of herbal potions and poisoning than to magic, although it is recognized that such women may, like courtesans, also deal in magic. 57 Ibn Nadim (1964). For English translation see Dodge (1970). 58 This is somewhat closer to the Faustian view of magic, where the pact is important. 59 See Saif (2011). 60 See Ibn Khaldoun (1967), 18, p. 372-3. He attributes the science of talisman to the Greeks and Persians, who (he says) received it from the Chaldaeans and Syrians."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 Solomonic magic and those of astral magic.61 Trithemius characterises the first 40 of these books as necromancy (by which he meant nigromancy, or the black art, rather than the conjuration of the dead), and most of these first 40 titles are Solomonic in nature. The following 37 books in this catalogue, are separated by Trithemius who makes a clear distinction between the foregoing books of necromancy (dealing with the evocation of spirits and demons) and the following 37 books on astral magic that deal with planetary images, figures, rings, seals often attributed to Hermes or Kyranides,62 the sympathetic connections between stars, plants, stones and animals, and their use in talismanic magic. In 1486 Ficino and Pico explored the possibility of the existence of another category, Natural Magic, operated without the intervention of spirits or demons, and with only minor input from the stars.63 Trithemius’ pupil, Henry Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535), divided magic into three types, following the same split of ritual magic and astral magic, but with the additional (and theologically necessary) category of Natural Magic: 64 1. Ceremonial Magic. Theological Magic, which is effectively Ritual Magic dealing with invocation/evocation of angels and demons; 2. Mathematical Magic (which Saif equates with talismanic astral magic, but which also includes astrology);65 3. Natural Magic, such as is to be found in various ‘Books of Secrets.’66 Natural magic might reasonably be seen as dealing directly with nature, utilising herbs, animals and minerals to bring about surprising effects. Natural magic was considered licit because it did not claim to involve the intervention of spirits. In a sense this was the prelude to the scientific study of nature. Amongst modern scholars, Ronald Hutton has divided the progress of magic in Western Europe into three periods,67 and makes a distinction between: 1. Astral magic coming via Arabic texts translated into Latin (from Harran, via Spain and Byzantium) in the 12th-13th centuries; and 2. Grimoire magic derived from the Hygromanteia in the late 15th – 16th centuries. Maybe he should have presented these as separate streams, rather than separate periods, as   61 These are listed in full in Latin in Zambelli (2007), pp. 102-112.

He categorises his first stream as “scholastic image magic...epitomized by certain texts of Arabic image magic,” which is usually referred to as ‘astral magic.’ Works of this type include the books of Thābit ibn Qurra’s De imaginibus (10th century), the De imaginibus of Belenus,70 Liber Lunae,71 the work of the Brethren of Purity, the Ikwan al Safa and significant portions of the Picatrix (11th century).72 The second stream he categorises as comprising “ritual magic texts, such as the notary art or necromancy” which: ...employ complex Christian ritual and are, very much, the progeny of the liturgy and Christian religious sensibilities.73 This is a far too limited a definition. He might be correct if he were only referring to a few of the very Christianised grimoires (such as that of John of Morigny), but not if he is referring to the whole corpus of ritual magic (‘necromancy’) prior to 1500, because it involved procedures and elements of many cultures other than Christian. Additionally the Ars Notoria is a pietistic and prayerful procedure rather than a clear-cut example of ritual magic. The Ars Notoria relies upon a succession of prayers added to the contemplation of notae which provided for rapid assimilation of a range of subjects. There is reliance upon angels, but no evocation of spirits. Michael Greer and Christopher Warnock also make the distinction: Unlike the later [ritual] magic of the grimoires, these workings [of astral magic] required little ceremony and made only limited use of divine names and words of power; their effectiveness came from the heavens [i.e. astrology].74 To summarise the first stream, ‘image’ magic or astral magic, which came from the Hermetic and Muslim world especially Harran in Mesopotamia, arrived in Europe via the translators working in Spain from the 11th century onwards, but fell out of favour in Europe in the 17th century. It relied upon the engraving or drawing of images at an appropriate moment of   68 He has a third category/stream which he defines as ‘archaeology influencing magic,’ but this does not seem to be part of the same conceptual set, and is therefore omitted. 69 Klaassen (1999), pp. 2-3. 70 Belenus or Bālīnūs is the Arabic form of Apollonius of Tyana, formed by dropping the initial ‘A’ (as if it were the definite article) and swapping ‘p’ and ‘b’ which sound very alike to an Arabic speaker. 71 Karr & Skinner (2011). 72 Boudet (2011). 73 Klaassen (1999), p. 3. 74 Greer and Warnock, (2010-11), p 13."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 time, often in relationship to the 28 Mansions of the Moon. Astral magic is excluded from this study. Distinctions within Learned Ritual Magic We are therefore left with learned ritual magic. This may in turn be subdivided. The Greeks made a clear distinction between goetia (\b\t\u000b\f\u0006\u0002) the magic of the goes (\b\r\u0007),75 and that of theurgia (\u000e\f\t\u000f\u0003\b\u0006\u0002). Theurgia is a descendant via Porphyry and Iamblichus of the ancient Mysteries. This usage has persisted through to 13th century (and later) grimoires.76 It has been suggested that theurgia, meaning “divine work,” was a term probably invented by a group of Neoplatonically inclined magicians, including luminaries like Iamblichus of Chalcis,77 probably based in Alexandria around the 2nd century CE.78 The theurgists were concerned with purifying and raising the consciousness of individual practitioners to the point where they could have direct communion with the gods. The theurgists were in a sense the inheritors of the ancient Greek Mysteries which aimed to introduce the candidate to the gods. There are three sections in the PGM which give instructions in these procedures, and these are categorised as type ‘M’ in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. The goes, the practitioner of goetia (\b\t\u000b\f\u0006\u0002), on the other hand, attempts to bring daimones/demons onto the physical plane and to manifest them, or their effects.79 The relationship of the practitioners of theurgia to practitioners of the goetia is that both attempt to invoke/evoke a spiritual creature (god, angel, daimon, demon). The teletai (\u000b\f\u0010\f\u000b\u0002\u0006) priest does it for the benefit of the client’s soul while the goes does it to benefit the client’s material desires. Dickie is of the opinion that: ...although there are indications that goetes, epodoi, magoi and pharmakeis originally pursued quite different callings, there is no indication when the terms are first encountered in the fifth century that they refer to specialised forms of magic.80 Although it may well be true that there is too little evidence available from their earliest mentions to separate their specialised forms of magic, this is not true of later usage of the terms, where goetes and magoi are quite distinct. Amongst the later European grimoires, titles like the Goetia for example, use this term to specifically describe a particular style of magic which involves the evocation of spirits or demons: this is the meaning that will be observed in   75 Goetia (\b\t\u000b\f\u0006\u0002) and goes (\b\r\u0007) are here used in the sense they acquired later in the Latin grimoires of ‘dealing with spirits,’ rather than in the sense outlined in Johnston (1999), pp. 102-103 of ‘dealing with the dead.’ 76 Juratus defines ‘theurgy’ as a “sacramental rite, [or] ‘mystery.’” 77 Apart from Iamblichus, the other main source for theurgy is Proclus, a 5th century Neoplatonist. See also Johnston (2008) and Struck (2004), chapters 6-7 on Proclus. 78 Johnston (2008), p. 150. 79 ‘Goetia’ is used in this thesis in the sense used by Cornelius Agrippa rather than the ancient Greeks. 80 Dickie (2001), pp. 14-15."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 this thesis. I will henceforth be using the word goetia in that sense only, rather than trying to pin down its elusive meaning prior to the Christian era. It is not surprising to find specific formulae or words migrating from one category to another, or religion to magic, given that the priests, teletai-priests and magicians might often be the same men (as they certainly were in ancient Egypt). As Betz states: According to Egyptian practice, the magician was a resident member of the temple priesthood... The papyri also provide many insights into the phenomena of the magician as a religious functionary, in both the Egyptian and Hellenistic setting.81 This overlap should not cause confusion, as (in the absence of a Victorian viewpoint like that of Frazer) it is no longer necessary to see religion as higher and magic as lower. In fact the reverse might be held to be true, if one conceives of the procedures of religion simply as the exoteric and public forms of the Mysteries, which in turn might have been the doorway to training in magic. Solomonic Magic Solomonic magic is a form of magic which concerns itself with invoking/evoking a wide range of ‘spiritual creatures,’82 including the gods, daimones, angels, demons, spirits and sometimes the dead. The hallmarks of Solomonic magic are: 1. Solomonic magic is learned magic, relying primarily upon written material for its transmission. 2. The magician will always be enclosed in a magical circle when evoking/invoking. 3. Procedures will involve a number of magical implements which will have been consecrated prior to the main operation. 4. The nomina magica used to compel the spirits will often be of Jewish origin, but not exclusively so. 5. The format of the invocations has a structure and specific sequential method: consecratio dei; invocatio; evocatio; ligatio; licentia.83 6. Manuscripts of Solomonic magic are systematic treatises and not just a collection of unconnected magical recipes.   81 Betz (1996), p. xlvi. 82 See discussion of this term later in this chapter. 83 See Agrippa (2005), pp. 39-55 and Skinner and Rankine (2007), pp. 91-94 for an explanation of this typically Solomonic sequence of operations."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 7. The putative author is often (but not always) listed as King Solomon,84 and mention may be made of his son Rehoboam, although these techniques were almost certainly not invented by the historical King Solomon. They may not even necessarily be of Jewish origin.85 8. Some Solomonic manuscripts include a second ‘book’ with a range of up to 49 planetary pentacles, whose origin will be considered in chapter 5.4.2. The use of a protective circle, the prior consecration of implements, the nomina magica and the five sequential steps will be in this thesis referred to as the ‘Solomonic method.’ Thus some grimoires, like the Ars Notoria, do not use the Solomonic method as defined above, but rather rely upon prayers and notae.86 Working Definition of Magic Before proceeding, it is necessary to define the term ‘magic’ as it is the subject of this thesis. The most fundamental problem for modern academics in defining ‘magic’ is that any accurate definition of magic must involved the concepts of another world of spirits, demons and gods. For an atheist, for whom these entities simply do not exist, the problem of defining the art or science that deals with them is insoluble. This is not meant as a condescending statement, just one which suggests that analysis of any subject cannot be satisfactorily begun if the basic premises of that subject (be they true or false) are overlooked or completely omitted. This situation is what lies at the root of modern difficulties with the definition of magic. Such attempts at defining magic are on a par with a scientist who does not believe in the existence of radio waves, yet tries to explain the functioning of a radio: it cannot be done without making a nonsense of the definition. Maybe the procedure of physicists, who define a theoretical particle, and then proceed to see if its behaviour fits their mathematical models, is an appropriate way of proceeding. The equivalent of this is to accept the theoretical existence of gods, demons and spirits, and then to move on from there to define magic in terms of their manipulation. In the ancient world the existence of daemons, spirits and gods was a given. Any definition recognizable to, and welcomed by, its ancient practitioners would have to include mention of daemons, gods, spirits, etc. And, more importantly, it would then be a definition which allows for reasonable discourse about the subject.   84 Other ‘Solomonic’ authors or pseudo-authors/editors include Rabbi Solomon, Toz Graec, Rabbi Abognazer, Armadel, Geo Peccatrix, etc. Discussion of the real identity of these authors is only incidental to the objectives of this thesis. The term ‘Solomonic’ will therefore be used as an identifier of typical content rather than author. 85 Despite many of the god and angel names being of Jewish origin, the method appears not to be. 86 Elaborate drawings relating to specific subjects of the Trivium or Quadrivium."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 As so many scholars have laboured unsuccessfully to create a modern definition of the term magic, I intend to cut the Gordian knot by utilising a definition which is much closer to the sense the ancients gave it, by returning to the original meaning of magia, with a meaning that would have been understood by its practitioners in Late Antiquity. If this involves a nod in the direction of the existence of gods, daimones and spirits, then so be it. Without such a nod, the effort resembles that of the man who would describe chess without acknowledging the existence of the invisible rules which govern the movement of the individual pieces. Such rules have no real existence, but without them the game of chess is impossible to play, or to write sensible commentary upon. Likewise it is very difficult to examine or comment upon magic without acknowledging the ‘spiritual creatures’ which are part of its basic premises as understood by its practitioners. For the purpose of this thesis I would therefore like to propose a working definition of magic that is based on how it was practised in the Greek speaking Mediterranean, and which avoids modernization, social theory, or the moral challenges of theological definition: Magic is the art of causing change through the agency of spiritual creatures rather than via directly observable physical means: such spiritual creatures being compelled, or persuaded to assist, by the use of sacred words or names, talismans, symbols, incense, sacrifices and materia magica. Here ‘spiritual’ is defined to mean non-physical, with no ethical connotation, and ‘spiritual creature’ to mean a non-physical entity, ranging in definition or substance from elementals, spirits, demons, daimones, angels, archangels, even gods, to discarnate humans (both saintly and prematurely dead).87 The use of this terminology which was in widespread use in Europe up to the 16th century,88 might be hard for modern readers to digest, particularly those who come from a Judaeo-Christian background where the notion of ‘spirituality’ is totally opposed to the very existence of spirits. In modern times the word ‘spiritual’ surfaces in the practices of ‘spiritualism’ or ‘spiritism’ where the medium deals with discarnate entities and the dead alike, but the term is still not understood in its wider meaning. So for the purposes of this thesis ‘spiritual creature’89 will be understood in exactly the way Dr John Dee90 (1527-1608) understood it in the late 16th century when he wrote:   87 The term ‘spiritual creature’ also saves the tiresome need to write out “gods, goddesses, spirits, demons, daimones, angels, archangels and elementals” every time they all need to be mentioned. 88 This definition obviously does not cover ‘natural magic’ which was a category mentioned by Agrippa, and in current use by the Renaissance, probably devised specifically to avoid opposition from the Church, by eliminating spirits and demons from its definition. 89 A better term might have been creaturum incorporalis. 90 An Elizabethan polymath who wrote books on geometry, navigation, alchemy, rectification of the calendar, and promoted the idea of the British Empire. His interest in angelic invocation lead him to employ a succession of skryers, such as Edward Kelley, who provided Dee with a large amount of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Suddenly, there seemed to come out of my Oratory a Spirituall creature, like a pretty girle of 7 or 9 yeares of age...91 According to Zambelli, “Ficino and his followers admitted the existence of spiritual beings (demons, angels and devils, anthropomorphic movers of astral bodies etc.) to whom it was possible to address prayers, hymns or innocent spells.”92 Other precedents for this usage exist, and at least one manuscript of the Key of Solomon refers in a similar fashion to angels as ‘Créatures célestes.‘93 There was no doubt in the minds of magicians of the period under consideration, that the effects of magic were attributable to external ‘spiritual creatures’ be they gods, angels, daimones, or spirits, rather than to either the innate powers of the magician himself, or to some nebulous undefined pseudo-scientific ‘force’ or ‘vibration.’ It was considered, in the ancient world, that the main skill of a magician was to constrain these entities using the spoken and written word, sigils, talismans, suffumigations and sacrifices. This definition therefore, leads naturally to the subject of this thesis: the examination of the evolution and technology of these words, sigils, talismans, suffumigations and sacrifices that he used. Indeed more recent scholarly definitions of magic have come much closer to defining magic as a technology: [Magic] is a reasoned system of techniques for influencing the gods and other supernatural powers that can be taught and learned... Magic is a praxis, indeed a science, that through established and for the most part empirical means seeks to alter or maintain earthly circumstances, or even call them forth anew.94 The centrality of spiritual creatures to the operation of any magic is confirmed by Johnston: In short, it seems that many Mediterranean magicians considered the control of ghostly or demonic entities to be essential to the completion of their work: the better one was at controlling demons, the greater a magician one was.95 Magic divides the spiritual universe into a specific hierarchy of spiritual creatures in order to deal with it more effectively. Like any science, one of the first steps is analysis, where the constituent parts need to be identified and labelled.96 If magic is looked at in historical terms, as a practice, something people actually did, then magic can be examined and documented in the same way that one could research and document the production of parchment for writing, without condemning the process as        dictated messages and instruction from entities claiming to be angels or spirits. Dee’s records of these ‘spiritual actions’ ran to many hundreds of manuscript pages. 91 This description refers to the angel Madimi as described in BL Cotton Appendix MS XLVI, f. 1.

Nobody who owns a computer would now ever go to the trouble of pulling the skin off a sheep, soaking, stretching, scraping, liming and processing it for several weeks, before writing on it with ink made of soot and oak galls, but nobody can deny that this procedure produced a very durable writing surface that can last more than a thousand years.97 My point is that it is not necessary to take a psychological or even a social anthropological approach to magic. It is sufficient to examine what was done by magicians, and their reasons for those actions, as documented by its practitioners, in their own handbooks. Utilising the practitioners own world view, and their own records, could be construed as taking an entirely emic point of view, but as the subject is treated from the point of view of a technology, with an objective examination of the materials and methods of the practitioners, the vantage point from which these are viewed is an etic one. Definitions of Charm, Amulet, Phylactery, Tefillin, Lamen, Talisman and Pentacle A number of words related to magic have changed meaning over the centuries, and so it is useful to revisit these definitions so that the discussion of category divisions in chapter 3.2 makes internally consistent sense. It is therefore necessary to define more closely the terms Charm, Amulet, Phylactery, Tefillin, Lamen, Talisman and Pentacle, as the popular perception (and even sometimes the academic one),98 is that the above terms are roughly equivalent. These words are often used interchangeably, even by professionals.99 These distinctions are further blurred by some translators who translate, for example, \u0001\u000f\u0010\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\t\u0013 by “charm” or “amulet.” Preisendanz sometimes translates the term “Amulet des Zaubers”100 which at least indicates its use by magicians, rather than just as an everyday charm for a client. Skemer, in his note on terminology, makes some very useful and necessary distinctions: 101 Imprecise terminology has been an impediment to the serious study of textual amulets... Modern scholarship has used different terms to signify textual amulets and has applied them inconsistently.102   97 I am still surprised that I can easily read the contents of a manuscript from the Middle Ages, but can no longer access digital work written by myself on an obsolete computer just thirty years ago. Parchment may well prove more durable in the long run that easily deleted digital documents. 98 Betz (1996), p. 281, for example, categorises PGM XLIV. 1-18 (in the Table of Spells) as a “phylactery for earache.” The fact that it is designed to cure earache, for a specific patient, definitely marks it out as an amulet, not a phylactery. Furthermore the word \u0001\u000f\u0010\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\t\u0013 ‘phylactery’ does not appear anywhere in the Greek text of this passage. 99 A recent exhibit in the newly refurbished Ashmolean Museum in Oxford showed a photograph of a Rabbi who clearly had a tefillin bound to his forehead, captioned by professional museum staff as a “Rabbi with an amulet.” 100 ‘Magician’s amulet.’ Preisendanz (1928), p. 17. 101 Skemer (2006), pp. 6-19. 102 Skemer (2006), pp. 6, 10."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 It is important to make these distinctions before proceeding with the analysis of the different rite types present in the PGM. The definitions used in this thesis are listed below in order of specificity, ranging from the very general and all-embracing word ‘charm’ to the very specific and technical term ‘lamen.’ The purpose of this detailed definition is to be able to pinpoint the function of each in the context of the PGM papyri under consideration, regardless of the sometimes too generalised translation of their descriptors.103 The definitions set out below are formulated on the basis of their use in actual rubrics, and will therefore often expand, or sometimes even contradict, the definition to be found in a typical non-specialist English dictionary.104 The OED is fairly vague about these distinctions, often simply defining one term in terms of another, which is not very helpful. Charm The word ‘charm’ is the most general, and non-specific term, and therefore not a very useful term when considering detailed magical techniques. ‘Charm’ may be used as a verb. As it is derived from the Latin carmen, meaning ‘song’ or ‘invocation’ it can also have a vocal dimension as well as indicating the written form of such a song. It can also be applied to a small item designed to be worn and bring good luck, where ‘amulet’ might be more appropriate. Charm is therefore too general and imprecise a word for the present purposes. Unfortunately some PGM translators have often used this blanket term where a much more specific or technical term, like \u0001\u000f\u0010\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\t\u0013 ‘phylactery,’ or \u0005\u0002\u000b\u0002\u0005\u0010\u000bι\u0005\r\u0013 ‘summoning statue,’ occurs in the Greek. This term will therefore be used as little as possible in the present thesis. Amulet This is also a fairly general term, and simply means a thing worn on the person to attract luck or protect the wearer generally from evil influences, danger or illness.105 Seligman,106 quoted by Budge, was of the opinion that ‘amulet’ was derived from the Old Latin amoletum, meaning “a means of defence.”107 Skemer may be closer to the truth when he states that amulet is derived from the Latin amuletum which he traces back to the Arabic hamalet,   103 As the translations of these papyri have been undertaken by a range of scholars, it is sometimes the case that a specific Greek word will be translated into a number of quite different English words. Categorisation in Appendix 2 has therefore been done on the basis of either the original Greek headword, or the function as embodied in the rubric, rather than the English translation or suggested title. Table 20 lists the Greek rubricated headwords that were utilised for that categorization. 104 For example, phylactery, although a Greek term, is often incorrectly defined narrowly in English dictionaries as a solely Jewish religious item (really a tefillin), whereas in the papyri it is only used to describe an Egyptian magicians’ lamen. 105 A common mediaeval synonym for amulet was ligature, meaning something bound to the body. 106 Heil und Schutzmittel, Stuttgart, 1920, p. 26. 107 Budge (1961), p. 13."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 meaning an object “worn on the body, especially around the neck, as a “preservative” against a host of afflictions.108 An amulet may be made in the form of a gem (especially an engraved gem), a coin, pendant, ring, or plant or animal part (like a rabbit’s foot), or it may be a textual amulet. A typical Mediterranean example, which is still current, is the blue circular eye-shaped amulet designed to protect the wearer from the evil eye. Ancient Egyptian amulets were mass-produced using certain standard formats such as the scarab (perhaps the most popular form), ankh, tet column, djed pillar or the wedjat Eye of Horus.109 The key distinguishing feature of an amulet is that it will either be mass-produced (for later insertion of the client’s name), or made for a very specific client. In the context of the PGM, textual amulets will be made for a specific reason (often the cure of an illness) for a specific person, and will therefore often incorporate the name of the specific person for whom it has been made, and to whom it is to be attached. It will not be used by the magician in a rite. One example of an amulet which has been labelled as a phylactery occurs in an article by Jordan. In his translation the repeated order to protect a specific woman from sundry possible ills confirms, without doubt, that this particular lamella is an amulet for general protection, not a phylactery for use during a magical rite: Protect Alexandra, whom Zoë bore, from every demon and every compulsion of demons and from demonic (forces?) and magical drugs and binding-spells...free Alexandra, whom Zoë bore – quickly, quickly, at once, at once!110 The difference between an amulet and a phylactery thus is highlighted by both its usage and user. The amulet is made for a client, often mass-produced with the client’s name inscribed later, often in a different hand, but the phylactery is made by the magician for the magician. Skemer usefully further narrows the definition of amulet by referring to ‘textual amulets.’ In doing so he defines these as: Textual amulets, as the term is employed in this book, were generally brief apotropaic texts, handwritten or mechanically printed on separate sheets, rolls, and scraps of parchment, paper, or other flexible writing supports of varying dimensions. When worn around the neck or placed elsewhere on the body, they were thought to protect the bearer against known and unknown enemies...111   108 Skemer (2006), p. 6. In this sense an amulet may be referred to in Latin as an alligatura. 109 Examples of Egyptian amulets can be seen in Budge (1970), Andrews (1994), p. 6 and Pinch (2006), pp. 104-119. Examples of Palestinian and Syrian amulets can be found in Naveh and Shaked (1985), pp. 40-122. In each of these 15 examples (except number 6 which is missing at least four lines), the name of the specific person for whom it was made is inscribed on it, thus guaranteeing that it is an amulet. Mediaeval amulets are well covered in Skemer (2006). 110 Jordan (1991), pp. 66-67. 111 Skemer (2006), p. ix."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 Phylactery The phylactery (as the term is used in the PGM) is always for the use of the magician, and only then during a rite, not worn on a day-to-day basis. It will also definitely not incorporate his name.112 A phylactery is also worn, but it must include a written magical or religious text, and be only used by him during a rite.113 This term will only be used in this thesis in the meaning used in the PGM. Taweez In modern India and the Middle East the wearing of a small metal (often gold) cylinder with an enclosed religious text for protection is quite widespread. These also occurred in ancient Egypt.114 Although these items are sometimes referred to as phylacteries, the usual word for these in Urdu and Arabic is taweez or tabeez. The taweez will be worn every day, and it must contain a religious text. It functions like an amulet. Tefillin Phylacteries are defined in most modern dictionaries as mostly associated with Jewish religious practice. Phylactery is however a Greek word. More correctly, the Hebrew word for this very specific item is tefillin (}ilpt). A tefillin is structurally quite different from any other magico-religious pendant, and consists of a small leather case containing slips of parchment or vellum on which are written very specific Hebrew scriptural passages and bound tightly on the forehead and the left arm by orthodox Jewish men during their morning prayer. Tefillin as such do not occur in the PGM, nor in any of the later magical texts, as their use is and was solely for Jewish religious purposes. Lamen or Magician’s Phylactery In the PGM the phylactery is worn solely for protection during a magical rite. The purpose of the magician’s phylactery is to personally protect the magician from the spirit, demon, or (even) the god during the rite. ‘Lamen’ is an even more specific term, and one used exclusively by magicians and never by laymen. In mediaeval and later magical texts, phylacterium was often rendered as lamen. The lamen of the mediaeval magician is a direct descendant of the PGM phylactery.   112 Heintz (1996), pp. 295-300, analyses a mass-produced amulet, which interestingly uses just lines 6-9 cut from a much longer inscription recorded in PGM XIXa. 1-54. Heintz correctly identifies it as a mass-produced amulet (p. 296) but nevertheless still entitles her article “A Greek Silver Phylactery...” 113 Phylactery (φυλακτήριον) is a Greek word and may have been derived from the Greek phylaktikos, which means ‘fit for preserving, or a preservative.’ 114 Illustrated in Pinch (2006), p. 115."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 Talisman Although this word is commonly used interchangeably with ‘amulet’ it will here be used in its more restricted (grimoire) sense, which implies something used in a magical rite for a specific end. For its precise derivation see chapter 3.2. A talisman is not personalised. A talisman is something written or drawn on parchment, papyrus or metal, with a specific magical objective in mind, often planetary. Unlike an amulet or a phylactery it is not designed for personal or general protection, and it is usually not worn. Pentacle This term is almost synonymous with talisman, but carries the additional suggestion that the figure inscribed may be a pentagram, and will relate to a specific planet.115 To summarise the above: A talisman or pentacle is not worn, but is a passive store of a specific magical force, all the others are worn. An amulet may be worn by a client, often for health or general luck, and usually does not have detailed inscriptions. A phylactery, taweez, tefillin and lamen are worn, but must contain written magical or religious inscriptions. A phylactery must have written magical inscription on or included within it, but the text can be pagan, Jewish, Muslim, etc.116 A tefillin must contain a copy of very specific Hebrew religious texts, written in Hebrew or Aramaic, and is worn specifically during morning prayer and only by a Jewish male.117 A lamen or ‘magician’s phylactery’ has inscriptions but is only worn by a magician, during a magical ritual, and at no other time, for protection against the specific spiritual creatures invoked/evoked at that time. These defining characteristics, which are based on their actual usage and on the Greek text of the PGM, rather than just on the limited dictionary definition of the English words, will be used in this thesis to distinguish between the different items of equipment.   115 Pentacle is also the Earth suit in the Tarot pack, and is sometimes used to describe the figure drawn on the ground to enclose a spirit. 116 OED phylactery = “a small leather box containing Hebrew texts on vellum, worn by Jewish men at morning prayer as a reminder to keep the law. Origin: late Middle English: via late Latin from Greek phulaktērion 'amulet,’ from phulassein 'to guard.'” It is a Greek word, not a Hebrew word. 117 Possible origin: from Aramaic tepillīn, 'prayers.'"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 1.5 The Relationship between Magic, the Mysteries and Religion It is useful to enter into a brief discussion of the relationships between magic, the Mysteries and religion for three very specific reasons: i) to further refine the definition of magic, in order to successfully avoid any confusion with religion; ii) to eliminate three large passages in one of the source texts, the PGM, which are in fact Mystery and initiation rites, and not either magic or religion; and iii) to appreciate the distinction between two types of magic: theurgia and goetia. The dichotomy between magic and religion has caused so much scholarly controversy over the last century or so, that it has even been categorized as an unsolvable dilemma by some scholars.118 I propose to make some observations which might lead eventually to such a solution, or at least a very different viewpoint from which to perceive such a solution. This is done in an effort to simplify the present discussion of historical magical transmission, and to avoid it becoming trapped in, or tripped up by, considerations of religion. It is still often argued that religion deals with God or the gods, angels and saints, but only to implore their help, not to constrain it. This view, which is now somewhat superseded, dates back to the work of James Frazer in 1890.119 There is some truth in this contention, but some techniques of magic overlap with the techniques of religion. Techniques such as prayer or consecration span both practices, as shown in grimoires like the Juratus, Liber Sacer, the ‘Holy Book.’120 On the other hand, religion also sometimes uses compulsion, when, for example, it indulges in exorcism. Even techniques such as animal sacrifice, as distasteful to the modern reader as it may be, were originally used by both magicians and priests in the service of their art or religion. One only has to look at the stupendous quantities of animals sacrificed by King Solomon at the inauguration of his temple in Jerusalem in order to appease Yahweh/El, to see that sacrifice is not the exclusive province of the magician or polytheist. Although it was in the interest of the early Christian church to draw deep divides between magic and religion, an objective analysis of the two shows much identity. As Betz neatly puts it when talking about the pre-Christian world: The religious beliefs and practices of most people were identical with some form of magic, and the neat distinctions we make today between approved and disapproved forms of religion – calling the former “religion” and “church” and the latter “magic” and “cult” – did not exist in antiquity...121   118 Betz (1991), pp. 244-247. 119 For Frazer, and many other scholars since, religion was equated with Christianity. 120 See Hedegård (2002), pp. 60-211 for the critical edition of the text. 121 Betz (1996), p. xli."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 My primary observation is that the question of the relationship between magic and religion, has been inappropriately phrased, and that the discussion should not centre around two opposing terms, but around the consideration of three terms. I would like to propose that the reason why this dilemma has remained unsolvable is that in fact the argument should have included three terms and not just two. To solve this one needs to look at the whole spectrum of how man has attempted to relate to the unseen, to the gods and to other spiritual creatures. It is not simply a matter of the differences and similarities between religion and magic. For example Christ’s New Testament miracles have much more in common with magic than they do with religion as currently conceived of by any mainstream Christian church.122 Brashear,123 commenting on Kazhdan,124 writes: The difference between holy and unholy miracles, he suggests, is in the miracle's aim and result: the saint rescues, feeds and comforts, creating good and exemplifying the Christian ideal. Unholy magic causes death, confusion, sexual misbehaviour and the like. Yet, in the final analysis, ambivalence is the order of the day, and the Byzantines seem to have had no real criterion for distinguishing between a holy and an unholy miracle. To a large extent, the problem has been created by the Christian doctrinal view of magic. The early Church Fathers were in no doubt that magic was a real and internally consistent body of knowledge. For example, Origen wrote: ...magic is not, as the followers of Epicurus and Aristotle think, utterly incoherent, but, as the experts in these things prove, is a consistent system, which has principles known to very few.125 But more than that, the basic problem is that the question has been treated as a simple dichotomy of magic versus religion, whereas there is a middle term missing from this equation. The missing ‘middle term’ is the Mystery religions, which are part of a continuum of: religion – the Mysteries – magic. However, the problem is still a difficult one because the Mystery religions are missing from our 21st century experience, and do not exist any more in any form in any Western culture. The nature of these three practices can be summed up briefly: a) Religion is practised in public in temples in front of all adherents by priests. b) The Mysteries (or holy teletai),126 were celebrated in private by the teletai-   122 See Conner (2006) and Conner (2010). 123 Brashear (1998), p. 253. 124 Kazhdan (1995), pp. 73-82. 125 Origen, Contra Celsus in Chadwick (1965), pp. 23-24. 126 Teletai, which is often translated as ‘initiation,’ derives from the Greek root tele- which means ‘completion’ or ‘perfection.’ ‘Initiation’ is a word which has been somewhat devalued in the last century. To the ancient Greeks it meant approaching the perfection of a god, or at the very least a purification which enabled a mortal to meet with and converse with a god, in some form of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 priests only for the benefit of one or a very small number of initiates. It is very clearly different from religion which was practised openly in temples.127 c) Magic is celebrated in private and/or secretly.128 It was often practised by the priests of a religion, but also by lay persons with the right training. In the ancient world these were the three main ways that man sought to approach the unseen. The differences between these three can be defined by a number of criteria: 1. Audience. The first category, religion, deals with the gods on behalf of the congregation. The second, the Mysteries, takes a select few of the congregation and exposes them to experiences which (by all accounts) change their view of the world and their life for ever after. The significance of this change can be measured by the very small number of initiates who have ever broken their vows and written down an account of their experiences. The third category will often be performed for just one client, or just for the benefit of the magician himself. 2. Degree of Secrecy. Religion embraces all-comers and in many cases seeks to convert the non-believer or adherent of a rival religion. The Mysteries selected or accepted only a few individuals from the congregation who looked for (or paid for) a deeper spiritual experience. Magic was even more secretive, and in most cases, actively discouraged new postulants or practitioners.129 Clients were only included in the practice on a need-to-know or disciple basis. 3. Degree of Specificity in Objectives. Religion dealt with the general good, and assisted in various rites of passage such as birth, death and marriage, but the objectives will be general in nature such as blessing (baptism for birth, blessing for marriage, last rites for death). The Mysteries focused on the initiation or introduction to the gods to a few candidates, at a personal experiential level, and usually dealt just with one god, such as Dionysus or Demeter, with the single objective of initiation or immortalisation. The prime objective of the Immortality offered by the Mysteries should not be confused with “a place in heaven” offered by religion. Magic operates with a very specific end or single objective, but drawn from a very wide field of concrete possibilities: love, lust, money, power, etc.        fellowship, which was indeed the objective of the Mysteries. PGM IV contains several such Mystery rituals, for example lines 26-51 or 475-820. 127 In the Dervani papyrus the practitioners were referred to as mystai. 128 In the Dervani papyrus these practitioners were referred to as magoi. See Edmonds (2008), p.17. 129 The degree of privacy was also used as a distinguishing factor between magic and religion by Emile Durkheim. Michael Bailey (2006), p. 3, pointed out that Marcel Mauss (Durkheim’s nephew and pupil) defined magic as “private, secret, mysterious, and above all prohibited, while religion consisted of rites publicly acknowledged and approved.”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 4. Range of Entities. Religion deals with the gods and the angels. The Mysteries dealt with one specific god or goddess. Magic deals with the whole range of spiritual creatures: gods, angels, demons, elementals, spirits and even the dead. Yet a third possible way of looking at these three categories is in terms of subject and object. i) Religion: the Priest presents the god(s) to the people. ii) Mysteries: the teletai priest presents a specific candidate to a specific god. iii) Magic: the magician presents himself to, and adjures, the god or other spiritual creature. To understand the soil from which European magic sprung, we have to look back to the ancient world, within the same region, for a time when all three modes of communication with the spiritual existed side by side, and at a time when magic was considered a worthy and workable method. It is my belief that it is precisely because of the Judeo-Christian bias, and because of the missing experience of the Mystery religions, that the discussion of the relationship between magic and religion has not, in modern times, ever reached a satisfactory conclusion. By cutting out the middle term, the Mysteries, Christianity forever polarised magic and religion, instead of seeing it as part of a natural continuum in man’s efforts to relate to the gods, the angels and other spiritual creatures. It is now popular to embrace the idea that religion and magic cannot be separated, as MacMullen puts it: Now, the lessons of anthropology grown familiar, it is common to accept the impossibility of separating magic from religion and move on to more interesting subjects.130 Reliance upon the conclusions of anthropologists draws the argument back into the anthropological analysis of primitive peoples, which is a world away from the discourse and understanding of pagan and Christian intellectuals living under the Roman or Byzantine Empires. Much of the main thrust of MacMullen’s book is concerned with the identity or similarity of pagan religious and Christian religious practices, which may well be true, but has little direct relation to magic.131 The fact that religion sometimes used magic, or that priests were often magicians, does not invalidate the basic distinctions in practice.   130 MacMullen (1997), pp. 143-144. 131 MacMullen (1997), p. 143."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 The Application of the Categorisation of Magic, Mysteries and Religion One simple example, taken from the Papyri Graeco Magicae,132 which is a key part of the present study, helps to illustrate the usefulness of this three-fold categorization. One section of the papyrus was designated by its early German translator, Albrecht Dieterich, as Eine Mithrasliturgie.133 Dieterich, working in the Frazerian atmosphere of 1903, wanted to see this ritual as a part of religion, allowing him to characterise it as worthy, so seizing upon one of the few god names present, he called it the Mithras Liturgy.134 Despite Dieterich’s undoubted fame as a scholar, the text was neither Mithraic nor was it a liturgy.135 Cumont was quick to point this out,136 but Dieterich was not to be moved, and the argument went on for the next quarter century. An appreciation that the text could have been either religion, magic or a Mystery rite, might have reduced this confrontation. Even a cursory reading will confirm that ‘Mithra’ appears once, but only as part of a clear reference to a previous event, rather than as the addressee of the current rite.137 In addition, none of the known theological or symbolic themes of Mithraic ‘ascent of the soul via the seven planetary spheres’ appear. Therefore, it is clearly not a Mithraic religious text. But Dieterich refused to be convinced, thinking that its complex and elegant structure must be part of some formal religion, not a piece of Volkskunde. German scholars of that period, like Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, felt that classical scholars should only translate poetry, literature and religious rites, and not sully their hands with what he called botokudenphilologie. Hence Dieterich’s desire to see this text as a mainstream religious text. In fact this particular passage, despite appearing in the PGM collection, is not in the strict sense magic either. Applying the definition of the three parts of the continuum proposed above in terms of audience, degree of secrecy, specificity of objectives, and range of entities address, we can clearly see: 1. Audience. The ‘Mithras Liturgy’ is not a religious rite as it is not one designed to be performed in public. 2. Secrecy. The degree of secrecy is clear. The ritual is either a solitary one, or one “for an only child,” and therefore it is not a religious ritual.   132 PGM IV, 475-829. 133 Dieterich (1966). 134 A title which does not appear in the text itself. 135 Liturgy refers to religious services, where the worshippers’ responses are complementary to the priest’s work. 136 Cumont (1904), pp. 1-10. 137 PGM VI, 482."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 3. Objectives. The objective specified in the first line clearly marks it out as a Mystery rite, it being for the benefit of the writer’s daughter, that she may become immortal (the most common objective of the Mysteries) and/or for the benefit of the writer. I write these mysteries handed down... for an only child I request immortality, O initiates of this our power... so that I alone may ascend into heaven as an enquirer and behold the universe.138 As Betz writes, “immortality is of course the primary benefit derived from the Mysteries (\u0004\u000f\u0014\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\u0002).”139 The objectives are not love, wealth, power, sex, and so it is not a magic ritual, even though it is embedded amongst other magic rituals in the same papyrus. The objective is the immortalization of the initiate rather than the worship of a divinity (religion) or the constraining of other spiritual creatures (magic). 4. Range of Entities. The number of spiritual entities invoked is very limited, but it mentions Helios, Aiōn and Mithras (as a backward looking reference) and some other lesser daimones, but does not constrain them or threaten them, as would be typical of a magical text. The conclusion is that it is a Mystery ritual imbedded in a magical papyrus, but not itself either magic, or religion. The point of this excursus is simply to show an example usage of the criterion set out above to practically distinguish between religion, the Mysteries and magic, in one of the three main source texts utilised by this thesis. This illustrates the need for such a definition in analysing these texts.   138 PGM IV, 475-485. 139 Betz (2005), p. 94."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 2. Theatre of Operation: the Historical Background Transmission of ideas and texts follows the broad outlines of cultural diffusion, but this only happens gradually over time.140 However the beginnings of such diffusion, or their termination, often follow sudden political changes like the conquest of armies, which might cause a mass migration, or the censoring of one way of thinking. Magic was particularly susceptible to changes in the dominant religion, which in Egypt for example, changed from a tolerant polytheistic pagan environment to a far more restrictive Christian monotheistic environment, followed much later by an even more monotheistic Islamic environment. Therefore it is worthwhile flagging some of the major political changes in the eastern Mediterranean over the course of the period being analysed, as they throw some light on the patterns of the diffusion of magic. I am aware of the risks of examining history as discreet chunks of internally homogenous culture defined by specific dates. The scope of this thesis does not allow me to examine the difficulties of too rigid a periodisation, but certain historical markers need to be laid down to enable the transmission to be outlined. In the case of the Eastern Mediterranean, turning points such as the sack of Constantinople in 1453, and rapid and radical changes in the religious backdrop from pagan to Christian to Muslim are key events with far reaching effects, and so need to be noted. Such changes in religion are much more likely to have affected the practice of magic than, for example, the practice of agriculture. Key to these cultural transitions has been the activity of translators, whose access to manuscripts has also been radically affected by these cultural shifts. Ancient Egypt Ancient Egyptian magic had existed over several millennia prior to the Christian era. Greek colonists and settlers moved to Egypt in search of work or a better place to live from the 7th century BCE onwards. From the time of Pythagoras and Herodotus, Egypt was seen as a land of mystery, and of commercial opportunity. The melting pot where ancient Egyptian and Greek magic blended was the city of Alexandria, in Egypt, and it is the history of that city which is central to the history of Graeco-Egyptian magic. The main subsequent changes in the political, cultural and religious environment are mapped out below. The dates are merely a guideline, as the process of cultural transmission is of course more gradual. Where appropriate there will be a backward glance at the magical practices of ancient Egypt, but these connections are not central to the main thrust of this thesis.   140 See Pingree (1987)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Alexandria under the Greeks 332 - 30 BCE Graeco-Egyptian magic was a direct result of the mixing of Egyptian and Greek cultures. This began in earnest with the invasion of Egypt by Alexander in 332 BCE, although it was practised before this in Egypt, particularly in the Hellenic city of Alexandria, and in the eastern Mediterranean. Betz defines the date range of the relevant extant papyri as from 2nd century BCE to 5th century CE.141 It is probable that the materials incorporated in these papyri date back a further century to 332 BCE (the point where Greek and Egyptian magic may first have begun to interact seriously). Alexandria under the Romans 30 BCE – 395 CE Although the Romans conquered Egypt in 30 BCE, they seemed content not to interfere with local religious and magical customs, hence their culture added very little to the prevailing system of magic. Although Alexandria had a Jewish community from early times,142 the Romans’ crushing of the Jewish revolt in Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, created a surge in the migration of many Palestinian Jews to Alexandria, which for a while became a world centre for Jewry. In fact the Jews in Alexandria in the 1st century CE are said to have made up 40% of the total population.143 Around this time Jewish magical formulae, holy names, and figures like Solomon and Moses most strongly entered the practice of Graeco-Egyptian magic.144 The few papyri that can be definitely dated as prior to that date (70 CE) have very few occurrences of demonstrably Jewish formulae.145 The next most significant change in the region was the replacement of paganism with Christianity. The main events which saw the overthrow of paganism happened in just the space of 30 years. These events included the death of the Roman Emperor Julian, called the Apostate in 363 CE, an event which effectively finally withdrew official backing for the pagan world in the Roman Empire. In Egypt it was also the decrees of the Coptic patriarch Theophilus which resulted in the looting and burning of the Alexandrian Serapeum in 391 CE (which contained the last remaining scrolls and papyri saved from the great Library of Alexandria). This saw Christianity rise to become the dominant religion in the region.   141 Betz (1996), p. xli. 142 When Alexander founded the city he looked favourably on Jewish colonists: “Having found among them brave and loyal allies he granted that they might settle in a quarter of the new city with legal rights equal to those of the Greeks.” - Josephus, Wars of the Jews, II, 18, 7. 143 Philo Judaeus in Flaccum, 6, 8. Even allowing for exaggeration, it was probably only rigid Jewish monotheism that prevented them contributing more to the development of Solomonic magic. 144 Moses and Solomon are simply used here as the names of famous magicians, whose names can be called upon in any adjuration, and do not specifically indicate a Jewish provenance for the invocation. 145 On dating see Brashear (1995), pp. 3491-3493."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 Christianity then began a steady persecution of pagans and magicians (often one and the same) resulting in the destruction of a vast corpus of magical manuscripts.146 On 8 November 392 CE, the ancient gods were reclassified as “evil spirits.”147 Alexandria under the Byzantines 395-636 Rome lost Egypt back to the Greeks four years after the destruction of the Serapeum, but this time to Christian Greeks, not pagan ones. The grisly murder of Hypatia, the last head of the Platonic Academy in Alexandria, at the hands of the Christians in 415 CE, sealed the fate of paganism in Alexandria. Finally, the loss of Egypt to Islam in 636 CE resulted in the migration (which had begun some years earlier) of Greeks (with their culture, magical practices and manuscripts) northwards to Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire which had been designated as the capital three centuries before. The Byzantine Empire 324-1453 The Byzantine Empire spans over a millennium from the declaration of Constantinople as the ‘New Rome’ in 324 CE, through the loss of Egypt in 636 CE to the sack of Constantinople in 1453. The cultural focus is however still Greek, but now it has moved from pagan Greek to Christian Greek, in line with its geographical move northwards from Alexandria to Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Orthodox empire. Finally in 636 CE the Orthodox empire lost control of Egypt to the Muslim invaders, cutting off this magical tradition from its roots. Magical practices, which by now had a small Jewish, and a much smaller Christian admixture, began to be referred to as Solomonic magic, or in Greek the Solomōnikē. The final loss of Constantinople (and the rest of the Byzantine Empire) to Islam in 1453 CE,148 resulted in a transfer of much Greek culture and magic to its closest Christian neighbour, Italy, where the Byzantine Greeks already had a territorial presence. The Latin World from 1453 – 1641 In Italy the Solomōnikē were soon translated into Latin to become the Clavicula Salomonis, and Latin Solomonic grimoires. Once having become available in the Latin world these grimoires rapidly migrated from Italy to France and thence to England. Although 1641 is an arbitrary date, because Latin continued to be used, in England anti-Popish sentiment around this time contributed to the more frequent use of English and the beginning of the long decline of Latin.   146 The bulk of the surviving Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are reputed to have come from just one tomb in Thebes. These were bought by Giovanni Anastasi who subsequently sold them to European museums and libraries. See Dieleman (2005), pp. 12-16. 147 Codex Theodosii, 16.10.12. Godefroy et al (2012). 148 The Fall of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, occurred as a result of a siege laid by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II.

Other grimoires, like the Lemegeton, were translated into English in 1641 and subsequently. Between 1641 and 1663 a significant number of magical texts were printed in English rather than Latin. Part of the reason for this might have been the abolition of the Star Chamber in July 1641, which amounted to an almost de facto abolition of censorship, replacing it by a system of registration of publications. Books on magic published in this time frame included the English editions of highly influential magical works such as Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy, Scot’s Discovery of Witchcraft, Weir’s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, de Abano’s Heptameron, and Ars Notoria just to name of few. Puritanism and an interest in practical magic would, on the face of it, seem like strange bedfellows, but perhaps the freedom to seek direct communication with god (without the intervention of priests) also meant an increased interest in communicating directly with other spiritual creatures. Although the time frame and the geographic scope (Egypt through the Levant, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and then to the rest of Western Europe and to England) are both very wide, the specific techniques examined here are clearly definable and traceable. One might instinctively assume that if magic were a ‘made up’ subject, then each successive generation would invent something completely new, fanciful and different, whereas the reverse is actually true. Betz concludes that “no magician who is worth his reputation would ever claim to have invented or made up his own spells.”150 Although the techniques were polished and adapted by each successive culture that they passed through, it is extraordinary to note that these procedures changed very little in essence or even in detail. The nomina magica gathered Christian additions as they moved out of the purely pagan milieu of Egypt into the Christian world of Byzantine Greece, and then the Latin world of Western Europe, but the method of invocation, and the form of the circles, incenses and equipment changed very little, apart from the obvious effects of scribal deterioration. Even the subjects covered by typical chapter headings included in magicians’ handbooks remained the same over many centuries of transmission, despite changes in language and culture.   149 For the first time in 1572.

The Ancient Egyptian Demotic Magical Papyri Hieroglyphic and Hieratic Texts Although discussion of purely Egyptian texts is not part of this thesis, it is necessary to consider them briefly to ‘set the scene,’ in order to see what Egyptian influences passed into the Graeco-Egyptian papyri. The oldest hieroglyphic Egyptian texts are the so-called ‘Pyramid Texts’ (2500-2200 BCE), which are found on the walls of pyramids such as those of the Pharaohs Pepi and Unas. These are almost solely concerned with the happiness and safety of the dead in the next world, and not at all with the usual magical objectives of this world. So although they are ‘magical,’ the limitation of their aims to the resurrection and the reunification of the dead with their ba makes them less relevant for this study. These are primarily for the use of the dead rather than for any living person or magician. The ‘Coffin Texts’ (2250-1784 BCE) are the lineal successor to the Pyramid Texts, being inscribed on the inside of the coffin rather than the wall of the sarcophagus chamber.151 These are found in the coffins of less exalted but still powerful members of Egyptian society, and perform the same tasks, but more economically. The lineal successor to both of these groups of texts is the many copies of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.152 This book contains about 200 passages, sixty percent of which are drawn from the above two classes of text. As such these rites still have the limited objectives of releasing the dead, guiding him through the Judgement Hall of Double Order, and reuniting him with his ba so that he can take his place amongst the gods. Amongst the additional rites in the Book of the Dead however are procedures for animating the shabti, the small statuettes of servants found in many tombs and designed to serve their masters (or mistresses) in the afterlife. These are of relevance to the present study, as they bear upon later magical practices of statue ensoulment, and stoicheia (\u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002). Although the majority of purely Egyptian texts that have come down to us from the above collections are designed to help the dead, there are formats that would also have been used in magicians’ rites designed to assist the living. One example of these techniques is the identification of the priest or magician with a specific god, for example, the repeated   151 Faulkner (1973-1978). 152 Budge (1967)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 identification of the magician with Osiris. In a Babylonian context, the identification was usually either with Eridu or with his son: I am the magician born of Eridu, begotten in Eridu and Šubari.153 One of the few exceptions to the preoccupation with the needs of the dead is exemplified by the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus154 which was found, not surprisingly, in the tomb of a magician and which includes rites relevant to all the usual magical objectives. It is this sole text plus a handful of passages in the Book of the Dead which concern us.155 Presumably many other magicians’ books either perished with their owners or may have been blended into the Graeco-Egyptian texts. That part of the PGM magic which is undoubtedly Egyptian in origin is the part concerned with threats made to the gods. The Egyptians, in common with the Jews, also used and valued the knowledge of the ‘true name of the god’ or spirit: ...threats to the gods and knowledge of the true name are commonly agreed to be original Egyptian contributions to magic.156 Both these techniques, threats to the gods/spirits and the utilisation of the knowledge of their true name, lasted from dynastic Egypt right through Byzantine Solomonic texts to 20th century Latin and English grimoires. A third technique, which had it roots in early Egyptian magic, was the threat made by the magician to interrupt natural processes such as the rising of the sun each day, or other cosmological processes such as the ceremonies which supposedly revivified the Egyptian gods each day. Other Egyptian magical techniques included: Execrations, whose goal was total destruction of the enemy, identified by name, whether alive or dead, human or divine, as well as damnationes memoriae conducted on inscriptions, individual hieroglyphs and statues deposited in cemeteries are all commonly attested.157 Heka In strictly Egyptian texts, magic is often personified as the god Heka, whose image is two extended forearms pointing skywards.158 This god does not appear at all in the Graeco-Egyptian papyri, but the Greek goddess Hekate frequently does.159 It is strange that the most   153 Thompson (1908), p. xxiii. 154 British Museum papyrus 10057. 155 Relevant chapters in the Book of the Dead include 17, 20, 122, 77, 119, 167 and Supp. 99. 156 Brashear (1995), p. 3391. 157 Brashear (1995), p. 3392. 158 Ritner (2008), pp. 14-28. 159 It is conceivable that there is some link between Hekate and Heka, but to date one has not been found, apart from a superficial lexical similarity."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 prominent Egyptian god of magic is not found in the PGM whilst lesser gods are.160 Most spells of the pharaonic period were apotropaic, that is designed to ward off evil influences. The uniquely Greek contribution to magic was the generation of spells designed to achieve more personal ends, such as the acquisition of a lover, or the binding of an enemy, rather than the warding-off of snakes or ensuring that the bark of Ra passes safely through the Duat or Underworld. Demotic Texts Demotic is a form of script Egyptians adapted for writing on papyrus with a cut reed pen, rather than chiselling onto the walls of a tomb. Demotic texts concentrate upon the pantheon of ancient Egypt, especially the myths surrounding Osiris. It is interesting that even though quills would have become the norm in Byzantium after the 7th century, five exemplars of chapter 20 of the Hygromanteia still preserve the techniques for cutting and consecrating a reed pen, showing the antiquity of this line of transmission of that formula.161 However, the reed pen did not survive the next cultural transmission from Byzantium to the Latin grimoires of Western Europe.162 The time span of Demotic texts has been calculated to be about 1100 years (from 643 BCE to 452 CE).163 The magic that is found in these texts is more adapted to everyday needs and desires (love spells, money, destruction of scorpions, etc) rather than the more cosmic objectives such as ensuring the rising of the sun. As such they form a bridge between the hieroglyphic/hieratic texts and the Graeco-Egyptian papyri, and they are written on the same medium as the latter.164 In fact the Demotic papyri are much closer in content to the PGM than to their ancestor texts from dynastic Egypt. The best known of the PDM (Demotic Papyrus) is the London-Leyden papyrus.165 To quote just one example of continuity from ancient Egypt to the PDM papyri, the Ouphōr invocation,166 designed to make carved statues come alive, is clearly an adapted version of the ancient ‘Opening of the Mouth’ procedure which was an essential part of any burial.167   160 One possibility that I have not checked is the possibility that many occurrences of this god’s name have simply been translated by the common noun ‘magic.’ 161 e.g. H, f. 25; A, f. 14v; P, f. 218v, etc. 162 As the use of the reed pen petered out in Byzantium around the 7th century, this is circumstantial evidence for a date of composition of the Hygromanteia around, or before, that time. It is also an example of the very conservative nature of magical handbooks. 163 Brashear (1995), p. 3396. 164 Translations of the extant PDM are included with the PGM in Betz (1996). 165 PDM xii and PDM xiv. 166 PGM XII. 270-350, especially 316-350. 167 Dieleman (2005), p.290. The procedure of ‘washing the mouth’ of the god to vivify it also occurs in other oriental religions."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 Here it is adapted to a more personal magical objective: ...that you may give divine and supreme strength to this image and may make it effective and powerful against all [opponents] and to be able to call back souls, move spirits, subject legal opponents [to your will], strengthen friendships, produce all [sorts of] profits, bring dreams, give prophecies, cause psychological passions and bodily sufferings and incapacitating illness, and perfect erotic philtres.168 This is truly a wide ranging list of magical effectiveness. The crux is the phrase: Here is truly written out, with all brevity, [the rite] by which all modelled images and engravings and carved stones are made alive. The Mesopotamian origins of this practice are confirmed by Reiner: The most elaborate ritual performed at night with appeal to the stars is the \"washing of the mouth\" (mīs pî). It deals with the all-important ceremony of breathing life into the statues of the gods, a process called empsychosis169 in Greek. In Babylonia, the ceremony is called the \"opening of the mouth\" (pīt pî), which is preceded by the \"washing of the mouth\" (mīs pî) of the divine statue. Divine statues, we know, were made of wood, and overlaid with precious materials, usually gold; incrustations of precious stones adorned them.170 Their fabrication was, therefore, placed under the tutelage of the patron gods of carpenters, goldsmiths, and jewellers. Only after the inert materials were infused with breath through the mouth-opening ceremony could the statue eat and drink the offerings, and smell the incense.171 The typical Demotic rites are much longer and more detailed than the earlier hieroglyphic/ hieratic rites, and resemble in structure, objectives, and method the PGM rites. They are therefore likely to have been written by magicians who were more comfortable in the Egyptian language rather than Greek, but who were working with the same materials, methods and assumptions as their fellow Greek magicians. Rites were preserved in Demotic rather than Greek to specifically preserve the correct pronunciations of the invocations. Another feature of the PDM is that they have a preponderance of Egyptian deities, whilst the PGM have fewer Egyptian deities but many more Greek and sundry lesser known entities. While this seems perfectly logical, it shows that as magical techniques passed from one culture to the next, practitioners added new names of gods and new nomina magica. Most of the extant PDM rites date from the time of the Roman occupation of Egypt, especially the early 3rd century CE. Hieratic appears occasionally in these Demotic texts, but never hieroglyphic, which was not adapted to writing on papyrus. Harpocrates, Bes and Khnum are the minor but important Egyptian gods of magic who will later be found in the PGM, alongside the major Egyptian gods which were limited to: Anubis, Isis, Osiris, Thoth, Horus, Hathor, Apophis, Ra, Phre, Ptah, Amoun, Khepera, Nephthys, Set, Sekhmet, Apis and Geb.   168 PGM XII. 301-306. 169 This word is not italicised in the original text, which is why it is not italicised here. 170 Oppenheim (1949), pp. 172-93. 171 Reiner (1995), pp. 139-140."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 3.2. The Graeco-Egyptian Magical Papyri Translations of these papyri were first made available in German by Preisendanz in 1928/1931. His work on the Greek texts has been supplemented by Betz, who collected and edited English translations, adding in more recently translated Graeco-Egyptian papyri, increasing their number from 80 to 120 papyri. Betz also included translations for the Demotic and Coptic contents of these papyri, which were originally completely ignored by Preisendanz. Betz followed and expanded Preisendanz’s numbering system beyond PGM LXXXI, which was the last numbered papyrus in Preisendanz’s collection. The oldest Graeco-Egyptian text (PGM XL, the “curse of Artemisia”) dates from shortly after Alexander the Great’s death,172 and the most recent from the 5th century CE. The second oldest papyrus (PGM XX) was written by, or was in the collection of, two magicians Philinna of Thessaly,173 and an unnamed magician from Syria, despite the fact that it was found in Egypt. This suggests that this style of magic was already well spread over an area which included at the least Thessaly, Syria, Palestine and Egypt.174 It is therefore probably representative of magic in the eastern Mediterranean and near Middle East in that period. There are just four Demotic papyri included in the collection (the PDM), all found by Anastasi175 around Thebes, all dating from the early 3rd century CE, and all written by the same scribe, so they form a consistent whole. This shows that the methods outlined were used by Egyptian and Greek speakers alike. As well as Demotic (and some hieratic) Egyptian, there are passages in Greek and, fortunately, glosses in Coptic which clearly indicate the correct pronunciation for the words so glossed. Although Egyptian hieroglyphs had some phonetic indications, it was not an alphabetic language, so most indications of pronunciation would have been lost without the Coptic glosses, especially of nomina magica and the names of gods, where correct pronunciation was crucial for the magician. These ancient Coptic glosses show the importance placed upon the correct pronunciation of the Egyptian words of power, nomina magica, and god names. We will see later that pronunciation, rather than exact palaeographic form, is the best tool for tracking the migration of these names over a range of successor cultures.   172 Brashear (1995), p. 3413. 173 Thessaly has always traditionally been the home of ‘witches’ as far as the Greeks were concerned. See Luck (1987), p. 31. 174 Of course this is only an indication of the origins of the practitioners, rather than a certain mapping of the actual areas of practice. This is suggestive nonetheless. 175 Jean d’Anastasi (1780 - 1857) purportedly obtained it from a tomb in Luxor in 1827. Anastasi was an Armenian who worked as a Swedish/Norwegian diplomat at the court of the Khedive of Egypt, based in Alexandria."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 The first of the Demotic papyri to be translated into English was published as the Demotic Papyrus of London and Leiden.176 The magical methods outlined in the four Demotic papyri were overwhelmingly Egyptian, suggesting that they had survived in this form for at least seven centuries without significant Hellenic reworking. Methods included the typically Egyptian compulsive formulae, where the magician threatens the god that he will disrupt the smooth working of the universe if the god does not carry out his commands, formulae that are also found in the earliest Egyptian Pyramid Texts. The threat to disturb the smooth workings of the universe is not typical of Greek magic, just as formulae to ensure the smooth working of the universe are not characteristic of Greek religion. The gods were usually Egyptian, or Egyptian disguised under the name of their Greek counterparts. Often, as in the case of PGM XII, both Greek and Demotic rites would occupy the same papyrus, written in the same hand. Finally the publication of the Supplementum Magicum and a number of small recently discovered papyri make up the entire available corpus of Graeco-Egyptian papyri. There are very few discovered papyri that remain outside of this corpus, untranslated in any European language. Therefore a textual analysis of the above resources on a line-by-line basis (see Appendix 2) adequately covers the whole scope of the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri. Analysis of the PGM by Sources The material in the PGM comes from a range of sources and languages.177 The contents are a mixture of Egyptian, Greek, Coptic, Gnostic, Jewish, and Christian magic.178 It is important to establish the range of contributing strands, so that onwards transmission can be attributed to the correct source. These strands can be most easily recognized by the type of spiritual creatures or gods called upon by each: a. Egyptian magic, which calls upon traditional indigenous Egyptian gods such as Harpocrates, Horus, Anubis, Thoth, Isis, Osiris, Set and Bes, preserves elements of   176 The title refers to the present geographical location of its two halves. See Griffith and Thompson (1904). Betz’s numbering is PDM xii (and PGM XII). The same scribe also wrote PDM xiv, lxi, and PDM Supp. An exorcism drawn from the original publication of this papyrus, variously entitled ‘The Bornless One’ or the ‘Headless One’ was adapted in the late 19th century for use in the ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. 177 Some Babylonian input may have come via Jewish practices adopted in Babylon during the captivity (597-538 BCE). Brashear (1995), p. 3429 also tentatively suggests the possibility of some Buddhist influence, but this seems very unlikely, and is not supported by examples of imported practices. 178 Christian magic is very much in the minority. Interestingly, there are no obvious traces of Roman magic, despite the fact that Egypt was under Roman domination from 30 BCE – 395 CE, during which time most of the papyri were written."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 Egyptian magic. Magical names like Bainchōōōch are also of Egyptian derivation.179 b. Greek classical magic which calls upon a very specific subset of the Classical Greek gods including Selene, Cybele, Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, Helios, Artemis, and specially Aphrodite (for love rites), and then upon the gods of the Underworld, like chthonic Hermes, Hekate, and Persephone. Thirdly, the gods which personify abstract qualities, such as Aiōn (the All), the Moirai (Fate), Kronos (Time), Physis (Nature) and Tyche (Providence/Chance). None of these gods are portrayed or used in the Classical manner, but rather delegated to the same level of functionality as their daimones.180 For some reason Dionysos, Hephaistos, Hera and other prominent occupants of Olympus never appear, presumably because they were not as intimately connected with magic. The gods in the papyri were treated in much the same was as they were in later Greek folk religion, as useful, but almost daimonic, tricksy and dangerous. As Betz puts it: In the older material, the Greek gods are alive and well. But Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, and others are portrayed not as Hellenic and aristocratic, as in literature, but as capricious, demonic, and even dangerous.181 Egyptian religion in turn influenced the imported Greek religion, so that the importance of the Egyptian Underworld (the Duat), helped to emphasise the Greek divinities of the underworld like Hekate,182 Persephone and Kore,183 and otherwise gods like Hermes and Aphrodite became associated with the Underworld in their magical and chthonic forms. c. Jewish magic, which calls upon the archangels: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel/Ouriel plus recognizable Hebrew god names like inda Adonai (and its Greek variants like Adonias),184 hvhi IHVH or Yahweh (frequently appearing in the guise of hi Yah or the   179 Possibly derived from the Egyptian ba = one of the parts of the soul; and cho(oo)ch = darkness, or ‘soul of darkness.’ See Pistis Sophia, IV, 137. 180 Betz (1996), p. xlii, quotes Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff’s well known disparaging comment: “I once heard a well-known scholar complain that [it was unfortunate that] these papyri were found, because they deprived antiquity of the noble splendor of classicism.” Splendour or not, this is how the Greek and Egyptian gods were treated by magicians in the first three or four centuries of the Christian era. Occasionally the gods were asked to send their daimones to perform a specific task, but more often they were commanded to do it themselves. The gods were effectively treated as daimones, and feared, as the magicians wore phylacteries for the express purpose of protecting themselves from the malice of these same gods. 181 Betz (1996), p. xlv. 182 Hekate becomes important and is associated with one of the few Babylonian goddesses in the PGM, Ereshkigal. 183 Kore later becomes a demon in the works of the German Jewish grimoire, The Sacred Book of Abramelin, the Mage. See Mathers (1900), Book II, pp. 81, 83. 184 In fact the Hebrew inda simply means ‘Lord’ and is often used in Hebrew texts to replace the actual names of god. Despite Judaism being nominally a monotheistic religion, a number of names of god appear in Jewish scripture, which may be traces of separate gods that were later merged. The two classical Hebrew groups of god names were the Elohistic (la El, Elohim) and the Yahwistic (hi, hvhi IHVH, Yah, Yahweh)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 Greek version ι\u0002\u0017/\u0018\u0019\u001a, or the Samaritan version Ipos/Ibas),185 Elohim (often misspelled), and Sabaoth.186 Of course, since the translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek in the form of the Septuagint, in Alexandria, dating from the 3rd century BCE, some Jewish material, including magic, entered directly and more easily into the predominantly Greek culture of the eastern Mediterranean, but the main period of importation was immediately after 70 CE. Jewish magic brought with it some Babylonian elements (such as the angels), and an elaborately stratified cosmology of the heavens. d. Gnostic elements, and other words derived from creative combinations (or scribal degeneration) of the other traditions listed above.187 For the purposes of this thesis, Gnostic material will be treated as a phenomenon separate from Christianity, as even those Gnostic movements which may have started out as an offshoot of Christianity, were later rejected and discarded by the religion which is now accepted as Christianity. Although scholars have argued over the origins of Gnosticism, it seems clear from the work of Quispel, Stroumsa, Segal and Fossum that the main elements of Gnosticism were derived from Jewish heresies rather than Christian heresies.188 Furthermore, the Jewish heresies identified by the above scholars sprang up immediately after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, with the tide of dispirited Jewish immigrants who arrived in Egypt (and to a lesser extent Asia Minor) just after 70 CE.189 This disillusioned Jewish Diaspora were the seedbed of Gnosticism therefore giving us an approximate terminus a quo of 70 CE for the introduction of Gnostic names and gods into Egypt, and then into the PGM. It was probably this major Jewish Diaspora that cross-fertilised Egyptian and Jewish magic. Very soon after, in 74 CE, the Romans destroyed the second most important Jewish temple which was Onias’ temple located in Leontopolis near Heliopolis, Egypt which must have completed the Jews’ sense of total abandonment by their god.190 Finally after bar-Khokba’s revolt failed in 135 CE, Jews were totally banned from Jerusalem by the Romans. This must have stimulated a second wave of Jewish migration to   185 The transformation from hvhi or IHVH to IAO is easier to understand if you take into account that v can be transliterated as V or O, depending on its use as a consonant or a vowel, just as I can equally be transliterated as I or Y. IHVH then becomes YHOH, which might then be speculatively pronounced as YaH-OH or ι\u0002\t. 186 Sabaoth retained its use to constrain spirits right up to the later European grimoires. 187 Of course it could well be that these names, instead of being later corruptions, are in fact earlier strata of genuine Egyptian magical practice. As Barb (1964, p. 4, note 16) suggested: “much that we are accustomed to see classified as late ‘syncretism’ is rather the ancient and original, deep-seated popular religion, coming to the surface when the whitewash of ‘classical’ writers and artists began to peel off...” 188 Mastrocinque (2005), p. 82. 189 The idea of an evil creator god obviously found fertile ground in the disillusioned post-exilic Jewish community in Alexandria. 190 Ornias’ temple was said to have stood for 243 (or 343 years according to source) before its final destruction by the Romans."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 Alexandria (as well as to other destinations). It also helped to launch a number of Jewish heresies. If this date is accepted as the terminus a quo for the generation of Gnosticism, we can fairly safely assume that any interaction between Gnosticism and Graeco-Egyptian magic only began in the early 2nd century CE. e. Christianity was, in reality, just another Jewish heresy, that managed to survive rather better than its competitors. The fact that the Christian church attacked these other heresies so vigorously was a function of the competitive fear felt by the early Church Fathers, who were concerned to preserve the purity of their nascent religion against the other Jewish heresies springing up around them.191 Christianity, in the sense of that religion preserved under that name today, added very little of significance to these magic texts, except the occasional insertion of the name Jesus.192 Besides, Christianity did not reach its status as a state religion till 391 CE, and during most of its subsequent existence, disapproved of and sought to vigorously destroy magic.193 f. Strangely, although Rome conquered Egypt in 30 BCE, Roman religion and magic added very little to Graeco-Egyptian magical texts.194 Romans still revered Greek culture, and well-educated Romans spoke Greek. Presumably the same attitude prevailed with regard to their attitude to magic. g. Mithras appears once in one of the longest complete sections of the PGM, but only as one amongst several gods and goddesses in the so-called ‘Mithras Liturgy.’195 I do not believe that this was a Mithraic rite, as it has none of the usual Mithraic initiatory steps or iconography, but a Mystery rite that happened to mention the god Mithra in a passing reference to a previous event. Although this list of sources sounds complex, and many of the papyri have two or more ingredients, it is usually fairly easy to identify the main root of any particular rite. For example, rites that make reference to all four archangels may be of Jewish origin, although   191 Marcion and Valentinus and others came from ‘Christian’ Gnosticism, which was formulated on the basis of the Jewish heretical vision of an evil creator god. 192 Where Jesus was used his name was used in the same sense as Solomon, or Eleazar, as a great magician of the recent past, who might strike fear into the hearts of the spirits conjured. Such commemoration of the names of powerful magicians of the past remained a feature of magic right up to modern times. 193 Volumes on early Christian magic, such as Meyer and Smith (1999) predominantly contain material with the marginal addition of ‘Jesus’ as a word of power, plus spells generated in Egypt in a Coptic environment. 194 To quote Tavenner (1966), p. 19: “The only two works in extant Latin literature which at all resemble a treatise on magic are the Apologia of Apuleius of Madaura, his defence against the charge of being a magician; and parts of Pliny’s Natural History, especially the first thirteen paragraphs of book thirty.” 195 PGM IV 475-820."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 the universal use of Jewish god names makes this less than certain. Likewise, a rite that primarily calls on Anubis or Osiris, or is written in Demotic, will almost certainly have Egyptian roots. Rites referencing Selene or chthonic Hermes will seldom mention an Egyptian god, and will fairly obviously have sprung from Greek roots. However it is not the purpose of this thesis to identify the roots of each Graeco-Egyptian papyrus, but rather to show the onwards transmission of their elements. It is sufficient to observe that as the Greeks traditionally deferred to the Egyptians in matters of magic (as did the Jews), and that the rites with the predominantly Egyptian elements are likely, but not always, to be the oldest. Papyri owing the bulk of their content to Jewish elements are very few, but the god names IAO and Sabaoth are to be found regularly distributed across many rites. The upshot of this is (as a number of scholars have remarked) that the presence of these god names is not an indication of the origin of the rite, but rather a symptom of the widespread use of such words of power that were considered universally effective, regardless of their origin. With regard to the provenance of the papyri, there is little to go on apart from the fact that Thebes was the reputed source of the Anastasi papyri, which make up the bulk of the PGM papyri.196 One of the few clear statements of provenance of one papyrus occurs at the beginning of PGM CXXII. 1-55 where it says: [This is] an excerpt of enchantments from the holy book called Hermes, found in Heliopolis in the innermost shrine of the temple, written in Egyptian [Demotic] letters and translated into Greek. One can deduce that if the book was casually ‘found’ in the library of an Egyptian temple, it is likely to have been removed at a rather late date, probably after 400 CE when the temple had fallen into ruin. Alternatively ‘found’ might really mean stolen, which still argues for a late date. The naming of the book Hermes is intriguing, but does not automatically assert that this book was part of the Hermetic literature, merely that the god was an important part of its contents, as he was in a number of magical papyri. For the theology and philosophy behind Graeco-Egyptian magic, there is no better source for both Neoplatonic Greek and Egyptian elements than Iamblichus’ De Mysteriis.197   196 Interestingly there is a Thebes in Greece as well, probably named after the Egyptian city, and with a similar later reputation for magic. Juratus, a much later Latin grimoire (circa 1225 CE) was reputedly written by Euclid of (the Greek) Thebes. 197 Iamblichus lived contemporaneously with the bulk of the writing of the PGM, and referred to many of the same gods, people, etc. De Mysteriis was written between 280 and 305 CE. A new edition (2003) of De Mysteriis, edited by Clarke, Dillon and Hershbell rectifies many of the problems of the older editions, of which the previous edition closest in thought to Iamblichus, but wearisome in expression, was that translated by Thomas Taylor (1821).

See also Gersh (1978) and Tanaseanu-Döbler (2013) for the development of theurgy after Iamblichus."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 Analysis of the PGM by Objective and Rite Types In order to relate the methods and implements used in PGM to the later Solomonic grimoires, it is necessary to categorise the rites. What initially looks like a confusing mass of heterogeneous material in the English translation is considerably clearer in the original Greek, where specific headwords are often used in the first line of each rite to identify its type. For example Bowl Skrying or Vessel Enquiry operations will almost always be identified as λεκανομαντεία, whilst operations designed to cause love or lust will almost always be identified as \u001b\b\u0017\b\u001c, agōgē or \u0001\u0006\u0010\u000b\u0003\t\u0013, philtron. Following this categorisation to its logical conclusion reveals that the original scribe has been quite systematic in his categorisation using either the method or the objective as his criterion.198 Although upon first sight the following may appear to be an overly ridged division of the rites, an examination of the original Greek text justifies this approach, as it was the habit of the original scribes to clearly designate the type of magical operation at the beginning of each rite. Each of these categories has then been assigned an arbitrary alphabetic code for convenience of analysis. A full list of the codes together with a count of the number of instances (and that expressed as a percentage of the whole of the PGM) will be found in Appendix 1.

This taxonomy relies upon the original scribe’s Greek categorisation. Where this is missing the precise content of each rite is used to ascertain the category. The specific Greek headword which exactly identifies the type of rite is given below in the description of each category. This headword is often obscured by the English translation, which will commonly use an imprecise equivalent like ‘charm’ rather than attempting an exact translation of the Greek name for the technique in each case. These Greek headwords are often found at or near the beginning of each rite, and will in some cases be rubricated. These key words are also listed in summary in Table 21. In the course of this analysis, three large sections of the papyri were seen to be complete books within themselves, as indeed has been identified by other scholars.208 These relate to the Mysteries and initiation rather than magic and have been categorised as ‘M.’ Some rites are listed by objective rather than rite type. Where one of these operations utilises a specific technique (e.g. amulets or defixiones) this rite has instead been allocated to the technique category rather than the objective (e.g. A – Amulets; W – Defixiones), as the concern of this thesis is with method rather than outcome. For example if a rite uses an   202 As distinct from invocations. 203 These are often a form of amulet, but have been separated out from category A because of their very specific objective.

In the case of health related formulae the Greek title will often contain \u001e\u0003\u001f - followed by the name of the disease.209 Therefore few conflicts of identification arise. Very fragmentary or very short formulae with no identifiable method, have been categorised as ‘X’ and passed over without comment, as the amount of material available for analysis of objective, method or implement is minimal or non-existent. Other techniques which are universal (like the ritual use of incense) will not be used as a category identifying criteria, but will be later considered in some detail. Rite types A Amulets210 PGM VII. 218-221 is a classic case of the translational confusion of amulets with phylacteries. The English translation of the title is “phylactery for daily fever with shivering fits” which continues with the translated phrase “wear as an amulet.” As it is clearly to be worn by a specific person to cure a specific disease, it is therefore an amulet.211 The title of PGM VII. 215-18 is translated as a “Stele of Aphrodite,” but its true nature is revealed in the next line, which confirms that it is to be engraved on “a strip of tin...with a bronze stylus” and carried by the client. Therefore it is an amulet, designed “to gain friendship, favour, success, and friends” for that client. This passage also throws an interesting light on the Egyptian understanding of ‘stele.’ Stele in Egyptological literature is usually understood to mean “an upright stone slab or column typically bearing a commemorative inscription or relief design.”212 In other procedures in the PGM, ‘stele’ can equally refer to a simple square of natron to be written on (see PGM VII. 215-218). Here it refers to a strip of tin to be engraved. The actual text or formula of the inscription can also be referred to as a ‘stele.’213 The meaning of stele is therefore much wider than that usually used by archaeologists, to refer to any rectangular surface engraved or written on with a (magical or religious) text. As demonstrated by the above examples, the literal translation of the title does not always truly indicate the rite type, which may have to be sought in a detailed reading of the whole text.   209 See Kotansky (1988), p.65. 210 Amulets do not often have a clear headword (like \u001e\f\u0003ι!\u0004\u0004\u0002\u000b!, periammata), but are identifiable from their context and the presence of personal names identifying the client(s). 211 If it were worn by a magician during an invocation, rather than by a patient for health reasons, then ‘phylactery’ would have been the correct term. 212 Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1999. 213 See also Ritner (2009), p. 68ff on magical healing stele."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 One of the clear indications that a lamella is a mass produced amulet is where the name of the person appears to have been added afterwards, sometimes by a different scribe, in a different hand, or squeezed in to a previously blank space.214 A clear example of this is the lamella now preserved by the Xerox Corporation in Connecticut, where the phrase “cure and preserve Eugenia whom Galenia bore” is squeezed into lines 14-16. The mass-produced nature of this amulet is confirmed by Faraone and Kotansky, yet the article’s title is ‘An Inscribed Gold Phylactery...’ a phrase which is then contradicted in the first sentence which correctly states that it is “an excellent example of a common type of amulet.”215 It is not my intention to be unnecessarily pedantic, but to clear the way to effectively separating those items made for clients for everyday wear (amulets) from those items specifically used by the magician in a ritual context (phylacteries). Amulets, which were the day-to-day ‘bread and butter’ client sales of professional magicians, make up 10.5% of all the PGM rites.216 B Bowl Skrying/Vessel Enquiry - \u0010\f\u0005\u0002\u0013\t\u0004\u0002\u0013\u000b\f\u0006\u0002 (lekanomanteia) Bowl skrying has a long history which clearly extends from the PGM period through the Byzantine Greek Hygromanteia, and beyond. In fact lekanomanteia217 is still practised in many Muslim areas today. The demotic word for this practice is shen ben or ‘vessel enquiry.’ It does not however relate to the Aramaic, Hebrew and Babylonian bowls which were found buried (usually inverted) in Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine, which appear to occur only in the 5th and 6th centuries, and which serve a totally different purpose as ‘demon traps.’218 The Mesopotamian bowls have been found buried under houses or near graves. They do not have a corresponding textual record, but are fairly obviously apotropaic, specifically for the binding of demons, a totally different objective to the bowls considered here. Furthermore they bear no trace of ever having contained liquids, an essential part of lekanomanteia. However they do attest many god and angel names in common with other PGM texts (but not specifically those of bowl skrying/vessel enquiry):219 however this simply demonstrates   214 In Jewish amulets the give-away phrase is Peloni bar Peloni. This is not a nomina magica, but an indication that this is the point where the client’s name should be inserted, when the amulet is sold. 215 Faraone and Kotansky (1988), p. 257. 216 See Appendix 1 for a full percentage breakdown of the contents of the PGM. 217 \u0010\f\u0005!\u0013 simply means ‘pot or pan,’ referring to the vessel that holds the liquid (water or oil). 218 For which see Montgomery (1913) and Naveh and Shaked (1985). 219 Including Gnostic: Ablanathanalba, Abrasax, Ialdabaot, Iao Zouka; Hebrew: Akatriel, Anqatam, Azriel, Barqiel, Dalqiel, Dfuniel, El, Gabriel, Hadriel, Hafkiel, Halusiel, Haniel, I-am-who-I-am, Kadutiel, Kariel, Kouriel, Lilith, Masagiel, Metatron, Michael, Moriath, Nuriel, Paspasim, Pastam, Payumiel, Puriel, Qoriel, Raphael, Sabaot, Samael, Samarel, Sandalphon, Sarafiel, Selah, Shakniel, Shamish, Shamriel, Shamshiel, Soutiel, Suriahel, Suriel, Tetragrammaton, ‘Uziel, Yah, Yahu, Yehoel, Yequtiel, Zebuth, Zotiel; Greek: Ares, Bar-Theon, Diyonisim, Eros, Gyllou, Helios, Hermes, Morphous,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 that they are part of shared Middle Eastern magical conventions. The bowls used in lekanomanteia were used for evocatory skrying, specifically by a virgin skryer gazing into a bowl (\u0010\f\u0005!\u0013) of liquid, accompanied by the magician’s invocations of the god or spirit involved.220 The practice is therefore one of active invocation rather than passive divination. The vessel is also referred to as an \"\b\b\t\u0007. On the whole the god most often called upon in the PGM for bowl or vessel divination was Anubis, lord of the Underworld, also very suggestive of the rite’s Egyptian origin. These operations are found mainly in the Demotic papyri, specifically PDM xiv. Therefore lekanomanteia or bowl skrying/vessel enquiry is almost certainly of Egyptian origin.221 Vessel enquiry makes up 3.0% of the PGM rites. C Calendrical Considerations (Katarchic Astrological Timing) Timing was considered very important for magical operations, and each hour of every day of the week had an angel (and later a demon) assigned to it. These attributions occur in fragmentary form in the PGM, but again in much greater detail in Byzantine Solomonic texts, and in the European grimoires, right through to modern times. However it is only in the PGM and the Hygromanteia that it is stressed that it is technically essential for the magician to call upon the angel of the hour before launching his ritual in that hour in order to gain credibility and help from those spiritual creatures he is attempting to command. By the time the material reached Latin Europe these angel names had been reduced to a look up table without any indication as to how they should be used. This is therefore one of many examples where the techniques outlined in the PGM or the Hygromanteia can throw considerable light on the exact function of often unexplained data in the European grimoires. Calendrical calculations make up 1.7% of the PGM rites.

These rites occur predominantly in PGM VII and PDM xiv, and are confined to the PGM/PDM, not being transmitted to either the Hygromanteia or the Clavicula Salomonis. Lamp skrying makes up        Pelagia, Sideros; Egyptian: Horus, ntrws syh, Ptah, tinyt, twinyt; Mesopotamian and sundry: Labartu, Bagdana, Danahish, Dlibat, Iabezebut, Iurba, Musagaoth, Sanoy, Sansanoy, Samangalaf, Sesegen bar Pherenges (sic), Smamit, Thraphiari. These are predominantly a mixture of Greek and Hebrew names, which you would expect by the 5th and 6th centuries. 220 See Ogden (2002), pp. 205-206 for his comment on PGM IV. 222-260. 221 There are only three PGM examples in Greek as opposed to more than eight Demotic PDM examples of lekanomanteia."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 3.0% of the PGM rites.

See also rite type ‘G,’ which involves interaction with the god as well as vision. These make up 0.8% of all the PGM rites. F Familiar Spirit or Assistant Daimon – \u001e!\u0003\f'\u0003\t\u0007 (paredros) The acquisition of a paredros, ‘familiar’ or ‘assistant daimon’ is a procedure which has always been part of magic, and continues to be so. The rationale was that in dealing with spirits it was always helpful to have one who is ‘tame’ and can act as a guide or intermediary with the denizens of the other world. This theme appears first in the Graeco-Egyptian texts, then in the Hygromanteia (and other Byzantine Solomonic texts), and later in the Latin and vernacular Solomonic grimoires. In the 1st/2nd century Testament of Solomon, Solomon has first to tame Ornias (which he does with the help of God, a ring and the archangel Michael), after which Ornias acts as a magical assistant and introduces him to, and helps him bind, the other 59 spirits listed in that text. In many later European grimoires, specific demons (such as Paimon in the Goetia) are said to “grant good familiars.” The concept of a spirit familiar is a long enduring idea. Although witchcraft is excluded from this thesis it is worth noting that many 16th and 17th century witchcraft confessions involved the admission that the witch had a familiar spirit in the form of a cat, toad or similar, and searching for the ‘witch’s mark’ became a standard procedure for witch-finders like Matthew Hopkins.222 This mark was reputedly the bodily point where the witch suckled her familiars or imps.223 In the late 19th century, the Golden Dawn and some of its offshoots taught methods of creating an artificial Elemental, which was effectively a ‘designer’ familiar. Hence this technique is one of enduring importance, and a technique used by magicians in almost every culture, over the whole time frame examined in this thesis. In fact this procedure is not coincidently the subject of the very first two sections in PGM I. 1-195, and was often considered an indispensable first step to magical practice. The opening line of the first procedure explains that “A [daimon comes] as an assistant who will reveal everything to you clearly and will be your [companion and] will eat and sleep with you.” This description seems to be of a very concrete entity. The theme of eating and drinking with spirits is   222 He was a self-appointed ‘Witchfinder General’ born in 1620, and active 1645-1647. 223 Whether true or not, this re-confirms the common perception of the very physical nature of such familiars."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 repeated in the Hygromanteia,224 and again in later European grimoires, such as the Grimorium Verum, where the magician is enjoined to lay out a physical table with choice foods in preparation for the arrival of the spirits: After supper, go secretly to the prepared room, light a good fire, and put a clean white tablecloth on your table. Place three chairs around the table, and in front of the chairs place three wheat rolls and three glasses of clear fresh water. ...The three people [spirits], having arrived, will sit by the fire, eating and drinking... The three persons will then draw lots to determine which one will remain with you... You will be able to question him or her about any art, science, or anything you wish.225 It is thus an excellent example of transmission and continuity of a technique. Rites for the acquisition of a magical assistant make up 1.1% of the PGM rites. G Gods: their invocation and association - \u0014\u000f\u0014\u000b!\u0014\fι\u0007 (sustaseis) The invocation of the gods and goddesses has formed an integral part of magic from ancient times right up to the late 19th century revival of magic by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The face-to-face encounters of the magician with a god were referred to in the PGM as συστάσεις (sustaseis). For direct vision of the god without interaction or specific form (α$τοψία, autopsia)226 see rite type ‘E.’ The ‘god’s arrival’ is called peh-netjer in Egyptian.227 This sometimes includes the god answering questions. These rites make up 6.5% of the PGM rites. H Health spells (\u001e\u0003\t - followed by disease name) There are a plethora of health spells in the PGM, most of them too short to establish much in the way of detailed methods, some extending for no more than a few lines. These and love spells are two of the rite types defined primarily by their objective rather than their method. Health spells are one of the most popular categories, making up 11.2% of the PGM rites. I Invisibility - \u001b\u0004\u0002#\u0003\u0017\u0014ι\u0007 (amayrōsis) The Greek word \u001b\u0004\u0002#\u0003\u0017\u0014ι\u0007 literally means ‘darkening.’ Although there are only three rites for invisibility, being 0.6% of the rites in the PGM, this objective occurs in almost all later grimoires, both Byzantine and Latin, and so is an important link between the magic of Egypt and the later grimoires.   224 In B2, f. 346-7, the oldest extant manuscript of the Hygromanteia. 225 Peterson (2007), pp. 44-45. 226 Luck (1987), p. 23. 227 Ritner (2008), p. 214-220."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 J Magical Statues - \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002 (stoicheia) Magical statues have been known in many cultures, from the giant statues of ancient Egypt, to the \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002 of Greek magic. One of the standard magical procedures related to magical statues was the opening of their mouth, or the introduction of breath, to enliven them, a procedure derived from the ancient Egyptian practice of ensouling statues, which later became the last step in the embalming process, opening the mouth of the deceased so he could ‘breathe.’ The manufacture of magical statues constitutes 1.1% of the PGM rites. K Magic Rings and Gemstones – '\u0002\u0005\u000b#\u0010ι\t\u0013 (daktylion) Magical rings are most commonly associated with Gnosticism, especially those including carved gemstones, but they have been used for much longer periods and in many cultures. Solomon’s ring is a very specific magical ring, reference to which occurs in the PGM, the Testament of Solomon, the Bible, The Arabian Nights, the Hygromanteia, the Clavicula Salomonis, the Goetia and in many other derived Latin and vernacular grimoires. The manufacture of magical rings and the use of gemstones in magic constitutes 1.5% of the PGM rites.

The unique feature of Graeco-Egyptian love spells (not replicated in any other culture) is that instead of merely attempting to make the object of the spell fall in love with the magician or his client, the god/goddess called is ordered to torment the object of the spell neither allowing him/her to eat or sleep till he/she comes and declare his/her love to the magician or his client. An even more extreme version of this is the addition of a ‘slander spell,’ in which the magician accuses the object of his love/lust of some form of sacrilegious behaviour, and enjoins the god/goddess to take revenge on the object of the spell, until they relent. Spells for separating lovers or friends are the reverse of this category but are also included here. Love spells are the most popular category, making up 16.9% of all the PGM rites. M Mysteries and Initiation Rites228 - \u0004\u000f\u0014\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\u0002 / \u000b\f\u0010\f\u000b\u0002\u0006 (mystēria / teletai) These form three important sections in the PGM, as they include the three largest self-contained books in the PGM collection of papyri. However these are initiation rituals,   228 Not magic per se."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 Mystery rituals, designed to invoke one of the gods/goddesses,229 for the benefit of the soul of the candidate, and are therefore not strictly magic. The essential quality offered by the Mysteries is spiritual immortality, through an intimate association with one god/goddess, rather than immediate gratification of more worldly objectives (as in magic). The fact of their inclusion in the PGM simply points up the fact that pre-5th century CE magicians were often also initiates of the Mysteries. One objective was to make the initiate conscious after death, rather than leaving him as just a wandering shade with no memory of his previous life.230 The Mystery rituals are the missing link which has always been left out of the arguments concerning the relationship between religion and magic. The Mysteries, and specifically these passages in the PGM, were not transferred to Byzantium or the Latin West, and form no part of later magical practice, as indeed they were not magic in the first place. The three Mystery rites found in three completely separate books within the PGM are:231 1. The so-called “Mithras Liturgy”232 2. The Monas233 or Eighth Hidden Book of Moses234 3. The Tenth Hidden Book of Moses235 These rites are not designed to achieve the many and varied personal objectives of magic (health, love, lust, health, power, victory, injury, etc) but solely to provide immortality and the companionship of the gods to the candidate, the main function of all Mystery rituals.236 These rituals make up just 1.1% of all the PGM rites, but take up 11.5% of the lines. The fact   229 Although several gods are mentioned in the “Mithras Liturgy” they are essentially part of the ladder to the supreme, unnamed, god. Mithras is not part of the process, merely named as part of a backward looking reference to a previous experience had by the initiator. 230 Part of the Mystery process may have included a descent into Hades/Amentet with a god/goddess such as Hermes as psychopomp. The fact that descent into Hades was one of the secrets of the initiation, is partly confirmed by Nero’s sudden refusal to be initiated at Eleusis, after he was told this was what to expect. When told, he may have thought that he may meet the shade of his mother, whom he had just recently murdered, and so immediately declined the ordeal. 231 It should be remembered that the whole corpus of the PGM is a collection of many different papyri, of which the longest is PGM IV. Even within each papyrus are a number of other texts brought together by the magician who owned them. These three ‘books’ are not an arbitrary excision, but were certainly separate books, with a separate existence, before being copied into these papyri. 232 PGM IV 475-820. 233 PGM XIII. 1-734. 234 There is no Ninth Hidden Book of Moses in this papyrus. However in a number of places, there are references to the (\u0010\fι'\u0006 or Key of Moses. Possibly this missing Key constituted the Ninth Hidden Book of Moses. There are no less than six forward references to it in PGM XIII. 21-22, 30-31, 35-36, 59-60, 228-229, 382-383 [erroneously referred to by Betz as 282-83], 431-432 and one backwards looking reference to it in the Tenth Hidden Book of Moses XIII. 735-743. In each case the reference is to just two things: the names of the Lords of the hours and days and the preparation of the incense referred to as the Egyptian ‘bean.’ Speculatively, this (\u0010\fι'\u0006 \u000b\u001c )\t*\u0014+\u0017\u0007 (sic) might later have given its title (and maybe its contents) to the Key (a name used in some manuscripts for the Hygromanteia), and later to the Clavicula Salomonis. 235 PGM XXX, 734-1077. 236 They are not even meant to provide ‘enlightenment’ in the way that quality is thought of by current New Age movements."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 that they are (as Mysteries) quite different from the other rites is further confirmed by the fact that they average 242 lines per rite.

Such practices were very popular in classical Greek times, and have endured also from dynastic Egyptian times, through Hellenic culture and European grimoires right up to the modern practice of spiritualism.

They make up only 0.8% of the PGM. P Prayers or Hymns - \f$\u0015\u001c (euchē) There is a considerable difference between an invocation, a prayer and a hymn. The simplistic explanation (which harks back to one of the popular distinctions between religion and magic) is that prayers are supplications whilst invocations are expressed as commands. Hymns can be added to either prayers or invocations, as they are designed to praise or flatter the god/goddess concerned. Prayers or hymns make up 1.7% of all the PGM rites. Q Daimonic Possession and its Exorcism Exorcistic formulae are not common in the PGM, but they do occur. One at least has been heavily Christianised.240 These make up only 0.8% of all the PGM rites.

As noted by Benedek Lang (2008), p. 41, Jean-Patrice Boudet suggested that ‘necromancy’ should be used in its original meaning of evocatory divination by the dead, whilst ‘nigromancy’ should refer just to evocation of demons. Kieckhefer (1997), p. 19 does not accept this logical division but sees ‘nigromancy’ as a relatively modern term. See also Kieckhefer (2003), pp. 152-153. 239 Johnston (2008), pp. 171-175 identifies eight PGM necromantic rites, but these do not exactly map onto this list of ‘N’ rites (see Appendix 2), as for example, PGM I. 262-347 is placed under lamp skrying in category ‘D,’ as lamp skrying is more prominent than any mentions of the dead. Johnston herself concedes that PGM IV. 154-285 is “actually part of an elaborate type of lecanomancy,” and it has therefore been so categorized here. In addition two ‘drowned animal’ rites have been included. 240 PGM IV. 1227-64."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 Rites for restraining anger are quite common in the PGM.

One highly significant operation gives detailed instruction for the construction of a laurel wood Table of Evocation, a protective floor circle as well as the names for each of the hours. All of this equipment is transmitted to, and becomes part of the development of magic, in both the Hygromanteia and in later Latin grimoires.241 Memory and foreknowledge formulae make up 1.7% of all the PGM rites. T Talismans - \u000b+\u0010\f\u0014\u0004\u0002 (telesma) The word talisman is derived from the Byzantine Greek \u000b+\u0010\f\u0014\u0004\u0002 telesma (“religious rite or consecration ceremony”) and not from either \u000b\f\u0010\fι\r\u0017 teleoō (“to bring to perfection or completion”)242 or from the Classical Greek \u000b+\u0010\f\u0014\u0004\u0002 telesma (“money paid”).243 This word also appears as an Arabic loan word, tilsām. Talismans are designed to embody specific magical objectives, and are not designed for generalised protection or health like an amulet. Talismans are drawn, painted, engraved or carved designs made on paper, parchment, metal or occasionally stone. Their objectives are proactive and very specific, such as winning the love of a specific woman, winning a specific chariot race, etc, and not for general protection. For example a Venus talisman might be designed to accumulate the qualities of that planet/goddess to act for the magician in a specific operation of love for a specific woman. Talismans are not usually worn (as are amulets), but can be simply created, charged, and then left to do their work. A pentacle is a specific type of talisman, which perhaps originally incorporated the figure of a pentagram inscribed within a circle. Now the term is often used interchangeably with ‘talisman.’ The manufacture of talismans for specific magical purposes makes up 2.1% of all the PGM rites.   241 PGM III. 282-409. 242 Johnston (2008), p. 155 associates \u000b\f\u0010\fι\r\u0017, in the sense of ‘perfection,’ with the Greek words for initiate and initiation. See PGM IV. 26-51 for this usage. 243 This shows that the word came into use via Byzantine Greek magical texts, rather than necessarily being part of Classical Greek religion. The term is likely to have been a transliteration from Arabic, and therefore possibly originally derived from the astral magic tradition."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 U Phylacteries, Tefillin, Lamen Phylactery - \u0001\u000f\u0010\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\t\u0013 (phylakterion) A phylactery is worn and must include a written magical or religious text.244 Phylactery is a Greek word which may be derived from the Greek phylaktikos, which means ‘a safeguard or preservative.’245 In Latin texts the word is usually rendered as phylacterium.246 Despite common perception, ‘phylactery’ is not specifically a Jewish religious observance. Phylactery strips of parchment bound around the arms appear in a number of places in the PGM,247 usually specified at the end of the rite where the ritual equipment is listed separately. In the PGM, phylacteries are written on papyrus or parchment (black and white sheepskin)248 and designed to be worn by the magician during a rite to protect himself from the spiritual creatures, even including the gods, which he was invoking, not on a day-to-day basis (as are amulets).249 The manufacture of phylacteries for the protection of the magician makes up 1.3% of all PGM rites. This figure is however low, as there are at least 16 other magician’s phylacteries imbedded at the end of other rites (as part of the equipment section of those rites). These have been listed separately as U2 in Appendix 2, and are not consolidated into the statistics, as they are parts of already counted rites. If they had been added into the count of phylacteries in Appendix 1, the total would have been 5.3% of the rites. Tefillin (‘Jewish Phylacteries’) Phylacteries are in modern times mostly associated with Jewish practice. Although they were called by Hellenised Jews phylaktēria, the more correct equivalent of ‘phylactery’ in Hebrew is the word tefillin (}ilpt). A Jewish phylactery or tefillin consists of a small leather case (originally cylindrical but now usually cubical) made either of parchment or of black calfskin, containing slips of parchment or vellum on which are written the specific scriptural passages Exodus 13: 1-10 and 11-16, Deuteronomy 6: 4-9, 11: 13-21.250 They are traditionally bound tightly on the forehead and the left arm by orthodox Jewish men during morning prayer, and rarely in times of potential danger, like a plane flight, but not used under any other conditions. A tefillin is not used on a day-to-day basis (like an amulet), nor in magical   244 Hence many of the so-called amulets listed in the PGM are in fact phylacteries or talismans. 245 The word ‘phylactery’ only appears once in the New Testament (Matthew 23:5) where it is just a slighting reference to the tefillin of the rabbis. 246 See Betz (1996), pp. 51, 54, 68. 247 For example in PGM IV. 813. 248 In “Mithras Liturgy” in PGM IV. 814-820. 249 The Christian habit of keeping the bodily remains of saints as relics also meant that the meaning of ‘phylactery’ was sometimes extended to include cases for such relics. 250 The tefillin found at Qumran also had extracts from Deuteronomy 10:12 – 11:12 and 32:1-33."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 practice, nor does it appear in the PGM, and so it will not be further considered here. Lamen (‘Magician’s Phylacteries’) ‘Lamen’ is the most specific term. The lamen of the mediaeval magician is a direct descendant of the phylactery of the Graeco-Egyptian magician. In mediaeval and later magical texts, phylacterium was often rendered as lamen. Lamen always has the technical sense of something worn solely by a magician for protection from the entities he invoked, specifically at the time of the ritual. At no point was the word ‘lamen’ used in the sense of a general amulet, or used in a context outside of ritual magic. Interestingly the lamen often became a double (or double-sided) piece of parchment bearing both the sigil of the spirit being invoked and that of the angel understood to control that spirit.251 V Visions and Dreams Evoked by Magic - -\u0013\fι\u0003\u0002ι\u000b\u000b\r\u0013 (oneiraitēton) Invocations to secure relevant dreams from a god, or even the visible appearance of a god, are a common practice in the PGM. These techniques were also used to send dreams to a third party (oneiropompeia). These procedures sometimes involve other subsidiary techniques, like invocation or use of the evocatory skrying lamp. The invocation of a god in a dream and the sending of dreams to third parties makes up 8.2% of all the PGM rites. W Defixiones - \u0005\u0002\u000b!'\f\u0014\u0004\tι (katadesmoi) Defixiones are an appeal, or order, to the dead to affect a particular desired magical result. The theory behind them is that the spirits of the dead buried can be constrained by the words on the defixio to carry out the specific orders of the magician who created the defixio, or to communicate with daimones or gods who can do so. The restless dead (especially the victims of murder or premature death) are thought to be constrained by the defixio, to carry out the wishes of the magician.252 The manufacture of defixiones for specific magical purposes makes up 2.3% of all the PGM rites. X Excluded Fragments These passages provide too little material to properly identify either their purpose or method. They are listed in full in Appendix 2 in order that the corpus of Graeco-Egyptian magical material analysed there is complete. Although these fragments make up 8.7% of all the PGM rites numerically, their actual extent in terms of number of lines is very small.   251 See Skinner & Rankine (2010), p. 103. 252 This practice resurfaces again in Europe where beans are buried in churchyards and subsequently dug up to help confer invisibility. Food and drink offerings to the dead are a part of many cultures, but the binding of specifically restless spirits to carry out magical acts appears to be unique to Egypt."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Y Use of Herbs and Plants in Magic - \u001d\t\u000b!\u0013. (botanē) Lists of the magical properties of herbs are an important section in the PGM, as they provide concrete items whose use in magic can be tracked across various cultures. This practice is slightly more complicated in the PGM by the habit of priests and magicians of listing quite common ingredients such as herbs and other items with flowery and alarming names. The magical use of herbs and plants makes up 1.1% of all the PGM rites. Z ‘Evil Sleep’ and Death - nktk bin (Demotic) These formulae are the province of the \u0001!\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0005\t\u0007 (pharmakos) rather than the magician as these are concerned with the use of drugs, herbs and poisons. These formulae are solely demotic and only make up 2.7% of all the PGM rites in number, but a very small proportion in terms of the number of lines of text allocated to them. \u0002 Minor Magical Procedures There are usually only one or two examples of each of these procedures, which are therefore of less use for comparative examination of specific techniques. These procedures include winning at dice, catching a thief, etc. Procedure for catching a thief do however re-appear in later Latin grimoires. They do not form a large corpus like, for example, love spells or the arrival of a god. All of these are small, being between one and 25 lines long. These single operations and minor magical procedures make up 4.6% of the PGM rites. β Victory Spell – \u0013ι\u0005\u000bι\u0005\r\u0013 (nikētikon) Victory spells, particularly in the context of chariot races.

The Input of Jewish Magic to Graeco-Egyptian Magic and the Clavicula Salomonis “Ten measures of magic came into the world. Egypt received nine of these, the rest of the world one measure.” - Talmud, b. Qid. 49b. As confirmed by the above quotation, even the Talmud acknowledged that magic came primarily from Egypt, rather than from Jewish sources. There are no clear traces of the methods of Solomonic magic in pre-Christian Jewish sources. Bohak is of the opinion that there was no tradition at all (and therefore no surviving documents) of Jewish scribal magic, apart from general exorcistic hymns, before the 3rd century CE: In the Second Temple period, we already have much evidence for the writing down of exorcistic hymns (Nitzan 1994: 227-72; Eshel 2003), but no real evidence for the use of magical recipe books or even of written amulets (cf. Swartz 2001, Bohak 2008: 70-142, and Cohn 2008). But from the 3rd or 4th century CE, and probably under the influence of Graeco-Egyptian magic, of the kind reflected in the Greek magical papyri, we witness the rise of a fully scribal Jewish magical tradition, in which writing is used both in the transmission of magical knowhow and in the magical praxis itself (Bohak 2008: 281-85).255 The corollary of this statement is that as it appeared first, Graeco-Egyptian magic contributed to the establishment of a Jewish magical tradition, rather than the other way around. Although god and angel names were liberally borrowed from the Jewish tradition, it appears that method was not. Although magical practice may have been frowned upon by the Jewish community, it is however certain that many of the senior Rabbis were well acquainted with its principles by the time of the Talmud (after 200 CE): Rabbi Yohanan256 said (b. Sanhedrin 17a and b. Menahot 65a) that knowledge of magic was one of the prerequisites for sitting in the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish court of law — not only in order to detect and deter magicians, but also in order to beat them at their own game, and to gain the upper hand against other offenders as well.257 There are a number of very specific and well-documented contributions made from Jewish magic to the PGM, and also to later Byzantine and Latin Solomonic grimoire magic. These contributions apparently did not include the Solomonic method. The main elements that were passed on from Jewish magic are clearly defined as follows:258 a) The god names in the PGM derive from a number of sources, including Egyptian and Greek, but characteristic god names like Iao, IHVH, Yah or Sabaoth without doubt come from   255 Bohak (1999), p. 125. My italics. 256 Probably Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai (30-90 CE). 257 Bohak (1999), p. 120. 258 I will deal with the case of the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh below. See Gollancz (1903, 1914, 2008)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 the Jewish tradition. In the context of the PGM they are just other nomina magica, and carry no specific hint of monotheistic Jewish religion with them. These names were later passed on to the Hygromanteia, and later still the Clavicula Salomonis and vernacular grimoires. b) The vast bulk of angel (and some demon) names are derived from Jewish sources. The biblical archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel are well documented. They in turn probably derive from Babylonia.259 In the first centuries of the Christian era, books like the three Books of Enoch generated a range of angel names, especially those of the angels of the seven Heavens, and of the 12 zodiacal signs. Although the hekhalot literature is primarily mystical rather than magical, it too added to the repertoire of angelic names. Later, particularly in the Geonic period (650-1250 CE) a plethora of angels, like the 168 angels of the hours of the days of the week (24 x 7), were generated,260 and these have passed directly into the Hygromanteia, without going via the PGM. No trace of these 168 names is to be found in the PGM. Some demon names passed from the Testament of Solomon to the Hygromanteia. c) Just as the concept of angels was probably derived from Babylon, so the practice of oil magic probably entered Jewish practice from the same source. The practices of oil, water and lamp flame skrying accompanied by evocation are commonly attested in the PGM. Bohak is certainly of the opinion that it was the Graeco-Egyptian technology of magic that informed the Jewish magical tradition. His example focuses on the charactêres, but his contention applies to the whole ‘massive’ entry of the technology of magic into Jewish magic: For the time being, let us return to late antiquity, and note how the charactêres exemplify the massive entry of technological innovations from the Greco-Egyptian magic of late antiquity into the Jewish magical tradition, and their absorption there... we see a set of foreign elements which was so fully naturalized in the Jewish magical tradition – and in some medieval cases also fully Judaized – as to assure its survival within that tradition to our very days.261 It is probable that both the Jewish and the Egyptian practices came separately from Babylon. Daiches supports the view that Babylon was the source of both Jewish and Egyptian practices on the grounds of “striking parallels to Babylonian magical texts as well as to the Jewish.”262 Their origins can be seen in both the PGM (lamp skrying) and the Jewish tradition (“princes of the thumb”), which are attested in Jewish records in the 11th century   259 The concept of an angelic hierarchy came to the fore during the time of the Babylonian captivity from 597-538 BCE. 260 Pingree (1980), p. 10. 261 Bohak (2008), p. 274. 262 Published in Daiches (1913), pp. 5-6. The Babylonian Maklū text published by Tallqvist which he refers to, is also quoted in Daiches (1913), p. 4."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 commentaries of Rashi.263 Either way these skrying practices also influenced the Hygromanteia. Because of the many references in Jewish sources, I suspect the direction of transmission was from Jewish sources to the Hygromantiea. But these skrying practices did not then make their way into the Latin or vernacular Solomonic grimoires.264 It is clear that these practices formed the basis for the evocatory skrying practices delineated in the last section of the Hygromanteia (chapters 47-57), and in a fragmentary fashion into later European skrying up to the present century. In chapter 8.2, below, I will demonstrate very specific parallels between these chapters of the Hygromanteia and a number of 16th/17th century Jewish manuscripts from the library of Moses Gaster.265 The parallels even extend to the wording of both procedures. Because of this, despite their late date, I think it is probable that these Jewish oil and water skrying procedures were copied into the Hygromanteia. d) The pentacles which appear in some of the Text-Groups of the Key of Solomon are not derived from the Hygromanteia but come directly from an original Hebrew source. Although readers who only examined Mathers’ version of the Key might reasonably assume that the pentacles were always part and parcel of the Key of Solomon, in fact they are missing from most of the unpublished manuscripts of that text, and missing completely from all the manuscripts of the Hygromanteia. However the pentacles are present, in a more complete form in a Hebrew manuscript entitled tvtvah rps Sepher ha-Otot,266 or ‘The Book of the Signs.’267 This strongly suggests that the pentacles originally come from a Hebrew, not a Greek source. Despite Mathers’ diligence in attempting to reconstruct the Hebrew from the French and English manuscripts of the Key, his work is nowhere as correct or complete as that found in this Hebrew manuscript. Therefore we can say with some confidence that there was definitely a Hebrew original, at least of the pentacles, the proof of which lies in the existence of the very detailed pentacles in the Sepher ha-Otot, and their much less detailed form in the Latin Solomonic manuscripts. The Greek manuscripts of the Hygromanteia are even less detailed being virtual ‘thumbnails’ by comparison. There is, however, no evidence earlier than 1700 CE that the Solomonic method of evocation,   263 Sanhedrin 67b. Other references to this procedure occur in Chochmat ha-Nefesh, 16d, 18a, 20c, 28d, 29a; Ziyuni, 10c; Redak on Ezekiel, 21:26; Nishmat Chayim, III, 19. 264 Simple crystal skrying without the full evocatory apparatus appears in texts by Trithemius and later magicians, but not in the Clavicula Salomonis. See Barrett (1801), Book II, pp. 135 ff. for Trithemius’ Art of Drawing Spirits into Crystals. 265 Daiches (1913), pp. 12-27. 266 A letter by letter transliteration yields ‘Sepher ha-Avtot,’ but as the vav should be treated as a mater lectionis, so the transliteration becomes Sepher ha-Otot.

Genizah Fragments The largest collection of Hebrew magical documents so far found was retrieved from the genizah of the Fustat synagogue in old Cairo. The bulk of this documentation of Jewish magic in Alexandria is still kept in Cambridge and several other repositories. Unfortunately Schechter, who was responsible for retrieving much of it, and his successors, were much more interested in the religious content of the Genizah, and so it is only in the last 25 years that the magical content has begun to receive significant attention. In 2010 Gideon Bohak concluded that 1690 of the 140,000 Genizah fragments stored in Cambridge268 fall into the ‘MADA’ category. MADA is his charming characterisation of fragments which pertain to any of the following categories: magic, astrology, divination or alchemy.269 His breakdown of the MADA fragments by broad category is: Magic270  1026 Astrology 349 Divination271 247 Alchemy  68  ------- Total  1690 fragments Addressing the 1026 magical fragments, it is noticeable that many relate to just nine already known Jewish magical texts.272 The most frequently occurring identifiable texts (with their number of fragments) are: Title Fragments Author Sepher Šimmuš Tehillim273 51 Sepher ha-Razim274 38   268 Note that Cambridge holds only approximately 73% of the 190,000 fragments from the Cairo Fustat synagogue, the rest having made their way to Oxford and several American locations, so these figures, and any percentages derived from them must be treated with caution. Nevertheless, I believe that Bohak has identified almost all MADA fragments at Cambridge. 269 Bohak (2010), pp. 53-80. 270 Bohak classifies hemerologia (24 fragments) and horologia (12) under divination, but as they deal with demons and magical qualities of specific hours, they may more correctly be listed under magic. Such a re-allocation would have resulted in 1062 (rather than 1026) fragments relating to magic. 271 Of which goralot (divination by lots) = 128; oneiromancy = 62; geomancy = 22. Geomancy was of Islamic origin, whilst oneiromancy was only of passing concern to the magicians of the PGM. 272 It is possible that Bohak may not have identified the provenance of all the fragments, so the number of identified titles may increase as the corpus continues to be studied. 273 The Book of Practical Psalms. \\ilht cvmc rps.

Sefer Raziel, probably compiled in the thirteenth century and containing much Geonic mystical material (so potent were its contents considered that mere possession of the book was believed to prevent fires), and the anonymous Shimmush Tehillim, “The (Magical) Use of the Psalms,” were all, besides some of the works of Eleazar of Worms and his school, such as Hochmat HaNefesh, which contains more or less pertinent material.289 He goes on to add that he believes there must be more material on magic “hidden away in European libraries,”290 which is certainly true. For example Worms circa 1700 was the probable origin of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage,291 a text unknown to Trachtenberg. The method embodied in Abramelin is one of 6-18 months of prayer and piety followed by the use of pentacles in the form of numeric and alpha-squares,292 and not one of directly evocatory magic. Although Trachtenberg’s conclusions might be a little out of date, clear evidence of evocation and the Solomonic method have yet to be identified by academics in Hebrew collections in Europe. The other magical classics listed above in Bohak’s MADA survey of Genizah fragments, such as Sepher ha-Razim and the Harba de Moshe (Sword of Moses), contain many angelic names but no description of Solomonic method. In fact Gaster compared the range of nomina magica in the Sword with those in the PGM and concluded that: ...these [PGM] Papyri mark as it were the first stages of this process of growth by the assimilation of various elements [of the nomina magica] and combinations into one complete vade-mecum for the magician or conjurer. In the “Sword” we have the full development of that process, which must have run its course at a very early period.293 Despite Gaster seeing the Sword of Moses as the summa of the PGM in the matter of nomina magica, it (disappointingly) does not have the same relevance for method. Part III contains the method, but without any hint of the Solomonic method of evocation of spiritual   288 Swartz (2006), pp. 305-318 for details of magical procedures in the Genizah texts. 289 Trachtenberg (2004), pp. 315-316. 290 Trachtenberg (2004), p. 316. 291 Mathers (1900) and Dehn (2006). 292 This is further support for the origin of the pentacles in the Clavicula Salomonis coming from Jewish sources. 293 Gaster (1970), p. 19. However the ‘full development’ that Gaster mentions is not nearly as fully developed as the Greek and Latin Solomonic methods. The Sword follows the Jewish tradition of using powerful names of god and the angels, but with no elaboration of method or equipment."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 creatures.294 In fact the Sword follows the pattern of other texts of Jewish magic, relying to a large extent on the recitation of holy names and the writing of a few talismans, rather than formalised Solomonic ritual evocation. The Hebrew Sepher Raziel (strangely missing from the above Genizah list) is more useful, but still not forthcoming about Solomonic method. The completely unrelated (except in title) Latin and English Sepher Raziel as dealt with elsewhere in this thesis, does however use the Solomonic method.295 The Hekhalot literature It is relevant to briefly examine the Hekhalot literature, as Morton Smith claimed a great deal of identity between it and the PGM.296 The gods of Greece such as Helios and Aphrodite may be glimpsed in Sepher ha-Razim, but are definitely not to be found in the hekhalot.297 This literature, extant from the 3rd to the 8th centuries CE, is concerned with “rising on the planes” (to use modern terminology) or journeying from one of the seven heavens to another (to use a more traditional image), with the eventual hope of meeting god face-to-face. This literature is also referred to as merkavah/merkabah literature because the journey was often visualized as travelling ‘downwards’ in an astral chariot (the literal meaning of the word).298 This material is to a large extent a mystical and rabbinic practice, but the use of secret passwords at the various doorways or portals to the Halls or hekhalot, to get past their angelic guardians, give it a superficial magical colouring. Morton Smith wrote that: Much of the celestial personnel of the hekhalot is found also in the magical papyri and in Gnosticism. Not only have the papyri and the Gnostics taken over Hebrew names, but the hekhalot have taken over Greek names and sometimes have even taken back Greek corruptions of names which were originally Hebrew.299 This appears to be a rather sweeping and not altogether accurate statement. The traffic in names was not nearly as reciprocal as Morton Smith implies. The vast majority of the angelic   294 Gaster worked from just one manuscript of the Sword (Codex Hebrew Gaster 178), so it is possible that the five Genizah fragments might add something to section III. Unfortunately Gaster replaces the nomina magica with an ‘X’ rather than simply transliterating them. 295 This implies that this Raziel is either much later than the Genizah period, or was solely a northern European production despite its Hebraic title. In some manuscripts the title is deformed to Cephar Raziel and the few bits of Hebrew are almost completely unrecognizable, confirming that these particular manuscripts were written by non-Jewish scribes. 296 Smith (1963), p. 150. 297 Lesses (1996), p.46. 298 Strangely this is often described as descending.

Some of these god and angelic names have been taken over into the PGM,300 rather than the other way around. But these names in the PGM could easily have come from Jewish sources other than the hekhalot. These names could for example have been derived from the Septuagint which had been available in Alexandria from the late 3rd century BCE.301 The concept of the chariot very clearly comes from Jewish sources, specifically Ezekiel, whose vision was of a very detailed and many wheeled and winged chariot.302 The concept of doorways guarded by angels who required very specific passwords may have passed in the opposite direction, from Egyptian conceptions of the Duat, with its many guarded portals, to the hekhalot. The predominant direction of traffic is from the Hebrew sources into the Gnostic texts (which were in the early years Hebrew heresies anyway) and the PGM where they enjoyed the reputation of being powerful words of coercion, especially Sabaoth and IAO (derived from the Hebrew tvabx and hvhi respectively). Strangely, very few, if any Solomonic magical techniques appear to have come from these Jewish sources. Lesses puts it succinctly: The Graeco-Egyptian ritual texts draw names of divinities from Jewish, Greek, Egyptian, Roman, or Mesopotamian traditions, while the hekhalot adjurations [only] use Hebrew names of God and the angels. They do not incorporate the names of the Greek, Egyptian, or Roman deities.303 This is a much more accurate statement of the situation than Morton Smith’s wide ranging remarks.304 From the point of view of tracing the evolvement of magical methods, it can be seen that although the hekhalot literature may have passed some god and angel names to the PGM, it did not pass any actual magical techniques. Furthermore the procedure used by the hekhalot devotees (and still in use today) was one of piety, intense prayer and meditation, with the minimal use of invocation, and absolutely no use of evocation. On the whole Rabbinical Judaism warned against the studying of such hekhalot material, and so it became a separate channel closer to Kabbalistic speculations than traditional Judaism. The hekhalot literature is basically mysticism, albeit very vivid mysticism, and not part of the magical tradition.305 Scholem characterises the hekhalot material as ‘ecstaticism’ as opposed to magic.306   300 Such as \u0018\u0019\u001a, Elohim, Sabaoth/Tzabaoth, etc. 301 Its translation was not fully completed till 132 BCE. 302 Ezekiel 1: 15-21; 10: 9-17. 303 Lesses (1996), p. 52-53. 304 See Lewy (1969) for a discussion of the Greek phrases and nouns to be found in Hekhalot Rabbati. 305 Interestingly the angel referred to as the ‘Lord God of Israel’ is Zoharariel, which might better be read as ‘Zohar Ariel,’ an angel name following the name of that great classic of the Kabbalah. 306 Scholem (1955), pp. 50-60, 78."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 It is clear that in the context of magic there is always a hierarchy of spiritual creatures,307 in which any sense of a strictly monotheistic system is lost. For if there is only a meditative appeal to the one god, as in Judaism, then this is meditation/prayer rather than magic. The Case against the Hebrew Roots of the Clavicula Salomonis One text that is often held up as a proof of the Hebrew roots of the Clavicula Salomonis, is the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh, hmlc htpm rps (‘The Book of the Key of Solomon’) which is found in three Hebrew manuscripts dating from 1700-1729. These manuscripts have been suggested as the source of the many Western manuscripts of the Key of Solomon by Hermann Gollancz who discovered one version in his father’s library and first published it in 1903 and 1914.308 There are three manuscript sources of the text: 309 a) The Gollancz manuscript, written in cursive Hebrew in Amsterdam, dated 1700 (with 79 folios).310 b) Rosenthaliana MS 12, f. 1-74 at the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana in Amsterdam. It consists of 74 folios bound with two further but separate texts of 16 and 30 folios each. This is a manuscript written by Isaac Zekel ben Yidel Kohen of Worms in Amsterdam from a copy by Judah Perez (London, 1729). It is the most complete manuscript. c) The two manuscripts in the British Library: Oriental MS 6360 (15 folios)311 and Oriental MS 14759 (53 folios).312 Rohrbacher-Sticker has ascertained that one is a continuation of the other, so they effectively form one manuscript of 68 folios. Despite Gollancz wishing to believe that he had found the Hebrew original of the Key, he concedes that: A hurried survey of these very MSS [of the Clavicula Salomonis] might easily convince one that they are anything but Jewish in character, several of them containing illustrations which, in the eye of the Jewish Law, would be regarded as blasphemous; the human face or more extended   307 See chapter 5.1. 308 Gollancz (1852-1930), was a British Rabbi and well respected Hebrew scholar who was the Goldsmith Professor of Hebrew at University College, London from 1902 to 1924. 309 A facsimile of the Gollancz manuscript including Gollancz’s commentary and an introduction by Skinner, has recently been published as Gollancz (2008). 310 Gollancz found the manuscript in his father’s library at the beginning of the 20th century, and he published a commentary on it under the name of Clavicula Salomonis in 1903, and then a full facsimile of it in 1914 as Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh (its correct Hebrew title). 311 This manuscript is called hnblh rps Sepher ha-Levanah, and six folios were published in Hebrew in Greenup (1912). He suggests the manuscript dates back to the 16th century, but 17th century seems much more likely. The Hebrew was reprinted, with a translation by Calanit Nachshon, in Karr & Skinner (2011), pp. 68-98 (Hebrew), 102-123 (English). 312 The connection between these two halves of one manuscript which had become separated was established by Rohrbacher-Sticker (1993/4) and (1995).

They have no bearing on the problem of a possible Hebrew original for that work.316 I concur with his view. Scholem also assumed that the Maphteah Shelomoh was a late Jewish adaptation of a “Latin (or rather Italian) Clavicula [Salomonis] text of the Renaissance period” which “contains Christian, Jewish, and Arabic elements which either lie unmixed side by side or show in parts a mutual permeation.”317 His conclusion stems from the frequency of Latin and Italian words, whose presence only makes sense if it were a Hebrew copy of a Latin or Italian Clavicula Salomonis text.318 Research by Rohrbacher-Sticker, Schiffman and Swartz, also supports Scholem’s conclusions.319 Further proofs of the derivation of Maphteah Shelomoh from a Latin/Italian original can be found in the second manuscript of Maphteah Shelomoh listed above.320 In the last (10th) chapter,321 there is a roughly drawn table of the correspondences between the planets/zodiac signs and various plants. The Latin names for the stones, plants and animals were apparently too difficult to translate, so the scribe has simply left them all in Latin: [Jupiter] berilus; [Mars] onix; [Sun] crisolitus; [Venus] chaspis [jaspis=jasper?]; [Mercury] tophasius [topaz]; [Moon] Sardius; [Saturn] Carbuncolus [Carbuncle]. Likewise with zodiacal animals: [Jupiter] aquila [eagle]; [Mars] equus [horse]; [Sun] leo [lion]; [Venus] omomo [woman?]; [Mercury] serpens [snake]; [Moon] bos [cow]; [Saturn] drago [dragon].322 Other evidence of the Latin sources of the Maphteah Shelomoh text is to be found on f. 9 of the second manuscript, where the Latin names of the 12 zodiacal signs (Aries, Taurus, etc) are simply transliterated into Hebrew rather than using the Hebrew names of the months (Nissan, Iyyar, Sivan, etc) that one would expect to find if the text were truly Hebrew in origin.

From remarks made by the copyist, it is clear that it was copied from an earlier manuscript. This earlier manuscript might well be the one mentioned by the Italian Kabbalist Gedaliah ibn Yahya (1515-1587) in his book Shalshelet ha-Kabbalah first published in Venice in 1587.323 Even if this were the source, this date is still considerably later than the extant manuscripts of the Hygromanteia which date from 1440. The cursive Hebrew script of the Maphteah Shelomoh is typically an Italian hand. Many Italian words appear in a transliterated form, rather than in translation, further confirming that the source text was in Italian (and Latin), rather than in Hebrew. Possible cities of origin include Naples and Venice.324 Naples is expressly mentioned in the manuscript in the transliterated form of ‘Napoli’ (ilvpan).325 Most tellingly, the scribe even failed to recognise many of the Jewish elements present in their Latinised form, transliterating such words rather than translating them. Words in Greek and Arabic were similarly treated, and in a number of places (such as folios 36a and 39b) the scribe freely admits he did not understand what he was copying. If he had been copying Hebrew from a Hebrew original these problems would of course not have arisen, and then certainly not for the Hebrew words. Rohrbacher-Sticker has also identified a number of Christian procedural elements, such as the dipping of a cross in holy water, which would certainly not have been part of any Hebrew magical text.326 Rohrbacher-Sticker was also able to identify 19 transliterated Greek words. Some of the most interesting are \u0015\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003\u0002\u0007, magical characteres (transliterated as irifqrq)327 rather than using the perfectly good Hebrew alternative. Other very specifically Christian words include \"\bι\t\u0007, hagios (or agios as read by the scribe), holy (transliterated as cvaiga);328 and \u001e\u0002\u0003!\u0005\u0010\u000b\t\u0007, the Holy Spirit (transliterated as cvfilqarp).329 But the most astonishing name of all is that of \f\u0003\u001d\u000e, Erbēth (transliterated as fvbrva),330 which derives directly from the PGM, where it is frequently found amongst the nomina magica of Egyptian derivation relating to Typhon/Seth.   323 Shalshelet ha-Kabbalah has been frequently published: in Venice in 1587; Cracow, 1596; Amsterdam, 1697; Zolkiev, 1802 and 1804; Polonnoye, 1814; Lemberg, 1862; and Jerusalem 1962. See p. 231 in the Jerusalem edition, and p. 80a in the Amsterdam edition. 324 Venice is where the Shalshelet ha-Qabbalah was first published, and a city through which many Greek Hermetic and Hebrew Kabbalistic texts were first introduced to Western Europe. 325 f. 37a. 326 See folio 37a, cited by Rohrbacher-Sticker (1995), p. 132. 327 F. 8b. 328 F. 36a. 329 F. 34b. 330 F. 42a."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 Of the more than 40 examples of direct transliteration from Latin or Italian, }vmfi aiv Via Itmon (the Path of Metatron)331 is one of the most interesting examples, although not mentioned by Rohrbacher-Sticker.332 This phrase marks out the exit route from the Solomonic circle of protection, used by the magician to enter and exit the circle.333 Tetragrammaton is a descriptive Greek word meaning the four (‘tetra’) letter (‘gramma’) name of god. It was used by Greek writers to refer to the Hebrew hvhi IHVH.334 If a Hebrew translator wished to translate a Greek or Latin text containing IHVH back into Hebrew they would automatically translate it as HVHI (or maybe even gloss it as inda Adonai, out of respect). But this scribe assumed it was some foreign nomen magicum and simply transliterated the word into Hebrew as }OtMrgrtt TTRGRMTON, omitting some of the vowels as one would expect. The scribe was therefore completely unaware of the meaning of Tetragrammaton. This word alone is clear proof that the text is a translation from a Latin/Italian original not from a Hebrew original. Finally, the part of the text which Gollancz appeared to think is most Jewish, the 26 prayers in the first book of the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh, have been confirmed as translations of prayers found in the Latin grimoire Juratus: From this introduction [by Gollancz] it becomes pretty clear that one of the sources for this melange of magic must, indeed, have been the LIH [Juratus]. For instance, we are told that the text [of the first section] contains twenty-six prayers, of which some are in Hebrew, while others consist of ‘Cabbalistic names,’335 and when the editor goes on to quote and translate the first seven,336 they turn out to be slightly adapted versions of the prayers in chapters LIII – LIX of the LIH [Juratus], thus leading us to surmise that the remaining nineteen are also borrowed from the LIH [Juratus], presumably [being] the nineteen prayers in chapters LX – LXXVIII.337 Each of the first prayers are prefaced with a name of god. Several of these, like Agla, El, and Elohim are standard Hebrew names of god used throughout the grimoire tradition, but others, like Heklaistai and Amphimaikon are obviously of Greek origin. Hedegård goes on to point out that some of the illustrations to be found in Juratus also occur in the Sepher   331 See Schäfer (1981), pp. 395, 732 for a list of the 72 names of Metatron, including ‘Itmon.’ This name is usually listed as the 13th, but in Sepher Ha-Heshek it is number 35. This particular form of Metatron is credited with skill in helping with journeys to ‘other places’ by which is meant hidden dimensions. 332 F. 66a. 333 See Figure 19. 3 Enoch lists Itmon as one of the names of Metatron. 334 In order to maintain the fiction that this manuscript was of solely Jewish origin, Gollancz resorts to an extraordinarily contorted and unbelievable explanation of the presence of the word ‘Tetragrammaton’ in transliteration. He suggests that the scribe must have been influenced by the Jewish pseudo-Messiah Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), to use the Greek version of hvhi. See Gollancz (1914), p. xxi. Zevi was a Rabbi who claimed to be the Jewish Messiah, but in the end converted to Islam, after leading his Jewish followers into the Ottoman Empire, where many also converted to Islam, and whose descendants still remain there. 335 Gollancz (1914), p. v. 336 Gollancz (1914), p. v – viii. 337 Hedegård (2002), p. 20."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 Maphteah Shelomoh.338 One is forced to conclude that, rather than being the source of the Latin and Italian versions of the Key of Solomon, the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh is in fact derived from them, which is quite the reverse of the usual assumption. The claim of a Hebrew origin seems to be simply a part of the pseudepigraphical attribution to Solomon, designed by the scribe to impress the reader with its authenticity. Although there is always a possibility that a Hebrew original of the Key might be found, this hope is not substantiated by the manuscripts of the Maphteah Shelomoh, despite Gollancz’s belief to the contrary. If there ever was a Hebrew original, then it is still lost. The Case for the Hebrew Roots of the Clavicula Salomonis It is common for Latin, French and English manuscripts of the Key of Solomon to claim Hebrew origins. Mathers’ introduction to his edition of the Key of Solomon notes that manuscripts of the AC Text-Group are in French and entitled: ‘The Key of Solomon King of the Hebrews, translated from the Hebrew language into Italian by Abraham Colorno, by the order of his most Serene Highness of Mantua; and recently put into French.339 Even the Lemegeton (‘Little Key of Solomon’), which is a completely different Solomonic grimoire, claims the same Jewish origin: These Bookes were first found in the Chaldean & hebrew (sic) tongues at Hierusalem [Jerusalem], by a Jewish Rabbi, & by him put into the greeke (sic) Language, & from thence into ye Latine, as it is said &c.340 The mention of a Greek intermediary copy is very interesting, as it suggests that the text was transmitted via Greek. It is an easy presumption that anything written by Solomon must originally have been written in Hebrew. It is tempting to take this statement at face value and give the Hygromanteia a Jewish origin. Indeed it may turn out that the Greek Hygromanteia had such a Hebrew ancestor, but at this point that is far from certain. Therefore let us now consider the case for the existence of one or more unknown Hebrew sources of the Key of Solomon. There are a number of manuscripts claiming to be translations of the Clavicula Salomonis from a Hebrew text apart from the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh. These range in date from 1580 to 1796: i) The translation by Abraham Colorno (circa 1580) into Italian for Vincenzo Gonzaga,   338 Of course a case could be made for a common ancestor for both Liber Juratus and the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh, but that seems unnecessary as Liber Juratus (c. 1225) is so much older than the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh (c. 1700). 339 Mathers (1909), p. vii. 340 Peterson (2001), p. 6."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 Duke of Mantua, (1562-1612).341 Colorno was a contemporary of Dee, who he might even have met at the court of Rudolph II.342 ii) Colorno’s translation of the Hebrew names in the Key of Solomon was criticised in a contemporary but undated letter written by “G. G. I. E. of Antwerp, Philosopher and Professor of Astrology.” This presupposes that this professor also had access to a Hebrew original in Antwerp. iii) A second translation into Latin was produced soon after also for Gonzaga, by someone whose initials were ‘F. L. C.’ (maybe another Colorno?).343 Gonzaga may have been unhappy with the first translation. iv) The translation into Latin by Rabbi Abognazar.344 The subsequent translation of this manuscript from Latin into French was executed by M. Barault, Archevêque d’Arles. There are records of a Jaubert de Barrault,345 Archbishop of Arles (from July 1630 - July 1643), suggesting a translation date of c.1640. At least one manuscript of this Text-Group is dated 1779.346 v) The translation into French by Pierre Morissoneau, which dates from 1796 or before.347 Two French manuscripts of the Key of Solomon dated 1796 purport on their title page to have been translated from Hebrew by Morissoneau ‘Professeur des Langues Orientales, et Sectateur de Sages Cabalistes.’348 Unfortunately no trace of either Professor Morissoneau or his Hebrew original has been found. In every case it has not been possible to identify the Hebrew originals, and so their existence remains unproven, but the repeated and detailed attributions in these vernacular manuscripts make it very likely that a Hebrew original did indeed exist. It is not clear where any such Hebrew original might fit into the line of transmission. There are three possibilities, in descending order of probability, none of which can be verified until such a Hebrew text is found: i) It could still have been derived from Latin grimoires (as in the case of the Maphteah Shelomoh), or   341 See Wellcome MS 4655, dated 1639 but claiming to be this original translation. 342 All of the large AC Text-Group Key of Solomon stem from this. 343 See Chatsworth MS 73D (16th century). Kirchenbibliotek Codex 31 is a later 18th century copy. 344 Lansdowne MS 1203 is the best example. The identity of this Rabbi has raised some speculation.

The Black-handled Knife One interesting implement in the Key of Solomon which has claims of origin from both Greek and Jewish sides, is the ritual knife, specifically the black-handled knife. Such a knife, with its handle made of a goat’s horn, has deep roots in Greek folk magic, but there is also an early usage of the black-handled knife in the sacrificial practices of Jewish religion. The most interesting similarity however is the use of the black-handled knife in the Hygromanteia to draw a circle around a skryer who anoints his thumb with oil in which to see the vision being conjured by the magician: Take a virgin boy [the skryer] and let it sit on a three legged stool. Tidy up your house, and let it be ready and clean. Trace the circle under [?around] the stool. Take a knife with a black handle, attached by three rivets, and thrust it into the circle.

Then ask the boy, and he will tell you what he sees.349 This unique combination of fingernail, oil and black-handled knife also features in Jewish evocatory skrying ritual, where the spirits thought to aid the process are referred to as the ‘princes of the thumb.’ This procedure is also described in an 11th century text by Rashi:350 He who is particular about the vessel (by means of which he divines), that he cannot do anything without the vessel that is required for that thing, as, for instance, the ‘princes of the thumb’, for which they require a knife, the handle of which is black.351 This technique of using a virgin boy to skry surrounded by a magic circle inscribed with a black-handled knife, whilst the magician evokes the spirits he wishes to communicate with, harks back to both Jewish practice and the practices of the PGM. However these evocatory skrying practices are the very ones which are not found in the Clavicula Salomonis, so this does not move forward the case for a Hebrew original of the Clavicula Salomonis. This leaves the god names, the 168 angel names, and the pentacles as the primary contribution of Jewish magic to the Clavicula Salomonis, but with the bulk of its content filtered through Greek intermediary sources. Skrying may have also been contributed to the Hygromanteia from Jewish sources, but this material did not pass onwards to the Clavicula Salomonis. With these many contributions of specific magical methods and equipment from Jewish sources, the balance of probabilities is that there was an as yet unknown Hebrew source which contributed some other material to both the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis.   349 B2, f. 346. 350 Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki (1040-1105), author of a well-known commentary on the Talmud. 351 His commentary on Sanhedrin 67b."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 3.4. Byzantine Solomonic Magical Texts “This man is a magician because by means of his magic he set demons before us.” - Martyrdom of Georgios.352 The Hygromanteia is perhaps the most complete Byzantine Solomonic text. Extant manuscripts of the Hygromanteia only date from 1440. Undoubtedly older manuscripts exist, and will hopefully turn up in libraries, possibly in Istanbul, Greece, Egypt, in due course. There have been a number of scholarly opinions concerning the dating of this text, some dating it to as early as the 1st/2nd century CE. Scott Carroll, predominantly using just manuscript M, concluded that the author was probably a late 2nd century CE Jew from Alexandria.353 Carroll’s reasoning supporting this date is that “the pseudepigraphical style of the epistle was popular among the Jews from circa 200 BCE to 200 CE.”354 Given that so many magic texts from a wide range of dates right up to the 19th century were pseudepigraphical, this is hardly surprising, and so does not provide any particular support for either the period, or the religion, of the author. I do however think it likely that the author was in fact from Alexandria, as demons such as Typhonbon,355 Sarapidie,356 Apios,357 Osthridie358 (which derive from the Graeco-Egyptian gods Typhon, Sarapis, Apis and Osiris), appear amongst the list of demons, but apparently no demons derived from the deities of other regions or countries. Sarapis is very specifically an Alexandrian god. Pharos,359 Agathoel360 and Orphor361 also appear, again confirming a very Alexandrian origin, demonstrating a possible connection back to the PGM. Sadly another suggestion by Carroll that the Solomonic text referred to in the Gnostic text On the Origin of the World was the Hygromanteia is also not viable,362 as that text instances 49 demons, whereas the Hygromanteia demonic hierarchy is resolutely a function of 168 (seven days x 24 hours) demons and angels, which leaves that line of reasoning also unavailable for date deduction.   352 As quoted by Ritner (2008), p. 14. 353 Carroll (1989), p. 95. 354 Carroll (1989), p. 93. 355 Attributed to Thursday the 1st hour, in manuscript A. 356 Tuesday 4th hour in B3. 357 Sunday 14th hour in four MSS. 358 Tuesday 11th hour in M. 359 Wednesday 22nd hour.

There is however no certainty that his ‘trajectory’ accurately traces the evolution of either the text, or of Solomon’s expanding reputation. His dating has also been made on the basis of the passage Solomon’s Epistle to his second son Rehoboam. That passage by itself might justifiably be dated to the same era as the Testament of Solomon, i.e. the 1st/2nd century CE. However mention of Solomon and the text of the Epistle is repeated at a number of junctures in the text, and it soon becomes clear that this passage is used as a sort of section divider rather than as an integral and useful part of his instruction in magic. It is therefore more likely to have been inserted at a much later date, by an editor attempting to firmly foist a famous name, in this case Solomon, onto his text. Carroll nevertheless concludes from this rather flimsy premise, that the latest probable date of composition was the end of the 2nd century CE.363 Far too much has been made of this repeated passage, to the point where some scholars have even attempted to use Epistle to Rehoboam as the title of the whole work.364 Torijano makes this point rather too strenuously in his analysis of the contents of M.365 He refers to the Epistle segment as “the pseudepigraphical unit: instructions of Solomon to his son Rehoboam.” 366 In the course of his one-page contents analysis he lists this passage as a chapter head no less than eight times, while the actual chapter heads and content (angels, demons, perfumes, times, etc) take a back seat, or are relegated by him to subsection status below that of the recurrent “pseudepigraphical unit” chapter head. It is, however, very clear that the “pseudepigraphical unit” is merely a section header and an attention-getter, and not the main thrust of the text. The ‘separateness’ of the “pseudepigraphical unit” is also reinforced by the inappropriate stress laid by it on the virtues “in herbs, in words and in stones...”367 Sections on herbs and stones, if they were present, have now been largely lost to the text. The section on herbs (chapters 17 and 18) has become peripheral at best,368 and no section on stones or beasts exists at all in any of the extant manuscripts. It is very clear therefore that “virtues in herbs, in words and in stones” does not adequately describe the current contents of any chapter of the Hygromanteia, and that therefore the “pseudepigraphical unit” is almost certainly grafted on by a later redactor,   363 Carroll (1989), p. 96. 364 I will address this issue at greater length later when considering the actual title of this work. 365 Torijano (2002), p. 164. 366 M, f. 240 as captioned on Torijano (2002), p. 164. 367 M, f. 240. 368 Chapter 17 only exists in one manuscript (M), and might therefore have been a later introduction."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 from some other source. As Swartz has remarked, such passages often do not accurately reflect the contents of the text in question, but act as an all-purpose flourish to be grafted on to a text as a formulaic introduction: A remarkable thing about these passages is how little they correspond to the contents of the books they introduce. Introductions and testimonies such as these are highly conventional and can serve any such text... Indeed, the introduction of Sifer ha-Razim, while clearly letting you know that you are getting a magical book, is not an accurate portrayal of its contents: [for example] No known recension of Sefer ha-Razim contains instructions for making an ark out of gopher-wood.369 Even if the “pseudepigraphical unit” dates from the 2nd century CE, its nature is one of an editor-introduced adornment and section header, rather than integral to the text, and so it is not at all a reliable guide to the dating of the whole work. Mastrocinque dates the Hygromanteia as early as the 1st/2nd century CE, and so contempor-aneous with the earliest Gnostic movements and many of the PGM: A very rich stream, especially as regards the demonic and natural magic based on the properties of substances and living beings, is found in the many apocryphal works of Solomon, particularly...in the Hygromanteia Salomonis or Letter from Solomon to [his son] Roboam [sic], a treatise on magic and astrology probably written between the first and early second centuries AD.370 I believe that Mastrocinque is following Carroll and makes the mistake of thinking of the Hygromanteia Salomonis as a text of Jewish extraction, simply because of the pseudo-epigraphical ascription to Solomon,371 when in fact the text and techniques are, as I shall demonstrate, firmly rooted in the Greek and Graeco-Egyptian tradition. The inclusion of ‘IAO Sabaoth’ and similar formula points merely to the early assimilation of these god names into the existing Graeco-Egyptian magical tradition (they occur frequently in the PGM), rather than indicating a direct lineage back to Jewish sources. To rephrase that, the occasional Hebraic god names are, I believe, an incidental inclusion rather than an indication of the rootstock of these magical practices. The magical techniques found in the Hygromanteia are more refined, integrated and detailed than those found in the PGM, and have lost much of their Egyptian character, suggesting a longer period of gestation. Mastrocinque’s dating therefore seems far too early. The Case for a 7th century Dating of the Hygromanteia There are however specific clues in the text itself.

Marathakis points out that the chief demon of Wednesday is listed in a number of manuscripts of the Hygromanteia as Loutzipher or Loutzēpher.377 This is clearly a transliteration of the Latin Lucifer. It seems very out of place for a Greek to use ‘Lucifer’ rather than Eōsphoros, which is how that name appears in the Septuagint. That suggests that this word was incorporated after the 405 CE completion of the Vulgate by St Jerome, who spent considerable time in Byzantine cities, including Constantinople, and who claimed to have superseded the Septuagint by returning to Hebrew sources. Such a claim may, for a short period in the 5th-6th centuries, have given Loutzipher a greater appeal and credibility amongst Greek readers than Eōsphoros.378 Although David Pingree characterises the text as a Jewish Kabbalistic text, he usefully suggests that the angels of the hours in the Hygromanteia may date from the Geonic period (589-1038 CE): The 5\u001e\t\u000b\f\u0010\f\u0014\u0004\u0002\u000bι\u000567\u001e\u0003\u0002\b\u0004\u0002\u000b\f\u0006\u0002 [the Hygromanteia] rather seems to represent a relatively late stage in the development of Jewish Kabbalistic angelology and demonology... One would guess that such elaborate lists of angels and demons belong to the so-called geonic period (seventh to eleventh centuries) rather than to any earlier time, so that the original version of the 5\u001e\t\u000b\f\u0010\f\u0014\u0004\u0002\u000bι\u000567\u001e\u0003\u0002\b\u0004\u0002\u000b\f\u0006\u0002 would have been contemporary with the majority of the pseudepigraphical magical texts written in Arabic in the Near East.379 I believe that Kabbalistic speculation had little to do with the Hygromanteia, or with the direct transmission of the techniques of Solomonic magic, as the Hygromanteia does not utilise any of the standard Kabbalistic cosmology (such as the Tree of Life), but from the time of the PGM, Jewish sources have provided many of the angel names, particularly those with the   372 Of course it is possible this numbering might have been introduced by a later redactor. 373 On this dating also see Ness (1999), p. 146. 374 Chapter 7: manuscripts H, A, P3, B; chapter 30: manuscripts H and P.

As a result of following up this clue, I would like to tentatively suggest a specific 7th century candidate for authorship of the Hygromanteia, Stephanos of Alexandria, whose claim will be considered in detail later in this chapter. Between 644 and 1172, I can find no trace of the Hygromanteia. Although the 12th century Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates380 mentions a Solomōnikē in the possession of the magician Isaac Aaron in Constantinople in 1172, there is no guarantee that it was this Solomōnikē.381 The Case for a 13th century Redaction of the Hygromanteia A number of clues point to the 13th century as a time of a major redaction of the Hygromanteia. One clue is that manuscripts M, N, B2 and V contain astrological material drawn from the works of Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-Zanātī, a North African author of geomancy texts who lived in the late 12th or early 13th century.382 As his works were only translated into Greek by the monk Arsenios in 1266 in Constantinople, this suggests a significant redaction of the Hygromanteia may have occurred in that city in the late 13th century. This does not yield us a totally reliable dating as the general astrological section (chapter 7) in which it occurs is not central to the method of the Hygromanteia, but may still be a good indication of a period of editorial activity. A further clue is to be found in the text. The method for determining the best times for betting on chariot races is mentioned in only one version of the Hygromanteia.383 As these races were discontinued in Constantinople in 1204, we might conjecture that this version of the Hygromanteia was assembled before that date, or maybe soon after.384 I surmise therefore that the text of the Hygromanteia dates from the late 6th/early 7th century and that it was substantially redacted in the late 13th century. Title Scholars have felt free to put forward a number of possible titles for this work, as there is no consistency of titling from one manuscript to another. The identification of the title is   380 Niketas Choniates (1155-1216) was the author of a Byzantine history, Historia Nicetae Choniatae. 381 Greenfield (1995), p. 130. 382 See Skinner, Geomancy, 2011, pp. 56-7, 63. 383 B, f. 2. 384 Rites for affecting the outcome of chariot races are however recorded in the PGM.

Possible titles which are found in one or other of the extant manuscripts (or in an academic comment thereon) include: Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia, Astrological Treatise, Clavicula Salomonis, Epistle of Solomon to his Son Rehoboam, Hygromanteia, Instruction of Solomon, Little Key of the Entire Art of Hygromanteia, Magic Treatise, Magical Treatise, Magical Treatise of Solomon, Magical Treatise of Gathering and Directing the Spirits, Pragmatic Treatise, Prayer and Conjurations of the Prophet Solomon against Demons, Solomōnikē, Traité de Magie, Treatise on Celestial Influences. Probably the earliest title used for this work was Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia,385 a title referred to by Pingree, which is also the title of a work credited to Stephanos of Alexandria. In fact, Ἀpotelesmatikē can be simply translated as ‘[astrological] results.’386 So Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia most simply means the ‘practical results of astrology.’ Indeed in one sense, magic is the practical application of astrology. However this title has a confusing history, having been applied to several different texts over the last 2000 years, and Ἀpotelesmatikē was a word which was sometimes just loosely applied to a book on astrology. Claudius Ptolemy, the Greek astrologer (c.90-168 CE), wrote a very popular astrological treatise called the Tetrabiblos (8\f\u000b\u0003!\u001dι\u001d\u0010\t\u0007, literally ‘The Four Books’) which was also sometimes referred to as the Ἀpotelesmatika, a title that was well known in the Middle Ages. It is therefore easy to see that any early reader coming across a manuscript entitled Ἀpotelesmatika might automatically assume it was by ‘Ptolemy the Greek.’387 That false   385 Marathakis suggests several translations of this phrase, including Pragmatic Treatise, Treatise on Celestial Influences, or the Astrological Treatise. 386 Liddell and Scott translate \u000b\u001b\u001e\u001f \u001b\u001e\t\u000b\f\u0010\f\u0014\u0004!\u000b\u0017\u0013 \u001e\u0003\t\u0003\u0003\u000e+\u0013\u000b\u0002 in an astrological context as the ‘result of certain positions of the stars on human destiny.’ 387 This knowledge is useful in another way, because it actually helps to solve a small mystery that has surrounded one of the often quoted authors of the Key of Solomon. That author is ‘Ioh Grecis’ or ‘Toz"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 ascription arose because both the Tetrabiblos and the Hygromanteia were referred to at one time or another as the Ἀpotelesmatika. I have shown that the “pseudepigraphical unit” is a grafted-on introduction with little relevance to the main text, so The Epistle of Solomon to his Son Rehoboam cannot ever have been the title of the whole work. Strangely, Torijano proposes that the Magical Treatise formed a sub-section of the Hygromanteia, whereas in fact the Hygromanteia section follows the Magical Treatise section.388 Torijano’s contention is not supported by the text which is very obviously a magical treatise, and not a work of water divination. From an analysis of the chapter contents it becomes apparent that it is only four chapters of the last section (chapters 49-52)389 which could reasonably be called a Hygromanteia, as it deals with four different methods of water skrying. In fact Hygromanteia is simply the last subsection of the whole work, and therefore cannot be the main title. It seems to me possible that at some point the manuscript had a list of contents at the beginning which might well have taken a form which reflects the current contents division, somewhat like this: Astrological considerations (chapters 2-10 and 30) Conjurations (chapters 11-13) Equipment (chapters 14-29) Evocation procedure – first method (chapters 31-39) Evocation procedure – second method (chapters 40-46) Hygromanteia (chapters 47-59) The loss of most of the first page (a common fate among unbound manuscripts) might serve to have destroyed most of the contents page leaving just ‘Hygromanteia’ as a residual entry. If this were so, then it might explain why the title of only the last section has been mistakenly applied to the beginning of the whole manuscript. Even translating 'hygromanteia' as ‘water divination’ is an oversimplification, for the practices referred to are clearly those of evocatory        Graecus.’ This name is currently incorrectly interpreted as the Greek Thoth. The fact that he is also sometimes referred to as ‘Ptolomaeus Graecus’ or ‘Ptolomeus ye Greacian’ (in Sloane MS 3847) gives us the clue. In due course Ptolomy Graecus degenerated to ‘Toz Grec,’ the ‘z’ replacing a Latin contraction mark for the last part of ‘Ptolemaeus.’ Then ‘Toz’ rendered back into Greek as \u000b\t9 might easily give rise to a misreading of ‘Ioh’ if the reader thought it was Latin. This is probably the source of ‘Ioh Grecis’ which often appears as an author in Key of Solomon manuscripts. Additional MS 10862 has ‘Ioe Grecis’ and Mathers mistakenly suggests ‘Iohé Grecis.’ Even more deformed are ‘Iroe Grecis’ and ‘Iroë Grego.’ Trithemius is also very uncertain of the name and variously transcribes it: Torzigeus, Totz Graecus, Tozigaeus and even Thoczgraecus. It is pretty clear that the author so referred to was Greek, which incidentally strengthens the case for the Greek roots of the Key of Solomon. I suggest that the identity of ‘Toz Grec’ or ‘Ioh Grecis,’ one of the supposed authors of the Clavicula Salomonis, was in fact Ptolemy the Greek astronomer. That false ascription arose because both the Tetrabiblos and the Hygromanteia were referred to in mediaeval times as the Ἀpotelesmatika. 388 See Torijano (2002), p. 211.

Marathakis proved grammatically that The Little Key390 of the entire Art of Hygromanteia is a later redaction.391 He suggests instead The Instruction of Solomon, but this phrase depends upon the Rehoboam passage, and does not occur in any position where it could be construed as a title. Delatte refers to the text in general terms as a Traité de Magie,392 and Greenfield and Torijano follow his lead with an English equivalent, the Magic Treatise and The Magical Treatise respectively. These generic titles are appropriate, but are still not the precise title by which the text would have been known by its author, owners or redactors. McCown astutely asserted that the Hygromanteia was a Greek form of the Clavicula Salomonis and therefore he refers to the Greek text by that same Latin title.393 This is confirmed in manuscripts D and M which give the title as the Little Key (or Clavicula in Latin) to the text, probably in the sense of an epitome or summary of maybe a larger work. Manuscripts D and M are amongst the least complete of all the manuscripts we have, but it is clear that the Latin translations subsequently made must have come from a manuscript bearing the same or similar title, as D and M. This further helps support the direct line of transmission of material from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis.394 But, having said that, the later Latin title (Clavicula) is not a correct or suitable title for the original Greek text. The title Solomōnikē has also been applied to this text, but this word is a generic description of Greek texts generally attributed to Solomon, rather than a discrete title in its own right. Only one manuscript, A2, has the title Prayer and Conjurations of the prophet Solomon against Demons. The fact that Solomon is characterised as a prophet rather than a king, and the conjurations are described as ‘prayers’ directed ‘against’ demons, strongly suggests a later Christian interpolation. Added to that, manuscript A2 is of relatively recent date (1833), very corrupt, and very short (only 11 folios), and therefore not a very reliable witness. All of which suggests that this title is not the original one. Finally, the most appropriate and the correct title for the whole text in its present form is imbedded, logically enough, in the incipit of the longest manuscript H,395 which reads ‘here begins The Magical Treatise of Gathering and Directing the Spirits.’ Indeed, the getting and   390 Or ’kleidon.’ 391 This is a tempting title as it looks forward to the English Key of Solomon. 392 Delatte (1927-39), p. 397. 393 McCown (1922), p. 14. 394 Mastrocinque refers to it using a Greek-Latin combination, Hygromanteia Salomonis. 395 As the incipit does not appear till the first line of folio 18v, just before the Epistle of Solomon to Rehoboam, it is understandable that scholars have overlooked it."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 directing of spirits is the main purpose of this and all subsequent grimoires.396 Despite the fact that the original title of the text was probably the Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia, the text in its present form should most properly be called The Magical Treatise of Gathering and Directing the Spirits, or Magical Treatise for short. I will however continue to refer to it as the Hygromanteia for reasons of historical consistency. As we have seen, this book contains a sub-section whose title, Hygromanteia, has mistakenly become the title for the whole work. Manuscripts There are 20 extant manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, of these H is the most complete. They are listed in full in the Bibliography, and in Appendix 3,397 which tabulates the 12 manuscripts most frequently utilised in the present thesis, with the whereabouts of their printed Greek transcriptions and partial English translations.398 The most complete manuscript with regard to the magical sections, and one of the oldest, is manuscript H in the British Library.399 This shows a quite detailed structure as laid out in Table 01. The view that the Hygromanteia is simply a floating compendium of techniques is only valid if there were no visible overall consistent sequential technique: in other words, if the text were simply a collection of separate recipes, as are many magic manuscripts. However this text is not a collection of variegated recipes. It has a very definite structure, divided into timing and astrological considerations; preparation of participants; consecration of equipment; two chronologically sequenced set of invocations and evocations; and finally a section on ritual skrying. The different versions of the manuscript have come about as the result of the loss/accretion of some of these parts around a core structure, due to scribal selection over time. The oldest manuscript of the Hygromanteia (B2: Bononiensis MS 3632 in the University Library of Bologna) dates from 1440. This manuscript is particularly beautiful, clear and perfectly preserved as part of a much larger collection deceptively bound up with the spine label of just one of its component texts, Dioscorides. Apart from making its location difficult, this is an example of how a collection of manuscripts, particularly a large one, can so easily end up with a title which only applies to part of the manuscripts bound together, giving rise   396 It is significant that H is the most complete manuscript as it contains more of the 59 chapters than any other manuscript of the Hygromanteia. At one point this manuscript must have ended after chapter 43, as the last line of this chapter (f. 37) is “The end of the Art of Directing the Demons,” confirming again the correct title. 397 Full bibliographic details of these manuscripts will be found in Marathakis (2011), pp. 18-32. 398 The remaining eight manuscripts have been omitted due to: their destruction by fire (T); inaccessibility (M4, P3, P4); irrelevance (M3, V2 and possibly A2); confused state and late 19th century date (B3). 399 Harley MS 5596.

Of the 20 extant manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, it is possible to identify the author or copyist in five cases, and locate the place of composition also in five cases (not always the same texts). Of the texts found bound with each manuscript, apart from general astrological texts, the most popular ‘ride along’ texts were the Testament of Solomon and the Book of Wisdom of Apollonius or \u001d\u0006\u001d\u0010\t\u0007 :\t\u0001\u0006\u0002\u0007, Biblos Sophias. The connection with the Testament of Solomon is significant because the Testament stresses Solomon’s role in evoking and binding demons, which is clearly what the Hygromanteia is primarily concerned with rather than water divination. There are also similarities in method between these two texts (for example the use of the thwarting angels method400) and they share a number of similar demon names (see Table 06).401 The other ‘ride along’ text, the Book of Wisdom of Apollonius, has been is dated by Dzielska to no earlier than the late 5th century.402 It is therefore contemporaneous with the Hygromanteia, if my estimated composition of the early 6th century turns out to be correct.403 The Term ‘Hygromanteia’ In this context, it is wrong to only translate ‘hygromanteia’ as ‘water divining’ despite the literal interpretation of its constituent syllables, as found in Liddell and Scott and other Greek dictionaries. In the mediaeval Greek context hygromanteia was always understood as a type of evocation or nigromancy. Later when ‘necromancy’ became confused with nigromancy, necromancy was also confused with hygromancy.404 When hygromantic texts first passed into Latin, the term was still understood correctly. Even considerably later in 1559, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum405 banned “Hydromán[tiae] vel Necromá[n]tiæ” demonstrating that even at that point the Inquisition thought that the two terms were more or less interchangeable. It was only scholars who, copying Isidore of Seville, in his quest for a neat fourfold symmetrical classification, decided that hydromancy must have formed one of the ‘four elemental forms of divination.’   400 See chapter 5.1.1. 401 The Book of Wisdom of Apollonius is related to the work on talismans by Belinus (the Arabic form of Apollonius’ name). 402 Dzielska (1986), pp. 32-38, 185. 403 I have not been able to check it, but this book may also be even more significant if its talismans are in some way connected with the later pentacles of the Clavicula Salomonis. 404 It is a great pity that nigromancy and necromancy became confused, as the latter might, with some benefit to clarity, have retained its restricted definition of evocation of the dead rather than evocation of spirits, as the prefix ‘necro-‘ clearly indicates. 405 Index Librorvm Prohibitorvm, Rome, 1559, issued by Pope Pius IV.

Greenfield, with whom I am otherwise in agreement over most things, suggests as a way of getting around this impasse, that originally the demon may have been evoked into a basin of water, and that this (central) instrument has then been dropped from the ritual.409 I find that a contrived and highly unlikely explanation. An alternative derivation of hygromancy proposed in my edition of the Key of Solomon410 is more all-embracing. The background is succinctly summarised by Marathakis: A third theory has been proposed by Skinner and Rankine. According to them, the word Hygromanteia does not mean water divination in this context, but applies to the ancient practice of constraining demons in hydriai, that is to say urns, water jars or metallic water vessels. This practice was frequently linked with Solomon, not only in the Testament, but also in the writings of the 4th century Byzantine historian Zosimus and in a 6th century account of Jerusalem recorded in the Breviarius de Hierosolyma. This is another plausible theory, since in some manuscripts an occult technique is cited with the aim of imprisoning spirits in bottles, and this technique is named Gasteromanteia, that is to say “bottle divination.”411 The use of the word Gasteromanteia to indicate the active imprisonment of spirits (with no hint of divination) in chapter 44 of the Hygromanteia, adds further weight to the widening of the range of meaning for –manteia beyond than that of simple divination. The word ’hydria’ in both Greek and Latin means an ‘urn’ or ‘water jar.’ The passage from the 6th century Breviarius de Hierosolyma412 mentioned above describes the instruments of spirit imprisonment which still existed at that time in the apse of the Martyrium of Constantine in Jerusalem: In circuitu duodecim columnae marmoreae (omnino incredibile), super ipsas columnas hydriae argenteae   406 See Skinner, Geomancy (2011). 407 This excludes New Age interpretations of pyromancy, which simply involve staring into a flame. 408 Johnston (2008), p. 148. 409 Greenfield (1988), p. 160. 410 Skinner and Rankine (2008). 411 Marathakis (2011), p. 35. 412 A traveller’s account of Jerusalem recorded in 530 CE in the Breviarius de Hierosolyma in Geyer, Itinera Hierosolymitana, Vienna, 1893."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 duodecim, ubi sigillavit Salomon daemones.413 The Latin text specifically refers to ‘hydriae argenteae’ or ‘silver water vessels’ not just ‘urns.’ Silver, like brass and electrum was credited with the property of being able to restrain spirits. The 4th century Byzantine historian, Zosimus, who lived in Constantinople, mentioned the tradition that urns containing demons were secreted below the platform of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. He states that the technique of imprisoning demons in hydriai used by Solomon was also known in Egypt: Among the Egyptians, there is a book called The Seven Heavens, attributed to Solomon, [and used] against the demons; but it is not correct (to say) that it is by Solomon, since these bottles had been brought at another time to our [Egyptian] priests; [as] that is what the language employed to denote them makes one suppose, because the expression ‘bottle of Solomon’ is a Hebrew expression. At any moment, the great [High] priest of Jerusalem gets them, according to the plain sense, from the lower abyss [below the Temple] of Jerusalem ...All or almost all agree concerning the function of the bottles [was] directed against the demons. The bottles acted [against demons] like the prayer and the nine letters [talismans] written by Solomon: the demons cannot withstand them.414 Zosimus415 goes on to explain the exact material used to make these urns or bottles: The seven bottles in which Solomon shut up the demons were made of electrum. It is necessary to believe, in this respect, the Jewish writings about the demons. The altered book that we possess and that is entitled The Seven Heavens contains the following... The angel ordered Solomon to make these bottles.... The wise Solomon knows how to summon the demons; he gives a formula of conjuration and mentions the electrum, that is, the bottles of electrum, on the surface of which he wrote this formula...416 The hydriai were also mentioned in a letter dated August 1507 from the Abbot Trithemius of Würzburg to his colleague Johann Virdung,417 a professor at the university of Heidelberg, and mathematician and court astrologer to the Elector Palatine.418 In it he comments on the various magical abilities of Georg Sabellicus, a magician who claimed to be the ‘second Faustus:’419 Magister Georgius Sabellicus, Faustus iunior, fons necromanticorum, astrologus, magus secundus, chiromanticus, agromanticus, pyromanticus, in hydr[i]a arte secundus.420 Although Trithemius was not at all supportive of Sabellicus, and thought him a rogue, he was happy to record Sabellicus’ claim that he was the fountainhead of knowledge about   413 “In a circle there are twelve columns made of marble (absolutely incredible), on top of the same columns there are twelve water vessels made of silver, where Solomon sealed the demons...” 414 Syriac Zosimus Book XII, quoted by Berthelot, in La Chimie, 2:264-265, quoted by Torijano (2002), p. 180. 415 Zosimus was a pagan Byzantine historian living in Constantinople (fl. 491-518). 416 Berthelot, La Chimie quoted by Torijano (2002), p. 183. 417 Virdung was a successful astrologer (1463-1538).

I propose, despite the modern literal dictionary meaning of –manteia, that hygromanteia (and hydromanteia)421 can also refer to an evocatory process, which at one point used hydriai, or silver/electrum water vases, as a spirit restraining mechanism. A confirmation that not only were the spirits restrained by ;'\u0003\u0006\u0002, hydria, but could also be released when the hydria were disturbed, is to be found in the Valentinian Gnostic Testimony of Truth:422 [Others] have [demons] dwelling with them [as did] David the king. He is the one who laid the foundation of Jerusalem; and his son Solomon, whom he begat in [adultery], is the one who built Jerusalem by means of the demons, because he received [power]. When he [had finished building, he imprisoned] the demons [in the temple]. He [placed them] into seven [waterpots. They remained] a long [time in] the [waterpots], abandoned [there]. When the Romans [went] up to [Jerusalem] they discovered [the] waterpots, [and immediately] the [demons] ran out of the waterpots as those who escape from prison. And the waterpots [remained] pure (thereafter). [And] since those days, [they423 dwell] with men who are [in] ignorance, and [they have remained upon] the earth.424 Admittedly some of Robinson’s bracketed reconstructions are debatable, but this is just one of several re-tellings of that particular incident. Another possibly 4th century source suggests that Solomon’s method of spirit entrapment involved the use of bronze jars, rather than silver/electrum: I adjure you, the 960 spirits of the evil one’s congregation, who swore to King Solomon, when he shut you up in the bronze jars by the archangel Gabriel, who has power over the evil... I adjure you by the 1999 names who swore to King Solomon; when we hear the name of the Lord Sabaoth, we will flee from those. Solomon, who received wisdom from God, shut them up in bronze jars and sealed them with the name of God.425 It is therefore not a big leap to associate the imprisoning of spirits using urns or bottles with the procedures outlined in the Hygromanteia.426 See chapter 5.3.2, Figure 31 and Figure 32 for details of how this practice evolved in the later Latin Solomonic grimoires.   421 Carroll’s suggestion that the difference between hydromancy and hygromancy may have been related to the amount of water used is quite extraordinary to say the least, as is his imaginative but quite unlikely description of the method of evocation using hygromancy: “The magician stirred water until a demon appeared on the water’s surface. The demon was then forced to work for the magician.” In the same passage, he also rather carelessly refers to Harleianus MS 5596 as ‘Codex Harleianus 556.’ See Carroll (1989), pp. 91-92, 100. 422 Dating from 140-180 CE. 423 The demons. 424 Testimony of Truth, 70 in Robinson (1990), p. 458.

It was amongst the well educated that the handbooks of magic were to be found. A small window on the owners of such manuscripts may be opened on the 14th century in Constantinople, which demonstrates not only the prevalence of handbooks on magic, but also that they were owned by pious monks, physicians and members of the higher echelons of society and the ruling classes. In 1370 a trial began in Sancta Sophia, before the Synod of Constantinople, of Theodosius Phoudoulis who was accused of practising magic, and of possessing ‘infamous books.’ The trial soon enveloped a large group of people, as the origin of these books unfolded. Phoudoulis confessed that he had received the books from Syropoulos who in turn had received them from one Gabrielopoulos, described later as “a pious monk” and in all probability also a doctor. It was in the home of the latter that a book by Kyranides,428 and “a booklet full of demonic invocations, spells and [demon] names” by Demetrius Chloros, a priest, physician and magician, was also found.429 Chloros was also a secretary to the Patriarch, and a person of no mean standing in the community, in fact all three seem to be typical practitioners of learned magic. Chloros initially tried to hide the magic behind legitimate medicine, but when the court read the texts concerned, they had no hesitation in convicting all three. A later hearing said of Chloros that he “did not profess the Christian faith, but the doctrines of the Hellenes [i.e. ancient pagan Greeks] and worshipped demons.” However the very mild punishment for Chloros was simply banishment to a monastery, which was not really a great hardship for an ex-priest. So it could be said that the attitude of the Church to learned ritual magic was not very stern in that period. It is likely that the popular view was even more relaxed.430 The stress in many of these trials was upon books, confirming that as practitioners of learned magic, the books of procedures and invocations, the grimoires, were most important. Any of the above named magicians might well have had their own copy of the Hygromanteia. Gabrielopoulos, for example: ...is said to have kept his books “like pearls” in safe-boxes (\u0014\f\u0013'\t\u000f\u0005\u0006\tι\u0007).

Pingree refers to the ‘Astrological School of John Abramios’ in one of his essays, thus pointing up Abramios’ importance to that discipline, and several of his manuscripts survive to the present day.432 Another later but important figure is Giorgios Midiates (fl. 1462) who copied a collection of magical material, including the important Testament of Solomon. He also actually wrote one of the manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, and so is very well qualified to comment on it.433 Choniates told the story of the magician Isaac Aaron in his history of the time of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel Comnenus (1118-1180).434 Aaron used a book allegedly by Solomon which had invocations which if read aloud “could cause legions of demons to appear,” in one case to drive out the occupants of a bath-house with whom he had a violent disagreement.435 Another story is told by Choniates about the magician Michael Sikidites436 who cast an enchantment over a boatman to the great amusement of his colleagues: Sikidites was an imperial secretary, and was standing with a group of people on a terrace of the Great [Topkapi] Palace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. He bet them that he could make the boatman stand up and smash all the tiles in his cargo; after they agreed, the boatman stood up and reduced the tiles to fragments with his oar, while the onlookers were helpless with laughter. He later said that he had seen a huge snake on the tiles, staring at him and menacing him with open jaws.437 It is tempting to suggest that this event may have happened on a Saturday morning in the third hour of Mars438 which is characterised by the Hygromanteia as an hour “for setting up a [Martial] enchantment.”439 Exact timing was one of the hallmarks of the Hygromanteia and indeed of all Solomonic ritual magic. Punishment for causing damage by magic was sometimes blinding, and that punishment apparently eventually overtook Sikidites, but for a different offence.440 So it would seem (from the instances on the previous page) that the civil authorities in this period treated magic much more harshly than the religious authorities, although maybe that latitude was only extended to priests and monks.   432 Examples of Abramios’ manuscripts survive as MS Marc. Gr. Cl. V. 13 (1221), dating from 1376, contains medical material, part of the Kyranides, and some Hermetic tracts (Ad Asclepium).

The presence of “Sabbath” instead of Saturday, and “preparation” for Friday, does suggest a Jewish scribe, as does the typical angel and demon names ending in -iel. The absence of ‘Jesus’ or any other clearly Christian references from the New Testament probably rules out a Christian author, despite Sunday being described as “the Lord’s Day,” as that label might have arisen from the work of a later Byzantine copyist. Any other Christian influences have only been added in much later, and in a rather awkward manner,441 making it certain that the author was not a Christian. From the naming of the weekdays, where Sunday is named Kyriakē (= the Lord’s day)442 but Saturday is called Sabbaton (= the Sabbath), and Friday is Paraskeuē (= the ‘Preparation’ for the Sabbath),443 it is not unreasonable to suggest that at least one owner was a Greek-speaking Jew, but this does not necessarily indicate a Jewish origin for the whole Hygromanteia, as these weekday names are still used by modern (Christian) Greeks today.444 Items such as the formula “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob” suggest a Jewish source, but seem to distance the speaker from that tradition. A Jew invoking his own god in this fashion seems like a Christian invoking Jesus as “the God of St Peter.” Although the author was not necessarily Jewish, he almost certainly lived in a Greek environment influenced by Judaism, such as Alexandria or Constantinople, and was Greek educated. I have no quarrel with the place of origin being Alexandria. Goodenough is of the opinion445 that the Hygromanteia is a Jewish adaptation of pagan material. This is certainly a possibility, and fits with my suggestion of a possible author.446 I would like to suggest a specific candidate for authorship: Stephanos of Alexandria (c. 581 – c. 641 CE), a Neoplatonist philosopher and scientist, probably born in Athens, but residing in Alexandria before migrating to Constantinople on the express invitation of the Emperor Heraclius. I realise this will be contentious, but my reasons are as follows:   441 See chapter 55 of the Hygromanteia: “Christ Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” 442 Suggesting a Christian scribe. 443 Suggesting a Jewish scribe. 444 As posited in Torijano (2002), p.166. 445 On the basis of the very limited manuscript M. 446 There were also Jewish magicians at the Byzantine court such as Isaac Aaron, and the Hygromanteia could well have been the work of one of them."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 1. Stephanos was an acknowledged expert in alchemy,447 astrology and ‘mathematics.’ The latter term was often a polite synonym for magic. 2. Stephanos moved from Alexandria to Constantinople in 617 CE, following precisely the path of the transmission of magical techniques which are here being established.448 3. The 11th/12th century Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos reported that Stephanos wrote an Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia.449 The Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia that he wrote has usually been identified by modern scholars as an astrological text with the same name as the text here under discussion, but relating to the horoscope of Islam.450 However, this modern identification is only tentative, and that specific Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia authored by Stephanos, might instead have been the present text under its original title. Several scholars have agreed that the Usener text451 referred to could not have been by Stephanos, as it shows a detailed knowledge of the course of Islam up until the end of the 8th century,452 and therefore must have been by a later author. 3. Abu Ma’shar listed in his 9th century catalogue of astrological books by Greek writers, an Ἀpotelesmatikē by Stephanos of Alexandria, which might have been simply a book on astrology, or may have been the present text under discussion. Therefore there is no compelling reason why the particular Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia mentioned by either Abu Ma’shar or Kedrenos as authored by Stephanos could not in fact have been the Hygromanteia under its earlier name. 5. The electional astrology chapters (7 and 30) in the Hygromanteia clearly derive from Hēliodōros. Olympiodorus is recorded as having specifically lectured on Hēliodōros, and Olympiodorus was known to have been Stephanos’ teacher. Therefore the inclusion of Hēliodōros’ material in the Hygromanteia is very suggestive.453   447 He was the author of On the Great and Sacred Art of Making Gold. See Papathanassiou (2006). 448 An interesting sidelight is that there was a proliferation of a large number of high quality magical amulets (in the form of bronze pendants and rings) mass produced in Constantinople in that century. After which, with the exception of womb amulets, there was never again such an upsurge in magical amulet production in the middle and late Byzantine periods. See Spier (2006), p. 31. 449 See Usener (1914), pp. 266–289. 450 The interrogation concerning Muhammad and the subsequent career of Islam mentioned in Vaticanus Gr. 1056 is falsely attributed to Stephanos, and therefore the dating derived from this incident is also incorrect. See Pingree (1989), p. 236. 451 Usener (1914), pp. 247-322. 452 A counter argument to that suggests that the later 8th century events were interpolated by an editor living a century after Stephanos, but that is unlikely. 453 See chapters 7, 30 and 58."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 6. Stephanos’ imperial patron and friend, the Emperor Heraclius (r. 610-641), was well known to be intensely interested in alchemy, astrology and magic.454 Stephanos relocated from Alexandria to Constantinople at the bidding of this Emperor, and would have been expected to bring such texts with him. Heraclius was eager to promote classical Greek learning, and rather like Rudolph II of Bohemia, acted as a patron for magicians, astrologers and alchemists: From the seventh century onwards, alchemy seems to have been perfectly well integrated into the official learning, judging by the vogue it apparently enjoyed under Heraclius.455 Stephanos is known to have written an alchemical work.456 7. Stephanos was a Neoplatonic Greek, which fits well with the absence of explicit Christian references, and his usage of the Greek gods to designate the days of the week in the Hygromanteia. 8. Stephanos was very familiar with katarchic astrology, and lectured on Ptolemy’s Handy Tables. This agrees with the great stress laid upon the importance of selecting the correct hour and day for specific magical operations in the Hygromanteia (also in the PGM). 9. In Constantinople, Stephanos is reported to have taught the quadrivium, as well as giving astrological advice to the Emperor.457 Westerink458 maintains that in the 6th century astrology was still an important part of the quadrivium, and Alexandria was still seen as the fountainhead of all astrological and magical knowledge. There has been some reluctance to accept that Stephanos was the author of even an alchemic treatise, and therefore there will undoubtedly be even more reluctance to accept his possible authorship of the Hygromanteia. Papathanassiou sums up the reluctance of scholars to accept that well known philosophers of the ancient world could ever have been interested in subjects like magic, alchemy or astrology: The hesitation of modern scholars to accept Stephanos’ alchemical and astrological activities as an integral part of his scholarly profile is not rooted in a proper grasp of seventh-century reality; rather, it is the result of anachronistically applying modern criteria in order to understand the organisation and transmission of knowledge during a much earlier and very   454 He took astrology very seriously, as he even filled in a very large water cistern near his palace to circumvent Stephanos’ prediction that he would die from drowning.

Pingree argued that the author of the Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia (if it was not Stephanos) was at least very well informed about Stephanos’ work on Ptolemy’s Handy Tables, while Papathanassiou argues that at least the introduction of one Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia goes back to a genuine work by Stephanos. I therefore suggest that the Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia by Stephanos might have been either an early version or a forerunner of the Hygromanteia, and that this particular Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia was not the one with the Islamic horoscope translated by Usener.460 I would be happy to have this attribution refuted, but only if a better candidate for the authorship of the Hygromanteia can be discovered. Analysis of the Contents of the Hygromanteia Just as the PGM has been analysed in terms of its contents, so it is necessary to analyse the exact magical techniques that make up the Hygromanteia, before looking at its place in the transmission of learned Solomonic magic. Torijano provides a detailed breakdown of the constituent parts of just one manuscript of the Hygromanteia.461 In doing so he emphasises what he calls “the pseudepigraphical unit” which recounts the alleged conversation between Solomon and his son Rehoboam. This passage recurs no less than eight times, like a refrain, and is used like a chorus or section divider. As already suggested, this repeated emphasis looks very like a later introduction, added to justify the antiquity and its putative Jewish Solomonic roots.462 It has also acted as justification for some scholars attempting the unlikely task of including this magical text amongst collections of Old Testament pseudepigraphical scriptures, by using the title Epistle to Rehoboam.463 Early Structure of the Hygromanteia Although it would seem more logical to associate the chapters (17 and 18) on planetary and   459 Papathanassiou (2006), p. 202. 460 Usener (1914), pp. 247-322. 461 Torijano (2002), pp. 164, 210-211. The manuscript he uses to derive this division is M. His description of the divisions is strangely set out on two widely separated pages, using two different numbering schemes. Compare p. 164 with p. 210-211. These two partial lists intersect in a very unsatisfactory manner. 462 In fact if this is removed there is little of a Jewish nature in the Hygromanteia. 463 For example see Carroll (1989)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 zodiacal herbs with works on astral magic or herbalism, I believe that these sections had and still have a place in the Hygromanteia. In the introductory passages, Solomon exhorts his son Rehoboam to pay attention to the details of the art. Solomon adds that the virtue of things resides “in herbs, in words and in stones.”464 Apart from words (invocations) and two small chapters on the plants of the planets and of the zodiac, there is no material in the Hygromanteia on stones. I hypothesise that the earlier texts of the Hygromanteia would have had a chapter on stones, which has subsequently been extracted and recycled as a separate lapidary.465 The reference to virtues to be found “in herbs, in words and in stones” occurs however in a number of other later works on magic such as the Latin Sepher Raziel.466 In Raziel these are catered for in some detail in the seven separate treatises that make up that grimoire. Correspondences have always been an important part of magic. I think it is possible that the Hygromanteia may have had extensive sections on the planetary and zodiacal correspondences of plants, animals and stones, most of which have been split off over time from the text of the grimoire into separate herbals, bestiaries and lapidaria. This is a natural occurrence, given that the evocatory content is likely to have been at some stage separated from the apparently more acceptable ‘natural magic’ of the herbals, bestiaries and lapidaria.467 Much of the latter material is likely to have finished up in the books of pseudo-Albertus Magnus,468 or similar authors, which still retain some magical content, but at the recipe level of a ‘Book of Secrets.’ The Latin Sepher Raziel469 is one of the few grimoires to keep all seven divisions of magic, natural and ritual, under one head. In the opening chapter of the Raziel there are repeated warnings against splitting up the book, a process which may well have happened to the Hygromanteia, and perhaps many other grimoires. The fact that this warning is repeatedly given suggests that the editor might have been aware of such splitting up of other grimoires by his editorial contemporaries: And then I begun to write all these Treatises in a new volume, for [just] one Treatise without   464 M, f. 240. 465 Marathakis (2011) approaches this dilemma from a different perspective and suggests (p. 34) that “this part of the introduction initially belonged to an unknown herbarium and lapidarium.” In an oblique way, we are both saying the same thing: either the herbarium and lapidarium got detached, or the introduction got detached. 466 See Karr and Skinner (2010), p. 146, where the sections on herbs, stones, and animals are repeatedly stressed as being integral to the magical method laid out there. Obviously the third category, ‘words,’ has always formed part of the magical method. 467 In fact the concept of ‘natural magic’ may simply have been a reaction to the church’s blanket condemnation of magic, in an effort to separate out the acceptable parts of the subject. 468 See Best (1973). 469 Sloane MS 3846; Sloane MS 3826, both dated 1564.

Clarifaton470 said that it ought to be but one book alone by itself, for none of these [Treatises], said he, would suffice without the others, therefore he said it is necessary that they are all [kept] together. Whereupon Solomon ordained that all the said 7 Treatises were but one book, as they ought to be, and so they ought to be read and wrought.471 This suggests that maybe other early grimoires had separate sections on herbs, stones and beasts, as well as the more usual sections on ritual times, incenses, circle designs and angel and spirit names. It is useful to examine how the Raziel is divided, as a clue as to how the Hygromanteia may have originally been structured. Its Seven Treatises are: 1. Liber Clavis, the Book of the Key of Astronomy 2. Liber Ala, the Virtues of some Stones, Herbs, Beasts and Words 3. Tractatus Thymiamatus, of suffumigations or incense 4. Treatise of Times of the day and night 5. Treatise of Purity and Abstinence 6. Samaim, the Names of the heavens and their angels 7. Book of Virtues and Miracles for specific magical operations. The Hygromanteia is divided into nine sections: “Instructions of the nine books of Solomon, concerning the gathering of the aerial spirits face to face...”472 If its sections are rearranged slightly it divides into nine similarly structured parts which conveniently parallel the Raziel:473 1. Key Astrological background to the magic (chapters 2, 4-10, 30)474 2. Virtues and correspondences of plants, characters (chapters 15-18) 3. Planetary incenses, characters and seals (chapter 14) 4. Times – angels/demons of the hours and days (chapters 11, 13) 5. Ritual procedure, purity and abstinence (chapters 31, 40) 6. Conjurations & prayers to planets, angels, spirits (chapters 3, 37, 42, 43) 7. Specific objective evocation methods (chapters 38-9, 44-46, 58-9) 8. The equipment and materia of Solomonic magic (chapters 19-29, 32-36, 41).475 9. Skrying methods (lekanomanteia, hygromanteia, etc.) (chapters 47-57) The last two sections are given in much greater detail in the Hygromanteia than the Raziel.

Every grimoire will, however, usually have one or more of these sections missing. In the case of the Hygromanteia it is the stones, herbs (partially) and beasts that may be missing. Another reason for suspecting the early presence of sections like this is the fact that the earliest manuscript of the Hygromanteia (B2) dated 1440 was very firmly bound up with several such lapidaries written in the same hand. In fact, the binding of this particular manuscript of the Hygromanteia bears a single word on its spine label ‘Damigeron,’ who was the author of a famous lapidary de Virtutibis Lapidum. The presence of lapidaries and herbals bound up in the same volume might have simply been an accident of scriptorium choice, or binder convenience, and so is not of course conclusive, but goes some way to supporting the conjecture that the Hygromanteia may originally have had a more extensive herbal section, plus its own chapter on stones, and maybe one on beasts. The presence of full-blown herbaria and lapidaria bound in the same manuscript volume as the earliest known Hygromanteia, and their continuing presence in the Raziel, suggests that it was the herbaria, bestiaries and lapidaria that got detached. Analysis of the Structure of the Hygromanteia The breakdown of the Hygromanteia into 59 chapters naturally follows the subheadings already extant in the various manuscripts, plus a few very obvious breaks at change of topic. By comparison, Torijano’s chapter breakdown is very forced,476 which aims to make a major feature out of the recurrence of that one small Rehoboam passage, which he portrays as the main chapter heading for each and every one of his sections 1-7.477 The following table shows the structure of the contents of the Hygromanteia, and the disposition of each chapter in the various manuscripts.478 The chapter numbers do not occur in the manuscripts but are imposed in order to correlate the 17 manuscripts examined. As can be seen from this table, no single manuscript has a complete set of all chapters. The tally of chapters (in the second line of the table) is useful as an indication of the relative completeness of each manuscript. It can be seen that H is the most complete manuscript, and D and T the least.   476 Torijano (2002), pp. 164, 211. Although separated by 47 pages, these two lists should have been merged by Torijano to give a full list of sections. 477 Torijano’s sections 1-8A listed on his page 164 correspond to the small subset of chapters 1-18 which occur in M, which omits a number of chapters (4-10, 12, 14, and 15). Quite separately Torijano lists a separate run of sections from (1) to (13) C and 7A-C listed on his page 211, without clarifying that these sections are in fact an expansion of section 6A in his first series, but this time taken from a different manuscript H. It is for this reason that I will not be following his very confused numbering system, which only covers part of the Hygromanteia anyway. 478 Based on Marathakis (2011), pp. 362-365."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 Manuscript \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001 H B A P B3 G P4 B2 P2 P3 M V M2 N A2 D T Tally of Chapters found in each MS \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001 41 34 30 28 22 17 13 12 8 8 8 6 5 5 3 2 2 Date of MS (c=century) 15c early 18c 16c- 19c 1462 end 19c 16c- 18c 18c 1440 1684 17c 16c 15c/ 16c 16c 1495 1833 16c 15c- 16c 1.

Translating manteia as ‘divination,’ a term which encompasses tarot, runes, geomancy, lots, astrology, etc., is misleading for this very specific procedure, even if it is superficially a literal translation. 485 The ‘chapter’ numbers in the first column follow the divisions used by Marathakis (2011), pp. 362-365.

Hence a composite of H, A and B2 would probably provide the best reconstruction of the full text of the Hygromanteia, for comparative purposes, based on currently identified manuscripts. These three manuscripts are respectively the oldest extant, B2 (1440); the one which includes the most extensive range of chapters, H (15th century); and the one with the longest continuous history of use and annotation, A (16th-18th century). Out of the 59 possible chapters, only three chapters would have been omitted from such a three manuscript composite reconstruction. These are relatively minor: Chapter 12: ‘Prayer to Almighty God’ which is almost certainly a later Christian addition. Chapter 17: ‘Zodiacal Herbs.’ Although I believe this was integral, Marathakis suggests that both this and ‘Planetary Herbs’ are not a main part of the Hygromanteia. Certainly these chapters did not travel with the rest of the Key of Solomon when it arrived in Latin Europe. Chapter 50: This chapter is an alternative version of chapter 49, and is therefore not essential. The distribution of these chapters amongst the 17 manuscripts is shown in Table 01.   486 There are 20 known manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, but only 17 are shown: P4 and M4 are not tabulated as they were not available for examination.

The Clavicula Salomonis The Transmission of Byzantine Greek texts to the Latin West As has been very succinctly pointed out by Charles Burnett, there were two routes by which the classics of the ancient world reached the Latin West during the 10th and later centuries. The most commonly accepted route is the translation of Arabic texts of Greek classics, by translators working in: Catalonia in the late tenth century, through Northeast Spain and Southern France in the early twelfth century, to Toledo from the mid twelfth to the early thirteenth century.487 It is via this route that texts such as the Picatrix488 and associated magic and astrological texts reached Western Europe. In fact Toledo and Salamanca universities were famous for their teaching of astrology and (in the case of Toledo) magic. Pingree has documented the transmission of many of these texts.489 However it is not that route, which was the line of transmission for a large amount of the astrology, geomancy and astral magic, which concerns us here. We are more properly concerned with the rather neglected direct transmission of Greek texts to Latin via traffic between Byzantine Constantinople and Venice, as well as those parts of southern Italy which from time to time came directly under the rule of Byzantium.490 Early transmissions Although an extra impetus was added to this transmission by the attack on Constantinople in 1422,491 and the final sacking of Constantinople in 1453, a cultural transmission of magical and astrological knowledge had been ongoing for some time before then. It is worth rapidly summarising the most important magical and astrological texts that were transmitted via this route from Greek to Latin from Antiquity to the late Middle Ages.492 The earliest translations included: 493 The Hermetic Asclepius and Liber de Physiognomia (late 4th century); Damigeron/Evax’s De Lapidibus et eorum virtutibus concerning the magical correspondences of precious and semi-precious stones (5th century); De Plantis duodecim signis et septem planetis subiectis on the correspondences of plants to the 12 signs of the zodiac and seven planets (late 5th/early 6th century); Ptolemy’s Preceptum Canonis Ptolomei, an early ephemeris; Aratus’s Phaenomena on the constellations (early 8th century);   487 Burnett (2006), p. 325. 488 First translated into Latin in 1256, from a Spanish translation of an Arabic original. 489 Pingree (1987). 490 This route also encompassed Arabic texts that had been translated into Greek. 491 By Mehmet II. 492 I am indebted to Burnett (2006), pp. 327-331 for much of the following list. 493 Conjectural and approximate dates only in brackets."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Pascalis’s Liber Thesauri Occulti on dreams (1165); Kyranides, a classic of the correspondences of astral magic (1169); Oneirocriticon on dreams (1176); Aristotle’s Works (mid/late 13th century); Abū Ma’shar’s astrological works (c. 1260); Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, a classic of astrology (before 1281); Liber de triginta sex decanis, on the 36 Decans, attributed to ‘Hermes’ (before 1430); It can be seen that the first strand of magic to reach the Latin West was astral magic, which relied upon the astrological correspondences of stones, plants and beasts, rather than ritual magic. Many of these texts were concerned with the creation of talismans according to the position of the Moon in its 28 Mansions, material that forms a much more important part of astral magic than it does of ritual magic.494 Some of this material does occur in the Hygromanteia (chapters 30 and 6-7) but it does not form the core of that text. Lapidaria, Herbaria and Bestiaries Although stones, plants and beasts are predominately of interest to texts of astral magic, there is some slight overlap with ritual magic. Predating the extant manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, and the Latin texts of the Clavicula Salomonis is the Salomonis Libri de Gemmis et Daemonibus (‘Books of Solomon of Gems and Demons’) which was referred to by the 12th century Greek historian Michael Glycas. Michael Psellus (1018-1081) also spoke in the 11th century of what was probably the same treatise, said to be composed by Solomon, “on stones and demons.” It is conceivable that this book may have at one point formed an integral part of the Hygromanteia, for the reasons outlined below. The question arises as to how material from lapidaria, herbaria and bestiaries might be of use to ritual magic. Iamblichus explains: ...in accordance with the properties of each of the gods, [and] the receptacles adapted to them, the theurgic art in many cases links together stones, plants, animals, aromatic substances, and other such things that are sacred, perfect and godlike, and then from all these composes an integrated and pure receptacle [for the gods].495 A more detailed answer may be found in a passage from Synesius (c.373-c.414 CE), a disciple of Hypatia and an enthusiastic Neoplatonist living in Alexandria:496 Even to some god, of those who dwell within the universe, a stone from hence and a [corresponding] herb is a befitting offering, for in sympathising497 with these he is yielding to [their] nature and is bewitched.498 Or to rephrase it, stones and herbs can be used as offerings to gods in order to ensnare them   494 The Moon is obviously of concern to many forms of magic, and the inclusion of a few lunarium tables in the Hygromanteia does not constitute a blurring of the line between astral magic and ritual magic. 495 Iamblichus (2003), V. 23, p. 269. 496 He finished up becoming a bishop, but retained sympathy for the Neoplatonic outlook. 497 Being in sympathetic connection. 498 Fitzgerald (1930), pp. 328-329."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 with magic. An even more revealing commentary on this by Nikephoros Gregoras (c. 538 CE) gives the Byzantine view of the functions of “stones, plants, beasts and words:” ...what is even more amazing is that demons from the air and from the land are charmed by certain stones, certain plants, certain speech, or certain designs which are called characteres (\u0015\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0005\u000b?\u0003\u0002\u0007), and which, I think, were first discovered by the Chaldeans and Egyptians, each sign capable of making each demon known.499 Here, in a few words, is precisely the reason why the grimoires had supplementary chapters or even full treatises on “stones, plants, beasts, and words.” According to this view, the demons are ‘charmed’ or constrained by certain stones, plants, animals, words and written characters. The appropriate set of stones, plants and animals (corresponding to the nature of the demon) would have been offered to him, in order to ‘charm’ him, or make him amenable to the magician. This adequately explains why such material is still part of some grimoires (for example the Latin Raziel), and confirms that the planetary and zodiacal plant attributions do have a rightful place in the grimoires, and in the Hygromanteia. A number of commentators, like Torijano and Marathakis, consider the sections on plants to be extraneous, when in fact they were probably an integral part in earlier times. In all likelihood, details of stones, plants and maybe beasts have been separated out from many grimoires, and partly from the Hygromanteia, at an early stage. The Rehoboam pseudepigraphical section of the text refers to the importance laid by Solomon on the virtues “in herbs, in words and in stones,”500 supporting the idea that these sections might at one time have been an integral part. Most importantly it shows clearly that these natural correspondences were adjuncts to ritual procedures which came from Egypt contemporaneously with the texts of the PGM. The transmission of these “stones, plants, beasts, and words” from Egypt to Byzantium, would in due course have fallen under the intellectual dominance of Aristotle’s works, which would have encouraged the separation of the lapidaria, herbaria and bestiaries rather than their continued integration in the Hygromanteia. Although the use of stones and plants has some affinity with astral magic,501 the procedures are completely different, one the drawing and exposure of a talisman, the other the calling of a demon, but the principle of sympathetic bonds occurs in both disciplines. The Link from Greek Byzantine Magic to the Latin World The sack of Constantinople in 1453 (and the earlier attack by Mehmet II in 1422) proved to be the catalysts which accelerated the migration of the culture of the Hellenic world to the Latin   499 Gregoras' commentary on Synesios of Cyrene’s De Insomniis, in Migne (1857-66), c. 538. 500 M, f. 240. 501 Vide the Kyranides."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 West. Ever since the Roman Empire had been voluntarily split into East and West in 286 CE, the two halves had drifted apart, a movement which was accentuated by the language split of Greek in the East (the Levant, Palestine, Asia Minor, Syria, Greece itself and Egypt) and Latin in the West (Italy502 and the rest of Europe). There were also doctrinal differences which helped to accentuate this split, mainly centring on the doctrines of the Trinity and the true nature of Christ’s divinity. Greek remained the dominant language in the Byzantine Empire for almost 1000 years from the dissolution of the Roman Empire in 476 till the sack of Constantinople in 1453, but in the Western Empire the knowledge of Greek had somewhat diminished. Although there was transmission of texts such as the Hygromanteia before this date, the sheer quantity of manuscripts and scholars that moved westwards in the months immediately after 1453 was what gave Western Europe fresh impetus to read Greek, and probably also Hebrew, skills that had been in short supply before then. Of course both languages were fundamental to any serious understanding of Christianity, Hebrew (and Aramaic) for the Old Testament, and Koine Greek for the New Testament. Scholars fleeing from the Ottoman Turks took with them whatever bits of Hellenic culture they could take. These included a lot of Classical Greek writers, early Christian material and translations of scientific and philosophical Arabic texts into Greek. The subsequent translation of Classical texts into Latin by such luminaries as Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499) helped fire the intellectual explosion of the Renaissance and the culture of Humanism. Cardinal Bessarion summed up the feelings of the time during which many scholars, particularly those who had to flee so peremptorily from Constantinople, strove to preserve Greek learning: Although I was devoted to this cause [the preservation of ancient books] with all my soul, yet after the destruction of Greece and the lamentable captivity of Byzantium I used with even more zeal all my powers, all my care and effort, capital and industry, to search for Greek books. For I was fearful and very anxious of the thought that along with the rest of the things, many excellent books, being the sweat and wakeful hours of so many eminent men, would vanish and perish like so many sources of light, and be lost to the world within the shortest of times.503 Bessarion’s library, which survives as the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana (the National Library of St Mark) in Venice preserves, as a result of the efforts of the good Cardinal, a number of Greek manuscripts relating to magic.504 At the same time the appearance of the Greek Corpus Hermeticum in the West opened up a   502 Parts of southern Italy were at various times under the Byzantine Empire, and therefore Greek speaking.

The impact on magic was no less great, as Greek Solomonic texts were rapidly translated into Latin, forming the basis of later Solomonic grimoires. Although it has been fashionable to decry the attribution of ancient names like Moses and Solomon to magical texts, in fact these texts had often carried the names of these same ancient authors for a long time, and kept these attributions as they crossed cultural and linguistic boundaries. In 1240 William of Auvergne,505 in De Legibus, listed a number of Solomonic grimoires, which were extant in his time, but none of these included more than a small part of the Solomonic method. For example Quatuor Annulis Salomonis included four rings, or Liber Salomonis de Novem Candariis,506 included just nine talismans. William also twice mentioned “that book which is called Liber Sacratus,”507 which is composed largely of prayers and only contains part of the Solomonic dynamic of demon/spirit binding from within a protective circle. He also mentions the Amandal (sic),508 which is a book of four angelic invocations performed on an elevated wax altar, which is quite different from the Solomonic method of magic. Although these grimoires (and others which were extant in the period before 1453) do have mentions of Solomon, they do not contain the full evocationary Solomonic method. Of the extant manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis, the oldest dates from 1446,509 so it seems likely that the Hygromanteia reached the Latin world after 1422 and before the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The first port of call of these fleeing scholars was often Venice, which not only had good sea connections with Constantinople, but was also famed for its independence and consequent   505 The Bishop of Paris (1190-1249). 506 Candariis definitely means ‘talismans’ not ‘candles’ as some authors have mistakenly translated it.

On the basis of that mention by William, I believe, with Mathiesen, that this grimoire pre-dates 1240. The name of the author ‘Honorius of Thebes’ even appears to be a deliberate contrapositional pun on the name of the then ruling Pope Honorius III (r. 1216-1227). It is not relevant that a completely different grimoire was much later falsely attributed to Pope Honorius III, but it highlights the motivation of grimoire authors (for whatever reason) to mock that particular Pope. 508 Almadel. This title, which is variously spelled, probably derives from the Arabic for a circle, al-Madel. The best known version of this grimoire forms the fourth (and shortest) treatise in the Lemegeton.

As already noted (in chapter 3.3), Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, (1562-1612) was known to have possessed copies of the Clavicula Salomonis, and twice commissioned translations into Italian.512 It is of course quite possible that the earliest manuscripts of the Hygromanteia reached Italy via other routes, such as the more southerly ports of Langobardia (the southern tip of Italy), Bari, Brindisi or Tarentum, which were earlier under Byzantine control. The names of five authors or scribes of the extant manuscripts are known to us. Of these the names of the authors of the three earliest authors are extant. These names together with date and geographical location where the manuscript was written might provide some clues. MS Date Author/scribe Location B2 1440 Iōannēs Aron Grottaferrata monastery, near Frascati, Italy P 1462 Geōrgios Meidiatēs Trescore Balneario, Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy N 1495 Iōannēs Xērokaltos - P2 1684/85 Kyrillos Korydalleus Moscow, later Kazan A2 1833 Iōannēs Papatheodōridēs Mauratzaioi on Samos, Greece Clearly all the names are Greek with the possible exception of the first who might have had Jewish roots.513 The third manuscript (N) has no indication of location, and the last two are too late to be relevant. That leaves the first two manuscripts which are similar in the sequence of their contents and were both copied at northern Italian locations. There is at present no conclusive evidence which would enable one to settle upon any one particular route with certainty, but there is one small hint in the oldest manuscript of the Hygromanteia (B2) written by Iōannēs Aron which might indicate a possible route of transmission to Italy through southern Greece. This suggestive but inconclusive reference is the mention of the city of Lakedaimon, the ancient capital of Sparta in this manuscript:514 O Lady, queen Sympilia, my magister commands you to send your servant to Solomon the king at Lakedaimonia, in order to give him the talisman that is nailed by steel and sealed with the   510 Venice was a city state ruled by a Doge who did not see himself beholden to any other ruler. Venice also had a considerable and effective navy. In fact the military docks in Venice devised an amazing production line system which enabled them, in times of war, to complete one war galley every day. 511 To quote Cardinal Bessarion: “Venice was thus becoming more and more like ‘a second Byzantium.’” Zorzi (2002), p. 130. 512 These were translations from Hebrew, which suggests either a Hebrew intermediary, or a whole different line of transmission which was examined in chapter 3.3. 513 There is a possibility that Iōannēs Aron may have been Iōannēs from Aron, near Venice. 514 Lakedaimona is another name for the city-state of Sparta."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 trigram. Let him bring it here, in order for our lords to take an oath faithfully and truly, that they will tell me [the magician] the truth in whatever I may ask them.515 Solomon was obviously not the king of Lakedaimon or Sparta,516 but if the ancient Jewish king had been ‘transplanted’ to a more convenient location than Jerusalem by a scribe who might have been uncertain of the exact location of Jerusalem, that might indicate that this particular manuscript, written in 1440, had a line of transmission which passed to Italy via Lakedaimonia/Sparta, rather than directly by ship to Venice. It is known that the author of the manuscript Iōannēs of Aron lived in Italy, probably in the still existing Byzantine monastery of Grottaferrata.517 If one pursues this reasoning, then one possible conjectural line of transmission might be: 1422 – Mehmet II attacks Constantinople causing a number of monks to flee. – one monk settles in Sparta, sees the ruins of Lakedaimon, and grafts it into his copy of the Hygromanteia as the ‘city of Solomon.’ 1440 – Iōannēs of Aron transcribes this copy of the Hygromanteia at the monastery of Grottaferrata, perpetuating the reference to Lakedaimon.518 1466 – The earliest known manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis translated into Italian.519 Obviously this argument is still very speculative, but the proximity of the dates and geography is suggestive. Pingree states that the Hygromanteia was “rewritten in South Italy.”520 Whichever route was used, the process of translating the Hygromanteia into what was to become the Clavicula Salomonis was begun in Italy. This earliest manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis in Italian (1466) probably pre-dates the earliest known Latin manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis,521 which is dated towards the end of the 15th century. Elsewhere in Italy the process of translating Greek texts into Latin was going on at the same time. In Florence, Ficino (1433-1499) was the scholar who translated much of Plato and the Corpus Hermeticum from Greek into Latin, as soon as the Greek manuscripts became available. Magic manuscripts began to be translated in parallel at the same time. Another important figure who expedited the flow of Greek Hermetic ideas into Latin was Francesco Giorgi (or Zorzi 1466-1540), author of De Harmonium Mundi,522 who later had considerable influence on the writings of Agrippa and Dee. Giorgi also helped introduce the idea of sacred geometry into the construction of buildings like churches.523   515 MS Bononiensis Univers. 3632, f. 350. 516 If the reference is not to the biblical Solomon, but to a local ruler, the following conclusions still hold good. 517 McCowan (1922), p. 25. 518 MS Bononiensis Univers. 3632 which is the earliest known manuscript of the Hygromanteia. 519 Bibliothèque Nationale Ital. 1524.

Even later the doctrines of the Kabbalah provided a conceptual skeleton for magical theory.525 The Spread of Magical Texts The Catholic Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list of banned books which was first issued in Venice in 1543, and formally commissioned by Pope Paul IV in 1559 acts as a helpful summary list of the more widely disseminated magical texts.526 Some of these books are fairly easy to recognize, others are less easy to find, as the standard of ecclesiastical bibliographic scholarship and printing was less than perfect, and many conventions of Latin contraction were carried over from manuscripts into print. As can be seen, the Clavicula Salomonis is mentioned twice, in close proximity to the Ars Hydromanteia: ‘Lib[er] Hermetis Magi ad Aristot[l]e. Lib[er] Decem Annullorum, Quattuor speculorú[m], Imaginú[m] Thobiæ, Imaginum Ptolomæi, Virginalis, Clauicula Salomonis, Libri Salomonis Magicis superstitionibus refertus’; ‘Clauicula S[o]lomonis’; ‘Hē[n]ricus Cornelius Agrippa’; ‘Hydromantiæ ars, & scripta o[mn]ía’; ’Ioannis Reuclini [Johannes Reuchlin] Speculum Oculare, De Verbo Mirifico, Ars Cabalistica’; ‘Petri de Abano opera Geomantiæ. Item liber de imaginib[us] Astrolog[ia] & de o[mn]í genere diu[i]nat[ione].’ 527 Some types of books were covered by blanket bans, like that on all books on geomancy which were specifically and originally banned in 1555, and so only appear in the Index by implication. An example of such a blanket ban is: Libri omnes, & scripta Chyromantiæ, Physionomiæ, Aeromá[n]tiæ, Geomá[n]tiæ, Hydromá[ntiae] vel Necromá[n]tiæ, siue in quib[us] Sortilegia, Veneficia, Auguria, Arusp[i]cia, Incá[n]tatiõ[n]es, Magicæ artis vel Astrologiæ indiciariæ [sic] Diuinationes circa...’; ‘Magicæ artis libri, & scripta ora’ [omnia]; ‘Necromatiæ opera, & scripta omnia.

The amount of magical and heterodox material being translated from Greek into Latin in Venice prompted the Church to set up a special branch of the Holy Office Tribunal (aka the Inquisition) in Venice in April 1547, in an effort to ‘weed out’ what they considered to be the most dangerous examples of heterodox (i.e. Protestant, Lutheran, Orthodox and Anabaptist) texts and their owners.   524 Ironically it was later seen by a number of churchmen as an aid to converting the Jews to Christianity, by deductions that sought to prove that Jesus was the Messiah which the Jews had long expected, since the time of Isaiah. 525 Specifically as used by Mathers at the end of the 19th century, working from the Latin translations of Knorr von Rosenroth. 526 These books were not removed from the Index till 1966. 527 Index Librorum Prohibitorum, 1559."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 Less frequently, the Venetian Holy Office also acted against owners of magical texts translated from Greek, but this did not gather much momentum till the 1580s. Nevertheless, the number of books confiscated had reached such proportions that by even 1573 the Holy Office ordered that all such books should henceforth be burnt, not so much to suppress their contents but to conserve storage space. Representative samples were, of course, sent to the Vatican, where most survive to this day in the Vatican Library. As Venice valued its independence, magical books, such as De Occulta Philosophia of Agrippa, continued to be sold under the counter, and the clergy were amongst the most active importers of such material. Apart from such well known texts, the bulk of magical material continued to circulate in manuscript form, even as late as the 19th century. Typical texts were the Clavicula Salomonis in its various forms (like Zecorbeni), the Heptameron, various books relating to the Kabbalah, and the classic of astral magic, the Picatrix. In 1586, Pope Sixtus V redirected the efforts of the Holy Office from control of heresy to the suppression of magic and magicians with the Bull Coeli et Terrae.528 This coincided with the publication of Bodin’s witch-hunting text, Demonomania degli Stregoni, in Venice, and with the Pope’s ‘invitation’ to Dee to come to Rome for discussions about his angelic ‘Actions.’ Prudently Dee did not go, as he did not wish to be subsequently locked up in the dungeons of the Inquisition in Rome.529 Besides, Dee was a Protestant, and going to Rome would have been like putting his head in the lion’s mouth, because of the then current enmity between Catholics and Protestants. The records of the Inquisition, and minutes of subsequent trials, help us to trace the movement of specific magical texts across Europe. Some of these copies are of a much rougher nature, and not always of high scribal quality. However learned magic had always been the province of the scriptorium and its monks who also did much of the freelance copying. In the 1630s and 1640s the novitiate of the monastery of the Minims of San Francesco of Paola became a hotbed of magical manuscript transcription and distribution. Other monasteries such as San Francesco della Vigna (‘St. Francis of the Vineyard’) also helped the transmission of magical texts. This was particularly appropriate in a monastery whose architecture was designed in part by Francesco Giorgi the author of De Harmonium Mundi who numbered magic, the Kabbalah, alchemy, astrology and   528 Barbierato (2002), pp. 159-160. 529 There is an extra dimension to the Pope’s invitation that is often overlooked by scholars. That is that the Pope, who was rumoured to have been very interested in magical experiments himself, might have genuinely wanted to question Dee about his techniques, and maybe even watch an Action in which Kelly would convey the words of the angels."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 the Hermetic texts amongst his interests.530 This wholesale copying meant that many variant readings were introduced into the texts, a process that would not have happened so rapidly if they had been printed. The addition of a well known pseudepigraphical name to a copy, such as Moses or Raziel, immediately gave a book more credibility, so that from original texts associated with the name Solomon, a whole slew of copies of the original text with additions or deletions, under various authorial names, fanned out through Europe, giving the false impression that they were different texts. The Manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis Of course there were other distinct and separate magical books, but at least 125 extant manuscripts under various names and written in various languages, owe their origin to the original Solomōnikē that arrived in Venice (or southern Italy) at or before 1453.531 In Venice alone copies were circulating in Latin, Italian, French, German, and probably English. No doubt there are many more of these to be discovered in the great libraries and private collections of Europe,532 as these scribes often deliberately left off the manuscript titles to hamper rapid identification by the authorities, and many have therefore been catalogued either under their incipit or some other generic name such as Ars Magica by harried librarians across Europe. Conversely a number of unrelated manuscripts have been catalogued as Clavicula Salomonis by librarians who came to think of this title as a generic term for magic.533 As there are so many extant manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis,534 it is necessary to outline the range of texts and the reasons for selecting the manuscripts used here for comparison.535 The language breakdown of the known manuscripts is: French 51 Latin536 31 Italian 19 English 9 German 9 Hebrew 4   530 Accordingly, the della Vigna became a point of intersection between sacred geometry and magic, and was built using ‘sacred’ proportions, echoing the measurements of the Temple of Solomon and the Jewish Kabbalah. Interestingly the main measurements are simply multiples of the number three. 531 See Skinner and Rankine (2008), Appendix A, pp. 408-414 for a full list. The manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis are also listed by Text-Groups on pp. 412-414, with a listing of their dates and languages of composition. 532 For example, I recently discovered a 1494 copy of the Goetia, miscataloged in a central European collection. 533 For a list of some of these cataloguing errors see Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 415. Of course, just like any specialist subject, it is often difficult for a generalist to choose, or even decipher, the correct title. 534 Not including manuscripts of the Hygromanteia. 535 This number and the following statistics are taken from Skinner & Rankine (2008), pp. 408-411. 536 Including mixed Dutch, German and Latin."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 Czech 1 Arabic537 1 ----- Total 125 The predominant languages are therefore French, Latin and Italian.

Although sometimes derided by scholars for producing a composite text, Mathers never-theless conscientiously edited the manuscripts listed above, whilst adding chapters from other AC manuscripts which were missing from his main source, and in doing so these additions were clearly footnoted. It is well known that he omitted three chapters on operations of love and one chapter on operations of hate, which he claimed were derived from the Grimorium Verum and the Clavicola di Salmone Ridolta, but he admitted as much in his introduction.548 He also rather naively credited Solomon the king of Israel as the author. His work in English on the AC Text-Group has however not been superseded by any scholar since, although there have been editions in French549 and Italian.550 Joseph Peterson remarked about Mathers’ work: Mr. Waite's harsh criticism [of Mathers] is hardly justified. In fact, Mathers excised very little. Actually, three of the four significant excisions are operations dealing with love magic (Colorno, chapters 11-13: The experiment of Love, and how it should be performed; The experiment or operation of the fruit; Of the operation of love by her dreams, and how one must practice it. The fourth excision is chapter 14: Operations and experiments regarding hate and destruction of enemies.)551 I have edited examples of three further Text-Groups (AC, RS and UT) from the French manuscripts Wellcome MS 4669 and Wellcome MS 4670,552 and edited and introduced one manuscript from the SM Text-Group.553 There are at least 20 manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis are in Italian (see Appendix 4), but of these only two are definitely from the 16th century.554 I have not been able to examine Brescia Civica Queriniana E VI 23, and BL Additional 10862 #2 is disappointingly short, covering just five short chapters in 12 folios.

It is not possible, within the confines of this thesis, to trace this dissemination in detail, but in outline it is as follows. In Italian the Clavicula Salomonis became known as La Clavicola di Salomone redotta et epilogata of Geo[vanni] Peccatrix559 (GP) or Zekorbeni, sive Clavicula Salomonis (Zk). The Clavicula Salomonis circulated in Latin, and was sometimes re-titled as Secreta Secretorum by ‘Toz Graecus’ (TG). In France the Clavicula Salomonis became Les Véritables Clavicules de Salomon (Text-Group Ab), La Clavicule de Salomon Roy des Hebreux (AC), Les Vrais Clavicules du Roi Solomon (Arm), La Clavicule Magique et Cabalistique du Sage Roy Salomon (CMC), Les Clavicules de Rabbi Salomon (RS), Le Secret des Secrets, autrement la Clavicule de Salomon (SS) and the very reduced in content Traité Universel des Clavicules de Salomen (UT). In England it became the familiar Key of Solomon (AC), as edited by Mathers, and the Key of Knowledge (KK is a subset of AC). In Germany it was severely edited to become the Clavicula Salomonis Expurgata, oder Schlüssel des Königs Salomons (Exp). However the Clavicula Salomonis does not seem to have had much influence in Germany in the face of the home-grown Faust tradition. The Hebrew version which appeared in Amsterdam around 1700, the Maphteah Shelomoh (SM) has already been dealt with in chapter 3.3. There is also a Czech version, and possibly other European versions not yet identified. However Spain, Portugal,560 Switzerland, Austria, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe seem to have avoided significant penetration by the Clavicula Salomonis. These migrations of the Clavicula Salomonis, in broad outline, are shown in Figure 61. A summary of these manuscripts will be found in Appendix 3. There are only two printed editions of the Key of Solomon in English,561 but selected passages have been published in English in volumes dealing with grimoires generally.562 There are many more printed editions in French and Italian, demonstrating the popularity of this grimoire in those   557 Seville Zayas C.V.1. 558 Stadbibliotek Zittau B107 #2, Bodleian Michael 276. 559 No relation to the Picatrix. 560 Spain and Portugal favoured the grimoire of St. Cyprian in its various forms instead.

Beyond the Clavicula Salomonis, there were a number of grimoires circulating in Europe (predominantly Italy, France, Spain, Germany and England) which owed some of their content, and much of their method to the Clavicula Salomonis. The main titles of this genre were The Grimoire of Pope Honorius III,565 The Grimoirium Verum,566 The Grand Grimoire,567 Grand Albert, Lesser Albert568 and The Black Dragon.569 As well as surveying the main grimoires, Owen Davies surveys the later incarnations of many of these texts, as they descend into popular ‘pulp’ editions.570 Other traditions such as the Black Books of Scandinavia,571 or the many variants on the grimoires of St. Cyprian,572 and the Faustbooks of Germany,573 form different lineages, not directly related to the Clavicula Salomonis. The history of these other grimoire lineages is quite complex, and beyond the scope of this thesis.   563 For example Dumas (1980) Lecouteux (2008) and MacPathy (2013), plus a large number of anonymous publications in French, mostly with spurious dates and places of publication.

Transmission of Specific Magical Techniques and Instruments from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate the wholesale transmission of material from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis (Key of Solomon), by identifying their common chapter contents, and confirming this by examining specific parallel texts. A number of instances could be cited demonstrating the passage of material from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis. For example, the Introduction of the Abraham Colorno Text-Group (AC) of the Clavicula Salomonis574 begins with a very similar passage to that found in the opening chapter of Hygromanteia including the opening conversation between Solomon and his son Rehoboam: Treasure up, O my son Roboam (sic)! the wisdom of my words, seeing that I, Solomon, have received it from the Lord.575 ...O my Son Roboam! seeing that of all Sciences there is none more useful than the knowledge of Celestial Movements, I have thought it my duty, being at the point of death, to leave thee an inheritance more precious than all the riches which I have enjoyed.576 The Hygromanteia likewise uses the literary device of a conversation between Solomon and Rehoboam to point out the necessity of astronomy and timing: Pay attention, my dearest son Rehoboam, to what I, your father Solomon, have said about the details of this art, which contain the entire method of the Magical Treatise. By means of this treatise, you will learn everything that is possible for a prudent, wise and zealous [man] concerning divine things man to know.577 The long chapter on the attributions of angels and demons to every hour of every day of the week found in the Hygromanteia has been passed on to the Clavicula Salomonis, however only the attribution of angels to the hours of the days of the week has survived. The Hebrew names of the hours have also been preserved in some Clavicula Salomonis manuscripts (see Figure 10).578 Citation of examples is useful, but a full comparison of the contents of every chapter in both texts is a more thorough and precise proof of this transmission. The proof that the Hygromanteia is the direct ancestor of the Key of Solomon can be demonstrated by analysing the chapters of the composite Hygromanteia (comprised of versions H, B, A and B2) with a chapter analysis of representative manuscripts of the Key of Solomon, as follows: Mathers’   574 Skinner and Rankine (2008), pp. 75-272. 575 Additional MS 10862. 576 Lansdowne MS 1203 as translated in Mathers (1909), p. 2. 577 H. f. 18v. 578 Skinner and Rankine (2008), pp. 107, 108, 126, 141, 156, 172, 188, and 202."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 edition (1909) which drew mostly from French AC579 manuscripts of the Key of Solomon; Alnwick MS 584 an AC Latin manuscript probably from the early 16th century; and Additional MS 36674 a 16th century English manuscript of the KK Text-Family of the Key of Solomon.   579 The Abraham Colorno Text-Group of manuscripts.

There are four clear exceptions to this: i) The Pentacles. These do not occur in the Hygromanteia, but they do occur in many Text-Groups of the Clavicula Salomonis. A few very sketchy diagrams of “the 24 seals that must be drawn on the lamen” occur in some manuscripts of the Hygromanteia.611 These contain very simple pentagrams, box grids and 8-spoke wheel drawings which faintly resemble ‘thumbnails’ of the much more complex pentacles of the Clavicula Salomonis.612 These are obviously degenerate versions of the pentacles, lacking any detail, any wording or any explanation. Identifying discontinuities is as important as identifying continuities, as it sometimes leads to the discovery of new sources, as it has in the case of the pentacles. The exact details of the transmission of the pentacles will be looked at in more detail in chapter 5.4.2. ii) Some of the ‘Experiments’ which are clearly add-ons in many Clavicula Salomonis manuscripts are missing from the Hygromanteia.613 Such experiments are often to be found at the end of European grimoires, often written in a different hand, and have obviously been added in by owners or editors of the manuscripts from other sources.614 iii) The astrology chapters of the Hygromanteia (chapters 4-8) were not passed on to the Clavicula Salomonis, but were probably separated out into separate Latin astrology texts. iv) The most immediately noticeable loss is the methods of evocatory skrying (chapters 47-57), the section ironically entitled Hygromanteia.615 These methods were not transmitted.616 However, these evocatory skrying methods are found almost word-for-word in 11th century Jewish sources.

Further parallels will be outlined in chapter 5, which also takes into account procedures and equipment originating in the PGM, and commonalities across all three sources. Although the skrying chapters have been omitted from the Clavicula Salomonis, a correlation can still be shown between them and the skrying methods represented in the PGM. See chapters 5.9 and 9.3."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 5. The Commonality and Continuity of Method between the PGM, the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis This section tests the hypothesis that there is a commonality between the magicians’ handbooks, techniques and tools in the three different periods and cultures being examined: Graeco-Egyptian, Byzantine and European Solomonic grimoires. The purpose of this chapter is to examine commonality of method and equipment, and not specifically their direct transmission, although that is implied. Minimal material on Mesopotamian, dynastic Egyptian magic or Jewish magic has been added where it clarifies, illuminates or contributes to the understanding, or history, of a particular practice. In each section, the purpose is not simply to document the manifestation of the technique in each culture or era, but to use the demonstrated similarities of materials or techniques to support the thesis that many of these techniques or ingredients were common, and survived changes of geography, culture and language (albeit with some scribal mangling) over upwards of 2000 years. Continuity is defined as “the unbroken and consistent existence or operation of something; a connection or line of development with no sharp breaks; the maintenance of continuous action...”617 In Europe, continuity in magica is much more a matter of tracing the persistence of documents and their contents, rather than being able to demonstrate “continuous action,” or oral passage from one practitioner to the next. This is especially true in Western Europe, where unrelenting Christian persecution of magic has been in force for at least 1700 years, and before that, selective persecution. As a result of this, although it is sometimes possible to identify some of the magicians who owned the magicians’ handbooks, it is not often possible to identify the passage of techniques and training from one magician to another. The history of magic in Europe therefore has more often been one of rediscovery, each magician reassembling techniques from the books and manuscripts of previous practitioners. Under these circumstances it is remarkable that there is such a degree of commonality given the fragmentation of the transmission. The first example of transmission, spanning the period from 579 to 1425, from the end of the period covered by the PGM to within a few years of the earliest recorded manuscript of the Hygromanteia, is concerned with the iconography of the spiritual creatures who were the target of evocations rather than the evocations per se. A sarcophagus dated 579 CE was discovered in Xian (Chang An) in 2003. It shows a very   617 Concise Oxford Dictionary (1999)."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 clearly delineated god or demon/daimon carved in deep relief.

He looks after the soul of the deceased for the first three days after death, and as a psychopomp, sees him across the bridge to the underworld, and so is a most appropriate motif on a sarcophagus. The figure is therefore not a priest.

Figure 02: Bird- and goat-footed demons with tails, wings and upturning beards, from a 1425 manuscript.622 The upturned moon in Figure 01 may have here turned into horns. Note that the magician is standing inside a protective circle, is very obviously negotiating with the demons and giving them orders. He holds a book which is very likely to be a grimoire.623 What immediately strikes one is the close anatomical resemblance to the bird-legged and winged demons shown in a number of mediaeval manuscripts (see Figure 02). Note the   621 Sogdanian Zoroastrianism survived till at least the 13th century on the borders of China, whilst Islam may have all but purged it from its Iranian homeland. 622 Additional MS 39844, f. 51 reproduced in Page (2004), p. 7. 623 The dark anchor shape in the bottom right of the picture is not part of the image, but a show-through from f. 51v."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 almost identical and unusual upturned pointed beard, the feathery tails, the bird legs and the wings on both creatures. By way of confirmatory identification of these two images, the magician in Figure 02 is described as Canoaster (i.e. Zoroaster). It is surely more than a coincidence that Zoroaster is the common denominator of these two strikingly similar images.624 It is certainly not a coincidence that Zoroaster, and his magi priests, were seen by the Greeks as the original source of their magic. It is just speculation, but if Zoroastrian priests, who were called magi, brought the magic of Zoroaster to the Greek world, might they not also have brought their iconography, or their knowledge of daimons/demons with them as well? The image of these daimons/demons might well have passed from the magi to Greek books of magical ritual, and later to the Latin West, especially as it was the Sogdians who were amongst the most active traders along the silk route.625 There are no illustrations of demons in the Clavicula Salomonis or the Hygromanteia, but bird-footed demons occur in contemporary magical and theological texts, alongside of goat-footed demons. The goat feet might be easily identified with Pan, but the bird-feet were not so obvious, prior to this identification. The illustration in Figure 02 dates from 1425, just 15 years before the oldest extant manuscript of the Hygromanteia.626 It would therefore seem that the iconography of this particular spiritual creature has hardly changed in appearance over a period of 850 years. Many other examples of commonality over similarly long periods of time will be examined in this chapter, not of images of spiritual creatures, but of the methods and materials used to evoke them. Methods and Materials of Magic The following exploration of these methods and materials of magic has been divided up into the following broad classifications: 1. Hierarchy of spiritual creatures: the magician’s approach to the classification of the hierarchy of spiritual creatures: gods, daimones, angels, spirits, demons, etc. 2. Preliminary Procedures and Preparation: timing, location, baths, purity, abstinence, etc. 3. Protection: the Solomonic circle, triangle, brass vessel, phylacteries and lamens.   624 The only other explanation is that the iconography of demons remained the same, regardless of when they were sculptured or painted. 625 It is worth pointing out that Sogdian Zoroastrian manuscripts pre-date any surviving Avestan manuscripts from either Iran or India by more than 300 years. Zoroastrian fire temples were found near Dunhuang, a major trade ‘gateway’ to China.

Those ‘manteia’ that just flourished in the Byzantine period, but do not appear to have migrated to the Latin grimoires, such as onkhomanteia, ōomanteia, katoptromanteia or chalkomanteia, are not examined."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 5.1 The Hierarchy of Spiritual Creatures The importance of hierarchy in magic cannot be overstressed. It is one of the basic principles acknowledged and utilised by magicians in all periods. It is well known that knowing the name of a spirit is reputed to give the magician control over that spirit. In order to coerce that spirit into carrying out the wishes of the magician, there are a number of threats that the magician typically uses. 5.1.1 The Hierarchies of Spirits, Angels and Daimones The first of these techniques is to order that spirit in the name of one of its superiors. This technique is found in ancient Egyptian magic, the PGM, the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. The theory of ‘hierarchical threatening’ is that the spirit is not in a position to check if the magician has the authority to make such an order, it simply reacts to the threat. It works on the same principle as a teacher threatening a student that he will be sent to the headmaster, an outcome that no student relishes. At the point the threat is issued, neither the headmaster, nor the superior spirit, has been consulted. Therefore, clearly knowing the names of the spirit’s superiors, at all the levels of the hierarchy, gives the magician the power he needs. This technique of utilising the power of the name, not necessarily of the supreme being, but of one further up the ‘food chain’ appears in each of the sources we are examining here, and so is a clear example of the transmission of a magical technique. Specific illustrative examples are detailed below. Jewish Sources In Jewish magic, it is clearly acknowledged that the magic is performed by angels or demons, constrained by the magician who uses the names of god or his archangels as his credentials for ordering around the lesser angels or spirits: God is usually not compelled directly in these incantations. Rather it is his authority that is brought to bear on his subordinates, the angels or demons. In fact, the angels can be seen as heavenly bureaucrats, loyal to their superiors and suspicious of mere mortals. The magician holds a script - the amulet (or more accurately, the spoken incantation), bearing the seal of the [spirit] King – the magical name. Thus it is this authority, and not any inherent power of the individual, that enables the magicians to command angels and demons and help the client. This function may also explain the affinities between magical and legal formulae. According to this structure by which the magician is the authorized agent of God on behalf of the client, the incantation is a document, binding on the angels [or demons], that accomplishes its function upon writing or recitation.628 This passage succinctly sums up this dynamic common to all three periods. This approach is also very clear in the PGM, where the supreme gods like Phre/Ra or Osiris   628 Swartz (1990), p. 179."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 are often invoked as a coercive threat. Hierarchical threats are quite common in the PGM, even to using a name with which to threaten the gods themselves: Hear me, because I am going to say the great name, AŌTH,629 before whom every god prostrates himself and every daimon shudders, for whom every angel completes those things which are assigned. Your divine name according to the seven [vowels] is AEĒIOYŌ IAYŌĒ EAŌOYEĒŌIA. I have spoken the glorious name, the name for all needs.630 This purports to be an excellent all-purpose name, as it applies to the whole range of spiritual creatures: gods, angels and daimones. The threat is also closely tied in to the magician’s order to complete the task in hand and/or reveal certain information. The obverse of this threat is to promise the spiritual creature that the magician will praise it to its superiors. One such Demotic inducement to assist in a lamp skrying, promises that the daimon with be praised to Ra, the sun god and also to the moon god: I shall praise you in heaven before Pre; I shall praise you before the moon; I shall praise you on earth; I shall praise you before the one who is on the throne...631 Daimones are below the gods in the hierarchy. Daimones are defined in some detail by Socrates who quotes Diotima as saying that daimones are: Interpreters and ferrymen, carrying divine things to mortals and mortal things to gods; requests and sacrifices from below and commandments and answers from above. Being midway between, [daimones] make each half supplement the other, so that the whole becomes unified. Through them are conveyed all divination (mantikē) and all priestly crafts concerning sacrifices, initiations, incantations, all prophetic power (manteia) and magic. For the divine does not mix with the mortal, and it is only through the mediation of [the daimones] that mortals can have any interaction with the gods, either while awake or while asleep.632 In the sense of messengers of the gods, daimones seem very close in nature to angels, except that they deliver messages in both directions, not just from god. The fact that they are also seen as the conduit for magic and divination reinforces the relationship between the magician and the daimones in their later Mediaeval ‘incarnation’ as demons. The works of Classical Greek writers and Neoplatonists like Iamblichus and Synesius were of course available to the Byzantines, unlike the Latin West, which did not have such easy access to Greek materials, till Ficino’s translations. Byzantines were for the most part Orthodox Christians, but despite their Christian affiliations, their views on daimones/demons were partly shaped by the Neoplatonic sources that were also available to them in Greek. Michael Psellus (1018-1096) sums up the 11th century Orthodox view of daimones coloured by his familiarity with Neoplatonic texts, and laced with some rather forced but politically correct raillery against some of the schismatic sects, while still taking an active interest in,   629 \u0019\u001a@. 630 PGM XII. 117. 631 PDM xiv. 493. 632 Plato, Symposium, 202e-203a as quoted in Johnston (2008), p.10."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 and an opportunity to discuss, their heretical theology. Psellus in his 3\f\u0003A7=\u0002ι\u0004B\u0013\u0017\u0013, On Daimones divides daimones into six classes:633 1. Igneous (fiery)634 2. Aerial (airy)635 3. Terrestrial (earthy) 4. Aqueous (water) 5. Subterranean (underneath the earth, in caves) 6. Heliophobic (adverse to sunlight). This division is often found in later grimoires, especially those of the German Faustian tradition, where ‘heliophobic’ is more often expressed as ‘lucifugous.’636 Obviously the first four varieties owe a lot to the elemental divisions of the encyclopaedist Isidore of Seville. In his De Omnifaria Doctrina, Psellus stated that although Christians were obliged to view all demons as bad, the non-Christian Greeks and ‘Chaldaeans’ believed that at least the ethereal and aerial demons were good. This view was echoed by magicians then and subsequently. By the time that Solomonic magic had reached Byzantium, it had developed a detailed hierarchy of angels and demons, as is exemplified in the long tables of their names.637 The purpose of this categorisation was to ensure that the correct angel/demon pair was conjured on the correct day, and at the correct hour. The importance of timing as well as the association of named demons/angels with each hour of each day is a definite importation from the PGM, which will be examined in chapter 5.2.3. Greenfield explains the practical use of the hierarchy in the Byzantine context: Indeed, it was in such theories [of hierarchy] that much of the role ascribed to the demons in divination and sorcery was grounded since their position as the controllers, administrators or servants of such powers and influences made it vital for the practitioner of these arts to secure their favour in some way, to find the moment when they were most favourable or most easily led, or else to force them to use their power in the desired fashion. In the last case this might usually be accomplished by [threatening them with] the authorities who were believed to be positioned above them in their particular astrological hierarchy.638 A second technique that occurs in the Hygromanteia and in subsequent Latin grimoires is the procedure of invoking the spiritual creatures in a fixed sequence. The Hygromanteia has its hierarchy formally embedded in the scheme of invocation, so that there are specific instructions that the planet and the relevant angel must be invoked first, followed by the daimon, and then the spirit who is actually to be entrusted with the task. This is a significant   633 Collison (2010), p.18. 634 Or ethereal. 635 By some commentators referred to as ‘sub-lunar’ daimones, inhabiting the air space between the Moon and the Earth. 636 Butler (1949), pp. 35, 164. 637 For example Marathakis (2011), pp. 55-68 where 7 x 24 x 2 = 336 demons and angels occur just in one such table. 638 Greenfield (1988), p. 176."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 development from the ‘free-range’ threatening of the PGM. The other advance is that the hierarchy is invoked in descending order, rather than just listed at random, as is often the case in the PGM. A third technique is the use of “thwarting angels,” the matching of the demon of each hour with its angelic opposite number, who controls it. One of the earliest examples of this is to be found in the 1st/2nd century Testament of Solomon, and it is also present in the Hygromanteia. The Hygromanteia has a large number of listed demons, each with their matching number of angels. Amongst the angels regular –aēl or –iēl endings predominate, betraying a distinctly Hebraic origin for many of their names.639 The technique of threatening a spiritual creature with one further up the hierarchy is also utilised in the Clavicula Salomonis, where god’s name is also often invoked. The Clavicula Salomonis has a detailed hierarchy of archangels, angels and spirits, and a similar mechanism for threatening recalcitrant spirits. Another recalcitrant spirit technique that comes to full fruition later, in the Goetia, is the practice of heating the spirit’s sigil over a fire in order to cause the spirit pain.640 The names of the spirits in the Latin and vernacular grimoires give clues as to the origin of these texts, as well as confirming the continuity of their hierarchical structure. Juratus, one of the earliest grimoires to appear in Latin Europe (circa 1225 CE)641 has an interesting selection of 100 “Holy Names of God.” One analysis made of these 100 names estimates 49 names are of Greek origin and 17 names of Hebrew origin, with the balance being of indeterminate origin.642 It therefore seems very likely that the origin of this grimoire (like the origin of the Clavicula Salomonis) will eventually be discovered in the Greek speaking eastern Mediterranean. In later Latin and English grimoires there is an elaborate structure which copies European civil administration. The Goetia (1641,643 but with precursor texts dating back to the 15th century) for example, has a whole range of aristocratic spirits including Kings, Dukes, Earls, Marquises, Presidents, Princes and Prelates, down to lowly Knights.644 These aristocratic spirits are also matched with the planets, where logically the 12 Kings are attributed to the   639 These were probably added to the Hygromanteia in the early Geonic period, according to Pingree (1980), p. 10. 640 Skinner and Rankine (2007), p. 182. 641 On the basis of the mention of this book by William of Auvergne (c.1180-1249).

On the other hand there is no certainty that the books are not the same. 642 Skinner (2006), Table M7. 643 Sloane MS 3825. 644 See Table M17 and M18 in Skinner (2006)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 Sun in each of the 12 zodiacal signs.645 In 1563 Weyer646 even entitled his grimoire, listing the very same spirits, as the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, or ‘False Monarchy of the Demons.’647 The 72 demons of the Goetia are divided up by both the 12 zodiacal Signs and the seven Planets.648 However these lists have obviously been edited a number of times, so that the number of demons occupying the sphere of Saturn has been reduced to just one (Furcas);649 while Venus has 22 demons allocated to it. Mercury, Moon and Sun each have 12 demons. This uneven distribution is a sure sign that the lists have been redacted a number of times, with the less helpful Saturnian spirits gradually being omitted from the listing, and Venusian spirits (for the popular operations of love) increased. These changes appear therefore to have come about as a result of usage and experimentation, rather than just at the arbitrary whim of a redactor. The zodiacal distribution is more even-handed than the planetary division, with an average of six demons per sign. The Art Almadel divides its angelic hosts into four chorae.650 Chora is usually translated from the Latin altitudine as “altitude” which only makes sense, in the context, if one assumes that the choirs of angels are drawn from different (planetary) spheres which are located at varying altitudes above the Earth.651 The original Greek meaning of chora, in use in Egypt in the 1st century BCE, refers to the suburban areas immediately outside of the cities of Naukratis, Ptolemais and Alexandria.652 It is then not too much of an imaginative stretch to see that as the chorae were districts, the angels might have been attributed to these districts or simply to the four cardinal directions of these districts: ...for you must observe there are four Altitudes [chorae] which represent the four Corners of the world East, West, North and South... and the Angels of every [one] of these Altitudes have their particular Virtues and powers as shall be showed hereafter.653 A time, as well as space, dimension is added by attributing the four chorae to the 12 zodiacal signs. For example, the first chora is attributed to the East, and the first three Signs of the zodiac. Following this logic, the invocant should face East and invoke the first two angels of that chora in the day of the Sun, and the Sign of Aries: As for Example, Suppose I would call the two first of the five [angels] that belongs to the first Chora, then choose the first Sunday in March after the Sun hath entered Aries, and then I make   645 There has been some redactional loss of consistency in Leo, Libra, and Capricorn. 646 Johann Weyer (1515-1588) was a Dutch physician and a pupil of Cornelius Agrippa. 647 See Weyer (1660) and Weyer (1998). 648 The full matrix of these demons is laid out in Table M18 of Skinner (2006). 649 There is a good argument for seeing even that attribution as a mistake. 650 Skinner and Rankine (2007), pp. 344-346. 651 Antonio da Montolmo in his De Occultis et Manifestis equates the Altitudes with the angels of the 12 zodiacal Signs.

The god may simply answer some pressing questions, or it may remain a permanent helpmate or sponsor.657 The arrival of the god or goddess may be obtained in several different manners. These experiments are categorised as: dreams and Visions (‘V’); direct vision of the god (‘E’); association with the god (‘G’) in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. The most common occurrence was the god’s intervention in the practitioner’s dreams. Such dreams were reputedly very lucid and not at all like ordinary dreams (which was the touchstone of their nature). Secondarily the divinity might appear in the context of a skrying operation and be seen in a bowl of water or oil, a crystal (more relevant in Europe after the Middle Ages) or in the reflected flame of a lamp. These techniques are categorised as ‘B’ or ‘D’ in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. However, the most impressive epiphany of the god or goddess was their physical appearance in front of the magician, during which the magician may be able to ask questions and receive answers. Under these circumstances the usual injunction (just as in Biblical accounts of Yahweh appearing to Moses, or to the other Hebrew prophets) was not to look directly at the face of the divinity, but to “look at their feet.”658 In later European grimoires, the manifesting spirit is commanded to appear in a human-like and non-frightening form, without arousing fear in the viewers. Likewise, both gods and spirits were constrained to tell the plain truth and not lie in many of the conjurations: I, N, son of N, present my supplication before you, that you appear to me [without] causing   654 The Goetia in Skinner and Rankine (2007), p. 346. 655 The bracketed letters appearing after many of the chapters in chapter 5 correspond to the rite types used to categorise the PGM rites in Appendix 2. All of these rite types have their own chapters, except for the Sundry rites (O, E, X), the Mystery rites (M), Prayers (P) and operations which are categorized just on the basis of their objectives, rather than on the basis of the techniques involved. 656 A few exceptions of corrupted god names appearing as demons will be noted later. 657 Rather like the classical Greek gods or goddesses who often assisted a chosen mortal. 658 Yahweh reputedly showed Moses his hind-quarters, to protect that worthy from the probably fatal outcome of a direct glance.

A typical Apollonian invocation from the PGM also makes a similar request. I adjure these holy and divine names that They send me the divine spirit and that it Fulfil what I have in my heart and soul... Send me this daimon at my sacred chants... And send him gentle, gracious, pondering No thoughts opposed to me. And may you not Be angry at my sacred chants.

This rite explains that, although the god may not be visible, there will be a sign of his presence: After you have said this three times, there will be this sign of divine encounter, but you, armed by having this magical soul,662 be not alarmed. For a sea falcon flies down and strikes you on the body with its wings, signifying this: that [the god has come, and so] you should arise.663 One of the most detailed accounts of a god’s arrival is recounted by Thessalos of Tralles, a doctor (in a letter to the Emperor Claudius): Now, he [the priest] had prepared a pure room (oikos) and the other things that were necessary for the visitation (episkepsis)... (22) The high-priest asked me whether I would want to converse with the soul of some dead person or with a god. I said, ‘Asklepios.’ ...Now when he had shut me in the room and commanded me to sit opposite the throne upon which the god was about to sit, he led me through the [pronunciation of the] god’s secret names and he shut the door as he left. (24) Once I sat down, I was being released from body and soul by the incredible nature of the spectacle. For neither the facial features of Asklepios nor the beauty of the surrounding decoration can be expressed clearly in human speech. Then, reaching out his right hand, Asklepios began to say: (25) “Oh blessed Thessalos, attaining honour in the presence of the god. As time passes, when your successes become known, men will worship you as a god. Ask freely, then, about what you want and I will readily grant you everything.” (26) I scarcely heard anything, for I had been struck with amazement and overwhelmed by seeing the form of the god. Nevertheless, I was inquiring why I had failed when trying the prescriptions of Nechepso. To this the god said: (27) “King Nechepso, a man of most sound mind and all honourable forms of excellence, did not obtain from an utterance of the gods what you are seeking to learn. Since he had a good natural ability, he [just] observed the sympathy of stones and plants with the stars, but he did not know   659 Sepher ha-Razim, 4: 63-65. 660 PGM I. 312-323. 661 PGM IV. 154-220. 662 I believe this is a mis-translation, and %\u000f\u00156\u0013 should be translated as ‘spirit,’ in the sense of an assistant spirit.

One of the prime requirements of ritual magic, in all periods, is to know the correct names, not only of the god being invoked, but also of his secret names. This passage also affords us confirmation of the importance of right times, especially in the picking of herbs used in magic. The conditions for herb harvesting will be further pursued in chapter 6.14.

It opens with Anubis (Egyptian), and lists Gnostic gods (Abraxas, Ablantho), Greek gods (Circe, infernal Zeus, Hermes, Hades, Titan), gods of the firmament (the Bear asterism671 and Sirius) and even the Jewish god (Iaweh or Yahweh). In another passage,672 apart from the usual gods/goddesses there are the Greek gods of personified qualities, like Famine, Jealousy, the Destinies, the Malignities and the Punishments. This spell has the longest roll-call of Greek mythology of any PGM rite: the Erinys Orgogorgoniotrian; many chthonic forms of Persephone (Persephassa), Hermes, Hekate, Acheron, Amphiaros, Ariste, Tartaros, Charon, Chaos, Erebos, Styx, Lethe, Hades, Pluto, Aiakos and Zeus. There is also a long string of unusual nomina magica. Kore is one of the few classical Greek goddesses that has persisted through to the European grimoires, usually appearing as a demon, right up to her appearance in the 15th century Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.673 As a general rule, the invocation of gods or goddesses has been deleted from texts like the Hygromanteia, after filtering through many centuries of Christian control, but their names are still used to designate the days of the week, and may occasionally appear in mangled form in invocations. The Christianisation of the grimoires leaves little room for the pagan gods in the Clavicula Salomonis, but the various Hebrew names for god like Jehovah and Sabaoth are still maintained as an ultimate threat to spirits. 5.1.3 The Hierarchy of Angels In what is a Jewish influenced rite,674 for consecrating a lamella for favour, victory and power, the angels of the heavens are enumerated as listed in Table 04.675 The concept of stratified heavens and their association with rain and snow is definitely derived from Jewish sources, along with at least three of the angel names.

These also form an important part of the Clavicula Salomonis manuscripts. See chapter 5.2.3. At least five of these angels map on to the angels of the hours in the Clavicula Salomonis.682 Given that these angels probably originated in Babylon, and occasionally appear in the PGM, these names are probably one of the longest established commonalities amongst all the magical texts under consideration.   676 The seven Heavens are listed with their corresponding spirits as outlined in (Abano) in Skinner (2006), Table M10. 677 PGM XXXV. 1-14. 678 For a full list see Marathakis (2011), pp. 71-74. 679 Even within this manuscript there are a number of variant forms, but the ones chosen are the most common. 680 The attribution of Raphael to Jupiter instead of Mercury is uncommon, occurring otherwise in the Picatrix. 681 Chapters 3 and 13. 682 Mathers (1909), p. 8."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 159 De Abano’s Heptameron has an even more complex list of angels, which also appears in the RS Text-family of the Clavicula Salomonis,683 which is divided up by Season:684 Angels of the Seasons from de Abano’s Heptameron Spring Summer Autumn Winter Name of Season Talvi Casmaran Ardarael Farlas Angels of Season Caratasa, Core, Amatiel, Commissoros Gargatel, Tariel, Gaviel Tarquam, Guabarel Amabael, Ctarari Head of Sign Spugliguel Tubiel Torquaret Altarib Earth in Season Amadai Festativi Rabianara Geremiah Sun in Season Abraym Athemay Abragini Commutaff Moon in Season Agusita Armatus Matasignais Affaterim Table 05: The Seasonal angels of the Heptameron.685 5.1.4 The Hierarchy of Demons As daimon was a Greek concept, and demon a Christian adaptation of that concept, it is reasonable to maintain that there are no daimones or demons in dynastic Egyptian magic. Of course there are many Egyptian gods, like Apep or Seth to which demonic behaviour has been attributed. In order to understand the nature of daemons we can look back at a text which is normally characterised as purely about theurgy and Neo-Platonic theology, but which in fact makes some very shrewd observations about other spiritual creatures, and which continue to be relevant long past the period in which they were written. Iamblichus (c. 250-325 CE) is one of the most important sources of the philosophy and theology behind magic, and he is contemporary with the bulk of the material in the PGM. Scholars, however, usually characterise him among the Neoplatonic philosophers, and do not look to him for elucidation on matters of magic. However he provides some useful contemporary theological and philosophical background to the PGM. Iamblichus was a disciple of Porphyry, who was in turn a student of perhaps the most important Neoplatonist, Plotinus. Iamblichus’ influential treatise De Mysteriis, or Theurgia, or On the Mysteries of Egypt is in the form of a reply to a letter from Porphyry to Anebo, an Egyptian priest, clearly linking the text with the Graeco-Egyptian world, and hence the Graeco-Egyptian magic of the PGM. Although it is usually said that this text deals only with theurgy, which operates predominantly through the agency of the gods, it contains material   683 Chapter XII of Wellcome MS 4670 (dated 1796) as translated in Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 103. 684 It is not clear where these angel names come from. 685 Abano (2005), pp. 76-96; Skinner (2006), Table M10a."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 on other forms of magic. Iamblichus’ influence on magic was further propagated by Agrippa who referred frequently to him in his De Occulta Philosophia. Renaissance Neoplatonists, like Ficino, and Kabbalists like Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno and even Nostradamus (see chapter 8.3), were also influenced by Iamblichus. In De Mysteriis, apart from the gods, archons, angels, daimones, heroes and ‘pure souls’ there is also described a class of un-named spiritual creatures who are said to be irrational and almost robotic.686 They are initially described as: ...another class of being from among those which surround us, devoid of reason and judgement, which has been allotted just one power, in the apportionment of tasks which has been prescribed for each entity in each of the parts [of the universe]...687 Then as: ...there exists a certain class of powers ('\u000f\u0013!\u0004\f\u0017\u0013) in the cosmos - limited, devoid of judgement and highly irrational, which are capable of receiving and obeying rational instruction from another, but neither has any understanding of its own nor distinguishes what is true or false or what is possible or impossible. It is such a class that is at once stirred up and startled when threats are brandished at them, since, it seems to me, it is in their own nature to be led by appearances and to be influenced by other things through a foolish and unstable imagination.688 This description seems to closely fit the demons of the later grimoires especially, because: i) They are allocated one function. Typically, in the grimoires, demons have one or two specialised functions, so that one who satisfies lust cannot be constrained to help a huntsman, or find gold, for example. ii) They are capable of receiving and obeying rational instruction. Unlike gods or angels, demons are typically ordered around by the magician. iii) They have no understanding of truth or falsity. Demons are often accused in the grimoires of lying to the magician, but maybe Iamblichus had a better understanding of the situation when he said they cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. iv) Most telling, he says that these spiritual creatures may be “stirred up and startled when threats are brandished at them.” This encapsulates the method used in the grimoires, which recommend threatening spirits with punishment in the deepest hell, an action that the magician certainly is not in a position to enforce. Such bogus threats are also to be found in the PGM where the magician threatens to stop the sun in its course, or report the spirit to some supreme god. v) Iamblichus’ conclusion that such entities can “be led by appearances” also gives justification for the magician wearing regalia like a (paper) crown, or other   686 My thanks to Christopher Plaisance for drawing my attention to these passages. 687 De Mysteriis IV.1.182. 688 De Mysteriis VI. 5.246."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 accoutrements with divine names hastily inked on them, a make-believe that would not for an instant fool another human, even a child, and presumably not an angel or a god. vi) The standard technique of claiming to be a god, or of acting in the name of a senior demon, would likewise not be credited by anyone except an entity who cannot “distinguish what is true or false or what is possible or impossible.” Iamblichus concludes that the demons (for that is what he is certainly speaking of here) have a “foolish and unstable imagination.” Therefore, Iamblichus appears to have understood demons and their manner of interacting with the magician, and has clearly made the distinction between them and the other entities which are dealt with under the heading of theurgy. His clear statements are probably one of the best analyses of the nature of such demons that we have, and they go a long way towards explaining the theory behind the actual methods of evocation. Although not actually labelling them as demons, the description of their nature is completely consistent with the modus operandi of the magicians of the PGM, the Hygromanteia, the Clavicula Salomonis and of the later European grimoires. Most interestingly, the picture he paints is many miles from the Church’s portrayal of demons as dangerous, cunning, and intent upon securing the magician’s soul. This now makes more sense of typical grimoire instructions to threaten the demons with hell, or consignment to a bottle, bogus threats which are designed to play on their “unstable imaginations.” Greenfield effectively summarises the Byzantine approach to demons: The whole rationale of demonic magic, for instance, required that the demons possessed powers of their own which were seen as being experienced by men, whether they welcomed or feared them, employed or countered them. These were not seen as delusions, nor were they generally thought to be allowed [to act] only by God’s permission; spirits were not conjured to perform something if it was believed that they could only work illusion, demons were not commanded in the names of God and his angels if it was believed that God himself was allowing them to do what was being commanded for some ulterior and entirely different purpose.689 In fact one variety of Euchitae belief viewed Satanael as the first son of God, and Jesus the second.690 Satanael also features as a demon in the Hygromanteia. The Bogomils attributed the miracles of the saints to the same kind of magic apparent in the Hygromanteia, and therefore levelled the playing field.691 One of the more serious theological problems of early Christianity was to distinguish miracles (done by saints) from magic (performed by magicians). The Bogomils accepted that the same demons, and the same magical techniques,   689 Greenfield (1988), p.166. 690 According to Psellus.

This is a long-standing idea, exemplified in Simon Magus’s failed attempts to buy some of the relevant magical techniques from the Apostles.692 In a few versions of the prayers to the planets (in chapter 3 of the Hygromanteia), the angels and demons of each planet are included.693 However, in the vast majority of cases these demons cannot be traced back to the PGM. But very interestingly, as Greenfield notices, some of the demons appear in the 1st/2nd century Testament of Solomon.694 Most of these angel and demon names are not to be found elsewhere, so the Testament of Solomon is clearly one of the tributary sources of the Hygromanteia, or they both have a common ancestor. Standard Judeo/Christian angels, like Mikhaēl, Ouriēl (Ariēl), Rhaphael, Gabriēl and Anaēl are also to be found in the lists of planetary angels (Hygromanteia chapters 3 & 13). The demons of the Hygromanteia have much more in common with the demons of the Testament of Solomon than with the entities of the PGM. In the vernacular grimoires, demons are often organised into ‘registers.’ The two classic examples of these structures are the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage695 and the four books of the Lemegeton.696 The Abramelin hierarchy is governed by four Princes (Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan and Belial) and nine sub-Princes whose number include one Greek chthonic goddess (Kore), and four Demon Kings (Paymon, Oriens, Ariton and Amaymon), ruling 416 servient spirits. The Lemegeton contains four books, each of which arranges their register of spirits in a different manner. This detailed hierarchy gives ample scope for the use of the technique of threatening spirits with the names of their superiors in the hierarchy.   692 Acts 8-9:24. 693 Specifically P, f. 277-277v, where they are interleaved with the Prayers of the Planets.

The preliminary preparation and consecration of a number of different instruments is one of the hallmarks of the Solomonic method. These preparations are common to both the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. Less detailed but similar rules occur in the PGM, but only in some rites. Typically for the PGM, if the rite is performed indoors then the whole room must be thoroughly cleaned. A strict limitation of diet and social intercourse, together with a tough regime of prayer was enjoined upon the magician. Rising before dawn, ablutions and the wearing of clean linen was also obligatory. The rationale of these preparations was to ensure the necessary purity for the magician to be able to deal with spiritual creatures. All of these preliminary preparations occur later in the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. 5.2.1 Location for Operation The most basic injunction was that the location should be pure, and preferably away from the haunts of man. The practical reasons are obvious, especially in the Latin West when magic was more vigorously prosecuted, but the spiritual reasons related to purity. It was thought that spirits, and indeed the gods, would not happily enter an impure environment. From a practical point of view having a location where there would be no interruptions from passing strangers was important, although the monk shown looking on in Figure 18 does not seem to have unduly perturbed the magician. Of course the risk of prosecution would also have enforced the finding of a secluded spot. These concerns would not have been so pressing in ancient Egypt where magic would often have been done within the temple precincts where privacy and purity were presumably assured. Its translation to the more prosaic environment of the magician’s home or workshop meant there would be an increased need for purification, but no fear of prosecution. Egyptian priests would often freelance as magicians during the time they were not on temple duty: The “private” magician is revealed to be none other than the cultic priest, in “private practice” during interims in temple service.701 By the time the main Egyptian temples were closed down (the last one in 550 CE), the priests had left their accustomed quarters and probably operated from their homes. A number of   701 Ritner (2008), p. 2."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 165 formulae suggest that the rites take place in sunlight, facing the sun, often at dawn or sunset. In many cases the operation could take place in the enclosed courtyard of the home, or upon its flat roof (both architectural features still to be found extensively in Egypt and the Middle East, where issues of rainwater runoff are not important). Some modern 21st century magicians702 counsel that evocations should be done as close to the earth as possible, preferably in a cellar, with no intervening floors between the operation and the earth. A reflection of this view can also be found in some Graeco-Egyptian Demotic invocations, where it is suggested that: You do it in a dark place whose door opens to the east or the south, and under which there is no cellar.703 One rite confirms that the ground floor of a house is the best place from which to conjure, even for the god of the sun, Helios.704 Conversely, it is recommended that rites which involve the heavens, or the Moon, or the Bear asterism be conducted “after going up to a roof top.”705 The Hygromanteia agrees that an isolated venue is best, but does not specify the ground floor or a cellar. The same specification occurs in many of the Clavicula Salomonis manuscripts. Chapter II of the Key of Solomon clearly specifies the qualities required in the place of working: You need to have procured a small chamber or a secret room... It is important that the place, which you have chosen is also clean, because you will not be able to use any decoration or unnecessary ornament in the place, as it might distract you and lead your spirit and imagination astray. A table with a few chairs and a chest, which should be kept under lock and key, is sufficient... every item of furniture, which is minimal should be new, or at least very clean and purified by the scent of the incenses... 706 The second part of the Lemegeton, entitled ‘The Art Theurgia Goetia of Kinge Salomon’ has a description of the ideal place of evocation. Strangely this does not occur at the beginning of the grimoire, but part way through, incorporated into a description of the Duke Pamersiel: To call Forth Pamersiel, or any of his servants, chuse the uppermost [uttermost] private or secret and most picitt707 Rome [picked room] in the house, or in some Certaine Island wood or Grove or the most occult and hidden place [removed] from all comers and goers, that one chanc[e] by, may (if possible) happen that way ([into your] Chamber of whatsoever place else, you Act y[ou]r Concerns in) observe that it be very Ayery [airy] because these spirits that is in this part are all of the Ayer [air]...708   702 For example Dr Joseph Lisiewski. 703 PDM xiv. 766. 704 PGM VI. 4. 705 PGM LXXII. 1.

Most grimoires stress a secret or a secluded location. 5.2.2 Space – Orientation and the Four Demon Kings Many religions orientate their temples to face East, the rising sun, but the orientation of magical operations is more complex. The time and direction faced are of prime importance in magical operations, and this has been the case since antiquity. The following passage from 460 BCE, demonstrates that it was a real concern. Even if the passage appears to give the practitioner free rein in these matters, the point is that they were acknowledged as an important consideration. If a person wants to purify himself from attacking ghosts [elasteroi], he is to call on the ghost wherever he wants and at whatever point in the year he wants and in whatever month he wants and on whatever day he wants and facing in whatever direction he wants.709 For other spiritual creatures, especially spirits and demons, time of the year, day, and direction of evocation were more important issues than they apparently were for ghosts, presumably because ghosts were not bound to a specific direction or time. In Egyptian magic (and religion) facing the rising or setting sun is a very common prerequisite of a rite. At night the ancient Egyptians had other cosmological points of reference, such as the direction of Sirius (Sothis), Orion or of the Pole Star with its attendant circling Bear asterism (Ursa Major). Conjuration made to the four quarters (where direction is critical) is a method utilised in the PGM and the later grimoires. In one PGM rite, the description of conjuration to the four quarters utilises the vocalisation of the seven sacred Greek vowels: The instruction: Speaking to the rising sun [east], stretching out your right hand to the left and your left hand likewise to the left, say “A [a once].”710 To the north, putting forward only your right fist, say “E [e twice].” Then to the west, extending both hands in front [of you], say “E [h three times].” To the south, [holding] both [hands] on your stomach, say, “I [i four times].” To the earth, bending over, touching the ends of your toes, say “O [o five times].” Looking into the air, having your hand on your heart, say “Y [u six times].” Looking into the sky, having both hands on your head, say “O [w seven times]:”.711 Because of its obvious importance as a ritual action instruction, this description is followed in the papyrus by a diagram relating the vowels to the directions, which makes it clear that the letters were repeated a specific sequentially increasing number of times (see Figure 03).712   709 Selinus, Lex sacra (eds.

It can be seen that the scribe accidently wrote HHH twice instead of HHH and IIII. After a short diversion, which looks like an interpolation, the text resumes with the cardinal directions invocation: “I call on you as the south.” (Looking to the south say, “i oo uuu wwww aaaaa eeeeee hhhhhhh.”)718 “I call on you as the west.” (Stand [facing] the west, say, “e ii ooo uuuu wwwww aaaaaa eeeeeee.”) “I call on you as the north.” (Standing looking towards the north say, “w aa eee hhhh iiiii oooooo uuuuuuu.”) “I call on you as the earth.”(Looking towards the earth say, “e hh iii oooo uuuuu wwwwww aaaaaaa.”) “I call on you as the sky.” (Looking into the sky say, “u ww aaa eeee hhhhh iiiiii ooooooo.”) “I call on you as the cosmos,” “o uu www aaaa eeeee hhhhhh iiiiiii.” Accomplish for me [the] NN thing quickly. I call on your name, the greatest among gods.”719 Notice that although the vowels are used in different sequences, according to the direction, the pattern of saying each vowel first once, then twice, then thrice, etc., persists. The four directions of the universe and the location of the four angels (or later the four Demon Kings),720 play an important part in magic, both from the point of view of marking out the boundary of a protective circle, and establishing directions for the magician to face for evocation. The equivalent Egyptian ‘angels’ of the four directions are mentioned in one 3rd century papyrus: 721 For I do this on order from PANCHOUCHI THASSOU at whose order you are to act, because I conjure you by the four regions of the universe, APSAGAĒL CHACHOU MERIOUT MERMERIOUT and by the one who is above the four regions of the universe, KICH MERMERIOUTH.722 A few lines below this, the names of three of the four angels of the directions are spelled slightly differently: ACHACHAĒL CHACHOU ... MARMARIOUTI. This rite involves the Bear asterism, which relates to the turning of the Earth on its axis, and therefore also relates to the four cardinal directions.723   718 The vowel strings are here rendered back into Greek. 719 PGM XIII. 856-871. Line breaks have been inserted to clarify the structure of the invocation. 720 See chapter 5.2.2. 721 Dating from Brashear (1995), p. 3492. 722 PGM VII. 478-490. 723 It is not entirely clear if these four names are of the directions or of the angels ruling them."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 On the other hand for invocations of the Bear asterism,724 it was customary to turn to the North, which is its position in the sky near the North Pole.725 One dream-producing rite specifies specific cardinal directions to face during the course of the ritual: After sunset raise the first [reed], look to the east and say three times: “MASKELLI MASKELLŌ... Raise the second [reed] to the south and say again the “MASKELLI” formula...; hold the reed and spin around; look towards the north and [then] the west and say three times the same names, [as] those of the second reed. Raise the third [reed] and say the same names and these things: “IĒ IĒ,726 I am picking you for such-and–such a rite.”727 Although the procedure of calling to the quarters is repeated in later grimoires, the specific names used in the PGM are not. The procedure of evoking specific spiritual creatures from each of the four quarters is present in chapter 42 of the Hygromanteia, ‘Conjurations of the demons of the four quarters.’ Each cardinal direction probably originally had 30 demons attributed to it, but over the course of time the names of some have been lost. Conjurations directed to the four quarters of the world in the Hygromanteia728 are a very distinct part of the conjuration process which relies upon the rulership of the four Demon Kings. Their names are derived from Jewish rather than Egyptian sources (with the exception of the first one): Loutzipher (East), Asmodai (North), AstarKth (West) and Berzeboul (South).729 The first name in each of the full lists of demons was the Demon King. Originally these may have been demons of the four winds, but later they became associated with the direction rather than the wind.730 The theory is that if these Kings are successfully conjured then their name can be used to motivate or threaten any of the lesser spirits in their retinue from that quarter. Many of the names of the demons of the four quarters derive from the Testament of Solomon. As documented by Greenfield, the list of the 36 decan demons in the Testament includes five demons of the west, six of the north and one of the south who appear in the Hygromanteia. Of   724 Ursa Minor. 725 See PDM xiv. 117. Strangely, in the same passage, it is recommended that the magician should retire to a dark room that opens to the south. 726 The name of the magician is to be inserted here. 727 PGM IV. 3172-3208. 728 Chapter 42. 729 These four occur repeatedly in later grimoires, but often with their directions interchanged. Grimoires like the Grimorium Verum even allocate whole continents to these four: Europe (Lucifer), America (Astaroth), Africa (Beelzebuth) and Asia (Asmodai?). 730 The octagonal Tower of the Winds or Horologion, which still stands in Athens, bears witness to the ancient preoccupation with specific winds and their directions. ‘Wind’ is also related to ‘spirit’ in both Greek (pneuma) and Hebrew (ruach)."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 the seven female demons of the Pleiades to be found in the Testament, three also appear as demons of the east in the Hygromanteia.731 The presence of demons from that 1st/2nd century text argues for the persistence of such names and the historically early roots of the Hygromanteia. The conjuration to the four directions in the Hygromanteia invites all of the named spirits to come, although it is not made clear if only the conjuration to one direction is to be performed, or if the entire 120 spirits are being conjured. It is therefore not surprising that the text then states that: After this conjuration you will see them coming like a regiment. Do not loose courage, but tell them to stand outside the circle...732 The approach is quite different from either the PGM or the later Latin grimoires, where only one or a few spirits are called at a time. The four Hygromanteia Demon Kings are Loutzipher,733 Asmedai, Astarōth and Beelzeboul.734 Asmodeus has always been a demon, but Ashtaroth and Beelzebub were ancient Semitic gods. These Demon Kings continue to appear in the Latin grimoires plus a number of later vernacular grimoires.735 The Demon Kings also feature in the grimoire of St Cyprian, the Clavis Inferni,736 where they are the subject of very unusual illustrations, showing them in animal form. These animal images (such as the bear) were later used in some German Faustian grimoires,737 but otherwise had little currency in European grimoires. One Demon King, Vercan (or Varcan), in the 16th century grimoire shown in Figure 04 stands confidently in a circle surrounded by five archers aiming at him, and a number of snakes and other creatures looking at him menacingly. In addition, he has two incense burners producing much incense smoke. He holds in his hand either a torch or a wand, and is crowned and clad in heavy armour. How are we to interpret this? He is not perturbed by the threats surrounding him. The only other figure that comes to mind as holding snakes and other venomous creatures without any apparent care is Harpocrates.   731 Greenfield (1988), pp. 220-230. 732 H, f. 37. 733 Sometimes corrupted to Lotropheres, Asmadegi, Astathor, Berzeboeul (in B, f. 24v). 734 And their later replacements Paimon, Maymon, Oriens and Egyn. 735 Barachiel who is cited as the commander of their troops, often accompanies them.

Urieus as portrayed in the Clavis Inferni (see Figure 05) suggestively connects with the ouroboros, which was the form of the Egyptian protective circle. Vercan (in Figure 04) has some similarity to the serpent holding Egyptian images of Harpocrates. Directional conjuration also occurs in the Clavicula Salomonis and other Latin Grimoires. See especially Clavis Inferni, which despite its title is a Solomonic grimoire.742 One possible interpretation of that often repeated grimoire specification that a particular ritual must be performed at a “crossroads,” is not that it should take place at a point of maximum vehicular traffic, which could be very disturbing to say the least. What it really means is that the circle should be orientated so there are clear lines of access to each of the four cardinal points, so that invocations can be performed towards those directions. The “roads” referred to are the spirit roads by which the Demon Kings, and their retinue, should arrive at the circle when called.743 The four Demon Kings feature in many versions of the Clavicula Salomonis and some of the German grimoires. If we rely upon the Hygromanteia to give the correct cardinal direction attributions of the Demon Kings, then the pattern is: Lucifer (East), Asmodai (North), Astaroth (West) and Beelzebub (South). However, many of these names and directions get mixed up in later grimoires, for no apparent reason, with almost no two Latin or vernacular grimoires agreeing upon what these directions should be.744 A representative sample of alternate names would include: Oriens. Obviously Oriens would have been located in the East (as the name is derived from the Latin oriens = East). However, the spelling of this Demon King ‘Urieus’/ ’Oraeus’ in the Clavis Inferni suggests that ‘Oriens’ may have been a scribal confusion with the Latin direction for east, and this King should instead be called Urieus, with a possible derivation from the Egyptian Uraeus serpent. As if to confirm this, he is also portrayed in the Clavis Inferni as a crowned Ouroboros serpent, giving a clear indication of his possible Egyptian provenance (see Figure 05).   742 Skinner and Rankine (2009), pp. 44-45, where the four Demon Kings of the directions include Urieus. The latter is a name probably derived from the Egyptian serpent. 743 Antonio da Montolmo (f. 1390), in his De Occultis et Manifestis confirms that “From this I deduce as a consequence the reason for the performance of conjurations in places where...four roads come together: because of the concordance...with the places [directions] of the Intelligences under the heavens; they are constituted in the manner of a crossroad of four roads, as it appears in the Principles of Astrology.” See Weill-Parot (2012), p. 241. 744 See Skinner (2006) Tables M62 and M63."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 Maymon. In an illustration of Maymon from about 1600 CE,745 he is portrayed as a double-headed bird, standing in front of a four-legged bird-like creature with a long curly tail.746 Maymon may be a form of the Arabic Maymon, the jinn king of Saturn. Amaymon is likely to be simply a corruption of Maymon. It is possible that the other Demon Kings also came from Egyptian or Arabic sources. There are other sets of Demon King names. In the Goetia, Ziminiar/Zimimay rules the North; Corson/Gorson rules the West; Goap/Gaap rules the South. Paymon is attributed in most other texts to the West, or the South, whilst Egyn/Egin/Aegyn/ Egym also rules the South or the West. There has obviously been a lot of confusion in the transmission of these directional rulerships. A table of these conflicting attributions which also shows their relationship to the Hebrew demon princes (Samael [S], Azazel [E], Azael [W] and Mahazael [N]) can be found in The Complete Magician’s Tables.747 In The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage,748 there are also four Demon Kings, but here only Lucifer is recognizable from the Hygromanteia.749 In the Grimorium Verum, which is a derivative of the UT Text-Group of the Key of Solomon, three Kings are present but not Asmodai. It is therefore clear that the idea of the four Demon Kings is a long running part of magic, but with considerable name corruption and orientational confusion over time. Their continued presence in the later grimoires also underlines the importance of the four quarters, as a part of the magician’s cosmological structure. In the Latin West in the late 16th century the system became more complicated, and with a general rise in interest in the compass, the directions attributable to individual spirits reached new heights of precision. Several ‘spirit compass roses’ were divided into as many as 32 different directions. Facing the direction from which the spirit was supposed to arrive was an important condition of a successful invocation. In several European grimoires, this resulted in a floor circle design with a separate spirit triangle which could be moved and placed at the correct direction, which would then vary from spirit to spirit.   745 See Figure 04. 746 See Figure 02. 747 Skinner (2006), Tables M62-M65. 748 Mathers (1900) and Dehn (2006). 749 Abraham von Worms, (1900), p. 119."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 Figure 07: Theurgia, a 1583 manuscript showing the Martial spirits for each of the cardinal directions.750 Note the bracketed text in the lower register listing spirits by the four directions: ad orientem, ad occidentem, ad septentrionem and ad meridian (sic).751   750 Theurgia.

The clearest example of such a ‘spirit compass’ is to be found in the first few pages of the Solomonic grimoire Theurgia-Goetia.752 The name of this grimoire clearly suggests a Greek origin, although many of the spirits listed obviously have a Hebrew origin, because of the many spirit names with an ‘-iel’ suffix. It is unusual that the compass below is orientated with SSE at the top of the page, rather than North, suggesting that this may have reflected the orientation of the room actually used by that scribe for evocation.   752 Skinner and Rankine (2007), p. 212."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 Figure 08: Two ‘spirit compass roses’ in the Theurgia-Goetia, dated 1687 (previous page) and 1713.753 Both the ‘spirit compass roses’ show the four seasons (and Elements) in their central circle.

The use of time intervals, and specific entities, qualities and objectives associated with each hour, is therefore one of the clearest commonalities and traceable transmissions between these three sets of magical handbooks. Timing has always been a very important element of magical preparation, and a mistake in timing has often been given as the reason for the failure of a magical operation. A passage in the letter of Thessalos of Tralles (1st century CE) written to the Emperor (Caesar Augustus or Claudius) explains the essential nature of good timing in a magical operation, or even in the collecting of herbs for magico-medicinal purposes: Soon the god appeared in a spectacular vision and spoke to Thessalos, telling him that the book of king Nechepso was of limited use, because it required supplementary knowledge of the correct times at which to harvest the herbs – knowledge that could only be acquired directly from Asclepios himself.755 One of the three completely self-contained books in the PGM which relates more closely to the Mysteries than to magic, is the pseudepigraphical Tenth Hidden Book of Moses.756 Even in the context of an initiatory rite, it was also considered important for the initiate to be equipped with the names of the rulers of the time when the rite was being performed, the ruler of the hour, day and month, before beginning the rite: You should also take, child, for this personal vision, [a list of] the gods of the days and the hours and the weeks, those given in the book, and the twelve rulers of the months...757 Planetary Days The idea that each of the seven Classical planets has a day dedicated to it, goes back a long way. The Indian tradition of attributing seven gods to the seven days of the week probably dates back to Vedic times. Babylonian practices also enshrine exactly the same days for the same corresponding planets. This system is also found in Jewish sources, and the Greek gods of the planets are used instead of the day names in the Hygromanteia. It is not possible to establish the origin of this practice, but it is extraordinary that the attributions are consistent across a number of cultures, and even more extraordinary, that each planet falls on exactly the same calendar day, in all cultures. The day of the Moon, for example, falls on Monday in all cultures, so that the day sacred to Mars (Roman) or Aries (Greek) is the same days as that attributed to Madim (Hebrew) or Mangal (Hindu).   755 See Codex Matritensis Bibl. Nat. 4631.

Proclus, for example, affirmed that “general opinion makes the Hours goddesses and the Month a god, and their worship has been handed on to us.”758 These attributions as well as having calendrical significance also have great importance for the practice of magic, especially Solomonic magic. Precise timing of magical rites was always considered a crucial ingredient of Solomonic magic. Not only must the right day be chosen, according to its planetary attribution (for example rites of the Moon on Monday, or of Venus on Friday), but also the hour must be chosen with care. As the first hour of every day (that is the hour immediately after sunrise) is attributed to the same planet as the whole day, so sunrise is always a potent time, it being doubly attributed to the planet/god of the day. In many examples in the PGM, the sunrise hour was recommended for specific rites. Unequal Hours The technique was refined even further so that each day was divided into 24 hours, not equal clock hours as we understand them, but unequal ‘planetary hours.’ No matter where you are in the world, the timing of dawn and dusk change from day-to-day (extremely at the poles and very little at the Equator). The basic principle was that the 24 hours of the day were divided into 12 daylight hours and 12 night hours. The starting point is respectively sunrise and sunset. After the first hour of every day which is attributed to the same planet that rules the day, the following hours rotate in sequence. For example, on Sunday (after the first hour attributed to the Sun) come the hours of Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, and starting the cycle again with the Sun (in the 8th hour of the day). So the timing of the evocation of the spirit of Mars would be preferably performed on a day of Mars in an hour of Mars (for example Tuesday on the 1st, 8th, 15th or 22nd hour, counting from dawn). The number of minutes from sunrise to sunset is divided by 12, giving the number of minutes in each ‘planetary hour.’ This will be longer than 60 minutes in summer, but shorter in winter. This number of minutes is then used to count off the hours. These unequal ‘hours’ came to be known, in later grimoires, as ‘planetary hours.’ The planetary hours were also used for civil purposes in Europe until cheap clocks were generally available, but retained in Europe for magic long after the common usage reverted to clock time with an exact 60 minutes.759   758 Proclus, In Timaeum, 248 D. 759 The logic of using unequal hours is that without mechanical clocks, the hour can only be estimated by looking at the angle of elevation of the sun above the horizon. Regardless of the length of the day, the angle of the sun for a specific hour will always be the same. On short days the sun will appear to"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 The Moon’s Effect In addition to the selection of hour and day, it was considered necessary to choose the right Moon phase. For works of construction, the Moon should be waxing (that is increasing in size from New to Full) rather than waning or shrinking (suitable for works of destruction). It is also suggested in some grimoires that the Moon should not be located too close to the Sun, where astrologically it will be rendered 'combust,’ which is said to diminish its powers considerably. These rules relate to the belief that the spirits and demons belonged to the ‘sublunary regions,’ and were therefore affected by the Moon in the same ways that tides are governed by that satellite. These considerations of time are common to the PGM, Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis, with the names of the respective gods/planets remaining unchanged. Only the angels and demon names changed. Because of the many close parallels and commonalities between the treatment of timing in these three texts, the rest of this chapter will not be ordered by period or source (as is the case in the rest of chapter 5) but will be ordered in the following sequence: hours, days, months and Moon phases. The gods of the day and its hour are very important in Graeco-Egyptian magic, for it was said that any magician who does not first call these gods and propitiate them will have no luck in his operation, because he will be considered by any god to be “uninitiated.” The 168 Hours of the Week Although the cycle of planetary days probably dates back to the Babylonians, the attribution of specific qualities to each of the (7 x 24) 168 hours760 is first seen, as far as I know, in the works of the astrologer Hēliodōros (fl. 415 CE).761 As if to drive home this association, this text is actually included in part in manuscript N of the Hygromanteia,762 which dates from 1495. As these particular timing tables are integral to the method of the Hygromanteia, it is a strong indication, as has already been mentioned, that the Hygromanteia post dates the 4th century CE.763       travel faster but, for example, it will always be 30° above the eastern horizon at the end of the 2nd planetary hour, or 30° above the western horizon at the end of the 10th planetary hour, whatever the season or latitude. 760 M, f. 240-243. It also appears in at least seven other manuscripts of the Hygromanteia. 761 Another procedure in the Hygromanteia comes from Hēliodōrus, the procedure for consecrating a skull (M2, f. 225). 762 N, ff. 389-391v. 763 There is a second possibility that the tables of planetary days and hours in the Hygromanteia might have come from pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana’s Apotelesmata.

Some of these natural history correspondences appear again later in European grimoires, and in Agrippa’s early 16th century De Occulta Philosophia.771 The God of the Hour Even the gods have their hourly schedule. It was suggested, for example, that the magician invoke Apollo in the third hour of the day.772 Several passages in the PGM list the all important names of the gods of the hours (see Table 08), although the names differ according to the magician or text.773        they may have been the contributing source.

The first kind lists between one and seven angels, and between one and three demons per planet. The second kind lists an angel and a demon for each and every hour of every day of the week.786 Strangely there does not seem to be much in the way of common names between the two lists, so presumably they come from different sources, rather than one being an abbreviation of the other.787 The long list exists in most manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, as it is central to the method of invocation.788 The folio reproduced in Figure 09 shows the angels (in the left column) and the demons (right column) of Sunday, at the top of the list. The table for Monday continues below the line. The Greek alphabet is used to number the hours. For example, the angel of the 1st Hour (\u0002) on Monday is Gabriēl (\b\u0002\u001d\u000326\u0010).789 The short version of the table of planetary hours (i.e. that omitting the exact function of each hour) found in the Hygromanteia (Figure 09) comprises a vital part of later Latin Clavicula Salomonis, especially the Abraham Colorno Text-Group (AC) of manuscripts (see Figure 10 for an example). Marathakis concludes “that this section in the Magical Treatise [the Hygromanteia] is the source for every [later Solomonic] grimoire that uses the planetary hours.”790 Various qualities were attached to these hours, of which one of the most important was the specification of what sort of magic would be most successful in a particular hour. For example in the Hygromanteia,791 the 3rd hour [Jupiter] of Monday [Moon] is good “for opening a workshop, but the 1st hour [Mars] of Tuesday [Mars] is good for “war and victory.”792   786 H has both kinds, the short list (at f. 23v), and the long list beginning on f. 41v. 787 Comparative tables of angels and demons for every one of the 168 hours of the week are listed in Marathakis (2011), pp. 55-68.

Where planetary hours are listed in European grimoires, the names of the hours (Beron, Yayn, etc.) are usually derived from Hebrew rather than Greek. The tables in the Hygromanteia are considerably more detailed than those in the Latin grimoires, as they also list the demons as well as the angels of each hour. The planetary sequence of each hour is however identical, e.g. Sunday: 1st hour – Sun; 2nd – Venus; 3rd – Mercury, and so on, for the rest of the 168 hours of the full week. Where the tables do diverge is in the names of the angels, which are the familiar Michael, Anael, Raphael, Gabriel, Cassiel, Sachiel and Samael in the Key of Solomon. However in the Hygromanteia, the sequence is Mikhaēl, Arphanaēl, Pelouēl, IKraēl, Piel, Kokhth and Pal. Only the first (Mikhaēl) and part of the second (Arph-anaēl) angel are identical. The insistence on using the correct planetary hour and day is however the same in both texts. Manuscript A is more specific about the use of these hours for the performance of specific magical operations.795 Manuscript G and M give much more detail in a tabular form extending over eight folios.796 The precise description of what type of operation should be done in each hour has not survived in many later Latin grimoires. A random selection of such detailed data from the Hygromanteia is listed below: Day of the Sun 15th Hour of the Sun For sending dreams to a king Day of the Moon 11th Hour of Mars For preventing luck Day of Mars 12th Hour of the Moon For despoiling slain enemies Day of Mercury 4th Hour of Jupiter For practising alchemy Day of Jupiter 12th Hour of Mercury For emigrating far away Day of Venus 2nd Hour of Mercury For messages of matchmaking Day of Venus 4th Hour of Saturn For causing obstacles of love Here there is a slight cross-over with astral magic, where the practice of making eikones is introduced. The eikones or images of the planets specified in chapter 10 of the Hygromanteia were to be created on the correct day and at the correct hour. This is the day and hour when the appropriate planet rules, while the Sun and the Moon must also be located in a zodiacal sign ruled by the same planet.797 The English Key of Solomon preserves the regard for precise timing, and gives a table of each of the hours for each day of the week,798 with the names of angels attributed to each of those   795 A, f. 3-4v. 796 G, f. 13v-21; M, f. 240-243. 797 This however only occurs in three manuscripts: B, A and P3.

The attributions of these hours were sometimes considered a secret, as they were thought to be one of the keys to successful invocation.799 Days One very specific day is mentioned in the PDM which is used as a threat by the magician to prevent the return of a spirit to its heaven. This is just one illustration of the importance of specific days to the Graeco-Egyptian magician. The words are addressed by the magician to the spirit, to ensure its obedience: “‘Do the every command which NN [the magician] will desire!’ Is not doing it what you will do, O noble spirit?800 [If so] your soul will not be allowed to rise up to heaven on day 25 of the fourth month of Inundation to dawn of day 26, while the excellent spirits are awake.”801 Anubis is requested to send the spirit, and the spirit is commanded to go to the target of the rite and tell him, whilst sleeping, that he is to “Do the every command which NN [the magician] will desire!” The punishment for the spirit failing to do this is that the spirit will be prevented from returning to heaven “on day 25 of the fourth month of Inundation [through] to dawn of day 26.”802 From this passage we may deduce that there was a specific day that was considered to be the time when spirits were allowed (temporarily) to return to their heaven, and that to prevent them from doing so was a form of punishment inflicted (or threatened) by the magician. Even in a simple Graeco-Egyptian lamp skrying, the request is to “bring me the god in whose hand the command803 is today.”804 This is the ‘duty’ god, of which there are 365 in the course of the year, the names of which were a closely guarded secret. This restriction is particularly prevalent in the Demotic PDM. For example, one invocation refers specifically to the god of the day or the hour: Send to me the god in whose hand the command is [today] so that he may tell me an answer to everything about which I am asking here today.805 Another passage mentions “the god who gives answer today” confirming that there is also a daily rota of gods, and it befits the magician to know which one is in charge of the day on   799 Antonio da Montolmo (f. 1390), in his De Occultis et Manifestis warns “I keep silent about the hours, so that unworthy people may not put their souls in danger” by succeeding in magical operations.

One invocation prescribes “the rising of the moon on the thirtieth day.”823 The 7th hour of the moon is mentioned in another passage:   818 These would of course have been Egyptian months, rather than zodiac signs. The two are not exactly equal, but it was rendered so by the translator. 819 Astral magic also considers the Moon in the 28 Lunar Mansions, and even the action of each of the 360 degrees of the heavens. 820 PGM III. 275-81. 821 PGM VII. 284-99. 822 PGM xiv. 1003-14. 823 PGM III. 335."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 Start saying the aforementioned invocation at the 7th hour of the moon, until the god hearkens to you, and you make contact with him.824 The implication is that persistence in the correct hour will bring success. One Demotic bowl skrying/vessel enquiry states that it should be performed “from the fourth day of the lunar month until the fifteenth day, which is the half-month when the moon fills the sound-eye.”825 The full moon is the ‘sound eye’ of Horus. In other words it should be performed during a waxing moon, a specification which is repeated in the Hygromanteia and again in almost all European grimoires. Another invocation of Helios suggests the best lunar days to encounter the god: ...His encounter with Helios [takes place] on the 2nd [lunar day], but the invocation itself is spoken when [the previous moon] is full. But you will accomplish a better encounter at [sun]rise on the 4th [lunar day], when the god is on the [increase]...826 Specific months are also beneficial for specific rites. For example, in one invocation of Imhotep (the deified Pharaoh) it is said that “you will do the ‘god’s arrival’827 [best] while the moon is in Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, or Virgo.”828 Necromancy and Libra are connected in PGM III. 278, as they are also connected in the Goetia. The Moon and its passage through the zodiac have always been important for judging the correct time for a magical operation. It also yields an excellent example of continuity across all three periods under consideration. A lunarium or electional astrology passage is to be found in all three texts: the PGM, the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis, where it provides details of what is obtainable by the magician dependant on the zodiacal sign currently occupied by the Moon.829 In the PGM the rules are: Orbit of the moon:830 Moon in Virgo: anything is rendered obtainable. In Libra: necromancy. In Scorpio: anything inflicting evil. In Sagittarius: an invocation or incantations to the sun and moon. In Capricorn: say whatever you wish for best results. In Aquarius: for a love charm. [In] Pisces: for foreknowledge. In Aries: fire divination [lamp skrying] or love charm.   824 PGM II. 42-43. 825 PDM xiv. 295. 826 PGM VI. 1-47. 827 In Egyptian peh-netjer. Operations of the rite type ‘G.’ 828 PDM Supp. 184.

When the Moon is in Libra, it is good for making love and for taking <a girl’s> virginity, that is to say, to harvest the blood.834 When the Moon is in Scorpio, at the first day, do not go out and do not walk on a street, because it is dangerous. <If you go out> at the second day, you will not return. When the Moon is in Sagittarius, it is good for watching chariot races.835 It is also good for appearing before lords [to request favours]...836 The same lunarium material also occurs in the Clavicula Salomonis: For those matters then which appertain unto the Moon, such as the Invocation of Spirits, the Works of Necromancy, and the recovery of stolen property, it is necessary that the Moon should be in a Terrestrial Sign, viz.:- Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn. For love, grace, and invisibility, the Moon should be in a Fiery Sign, viz.:- Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius. For hatred, discord, and destruction, the Moon should be in a Watery Sign, viz.:- Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces. For experiments of a peculiar nature, which cannot be classed under any certain head, the Moon should be in an Airy Sign, viz.:- Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius.837 This is an excellent example of commonality between all three texts. The zodiacal sign in which the Moon currently resides was also thought to be of more importance than the presence of the Sun in a particular sign. The latter remains there for a month rather than the two-and-a-half days of the Moon’s transit through a sign. Such electional astrology, dependant on the Moon’s position in a particular zodiacal sign, can be directly paralleled with the PGM papyrus quoted above. Specific restrictions, such as Virgo being held by both sources to be good to “do anything you want,” and Scorpio is held to be uniformly bad, appear in all three texts. Another more general specification for skrying by means of a lamp is:   831 PGM VII. 284-99. See also PGM III. 275-81 which is contradictory, less detailed and fragmentary. 832 Chapters 7 and 30. 833 Line breaks have been introduced for clarity. 834 This is an interesting sidelight on why a magician might wish to seduce many virgins. 835 This is a confirmation that this manuscript probably predates 1204, when the last chariot race was held in Constantinople. The races were interrupted by the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in that year. 836 B, f. 2. See also H, f. 49v.

The Moon waxing in Aries or Taurus841 was the condition required for making a love charm which utilised an appeal to Typhon.842 The specification of the four key points of the day (relative to the sun) of sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight was a specifically Egyptian phenomenon, and related to the passage of Ra over the heavens and under the Earth. These are sometimes referred to as ‘Sun Stations.’ For the practice of divination, for example, auspicious times of the day were listed for every day of the lunar month. Sun station Day of the Lunar cycle The whole day 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 27, 28, 29 At dawn 1, 4, 5, 14, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24 At noon 2, 7 Afternoon 11, 18, 21, 22, 26, 30 Do not use 3, 6, 9, 16, 17, 25 Table 14: Correspondence between the Sun Station and the day of the Lunar cycle. For example, an invocation of the Bear asterism (Ursa Minor) should be done facing north, but specifically on the third day of the lunar month. Whereas the 14th day of the lunar month is recommended for the performance of a love spell.843 These sections on astrological timing are sometimes taken from other works on astrology. For example chapter 7 in manuscript N is said to be from “a Persian philosopher called Zanatēs,” or more correctly from the geomancy expert Abū ‘Abdallāh Muhammad az-Zanāti, a North African from the late 12th or early 13th century.844 On the whole N has the most detailed astrological sections. This is not surprising, as the objective of the Hygromanteia is instruction in magic, for which astrological knowledge is essential, rather than astrology   838 Or “when it is full” in another text. 839 PGM V. 49-53. 840 PGM V. 379-380. 841 The Moon is exalted in Taurus, but the rationale for Aries is not so obvious. 842 It uses the blood of a black ass, sacred to Typhon.

This borrowing from astrological texts (as in the case of az-Zanāti) also helps in the dating of redactional activity. Other conditions relating to the Moon also need to be fulfilled. For the main evocation rite, the Hygromanteia recommends a time “when the Sun is in opposition to the Moon,” and on “the fourteenth day of the Moon,” in other words at the Full Moon.845 Planets are more important, for zodiac signs are simply seen as the setting against which the planets move, and they receive whatever qualities they have mainly from their ruling planets.846 Therefore, the zodiac signs themselves have no particular magical application. It was not till Campanella (1568-1639) that any magician attempted to invoke or pray to a zodiacal sign,847 as opposed to prayers to the planets which are well attested from the earliest times. Nevertheless the Hygromanteia gives details of the manufacture of talismans under the influence of each zodiacal sign (chapters 4 and 5), in a method similar to astral magic, but with the addition of an invocation in each case. The 28 Mansions of the Moon Chapter 6 of the Hygromanteia covers the types of magical operations that should be carried out on each of the Moon’s 28/29 day cycle. One might expect special attention to be paid to the 1st (New Moon), 14th (Full Moon) and last day (Dark Moon), but it is not markedly so in the Hygromanteia. Even the general rule (prominent in the Latin grimoires) of waxing Moon for constructive aims, but waning Moon for destructive aims is not consistently observed in the Hygromanteia, as it is later in the Clavicula Salomonis. For example: The first day of the Moon For winning in gambling, in chess and in other games... Fifteenth day For speaking with demons. Twenty third day For fishing. Twenty seventh day For love and for bindings of love. Twenty ninth day For destruction.848 5.2.4 Purity and Sexual Abstinence The specification of ritual purity via chastity was almost universal in ancient magic. The modern Western use of sex in magic (following supposed Tantric practice) is an exception that does not appear in the PGM, Hygromanteia or Clavicula Salomonis. As Samson Eitrem wrote: Ritual “cleanliness” or “purity” is everywhere [in magic] the overall important prerequisite...849   845 Chapter 36. 846 H, f. 22v-23. 847 See Walker (1958) for a description of Campanella’s 1628 invocation of Jupiter, Venus and zodiacal signs with and for the benefit of Pope Urban VIII. 848 A, f. 5v."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 For Solomonic ritual magic purity was an essential ingredient. This is not some latterly introduced Calvinist “cleanliness is next to godliness” imposition, but is a condition that goes all the way back to Graeco-Egyptian magic, and before in dynastic Egypt. It was well established in the PGM that the magician needs to have high standards of personal cleanliness, wear clean cotton clothes, preferably new and use only instruments that have been either made new, or bought new.850 What was the point of all this purity? It was to give the magician the purity and holiness to approach the gods and other spiritual creatures. The theory offered in the PGM was that the gods would reject an impure man, and not hear his request. In later Christianised grimoires it gave the magician extra protection against demons, on the basis that if he were not ‘corrupted’ then they could not easily overcome him. This translates into a number of techniques which were passed from one culture to another. Sexual abstinence was not only enjoined on the magician, but virginity was imposed upon his skryer. Chastity is of course imposed upon the priests of many religions. For the magician a period of three, seven or nine days before was advised as a period of sexual abstinence. This abstinence is to a large part tied to the idea of purity, and to lie with a woman who was having her period was thus completely forbidden. Sexual abstinence was specified for Egyptian priests, but only for the relatively short time they were actually serving in the temple. There was a system of rotation of priests, which entailed service for three separate months in every year, and they were not obliged to observe sexual abstinence when living with their families outside the confines of the temple in between these periods. In addition women who are menstruating are forbidden to enter the temple. Similar thinking also goes into current Hindu practice. In this case, menstruation is seen as the other end of the continuum of sexual purity/impurity. As often Egyptian priests were also magicians, the rules applied to the magician as well. Other forms of bodily purity were enforced. One practice which has not carried through into later magic is the practice of shaving off all the bodily hair. Purity was also specified for operations of lamp skrying where the magician should be:        849 Faraone and Obbink (1991), p. 177. 850 Later grimoires would also insist that such tools that were bought, must be bought without haggling. The later is an instruction from a number of Latin grimoires, but it shows the extreme length to which magicians would go, so as to not even slightly besmirch the purity of the instrument they were buying, by arguing over it."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 Robed and refraining from all unclean things and from all eating of fish851 and from all sexual intercourse, so that you may bring the god into the greatest desire toward you.852 This is a very telling passage as it shows that the original objective of purification before a magical ritual was not just to make the human acceptable to the infinitely more refined god, but actually to make the operator desirable to the god. One bowl skrying/vessel enquiry utilises a virgin boy as a skryer, describing him as “a pure youth who has not yet gone with a woman.”853 This is not only the concern of Jewish or Christian magicians, but dates right back to the Demotic papyri of Egyptian magicians. As one Egyptian magician wrote: If you do not purify it, it does not come about. Purity is its chief factor.854 In fact, this is one of the invariable constants within the magical tradition. Just one example amongst many, taken at random, illustrates this rule as it was applied by Graeco-Egyptian magicians: For direct vision, set up a tripod and a table of olive wood or of laurel wood... Cover the tripod with clean linen, and place a censer on the tripod... It is necessary to keep yourself pure for three days in advance... [If] you wish [to see], look inside, wearing clean [white] garments [and crowned] with a crown of laurel...855 Repeatedly ‘clean’, ‘white’ and ‘pure’ are specified. The use of a tripod by skryers and prophets is also a long running feature of magic: from the PGM magicians, via the pythoness at Eleusis to the French seer Nostradamus.856 Purity and preparation are even more explicit in the Hygromanteia. Chapters 31 and 40 cover the preparatory moral conduct of the magician, which includes purificatory baths, prayer, sexual abstinence and fasting. These procedures may seem strange to those who subscribe to the popular view of magic, which associates it with the opposite of all those qualities, with hellish doings and with morally degrading trappings. However, Solomonic ritual magic invariably stipulates purity of lifestyle immediately prior to the rite. In a Christian environment, spiritual purity also implies confession of any sins, which also became part of the grimoire procedure in the Christian era. A full confession of sins real and imaginary is recommended before commencing.857   851 There is an element here of the belief that drowning in the Nile immortalises the creature so drowned. The taboo on eating fish in ancient Egypt is also covered by Darby, Food: the Gift of Osiris, I, pp. 380-404. 852 PGM I. 290-292. 853 PDM xiv. 67-68. 854 PDM xiv. 515. 855 PGM III. 291-306. 856 Nostradamus mentions his use of the tripod in the first verses of his first Century of predictions. 857 Wellcome MS 4670, chapter 1."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 The Clavicula Salomonis echoes the same provision laid down in the Hygromanteia. In the Clavicula Salomonis, the magician was often advised to abstain from all sexual activity for a week to nine days before ritual. Abstinence for 40 days is not uncommon in much less complex procedures. Even accidental sexual emission is warned against. Graeco-Egyptian rites on the other hand only proscribed sexual activity for between three and seven days before. The main theoretical reasons why the magician prepares himself in this manner: i) To be in a state of ritual purity so that the spirits could approach the circle without difficulty or pain. ii) Ritual purity is important as a protection against the demons he may evoke, a certain degree of apparent spiritual superiority is necessary to enable him to command them. iii) The psychological rationale might be that the unburdening of the magician’s conscience would have removed distracting worries, leaving him free to concentrate upon the ritual. Physical purity is also enjoined, with prohibitions against the presence of urine, a menstruating woman or any other impurities: ...a secret room, into which no one else is able to enter, in particular girls and women, who can defile its cleanliness through their menses, which is a natural weakness... You should give your utmost attention not to allow any unclean chamber-pot to enter into the room, for this place should be immaculately clean in every way and should not be influenced by any unsanitary thing.858 Ritual purity, although important in the PGM, was not carried to such lengths, or given such importance as it was in Jewish practice. The fasting, abstinence, and so on, in the Clavicula Salomonis therefore probably also had some input from Jewish magical practice. The classical Jewish grimoire, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage,859 carries these preparations to much greater lengths, in one case six months.860 The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, enjoined preparation periods of prayer with strict observance of taboos and limiting of diet, social intercourse, etc. 5.2.5 Fasting and Food Prohibitions Fasting is a very important ingredient in magic in all periods. Typically a three or nine day fast, or bread and water diet,861 is recommended. This practice has a number of dimensions: i) Fasting purifies the body by allowing the gross matter to pass leaving the intestine   858 Wellcome MS 4670, pp. 7-8. 859 Mathers (1990). 860 Or 18 months in the case of the German manuscript, edited by Dehn (2006). 861 Four ounces of bread a day is recommended."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 empty. ii) Fasting promotes a sense of purpose and acts as a reminder of the intention of the operation over the days leading up to it. iii) Fasting is thought to purify spiritually, so that the magician is in a superior spiritual state. iv) It has sometimes been remarked that the spirits fear the spittle of a fasting man.862 Trachtenberg mentions that: Maimonides wrote, in his capacity of physician, that the spittle of a fasting person is hostile to poisons. In consequence of this belief charms to heal an ailment or to drive off demons or to counteract magic were usually prefaced by a threefold expectoration.863 v) A fasting man’s perceptions may be more refined, and hence more able to see the spirit presences.864 His ability to see and converse with them may be heightened by the fasting. This practice has deep roots in ancient Egyptian magic.865 Spittle is consistently used in such magic for creation in much the same way as semen. Spittle is also used in Egyptian magic to cure snake bites and scorpion stings. Food prohibitions for priests (which would have also mapped onto their magical practice) were complicated by the rules of the nome in which they lived.866 Thus in the nome of Oxyrhynchus they would be prohibited from eating the long-nosed fish of the same name. In Cynopolis they would be forbidden dog as food. Fish however seems to have been one of the most consistently forbidden foods, and this may relate to the Egyptian idea of the holiness of the Nile.867 Despite the fact that fish were normally part of the staple Egyptian diet, there are numerous references to the ritual uncleanliness of fish, and upon entering the temple, a devotee would often announce: “I am clean. I have not eaten fish...” The prohibition against eating fish however is also found in Babylonian texts: One of the more common proscriptions, that of eating fish and leeks, is on day 7 of month VII said to be prohibited by “Šulpae, lord of the date grove”...that is, Jupiter...868 Garlic was another common banned food. One method suggests the fast should run from the 11th day of the Moon, in order to finish on   862 Anyone who has lived in a Muslim country during Ramadan will understand what is meant here. 863 Trachtenberg (1939, 2004), p. 121.

The emphasis on regular bathing sounds more like something inherited from the ancient world rather than something typical of mediaeval Europe. Fasting was also very much a part of Egyptian spiritual practice so that Lucius Apuleius fasted for ten days before being initiated into the Mysteries of Isis.870 This event was undoubtedly part of the Mysteries rather than just an ordinary religious ceremony in the temple of Isis. As was the function of the Mysteries, he was introduced to the goddess at first hand: I approached the gods from below and from on high, I saw them face to face and I worshipped them near at hand.871   869 The fullest instructions are to be found in manuscript H. 870 Lucius Apuleius, The Golden Ass, Book XI: 23.

This was done in two main ways in the Solomonic method: by inscribing a floor circle around his area of working to protect him and his assistants, and by wearing a protective phylactery or lamen. 5.3.1 Circle of Protection The use of a protective magical circle is one of the defining elements of Solomonic magic. As such its presence is one of the main pieces of evidence of the transmission of Solomonic magical techniques over the temporal and geographic boundaries under discussion in this thesis. It is a particularly promising evidence of this transmission, because clear illustrations can be found in a succession of manuscripts, indicating its evolution over many centuries. Its analysis will therefore be accorded a disproportionate amount of space. Kieckhefer illustrates why the magician considered the protective circle so important: First, the circle is clearly seen as a protective enclosure. Caesarius872 elsewhere tells of a priest who steps outside the circle and is attacked to viciously by the Devil that he soon dies, and in yet another exemplum a necromancer’s client rushes from the circle in pursuit of a beautiful woman, only to have his neck wrung like that of a hen being slaughtered.873 The protective circle is a recurrent theme in magic, where the magician is attempting to evoke a spirit or daimon who might threaten his well-being, from Mesopotamian times to the present day, but only Solomonic magic prescribed the detailed inscription of god and angel names within that circle. It is certainly an essential part of Byzantine and Western European grimoires. Determining the ultimate origin of this protective circle has, however, been difficult. Other forms of magic like astral magic, village magic, or magic found in modern day primitive societies do not use a detailed drawn circle for the protection of the magician.874 Solomonic magic considered a circle essential to protect the magician and his assistants. Daimones, demons, spirits and even gods, needed to be kept at arms length, and this was achieved by drawing such a consecrated circle upon the ground, and keeping within it for the duration of the rite.   872 Caesarius of Heisterbach (c. 1180-1240). 873 Kieckhefer (2003), p. 174. He references D’Avray (1985), pp. 198-202 as the source of the second anecdote. 874 Modern Wicca utilises a circle only because its creator, Gerald Gardner took it from the Key of Solomon. It is not to be found in pre-20th century witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 Classical Indian magic in the Ramayana (dating from 4th to 5th century BCE) records an example of Lakshman drawing a circle on the ground to protect Sita from a demon, showing that this practice has very deep roots. In the event Sita was persuaded to cross the circle and so was taken by the demon Ravana. Early Mesopotamian Evidence The circle drawn upon the ground is probably the most ancient form of protection for the magician, and Ronald Hutton mentions an early form of the circle: An Assyrian rite has the magician make an usurtu, usually translated as a ring, of sprinkled lime around the images of deities on whom he is going to call.875 In the Assyrian texts, protective circles were drawn on the ground with a mixture of water and flour.876 These two substances were, respectively, sacred to Ea and Nisaba, water being the “shining waters of Ea” and the flour forming circle being the “net of Nisaba, the corn-god.” Campbell Thompson remarks that: It seems to have been the custom to fence about the patient (or perhaps [more likely] the magician) with a ring of flour or meal as a magic circle, just in the same way that the mediaeval sorcerers stood within a similar charmed ring when invoking spirits.877 The circle was then consecrated with the following lines: Ban! Ban! [O] Barrier that none can pass, Barrier878 of the gods, that none may break, Barrier of heaven and earth that none can change, Which no god may annul, Nor god nor man can loose, A snare without escape, set for evil, A net whence none can issue forth, spread for [against] evil.

A typical (Mesopotamian) blessing of the circle to be said before an evocation:   875 Hutton (2003), p. 164. 876 Modern voodoo vevas are also constructed by tracing out lines on the floor with flour. 877 Thompson (1908), p. 123. 878 Barrier = Uşurtu. Elsewhere Thompson concedes that Uşurtu might also be translated as ‘the magic circle, or perhaps ban’ or barrier (cf. Thompson (1908), p. xxiii).

[6] I resolved to go to Babylon and ask help from one of the Magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors; I had been told that by incantations and other rites they could open the gates of Hades, take down any one they chose in safety, and bring him up again. I thought the best thing would be to secure the services of one of these, visit Tiresias the Boeotian, and learn from that wise seer what is the best life and the right choice for a man of sense. I got up with all speed and started straight for Babylon. When I arrived, I found a wise and wonderful Chaldean; he was white-haired, with a long imposing beard, and called Mithrobarzanes. My prayers and supplications at last induced him to name a price for conducting me down [to Hades]. [7] Taking me under his charge, he commenced with a new moon, and brought me down for twenty-nine successive mornings to the Euphrates, where he bathed me, apostrophizing the rising sun in a long formula, of which I never caught much; he gabbled indistinctly, like bad heralds at the Games; but he appeared to be invoking spirits. This charm completed, he spat thrice upon my face, and I went home, not letting my eyes meet those of any one we passed.885 Our food was nuts and acorns, our drink milk and hydromel886 and water from the Choaspes, and we slept out of doors on the grass. When he thought me sufficiently prepared, he took me at midnight to the Tigris, purified and rubbed me over, sanctified me with torches and squills and other things, muttering the charm aforesaid, then made a magic circle round me to protect me from ghosts, and finally led me home backwards just as I was; it was now time to arrange our voyage. [8] He himself put on a magic robe, Median in character, and fetched and gave me the cap, lion's skin, and lyre which you see, telling me if I were asked my name not to say Menippus, but Heracles, Odysseus, or Orpheus.887 Although Menippus was a Cynic and satirist, he wrote about serious subjects, in this case apparently at first hand. Although he learned the technique of making a magic circle “to protect from ghosts [spirits]” from Mithrobarzanes by the Tigris in Mesopotamia, he lived in both Coele-Syria and Egypt. Therefore the technique, if not already known in these regions, would have there been made known by Menippus through his widely distributed writings. There is linguistic support for the use of protective circles in Egyptian magic.

Daemons were seen as dangerous, but not evil in the sense later ascribed to demons.888 In fact the Egyptian word for conjuring šnjt means ‘encircling.’ 889 The Egyptian verb phr means “to go around or encircle.” The concept that enchanting derives from encircling is also common in Egyptian thought.890 Ritner sees “that which encircles/contains/controls” as a possible root of, or at least intimately connected with, “that which enchants/protects.” As Ritner explains: The magical ritual of “encircling” (dbn, phr) for purification is almost coeval with Egyptian civilization itself, being attested from the earliest archaic funerary rituals to the temple ceremonies of the Graeco-Roman periods... Comparable rituals of circumambulation comprise both public, cultic ceremonies and private, ‘magical’ ones.891 The hieroglyphic determinative for “to go around” (the walking legs) is sometimes replaced by scribes with the determinative “to enchant” (man-with-hand-to-mouth).892 It is dangerous to extrapolate that this use of encircling by the Egyptians, or its connection with enchantment, implies that the circle was used in Graeco-Egyptian magic, but it is most likely. If not, then it was certainly a parallel concept.893 One of the most relevant Egyptian magical images is the ouroboros, the snake devouring its tail, forming a natural circle. Although this image has mostly been examined in terms of early Greek alchemy, or Gnosticism, it is in fact of ancient Egyptian origin, where it is alluded to as an “encirclement as protection.”894 Ritner sums up the centrality of the circle to Egyptian magic: Thus, although ritual encirclement is well documented in many cultures, the centrality of the rite in Egyptian magic is striking, and its uses and terminology uniquely Egyptian... That the rite was of fundamental significance to the success of Egyptian magic is evident not merely by the presence of specified directions in rubrics and depictions in literary, religious, medical, and even historical texts, but also by the very turns of phrase which the Egyptian employed to describe magic.895 I hypothesise that the earliest form of the circle in ancient Egypt may have been inscribed upon the ground in the form of the ouroboros, the snake biting its own tail. This is an image which has endured, both in Gnostic gems, and as late as the 18th century grimoire, Treasure   888 For more about the nature of daemons see several of the essays in Kousoulis (2011). 889 Brashear (1995), p. 3393. 890 Ritner (2008), p. 57. 891 Ritner (2008), pp. 57-58. 892 Ostracon Naville 11 in Smith (1977), p. 124. 893 It is a well known feature of magic that the knowledge of someone’s true name gives the magician power over that person. A similar concept of protection from adverse magic may possibly lie behind the Egyptian procedure of encircling the written names of rulers or important people in an oval cartouche. 894 Ritner discusses it more fully in Ritner (1984b), pp. 219-220. 895 Ritner (2008), p. 68."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 of the Old Man of the Pyramids,896 which is notionally set in Egypt.897 The structuring of the circle as a snake also occurs in later grimoires such as the Goetia, although that particular version might simply be attributable to fortuitous artistic licence (see Figure 27).

However in the fertile ground of the 1st century BC, there lived an interesting magician called Honi ha-Ma'agel (lgomh invh), who was famous for his ability to successfully pray for rain. His name was literally ‘Honi the Circle-Drawer.’ His historical existence is testified by the presence of his well-kept tomb at Hatzor ha-Gelitit, by the roadside in a town near the well known Kabbalistic centre of Safed.899 According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: Once when a drought had lasted almost throughout the month of Adar and the people had supplicated in vain for rain, they came to Onias [Honi] to ask him to bring rain by his prayers. Onias thereupon drew a circle (hence probably his name, \"the circle-drawer\"), and, placing himself in the center of it, prayed for rain; and his prayer was immediately answered. When the rain had continued to fall for some time in torrents, and there was danger that it might prove harmful instead of a blessing, he prayed that it might cease; and this prayer also received an immediate answer.900 If Honi were in fact calling up spirits using God’s name in order to cause a storm, which seems more likely than directly berating God, then Honi’s use of the circle can be equated with Solomonic practice, but otherwise it appears to be an isolated incident. Schäfer also mentions Honi and quotes a Genizah fragment which he claims “testifies to exactly the opposite function of the circle, namely to capture demons [rather than to keep them at bay], thereby recalling the function of the magic bowls...901 The Genizah fragment Schäfer quotes in fact breaks off before the actual function of the circle is reached, leaving his contention totally unsupported: ...go to a place where no people live – to a mountain, to a field or to a house standing alone in which no women live - , sweep the house clean and make a circle (lvgo) in front of the entrance (of the house). Supply the circle with four openings for the four directions of the heavens and lay upon each one...902 In fact it was always (three-dimensional) vases or bottles that were used to trap spirits, not two-dimensional circles. Also a spirit trap would not have been supplied with four openings. There are no other early references in Jewish magical works to a circle, as far as I know.903 In the 15th century, by way of explaining the function of the circle, Menahem Ziyuni stated   899 Very recently Honi the Circle-Drawer has inspired a new prayer movement which uses chalk circles drawn on the ground, and has generated a New York best seller book called The Circle Maker, a DVD and a neo-Christian practice combining circles and prayer. 900 ‘Onias (Honi) ha-Me’aggel’ in Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. 901 Schäfer (1990), p.87. He quotes Trachtenberg (1939, 2004), p. 121 as if that supports his argument, but in fact Trachtenberg stresses the “protective virtues of this device [the circle]” rather than its use as a spirit capture device. Leaving four gaps in the circle render it useless for either of these functions. 902 The text breaks off at this point. Taylor-Schechter box K. 1. 1 as translated in Schäfer (1990), pp. 87-88. 903 Vases or bottles designed to trap or hold spirits have a completely different function from crystals in which skryers saw or spoke with spirits.

In the PGM, the magician needs protection from the gods as well as daimones and spirits.905 This was usually achieved by the wearing of a phylactery (see chapter 5.3.3). Given that the magical rites in the PGM tend to treat the gods like inferior daimones, rather than worshipping them, this need for protection is not surprising. In the PGM many of the rites involve a circular motion, as the magician turns to face first East then North, West, South during the course of the rite (see Figure 03). From this the presence of a protective circle may be inferred. It is highly likely that the Graeco-Egyptian magicians inherited the Mesopotamian and ancient Egyptian practice of encirclement, which was so commonplace that maybe it was not considered worthy of specific mention in the PGM. In a number of passages the phrases “do the usual” or “add the usual,” occur, indicating that well-known background procedures were not usually specified in the PGM. This may also have applied to prefatory procedures such as drawing the protective circle which may have been taken for granted. The fact that a circle appears to be only mentioned several times in the whole corpus of the PGM suggests that the circle was taken for granted. This phenomenon of unwritten instructions was common in the PGM, as these papyri were meant to be used as an experienced magician’s reference book, not a primer in magic. There is however one clear mention of the drawing of a protective circle with chalk on the ground in the PGM in a rite which is an invocation of a daimon referred to as a “shadow on the sun,” probably a solar daimon. The rubric concerning the protection of the magician mentions both a circle and a phylactery: Phylactery: The tail [of the cat]906 and the characters with the circle [on which] you will stand after you have drawn it with chalk. 907   904 Rohrbacher-Sticker (1993/4), p. 265. 905 The gods were not seen as universally beneficent, but as dangerous as spirits and daimones, and so the magician needed to be protected from them. 906 The opening line of the rite instructs the magician to be “crowned with a tail of a cat.” 907 PGM VII. 846-861.

One of the characters echoes a form which occurs later in the 15th century angel seals of de Abano’s Heptameron. Below them is another sequence of four characteres, preceded by, at least two of which look astrological in nature. These are likely to be the forerunners of the names and symbols later inscribed in more detail in the protective circle. The point is that the passage clearly gives instruction to stand within a chalk-drawn circle with inscribed astrological figures. This circle is mentioned in the same section as the phylactery and so it must also be meant for protection. It is also instructive that this particular invocation has a strong Egyptian flavour with no admixture of Greek words or gods, suggesting a very early usage. In the setup instructions for one experiment of direct vision, a Table of Practice,908 and floor markings are prescribed: For direct vision, set up a tripod and a table of olive wood or of laurel wood, and on the table carve in a circle these characters... Cover the tripod with clean linen, and place a censer on the tripod... In the centre of the shrine, surrounding the tripod, inscribe on the floor with a white stylus the following character... it is necessary to keep yourself pure for three days in advance... [If] you wish [to see], look inside, wearing clean [white] garments [and crowned] with a crown of laurel...909 The floor inscription, inscribed with a white stylus, is probably a chalk circle as the instruction locates it “surrounding the tripod.” This passage is highly significant as it also shows that a circle should be cut in the surface of the table, which is echoed in the 16th-19th century practice of inscribing characters on the Table of Practice. Although references to a protective chalk circle are not very detailed in the PGM, detailed diagrams of the protective circle begin to appear in the Hygromanteia. This circle is also closely tied to the four cardinal points, and with ritual actions performed at each of the cardinal points. Early Byzantine texts show the circle drawn in conjunction with a square or diamond shape indicating these directions, but some later Latin grimoires sometimes omit that feature. The floor-inscribed magical circle is found in its most fully developed form in the Hygromanteia. There are in this text three different types of circle, often all found in the same manuscript, but in different chapters, probably indicating slightly differing uses rather than a chronological development. These sources have very specific diagrams of protective circles, often set within a square or diamond, which are designed to be drawn on the ground.

The procedure of drawing a double circle inside two contraposed squares was well established and obviously long used to protect the magician from spirits. First Byzantine Circle Type The most specialised of these circles is found in chapter 49 of the Hygromanteia, which is concerned with evocatory skrying using a young boy. It contains one of the most detailed special purpose magical circles to be found in any manuscript of the Hygromanteia.910 The purpose of this circle is to protect the virgin boy being used as a skryer as well as the magician. The magician or magister, who is here identified as a Persian ‘lecanomancer’ called Apolonios [sic],911 reads the invocation whilst the boy stares at a water pot balanced on a stone, from the centre of a protective circle (see Figure 13 and Figure 14).

Marathakis identifies this procedure as hygromanteia type I, despite the textual identification of the main figure as a lecanomancer. This underlines the essential identity of all the water/oil skrying methods which evolved from PGM bowl skrying.   910 B2, f. 344. 911 It is tempting to see this as Apollonius of Tyana, but the appellation ‘Persian,’ and the green turban shown in the illustration, make this a problematic identification."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 Figure 14: Magical circle of protection used in an experiment of evocatory water skrying, from the Hygromanteia 1440.912 Note this is the actual protective circle used in the operation shown more graphically in Figure 13. The outer entrance way is to the West (at bottom of illustration). This scenario of a boy skryer inside a circle has a lot in common with a 16th/17th century Hebrew manuscript concerned with fingernail skrying,913 in which a circle is made around the skryer also with a black-handled knife: Take a young lad and make a circle in the earth with a knife, the handle of which is black, and prepare the nail of the right thumb until it becomes thin, and take four smooth stones and put (them) in the four rows of the circle, and put the mentioned knife in the middle of the circle...914 The “four smooth stones” are also mentioned in Babylonian texts, were used in various ceremonies,915 suggesting again a possible ultimate Mesopotamian origin for the practice. Returning to chapter 49 of the Hygromanteia, the geometry of the protective design in this chapter is quite complex, and possibly unique. It consists of a pentagram (in which the skryer stands, surrounded by a double square with an opening to the East protected by the words “Iabaa, Morasa, MpaKth.” The boundary of the square is protected by “Letaia, Lekamini, Lekhaglō, Gōn, Lekaphthri, Apagla,916 Maria, Lakarinau, Latago, Logam.” The square is then surrounded by a double circle with an opening to the West.

It is not clear where the magician stands during this operation, but in likelihood also within the outer protective circle. There are two other distinct methods of forming the circle outlined in the Hygromanteia from the same period. Second Byzantine Circle Type This appears in chapter 36 of the Hygromanteia (see Figure 15),918 which describes an evocation which is to be performed when the Sun is in exact opposition to the Moon, in other words at Full Moon. This circle has two earthenware braziers, full of lit charcoals on the borders of the circle, used to burn the incense. This feature is illustrated in this and subsequent diagrams with plumes of smoke arising from the braziers situated at the corners. The circle is set within two squares, with the corners of the inner one touching the mid-points of the sides of the outer one. After entering the circle from the South and placing incense on the charcoals, the magician is required to trace one or two concentric circles,919 with embedded nomina magica, again using the black-handled knife of the art. When the magician and his apprentice have entered the circle, the entrance is sealed with this knife of the art. This circle consists of a double circle with an entrance pathway facing the South, set within a square, set within a larger square touched at the midpoints of its sides by the vertices of the smaller square. The vertices of the larger square determine the position for the earthenware braziers. The east and west sides of the inner square have triple lock marks near the corners, and all four corners have triple angle lock marks. This feature is meant to prevent the ingress of the spirit at any point where the lines may have been imperfectly joined. The black-handled knife is shown baring the exit, with its point outwards. It is possible that the knife is stabbed into the floor/earth at this point, as in the conjuration of Mortzē.920   917 Possibly from the Hebrew Aemeth, meaning ‘truth.’ This word was later used by Dee to describe his main circular sigil, Sigullum Dei Aemeth. 918 Chapter 36 in manuscript H, f. 34v, A, f. 17v and B, f. 21v. 919 Manuscripts B and H respectively. 920 B2, f. 346.

Third Byzantine Circle Type This method is to be found in chapter 41 of the Hygromanteia (see Figure 16).922 In this method four braziers or censers are used. This third method of drawing the circle is simpler as the circle is only enclosed in one square and the nomina magica are different.

Traditionally the consecrated circle in the Clavicula Salomonis was drawn with flour924 or chalk upon the floor or cut into the turf with a ritual dagger (if the magical operation were performed outdoors). Although the circle was usually drawn in chalk or painted on the floor, a number of authorities state that its retracing by the consecrated (black-handled) knife, or consecrated iron sword, was what was most effective in keeping the spirits out of the circle.   923 Chapter 41 manuscript G, f. 26v.

Hebrew Copy of the Clavicula Salomonis In another section of this thesis (chapter 3.3) it has been demonstrated that the only extant Solomonic text in Hebrew, the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh, is ultimately derived from an unidentified Latin/Italian Clavicula Salomonis. As illustrations of the circles in that manuscript are drawn from a pre-1700 Latin/Italian Clavicula Salomonis, it is therefore appropriate that they be considered here alongside contemporary Latin and vernacular European grimoires, rather than with Jewish magic.

This again reflects the long standing tradition that spirits fear sharp iron blades.934 The magician’s efforts were concentrated on the drawing and closing of the Circle to prevent demonic ingress. This Hebrew copy of an Italian/Latin Clavicula Salomonis circle diagram clearly shows an access path designed to allow the magician and his disciple to enter the circle before the rite (see Figure 19). The Hebrew inscribed on the path }vmti aiv transliterates as the phrase ‘Via Itmon,’ an interesting mix of Latin and Hebrew which means ‘the path of Metatron.’935 The magician intended to invoke that angel to protect the vulnerable entry path to his circle. The practice of placing braziers with charcoal on which to burn the incense, at the corners of the circumscribed square, occurs again in some manuscripts of the Key of Solomon,936 but the outer squares begin to disappear from the 19th century onwards.

The Heptameron, meaning literally ‘the seven days,’ deals with invocations of the angels and spirits of the seven days of the week. The Heptameron was first published in Venice in 1496, and was reputedly written by de Abano, although that is disputed by some scholars on the now familiar grounds that someone who was a doctor and scholar could not possibly have penned a work on magic.

For in making a Circle, it ought to be considered in what time of the year, what day, and what hour, [and what season] that you make the Circle; what Spirits you would call, to what Star [planet] and region they do belong, and what functions they have.939 The Heptameron940 carries on the PGM and Hygromanteia practice of recommending the careful selection of the correct day of the week and hour. These temporal concerns include identifying angels appropriate to the month and even the season. These are then not just invoked, but their names are written between the rings of the magician’s protective circle.941 This circle is also divided by a cross (indicating the cardinal directions). The interesting transmission from the PGM and the Byzantine Hygromanteia texts is that the angels and rulers of the hour, day and season are now inscribed within the circle itself. Perhaps this was initially an aide-memoire for the magician conjuring these temporal rulers, but it soon became a written fixture. This results in the form of the circle varying from one time (day, month, or season) to the next. It would seem likely therefore (as these circles harked back to the Byzantine Solomonic tradition) that the Heptameron is likely to have been amongst the grimoires imported from Byzantium. Interestingly, a complete copy of the Heptameron is contained within the text of one of the manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, making it even more likely that it too was originally a Greek text.942 In the 1796 Clavicula Salomonis these circles appear again, but are (incorrectly) labelled as pentacles rather than being recognised by the scribe (F. Fyot) as protective circles.943   939 Abano (2005), p. 60. 940 See Skinner (2005), pp. 93-96. 941 The requirement to call them, rather than just document them within the circle, is not mentioned. 942 B3, ff. 87-135 published as Bernardakeios Magikos Kōdikas.

He reintroduced the circles format of the Heptameron, which had been out of fashion, reincorporating the idea of listing the names of the temporal rulers that were appropriate to the date and time of the ritual, in the Circle itself. Other changes made by him, suggest a wider knowledge of the procedures of Solomonic magic than many of his 17th century contemporaries. For example, instead of using a triangle to confine the spirit, he manufactured a Brass Vessel, modelled on Solomon’s spirit bottle, and closed it with the Seal of Solomon and inscribed it with the names of all 72 angels who are supposed to control their opposite 72 demons.

This device is never used in the context of the invocation of gods or angels, only spirits or demons. Its secondary purpose was supposedly to force the spirit to tell the truth. I cannot discover any use of a confining Triangle of Art in the PGM. Protection seems to have been derived from phylacteries plus a simple circle, and other constraints appear to have been verbal, written and material (i.e. stones and herbs). The Triangle of Art that is first found in Latin and English grimoires has the words Anaphaxeton, Primeumaton and Tetragrammaton inscribed in it. The first two of these words are undoubtedly of Greek origin,956 so one might expect this device to date from the Byzantine period, but I have as yet found no trace of it there. An early version of the Triangle appeared in a manuscript dated 1572 (see Figure 29). The Triangle is surrounded by a circle which contains three phrases with Greek, Jewish and Christian words designed to restrain the spirit: i) Emanuel Sab[a]oth Adonay (Jewish) ii) Panthon Vsyon (Greek) iii) Messias + Sother (Christian) The Triangle itself contains “Dat tha gen + lap Tenop + Rynthaoth.” The figure to the right seems to be a much abbreviated circle as it contains the protective inscription “Alpha & \u0017.” The figure below is a sigil or corrupt pentacle, probably of the spirit being invoked.

In Latin grimoires this same device is described as either a phylacterium or lamen. Amulets which were simply worn daily as a general protection against disease or bad luck on an “in case of a threat” basis are not part of the equipment of ritual magic, and considered separately in chapter 5.4.1. The separation of these two things is not artificial but crucial in terms of usage. Phylacteries, almost without exception form part of a larger rite, and are always detailed in a sub-section at the end of the rite. Amulets usually occur in short free-standing passages with no elaborate ritual. In the Greek text amulets are headed with \u001e\f\u0003ι!\u0004\u0004\u0002\u000b! (periammata), or more often with \u001e\u0003\u001f - (pros-) prefixed to the objective they have been made for, for example an amulet against hardening of the breasts is entitled: \u001e\u0003\u001f \u0004\u0002\u0014\u000eO\u0013 \u0014\u0005\u0010\u0003\u0006\u0002.973 Phylacteries on the other hand are always described as \u0001\u000f\u0010\u0002\u0005\u000b\u0011\u0003ι\t\u0013 (phylakterion). The reason why the distinctions need to be made is that amulets are made for a client and later merge with folk magic, whilst phylacteries, talismans and lamens remain part of learned magic, for use by the magician himself, and are later transmitted to the Hygromanteia and then the Clavicula Salomonis. Jewish Virtually the only religion to preserve the consistent use of the phylactery through to modern times is Judaism (the tefillin), and maybe to a lesser extent Islam. The modern Jewish practice is to tie one small leather box containing specific Biblical verses onto the forehead, and another on to the upper arm, or sometimes the left hand, bound tightly using leather thongs. A more massive version of the phylactery was used by the high priests in the Temple of Jerusalem, before its destruction in 70 CE. This is documented in the Bible.974 In the light of the later use of the phylactery, it seems that the High Priest wore the breastplate primarily for protection when he entered the ‘holy of holies’, given the fearsome reputation that the Ark of the Covenant contained there had for killing large numbers of people.975 Protection is the basic function of any breastplate. Be that as it may, the idea of a breastplate worn on the High Priest’s chest is clearly similar in function to the magician’s phylactery. The consecration of such a lamen was of considerable importance for both priest and   973 PGM VII. 208-209. 974 Exodus 28:17-20. 975 1 Samuel 6: 1; 2 Samuel 6: 2-7."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 238 magician. One such Jewish rite of consecration of a golden plate (which was obviously a phylactery/lamen) is documented in a Genizah fragment: You shall perform all of these (procedures) in the fear of God. Protect yourself well from any bad thing. And when you perform all of these (procedures) you should go out to the [water] trough,976 and say many prayers and supplications, and ask that you not fail again. Then speak this glorious name in fear and trembling. If you see the image of a lion of fire in the trough, know that you have succeeded in wearing this holy name. Then you shall take the golden plate (ṣiṣ) on which this holy name is engraved and tie it around your neck and on your heart. Take care not to become impure again when it is on you, lest you be punished. Then you may do any [magical]977 thing and you will succeed.978 There is no doubt that a golden plate engraved with a holy name worn over the heart was a magician’s phylactery or lamen. It would seem in this context that its function was more than protective, in as much as it granted success in all (magical) operations as well. This secondary function also appears to have carried over into later grimoires. The phylactery was usually worn over the heart or on the forearms of the Graeco-Egyptian magician, as a protection, to save the magician being overpowered by the spiritual creatures he invoked: ...for I have your name as a unique phylactery in my heart, and no flesh, although moved, will overpower me; no spirit will stand against me – neither daimon nor visitation nor any other of the evil beings of Hades, because of your name, which I have in my soul and invoke. Also [be] with me always for good, a good [god dwelling] in a good [man], yourself immune to magic, giving me health no magic can harm, well-being, prosperity, glory, victory, power, sex appeal.979 Phylacteries were very common and an important item of protection for the magician during the Graeco-Egyptian period. It is remarkable how many scholars simply treat the details of phylactery manufacture as if they were almost accidental jottings or even a separate passage at the end of the text of the rite. By convention in the PGM, the preparations such as the incense, ink, or manufacture and consecration of the phylactery, were written at the end after the description of the rite itself and the text of the invocation(s). One rite which has the clearest drawing of a phylactery also describes its purpose in detail: A phylactery, a bodyguard against daimones, against phantasms, against every sickness and suffering,980 [is] to be written on a leaf of gold or silver or tin or on hieratic papyrus. When worn it works mightily for it is the name of power of the great god and [his] seal, and it is as follows: “KMĒPHIS CHPHYRIS...”981 These are the names; the figure is like this: let the Snake be biting its tail,982 the names being written inside [the circle made by] the snake, and the characters   976 Instead of a river which would be more usual. 977 The insertion of ‘magical’ into this text at this point is justified as no ordinary tasks (except religious or magical) were envisaged whilst wearing the phylactery, in case such actions caused the impurity warned against. 978 Genizah fragment MS JTSA ENA 6643.4, lines 4–13.

The great god referred to is Khepera. The connection between phylacteries and Khepera is later to surface in Latin grimoires in the word ‘candariis’ the obscure Latin word for talisman.987 The origin of this word comes from the Khepera scarab-shaped carvings made by the thousands and brought from Egypt to Europe where they were identified as talismans.988 Some phylacteries also have images incorporated in their design. One such example is a phylactery989 that is to be used during the invocation of Selene: Take a lodestone and on it have carved a three-faced Hekate. And let the middle face be that of a maiden wearing horns, and the left face that of a dog, and the one on the right that of a goat. After the carving is done, clean with natron and water, and dip in the blood of one who has died a violent death. Then make a food offering to it, and say the same spell at the time of the ritual.990 A phylactery used in another rite to Selene also uses a ‘breathing’ lodestone, which relies upon the magical powers of that stone. The lodestone remained in use as a stone of attraction by magicians through to the 18th century: Preparation of the procedure’s protective charm [phylactery]:991 Take a magnet that is breathing and fashion it in the form of a heart, and let there be engraved on it Hekate lying about the heart, like a little crescent. Then carve the twenty-lettered spell that is all vowels, and wear it around [on] your body. The following name is what is written: “AEYŌ ĒIE ŌA EŌĒ EŌA ŌI EŌI.” For this spell is completely capable of everything. But perform this ritual in a holy manner, not frequently or lightly, especially to [invoke] Selene.992 Another example made of wood is simplistically translated as a ‘charm’ but which is called a φυλακτήριον in the original text. As it is used for the magician’s protection during a rite it is obviously a phylactery: The protective charm [phylactery] which you must wear: Onto lime wood write with vermilion   987 See the Catholicon, a 13th century dictionary compiled by Johannes Balbus (in the edition dated 1460). 988 The likely derivation of candariis is: Khepera = \u0005!\u0013\u000e\u0002\u0003\t\u0007 = Kantharos = Cantharos = Candariis. (!\u0013\u000e\u0002\u0003\t\u0007 is the Scarabaeus pilularius, or dung beetle. 989 This is rather weakly translated as ‘charm.’ 990 PGM IV. 2880-2890. 991 The original Greek is φυλακτήριον, ‘phylactery’ not ‘charm’ as in the English translation. 992 PGM IV. 2630-2640.

And do not perform it unless some dire necessity arises for you.

It does not seem as if it was necessary to wait for Christianity to demote the ancient gods and goddesses to the level of daimones, for it seems the Graeco-Egyptian magicians had already done so.1000 In the same spell, Hecate/AktiKphis is described as “bull-shaped, horse-faced goddess, who howl[s] doglike,” and various sacrilegious acts are heaped upon her, to annoy her, and make her act. This confrontational style of magic did not translate into the later Greek or Latin grimoires. One of the best known phylactery descriptions occurs in the so-called “Mithras Liturgy:” Then the phylacteries are of this kind. Copy the [text of the phylactery]1001 for the right [arm] onto the skin of a black sheep, with myrrh ink, and after tying it with the sinews of the same animal, put it on; and [copy] that for the left [arm] onto the skin of a white sheep, and use the same method. The [magical word] for the left [arm] is: “PROSTHYMĒRI,” and has this   993 Hyphens introduced to clarify the structure. 994 This form of words, via the Griffith and Thompson (1974) translation, appears again in late 19th century Golden Dawn practice. 995 PGM IV. 2695-2705. 996 A slander spell deliberately sets out to annoy the goddess, in order that she may do what is asked of her to the victim of the spell. 997 The original Greek is φυλακτήριον, ‘phylactery,’ not ‘charm.’ 998 PGM IV. 2505-2511. 999 PGM IV. 2512-2519. 1000 This is further reason for using the term ‘spiritual creature’ when referring to these gods, daimones, demons, or spirits, as to a large extent they were all treated in the same way by the magician. 1001 Betz mistakenly uses the word ‘amulet’ here."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 242 memorandum:... 1002 “Let go of what you have, and then you will receive, [from] PSINŌTHER NŌPSITHER THERNŌPSI” (add the usual).1003 The craft of phylactery making is not above using one god to neutralize another. A love spell which invokes Aphrodite uses a Typhonian phylactery to keep the magician safe: And also have as a protective charm [phylactery]1004 a tooth from the upper right jawbone of a female ass or of a tawny sacrificial heifer, tied to your left arm with Anubian thread.1005 A phylactery to protect against the anger of Kronos, father of the gods, uses the myth that Zeus castrated Kronos with a sickle in order to create a protective phylactery: On the rib of a young pig carve Zeus holding fast a sickle and this name: “CHTHOUMILON.” Or let it be the rib of a black, scaly, castrated boar.1006 Phibechis, a legendary Egyptian magician, whose name in Egyptian literally means ‘falcon,’ is supposedly responsible for a spell which exorcises daimones. The most interesting part of his rite is the phylactery that would have been hung on the possessed patient to protect him from the daimon: The phylactery: On a tin lamella write “IAĒO ABRAŌTH IŌCH PHTHA MESENPSIN IAŌ PHEŌCH IAĒŌ CHARSOK,” and hang it on the patient [the possessed].1007 The phylactery is described as “terrifying to every daimon, a thing he fears.” The conjuration, “by the seal which Solomon placed on the tongue of Jeremiah” to determine the truth, is applied to force the spirit to: Also tell whatever sort you may be, heavenly or aerial, whether terrestrial or subterranean, or netherworldly or Ebousaeus or Chersus or Pharisaeus, tell whatever sort you may be...”1008 It was of course considered necessary that the magician should know the name and station of the spirit, in order to be able to control it. In another rite which utilises the threat of harm to a beetle,1009 a phylactery is used by the magician to protect himself from the daimon being invoked: The phylactery for the foregoing: With the blood from the hand or foot of a pregnant woman, write the name given below on a clean piece of papyrus; then tie it about your left arm by a linen cord and wear it. Here is what is to be written: “SHTĒIT CHIEN TENHA, I bind and loose [you].”   1002 The six line quote from Homer which occurs at this point, and which both Meyer and Betz see as part of this rite, is a totally unrelated interpolation. This interpolation is in fact an interrupted passage, which carries on from PGM IV. 467-474 and continues again on lines 830-834. 1003 PGM IV. 813-820, 828-829.

Wear it around your neck whenever you perform the rite.1011 Some phylacteries just rely upon a string of nomina magica: There is also the charm [phylactery]1012 itself which you wear while performing, even while standing: onto a silver leaf inscribe this name of 100 letters with a bronze stylus, and wear it strung on a thong [made] from the hide of an ass.1013 The prescribed name is:1014 ANCHCHŌR ACHCHŌR ACHACHACH PTOUMI CHACHCHŌ CHARACHŌCH CHAPTOUMĒ CHŌRACHARACHŌCH APTOUMI MĒCHŌCHAPTOU CHARACHPTOU CHACHCHŌ CHARACHŌ PTENACHŌCHEU (a hundred letters).1015 A more elaborate and probably earlier Egyptian version of a phylactery to be used by the skryer rather than the magician is described in Demotic: A amulet [phylactery]1016 to be bound to the body of the one [skryer] who is carrying the vessel [to] enchant quickly: You should bring a band of linen of sixteen threads, four of white, four of [green], four of blue, four of red, and make them into one band and stain them with the blood of the hoopoe.1017 You should bind it to a scarab in its attitude of the sun god,1018 drowned,1019   1010 PGM VII. 478-490. 1011 PGM IV. 1071-1084.

The ass is associated with Typhon/Set. 1014 PGM IV. 239-241. 1015 Of course as the original is in Greek, such combinations as ‘CH’ count as only one Greek letter. The count of how many letters is meant as a scribal check to make sure these names have been copied correctly by the practitioner. 1016 Translated as “amulet” by Griffith and Thompson, as reproduced in Betz (1996), p. 200, but actually a phylactery. 1017 The hoopoe bird was sacred in ancient Egypt. In Leviticus 11:13–19, hoopoes were categorised as detestable and were banned from being eaten, perhaps because of their status in Egypt. In Deuteronomy 14:18 they were listed as not kosher. This bird has a long history of appearing in books of Arabic magic, the PGM and later European grimoires, where it is primarily valued for its blood. It is epops in Greek. Strangely it has been Israel’s national bird since 2008. In Estonia they are connected with death and the Underworld, but are symbols of virtue in traditional Persia. The hoopoe is the king of the birds in Aristophanes’ play The Birds. The bird also has a reputation as a messenger in the Middle East, and was legendarily used that way by King Solomon, and it may be that reputation as Solomon’s messenger more than any other which contributed to its use in magic."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 244 being wrapped in byssus.1020 You should bind it to the body of the youth who is carrying the vessel [for skrying]. It enchants quickly...1021 Here we have an example of a phylactery that not only protects the skryer but also enchants the skryer, or enhances their readiness to skry. Apollonius of Tyana is credited in the PGM with securing a spirit servant from the goddess Nephthys in the form of an old woman. This rite requires that the magician wears a protective phylactery during the course of the invocation which deals with both the goddess Nephthys and the spirit familiar granted to the magician by that goddess. The phylactery is made from the skull of an ass because that is the animal sacred to Seth who was Nephthys’ husband. Two teeth from the skull have been given to the magician by the goddess as a pledge of the servitude of the spirit servant. The phylactery to be used throughout the rite: The skull of the ass. Fasten the ass’s tooth with silver and the old lady’s tooth with gold, and wear them always; for if you do this, it will be impossible for the old woman [spirit servant] to leave you. The rite has been tested.1022 This particular phylactery is different from the usual run of phylacteries inasmuch as it is to be worn all the time, afterwards, rather than just during the rite because its functions are those of binding as well as protection and the magic is ongoing. The phylactery or lamen is described in chapter 33 and 40 of the Hygromanteia, being the chapters respectively of the first and second methods of evocation. Here it is referred to as an ourania, a word that is not translated in Delatte, Greenfield or Torijano, perhaps because they were not sure of its equivalence. Marathakis suggests that it is an abbreviation of ourania sphragis or ’heavenly seal,’ which seems very likely in the context.1023 Delatte suggests \t$\u0003\u0002\u0013\u0006P \u0002\u0010\u0017\u0002\u0001\u0007 :\t\u0010\t\u00040\u0013\u000b\t\u0007.1024 The ourania is definitely the successor of the Graeco-Egyptian phylactery. For the purposes of comparison with later Latin grimoires, I will continue to refer to this as a phylactery or lamen, rather than using the Greek term \t$\u0003\u0002\u0013\u0006\u0002. The making of the lamen is outlined under two different methods in the Hygromanteia, yielding two different descriptions.1025 The lamen of the first method of evocation is to be made of unborn calf skin with ten seals        1018 The scarab beetle is the animal of Kheperi, a version of the sun god Phre/Ra.

Another possible reason for this name for the lamen is that Ourania was the muse of astronomy, and much magic in the Hygromanteia relies upon astronomical calculations, hence wearing Ourania’s seal was very appropriate. That explanation is however much less likely. 1024 Delatte (1927-38), p. 8. 1025 The first method is described in H, f. 28-28v; B, ff. 17-20; P, f. 219.

Manuscript B gives a sketch of the lamen which contains ten unevenly spaced talismans surrounding a lozenge shape containing ten characters, and a squiggly line that seems to serve no particular purpose.1029 This is supposed to be drawn on unborn parchment with considerably more accuracy than the sketch, as “your deliverance lies [depends] upon it.” The text stresses this a number of times, and suggests that the magician should use a compass, and great care, unlike the scribe of this roughly drawn manuscript.1030 The ink to be used is very like the perfumed inks found in the PGM: The inner parts must be drawn carefully, with musk, saffron, rose water and cinnabar, [red ink] but the outer parts must be drawn with black ink...However, all letters and signs must be red, as instructed.1031 The lamen described in the second method of evocation in the Hygromanteia is also made of unborn calf parchment, but has a completely different design, with a total of 24 circular ‘seals’ and a number of names to be written on it (see Figure 38 left side). Maybe this roughly drawn lamen has one seal for every hour of the day.1032 The transmission of the ‘seals’ used on the lamen will be examined in the next chapter 5.4.2 on Talismans and Pentacles. In the Clavicula Salomonis, just one pentacle design becomes the lamen, rather than a group of seals, as in the Hygromanteia. This lamen is, however, referred to by a variety of different names in different Latin grimoires: In the UT Text-Group of the Clavicula Salomonis the lamen is described simply as a pentacle.1033 In the Heptameron the lamen is also simply referred to as a Pentacle.1034 In the RS Text-Group of the Clavicula Salomonis it is referred to as the “La Grande Pentacule de Salomon,” to distinguish it from the other planetary pentacles.1035   1026 See Figure 38; H, f. 33 for an illustration of the first method lamen. 1027 The relationship between these crude seals and the pentagrams of the Clavicula Salomonis will be examined in chapter 5.4.2. 1028 Maybe one lacing for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which suggests a possible Hebrew derivation. 1029 B, f. 19v. 1030 How the magician was expected to produce a careful drawing from such a very rough sketch is not explained. 1031 B, f. 19. 1032 H, f. 31; B, f. 16v-18; G, f. 26, for illustrations of the second method lamen, the 24 talisman lamen. 1033 Skinner and Rankine (2008), pp. 387-388. 1034 Skinner (2005), p.65. 1035 Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 92."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 246 In Juratus, the lamen takes on a more elevated name, “the Seal of the true and living God.”1036 In the Goetia it becomes “the pentagonal figure of Solomon,”1037 which is worn over the breast for protection, not “Solomon’s sexangled figure,”1038 as suggested by several writers.1039 In each case the lamen takes on either a hexagram or pentagram shaped design. There is some confusion over the shape, as both shapes have been referred to as the Seal of Solomon. In terms of Jewish practice the hexagram is a much more common choice. This pentagram (according to the Goetia) is a figure with five vertices, which should be made of gold or silver, and be engraved with ‘Tetragrammaton’ inscribed in between its vertices, whilst various nomina magica are inscribed at its points, such as Abdia, Ballaton, and Halliza. The Hexagram of Solomon is a Star of David or figure with six vertices, also inscribed with Tetragrammaton, but with both AGLA and Alpha-Omega written between the points. In the middle is a ‘T’ or Tau cross. This is to be worn at the edge of the magician's vestment, but covered with a cloth until the spirit appears, at which point it will be revealed to compel the spirit to take human shape and be obedient.   1036 Peterson, Liber Juratus (forthcoming); Driscoll (1977), p. 11; Hedegård (2002), p. 70. 1037 Peterson (2001), Figure 4, p. 44. 1038 Peterson (2001), Figure 3, p. 43. 1039 In the case of the Goetia, the hexagram figure is not the lamen but a figure designed to compel the spirits to assume human form when they appear."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 247 5.4 Written Words Ritner demonstrates the close connection between written magical items (such as amulets, phylacteries and talismans) and the magician himself in ancient Egypt: In literature from the Old Kingdom through Greco-Roman periods, the priestly qualifications of the magician protagonist are almost invariably specified, being indicated as either “chief lector priest” [hry-tp] or “scribe of the House of Life.”... From the later designation derive also the simple references to magicians as “good scribes” (sh nfr) and magical acts as “deeds of a (good) scribe” (wp.t n sh nfr, sp n sh).1040 5.4.1 Amulets (A & R) The term amulet has come to be used rather loosely in modern literature, both scholarly and lay. Amulets were not designed to be used in the context of a magical rite, but to be worn day-to-day. They will often have been made by the magician for a client who just wanted to be luckier in love or gambling, or protected from disease in a general way. Such amulets made for clients are common to all the cultures under consideration, and have survived thousands of years, from the faience scarabs of dynastic Egyptian times to the “lucky rabbit’s foot” of the 21st century. Amongst Jewish amulets manufactured for use by an individual, formulae from ancient Palestinian and Babylonian sources can be found on amulets from the Cairo Genizah and on amulets currently for sale to the Jewish community in New York and London, attesting a long history of transmission.1041 The ancient Egyptians made a clear distinction between magic (hekau) and amulet making (sau),1042 as distinction that was carried over into Graeco-Egyptian magic. The Egyptians wore many amulets, of which the most common was probably the pottery, stone or wood scarab which was set into rings, used as pendants or buried with a mummy. A number of standard designs prevailed such as the tet column or the Eye of Horus.1043 The fact that wdQw, the general term for an amulet also means “health” suggests that the bulk of such amulets were meant as general protection especially against disease, but also against snakes, crocodiles, and other unseen menaces that lurked in river junctions, canals, pools and wells. There are in excess of 45 separate rites for creating such popular amulets in the PGM, many of them for reasons of health or love. These are very simple formulae, with an average length of less than ten lines.1044 These are obviously meant to be manufactured for clients, and so thousands of them have also survived as artefacts as well as the details of their preparation in the papyri texts.   1040 Ritner (2008), pp. 221-222. 1041 Swartz (1990), p. 166. 1042 Sau applies to both the practice and the practitioner.

One such amulet (see Figure 34 top) was designed to attract Herakles (the small gladiatorial figure at the back) to Allous (daughter of Alexandria) using the god Bes (in the foreground).1045 Note the nomina magica written down each side of the amulet, decremented by one letter on each line. Such wing formations survived into the vernacular grimoires of the 19th century, such as the wing formation (see Figure 34 bottom) copied by the cunning-man Anders Ulfkjaer from a grimoire by pseudo-Cyprian in 1858. Although the amulets recorded in the PGM are very crude in design, there was a parallel Greek and Roman culture of amulets made to a much higher artistic standard, and these were inherited by Byzantium. The manufacture of amulets in Byzantium was very sophisticated, with designs engraved upon gems, cameos, enamel pendants, bronze tokens, or disks of gold, silver, bronze and lead, or fashioned in the form of rings. These complex designs nevertheless followed standard patterns, each for a specific purpose. Typically one of the most common amulets was designed to protect the newborn child from the demoness Gyllou (although the name ‘Gyllou’ does not actually occur on any of them), or counter the imaginary medical phenomena of the so-called ‘wandering womb.’1046 Early amulets, sometimes dated to the 6th/7th century portrayed St. Sisinnios of Antioch mounted on a horse and aiming a lance a dragon (or demon). This rider saint was sometimes conflated with Solomon, and some of these amulets have Solomon’s name inscribed upon them (see Figure 35). These amulets also had celestial characteres inscribed upon them like Graeco-Egyptian amulets.1047 The earliest iconography comes from 5th century monastery of St. Apollo at Bawit in Egypt. St. Sisinnios (c. 708) hailed from Antioch where the use of the rider saint on Syrian amulets was very common.1048 His conflation with Solomon may have occurred at a later date. Later designs, circa 10th-12th century tended to additionally feature a Medusa-like head with seven radiating serpents. Such designs were common on shields in the ancient Greek world, and therefore it was not a large jump to extrapolate this to protection in general, and specifically amuletic projection. Other saints and angels were often part of the design.1049   1045 PGM XXXIX. 1-21. 1046 The so-called hysteria formula, 1047 See Spier (1993), pp. 25-62 for more extensive discussion. 1048 See British Library Or.

Although Solomon’s seal (which features in many later Latin grimoires) is not shown graphically, it is mentioned textually on the amulet. The angel Araph or Arlaph, an old spelling for Raphael, here functions as a thwarting angel, for the demon Gyllou.1056 These amulets are also found in Russia (no doubt exported from Byzantium) and Eastern Europe, but did not enter the Latin grimoires of Western Europe. Solomonic magicians undoubtedly made amulets as a day-to-day service for clients, but this process did not become part of the procedures of formal evocation or invocation according to the Solomonic method. Therefore amulets are an example of a discontinuity in practice, for although they continued to be made, they were not part of the Solomonic method of evocation. In due course amulets became more of the stock in trade of the village or folk magic than learned ritual magic. In the Middle Ages, some of the nomina magica of learned ritual magic were to be found on amulets. In fact as Skemer reports, “after the twelfth century, the vocabulary of textual amulets in the West came to be enlivened and energized by the spread of pseudo-Solomonic grimoires,” not the other way around. 1057 5.4.2 Talismans and Pentacles (T) Talismans and pentacles must be distinguished from amulets. Amulets were just a passive form of protection against a more generalized threat, whereas talismans and pentacles were designed to cause a specific change. See category ‘T’ in the table in Appendix 2 for a listing of PGM talismans. A talisman is designed to achieve one particular magical objective. As one 17th century writer succinctly put it: A talisman is nothing else than the seal, figure, character, or image of a celestial omen, planet, or constellation; impressed, engraved, or sculptured upon a sympathetic stone or upon a metal corresponding to the planet; by a workman whose mind is settled and fixed upon his work and the end of his work without being distracted or dissipated in other unrelated thoughts; on the day and at the hour of the planet; in a fortunate place; during fair, calm weather, and when the planet is in the best aspect that may be in the heavens, the more strongly to attract the influences proper to an effect depending upon the power of the same and on the virtues of its influences.1058 The process of making such a talisman consists of invoking a particular power or specific   1056 Or Abyzou, a female demon, like Lilith, who kills newborn children. 1057 Skemer (2006), p. 205. 1058 de Bresche (1671)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 252 spiritual creature into an inscribed parchment or metal disk at the correct time. The PGM recommends both metal and parchment phylacteries, the Clavicula Salomonis recommends both parchment and metal pentacles, favouring the latter, whilst the Hygromanteia universally refers only to parchment ‘seals.’ Talismans, in the form examined below, only occur in the Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis, and not in the PGM. In contrast, phylacteries are a distinctive feature of the magic of the PGM, and have a clear line of transmission to the Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis, with one surprising exception which will be outlined below. By the 16th century, ‘pentacle’ and ‘talisman’ had become almost interchangeable terms, and were almost universally inscribed in a double circle or annulus figure. Chapter III of the Clavicula Salomonis explains the typical materials and conditions required for making such pentacles: The Talismans, Pentacles, Mystical Images, Sigils, Characters and other suchlike Talismans, which are the main tools for working with Occult Science, can be created with different materials. You can make them on virgin parchment, on metal plates, on magnetic stones, on jasper, agate and on other precious stones.1059 The text goes on to qualify that the parchment must be made in the time-honoured fashion, but made by yourself rather than bought. Metal talismans are said to be preferred having a closer affinity with their respective planets than parchment, which “can get dirty easily and any amount of dirt, no matter how small is capable of lessening the effect of the Talisman.” The usual list of planetary metals follows in this manuscript, with the exception that Venus is attributed to bronze rather than to pure copper. If the talismans are to be made of paper or parchment, then the colours recommended in the same text are: ...thou shalt chiefly use these colours: Gold, Cinnabar or Vermilion Red, and celestial or brilliant Azure Blue.1060 Furthermore, thou shalt make these Medals or Pentacles with exorcised pen and colours...1061 The Pentacle The pentacle is a specific type of talisman, usually associated with specific magical operation, specific spirit or specific planet, for use by the magician, not a general protection for the magician’s client. The most common structure of the pentacle is a double circle or annulus within which is an inscription (usually in Hebrew or Latin). This annulus contains either a   1059 Wellcome MS 4670, p. 10. 1060 The description appears to have omitted green for Venusian and silver for Lunar talismans. 1061 Mathers (1909), p. 44."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 253 sigil, a letter/number filled square, or an eight-spoked wheel with letters/sigils at the end of each spoke. There are a number of variants on these basic structures. Pentacles are used individually for specific magical operations, or written or engraved together in a group to form a lamen. It is this later use which helps to confirm that they are part of the Solomonic method, rather than free-standing talismans. The Clavicula Salomonis falls into 14 Text-Groups. Each Text-Group is divided into a consistent number of chapters or Books. For example, the Geo Peccatrix Text-Group occurs typically with 48 chapters; the Clavicule Magique Text-group with 16 or 17 chapters; the Abraham Colorno Text-Group is divided into 2 Books of 20-22 chapters, and so on.1062 Pentacles appear in the second book of some Text-Groups of the Clavicula Salomonis which are divided into two Books. 1063 The question arises as to from where are these derived. In an effort to determine the direction of transmission, I have identified four potential sources for the pentacles. These are initially simply arranged in chronological order by earliest manuscript date. Of course this does not mean that the sources are in chronological order, as there could be earlier exemplars of each. As will be seen later, the quality of the pentacles, in terms of wording and draughtsmanship, might be a better indication of the direction of transmission. 1. The earliest manuscript containing a set of pentacles (as distinct from a single example) that I have been able to discover is a mid-13th century Latin manuscript mentioned by Skemer, held in the Canterbury Cathedral Library (see Figure 37).1064 The existence of this manuscript, with drawings of 35 typically Solomonic pentacles, proves that the pentacles had arrived in the Latin world by the mid-13th century, and were not conveyed in the mid-16th century along with the text of the Hygromanteia. This whole parchment is categorised as an amulet by Skemer.1065 In a later passage Skemer admits that this manuscript “could have been used both as a multipurpose textual amulet and as an exemplar for the preparation of amulets and seals, like the Canterbury amulet.1066 A number of factors militate against the Canterbury manuscript being itself an amulet. The most obvious is its size (51.2 x 42.7 cm) when Skemer indicates that despite variations in size, amulets which were “small rectangles no larger than 10.0 x 15.0 were quite common.”1067 Even folded it would have presented a chunky 32-layer bundle 12.8 cm long. More convincing is that it contains text instructing the owner to copy certain sections on to a pectoral amulet:   1062 A full listing of these structures can be found in Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 32. 1063 The AC Text-Group for example. 1064 Canterbury Cathedral Additional MS 23.

The manuscript is however much more than this as it also contains orisons and magical procedures. This confirms that the manuscript is not a passive amulet, but instructions for preparing one. By way of confirmation of its Solomonic nature, its collection of 35 pentacles, grouped into two sets of 15 and 20, is referred to as the “sigils of King Solomon” (below). Furthermore the text contains instructions for conjuring and binding spirits, in a Solomonic mode: Hoc est signum regis salomonis quo demones in puteo signalauit. qui super se portauerit a nocentibus saluus erit. et si demon ei appararuerit iubeat ei quicumque uoluerit et obediet ei dominus enim ad hoc opus dedit salomoni: ut demones compelleret.1069 Effectively this passage confirms that the manuscript is an early Solomonic evocation as it says that this is the seal (signum) of King Solomon, and that the demons will obey he who wears it, “for the Lord gave this seal to King Solomon, so that he might be able to compel the demons.” Despite the pentacle similarity, it is not textually the same as the later Clavicula Salomonis. This manuscript includes not only instructions for control of the spirits, but also supplies the group of 20 pentacles that the magician should wear on his chest during the evocation. The pentacles are meant to be copied as a set on to a lamen, in the same way as the 10 or 24 pentacles are prescribed by the Hygromanteia, for the manufacture of the lamen/ourania (see Figure 38, right hand side) which is then worn on the magician’s chest during the evocation. Further confirmation that the Canterbury Cathedral manuscript is a text of learned magic comes from the quality of its “well-formed Gothic textualis book hand,”1070 and its almost perfect layout. It is therefore most certainly not a simple amulet, nor is it something designed to be gazed at by the owner as suggested by Skemer,1071 after the fashion of a religious icon, or the contemplative and meditative notae1072 of the Ars Notoria.   1068 “And if you do not believe this text, write these characters on an amulet, and immediately tie/bind it upon the breast.” Canterbury Cathedral MS 23, col. 6, lines 19-22. 1069 Canterbury Additional MS 23, col. 6 as transcribed by Skemer (2006), p. 302. 1070 Skemer (2006), p. 199. 1071 As suggested by Skemer (2006), p. 200. 1072 Complex diagrams with geometric shapes and many words related to the subject they purport to rapidly teach.

In the mid 15th century, the earliest manuscript of the Hygromanteia (1440) shows much less detailed, and more vestigial examples of the pentacles, grouped together on a lamen (Figure 38 right hand side). The structure of the lamen or ourania in the Hygromanteia is a key piece of evidence in determining the transmission route of pentacles from the Greek and Jewish worlds to the Latin grimoires. The Byzantine lamen is made up of 10 or 24 ‘seals’ (depending on which manuscript source is consulted). These ‘seals’ are actually very crudely drawn ‘thumbnails’ of the pentacles: circles just containing a single pentagram or an 8-spoked wheel with no text, or any further detail (see Figure 38 right hand side). In the case of the seals in the Hygromanteia, the scribe was obviously less able, or more careless, and simply took a selection of 10 or 24 thumbnail seals to add into the Hygromanteia lamen, rather than using the pentacles individually for specific planets, as is found in the two following sources. It is possible to partly identify some of the seals used in the Byzantine ourania in another manuscript (see Figure 40).1075 It can clearly be seen that many of these are less fully formed versions of pentacles found in the either of the sources listed below. This does not, by the way, argue for the Clavicula being a source for the Hygromanteia, because (as already proven in chapter 4), the transmission of the text is in the opposite direction. There are several pages containing ‘thumbnail seals’ in manuscripts of the Hygromanteia,1076 where they are drawn separately from the lamen, but they are still drawn with very little attention to detail. Because the seals shown in Figure 40 are to be found right at the end of the skrying chapters, and therefore at the end of the manuscript,1077 Marathakis suggests that they are “otherwise irrelevant” to the Hygromanteia.1078 Although they have little or no text describing their use, except for rough captioning, I contend that as these are positioned in the same relative position as the pentacles in respect of the Second Book of the later Clavicula Salomonis. They represent an effort by the scribe trying to, but failing, to add a pentacles section. In terms of manuscript transmission, illustrations (such as the pentacles) seldom go from the crude to the exquisitely detailed, and more often go from the detailed to the rougher copy.   1075 B2, ff. 360. 1076 H, f. 31; B, ff. 17v-18; B2, ff. 360-361v. 1077 B2, ff. 360-1, which fall after the main text on ff. 344-357. 1078 Marathakis (2011), p. 93."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 257 Figure 38: ‘Seals’ or proto-pentacles found in the Hygromanteia (left) as used in the ourania (right).1079 Figure 39: The much simpler apprentice’s or skryer’s phylactery. 1080   1079 H, f. 31, 33. 1080 H, f. 33."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 258 Figure 40: Free-standing ‘seals’ or proto-pentacles from the Hygromanteia.

A much more detailed version of the pentacles (with more correct Hebrew) occurs in the Hebrew manuscript entitled tvtvah rps Sepher ha-Otot, ‘The Book of the Signs/Sigils’ (see Figure 41a).1084 Whilst there are 58 pentacles (including 14 Hebrew and numerical kamea pentacles) in the Sepher ha-Otot, and 44 pentacles in the Mathers’ edition of the Key of Solomon, there are only 10 or 24 crudely drawn ‘seals’ in the Hygromanteia. Although there are 44 ‘pure’ pentacles in both the Clavicula and the Sepher ha-Otot, there are considerable differences in some pentacle designs (four being completely different, two missing, several turned upside down and one being a partial duplicate in Mathers). On the whole however, the Sepher ha-Otot is by far the most reliable source. The natural assumption would be that the initially detailed pentacles (of the Sepher ha-Otot) have been somewhat degraded to give the less accurate pentacles of the Clavicula Salomonis, and then completely degraded and bunched together in groups of 10 or 24 to give the set of lamen seals in the Hygromanteia. It makes sense to conclude that the set of seals in Sepher ha-Otot has been degraded over time by less and less able scribes, till they finally became mere thumbnails (as in the Hygromanteia). It goes against common sense to assume that these seals began life as mere thumbnails and then become progressively more elaborate over time, despite the fact that the chronology of the manuscripts might indicate that.1085 On this basis the Hebrew source supplied the pentacles to both the Greek Hygromanteia and the Latin Clavicula Salomonis. Based on this trajectory of degradation, it is clear that, in the matter of the pentacles, the Sepher ha-Otot, rather than the Hygromanteia, is the ancestor of the second part of the Clavicula Salomonis. This therefore identifies a second major (Jewish) source for the Clavicula Salomonis, a discovery which was not envisaged at the beginning of this thesis. As the pentacles occur only in the ‘Second Book’ of some Text-Groups of the Clavicula Salomonis, it seems clear that these have been appended at a later date. The mid-13th century Canterbury Cathedral manuscript confirms that the pentacles were present in the Latin world long before the Hygromanteia was translated into that language.   1084 This is in the same binding, but not part of, the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh in Rosenthal MS 12, falling after its first 74 folios. These two texts were not related (as there are no pentacles in Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh), but must have travelled together. 1085 The manuscripts chosen to demonstrate this evolution are merely the oldest available, rather than the oldest example exemplar of each tradition."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 262 Figure 41a: Some of the pentacles from the Sepher ha-Otot, showing a lot more detail, and probably their original form.1086 The pentacles can be seen to match up in terms of outline design, but not textually.   1086 Rosenthaliana MS 12, f. f."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 263 The Secret Seal of Solomon Another design needs to be identified as it is often confused with the pentacles and talismans. This is the Secret Seal of Solomon, which has a totally different function, that of stoppering the bottle into which a spirit has been imprisoned. The simplest form of this seal is that shown in the Hygromanteia, which is simply a pentagram. The drawings of the Secret Seal of Solomon became more sophisticated in the Goetia (Figure 42) and the Key of Solomon (Figure 43) but the function was the same. With this figure, it became obvious that although the text of the Hygromanteia is much more detailed and complete than the text of the Clavicula Salomonis, the comparative state of the diagrams and figures in these two sources, is quite the reverse. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that although the text was preserved by successive generations of scribes, the graphical abilities of the Greek scribes were very poor. Mathers refers to the Secret Seal of Solomon rather misleadingly as “the Mystical Figure of Solomon” and whilst acknowledging its function as a spirit bottle seal, gives no details about the bottle itself, which appear to have been lost from the AC manuscripts of the Key of Solomon, from which Mathers worked. Mathers could not resist ‘restoring’ this figure by adding in Kabbalistic words corresponding to the ten Sephiroth, which were never part of the design in the first place. Even less correct, and rather unimaginative, is the string of Hebrew letters running anti-clockwise round the figure from the top. They are not some elaborate nomina magica as one might have expected, but simply the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, in anticlockwise alphabetic order. Complex Planetary Talismans Finally, complex planetary talismans were often generated by magicians for particular tasks made by combining a number of attributes of, for example, a single planet. These may have existed in Byzantium, but their full flowering did not happen till the advent of the Latin grimoires. They are however part of a continuum of development, sometimes incorporating Celestial characteres and nomina magica which date back to the PGM.1087 A typical planetary talisman will often incorporate a planetary square, celestial characters, Hebrew god names and angel names, the seal of the planetary spirit, and so on.

Examples of defixiones have been found in Greece and its colonies as far back as the late 6th century BCE.1091 This practice was designed to utilise the dead (especially those who had died a violent death, or died prematurely) to carry the instructions of the magician to the appropriate Underworld god (typically Hermes, Ge, Hekate and Persephone) or daimon to carry out. As such defixiones were often inserted into the mouth of the cadaver, or at the very least buried alongside the coffin. Defixiones were not meant to benefit the occupant of the tomb, but the magician (or his client) who placed them there. The hieratic phrase for a tomb used in this way is “the noble (mail)-box of Osiris,” or \u001e\u000fJι\u0007 in Greek. Such practices were exported to other parts of the Graeco-Roman world with examples being found in Rome, Athens and even Autun in Burgundy, as well as being popular amongst local magicians.1092 The oldest defixio in the PGM is PGM XL which dates from soon after Alexander the Great’s death in 323 BCE. Despite the fact that Betz, in his Table of Spells, labels it as a ‘curse,’ it is more than that, and is in fact a defixio, designed to act against someone who robbed a tomb of its funeral gifts. This is confirmed by the phrase “my cry for help is deposited here [in the tomb].” Another defixio is meant to compel the love of a specific woman, with the aim of binding “her brain and her hands and her intestines and her genitals, and her heart to love me.” To this end it conjures “boys here who have died prematurely,” as they are presumably still free to roam the Earth till their appointed time. As might be expected, the papyrus was found folded up in a clay vessel and deposited in a cemetery. As if to further charge the magic, the vessel also contained two clay figures having intercourse.1093 The material usually used to make defixiones was lead. A typical defixio text can be recognised by the form of its words, even if the material written on is not lead. The giveaway line is ”I adjure you, daimon of the dead...” which in one instance is repeated no less than eight times.1094 One very clear example of instructions to make a defixio has the full procedure of using a defixio to secure the love/lust of a specific woman. This sequence of procedures is: making clay images of both the magician and the woman of his desire; binding to them a lead plate; burying it near/in a grave; constraining the untimely dead occupants of the grave to carry out the magic; invoking the chthonic gods/goddesses; taking back a remnant from the grave   1091 Johnston (2002), p. 42, but Faraone and Obbink (1991), p. 3 suggest 5th century BC. 1092 Marcillet-Jaubert (1979). 1093 PGM CI. 1-53. 1094 PGM XVI. 1-75."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 to establish a magical link back to the magician; and finally saying over this link another invocation. The magician has thoughtfully added two other versions of the nomina magica.1095 In the invocation, the magician equates Horus with the Moirai (\u0004\t\u0016\u0003\u0002ι) using isopsephy.1096 The Moirai are often translated as the Fates, but the meaning is closer to “they who apportion your just desserts,” rather than just arbitrary fates. The Moirai are especially relevant as, according to Caius Julius Hyginus, they invented the seven Greek vowels. These vowels appear in long strings in many of the invocations in the PGM, each vowel representing a planet. The addition of vowels is what distinguished Greek from its predecessor (primarily consonantal) languages like Phoenician or Hebrew. To take the line of thought a bit further, it is the disposition of these planets (in astrology) which determines the fate (Moirai) of every individual. An ancient figure, which had been treated exactly in this way as described in the rite, was found near Antinoopolis1097 in a clay vase, together with a lead defixio.1098 Both the treatment of the figure, (which has her arms bound, with her knees drawn up, and pierced by 13 copper needles) and the Greek inscription, correspond almost exactly to the instructions in PGM IV, 296-466. Strange as it may seem, the needles are not meant to harm the ‘victim’ like a voodoo doll, but simply to obsess her with love for the client for whom the magic was done. The description of these dolls by some scholars as “voodoo dolls” is both anachronistic and misleading in terms of function.1099 The text and figure date to the 3rd or 4th centuries CE. Ritner confirms that the procedure with the copper needles is of ancient Egyptian origin.1100 At the level of popular practice, defixiones spread from Egypt across the Roman Empire, but defixiones do not appear as a method in either the Hygromanteia or later Latin grimoires, and did not become part of the Solomonic method, as such they are a clear example of a discontinuity.   1095 PGM IV. 296-466. 1096 Lines 455-456.

This city commemorates Hadrian’s companion Antinoüs who had earlier drowned in the Nile nearby after a journey to Hermopolis. The Egyptians explained to Hadrian that the mysterious drowning effectively deified Antinoüs, who had, by this, been taken to the bosom of Osiris. This reasoning is also behind the use of actively drowned animals in many Egyptian and PGM magical rites, and their later mummification (see chapter 7.6). Antinoopolis was a resolutely pagan city during its heyday, and actively welcomed magicians as residents. I would not be surprised if the tombs amongst its ruins were at some future time found to contain many magical papyri. 1098 Louvre inventory E. 27145. 1099 Faraone in Classical Antiquity (1991), pp. 165-220.

Liddell and Scott note that it is an imported Persian word meaning “a mounted courier, such as were kept ready at regular stages throughout Persia for carrying royal despatches.” This word could be as easily applied to the messengers of a king as to the messengers of a god. Angels have been an important object of invocation from the PGM through the Hygromanteia and the European grimoires to the present day, when their popularity with New Age enthusiasts appears to be undiminished. The Graeco-Egyptian papyri usually only mention the four well-known Biblical angels, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel and Uriel.1101 These have obviously been derived from Jewish sources, and they usually only appear in a line-up of god and angel names, rather than being individually conjured. In the Christian era in Byzantium, the invocation of angels became a major part of magical ritual. The Christian cult of the angels is likely to have sprung from heretical Jewish beliefs about angels.1102 This belief was then stoked by works such as the Celestial Hierarchy by pseudo-Dionysius. By making the angels part of a detailed hierarchy of spiritual creatures, it was only a small step to placing them in control of an equivalent descending hierarchy of demons. This extension of their responsibilities and powers saw them being inserted into the sequence of Solomonic magic, and being invoked to help control the daimones/demons that were subsequently evoked. In the PGM the names of angels were just part of the list used to threaten lesser spiritual creatures. In the Hygromanteia, they are part of the second procedure in the classic Solomonic sequence of consecratio, invocatio, evocatio, ligatio, licentia. In some parts of the Byzantine Empire, angels, particularly Michael, even became objects of their own religious cults focussing on the angel rather than any god. Michael became the centre-piece of his own cult which flourished at Chonae (Colossae) East of Ephesus in Phrygia (Asia Minor). In Egypt, religious veneration even extended to Michael assuming the role of the Nile God and being held responsible for the rain and the dew.1103 Chapter 11 of the Hygromanteia, which deals with the invocation of angels, is definitely a core part of the ritual, especially as the magician relies upon the angels to control the corresponding demon. In recent literature these angels, in the context of this responsibility,   1101 The first three angels are mentioned in the Bible, the fourth in the Book of Tobit. 1102 Peers (2001), p. 8. 1103 Peers (2001), p. 7."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 are referred to as “thwarting angels.” The preliminary conjuration of angels, for this specific purpose, has long been a traditional magical method and appears in most of the extant manuscripts.1104 The concept of thwarting angels dates back at least to the Book of Tobit, in which the angel Raphael advises Tobias how to repel the demon Asmodeus by burning the liver and heart of a certain fish. This is followed by the angel binding the demon, demonstrating that certain angels have control over specific demons.1105 The story is set in the 8th century BCE, although most scholars date the appearance of the book to the 2nd century BCE. A number of thwarting angels are also very clearly listed and identified as such in the 1st/2nd century CE text the Testament of Solomon.1106 Of the 60 demons listed in that text, as least half are listed with the name of the specific angel that binds or constrains them.1107 The procedure of using the thwarting angel is a major magical procedure. The prescribed modus operandi is that the magician conjures the angels, by the power of God’s name, who in their turn subdues the demon to the magician’s will, which will then carry out the actual operation. At no point is the magician thought to have miraculous powers of his own by which he could do these things unaided. The text of the conjuration of the angels in the Hygromanteia is one standard format, into which the magician must supply the correct angelic names, drawn from the tables to be found in chapter 13 of the Hygromanteia. The use of an angel controlling the demon is a key part of procedure in the Hygromanteia, but has almost disappeared (or become a verbal instruction) in the Clavicula Salomonis. The only exception to this is Thomas Rudd’s version of the Lemegeton, where the thwarting angel is so much a key part of the procedure that its sigil and name are added to the reverse side of the demon’s sigil.1108 This grimoire also recommends that a brass or iron container be made within which the 72 spirits of the Goetia can be imprisoned (or at least threatened with imprisonment). An engraving of this device (see Figure 32) shows the Seal of Solomon placed over its mouth (see Figure 42), and the names (in Hebrew) of the 72 thwarting angels which correspond to each of those 72 demons. This resurrection of ancient Solomonic techniques by Thomas Rudd in the mid 17th century shows a depth of knowledge about magic unequalled by the authors of other grimoire manuscripts circulating in the same century.   1104 It appears in A, A2, B, B3, G, H M, P, P2 and P4. B3 even repeats the conjuration three times. 1105 Tobit 8:1-3. 1106 McCown (1922); Duling (1983). 1107 The rest are controlled by specific words written on papyrus, herbs or pious expletives. 1108 Skinner and Rankine (2007), pp. 71-72."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 Angels form a considerable part of the corpus of Latin grimoires particularly in grimoires like Juratus. Much of this material has been extensively examined by scholars such as Claire Fanger, Richard Kieckhefer, Frank Klaassen and Benedek Láng in the recent past, and so does not need any more reiteration here. 1109 It is worthy noting however that grimoires such as the Ars Notoria, despite being pseudepigraphically attributed to Solomon, do not use the Solomonic method, but instead rely on prayer and notae.1110 5.5.2 Evocation of Daimones and Spirits One surprising example of a straightforward invocation of an infernal demon occurs as part of an invisibility rite in the PGM. One might assume that such a rite would not normally need this procedure. The magician initially identifies himself with Osiris as part of his magical ‘credentials.’ Its form is very like the form of later grimoire evocations: I am Anubis, I am Osir-Phre,1111 I am Osot Soronouier, I am Osiris whom Seth destroyed. Rise up, infernal daimon, IK Erbēth IK Phobēth IK Pakerbēth IK Apomps; whatever I, NN, order you to do, be obedient to me.1112 Its uniqueness is in the identification of the subject of the invocation (Erbēth Phobēth Pakerbēth) specifically as an infernal daimon(s), rather than to the nebulous category of nomina magica, to which these words have previously been assigned. It is therefore likely that the words used in the last two lines of this rite, MARMARIAŌTH MARMARIPHEGGĒ to reverse the spell are also daimon names. The Hygromanteia, in the form that has reached us in extant manuscripts, has two methods of conjuration. The first method is to be found in chapters 31-39, whilst the second method is to be found in chapters 40-43.1113 It is obvious that at some time in the past these two methods came from different sources. However the general procedure is the same, with just the nomina magica and sequencing changing. Chapter 37 of the Hygromanteia contains a preliminary prayer followed by three evocations of demons. One version prefaces the prayer with three Psalms (23, 102 and 121).1114 The nomina magica are a mixture of corrupt Greek, Hebrew and Gnostic names such as: Adonagē Melekh, Tetragrammaton, A and W, Phanē[s], Abrasas, Amoun-ameth and Adonel.   1109 Fanger (1998 and 2012), Kieckhefer (1998 and 2003), Klaassen (1998), Láng (2008). 1110 Notae are elaborate diagrams which summarise a particular subject in such a way, that in conjunction with specific prayers, greatly facilitates the learning of that subject. 1111 Osiris-Ra conjoined. 1112 PGM I. 247-262. 1113 With three additional specialised rites in chapters 44-46, which are separated from the main conjuration by the words “The end of the art...” indicating that these three chapters were added at a later date. 1114 KJV numbering, identified by their opening lines in B, f. 22."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 The conjuration of 13 demons1115 that follows this prayer is made using the names of God, the angels, Principalities, Thrones, Dominions,1116 the Cherubim, the Seraphim, the seven planets, seven metals, by heaven, by earth and even by the rivers. The conjuration by the seven planets relates to the passage earlier in the same rite where the magician has already said a prayer to the planet which governs the day of his operation. Finally the angels Mikhaēl, Barakhēel, Phamothēel, Ourouēl, Gabriēl and Rhaphaēl are used to force the appearance of these 13 demons. Later in the evocation the power of “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob and the God of Israel” is used to compel the spirits’ appearance. This particular formula also appears in the PGM, but does not directly indicate Jewish origins. Chapter 37 offers a further important indication of the sequence of transmission. The presence of senior demons like Loutzipher (Lucifer), Beelzeboul, Asmedai and Mastraōth (i.e. Astarōth), names which were usually omitted from the later Latin grimoires, shows that in the Hygromanteia the hierarchy of hell is more intact, and therefore (as we have already established) it comes chronologically before the Clavicula Salomonis. These four are said to rule the four directions, or four continents. Below them, and in later texts replacing them, are the four Demon Kings Paimon, Ariton, Egyn, Maymon or variants on those names (see chapter 5.2.2).1117 Other names appeared for the “Infernall kings” in 17th century grimoires, like Sitrael, Melanta, Thamaor, Ssalour and Sitraml.1118 Chapter 43 contains the General Conjuration, as used in the second method of conjuration.1119 These conjurations use the names of the four Demon Kings previously conjured and the names of God, to force the spirits to appear in a pleasant and human form. The usual god names appear, like Alpha and Omega, Sabaoth, Elion, Tetragrammaton, and the four standard archangels (Mikhaēl, Gabriēl, Ourouēl, Rhaphaēl)1120 but these are interlaced with a number of god names and angel names which do not seem to be attested in any other grimoire. Many of them have however been formed by the Jewish practice of simply adding ‘-iel’ to the end of a common Hebrew noun,1121 but there are also a lot of distinctly Greek angel names.   1115 Only 12 in H. 1116 The last three categories being a very Christian addition. 1117 Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 312; Skinner and Rankine (2009), pp. 22, 44-45. 1118 Scot (1584), p. 414.

At this point in the rite the lamen (phylactery) is touched by the right hand of the magician to ensure his safety. With his left hand, he is supposed to point towards the earth in the direction the spirits are expected to appear from, as if to point to the place where they should materialise. When they do, the names of the four Demon Kings are used to subjugate the demons, which also have to swear obedience in the name of their king. Finally, the king himself is also sworn. This is obviously meant to be a one-time procedure for the first time the magician conducts this evocation, after which the magician will simply rely upon the oath of a particular spirit, without necessarily repeating the full conjuration sequence, to order that spirit to do a specific task. In the vernacular grimoires like the Goetia, the structure of the evocation is even more formalised. The sequence of conjurations, getting stronger each time is repeated in the pattern of conjurations in the Goetia: The First Conjuration for to call forth any of the aforesaid spirits. The Second Conjuration The Constraint The Conjuration for to Invocate the Kinge The Generall Curse, called the spirits Chaine against all spirits that Rebell. [Lesser Curse] The Conjuration of the fire The Greater Curse.1122 Each step is designed to be stronger than the last. The evocation of demons remained, and remains, a central staple of magical practice, across all periods. 5.5.3 Nomina magica The most important of all spoken words used in magic are the names of the spiritual creatures being evoked or invoked. Next in importance are the nomina magica that are used to constrain these creatures. The pseudepigraphical Tenth Hidden Book of Moses begins by addressing this need: You should also take, child, for this personal vision, [a list] the gods of the days and the hours and the weeks, those given in the book, and the twelve rulers of the months, and the seven-letter name which is in the first book,1123 and which you also have written in the Key,1124 which [name] is great and marvellous, as it is what brings alive all your books.1125   1122 Peterson (2001), pp. 48-55; Skinner and Rankine (2007), pp. 176-185. The text has been regularised to include the glosses. 1123 Not identified. 1124 The text of this Egyptian Key has not been identified. It is an interesting thought that this Key might in some way be connected with the Clavicula Salomonis. 1125 PGM XIII. 734-741."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 The idea of a supreme name which gives life to all the other words, or books of magic, is intriguing indeed. Great secrecy is enjoined: ...you are to keep it secret, child, for in it there is the name of the lord, which is Ogdoas,1126 the god who commands and directs all things, since to him angels, archangels, he-daimones, she-daimons, and all things under the creation have been subjected.1127 This name is being put forward by the scribe as the name that commands all the other spiritual creatures. It is possible that ‘Ogdoas’1128 is just a title for the set of the eight primal Egyptian gods, and the name it represents is actually still hidden from the reader. The same passage continues to enumerate the other names which are needed by the magician to enforce his will, in some cases to be used through the boy medium necessary in evocatory skrying operations: There are also prefaced [to that book] four other names, that of nine letters [AEĒ EĒI OYŌ] and that of fourteen letters [YSAU SIAUE IAŌUS] and that of twenty-six letters [ARABBAOUARABA] and that of Zeus [CHONAI IEMOI CHO ENI KA ABIA SKIBA PHOROUOM EPIERTHAT]. You may use these [names] on boy-mediums who do not see the gods, so that one [medium] will see unavoidably, and [also use them] for all spells and needs [such as]: inquiries, prophesies by Helios, prophecies by visions in mirrors. And for the compulsive spell [to call tardy spirits] you should use the great name which is Ogdoas, the god who directs all things throughout the creation. [For] without him simply nothing will be accomplished.1129 Such names play an important part in the magic of the PGM, Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. The name of nine letters (AEĒ EĒI OYŌ) is obviously a version of the Greek seven vowel invocatory combinations. ARABBA_OUARABA may have later morphed into ABRACADABRA,1130 and IAŌUS is obviously closely related to IAŌ. Although some of the words changed over time, words such as IAŌ and SABAŌTH remained constant across all periods from the PGM onwards for the following two millennia. The nomina magica are a particularly important part of magic. The inherent conservatism of ancient magicians about these words comes from the desire to retain the original pronunciation, rather than the original spelling, which anyway is often from a different and imperfectly understood language. As Johnston concludes: They were never supposed to be translated into more familiar languages, lest they lose their particular power to please and attract the god to whom they belong.1131 A classic case is the well-known translation of hvhi to IAW. Transliterated into the Roman alphabet the words IHVH and IAO don’t appear to have very much in common. However if   1126 This name, being just a Neoplatonic term, is rather a disappointment. 1127 PGM XIII. 734-747. 1128 Similar to ‘Ennead.’ 1129 PGM XIII. 747-755. 1130 An alternative derivation from the Hebrew Ha-Brachah-dabarah ([in the] Name of the Blessed) is suggested by Skemer (2006), p. 25. 1131 Johnston (2008), p. 154."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 274 you know that v or ‘V’ can be used as a vowel ‘O’ and that I or ‘I’ can equally be pronounced ‘Y’ then you are half way to seeing how this transliteration occurred, as the two can both be pronounced something like ‘Yah-ooh.’1132 The point is that determination of the original words of the nomina magica relies much more on sound-alike considerations than the checking of exactly the same spelling in dictionaries of culturally adjacent foreign languages. As there are very few gaps and almost no punctuation in many of the PGM names, it is assumed that the original reader would have known where the word breaks occurred. Not so easy however for the modern reader without the same cultural background. Some of the word breaks in the nomina magica proposed by Betz and his fellow editors do violence to the original nomina. Using techniques like isopsephy/gematria it is sometimes possible to break up these words, or at least separate out specific words from the mass of letters. Others can be separated out by comparison with their occurrence elsewhere. A good example of this is SESENGENBARPHARANGĒS which is also found divided up as SESENGEN bar PHARANGĒS, a word which now takes on the structure of a Semitic name, ‘Sesengen son of Pharanges.’ 1133 Despite considerable controversy about the meaning of this name it is possibly a Semitic rendering of the god Harpocrates, as supported by this passage: ...the figure of an infant child seated upon a lotus,1134 O rising one, O you of many names, SESENGENBARPHARANGĒS.1135 Harpocrates is the “child seated upon a lotus.” ‘Sesengen bar Pharanges’ also appears in Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi,1136 which is no surprise because of the close connection between Harpocrates and some Gnostic doctrines.1137 According to Brashear, the nomina magica were absent from the earlier Greek papyri in the centuries BCE, and first started to appear only in the 1st century of the Christian era.1138 The nomina magica resolve into several types: a. Names of spirits, demons, angels or gods that may be either Egyptian or Greek in   1132 The correct pronunciation of the Hebrew word hvhi was allegedly lost by the Jewish community shortly before the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 CE, but the Greek IAW might in fact offer some help in reconstructing its pronunciation. 1133 ‘Bar’ is Aramaic for ‘son of’ as ‘ben’ is Hebrew for the same designation. 1134 Harpocrates is the rising sun, and the child seated upon the lotus with his finger to his mouth in a gesture of silence. 1135 PGM II. 107-108. 1136 Nag Hammadi, III, 2 and IV, 2. 1137 Schwartz (1996), p. 254 suggests that this name relates to ssn mgw, ‘Sesen the Mage,’ on a Sassanian seal-amulet who was associated with date palm fronds, but this seems a little distant from the name under consideration. 1138 Brashear (1995), p. 3430."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 origin like ‘Erbeth Pakerbeth.’1139 As Porreca states: ...the celestial and infernal hierarchies have been part of the traditional sources of potency for ritual practitioners from the very beginning of the Western magical tradition...the names of angels and/or demons were seen as inherently powerful in themselves.1140 Hence the names were not to be changed or translated. This results in a lot of transliteration, which often obscures their original source whilst retaining their sound. b. Words ending in –el,-iel, -im or –oth, implying a definite Hebrew origin.1141 These are then often transliterated. For example Sabaoth is the Greek form of the Hebrew god name tvabx. c. Strings of Greek vowels which rely upon the associations built up between each vowel, its angel, musical note, planet, god/goddess, etc. PGM V. 24-30 and VII 766-779 tell exactly how these vowels should be pronounced or sung. The doctrine of the Greek vowels which relies on musical harmonics and other measures familiar to ancient Greek philosophers proves that these particular nomina magica are of Greek origin.1142 d. The instruction to hiss or make popping or barking sounds. These relate to the traditional animal associations of specific gods, such as the snake (hiss) and crocodile (pop) of Harpocrates, or the dog (bark) of Hekate. These are exactly the sounds the magician was to make, which called to mind, and helped invoke, a specific god. e. Palindromes such as Ablanathanalba.1143 These words really only have a visual effect. When they are pronounced they are not obviously palindromic. Their ingredients are however often extensions of real Greek or Hebrew words. f. Letters arranged in geometric shapes like triangles or ‘wings.’ These are often a single word, repeated on each line, with one letter successively chopped off it, till only one letter remains at the final point. See Figure 34.   1139 These two words definitely relate to demons (see PGM I. 252-3). If they are of Hebrew origin then a possible derivation may relate to Hkp ‘to flow out,’ in its masculine form of ]p meaning a ‘flask.’ tob is ‘to be terrified.’ The most intriguing possible translation is ‘the terrifying flask,’ which might relate to Solomon’s traditional threat to imprison the spirits in a metal flask which is then thrown into a lake or the sea. 1140 Porreca (2010), p.17. 1141 The –el ending is the name of god El added to a stem to form an angelic name. The endings –im and –oth are respectively the male and female plural endings in Hebrew. 1142 The singing of the seven vowels was an important invocatory skill and very pleasant to listen to, according to Pseudo-Demetrius in On Style, 71: “In Egypt the priests, when singing hymns in praise of the gods, employ the seven vowels, which they utter in due succession; and the sound of these letters is so euphonious that men listen to it in preference to flute and lyre.” 1143 This is claimed in the text of PGM V. 475 to be Hebrew."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 276 g. Words from other languages as yet unrecognisable or unrecognised, sometimes referred to as voces mysticae for that reason. I believe that very few of these words are arbitrary inventions, but simply have as yet unrecognisable roots. A fertile source might have been the copying of Demotic words into Greek. One classic case of three apparently unrecognisable and unattested ‘nonsensical’ words is “Thoulal, Moulal and Boulal.” They were found in a Yale papyrus containing some Coptic Psalms which was published in 1974. The editor assumed they were nomina magica and probably the names of spirits. Only later, when correctly transliterated were they recognised as the Coptic version of the names of the three magi (or magicians) who visited Jesus, soon after his birth. As magi/magicians they were very legitimate additions to an invocation by the Coptic magician who wrote the papyrus.1144 Their names anyway derive from a Greek manuscript written in Alexandria circa 500 CE, at the end of the PGM period.1145 I believe there are many more cases like this, where apparent nomina magica have real meaning, especially where transliteration from one language to another has been at play. On the whole Greek, Hebrew and Egyptian words provide the bulk of the derivations of the nomina magica. Babylonia appears to only lend a few god/goddess names like Erishkigal, and none of the nomina magica except eulamo (‘eternal’) to the PGM. It is tempting to ascribe a Gnostic origin to some of the words, but when they are analysed these words are simply either Hebrew, Greek, or a Greek rendering of Hebrew or Demotic. It is most likely that the Gnostics borrowed from the magicians, rather than the reverse, as magicians were often the founders of Gnostic groups. Jackson is quite certain that the direction of borrowing was from the magical texts to Gnosticism, not the other way round: I think that we can indeed be quite sure that the direction of the borrowing runs, as in the Sethian texts...from the magicians to the author of the Pistis Sophia and not the reverse, for, as in the three cases above, where any meaning at all has been wrung from them, the words [aberamenthō, agrammachamarei and bainchōōōch] are quite peculiar and appropriate to a magical context but not to a Gnostic one. ...one or all of the forms attested in the magic papyri are the original(s), of which those that occur in Gnostic literature are derivatives. ...The case for derivation of the Sethian Gnostic names Ialdabaoth and Barbelo from the magic tradition is strengthened by the sheer number of other cases in which names in the Sethian Gnostic system either undeniably or at least quite possibly [are] derived from the incantatory voces magicae and nomina barbara of the magicians.1146 As an example of how apparently meaningless nomina magica may actually have a concrete meaning, and how a knowledge of magical methods may help in such an analysis, I would like to address a line that has caused considerable controversy. Perhaps the oldest Greek   1144 Brashear (1995), p. 3438. 1145 Translated into Latin as Excerpta Latina Barbari. 1146 Jackson (1989), pp. 70-72, 75."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 nomina magica are the Ephesian Letters which also appear in two PGM passages:1147 \u001b\u0014\u0005\u0006\t\u0013 \u0005\u0002\u000b!\u0014\u0005ι\t\u0013 /ιJ \u000b+\u000b\u0003\u0002J =\u0002\u0004\u0013\u0002\u0004\f\u0013\f\u000f\u00077\u0002\u0014ι\t\u0013 Many interpretations have been proposed for this sentence. My interpretation is that it is actually a spirit binding (which probably related to the statue upon whose pediment the inscription was first seen in Ephesus).1148 It is made up of the following ingredients: Askios means ‘unshaded,’ and Kataskios means ‘in shadow.’ These first two words form an attractive contrast of opposites, and this meaning has therefore attracted most scholarly approbation. But I think that the exact spelling produces a more cogent result: Askion means ‘empty threats,’ such as you might use to bind a spirit. Kata means (amongst other possibilities) ‘down’ so kataskion then might mean ‘threats expressed downwards,’ to the occupants of the Underworld.1149 Lix Tetrax is the name of the fourth demon catalogued in the Testament of Solomon.1150 Damnameneus is clearly identified as a goddess in the PGM, specifically the goddess of the fourth hour.1151 Aisios means auspicious or opportune.1152 Put this together, and the Ephesia Grammata might be translated as: “I threaten and [bind] down Lix Tetrax [by] the auspicious goddess Damnameneus.” Assuming, for the moment, that the Testament of Solomon demons (after Ornias) are attributed sequentially to the hours,1153 then the goddess and the demon both relate to the fourth hour. One well known magical formula is the use of the angel who thwarts the corresponding demon. This is highly significant as it means that this goddess may have been the thwarting   1147 PGM VII. 215-18; LXX. 4-25. 1148 If this interpretation is correct then archaeologists might well find something rather interesting under the pediment on which the Ephesia grammata were inscribed, if such a pediment can be found. 1149 If “shadowy” is taken as the meaning of kataskion then the first two words may read “dark threats.” 1150 Ornias is not part of the series as he was the assistant demon who introduced Solomon to each of the other demons in turn. Lix Tetrax is described in the Testament of Solomon as a dust-devil, said to be the “offspring of the Great One,” and to reside in the “horn of the Moon in the South.” He “makes whirlwinds; brings darkness to men; sets fields on fire; destroys homesteads and heals Hemitertian fever.” 1151 Damnameneus is referred to as an “avenging goddess, strong goddess [in the] rite of ghosts...” (PGM IV. 2780). Damnameneus is also the Egyptian ruler of the 4th hour of the day in a Helios invocation (PGM III. 510-511). She is also featured amongst the nomina magica on the underside of a throne (PGM II. 164) and on a Stele of Aphrodite (PGM VII. 215-18) which confirms her goddess nature. 1152 The spelling is uncertain, being either asion or aisia. But related words produce similar meanings such as happiness, luck, good omen, or destined. Therefore, the interpretation of “auspicious or opportune” seems to be correct. If however the correct spelling is \"\u0014ι\t\u0007, then ‘Asian’ in the sense that it was in ancient times applied to Lydia would be correct. In which case “auspicious Damnameneus” should read “Lydian Damnameneus,” which is also quite appropriate, as Lydia is just a short distance inland from Ephesus, which is where Pausanias claims these words were first found. 1153 Discussion of the evidence for that attribution would take the discussion too far away from the main points being made."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 278 angel/goddess corresponding to Lix Tetrax, whose job it was to bind him.

This is just one demonstration of how a knowledge of magical techniques (in this case binding and the use of a thwarting angel/goddess of the same hour) may help in the decipherment of nomina magica. A number of other examples could easily have been instanced. The attempt to preserve the original language of the nomina magica is rooted in the concept that the gods and other spiritual creatures best understand their original language. Any changes to this may render the invocation unintelligible to the god or spiritual creature concerned, and therefore be ineffective. This is reinforced by Iamblichus’ 3rd century CE comments on the use of such nomina magica in Egyptian magic and Mystery Religions: But “why, of meaningful names, do we prefer the barbarian [foreign names] to our own?” For this, again, there is a mystical reason. For, since the gods have shown that the entire dialect of the sacred peoples such as the Assyrians and the Egyptians is appropriate for religious ceremonies, for this reason we must understand that our communication with the gods should be in an appropriate tongue. Also, such a mode of speech is the first and the most ancient. But most importantly, since those who learned the very first names of the gods merged them with their own familiar tongue and delivered them to us, as being proper and adapted to these [religious] things, forever we [must] preserve here the unshakeable law of tradition... It is therefore evident from this that the language of sacred peoples is preferred to that of other men, and with good reason. For the names do not exactly preserve the same meaning when they are translated; rather, there are certain idioms in every nation that are impossible to express in the language of another. Moreover, even if one were to translate them, this would not preserve their same power... For all these reasons, then, they [the barbarian names] are adapted to [communicate with] the superior beings.1155 Of course the result of conserving the ancient pronunciation is that the spelling gets more and more corrupted as the words are passed from one culture to another and from one alphabet to another, especially in the case of Egyptian to Greek, via the medium of Coptic. Coptic is effectively Egyptian words spelled in Greek, with the addition of at least seven further letters designed to convey sounds that don’t exist in Greek. It is for that reason that many of the passages in the PGM have their nomina magica glossed in ‘Old Coptic’ by the scribe or the original owner of the papyrus, so that Greek readers will know how to pronounce words that were originally Egyptian. The upside of this is that the presence of a Coptic gloss almost guarantees that the original words were Egyptian. Secondly, it leaves the reader with a reasonable chance of getting the pronunciation right. The downside is that the hieratic spelling (and therefore the meaning) of the word may well be lost.   1154 Faraone and Kotansky (1988), p. 264. 1155 Iamblichus, De Mysteriis VII. 4-5 in Clarke et al, (2003), pp. 296-299."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 279 Although nomina magica are names whose uncorrupted derivation is in many cases unknown, I believe they are not deliberately fabricated nonsense syllables, as their function was to coerce spirits, gods or angels. To be an effective form of coercion they must have originally had a meaning, rather than just being nonsense.1156 These words will, in many cases, be names, as the theory behind such coercion falls into three name-related methods: i) The named entity can be used to coerce the lesser entity, as it is of a higher rank, (i.e. the name of an arch-demon may be used to coerce a lesser demon, or the name of a god used to coerce a daimon) or the name of a thwarting angel. ii) The name of a famous magician or exorcist who in the past has effectively commanded the spirits is used, such as Solomon, or even Jesus. In this context the operation is not necessarily of Jewish or Christian derivation, but simply utilising the name of a famous magician to terrify the spirit. iii) A more Egyptian approach to this appears with the identification of the magician with such an ancient worthy or god, like the claim “I am Paphro Onosophris...” All these procedures are later found passed on in both the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. If we suspend disbelief temporarily, it might seem strange that spirits would fall for such false claims made by a magician acting in the name of a dead magician, who the current performer has never met. The explanation for this is threefold: that the spirit is unwilling to risk it; that the spirit cannot read the magician’s mind or that the power of words is real in these realms. All three explanations have been given at various points in the history of magic. The conclusion is that coercion can only be effective if the names named are correctly pronounced, have some basis in real words, and represent beings of a superior rank to the entity being evoked. It is therefore certain that, with this in mind, no competent magician would consciously generate nonsense syllables for the purpose of coercion, as that would be self-defeating. Therefore, in many cases, the nomina magica are proper nouns like Solomon or ‘Sesengen bar Pharanges.’ The latter is obviously a proper noun, as it has the structure of ‘Sesengen son of Pharanges.’ Pharanges may be related to Phre, and Harpocrates was the son of the sun (Horus or Phre).1157   1156 No ancient magician would have thought that some random nursery nonsense syllables would have been effective in ordering around a recalcitrant, and possibly dangerous, spirit or demon. 1157 Sesengen bar Pharanges also occurs in Nag Hammadi III, 2 and IV, 2 as well as PGM IV, 964-67. This name is sometimes taken into Greek as Seseggen bar Pharagges, where ‘\u0013\b’ is written ‘\b\b.’ Scholem suggested that it was an angel’s name, implying ‘the purifier,’ which seems inherently unlikely. Mastrocinque (2005), p. 120 suggests ‘Sesenggen son of Tartarus’ (assuming Pharanges = pharangos = Tartarus), but that also seems unlikely."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 280 Rebecca Lesses summarises the possible derivations of these nomina magica as: The names consist of proper names of particular deities and angels, name-formulas (logia) such as “Sesengen bar Pharanges,” strings of letters of the Hebrew or Greek alphabet (especially vowels), permutations of the Tetragrammaton, and combinations of the names [or titles] of God with other letters.1158 Daniel and Maltomini admit that: It is a well-known fact that editorial division and analysis of magical words is often nothing other than guess work, among other reasons because so many are unparalleled, because the ancient texts for the most part lack word division, and because much is meaningless gibberish that cannot be explained by Egyptian, Hebrew and other languages. A number of the shorter “words” listed below will of necessity be wrong divisions. Also a number of the longer “words” must occasionally contain shorter, meaningful elements that have not been correctly isolated.1159 As such there is much scope for hunting down precursors and incorrupt forms of such names, a process that has been begun by Porreca.1160 The correct pronunciation of the nomina magica is not often specified, but just one passage in the PGM actually gives what that scribe considered to be the ‘correct’ pronunciation: the “A” with an open mouth, undulating like a wave; the “O” succinctly, as a breathed threat, the “IAŌ” [directed] to earth, to air, and to heaven; the “Ē” like a baboon [screech?]; the “O” in the same way as above;1161 the “E” with enjoyment, aspirating it, the “Y” like a shepherd, drawing out the pronunciation.1162 When Mesopotamian, Greek and Semitic magic were added to the mix, so the range of words of power increased from just Egyptian ones by the addition of such names as Hekate, Ereshkigal, Nebutosualeth, Abraham, Adonai, Solomon, Moses, Sabaoth, Anael or Boel.1163 These names, with a few exceptions (for example Nebutosualeth), remain part of the Solomonic magical literature up to the present day. The Eighth Book of Moses is very conscious that it draws its nomina magica from different linguistic sources and makes a determined effort to identify them. This is not so obvious in Betz’s continuous text translation, but comes to life when the lines are separated out:   1158 Lesses (1996), p. 52. 1159 Daniel and Maltomini (1991), p. 325. 1160 Porreca (2010), pp. 23-25. 1161 This suggests that O and W should be pronounced in the same way. 1162 PGM V. 24-30. 1163 See Brashear (1995), p. 3396. Bo’el is mentioned in the mediaeval parts of the Sepher ha-Razim, and occurs later in several European grimoires."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 281 I call on you, lord, [whose name is] [written] in ‘birdglyphic’:1164 ARAI; [written] in hieroglyphic: LAILAM; [written] in Hebraic: ANOCH1165 BIATHI ARBATH1166 [written in] BERBIR:1167 ECHILATOUR BOUPHROUMTROM; [written] in Egyptian: ALDABAEIM; [written] in Baboonic: ABRASAX; [85] [written] in Falconic: CHI CHI CHI CHI CHI CHI CHI TIPH TIPH TIPH CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA;1168 [written] in Hieratic: MENE PHŌIPHŌTH.1169 Even though the language labels might seem a little strange, like ‘Baboonic’ for Gnostic Coptic, there is no doubting a scholarly striving by the original scribe to correctly define the nomina magica, their pronunciation, and their origins. There were often warnings in Hermetic and Neoplatonic texts (such as Iamblichus’ well-known warning) not to translate or change the spelling of such words of power.1170 Some gods have their own specific formula, which can then be used to identify the god being invoked, such as the invocation to Typhon/Set which uses “Iō Erbēth Iō Pakerbēth Iō Bolchosēth.”1171 Some words are derived from a description of the original word, such as \u0019\u0003\u001d\u0002\u000eι\u0002\u0017, Arbathiaō. This is derived from the Hebrew tobra arboth, meaning ‘four’ and \u0018\u0002\u0017 derived from the Hebrew IHVH or hvhi: in other words this is yet another Greek form of the four-lettered name of God, IAO or hvhi, IHVH. Transmission of the Names of Gods and Spirits Trans-culturally   1164 The following seven languages may in fact be seven different scripts, but obviously it is not just a case of straight transliteration. They have here been split into separate lines for ease of comparison. The inclusion of all these forms is an attempt to preserve all the clues necessary to the correct pronunciation of these nomina magica by the scribe. Hieroglyphic and Hebrew are subject to ordinary linguistic analysis. Egyptian is likely to be a phonetic rendering of the commonly spoken Egyptian of the time (maybe Coptic?). Baboonic is a code word for Gnostic or hermetic literature, as the baboon = Thoth = Hermes = Hermetic or Gnostic. Hieratic is simply the script form of ancient Egyptian. Falconic seems like an onomatopoeic rendering of a bird’s cry. The positioning of ‘Birdglyphic’ at the beginning suggests that it performed a specific function in relation to the other languages rather than being a language on its own. It seems possible that it was prefaced by the glyph of a bird designed to indicate a special function, possibly a method of pronunciation for all the following languages. 1165 Should be ‘anoki’ according to Betz (1996), p. 174. 1166 The last word has been divided, as ARBATH clearly means ‘four’ in Hebrew. It relates to the Greek \u0019\u0003\u001d\u0002\u000eι\u0002\u0017, meaning the fourfold god \u0018\u0002\u0017. 1167 I suggest that this is yet another linguistic category (Berber) that has been mistakenly worked into the text as if it were part of a long nomina magica. 1168 The “CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA” was originally placed after the hieratic by the editor, but is clearly an overflow from the Falconic line, and so has been moved up one line, where it now forms a symmetrical nomina magica. This name now repeats its elements in the familiar 7-3-7 format. 1169 The last word has been split.

One of the first attempts to do this was Crowley's 777 followed more recently by my Complete Magician’s Tables.1172 The second necessary step is the matching of these names, including their variants, across different sources. This has been begun with Porreca’s excellent study of just three sources.1173 However his study only listed obviously matching names, rather than exhaustively listing all possible gods, angels, daimones, demons or spirits. Obviously this table could be widened much further. Such a tabulation of the names of spiritual creatures is key for showing the dependency and transmission of texts, as these words are (in theory) the most jealously guarded/preserved parts of any invocation. In Porreca’s study, exactly half of the names identified were of Hebraic origin.1174 Greek was the next most common language,1175 then Egyptian, as might have been expected. Only about three names may have been Persian/Babylonian, and one name of possibly Muslim origin, the latter confirming the very minor direct influence that the relatively late-occurring Islam had on European grimoires.1176 Full extraction of the names in the PGM would have boosted the Greek numbers.1177 This table has been extended to include names found in the Goetia, Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis. A subset of this table has been included in Appendix 5 as confirmation of the extensive commonality of these nomina magica. The outcome is that the PGM borrowed as much as half of its god and angel names from Hebraic sources, with less coming from the Greek tradition. From Egypt came some less easily identified Demotic words plus a few of the major gods of Egypt. These proportions varied over time. In the 13th century grimoire Juratus,1178 of the 100 god names analysed, only 17 were of definite Hebraic provenance, and 49 were of definite Greek origin,1179 thus neatly reversing the percentages achieved by Porreca. In the Hygromanteia, and later grimoires, the mix of Hebraic and Greek languages between them constitutes most of the nomina magica. The sheer persistence of these names adds considerable weight to the continuous transmission of magic across a number of cultures   1172 Skinner (2006), Table M. 1173 Porreca (2010), pp. 23-25. 1174 21-22 out of 43 names. Porreca (2010), p. 25. 1175 With seven to nine names identified by Porreca as Greco-Roman, which are in all likelihood just Greek. 1176 Some later names such as Maymon may have Arabic roots. 1177 A full index to the names in PGM is still a major desideratum. I have however, in Appendix 2, listed most of the main god, angel and daimon names to be found in each PGM rite, with a selection of the most frequently occurring nomina magica. 1178 Skinner (2006), Table M7. 1179 The remaining 34 names were of doubtful origin, but most likely either Greek or Hebrew."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 283 with very little change beyond scribal and transliteration errors. The seven angels corresponding to the seven planets and Jewish god names, like IHVH Sabaoth of Hebraic origin, are perhaps the most widespread names, supplemented by Greek words like Primeumaton which easily survive into 17th century and later grimoires. Knowledge of both these languages became much more widespread after the Renaissance, and this would have meant that the origins of many of these names would still have been understood. By Porreca’s count there are 28 names which appear both in the Munich Handbook,1180 and in the PGM, but only 15 names that are shared between the Picatrix and the PGM. In fact only five names are shared exclusively by the Picatrix and the PGM. This confirms the fact that the names of the PGM feed into the Solomonic ritual stream much more strongly than into the astral magic of the Picatrix. As Porreca opines:1181 ...with the study of a broader range of magical collections, a clearer picture will emerge of the threads of cultural continuity that link the magical practice of three cultures1182 that were otherwise so different in terms of their public religious affiliations. This highlights the fact that, to a large extent, transmission of the nomina magica was independent of the religious milieu in which the magician found himself. Greek and Hebraic names (which would have been basically still understood by most educated Christians from the Renaissance to about the mid-20th century) survive, whilst Egyptian names, for the most part did not. It is extraordinary that very common Egyptian nomina (like Pakerbeth) were lost from the corpus at an early stage, despite Egypt’s popular image as the fount of all magic. The establishment of such lines of transmission militates against the popular conception that such names as are used in magic were on the whole gibberish or simply made up. Another study which analyses the frequency of divine names across nine different European Solomonic grimoires was undertaken by Julien Véronèse.1183 In this all sources are European, and all confined to the 13th-14th centuries, so we do not learn much about the transmission of names from culture to culture, but we do get a very clear picture that of all the Solomonic   1180 Kieckhefer (1997). This manuscript should be more correctly referred to by its incipit: Liber Incantationum, exorcismorum et fascinatiorum variorum... 1181 Porreca (2010), p. 29. 1182 Egyptian, Hebraic and Greek. 1183 Véronèse (2010), pp. 30-50."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 texts analysed, the Clavicula Salomonis itself has the widest range of divine names,1184 confirming that it is the most representative grimoire of the Solomonic tradition. 5.5.4 Historiola and Commemoration The procedure of reciting an abridged version of the myths associated with the god being invoked or commemorating their deeds is a well-established practice in both religion and magic. But claiming to be that god is only an often repeated technique of the latter. In the same vein, claiming to be a famous magician, like Nectanebus, Solomon or Jesus, was designed to impress the spiritual creature that was being invoked, so repeating historiola associated with either the god or the famous magician whose name was being invoked was a perennial technique. This was particularly true of Solomon’s name. The procedure of reciting an abridged version of the myths associated with the god being invoked dates from ancient Egypt and is also an enduring tradition. The thinking behind it is either to remind the magician of the story or demonstrate to the god knowledge of its background, thereby making it more compliant to the commands of the magician. Just as the god had triumphed in some previous contest, so now he was expected to aid the magician and triumph again.1185 Mentioning the names of previous famous magicians is designed to encourage the god/spirit to assume that the present magician has inherited their abilities, and therefore ought to be obeyed.1186 In this context, it is worth mentioning that in a number of spells the name of ‘Jesus’ is recalled (as he had a considerable reputation as an exorcist and commander of demons). In one episode a magician uses his name as a spirit-cowering credential as well as that of Paul, one of his disciples, who had also developed magical abilities. The spirit states categorically that it recognised the power of the name ‘Jesus’ and comprehended that of ‘Paul,’ but refused to cooperate with the exorcist, as it did not recognise his power: God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them. Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had [been possessed by] evil spirits, saying, ‘I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.’ Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. But the evil spirit said to then in reply, ‘Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you? Then the man with the evil spirit leapt on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.1187   1184 The only names missing from the specific copy of the Key analysed by Véronèse are Abba, Alla, Semiforas, and Usyon out of 39 possible divine names. 1185 Brashear (1995), p. 3395. 1186 Preisendanz in his Überlieferungsgeschichte 230.29, lists 30 such names of magicians including Pitys (or Bitys), Astrampsychos, Ostanes, and Zoroaster, all of which are found fulfilling this function in PGM. 1187 Acts 19: 11-16. New Revised Standard Version."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 At this point it appears that even the spirit, as well as the sons of the Jewish high priest, acknowledged Jesus’ reputation and abilities as a magician, despite being less than competent themselves. Justin Martyr makes it clear that some names work, and some names (predominantly human names such as St. Paul) do not: But though you exorcise any demon in the name of any of those who were amongst you -- either kings, or righteous men, or prophets, or patriarchs -- it will not be subject to you. But if any of you exorcise it in [the name of] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, it will perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly your exorcists, I have said, make use of craft when they exorcise, even as the Gentiles do, and employ fumigations and incantations.1188 This method also occurs in the Hygromanteia where the magician, usually citing Biblical figures, adjures the spirit: By commandment of the living God, by the purity of John the Baptist...1189 I conjure you by the faith of Abraham the Patriarch, by the service of Melchizedek the Just and by the order of Aaron.1190 Typical passages where the magician commemorates the actions of previous magicians in the Clavicula Salomonis, and embeds them in a historiola, include references to the skills of Joseph and Moses: I conjure ye by the most potent Name of EL ADONAI TZABAOTH, which is the God of Armies, ruling in the Heavens, which Joseph invoked, and was found worthy to escape from the hands of his Brethren. ...which Moses invoked, and he was found worthy to deliver the People [of] Israel from Egypt, and from the servitude of Pharaoh. ...which Moses invoked, and having struck the Sea, it divided into two parts in the midst, on the right hand and on the left. ...which Moses invoked and all the waters returned to their prior state and enveloped the Egyptians, so that not one of them escaped to carry the news into the Land of Mizraim.1191 Such commemoration of the actions of great magicians of the past continues to be part of grimoire magic to the present day. 5.5.5 License to Depart The licence to depart is a key part of any magical rite, and one of the five stages of any Solomonic rite.1192 The point of it is to dismiss the spirits that have been evoked, and to ensure that they do not harm the magician and his disciples when they leave the circle. There are many tales of what happens if the magician (or his disciples) steps over the boundary of the circle or leave before the spirits have retired to their own abode. A classical example of this is related in the Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini in which he participates in a   1188 Justin Martyr 85.3. 1189 B2, f. 344v. 1190 H, f. 29. 1191 Mathers (1909), pp. 26-27.

The result is that a number of the spirits accompany Cellini and his terrified skryer on their way home.1194 There are other techniques for banishing demons, some of them more concrete, for example those mentioned in the Testament of Solomon and The Book of Tobit, but procedures like the burning of catfish entrails are presumably used only in dire emergencies.1195 One common denominator in all the dismissals is a bad smell, be it asafoetida, ape’s dung or the burning fish entrails,1196 accompanied with appropriate words. It makes a sort of sense that the gods and spirits rejoice in the burning of sweet smelling incense, and are by these encouraged to come, but cannot abide a bad stench.1197 Such dismissals are present from dynastic Egyptian, through the PGM, the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis to the later European grimoires. Appearing amongst the PDM, the following method is obviously of ancient Egyptian provenance: If you wish to send them all away:1198 You should put ape’s dung on the brazier. They all [will] go away to their place. And you should recite the spell for dismissing then also...”Go well, go in joy!”1199 Another Egyptian dismissal is expressed simply as a farewell: His dismissal: Formula: “Farewell, farewell, the good oxherd, Anubis, Anubis, the son of a wolf and a dog, ...” Say [it] seven times.1200 The provision to say it seven times indicates the importance attached by the Egyptians to the dismissal. The word commonly used in these texts for a dismissal of a god or a spirit when its services are no longer required was \u001b\u001e\t\u0010#\u0017. Bell, Nock and Thompson suggest that: Possibly \u001b\u001e\t\u0010#\u0017 here implies that the power addressed is fettered by the magician and released for a particular task as it were on ticket of leave...1201   1193 It is possible that the Colosseum was chosen as a site to evoke spirits because of the large amount of blood known to have been spilled there.

It means “to set free or release from the bonds” that were imposed on the spirit by the previous part of the ceremony (the ligatio). The Licentia follows on immediately after the Ligatio. Dismissing a god is more complex, and in the case of Kronos, the following formula is to be recited: ANAE OCHETA THALAMNIA KĒRIDU KOIRAPSIA GENECHRONA SANĒLON STGARDĒS CHLEIDŌ PHRAINOLE PAIDOLIS IAEL, go away, master of the world, forefather [of the gods]; go to your own places in order that the universe be maintained. Be gracious to us, lord.”1202 A more polite form is: Dismissal: “I give thanks to you because you came in accordance with the command of god. I request that you keep me healthy, free from terror and free from demonic attacks, ATHATHE ATHATHACHTHE ADONAI. Return to your holy places.”1203 This is almost exactly the wording of one 17th century European grimoire dismissal (see below). Another dismissal at the end of a lamp skrying ceremony, begins by changing the hand in which the wand is held by the magician, and concludes with the usual request not to harm the magician or his assistant(s): And after the enquiry, if you wish to release the god himself, shift the aforementioned ebony staff [wand], which you are holding in your left hand, to your right hand; and shift the sprig of laurel, which you are holding in your right hand, to your left hand; and extinguish the burning lamp; and use the same burnt offering while saying: Be gracious unto me, O primal god, O elder-born, self-generating god. I adjure the fire which first shone in the void; I adjure your power which is greatest over all; I adjure him who destroys even in Hades, That you depart, returning to your ship,1204 And harm me not, but be forever kind.1205 A dismissal of Sarapis at the end of one skrying operation also includes the boy skryer: Go, lord, to your own world and to your own thrones, to your own vaults, and keep me and this boy from harm, in the name of the highest god, SAMAS PHRĒTH.1206 After the successful invocation of the daimon the Headless One, the magician is instructed to release this daimon and dismiss him in an honourable fashion: After you have learned all you want, you will release him, doing honor to him in a worthy manner. Sprinkle dove’s blood round about, make a burnt offering of myrrh, and say, “Depart, lord, CHORMOU CHORMOU OZOAMOROIRŌCH KIMNOIE EPOZOI EPOIMAZOU SARBOENDOBAIACHCHA IZOMNEI PROSPOI EPIOR; go off, lord, to your seats, to your place, leaving me strength and the right of audience with you.”   1202 PGM IV. 3120-3124. 1203 PGM LXII. 36-41. 1204 The ship that ferries Ra (Phre) across the sky and through the Underworld. 1205 PGM I. 334-347.

One rite which was erroneously described as a “charm,”1207 is in fact Solomon’s invocation to be said into a skryer’s ear in order to put him into a trance. It ends with a classic dismissal: Dismissal of the lord: into the ear of NN [the skryer]: “ANANAK ARBEOUĒRI AEĒIOYŌ.” If he tarries, sacrifice on grapevine charcoal a sesame seed [and] black cumin while saying: “ANANAK ŌRBEOUSIRI AEĒIOYŌ, go away, lord, to your own thrones and protect him, NN [the skryer], from all evil.”1208 A simpler dismissal simply orders: Dismissal. Say: “Go away, Anubis, to your own thrones, for my health and well-being.”1209 The Graeco-Egyptian magicians saw their gods as very palpable,1210 and so the Licence to Depart is also done in a very physical manner: Dismissal: close your eyes, release the pebble which you have been holding,1211 lift the crown up from your head and your heel from his [the god’s] toe, and, while keeping your eyes closed, say 3 times: “I give thanks to you lord BAINCHŌŌŌCH, who is BALSAMĒS. Go away, go away, lord, into your own heavens, into your own palaces, into your own course. Keep me healthy, unharmed, not plagued by ghosts, free from calamity and without terror. Hear me during my lifetime.1212 Dismissal of the brightness:1213 “CHŌŌ CHŌŌ ŌCHŌŌCH,1214 holy brightness.” In order that the brightness [of the god’s appearance] also go away: “Go away, holy brightness, go away, beautiful and holy light of the highest god, AIAŌNA.” Say it one time with closed eyes, smear yourself with Coptic kohl;1215 smear yourself by means of a golden probe.1216 In this instance, the magician is instructed very specifically to restrain the god by standing on his foot, only releasing him by raising his own foot: Charm to retain the god [Holding fast to the god]:1217 when he [the god]1218 comes in, after greeting him, step with your left heel on the big toe of his right foot, and he will not go away unless you raise your heel from his toe and at the same time say the dismissal.1219   1207 The Greek :\t\u0010\t\u00040\u0013\u000b\t\u0007 \u0005\u0002\u000b!\u001e\u000b\u0017\u0014ι\u0007, and the German Salomon's Niederfallen both indicate “Solomon’s fall” rather than “charm.” The precise meaning is “Solomon’s [invocation] that [induces the skryer] to fall.” This interpretation is confirmed by lines 910-911. Suddenly falling into trance literally floors the skryer. 1208 PGM IV. 917-921. 1209 PGM VII. 319-334. 1210 Although I have already instanced this passage as an example of the palpability of Egyptian gods, it is here used also as an example of the Licence to Depart. 1211 Inscribed with ‘3663,’ Bainchōōch’s isopsephic number, derived by adding together the numeric equivalents of the letters in his name. 1212 And by implication, to come when I call. 1213 ‘Brightness’ should be understood as the ray of light from the sun god, rather than just light. 1214 Corresponds to “depart, depart, O darkness,” in other words ‘Bainchōōch depart.’ 1215 Powdered antimony or stibnite. 1216 PGM IV. 1057-1070. 1217 This is not a (physical) charm.

For example H just concludes the operation without any mention of it. B however gives a detailed ‘reverse evocation.’ A secondary benefit of the Licence to Depart, apart from the safety of the magician and his disciples, is to impress upon the spirits their obligation to come again when called. A number of conjurations in the Hygromanteia finish with a long or short ‘Licence to Depart,’ which is sometimes added to the giving of thanks to the spirits, the idea being not just to maintain cordial relations, but to make it easier to call them again next time. Version B ends its evocatory section with: And after they will do what you want, give thanks to them, and say: “In the names you heard, do not harm me or my apprentice, but go in peace.” And recite this conjuration or dismissal “I order you and I conjure you by the Cherubim, by the Seraphim and by the nine orders of the holy angels; by Barakhiēl, Pimēlaēl, Iekaēl, Iastaēl, Ourieil; by the Archangels, Angels, Powers, Principalities, full of eyes, and Dominions; the archangel Lakhhibiēl, by the archangel Azakiēl and in the terrible names you have heard, do not cause me any harm when I am either asleep or awake, do not cause any harm to my apprentice, but go in peace. And when I need you again, come eagerly and quickly.”1220 The dismissal of the spirits in both the Hygromanteia and the later grimoires is usually expressed as a ‘licence,’ that is permission, rather than a banishing. Having conjured, threatened, and bound the spirit successfully; it would have seemed rather rude for the magician to summarily banish it. At the end of the proceedings the Licence to Depart is formally read, and, if the previous stages have been successfully completed without error, the spirit(s) should depart swiftly without any difficulty. The License to Depart in the Key of Solomon is traditionally very short and relies upon the assumed eagerness of the spirits to return to their abode: In the Name of ADONAI, the Eternal and Everlasting One, let each of you return unto his place; be there peace between us and you, and be ye ready to come when ye are called... By virtue of these Pentacles, and because ye have been obedient, and have obeyed the commandments of the Creator, feel and inhale this grateful odour, and afterwards depart ye unto your abodes and retreats; be there peace between us and you; be ye every ready to come when ye shall be cited and called; and may the blessing of God, as far as ye are capable of receiving it, be upon you, provided ye be obedient and prompt to come unto us without solemn rites and observances on our part.1221   1220 B, f. 30. 1221 Mathers (1909), pp. 41, 43.

The Commonality and Transmission of Equipment between the PGM, the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis Mention of specific items of magical equipment is dispersed throughout the PGM, mostly at the end of each rite amongst the instructions for making phylacteries, inks, and incenses applicable to the particular operation. However, in the Hygromanteia, the details of manufacturing the necessary equipment are grouped together contiguously in Part III (chapters 14-29). This tradition is also followed in the Clavicula Salomonis, and later grimoires where the manufacture and consecration of garments, wands, daggers, swords and skrying stones is laid out in some considerable detail in the same section. In 1896 a Twelfth Dynasty1222 tomb near the Ramesseum at Thebes, excavated by Quibell, was identified as the tomb of a magician-priest by the nature of the papyri found therein,1223 all of which related to magic or magico-medicine.1224 Buried in the tomb were the usual types of tomb furnishings including two sorts of ushabtis, the magical servants often buried with the dead in Egypt. One sort was made of green faience and the other of unbaked clay painted yellow. There were also figures of the four sons of Horus, Mesti, Duamutef, Hapi and Qebesenef, who usually stood guard over the internal organs of the deceased. However, in this tomb, these were different inasmuch as they were made of wax, not stone or pottery. Wax figures feature in magic from ancient through to modern times, but are unusual in the context of tomb organ guardians. Inside the tomb was a wooden box measuring about 18” x 12” x 12” covered with white plaster slip upon which was painted a black ink image of Anubis (who features in many spells in the PGM, and who might be considered one of the magician’s special gods). The contents of the magician’s box were as follows: 1. Fragments of 23 papyri which included magical spells, magico-medical treatises, and the Discourses of Sisobek. 2. Four broken boomerang-shaped ivory wands on which were carved a series of real and mythical animals. Wands have always been associated with magic, but only Egyptian wands were of this shape. 3. Four deformed female dolls, two made from wood, and one from limestone, two missing their lower legs.1225 These would have been used in the same way that wax or clay dolls have been used by magicians ever since (see chapter 6.12).   1222 Roughly 2000-1800 BCE. 1223 Most of the magical papyri of the PGM also came from tombs in the Thebes area. 1224 Quibell (1898). 1225 All probably used as fith-faths, or magical dolls."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 291 4.

One version of the Clavicula Salomonis, dating from 1796, makes the following provision for such a box, with almost exactly the same dimensions, as if nothing had changed in almost four thousand years: It is very important to have a small casket of olive or hazel wood, a foot and a half1229 in length and the height and width proportional to the length. You can use another wood, if you like, with no reservations, provided that it is new, lined with a piece of new white cloth and fitted with a little lock. You should fill it with the following items in the sequence given. An alb or long robe made of new white linen. A cap, stockings and underwear made of the same material. Light leather shoes and white gloves. All of these minor pieces of equipment are used only in the important Operations. You should also have a writing case in the shape of a small square box, which has been supplied with a few crow’s feathers suitable for writing. You should also have a white handled knife, a bradawl of finely tempered steel, sharp and in the shape of a chisel, a pair of good bird’s [feathers]; a white ceramic inkwell filled with ink and with a new collar. Another small box to hold your smaller paraphernalia; a clean flint lighter to light the fire with, along with a candle made of virgin white wax. You will also have in the same casket a phial made of strong glass, filled with purified water, that is to say, water prepared with the ceremonies used for water blessed on the eve of Easter. In addition, you should have three knives in the casket, one of which should be sharp and with a white handle, another whose point should be in the shape of ancient cutlasses, with a black handle, and one whose point should be in the shape of a sickle, also with a black handle.   1226 A tree that grew in Nubia and Egypt in ancient times. 1227 For details of seed use in Ifa divination see Skinner (1980, expanded in 2011), chapter 3.

You should also have some small packets of incense appropriate for each of the seven Planets in your casket, to be used at the appropriate time and place. In addition, you should have a thurible made of earth or of some other material with new charcoal to make a fire with during your important Operations, to be used for censing and suffumigations.

Cover the tripod with clean linen, and place a censer on the tripod. It is advantageous to place on the table a [hollow figurine] of Apollo [made] out of laurel wood.

These tables of laurel or olive wood are often inscribed with specific characters, foreshadowing the elaborate table in SSM and Dee’s 16th century ‘Table of Practice.’ The small table upon which offerings were made to the gods, the \u000b\u0003!\u001e\f9 ̓ or \u000b\u0003\u0002\u001e+9ι\u0002, trapezia is sometimes mentioned alongside the iynx in the context of Classical Greek magic, and it may have been one ancestor of the Table of Evocation.   1230 For marking out circles when drawing talismans. 1231 Aspergillum. 1232 Wellcome MS 4670, p. 17-18.

The Table was also equipped for planetary evocation,1240 and on a number of occasions spirits arrived in response to invocations rather than angels.

In the Book of Exodus, Pharaoh’s magicians and the Hebrew leader Aaron are all able to turn their staffs into live snakes but Aaron’s snake is said to have overcome and swallowed the others.1244 When exiting Egypt, Moses used a rod or wand to part the Red Sea. A magician’s wand in the form of an elongated bronze cobra1245 survived in a 16th century BCE tomb in Thebes. This is almost certainly the type of wand used by Aaron and Pharaoh’s magicians. The use of magician’s snake wands therefore has a very long history. The use of a snake as a wand correlates with the use of the snake as an ouroboros to form the protective circle. A different variety of ancient Egyptian ivory wands was shaped like curved throwing sticks. They are often found broken and carefully mended, and may therefore have been actually thrown as part of a rite. Other rods, which may have been used as wands were made of glazed steatite, heavily decorated with attached images of crocodiles, lions, turtles, frogs, etc. The earliest Greek references to the wand probably occur in connection with Hermes who was characterised as the “god with the golden wand.”1246 There are references in the PDM Supplement to the use of an iron staff by Anubis, which may have also been some kind of wand. In later grimoires, iron has always been something that spirits feared, which is part of the rationale behind the magician threatening the spirit with an iron sword. An iron spear was used by Seth against the serpent Apep, and perhaps its rarity contributed to its reputed ability to defeat evil.1247 The PDM passage instructs Anubis to “Give your iron staff which is in your hand to the spirit!”1248 The passage continues with Anubis being instructed to send the spirit to the person the magician is trying to influence: Let him go to NN, whom NN bore. Let him stand before the image of the god who is great in his heart until he brings him to the road which NN is in, he [the spirit] seeking after him [NN]. And may you send a breathing spirit to NN so that he may stand before [him] in the image of the god who is great in his heart.1249   1244 Pinch (2006), p. 78. 1245 Probably representing Weret Hekau, literally ‘Great of Magic’ was a cobra goddess on whose form the wands have been modeled. 1246 Odyssey, X. 27. Circe’s wand, or rhabdos, is also mentioned in Odyssey, X. 20. The same word is applied to Hermes’ wand. Rhabdos was later personified as a demon in the Testament of Solomon. 1247 Iron was rare in ancient Egypt and until the first millennium BCE only imported or meteoric iron was available there. 1248 PDM Supplement 105. 1249 PDM Supplement 101-116."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 298 This is a classic piece of magic, a theme repeated in many guises in later grimoires. Here the magician sends a “breathing spirit,” in other words a living spirit, to enter NN’s dreams and thereby influence his actions. The point of sending the spirit disguised as the god that NN most venerates (“the god who is great in his heart”), is to get NN to believe whatever it is the spirit says to him, which will have been of the magician’s devising. The Graeco-Egyptian wand was more often made of ebony. In one lamp skrying which incorporates an invocation of Apollo, the magician is instructed to: Hold an ebony staff in your left hand...1250 There seems to have been a considerable significance attached to the hand in which the wand was held. In another invocation designed to obtain answers and revelations either during the epiphany or afterwards in lucid dreams, the ebony wand was held in the left hand whilst the right hand held a sprig of laurel (sacred to Apollo).1251 Other things were used by the Greeks for wands, for example, in a Classical invocation of Apollo, the wand to be held in the right hand was the seven-leafed sprig of laurel.1252 This was used to summon both heavenly and chthonic deities. The seven characters to be written on the wand were the “seven characters for deliverance.” This rite highly praises the qualities of this wand which also acts as a phylactery in this case: For this is the body’s greatest protective charm [phylactery],1253 by which all [daimones] are made subject, and seas and rocks tremble, and daimons [avoid] the characters’ magical powers which you are about to have. For it is the greatest protective charm [phylactery] for the rite, so that you fear nothing.1254 A magician’s wand is seldom mentioned in the PGM, far less illustrated. An exception occurs in an illustration which shows a drawing of a man with a loin cloth (but described as naked in the rite) holding a knife or sword. The figure also wears a crown and in his left hand he carries a wand. The interesting thing about this wand is that it resembles a plant, possibly a laurel or bulrush stem with a single leaf. The wand does not appear to feature in the Hygromanteia. The wand itself, whilst still being a strong element in popular magical culture (think Disney), became even less important in the later grimoires.   1250 PGM I. 279. 1251 PGM I. 334-341. 1252 PGM I. 262.

You should fast for three days before going to the place, where you will cut it and write or engrave these [corrupted] Hebrew letters on both ends...and when you are not using it you will wrap it in a cloth of silk or new black wool.

Figure 50: 20th century Golden Dawn wands showing Egyptian motifs.1258 These have commonality with Egyptian motifs (winged disk with serpents and jackal head), Jewish tradition (hexagram) and lotus wand.

The oldest reference to using a sword to exorcise or threaten spirits comes from a Babylonian tablet which reads: 5. When I perform [the Incantation]1259 of Eridu, When I perform the Incantation... May a kindly Guardian stand at my side. 10. By Ningirsu, master of the sword, mayest thou be exorcised! Evil Spirit, evil Demon, evil ghost, mayest thou be exorcised.1260 Theophrastus wrote in Enquiry into Plants1261 in the 4th century BCE that before picking a mandrake it was usual to draw three circles around it with an iron sword. It is not clear at what point the practice of using an iron sword to draw three circles round the magician before evoking was introduced. This does not necessarily seem to have been practised in Egypt, although absence of such a description does not necessarily mean absence of the practice. The theory behind this is that spirits do not like iron, and an iron sword brandished in their direction is something to be feared, as it can reputedly damage them.1262 Many more Latin grimoires mention a sword than those that mention a wand. There are no explicit mentions of the use of a sword to constrain the spirits in the PGM, although one rite to secure love is entitled the ‘Sword of Dardanos.’ Dardanos was the founder of the Mysteries of Samothrace, and so may have been accounted a magician. The ‘sword’ is later revealed to be a list of angel names to invoke, rather than a physical sword: Monas1263 THOURIVL MICHAVL GABRIVL OURIVL MISAVL IRRAVL ISTRAVL.1264 The usage therefore echoes that of the Jewish grimoire, the Sword of Moses, where the sword is also a list of angel and god names. Speculatively, this list of names may have been those originally engraved on an actual physical sword. If so then it seems more likely that the use of a physical sword sprang from a different tradition, perhaps as old as Mesopotamia, that valued sharp iron as a direct threat to the spirits. In several manuscripts of the Hygromanteia, it is recommended that the all important black-handled knife is to be made from an old sword, preferably one that has “brought death,” but   1259 Thompson’s interpolation. 1260 Thompson (1903), p. 3, Third tablet. 1261 Hort (1916). 1262 Early Byzantine amulets (circa 5th century) featuring Solomon as the master of demons, or the rider-saint, were often made of haematite, a form of iron oxide, and therefore inimical to spirits. One of the three ‘helpers’ who rout demons in an early Aramaic formula is called sideros (Greek for ‘iron’). See Spier (1993), pp. 35-36. 1263 O’Neil in Betz translates this as ‘One,’ when it obviously has the technical meaning of the Unity as the prime mover of creation rather than a simple ordinal number. 1264 PGM IV. 1815."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 301 apart from that requirement, a sword is not part of the equipment mentioned by the Hygromanteia. In the Latin grimoires, the iron sword was considered such an important item of magical equipment that some grimoires went to the lengths of suggesting that the magician forged his own sword.1265 The procedure was: Thou shalt therefore take a new Sword which thou shalt clean and polish on the day of Mercury, and at the first or fifteenth hour [of Mercury], and after this thou shalt write on one side these Divine Names in Hebrew...sprinkle and cense it and repeat over it the following conjuration...1266 Figure 51: The magician’s Magical Sword of Art in the Key of Solomon.1267 The subsidiary Figs. shown in this illustration are the Hebrew inscriptions to be engraved on the swords of the magician’s assistants. A French manuscript gives slightly different instructions: We also make use of Swords in the Magical Arts. It is good to have one of them, which you will polish on the Day and hour of Jupiter. Then you will engrave on the blade these Divine Names on one side: Jehoha (sic), Adonay, Eheye and on the other side, Elohim Gibor and then you will have attached a hilt made of ivory, which you will perfume, saying: “I conjure you, Sword, by these Names of Imabrok, Abrac, Abracad[ab]ra, so that you will give me strength in all of my Workings, to stand firm against all my enemies, visible and invisible.” This being said, you will place it in a silk cloth with the other instruments to be used when the occasion needs it.1268 See Figure 53 which shows the range of swords prescribed by this grimoire. Another version suggests that: You should have a knife [sword] made of steel, three foot long and whose handle is made of crystal, marked with the symbols as shown below,1269 written in the light of the Full Moon and with human blood. You should hold it in your left hand and when you have entered into the Circle, awaiting the arrival of the Spirits.1270 When it is desired to coerce the spirits the magician is to say:   1265 For example in Lansdowne MS 1203. 1266 Mathers (1909), p. 97. 1267 Mathers (1909), Plates XIII & XIV. 1268 Wellcome MS 4669, Art. 1, pp. 62-63, as translated in Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 345. 1269 A different set of corrupt characteres. 1270 Wellcome MS 4669, Art. 2, p. 97, as translated in Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 389."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 302 Behold your confusion, behold my Sword, be rebellious no more, but be obedient.1271 In this particular version the sword is also used to sacrifice the kid goat in order to make the virgin parchment.

Although this was usually drawn in chalk or painted on the ground, a number of authorities state that its retracement by the consecrated knife or sword was what made it most effective in keeping the spirits out of the circle. The knife is also used in a number of the manteia chapters (47-58) of the Hygromanteia where it is used to ‘pin down’ the spirit by, for example, driving the knife into the earth or into the Table of Evocation, and only withdrawing it when it was desired to release the spirit. In this context its roots can also   1273 Trachtenberg (2004), p. 308. 1274 Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki. 1275 Sanhedrin 67b. 1276 Daiches (1913), p. 30. 1277 Daiches MSS 54, f. 18, 22. 1278 Trachtenberg (2004) mentions that references to this method of divination are to be found in: Ḥochmat Ha-Nefesh, 16d, 18a, 20c, 28d, 29a; Ẓiyuni, 10c; Redak on Ezekiel 21:26; Nishmat Ḥayim, III, 19. 1279 Codex Gaster 315, translated in Daiches (1913), p. 15. 1280 Of course absence of mention does not guarantee absence of this piece of equipment, which may have been present in the PGM tradition, but so taken for granted that is was not specifically mentioned. 1281 Attested in H, A, B, P, G and no less than three times in B3. 1282 The manufacture of parchment from the skin of slain animals was a regular and unremarkable occurrence, till the adoption of paper as a writing material."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" 304 be seen in traditional Greek folk magic, which can therefore be seen as a possible alternative contributory source to the Hygromanteia. The blade of the knife was traditionally forged by the magician, but may instead have been made by a blacksmith, and forged from an older knife or sword that preferably had killed a man (“iron that has brought death”),1283 although this latter requirement may just have been a romantic embellishment. The hilt was to be made from a black he-goat’s horn.1284 Most versions also specify that magical names have to be engraved (or less satisfactorily, etched) on the blade.1285 Certain symbols were later introduced after the text was translated into Latin, and it is these symbols rather than the Greek nomina magica which have survived in the Latin manuscripts. The black-handled magicians’ knife, once consecrated can be used for drawing the protective circle, ‘pining down’ a spirit or its seal, as a support (stuck in the ground in the middle of the circle) for the katoptromanteia mirror. Its function of pinning down a ghost is well demonstrated in the Hygromanteia chapter on the conjuration of Mortzē as we have seen: Do this [drawing of the circle] three times with the knife, around the table. And when you finish the three circles, thrust the knife into the table and recite the following: “I nail you here, Mortzē, or haunting of this place.” And he will come to you at once. Then, ask whatever you want, and he will answer all your questions. And if you want to banish him, draw the knife out of the table, and he will go away from you.1286 As the knife (as well as the sword) is a weapon of iron, and therefore a correspondence of Mars, so the forging and engraving should be done on the day and the hour of Mars. Purity is enjoined upon both the operator and upon the subsequent use of the knife: Do not cut anything with it, and let it be [kept] without a scabbard. Store it in a clean place. It is also necessary that the artisan remains pure until he finishes its construction. Use it only for its power and for nothing else.1287 The “Knife with the Black Hilt” and the “Knife with the White Hilt” are described and illustrated in Mathers’ edition of the Key of Solomon:1288 The Knife with the white hilt...should be made in the day and hour of Mercury, when Mars is in the Sign of the Ram or of the Scorpion. It should be dipped in the blood of a gosling and in the juice of the pimpernel, the Moon being at her full or increasing in light. Dip therein also the white hilt, upon the which thou shalt have engraved the Characters shown. Afterwards perfume it with the perfumes of the Art.   1283 H, f. 24v; A, f. 14v. 1284 The use of an animal horn (specifically a goat’s horn) to make the hilt appears to have been lost when the technique passed over into the Latin grimoires, where only the colour black was prescribed. P specifies a black she-goat’s horn. 1285 See A, B, G and B3. A specifies “Rhakhōr Rhadiamoēna Arōnē.” G specifies “Rhakhōr Rhadia Konil Arōni Aphines,” which is a banishment of impurities. 1286 B2, f. 346. 1287 H, ff. 24v-25. 1288 Mathers (1909), Book II, Chapter VIII; Figures 61 and 62.

It is obvious that the black-handled knife in the Clavicula Salomonis needed to make the circle and “to strike terror and fear into the Spirits” had the same function as, and almost certainly evolved from, the black goat’s horn handled knife of the Hygromanteia. Other Magical Instruments From the basic pieces of equipment, the sword, black-handled dagger and wand, the later French texts of the Clavicula Salomonis generated a number of even more specialised items. The wand morphed into the Baguette and the Bâton. The black-handled knife or couteau noir remained an important instrument, but a couteau blanc was also added to the array of implements. The sickle or faucille was included for cutting herbs. The sword evolved into the lance, coutelas, épée and poignard. These can all be clearly seen in Figure 53. In the Mathers edition of the Clavicula Salomonis (Figure 54) the range of magical instruments became even more systematised.1290 Figure 53: The extended Instruments of Art in a French Clavicula Salomonis.1291   1289 Mathers (1909), p. 96. 1290 The sword appears above in Figure 51. 1291 Wellcome MS 4669 (dated 1796) as translated in Skinner and Rankine (2008), p. 345."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" 306 Figure 54: The other iron Instruments of Art by Mathers with their inscriptions.1292 6.5 Virgin Papyrus or Parchment Because the written word is such an important part of magic, so the surface it is written on must also be pure and consecrated. Obviously papyrus was the writing surface par excellence in dynastic Egypt. Papyrus came in different grades of quality, and hieratic papyrus,1293 the best quality, was recommended in the PGM for the written works of magic. There is a small practical difference between ‘virgin parchment’ and ‘unborn parchment.’ The first must be made from an animal that has just been born, but not yet suckled.1294 The second from the foetus of an animal still in the uterus. In both cases the knife of art must be used to slaughter the animal, and remove its skin.1295 The rest of the steps are standard parchment preparation processes involving running water, fat and hair removal with quicklime and a wooden blade, followed by stretching on a board and drying in the sun. The only magical addition to this standard medieval procedure is the specification of prayers to be said during the process. The ‘unborn parchment’ is to be used for the lamen, which being the instrument that protects   1292 Mathers (1909), Plates XIII, XIV, edited to just show the Instruments (Pentacle and Circle removed). 1293 \u0015!\u0003\u000b\u0007 W\f\u0003\u0002\u000bι\u0005\r\u0013. 1294 Manuscript H and P specify ‘not yet suckled,’ whilst A and B specify ‘sucking.’ 1295 In the case of the foetus, a softer knife made of reed is used for skinning."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" 307 the magician from any maliciousness of the spirits, must be of the utmost purity.1296 The preparation of the virgin parchment in the Clavicula Salomonis follows the same sequence of procedures as that outlined in the Hygromanteia. An interesting addition is the suggestion that this preparation should be done at midsummer on the eve of St John the Baptist’s day.1297 The Key of Solomon makes the same distinction between ‘virgin parchment’ and ‘unborn parchment,’ the later being made from foetal skin, and perceived as superior. The parchment is to be prepared in the day and hour of Mercury. One interesting alternative, which does not seem to appear in any of the other literature is the possibility of making the virgin parchment from the cauls of newly-born children.1298 The suitability of the material to the specific operation is stressed by a number of texts. Antonio da Montolmo makes this point: And when the characters are suffumigated and inscribed with a suitable ink on a suitable paper, and with a benevolent prayer addressed to them, the <spirits> take it as an honor and they try hard to carry out what is written in the phylactery.1299 And, by contrast, if someone inscribes the characters of a spirit on an unsuitable paper, with an unsuitable ink, and with an unsuitable suffumigation, but with incense constraint, the exorcist inflicts pain and shame on the spirits. 1300 6.6 Pen, Quill, or Reed Reed pens were used for writing on papyrus not only in a dynastic Egypt, but also in a Graeco-Egyptian context and later in a Muslim context. For magical use the papyrus would usually be consecrated and perfumed before being used. The use of a reed pen is useful in dating the text as it suggests that papyrus rather than parchment or paper was the writing material of choice. Chapter 20 of the Hygromanteia explains the manufacture of the reed pen.1301 Quill pens only came into use later, with the replacement of papyrus with parchment. Hence, the chapter on the creation of a reed pen would have existed before that on quill pen production.1302 The mention of reed pens in the Hygromanteia therefore confirms a composition date in or before the 7th century. For magical use, just like the hazel wand, the reed pen must be cut with a single stroke. The   1296 This chapter appears in H, P, A, P4, B and twice in B3.

By the time the method had crossed over into Latin Europe and the Clavicula Salomonis, where parchment was the norm, reed pens were no longer mentioned. Chapter 21 of the Hygromanteia, on the quill of the art, occurs in four different versions. The drafting of these sections may coincide with a period when both instruments were in use in Constantinople. The 7th century marked this period of transition from the ancient Egyptian reed pen to the quill pen, just as papyrus was giving way to parchment.1303 Although this is just circumstantial evidence, it agrees with my tentative dating of the Apotelesmatikē Pragmateia (the ancestor of the Hygromanteia) being taken from Alexandria to Constantinople in the early 7th century, when both quills and reed pens would have still been in use. Because reeds ceased to be used as writing instruments in Byzantium, this section in the Key of Solomon is concerned only with bird quills, especially crows or swallows, which must have been a commonly available item. During the quill’s preparation and sharpening a suitable incantation and two Psalms were to be said.1304 Some of the older, or more conservative grimoires, such as the Raziel, which was known in the 16th century in both Latin and English versions,1305 still retained mention of the reed pen suggesting a textual origin for the Raziel in or before the 7th century, or an extreme degree of conservativeness on the part of the scribes: And the penne that thou shalt write the holy names be it of a greene reede gathered early ere the sunne arise.1306 And he that shall gather it be he clene & washen & in running water or in a quicke well and also let him be clothed with cleane clothes, and the moone being waxing with Caput Draconis or with Jove, for that they be true and very.

And thou take the reede with thy cleane hands, and make thou of it a gobbets. And when thou wilt cutt the penne, cutt it ere the sunne arise or when it ariseth. With this penne and with this ynke thou shalt write all the names of God holy and severall.1307 This is an exception, and most Latin grimoires moved directly to the use of the quill without   1303 This dating is often derived from the observation that after Byzantium’s loss of Egypt to Islam in 641, reeds were much more difficult to obtain. 1304 Mathers (1909), p. 109. 1305 Sloane MS 3826 (English) and Sloane MS 3846 (Latin). 1306 An indistinct marginal note here concerns the effect of Caput Draconis. 1307 Sloane MS 3826, f. 4v."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" 309 even considering the reed pen.

After this thou shalt sharpen it with the penknife of the Art, perfume it, sprinkle it, and place it aside in a silken cloth.1308 There are further and different instructions given for making a quill from a swallow or a crow’s feather. Another manuscript recommends taking the longest feather from the left wing of a swallow before trimming it, sprinkling it and perfuming it in a similar manner. 6.7 Ink Smell was very important to the ancient Egyptians, so much so that they are depicted in wall paintings as wearing cones of fragrant material melting on top of their heads, to ensure they smelled attractive throughout the day. Smell was an important issue in magic, with sweet incenses being used to attract spirits and sour ones like asafoetida used to drive them away. It is therefore not surprising that the other medium of communication with spirits, the written word, talisman, pentacle, lamen etc, had to be written with sweet smelling inks. The most common recommendation found in the papyri is to use ‘myrrh ink’ so that the gods or other spiritual creatures would take sufficient notice of the words so written. The ink is sometimes made of cinnabar:1309 ...write on strips of papyrus made from a priestly scroll, with ink of cinnabar, juice of wormwood, and myrrh.1310 Here the medium is confirmed as papyrus, of the highest quality. This method of using incensed ink on consecrated papyrus or parchment endured for at least another 1500 years. Myrtle leaves are also mentioned as a writing surface, and single stemmed wormwood is often specified as an additive to the myrrh ink.1311 To give the ink its necessary staining quality soot was often added. Apart from myrrh, soot and herbal matter, the other key ingredient in inks used in magic was blood. Sometimes just blood alone would be used as a writing material. In King Pitys’ first necromantic spell, the writing is to be done with ink made from serpent’s blood mixed with the soot from a   1308 Mathers (1909), p. 108. 1309 Mercuric sulphide. It is vermillion and used for the rubrification of text. As a compound of mercury, cinnabar is particularly appropriately as an ink, an instrument of communication. This material that was also used in China for the same purpose, the creation of very important scrolls, and for magic talismans 1310 PGM IV. 2394. 1311 PGM IV. 2233-9."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 310 goldsmith’s workshop.1312 Soot was a standard ingredient of black inks since antiquity right up to the 19th century, for everyday as well as magical use. The soot from a goldsmith’s workshop would presumably also have some traces of sublimed gold in it, and this echoes the usages of inks containing metals. In King Pitys’ second necromancy spell,1313 the writing is done with black ink on a leaf of flax or on a roll of hieratic papyrus. The ink is made from the blood of an ass1314 mixed with coppersmiths’ soot. The leaf of flax is inscribed with a falcon’s blood, mixed with goldsmiths’ soot. The hieratic papyrus is to be inscribed with eel’s blood mixed with acacia.1315 Another rite adds blood to the usual myrrh ink, but also specifies the spell must be written on leaves of flax.1316 A short necromantic spell for questioning corpses also by King Pitys requires the nomina magica to be written on a flax leaf,1317 with a special ink made from: ...red ochre, burnt myrrh, juice of fresh wormwood, evergreen...1318 One spell for business success requires the words to be written on a male egg,1319 with the following ink: Drawing made with Typhonian ink: A fiery red poppy, juice from an artichoke, seed of the Egyptian acacia, red Typhon’s ochre,1320 unslaked quicklime, wormwood with a single stem, gum, rainwater.1321 The egg is to then be buried “near the threshold where you live” or “in the house [where] I do my business.” Another use of ink consisted of writing a spell with “Hermaic myrrh ink,” then washing the ink off the papyrus in order to drink it and thereby absorb the qualities of the spell. One example of this practice designed to strengthen the memory enjoins the practitioner to make the ink with spring water from seven springs, and drink the resulting ink wash on an empty stomach for seven days. The ingredients of this ink are: Myrrh troglitis, 4 drams;1322 3 karian figs, 7 pits of Nikolaus dates, 7 dried pinecones, 7 piths of the single-stemmed wormwood, 7 wings of the Hermaic ibis,1323 spring water.

In the latter case the solution is drunk as a way of determining the truth, and enforcing a curse as a penalty, if the subject has sworn falsely. Here it is referred to as the ‘water of bitterness’: Then the priest shall put these curses in writing, and wash them off into the water of bitterness. He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter her and cause bitter pain... when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall discharge, her uterus drop, and the woman shall become an excration among her people.1327 The Maskelli formula for revealing answers in a dream, uses a similar ink for writing upon both papyrus and cloth: ...single-stemmed wormwood, vetch, 3 pits of Nicholaus date palms, 3 Karian dried figs, soot from a goldsmith,1328 3 branches of a male date palm, sea foam.1329 For invocations of specific gods, specific inks were used, just as specific incenses were burned. For example, drawing an image of Anubis on a papyrus for magical purposes requires the correct ink, in this case mixed with “the blood of a black dog.”1330 Another ink also using myrrh and wormwood is made as follows: In a purified container burn myrrh and cinquefoil and wormwood; grind them to a paste, and use them [as an ink].1331 Cinquefoil has an enduring place amongst the herbs used in European grimoires.

In each case, the live animal is consecrated and then the blood derived from a suitable vein without killing the animal, using a needle. The blood is then censed and kept for later use.

Strangely the High Priest or sem-priest wore a leopard skin. It is also likely that the sem-priest was amongst the most learned in the temple (and therefore more likely to practise magic). He inhabited the per-ankh or House of Life, a combined library, scriptorium and college, in which priests would perform magic, interpret dreams and make amulets, for clients who paid for them. The skin of any big cat, especially a lion, was held in awe, as it related to the fierce goddess Sekhmet. Sekhmet also had associations with magic.1341 High Priests of Sekhmet were often associated with magic, such as Heryshefnakht, who was both Chief of Magicians and High Priest of Sekhmet. On the reverse of the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus (which dates from 1700 BCE) the title of one spell refers to “the demons of disease, the malignant spirits, messengers of Sekhmet,”1342 which identifies this goddess also as a ruler over evil spirits. If that is so, then wearing a belt made of her animal’s skin conferred a certain authority on the magician. The leopard skin of the Egyptian priest and the lion nemyss1343 is met with within the European grimoire tradition in the form of a belt made of lion skin. This practice lasted through to the 17th century, and a belt of lion skin is recommended in the 1641 Goetia. Even today such belts are sold online to aspiring magicians. I think it is quite clear that this is a continuation of the same ancient Egyptian tradition. I suggest that this practice originally related to Sekhmet, but later it may simply have become part of the dress of the magician designed to cower the spirits.

An ivy wreath likewise gave the magician a semblance of status as a hero or a senator: Crown yourself with dark ivy while the sun is in mid-heaven, at the fifth hour [after sunrise], and while looking upward, lie down naked on the linen, and order your eyes to be completely covered with a black band...1344 The act of claiming to be some famous personage, god or magician (part of the standard armoury of magicians in all ages) was assisted by the wearing of appropriate garments. One description of an evocatory lamp skrying gives details of the prescribed clothing: Whenever you seek [to do ritual] divinations, be dressed in the garb of a prophet, shod with fibres of the doum palm1345 and your head crowned with a spray from an olive tree – but the spray should have a single-shooted garlic tied around the middle. Clasp a pebble numbered 36631346 to your breasts,1347 and in this way make your invocation.1348 It is interesting that Bainchōōch should be chosen, and that garlic should be used. Otherwise it follows the tradition, which recurs again in the Key of Solomon, of dressing up as someone imposing, such as a prophet, or Solomon, in order to awe the spiritual creatures invoked. Chapter 35 of the Hygromanteia outlines the necessary garments, as the magician would certainly not wear his street clothes whilst engaged in a magical operation. Garments were specified in detail right down to gloves, cloak, shoes, stockings, collar, broach to fix the cloak and even underwear. The only item with a specific magical function was the linen cloth designed to cover the lamen till the appropriate point in the ceremony. Each of these items had to be new, white and made of linen or in the case of the gloves, virgin leather. If possible the garments should be woven or at least stitched by a virgin girl. Then, using the previously consecrated pen or reed and scented ink the practitioner must write protective signs and nomina magica on each of the garments plus specific sigils, which differed from garment to garment. Some attempts have been made to date various manuscripts of the Hygromanteia by examining the clothing nomenclature used in these passages.1349 H, which is one of the oldest manuscripts from the 15th century, uses very antique Greek phrases for the garments, suggesting that it was copied from an even older manuscript, probably dating from before   1344 PGM IV. 171-174. 1345 This palm was also listed as one of the items in the Egyptian magician’s box mentioned in chapter 6. 1346 The isopsephic numeration of the letters of Bainchōōch. 1347 As a phylactery. 1348 PGM IV. 930-938. 1349 Marathakis (2011), p. 91."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 315 13th century.

Parallel instructions are to be found in the Clavicula Salomonis, where a great deal of attention is given to the garments, which are to be kept in “a small casket of olive or hazel wood.”1351 A belt of lion skin was recommended in several grimoires, echoing the practice of Egyptian priests. In modern times Mathers, in imitation of the Egyptian magicians, wore a leopard skin when conducting Golden Dawn ‘Rosicrucian’ rituals in Paris in the early 20th century.1352 The use of special clean linen clothing is a persistent theme from the PGM to the modern day, with the writing of nomina magica and symbols on all garments having been prevalent since the time of the Hygromanteia. 6.9 The Symbolas of the Gods1353 Egyptian gods are often portrayed with the symbols of their power (like the Pharaoh). Typical symbolas (\u0014#\u0004\u001d\t\u0010\t\u0007) are the throne of Isis, the feather of Maat, the eye of Horus, the crook and flail of Osiris or the cow horns of Hathor. Greek gods also carry indications of their power, like the playthings of Dionysus (e.g. the iynx or spinning top), the caduceus wand of Hermes or the laurel of Apollo. The use of laurel wreaths in magic as well as in religious usage occurs in the PGM: While praying, wear a garland of laurel of the following description: Take 12 laurel twigs; make a garland of 7 sprigs, and bind the remaining five together and hold them in your right hand while you pray, and lie down to sleep holding this...1354 The purpose of that rite was to secure a dream revelation from the god. The purpose of the laurel wreath was to identify the magician with the god.

The iynx spinning top, which reputedly made a whirring sound, is a much more likely fit. A passage in the PGM lists out some of the symbolas of Kore’s power:1357 ...do this task for me, Mare, Kore, dragoness, lamp, lightning flash, Star, lion, she-wolf, AĒŌ ĒĒ. A sieve, an old utensil, is your1358 symbol, And one morsel of flesh, a piece of coral, Blood of a turtledove,1359 hoof of a camel, Hair of a virgin cow, the seed of Pan, Fire from a sunbeam, colt’s foot, spindel tree, Boy love, bow drill, a gray-eyed woman’s body With legs outspread, a black sphinx’s pierced vagina: All of these are the symbol[s] of my power.1360 Many of these may also be code words for some other, often more innocuous but less poetic ingredient. During the invocation of the Moon goddess [Nephthys/Selene] the magician is told to show: ...in your right hand a [single-stemmed] wormwood and in your left a snakeskin, and recite the [specified] formulas [and ask] what you wish [for], and it will happen.1361 In the Hygromanteia, the laurel wreath is replaced by a crown. Only two manuscripts (H and P) record a version of chapter 32, which describes the crown. This item might have been designed to fool the spirits into believing that the magician was a king, or even king Solomon, but this faux crown is simply made of virgin parchment, like a party hat. It of course has its own allocation of names, signs and sigils. The crown is a sort of play-acting insignia to impress the spirits, along the same lines as claiming to be Solomon or Osiris in order to compel obedience. It must be made of virgin parchment, appropriately consecrated, with nomina magica written thereon. The word which is to be inscribed on the crown is \u001e\u0002\u0013\u000b\t\u0005\u0003!\u000b\u0017\u0003, PantokratKr: a title sometimes applied to   1355 PGM VII. 884. 1356 Betz (1996), p. 79. 1357 This goddess morphed into a demon in mediaeval grimoires.

The latter is more likely to be the reason behind its use on the crown. The crown also survives in the Clavicula Salomonis, and Mathers’ AC Text-Family of the Key of Solomon states that: ...the Master of the Art should have a Crown made of virgin paper, upon which should be written these four Names:- Yod, He, Vau, He, in front; Adonai behind; El on the right; and Elohim on the left... The Disciples should each have a Crown of virgin paper whereon these Divine symbols should be marked in scarlet.1363 The laurel, which earlier took the place of a crown, later retained its association with Apollo by being listed in the Key of Solomon as an appropriate wood to burn in rites of the Sun. 1364 All the inscribed clothing of the magician (including the crown) might be construed as a form of protection, but it is more likely that these inscriptions and symbology (such as the lion skin belt) were meant to impress the spirit with the power or royalty (symbolised by the crown) of the magician, so that the spirit might more readily take orders from the magician. 6.10 Magical Statues or Stoicheia (J) The magical statues or stoicheia may originally have developed from temple statues, or more specifically from the speaking statues of the Egyptian temples. One very clear example of the creation of a magical statue in the PGM was designed for a very modern purpose, bringing customers into a business premise.1365 This particular Graeco-Egyptian type of statue had obviously been often produced, as it even had a pet name, “the little beggar.” Its function is translated by R. F. Hock simply as a ‘charm,’ but the original Greek is a very specific word: \u0005\u0002\u000b\u0002\u0005\u0010\u000b\r\u0005\t\u0013. The suffix ‘-X\u0005\t\u0013’ would seem to indicate an image or statue, and –\u0005\u0010\u000b- probably relates to \u0005\u0010\u000b?\u0003 ̓, “one who calls or summons.”1366 A more precise translation might therefore have been “a statue that summons [customers].” This statue, made of a single block of hollowed juniper, is made in the likeness of a man:   1362 2 Corinthians 6:18. 1363 Mathers (1909), p. 92. Another version, Wellcome MS 4669, p. 15, gives the names as Agla, Aglata, Aglou, and Aglatay, all variations on AGLA. 1364 Mathers (1909), p. 119. 1365 Such animated statues, particularly those of a golden cat with a mechanical paw beckoning potential customers are a common feature of business premises throughout S. E. Asia. Although there is no suggestion of cultural transmission, it is sometimes enlightening to find instructive parallel usages that have survived longer in Asia than in Europe. 1366 \u0005Y\u000b\u0002 is here used in the sense of stirring up the ‘insatiable’ desire of customers."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" 318 ...having his right hand in the position of begging and having in his left a bag and staff. Let there be around the staff a coiled snake, and let him be dressed in a girdle and standing on a sphere that has a coiled snake, like Isis...and have an asp covering the top as a capital.1367 The snake is of course the Agathos Daimon, the good daimon, as is clearly confirmed by the inscriptions which the practitioner is enjoined to write on various parts of the statue. In relation to the Agathos Daimon, the author makes reference to Epaphroditos1368 who suggests various alternative names for the inscription. However, I believe the image is “Harpon Knouphi,”1369 a form of Harpocrates Chnoubis, which also explains the presence of the snakes. The consecration of this statue is complex, and includes the sacrifice of a whole animal, which has been variously suggested to be a wild ass or a wild ram.1370 But both those interpretations are based on adding modifiers to the existing text \"\b\u0003ι\t\u0013, which is clearly written by itself both in line 2399 and line 3148. The animals suggested are those of Typhon (ass) or Khnum (ram), neither of which gods coincide in any way with the modelled image. As \"\b\u0003ι\t\u0013 simply means ‘wild,’ there is no implication of a specific animal, except that we know it should have a white forehead. I suggest that the animal may have been an oryx, which is truly a wild animal with magical connotations, or more likely a wild cow, as the invocation continues: “I receive you as the cowherd who has his camp toward the south.”1371 After consecration, the statue is set up in a shop or business to “bring to me silver, gold, clothing, much wealth.” Another example of the use of magical statues in the process of invocation, this time of the goddess Selene (with a nod toward Aphrodite-Urania) is made of clay: The preparation for Mistress Selene is made like this: Take clay from a potter’s wheel and mix a mixture with sulfur, and add blood of a dappled goat and mold an image of Mistress Selene the Egyptian,1372 as shown below,1373 making her in the form of the Universe. And make a shrine of olive wood and do not let it face the sun at all. And after dedicating it with the ritual that works   1367 PGM IV. 2380-2389. 1368 Despite the fact that Betz remarks that “nothing is known about him,” this probably refers to Epaphroditos (20/25-95 CE), Nero’s secretary. As unlikely as this may seem, Epaphroditos was the owner of a slave who was Epictetus of Hierapolis, a Stoic philosopher. He in turn had been taught by Musonius Rufus, who was reputed to have written letters to Apollonius of Tyana. Whether he did or not is not important. What is important is the reputed indirect connection between Epaphroditos and the most famous magician of the age, which considerably increases the likelihood that this Epaphroditos was the one able to comment cogently on that particular magical procedure. 1369 See Harpon-Knouphi in PGM III. 435-6, 560-63; IV. 2433; VII. 1023-25; XXXVI. 219-20. Harpon-Knouphi is not derived from the Egyptian phrase “Horus the pillar of Kenmet” as suggested by several scholars. 1370 Jacoby (in Preisendanz Vol. I, p. 147) suggests ‘ass’ whilst Eitrem (ibid) suggests ‘ram.’ 1371 Line 2435. 1372 This suggests that the image would actually be of the Egyptian sky goddess Nut (or Tefnut) rather than the Greek Selene. That means the image might have been that of a dark blue cow with many stars painted on her hide. Plutarch equates Nut with Rhea rather than Selene. 1373 The figure is missing."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" 319 for everything, [put it away] and thus it will be dedicated in advance. And anoint it also with lunar ointment and wreathe it. And late at night, at the 5th hour, put it away, facing Selene in a [pure] room. And also offer the lunar offering and repeat the following in succession and you will send dreams, and you will bind spells [with its aid], for the invocation to Selene is very effective. And after anointing yourself in advance [with] the ointment, appeal to her.1374 Another rite suggests a figure of an ape and a fish made of wax, for an invocation of Thoth,1375 utilising animals sacred to that god. Kerberos, being a guardian of the entrance to hell, is invoked so that the dead may carry out the magician’s wishes (in the same way they do with a defixio) and bind a woman. The rite requires a statue of a dog (possibly Anubis), made of wax, pitch, virgin fruit, and manna. The dog is to be eight fingers long, and have its mouth wide open as if barking. It is activated by placing a suitably inscribed bone (from a man who died violently) in its mouth; or by sitting it on a papyrus strip inscribed with “IAŌ ASTŌ IŌPHĒ.” An invocation is then to be said, and the dog will bark if it succeeds.1376 Statues of the gods, especially Anubis, were also utilised by magicians. In two consecutive rites the magician asks Anubis to send a spirit to influence someone else’s dreams. In each case an image of Anubis is used. In the first example: On a new papyrus: you should draw an image of Anubis with blood of a black dog on it; you should write these writings under it; you should put it [in] to the mouth of [the statue of the] black dog of the embalming house; you should make great offerings before it; you should put frankincense on the brazier before him; you should do it as a libation of milk of a black cow...and you should put its recitation [invocation] in its mouth.1377 In the second passage: On a jackal of clean clay which is lying down,1378 its body moistened with milk and fluid of a jackal of the embalming house... You should write your words on a new papyrus; you should put it in the jackal’s mouth; and you should leave the jackal on a copper lamp which a brazier is heating.1379 In each case the papyrus on which the spell is written is put into the mouth of the Anubis statue, which is then heated, censed, and in one case libated. The ritual is not religious, but aimed at getting the god to enforce the spirit to influence the intended ‘victim.’ In a Byzantine context, the word telesma was often applied to these statues as well as to metal (or parchment) talismans. According to Magdalino, the first use of stoicheia as a technical term to describe these statues was in the Parastaseis,1380 in the early 8th century.1381   1374 i.e. invoke her.

It appears that the word stoicheion can also apply to the spirit so fixed. As such it is sometimes defined as “an elementary spirit.” Some scholars have suggested the definition “personally active spiritual being,” which is only marginally correct, in the sense that some magician has personally fixed the spirit to a statue or talisman.1383 One Christian view of pagan idols was that they were ‘animated’ by a stoicheion fixed to the statue. In that light it is easy to see what St Paul means when he writes to the Galatians that the congregation should not lapse back to worshipping pagan idols, or more explicitly, being “in bondage under [the influence of] \u000b! \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002 \u000b\r\u0013 ̓ \u0005\r\u0014\u0004\t\u0013.”1384 According to Greenfield, “by the late Byzantine period \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\t\u0013 had...come to denote a much lesser elemental spirit.”1385 I suspect that there was a hierarchy of \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002, from the simplest fixed spirit right up to the \u000b! \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002 \u000b\r\u0013 ̓ \u0005\r\u0014\u0004\t\u0013 occupying the statues of gods, rather than any change in its meaning over time.

Apart from oracular heads, like those attributed to the Templars or Roger Bacon, there is no trace of animated statues in the Latin grimoire tradition. 6.11 Magical Rings and Gemstones (K) Solomon’s Ring appears in many texts as the source of his power over the spirits. The Testament of Solomon describes the Ring (δακτυλιδιον) as having been given to Solomon by God, via the hand of the archangel Michael. As a result of this story, the magician’s ring appears in the Hygromanteia, and has often featured in grimoires, as it was such an integral part of Solomon’s ability to command the spirits. The Ring was not usually made of the obvious choices, gold or silver, but was made of iron (for the same reason as an iron sword was used), or of brass, as brass was the metal of the confining Brass Vessel.   1382 \u0014\u000b\tι\u0015\f\u0016\u0002. 1383 See Blum (1946) for various other opinions about the meaning of stoicheia. 1384 Galatians 4:3. See also 4:8. 1385 ‘Elemental spirit’ is misleading here, as that would mean a spirit of Earth, Air, Fire or Water. 1386 See Greenfield (1988), pp. 192-5."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":" 321 The Jewish Encyclopaedia explains that Solomon’s Ring: ...was partly brass and partly iron. With the brass part of the ring Solomon signed his written commands to the good genii, and with the iron part he signed his commands to the evil genii, or devils. The Arabic writers declare also that Solomon received four jewels from four different angels, and that he set them in one ring, so that he could control the four elements. The legend that Asmodeus once obtained possession of the ring and threw it into the sea, and that Solomon was thus deprived of his power until he discovered the ring inside a fish, also has an Arabic source.1387 Stories about this Ring have spread throughout the Middle East, and it appears in the 1st/2nd century CE text The Testament of Solomon, which tells the story of Solomon’s subjugation of 60 demons, which he later either imprisons or puts to work building the Temple. This text is seminal for Solomonic magic as it details some of the methods used to subdue demons, specifically the use of nomina magica, and the doctrine of thwarting angels. It also acts as a catalogue of demons, their abilities and how each can be defeated. Solomon’s Ring features strongly in the Testament of Solomon where it is the Ring that enabled him to bind the first spirit Ornias, who is later compelled to act as his familiar spirit or magical assistant, introducing him to a succession of other demons. The ring reappears in many grimoires, but there does not seem to be any consistent view as to its design. This archetypal grimoire provides the basis for the register of spirits and the use of thwarting angels: classic cases of transmission of magical techniques over 15 centuries. Both of these techniques appear later in the 1641 Goetia of Dr. Rudd.1388 The supreme ritual for the consecration of rings and their gemstones is given in two places in the twelfth papyrus of the PGM, with another similar consecration in an earlier section.1389 The invocation calls on a wide range of gods,1390 but finishes by revealing that the god primarily called upon is OUPHŌR.1391 The rubric explains that towards the end of the consecration, the ring and gemstone should be inserted into the body cavity of a live rooster and left there for a whole day. Magical rings were also very much a part of Gnostic practice, many of which now lie in museums around the world. The attributions of semi-precious stones are mentioned in one passage,1392 in connection with the representation of the planets on an astrological board:1393   1387 ‘Solomon, Seal of’ in Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. 1388 Edited in Rankine & Skinner (2007), pp. 103-174. 1389 PGM XII. 270-350, 201-269. 1390 Including Helios, Ouroboros, Kheperi, Iao Sabaoth, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Astaphaios, Bainchōōch, Amoun and Osiris. 1391 OUPHŌR is perhaps a word of compulsion rather than the name of a god, according to Thissen (1991), pp. 299-230; Vergote (1961), pp. 213-214. 1392 PGM CX. 1-12. 1393 However the list equally well serves for the construction of magical rings."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":" 322 Planet Metal/Stone Sun gold Moon silver Kronos (Saturn) obsidian Ares (Mars) yellow-green onyx Aphrodite (Venus) lapis-lazuli streaked with gold Hermes (Mercury) turquoise Zeus (Jupiter)1394 [dark blue] stone, but underneath of crystal Chapter 34 of the Hygromanteia, concerning the making of the Ring, appears in a number of manuscripts, attesting to its importance. Very strangely the Ring in H is said to be made of virgin wax covered with parchment, and is therefore rather impermanent.1395 Only G has a ring to be made by a goldsmith out of silver, and engraved with a long Greek inscription. The most interesting part of this inscription is the word ‘Bisegeubarpharaggēs.’ When broken down into its constituent parts it yields ‘Bisegeu bar Pharaggēs’ the latter part of which is a name well attested in the PGM, and also on some inverted Mesopotamian demon bowls.1396 This is a clear link back to earlier Graeco-Egyptian magic. In most manuscript sources the design is described as a simple pentagram, or sometimes as a hexagram, rather than the elaborate design offered by the Hygromanteia.1397 Marathakis makes an interesting point connecting the Testament of Solomon more closely to the Hygromanteia: However, in the Private Library of the Earl of Leicester, No 99 (15th century), and in Bibliothèque Nationale, Supplément Grec, No 500 (16th century), there are inscriptions on the ring, very close to the inscriptions described in H, P, A, B and B3. The inscription of G seems to be derived from them, but it is quite corrupt. A somewhat different version, with the inscription abbreviated, can be found earlier in H, in the Testament of Solomon material (f. 8v).1398 The inscription on the ring in the Earl of Leicester’s Library is: K[yri]e ho Theos hēmōn, Leōn, Sabaōth, Bionik, A, Ō, A, Elōi, Eaō, Iōase, Sougeōa, Aia, Aeniou, Ou, Ouniou, Ēra. Compare this with the inscription in one manuscript of the Hygromanteia which shows a silver ring with a big bezel and the following very similar inscription: K[yri]e ho Th[eo]s, ho boēthos hēmōn, Iōsos, Sabaōth, Isaiō, Adōnai, Thiōaō, Aeōlōie, Aiōa, Bisegeubarpharaggēs,1399 Meob, Aphone, Monou.1400 The connection with the Testament of Solomon is not surprising, although the Testament   1394 Interestingly the planets are indicated by naming the corresponding Greek god, a procedure also followed in the Hygromanteia. 1395 I can only conjecture that this made it easier to destroy in times of persecution. 1396 Sesengen bar Pharangēs.

Note that no longer is there a pentagram or hexagram as part of the ring design, and here the ring is sometimes described as a disk to be held up in front of the magician’s face. This suggests that the scribe who wrote this particular manuscript of the Goetia was working from an older manuscript which showed the ring on the page as a two-dimensional figure, rather than receiving verbal instruction from another magician who would simply have shown him his (three-dimensional) ring. 6.12 Wax and Clay Images Both wax and clay images were as much a part of magic in the PGM as they were a part of the Hygromanteia in the early centuries of the Orthodox Christian era, or a part of village witchcraft of the 15th-18th century. In ancient Egypt, creator gods like Khnum were reputed to form gods and people from clay, on the potter’s wheel, before breathing life into them. It is therefore logical for Egyptian magicians to use clay to make images into which life could be breathed. Dough and wax were also used for this purpose. Wax images of Apep were made before being deliberately destroyed. Wax and clay were the ingredients most easily to hand for the creating of figurines to represent the person who was the object of a spell, or to make an (ensouled) spirit statue. Wax was also valued for its ability to absorb an impression, because of its semi-organic beehive origin. As well as the making of images, clay is also used for making the ‘brick,’ an item mentioned in both Babylonian magic and the PGM where it acts as a seat or altar. I suspect that this item is not a house brick, which would not be appropriate in such a magical context, where purity was so important, but is in fact a clay tablet. If this were so then it makes a lot more sense, because the placing of ritual impedimenta on it would then let it act like an altar. One spell of attraction, for binding a lover, uses two clay figures, with the male figure like Ares plunging his sword into the female.1404 This aggressive pose is surprisingly designed to cause longing in the female rather than pain. The formula also mandates the use of 13 copper needles to be inserted into parts of her anatomy.1405 The design is to ensure “she may remember no one but me, NN, alone.” Such figures in clay and wax are fairly universal to   1403 Peterson (2001), p. 43. 1404 PGM IV. 296-466. 1405 The image’s brain (1), ears (2), eyes (2), mouth (1), midriff (2), hands (1 each), pudenda (2), soles of the feet (2)."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" 325 magic, but images pierced with needles, nails or pins are intuitively usually assumed to be examples of hate magic rather than love magic. The rite continues by tying a lead tablet to the figure with 365 knots whilst saying “Abrasax, hold her fast!” The 365 refers both to all the days of the year and to the isopsephy of the name Abraxas. The lead tablet indicates that it is to be used as a defixio and buried by or in the grave of someone unrelated (and probably untimely dead). Although this sounds a rather macabre place for a love image, the theory is that the soul of the newly dead person can pass the message on to one of the chthonic gods: Kore, Persephone, Erishkigal, Anubis, etc, who is then able to carry out the magician’s wishes. Anubis Psirinth is specially characterised as “holding the keys to Hades.” Perhaps the most complete formula for making a magical statue, this time of Hermes, for the purpose of dream sending, uses a special clay mix: Take 28 leaves from a pithy laurel tree1406 and some virgin earth1407 and seed of wormwood, wheat meal and the herb [called] calf’s snout (but I have heard1408 from a certain man of Herakleopolis that he takes 28 new sprouts from an olive tree, which is cultivated, the famous one). Those are carried by an uncorrupted boy.1409 Also pounded together with the foregoing ingredients is the liquid of an ibis egg1410 and made into a uniform dough and [then] into a figure of Hermes wearing a mantle, while the moon is ascending in Aries or Leo or Virgo or Sagittarius. Let Hermes be holding a herald’s staff. And write the spell1411 on hieratic papyrus or on a goose’s windpipe... and insert it into the figure for the purpose of inspiration;1412 and when you want to use it, take some papyrus and write the spell and the matter [being enquired about]; and shave your head1413 and roll a hair into the papyrus, binding it with a piece of purple cord, and put on the outside of it an olive branch, and place it at the feet of the [clay statue of] Hermes (but others say: place it upon him). And let the figure lie in a shrine of lime wood. But when you want to use it, place the shrine beside your head along with the [image of the] god and recite [the spell] as on the altar you burn incense, earth from a grain-bearing field and one lump of rock salt. Let it rest beside your head, and go to sleep after saying the spell1414 without giving an answer to anyone... Recite this both at sunrise and moonrise.1415 Another love spell utilises a wax image of Osiris embedded with the hair of the woman desired by the magician, together with the hair of “a donkey1416 together with a bone of a lizard” all of which should be buried under the doorsill of her house.1417 The latter procedure is a common usage in Mediaeval and later magic in Europe, where the magical image is   1406 The laurel is sacred to Apollo. 1407 Probably clay. 1408 An interpolation by the scribe, or an early redactor. 1409 Such as might have been used by the magician as a skryer. 1410 Symbolic of Thoth. 1411 PGM V. 424-435. 1412 To enable the statue to breathe. 1413 In the manner of a priest. 1414 PGM V. 400-421. 1415 PGM V. 370-446. 1416 For lust, or symbolic of Typhon like the ass. 1417 PDM xii. 50-61 has the same instruction, to bury it “under the doorsill of the house.”"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" 326 buried in a place often crossed by the intended victim of the spell.1418 The use of a lizard is a recurrent theme, possibly because it was an easily obtainable animal. In one example a spotted lizard1419 is cooked in an iron vessel, to encourage hatred, as “Helios and all the gods have hated you.” This is a slander spell implicating the object of desire has been lying about the lizard.1420 A large number of figurines in beeswax and clay (but also in lead, bronze, magnetite, etc.) are listed by Versnel in the course of his commentary on one particular text.1421 He highlights the deformities of these figures, such as twisted heads and broken necks. Such deformities are apparent in the ‘poppets’ used in magic later in northern European witchcraft, but not so commonly in Solomonic magic. Sometimes, a rite in the PGM will specify a drawing of a figure rather than a wax or clay three-dimensional execution. One such example gives the following detailed description of Bes-Pantheos: Take a clean linen cloth, and (according to Ostanes) with myrrh ink draw a figure on it which is humanlike in appearance but has four wings, having the left arm outstretched along with the two left wings, and having the other arm bent with the fist clenched. Then upon the head [draw] a royal headdress and a cloak over its arm, with two spirals on the cloak. Atop the head [draw] bull horns and to the buttocks a bird’s tail. Have his right hand near his stomach and clinched (sic), and on either ankle [thigh?] have a sword extended.1422 Bes has long been known as a helpful god assisting in both childbirth and magic, but Bes-Pantheos (literally “Bes all gods”) is more cast in the mould of a master of spirits, and has a number of similarities to the daimons/demons that he controls. Chapters 28 and 29 in the Hygromanteia deal with the preparation and use of the virgin wax and the virgin clay. The main purpose of the virgin wax seems to be in the construction of the magic ring. This seems as if it could be the result of misinterpretation of an earlier source manuscript, as wax would typically be used to seal something like a document, by impressing the ring upon the wax. A further loss of meaning is obvious from the fact that, although the wax is meant also for fashioning images, there is no mention of these images in the text. A typically Christian provision has been inserted in the text where it says that, after collection of the wax from a beehive, it should be stored in a church for a while, and prayers said over it. It seems certain that the clay and the wax were also meant for image making of potential   1418 PDM lxi. 112-27. 1419 Which must be “taken from the place where bodies are mummified.” 1420 PDM Lxi. 197-216 [PGM LXI. 39-71]. 1421 Versnel (1988), pp. 287-292. 1422 PGM XII. 121-143."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" 327 ‘victims,’ but this detail has been cautiously left out by the scribe.

The faces on his knees appear again in mediaeval depictions of demons.1423 Mathers’ edition of the Key of Solomon does mention the virgin clay together with the virgin wax, but is not very forthcoming about its actual use.1424 In one AC version of the Key of Solomon1425 the magician is instructed to: ...put it in a pot of new earthenware so that he may use it as need be. Let him cork the pot with a piece of parchment upon which he will have traced the character below with the blood of a kid goat; and let the Master of the Art make a hole in his cellar and place it there, and let it rest there for 24 hours...1426 The use of wax in the making of pentacles surfaces again in the late 16th century when Dee made both pentacles and a skrying crystal support out of wax, now in the British Museum.1427 The use of wax or clay for the making of images is a universal magical technique common to all three periods. Another condition common to all three periods is that the wax should be virgin, so that it did not retain any impressions of earlier images.

These oil names occur first on jar labels from the royal tombs of the first dynasty (3100-2857 BCE). Although the museum which displayed this object suggested they may have been connected with the process of embalming, the fact that they are a set of seven, with depressions holding quantities too small to be of any use in embalming a corpse, militates against this. It is most likely that they actually contained the incense oils of the seven planets. One papyrus romanticises the generation of the key incenses associated with particular Egyptian gods: Horus cried. The water fell from his eye to earth and it grew. That is how dry myrrh came to be. Geb was sad on account of it. Blood fell from his nose to the ground and it grew. That is how pines came to be and resins came to be from their fluid. Then Shu and Tefnut cried exceedingly. The water from their eyes fell to the ground and it grew. That is how incense came to be.1430 In the PGM, myrrh is particularly significant, as talismanic writing of any sort is almost always recommended to be written with perfumed myrrh ink. Apart from the Horus connection, myrrh was also intimately connected with Anubis, god of the Underworld: Open to me, O you of the underworld, O box of myrrh that is in my hand!... O box of myrrh which has four corners. O dog who is called Anubis by name, who rests on the box of myrrh, whose feet are set on the box of myrrh...1431 Other incenses used include: ...a wolf’s eye, storax gum, cassia, balsam gum and whatever is valued among the spices...1432 The invocation of Selene mandates the burning of an offering of Cretan storax on pieces of juniper wood.1433 It makes a clear distinction between the use of the rite for beneficent operations (using only incense) and for coercive operations (using the same incense on the   1428 Weill-Parot (2012), p. 271. 1429 Calcite oil tablet from Giza tomb item 4733 E, 19.5 cm x 9.2 cm x 2.2 cm found by the Harvard University Museum of Fine Arts expedition of 1914.

Another passage suggests the following oil for a face anointment which will win favour and respect: ...in first-quality lotus oil (or tšps oil) or moringa oil...;1436 add styrax to it together with first quality myrrh and seeds of “great-of-love” plant in a faience vessel... anoint your face with it; place the wreath in your hand; go to any place; [and be] among any people. It creates for you very great praise among them indeed.1437 To consecrate a lead lamella, it was recommended that the magician cense the lamella with a mixture of myrrh, bdellium, styrax, aloes, thyme and river mud.1438 Roses and sumac are also mentioned as an offering.1439 One passage in the PGM lists incenses for doing good as: ...storax, myrrh, sage, frankincense, and a fruit pit.1440 Sulphur and the seed of Nile rushes were used as incense to the Moon and Isis.1441 Sulphur later reoccurs as an incense of Saturn in the Heptameron. The incenses to be found in the PGM are to a large extent the same as those found in the Hygromanteia, and in later Latin grimoires (see Table 16). The habit of using scented inks persists from the PGM, and is present in the Hygromanteia. Chapter 14 of the Hygromanteia deals with planetary incenses, characters and seals,1442 seven composite incenses are prescribed, one for each planet. Every planetary incense is followed by the planetary characteres, which are intended to be written on planetary talismans. This chapter overlaps with the chapter 16 on planetary incenses, because the planetary inks and parchments also need to be censed after writing.1443 Two manuscripts (H and B3) also have more complex planetary incenses, whilst G gives just one perfumed ink: “saffron, musk, oak galls, blue vitriol or similar materials.”1444   1434 Myrtus communis. 1435 From the city of Mendes in the Nile delta. 1436 \u001d!\u0010\u0002\u0013\t\u0007 \u0004\u000f\u0003\f%ι\u0015, Moringa pterygosperma or Moringa aptera.

After the ritual bath and before the evocation, the magician is advised to anoint himself with musk, civet, clove, costus and water milfoil pounded with rose oil. Manuscript B gives rose oil with musk, asafoetida, clove and water milfoil.1445 The thinking behind this may be to completely hide the smell of the human body, paralleling those texts which compare spirits to shy wild animals, who will not want to approach if they can smell humans. Another procedure gives an interesting recipe: You must also have four little braziers. Put inside them the following substances: steratzon,1446 calamint, styrax, nigella oil – this is the oil of the black cumin - aloe wood ashes – this is powdered oud – spikenard, saffron and nutmeg. Put them into the little braziers to be censed.1447 Manuscript G gives a slightly different list: musk, styrax, aloe wood, spikenard, saffron and nutmeg.1448 The incense for evocation according to H is: Aloe wood, fragrant costus, frankincense, musk,1449 clove, nutmeg and saffron. Moreover, add some water lily, nigella, root of daffodil and blood of a man that was killed undeservedly.1450 The Latin grimoires continued to see incense as a most important ingredient in magical operations. The Raziel or Librum Razielis,1451 (also called Cephar Raziel,1452 or more correctly Sepher Raziel) is a Solomonic grimoire1453 appearing in a manuscript dating from November 1564.1454 It is divided into seven separate treatises, of which the third, the Tractatus Thymiamatus, is devoted solely to incense and ‘suffumigations.’ As Solomon is made to say: ...suffumigations, sacrifice and unction make to open the gates of air, and of fire, and of all the other heavens.1455   1445 G, f. 26. 1446 Also spelled styratzon. 1447 B, f. 27v. 1448 G, f. 26v. 1449 A and B omit the musk. 1450 H, f. 34. 1451 Sloane MS 3826, 3846 [both English], 3847 [Latin]. 1452 This mistaken orthography derives from the Latin Sloane MS 3853, f. 46 [old foliation 41], where an extended upwards flourish on the initial ‘S’ has caused subsequent scribes to read it as a ‘C.’ 1453 It is also called Liber Salomonis in Sloane MS 3826, f. 2. 1454 Transcribed in full in Karr and Skinner (2010). 1455 Sloane MS 3826, f. 27v."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":" 331 And later in the same manuscript the precise reason is outlined: And all spiritual [creatures], with the right fumigation [incense], shall obey you, and shall come to you, and they shall do your commandment.1456 Finally Solomon is quoted: And Solomon said that as the Adamant [diamond] draweth [32v] Iron to himself,1457 so knowe thou that suffumigacion gathereth together and draweth the spirits of the ayre, and maketh them to come to the place where thou doest it [the experiment] and will gather them togither.1458 This passage underlines the great importance of incense in magical operations. The use of perfumed ink which was an important item in the magic of the PGM, was also continued in Sepher Raziel. The listing of planetary incenses in the PGM is in most cases short, but highly significant, as parallel lists can be identified in a number of later magical texts. In fact, in the Latin and later English texts of Sepher Raziel (1564), the topic has achieved the status of a separate treatise with the title Tractatus Thymiamatus.1459 Table 16 shows the planetary configuration of incenses in nine texts. Although the Book of Jubilees, and PGM agree in most cases, suggesting that in fact they may have been contemporary sources. However the transfer from Egypt and Palestine to Constantinople has resulted in a discontinuity with regard to incense.1460 In more modern times, Rabbi Falk (1708-1782), a Jewish magician who was called the Ba’al Shem1461 of London, mixed incenses in his magical workshop which was located on London Bridge was: ...furnished with talismans, candles and plates of gold. He inscribed on the floor the Seal of Solomon (better known as the Jewish emblem, the Star of David) which he anointed with alum,1462 raisins, dates, cedar and lignum aloes, and mounted on the wall a deer’s head containing holy names to ward off fires.1463 The deer’s skull was more likely to have been a substitute for a human skull, of the oracular variety,1464 with the phrase “to ward off fires” merely being his deliberately deceptive answer   1456 Sloane MS 3826, f. 30. 1457 A common mediaeval misconception. 1458 Sloane MS 3826, f. 32r-32v. 1459 The word \u000e\u000f\u0004\u0006\u0002\u0004\u0002 means incense. 1460 Probably because the traditional incenses were no longer obtainable in Byzantium after the loss of Egypt as a colony in 395. 1461 Master of the holy name, in other words a practical Kabbalist with miracle/magic working abilities. 1462 Probably a replacement for natron.

A few conclusions can be drawn from Table 16, some of which will help in the later establishment of a lineage for the European grimoires. There appears to be two separate traditions with regard to the planetary incenses. The oldest is undoubtedly that outlined in the Book of Jubilees, PGM and the Orphic Hymns which allocates a single incense to each   1479 Agrippa (1993), Book I, Chapter 44. 1480 Sloane MS 3826, f. 28. 1481 F, 37b. 1482 Wellcome MS 4670, p. 39. 1483 The movement of myrrh from the bottom of a list to the top suggests a transcription error. 1484 A synonym for ‘brimstone,’ 1485 An incense and resin which can be derived from at least 15 different plant species. The Romans derived their dragon’s blood from Dracaena cinnabari. 1486 A later passage (f. 28v) states that the incenses of the Moon, according to Hermes, are cinnamon, lignum aloes, mastic, crocus, costus, mace, myrtle. This passage looks as if it was originally a seven planet list rather than just the attributions for the one planet."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" 335 planet. The second tradition as exemplified in the Hygromanteia gives a number of possible incenses for each planet, a practice that is also followed in the Juratus. A third tradition is visible in Agrippa,1487 and in Raziel, where separate parts of the plants used as incenses, so that roots are attributed to Saturn, fruits to Jupiter, wood to Mars, gums and resins to the Sun, compounds (‘pills’) of plant parts to Mercury, and leaves to the Moon. The Key of Solomon1488 includes both arrays of incenses, but the compound incenses also have added animal parts and blood. The use of cat’s and human blood for Mars incense is also found in the Hygromanteia.1489 One useful conclusion, at least with regard to incenses, is that the Heptameron, the 1796 Clavicula Salomonis and the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh were obviously derived from the same source. 6.14 Herbs (Y) Solomonic method extends to meticulous attention to detail when preparing the equipment or materia to be used in a rite, and procuring herbs for such use is no exception. Mesopotamia Paying careful attention to the procedure for uprooting medical or magical herbs is derived from Mesopotamian magical practice. A typical description of such precautions found in a Mesopotamian herbarium suggests the magician should: [Look for] a gourd which grows alone in the plain; when the Sun has gone down, cover your head with a kerchief, cover the gourd too, draw a magic circle with flour around it, and in the morning, before the Sun comes out, pull it up from its location, take its root ... These instructions specify the time for picking the plant, and the precautions to be observed in regard to both the plant and the herbalist. The scene is night (between sunset and sun-rise); the plant is isolated by a magic circle and covered; and the herbalist protects himself by covering his head. Night time may be specified in other ways: sometimes it is sufficient to say that the sun must not \"see\" the herb: for example, a root \"which the sun did not see when you pulled the plant and surrounding it with a magic circle are necessary because the plant may not willingly give up the root, leaf, or shoot needed for preparing the medicine; one must buy it from the plant, or at least give some compensation for it.”1490 Theophrastus notes: That one should be bidden to pray while cutting is not perhaps unreasonable, but the additions   1487 De Occulta Philosophia, Book I, chapter 44. 1488 Wellcome MS 4670. 1489 H, f. 24. 1490 Reiner (1995), pp. 36-37."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" 336 made to this injunction are absurd: for instance, as to cutting the kind of all-heal (panakes) one should put in the ground in its place an offering made of all kind of fruits and a cake; and that, when one is cutting gladwyn [Gk., 2\u001eA;1491 = iris?], one should put in its place to pay for it, cakes of meal from spring-sown wheat, and that one should cut it with a two-edged sword, first making a circle round it three times. . .1492 There is also a common injunction not to use an iron instrument in digging, even though a two-edged sword of a different metal would be acceptable. This is a very old limitation, and reoccurs in a slightly different form in many Latin grimoires where iron instruments, specifically an iron sword are used to threaten the spirits. In the PGM attention was also paid to how medical and magical herbs were uprooted, and this care survived through the PGM formulae to Latin and English grimoires right up to the 18th century herbals. The reason for this care was so the herb’s power is retained and no adverse luck would be incurred by the magician for uprooting it. The procedure is spelled out in some detail: Among the Egyptians herbs are always obtained like this: the herbalist first purifies his own body. First he sprinkles with natron and fumigates the herb with resin from a pine tree after carrying it [the smoking resin] around the place 3 times. Then, after burning kyphi and pouring the libation of milk as he prays, he pulls up the plant while invoking by name the daimon to whom the herb is being dedicated and calling upon him to be more effective for the use for which it is being acquired... After saying this [invocation], he rolls the harvested stalk in a pure linen cloth (but into the place of its roots they (sic) threw seven seeds of wheat and an equal number of barley, after mixing them with honey), and after pouring [this mixture] in the ground which has been dug up [to propitiate the plant so harvested], he departs.1493 This latter procedure is presumably some kind of compensation to the earth, for what has been taken, so that no resentment by the earth (or its spirits) will hinder the magical operation the herbs are destined to be used in. Another example in the PGM of the special precautions taken when uprooting herbs includes a spell to be addressed to the plant to ask its forgiveness: Spell for picking a plant: Use it before sunrise. The spell to be spoken: “I am picking you, such and such a plant, with my five-fingered hand, I, NN, and I am bringing you home so that you may work for me for a certain purpose. I adjure you by the undefiled name of the god: if you pay no heed to me, the earth which produced you will no longer be watered as far as you are concerned – ever in life again...1494 One of the most significant sections in the PGM gives a key to the description of herbs and other items with flowery and alarming names. This key may be of use in interpreting some of the items that have made their way into Western European grimoires.   1491 The gladwyn is a an English herb usually called “stinking iris.” The Greek in this quote does not look correct, as an 2\u001eA is only listed in Liddell as “a worm that eats horn and wood.” 1492 Theophrastus, Historia Plantarum 9.8.7.

In both herbal sections of the Hygromanteia, considerable attention is paid to the mechanics of picking the herbs magically as in the PGM, so that their power is retained and no adverse events occur as a result of this action. For example: When you want to uproot the herb that is attributed to a planet, first recite the prayer of the planet. Then recite the conjuration of the angel that rules that day and hour, on your knees, and with extreme piety... Uproot it and leave it out for seven nights, under the stars.1509 Chapter 17 of the Hygromanteia lists the zodiacal herbs. On the basis that this chapter only appears in one manuscript,1510 Marathakis doubts that it is actually part of the Hygromanteia. It describes the magical and medical qualities of twelve herbs which are attributed to the twelve signs of the zodiac. The point of mentioning the Raziel was to demonstrate that often sections on “herbs, words, and stones” were seen as an integral part of Solomonic grimoires. The herbs of the zodiacal signs are shown in Table 18, alongside a similar, but unrelated text from B2 attributed to Harpocratio, which attributes very different plants.1511   1504 Hermann Fischer, Mittelalterliche Pflanzenkunde, Hildesheim: Olms, 1976, p. 276. 1505 PGM xiv. 966-69. 1506 Betz and John Scarborough (1988) indicate that similar key lists can be found in De succedaneis which was included among the works of Galen; in C G Kuehn [ed.], Claudii Galeni Opera Omnia, vol. 19, 1830, pp. 721-47; and in the adapted version of this in Paulus Aegineta, Corpus Medicorum Graecorum, IX/2, I. L Heiberg, [ed.], vol. II, pp. 401-8; and also in Dioscorides' Materia Medica. Therefore these substitutions were more widespread in use than just in a magical context. 1507 The order has been changed to facilitate comparison of similar ‘code-words.’ 1508 Reiner (1995), pp. 27-28. 1509 P2, f. 99-99v. 1510 M, f. 248v-251v. 1511 With the exception of Pisces."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" 339 Similar passages appear in the 16th century Raziel,1512 but the 24 herbs and plants in the latter do not match the 12 in the Hygromanteia.

However the Planetary herbs in chapter 18 appear in many more manuscripts of the Hygromanteia,1519 unlike the zodiacal herbs chapter which appears only once. This is in line with the thinking that one can invoke planetary forces but not those of the zodiac (which are merely the backdrop to the movement of the planets). The most interesting of these herbal formulae is a method for expelling the demon Onoskelis. He is the fourth demon mentioned in the 1st/2nd century Testament of Solomon, and it is therefore possibly a very old formula: If someone is tormented by the demon named Onoskelis, take some of the root and the seed [of daffodil, the herb of Saturn in this version], wrap it in donkey’s skin, and hang it on his neck. She [Onoskelis] will not harm him.1520   1512 See Karr & Skinner (2011), pp. 74-80 and 168-174, being transcriptions of Sloane MS 3826, ff. 16-20. 1513 See Best (1973). 1514 This would of course be the Egyptian month, rather than the zodiacal sign. 1515 Monacensis MS Gr. 70. 1516 Hygromanteia B2.

A completely different set of planetary herbal correspondences is to be found in N, f. 387v. 1520 H, f. 50v. A sidelight on this procedure is that the demon Onoskelis is “a beautiful demon with the legs of a mule” which gives a rationale to the use of a donkey’s skin in the charm hung on the neck. In PGM the ass is symbolic of Set/Typhon, and so it might be fruitful to look for some ancient connection between these two."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" 340 The version of planetary plants found in P2 is a full set, but interleaved with the prayers of the planets (normally found in chapter 3 of the Hygromanteia).1521 This version has much ‘Book of Secrets’ type material included with the planetary herbs. P2 completes what was begun in H, and lists all seven planets. Latin grimoires had even more complicated procedures for uprooting magical herbs. This was especially true for the mandrake. Typically this would have had the earth around it loosened before attaching it to the tail of a dog, which was then encouraged with offers of food to pull up the mandrake. The theory was that any bad luck generated by this act would rebound on the dog not the magician. It was thought that such a procedure might even kill the dog. Planetary herbal correspondences became an important part of Latin herbaria and tables of magical correspondences, such as those found in Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia.   1521 Plus a paragraph of general instructions and the short version of chapter 13, about the angels and demons of the planets.

Specific Magical Techniques and Objectives 7.1 Obtaining a Paredros (F) A paredros (\u001e!\u0003\f'\u0003\t\u0007) is a magical servant.1522 To acquire an assistant demon and then to use his advice to bind other demons was a well-established magical technique. It is attested in the 1st/2nd century Testament of Solomon and in a number of grimoires up to and including the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh (1700) where an “Operation of Simon Magus” mentions that: This Operation has been learnt from a certain demon who placed herself at the service of the writer (so it was written), and taught him this process, which is true.1523 Later in Europe this evolved into the idea of spirits who attached themselves to the magician as his familiars. The theory is that, in many ways, the acquisition of a familiar spirit is the most important part of a magician’s initial development, as they give him direct help from the spiritual world and advice on how to deal with other spiritual creatures. A rite designed to provide a spirit servant is to be found in one of the most interesting sections of the PGM which is rather ambiguously titled in English “Apollonius of Tyana’s old serving woman.” A more descriptive translation might have been “Apollonius of Tyana’s [method for securing a spirit] servant [in the form of] an old woman.”1524 The method involves invoking the goddess Nephthys, who manifests first as a beautiful woman then as an old serving woman. When Nephthys attempts to depart, the magician must restrain her and reply “No, lady! I will use you until I get her.”1525 The goddess then binds the old woman spirit servant to the service of the magician, by giving a tooth from an ass, and one from the old woman, to the magician, who then has complete control over this spirit servant. A more sinister magical assistant is offered by King Pitys, in two separate rites.1526 In the first rite this assistant turns out to be the soul of a dead man (who has died a violent death). In the second rite the assistant is simply described as a chthonic daimon. In both cases a skull cup is used, and in the second case the skin of an ass is also used, indicating the Typhon/Seth nature of the ritual. The second rite is the more complex and requires three writing surfaces: i) The hide of an ass inscribed with an ink made of the heart blood of an ass which has   1522 The derivation of \u001e!\u0003\fZ'\u0003\t\u0007 is from para, ‘near,’ and hedros, ‘sided.’ 1523 SMS, f. 56a-56b. 1524 PGM XI.a 1-40. 1525 PGM XI. a 20. 1526 PGM IV. 1928-2005 and 2006-2125."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 342 been sacrificed, mixed with coppersmiths’ soot. The figure drawn also incorporates the qualities of Chnoubis: ...a lion-faced form of man wearing a sash, holding in his right hand a staff, and on it let there be [drawn] a serpent. And around all his left hand let an asp be entwined, from the mouth of the lion let fire breath forth. ii) On a leaf of flax, using an ink made of falcon’s blood mixed with goldsmiths’ soot, is drawn: Hekate with three heads and six hands, holding torches in her hands, on the right sides of her face having the head of a cow; and on the left sides the head of a dog; and in the middle the head of a maiden with sandals bound on her feet. iii) On a piece of papyrus, with ink made from eel’s blood mixed with acacia [ashes] is drawn as the figure of Osiris “clothed as the Egyptians show him.” The whole rite therefore involves three gods of the Underworld: one Gnostic, one Greek and one Egyptian. As the Egyptian gods are spoken about in the third person, the rite has probably been assembled by a Greek magician. The rite was allegedly sent from King Pitys to Ostanes. One Ostanes was mentioned by Hermodorus, a disciple of Plato. Another Ostanes accompanied Xerxes on his expedition to Greece, where he reputedly taught Demokritos magic. Pliny identified that Ostanes with the Persian magi, but also suggested that this Ostanes dealt in magic and necromancy, making him a much more likely candidate. His fame survived through the Byzantine period, mainly in connection with alchemy, and Ostanes’ name was often associated with magic right up till the Middle Ages. There appears to be no paredros rite in the Hygromanteia, but the concept of an assistant demon is unlikely to have been absent from the objectives of Byzantine magicians. Several demons in the Goetia were listed as “giving good familiars,” so the concept of the familiar remained alive in the Clavicula Salomonis, and later vernacular grimoires. This concept was definitely present amongst the Jewish community of eastern Europe, where Rabbi Loew’s golem might be considered a very concrete example. Witches were also notorious for having familiar imps. 7.2 Sending Visions and Dreams (V) Oneiropompeia or ‘dream sending’ was an art practised by Graeco-Egyptian magicians to insert ideas into the minds of a target sleeper. Often the dream would be structured round the appearance to the target sleeper of an image of their favourite god/goddess giving them advice, which would in fact be derived from the instructions of the magician or his client."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 343 Obviously dream sending remained a popular technique from Graeco-Egyptian right up to the 16th century, and beyond. Not only did the technique remain popular but the exact same procedure, calling upon the same Egyptian god survived over the same time period. This request for a dream oracle utilises a drawing of the Dynastic Egyptian god Bes made with a specially prepared ink: Request for a dream oracle from Besas: Take red ochre [and the blood] of a white dove, likewise of a crow, also sap of the mulberry, juice of single-stemmed wormwood, cinnabar, and rainwater; blend all together, put aside and write with it and with black writing ink, and recite the formula to the lamp at evening.1527 Take a black [cloth] of Isis and put it around your hand. When you are almost awake the god will come and speak to you, and he will not go away unless you wipe off your hand with spikenard or something of roses and smear the picture with the black [cloth] of Isis. But the strip of cloth put around your neck,1528 so that he will not smite you. “I conjure you, daimon, by your two names1529 ANOUTH ANOUTH.1530 You are the headless god, the one who has a head and his face on his feet, dim-sighted Besas. We are not ignorant. You are the one whose mouth [continually] burns. I conjure [you by] your two names ANOUTH ANOUTH M... ORA PHĒSARA Ē... Come, lord, reveal to me concerning the NN matter, without deceit, without treachery, immediately, immediately; quickly, quickly...”1531 More than 1300 years later, almost exactly the same PGM spell appears in a 16th century manuscript in the British Library: Make a drawing of Besa (Bes) on your left hand, and envelop your hand in a strip of black cloth that has been consecrated to Isis, and lie down to sleep without speaking a word, even to answer a question. Wind the remainder of the cloth round your neck. The ink with which you write must be composed of the blood of a cow, the blood of a white dove (fresh), frankincense, myrrh, black ink, cinnabar, mulberry juice, rain water, and the juices of wormwood and vetch.1532 With this write your petition before the setting sun (saying), “Send the truthful seer out of the holy shrine, I beseech thee, Lampsuer, Sumarta, Baribas, Dardalam, Iorlex. O Lord send the sacred deity Anuth Anuth, Salbana, Chambré, Breïth, now, now, quickly, quickly. Come in this very night.”1533 This extraordinary survival is more than just the retention of a method. It is almost a word-for-word copy, allowing for a little bit of variation between the two different translations from the Greek. In fact, the 16th century translation is, in some places, more detailed than the modern translation of the Graeco-Egyptian text.1534 For example, the modern translation by Grese says “Take a black of Isis” whilst the 16th century translation supplies the missing   1527 This procedure appears to also incorporate a lamp skrying. 1528 The cloth is used as a phylactery. 1529 Should read ‘by your dual name.’ 1530 Although Anouth appears here to be a name for the Headless God, the usual scholarly interpretation equates it with Osiris. 1531 PGM VII. 222-249. 1532 The blood of a cow, and of a white dove, frankincense, myrrh, cinnabar and sun vetch all appear as incenses in PGM. 1533 16th century BL Sloane manuscript quoted by Thompson (1973), p. 57. 1534 Hutton raises the question as to whether this was composed by a 16th century magician or if it was a survival of a specific text (Hutton (2003), p. 186. The first quotation above confirms that indeed it was a survival from a specific papyrus."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" 344 noun: “a strip of black cloth that has been consecrated to Isis.” The PGM versions mentions “smear the picture” but does not say what picture that is. The 16th century text supplies that deficiency with “Make a drawing of Besa on your left hand,” a crucial detail left out of the PGM text. A chunk of the invocation is missing from the 16th century text, but on the other hand key nomina magica are missing from the PGM, but supplied by the 16th century text. It can only be conjectured that both versions come from an older more complete text. One wonders how many other PGM formulae were available in 16th century Europe, long before the present magical papyri were recovered by Anastasi in Thebes, or translated by modern scholars. 7.3 Love Spells (L) Many examples of love spells use slander in order to stir up the god/goddess into action,1535 the magician being all the while careful not to attract the goddesses’ wrath onto his own head: For I come announcing the slander of NN [the love object of the spell], a defiled and unholy woman, for she has slanderously brought your holy mysteries to the knowledge of men. She, NN, is the one, [not] I, who says, ‘I have seen the greatest goddess, after leaving the heavenly vault, on earth without sandals, sword in hand, and [speaking] a foul name.’ It is she, NN, who said, ‘I saw [the goddess] drinking blood.’ She, NN, said it, not I...1536 The slander spell1537 is unique to Graeco-Egyptian sources, and did not migrate to either the Hygromanteia or to later Solomonic grimoires. Perhaps as a procedure it was considered far too risky. In fact the magician is instructed specifically “Do not therefore perform the rite rashly, and do not perform it unless some dire necessity arises for you.”1538 The instructions of ‘love’ spells are often explicitly sexual rather than loving, for example: Let her be in love with me, NN whom she, NN bore. Let her not be had in a promiscuous way, let her not be had in her ass, nor let her do anything with another man for pleasure, just with me alone...1539 and do not allow her, NN, to accept for pleasure the attempt of another man, not even that of her own husband, just that of mine...1540 Most of the love spells are small and fragmentary, but a few are given in much more detail. The essence of one such rite is the drowning (and therefore deification),1541 of very specific type of scarab. A scarab of Mars is used in another method.1542   1535 Slander spells are more often used with a goddess than with a god. 1536 PGM IV. 2475-2481. 1537 Diabole. 1538 PGM IV. 2505. 1539 PGM IV. 350-354. 1540 PGM IV. 374-376. 1541 A field mouse is deified by drowning it in spring water, and two ‘moon beetles’ in river water, in PGM IV. 2456-2457. 1542 PDM xiv. 636-669, especially 636-637."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" 345 An interesting turn of events, at the end of one spell is the procedure for getting rid of the lover when she is no longer wanted: If, however, you should wish her to stop [desiring you], take a sun scarab and place it in the middle of her head and say to it: ”Gulp down my love charm, image of Helios; he himself orders you to do so.” And pick up the scarab and release it alive. Then take the ring and give it to her to wear, and immediately she will depart.1543 Iron in later periods was considered to be anathema to spirits. So much so, that (with one dubious exception) none of the metallic sigils of the 72 spirits of the Goetia were made of iron.1544 Conjurations for specific purposes begin with chapter 38 of the Hygromanteia. The first of these is a conjuration for love. This is an example of a specific order to the spirits, in this case to bring the beloved to the magician. The approach is much gentler than procedures using one of the dead (as in the case of PGM defixiones) to torture the object of desire till she comes, but it is still one of command rather than seduction. The usual formula stipulates pain and denial of sleep, drink and food to the woman desired, till she submits: Make her love me deeply, deeply, deeply, nor ever forget me, so that she will not be able to eat, drink, sleep, nor have any other comfort, until I wish it so. Let her be submitted to my appetite and desire.”1545 More rarely, in another version, the target of desire is a man. The demons are ordered to: ...go quickly to such and such a person, take possession of his heart and turn his thoughts and mind to me, so and so. Let him not think of anybody else in the world, either his father, his mother, or anybody else, a woman or a man...1546 Both conjurations are replete with historiola, quoting instances of god’s power from the Old Testament: I conjure you by the power of God who divided the Red Sea by means of a rod when Moses ordered it so.1547 Love spells occur in almost all the later grimoires, but usually as one of the separate ‘experiments.’ These ‘experiments’ are sometimes later additions, often occurring towards the end of a manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis. 7.4 Invisibility (I) Invisibility is one boon that has been asked of magic in every time and place by magicians from King Gyges1548 to Aleister Crowley.   1543 PDM lxi. 175-180 aka PGM LXI. 33-37. 1544 In another culture, Sikhs wear an iron kura to protect themselves from spirits (although the modern explanation has re-designated the real purpose into something more acceptable.) 1545 H, f. 29v. 1546 B, ff. 25-26. 1547 B, f. 25. 1548 See Marathakis (2007) for a detailed survey of those invisibility spells."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 346 One rite specifies an ointment with which to smear oneself when asking Helios for invisibility. Presumably the logic of this request is that as Helios is responsible for making everything visible, so it is within his power to deny this favour, and make something invisible: Indispensable invisibility spell: Take fat or an eye of a nightowl and a ball of dung rolled by a beetle1549 and oil of an unripe olive and grind them all together until smooth, and smear your whole body with it and say to Helios...”Make me invisible, lord Helios...in the presence of any man until sunset...”1550 A few lines further on, another invisibility ointment is recommended: Take an eye of an ape or of a corpse that has died a violent death and a plant of peony (he means the rose). Rub these with oil of lily, and as you are rubbing them from the right to the left, say the spell... And if you wish to become invisible, rub just your face with the concoction, and you will be invisible for as long as you wish.1551 The operation of invisibility using a skull in chapter 59 of the Hygromanteia is not an operation typical of the Solomonic tradition, although it also survives in the Grimorium Verum,1552 and in a modified manner (using the skull of a manikin) in one Clavicula Salomonis. The operation relies on planting beans or bean seeds in the orifices of a skull. After a suitable interval, and suitable invocations, these beans grant invisibility to the person who carries them. The similar operation in the Grimorium Verum states that the magician has to actually put the previously buried bean in his mouth for it to confer invisibility. It is interesting that beans are prescribed, and this may be a backwards nod to the PGM rites which required certain actions in a bean field, or to Pythagoras who forbade his disciples from eating beans, for reasons related to the Underworld. In manuscript H this operation of invisibility occurs before the actual incipit, and so it is highly likely to have been a later addition to an otherwise blank early folio, and therefore it has not always been a part of the Hygromanteia. This operation of invisibility is listed as a separate ‘experiment’ in the many versions of the Key of Solomon. As with other Key of Solomon operations it is necessary to work from within a protective circle. After general conjurations, the spirit Almiras, who is styled the ‘Chief of Invisibility,’ is conjured. The operation1553 requires a small yellow wax manikin, upon whose skull a special figure is engraved, rather like the procedure used by Rabbi Lowe of Prague to make the golem. The skin of a frog or toad is added, with further characters, and with due censing and invocation it is suspended at midnight from the vault of a cavern. The manikin   1549 The beetle Kheperi symbolises the setting sun. The night owl confers darkness, and the eye obviously connects to visibility. So the ingredients of the ointment are not just random, but follow an internal logic, a physical paste corresponding to the nature of the request to the lord of the dark Sun. 1550 PGM I. 222-231. 1551 PGM I. 247-262. 1552 Peterson (2007), pp. 48-49. 1553 In Lansdowne MS 1203."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 347 is then buried in the floor of the cave to be exhumed whenever the magician wishes to be invisible. 1554 7.5 Sacrifice Sacrifice is part of the compact made between the magician and a spiritual creature. The idea of making a pact which required the magician’s soul as part of the bargain is not found in any of the texts here examined, but seems to be solely part of the fictional Faust tradition. However there is often reference made to offerings made to the spirits, usually in the form of incense, sometimes as food, and less commonly in the form of a sacrificed animal. Solomon was famous for the quantity of oxen and other animals he sacrificed for Yahweh at the inauguration of his Temple. Sacrifice was also an integral part of Second Temple Jewish religion, as well as in Graeco-Egyptian magic. Although Jewish sacrifice on a large scale ceased with the destruction of Herod’s Temple in 70 CE, examples of sacrifice (especially of doves) persist in Jewish magical texts like the Sepher Raziel ha-Malekh.1555 In one of King Pitys’ necromantic rites, a sacrifice is offered to a spiritual creature (in this case a daimon) as a ‘payment’ for a successful conclusion of the unnamed objective of the rite:1556 Fulfil, daimon, what is written here. And after you have performed it, I will pay you a sacrifice. But if you delay, I will inflict on you chastisements which you cannot endure. Sacrifice is therefore distinctly a form of bribery. Sacrifice is specifically instructed in a general purpose rite, but the first application, for which sacrifice is recommended, is to attract a lover: After saying these things, sacrifice. Then raise loud groans and then go backwards as you descend. And she will come at once. But pay attention to the one being attracted so that you may open the door for her; otherwise the spell will fail.1557 The Classical Greeks offered sacrifice to the chthonic gods, via a pit in the earth, usually accompanied by libations of wine and blood poured into the pit. Similar procedures are also to be found in the PGM, in this case to aid in the consecration of a magic ring: Making a pit in a holy place open to the sky, [or] if [you have none] in a clean, sanctified tomb looking towards the east, and making over the pit an altar of wood from fruit trees, sacrifice an unblemished goose, and 3 roosters and 3 pigeons. Make these whole burnt offerings and burn, with the birds, all sorts of incense. Then, standing by the pit, look to the east and, pouring on a libation of wine, honey, milk, [and] saffron, and holding over the smoke, while you pray, [the ring or stone] in which are engraved the inscriptions...1558 Sacrifice also has its place in the consecration of an iron lamella: Go, I say, into a clean room. Set up a table, on which you are to place a clean linen cloth and flowers of the season. Then sacrifice a white cock, placing beside it 7 cakes, 7 wafers, 7 lamps;   1554 Mathers (1909), p. 52. 1555 Translation in Savedow (2000). 1556 King Bitys/Pitys was reputed to be a Thessalian magician, Thessaly being famous for its magic. 1557 PGM IV. 2491. 1558 PGM XII. 201-269."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 348 pour a libation of milk, honey, wine, and olive oil.1559 A more detailed account of a sacrifice is to be found in an auto-initiation rite: Keep yourself pure for seven days beforehand. On the third of the month, go to a place from which the Nile has recently receded, before anyone walks on the area that was flooded – or at any rate, to a place that has been inundated by the Nile. On two bricks standing on their sides, build a fire with olive wood...when half the sun is above the horizon; but before the sun [fully] appears, dig a trench around the altar. When the disk of the sun is fully above the horizon, cut off the head of an unblemished, solid white cock... Throw the head into the river and drink up the blood, draining it off into your right hand and putting what’s left of the body on the burning altar.1560 Sacrifice also appears amongst the compulsive formulae designed to force a god or spirit to manifest if they have been dilatory: Take a completely white cock and a pinecone; pour wine upon it, anoint yourself and remain praying until the sacrifice is extinguished. Then rub yourself all over with the following mixture: laurel bayberries, Ethiopian cumin, nightshade, and “Hermes’ finger.”1561 The white cock (but not the pinecones) survives as a magician’s sacrifice right through to the late European grimoires.1562 Only two manuscripts of the Hygromanteia1563 contain explicit instructions for taking blood from a bat, swallow or dove, while five suggest taking it from an ox or a sheep.1564 In each case the animal is sacrificed in order to drain its blood. In one case (H) the ox is cut with the knife of the art but not killed. The manufacture of the consecrated parchment also involves slaughtering the lamb or calf, but this could also be considered a sacrifice to the spirits. A number of manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis mention sacrifice, and some also link it with the offering of food to the spirits (a practice that dates back to the PGM). Two copies of this text were confiscated and used as evidence in the Inquisitorial trial of Laura Malipiero in Venice in 1654. One of these provides us with the following details: About sacrifice for spirits and how to sacrifice. Last chapter. In many [magical] arts at times one must make sacrifices to demons, and these are of different kinds. At times for good spirits white animals are sacrificed, and black ones for bad spirits. Sometimes the sacrifice is only of their blood and sometimes of parts to eat.1565 Those who wish to sacrifice animals of whatever sort must take virgin animals because the spirits will accept this sacrifices [sic] willingly, and for this reason obey the sacrificers more willingly. So when you sacrifice with blood, let the beasts or birds you take the blood from be virginal since the purer the thing is the more effective they are and before purging, over the sacrifice, let the following words be said...

But nigromancy is usually glossed as ‘the black art’ or ‘black magic.’ How can this be as ‘nigro-’ simply means ‘black’ so logically ‘nigromancy’ should mean something like ‘black divination,’ but it doesn’t. Elsewhere in this thesis I have made the case for broadening the definition of ‘-manteia’ to mean a magical procedure, rather than just a divination. If this is not the case, then how can the conflation of nigromancy and necromancy have occurred if only one was a method of divination and the other a method of magic? Robert Ritner discusses the (mis)use of ‘necromancy’ to mean a magical operation rather than its original Greek meaning of divination by questioning the dead.1569 According to the OED the use of ‘necromancy’ to mean any kind of magical operation only came to full fruition in about 1550,1570 but I believe this occurred at least as early as the 14th century. A unique Jewish interpretation of the meaning of ‘nigromancy’ is voiced by Menahem Ziyuni: ‘Nigromancia’ is a combination of two words, nigar [Hebrew], ‘gathered together, collected,’ like water that has been stored up, and mancia, the name of the incense that magicians burn to [attract] the demons.1571 The Hebrew meaning of nigar is closer to “to draw in or invoke.” The most interesting part of this definition is the equation of mancia, and hence presumably of \u0004\u0002\u0013\u000b\f\u0006\u0002, with a specific incense used in evocation. However this seems to be an isolated usage and does not seem to advance the argument. Dating from before the questioning of Samuel by King Saul (mediated by the witch of Endor) there has always been a Jewish tradition of necromancy. In the Talmud it says: There are two kinds of necromancy (bva lob, Baal Aib [Aub]), the one where the dead is raised by naming him, the other where he is asked by means of a skull (tlglgb la`nh).1572 An actual skull illustrates this practice in the Talmud, and there is no doubt that this practice was to be found described in Hebrew texts. The first kind of necromancy has survived through to the modern era, but is not specifically part of the Solomonic tradition.1573 The second type where a head, or skull, has been kept as a sort of oracle to answer questions also has a long but separate history. The most famous   1568 We have cause to question this rather simplistic translation when considering the techniques found in the Hygromanteia. 1569 Ritner (2008), pp. 236-249; Ciraolo and Seidel (2002), p. 96. 1570 OED, Vol. VII, p. 67. 1571 Quoted in Trachtenberg (2004), p. 22. 1572 Sanhedrin, 65b. 1573 See the famous engraving of Edward Kelley and Paul Waring questioning the ghost of a woman besides a newly opened grave.

Other words on the skull make it clear that it is an address to this spirit.1576 The Sabians of Harran were also reputed to use “speaking skulls” for oracular purposes1577 and in Roman times Lucius Apuleius mentioned the use of skulls in magic in his Apology. Classical Greek references to the use of the dead in magic, such as the re-animation of corpses by Erichtho in the Pharsalia1578 have very little in common with Graeco-Egyptian magic, and even less in common with later Solomonic magic. The use of mortuary remains in magic also leads on to the use of defixiones, which attempt to compel the aid of the dead in a magical operation. Defixiones are a common part of Graeco-Egyptian magic, and are treated separately in chapter 5.4.3. The shortest necromantic spell for questioning corpses in the PGM is credited to King Pitys the Thessalian. A flax leaf1579 has AZĒL BALEMACHŌ written on it, and no invocation is mentioned, but the writing must be done with a special ink.1580 Another spell, although captioned as a “Spell of Attraction of King Pitys” is obviously an example of necromancy, for the caption continues with “over any skull cup.”1581 The operation requires the skull of a dead man who died prematurely or violently. Surprisingly the invocation is not addressed to one of the chthonic gods, but to Helios himself, and his “holy angels on this day, in this very hour.”1582 Here Helios is addressed as a supreme god, rather than as god of the Sun. One strange facet is the use of the word ‘tent’ to describe the dead man’s grave.1583 A second version of King Pitys’ necromantic spell continues a few lines before.1584   1574 Even in more modern times the skulls of famous men, especially magicians and mystics, have become collectors’ items.

[But] having drawn the sharp sword at my thigh, [I sat,] allowing not the flitting heads Of the dead to draw nearer to [the blood]1589 Here there are two magical techniques explicitly mentioned. The first is the shedding of blood to attract the spirits, a procedure that carries right on through to the later Latin European grimoires. The second is the use of a sword to control the spirits and keep them at bay. Although it is contra-intuitive that a sharp sword should strike fear into a spirit that is already dead, it is a recurrent motive in both the Byzantine sources and the later Latin grimoires that a sharp sword, specifically made of iron, is an effective threat to spirits, as if they supposedly fear being cut. Another spell for restraining a divinatory skull that has got out of hand is to be found in the PGM. It demonstrates the continuing use of necromantic skulls that answer questions: A restraining seal for skulls that are not satisfactory [for use in divination], and also to prevent [them] from speaking or doing anything whatever of this [sort]: Seal the mouth of the skull with dirt from the doors of [a temple] of Osiris and from a mound [covering] graves. Taking iron1590 from a leg fetter, work it cold and make a ring on which a headless lion [is] engraved. Let him [the lion] have, instead of his head, a crown of Isis, and let him trample with his feet a skeleton (the right foot should trample the skull of the skeleton). In the middle of these [images] should be an owl-eyed cat with its paw on a gorgon’s head; in a circle around [all of them?], these names: IADŌR INBA NICHAIOPLĒX BRITH.1591 The visual threat of the skull being crushed by the Headless One plus the iron fetter and a mouth full of sacred dirt should presumably restrain any wayward skull.

Necromancy is not a typical Solomonic operation but appears to belong more to the tradition that includes grimoires like the Grimorium Verum and the hoodoo grimoires,1592 with their rather grisly ingredients. However, chapter 58 of the Hygromanteia does deal with nekromanteia, and the chapter 59 dealing with invisibility also utilises a skull.1593 It gives the method of making an oracular head out of a dead man’s skull. The theory being that the ghost of the skull’s previous owner will, because of the binding evocation, become the familiar of the magician. The scribe of this particular manuscript, a physician called Iōannēs Aron, was cautious about who might read the manuscript, so he encoded the Greek words for “the ghost of a familiar,” “dead man’s skull,” “on the skull’s face” and other key phrases, which might have caused him trouble if the manuscript had fallen into the wrong hands. One version of Basin skrying1594 includes a mirror and a lamb bone. This rite is directed towards the spirit of a dead person and therefore partakes of necromancy, even though the manuscript cautiously labels it “concerning basin divination.” Several manuscripts1595 attribute this particular operation to Hēliodōros, the 5th century astrologer to the Emperor Valens, which helps give a 5th century terminus a quo for the Hygromanteia. 7.7 Treasure Finding Before there was a regular and reliable banking system, it was common for people to bury their wealth in times of unrest, hoping to come back at a later date to retrieve it.1596 Consequently looking for buried treasure, often with the assistance of spirits (who were assumed to know the details of such hoards) was a viable magical objective. There appears to be, however, no trace of it in the PGM. Although not specifically to be found in the PGM, treasure seeking by magic was practised in that period. In a mocking speech directed against a goēs (\b\r\u0007) Libanius says:1597   1592 Hoodoo is a set of practices that include African-American voodoo practices which utilise grave dust, skulls, etc, the iconography of Christian saints, European folk magic and also methods from a series of rather debased European grimoires (especially the Faustbooks) like the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses or Moses’ Magical Sprit-Aid. It evolved in the Mississippi delta area and after the 1930s spread throughout the States. See Peterson (2008) and Hohman (2012). 1593 The version in B2 is the most explicit. 1594 G, f. 28v. 1595 P and M2. 1596 Even in modern times, many of the pro-Tsarist population leaving Russia after 1917 buried their wealth, hoping to come back for it in more peaceful times. Most did not return. 1597 Libanius (314-394) was a pagan Greek orator from Antioch."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":" 354 Why has your craft [magic] not opened up for you all the treasuries and why has it not joined everything which currently lies buried in the earth to your estate?1598 This confirms that during the 4th century, in Antioch, the ability to use magic to retrieve treasure buried in the earth was commonly thought to be part of the techniques used by magicians. Treasure finding is one of the uses to which spirits were put in chapter 39 of the Hygromanteia. Two versions (B and H) utilise the services of the four archangels, and the Cherubim and Seraphim to encourage the demons to locate a buried hoard. Version B adds the backing of the four Demon Kings to force the spirits to bring the treasure to the magician. The magician specifies what kind of treasure he wants, being very careful not to be later tricked by the spirits with imaginary gold, or treasure that later disappears: Then, go again for a second time <and bring> beautiful gold that is favored by people, not imaginary, not illusionary or made by any evil device, <but that is> true and most pure, without any deceit or fraud. Let you have no authority to take it back from me, but let it remain with me, firmly, strongly and securely.1599 The Key of Solomon has an interesting procedure for finding buried treasure. The text asserts that gnomes have extensive knowledge of the whereabouts of buried treasure. The procedure is therefore to become on good terms with such spirits so that they may reveal to the magician the location of some of the treasures which they otherwise jealously guard. Two days are singled out for this operation: 10th July and 20th August, when the Moon is in Leo. Again a Circle drawn with the magical sword is a required precaution. Rather bizarrely, the excavation is to take place inside the actual circle of protection, after the location has been determined by cross-examination of the spirits, as is shown in the illustration.1600 The magician and his assistants are to be fortified with a ...girdle [made] of the skin of a goat newly slain, whereon shall be written with the blood of the dead man from whom thou shalt have taken the fat these words and characters...1601 The scene is to be lit by a “lamp, whose oil should be mingled with the fat of a man who has died in the month of July, and the wick being made from the cloth wherein he has been buried.”1602   1598 Libanius (c.314-393 CE) Declamatio 41. 1599 B, f. 26v. 1600 Mathers (1909), pp. 57-58. 1601 Mathers (1909), p. 58. 1602 Ibid, p. 58."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" 355 Figure 59: Magicians attempting to take possession of a treasure possessed by spirits, simultaneously dealing with excavation and evocation inside the same circle.1603 Note that engraving is almost an epitome of a magical operation, conducted from within the confines of a protective circle. The senior conjuror reads aloud from a volume which is certain to be a grimoire and holds a sword with which to threaten the demon. His assistants hold the lamp and dig for the treasure. The demon has bird claws, and is attempting to break through the protective circle (his claws already overlap it). In the 16th century, Dr John Dee applied to Queen Elizabeth I for a royal warrant to secure any treasure trove he might discover with the assistance of the spirits, in a time when such exploits were otherwise illegal. As buried treasure was automatically claimed by the crown, it is not surprising that she did not issue the warrant. The use of spirits to find buried treasure was very common in later French grimoires such as the Grand Grimoire, which actually illustrates its protective circle with an exit route labelled as the “Route du T[resor].”   1603 Caricature engraving by Hans Weiditz the Younger (1495-c.1537), circa 1520, of a magician and his assistants attempting to raise a spirit-protected treasure."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 356 Figure 60: The ‘Route du Tresor’ from the Grand Grimoire shows the access point for the spirit to deliver the buried treasure.1604 ‘Le Kersi’ is the master karcist (the magician), and his two friends (Les Ami[s]).

This grimoire has obviously passed through the hands of a number of redactors, and become somewhat confused, as it shows the magicians located in the triangle rather than the spirit, and the triangle drawn within the circle rather than outside. Another 14th century grimoire shows a drawing of a magician wielding a sword whilst an overburdened spirit brings golden vessels to the edge of a circle and an idle monk looks on.1605 See Figure 18. It is not clear how spirits were expected to actually carry physical treasure, so later grimoires sometimes just settle for using the spirits to find the location of the treasure, after which the magician and his assistants dig it up themselves. Hans Weiditz the Younger (the Petrarch Master)1606 engraved such a scene with a sense of humour circa 1520. His engraving portrays the arrival of a spirit outside the circle, whilst the pick and shovel wielding assistants stand inside the circle with the master reading the evocation by candle-light (see Figure 59).

Although this story has become part of the Solomonic tradition, surprisingly there are few references to it in the Solomonic grimoires, and none at all in the PGM. It is possible that the idea of imprisoning a spirit in a metal bottle comes from Arabian sources, especially as the bottle occurs in Arabian folktales. Chapter 44 of the Hygromanteia deals with the technique of spirit imprisonment in a bottle (gasteromanteia). Although it might seem obvious to translate \b\u0002\u0014\u000b\f\u0003\t\u0004\u0002\u0013\u000b\f\u0006\u0002, gasteromanteia as “bottle divination,”1609 nothing that could be construed as divination occurs during this procedure. In fact, it is the straightforward magical procedure of imprisoning a spirit in a bottle, a procedure straight out of the Arabian Nights. The action of imprisoning cannot be one of divination, hence -manteia must have, at least in Byzantium, had a wider meaning. At no time is the spirit cross-examined with divinatory intent. It is therefore obvious that in this context –manteia does not mean divination. How are we to explain this? It seems unlikely that the author of the Hygromanteia who was writing in Greek and obviously very well informed about both magic and divination, would have repeatedly made such a mistake. The unavoidable conclusion is that –manteia had a wider meaning which embraces ‘magical procedure.’1610 The use of the bottle capture of a demon varies from one text to another but the method is roughly the same. Version H uses the bottle as a receptacle for an evicted demon after a successful exorcism, rather than for example, sending the demon(s) into a herd of pigs. Technically, the spirit dislodgement part of the procedure should be referred to as an exorcism. The exorcistic nature of this operation is reinforced by the apparent need for the boy to wear a phylactery,1611 to prevent the spirit from entering him before the magician has managed to get it into the bottle. After its capture the bottle is sealed with wax and a small   1608 Versions of this story and the details of the invocation in front of the king are to be found in: Folger MS Vb. 26; Wellcome MS 3203; and Rylands GB 0133 Eng MS 40. 1609 [\u0002\u0014\u000b\u0011\u0003 can mean womb or the wide part of a bottle. 1610 Scott & Liddell do not offer such a meaning. However, all dictionaries, even the best, are compiled by accumulating instances of a word’s usage in literature, it would appear that this particular fairly obscure instance of usage has not been taken cognisance of by the dictionary makers. 1611 See H, f. 37v for a drawing of this phylactery. Version A simply says the magician must wear a pentagram."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" 358 parchment pentagram.1612 Versions A and P2 use this method to imprison spirits which have been set to guard buried treasure desired by the magician. In some cases this spirit might even be the spirit of a dead person deliberately set to haunt the treasure. Solomon reputedly used the technique to imprison 72 demons after he had completed building his Temple in Jerusalem. In Arabic texts,1613 the bottle is usually made of metal, but here it seems likely the bottle in the Hygromanteia is made of glass, as the boy skryer is asked to say when he sees the spirit in the bottle. In manuscript A the spirit is likened to a wind, which probably comes from the dual meaning of ruach in Hebrew which means both wind and spirit. If the procedure partly fails and the spirit does not voluntarily go into the bottle, he is asked to mark the place of the treasure, or at least vouchsafe the location to the magician in a dream.1614 The incenses burned whilst performing this rite were clove, musk and galbanum.1615 The presence of a boy as a skryer is simply there to report to the magician immediately he sees the spirit actually in the bottle, so the magician can seal it with wax, upon which he engraves a seal to prevent the spirit escaping. The seal is likely to have originally been the Secret Seal of Solomon, but this has been somewhat corrupted in the Hygromanteia.1616 Later Latin grimoires are silent when it comes to the imprisoning of spirits in bottles. In his version of the Goetia, Thomas Rudd in the mid-17th century reintroduces this procedure by creating a metal ‘bottle’ designed to imprison or threaten the spirits. The function of this has already been discussed in chapter 5.3.2. See Figure 32.   1612 Traditionally it should be sealed with the Secret Seal of Solomon. See Figure 42. 1613 Such as that of al-Buni. 1614 “There is a tradition that the goddess Bhagavati, who is worshipped at Kodungallur in Malabar, was rescued by a fisherman when she was shut up in a jar, and thrown into the sea by a great magician. The Lingadars of the Kistna district are said to have made a speciality of bottling evil spirits, and casting the bottles away in some place where no one is likely to come across them, and [accidentally] liberate them.” – Thurston (1912), p. 250. 1615 Frankincense was added in manuscript A. 1616 See Figure 42."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":" 359 8. The ‘manteiai’ or Evocatory Skrying Methods The manteiai are to be found in chapters 47 to 58 of the Hygromanteia: i) 47 Epibaktromanteia water pot skrying 48 Lekanomanteia bottle skrying 49-51 Hygromanteia I-III three different methods of skrying with water 52 Hygromanteia IV skrying with basin, copper kettle and glass 53 Chalkomanteia copper bowl skrying ii) 54 Katoptromanteia mirror skrying 55 Krystallomanteia crystal skrying 56 Ōomanteia skrying with an egg 57 Onykhomanteia fingernail skrying iii) 58 Nekromanteia interrogation of the dead iv) -- Lychnomanteia lamp skrying (in the PGM but not in the Hygromanteia.) All of these are effectively evocatory skrying methods, using different pieces of equipment. In each case the magician evokes a spirit and a virgin child medium states what he or she hears or sees. It is this section of the Hygromanteia which at one stage mistakenly gave its name to the whole book. These skrying methods effectively divide into four groups. i) The first group (covering chapters 47 – 53) are effectively all water/oil skrying methods, even though only four are specifically named as such. These all derive from the PGM, as confirmed by the remark made in the PGM at the beginning of one bowl skrying procedure: Inquiry of bowl divination and necromancy: Whenever you want to inquire about matters, take a bronze vessel, either a bowl or a saucer, whatever kind you wish. Pour water [into it]... Holding the vessel on your knees, pour out green olive oil [onto the water], bend over the vessel and speak the prescribed spell. And address whatever god you want and ask about whatever you wish...1617 In the text they are all referred to as ‘vessel enquiry,’ usually translated in modern texts as ‘bowl divination.’ However the point of quoting this here is to show that the PGM subsumed under one heading (‘vessel enquiry’) what was later split out into seven different methods in the Hygromanteia as listed above. The first of these, epibaktromanteia, is defined as water-pot skrying. The word appears to be derived from \u001d!\u0005\u000b\u0003\t\u0013, meaning a stick or maybe a wand. I speculate that originally this might have been the instrument which accompanied the evocation.1618 The second is referred   1617 PGM IV. 221-232. This passage is actually abruptly inserted into a letter supposedly written by Nephōtēs to Psammetichos, so it comes highly recommended. 1618 Such a water pot and wand, significantly held by a figure identified as Solomon, occurs in Figure 35."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":" 360 to as lekanomanteia, and has the added dimension of “greasy soot” or ink as the focus of the skryer rather than just water. This use of soot or ink in the hand has endured as a skrying method in the Middle East and North Africa till the present time.1619 The four different types of hygromanteia follow, differing only in the degree of magical protection afforded the skryer, and in the vessel used, the fourth type having a complicated arrangement of copper basin, kettle and glass. The last, Chalkomanteia, simply using a copper bowl, is also seen in the PGM.1620 ii) The second group (chapter 54-57 in the Hygromanteia) consists of methods not found in the PGM, but which are found in 11th century Jewish sources, as already mentioned. These are not part of the transmission of methods from the PGM, or onwards to the Clavicula Salomonis. Skrying by mirror and crystal do appear in the Latin West, employed by Trithemius, Dee, Francis Barrett, Frederick Hockley, etc., but are found in other manuscripts, divorced from the purely Solomonic grimoire tradition.1621 An example of Krystallomanteia appears in the Lemegeton, in the context of evocation, but without mention of the boy skryer: ...you may call these spirits into a Crystall stone or Glass Receptacle, [this] being an Ancient & usuall way of Receiving & binding of spirits, This Cristall (sic) stone must be four Inches Diameter sett on a Table of Art ...w[hi]ch is truly called the secret Table of Solomon... 1622 The practices of oil and egg divination remained a Middle Eastern and Jewish tradition and can be found in the Babylonian Talmud (200 CE), indicating that their origins go back a long way in the Jewish tradition: One is allowed to ask of the princes of oil and the princes of eggs, only...they lie. One whispers a charm [incantation] over oil in the vessel...1623 The ‘princes’ referred to in this quote are the spirits/angels which were invoked prior to performing either of these divinations. It is not clear why it is said that they lie, unless this is simply meant as a condemnation of the veracity of their answers. Katoptromanteia is mentioned only in passing in PGM XIII. 752. iii) The third group contains only chapter 58, Nekromanteia. This practice is mentioned here because it falls into the evocatory skrying section of the Hygromanteia. In a sense it is simply another form of skrying using a skull, for example, rather than a bowl or a lamp. It has been dealt with at length in chapter 7.6. iv) The fourth group contains only Lychnomanteia, lamp skrying.

The procedure usually involves the calling of a god to give verbal answers to particular questions posed by the magician. Integral to the practice is the use of the virgin boy skryer, although sometimes the magician also asks for a direct vision of the god himself. The magician is instructed to put his hand, or finger, on the head of his skryer, or alternatively whisper the invocation directly “down into his head.” There are frequent references in the PGM to not using lamps coloured red, or more specifically tainted with red lead (prš).1642 Betz’s glossary suggests that this might apply to lamps coloured with red ochre (miltos). The reason apparently is to avoid the symbolism of Seth-Typhon.1643 Typical offerings to be made during this rite are frankincense and grape-vine wood1644 or myrrh and willow leaf.1645 The brazier should be placed upon a clay tablet (referred to as a ‘brick’) and the boy upon another. Interestingly, in one passage, the spirit being conjured is referred to as the “spirit that flies in the air, [and] called with secret codes.” The wick is conjured by the hand of Anubis and by the “blood of the Drowned One,” Osiris. According to the nature of the entity called, or of the question, so the wick and the oil are changed.1646 Other accoutrements occasionally used for lamp skrying include a wolf’s head on which the lamp is to be balanced.1647 An altar is sometimes used to give a surface on which to sacrifice to this particular god when he arrives. In that case the offering will consist of: ...a wolf’s eye, storax gum, cassia, balsam gum and whatever is valued among the spices, and pour a libation of wine and honey and milk and rainwater, [and make] 7 flat cakes and 7 round cakes.1648 One of the names conjured three times in various operations of lamp skrying is BOEL, who is described as “the first servant of the great god, he who gives light exceedingly, the companion of the flame.”1649 This name is repeatedly mentioned in a number of lamp skrying invocations, and seems to be integral to this method:   1642 Such lamps are mentioned in PGM I. 277, 293; II. 57; IV. 2373, 3191; VII. 542, 594; VIII. 87; XII. 27, 131; and LXII. 1. 1643 Red has a well known association with ‘demonic’ gods like Seth and Apophis. Red is the preferred ink colour for writing the names of demons or enemies. The avoidance of the colour in PGM is based on the same symbolism, especially in the case of divinatory lamps. 1644 PGM VII. 540-544. 1645 PDM xiv. 766. 1646 For a daimonic spirit, a wick of sailcloth and butter is used; to seduce a woman burn oil of roses; in other matters a clean wick and pure genuine oil, probably olive oil. For an Apollonian invocation use either rose oil or oil of spikenard. See PGM I. 279. 1647 PGM I. 282. 1648 PGM I. 285-289. 1649 PDM xiv. 195, 489-490."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":" 363 Bring in BOEL! Bring BOEL in! Bring BOEL in!

BEYTSI, O great god, bring BOEL in! Bring BOEL in! Bring BOEL IN! 1651 This same spirit name appears over a thousand years later in 1623, when a magician called Jean Michel Menuisier, who had learnt magic in Toledo, claimed that: During a visit to Vienna he had purchased a magic phial containing a spirit named Boël, which he consulted to know occult secrets and therefore help his clients.1652 One of the standard inducements offered to the daimones/spirits to perform in a lamp skrying is that the magician will praise them before the senior gods: I shall praise you in heaven before Pre;1653 I shall praise you before the moon; I shall praise you on earth; I shall praise you before the one who is on the throne...1654 One example of lamp skrying assumes that the evocation will cause the boy skryer to see the king of the spirits, who can then be cross examined by the magician, via the boy. This procedure is sometimes extended to making the king of the spirits more comfortable before cross examining him, by either bringing him a throne to sit on, or laying a feast for him to eat, in both cases it is done in the spirit vision rather than physically. An example: If he [the god] says, “I [will] prophesy,” say: “Let the throne of god enter, THRONOUZATERA KYMA KYMA LYAGEU APSITADRYS GĒ MOLIANDRON BONBLILON PEUCHRĒ, let the throne be brought in.” If it then is carried by 4 men, [say to the boy] as, “With what are they crowned, and what goes before the throne?” If he says, “They are crowned with olive branches, and a censer precedes,” [then the] boy speaks the truth.1655 This procedure of making the spirit comfortable, especially with food, is carried through the PGM to both the Hygromanteia and later Latin grimoires. One extension of the use of an olive oil lamp in skrying, is the “Maskelli” formula. After consecrating three reeds to the four quarters, a clean lamp is placed facing east, and the same invocations are both said seven times and written on a cloth strip. Frankincense is offered and the three reeds are bound together with date palm fibre into a tripod which holds the lamp. The use of a tripod in divination is typically Greek, something which is further underlined by the magician being crowned with olive branches.1656 The desired outcome is that the answers are to be shown to the magician in his sleep: I conjure you by the sleep releaser [of dreams] because I want you to enter into me and to show me concerning the NN matter...1657   1650 Thoth. 1651 PDM xiv. 470-473. 1652 Davies (2009), pp. 64-65. 1653 Ra, the sun god. 1654 PDM xiv. 493. 1655 PGM V. 31-40. 1656 Rather than laurel. 1657 PGM IV. 3190-3209."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":" 364 Strangely, one of the experiments of lamp skrying contains a passage which was later to become a classic recipe for the production of a homunculus. You bring some flowers of the Greek bean plant.1658 You find them in the place of the garland seller (also called the lupine seller).1659 You should bring them while they are fresh; you should put them in a glass bowl; you should seal its mouth with clay very well for twenty days in a hidden, dark place. After twenty days, if you bring it up and open it, you find some testicles in it together with a phallus. If you leave it for forty days and [then] bring it up and open it, you find that it has already become bloody. In a place which is hidden at all times, you put it in a glass object, and you put the glass object into a pottery object.1660 This form of divination does not occur in either the Hygromanteia or the Clavicula Salomonis. 8.2 Lekanomanteia – Bottle and Bowl Skrying (B) Lecanomancy (\u0010\f\u0005\u0002\u0013\t\u0004\u0002\u0013\u000b\f\u0006\u0002) is derived from the Greek word for bowl \u0010\f\u0005!\u0013 (lekanē). Usually oil would be poured on the surface of water. Or, more sophisticatedly, the flame from a lamp might be reflected in the surface of the liquid providing a suitably animated skrying surface. Mesopotamia Lecanomancy is first recorded in the Babylonian Ritual Tablets (7th century BCE): Cypress, fine flour he shall pour out, oil on the libation he shall put, an offering he shall pour out, oil on the water of the vessel he shall put, of Šamaš and Hadad, the great gods, he shall inquire. When the omen and the oil [divination] are faultless the great gods come near and judge a judgement of justice and righteousness...the diviner shall look upon oil in water...1661 An early baraitha1662 on the Babylonian Talmud (200 CE) shows that Jews living there also adopted the same practices. In it the vessel was referred to as a makalta/makultu, which was used for mixed oil and water skrying. Lkm is simply a container for oil. In one example of this practice in the PGM a boy skryer looks into olive oil in a saucer.1663 This rite is quite revealing as it gives the rubric, or ritual instructions, in detail. The saucer or bowl is placed on a ‘brick.’ The word translated as a ‘brick’ throughout the PGM is, I think, more adequately rendered as a clay tablet. In addition to the ‘brick,’ “carve these characters   1658 Literally “eye of raven” plant. Beans have a long history of being considered magical, beginning before the Pythagorean prohibition against eating them. 1659 Such ‘shopping hints’ confirm that these texts are written by working magicians who went to some lengths to secure their ingredients. 1660 This is repeated almost word-for-word in several other papyri. This example comes from PDM xiv. 141-145. 1661 Ritual Tablets 15-25 quoted in Daiches (1913), pp. 8-9. Daiches contends that the Babylonians practised oil divination “as long back as 2000 BCE.” The Babylonians in turn ascribed these practices to the Sumerians. 1662 Commentary. 1663 PGM LXII. 24-46."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":" 365 on a magnet that is ‘breathing.’”1664 In addition the afterbirth of a white dog should be added to the bowl, and KARBAŌTH should be written with myrrh ink on a phylactery, for protection, and hung on the skryer’s chest. A bowl skrying with a more Greek flavour is effected via Aphrodite and uses a mixture of water and oil in a bronze drinking cup. Typically the bowl is written on with myrrh ink.1665 Here it is recommended that the magician waxes over the writing on the bowl, presumably to prevent this writing being washed off by the skrying medium.1666 Another bowl skrying is inserted as part of a rite of divine encounter. It utilises a bronze bowl or saucer, with water and green olive oil, but it makes a distinction between the different types of water used.1667 This bowl skrying also utilises a phylactery for protection.1668 In the London and Leiden Papyrus a similar rite begins with an invocation of the gods of the Underworld.1669 It utilises a boy (“a pure youth who has not yet gone with a woman”) as a skryer, a dish filled with oasis oil [presumably palm oil], and seven clay tablets1670 representing the planets, and seven loaves of bread, and seven lumps of salt, as offerings. The invocation is designed to be spoken down into the head of the boy who must wear a phylactery for protection.1671 In yet another rite the god invoked is Khonsu (in Thebes Nefer-hotep) the Moon god described as “the noble child who came forth from the lotus,” thereby identifying him with Harpocrates.1672 The standard Egyptian gods Anubis, Isis, Horus, Nephthys and Osiris also appear. This rite calls upon the souls of the dead for answers to the divinatory questions. The vessel is either a clean copper beaker or a new pottery vessel, used with an equal measure of water and oil (or oil alone) with a stone qs-‘nh, which is probably magnetic haematite, and a plant associated with embalming. The usual array of three clay tablets under and four around, with loaves, is prescribed. Both the magician and skryer sit on a clay tablet.   1664 The point of breathing is that the magnet should still be able to ‘inhale’ or attract other metal to it. 1665 It is an interesting assumption that writing that is meant to be taken notice of by spiritual creatures should always be scented in one way or another. Myrrh is the preferred incense for ink in PGM. 1666 PGM IV. 3209-54. 1667 Rainwater = the heavenly gods; seawater = earthly [chthonic?] gods; river water = Sarapis or Osiris; and spring water = the dead. 1668 PGM IV. 221-260. 1669 PDM xiv. 1-92. 1670 As before, this is translated as ‘bricks.’ 1671 Dee in 1583 arrayed seven tablets (one for each of the planets) on his ‘Holy Table’ which supported his skrying stone. These procedures are not far distant from each other. 1672 PDM xiv. 239-95."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" 366 Another rite utilises a copper cup with the figure of Anubis engraved upon it,1673 with an oil/water mixture, and the usual clay tablet arrangement. A lobe of an Anubis plant1674 is to be put on the lamp. The incense is to be frankincense, oil, ammoniac, incense and dates pounded with wine. There is also a method which can be used by the magician without a skryer.1675 In it the magician commands Anubis to bring the god of the day and the gods of whatever town the magician is currently residing in. Anubis acts like a psychopomp, introducing the magician in turn to the gods that he needs to answer his questions. Another passage gives the correct facing directions in cases where a skryer is used: the skryer should face east, while the magician faces west.1676 Another bowl auto-skrying in Demotic relies upon an ointment placed on his eyes to give the magician the ability to skry.1677 Ingredients include the blood of a Nile goose, a hoopoe, a nightjar, myrrh, lapis-lazuli, plus several plants. One interesting PGM procedure (one of the few attributed to Solomon) explains how the magician should throw the skryer into a trance before he begins skrying, a trance so deep that the skryer will actually fall down as if in a faint. This rite which is described by Betz as a “charm of Solomon that produces a trance,” is also a good example of the lax use of words like “charm.” The Greek is :\t\u0010\t\u00040\u0013\u000b\t\u0007 \u0005\u0002\u000b!\u001e\u000b\u0017\u0014ι\u0007,1678 which Preisendanz translates more accurately as ‘Solomon’s fall.’1679 In fact, the actual meaning is “Solomon’s [invocation which causes the skryer] to fall down [in a trance].” This interpretation is confirmed by a passage further on in the same rite: Then say the formula 7 times just into the ear of the NN man or little boy [skryer], and right away he will fall down [in a trance].1680 The passage states, with a touch of pride, that it “works both on boys and on adults.” The magician planning to use this procedure is specifically made to swear not to disclose it to anyone else. It is possible to re-create what was said seven times into the skryer’s ear from Jewish sources.   1673 PDM xiv. 395-427. The procedure of using a copper cup for skrying appears later in chapter 53 of the Hygromanteia as chalkomanteia. 1674 The text explains, “it grows in millions of places. Its leaf is like the leaf of Syrian [plant] which grows white; its flower is like the flower of conyza.” Deines and Grapow (1959) identified this plant as mentha aquatica. 1675 PDM xiv. 528-553. 1676 PDM xiv. 627-635 1677 PDM xiv. 295-308. 1678 In both words Preisendanz uses the final form ς instead of σ in both initial and medial positions. 1679 Salomon's Niederfallen. Interestingly, this is one of the few mentions of Solomon in the PGM. 1680 PGM IV. 910-911."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":" 367 One mediaeval German source claims the words to be said in the boy’s right ear are: “Adam Chavah Abton Absalom Sarfiel Nuriel Daniel” followed nine times by “Gerte, I conjure you with these seven names which I have mentioned, to appear in the wax of this candle, carefully prepared and designated for this purpose, and to answer truthfully concerning that which I shall question you.”1681 The B2 manuscript of the Hygromanteia is the most comprehensive when it comes to the evocatory skrying section, and it contains the most detail about the use of a boy skryer used in conjunction with a vision-medium such as a water pot, bowl, basin, glass, mirror, crystal, egg or a fingernail.1682 One experiment of skrying using a water jar and virgin boy is clearly derived from PGM. In it the magician reads the invocation over the boy’s head. In the Hygromanteia there are a number of additions, the most important of which is that the boy is now protected by an elaborate Solomonic circular floor design (see Figure 14). It is not clear if the magician also stands within the circle, although it seems likely as the illustration suggests that the gate of the square is situated three feet from the gate of the circle. In both cases the ‘gate’ is simply an opening through which the boy may pass, but which is protected by various nomina magica. The circle (the first of the three types discussed in chapter 5.3.1 above) seems to have been introduced in the Byzantine environment, and it is drawn with that typically Greek magical implement, the black-handled knife. Jewish elements such as “by the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, by the God of Moses...by the God of Elijah“ are present, and there are also some Christianised elements introduced into the procedure, such as the reading of the 18th and 42nd Psalm,1683 and the intriguing use of John the Baptist as a name to conjure by. The unique part of chapter 48, evocatory skrying using a bottle, is the anointing of the child skryer’s hand with the greasy soot from the bottom of a cooking pan. That, or the pouring of ink into the child’s hand, as a skrying medium, is still practised even today in Morocco and Egypt,1684 and also in a number of other Muslim countries like Syria. The magician burns incense containing the cooking herbs coriander and nigella. The magician summons a spirit to appear to the child, rather than encouraging passive skrying in the reflective surface of the ink. As the sigil is drawn directly on the child’s hand, and not in a bowl, this procedure is in fact not literally a lekanomanteia.   1681 Trachtenberg (2004), p. 220. 1682 See chapters 47-57. Supplementary material can be found scattered through the other manuscripts except for P2, M, A2, D, T and N which include none of the chapters on skrying. 1683 Psalms 19 and 43, according to KJV numbering. 1684 See Lane (1896), pp. 277-284 for descriptions of skrying hand-held ink pools in 19th century Egypt."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":" 368 The version in A is particularly interesting as is includes instructions to the spirits not to sexually molest the girl skryer, confirming a strong belief in the corporeality of spirits which are seen to be capable of partially interacting with the physical world: Let her work for me without fear and let nobody among you dare to frighten her, nor kiss her lips, nor her nose, nor her eyebrows.1685 This manuscript also gives a detailed drawing of what is to be drawn on the skryer’s palm.1686 Jewish sources This procedure probably has its roots in Jewish practice, as the most complete description of this procedure is found in a much later (1775) Hebrew manuscript: Take a new knife with a black handle and make with it a circle in the earth,1687 so that you can sit in it with a boy or a girl [the skryer] less than nine years (old), and anoint the left hand of one of them with olive oil and the black (soot) of a pan, and warn them that they should not look outside the anointed place, and then whisper into his right ear: I adjure you (in the name of) BŠKT, K KATRIEL, MI, Maeniel that you shall appear unto this lad, and you shall give him a proper answer to all that he asks for me, and all this he shall say three times.1688 The method of Solomonic ritual magic is also found here in the form of the circle inscribed with the black-handled knife. The spirits are commanded to bring a lamb and cook it. After they have eaten they are then required to answer the magician’s questions. A number of similar operations in the same codex parallel the evocatory skrying operations in the Hygromanteia. The words of some adjurations are quite different, but the concept of pleasing a king of the spirits still appears. This particular passage has more detail than the corresponding passages in the Hygromanteia,1689 but there is nothing that could help to definitely establish precedence of composition. The same tradition was preserved in very few manuscripts of the Clavicula Salomonis. One manuscript written by Lunardo Longo, a Neapolitan working in Venice, was preserved by the Inquisition in the 1630s and had the following instructions: To see in a jar [bottle] what you are eager to know You will get a virgin boy, and tell him to go and take a jar [bottle] of fresh well-water or water from a river or spring, that he should not speak to anybody either going or coming back1690 and then put him with the jar in the sun, and put your right hand on the boy’s head, and you will   1685 A, f. 41. 1686 A, f. 41v. 1687 A protective Solomonic circle. 1688 Codex Gaster 443. 1689 Such as the prohibition of doing it on the New Moon, or the day before or after, or on a cloudy day. 1690 The so-called ‘unspoken water’ of the Hygromanteia."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":" 369 say: [“] O! you eastern princes I beg you by the truth of the 72 divine names which is me1691... that in this jar you show and come and show to this boy, who will ask you in my name,[“] then having made the boy speak, you will say in his left ear “tat, bet, tet” 3 times, and then you will say that the boy must say, “pag pag,” then you will ask the boy whether he sees anything in that jar, and if he says no repeat the above words in his ear, and he must say his words 7 times until he tells you that he sees a King, and then you will tell him to beg him [the King] to bring all his court, and once they have come to bring a lamb, and flay it, and kill it, and bring fire and cook it, and eat, and drink merrily. Then tell the King to send them all away, and beg him to keep his faithful servant with him only until he [the King] knows what he [the boy] wants, then you must beg him to send his servant to fetch a book of the holy law,1692 and bring it to the King, and let the boy make the King swear [on the book] to reply truthfully to everything that you ask, and when you see that the King has sworn make him say that you beg him by God and by his sworn oath to tell the truth about what he has stolen1693 or anything else [you wish to know], and if he [the King] wishes beg him send for paper, pen and inkpot and word for word, letter by letter, as the boy understands, the boy should write down the [King’s] sure reply to everything.1694 The characterisation of the spirits invoked as ‘princes’ reminiscent of the Jewish ‘princes of the thumb,’ the reference to the Shemhamaphoresch and the use of Hebrew letters in the conjuration, “tat [t?], bet [b], tet [f]” seems to confirm the Jewish rather than Greek origin of this procedure, as suggested in chapter 3.3 above. This interesting passage also touches upon several other magical methods which are also seen in the Hygromanteia and the PGM, such as: feeding spirits before asking them questions; the magician dealing first with the King of the spirits; the magician asking the King (\u0002$\u000e+\u0013\u000b\u0007) to swear upon a book of holy writ. 8.3 Hygromanteia – Water Skrying Lecanomancy and hygromanteia are distinct, but often in practise the line between them is blurred. An example of this blurring can be seen in the Greek caption applied to the magician in one procedure of hygromanteia of the first type.1695 Above the head of the drawing of the magician is written “the Persian lecanomancer called Apolonios (sic).” Other Byzantine figures were associated with lecanomancy such as the patriarch John VII the Grammarian who was accused of lecanomancy by George the Monk writing soon after 843.1696 He went on to describe him as a “new Apollonius and Balaam,” further making the connection between lecanomancy and Apollonius of Tyana. Both lecanomancy and hygromanteia are forms of evocatory skrying. Lecanomancy refers to the container and hygromanteia refers to the liquid within the container. Although lekanomanteia appears in the PGM, hygromanteia per se does not.   1691 Self-identification with the Shemhamaphoresch, another Jewish procedure. 1692 This could as easily be the Torah as the Bible. 1693 This probably refers to an enquiry about a thief rather than an accusation of theft directed to the King. 1694 Notebook by Lunardo Longo, 1630.

Not only is there a detailed circle of protection,1699 which consists of a square within a circle, but specific Psalms are read, a conjuration replete with nomina magica is said, candles are lit, and the black-handled knife is used to trace a circle of protection. An ‘oath book’ or Liber Spirituum is produced to ensure truthfulness on the part of the spirits. The bottle also contains a silver coin and a magnet, supposedly to attract the spirit, both concepts with a long history. A new bottle of water gathered from a spring is the skrying medium.1700 When the spirit arrives, not only is he cross-questioned by the skryer, at the instigation of the magician, but he is also encouraged to introduce other spirits. This is like the opening section of the Testament of Solomon where Solomon conjures Ornias, and then demands that he bring other spirits/demons, each of which is to swear obedience to Solomon. The operation finishes with a formal Licence to Depart. This operation is a far cry from simple water divination, or passive observance of patterns rippling on the surface of the water, and is a complete evocation and binding of spirits. As such this is an excellent example of how fully ritualised skrying works. The techniques which reached the Latin world (at least in written sources) are a pale shadow of this procedure. The second technique, also referred to as hygromanteia, and outlined in chapter 50 of the Hygromanteia, involves both spring water (drawn silently on the night of the day of Mercury) and a partly submerged mirror as a skrying medium. Its vessels include a kettle and bowl. This procedure also includes the recitation of Psalms 57 and 77th and the specification that the operation should be done at dawn. The third procedure (chapter 51), also called hygromanteia, strangely suggests the skryer should be a child with blue eyes, suggesting (in the Byzantine context) that the child was probably from northern Europe, and maybe a slave. This time the water should be blessed at Epiphany rather than drawn silently from a spring and covered with a red cloth. After the recitation of a conjuration, the child should see the spirits. The magician asks the spirits to prepare a feast for their king, who is then questioned by the magician. There are similar examples in the PGM, already cited, where the magician orders the spirits to prepare a feast   1697 It is only actually called hygromanteia in P. 1698 To be found in P, f. 271; B2, f. 344; V, f. 364; and a fragment in M2, f. 244. 1699 B2, f. 344. 1700 The “glass receptacle” filled with spring water was still in use 500 years later in the mid 19th century, when it was used by Hockley."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":" 371 for the gods, before cross-questioning the latter.1701 The fourth type of hygromanteia is instanced in chapter 52, although it is not so entitled in the text.1702 In this case the skryer is protected by a circle, but uses a yellow cloth rather than red. The water is topped up with oil and the equipment consists of a copper kettle placed upside down in a basin (see Figure 13). The rest of the procedure is familiar with the magician reciting a conjuration, and the skryer reporting what he sees. There is no specific trace of hygromanteia in the Clavicula Salomonis, but there are a number of examples of it in vernacular use. This is an example of a discontinuity and helps to confirm that ‘hygromanteia’ could not have been the over all title of the Hygromanteia. Perhaps the most famous exponent of hygromancy, divorced from the Clavicula Salomonis was Michael de Nostradame or Nostradamus (1503-1566) a French Jewish convert to Christianity who was famous for his prophetic quatrains. The inspiration for these he received from a combination of astrology and skrying using hygromancy. In his first quatrains Nostradamus clearly stated that he followed a technique which he attributed to the ancient oracle of the god Branchus in Didyma, an oracle only slightly less famous than the oracle at Delphi.1703 His procedure involved placing a bowl of water on a brass tripod, then dipping a wand into the bowl which he would then touch to his robe, before gazing into the water. Obviously some steps of the procedure have been deliberately left out: 1. Gathered at night in study deep I sat, Alone, upon the tripod stool of brass, Exiguous flame came out of solitude, [a] Promise of magic that may be believed. 2. The rod in hand set in the midst of the BRANCHES,1704 He moistens with water both the fringe and foot; Fear and a voice make me quake in my sleeves; Splendour divine, the God is seated near.1705 The significance is that, despite being a recent Jewish convert, he credits Greek Mystery sources with this procedure rather than Jewish magic. Nostradamus is known to have read Psellus’ De Demonibus1706 and Iamblichus’ De Mysteriis,1707 which describes the oracle of Branchus:   1701 PGM V. 31-40. 1702 What Marathakis refers to as ‘divination by means of basin, kettle and glass,’ I have re-named ‘Hygromanteia type IV.’ 1703 Johnston (2008), pp. 82-90. 1704 The capitals are in the original French, so they were obviously meant to be noticed. 1705 Nostradamus, Centuries I, 1-2, translation by Charles Ward 1891.

Although the line of transmission, in this instance, is not direct, this is an interesting encapsulation of the subject of this thesis, epitomising the endurance of magical (and divinatory) methods and equipment from the ancient to the modern world.   1708 Clarke, Dillon and Hershbel (2003), p. 149."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" 373 Figure 61: Schematic of the lines of transmission of Solomonic magical texts and techniques from the eastern Mediterranean to Northern Europe.

Conclusions It is clear from chapters 5-7, that there is a considerable amount of commonality in the methods and equipment of magic as identified in the PGM, Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis. This detailed commonality is greatest between the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis. There is also a close chronological connection between the exit of monks from Constantinople after the attack by Mehmet II (1422), the copying of the Hygromanteia in the Byzantine monastery of Grottaferrata (1440) and the first extant manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis translated into Italian (1466), possibly in Bologna.1710 This train of events plus the commonality supports the existence of a line of transmission from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis which is identifiable down to the very detailed level of Solomonic method, parallel chapter headings and their contents, invocations, specific pieces of equipment. Therefore there can be no doubt, as Greenfield suspected, that the Hygromanteia is the forefather of the Clavicula Salomonis. There are two sections in the Hygromanteia which are exceptions to this transmission. The first exception is the pentacles chapters which are to be found in (some versions of) the Clavicula Salomonis. These do not derive from the Hygromanteia, but probably come from the manuscript Sepher ha-Otot, or from its source. A crude cut-down version of these pentacles was utilised in the Hygromanteia as part of the construction of the ourania/lamen. The rough shape of these pentacles can be seen in the very sketchy seals of the ourania. The pentacles found in versions of the Clavicula Salomonis are much more detailed than those in the Hygromanteia, but fail to live up to the complexity of the pentacles of the Sepher ha-Otot, whose Hebrew is much more detailed. It is therefore very unlikely that the Hygromanteia supplied the pentacles for the Clavicula Salomonis. Therefore either the Sepher ha-Otot is tributary to both the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis, or at the least, all three have a common ancestor whose text is best preserved in the Sepher ha-Otot. The second exception to the transmission is the skrying chapters (47-59) in the Hygromanteia.1711 These have not been passed on to the Clavicula Salomonis. They have been passed on, albeit in a very fragmentary way, to other Latin manuscripts unrelated to the Clavicula Salomonis, such as Trithemius’ Art of Drawing Spirits into Crystals.1712 These skrying methods are found almost word-for-word in an 11th century Jewish source (see chapter 3.3). Accordingly, either this Jewish source (or a cognate manuscript) supplied these chapters to the Hygromanteia, or they were derived from it. At the present time there is no certain way of   1710 See chapter 3.5. 1711 Chapters 47-59. 1712 Barrett (1801), Book II, pp. 129-140."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":" 375 determining the direction of this transmission. With regard to the line of transmission from the PGM to the Hygromanteia, there is no clear indication, but the high degree of commonality in method and nomina magica makes it certain that the PGM was a major source of the contents of the Hygromanteia. A number of common magical techniques were identified, such as the precise timing of rites by hour, day and Moon phase, the emphasis on strict purification which included fasting, the use of specific incenses and techniques such as threatening spirits with the names of their superior demons, or controlling angels to ensure the spirit’s compliance with the magician’s orders. Another method found in both texts was the impersonation by the magician of a god in order to achieve the submission of the spirit. All these techniques, and many more, were found to be common to all three texts. There is a definite sequence to the procedures of ‘Solomonic magic’, foreshadowed in the PGM, but precisely defined in the Hygromanteia and the Clavicula Salomonis, and identified as the ‘Solomonic method.’ An important and distinguishing feature of the Solomonic method is the provision of graphical symbols for the protection of the magician during the performance of a rite. The first such method of protection was the inscription of an elaborate circle (or set of circles) on the ground within which the magician stands. The provenance of this circle can be traced in detail (with many examples) from the Hygromanteia to the Clavicula Salomonis. There are also passing references to it in the PGM and in the 1st century BC tale of the magician Honi ha-Ma'agel, confirming its long history. The second piece of graphical equipment used for the protection of the magician is the phylactery/ourania/lamen which is common and well documented in all three texts. Because of common demon names (see Table 06), and the use of the thwarting angel technique to control spirits (which was examined in chapter 3.2 under the discussion of Rite type ‘F’) it is also true to say that the 1st/2nd century CE Testament of Solomon was also a substantial contributory text to the Hygromanteia. Because the common translation of -\u0004\u0002\u0013\u000b\fι\u0002 as used in chapters 47-58 of the Hygromanteia does not cover the procedures recorded in those chapters, it became necessary to expand the definition of this suffix to embrace evocation and skrying rather than just divination. It was established (in chapter 5.5.3) that although common nomina magica like Adonai, Iaō and Sabaoth are frequently found in the PGM, the Hygromanteia and Clavicula Salomonis, they are not associated with the methods of Jewish mysticism. The Solomonic method has very little in common with the Hekhalot and Merkavah techniques which partake of pious Jewish"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":" 376 mysticism which relies on prayer without the use of the equipment or techniques identified as being the essence of Solomonic magic. Furthermore the source of Solomonic magic could not be found in such texts as the Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh as it was in fact a translation of a Latin/Italian manuscript of the Clavicula Salomonis, and therefore not its source. Having said that, there is concrete evidence embedded in some versions of the Clavicula Salomonis,1713 that there was an historical Hebrew source, but it is not the Sepher Maphteah, and it has not yet been identified. A set of correspondences which probably formed part of the Hygromanteia, which included stones, herbs and beasts (including birds and fishes), has most likely been split off from the Hygromanteia, prior to 1440, as is evidenced by the remaining traces of zodiacal and planetary herbal correspondences found in several manuscripts of that text. Sets of these correspondences (often 15 in number) reappear in other Latin grimoires, such as the Sepher Raziel, or in separate lapidaria, herbaria or bestiaries, but have not carried forward into the Clavicula Salomonis. One of the self-contained books found in the PGM, the so-called Mithrasliturgie,1714 is neither a Mithraic text nor the liturgy of any religion. In fact it is the procedure for a solitary Mystery rite, addressed directly to the greatest god, designed to confer immortality upon just one initiate. It is therefore neither religion nor magic, but a Mystery ritual. However, it does include some supportive magical techniques, such as the ritual of drowning an animal (a scarab beetle in this case) to deify that animal. The relationship of these three categories (magic, Mystery and religion) was examined in chapter 1.5, with the result that Mystery rites (Rite type ‘M’) were excluded from the analysis of the magic in the PGM. Unsurprisingly, the Mystery rites are not found in either the Hygromanteia or the Clavicula Salomonis. As part of the consideration of these techniques, and the light they throw on the ingredients of magical texts from various periods, a new translation for the Ephesia Grammata has been proposed, which if accepted, acts as an example of how knowledge of the reasoning behind the techniques can sometimes help to decipher the meaning of nomina magica. A number of conclusions were drawn about the origins and provenance of the Hygromanteia in the course of analysing it, including a suggested date of composition of the late 6th/early 7th century. A major redaction was identified as occurring in Constantinople in the early 13th century, because of the inclusion of passages traceable to Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-Zanātī, which were only translated into Greek by the monk Arsenios in 1266 in   1713 For example, the copy translated by Abraham Colorno in Vencenzo Gonzaga’s library, or that translated by Professor Pierre Morissoneau. 1714 PGM IV 475-820."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":" 377 Constantinople. It very likely that the author was Greek educated and not a Christian and the place of original composition of the Hygromanteia was probably Alexandria. The text was then subsequently taken to Constantinople. From a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence, the hypothesis was put forward that the Hygromanteia may have been written or compiled by Stephanos of Alexandria (and Athens) in the late 6th century, and taken by him to Constantinople. It is certain, in the light of the actual contents of the main text (chapters 1-46), that the Hygromanteia is in every sense a grimoire, a practical text of ritual magic, and not a book of divination. The last chapters (47-59), which are clearly a separate section, deal with various types of ritual skrying including hygromanteia, epibaktromanteia, lekanomanteia, katoptromanteia, krystallomanteia, ōomanteia and onykhomanteia.1715 This section which only appears in its complete form in one of the extant manuscripts (B2), and appears to be included in a very fragmented form in all other manuscripts,1716 could quite possibly have been entitled ‘hygromanteia.’ Therefore in all likelihood this section title has a one point been incorrectly applied inclusively to the whole text.

Therefore there can be no doubt that the Hygromanteia is the forefather of the Clavicula Salomonis.   1715 Manuscript H shows this break in contents very clearly, as at one point in time this manuscript must have ended after chapter 43, as the last line of this chapter (f. 37v) is “The end of the Art of Directing the Demons.” 1716 See Table 01. 1717 Pingree (1980), p. 9. 1718 See also Greenfield (1988), p. 159-160 where he identifies this text as Solomon’s Magic Treatise and goes on to say “it has been maintained that the title Hygromanteia, which appears in some manuscripts, is false...” Pingree (1980), p. 9 states that it [manuscript P] is “falsely entitled Hygromantia (sic).” His comment obviously applies to all the manuscripts of the Hygromanteia."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" 378 iii) There are two main exceptions to the above point: a) The skrying chapters in the Hygromanteia,1719 have not been passed on to the Clavicula Salomonis.

Of these, obviously manuscript H (with 41 chapters) gives the fullest coverage of all possible chapters, as well as being one of the oldest. Manuscript A (Atheniensis 1265 in the National Library of Athens) is the next most comprehensive. Manuscript M (with only eight chapters) was relied upon by Torijano in his discussion of the Hygromanteia supplemented by manuscripts H, P and A. The least useful manuscripts, in terms of chapter coverage, are T, M2, D and A2. 1761 Discovered by Delatte, who published it in his monograph Delatte (1959). 1762 As appendices to his book, Torijano provides a partial English translation of the version contained in M, as well as the Greek text of four manuscripts: M (reproduced from Catalogus VIII 2), H, P and D (reproduced from Anecdota Atheniensia I). A Spanish translation of M was published by the same author three years before.
