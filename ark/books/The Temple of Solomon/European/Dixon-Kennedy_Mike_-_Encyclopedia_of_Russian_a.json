Those that have sur-vived have been Christianized, their paganroots now long forgotten.My introduction to Russian legend wasthe story of the witch Baba-Yaga, told meby someone whose identity I have since for-gotten. Many years later, as I began toresearch world mythology and legend, Baba-Yaga resurfaced as I delved into the myster-ies and delights of ancient Russian andSlavic folklore.This book is a general guide to the mythsand legends of the Russian Empire at itsgreatest extent, along with those of countriesand peoples that can be broadly defined asSlavic or that have influenced and beeninfluenced by Slavic cultures. Today, at theend of the twentieth century, Russia or Rusis a huge country that occupies a large partof Europe and Asia.Yet it was once a land ofmodest size that subsequently underwentcenturies of expansion and change. Pop-ulations came and went, and each migrationadded to the culture base of the country as itprogressed from one incarnation to thenext—from principality to empire. All thismovement has left the rich legacy of mythol-ogy and legend detailed in this volume—alegacy inherited by a land that coversapproximately one-sixth of the earth’s totallandmass.This volume is not unique. A good num-ber of books have been published about themyths and legends of the ancient Russiansand Slavs. However, as a quick look at theBibliography will show, many of these areavailable only in languages other thanEnglish.Thus this book presents, possibly forthe first time, the myths and legends in theirtranslated form. In addition, a great deal ofhistorical, geographical, and biographicalinformation related to the Slavs and theirmythology has been included so that readersmay gain the deepest possible understandingof the myths and legends against their cul-tural and geographical background. Adetailed map of the area covered by this vol-ume has been included to make this last taskeasier; for even though certain places orcountries described might be familiar, thereare a fair number that are not so well known.Russian and Slavic beliefs weave a richtapestry between the real world and theworld of pure fantasy. Here we have a culturethat believed in a large number of supernat-ural and fantastical beings, from dragons toone-eyed or multiheaded monsters, fromshape-changing wolves to soulless beings.Wealso find a curious mix of the pagan and theChristian; for even though Russia adoptedChristianity as the state religion in A.D. 988,paganism remained popular until the end ofthe nineteenth century, and in more remoteareas, even up to the present day. Thus wefind Christian themes interwoven withpagan ideas: Dragons fight priests, saintsencounter nymphs, and witches enter thekingdom of heaven.PREFACE"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"It is my hope that by preparing this vol-ume in the format in which it is presented, Ihave brought the myths and legends of theRussian and other Slavic peoples to a muchbroader readership, and by so doing, haveincreased readers’ understanding of the cul-tures on which the volume touches.Obviously one such volume cannot begin todo justice to this subject. Although I haveincluded as much information as possiblewithin the physical constraints of the book, Ihope readers will be inspired to undertaketheir own, further research and to carry it tonew levels.Whenever one writes a book, one obvi-ously owes thanks to many different peoplefor their help. To list all those who over theyears have provided me with information,guided me as to where to look, and correct-ed my countless mistakes and assumptionswould need a volume all its own. Needless tosay, they all know just who they are, and toeach and every one of them I say a great big“thank you.”My final thanks have to go to my long-suffering wife, Gill, and to Christopher,Charlotte, Thomas, and Rebecca, my fouroften “fatherless” children. For long periodsof time over many years they have lost me tomy research, my passion. Very rarely havethey complained, and I hope that now theywill be able to enjoy the results of their soli-tude.

Where headwords have alternativespellings, these are given under the mainentry within the book preceded by “Also.”When the variant spellings are widely differ-ent, variants are given their own, shorterentries that direct readers to the mainentries. Where this is simply a matter of theomission or addition of a letter or letters,then those letters affected within the head-word are enclosed in parentheses; e.g.,Timofe(y)evna gives two versions of thepatronymic,Timofeyevnaand Timo-feevna, both of which are acceptabletransliterations from the Cyrillic.Where the variation is a different ending,then the most common is given first. Forinstance,Svarozhich (~gich)indicates thatthe most common variant is Svarozhichand the less common is Svarogich.Where the difference is a complete word,then that word is enclosed in parentheses.This occurs when an epithet or patronymicis part of the subject’s name but is not com-monly used, e.g.,Peter (Belyaninovich).2. Where there is a separate entry for anyof the people, places, or objects mentionedwithin an entry, a list of these will be foundat the end of the entry preceded by “Seealso.”3. At the end of many entries, citations ofsources in the References and FurtherReading section will be found, preceded by“References.”SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATIONThe spellings of Russian words and namesthat appear in this book are based on vari-ous commonly used systems of translitera-tion from the Cyrillic to the Latin alpha-bet. These word-spellings are phoneticallybased (see Appendix 2); thus, the wordsshould be pronounced more or less as writ-ten, with every vowel and consonant beingsounded (there are no silent e’s, for exam-ple).The single prime sign (') has been usedwhere the soft sign would appear in theCyrillic word, indicating that the precedingconsonant is palatalized. Appendix 2 showsthe full modern Cyrillic alphabet and eachletter’s various possible pronunciations aswell as its written equivalents in the Latinalphabet.RUSSIAN TITLESRussian rulers and their families were giventitles that may be unfamiliar to the reader.Briefly, they were as follows.tsaror czar—Russian emperor. The titlewas first used c. 1482 by Ivan Vasilevich,Grand Duke of Muscovy—better known asIvan Groznyi, or Ivan the Terrible.Thereafter,it was used by the emperors of Russia untilthe 1917 Revolution. The word tsar isderived from the Latin cæsar.tsarevichor czarevich—The son of atsar. Historically the tsarevich was the eldestson, but the word applies to any son, not justthe heir.tsarevnaor czarevna—The daughterof a tsar. Like the tsarevich, the tsarevna wasusually the eldest daughter of the tsar; butHOW TO USE THIS BOOK"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the word may be correctly applied to anydaughter.tsarinaor czarina—The wife of a tsar;an empress, but not necessarily a ruler in herown right.

The closely re-lated Balts are also divided into three groups:Latvians, Lithuanians, and Prussians.There is such a high degree of similarityamong the Slavic languages that expertsdescribe this linguistic group as a dialect con-tinuum in which the speakers of one languageunderstand much of what is said in the others.In their written form, the Slavic languages vis-ibly differ in that some, such as Polish, arewritten in the Roman alphabet, while others,like Russian, employ the Cyrillic alphabet (seeAppendix 2). These different alphabets arelargely explained by the turbulent history ofthe Slavic regions, which were subdued byvarious empires and rulers at various times.Although the languages themselves continueto flourish despite political and culturalupheavals, very little of ancient Slavic mythol-ogy and legend survives today.THE FINNO-UGRIC PEOPLESAlthough closely related to both the Baltsand Slavs, with whom they assimilated, theFinno-Ugric peoples do not belong to theIndo-European family. Their languagegrouping, a subfamily of the Ural-Altaicfamily, contains more than twenty differenttongues that are spoken from Norway in thewest to Siberia in the east, and to theCarpathian Mountains in the south.The Finno-Ugric peoples may be subdi-vided into four main groups according totheir geographical position. The first groupincludes the Finns, Lapps, Estonians (thoughEstonia is generally thought of as a Balticcountry), Livonians, and Karelians. The sec-ond grouping comprises the Cheremiss-Mordvin peoples of the middle and upperVolga. The third includes the Votyaks,Permyaks, and Zyrians, who inhabit theRussian provinces of Perm and Vyatka, andthe last, the Voguls and Ostyaks of westernSiberia. The Magyar people of Hungary arenormally included in the fourth grouping, asthey originated in western Siberia, but theyare generally considered a Turkic people.The Finno-Ugric peoples were widelyinfluenced by their Indo-European neigh-bors—the Balts, Slavs, and Norse/Teutons.Many of their legends bear direct compari-son with those of both the Balts and theSlavs.The legends of the Finnish peoples arenot considered in this volume, as they areextensive enough to warrant a volume oftheir own. In addition, these legends donot exhibit any signs of cultural cross-fertilization and seem to have little bearingon the study of Russian and Slavic mythand legend.BRIEF HISTORICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL DETAILS"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"OTHER PEOPLESYakutsAn indigenous people who live near theLena River in northeastern Siberia, in one ofthe coldest regions on earth, the Yakuts speaka Turkic language in the Ural-Altaic family,closely related to Finno-Ugric.

Adalbert (c.956–997) was born to a noble Bohemianfamily and baptized Voytech. At his confir-mation, he took the name Adalbert, after histeacher of the same name in Magdeburg.When his teacher died in 981, Adalbertreturned to Prague and was consecratedthere in 982, becoming the first nativebishop of the city. However, Adalbertencountered stiff opposition to his attemptsto convert others to Christianity, and in 990he withdrew from Prague to Rome, wherehe joined the Benedictine abbey of SaintsBoniface and Alexis. Duke Boleslaus(Boleslaw I, “the Brave”) of Poland peti-tioned Pope John XV (pope 985–996) forthe return of Adalbert to Prague, and shortlythereafter Adalbert was sent back underpapal decree.Conditions appeared to have improved,and Adalbert founded the Benedictine abbeyat Brevnov. The peace, however, was short-lived, and the populace once again grew hos-tile to him and his teachings when heattempted to give sanctuary to a womanwho had been accused of adultery. Thehorde dragged the woman out of his churchand summarily executed her, whereuponAdalbert promptly excommunicated every-one involved. Once again he was obliged toflee to Rome, from where he was yet againordered to return, this time by Pope GregoryV (pope 996–999). However, in his absence,several of his family had been murdered, so itwas decided, upon the suggestion of DukeBoleslaus, that Adalbert should undertake amission to the pagan Prussians in Pom-erania.Adalbert went on to evangelizeHungary and possibly Prussia andPoland as well but was murdered in997, along with his two companionsBenedict and Gaudentius, byPrussians who suspected them ofbeing Polish spies.Adalbert’s body was thrown into thewater near Königsberg (modern Kalin-ingrad, a Russian city that is separated fromthe rest of the country by Lithuania) but waslater recovered after it washed ashore inPoland. He was enshrined at Griezno, but hisrelics were forcibly repatriated to Prague in1039. Saint Adalbert is usually depicted witha club and lances—the weapons used tomurder him—and often with a two-headedcross.See also:Bohemia; Hungary; Poland; PrussiaAFRONRussiaThe tsar of an unnamed realm, which somesay lay in the Thrice-Ninth Kingdom, andthe owner of the Horse with the GoldenMane.

As Ajysyt-ijaksyt-khotan, she was the“birthgiving, nourishing mother.” Sheowned the Golden Book of Fate, which con-tained the names and destinies of everyhuman being either living or yet to be born.She brought the soul of the newborn babydown from heaven so that a complete humanbeing could come into existence and thenentered the name of the new person in theGolden Book of Fate. It was only when thename had been entered in the book that theperson became a fully fledged member of thehuman race. Other Siberian tribes thoughtthe mother-goddess dwelt in heaven on amountain that had seven stories. There shenot only gave newly born people their livesbut also determined the fate of all people andequipped them with the potential to do bothgood and evil.The Altai Tatars acknowledged a similardeity known as the “milk lake mother,” andthe Yakuts themselves have a curious mythabout a White Youth who encounters a calm“lake of milk” near the cosmic tree, theworld pillar of Yryn-al-tojon, the “whitecreator Lord.” After seeking the blessing ofthe tree, this youth felt a warm breeze, heardthe tree creak, and saw a female divinity,Ajysyt, rise from the roots. She offered himmilk from her full breasts, and after satisfyinghis thirst, the youth felt his strength increasea hundredfold. Thus, the milk-breastedmother of life, the mother-goddess, and thecosmic Tree of Life are combined into onesustaining and nourishing entity.See also:Golden Book of Fate,The; Lena,River; Siberia;Tatars;Tree of Life,The;WhiteYouth;Yakuts;Yryn-al-tojonAJYSYT-IJAKSIT-KHOTANSiberia —Yakut“Birthgiving, nourishing mother,” an aspectof the Yakut mother-goddess Ajysyt.See also:Ajysyt;YakutsAK MOLOTTatarOne of a pair of heroes who are described ina poem as engaged in mortal combat, the2AGOG-MAGOG"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"other hero being Bulat.Ak Molot managed toinflict numerous wounds on his enemy thatwould have killed any normal man, but Bulatwas not normal, for he did not carry his soul.After three years of fighting, Ak Molot saw agolden casket hanging from the sky on awhite silken thread.

Hewatches over his people and carries theirsouls to live on the moon after death. Oneday Alako will return from the moon andlead his people back to their lost homeland.Alako was worshiped as recently as thelate nineteenth century. Votaries carryingidols of Alako that showed him holding aquill in his right hand and a sword in his leftwould gather once a year at full moon, set uphis idols, and offer songs and prayers to him.These rites were then followed by a feast.Alako was also central to the rites of passage.At Christian baptisms, a child would be bap-tized in the names of both Christ and Alako,and all newlyweds were consecrated to him.See also:Dundra; MoonALANSRussiaIranian-speaking nomadic tribe of the bar-barian peoples known as the Sarmatians,who inhabited Russia in Roman times.Theyfirst appeared in history north of the CaspianSea, and between the second and fourth cen-turies A.D. migrated westward into the east-ern provinces of the Roman Empire. Theythen divided into two groups. One group ofAlans continued to migrate westward withthe Germanic peoples, appearing in Gaul,Lusitania (Portugal), and finally, NorthAfrica, where they merged with the Vandals.The other group, wandering eastward, settledin the Caucasus Mountains. Their descen-dants, the Ossetes of the Republic ofGeorgia, tell a story similar to that concern-ing the passing of King Arthur. It is quitepossible that the story of Arthur was carriedto the region by the Romans, although thishas never been proven. The story of Batradzthe Ossete hero might also have been thesource of the Arthurian legend, as it seems tobe the older of the two.See also:Arthur, King; Batradz; Caspian Sea;Caucasus; Georgia; Ossetes; SarmatiansALATNIRSlavA brilliant white stone that lies on the islandof Buyan.

Duringtheir wanderings the pair came to a pondwhere a herd of cattle were grazing.Ivanushka rushed to the water to slake histhirst, but Alenushka stopped him, warninghim that if he drank he would turn into acalf.Next they came to a lake beside which aflock of sheep were grazing. AgainIvanushka ran to the water’s edge, and againAlenushka stopped him from drinking,warning him that if he did he would turninto a lamb. Near the next stretch of watersome pigs were rooting about. Alenushkaonce more stopped Ivanushka from drink-ing, this time warning him that he wouldbecome a piglet. By the time they reachedthe next watering hole, near which a herd ofgoats were grazing, Ivanushka’s thirst was sogreat that he ignored his sister’s advice. Assoon as he drank the water, Ivanushkaturned into a kid.Alenushka harnessed her brother, and thetwo continued on their way.They eventuallyarrived at a royal palace, where Ivanushka ranoff to eat the well-manicured grass.The royalguards brought Alenushka and her brotherbefore the tsar, who was immediately capti-vated by Alenushka and asked her to marryhim. She consented and she and her brotherremained at the tsar’s palace.Some time later the tsar had to be away onbusiness. While he was absent, a sorceresswho had designs on his affections cast a spellon Alenushka, who fell ill, growing thinnerand weaker each day. By the time the tsarreturned, the flowers and the grass aroundthe palace had died, and Alenushka was verywan. Awhile later, the tsar again had to leavethe palace on business. This time the sorcer-ess told Alenushka that she could cure herselfif she went to the sea’s edge at dusk anddrank a little of the water. Alenushka went tothe sea to drink, but as she bent down to thewater, the sorceress tied a huge boulderaround her neck and threw her far out to sea.The sorceress then assumed the likeness ofAlenushka and returned to the palace, wherethe tsar rejoiced to see his wife restored tofull health.Ivanushka remained by the water, bleat-ing for his sister. In the palace the sorceressnagged the tsar to kill Ivanushka, saying thatshe had grown tired of the way he smelled.At first the tsar would not hear of it, buteventually he reluctantly agreed. Ivanushka,learning of his fate, asked the tsar for per-mission to go to the seashore. The tsaragreed.There Ivanushka called out to his sister,but Alenushka replied that she could notcome because of the boulder tied around herneck. Ivanushka returned to the palace, but atmidday once more asked permission to visitthe seashore, where he again called to his sis-ter and received the same reply. As duskbegan to fall Ivanushka asked permission ofthe tsar a third time. Once more the tsaragreed; but this time, his curiosity aroused byIvanushka’s strange behavior, he followed thekid to the edge of the water.There Ivanushkacalled to his sister, and this time she camebobbing to the surface.The tsar immediately swam out toAlenushka, released the boulder, and car-ried her back to the palace. There heordered his guards to light a huge bonfire.When the sorceress came out to see whatthey were doing, the tsar threw her ontothe fire, where she burned to death.

When Vladimirasked his knights which one would rescuethe princess Zabava from the clutches of adragon that had carried her away, it wasAlesha who told the prince about DobrynyaNikitich’s pact with the dragon, thus makingthe prince command that knight to rescuethe girl, or be beheaded.Alesha was not always inept, as the story ofhis arrival at Kiev proves. Riding out fromRostov, Alesha and his squire Ekim chose tohead for Kiev because they were certain thatthe other possible choices, Suzdal' andChernigov, would lead them into troubleeither from wine or from women. Arrivingin Kiev, they immediately realized that allwas not as it should be, for there were nogrooms waiting in the courtyard to stabletheir horses.Entering the royal palace, they presentedthemselves to Prince Vladimir Bright Sun,who had already heard of Alesha and badehim attend a banquet that night as a guest ofhonor.Alesha chose not to sit at the table butinstead to perch himself on the stove in thebanqueting hall, a position usually occupiedby beggars and serfs. Shortly after the mealhad got under way, the door to the hall wasthrown open and a giant, brutish creatureslithered in.This was Tugarin, a heathen crea-ture with the girth of two fully grown oaktrees, eyes set far apart in his ugly head, andears that were nearly eight inches long.Without paying his respect to Vladimir,Tugarin seated himself between the princeand his wife.Watching these events from his place onthe stove, Alesha inquired as to how seriousthe argument must have been between theprince and his wife to allow such an uglycreature to sit between them. IgnoringAlesha, Tugarin plunged the blade of hisknife into a roast swan that was set beforehim and ate it whole, spitting out the bonesas he swallowed the flesh. Alesha once againtaunted Tugarin, saying that his father,Leontii, once had a mongrel dog that chokedto death on a swan’s bone, and that he hopedTugarin would do the same. Tugarin againignored Alesha and devoured a huge gamepie in a single bite.Alesha once more commented, saying thathis father had had an old cow that hadrooted around in the dirt for food and hadchoked to death. He hoped that Tugarin’s illmanners would lead to the same fate. At lastTugarin rose to the bait and asked PrinceVladimir Bright Sun who the ignorant peas-ant was. When he heard that it was noneother than Alesha—for even Tugarin hadheard of him—he threw his long knife athim. However, the agile Ekim caught theknife by its handle. Seeing this, Tugarinpushed the table over and challenged Aleshato meet him out on the steppe.Alesha was only too happy to oblige andimmediately set out on foot. Some distancefrom Kiev, he came across a pilgrim who wascarrying a heavy staff weighing ninety poods(3,240 lbs, or 1,472 kg). Exchanging clotheswith the pilgrim, Alesha also borrowed thestaff. Soon afterward he caught sight ofTugarin astride a powerful horse, flying over-head on a set of paper wings he had made.Alesha prayed for a heavy shower of rain, andhis prayer was answered almost immediately.As the rain fell, Tugarin’s paper wings disin-tegrated and he crashed to the ground.Tugarin realized who the pilgrim was andgalloped toward him, fully intending to crushhim under his horse’s hooves.Alesha nimbly sidestepped the rushinghorse and hid beneath its flowing mane. AsTugarin searched for Alesha the knightstruck out with the staff, knocking Tugarin’shead from his shoulders. Picking up thehead, Alesha impaled it on the end of thestaff and returned to Kiev riding Tugarin’shorse.See also:Bogatyr'; Chernigov; DobrynyaNikitich; Dragon; Ekim; Kiev; Leontii;5ALESHA"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Rostov;Tugarin;Vladimir Bright Sun, Prince;Zabava (Putyatichna), PrincessReferences:Astakhova 1938–51; Speranskii1916ALEXANDER THE GREATGeneral356–323 B.C.

As each of the threechildren was identical and each had the samename, the old couple referred to them as FirstAlmafi, Second Almafi, and Third Almafi.When the children reached their eighteenthbirthday, the old man called them to him,speaking initially to First Almafi, saying thatthe time had come for him to leave homeand seek his fortune. His mother gave him aloaf of barley bread, and First Almafi set out.As night fell, First Almafi sat down undera tree and took out the barley loaf and beganto eat. He had only taken a couple of biteswhen an old man came up to him and askedfor food. First Almafi said that he wouldgladly share his meager rations, whereuponthe old man told the youth to watch for therising of the scythe-star, and then go in thedirection the shaft pointed him in. Along theway he would come to a fast-flowing stream.He was not to worry, as the stream’s waterswould bear his weight. In the midst of thestream grew the most beautiful water lilies.He was not to pick even a single one, as if hedid he would be lost. When he had crossedthe stream he would enter a field of silver,and after that, a field of gold. He was to crossboth without picking even a single blade ofthe enchanted grass, as if he did he wouldperish. Finally, having crossed the fields, hewould find his fortune.First Almafi thanked the old man, whoinstantly vanished. Then he watched andwaited for the scythe-star to rise, and set offin the direction it indicated once it wasclearly visible. Before long he came to thestream, which he started to walk across, stop-ping when he came to the water lilies.Bending down, he picked one of the blooms,instantly turned into a fish, and was carriedaway by the fast-flowing waters.Although it had been some time sinceFirst Almafi had set off to seek his fortuneand no word had come from him, his fathersent Second Almafi off to seek his fortune.Second Almafi took exactly the same road ashis brother had, sat under the same tree, sawthe same man, and received the same set ofinstructions. The old man, however, addedthat First Almafi had been tempted by one ofthe water lilies and had been lost. SecondAlmafi was almost tempted by the water liliesas he crossed the stream, but he rememberedthe words of the old man just in time andmade it safely across. However, as he enteredthe silver field he was so enchanted that hestooped down and picked a silver flower forhis buttonhole. Immediately he became a sil-ver snake and slithered away.Finally it was Third Almafi’s turn to setout and seek his fortune. He followed thesame road his brothers had, sat under thesame tree, and received the same instructionsfrom the same old man, who added that histwo brothers had already succumbed totemptation. Third Almafi set off, crossed thestream and the silver field with ease, and wasalmost tempted to pick a flower as he crossedthe golden field; but remembering what theold man had said, he resisted the urge andmade his way safely through the field.He found himself in a vast, empty desertthat stretched as far as the eye could see. Forthree days he struggled through the deepsand, his feet sinking with every step. Finallyhe sank to the ground, exhausted. He laythere a long time, until he heard a loud hum-ming in the sky, and looking up, saw a float-ing palace. As he watched the palace float by,he caught a glimpse of a beautiful maidenstanding on a balcony. He hauled himself tohis feet and hurried after the floating palace.Exhaustion finally got the better of ThirdAlmafi, who slumped to his knees, panting.As he knelt, a small chicken landed in frontof him. Almafi watched it in amazement. Hecould easily have reached out and eaten thebird, but it looked as exhausted as he was, sohe said that he would carry it so that theymight seek refuge together. Instantly the birdturned into the old man, who told him that7ALMAFI"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"as his pity had overcome his greed, he couldgrant Third Almafi one wish. Third Almafithought for a moment, then asked for histwo brothers to be released from theirenchantments. The old man told ThirdAlmafi that they were already on the roadhome, and then he vanished once more.Third Almafi continued on his journey,and after another day’s travel, as exhaustionwas again beginning to overtake him, hecame to a huge castle with no windows, justa single small door. Inside he found a hugehall with a row of tables in it. The first tableheld a bowl of porridge and a note sayingthat whoever ate the porridge would neverbe hungry again. Third Almafi sat down andemptied the bowl, and afterward he felt as ifhe need never eat again.He then moved to the second table, wherehe found a bottle of water along with a notesaying that whoever drank the water wouldnever feel thirst again. Without hesitationThird Almafi drank the water and thenmoved on to the third table, where he founda small jar containing some ointment, and anote saying that whoever anointed them-selves with the ointment would be filledwith the strength of a thousand men. ThirdAlmafi duly anointed himself and then wentto the fourth table. There he found a swordand a note saying that whoever wore thesword would be invincible. Third Almafibuckled on the sword and then went to thefifth table, where he found another small jarof ointment along with a note saying thatwhoever anointed their eyes with the lotionwould see everything. Third Almafi appliedthe lotion and then lay down to rest, for nowhe knew that he had to find the mysteriousflying palace and the maiden he hadglimpsed.For a full year Third Almafi wandered theworld, looking for the flying palace, andthrough all that time he never felt hunger orthirst. During his travels Third Almafi cameto the edge of an immense forest, where hesat down and fell asleep beneath a large oak,even though he didn’t really need to rest.His sleep was disturbed by a loud crowingfrom the branches above him. Sitting up,Third Almafi saw a large golden cockerel inthe tree, the tone of its crowing telling ThirdAlmafi that all was not well with the bird.Third Almafi asked it what the problem was,whereupon the cockerel told him that hewas under an enchantment, having origi-nally been a prince engaged to a beautifulmaiden.Third Almafi took pity on the plight ofthe prince and said that he would do what-ever he could to help. The cockerel flewdown from the tree and told Third Almafithat the enchantment had been placed onhim by Deceit, who owned a well ofenchanted water. If Third Almafi couldobtain a cupful of the water and spray thecockerel with it three times without thebird’s knowledge, the enchantment would bebroken and the prince would be himselfagain. Third Almafi leaped to his feet andasked the cockerel to point him in the direc-tion of the well, but the cockerel did notknow its whereabouts. However, the cock-erel told Third Almafi that he should travel tothe Talking Mountain, and it would give himthe directions he required. When ThirdAlmafi asked how he was to find the moun-tain, the cockerel told Third Almafi to tearoff a part of his crest, which would guidehim.Third Almafi did as he was told and setoff after the piece of golden crest, whichflew just ahead of him. For three days andthree nights Third Almafi traveled withoutrest until he reached a vast forest in themiddle of which rose a lofty mountain atwhose foothills the crest stopped flying.Third Almafi found a cave on the slopes ofthe mountain and entered. Inside was amarble slab inscribed with instructions onhow to awaken the voice of the mountain.Following the instructions,Third Almafi leftthe cave, uprooted twelve tall pine treesfrom the forest below, dragged them intothe cave, and set them afire.Then he waiteduntil the last embers died away,whereupon8ALMAFI"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the mountain spoke, telling Third Almafihow to find both the well of Deceit and thebeloved maiden of the cockerel prince.Almafi traveled three weeks to reach thewell, which was guarded by a twelve-headeddragon. Drawing his sword, Third Almafiquickly disposed of the vile monster andthen lay down to rest. When he awoke hefound that Deceit had bound him hand andfoot and thrown him into a deep dungeon.Third Almafi waited three weeks in thatdungeon before Deceit returned, surprisedto find the prisoner still alive although hehad had no food or water. Deceit movedcloser to Third Almafi to have a better look.Third Almafi, who had loosened his bondsearlier, now tore them off and quickly boundDeceit hand and foot with them.Then ThirdAlmafi carried Deceit out of the dungeon,built a huge bonfire, and burned Deceit todeath. Then Third Almafi drew water fromthe well and made his way back to where thegolden cockerel waited.When the cockerel asked Third Almafi ifhe had succeeded in his task, Third Almafisaid he had not. The cockerel dropped itshead in despair, and Third Almafi sprayed thewater over it three times, restoring the princeto his human form.The two of them then setout to rescue the prince’s beloved from herplace of imprisonment, which lay, as theTalking Mountain had told Third Almafi,beneath the sea, in a glass mountain.At the edge of the sea Third Almafidipped his head beneath the waves and sawthe mountain far offshore. Then, calling allthe animals of the sea to their aid, ThirdAlmafi had them raise the mountain to thesurface, for even he could not breatheunder water. When the mountain surfaced,Third Almafi hauled it ashore and smashedit with a single, carefully aimed blow. Themaiden stepped from the glass fragmentsand embraced the prince, and all three setoff for the prince’s kingdom, where ThirdAlmafi acted as best man at the wedding.Then Third Almafi set out to resume hisown quest.After a long journey he came to the footof an immense mountain and decided toclimb it so that he might spy the flyingpalace in the distance. Seven days later hestood on the summit, far above the clouds,and saw the flying palace heading straighttoward him. As it swept past, Third Almafisprang upward and landed in the courtyardof the palace. Quickly searching throughthe palace, which was deserted, ThirdAlmafi found the maiden chained to thebalcony. Using his great strength, he torethe chains apart, and he and the maidenembraced. Then Third Almafi asked herwhat had happened.She told him that her father, a king, oncehad the misfortune of wounding a terriblemonster.The monster swore that one day hewould steal away the king’s most preciouspossession—his daughter. For a long time shehad lived a virtual prisoner, but at length theking relaxed the guard and she was allowedto wander in the palace gardens. There, oneday, she had heard a humming in the air, andlooked up to see the flying palace headingdown toward her. As it swept overhead themonster leaned out and took hold of her.She had been a prisoner for three years.Although at first the monster had allowedher to wander through the hundred rooms ofthe palace, he had chained her after she triedto escape.Third Almafi searched the palace. In thehundredth room he came across the monsterfast asleep and woke him with a swift kick.The two wrestled, the monster managing tothrow Third Almafi only once before theyouth got the upper hand and smashed themonster’s head open. He returned to theembrace of the maiden, and together theypondered the manner in which they mightleave the palace, which at that moment wasflying on its two tremendous wings over awide sea. Third Almafi decided that whenthey were over land again he would simplycut off the wings with his sword.Some days later the maiden saw land inthe distance. As they drew closer the maiden9ALMAFI"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"recognized the land, and soon she caughtsight of her father’s palace. Waiting until theappropriate moment, Third Almafi cut thewings from the flying palace, which floatedto the ground next to the king’s. The kingcelebrated the return of his daughter, and alittle while later, he dispatched his messen-gers to bring Third Almafi’s mother, father,and brothers to the kingdom, where prepara-tions were being made for the marriage ofthe maiden to Third Almafi—who eventuallywould inherit the kingdom and would rulewith kindness, compassion, and wisdom.See also:Deceit; Dragon;Talking Mountain,TheReferences:Biro 1980ALYONKARussiaSeeAlenka.ALYONUSHKARussiaSeeAlenushka.ALYOSHARussiaThe son of a priest who was taught how toread and write by an old woman. One day,on his way home from his lessons, he passedthe palace of the local, unnamed tsar andpeered in through a window. There he sawthe tsar’s daughter, and as he watched, shetook her head from her shoulders, washedand dried it, and then replaced it. Alyoshawas astounded. He immediately realized thatthe princess was a witch. Worse for Alyosha,the witch had caught sight of him at thewindow and was plotting a way to keep hersecret.Feigning illness, the princess called the tsarto her bedside, eliciting his promise thatwhen she died he would have the son of thelocal priest stand guard over her coffin threenights in a row. The tsar gave his word, andthe very next morning the princess wasdead.The tsar went to the home of the priestand told him that Alyosha must sit vigilbeside the coffin of his dead daughter forthree nights, reading aloud from the Psalms.Alyosha knew that the witch had fakedher death. At his lessons that day he asked histeacher for advice. The old woman toldAlyosha how he might protect himself; andthus prepared, Alyosha went to the church asnight fell to begin his lonely vigil, first care-fully inscribing a circle in the stone floorwith a knife the old lady had given him. Atthe stroke of midnight, the lid of the coffinopened and the witch climbed out. She qui-etly made her way toward where Alyosha wasseated with his back toward the coffin, read-ing the Psalms. However, as the witchreached the circle, she stopped, and no mat-ter how hard she tried, she was unable tocross it; and so she spent the remainder of thenight clawing helplessly at Alyosha’s neck.Alyosha kept reading the Psalms and did notturn around, for turning would have brokenthe spell and he would have fallen prey to thewitch.As the first cock crowed, the witch ranback to the coffin and tumbled in, andAlyosha went home.The following night the very same thinghappened, but when the witch reached thecircle in the stone, she started to moutheerie sounds. As these sounds filled thechurch, a huge wind blew up inside thesanctuary, and Alyosha felt as if his bodywere being invaded by a thousand creepinginsects.Yet not once did Alyosha falter in hisreading of the Psalms, and not once did heturn around; and at daybreak the witch hadto return to her coffin.The third night came and Alyoshareturned to the church. This time he ham-mered nails into the coffin lid before sittingdown to read from the Psalms. At midnightthe lid of the coffin flew off and the witchsprang out, chanting strange spells that con-jured up all the demons of hell.

The firsttask the thieves gave their apprentice was tofetch water from a nearby well. However,when the Apprentice leaned over the welland dipped his pitcher into the water, hefound that he could not pull it out again.TheApprentice tugged with all his might, andthe pitcher came out of the water with a palewhite hand holding tightly onto it. Quick asa flash, the Apprentice took hold of the whitehand and began to pull. A shriek emanatedfrom beneath the surface of the water, fromwhich another hand appeared holding a fan-tastic golden goblet. Not wanting to lose thepitcher, the Apprentice released the hand andsnatched the goblet. He then made his wayback to the home of the thieves, the pitcherfull of water in one hand and the goblet hid-den under his shirt.The thieves were immensely surprised tosee their apprentice return, for no one hadever succeeded in drawing water from thewell before: Everyone who had tried hadbeen pulled under the water and drowned.When asked where he had got the water, theApprentice told his masters what had hap-pened at the well, finishing up by showingthem the goblet.Their eyes lit up when theysaw the goblet, for they instinctively knewthat it was priceless and that they should beable to sell it for enough to be able to retireand live in luxury for the rest of their days.All forty thieves and their apprentice setoff for the nearest city, and there they showedthe goblet to the city jeweler, who offered totake it to the king for an assessment of itsvalue. The thieves agreed. The jeweler thentook the goblet to the king, claiming that ithad once been his property but had beenstolen by a band of forty thieves and thatthose thieves now were trying to sell it backto him. The king lost no time in having theforty thieves and their apprentice broughtbefore him. The Apprentice told the kinghow he had come to have the goblet and saidthat he would bring his majesty eleven morelike it to prove that the jeweler was lying.The king agreed and freed the Apprenticebut detained the forty thieves in case theApprentice did not keep his word. Thethieves were thrown into the king’s dun-geons, and the Apprentice set out from thecity to find eleven more goblets just like theone from the well, although in truth he hadno idea where to go or what to do.After several days’ ride the Apprenticecame to a large city. There he found all thepeople shuffling around with sorrowfulexpressions etched on their faces. When theApprentice asked an old woman what theproblem was, he was told that the king’s onlyson had died and that every night his gravewas defiled and the people had to rebury thedead prince the following day. The Appren-tice quickly made his way to the palace andsought an audience with the king, tellinghim that he would guard the grave of theprince and ensure that it was never againtampered with.The king told the Apprentice that hewould give him whatever his heart desired ifhe could make that so. The Apprentice keptvigil over the grave through the night. On thestroke of midnight three doves flew down,settled by the grave, and discarded their feath-ers to become three beautiful maidens. Oneof the maidens took out a tablecloth and acrimson wand, and tapping the cloth, a ban-quet was instantly laid.Then the maiden wentto the gravestone and tapped it with thewand.The ground opened up, and the princestepped out of his grave and sat down to eatwith the three Dove Maidens.The Apprentice watched from his hidingplace, and then, taking careful aim, he fired14APPRENTICE, THE"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"an arrow at the Dove Maidens. The maidenshastily donned their feathers again and flewaway, leaving behind the tablecloth and thecrimson wand.The Apprentice made himselfknown to the prince, gathered up the clothand the wand, and had the prince return tohis grave, promising to release him fromdeath very shortly.When the king and his ministers came tothe grave in the morning they were de-lighted to find that everything was just asthey had left it the evening before. The kingwas even more delighted when the Ap-prentice struck the grave with the wand andthe prince climbed out and embraced hisfather. However, when the Apprentice askedfor eleven golden goblets just like the one hehad gotten from the well, the king told himthat one such goblet was worth more thanhis entire kingdom and that he could notgive the Apprentice what he wished.Saddened by this, the Apprentice would notaccept anything else from the king, andinstead he resumed his travels.After several days’ ride the Apprenticecame to another city, where he found all thepeople starving. When he asked the king ofthat city what the problem was, he was toldthat their food had to be brought to the cityby ship, but that whenever a ship entered theharbor, a hand would reach out from thewater and sink it.The Apprentice asked for asmall boat, and having provided a feast forthe entire city thanks to the tablecloth, herowed out into the harbor to await the nextconsignment of food.He did not have to wait long before a fleetof forty merchant ships sailed toward theharbor mouth. As the first ship entered theharbor, the Apprentice saw a pale white handrise out of the water, a golden braceletaround its wrist.The Apprentice took hold ofthe bracelet and pulled with all his might,and the bracelet slipped over the hand, whichthen disappeared beneath the waves. Whenall forty ships had been unloaded and thepeople of the city had collected their food,the Apprentice went to the king and askedfor eleven golden goblets as his reward. Theking said he could not grant the Apprentice’srequest but he did know where theApprentice might find such goblets.The following morning the Apprenticeset sail with one of the merchant ships, andafter a journey of seven days and sevennights they came to the island of the king ofthe houris. On the island was a beautifulpalace. The Apprentice walked boldly up toit, knocked on the door, and entered. Insidehe found an old man preparing a stew, anold man who told the Apprentice to hide, asthe houris would soon return, and if theyfound him there, they would tear him topieces.Sure enough, moments after the Ap-prentice had hidden, three white doves flewdown into the courtyard, discarded theirfeathers, and sat down to dine. During themeal the first houri toasted the Apprenticewho had managed to acquire her goldengoblet. The second toasted the Apprenticewho had secured her tablecloth and crimsonwand, and the third toasted the Apprenticewho now held her bracelet. When theApprentice heard these toasts in his name, hemade himself known and was welcomed totheir table.After they had eaten, the three houris satin sad and silent contemplation. When theApprentice asked them what was wrong,they told him that they had a brother whohad been taken captive by the giant Azrail,and that no one had ever been able to sethim free. The Apprentice said he would gladly perform this task if they would rewardhim with the eleven goblets he needed to setthe forty thieves free. They agreed and tookthe Apprentice to see their father, the king ofthe houris. When the king asked theApprentice what he needed to undertake hisquest, the Apprentice asked for a horse fromthe king’s stables, the use of the king’s sword,a bow and arrows, and a large steel mace. Soequipped, the Apprentice rode out to findthe lair of the giant Azrail, guided by theking’s chamberlain. After several days’ ride15APPRENTICE, THE"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"they came to the foot of Mount Djandjavaz,the home of the giant.Leaving the chamberlain at the foot ofthe mountain, the Apprentice rode onwardand upward until he came to a group ofhuge buildings.When he approached them,he found his way barred by the two hugeservants of Azrail; but having no time forthem, the Apprentice spurred his horse, andin one swift swing of his sword, decapitatedthem both. As their huge heads fell fromtheir shoulders, the Apprentice caughtthem and threw them onto an overheadbalcony. The noise awakened Azrail, whocame out to see what all the commotionwas about.When Azrail saw the Apprentice and thedead bodies of his servants, he roared a chal-lenge, quickly armed himself, and came outto meet the Apprentice carrying sevenmaces, seven swords, and a bow with sevenarrows. The Apprentice neatly dodged thefirst mace thrown by Azrail, picked it up, andhurled it back, telling Azrail to have anothergo.The giant threw all seven of his maces, allseven of his swords, and fired all seven of hisarrows, but they all missed the Apprentice.Seeing the giant totally devoid of weaponry,the Apprentice urged on his horse, and at thegallop, let fly with his mace, which caughtAzrail on the side of the head and knockedhim to the ground. In a flash, the Apprenticesliced off the giant’s head with his sword andthen cleaved it in two with a second mightyblow. The head pleaded to be cut in halfagain, but the Apprentice refused, for heknew that a third blow would restore Azrailto life.Instead the Apprentice tethered his horseand entered the home of Azrail, where hefound the son of the king of the hourisbound in chains. With a single swipe of hissword, the Apprentice set him free, and thetwo returned to the king of the houris. Enroute the houri prince told the Apprentice toask as his reward not only the goblets but alsothe hand of the prince’s youngest sister as hisbride, and the ring of the king of the houris.The Apprentice did as he was advised, andhe was duly rewarded and married. The fol-lowing day the Apprentice and his new wifereturned to the palace of the king who heldthe forty thieves in his dungeons, and pre-sented him with the eleven goblets. Seeingthat the jeweler had indeed been lying, theking summoned the jeweler and had himexecuted.

People lived in historic Armenia by6,000 B.C., the earliest societies there proba-bly being tribal groups that lived by farmingor cattle raising. In the eighth century B.C.,a union of several tribes formed the king-dom of Urartu, introduced irrigation, andbuilt fortresses, palaces, and temples. In thesixth century B.C., ancestors of theArmenians migrated, probably from thewest, to the Armenian Plateau, where theysettled alongside the native population. Thekingdom of Urartu was conquered by theMedes, a people from what is now Iran, inthe fifth century B.C.Soon after Urartu fell to the Medes, theMedes themselves were conquered by thePersians. Armenia remained under Persianand then Greek rule for hundreds of years,while managing to maintain a degree ofautonomy. King Tigran II, who came topower in 95 B.C., built an independentArmenian kingdom that reached from theCaspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea; butthe Romans defeated Tigran in 55 B.C., andArmenia became a part of the RomanEmpire. In the early third century A.D.,Armenia became the first nation to adoptChristianity as its state religion. TheArmenian alphabet was developed in theearly fifth century A.D. by an Armenian cleric, and in 451 the Armenians, underVartan Mamikonian, defended their religionagainst the Persians in the Battle of Avarair.Arabs conquered Armenia in the seventhcentury A.D., and in 884, an independentArmenian kingdom was established in thenorthern part of the region.

During this period, under Baian,their khagan, or khan, they were possiblythe greatest power in Europe, and tremen-dously influenced the later development ofa large part of Europe by driving most ofthe Western Slavs to the areas they haveoccupied ever since.

Baba-Yaga isusually portrayed as malevolent, butshe is occasionally a benefactress.Like most Russian witches, Baba-Yaga is an immortal shape-changer, atrue sorceress with a deep knowledge ofeverything in the world (the Russian wordfor witch,ved'ma,comes from the root ved',meaning “to know”). Baba-Yaga is the per-sonification of death; she is the Devil’s hand-maiden. She is never portrayed as a goddess,for she is far too earthly to be considered atrue deity. Yet in her earliest form, she dis-played an aspect of the Great Goddess, thepatron goddess of women, benevolent to all.Not until the Christian era was she down-graded to a fearsome witch, and even thenshe retained a wide following amongwomen.Post-Christian legends provide evidenceof the importance of Baba-Yaga to women.One story says that an old couple had adaughter but could find no godmother forher. After much searching, they found an oldwoman who said she would act as the child’sgodmother. This old woman then revealedherself as Baba-Yaga and spirited the girlaway to live with her.The girl later commit-ted some unrecorded crime against Baba-Yaga, who, rather than eating the child as shewould have done in pre-Christian stories,simply exiled her into the dark forest. Therethe girl was found by a prince who was outhunting. He took her back to his kingdom,where she subsequently bore him three sons,each with the moon and stars upon his fore-head. Learning of her goddaughter’s where-abouts, Baba-Yaga appeared, demanding thatthe three children be given her as expiationfor the girl’s misdeeds. She then made off notB"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24A turn-of-the-century illustration of the Russian witch Baba-Yaga (Sovfoto)"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"only with the children but also with theirmother. The prince, predictably distraught,set out to find them. After some time, hecame to a clearing in the forest. In the clear-ing a bright fire was burning around whichall manner of animals were gathered, block-ing his passage. In the center, next to the fire,sat Baba-Yaga with the prince’s wife andthree sons. The prince pleaded to be admit-ted, but the animals let him pass only afterthe prince’s wife asked Baba-Yaga’s permis-sion.The hag allowed the prince to carry offhis three sons but not his wife. As the storydeveloped, Baba-Yaga came to be equatedwith Mary, Mother of God, and the foresthome of the witch became the kingdom ofheaven.The oldest surviving stories of Baba-Yagasuggest that she is an ancient deity with ori-gins perhaps as long ago as Paleolithic times,when she was the patroness of herds andherdsmen, the goddess of horses, and thepatron goddess of farmers and farming. Heroldest personification, however, is as mistressof all animals, a bird goddess as reflected bythe chicken legs on her house, with whichshe is as one.Although unnamed in the story of Ivanthe Pea, the old crone who lives in the forestin a strange house that revolves in the windis none other than Baba-Yaga. In that storyshe is far from the malevolent witch; butmaybe even Baba-Yaga realized that shewould have been no match for Ivan the Pea.Almost every story about Baba-Yagadescribes her dwelling as a cottage in themost remote and inaccessible part of a deepforest, which makes her the khoziaika lesa(“mistress of the forest”).This cottage sits onfour sets of hen’s legs, one at each corner, andrevolves either freely in the wind or whensome unheard word is spoken. Some versionsof the legend say that the cottage was notfixed to the ground and could run around onits hen’s legs. Others say that the hen’s legswere simply supports for the four cornersand that the center of the house was fixed onthe spindle of a spinning-wheel, indicatingthat Baba-Yaga also spins the thread of lifefrom the bones and entrails of the dead. Anyhero who looked inside the cottage wouldbe likely to find Baba-Yaga crammed intoevery corner of the house, with her nosepressed hard against the roof.Descriptions of Baba-Yaga vary widely.Some describe her only as an old crone andleave the details to imagination. Othersdescribe her as an aged, ugly crone who isso emaciated that she is little more thanskin and bone. Her teeth are long and verysharp, occasionally made of iron, and some-times her canines are so long that they pro-trude over her lips. Her teeth need to besharp, for Baba-Yaga is a cannibal, one gazefrom her eyes usually being enough to pet-rify her victims—either turning them tem-porarily to stone so that she could takethem home, unpetrify them, and eat them,or simply immobilizing them with fear.Her hair is a tangled mass of writhingsnakes. This aspect, like her petrifying eyes,suggests a classical Greek influence, forthese are both essential attributes of theGorgon Medusa. Her nose and her breastsare made of iron. The bones of her victimsform the gate and fence that surround herhome, each post being adorned with ahuman skull, the eyes of which light up atnight.These bones are symbolic not only ofBaba-Yaga’s association with death but alsoof her role as the source of new life, whichshe brews from the bones of the dead. Hersoup often contains leftover body parts,such as fingers, toes, and eyes. The houseitself is also said by some to be made ofhuman bones, with legs for doorposts,hands for the bolts, and a mouth withrazor-sharp teeth for the lock. Others saythat these parts are associated only with thebone fence and that Baba Yaga’s houseresembles any other peasant hut—apartfrom its chicken leg supports.In her benevolent guise, Baba-Yagaappears as a normal, aged peasant womanwith luxuriant hair and a kindly face and dis-position, and as often as not, wears the tradi-25BABA-YAGA (-JAGA, -IAGA)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"tional headdress of a married woman. Herdualistic aspects are not as clearly defined asmight be expected. Baba-Yaga is animmensely complex character who is per-haps best described as triune rather thandualistic, each of her three aspects perhapsbest equated to the three Fates of classicalGreece. In her first aspect, as a fertility god-dess, she is benevolent, bringing new life intothe world. In her second aspect she maps outthe course of human life and is both benev-olent and malevolent. In her third aspect shedetermines the date of human death, the rolein which she is most commonly regarded. Inher triune state, Baba-Yaga hovers over thebirth of every new life, immediately threat-ening to take it back again. She has thepower to send life into the earth and to recallit. She is the most terrible of the regenerativefertility deities, for she appears prone to fitsof passion and whim. She demands the sacri-fice of a child in return for wealth, for she,like the classical Pluto, controls all the richesof the earth. Baba-Yaga is thus a chthonicearth deity who encompasses life from con-ception through birth and life to death, andbeyond—although her role in the under-world is merely that of guardian: Accordingto her pleasure, she may redistribute souls tonewborns or keep them in the underworldfor all eternity, never to be reborn.Some commentators insist that thebones around Baba-Yaga’s house indicatethat she has a very strong connection withthe spirit world. Some even go so far as tosay that her house guards the point wherethe two worlds—the world of the livingand that of the dead—meet. This mayexplain why in some cases she is benevo-lent to humans, her purpose being not tosend people into the afterlife but rather,like the Greek Cerberus, to stop the deadfrom escaping. Others say that she is a por-trayal of the gates of hell themselves, lyingin wait for her victims with her jaws agape,swallowing any who are unfortunateenough to seek shelter in her mouth withits razor-sharp iron teeth.Baba-Yaga possesses truly awesomepower, for time itself is in her hands: TheSun, the Day and Night, obey her implicitly,as do all the laws of nature. She controls theweather, an aspect she shares with Russianwitches in general, and can devour the sunand moon, cause crops to grow or perish, andregulate the flow of milk from cows in thesame way as she regulates the rainfall. Shealso has connections with the leshii, for she,like the wood sprite, kidnaps small childrenand wields power over the forest and the ani-mals that live in it. In another aspect she isregarded as the guardian of the fountain thatsupplies the Water of Life and Death. Sherides through the air in a mortar instead ofthe customary broomstick of the pan-European witch, propelling herself forwardwith a pestle and brushing away all evidenceof her passage with a birch broom.The mor-tar and pestle represent the destructive andthe protective aspects of Baba-Yaga, forSlavic peoples traditionally used these imple-ments not only to grind grain (the destruc-tive aspect) but also to prepare flax for spin-ning (the protective aspect). Perhapsunsurprisingly, the mortar and pestle alsorepresent the human reproductive organs.Thus, the two objects are symbols of all threephases of human life—birth, life, and death—and thus of all three aspects of the triunedeity. All evidence of Baba-Yaga’s passagethrough human lives is swept away with abirch broom—a broom that may be regardedas further evidence of her all-pervadinginfluence, a symbol of the inverted Tree ofLife, reaching downward. Baba-Yaga ridesthe skies generating and nurturing life beforesweeping it away again with the broom. Aswould befit a powerful fertility deity, Baba-Yaga has hordes of children, although theirnames are never revealed. They are all asstrange as their mother—from the reptiles,animals, and spirits that cohabit with her, toher forty mare-daughters.The mare-daughters appear in one storywhere a young man is told that he musttravel to Baba-Yaga’s home to secure a horse26BABA-YAGA (-JAGA, -IAGA)"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"that will help him release his bride MariaMorena, who has been taken prisoner bysome unnamed captor.When the young manarrives at the home of the witch he is con-fronted by the bone fence that surrounds it.On closer inspection, however, the youngman sees that one spike on the fence has noskull on top. As he is inspecting the fence heis confronted by the witch, who informs himthat the last picket has been reserved for hisskull, although he can escape death andobtain what he came for if he completes asimple task—controlling the forty mare-daughters for twenty-four hours. Needless tosay, the hero of this story completes the task,receives a supernaturally empowered steedfrom the witch, and completes his quest tofree his bride.Although Baba-Yaga may essentially beregarded as a feminine deity, she is equally athome in the world of men. She carries awand with which she can transform herselfand those at whom she directs its power, andshe rules over the male genitalia. She is alsomore likely to appear in her benevolent guiseto men than to women. She owns a fire-breathing, flying horse, giving her an aspectas the horse goddess, as well as a self-directing, self-cutting sword, both itemsbeing more readily lent to men than towomen. She also will lend other, femininearticles to deserving youths, such as mirrors,rings, and balls of yarn. Baba-Yaga is also thepatroness of wandering minstrels, for sheowns a self-playing guslithat some allude toas the first instrument of the type ever made.With links to the werewolf and vampire,Baba-Yaga and her kind, the volkhvy (seers),would perform their chief rites and causethe most trouble at midsummer, the sametime that the female elders of villages wouldgo into the fields at night to look for medi-cinal herbs and other plants. Baba-Yaga isthe wolf goddess who devours all who try toenter her sphere. She induces nightmaresand hallucinations as well as deadly diseases,all three relating to her role as the goddess ofdeath and the underworld. She also is asso-ciated with the bear, who sometimesreplaces her in the role of master of the for-est, and the serpent—both animals to befeared and respected. She demands humansacrifice from her supplicants in return forthe sustenance of life.In Russian legend, Baba-Yaga is closelyassociated with serpents and dragons. Kosh-chei the Deathless, whose name derives fromkost'(“bone”), is a dragon in human guise,his destiny and all he does guided by thedualistic aspects of Baba-Yaga. She conferson him immortality but also gives him asoul, thus making him mortal. Baba-Yaga isalso the controlling force behind the multi-headed, fire-breathing dragon Chudo-Yudo,who sits watch over the Water of Life andDeath, a role that has often led Chudo-Yudoto be considered a bizarre offspring of thewitch and thus a brother to the forty mare-daughters.In Belorussia, Baba-Yaga and her associ-ates are held to drain the energy of the sunwith their magical fires, destroy plants, andturn the power of the earth against mankind.Thus, in this region at least, Baba-Yaga andher sisterhood are seen as being in control ofthe elements of the earth. If humanity doesnot please or placate them, then Baba-Yagaand her kind will use their awesome powersto turn the earth itself against those it ismeant to support.One particular story, that of Vasilissa theBeautiful, clearly demonstrates both themalevolent and benevolent sides of Baba-Yaga and her powers. In this story the witchassigns the poor girl impossible tasks, tellingher that she will be eaten if she fails; butwhen Vasilissa has completed all of the tasks,Baba-Yaga gives her a magical skull that ridsher of her cruel stepmother and stepsisters.Another story about a Vasilissa—Vasilissa theWise—demonstrates the compassionatenature of Baba-Yaga: In this story the witchtells Ivan the Young how he might regain hiswife,Vasilissa the Wise, and keep her forever.See also:Chudo-Yudo; Day; Devil,The;Dragon; Great Goddess; Ienzababa; Ivan the27BABA-YAGA (-JAGA, -IAGA)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Pea; Ivan the Young; Jazi Baba; Jezda; Khoziaikalesa; Koshchei (the Deathless); Leshii (~y);Maria Morena; Moon; Night; Sun;Tree of Life,The; Underworld,The;Vampire;Vasilis(s)a theBeautiful;Vasilis(s)a the Wise;Volkhv;Water ofLife and Death,The;WerewolfReferences:Afanas'ev 1974, Baroja 1964; Dal'1957; 1957, and 1865–69; Matorin 1931;Newell 1973; Snegirev 1839;Wosien 1969;Zemtsovskii 1970BAB'E LETORussiaIndian summer (literally, “old woman’s sum-mer”), a period of the Russian agrarian cyclethat started officially on Saint Simon’s Day (1September), after the harvest, and culminatedin the Pokrovskaia Subbota in October.Bab'e leto was marked by several significanthousehold events: Old fires were extin-guished and new ones laid and lit by the mis-tress in honor of the ancestral spirits.

As each son came of age, theking sent him off to a distant land to provehis worth and find a wife. Finally it wasBadikan’s turn to be likewise dispatched.TheKing gave him a sword, a bow and arrows,money and servants, and a magnificent horse,and then gave Badikan his blessing and senthim on his way.Badikan traveled far and wide. He crossedthe Kingdom of Darkness and the Kingdomof Light. He did battle with Agog-Magogand the demon Aznavor, overcoming themand many other beasts both natural andsupernatural. However, his servants all werekilled in these battles and his money wasspent by the time he reached an enormouspalace. The palace had been built in a timebefore man walked upon the earth, and itwas so large that it would have taken Badikana week to scale its walls.As he wondered who might own such abuilding, the sun was blotted out by theshape of an enormous giant making its waytoward the palace, a giant with armor ofsteel, a casque (helmet) and shoes of bronze,and a bow and arrows of wrought iron. Asthe giant reached the gates to his castle hestopped, sniffed, and proclaimed that hecould smell human flesh. Unafraid, Badikanstepped out of the shadows and made him-self known to the giant. The giant in turnintroduced himself as Khan Boghu.Badikan replied that he had heard of KhanBoghu and had traveled to his land to do bat-tle with him. Khan Boghu laughed and toldBadikan that if he were that great a warrior,perhaps it would be better if they becamefriends. Badikan laughed and agreed that hewould live with the giant as his companion.The following morning Khan Boghu toldBadikan that he had a problem with whichBadikan might be able to help. In theKingdom of the East there lived a kingwhose daughter was the most beautifulmaiden in all the world, and Khan Boghuhad fallen in love with her. If Badikan couldbring him the maiden, Badikan would berewarded. Badikan assented, and armed andprovisioned by Khan Boghu, he set off.In the Kingdom of the East, Badikanfound employment as a gardener in thepalace gardens, and there he caught his firstglimpse of the princess. Immediately he wassmitten by her beauty, and she too, guessingthat he was far more than a gardener, fell inlove with Badikan. However, as the city washeavily fortified to protect it against attack,Badikan could not hope to escape with theprincess. She, however, said that she wouldtravel beyond the city walls, and there shewould allow Badikan to abduct her.Thus it was that several days later theprincess left the city with a retinue of fortyhandmaidens. Badikan waited until the partywas crossing a river in single file, and then heswooped down, plucked the princess fromher mount, and sped off into the mountainswith her, hiding her safely before returning29BADIKAN"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"to dispose of the soldiers sent by her father totrack them down.The princess was overjoyed to be in thecompany of Badikan, but her joy turned todespair when Badikan admitted that he hadabducted her at the request of Khan Boghu.However, the princess gained a stay of mar-riage when she told Khan Boghu that shehad promised her parents that she wouldrefrain from marrying for seven years—adelay that Khan Boghu gladly consented to.From then on both the princess and Badikanconspired to discover why Khan Boghuremained invulnerable to all weapons.The princess settled into a routine ofappearing loving and caring toward KhanBoghu, and it wasn’t long before KhanBoghu lapsed into a false sense of security.One night, while Khan Boghu was glowingin the light of the princess’s compliments, hedropped his guard and told her that he couldnot be killed because he did not carry hisseven souls with him.Those seven souls werehidden inside seven sparrows that could notbe caught.The sparrows, in turn, were secureinside a mother-of-pearl box that could notbe opened, and the box was inside a fox thatcould not be caught. If that were not enough,the fox was inside an ox that could not beovercome, and thus he was safe for all time.When Khan Boghu went hunting the fol-lowing day, the princess told Badikan how hemight find Khan Boghu’s soul and thus killhim. When Khan Boghu returned, Badikanasked whether he might be allowed to travelon an adventure, promising to return whenhe had satisfied his need, for he was boreddoing nothing in Khan Boghu’s palace. KhanBoghu consented, and Badikan made hisfarewells to the princess and set off on hisfabulous horse.His first stop was at the home of a groupof sorcerers who told him that the ox couldbe overcome with seven barrels of strongwine. So equipped, Badikan rode for manydays until he found the huge ox. Hidingbehind some rocks, Badikan left the sevenopen barrels of wine in the open, and whenthe ox had drained them and had fallen intoa drunken stupor, Badikan leaped forwardand cut off its head. As the head fell, KhanBoghu, who was out hunting, stumbled andfell, and instantly he knew that the princesshad betrayed him and the ox was dead. KhanBoghu staggered to his feet and hurried backto his palace as quickly as he could, consid-ering the pain he was suffering for the veryfirst time. Seeing him coming, the princessfled to the rooftops, fully intending to throwherself to her death if the need arose.Badikan, meanwhile, had cut open the ox,caught the fox by its tail, and cut off its head.As the head rolled from the fox, blood beganto flow freely from Khan Boghu’s nose.Badikan then cut open the fox, took out themother-of-pearl box, and broke its lock. Asthe lock broke, Khan Boghu began to coughup blood. Badikan then let out the sevensparrows. He strangled the first two, andKhan Boghu fell to his knees. He strangledtwo more, and Khan Boghu’s arms and legsgrew numb. He strangled two more, andKhan Boghu’s heart and liver burst. ThenBadikan caught the last sparrow and crushedit in his hands, and as he did, all life left KhanBoghu in a cloud of black smoke.Badikan then hurried back to theprincess. A few days later they were married,and for the rest of their days they ruled KhanBoghu’s domain together.This story should be compared with thatof Koshchei the Deathless, for he too had hissoul hidden outside his body so that hemight remain invulnerable, and like KhanBoghu, he was tricked by a woman’s wilesinto revealing his secret.See also:Agog-Magog; Aznavor; Boghu,Khan; Kingdom of Darkness,The; Kingdomof Light,The; Kingdom of the East,The;Koshchei (the Deathless)References:Khatchatrian 1933BADNIKRussia —Novgorod ProvinceThe name given to the log ritually burnedto bring the Koliada festivities to a close.30BADNIK"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The burning of the log symbolized deathand rebirth, the sun, and the ancestors of thepeople.See also:KoliadaReferences:Afanas'ev 1869BAGPUTYSLithuaniaA sea god who is particularly associated withstorms, Bagputys rides the choppy seas in aboat with a golden anchor.BALD MOUNTAINSRussiaA mountain range near Kiev.

The pluralform of the name refers to the lands thatmake up the region: Slovenia, Croatia,Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Mon-tenegro, Albania, continental Greece, south-east Romania, Bulgaria, European Turkey,and the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia. The peninsula is linked to therest of Europe by an isthmus that is 750miles (1,200 km) wide between Rijeka onthe west, and the mouth of the river Danubeon the Black Sea to the east—a strategicallyimportant route from the MediterraneanSea to the Black Sea.The Balkans have been inhabited since c.200,000 B.C. By the seventh millenniumB.C., a distinctive Stone Age culture hadevolved in the region.The peninsula was set-tled around 3,500 B.C. by seminomadicfarmers from the Russian steppes, and later,sometime during the Bronze Age (c.2,000–500 B.C.), by Celts.The Slavic peoplesfirst arrived in the region around the thirdcentury A.D., and migrated to the peninsulain large numbers in the sixth century. Therethey were joined by Bulgar tribes during theseventh century, the Bulgars eventuallyassimilating with the Slavs. Slavic, Magyar,and Germanic settlements evolved in com-parative isolation due to natural barriers ofcommunication, and as a result, each of thesegroups developed its own religion, language,and customs. All suffered periodic persecu-tion by the Turks. During the Byzantine era(395–1453), a form of Orthodox Chris-tianity was established in parts of theBalkans, while Islam spread in those regionsheld by the Turks. From the late Middle Ageson, the Ottoman Turks gradually took con-trol of almost the entire peninsula; but thebalance of power in the Balkans changedagain after the siege of Vienna (1683), whenthe Ottoman Turks were driven back by theAustrian Habsburgs and by Russia, bothpowers seeking access to the seas surround-ing the peninsula.In the nineteenth century, one Balkannation after another developed strongnationalist movements, forcing Turkey toconcede a degree of autonomy to each con-stituent nation. The Balkan League of 1912was formed to counter Turkish rule in thearea, and this led to the Balkan Wars. Twoyears later Pan-Slavism contributed to theoutbreak of World War I when the heir pre-sumptive to the Austrian emperor was assas-sinated at Sarajevo by a young Serbiannationalist named Gavril Princip. AfterWorld War I ended in 1918 and theOttoman Empire was dismantled, Bosniaand Herzegovina, Croatia, Slavonia, andCarniola united with Serbia and Mon-tenegro to form the Kingdom of the Serbs,Croats, and Slovenes, which was laterrenamed Yugoslavia.See also:Black Sea; Bosnia; Bulgaria;Croatia; Danube; Herzegovina; Macedonia;31BALKAN(S)"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Magyars; Montenegro; Romania; Serbia;SloveniaBALTICGeneralName given to a sea and a geographicalregion.The Baltic Sea is a large, shallow armof the North Sea that lies between theScandinavian peninsula and the northerncoast of Europe.

TheBaltic Sea has an area of approximately160,000 square miles (414,000 square kilo-meters). It is about 950 miles (1,530 kilome-ters) long and around 400 miles (640 kilo-meters) across at its widest part.The name Balticalso is used to refer col-lectively to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.Before 1918, these three countries wereruled by Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Ger-many, and Russia, but each maintained itsown language, literature, and traditions. TheBaltic lands were part of the Russian Empireuntil the Russian Revolution of 1917deposed the tsar and made it possible for thethree nations to assert political autonomy.Soviet forces occupied the three indepen-dent Baltic states in 1940 and annexed themto the Soviet Union. German troops invadedthe Baltics in 1941, during World War II, butthe Germans were driven out by the Sovietsin 1944 and 1945.

However, the king’sdaughter interceded, and the king allowedher to hear their stories and be their judge.She listened to what both Haron andBaron had to say, and then went to herfather, told him that she believed that theyposed no threat, and asked that her fathershould call upon Loqmân the Wise torestore Baron’s sight. This he did, and whenBaron could see again, he pleaded with theKing to take him out and hang him, as hecould not stand to look Haron in the faceafter the way he had treated him.

He taught rhetoric in Caesarea for ashort time but soon followed his family intoreligious life, visiting holy sites and monas-teries in Spain, Egypt, and Palestine beforesettling as a hermit on the shores of the riverIris at Annesi in 358.

He is eter-nally opposed by Chernobog, the BlackGod, who represents the forces of evil and isthe cause of all misfortune. Belobog—as theWhite God was called in the Balkan lands (inRussia, he was known as Belun)—was usu-ally represented as a venerable old man witha flowing white beard, dressed in whiteclothes. He roamed the countryside duringthe day, doing works of kindness—curingsick animals, seeing to it that a hunter madea good kill, finding lost items, or ensuring agood crop. Belobog and Chernobog are twoof the oldest Slavic deities. They might wellhave originated with nomadic peoples inwestern Asia or the Himalayas, being closelyrelated in character to Ahura Mazda andAhriman in ancient Persian myth; but theyalso have counterparts in almost every cul-ture around the world where beliefs in theduality of good and evil are found.See also:Belun; Black God; ChernobogBELORUSSIAGeneralOriginally part of the Russian empire,Belorussia, or “White Russia,” traces its his-tory back to Kievan Rus'.

Bessarabia is bordered by the DniesterRiver to the north and east, the Black Seaand Danube River to the south, and the PrutRiver to the west. Russia gained Bessarabiafrom the Turks in 1812. Southern Bessarabiawas awarded to the historical principality ofMoldavia in 1856, at the end of the CrimeanWar (1853–1856), but was regained byRussia in 1878. After World War I, Romaniacontrolled Bessarabia until 1940, when theSoviet Union seized the region during WorldWar II. Romania reoccupied Bessarabia in1941, but the Soviet Union regained the ter-ritory toward the end of the war. Bessarabiathen became part of the Moldavian andUkrainian republics of the Soviet Union.The Moldavian Republic was renamed theMoldovan Republic in 1990, and in 1991,the Soviet Union was dissolved, andMoldova and Ukraine became independentcountries.See also:Black Sea; Danube; Moldavia;Moldova; Romania; UkraineBIRD’S WAY, THELithuaniaAlternative name for the Milky Way, theheavenly bridge that the spirits of the deadcross to reach their eternal home, the moon.See also:Milky Way,The; MoonBLACK GODSlavThe literal English translation of the Russianname Chernobog(a compound of the wordschernyi,meaning “black,” and bog,“god”).The personification of evil, Chernobog isopposed by Belobog, the White God, whopersonifies goodness.See also:Belobog; Chernobog;White GodBLACK MIRERussiaA foul swamp that lay on the road betweenChernigov and Kiev and that sucked in any-one who attempted to cross it.

The SudetenMountains form Bohemia’s northeasternboundary, and the Bohemian Mountains theregion’s western boundary. Most Bohemiansbelong to the Slavic grouping known asCzechs. The first known inhabitants ofBohemia were the Boii, a Celtic tribe thatlived in the region during the fourth centuryB.C., from whose name Bohemia is derived.The Czech word for Bohemia,Cechy,refersto the Czechs, who had settled in the regionby about A.D. 500. In 1158, EmperorFrederick I of the Holy Roman Empire gavethe title of king to the Duke of Bohemia.Bohemia reached its political and culturalpeak in the 1300s, when Charles IV(1316–78) ruled as king (from 1346, he alsowas the elected king of Germany, and after1355, Holy Roman emperor).A period of civil wars began in 1419, fol-lowing the execution of John Hus, aBohemian religious reformer. Called theHussite Wars, these were chiefly religiousconflicts in which Hus’s followers foughtloyal Roman Catholics. The two sides man-aged to reach a compromise in 1436, afterwhich most Bohemians gradually becameProtestants. Bohemia came under the rule ofthe Catholic Habsburg family in 1526. TheBohemian Protestants overthrew the Habs-burgs in 1618, but the dynasty regainedpower in 1620 and subsequently ruledBohemia for almost 400 years, during whichtime Bohemia lost most of its religious andpolitical freedom. Beginning in the late eigh-teenth century, Czech leaders in Bohemiaworked for a rebirth of patriotism and cul-ture. A revolt in 1848 was unsuccessful.In 1918, following the conclusion ofWorld War I, Bohemia became a province ofthe new independent republic of Czecho-slovakia until the government of Czecho-slovakia abolished the country’s provinces in1949. In 1992, after the Soviet Union col-lapsed and many nations of eastern Europehad reasserted political independence, thestate of Czechoslovakia was voted out ofexistence and the independent countries ofthe Czech Republic and Slovakia were cre-ated in its place. Bohemia became a region inthe Czech Republic.See also:Czechoslovakia; Czechs; SlovakiaBORIS, SAINTRussiaRussian Orthodox saint who according tosome legends was a smith who, along withSaint Gleb, forged the first plow.

Following the collapse of theRoman Empire, first the Goths and then theSlavs conquered the territory. Various pettySlav princes ruled the area until the twelfthcentury A.D., when Hungary made the areaone of its dominions. The Hungarians latermade Bosnia a banat(province) under thecontrol of a ban(viceroy). Ban StephenKrotomanic extended Hungarian authorityover the principality of Hum (also known asZahumlje), later known as Herzegovina.Krotomanic’s nephew and successor StephenTvtko further extended the boundaries, andin 1376 proclaimed himself king of Serbiaand Bosnia. The kingdom began to disinte-grate after the death of Tvtko, and a rebel-lious Bosnian chieftain seized the Humregion early in the fifteenth century andestablished it as Herzegovina, which means“independent duchy.” By 1463 the OttomanEmpire had conquered most of Bosnia, andHerzegovina fell to them in 1483. The twoterritories remained provinces of theOttoman Empire for the next 400 years,although unsuccessful uprisings against theTurks occurred frequently during the nine-teenth century.The population of the area includedRoman Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs, andMuslims (Slavs who converted to Islam duringOttoman rule) by the late nineteenth century.Unrest among the various ethnic groups, cou-pled with the increasing deterioration of theOttoman Empire, led to a general decline ofthe area. During the Congress of Berlin in1878, the double monarchy of Austria-Hungary negotiated with other Europeanrulers for administration rights over the area,and by 1908 it had annexed the two provinces.Austro-Hungarian rule did little to quell theethnic tensions in the region. Bosnia became acenter of nationalist agitation for politicalindependence and cultural autonomy. Europebegan to take sides in the disputes: Austria-Hungary and Germany opposed the growingSerbian nationalism, and Russia and GreatBritain partially supported it.In June 1914 the heir to the throne ofAustria-Hungary, Archduke Francis Ferdi-nand, and his wife were assassinated inSarajevo by Gavril Princip, a Serb studentfrom Bosnia.This act precipitated World WarI.

Hungary’scapital and largest city. Tree-lined boulevardsand wide squares bordered by modern build-ings make today’s Budapest one of the mostbeautiful capitals of Europe. The city consistsof the community of Buda on the west bankof the Danube and the community of Pest onthe east bank. Built on a terraced plateau,Buda contains ruins dating from the Turkishoccupation, including the former royal palacesituated on the summit of the plateau, at thebase of which are famous medicinal springs.Pest stands on a plain and is the site of theHouses of Parliament (opened in 1896), theAcademy of Sciences, the Museum of FineArts, the Palace of Justice, the Eötvös LorándUniversity (1635), the Custom House, andthe National Museum. Buda and Pest arelinked by six bridges over the Danube,including one of the largest suspensionbridges in Europe.About 10 B.C. the Romans established thecolony of Aquincum on the present site ofBuda and near that of an earlier settlement.In A.D. 376 invading Vandals conqueredAquincum. During the next 500 years Slavs,Avars, and others settled on the sites of Budaand Pest, and in the latter half of the ninthcentury the Magyars took the towns. In1241, during the Tatar invasion of Hungary,Pest was destroyed. In 1247 King Béla IV ofHungary repopulated Pest with Germansand colonists of other nationalities and estab-lished the city of Buda. Buda became thecapital of Hungary and the home of the royalcourt in 1361, while Pest became a leadingcommercial center. During the Turkish inva-sion of Hungary, Pest was taken in 1526 andBuda in 1541. When the Turks were drivenout in 1686 by a league of states under theleadership of Austria, both cities were almostin ruins. Because of the commanding posi-tion of Buda and Pest on the Danube andtheir resultant economic importance, therecovery of both cities was rapid. Both Budaand Pest continued to grow during the eigh-teenth century and made an extraordinaryadvance during the period preceding the lastdecade of the nineteenth century.In the mid-nineteenth century, Hungar-ian patriots made Pest a center of culture andpolitics, and in 1848 Pest became the capitalof Hungary. In 1873, Buda, Pest, Obuda, andMargaret Island were united to form a newcapital city, which was christened Budapest.See also:Avars; Danube; Hungary; Magyars;Slovakia;TatarsBULATTatarOne of a pair of heroes who appear in apoem engaged in mortal combat each other,the other hero being Ak Molot.

Thinking nothing of this, Ivanwalked away from the market square; butBulat ran up to him, thanked him for savinghim, and told him that if he had not helpedhim, Ivan never would have found the girlVasilissa Kirbit'evna, who was prophesied tobecome his wife.To fulfill his destiny, Ivan followed Bulatthe Brave’s instructions exactly.The pair rodea great distance until they came to the landof Tsar Kirbit. There, in a tower, just as hadbeen foretold, they found the maiden.Purchasing some chickens, ducks, and geese,Bulat told Ivan to have them roasted and tohand him a wing whenever he returnedfrom trying to capture the girl. Bulat thenwent to the tower and threw a stone toattract the attention of the girl, cracking thegilded roof of the tower in the process.Running back to Ivan, Bulat had him givehim a chicken wing and then returned to thetower, where he offered it to VasilissaKirbit'evna.Three times Bulat did this, each timeoffering the girl the wing he carried, first ofchicken, then of duck, and finally of goose.As the maiden leaned out of the window totake the last wing offered, Bulat grabbed her,and the three made away as fast as theirhorses would carry them. The followingmorning, when Tsar Kirbit saw the damageto the tower and found his daughter missing,he and a number of his men gave chase.Sensing their approach, Bulat pretendedto have lost his ring and told his companionsto continue on their way while he returnedto look for it. Vasilissa Kirbit'evna tried todissuade him by giving him her own ring,but although Bulat accepted the offeredring, he still returned along the route theyhad followed. Coming across his pursuers, hekilled all but the tsar before returning to hiscompanions.Tsar Kirbit returned home and gatheredtogether twice as many men. Bulat the Braveonce again sensed their approach, and thistime pretending to have lost his scarf, hereturned and dispatched them all, leavingonly the tsar alive to return home. Knowingthat his daughter was lost to him forever,TsarKirbit gave up the chase and returned hometo mourn her.As night fell Bulat, Ivan, and VasilissaKirbit'evna made their camp. Bulat told Ivanthat he would scout the area and orderedhim to stay awake and watch over themaiden. Ivan managed to stay awake half thenight but fell asleep soon after midnight.When Bulat woke him in the morning thegirl was nowhere to be seen. Bulat scoldedIvan, telling him that Koshchei the Deathlesshad abducted her and that they would haveto search for her.After several days’ ride they came across aherd of cattle being tended by two men.Having discovered from one of the herdsmenthat the cattle belonged to Koshchei, theykilled the men and dressed in the herders’clothing before driving the herd back towhere Koshchei lived.In order to maintain her beauty in such adreary place,Vasilissa Kirbit'evna had taken towashing her face in goat’s milk morning andnight. As Bulat and Ivan drove the cattle intothe yard a maid was just filling a cup with thegoat’s milk for Vasilissa Kirbit'evna. Bulatslipped the girl’s ring off his finger and slylydropped it into the milk. When VasilissaKirbit'evna found the ring she immediatelyknew who the two herdsmen were andrushed out to greet them.

He replied that she had noneed to be frightened, for he did not carryhis soul with him. It was hidden in a broomin the kitchen. When Vasilissa Kirbit'evnatold Bulat this, he knew that Koshchei waslying, so he told the girl to be even morecunning.That evening, when Koshchei returned,Vasilissa Kirbit'evna presented him with thebroom, finely decorated, as a gift, telling himthat his soul was too precious to leave lyingaround. Koshchei laughed. He then told herthat his soul was in fact inside the goat thatprovided the milk she washed in.Again Bulatknew he was lying, so Vasilissa Kirbit'evnapresented Koshchei with the goat, elabo-rately decorated. Koshchei once againlaughed, and told her that his soul was not inthe goat but rather in an egg, inside a duck,inside a hare, under a huge oak on a remoteisland in the middle of an endless ocean.When Vasilissa Kirbit'evna relayed this toBulat, he knew that at last Koshchei had toldthe truth. Immediately he and Ivan set offthe find the island. En route they grew dan-gerously short of food. Coming across a dog,they made to kill it. The dog pleaded formercy, saying that he would be of use tothem. Bulat set the dog free. Next they cameto an eagle, and the same thing happened.On the shore of the ocean they met a lob-ster, and exactly the same thing happenedagain.Crossing the ocean took many days, butfinally they came to an island on which a sin-gle, huge oak tree grew. Bulat unearthed thetree with ease, and the hare jumped out andran away. Instantly the dog they had sparedappeared and caught the hare. Out of thehare the duck flew high into the sky, whereit was pounced upon by the eagle Bulat andIvan had spared. Out of the duck fell the egg,which rolled into the sea, whence it wasrecovered by the lobster. Having Koshchei’ssoul in their possession, Bulat and Ivanreturned to Vasilissa Kirbit'evna. Thatevening, when Koshchei returned, they con-fronted him and smashed the egg on hisforehead, killing him.Ivan returned to his homeland, where hemarried Vasilissa Kirbit'evna in fulfillment ofthe prophecy and made Bulat the Brave hismost trusted friend and adviser.See also:Ivan; Koshchei (the Deathless);Vasilis(s)a Kirbit'evnaBULGARIAGeneralA country of southeastern Europe that isbounded to the north by Romania, to thewest by the former Yugoslavia, to the southby Greece, to the southwest by Turkey, andto the east by the Black Sea. In ancienttimes, as the Roman province of MoesiaInferior, the territory comprised Thraceand Moesia. It was inhabited by theThraco-Illyrians. Beginning in the sixthcentury A.D. Slavic tribes migrated into theregion and either absorbed or drove out theoriginal inhabitants. In the latter half of theseventh century, the region was conqueredby the Bulgars (a people of Turkic stock),who migrated from their domain on theeast side of the Black Sea, crossed the lowerreaches of the Danube River, and subjugat-ed Lower Moesia, then a province of theByzantine Empire. Imperial armies failedrepeatedly to dislodge the invaders duringthe eighth century. Fewer in number thanthe Slavic population of Lower Moesia, theBulgars gradually became Slavicized duringthis period, and by the end of the centurythey had annexed considerable additionalterritory and laid the foundations for astrong state under Khan Krum, whoreigned from 803 to 814.The Krum armiesinflicted a devastating defeat on an invadingByzantine force in 811 and almost suc-46BULGARIA"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ceeded in taking Constantinople in 813.Bulgarian-Byzantine relations were there-after relatively peaceful and continued tobe so during the first half of the ninth cen-tury. Khan Krum’s immediate successorsenlarged their dominions, mainly in theregion of Serbia and Macedonia. However,in 860, during the reign of Boris I(852–889), Bulgaria suffered a severe mili-tary setback at the hands of the Serbs. Fouryears later Boris, responding to pressurefrom the Byzantine emperor Michael III,made Christianity the official religion ofthe khanate (865). Boris accepted the pri-macy of the papacy in 866, but in 870, fol-lowing the refusal of Pope Adrian II (pope867–872) to make Bulgaria an archbish-opric, he shifted his allegiance to theEastern Orthodox church. Under his son,Simeon (893–927), the country became aleading power. In the eleventh centuryBulgaria came under Byzantium’s rule, andeven though a second independent Bul-garian empire was founded in the four-teenth century, Bulgaria formed a part ofthe Ottoman Empire for almost 500 years,until it became an independent kingdom in1908. The term Bulgar may be correctlyused to refer to any of the invaders fromAsia who entered the region in the seventhcentury and conquered and subjugated theSlav population.In the late ninth and early tenth centuries,during the reign of Boris’s son Simeon,Bulgaria became the strongest nation in east-ern Europe. A brilliant administrator andmilitary leader, Simeon introduced Byzan-tine culture into his realm, encouraged edu-cation, obtained new territories, defeated theMagyars, and conducted a series of successfulwars against the Byzantine Empire. In 925Simeon proclaimed himself emperor of theGreeks and Bulgars. The following yearSimeon conquered Serbia and became themost powerful monarch in contemporaryeastern Europe. Simeon’s reign was markedby great cultural advances led by the follow-ers of Saint Cyril and his brother SaintMethodius, the “apostles to the Slavs.”During this period the Cyrillic alphabet wasadopted, and the language known today asOld Church Slavonic became the first writ-ten Slavic language.Weakened by domestic strife and successiveMagyar raids, Bulgarian power declinedsteadily during the following half century. In969, invading Russians seized the capital andcaptured the royal family, but the followingyear the Byzantine emperor John I,Tzimisces,alarmed over the Russian advance into south-eastern Europe, intervened in the Russo-Bulgarian conflict. The Russians were com-pelled to withdraw from Bulgaria in 972, andthe eastern part of the country was annexedto the Byzantine Empire. Samuel, the son of aBulgarian provincial governor, became rulerof western Bulgaria in 976; but Samuel’sarmies were annihilated in 1014 by theByzantine emperor Basil II, who incorporatedthe short-lived state into his empire in 1018.Led by the nobles Ivan and Peter Asen, theBulgarians revolted against Byzantine rule in1185 and established a second empire. Itconsisted initially of the region between theBalkan Mountains and the Danube, but bythe early thirteenth century it includedextensive neighboring territories—mostnotably, sections of Serbia and all of westernMacedonia. In 1204, following the Latinoccupation of Constantinople, Ivan’s andPeter’s brother Kaloyan (reigned 1197–1207)temporarily broke with the Eastern Ortho-dox church and accepted the primacy of thepope.

Some historians tracethe origin of the Cossacks to serfs who fledthe principality of Moscow in the fourteenthand fifteenth centuries A.D. and establishedwheat-growing and stock-raising communi-ties in the valleys of the Dnieper, Don, andUral Rivers and in Siberia.The name Cossackderives from the Turkish word kazak,whichmeans “free person.” The individual Cossackcommunities, like other Russian peasantcommunes of the time, owned land in com-mon. These communities were governed byvillage assemblies that were presided over byelected village elders called atamans or het-mans.The chief atamanor hetmanof a regionenjoyed great power and prestige, exercisingthe authority of a military leader in times ofwar and that of a civil administrator inpeacetime.In the sixteenth century, as the tsarsextended their realm, the Cossacks were sub-jected to the authority of the Russian gov-ernment, which tried to incorporate theminto the state on the same basis as the otherinhabitants of the country. As subjects of thetsar, all Cossack males aged between 18 and50 became eligible for military service.Theywere most often conscripted as members ofthe cavalry. Cossack horsemen becamefamous in the wars of the tsars against theTatars in the Crimea and the Caucasus.The Cossacks, however, cherished theirtradition of freedom, which frequentlybrought them into conflict with the tsars. Inthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries theCossacks, supported by peasants, engaged intwo widespread revolts (1670–71 and 1773–74) in the lower Volga Valley. In later years theRussian tsars used the Cossacks as bordertroops and as a special military and policeforce for the suppression of internal unrest.In the latter nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies the tsarist government usedCossack troops to perpetrate pogroms (orga-nized massacres, from grom—“thunder”)against Jewish people. Cossack troops wereemployed on a large scale in the suppressionof the Russian Revolution of 1905, but theyrefused to be used for the same purpose dur-ing the Revolution of 1917.During the civil war that followed the1917 Revolution, the majority of Cossacksfought against the Bolshevik armies.

Cossack soldierswere relieved of their special military andpolice duties, and Cossack cavalry units wereprohibited. Cossacks were forced to engagein collective farming. Many were deportedfrom their lands and resettled in Kazakhstanor in Siberia. Nonetheless, Cossack customsand traditions continued to be practiced inseveral parts of Russia during the Sovietperiod, particularly in the regions of the Donand Kuban' Rivers.During the last years of the USSR,Cossack organizations experienced a suddenrevival. In 1990, Cossack associations wereformed in traditional Cossack areas of theRussian south including the lower reaches ofthe Don River, the North Caucasus, and theUral Mountains. The same year, a nationalunion of various Cossack associations wasfounded in Moscow. After the USSR wasdissolved in 1991, the movement spread toareas outside traditional Cossack lands, sothat by the end of 1992, Cossack associationshad appeared in several large northern cities,such as St. Petersburg and Moscow.See also:Black Sea; Caucasus; Dnieper; Don;Kazakhstan; Moscow; Siberia;Tatars;VolgaCRIMEAGeneralThe Crimea is a peninsula in southernUkraine that juts out into the Black Sea andthe Sea of Azov.

During theseventh century the Carpathian Croatsousted the Avars and were in turn con-quered by the Franks. Later the region wasmade into a duchy. Croatia was an indepen-dent kingdom from 925 until the end of theeleventh century, when a period of anarchyled to intervention by Hungary. Except forperiods of occupation by the OttomanEmpire, most of what is today the Republicof Croatia was an autonomous kingdomwithin the Habsburg Empire from 1102until the Hungarian revolution of 1848–49.Dalmatia and Istria were dominated for atime by Venice and France, respectively.After the Hungarian revolution, Croatia andSlavonia became separate Austrian crownlands. In 1867 the Austrians and Hungarianscreated the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary from the Habsburg Empire, andCroatia was assigned to the Hungariancrown the following year. Croatia gained itsautonomy and was formally joined withSlavonia in 1881.During World War I, Croats and Serbsfought side by side, hoping to create a king-dom that would unite all of the South Slavs.On 1 December 1918, following the over-throw of the monarchy of Austria-Hungaryat the close of the war, Croatia became partof the independent Kingdom of the Serbs,Croats, and Slovenes under the Serbianmonarchy of King Alexander I. When con-flict between Croats and Serbs led to greaternational tensions, Alexander tightened con-trol over the country, and in 1929 herenamed the kingdom Yugoslavia (“Land ofthe Southern Slavs”). Tensions between thetwo ethnic groups continued, however, andthe postwar history of the state was markedby the struggle of the Croats for greaterpolitical autonomy. Croatian extremistsassassinated Alexander in 1934, and the fas-cist movement Ustasˇa began to garner sup-port among discontented Croat peasants.

Later, Cyril taught atthe same university in Photius’s place, whileMethodius became the provincial governorof the Slavic colony of Opsikion.In 861 the two brothers were sent byByzantine Emperor Michael III (“theDrunkard”) to convert the Khazars, a Tatarpeople of Russia who tolerated all faiths andwhose ruler practiced Judaism. When theyreturned from this mission, Methodiusbecame the abbot of a Greek monastery andCyril went back to teaching. However, in863, Rostislav, Duke of Moravia, wrote tothe patriarch of Constantinople, Photius,requesting missionaries who could teach hispeople. Photius sent Cyril and Methodiusbecause of their knowledge of the Slaviclanguage.The most significant achievement ofthese two brothers was their invention of theGlagolitic alphabet that is still used in a fewisolated locales and that became the basis ofthe Cyrillic alphabet, which probably wasthe work of a later disciple. Due to thisinvention as well as their translations ofmany passages from Scripture and Christianliturgy, the brothers are regarded as thefounders of Slavic literature.They won manySlavs to the eastern Catholic rite due totheir knowledge of the language. Eventually,however, as they began to encounter stiffopposition from German bishops and mis-sionaries, Cyril and Methodius withdrew toRome, where they were received with hon-ors by Pope Adrian II.Cyril became a monk and adopted thename Constantine, by which he is com-monly known, but died a short time after-ward (869) and was buried at San Clementein Rome. Methodius was consecrated asbishop of Moravia but later was imprisonedfor two years, for his continuing oppositionto German bishops. He was released uponthe intervention of the pope, but in 879 hewas called to Rome to answer charges ofheterodoxy. Pope John VIII cleared him ofthe charges and appointed him bishop ofSimium and Moravia with express papal per-mission to celebrate mass in the Slavic lan-guage.

The peoplelacked a written alphabet, however, so themissionaries devised for them a unique sys-tem of writing known as Cyrillic, from thename of one of its inventors, St. Cyril. (Cyriland his brother St. Methodius, also known asthe Apostles to the Slavs, are often creditedwith having created this alphabet.) TheCyrillic alphabet, like its Latin counterpart,has Greek roots, being based on the ninth-century uncial script. Additional characters,however, were devised to represent Slavicsounds that had no Greek or Latin equiva-lents. The Cyrillic alphabet originally con-sisted of 43 letters.Various smaller versions ofthis alphabet are currently used in Russia (32letters), Ukraine (33 letters), Serbia (30 let-ters), and Bulgaria (30 letters), but not inPoland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, orSlovenia, where modified Latin alphabets areused. An interesting division exists in theBalkan countries, where the RomanCatholic Croats use the Latin alphabet butthe Greek Orthodox Serbs employ Cyrillicfor the same language.Appendix 2 shows the modern Cyrillicalphabet as used in present-day Russia, alongwith its most common English transliteration.See also:Bulgaria; Cyril and Methodius,Saints; Czechs; Poland; Serbia; Slovakia;Slovenia; UkraineCZECHOSLOVAKIAGeneralA state in central Europe from 1918 until1992.

Several tribesunited to form a state in the ninth centurythat became the core of the Great MoravianEmpire, which soon covered much of centralEurope. Hungarian tribes conquered theempire in 907 and ruled Slovakia for nearly1,000 years.In 1212, Bohemia became a semi-independent kingdom within the HolyRoman Empire, a German-based empire inwestern and central Europe. In 1526, theAustrian Habsburgs began ruling Bohemia,which during the ensuing decades graduallylost most of its powers of self-governance. Inthe late eighteenth century Czech intellectu-als began actively to encourage a nationalidentity among their compatriots.

Some stories, howev-er, say that Dazhbog married Mesyats, whoin this case would be female, and that theirunion begot the stars. Occasionally the gen-ders of Dazhbog and Mesyats are reversed,making Dazhbog the sun goddess, andMesyats the moon god.

Dazhbog then becameincreasingly identified with Lucifer, thebearer of God’s light who fell from the sky toouter darkness.Polish belief held that Dazhbog lived inthe east, in a paradise of milk and honey, aland of eternal sunlight, whence he rode outeach new morning in a golden chariot withdiamond wheels that was drawn by twelvewhite, fire-breathing horses (some accountssay that his chariot was drawn by threehorses—one of gold, one of silver, and oneof diamonds).

The youth then begs to be sparedfrom the clutches of Death, whereupon Timetells him to drink of a well in the distance,for the water of the well will free him of hisfear so that he might live his life to thefullest, though not in his own hometown.The young man drinks from the well, asinstructed.

One particular leg-end shows that the Devil could also have acompassionate nature, provided he wasshown the respect he thought he deserved.An unnamed smith once saw a frighten-ing image of the Devil in a local church.Upon returning to his smithy, he commis-sioned a painter to re-create the likeness onthe doors to his workshop. For ten years healways gave the Devil a cordial greeting as hecame to work and bade him a good nightevery evening as he left.After the smith died,his son inherited the smithy, but the youthswore never to show something so hideousthe respect his father had. Instead he used tohit the image with a large hammer, squarelybetween the eyes, every time he passed it. Forthree years the Devil withstood these insults,until he could bear it no longer.Transforming himself into a young man,he went to the smithy, where he asked to bemade the smith’s apprentice. Having beentaken on, the Devil soon proved his worthand was often left to mind the forge. Onone such occasion the aging wife of a locallandowner came to the smithy to have herhorse shod.The Devil told her that they hadjust started a new line of business, the reju-venation of old people. The vanity of theold woman got the better of her, and shepaid the Devil in advance to renew heryouth.Gathering two pails of milk, the Devil tookhold of the woman in his tongs and cast herinto the middle of the furnace. When all thatwas left were her bones, the Devil removedthese from the fire and placed them in a tub.He then poured the milk over the still crack-ling bones, and within a few minutes a youngwoman stepped forth. Returning to her hus-band, she persuaded him to go for the sametreatment.When the old man arrived at the smithy,the Devil had gone and the smith was backat the forge.

However, if the soldier broke any ofthese rules even once, then the Devil wouldhave his soul.The soldier agreed, and had the demonbring him a sack of money and then trans-port him to Moscow in a flash.There the sol-dier quickly bought a wonderful mansionand settled down to pass the next fifteenyears in splendid isolation.

Thesoldier duly presented himself to the tsar, hishair and beard touching the floor in a mattedmass, his nose constantly running, and hisclothes in the most disgusting state. Worst ofall was the smell, which was nauseating.The tsar offered the old soldier the rank ofa general in his army in return for a large sumof money. The soldier politely refused thepost, but promised to give the tsar all themoney he needed if one of the tsar’s threedaughters would become his wife. The tsarinstantly agreed and called for his oldestdaughter to be brought to him. However, assoon as she saw the hideous apparition beforeher, the girl said that she would rather marrythe Devil—a comment noted by the demonwho had struck the deal with the soldier.The tsar’s second-oldest daughter wasbrought in, and she retorted in exactly thesame manner, and her name likewise wasnoted by the demon. Finally, the tsar’syoungest daughter was brought into the hall,and although her initial reaction was one ofdisgust, she knew that her father was depend-ing on her.Thus, with tears rolling down herfair cheeks, she agreed to marry the soldier.Preparations for the marriage were soonin full swing, and the tsar had collected hisgold, when the fifteen years the soldier hadagreed to came to an end. The demon cameto the soldier, and unable to convince thesoldier to continue in the service of theDevil, restored him to his former self, andthen rejuvenated him with the Water of Lifeand Death. Shortly afterward, the soldier andthe tsar’s daughter were married.The demon returned to his master andreported all that had happened. The Devilwas furious to think that fifteen years’wealth had been wasted on the soldier andthat in return he did not even possess thesoldier’s soul. His anger subsided, however,when he learned that the two elder daugh-ters of the tsar had said they would rathermarry the Devil than the soldier.The Devilrubbed his hands in glee and waited until indue course he was able to add their souls tohis vast collection.See also:Moscow;Water of Life and Death,TheDEVIL’S CASTLEArmeniaThe lair of Tapagöz, the oldest of the demons.See also:TapagözDIDASlavThe female counterpart of Dido, the pairlikely to have been twins born to the deitiesLada and Lado.See also:Dido; Lada; LadoReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Znayenko 1980DIDILIAPolandOne of a pair of fertility deities, the otherbeing Zizilia.

As soon as he enteredthe swiftly flowing waters, he saw fire andsparks leap into the air, accompanied by thickblack smoke. Out of this smoke emerged thetwelve-headed she-dragon Goryshche—thedragon whose offspring Dobrynya had pre-viously killed.As the dragon asked Dobrynyawhat she should do with him, the knight sawhis chance and dived beneath the waters,coming ashore on the bank opposite that onwhich his clothes and weapons lay, his horse69DOBRYNYA NIKITICH"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"having been frightened away when thedragon appeared.Just as he thought he was finished,Dobrynya caught sight of a priest’s hat lyingin the grass.

Asthe dragon flew toward him, Dobrynya bran-dished the hat and severed the dragon’sheads. As the dragon dropped to the ground,Dobrynya leaped onto her and readied him-self to finish her off. Goryshche begged formercy, promising never to raid the lands ofHoly Russia again and never to carry off anymore Russian people. Dobrynya likewisepromised never to return to the SorochinskMountains.Then he released the dragon.Having lost his horse and his weapons,Dobrynya had to make his way home toKiev on foot. When he arrived there hefound that in his long absence a disaster hadbefallen the court of Prince Vladimir BrightSun. The very dragon whom Dobrynya hadspared had broken her word, and flying overthe city, had carried away the PrincessZabava,Vladimir’s favorite niece, holding herbetween her jaws.Vladimir Bright Sun calledtogether his knights and challenged them torescue the unfortunate maiden.Alesha, the son of the priest Leontii, toldVladimir that Dobrynya appeared to befamiliar with the dragon that was responsi-ble, adding that he believed that the dragonregarded Dobrynya as her brother. WhenVladimir Bright Sun heard this, he com-manded Dobrynya to bring back the girl orbe beheaded.Dobrynya went home and told his mother what had transpired, complainingthat he would have to walk to the Soro-chinsk Mountains because he had no horse.His mother told him of his father’s old chest-nut, which stood mired in dung inside thestables. Telling her son to clean up the horseand feed it, she also advised him to get agood night’s sleep. Dobrynya followed hismother’s advice to the letter, and the follow-ing morning, he mounted the chestnut andmade ready to leave. Just as he was about tospur the horse on, his mother gave him asilken whip, telling him to whip the horse,should its strength begin to fail.Placing the whip in his pocket, Dobrynyaspurred the horse, which cleared the walls ofthe city in a huge leap and sped off fasterthan the eye could follow. In no time at all,they had reached the foothills of theSorochinsk Mountains. There the groundteemed with the young of the she-dragon.Dobrynya set upon them, trampling themwith his horse. After a while, having beenbitten badly, the horse began to falter.Remembering the words of his mother,Dobrynya took the whip from his pocketand gently whipped his mount between theears and hind legs. Instantly the horse’s vigorreturned, and they made their way to thecave of the she-dragon.Needless to say, Goryshche was not happyto see Dobrynya. She complained bitterlyabout the death of her offspring, and evenmore so about the fact that Dobrynya, aknight of Holy Russia, had broken his word.Dobrynya retorted that it was she who hadfirst broken their pact, and he demanded thereturn of Zabava. When the dragon refused,Dobrynya attacked her. For three days thepair fought, until finally Dobrynya was vic-torious. However, Dobrynya now foundhimself stranded in the middle of a vast lakethat had formed from the dragon’s blood, alake that the earth would not soak up.Calling on Mother Earth, he commandedher to open up and swallow the dragon’sblood. Instantly a huge chasm appeared andthe lake was drained. Dobrynya climbeddown from his horse and entered the net-work of caves in which the dragon hadlived.

When his mother, AmelfiaTimofeyevna, asked him what was wrong, hereplied that it was long past the time whenhe should have married but that all of theeligible maidens of the city had already beenspoken for. His mother told him that if hewere ever to find a bride, he would have totravel beyond the confines of the city—anidea that immediately appealed to Dobrynya.Even if he failed to find a wife, he was sureto have some adventure.As Dobrynya left for the stables, his mother called after him, telling him to leavehis own horse Voroneyushka behind andinstead to take the horse that had belonged tohis father, which had served him well in hisquest to find the Princess Zabava. Dobrynyafollowed the advice of his mother, and armedhimself before riding out from the city ontothe steppes. A short time later he came acrossthe tracks of another rider and hurried afterthem. Having ridden hard for a short distanceDobrynya spotted a polianitsa(female war-rior) spurring her jet-black steed across theplains. Dobrynya quickly strung an arrow inhis bow and let it fly.The arrow flew straightand true and struck her on the side of herhelmet. Instead of hurting the rider, thearrow simply fell to the ground, and thewoman rode on as if nothing had happened.Dobrynya let a second arrow fly, with exactlythe same result; but the third arrow hit thewoman’s helmet again and caused her to stopand look around. Seeing Dobrynya, she liftedhim from his horse by his hair and thrust himinto a deep pouch that she always carriedwith her; and for three days he brooded therein silence as they rode across the steppes. Onthe fourth day the woman’s horse stumbledand complained that it could no longer con-tinue to carry a polianitsaand a bogatyr'.The woman immediately climbed downfrom her horse and took Dobrynya out ofher pouch, demanding to know who he was.She said that if he were older than her, shewould kill him; if he were younger, shewould consider him her brother; and if theywere the same age, she would marry him.Dobrynya refused to tell the woman any-thing, but the horse had recognized him andtold the woman that his name was DobrynyaNikitich and that he was the same age as thewoman. The latter then told Dobrynya thather name was Nastas'ya Nikulichna and thatas they were the same age, they should marry.Dobrynya agreed, and the two of them rodeback to Kiev.Dobrynya’s mother, the widow AmelfiaTimofeyevna, welcomed the woman, andbefore long a great wedding had beenarranged, which would be attended byPrince Vladimir Bright Sun and his wifeEvpraksiya. For three days and three nightsthe wedding feast continued, and thenDobrynya and his new wife Nastas'yareturned to live with Amelfia Timofeyevna.After her marriage, Nastas'ya stayed at home,like any other Russian wife.Some three years later Prince VladimirBright Sun arranged a great banquet in Kievand invited all the bogatyri to attend. As thebanquet drew to a close, Vladimir addressedthe knights present, asking which of themwould lead an army against the forces of anenemy who had attacked his father-in-law,the King of Lithuania. At first none of theknights responded, so Vladimir asked thequestion a second time. This time AlyoshaPopovich stood and told the prince thatthere was none better qualified to serve thepurpose than Dobrynya Nikitich, who hadonce served in the army of the King ofLithuania. Reluctantly Dobrynya agreed, andhe went home to prepare for the comingexpedition.There his mother questioned him aboutwhat he was doing, and with great reluctanceDobrynya told her of his mission, telling hernot to worry; for if he were killed, he would71DOBRYNYA NIKITICH"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"join his late father, Nikita, in heaven andwould see her there one day. AmelfiaTimofeyevna blessed her son and then ran totell Nastas'ya, her daughter-in-law, ofDobrynya’s impending departure. Nastas'yaran to her husband, who told her about hismission, adding that she should wait for himfor 12 years, and that if he had not returnedby that time, she should divide his wealthequally between the church and the poorand then seek a new husband. However,Dobrynya advised her that she should notmarry Alyosha Popovich, for the two menhad exchanged crosses and were thus broth-ers in the eyes of God.With that Dobrynya kissed his wife,mounted his horse, and left for Lithuania.Three years passed and Dobrynya did notreturn home. News of his death was broughtto Kiev by Alyosha Popovich. AmelfiaTimofeyevna wept for her son, but Nastas'yarefused to accept the news and continuedher long vigil.Three more years passed, and AlyoshaPopovich once more rode into Kiev andbrought news of the death of DobrynyaNikitich, and again Nastas'ya refused tobelieve him.Six more years passed before AlyoshaPopovich came back to the court of PrinceVladimir Bright Sun, again bringing news ofthe death of Dobrynya Nikitich. This time,although Nastas'ya did not believe her hus-band was dead, she knew that she had hon-ored his wishes, and so she agreed to marryAlyosha Popovich.Thus the city of Kiev pre-pared for the marriage of Alyosha andNastas'ya, while at the Lithuanian borderDobrynya Nikitich slept a long and deepsleep.As he awoke, two white doves flew intohis tent and spoke of the wedding arrange-ments being made at that very moment inKiev. Hearing the news, Dobrynya quicklygathered his possessions, mounted Voro-neyushka, and rode like the wind all the wayback to Kiev. There he was joyfully reunitedwith his mother. Then he dressed as a min-strel and went to the palace to serenade thewedding guests. There, seated on the stove,the customary location for minstrels andbeggars in the palace, Dobrynya sang songsin celebration of the marriage.So touched was Nastas'ya by the min-strel’s songs that she asked permission ofPrince Vladimir Bright Sun to give him adrink. The prince agreed. Having acceptedthe drink from his wife, Dobrynya askedpermission of Prince Vladimir Bright Sun toreturn the compliment. Vladimir gave per-mission, and Dobrynya gave Nastas'ya a cupof mead into which he had slipped his wed-ding ring. As soon as Nastas'ya found thering, she fell to the floor and begged herhusband’s forgiveness.The banquet fell silent at the sight of thebride begging the forgiveness of the minstrel,but it soon became apparent that the minstrelwas none other than Dobrynya Nikitich,returned from Lithuania. Prince VladimirBright Sun welcomed him warmly, but allDobrynya could think of was how he hadbeen betrayed by his brother in God, AlyoshaPopovich. Having forgiven his wife—for shecould not have known the truth—Dobrynyaturned to Alyosha, who also begged forgive-ness. Dobrynya rejected Alyosha’s pleas, andgrabbing him by the neck, threw him to theground, drew his sword, and raised his arm tostrike—but was prevented from doing so bythe great Il'ya Muromets. Dobrynya sheathedhis sword and left the palace with his wife,refusing from that day forth to speak toAlyosha, and for the rest of their livesDobrynya Nikitich and Nastas'ya Nikulichnalived in peace and happiness.See also:Alesha; Alyosha Popovich; Amelf(i)aTimofe(y)evna; Bogatyr'; Dragon; DunaiIvanovich; Evpraksiya (~ia), Princess;Goryshche; Il'ya Muromets; Kiev; Leontii;Lithuania; Mother Earth; Nastas'yaNikulichna; Polianitsa; Puchai; SorochinskHill;Vladimir Bright Sun, Prince;Voroneyushka; Zabava (Putyatichna), PrincessReferences:Astakhova 1961; Evgen'eva andPutilov 1977; Gil'ferding 1951; Rambaud187972DOBRYNYA NIKITICH"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"DODOLASerbiaGoddess of rain, propitiated in times ofdrought by dressing a girl from head to footin grass, herbs, and flowers so that even herface was hidden.

Svarog drove themfrom his realm, whereupon they fell to earth,some into backyards, some down chimneysand into stoves, some into forests, and someonto the plains. Each group was domovoi,and each had the same characteristics; but73DOMOVOI"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"over the years those outside the home disap-peared or were assimilated with other spirits,leaving a single race of domovoi.Very few people claim to have caught aglimpse of the domovoi, although everyonehas heard him in the creakings and groan-ings of their house.Those who say they haveseen this spirit describe him as a dwarfish,aging man covered with a long beard andsoft, silky fur, even on the palms of his handsand the soles of his feet.The only parts of hisbody visible through this downy coveringare his piercing eyes and his pointed nose.Sometimes he would also be depicted withhorns and a tail, but he was usually con-ceived of according to peasant lore, as ananimated haystack. Less approachable andmuch shier than the domovoi was thedvorovoi, the spirit of the household yard,who might have been a descendant of thedomovoi.Although mischievous, the domovoiwould never harm the family with whom helived unless he was offended in some way.During daylight hours the domovoi stayedhidden or used his shape-changing abilitiesto disguise himself as an animal while heroamed the fields and woods. At night hewould return to his human hosts’ home, eat-ing the bread and salt that were left out forhim, or upsetting pots and furniture if he feltin any way ill treated.One story concerning the domovoi tellsof two peasants who lived next door to eachother. One owned horses that were well fedand well groomed, whereas the neighbor’shorses were sickly and thin. Wishing to findout why his horses were so much finer thanthose of his neighbor, the peasant hid atnight and caught the domovoi grooming,feeding, and watering his horses from thelarge water cask in the yard. The followingday, not wanting his drinking water supplyto be contaminated by an ugly spirit, heasked his jealous neighbor what he shoulddo. The neighbor knew that a domovoi wassurely helping this lucky fellow, and keen tosee him reduced to the same terms as him-self, he suggested that the man drill a largehole in the cask. He could then plug thehole during the day but let all the water outat night. The man foolishly followed thisadvice, and when the domovoi came towater the horses he found the cask empty.Enraged, he smashed the stables to piecesand killed all the horses.The importance of the domovoi wasreflected in the fact that every time themaster of the house left, his wife wouldensure that the mouth of the stove was cov-ered so that the domovoi did not leave aswell. Later traditions said that the domovoilived not only in the stove but also in thecattle sheds and stables, for he was particu-larly fond of farm animals. At night hewould feed the horses and then comb andgroom them, neatly plaiting their manesand their tails. Every time the peasantbought a new animal he would lead itaround the yard to make sure that thedomovoi approved of his purchase, andwould ask the domovoi to welcome thenewcomer to his home.

Theyare usually described as serpentine in shape,as was the twelve-headed dragon dispatchedby Dobrynya Nikitich. Other accounts, espe-cially those from the era of byliny, tell ofdragons with the head of a serpent and thebody of a man, and flying on a winged horse,as did the dragon killed by Ivan the Pea tofree his sister Vasilissa of the Golden Braid.Although many Russian tales of dragonsdate from pagan times, the creatures contin-ued to be associated with Christian knightsand legends and are still popularly believedto be the cause of many natural phenomena.Eclipses of the sun or moon were taken to becaused by a dragon, their reappearance show-ing that even a dragon could not withstandtheir power—a reassuring sign that dragonscould be defeated by righteous people.Dragons were not the most intelligent ofcreatures and were easily tricked, as illus-trated by the following story of the dragonand the gypsy:A gypsy once wandered into a village theday after a particularly ferocious dragon haddevoured all of the inhabitants save one.This survivor pleaded with the gypsy toleave before the dragon reappeared; but asthey were talking, a huge shadow fell overthem and the dragon landed right beforetheir eyes.When the monster made toward thegypsy, the fellow held up one hand and toldthe dragon that it would choke if it tried toeat him, for he was far stronger than thedragon. The dragon scoffed at this and sug-gested a test. Picking up a millstone, he pro-ceeded to crush it into a fine powder. Thegypsy applauded the dragon and then askedwhether the creature could make water runfrom a stone. The gypsy picked up a muslinbag full of cream cheese and began tosqueeze the whey from it.Impressed, the dragon thought that itmight be better to befriend the gypsy; so itasked him to bring back the fattest oxen hecould find in the field for their dinner. Thegypsy knew that he was not strong enoughto do that, so he herded the cattle into oneend of the field and began to tie their tailstogether.When the dragon came to see whythe gypsy was taking so long, the gypsy toldhim that he thought it better to drag backthe whole herd, for then they would notneed to fetch any more food for a long time.Impatiently, the dragon skinned a large ox,threw it over his back, and carried it back tothe village.Having filled two cooking pots with freshmeat, the dragon gave the ox hide to the75DRAGON"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"gypsy and told him to go to the well and fillit with water and then bring it back. Thegypsy had trouble carrying the skin to thewell, but once there, he started to dig a chan-nel around it. Once again the dragon grewimpatient and came to see what the delaywas. The gypsy explained that he thought itbetter to bring back the whole well, for thenthey would never run out of water. Thedragon, anxious to eat, filled the ox skinhimself, carried it back, and poured the waterinto the cooking pots.Now they needed firewood. The dragonsent the gypsy into the forest to collect alarge oak tree. There the gypsy began tomake a rope from the bark of the trees,which he had wound around twenty trunksby the time the dragon came to see what wastaking so long. Again the gypsy explainedthat he thought it far better to bring twentytrees than a single one, for then they wouldnever run out of firewood. The dragonlaughed, tore up a huge tree, and strode backto the village and built a huge fire under thecooking pots. Soon the dragon began to eat,but the gypsy pretended to sulk and refusedto eat.When the dragon asked why he was sulk-ing, the gypsy replied that the only way hewould know that they were true friendswould be if the dragon would come to meethis family. The dragon agreed, and hitchedthree fine horses to a large cart, and the pairdrove back to the gypsy camp. There theywere greeted by the gypsy’s naked children,who ran noisily around the cart.The dragonasked who these children were, and thegypsy replied that they were his children,hungry as usual, and what a fine meal theywould make of the dragon.With that, the dragon leaped down fromthe cart and hurried away, never again toattack a human. The gypsy sold the horsesand the cart, and he and his family livedcomfortably on the proceeds for many years.See also:Alesha; Bylina; Dobrynya Nikitich;Il'ya Muromets; Ivan the Pea;Vasilis(s)a of theGolden BraidD'U-URTFinno-Ugric —VotyakThe soul of the grain, which is protectedwhile the grain is growing in the field byBusi-urt, the soul of the grain field.See also:Busi-urt; UrtDUGNAISlavAn unusual, though important goddess withbut a single responsibility—to make doughrise.DUNAI, RIVERRussiaAncient Russian name for the Danube.Slavic legend describes how the river Dunaiformed from the blood of Dunai Ivanovich.See also:Danube; Dunai IvanovichDUNAI IVANOVICHRussiaA knight, or bogatyr', who offered to under-take a quest to secure the daughter of theKing of Lithuania as the bride of PrinceVladimir Bright Sun. Dunai Ivanovich madethis offer during a banquet at which theprince complained that he was the onlyunmarried man present. The knight offeredto travel to Lithuania, accompanied only byhis friend Dobrynya Nikitich (also abogatyr'), to bring back the PrincessEvpraksiya for Vladimir. For their mission,Vladimir offered them forty thousand menand ten thousand pieces of gold, whichDunai refused. Instead he asked for anunbroken stallion for each, with bridles andwhips that had never been used, and a letterstating their mission. So equipped, the tworode from Kiev to Moscow and then on toLithuania. Arriving at the court of the Kingof Lithuania, Dunai left Dobrynya in chargeof the horses and entered the great hall,where he was cordially greeted.However, when Dunai explained the pur-pose of their visit, the mood very quicklychanged, for the King of Lithuania had apoor opinion of Vladimir Bright Sun. He76D'U-URT"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"also scolded Dunai for seeking the hand ofhis younger daughter in Vladimir’s behalf,instead of that of his elder daughter. Just as hewas about to have Dunai dragged off to thedungeons, one of the king’s men rushed intothe hall to tell the king that Dobrynya wasbludgeoning the king’s men to death.Takingthis as a divine sign, the king quickly agreedto the suit and bade the three of them a safejourney.That night, as they slept, they heard sus-picious sounds nearby but were notattacked. The following morning Dobrynyaand Princess Evpraksiya rode off towardKiev, while Dunai tracked down the banditthat had been stalking them the previousnight.When he caught up with the stranger,he knocked him from his mount anddemanded to know where he was going.Looking down, Dunai saw that the personhe had knocked from the saddle was awoman.This woman told Dunai that she wasPrincess Nastas'ya, Evpraksiya’s elder sister.She had been hunting when Dunai andDobrynya left with her sister, and she had setout in pursuit, aiming to rescue her sisterfrom her abductors. So taken was Dunaiwith her courage that he spared her life andasked her to become his wife. Quickly theyrode to Kiev, and they were married at thesame service at which Vladimir marriedEvpraksiya.The wedding feast lasted twelve days,during which time a great many boastswere made. Dunai Ivanovich boasted that inthe city of Kiev there was none who couldcompare with him. His new wife chidedhim, saying that even though she had onlybeen in the city for a short time, already shehad noticed that Churilo Plenkovich wasthe best-dressed man in all Russia andAlyosha Popovich was the most valiant.However, now that she had arrived in Kiev,there was no finer archer in the city thanherself. Dunai rose to the boast and chal-lenged Nastas'ya to a test of skill with thebow and arrow. A silver ring was to beplaced on the head of one of them, and theother would then shoot an arrow down theblade of a knife and through the ring with-out disturbing it. Dunai bade his wife takethe first turn, and three times she suc-ceeded. Yet when it came to Dunai’s turn,she pleaded with him not to attempt thefeat, asking him to forgive her for her fool-ish challenge.When Dunai refused, she toldhim of their unborn child—a child witharms to the elbow that were of solid goldand legs of silver from hips to knees. Starsclustered around his temples; from everyhair on his head there hung a pearl; themoon shone from his back; and the sunradiated from his eyes.Unimpressed, Dunai proceeded withthe contest, dipping the point of his arrowinto the venom of a poisonous snake.However, he failed to make the target, andthe arrow pierced Nastas'ya’s heart. As shedied, they cut the baby from her womb,and it proved to be every bit as wondrousas she had said it would be. Grief-stricken,Dunai sank the butt of his spear into theground and fell onto its point.

Only she could recognize the Devil; allthose around her saw only the image of Paul.When she told her husband of the visit shehad received in her bedchamber, Paul advisedher to ascertain from the Devil the manner ofPaul’s death. She did as he asked, and foundout that Paul’s brother Peter of Muromwould kill him. However, when Peter cameto do the dirty deed, he succeeded only inkilling the serpent that had assumed Paul’sguise. At this point in the legend the DarkPrincess ceases to be mentioned, from whichwe may deduce that she was a servant of theDevil, and with her purpose at an end, shehad returned to eternal damnation.Peter, however, had been taintedby the blood of the serpent.

The woman told Peter that shelived alone, the remainder of her family beinglong dead, and that she would cure him of hisaffliction on the condition that he marriedher. Peter immediately agreed. No soonerhad he done so than his sores disappeared andhis strength returned. However, Peter nowsaw no reason to marry the maiden and madeready to leave the cottage. As he did so, hisstrength sapped away and the sores eruptedagain. Convinced that he had no choice inthe matter, Peter agreed to the union, and thecouple were duly married.At their wedding the woman told Peterthat her name, or rather the name she hadchosen to use as his wife, was Fevroniia.Together Peter and Fevroniia traveled backto Murom, where the influential boyars,angry because Peter had married a merepeasant, accused Fevroniia of poor mannersat the feast thrown in honor of their prince.Fevroniia retaliated by performing a series ofmiracles, such as turning crumbs from thetable into frankincense and myrrh. Theseacts, however, did not assuage the anger ofthe boyars, who demanded that she be ban-ished from the court because as a powerfulsorceress, she could hold their wives in thrall.Fevroniia agreed to leave Murom, providedthat Peter accompany her.So Peter, Fevroniia, and their retinue setout from Murom by boat.

This story, which wasrecorded by the fifteenth-century monkErmolai-erazm, demonstrates the coexis-tence of Christian faith alongside the ancientpagan religions—apparently acceptable tothe clergy, so long as Christianity was seen tobe the more potent force, as demonstrated byPeter’s burial inside the cathedral andFevroniia’s burial outside the city walls.However, the supernatural migration ofFevroniia’s grave to the cathedral demon-strates that no matter whether pagan orChristian, God accepts all into his kingdomafter death.See also:Boyars; Charity; Dark Princess,The;Devil,The; Ermolai-erazm; Kupalo; Murom;Paul; Peter of MuromReferences:Zenkovsky 1963FINLANDGeneralScandinavian country that is bounded to thenorth by Norway, to the east by Russia, tothe south and west by the Baltic Sea, and to84FINLANDAn early illustration of a fairy king and queenstanding beneath a mushroom being entertained bythe court (from the collections of Carol Rose; photo byDavid Rose)"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the northwest by Sweden.

Genghis (also Chinghiz) Khan was apolitical and military genius who unitedMongol and other nomadic tribes into aneffective, disciplined fighting force. Genghis’swarriors were known for their use of terrorto intimidate their opponents, and they fre-quently killed their prisoners.Genghis Khan was an intelligent manwith superior organizational abilities. Heshowed great generosity to his followers; andalthough he had little interest in culturalmatters, he promoted literacy among hispeople, as well as establishing the firstMongol code of laws, called the YasaorYasak.Genghis Khan’s original name was Te-mujin, which means “ironworker.” His fatherwas the chief of a small Mongol tribe.Temujin inherited the position of chiefaround age 13, when members of an enemytribe poisoned his father; but according toThe Secret History of the Mongols,a Mongolepic written during the mid-thirteenth cen-tury, the tribe for a time ignored its newchief. It was not long, however,before Temujin began to attractfollowers, form alliances, and buildan army. He used harsh training andstrict discipline to create a supe-rior fighting force that was wellequipped and that employed newtactics and weapons.Temujin used his army to extendhis power over neighboring tribes, and by1206 he had become the ruler of Mongolia.That year, an assembly of Mongol chieftainsproclaimed him Genghis Khan, a title thatprobably means either universal ruler orinvincible prince.

His preeminence stemsfrom his emergence in the sixteenth century.Awarrior saint who embodied aspects of Perunand Svantovit, George was the dragon-slayinghero who awed the earth and its inhabitants.He was also a symbol of the consolidation ofMuscovite sovereignty, and his warlike depic-tion in art, seated atop a great white chargerand carrying a spear, suggested that the tradi-tional sacrificial image of the Muscovite rulerhad changed to that of an aggressive and self-assertive defender of the land.Saint George first appeared as the patronof Russian rulers in 1415, under theMuscovite Grand Prince Vasilii II. This pa-tronage was advanced under the rule of IvanIII (“the Great”), the successor to Vasilii II,and marked the transformation of the Kievanideal of service into overlordship. For the firsttime the ruler was not seen as the servant ofthe people; instead, the people were seen asservants of the crown. Saint George was sopopular in Moscow that forty-one churchesthere are dedicated to him.Saint George’s Day (23 April) marked thebeginning of the agricultural year, a day onwhich George appeared in his fertilityaspect. In Belorussia, as in other areas, theday was marked with a ceremony in whicha young man who was called George for theday, and representing the saint, dressed ingreenery and flowers and led an entourageof singing maidens into the fields to stimu-late the fertility of the ground. In Ukrainethe ceremony combined both Christian andpagan elements. There a priest led a com-pany into the fields to bless the soil, and thenthe company, or in some cases the priesthimself, would roll on the ground to imbueit with their own inherent fertility. SaintGeorge supplanted the ancient fertilitydeities, being depicted as the guardian of allaspects of agriculture, from plants to cattleand beyond. He was described as winginghis way across the land on his white steed,reviving the soil and all life that lay dormantwithin it, his powers allegedly given him bythe Virgin Mary.Russia was not the only country to adoptSaint George as patron saint. England,Portugal, and Greece all delegated this role toSaint George; but in Russia, the saint seemsto have been more potent than elsewhere.As with many saints, not much is knownabout George’s life—indeed, it cannot beconfirmed that he actually existed. It hasbeen suggested that he may have been tor-tured and put to death by Diocletian atNicomedia on 23 April 303. Some, however,prefer the idea that he died c. 250 at Lyddain Palestine, where his alleged tomb is exhib-ited.The famous story of George’s fight withthe dragon cannot be traced to an earliersource than Legenda Aureaby Jacobus deVoragine (1230–98), which was translated asGolden Legendby Caxton in 1483.See also:Dragon; Perun; Saint George andthe Deceitful Fox; SvantovitReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Bezsonov1861; Delehaye 1927; Gimbutas 1971;Kazanskii 1855; Leroy-Beaulieu 1905;Tereshchenko 184890GEORGE, SAINT"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"91Sixteenth-century Russian icon of Saint George and the dragon (Rubliev Museum, Moscow; Beniaminson/ArtResource, NY)"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"GEORGIAGeneralA nation in the Caucasus region that becameindependent in 1991 after nearly 200 years ofRussian and Soviet rule.

However, Moscow was recapturedby the Mongols in 1382.During the late fifteenth century, Moscowbecame the most powerful Russian city.TsarIvan III (“the Great”) won control overMoscow’s main rivals, Novgorod and Tver'.In 1480, Ivan made the final break fromMongol rule by refusing to pay taxes to theGolden Horde.

When his father suddenlydied, the young man quickly squandered thelarge fortune his father had left him.Destitute and suddenly friendless, the youngman sold the golden buttons from his coat,his last asset in the world, and with themoney bought food and a spade. Then hewent to the town square and waited forsomeone to come along and employ him.Allday long the young man waited, butalthough others were readily hired, he waspassed over due to the softness of his hands.He had almost given up hope when agolden carriage entered the square, thoseothers still looking for work quickly takingto their heels, leaving the young man quitealone. The carriage drew up beside him andits owner, a wealthy merchant, offered him ajob, good food, and fine clothes. The youngman readily accepted the offer and climbedinto the carriage. Minutes later the carriagestopped beside a golden ship, which theyboarded. Several days later they landed on anisland on which stood a magnificent goldenmansion and a huge, glittering mountain.As the ship moored, the merchant and theyoung man disembarked to be greeted by themerchant’s daughter, a maiden of suchbeauty that the young man immediately losthis heart to her. All day long the young manlabored, unloading the ship and carrying theprovisions to the mansion. Then the mer-chant invited him to dine with himself andhis daughter, for the following day the youngman would start the work he had been hiredto do.The banquet laid out in the mansion wasfiner than the young man had ever seen in allhis privileged youth.After the meal, the mer-chant poured two goblets of wine andpushed one toward the young man.As he didso, the merchant’s daughter called to herfather from outside the room, and he left. Ashe left by one door, the maiden came inthrough another and hurried over to theyoung man. She handed him a tinderbox,telling him that should he ever find himselfin danger, he only had to strike the tinderboxand help would come.The young man quickly pocketed the tin-derbox and drank the goblet of wine. Nosooner had he drained his goblet than heslumped across the table and fell into a deepsleep, for the wine had been drugged. Themerchant got up from the table and went outinto the stables, where he harnessed twostrong horses to a cart and then killed an oldnag, cleaned out the carcass, and loaded it96GOLDEN KINGDOM, THE"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"onto the cart. Then he went back into themansion and carried the young man out andsewed him up, with his spade, inside the bodyof the old horse.The merchant then drove tothe foot of the Golden Mountain, where heunloaded the carcass and set his horses tograze while he hid behind some bushes. Asdawn broke, a flock of ravens with iron beaksand claws flew down from the mountain andpicked up the carcass and carried it to thesummit. There they started to tear away theflesh of the old horse. As the sun broke overthe horizon, they had picked the bones cleanand were beginning to peck at the body ofthe young man inside.The youth awoke as the pain chased awaythe last effects of the drugged wine, and hechased away the birds with his spade.Wondering where he was, he called out forhelp. From the foot of the mountain themerchant shouted that the young manshould dig and roll the gold down themountain. If by evening he had dug a cart-load of gold, then the merchant would tellhim how he might descend the mountain. Ifhe had not, then the merchant would leavehim there to be devoured by the ravenswhen they returned to roost at sunset.All day long the young man dug into themountain, and by evening the cart belowwas fully laden. However, as he stopped dig-ging and looked down the mountain, he sawthat the merchant was hitching his horses tothe cart and making ready to leave. Theyoung man shouted down to the merchant,asking to be told how to get down. Themerchant simply laughed at him and toldhim that he would never get down and thathe should enjoy the time he had left, forwhen the sun set the ravens would returnand tear him to pieces. With that the mer-chant drove away, and the young man satdown to ponder his fate.As he pondered, the sun began to set, andhe saw the ravens in the distance. Just thenhe remembered the tinderbox, took it out,and struck it twice. Instantly two men(described in the legend as Cossacks) stoodbefore him and asked him what he desired.He immediately asked to be taken back tohis hometown, and in a flash he found him-self standing in the deserted market squarewhere his journey with the merchant hadstarted.The young man lived quietly by himselfuntil his hands had healed from the labor onthe mountain, and then he went back to themarket square to await the return of the mer-chant. He waited patiently every day foralmost two months.Then the merchant reap-peared and the young man stood his groundas those around him seeking honest employ-ment fled. So it was that the young man onceagain found himself on the island. The mer-chant’s daughter was amazed when she rec-ognized the young man to whom she hadgiven the tinderbox; but she bit her lip andsaid nothing to her father.That evening, as the merchant poured thetwo goblets of wine, the young man passedsome comment that made the merchant turnaround, and as he did so, the young manswapped the goblets. Then, when the mer-chant fell into a deep sleep, the young manwent out into the stables, hitched the horsesto the cart, killed and gutted an old nag, andsewed the merchant and a spade inside.Then,just as the merchant had done, the youngman drove to the foot of the mountain,unloaded the carcass, unhitched the horses,and watched from his hiding place as theravens carried the carcass up to the summitof the mountain.As the sun rose and the ravens began totear at the merchant, he awoke and foughtoff the ravens with his spade. From the footof the mountain the young man called up tohim and told him to dig a cartload of goldbefore sunset.The merchant dug furiously allday, and by evening the cart was fully ladenwith gold. As the sun began to set, the youngman drove away and left the merchant to hiswell-deserved fate. He drove the cart back tothe golden mansion, where he took the mer-chant’s place, married the merchant’s daugh-ter, and lived a life of ease, never employing97GOLDEN MOUNTAIN, THE"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"any unfortunate lads to mine gold from theGolden Mountain.See also:Cossacks; Grishka; Mountain ofGold; UkraineGORYNICHRussiaA terrible dragon that was the nephew of thesorcerer Nemal Chelovek.See also:Dragon; Nemal ChelovekGORYNINKARussiaA sorceress related to Goryshche the dragon.She appears to Dobrynya Nikitich in theguise of an old hag and challenges him to afight, armed with a sword and lance thatreaches into the skies.

Goryshche’s lair isin a cavern in the Sorochinsk Mountains,where she holds many Russians—her foodsupply—in captivity. Dobrynya Nikitichundertakes a quest to find Goryshche andend her murderous ways.Having slain her young, Dobrynya iswarned by his mother, Amelfia Timofeyevna,never to return to the Sorochinsk Mountainsand to stay away from the river Puchai.Dobrynya ignores what he thinks of as theramblings of an old woman, and he is soonback in dragon-hunting country. Tired anddusty from his long journey, Dobrynya stripsoff his clothes, and leaving them with hishorse on the bank, dives into the riverPuchai. Suddenly he sees fire and sparksleaping into the air, accompanied by thickblack smoke. Out of this smoke emerges thetwelve-headed she-dragon Goryshche.Whilethe dragon asks Dobrynya what she shoulddo with him, the knight seizes the momentand dives beneath the waters, coming ashoreon the bank opposite that where his clothesand weapons lie, his horse having beenfrightened away when the dragon appeared.Just as he thinks the game is up, Dobrynyacatches sight of a priest’s hat lying in thegrass. As a bogatyr', a knight of Holy Russia,he knows that this hat will make a formida-ble weapon; but when he lifts it, it seemsextremely heavy. As the dragon flies towardhim, Dobrynya brandishes the hat and seversall but one of the dragon’s heads.The dragondrops to the ground and Dobrynya leapsastride her, preparing to finish her off.Goryshche begs for mercy and promisesnever to raid the lands of Holy Russia again,and never to carry off any more Russianpeople. Dobrynya likewise promises never toreturn to the Sorochinsk Mountains; andhaving made their pact, the two part ways.Absent his horse, Dobrynya must make hisway home to Kiev on foot. When he arriveshe finds that in his long absence a disaster hasbefallen the court of Prince Vladimir BrightSun. The very dragon that Dobrynya sparedhad broken her word, and flying over the city,she had carried away the Princess Zabava,Vladimir’s favorite niece.Vladimir Bright Suncalls together his knights and challenges themto rescue the unfortunate maiden.Alesha, the son of the priest Leontii, tellsVladimir that Dobrynya seems to know thedragon quite well, adding that he believesthat the dragon regards Dobrynya as herbrother. When Vladimir Bright Sun hearsthis, he commands Dobrynya to bring backthe girl or be beheaded.Returning home, Dobrynya explains whathas transpired to his mother, complaining thathe will have to walk to the SorochinskMountains because he has no horse. Hismother tells him of his father’s old chestnut,which is standing in the stable, mired in itsown dung. Telling her son to clean up the98GORYNICH"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"horse and feed it, she also advises him to geta good night’s sleep. Dobrynya follows hismother’s advice to the letter.The next morn-ing, as he mounts the chestnut and makesready to leave, his mother hands him a silkenwhip, telling him to whip the horse with it ifthe beast’s strength begins to fail.Placing the whip in his pocket, Dobrynyaspurs the horse, which clears the city walls ina single leap and speeds away faster than theeye can follow. In no time at all they reachthe foothills of the Sorochinsk Mountains.There the ground is teeming with the youngof the she-dragon. Dobrynya attacks them,riding over their dead bodies; but gradually,having been bitten badly, the horse begins tofalter. Remembering the words of hismother, Dobrynya takes the whip from hispocket and gently lashes his mount betweenthe ears and hind legs. Instantly the horse’svigor returns, and they finally arrive at thecave of the she-dragon.Needless to say, Goryshche is not happy tosee Dobrynya and complains bitterly aboutthe death of her offspring, and even more soabout the fact that Dobrynya, a knight ofHoly Russia, has broken his word. Dobrynyaretorts that it is she who first broke theirpact, and demands the return of Zabava.When the dragon refuses, Dobrynya attacksher. For three days they battle, until finallyDobrynya triumphs. However, Dobrynyanow finds himself stranded in the middle ofa vast lake that has formed from the dragon’sblood—a lake that the earth will not soak up.Calling on Mother Earth, he commandsher to open up and swallow the dragon’sblood. Instantly a huge chasm appears and thelake drains away. Dobrynya climbs down fromhis horse and enters the network of caves inwhich the dragon lived. Inside he finds andreleases many hundreds of Russians before hesees Princess Zabava in the very last chamber.Leading her outside, he perches her in frontof him on his horse, and they return to Kievat the same speed as that with which hedeparted.

Several menhad been picked by the time a richly attiredmerchant drove into the square in a solidgold carriage.All the other prospective labor-ers turned on their heels and fled when theysaw the merchant approach, but Grishkastood his ground.Thus he was the only manpresent when the merchant asked him if hewas looking for work, and he was also able tocommand the princely sum of one hundredrubles a day for his services.Grishka climbed into the merchant’s car-riage, and soon they had traveled the shortdistance to the harbor. There they boarded amagnificent ship and set sail. Eventually asmall island came into sight, the merchant’sgolden palace shining like a beacon in thebright sunlight. As they sailed into the smallharbor and moored, Grishka and the mer-chant were met by the merchant’s wife andhis beautiful daughter. Grishka immediatelyfell in love with the maiden, who likewisefell in love with him.At a banquet that night, the merchant’sdaughter gave Grishka a tinderbox, tellinghim that if he ever had need of assistance, allhe had to do was strike the steel against theflint, and help would be at hand.The following morning the merchant ledGrishka to the great Mountain of Gold thatrose from the center of the island, but nomatter how hard he might try, Grishka foundit too steep to climb. The merchant clappedGrishka on the back and told him not toworry, and sat him down with a goblet ofwine to refresh him so that he might tryagain. The wine was drugged, and Grishkasoon fell into a deep sleep. As soon as he haddozed off, the merchant cut the throat of thehorse that had accompanied them, gutted it,sewed Grishka up inside the carcass, and thenquickly hid.Two enormous black crows alighted,picked up the carcass, and carried it up to thetop of the mountain, where they picked itsbones clean. Grishka woke up and drove thecrows away,and then called out to the mer-chant, who replied from the foot of themountain. The merchant promised that ifGrishka toiled hard that day, he would divinea means by which he could descend themountain safely.Grishka dug gold all day long, rolling it offthe sheer sides of the mountain to the mer-chant below, who loaded it onto a series ofcarts. As night began to fall, Grishka calleddown that he had done enough for one dayand was ready to come down.The merchantsimply laughed, shouting back to Grishkathat ninety-nine men before him had per-ished on the summit of that mountain andthat he would become the hundredth. Thenthe merchant rode away,and Grishka satdown to ponder his predicament with thecrows circling overhead.It was then that Grishka remembered thetinderbox. He struck a spark from it and wasimmediately joined by two shining youths,who asked what he desired. Grishka askedthem to get him off the mountain. In aninstant Grishka found himself on the shore100GREGORY OF SMOLENSK"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"of the island, just as a boat was sailing past.Grishka called out to the sailors to rescuehim, but they simply laughed and proceededon their way. Grishka struck another spark,and an evil wind blew the ship back to theshore so that the sailors had no choice but topick up Grishka and carry him home.After he had returned home and rested awhile, Grishka returned to the market squareand waited for the merchant to arrive. Soonthe gold carriage entered the square, and allthe other men waiting took to their heelsand fled. Grishka this time bargained a priceof two hundred rubles a day, and once againhe was taken to the merchant’s island.However, when they again stood at the footof the mountain and the merchant offeredGrishka a drink to refresh himself, Grishkapolitely declined until the merchant himselfhad accepted a drink from his gratefulemployee. Grishka poured the merchant adrugged drink from his own flask, and whenthe merchant had fallen asleep, he cut thethroat of the horse that had accompaniedthem, took out its entrails, sewed the mer-chant up inside, and hid.The crows duly appeared, carried the car-cass to the top of the mountain, and strippedits bones. Thus the merchant found himselfat the top of the Mountain of Gold with noway down, and Grishka called up to him,saying that it would be the merchant and nothe who became the hundredth man to dieupon that summit.

Thatnight he made himself known to the oldman and his equally aged wife and was sub-sequently accepted into the family. Oneevening, the snake spoke to the old man andtold him that the very next day he should goto the local king and ask for the hand of theprincess for his son. The old man protested,but Habërmani insisted, and finally the managreed to go.All did not go well at the palace the fol-lowing morning. At first the palace guardstried to throw the old man out on his ear;but he insisted that he had somethingimportant to ask the king, so they uncere-moniously dragged him off and depositedhim in a pile on the floor before the throne.The king asked him what he wanted, andthe old man boldly asked the princess’s handfor his son.The king laughed to himself, thinkingthat the old peasant was mad; but he toldhim that he would give the hand of hisdaughter in marriage if by the followingmorning the peasant could build a finepalace that rivaled that of the king. If hefailed, however, the king would have hishead. Thus the old man trudged back to hisramshackle hut, sure that he was living hislast few hours on the earth. Habërmaniknew exactly what to do when the old peas-ant told him of the king’s command. Heinstructed the old man to go into the forest,where he would find a well. At that well heshould shout to Mother Earth and tell herwhat Habërmani wanted.The peasant forlornly did ashe was asked, and when hereturned home he was amazed tofind that his dilapidated old hut hadbecome a palace finer than eventhat of the king. The followingmorning the peasant once againset out for the king’s palace torepeat his request. The king was amazedwhen he saw the magnificent new palace,and he knew that forces were afoot aboutwhich he knew nothing and which he couldnot control. However, he was not ready togive up his only daughter so easily; so he toldthe old man that he must now go back andlay out gardens around the new palace, or hewould lose his head.Again the peasant related the demand toHabërmani, who told him to go back to thewell and ask Mother Earth, as he had donebefore. This the peasant did. The followingmorning the peasant went back to the king,the gardens around the new palace being thefinest any mortal had ever seen. Again theking would not give up his daughter with-out setting another task, this time telling thepeasant, again under threat of losing hishead, to provide a carpet that stretchedbetween the two palaces.Habërmani sent the peasant back to thewell, and the following morning the old mantrekked back to the king and told him thateverything he had been asked to do, he haddone. However, the king assigned him onelast task: to provide seven invisible minstrelswith pipes and drums, a demand that the oldman easily complied with, thanks toHabërmani, Mother Earth, and the well.Finally, seeing that there was nothing that theold man could not achieve, the king relentedand asked the old man to present his son.When the king saw that the youth was asnake, he was horrified; but as he had givenH"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"his word, he gave the order for weddingpreparations to begin.The wedding feast lasted seven days andseven nights. When all the guests had de-parted and Habërmani and his new wifewere left alone, Habërmani removed hissnakeskin and revealed himself to be a hand-some prince. He told his wife that he wouldonly assume his manly guise when they werealone, and would live as a snake during theday. He also warned her not to breathe oneword about his human form; for if she did,the magic spell would be broken and shewould lose him, and everything would be asit was before.Many weeks passed, and although sorelytempted on more than one occasion, theprincess kept her bond, and she andHabërmani lived a life of happiness.However, the king then decided to hold atournament in which all the nobles of hiskingdom would take part. Habërmani stoleaway and shed his snakeskin. He then dressedin blue armor and rode to the tournament,where everyone was amazed by his prowess.The princess immediately guessed that thismysterious blue knight was none other thanher beloved Habërmani. Many ladies of thecourt made fun of the princess, saying thather husband would not dare slither onto thetournament ground, for he would surely betrampled to death. At length their tauntsbecame intolerable, and the princess retortedthat her husband was the finest knight at thetournament that day.No sooner had she spoken the words thanHabërmani was struck by a lance and thrownfrom his horse.When he regained conscious-ness, his wife beside him, he told her that shehad lost him. She could only recover him bybinding iron sandals to her feet, taking up asteel staff, and traveling the world for sevenyears, during which time she would passseven castles—one each year. ThenHabërmani, the palace, its gardens, the car-pet, and the pipers vanished, and the princesswas left alone in the ramshackle hut that hadonce been the home of the old peasant andhis wife. Immediately resolving to findHabërmani, the princess strapped on ironsandals, took up a steel staff, and set out.Habërmani, still wounded from the tour-nament, had traveled by magic to a realmruled by a witch and her daughter whom thewitch wanted Habërmani to marry. How-ever, Habërmani was so in love with hisprincess that when his wound had healed, hesuccumbed to a fever that felt as if he wereburning in the fires of damnation. Thewitch’s daughter fetched pitchers of waterfrom dawn to dusk in an attempt to cool thefever, but Habërmani simply lay there,writhing in agony.The princess, on the other hand, waswending her way through the world, until shecame to the Clay City.There she met a maidat a well, collecting water in a pitcher. Sheasked the girl if Habërmani lived in the city.The girl told the princess that she had notheard of Habërmani, and sent her on to theCrystal City, which lay one year’s walk away.The princess tried that city and received thesame response, this time being sent to theCopper City. From there she was sent to theIron City, then the Steel City, then the SilverCity, and finally the Golden City.There she met the witch’s daughter get-ting water at the well.The princess asked thegirl if she knew where Habërmani was, andshe was delighted to hear that he was in thatcity, although for seven years he had lived alife of torment in the clutches of a vile fever.The princess asked the girl for a drink fromthe pitcher, and surreptitiously slid her wed-ding ring into the water as she drank. Theprincess then sat down to wait while thewitch’s daughter took the pitcher to whereHabërmani lay. As he drank the water, hefound the ring and was immediately cured ofhis fever. Habërmani sent the witch’s daugh-ter to fetch the woman from the well, andthus Habërmani and his princess werereunited. However, they had yet to escapethe witch.That night the old witch asked theprincess to massage her feet until she fell104HABËRMANI"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"asleep, and then to sleep at the foot of herbed. Habërmani advised his wife that thewitch intended to kill her with a powerfulkick; so the princess placed a large log in herplace after the witch had fallen asleep. Just asHabërmani expected, in the morning the loghad been smashed. When the witch realizedthat she had been tricked, she tried to get theprincess lost by sending her out to gather fivesacks of feathers in the forest. However,Habërmani told the princess how she couldgather them easily, and she quickly returnedwith the required amount. The witch thensent the princess to bring her twelve dresseslike no others in the world. This time, whenthe princess told her husband of the task shehad been assigned, Habërmani decided thatthe time had come for them to escape.Having traveled a fair distance from thecity, Habërmani told his wife to look aroundand see if they were being followed. She sawa cloud of dust in their wake, a cloud thatHabërmani guessed would be the witch’sdaughter. He instantly turned his wife into awindmill and himself into a deaf miller.Thus,when the witch’s daughter reached them, hecould only respond with nonsense, and thewitch’s daughter returned to her city empty-handed. The witch guessed what had hap-pened and sent her daughter out again.Habërmani and his wife had traveled agood distance farther when the princess sawthe cloud of dust again catching up to them.This time Habërmani turned his wife into agarden and himself into a deaf gardener. Asbefore, the witch’s daughter was thwartedand returned to her mother.This time it wasthe witch herself who set off in pursuit ofHabërmani and the princess.Having returned to their normal, humanforms, Habërmani and the princess had trav-eled a good distance when they saw a hugecloud of dust following them. Habërmanitold his wife to throw her comb on theground. Instantly a huge forest sprang uparound them. Habërmani turned his wifeinto a small sapling and himself into a smallsnake, winding himself around his wife tokeep her safe. The witch came to the forestand knew that within its depths she wouldfind Habërmani as a small snake woundaround a fine young sapling that was hiswife. However, from within the trees,Habërmani pleaded for mercy, and the witchagreed in return for a kiss from the snake.Habërmani agreed, whereupon the witchreturned to her city, and Habërmani and hiswife resumed their human forms again.Theyreturned home, where they found the palaceand its gardens restored, and there they livedout their days, Habërmani never againresorting to the use of his snakeskin.See also:Clay City,The; Copper City,The;Crystal City,The; Golden City,The; IronCity,The; Mother Earth; Silver City,The;Steel City,TheReferences:Orbeli and Taronian 1959–67,vol. 4HAHESiberia —SamoyedWooden idols that personified varioushousehold spirits.

Hansa orHanse) was a confederation of northernEuropean trading cities that operated fromthe twelfth century until 1669. At its heightin the late fourteenth century the leagueconsisted of over 160 towns and cities,among them Lübeck, Hamburg, Cologne,Kraków, and Breslau.The basis of the league’spower was its monopoly of Baltic trade andits relations with Flanders and England. Thegradual decline of the league beginning inthe fifteenth century was due to the move-ment of trade routes and the formation anddevelopment of national states.The earliest confederation had its head-quarters at Visby, Sweden, and included overthirty cities.

Both Hamburgand Lübeck established branch offices inLondon, in 1266 and 1267, respectively.These two German leagues were united withyet another based in Cologne, in 1282, toform the so-called Steelyard. There werethree other branches of the HanseaticLeague—at Bruges, Bergen, and Novgorod.The last general assembly, that of 1669,marked the League’s end.See also:NovgorodHARO(N)ArmeniaThe traveling companion of Baron, somesources suggesting a blood relationshipbetween the two but never explicitly con-firming or denying it. During their travelsHaron went blind, and from that moment onBaron had to act as Haron’s guide, a fact heoften bitterly complained about. One nightthey made their camp under a tree in a for-est at the foot of Mount Amarven. Baronclimbed a tree to remain safe during thenight, leaving Haron to fend for himself onthe forest floor. As the sun set, the two trav-elers heard a pack of wolves approachingthem; and as the howls grew louder, Barongrew so afraid that his trembling caused himto lose his footing and fall from the tree.Haron, however, remained calm and toldBaron that they should simply sit beneath thetree and talk, giving the impression that theywere just two of many.They did exactly that;and the wolves, thinking that they might beattacked by an unknown number of men, leftthem alone. The following night exactly thesame situation arose, this time with a pack ofbears, and again Haron and Baron deceivedthe bears into thinking that the two were notalone (again, Baron was very frightened, andHaron was calm).Once again, as they made their camp thevery next night, Baron sought to make hisbed in a tree, leaving Haron on the ground.Baron, however, had to climb down to eat.When Haron grew thirsty during the meal,Baron refused to lead him to a nearbystream.Thus Haron had to guide himself tothe refreshing water. There Haron heard abird alight on a branch above him, a birdthat told him to splash the water from thestream on his eyes. Haron did so, and hissight was immediately restored. Overjoyed,he rushed back to camp to tell Baron.When Baron heard the news, all he couldthink about was bettering his already per-fect sight, and so he rushed down to thestream to splash water in his face. However,when he did so he was immediately struckblind; and from that moment on, their roleswere reversed, and Haron had to leadBaron.The following evening the two onceagain made camp in the shade of a tree.Thistime, Haron did not seek to make his bed inthe tree but stayed close to Baron. As they satdown to prepare their evening meal, theyheard the sound of a man approaching onhorseback, the horse’s hoof falls accompaniedby the sound of many men on foot. As theylistened to the men approaching, a huntsmanon a white horse entered the clearing—ahuntsman that Haron immediately recog-nized as king of the land they were travelingthrough.106HANSEATIC LEAGUE"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The king eyed the two suspiciously, andthinking them enemy spies, he had thembound and dragged off to his dungeons.There they were left for several days beforebeing brought before the king and his beau-tiful daughter.

As it was beingconsecrated, a strong wind rose and a hermitappeared before the king, congratulating himon building such a fine church but addingthat it was a pity just one thing was missing.The hermit then disappeared, and the kingordered that the church be destroyed andrebuilt.Seven years later exactly the same thinghappened. This time the king ordered thatan even grander church be built, a churchthat took nine years in the construction.However, as the bishop was consecrating thechurch, the hermit reappeared with thesame message. This time the king took holdof the hermit and asked him just what wasmissing. The hermit replied that the missingitem was the nightingale Hazaran, and thenhe disappeared.The king had three sons, and they eagerlyvolunteered to discover the whereabouts ofthe nightingale and bring it back to theirfather. Having ridden for a month, the threesons encountered a hermit at the junction ofthree roads.The hermit told the three that hewho followed the first road would return, hewho followed the second road may or maynot return, and he who followed the thirdroad had little chance of returning.The threebrothers cast lots. Then the eldest took thefirst road, the middle son the second road,and the youngest the last.After his two brothers had set off, theyoungest brother asked the hermit why hehad little chance of returning. The hermittold him that the road was beset with haz-ards, and then told the youth how he mightovercome each one. Well prepared, theyoungest brother set out.Before long he came to the first obstacle,a river with poisonous waters and no bridge.The youth dismounted, took a drink, anddeclared, “the Waters of Life!” At that, abridge appeared, and he crossed the riversafely. A short time later he came across ahuge thistle. This he picked, smelled, anddeclared “the Flower of Paradise.” Riding on,the young man came across a wolf and alamb tied to wooden posts, a heap of grassbefore the wolf, and a joint of meat in frontof the lamb. The youngest brother gave thegrass to the lamb and the meat to the wolf,and continued down the road.The last obsta-cle was a two-sided gate, one side open andthe other side closed. Following the instruc-tions of the hermit, the young man closedthe open side and opened the shut side, andriding through, found the palace of the mis-tress of Hazaran.107HAZARAN"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, the eldest brother had riddenhis road and come to a fine palace, where hehad decided he would remain to live a life ofluxury, in the service of its lord.The middlebrother had likewise had an easy journey;but the palace he came to hid a danger towhich he succumbed—a huge Arab whowhipped the youth and turned him intostone.The youngest brother, having entered thepalace, encountered the mistress of thenightingale lying on a bed. As he watched,Hazaran flew down from its perch andalighted on the maiden’s chest, where itstarted to sing, and in an instant the maidenfell asleep. As she did so the young man dart-ed forward, snatched up Hazaran, kissed themaiden on the cheek, and made his way backalong the road. Seven days later the maidenawoke from her sleep, and seeing that herbird had vanished, she commanded her trapsalong the road to stop the thief. They couldnot, for the spell that held them had beenbroken when the youth followed the adviceof the hermit.The young man made his way safely backto the crossroads, where he once againencountered the hermit and asked for newsof his brothers. When the hermit told himthat they had not returned, the young mangave Hazaran to the hermit for safekeepingand then set off down the first road. In thetown surrounding the first palace, he foundhis brother working as a servant in an inn.He told him of his success, and together theyrode back to the crossroads. Leaving hiseldest brother there with the hermit and thenightingale, the youngest brother set off tofind his other sibling.At the second palace he too encounteredthe huge Arab; but when the whip wasaimed in his direction, the young man sim-ply stepped aside, took hold of the whip, andpulled it from the Arab’s grasp. Then heturned the whip on the Arab, and turnedhim into stone. Guessing that the stones thatlay all around had once been people, theyoung prince began whipping them, andthey all turned back into people, who fled inall directions.The very last stone he whippedturned into his brother, and the two rodeback together to the crossroads, where theywere reunited with their eldest brother.Theytook Hazaran from the hermit, and set outtoward home.En route the three ran out of water.Luckily, a short distance farther down theroad they came to a well.They lowered theyoungest brother down to fetch water.While the young man was at the bottom ofthe well, the two other brothers discussedhow they would look in their father’s eyesif they allowed their young brother to takeall the glory. As a result they left the unfor-tunate youth in the well and returned totheir father with the nightingale, telling theking that their brother had perished alongthe way.The king placed Hazaran in his church,but the bird would not sing and looked closeto death. Several days later the maiden cameto the king and demanded to know who hadstolen her bird. The two brothers said thatthey had, and when asked what they hadencountered on the way, they replied thatthey had encountered nothing. Immediatelythe maiden knew that they were lying, andso she seized the brothers and their father,threw them into a dungeon, and ruled intheir stead.In the meantime, the young prince hadbeen rescued from the well and made hisway back home on foot.When he arrived inthe city he was told all that had happened,and he ran to the dungeon to release hisfather and his brothers. There he was con-fronted by the maiden, who asked himexactly the same questions she had asked hisbrothers. He told the maiden all he hadencountered, and she immediately knew thathe was telling the truth. A few days later themaiden and the young prince were marriedin the king’s magnificent church, whereHazaran sits and pours out an endless streamof song.References:Khatchatrian 1933108HAZARAN"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"HELENRussiaAnglicized, alternative form of Elena.HERZEGOVINAGeneralPart of the land known as Bosnia-Her-zegovina.This territory, originally referred toas Hum, was inhabited by Illyrians fromabout the third millennium B.C.

After Geza died, his sonStephen, a Roman Catholic, carried on hiswork. Stephen asked Pope Sylvester II (pope999–1003) to give him the title King ofHungary, a proposition to which the popeagreed. Stephen I, Hungary’s first king, wascrowned in 1000. As king, Stephen madeRoman Catholicism the country’s officialreligion, and for this work, the CatholicChurch declared him a saint in 1083, 45years after his death.In 1241, armies of the Mongol Empireinvaded Hungary, and within a few months,they had overrun much of its territory. Thedeath of the Mongols’ ruler forced theinvaders to withdraw the following year,leaving much of the country in ruins.However, under the leadership of the Arpádkings, Hungary gradually recovered.After the death of the last Arpád king in1301, Hungary remained an independentkingdom for another 225 years. JohnHunyadi, a Hungarian nobleman of Ro-manian descent, led Hungarians in defeatingthe Ottoman Empire in 1456. Hunyadi’s sonMatthias Corvinus became king of Hungaryin 1458. A period of conflict and disorderfollowed Matthias’s death in 1490.Weakenedby these internal problems, Hungary wasdefeated by the Ottoman Empire in theBattle of Mohacs in 1526. The Ottomansseized central Hungary soon afterward andmade the eastern third of the country, aregion called Transylvania, a dependent prin-cipality. The Austrian Habsburgs, who hadlong wanted to make Hungary part of theirempire, took the country’s western andnorthern sections, and in the late seventeenthcentury drove the Ottomans out of most ofHungary. The Habsburgs gained completecontrol of the country in the early eigh-teenth century.In the early nineteenth century, CountIstván Széchenyi led a movement to reviveHungarian culture and national pride and topromote economic and social reforms. In the1840s, Lajos Kossuth became the mostimportant leader of the reform movementand eventually turned it into a drive forHungarian independence. In 1848 a govern-ment responsible to parliament was formedwith Austrian consent. Other changes werealso made, but disagreements between thetwo countries finally led Hungary to fightfor its independence. Kossuth became headof a revolutionary Hungarian government,which declared the country’s complete inde-pendence from Austria in April 1849; but theAustrians, aided by the Russians, defeated theHungarian army in August of that year, andHungary again came under Habsburg rule.In 1867, a group of Hungarians led byFerenc Deák was able to force the emperorof Austria, Francis Joseph I, to give Hungaryequal status with Austria. Under this arrange-ment, called the Dual Monarchy, both coun-tries had the same monarch and conductedforeign, military, and certain financial affairsjointly, but each country retained its ownconstitutional government to handle allother matters.In 1914, a Serbian student from Bosnia-Herzegovina killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.

Il'ya’s surname isactually an epithet that simply means hecame from the city of Murom, not far fromMoscow. Il'ya was born in the village ofKaracharovo, the son of a peasant namedIvan, and thus was given the patronymic ofIvanovich, his more common name ofMuromets being used to identify him afterhe had left his hometown. Born a cripple,too weak to even move, he was miraculouslycured at the age of 33 by a group of men,kalekior pilgrims (some stories identify themas Jesus Christ and two of the apostles), whogave him a drink made of honey.The pilgrims gave Il'ya advice on how heshould spend his life, mentioning that heshould avoid confrontation with Sviatogorand Mikula Selyaninovich and Volga Yaro-slavich. They told Il'ya that although hemight defeat Volga in battle, Volga’s cunningwould surely defeat Il'ya in the end.The pil-grims then vanished from sight, and Il'yawent to find his parents so that they mightjoin him in celebrating his cure.Shortly after his cure, Il'ya vowed to travelto Kiev, to offer his services to PrinceVladimir Bright Sun and his wife Evprak-siya.Attending mass in Murom before settingout, he vowed that he would neither fightnor spill blood before he reached Kiev thatevening, where he would once again attendmass.This vow meant that Il'ya intended totravel more than 500 miles in a single day—a feat that would have been impossible had itnot been for his wondrous horse Sivushko,which galloped like the wind and clearedmountains in a single leap. Some sourcesstate that a single leap of this wondrous ani-mal covered fifty versts, a verst being theequivalent of approximately two-thirds of amile (so fifty versts would be around 33miles). Arming himself with his saber, his115IL'YA MUROMETS"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"bow and arrows, his massive mace, and along, very sharp lance, Il'ya set out on themost direct route to Kiev, which would takehim past the city of Chernigov (althoughsome sources identify the city in this partic-ular episode as Smolensk).As he approached the city he saw that itwas under siege. Praying to God to releasehim from his vow, he charged the heathenhordes and killed the entire army. The peo-ple of Chernigov welcomed him as a heroand offered to make him their tsar. Il'yarefused, and instead asked them to point outto him the most direct road to Kiev. Thisthey did, warning him that on that route hewould have to cross the Black Mire, a swampthat pulled people down into its depths; fordthe raging river Smorodina; and then in theBriansk Woods he would be ambushed bySolovei Rakhmatich, son of Rakhmat, a ter-rible brigand, half man and half bird, whowas commonly known as Nightingale.Unafraid, Il'ya set out along the overgrownroad. (It was overgrown because for the pre-vious thirty years Nightingale had let no onepass, killing all who attempted the journey.)Sivushko cleared the Black Mire in a sin-gle bound and then leaped across the ragingtorrent of the river Smorodina. EventuallyIl'ya came to a stream called Smorodinka,beside which, in a nest in a tree, livedNightingale (some sources say Nightingale’snest was so large that it covered the tops ofseven trees). As Nightingale saw the knightapproach, he whistled with all his might. Allaround him the trees and grass were flat-tened; and so strong was the blast that evenIl'ya’s horse stumbled. Chiding it to regain itsfeet, Il'ya fired an arrow at Nightingale, strik-ing him on the temple and knocking himfrom his perch.Il'ya leaped down from his horse andquickly bound Nightingale before heregained his senses. Then he tied him to thestirrup of his horse and continued on hisway. A short distance down the road theywere to pass the house in which livedNightingale’s daughters and sons-in-law.Thishouse stood on seven pillars and covered anarea seven versts by seven versts (about fivemiles long by five miles wide). When theysaw Nightingale tied to the stirrup of Il'yaMuromets’s horse, they rushed out of thehouse to attack. However, Nightingale madethem put down their weapons and had theminvite Il'ya into the house to be their guest.Il'ya guessed that as soon as he was inside thehouse he would be beaten; so wasting notime, he killed all of Nightingale’s daughtersand their husbands.Il'ya came at last to Kiev and presentedhimself to Vladimir Bright Sun. He hadarrived slightly too late to attend mass as washis intention. When he told Vladimir of allthat had befallen him that day, the prince didnot believe him; so Il'ya led the prince outinto the courtyard where Nightingale wasstill tied to his horse. Vladimir commandedNightingale to whistle, but he refused, sayingthat as Il'ya had defeated him fairly, only Il'yacould command him now. Il'ya ordered himto whistle, but only at half-strength.Nightingale put his fingers to his lips, andignoring what Il'ya had said, whistled at fullstrength. All around, the guards and courtiersfell dead.Vladimir himself was blown aroundthe courtyard.Having been accepted by VladimirBright Sun as a great knight worthy ofbecoming a member of his court, Il'ya tookNightingale out onto the steppe andbeheaded him. The human half of his bodyhe fed to the wolves, and the bird half to thecarrion crows. Then Il'ya returned to Kiev,and there he lived as a respected member ofthe court of Prince Vladimir Bright Sun,setting out frequently across the steppes topursue many adventures.On one occasion Il'ya Muromets traveledto the Holy Mountains (some sources saythat these events took place while Il'ya wasen route from Murom to Kiev after hismiraculous cure). There Il'ya came across ahuge white pavilion beneath an oak tree,inside which stood a huge bed. Some sourcessay the bed was ten fathoms long and six116IL'YA MUROMETS"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"fathoms wide (80 feet by 48 feet). Curiousabout who owned such a bed, Il'ya tiedSivushko to the oak tree and lay down onthe bed, where he slept for three days andthree nights. Then the earth began to trem-ble. Sivushko stamped his feet and called outthat the mighty Sviatogor was returning tohis tent. Il'ya leaped up from the bed anduntied his horse so that it might hide, andthen he climbed the oak tree.From his position in the oak tree Il'yawatched as Sviatogor approached his pavilioncarrying a crystal casket on his shoulder. Atthe pavilion Sviatogor placed the casket onthe ground. He unlocked it with a goldenkey from around his neck, opened it, anddrew out a beautiful woman—his wife. Thecouple then ate a fine meal, after whichSviatogor grew sleepy and went to bed. Hiswife, however, did not immediately join him,having decided that she would first go walk-ing. As she walked, she caught sight of Il'yaMuromets hiding in the tree. She bade himclimb down, and threatening to wakeSviatogor, made the bogatyr' lie with her.Then she placed the knight in her husband’spocket and went to sleep next to the giant.The following morning Sviatogor placedhis wife back in her crystal casket, and mount-ing his mighty horse, set off to ride throughthe Holy Mountains. Before long his horsestumbled for the very first time in its life; andwhen Sviatogor chided it, the horse com-plained that once he had only to carry abogatyr' and his wife but now he was forced tocarry a wife and two bogatyri. ImmediatelySviatogor guessed that his wife had beenunfaithful to him, and taking her out of thecasket, he cut off her head. Then he reachedinto his pocket and pulled out Il'ya Muromets,and the two rode on together, Sivushko havingfollowed the party at a discreet distance.Before long the two came across a hugestone casket. Dismounting, Il'ya lay down inthe coffin, but he found it far too large andbade Sviatogor try it out. Even though Il'yaMuromets pleaded with him not to close thelid, Sviatogor did just that. However, whenhe asked Il'ya to remove the lid, Il'ya found itfar too heavy. Three times he hit it with hismace; but each time he struck, a steel bandclosed around the coffin, securing the lid.Sviatogor blew some of his strength intoIl'ya so that the knight could use the giant’ssword; but this just made matters worse, fortwo steel bands closed around the coffinevery time Il'ya struck it with the sword.Resigning himself to his fate, Sviatogor hadIl'ya tie his horse to the tree, so that it woulddie there beside its master. Il'ya did as askedand then sadly rode away from the coffin,knowing that Sviatogor, the last of the giants,would shortly be no more.Il'ya returned to Kiev and served hisprince faithfully for many years. One day,when he realized that his end was near, hedeparted the city one last time to ride acrosshis beloved countryside. As he rode he cameto a three-way crossroad. Each road wasmarked by a sign saying that one road led tocertain death, the second led to certain mar-riage, and the last led to certain wealth. As hewas old, Il'ya knew that he had no reason tomarry and no need for wealth, so he took thefirst road, as it seemed the most appropriate.Il'ya spurred on Sivushko. After ridingthree hours and covering a distance of threehundred versts (two hundred miles), he cameto a huge palace, the home of more thanforty thousand robbers.The robbers attackedhim, but Il'ya simply rode among them andkilled them all. He then returned to the sign-post and changed the wording so that anyonewho passed that way would know the roadwas now safe.Il'ya turned Sivushko down the secondroad, rode another three hours and threehundred versts, and pulled up in front of asecond palace.A beautiful maiden lived in thepalace. She invited Il'ya to dine with her andspend the night, and if he did, then he wouldremain with her always, as her husband. Il'yaate and then followed the maiden to her bed-chamber; but instead of lying down wheninvited to, he took hold of the maiden andthrew her onto the bed, guessing that this was117IL'YA MUROMETS"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"some form of trap. Just as he suspected, thebed opened up and the maiden fell throughto the dungeons beneath. Il'ya took themaiden’s keys, went down into the dungeons,and released the many prisoners she hadtaken in this manner. Then he rode away,leaving the deceitful maiden locked in herown dungeons. Returning once more to thesignpost, he altered its wording so that every-one would know that the road was now safe.Finally Il'ya traveled the third road, againriding three hours and covering three hun-dred versts. At journey’s end he came to ahuge boulder in the middle of a field. Thisrock weighed 270 poods (around 9,720pounds), but Il'ya easily lifted it to reveal ahuge hoard of gold, silver, and preciousstones. Il'ya distributed these riches amongthe poor and had enough left to build a smallchurch. He then returned to the crossroads,where he once again altered the wording onthe sign to let all who passed know what hehad done.Then Il'ya returned to Kiev.His last act was to build Kiev a cathedral.As soon as it was completed he died and hisbody turned to stone. Some versions of theaccount say that Il'ya became the last stoneneeded to complete the building.See also:Black Mire; Bogatyr'; BrianskWoods; Bylina; Chernigov; Evpraksiya (~ia),Princess; Il'ya Ivanovich; Karacharovo; Kiev;Mikula Selyaninovich; Moscow; Murom;Nightingale; Rakhmat; Sivushko; Smorodina;Smorodinka; Solovei (~y) Rakhmatich;Sviatogor;Vladimir Bright Sun, Prince;VolgaYaroslavichReferences:Astakhova 1938–51; Chadwick1964; Gil'ferding 1951; Gimbutas 1971;Khudiakov 1863; Nechaev and Rybakov1959; Rambaud 1879; Speranskii 1916IMPS OF MISFORTUNEUkraineSee Misfortune,The Imps of.INDIARussiaHaving no connection with the real country,India is a fantasy land mentioned in manyRussian legends.

Istvan wasmorose, lazy, selfish, and bad-tempered,whereas his brother was the complete oppo-site—cheerful, generous, kind, and good-natured.The family lived in a small kingdombeset by problems, for two seven-headed118IMPS OF MISFORTUNE"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"dragons had taken up residence in the king’spalace. One dragon was of copper and theother of iron, and both had refused to leaveuntil the king’s daughter consented to marryone or the other.They had compounded theproblem by turning the unfortunate princessinto a dragon as well. The king proclaimedthat whoever could release the princess fromthe clutches of the dragons would receiveher hand in marriage and half the kingdomas her dowry.News of this proclamation reachedIstvan’s father, who told the boy to go andsee if he could make something of his life byliberating the princess. Istvan grumbled con-tinuously as he made his way to the royalpalace. En route he sat down to eat and spieda colony of ants. Gathering up his food, as hedid not want it contaminated, Istvan kickedthe anthill and continued on his way until hecame to a lake. There he sat down to eatagain, only to be annoyed on this occasion bytwelve ducklings playing in the reeds. Istvanpicked up a handful of pebbles and threwthem at the ducklings, which scattered.Istvan traveled on. After spending anuncomfortable night in the open, which didnothing to improve his already foul temper,he arrived at the palace and knocked on aside door. Before long an old crone came tothe door and asked Istvan what he wanted.When he said that he had come to free theprincess, the old crone told him he had threetests to pass.With that, she threw a handful ofmillet on the ground, and told Istvan that hisfirst test was to pick up every grain; but as hebent down to do so, an army of ants appearedand devoured the millet. The old croneslammed the door, and it remained closedthe rest of the day, no matter how hard Istvanhammered on it.The following morning, having spent yetanother uncomfortable night in the forest,Istvan returned to the door and knockedhard. The old crone opened the door, tookout twelve golden keys, and threw them intoa lake, telling Istvan that he had to collect alltwelve as his second test. Istvan stripped offhis clothes and dived in; but no matter howhard he searched, he could not find even asingle key. Thus it was that Istvan had tospend another night in the open, this timefrozen to the bone in his wet clothes.As day broke Istvan went back to thepalace and hammered on the small side door.The old crone appeared and told him to goaway. However, he insisted that he be giventhe third test, so the crone took him to theking’s chamber, where he saw the three drag-ons.The old crone told him to say which wasthe princess. Istvan had no idea and chose atrandom. He chose one of the real dragons,which instantly bellowed with all its might.A giant entered the hall, picked up Istvan,took him outside, and threw him onto theground, which opened up and swallowedhim.Meanwhile, Istvan’s father was waiting fornews of his son. When none arrived, he sentJanos to see if he would fare any better. Janostraveled the same road as had his elderbrother, and on the way he too sat down toeat. As had happened with his brother, acolony of ants gathered around the crumbsthat fell from his food. However, instead ofkicking the anthill, Janos took out a cake andbroke it into fine crumbs, which he fed tothe ants. He then continued on his way.Before long, he came to the lake on whichthe twelve ducklings were swimming. Seeingthem, Janos reached into his bag, took out aloaf of bread, broke it into pieces, and threwthe pieces to the birds.Then he made his wayto the palace.As his brother had done before, Janosknocked on the door. He was greeted by theold crone with the same challenge. Shethrew a bag of millet on the ground, and asJanos bent down to pick it up, a column ofants appeared and did the job for him. Nextthe old crone threw the twelve golden keysinto the lake and closed the door. BeforeJanos even had time to take off his shirt, thetwelve ducklings appeared with the keys intheir beaks.The next time Janos knocked onthe door he was greeted not by the old crone119ISTVAN"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"but by a beautiful maiden dressed in thecrone’s rags. She told him that she had beenheld under a spell, which he had brokenthrough his kindness to the ants and theducklings.The maiden led Janos into the palace andtold him how to distinguish the princessfrom the two real dragons. She then gave theyoung man a sword with which to kill thedragons, telling him that after he had dis-posed of them he must return to the palaceand put on a pin-encrusted suit of clothesand stamp his foot three times, whereupon agiant would appear. This was the giant whoheld his brother Istvan in Thrall. Janos, thewoman said, must then let the giant do as hewanted.Janos thanked the woman, who instantlyvanished. He entered the king’s hall, wherehe correctly identified the princess and cutoff the heads of the two dragons, thus releas-ing the princess from her enchantment andreturning her to her human form. ThenJanos went outside, put on the pin-studdedsuit, and stamped his foot three times.Beneath his feet a huge giant appeared,picked up Janos, and placed him in hismouth. The giant, however, could not swal-low Janos because of the pins; nor could hespit him out, as Janos sat on the giant’stongue. The pain was more than the giantcould endure, and he asked Janos to climbout of his mouth. Janos said he would, onthree conditions.The first was the release of Istvan, whowas duly returned unscathed. The secondwas a promise to leave the kingdom andnever return, and the third was for two hugebeams of wood. The giant produced these,and Janos climbed out; but before the gianthad time to close his mouth, Janos wedged inthe beams, thus preventing the giant fromever closing his mouth again.The giant thenran away from the palace as fast as he couldgo, and he was never heard of again.Janos and the princess were married thatvery day, the king gladly giving his new son-in-law half his kingdom as a wedding presentand the remainder later, when he abdicatedin Janos’s favor.

Many years after Nastas'yawas blown away by a huge gust of wind, thetwo eldest sons,Vasilii and Peter, set out on aquest to find her. Some time later Ivan alsoset out on the same quest.Riding through the forest, he met up withhis unnamed uncle who lived in a splendidpalace, and who gave him a magical ball tofollow. This ball, Ivan was told, would leadhim to where his mother was being held cap-tive. Following the ball, Ivan caught up withhis brothers, whom he persuaded to join him.Together they followed the ball until it cameto a stop outside a cave at the foot of verysteep, almost insurmountable mountains. Notwanting to risk their own lives, Vasilii andPeter sent Ivan on alone, promising to waitfor him at the foot of the mountains.Ivan entered the cave, where he found ahuge iron door barring the way. Placing hisshoulder against the door, he found that itswung easily open. Inside, just as his unclehad told him he would, Ivan found somemetal claws, which he fixed to his hands andfeet, and started to climb. After a month hereached the top, a vast plateau that stretchedout as far as the eye could see. Following afaint path, he first came to a palace made ofcopper, the gates of which were guarded bydragons fettered with copper collars andchains. Nearby there was a well with a cop-per cup on a copper chain. Filling the cupwith water, he gave it to the dragons, whichimmediately fell asleep, allowing him to passby in safety.121IVAN BELYANINOVICH"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Once inside, he was greeted by the tsaritsaof the Copper Kingdom. She did not knowwhere Nastas'ya of the Golden Braid waskept, but she suggested that Ivan journeyonward to the Silver Kingdom, for the tsar-itsa of that kingdom, her middle sister, mightknow the whereabouts of Ivan’s mother.Thetsaritsa gave Ivan a copper ball to follow andbade him farewell.Outside Ivan placed the ball on theground and followed it all the way to theSilver Kingdom.There he placated the drag-ons that guarded the gates in the same wayhe had the others, and on entering, wasgreeted by the tsaritsa of the Silver King-dom. She, like her sister, did not know thewhereabouts of Ivan’s mother, but she gavehim a silver ball to follow.This Ivan did until he came to the GoldenKingdom. Once more he quietened thedragons that stood on guard and entered thegleaming palace. Inside he was greeted by thetsaritsa of the Golden Kingdom, whose namewas Elena the Fair. She knew exactly whereNastas'ya of the Golden Braid was beingheld. As had her two sisters, she gave Ivan aball—this one made of gold—to follow,which would lead him to where his motherwas being held by Whirlwind.Ivan duly followed the ball until he cameto a palace that was even more impressivethan those he had just visited, this one shin-ing with diamonds and other preciousstones. Pacifying the six-headed dragons thatguarded the gates, he entered the great hall ofthe palace, where he found his mother seated upon a magnificent throne anddressed in the most wondrous clothes Ivanhad ever seen.Amazed to see her son, Nastas'ya ex-plained that the secret of Whirlwind’sstrength lay in a barrel in the wine cellars ofthe palace that contained a magical water,which bestowed tremendous strength onwhoever drank it. She then told her son howhe might defeat Whirlwind, who was due toreturn at any minute. Ivan took a drink fromthe barrel his mother had shown him, andthen he substituted a barrel of water thatsapped the strength of those who drank it.He then hid beneath his mother’s cloak towatch.As Whirlwind returned and leaned overNastas'ya, Ivan reached out and grasped themace that Whirlwind always carried. BearingIvan high into the air,Whirlwind tried, with-out success, to shake him free. Returning tothe palace, Whirlwind drank from the barrelwhich Ivan had exchanged for the strength-giving water, and his strength was completelysapped. Having drunk from the good barrel,Ivan was filled with tremendous power; andwith a single blow of his sword, he decapi-tated Whirlwind. He burned the body andscattered the ashes. Then he quickly releasedhis mother, and the two made their way backthrough the three kingdoms, with Ivan free-ing each tsaritsa in turn. Finally all five cameto the top of the mountain at the bottom ofwhich Vasilii and Peter were still waiting.After Ivan lowered their mother and thethree maidens down to Vasilii and Peter, thejealous brothers spurred their horses towardhome, intending to claim Ivan’s success astheir own.Ivan wandered back to the palace ofWhirlwind, where he found a small whis-tle, on which he blew. Instantly two ser-vants appeared, called Lame and One-Eye—for that is what they were. Ivanrequested food, and the servants, who hadserved Whirlwind before, magically made amagnificent banquet appear. After he hadeaten and slept, Ivan asked them if theycould return him to his own land.The nextmoment, Ivan found himself standing inthe middle of the marketplace outside hisfather’s palace.Instead of going straight home to find outwhat had happened to his two brothers, Ivanhired himself out as an apprentice to a shoe-maker.That night, as Ivan and the shoemakerslept, Lame and One-Eye made a wonderfulpair of shoes that the shoemaker went intothe market to sell the very next morning. AsElena was soon to be married, having been122IVAN BELYANINOVICH"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"brought back from the mountains by Vasiliiand Peter, she needed new shoes for herwedding. Seeing the pair that Lame andOne-Eye had made, she knew that theycould only have been made by someonewho had come from the kingdoms at the topof the mountains. She immediately boughtthem and instructed the shoemaker that hewas also to make her wedding dress—themost magnificent dress anyone had seen—bythe very next morning, or he would behanged.That night, having drunk himself into astupor, the shoemaker slept and dreamed ofhis impending death, as Lame and One-Eyemade the dress. The following day Elenacame for the dress, and again she could tellinstantly who had made it. To be absolutelycertain, she set the shoemaker a final, impos-sible task. By the very next morning he wasto have built her a palace out of gold that wasto stand in the middle of the sea, connectedto dry land by a golden bridge covered witha fine velvet carpet, with a garden on eitherside filled with trees.That night the shoemaker became sodrunk that he had to be carried to his bed;and when he rose the next day, he continuedto drink, for he did not want to be soberwhen they came to hang him. However,Lame and One-Eye had once more com-pleted the task. Elena asked the shoemakerhow he had managed to complete such animpossible task. Not knowing what to say,the shoemaker in turn asked Ivan, and thetruth finally came out.Tsar Bel Belyanin wasso furious with Vasilii and Peter that hewanted to have them executed, but Ivaninterceded. In the end, Ivan married Elena,Peter married the tsaritsa of the SilverKingdom, and Vasilii married the tsaritsa ofthe Copper Kingdom.

Following a period when power wasfirst in the hands of his mother, Elena, andthen after her murder in 1537, of the boyars,Ivan finally took the throne in 1547 andbecame the first ruler to style himself tsar'—Russian for “Caesar.” In an attempt to con-solidate his absolute power and undermineanyone who was in a position to contest it,Ivan initiated a series of reforms that weak-ened the upper nobility—the princes andboyars—in favor of the minor gentry. In1549 he convoked a legislative assembly andinaugurated a period of legal reform of bothstate and church that was to last for a decade,establishing a new code of law and a radicalsystem of local self-government. In 1552 heliberated Kazan' from the Tatars, and twoyears later, in 1554, he occupied Astrakhan'.In 1558 he invaded Livonia and captured theimportant Baltic seaport of Narva.In 1565, rumors of a boyar uprisingbrought about an offer by Ivan to abdicate;but he was reinstated by popular demandwith sweeping powers to take whateveractions he deemed fit against his opponents.These powers led to a prolonged period ofarrests and summary executions. In 1570Ivan ravaged the city of Novgorod. In 1571his capital city, Moscow, was overrun andburned by Crimean Tatars. (Ivan took bloodyrevenge against the Tatars the following year.)In the last years of his reign, in an attempt toredress some of his excesses, Ivan posthu-mously rehabilitated many whom he hadexecuted during the middle period of hisreign. However, in 1581 he accidentallykilled his eldest son in a fit of anger, whichleft power in the hands of Ivan’s sickly andfeeble-minded second son Fyodor afterIvan’s death in 1584.Ivan Groznyi is featured in a story titledThe Tsar Resolves to Kill His Son.This bylinaopens during a feast held in Moscow inhonor of the state’s warriors both male andfemale. During the feast, Ivan Groznyi learnsthat Ivan Tsarevich, his son, has conspiredagainst him. He immediately has him ar-rested and dragged off to the banks of theMoskva River, where the executioner’s blockawaits him. The tsarina, Ivan Tsarevich’smother, goes to the house of her brother andtells him what has occurred. Her brother,Nikita Romanov, hurries to the banks of theriver, where he stops the execution and thenfinds out who betrayed his nephew. NikitaRomanov then seeks out the informer andkills him. Ivan Groznyi acknowledges hismistake and rewards Nikita Romanov forpreventing the death of the tsarevich.However, it is this very tsarevich whom his-tory records as having been killed by hisfather in 1581; so even if the story is true andNikita Romanov did manage to save theyouth this once, Ivan Groznyi eventuallyaccomplished the evil deed by his own hand.See also:Astrakhan'; Boyars; Bylina; Crimea;Ivan IV; Ivan the Terrible; Ivan Tsarevich;Kazan'; Livonia; Moscow; Nikita Romanov;Novgorod;TatarsReferences:Chadwick 1964; Chistov 1967IVAN KUPALORussiaThe feast of midsummer, occurring at thesummer equinox, during which the fertilityof Mother Earth and married women wascelebrated. The entire community partici-pated in rituals that symbolically linked thefertility of human mothers with that of thefields. The female members of the commu-nity led in the orgiastic celebrations, whichinvolved ritual bathing by both men andwomen in lakes and rivers (Kupalois derivedfrom the verb kupat'[to bathe]).The earliest records of the festivities ofIvan Kupalo come from twelfth-centurychurch chronicles that almost always confusethem with the Rusaliia. These ancient writ-ings say that the oldest unmarried peasantwomen would be dressed as brides and led tothe banks of a river or lake.There they woulddance and worship the goddess, then jumpinto the water, and later return to the villageto sprinkle the houses with the sanctifiedwater. After the water rituals, bonfires would124IVAN KUPALO"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"be lit and the villagers would jump over andthrough the flames.Kupalo, the deity central to these celebra-tions, had a female counterpart in Kupal'-nitsa. In regions where different names wereapplied to the deity central to the festival,each likewise had a female counterpart.Thus, Lado was accompanied by Lada,Kostromo by Kostroma, and Iarilo by Iarila.The duality of the deity central to the festi-val demonstrates the need for the male andthe female to complete the necessary circle,although at all times the importance of thefemale spirit far outweighed that of the male.See also:Iarila; Iarilo; Kostroma; Kostromo (-Kostrobunko); Kupal'nitsa; Kupalo; Lada;Lado; Mother Earth; RusaliiaReferences:Cross and Sherbowitz-Wetzor1953; Mansikka 1922; Snegirev 1837–39;Zabylin 1880IVAN SAVEL'EVICHRussiaA young seal-hunter who lived in the city ofArkhangel'sk, in northern Russia, and whoaccording to one story became captivated bythe unearthly beauty of a russalka and spentone long winter in her company.While seal hunting in winter on the bleakislands of Novaya Zemlya, well within theArctic Circle, Ivan spent many lonely nightsalone in his hut playing his balalaika. Onenight the oil in his lamp ran out and he con-tinued to play in the dark. As he played, heheard the sound of someone dancing insidehis hut. Knowing that he was alone, he wasfrightened and quickly refilled and relit hislamp. The hut was empty. The followingnight the same thing happened. Finally hehid the lit lamp behind a thick curtain, andas soon as the sound of dancing started, hedrew back the curtain to reveal a young girl.This girl explained to Ivan that she was arussalka but because she had a human father,she was able to remain out of the water foras long as she liked, provided she was in thepresence of only one person. Ivan fell hope-lessly in love with the russalka, and theyspent the winter together, during which timeeverything they ever wanted or needed mag-ically appeared. However, when spring cameIvan had to return to his home to sell hiscatch. As they parted, the russalka gave himinstructions on how he might find her again.Some time later Ivan found he could notlive without the russalka. Rememberingwhat his lover had told him, he sought outher home: He climbed a tree that hungabove the water, and at the stroke of midday,he dived into the water. As he reached thebottom of the river, his lover rushed outfrom the weeds and embraced him. Ivanstayed a long time beneath the waters of thatriver, but in the end he longed to returnhome. Remembering that anyone could beprotected from the charms of the russalka bythe holy cross, he made the sign and wasimmediately transported back home. How-ever, having crossed himself, he could neveragain return to his russalka.See also:Arkhangel'sk; Novaya Zemlya;Rus(s)alki (~ulki)IVAN THE DRAGON KILLERUkraineA young tsarevich who set out to rescue hisneighbor who was at the mercy of a dragonthat lived atop an ever growing glass moun-tain.

Ivan thanked theant and rode on.Having introduced himself to the tsar, andtold him his aim, Ivan rode to the foot of theglass mountain which by this time coveredalmost three quarters of the kingdom. Ivantethered his horse to a tree and placed thegrain of wheat at the base of the mountain.Then he hid amongst the trees and watched.125IVAN THE DRAGON KILLER"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"As he looked on, the grain of wheat began toglow, and as it did so a trickle of water beganto flow from the base of the mountain. Thattrickle quickly became a raging torrent asthe mountain continued to melt, and Ivanhad to find higher ground or be swept away.The dragon, on returning to his lair, sawthe water gushing from the base of themountain and swooped down to see whatwas causing it. As the dragon landed the tor-rent of water became even more intense, anda great wall of water dashed the dragon to itsdeath and then carried its remains away. Ivanthen rushed onto what remained of themountain, released the princess, and togetherthey hurried back to her father. Several dayslater Ivan and the princess were married,Ivan inheriting the kingdom some years laterwhen the tsar abdicated in his favor.See also:Dragon; Glass Mountain,TheIVAN THE FOOLRussiaSeeSilver RoanIVAN THE GREATRussiaThe ruler and Grand Duke of Russia from1462 to 1505, also known as Ivan III(1440–1505). Ivan successfully assertedauthority over a number of Russian princi-palities and routed the Tatar occupiers, unit-ing these lands for the first time under a sin-gle Russian ruler. In 1472 he marriedSophia, a niece of Constantine XI Palæo-logus Dragases (1404–1453, the last By-zantine emperor), assumed the title “Ruler ofall Russia,” and adopted the two-headedeagle—the emblem of the ByzantineEmpire—as his royal crest.See also:Byzantine Empire;TatarsIVAN THE GUARDRussiaWhen Nemal Chelovek, a sorcerer, kid-napped the only daughter of an unnamedtsar and his wife, the tsar immediately offeredhalf his kingdom, and his daughter’s hand inmarriage, to whoever found her and broughther home. Many men tried and failed, andthe tsar grew ever more despondent. Onenight a lowly guard named Ivan was standingwatch in the tsar’s garden when he overheardtwo crows talking. These crows talked abouta sorcerer named Nemal Chelovek who hadonce visited the realm and made off with thedaughter of the tsar, going so far as to namethe kingdom in which the sorcerer lived anddescribe how he might be defeated.Ivan listened intently, and when his watchcame to an end, he asked the tsar’s leave tosearch for his daughter.The tsar was less thanresponsive to the idea of a humble soldiergoing to look for his daughter, especiallywhen so many nobler men had tried andfailed. However, when Ivan assured the tsarthat he would not fail, the tsar relented.However, he warned the soldier that if hefailed, he would pay with his life.Two days later Ivan set sail for theSouthern Seas. En route he made a detourand came ashore at a small island on whichlived two leshii who had jointly inherited theself-cutting Samosek Sword some thirty yearsbefore. As Ivan stepped onto the island heheard the two leshii fighting over whose thesword truly was. When he approached, theyasked him to act as their judge. Ivan agreed.He proposed that he hold the sword and thenshoot an arrow into the woods. Ownership ofthe sword would be awarded to the leshiiwho brought the arrow back to Ivan. Theleshii readily agreed. Ivan then shot an arrowfar into the woods, and the two leshii ran offand quickly found it, and then fell to fightingover whose it was. Ivan reboarded his shipand set sail with the Samosek Sword for thekingdom of Nemal Chelovek.Two days later the ship landed and Ivanstepped ashore. He found Nemal Chelovek’smansion unguarded, for the sorcerer neverimagined anyone would be foolish enoughto enter his domain. Ivan slipped into themansion and quickly located the daughter ofthe tsar, who told him that Nemal Chelovekintended her to become the bride of his126IVAN THE FOOL"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"nephew the Gorynich, a terrible dragon.Ivan told her not to worry, for he woulddeliver her.When she heard this, the princessgave Ivan her ring, a token that signified thatthey were betrothed and would become hus-band and wife upon returning home.At that moment, Nemal Chelovekreturned to his mansion and stormed intothe great hall where Ivan stood with theprincess.When the sorcerer saw Ivan, he casta spell that made him grow until his headbrushed the ceiling, and then he rushed toattack. Ivan, however, simply lifted theSamosek Sword, which flew through the airand neatly decapitated the oncoming giant.Then the sword went through the mansionand killed all of Nemal Chelovek’s servantsbefore returning neatly to Ivan’s hand.Several days later Ivan presented the tsarwith his daughter, expressing the hope thatthey would soon marry. The tsar, however,tried to get out of his promise by saying thata foreign prince had asked for the princess’shand and would not look kindly upon beingpassed over for a mere soldier. The soldierwas not to be put off, and he showed the tsarthat he already wore the princess’s ring,whereupon the tsar relented and called forthe wedding preparations to begin.During the wedding feast a messengerrushed into the hall and announced that therejected prince had invaded the kingdomwith a vast army. Amid the confusion, Ivanslipped out of the palace, strapped on theSamosek Sword, and rode out to meet theadvancing army. Then, releasing the sword,he decimated the army, leaving only theprince and his generals alive. Ivan thenreturned to his new wife and calmly re-ported the news, and the feast continued.A few weeks later news came that theprince had formed a new army and wasagain on the march. Ivan again rode out,annihilated the army, and returned un-scathed; this time, only the prince survived.The prince wrote in secret to Ivan’s wife,asking her to help him. The princess foundout about the Samosek Sword and had thepalace armorer make an exact replica, whichshe substituted for the real sword. Soon Ivanrode out to attack the army of the prince athird time. Without the magical weapon, hehad to fight as any normal soldier, andthough he killed a great many of the enemy,in the end he was toppled from his horse andleft for dead.The tsar rejoiced that his daughter was atlast free to marry a man of royal blood, andwithin hours the wedding had beenarranged. That night, as the wedding feastprogressed in the palace, Ivan awoke on thebattlefield, surrounded by dead bodies. As hewalked, he grew increasingly hungry. Hecame to a bush that had yellow berries, andwithout thinking, he ate two berries.Immediately his head began to ache terribly.When he put his hand to his head, he washorrified to find that it had sprouted twohorns. Farther on, he came across anotherbush, this one with red berries, and as he wasstill hungry, he ate two berries. Once againhe experienced a crushing headache, andwhen he felt his head, he was relieved to findthat the horns had disappeared.Realizing the potential of the berries, Ivancollected a pocketful of both yellow and redberries and set off toward the tsar’s palace,where he could clearly hear the sounds ofthe wedding celebration. Back at the palace,Ivan disguised himself as a beggar and gaveone of the palace maids some yellow berriesto give to the princess in celebration of hermarriage to the prince. The maid placed theberries on the princess’s pillow. That night,when she came to her room, the princess atethe berries. As soon as she swallowed them,she had a splitting headache, and two hornssprouted from her forehead.So distressed was the tsar that he offeredhalf his kingdom to whoever would cure hisdaughter. Still disguised as a beggar, Ivancame to see the tsar and promised to cure theprincess. The tsar himself led the beggar tohis daughter’s room; but before entering, thebeggar stopped the tsar and told him that thecure might not be painless and that under no127IVAN THE GUARD"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"circumstances were they to be disturbed, forthen the cure would not work. The tsar letthe beggar into the room and told the palaceguard to let no one else enter until the beg-gar came out again, no matter what noisesthey might hear inside.Inside the room Ivan discarded his dis-guise and took a heavy wooden club out ofhis tunic. Then he approached the princess,who stared at him in disbelief and thenscreamed as Ivan began to beat her black andblue for her treachery. Then he told her thathe had the cure for her affliction, but hewould give it to her only if she returned theSamosek Sword to him. She ran to a cup-board, took out the sword, and gave it backto Ivan. He took the sword, ran to find theprince, and then unleashed it, watching indelight as the head of the prince rolled ontothe floor.Then Ivan returned to the princessand gave her two red berries, and the hornsinstantly vanished.The princess fell into Ivan’s arms, but hepushed her away,telling her that as she hadbeen unfaithful and as her father and motherwere likewise dishonorable, he would banishthem from the kingdom and rule in theirstead. From that day forth Ivan ruled thekingdom with a fair hand; and thanks to theSamosek Sword, the kingdom remained safefrom all would-be invaders.See also:Leshii (~y); Nemal Chelovek;Samosek SwordIVAN THE MARE’S SONSiberia—TungusThe hero of a story that comes from theTungus people of Siberia. Ivan’s mother wasa mare that had escaped from a peasant cou-ple who intended to eat her. As she ranthrough the forest, she came upon the corpseof a Tungus warrior, and licking his body, sheinstantly conceived a son, whom she calledIvan. She raised the boy alone. One day, shetold him the time had come when he mustfend for himself, adding that he should leavehis arrow standing upright in the groundevery night so that she would know he wasalive. If she found the arrow lying on theground, then she would know that he wasdead.Ivan promised his mother that he woulddo so, and left. Several days later he came toa clearing in the forest. In the middle of thisclearing was a young man on his hands andknees. When Ivan asked him what he wasdoing, the youth replied that he was lookingfor his arrow. Ivan found the arrow andhanded it to the young man, who told himhis name was Ivan the Sun’s Son. The twoagreed that from that day forth they wouldlive as brothers.A few days later the two Ivans returned tothe clearing, where they found anotheryouth searching the ground. He too had losthis arrow, and again Ivan the Mare’s Sonfound it. This youth’s name was Ivan theMoon’s Son, and he too agreed to live astheir brother. In the middle of the clearingthey built themselves a home of woodenpoles covered with the skins of the animalsthey had hunted. Every night each Ivanplaced his arrow upright in the ground out-side their home.One morning, to their surprise, theyfound that during the night their arrows hadbeen richly decorated. Ivan the Moon’s Sonsaid that he would keep watch that night andcatch the culprit, but he fell asleep, and in themorning their arrows had been decoratedonce again. Exactly the same thing happenedwhen Ivan the Sun’s Son stayed on guard.The third night, Ivan the Mare’s Son said hewould stand watch.On the stroke of midnight three heronsflew down into the clearing, smashed them-selves against the ground, and instantlybecame three beautiful maidens. Eachplucked the arrow of the man she professedto love from the ground and set about deco-rating it. Ivan crept from his hiding place andhid their heron’s wings and feathers. Whenthe three maidens had finished the arrows,they could not find their heron skins. Theeldest maiden called out for whoever hadhidden them to come forward, saying that if128IVAN THE MARE’S SON"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"he were older than they, then he would betheir father. If he were younger, he would betheir brother; but if he were the same age,then he would become her husband.Ivan crept from his place of concealmentand revealed himself to the eldest of the threemaidens, who told him that her name wasMarfida. The other maidens were Marfida’ssisters, and the three agreed to become thewives of the three Ivans. All six lived happilyin their home in the clearing.However, one day when Ivan and hisbrothers returned from their day’s huntingthey noticed that their wives were becom-ing very pale and thin. On investigationthey discovered several holes that hadappeared in the ground beneath theirhome. Puzzled, Ivan and his brothers de-cided that instead of hunting the followingday, they would stand guard. The followingday, while his brothers dozed in the warmthof the sun, Ivan the Mare’s Son saw a hugeserpent crawl out of one of the holesbeneath their home.Wrapping itself aroundthe three wives, it started to suck theirblood. Ivan drew his bow and shot the ser-pent, which quickly slithered back into thehole whence it had come, warning Ivan asit went that it would return three days later,riding on a cloud of fire.For three days the three Ivans made asmany arrows as they could before takingturns to watch for the approach of the cloudthat would bring the serpent. Ivan theMoon’s Son saw it first. Ivan the Sun’s Sonwatched it approach. By the time Ivan theMare’s Son came to see, it was directly over-head, with the serpent in the middle, sur-rounded by his army of demons.A mighty battle ensued. Ivan the Moon’sSon was killed first. Some time later Ivan theSun’s Son was killed too. Ivan the Mare’s Sonfought on alone until he had reduced thearmy of demons to a third of its original size.Then he too was killed, his head cut cleanfrom his body. The serpent gathered up thethree maidens and disappeared with themdown one of the holes beneath the house.Ivan the Mare’s Son’s mother later foundhis arrow lying on the ground among thebodies of the demons. She located his bodyand his head, licked the body all over, andkicked it with her hind legs. The bodybecame whole again. She licked and kickedthe body again, and the body stirred. Oncemore she licked and kicked her son, and hejumped to his feet, fully revived. Next theysought out and found the bodies of theother two Ivans, whom the mare alsobrought back to life. She then left the threebrothers discussing how they might rescuetheir wives.After hunting for three days, theystitched a long rope from the hides they hadcollected. To one end of this rope theyattached a leather cradle. Climbing into thecradle Ivan the Mare’s Son was lowereddown the hole through which the serpenthad originally appeared. At the bottom hefound himself in the underworld, the homeof the serpent. Following a barren track,Ivan came to a lake. There he saw threewomen—Marfida and her sisters—comingto draw water. Ivan fired an arrow in frontof his wife to tell her that he was there.After the sisters had drawn water, Marfidalagged behind the others, and she and Ivanwere reunited.Marfida told Ivan that he was to kill theserpent at exactly midday, while it slept in itshammock. Ivan did as she instructed, and heand the three maidens made their way backto the leather cradle. The wives of Ivan theMoon’s Son and Ivan the Sun’s Son werehoisted up first. When it was Marfida’s turn,she beseeched Ivan the Mare’s Son to gofirst, but he refused. Having raised Marfida,Ivan the Moon’s Son and Ivan the Sun’s Soncut the rope and threw the cradle back downthe hole, thus trapping Ivan the Mare’s Sonin the underworld.Once more his mother came to the res-cue. Having discovered him lying dead at thebottom of the hole, she restored him to lifeas she had done before.Then she told him tohunt until they had enough meat for the129IVAN THE MARE’S SON"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"journey back to the land of the living. Ivandid as instructed, and finally they set out.Each time the mare turned her head, Ivanfed her some meat. As they neared the exit,he ran out of meat; so he cut off a toe fromhis right foot and fed that to his mother.Next he cut off his calf, and finally, an ear.After they had left the underworld, Ivan’smother coughed up the pieces of her sonthat she had been fed, and licking hiswounds, made him whole again.Three days later Ivan came acrossMarfida, who was being made to drag aheavy load as punishment for remainingfaithful to her husband. Ivan lifted her ontohis shoulders, and then caught up with andkilled his two false brothers. Taking thethree heron skins from his pocket, heplucked a few feathers from each and madehimself a pair of wings, on which he flewwith the three maidens to their homeland,where they lived out their days in peace andhappiness.See also:Ivan the Moon’s Son; Ivan the Sun’sSon; Marfida; Siberia;Tungus; Underworld,TheIVAN THE MOON’S SONSiberia—TungusYouth whose lost arrow was found by Ivanthe Mare’s Son, whom he thereafter treatedas his brother.These two lived together, shar-ing a home with a third “brother”—Ivan theSun’s Son. During a battle with a huge ser-pent that had been sucking the blood of thethree brothers’ wives, the three Ivans werekilled and their wives carried off to the ser-pent’s underworld lair. All three wererestored to life by Ivan’s mother, the mare.Then the two other Ivans lowered Ivan theMare’s Son into the underworld to rescuetheir wives. After he had found and rescuedthe women, Ivan the Mare’s Son was left fordead by his false brothers, who made off withall three wives. He was rescued by hismother, and killed both Ivan the Moon’s Sonand Ivan the Sun’s Son.See also:Ivan the Mare’s Son; Ivan the Sun’sSon; Underworld,TheIVAN THE MUTERussiaA young tsarevich, born without the abilityto speak. At the age of twelve he was told byhis favorite groom that he was about to havea sister, but was warned by the same groomthat the girl would be a fearsome witch whowould eat her family and everyone whocame near her. The groom advised him toask his father for a swift horse, the swiftest hisfather owned, so that he might escape beforeit was too late.The tsar, delighted to hear his son speakfor the first time, personally picked out thehorse for his son. Having traveled quite a dis-tance, the young tsarevich started to look fora place to live. First he came across two oldseamstresses, who told him that they wouldbe glad to take him in but they did not havelong to live, for once they had finished thework they were doing, it would be time forthem to die.Brokenhearted, Ivan left and traveled on,next meeting a man whose task in life was touproot massive trees. Called Uproot Oak,this man too would have been happy to takeIvan in, but he too only had a short time tolive, for as he told the youth, when he haduprooted all the oaks in the forest he wasclearing, then it would be his time to die.Once more overcome with grief, Ivanjourneyed on until he met a giant of a manwho was busy tipping a range of mountainsonto their sides. This man, whose name wasOverturn Mountain, told Ivan that he wouldgladly take him in if it were not for the factthat his days would be at an end after he hadoverturned the entire mountain range.Down at heart, Ivan rode on until hecame to the home of Sun’s Sister. She tookthe youth in and treated him as her own.After a while Ivan began to think about hisfamily. He climbed a mountain, gazed farinto the distance in the direction of hishome, and cried.When he returned home toSun’s Sister, he said that the tears in his eyeswere due to the wind. Twice more this hap-pened. However, Sun’s Sister had forbidden130IVAN THE MOON’S SON"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the wind to blow, so she knew that the tearshad another cause. Ivan finally had to tell herwhat was wrong.As Ivan prepared to leave, Sun’s Sister gavehim three items to help him on his journey:a comb, a brush, and two apples that had thepower to rejuvenate whoever ate them. Onhis way Ivan met his friends once more.Overturn Mountain had only two mountainsleft to topple before he died. Ivan threwdown the brush, and a massive mountainrange sprang from the earth. Uproot Oak hadonly two trees left to uproot. Ivan threwdown his comb, and a huge forest of oak treesappeared. Finally Ivan came to the two seam-stresses, who were stitching the last seam oftheir piece. Ivan gave each of them an apple,and they were instantly young upon the veryfirst bite. In return they gave Ivan a kerchiefthat they told him had magical properties.At last Ivan came to his home and waswelcomed by his sister, who asked him toplay on the psaltery while she prepared ameal. After she went out, a mouse warnedIvan that his sister had really gone to sharpenher teeth. The mouse offered to run up anddown the strings of the psaltery so that Ivancould make his escape.When Ivan’s sister discovered how she hadbeen tricked, she set off in hot pursuit andwas soon catching up with Ivan. Seeing herriding like the wind after him, Ivan threwdown the kerchief, which immediatelybecame a huge, deep lake. Swimming acrossit slowed Ivan’s sister down and allowed himto increase his lead over her. Again shestarted to close the gap just as Ivan rode pastUproot Oak, who blocked the road with ahuge pile of oak trees, which Ivan’s sister hadto gnaw her way through. Again she closedin on her brother just as he passed OverturnMountain, who blocked the road with a pileof towering mountains. Finally Ivan made itsafely back to the home of Sun’s Sister, wholocked him safely inside.Yet his sister wouldnot give up.Finally she suggested that they should beweighed on a huge pair of scales, the heavierhaving the right to destroy the other. Ivan saton the scales first; then the witch, his sister,sat down. She was so heavy that Ivan shot offinto the heavens, straight into the Sun’sSister’s palace, where he remained securefrom his sister’s rivalry.See also:Overturn Mountain; Sun’s Sister;Uproot OakIVAN THE PEARussiaThe youngest son of Tsar Svetozar and hiswife, and brother to two other princes, bothunnamed, and to a sister, Vasilissa of theGolden Braid. Ivan the Pea was miraculouslyconceived when his mother swallowed asmall pea, which grew inside her until shegave birth to a son. Ivan the Pea grew at avery fast rate, and by the age of ten he wasthe strongest knight in all the kingdom.Learning of the fate of his sister, who hadbeen carried away by a dragon, and his twobrothers who had gone in search of her, Ivanthe Pea vowed to find them and bring themhome.For three days he rode, until he came to asmall wooden house on chickens’ legs in theforest that rotated in the wind.The old cronethat lived in that house gave him directionsto the land of the dragon, in return for whichIvan the Pea promised to bring her some ofthe life-restoring water that the dragonowned.Finally arriving at the dragon’s goldenpalace, which rested on a single silver pillar,Ivan the Pea found his captive sister. Heignored his sister’s pleas to run for his life,although his two brothers already lay dead inthe vaults below the palace. Instead, Ivan thePea had the court smith make him a hugemace that weighed five hundred poods(18,000 lbs or 8,190 kg). This mace tookforty hours to make, and fifty men wereneeded to lift it; but Ivan the Pea lifted it eas-ily with one hand and tossed it high into theair. So high did it fly that three hours passedbefore it came down again. Ivan the Pea eas-ily caught it with one hand, the impact not131IVAN THE PEA"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"harming him in the least, although it bentthe mace slightly. Ivan the Pea simply laid themace across his knees and straightened it outagain.Soon the dragon came home and leapedon Ivan the Pea; but Ivan simply steppedaside and killed the dragon with one throwof the mace, which flew through the palacewalls and landed many hundreds of milesaway. Ivan the Pea then found the Water ofLife and Death, filled a flask with it for theold crone in the forest, restored his brothersto life by sprinkling some of the water overthem, and then returned to his homelandwith his sister and brothers, stopping enroute to deliver the flask to the old crone.After the death of his father, Ivan the Peabecame the tsar.Although the old crone living in the for-est is not named in this story, it is generallyagreed that it is none other than the witchBaba-Yaga.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Dragon;Svetozar;Vasilis(s)a of the Golden Braid;Water of Life and Death,TheIVAN THE SOLDIERRussiaA professional soldier who, after twenty-fiveyears of service to an unnamed tsar, was dis-charged and sent on his way with nothing inhis knapsack but a few meager rations. Afterseveral days’ travel, when his rations had beenexhausted, Ivan came across a flock of geeseswimming on a lake. He killed three andhurriedly packed them into his knapsack.Then he made his way to the nearest town.There he knocked on the door of a run-down farmhouse and asked the old womanwho answered the door to roast a goose forhim, keeping the second as payment for hertrouble, and the third in exchange for a goodquantity of wine.That night Ivan dined as ifhe were a tsar, and then he settled down tosmoke his pipe. As he relaxed, he noticed awonderful mansion a short distance away.He asked the old woman whose home itwas, and she replied that it had been built bythe richest merchant in the town, though hehad never dared live there. As soon as thehouse had been completed, a horde of evildemons had moved in and made the placeuninhabitable.Ivan asked the old woman how he mightfind the rich merchant, and then he bade herfarewell. A little while later he entered theshop of the rich merchant and asked for per-mission to sleep in the empty house thatnight. The merchant was horrified, for heknew that sleeping in the house would meancertain death; but Ivan argued that as a sol-dier he had cheated death on several occa-sions, and at length the merchant agreed,supplying Ivan with a dozen candles, threepounds of dried walnuts, and one largeboiled beetroot, which Ivan placed in hisknapsack. Then he made his way to theempty house.There he made himself comfortable, litthe candles, and settled down to see whatmight happen. As the town clock struckmidnight, the first shriek filled the house.Soon the house was filled by a horde ofdemons with red, horned heads and greeneyes that glowed with evil. When they sawIvan they celebrated the fine meal they weresoon to have, but Ivan simply stared back atthem, and in a threatening voice, dared themto try it. The demons were taken aback andeven frightened by this unexpected response;so the eldest demon stepped forward andchallenged Ivan to a trial of strength. Ivanagreed.The first test was to squeeze water from astone. The eldest demon went first andsqueezed his stone so hard that it crumbledinto a heap of fine dust. Ivan applauded andthen took the large boiled beetroot from hisbag and slowly squeezed it with great deliber-ation so that all the demons could see the“blood” he was squeezing from it.The demonsstared in disbelief; and in the silence, Ivandelved into his knapsack, took out a handful ofwalnuts, and began to munch on them.The demons asked what he was eating,and he replied that he was eating walnuts,132IVAN THE SOLDIER"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"adding that none of them could even start tochew his walnuts.The eldest demon laughedand told Ivan to throw him one. Ivanreached down into his knapsack, took out asmall stone, and threw this to the demon,who without looking at what he wasputting in his mouth, began to chew.However, no matter how hard he chewed,he could not even start to crush the stone.All the while, Ivan stood there, popping onewalnut after another into his mouth, chew-ing them up with ease.Ivan then turned to the demons andderided them for the inability of their leaderto beat him in these simple contests. He thensuggested that they might redeem themselvesa little by showing him how easily demonscould squeeze into a small place—a spacesuch as his knapsack, for example. Thedemons took the bait; and as soon as the lastdemon had crammed itself into the knap-sack, Ivan bent down and quickly fastened it.Then Ivan settled down and slept soundlythe rest of the night.The following morninghe was awakened by two servants sent by therich merchant, who were more than sur-prised to see Ivan still alive.Ivan scoffed at them and asked them toshow him the way to the local blacksmith,which they did. He set off with his knapsack.At the smithy he told the three smiths tohammer his knapsack flat. Before long, allthree smiths were hammering at the knap-sack with all their might, the demons insidesquealing for mercy. Ivan refused to allow thesmiths to give up until the demons promisednever to trouble the town or the merchantagain and declared that they would gladlypay a king’s ransom for their freedom.Ivan relented and let out all the demonsexcept the leader, keeping him in return forthe king’s ransom promised. A short timelater a small demon returned, carrying asmall leather pouch. Ivan took the pouch andfound that it contained nothing. Thinkingthat the demons were trying to trick him,Ivan turned to the smiths and told them toresume their hammering on the knapsack.The demon still inside squealed in horrorand hurriedly told Ivan that the pouch wasno ordinary one. All Ivan had to do wasthink about what he wanted, and it wouldappear in the pouch. Likewise, if Ivan were toopen the pouch and tell something to getinto it, there was no way anything couldresist his command. Ivan tried the pouch, andwhen he found that it worked, he declaredhimself satisfied and set the demon free—with a stern warning that the next time theymet would be the demon’s last.Ivan then went to the rich merchant andtold him that his new home was now free ofdemons and that he would never be troubledagain. The merchant quickly moved into hishouse and threw a great banquet in honor ofthe soldier; but when he offered Ivan areward, Ivan refused it, and the followingmorning he set off again toward his homevillage. Several days passed before Ivanreached his village, where he was greeted byhis aged mother. She told him that his fatherhad passed away five years before. Thatevening, with the aid of the pouch, Ivan andhis mother ate a feast fit for a tsar.The pouch helped Ivan restore the for-tunes of his family. He used it to providemoney to build a new home and buy newequipment; and if ever the cupboards werebare, all he had to do was use the pouch, andthe cupboards were full once again. For sevenyears Ivan and his mother lived well; but thenthe old soldier fell ill, and after a few days hewas confronted by Death himself. For severalminutes Ivan and Death argued, but Deathremained intransigent; so with the last of hisfeeble strength, Ivan reached for his pouch.Within seconds he had managed not only totrap Death inside his pouch but also to fullyrecover from his illness.Ivan agreed to let Death out of the pouchonly after Death promised to let him liveanother thirty years and not to take the lifeof any other living person during that time.For those thirty years, Ivan and his motherlived a comfortable life; but one day, thirtyyears to the day after Ivan had released133IVAN THE SOLDIER"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Death, Death came to him and told him thathis time was up.Ivan shrugged and told Death to bringhim his coffin. Death grinned and broughtthe coffin to Ivan, telling him to jump in.However, Ivan replied that he was not pre-pared to get into his coffin without instruc-tions on how to do so properly; he was a sol-dier, after all. So he asked Death to show himthe correct manner in which one shouldenter a coffin. Death complied, whereuponIvan slammed the lid of the coffin, nailed itdown, took it to the nearby river, and castDeath adrift.For several years Death floated, first downthe river and then on the open sea. Then,during a particularly violent storm, the cof-fin was smashed against some rocks, andDeath was released. He set out immediatelyto find the cunning old soldier. Back atIvan’s home, Death hid until he thought hecould take Ivan by surprise, and then heleaped out of the shadows. However, Ivanwas not to be outmaneuvered by Death, andhe quickly grabbed an empty grain sack andbrandished it at Death. Thinking the sackwas Ivan’s pouch, Death took to his heels.And that was the last anyone ever saw ofDeath (at least, according to one version ofthe legend). After that, Death took to creep-ing up on people unexpectedly; but henever again called on Ivan, who is said to bealive to this day.Another version of the legend starts in thesame way but differs after Ivan capturesDeath in his pouch. Instead of extracting apromise from Death, Ivan takes the pouch tothe Briansk Woods and hangs it from the topbranches of the tallest tree. From that dayforward, no one in the whole world died.Ivan forgot all about Death hanging from thetree, and lived on in comfort with hismother. However, one day Ivan was travelingthrough a wood when he was stopped by adecrepit old crone who blamed him for notletting her die at her allotted time. Ivanimmediately remembered Death. He went tothe Briansk Woods; took the pouch withDeath inside, barely alive, down from the topof the tree; and carried it home with him.There he made his peace with his family,prayed for absolution from his sins, and thenlay down and let Death out of the bag, tellinghim that his time had come and he would beDeath’s first victim. Death looked down atIvan, laughed, and took to his heels, shoutingafter him that he would never come for Ivan,and Ivan could “go to hell.”Ivan reflected on his situation and decidedthat perhaps Death had the right idea. Sayinggoodbye to his family a second time, Ivan setout for Hell. At the gates of the infernalregions Ivan was stopped and asked what hispurpose was. When he told his story to thegatekeeper, Ivan was astonished to find thegates immediately closed and barred to him.The gatekeeper hurried away and returnedmoments later with the Devil himself. AgainIvan explained the purpose of his visit, butthe Devil would not permit him to enter.Ivan argued for some time, and then he real-ized that his situation was impossible.Turning to leave, Ivan took his pouchfrom his pocket, and when the Devil saw it,he quickly backed away. Ivan then realizedwhat it was that the Devil feared, and open-ing the pouch, he flourished it in the direc-tion of the Devil, saying that if the Devilwould not let him in, then maybe he shouldtake the Devil to Heaven.The Devil pleadedwith him, and after some time the twoagreed that Ivan should have two hundredfifty souls to take with him to Heaven—souls that were quickly turned over to Ivan,who left.As he approached the kingdom ofHeaven, he was seen by the angel at the gatesto the kingdom, who took the news of hisapproach to God. God told the angel to letthe two hundred fifty souls into Heaven butthen to close the gates and refuse Ivanentrance. However, after his run-in with theDevil, Ivan was prepared for some such ruse,so he let the souls out one by one, and whenthe last soul had been released from hispouch, he gave that soul the pouch and told134IVAN THE SOLDIER"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"him what to say once he had passed the gatesand entered Heaven.

Once again he promised half of hiskingdom to whichever of his sons couldbring the Firebird back for him. All three setout on the quest, although none knew wherethey should look.Ivan rode aimlessly for several days untilhe came to a crossroad that warned of deathfor anyone who took anything but the right-hand road, although this road would lead tothe death of the rider’s horse. Ivan took theright-hand road. After three days, he cameacross a huge gray wolf that tore his horse inhalf. Saddened by this loss, Ivan continued onfoot until he was almost exhausted.Just then the wolf that had attacked hishorse rushed up, apologized for havingkilled the horse, and offered to take Ivanwherever he wanted to go. Ivan explainedhis quest to the wolf, which immediatelysped off with Ivan on his back, much fasterthan any horse could have traveled. Soonthey came to a walled garden withinwhich—so the wolf informed Ivan—theFirebird was kept in a gilded cage. The wolfwarned Ivan to take only the Firebird andnot to touch the cage; but when Ivan sawthe beauty of the cage, he forgot the wolf ’sadvice and took it down from its place in atree. Immediately he was surrounded byguards, who hauled him off to confront theFirebird’s owner, Tsar Dalmat.The tsar was understandably furious, butgave Ivan a chance to redeem himself, tellinghim to ride to the kingdom of Tsar Afronand acquire for him the Horse with theGolden Mane. If Ivan achieved this, hewould be rewarded with the Firebird. If not,he would be branded a common thief.Outside the palace Ivan apologized to thewolf for ignoring his advice, and asked hishelp in acquiring the Horse with the GoldenMane. The wolf told Ivan to jump on hisback, and soon they were standing outsidethe stables of Tsar Afron.137IVAN VYSLAVOVICHA miniature on a black lacquer box depicts Ivan Vyslavovich and a princess being aided by a magical gray wolf.(Vakurov Isarevich/Sovfoto/Eastfoto/PNI)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The wolf told Ivan how he might bringthe horse out unchallenged but warned himnot to touch the horse’s golden bridle.

Elena the Beautiful’s servants were inhot pursuit, but the wolf easily outran them.By the time they reached the palace wallsof Tsar Afron, Ivan had fallen deeply in lovewith Elena the Beautiful, and vice versa.Now Ivan asked the wolf again for help, andthe wolf agreed. He would become theimage of Elena the Beautiful and would takeher place with Tsar Afron while the twolovers made their getaway. When they weresafely away, Ivan had only to think of thewolf, and the latter would return immedi-ately to his side.Tsar Afron was delighted when the falseElena the Beautiful was presented to him byIvan.

After traveling a shortdistance, Ivan thought of the wolf, whichimmediately appeared at their side.When the travelers arrived at the palace ofTsar Dalmat, Ivan once again asked the wolffor his help, for he had grown very attachedto the Horse with the Golden Mane. Onceagain the wolf transformed himself into thehorse and was left in its stead, while Ivan leftwith the Firebird in its gilded cage. A shortdistance down the road, he thought of thewolf, who was instantly by their side.Riding back toward Ivan’s home, theycame to the spot where the wolf had firstattacked Ivan, killing his horse. Telling Ivanand Elena the Beautiful that he could go nofarther, the wolf left them to continue theirjourney on the Horse with the GoldenMane. At the border of Ivan’s homeland theypassed Ivan’s brothers Dmitrii and Vasilii.Jealous of Ivan’s success, they ambushed himand killed him, dividing the booty by lot.Dmitrii won the Horse with the GoldenMane and Vasilii won Elena the Beautiful,whom the brothers swore to silence atsword’s point.For thirty days Ivan’s body lay where hehad been killed, until it was discovered bythe wolf. Thinking of a way in which hecould revive his young friend, the wolfcaught a young raven (some versions say itwas a crow) and threatened to tear it in half.The raven, or crow (named Voron Voro-nich), pleaded for mercy, to which the wolfreplied that he would spare the young birdif the bird’s mother would bring him someof the Water of Life and Death. The birdagreed and flew off. Three days later, shereturned with two little bottles of the Waterof Life and Death. To test the water, thewolf tore the mother bird in half and thensprinkled the water from one bottle overthe carcass. Immediately the bird flew upinto the sky, fully restored.

However, his masterdecided that he would give Kapsirko achance to redeem himself, and he assignedhim a seemingly impossible task. Kapsirkowas to steal his master’s horse from a heavilyguarded stable. He accomplished this task,but still his master was not satisfied; so themaster told Kapsirko to steal his wife awayfrom him.Kapsirko achieved this by enticing thelady out of the house and bundling her intohis waiting sleigh. He then made off with herdown to a lake near which a vodianoi, orwater demon, lived. The vodianoi askedKapsirko to sell the lady to him, whichKapsirko did for a capful of money.The pricehaving been negotiated, the vodianoi madeoff into the depths of the lake with the lady,telling his servant to fill Kapsirko’s cap withmoney. Being a cunning man, Kapsirko cut ahole in his cap and placed it on the sleighbefore the water sprite filled it. The capleaked its contents into the sleigh, which wassoon filled with coins.Kapsirko then returned home. With hisnewfound wealth, he no longer had to besubservient to his old master. However, aftera few weeks, his old master called him to hishome, for he was missing his wife andwanted Kapsirko to get her back for him.The master promised Kapsirko half his estateand a large amount of money if he succeed-ed.

Kapsirkoreplied that he was making a rope fromwhich he would make the demons of thelake swing after he had drained it of water.Quickly the sprite disappeared and re-peated Kapsirko’s threat to the vodianoi,the water demon—chief of the demons andsprites who lived in the lake. He came tothe surface and asked Kapsirko what he wasdoing. Again Kapsirko repeated his threat.The vodianoi asked what Kapsirko wantedof him.When Kapsirko said that he wanted hisold master’s wife back, the vodianoi refused.Kapsirko then suggested three contests, thewinner of all three to be awarded the lady.The vodianoi agreed. The first test was tostand together on the very edge of the lake,where each would whistle as loud as hecould in an attempt to make the other fallinto the water. The vodianoi went first, andKapsirko almost fell in. When it wasKapsirko’s turn, he whistled loud and long,but hit the vodianoi with a club so that thewater demon fell headlong into the water,unaware that Kapsirko had hit him.The second contest was to be a race, butKapsirko derided the vodianoi, saying that hehad a grandson who could easily beat thedemon. The vodianoi accepted that Kap-sirko’s grandson was a hare, and said that asKapsirko was so confident, maybe the hareshould run rather than Kapsirko himself.Kapsirko readily agreed, for earlier he hadtrapped two hares. As the race started,Kapsirko let loose the first hare, which easilyoutran the vodianoi. When the vodianoireturned, out of breath, Kapsirko presentedhim with the second hare, which was as freshas the morning dew.The final contest was to be a wrestlingmatch. Again Kapsirko tricked the vodianoi,saying that his grandfather, an old bear, couldeasily beat the demon. Again the vodianoiaccepted this, and he was, of course, severelybeaten as he attempted to wrestle the bear,which was displeased to have been awakenedfrom hibernation.In the end, the vodianoi submitted andreturned the lady to Kapsirko, who took herback to his old master, who kept his promise145KAPSIRKO"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"and gave Kapsirko half his estate and a largesum of money.See also:Siberia;Vodianoi (~nik)KARACHAROVORussiaThe village near Murom that was the birth-place of Il'ya Muromets.See also:Il'ya Muromets; MuromKARELIAGeneralKarelia is an autonomous republic in north-west Russia, between the Finnish border andthe White Sea.

Katrinathen proceeded alone into the city, disguisedas a man. A short time later, she presentedherself at the court of Prince Vladimir BrightSun as “Kalina,” ambassador of the King ofGreece, saying that she had traveled to Kievto exact tribute from Prince Vladimir BrightSun under threat of a terrible war.

AgainVladimir asked for time to think. Katrina saidhe could have twenty-four hours, andreturned to her camp.However, as she made her way back, shewas secretly watched by Zabava andEvpraksiya, Vladimir’s wife, who guessedthat the ambassador from Greece was awoman. Thus, when Vladimir came toZabava to tell her the news and to ask herto marry the ambassador to save them froma terrible war, Zabava and Evpraksiya toldVladimir about the ruse and sought toexpose the fraud by challenging the ambas-sador to “manly” contests.The following day, the ambassadorreturned to Kiev and asked Vladimir for hisreply.Vladimir stalled, asking for more time,whereupon the ambassador grew very angryand demanded that Zabava become his wifethere and then.Vladimir remained calm andsuggested that while the wedding prepara-tions were being made, they should sit awhile and play the gusli.Katrina knew whatwas coming, and said that it had been a longtime since “he” had played the gusli,butagreed to sit and play, as “his” own playerswere weary from the long journey fromGreece. The ambassador outplayed and out-sang all of the challengers in PrinceVladimir’s court.Vladimir was astounded. The ambassadorcould not possibly be a woman.Yet he decidedto continue to stall, and so he challenged theambassador to a game of chess. The ambas-sador replied that his own chess masters wereweary from the journey to Kiev but that hehad played chess as a child. Quickly Katrinaoutplayed every chess master Vladimir couldproduce, beating Vladimir himself in so fewmoves that the prince could not help butthink that he was playing the greatest chessmaster in all the world. Convinced that theambassador was a man, Vladimir continuedwith his plan and challenged the ambassadorto an archery contest. Again Katrina said thatthe archers in “his” camp were weary from thejourney but that “he” would be glad to try.Three times Vladimir shot an arrow at thetarget—composed of a ring and a knife—and on each occasion, he missed. Then theambassador took aim and let fly a singlearrow, which flew straight through the ringand split itself in two on the knife blade.Vladimir knew that he was beaten. Theambassador turned to Vladimir and told theprince either to produce the tributerequired by Kalina or to have PrincessZabava taken to the cathedral in readinessfor their marriage. With a heavy heartVladimir went to his niece and commandedher to prepare herself for her wedding to theambassador, and then he went back to wherethe ambassador waited to say that the bridewas on her way.The ambassador then issued a challenge ofhis own, saying that Vladimir and he shouldride out onto the steppes and test theirstrength together. Vladimir replied that itwould be a waste of time, as there was noman in all of Russia who could competewith the ambassador. The ambassadortaunted Vladimir, saying that if the princecould not produce a champion and wouldnot compete himself, then perhaps there wasone in the palace dungeons who wouldcompete.Vladimir remembered Stavr Godinovichand his idle boast, and immediately he toldhis guards to release him and arm him forcombat against the ambassador from Greece.Stavr soon rode out from Kiev, and hiddenby the dust thrown up by their horses, Stavrand his wife were reunited. The pair thenreturned to Kiev, where Katrina Ivanovnarevealed her true identity to Prince VladimirBright Sun.

Unlike their female counterparts, thevolkhvy(seers), who would only allow admit-tance of the opposite sex through blood lin-eage, the kolduny (or wizards) were openabout their practices and welcomed all whowished to participate. In a patriarchal society,the kolduny might have held far greater swaythan the volkhvy; but in ancient Russia, wherewomen were the principal bearers of traditionand protectors of the community, the oppositewas true. In later times, when wizardry waspracticed by groups of men and women com-bined, sorcerers began to be called znakhari.The kolduny, as the possessors of specialknowledge, were often consulted in cases ofcommunity dispute or disaster, when theyacted as mediators or as diviners of guilt.There is evidence that they might havefavored men over women: For example, aftera failed harvest in the regions of Rostov andSuzdal', in 1070, the women were blamed,with bloody results.See also:Shaman;Varangians; Znakhar'References:Tokarev 1957KOLIADARussiaWinter solstice ceremony that began on oraround 12 December.

At the same time, theold women of the community would sym-bolically feed the dead ancestors.The wintersolstice was seen as a time when the livingand dead communed in a period of “half-light” as the sun approached its death sur-rounded by the forces of darkness. It wasimportant to commune with dead ancestorsin order to dislodge the evil forces thatsought to kill the sun, ensuring both the sun’scontinuation and that of all life on earth.In the Volga region the Koliada wasknown as Ovsen' or Vinograd, but the cen-tral core of the ceremonies remained thesame. The name Koliadamight also havebeen derived from the Greek Kalanda,or theRomanized Calandæ.The ancients believedthat the rebirth of the sun goddess, whomthey also called Koliada, was ensured by driv-ing a young woman out of the village on asled, while singing hymns invoking the sun.The woman on the sled symbolically “died”in this ritual, which might once have calledfor actual human sacrifice.In some places, Koliada also has a mascu-line aspect (e.g., the festival once was con-nected with Saint Nikolai of Mozhaisk); butthe most common form of practice wasmatriarchal, even going so far as to personifythe festival as a childbearing goddess ofwealth—though wealth in this case meantchildren rather than material riches. Some-times both male and female aspects of thefestival were combined; but whatever thegender and whatever the mix, the main pur-pose of the ritual was identical—to ensurethe rebirth of the sun and of life on earth.See also:Nikolai of Mozhaisk, Saint; Ovsen';Sviatki;Vinograd;VolgaReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; de Beauplan1732; Potebnia 1865; Propp 1963; Shein 1900KORKA-MURTVotyakLiterally,“man of the house,” the spirit of thehearth that was central to any home.KORYAKSSiberiaAncient maritime Siberian people aboutwhom very little has been written and pub-lished.

The Koryaksbelieved that if they did not show the prop-er respect, their prey would disappear andthey would starve.KOSHCHEI (THE DEATHLESS)RussiaOne of the most unpleasant of all the char-acters found in the Russian legends. Thename Koshchei (in some variants,Kashchei)comes from kost'(bone). Koshchei could notbe killed because his soul was not inside hisbody but was hidden elsewhere. Though thelocation of the hiding place varies quitewidely from tale to tale, the soul itself wasusually hidden inside an egg.This egg was, inturn, inside a duck or other bird, which wasinside a rabbit. The three were then hiddenin some remote and inaccessible place, suchas beneath a large oak tree, on an island inthe middle of a huge ocean, or under a treeon that island.The egg is the symbol of life to many cul-tures, not just the Russian, as it is the femalecell from which life will spring. Birds’ eggs,so fragile and easily broken yet containingthe power to create a new life, were held inawe by ancient peoples and were usually pre-sented to new parents upon the birth of achild. The iconography of the egg continueseven today among many cultures, a particu-lar example being the giving of decorated154KORKA-MURT"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"eggs at Easter, representing the resurrectionof Jesus Christ.Koshchei the Deathless, who in somesources is described as a dragon and a maleaspect of Baba-Yaga, finally met with hisown death after he had kidnaped the beauti-ful Vasilissa Kirbit'evna. Bulat the Brave per-suaded Vasilissa to find out where her captorKoshchei kept his soul. After recovering theegg, Bulat returned to the forest home ofKoshchei, and breaking the egg on Kosh-chei’s forehead, killed him.An alternate version of the story ofKoshchei the Deathless has him living in amagnificent golden palace where he keepsan unnamed princess prisoner, a princesswhose lover continuously walks outsidethe walls of the palace, unable to find away in. The princess sought to killKoshchei but knew that he did not carryhis soul with him, so she made up to himand asked him where his soul was hidden.Koshchei first said that his soul was in abroom in the kitchen, but this was a lie, aswhen the princess threw the broom ontothe fire, Koshchei remained unharmed. Soshe tried again, and this time Koshchei toldher that his soul was in a worm that livedbeneath the largest of three oak trees in afield at the top of a high hill. The princesstold her lover the news, and he sought outthe field, cut down the largest of the threeoaks, dug up the roots, and crushed theworm. Koshchei the Deathless remainedunharmed.The princess then tried again, and thistime was told that the soul could be foundhidden in an egg. That egg was in a duckwhich was in a hare, both animals in turnbeing within a basket that itself was locked ina steel chest that lay beneath a great oak thatgrew all by itself on a small island far out atsea. The princess related the story to herlover, who set off, found the oak, retrievedthe egg, and came back to the palace, wherehe confronted Koshchei. Dismayed to see theegg in the young man’s hand, Koshcheireached for a sword, and as he did so theyoung man squeezed the egg, whereuponKoshchei let out a piercing scream.Then theyoung man crushed the egg, and Koshcheiinstantly died.There are many different versions of thisstory, but they all have a common theme inthat the soul of the warlock is hidden insome bizarre and inaccessible place.The egg,however, is not the only vessel in which thesoul is hidden. In one variant, whereKoshchei appears as a serpent (possibly adragon), the soul is contained within a peb-ble that could be found in the yolk of theegg, and death could only come to the ser-pent if that stone were smashed into his fore-head. Needless to say, no matter where thesoul is or what its vessel, Koshchei theDeathless always dies and the hero alwaysrescues the maiden.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Bulat theBrave; Dragon;Vasilis(s)a Kirbit'evnaReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Ivanov andToporov 1965KOSMARussiaVariant of Kuz'ma.KOSMATUSHKARussiaOne of the two names given to the magicalhorse of Il'ya Muromets, the other beingBorushka Matushka.See also:Borushka Matushka; Il'ya MurometsReferences:Astakhova 1938–51KOSTIA NIKITINRussiaOne of the druzhinaof Vasilii Buslayevich,Kostia stood guard over the stern of thepirates’ ship while they sailed the waters ofLake Il'men'.See also:Il'men', Lake;Vasilii BuslayevichKOSTIA NOVOTORZHENIRussiaThe first bogatyr' to take the tests set byVasilii Buslayevich and pass, and thus the first155KOSTIA NOVOTORZHENI"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"member of Vasilii’s druzhina,which eventu-ally included thirty men.See also:Bogatyr';Vasilii BuslayevichKOSTROMARussiaFertility goddess who in tenth-century art isrepresented as a diamond-headed column ina temple, surrounded by horses enclosed inlozenge shapes.

Generally, how-ever, a bonfire would be lit and a youngmaiden from the community chosen torepresent Kostroma. She would be borne,with great reverence, to a local watercoursewhere she was ritually bathed. They wouldthen return to the village to end the daywith feasting, dancing, and games.

Thus she went out into the forestand told all the animals about Mr. Kotsky, hisferocity, and his appetite, adding that all theanimals must help her hunt, otherwise Mr.Kotsky would be angry and would easilydeal with them.The following day, the animals of the for-est caught a huge ox and dragged it back tothe vixen’s lair. Mr. Kotsky hurried out andleaped onto the carcass, tearing at its skinand shouting that he needed more to eat. Ashe set about the dead ox, a wild boar washiding in a pile of leaves when it was bittenon the tail by a gnat. As the boar twitched,Mr. Kotsky saw the leaves move and, think-ing that they hid a mouse, leaped into themwith his claws extended. The boar was soterrified as Mr. Kotsky landed that heleaped out of the leaves, Mr. Kotsky beingequally surprised and leaping into a treewhere a huge bear was hiding. The bearthought Mr. Kotsky was about to attackhim, so he jumped down and ran off, meet-ing up with a huge wolf who was comingto see just what kind of animal Mr. Kotskywas. The boar and the bear told the wolfwhat had happened, and from that day forthall the animals of the forest lived in fear ofthe terrible Mr. Kotsky. All, that is, exceptfor the vixen, for she had seen the fright inMr. Kotsky’s eyes, and having coaxed himdown from the tree, she lived a life of lux-ury and ease as the other animals servedtheir every need.KRASNAIA GORARussia“Red Mountain,” a widespread springtimefestival that, according to some authorities,stems from the ancient Slavic custom ofburying the dead on hilltops or hillsides.Thefestival occurred at sunset, when youngwomen and young men would come to-gether and dance and sing about the comingof spring while holding bread and eggs.Often the ritual would be performed byyoung women alone who would dancearound a single girl standing in their midstand holding bread and an egg that had beendyed red. The bread represented the fertilityof the previous year; the egg symbolized thefertility of the earth waiting to be reborn;and the color red (krasnoe) signified the dailydeath and rebirth of the sun.References:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Snegirev1837–39KREMARASlavThe patron spirit of adult pigs and possiblythe brother of Kurwaichin in Poland, he isusually coupled with Priparchis, the patronof piglets in common Slavic belief.

The name comesfrom the Russian kreml',which means“fortress.” Many Russian cities have krem-lins, but the most famous—known simply asthe Kremlin—is the vast walled compoundin Moscow.Moscow’s Kremlin has a long history as theseat of government in Russia. Beginning inthe twelfth century, when Moscow was theadministrative center of only one of manyRussian states, its princes ruled from theKremlin. The Kremlin was the headquartersof tsarist rule from the mid-sixteenth centuryuntil 1712, when Peter the Great moved theRussian capital to St. Petersburg. Moscow andthe Kremlin again became the seat of govern-ment in 1918, shortly after the Bolshevikstook control of Russia, and remained the seatafter the Soviet Union was created in 1922.With the breakup of the Soviet Union in1991, the Kremlin became the seat of govern-ment of independent Russia.The Moscow Kremlin is a triangularenclosure with a circumference of nearly 1.5miles (2.4 kilometers). The first Kremlin onthe site was built in 1156. The presentKremlin walls have stood since the late fif-teenth century, when Moscow became themost powerful Russian city. At that time,architects from northern Italy and fromthroughout Russia were called to work onthe Kremlin. Italian architects built theCathedral of the Assumption (1475–1479),the Granovitaya Palace (1487–1491), the BellTower of Ivan the Great (1505–1508), andthe Cathedral of the Archangel Michael(1505–1509).The architects carefully blendedthe Italian Renaissance classical style withmore traditional Russian forms, such as thoseused in the Kremlin’s Cathedral of theAnnunciation (1484–1489).During the seventeenth century, the tow-ers and buildings of the Kremlin wereenlarged and redecorated.The major Kremlinbuildings of this period are the Terem Palace(1635–1636) and the Palace of the Patriarchs(1645–1655). In the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries construction continued, butthis time in the baroque and later neoclassicalstyles. Notable buildings from this periodinclude the Arsenal (1702–1736), the Men-shikov Tower (1705–1707), the Senate (1776–1787), and the Grand Kremlin Palace (1838–1849). Buildings added during the twentiethcentury include the Presidium (1932–1934)and the Palace of Congresses (1960–1961),the great hall of which currently houses gov-ernment meetings and performances of bal-lets and operas.See also:Ivan the Great; Moscow; St.PetersburgKRICCOSlavMinor fertility deity who protected the fruitsof the field.KRIMBASlavA goddess of the house who was principallyworshiped in Bohemia.See also:BohemiaKRUKISSlavThe patron spirit of blacksmiths, whoaccording to some sources, also watched overthe welfare of domestic animals along withPeseias.See also:PeseiasKUL'OstyakA water spirit who haunted large lakes andareas of deep water.

Young girls were central to thekumstvo, and would wear garlands wovenfrom birch twigs, the garlands representingthe fertility of the maidens, which theywould retain, unsullied, until they married.These girls would embrace, to signify thesolidarity of the village, and pledge theireternal blood ties.

This kinghad three sons, and one by one he sent themto find a cure for his affliction—a cure thatcould only be found where no horse hadever trod.The first son traveled to a tree thatmiraculously came to life overnight, bearinghuge apples—apples that he took back to hisfather, who was disappointed, for he hadalready been to that place and the applescould not provide his cure.The second son traveled past the tree andcame to a mountain, the top of which wasawash in precious stones. Convinced that noone had ever set foot on the mountain—forif they had, surely all the gems would havebeen carried away—the son filled a saddle-bag with them and returned to his father.Yethis father had visited that mountain manyyears before, and now, just as had happenedthen, the gems had turned to colored glass.Finally the youngest son was called uponby his father to seek out the cure. In a dreamthe young man was advised to set outequipped with his father’s ring and swordand riding his father’s horse.This he did; andwhereas it had taken his brothers manymonths to travel, it took him a matter ofhours. As night fell on the very first day, hav-ing already passed the apple tree and themountain of gems, the young man came tothe crest of a hill and saw two suns in the val-ley below him, one in the sky, and one on theground.Riding down into the valley, the youngprince discovered that the sun on the groundwas a magnificent golden feather, which hepicked up, and ignoring the warning of hishorse, tucked into his hatband.Then he rodeon, and before long he came to a city. He wasseen by the palace guard, who brought theking news of the approach of a rider with thesun on his head.As soon as the prince arrivedat the city he was led to see the king, whotook the feather from him, and without evena word of thanks, dismissed the young manand set the feather on his wall. From that dayforth the king had time only for the feather,all other affairs of the city having to be han-dled by his advisers.One day the king started to yearn formore than just the feather, and so he calledfor the young man who had found thefeather to be brought before him. There theyoung prince was told to go and fetch thewhole bird to whom the feather belonged.Failure would result in his execution bybeheading.The prince told his troubles to hishorse, and the next day the horse led him toa forest that had a white poplar tree growingin its midst. Under the tree, so his horseadvised him, was a white marble pool inwhich a Houri-Pari, a nymph from paradise,came to bathe. The horse told the youngman to wait until the maiden had bathed andhad donned her golden feathers again beforehe seized her by the legs.The prince did as he was instructed, andbefore long he was riding back to the citywith the Houri-Pari for the king. The kingtook the bird from the prince and summarilydismissed him, and then set the bird in agolden cage, and from that day forth spent160KURWAICHIN"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"every day and every night in the presence ofthe bird.Before long the Houri-Pari spoke to theking, saying that she would become the mostbeautiful maiden in all the world if the kingwould fetch for her her handmaiden, whowas being held prisoner by a red demonsomewhere between the Black Sea and theWhite Sea. (In this case the White Sea wasnot the Russian Beloe More.If not entirelyimaginary, the White Sea in Anatolia wouldhave been the Mediterranean Sea, which isAkdeniz,“White Sea,” in Turkish.) The kingagreed and once again sent for the haplessyoung prince, whom he commanded uponpain of death to bring back the handmaiden.The following morning the young princeallowed his horse to take him to the shores ofthe Black Sea. Once there, on the advice ofhis horse, the young man unsheathed hisfather’s sword and pointed it out across thewaters, which immediately divided, leavinghim a dry path across. After crossing the sea,the prince quickly came to the home of thered demon, whom he decapitated. He res-cued the handmaiden and then rode back tothe king. Once again the king did not thankthe young prince but simply took the hand-maiden and dismissed the young man.The king presented the Houri-Pari,whose name was Kush-Pari, with the hand-maiden and told her to cast off her feathersand become his wife. She refused, saying thatif she did, he would surely die. Yet if hewould bring her the forty fiery mares thatlived by the Red Sea, and if he bathed intheir milk, he too would become a Houri-Pari, and they could then be united.Once again the king sent for the unfortu-nate prince and sent him on this latest questunder threat of beheading. The prince wasonce again guided and helped by his horse,which turned out to be one of the forty fieryhorses (for although the stories spoke offorty mares, there were in fact only thirty-nine mares, and one stallion). At the edge ofthe Red Sea the stallion lay down, and beforelong his mother came to him. The princeleaped onto the back of the mare and rodeher until she quieted and followed his everycommand.Then the prince led the mare andher thirty-nine offspring to the city of theking.There, under the guidance of his horse,the prince hung the ring his father had givenhim into the middle of a vat, from a threadtied to his sword, which he laid over the topof the vat.Then he milked each of the thirty-nine mares into the vat.The prince then undressed, bathed in themilk, redressed, resheathed his sword, and puthis father’s ring on his finger. Having done sohe sent the message to the king that his bathof mares’ milk, which would transform himinto a Houri-Pari, was ready. The king hur-ried to the vat and stepped in, and wasimmediately boiled to a pulp. The youngprince then dressed himself as king and tookhis place.Kush-Pari knew what had happened andimmediately cast off her feathers and ran tothe side of the young man who now wasking; the couple was married before thenext day dawned. That morning, however,the young king remembered his father, andhe told his new wife the story of his origi-nal quest. She knew of the affliction, for sheherself had caused it when her husband’sfather had failed to take her captive.Together they rode back to the blind king,and there Kush-Pari cured his blindness, andshe and the young prince became the newrulers in his stead.The bird with golden plumage is encoun-tered among myths and legends of a greatmany peoples around the world, and ele-ments of the legend of the Kush-Pari arestrikingly similar to that of the Firebird.See also:Black Sea; Firebird,The; Houri-Pari;White SeaReferences:Orbeli and Taronian 1959–67,vol. 1KUZ'MA, SAINTRussiaRussian Orthodox saint who, according tosome legends, collaborated with Saint Dem'-161KUZ'MA, SAINT"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"yan in forging the first plow (other versionsof this legend name the two saintly smiths asSaints Boris and Gleb). Kuz'ma and Dem'-yan, however, had nothing at all to do withsmithing; they were doctors who had beenmartyred.Their connection with the legendssurrounding smiths stems simply from thefact that Kuz'ma sounds similar to theRussian word for a smithy,kuznya.As aresult, in the Russian Orthodox calendar ofsaints, they became the patrons of smiths andcraftsmen. Churches dedicated to them wereoften to be found in the part of a town inwhich smiths and craftsmen carried out theirbusiness.The plow reputedly forged by Kuz'maand Dem'yan was of enormous proportions,and was forged with implements of like size.The two smiths were reported to have usedtwelve golden hammers, and tongs thatweighed almost four hundredweight, ortwelve poods (a pood is an old Russian mea-sure roughly equivalent to 36 pounds or16.38 kilograms). One story, apparently ofUkrainian origin, tells how this plow wasfirst used.For some reason not told in the story, thepeople of southern Russia angered God sogreatly that he sent a fierce dragon to wreakhavoc throughout their land. Every day, in afutile attempt to appease the dragon, a differ-ent family was obliged to sacrifice a son.Finally it was the tsar’s turn to sacrifice hisson; and though many of his loyal subjectsoffered to send their son in the place of thetsarevich, the dragon would not agree to this.Reluctantly the tsar led his son to theappointed place, where he left him to awaithis fate. While the boy was waiting, an angelappeared to him and offered him a means ofescape. Teaching the tsarevich the Lord’sPrayer, the angel told the youth to run as fastas he could, all the time reciting the Lord’sPrayer.For three days and nights the boy ran asfast as his legs would carry him, continuallyreciting the prayer, for every time he stoppedhis recitation, he could feel the hot breath ofthe dragon on his neck. Finally, on the fourthday, almost totally exhausted, he came to thesmithy where the saints Kuz'ma and Dem'yanwere putting the finishing touches on thefirst plow that mankind would have. Thetsarevich ran straight into the smithy, and thetwo saints immediately slammed shut themassive iron doors in an effort to protect him.From outside, the dragon demanded thatthe two saints relinquish the boy to meet hisfate. The saints refused, so the dragon lickedthe iron doors, his tongue penetrating themon the fourth lick. However, as the dragon’stongue appeared through the doors, the twosaints caught hold of it with their red-hotpincers, and thus captive, they harnessed thedragon to the plow and made him plow adeep furrow, the great mounds of earth thathe threw up thereafter being known as“dragons’ ramparts.”Kuz'ma and Dem'yan, as the magicalsmiths of legend, were also believed capableof forging nonmaterial objects: Russians, intheir wedding songs, would ask Kuz'ma andDem'yan to forge them a wedding with linksso strong that they would last forever. In thisway Kuz'ma and Dem'yan came to beregarded as the patron saints of marriage.1 November was Koz'ma and Dem'yan Day(also known as Matushka Kozma-Demian),an important agricultural feast day.

Lado and Lada are commonly referredto in unison, in the songs sung by womenwhile planting grain or at wedding cere-monies. As a pair, the divine twins Lado andLada form one aspect of a quadruple fertilitydeity, the other aspects being Kupalo, who islinked with water; Kostromo-Kostrobunko,linked with grain; and Iarilo, linked with theSun. Each of these aspects also has a femininepersonification—Kupalo’s being Kupala,Kostromo-Kostrobunko’s Kostroma, andIarilo’s Iarila.Lada has been tentatively linked with aLatvian goddess, though it also has been sug-gested that she derived from the Finno-Slavic Mokosh, or the Great Goddess of thenorthern Letts and Mordvins. Other author-ities identify her with Loduna, the Scan-dinavian goddess of fire, the hearth, andherds. She may, however, have a moresoutherly origin in the classical Leto, themother by Zeus of Apollo and Artemis. Ladaand Lado are also connected with the twindeities Zizilia and Didilia worshiped by thePoles, who also venerate Lada and Lado—though in this instance she appears con-nected with the classical Leda, the mother ofthe twins Castor and Polydeuces. One sev-enteenth-century chronicler extenuates thisconnection by naming Lada as the mother ofLel and Polel, both of whom have beendirectly connected with Castor and Poly-deuces. Lada, here without Lado, is venerat-ed as the Great Goddess, the parthenogenet-ic mother of Dido, who is either her son orher consort (or perhaps simply Lado byanother name).An eighteenth-century text seems toconfirm that by that time, Lada hadassumed an ascendancy over Lado, whowas then seen as her son-consort,though here Lado is referred to asDido or Dida (although the lattername has a feminine ending, Dida isalmost always referred to as a male).See also:Dida; Didilia; Dido; Great Goddess;Iarila; Iarilo; Kostroma; Kostromo (-Kostrobunko); Kupala; Kupalo; Lado; Lel;Mokosh; Polel; ZiziliaReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Haase 1939;Snegirev 1837–39;Vernadsky 1959;Znayenko 1980LADOSlavThe male counterpart of Lada.LADOGA, LAKERussiaLake Ladoga in northwestern Russia is thelargest lake in all of Europe, covering 6,835square miles (17,703 square kilometers).Ladoga is situated 40 miles (64 kilometers)northeast of St. Petersburg.

Particularly active in the spring,having hibernated or taken a winter holidaywith his wife, the Leshachikha, and theirchildren, the leshii returned with wildshrieks to enjoy leading people astray in thethickest parts of his forest home. The leshiicould, however, be foiled by a traveler whoremoved all his clothes and put them onagain back to front, with shoes on the wrongfeet, thus imitating the leshii’s style of dress.Cowherds were even reported to have madepacts with leshiis to prevent their cattle fromstraying.One such story tells of a peasant who builthis smallholding in a remote and lonely partof the countryside.

Instead, all he had to do was tochase them out of the yard every morning,and every evening they would return wellfed and give a plentiful supply of milk.Everything went just as the traveler hadsaid for three years, until one day the peas-ant could no longer quell his curiosity andfollowed his cattle out of the yard. After awhile, they stopped and started to graze in alush meadow, where they were watched overby an old crone who leaned heavily on herstick as she dozed, rocking gently from sideto side. As the peasant spoke to her, thecrone became still and then disappeared.Perplexed, the man went home again; butfrom that day on the cattle once againneeded his attention, for the crone had beenthe leshii’s helper, and the curiosity of thepeasant had broken the spell that the travel-er, a leshii, had cast.The leshii’s favorite trick seems to havebeen the abduction of babies who had notbeen baptized or had been left unattended.Young children who entered the forest tofish or to gather nuts or berries were partic-ularly at risk from the antics of the leshii.In some regions there were whole tribesof leshiis. Every spring they would run amokthrough the woods, yelling and screechingwith the sheer pleasure of simply being alive.Every autumn, like the leaves on the treesamong which they lived, they would die.See also:LeshachikhaReferences:Ivanov and Toporov 1965;Pomerantseva 1975LETTSGeneralIndigenous inhabitants of Latvia, closelyrelated to their neighbors the Lithuanians.Their language is Baltic and resemblesLithuanian.See also:Latvia; LithuaniaLIAR, THEArmeniaA bored king once proclaimed that he wouldgive the man who could prove himself themost outrageous liar an apple made of gold.Many people came and lied to the king, buthe remained unimpressed.

When she turnedher attention to the blacksmith, he told herhis profession and said that he could forgeher any item she might require.

The smith took off hissheepskin coat, turned it inside out, andsafely crept past Likho; she thought he wassimply another of her flock.Once outside, the smith jeered at Likhoand then made his way off through the for-est. After a good distance the smith saw awondrous golden ax sticking out of a treestump. He felt strangely compelled to takehold of it; but when he did, he found that theax would not move. Worse than that, hishand had become fixed to the handle, and nomatter how hard he pulled he could not freehimself. Then the smith heard Likho hurry-ing through the forest toward her ax, andwithout a moment’s hesitation the smithtook a sharp knife from his pocket, cut off hishand, and ran for home as fast as his legscould carry him.The moral of this post-Christian tale isclear: Although it is relatively easy to findevil, it is much harder to escape evil’sclutches; and it is better not to meddle withwhat one does not understand.See also:EvilLION’S SHARE, THEArmeniaA lion, a wolf, and a fox once formed a teamto hunt.

Somebelieve they arrived around 2500 B.C.; oth-ers, that they migrated to the area sometimearound the beginning of the first centuryA.D. The first reference to the people byname, however, comes much later—in 1009,in a medieval Prussian manuscript known asthe Quedlinburg Chronicle.With the rise of the medieval lords in adja-cent Prussia and Russia, Lithuania acted as abuffer between Germany to the west and theMongols and Tatars to the east, constantlybeing subjected to invasion and attemptedconquest over a number of centuries. As aresult, a loose confederation of Lithuaniantribes was formed in the early Middle Agesand subsequently became the Kingdom ofLithuania in 1251. In the thirteenth centuryA.D., when the Teutonic Knights, a Germanmilitaristic religious order, were establishingtheir power, the Lithuanians resisted, and c.1260 they defeated the order.About a centurylater a dynasty of grand dukes called theJagiellons established, through conquest, aLithuanian empire that reached from the168LION’S SHARE, THE"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Baltic to the Black Sea.The Lithuanian PrinceGedimin occupied Belorussia and westernUkraine, and his son Grand Duke Olgierdadded the territory between Ukraine and theBlack Sea.

Witoldmade the grand duchy into a prestigious state,and in 1401 Jagiello made him a duke.Together the reconciled cousins decisivelydefeated the Teutonic Knights in 1410. In1447, under Jagiello’s son Casimir IV,Lithuania and Poland formed an alliance.With the accession of Casimir’s son Alex-ander I in 1501, the countries had a single,common ruler, and in 1569 they agreed to acommon legislature and an elective king.Although the political union of Poland andLithuania was induced by the threat ofRussian conquest, it actually provided littleprotection. Poland was partitioned in 1772,1793, and 1795, and Lithuania became a partof Russia, except for a small section that wasawarded to Prussia. Unhappy with tsarist rule,Lithuanians staged large-scale nationalistinsurrections in 1812, 1831, 1863, and 1905.During World War I the German armyoccupied Lithuania, but at the end of the warnationalists established the country’s indepen-dence. Lithuania’s independence was recog-nized by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, andin August 1922 the Lithuanian constituentassembly, which had been in session sinceMay 1920, approved a constitution that pro-claimed the country a democratic republic.With the outbreak of World War II andthe partition of Poland by Germany and theUSSR, the Lithuanian and Soviet govern-ments concluded a mutual-assistance treatyin October 1939. A pro-Soviet governmentassumed power in Lithuania the followingJune and shortly afterward began a campaignfor Lithuania’s inclusion in the USSR. InJuly 1940 the new parliament unanimouslyapproved a resolution requesting incorpora-tion of Lithuania in the USSR.

Inthe stables the “boy” told Lulizar of his mis-sion; but all Lulizar would say was that therewas nothing to worry about, for with her tohelp, they would accomplish the quest withease. Thus they rode out from the palace,found Lulizar’s brother, captured him, andbrought him back to the palace, where theypresented him to the king.

The chamberlain suggested that the“boy” should be sent to the house of thedemons, to collect the seven years’ back taxesthey owed.The king summoned his “son-in-law” anddispatched him again on a mission fromwhich there was sure to be no return.

They then rode back tothe palace and gave the king the money hewas owed. Again the king consulted hischamberlain, and this time it was suggestedthat the “boy” should reclaim the rosary ofthe king’s grandfather that had fallen into thehands of a terrible she-devil.The king sent his “son-in-law,” again rid-ing Lulizar, to the castle of the demoness.There Lulizar told her that she should catchthe rosary before it fell into the she-devil’shand and then leap into the ravine that ranpast the castle, and Lulizar would catch heron her back. The “boy” did as instructed;but the noise of her escape woke the she-devil, who saw the fleeing figure of Lulizarand her rider. The she-devil knew that shecould never catch Lulizar, so instead sheshouted a curse after them, saying that if therider be a man, then he should become awoman, and if the rider be a woman, thenshe should become a man. Thus whenLulizar returned to the palace, all was well,for the princess found that her husband wasnow indeed a young man; and she imploredher father to stop sending him on perilousmissions.Thus the princess and her husband werereconciled, and the king gave them domin-ion of their own, and Lulizar lived in theirstables and advised them whenever the needarose.References:Orbeli and Taronian 1959–67,vol. 1LUQMÂN THE WISEArmeniaVariant of Loqmân the Wise.LUSAGHENArmenia“Radiant,” a water sprite, the daughter of theKing of the Waters.

A number of different peoplessettled in the region over the next severalthousand years. The people living thereeventually came to be known as Mace-dones, and the region as Macedonia. Thename Macedones comes from the Greekword makednon,meaning “high”—a refer-ence to the group’s mountainous home-land.The earliest known rulers of theMacedonians were members of the Argeaddynasty, founded by King Perdiccas I about650 B.C. During the sixth and fifth cen-turies B.C., the Argeads expanded Mace-donian rule into nearby regions. KingPhilip II continued this expansion, and by338 B.C., he controlled all of Greece.

She is known in Russia as Vasilissa theWise and appears in a story that is basicallythe same as that of Vasilissa, though the wayher husband reclaims her is markedly dif-ferent.An unnamed tsar had three sons who allcame of age and asked their father, as was thecustom, for his permission to seek wives. Heagreed, saying that the sons should each firea single arrow, and where that arrow landedthey should seek their wife. The eldest sonwent first. His arrow fell into the courtyardof a neighboring ruler. The ruler’s daughterpicked up the arrow and agreed to the youngprince’s proposal.The second son went next. His arrow fellinto the courtyard of a rich merchant, wherethat merchant’s daughter found it and pickedit up. Thus the second prince becamebetrothed. The youngest son, whose namewas Ivan the Young, went next. His arrowflew through the clouds, so no one sawwhere it landed, and Ivan had to set out tolook for it. For three days Ivan looked for hisarrow without any success. He was about tohead for home when he passed through aswamp, and there, sitting on a lily pad, he sawa large green frog holding his arrow.The frogspoke to Ivan saying that she would returnthe arrow only if he agreed to marry her.Ivan was horrified and hurried back to hisfather, who told him that although his arrowhad been retrieved by a frog, Ivan washonor-bound to marry her.All three brothers were married at thesame service followed by a banquet at whichthe beauty of the two human wives waspraised and the frog princess was made thebutt of many cruel jokes. Ivan the Young andhis new bride left the banquet early to thesounds of hilarity and hurried to their newhome.Some time later the tsar decided to put histhree daughters-in-law through a series oftests to discover which was the best.The firsttest was to embroider a rushnik(a towel—pl.rushniki). The two human wives set to workwith needle and thread, while the frogprincess told Ivan to sleep soundly and notworry about the fact that his wife was a frog.The following morning Ivan awoke to seethe rushnikhis wife had embroidered withthe help of the animals of the forest, andknew that she was no ordinary frog. Therushnikwas the finest anyone had ever seen,and Ivan’s wife was easily adjudged the bestseamstress of the three wives.The tsar then decided to see which of histhree daughters-in-law was the best baker.He told his three sons to tell their wives tobake him a loaf of bread. Convinced that thewife of Ivan the Young had had magical assis-tance in completing the first test, the twohuman wives watched through the kitchenwindow this time. They saw the frog openthe door and step outside to call the animalsof the forest to her assistance. However, as shestepped outside, the frog princess caught thearoma of the two women’s perfume; and soshe mixed flour, water, and soot together andplaced the mixture in the oven. Certain thatthey had her secret, the two human wiveswent home and copied what they had seen.Meanwhile the frog princess had thrownaway the foul mixture and with the help ofher forest friends, had produced the mostexquisite loaf of bread any had ever seen.Thus, while the two human wives werecleaning out their ovens and starting over179MARIA"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"again, Ivan was presenting the loaf to hisfather, who again judged in favor of Ivan’sunusual wife. When the two human bridesproduced their best results, the tsar imme-diately sent the bread to his swineherd tobe fed to the pigs, but even they would noteat it.Finally the tsar decreed that he must findout which of his daughters-in-law was thebest dancer, and he announced that a ban-quet and grand ball would be held in sevendays. Now the two human wives felt certainthat they would get the better of Ivan’s wife,as they saw no way on earth that a frog coulddo more than hop, let alone dance. However,Ivan’s wife told him that on the night of theball, he was to go alone and tell his fatherthat his wife would arrive late.Then, she toldhim, they would hear three loud claps ofthunder. On the third he was to leave the balland escort her inside. Ivan did as he wasinstructed, and after enduring almost twohours of cruel jokes, he left the hall on hear-ing the third clap of thunder.Outside he stopped dead in his tracks. Atthe foot of the steps sat a magnificent car-riage from which the most beautiful womanwas stepping down. He hurried down thesteps to her. She told him that she was hiswife, the Princess Maria, the daughter of theSea King. As Ivan the Young led her into thehall and introduced her to his father, all eyesfell on Maria, and the hearts of all the menpresent ached with jealousy.Ivan, however, knew that his wife hadtaken off her frog skin. Making some excuse,he hurried home, found the skin, and burnedit, because he thought that if the skin weregone when his wife returned, she would notbe able to become a frog again and wouldalways be beautiful. However, when Mariareturned from the ball and found her frogskin burned, she told Ivan that she had beenplaced under a spell by her father, and if Ivanhad waited only a little while longer, the spellwould have been broken. Now he wouldhave her only until daybreak; and if he everwanted to find her again he would have totravel to the Thrice-Ten Kingdom and enlistthe help of Baba-Yaga, her aunt.As the sun rose, a dark cloud gatheredaround the home of Ivan and Maria. Mariawas suddenly transformed into a cuckoo andflew away. Ivan the Young pined for his beau-tiful wife, unable to either eat or sleep. Atlength he decided to go in search of hisbeloved. After almost a year’s travel, Ivancame to the Thrice-Ten Kingdom and theforest in which Baba-Yaga lived. Fighting hisway through the thick undergrowth, Ivancame to a clearing as the sun began to set;and there, on four chicken’s legs, stood Baba-Yaga’s little house. Entering the house, hefound the witch asleep on her stove, wokeher, and told her the purpose of his visit.Maria had already told her to expect him,and she had slept a whole year on the stovefor fear of missing him. Ivan stayed the nightwith Baba-Yaga, and in the morning shegave him a ball of thread with instructions tofollow it wherever it went and to stopwhenever it stopped. Ivan thanked Baba-Yaga and set off in pursuit of the ball ofthread. At length the thread came to restbeside the sea. Ivan settled down to rest in athicket and soon fell asleep. A bit later hewas awakened by the rustling of feathers.Sitting up, he saw thirty swans land on thebeach, discard their feathers, and start tobathe in the sea. Ivan saw that his wife wasamong them, and when their backs wereturned, he hurried out of his hiding placeand hid Maria’s feathers.When the maidens had finished bathing,they changed back into their feathers andflew away, leaving only Maria standing onthe beach. Ivan made himself known to hiswife, who embraced him and told him thathe must come to the undersea kingdom ofher father that night, and when the Sea Kingasked him what he wanted, he should saythat he simply wanted to see what the bot-tom of the ocean looked like.Thus, as the sun sank below the horizon,Ivan the Young walked into the sea and con-tinued walking until he came to the palace of180MARIA"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"the Sea King. There, when the Sea Kingasked Ivan what he wanted, Ivan replied ashe had been instructed, and the Sea Kinginvited Ivan to stay. In his room in the palace,Ivan was visited by Maria, who told him thatthe next morning her father would offerIvan the choice of thirty black fillies, each ofwhich would be identical, and she would bethe one that tapped one hoof.The following morning the Sea King ledIvan into a paddock in which thirty black fil-lies were lined up.The Sea King told Ivan tochoose one as a gift. Ivan walked around thefillies, but not one of them moved. Hewalked around them a second time, andagain they all remained motionless. Ivanwalked around them a third time, and thistime he noticed an almost imperceptiblemovement of a hoof, and he immediatelyindicated his choice.That night Maria came back to Ivan andtold him that her father would again giveIvan a choice, this time of thirty white doves,twenty-nine of which would be her sistersand the thirtieth herself. All would lookidentical, but she would be the one thatturned its head to the left.Just as she had said, the Sea King led Ivanthe Young to a dovecote and gave the princethe choice of thirty beautiful birds. Ivanwalked around the dovecote once, but notone bird stirred. He walked around a secondtime, and they all remained motionless. Ivanthen walked around the dovecote a thirdtime, and this time one bird moved its beaka fraction to the left, and Ivan immediatelymade his selection.Yet again Maria visited Ivan in the mid-dle of the night and told her husband thatthe Sea King would give him the choice ofthirty maidens, each the image of herself,and that she would be the one upon whicha fly alighted.Thus it was that Ivan was givenhis choice the following morning, and thethird time he walked around the thirty iden-tical maidens, he saw the small fly andimmediately chose the real Maria, claimingher as his wife.As Ivan the Young spoke, the Sea Kingscowled and grew angry, banging his fists onhis throne. As his anger grew, the seas beganto boil. Maria took Ivan by the hand, and thepair fled along the seabed and upward untilthey fell exhausted on the beach. Behindthem the storm raged, but they had escapedthe fury of the Sea King and were free toreturn to their home in Ivan’s kingdom.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Ivan theYoung; Sea King; Sea Tsar;Thrice-TenKingdom,The;Vasilis(s)a the WiseMARIA MORENARussiaThe bride of an unnamed youth.

A man of enormousstrength (the mace he wielded in battleweighed more than 180 pounds) and cun-ning, Marko had an inexhaustible capacityfor alcohol. He was chivalrous, fearless, andpassionate, though he was also capable of themost ruthless brutality, even to women.Marko was in league with the supernaturalmountain nymphs, the vile,and owned ahorse named Sarac that was the fastest in theworld and had the power of speech. Sarac,like his master, had a considerable liking foralcohol and Marko often shared his winewith the horse.Marko is traditionally depicted as a verylarge man, with very dark, almost black eyesand a black mustache as large as a six-month-old lamb. He wears a kalpak,a furhat, and a cloak made of wolf-skins. Hisspear is slung across his back, and a dama-scened sword hangs from his belt. FromSarac’s saddle hangs Marko’s huge mace anda large wineskin.In poetry and popular tradition Markowas identified with the resistance against theinvading Turks. He was the exemplar ofheroic valor and the embodiment of thespirit of true independence. In historical factMarko became, like many other Serbs, a vas-sal of the Turkish invaders, fighting for theSultan against the Christians at the Battle ofRovine in Romania in 1394. Popular legendsays that before that battle he prayed to Godto give the Christians the victory, even if thatmeant he would lose his life.Legend tells of his death in this manner.One morning he was riding Sarac along aroad when the normally surefooted horsestumbled and wept, omens that Markoimmediately recognized as evil. Instantly avila appeared and told him that because nonecould kill Marko and none should own Saracbut Marko, the time had come for bothhorse and rider to die.Marko recognized this as a message fromGod. He had attained the age of 300, andSarac was 160; they accepted that their timehad come. Marko killed Sarac and gave histrusted friend an elaborate burial. He thenbroke his sword and spear and threw hismace over the mountains and far out to seabefore lying down to die.A continuation of this legend says that apriest found his body and took it to MountAthos for burial. A more popular belief saysthat Marko never died but instead, like KingArthur, sleeps in a cave in the mountains, torise again in a time of great need. OneBulgar variant embroiders this idea, sayingthat Marko sleeps in the cave with his beardwound several times around him.See also:Arthur, King; Athos, Mount;Romania; Sarac;VilaMARTHA (~FA)RussiaThe sister of Mary in the biblical story.MARTIROSArmeniaA young merchant from Yerevan who hadpromised his father as the old man lay dyingthat he would never trade in Aleppo.However, finding that he could not get a fairprice for his wares and hearing that the peo-ple of Aleppo paid exorbitant prices, espe-182MARKO, PRINCE"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"cially for boxwood, he asked for his mother’sblessings, bought forty bales of boxwood, andset off toward Aleppo. Late in the eveningand still some distance from Aleppo, Martirosstopped at a tavern for the night.After the merchant went to sleep, a thiefstole one of the bales of boxwood, piled halfof it in the fireplace, and liberally spread therest around the tavern. When the merchantcame down to eat, the thief asked the mer-chant what he was traveling to Aleppo to sell.When Martiros said that it was boxwood, thethief pointed to the wood lying all aroundthem and offered Martiros seven pots of goldfor the wood, which was so common therethat the people used it as firewood.Martiros was not to be put off, realizingthat if he sold the boxwood without actuallytraveling to Aleppo, he would not be able totell his mother what he had seen there.ThusMartiros entered the city the following dayand was told that boxwood was so scarcethere that it could bring a king’s ransom.Hearing this, Martiros told an old shop-keeper what had happened to him at the inn.The shopkeeper advised him to ask the cookat the inn for help. Martiros did this and wastold to listen at his wall that night, for theroom next to his was occupied by threethieves.Martiros did as he was advised and learnedthat he could only get out of his predicamentif he demanded a really unusual payment forthe boxwood. The following morning themerchant offered to sell his bales of boxwoodfor seven pots of fleas—a price that thethieves had no ability to pay. Thus theydecided to deceive Martiros a different way,so they hired a man to learn all he couldabout the young merchant. When the one-eyed thief met Martiros as he walkedthrough the streets of Aleppo, he was able toinquire after Martiros’s mother and neigh-bors, and to speak of many other subjectsthat only Martiros himself could possiblyhave known.When Martiros asked the thief how hecame to know these things, the thief toldMartiros that he had once lived with theyoung merchant and his family, and thatwhen Martiros had lost an eye, he had gladlygiven him one of his. Now that he was oldhe needed it back. Martiros was astonished.Thinking quickly, he suggested that they goto the local magistrate the following morn-ing and have him decide.That night Martirosagain listened at his wall, and when they sawthe magistrate the next day he told the offi-cial that he would give up his eye if itweighed the same as the one-eyed thief ’sother eye.The thief fled from the court, realizingthat the only way this could be accomplishedwas if they took out his one good eye. Hereturned to his two thieving friends, andwhen they heard what had happened, theyall fled the area. Martiros took his boxwoodinto Aleppo and sold it for a large amount ofgold before returning home to live a life ofluxury.See also:AleppoReferences:Khatchatrian 1933MARUSYAUkraineMarusya and her young brother Vasilko livedfar out on the steppes with their trapperfather and mother.

Stillthe house remained hot and sultry, and itwasn’t long before Vasilko was asking his sis-ter whether they could sit outside, saying thatif they heard the geese coming they couldeasily hurry back inside. Marusya agreed, andthe two sat down in the hot sunshine. Before183MARUSYA"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"long Vasilko asked Marusya if she wouldfetch a pitcher of water. Marusya agreed andwent into the house. While she was fillingthe pitcher, she heard the honking of geeseand Vasilko’s scream.Marusya ran out of the house and saw thegeese flying away with her little brother.Carefully locking the door behind her,Marusya set off after the geese. Although shesoon lost sight of the geese, Marusya contin-ued in the direction she had last seen themflying, and after some time she came to ariver of honey with banks made of kisel'(apudding of puréed fruit thickened withcornstarch). Marusya asked the river if it hadseen the geese. The river replied that it hadbut it would not tell Marusya the directionin which they had flown until she had drunksome of its honey and eaten her fill of thekisel'.Marusya did this, and then tidied upthe riverbanks.The river then told the younggirl the direction the geese had taken, andMarusya hurried off after she had thankedthe river for its assistance.At length Marusya came to a forest, butshe did not know where to look. In the mid-dle of the forest stood an ancient apple treeladen with sour, green apples, its branchescrawling with hundreds of caterpillars.Marusya asked the tree if it had seen thegeese and her brother Vasilko, which it had.Yet when Marusya asked the tree to tell herwhere they had gone, the tree refused, sayingthat Marusya must first taste its sour apples.Marusya ate several of the apples until hereyes streamed and her toes began to curl, andthen she cleared all the caterpillars from thetree and swept up all the fallen leaves. Thetree then told Marusya which path to follow.Thanking it, Marusya hurried after herbrother.The path took her far out onto the steppe,toward a range of mountains in the far dis-tance. As she began to wonder if she wasindeed following the right path, she came toan old stove beside the path—a stove thatwas filthy, covered in rubbish, and full ofhard, cold buckwheat biscuits. Marusya askedthe stove if it knew which way the geese hadflown with her brother, and when the stovereplied that it did, Marusya ate some of thecold, hard buckwheat biscuits and thencleaned the stove and cleared away all therubbish.The stove then pointed out the par-ticular mountain where the geese had theirnest and told Marusya to hide in the bushesuntil all the geese were fast asleep, and thenmake away with her brother as fast as shecould.Marusya thanked the stove and ran to themountain and hid and waited until she wasquite certain that all the geese had fallenasleep. She then crept into their nests andfound Vasilko, and the pair made away asquickly as they could. When day broke, thegeese discovered that Vasilko was gone, andthey set off in hot pursuit. As Marusya andVasilko heard the geese honking behindthem, they came to the stove, which toldthem to climb into its oven. This they did.They sat quite still inside while the stovepointed the geese in the wrong direction.When the geese had flown away, Marusyaand Vasilko climbed out of the oven, thankedthe stove, and hurried off toward the forest.As they reached the apple tree in the cen-ter of the forest, they again heard the honk-ing of the geese, which had realized theywere headed the wrong way. The apple treetold the two children to stand close to itstrunk. Then it shook its branches and cov-ered them in a pile of leaves.When the geesearrived, the tree pointed them in the direc-tion opposite to the one that Marusya andVasilko would be taking.When the geese hadleft, the two children shook off the leaves,thanked the tree, and hurried toward theriver.Just as they reached the banks of thehoney river, Marusya and Vasilko heard thegeese approaching. The river told them tojump in, and then it covered them with kisel'so that they were well hidden when thegeese arrived.The river sent the geese in thewrong direction, and Marusya and Vasilkoclimbed out, thanked the river, and made it184MARUSYA"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"home just as the geese were swooping downon them.They managed to close the woodendoor in the nick of time, and the geese thud-ded into it.That evening their parents came home,chased away the geese that were circling thehouse, and listened to the story their childrentold them.The following morning the familyawoke to three carts coming toward thehouse, the first laden with wonderfully sweetbiscuits; the second with delicious, ripe, redapples; and the third with two huge pots, onefull of honey and the other full of kisel'.Formany weeks the family feasted on thosefoods, and no one was ever again troubled bythe geese.See also:VasilkoReferences:Oparenko 1996MARY (~IIA)RussiaSister of Martha.The two women, both wid-ows, met each day on the road betweenByzantium and Murom.

A celebration of theearth’s awakening, Maslenitsa involved themaking of a straw doll, or the dressing of ayoung woman to play the role of the doll,and the decorating of a tree. Following a feastof traditional foods, the ceremonies wouldculminate with newly married couples sled-ding down artificially constructed slopes.Those who slid the farthest would be assuredthe best crops in the coming year. The spin-ners in the community also sledded downthe hills, and the one that slid the farthestwould be assured the best crop of flax for herspinning.Maslenitsaalso was the name given to thegoddess of spring, whom the festival wel-comed at her return from winter exile. Thefeast was seen as feeding the goddess, and thesledding was a means of securing the plea-sure of the goddess, who would then ensurethe fertility of the ground and a good crop.Having been serenaded and fed, the strawdoll would be taken out into the fields,where it would be torn apart. Food wouldspill from the doll, which would then beburned. The ashes would be scattered overthe fields to further the influence of the god-dess.This tearing apart of the doll and burn-ing of its remains has been seen as a way ofscaring away winter with the warmth ofspring—the fate of the doll perhaps demon-strating what the village people would do towinter if he stayed too long.References:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Propp 1963;Tereshchenko 1848;Vsevolodskii-Gerngross1929; Zemtsovskii 1970MATERGABIASlavFemale spirit who directed the housekeepingand who was always offered the first piece ofbread from the kneading trough.

The contemporary of Vardan ofAygek, he collected and wrote a great num-ber of Armenian fables before his death in1213, several of which are described in thisbook. Like Vardan, Mekhithar often incorpo-rated contemporary historical figures, such asAlexander the Great, into his fables.The fablein which Alexander the Great is mentionedwent as follows:Having had a new palace built for himself,Alexander the Great rewarded the blacksmithfar more generously than the carpenter andthe gardener. Envious of the smith, the car-penter and the gardener complained to theemperor that they had both done far morework on the palace than the blacksmith.Alexander the Great consulted his advisers,who told him that before the carpenter coulddo his work he needed the tools of the black-smith, and before the gardener could do hiswork he needed the skills of both the car-penter and the blacksmith. Thus the black-smith deserved the greatest reward. The car-penter and the gardener readily accepted thisreasoning and were no longer jealous.See also:Alexander the Great;VardanMENESS (~ULIS)LatviaThe moon god, the Latvian equivalent of theLithuanian Menuo.

TheMordvins number about one million and aredivided into two groups with differentdialects—a northern branch called the Erzya,and a southern branch known as theMoksha. Their chief occupation is agricul-ture, but carpentry, the manufacture ofwooden vessels, and beekeeping are alsoimportant to their economy. Many of thewomen wear a distinctive traditional cos-tume of profusely embroidered jackets andskirts, elaborate coiffures, large earrings, andnumerous necklaces.Although Christianity iscommon, ancient forms of nature worshipare still practiced.

As he walked through the forest, hefelt Frost attacking him, so he broke into arun. Soon he was warm and thanked Frostfor making him move more quickly to keephimself warm. Angered by this, Frost sworethat he would make the man suffer horribly;so when the peasant removed his hat andgloves in order to chop wood, Frost frozethem solid. Returning to his garments, theman saw that they were frozen, so he beganto pound them with the blunt edge of hisaxe.

During the fourteenthcentury, under the rule of Alexander Nevski,Ivan I, and Dmitri Donskoi, the city becamethe foremost political and religious center inRussia. The city was burned in 1571 by thekhan of the Crimea and ravaged again by firein 1739, 1748, 1753, and 1812. In the lastinstance the fire might have been deliber-ately set in an attempt to stop Napoleon’stroops from taking the city.

One week afterhis birth the child, who had been born as asnake, became a dragon, and had to belocked away in a special chamber for fear ofwhat he might do if allowed to roam free.Odz-Manouk was offered all the finest foodsin the kingdom, but he did not touch any ofit, and before long his roars of hunger threat-ened to shake the very palace apart.Then, bychance, the daughter of the king’s chamber-lain went to see Odz-Manouk, whosnatched her up and quickly ate her.From that day forth, Odz-Manouk had tobe fed with maidens at the rate of one a day.Every morning the palace guards would goout into the countryside and drag backan unsuspecting maiden whowould be lowered to her deaththrough a hole in the roof ofOdz-Manouk’s chamber.

His astonishment turned to bewil-derment when he saw that Odz-Manoukwas no longer a dragon but had been trans-formed into a handsome prince. This trans-formation came about because Arevhat hadspoken kindly to him and had not beenfrightened by his appearance.

Octavian, who later became theRoman emperor Augustus, invaded Pan-nonia in 35 B.C. but was unable to subduethe country until 9 B.C., when he made it apart of Illyricum, a colony established by theRomans in 168 B.C. The Pannonians movedto the north of the region after an insurrec-tion in A.D. 6 was suppressed, and in A.D.10this area became the separate Romanprovince of Pannonia. In the early secondcentury the Roman emperor Trajan dividedthe province into Upper Pannonia andLower Pannonia, but by the end of thefourth century the region was abandoned byRome. Subsequently Pannonia was held suc-cessively by the Huns, Ostrogoths, Lom-bards, Avars, and Slavs. The Magyars tookpossession of most of the area at the end ofthe eleventh century.See also:Avars; Croatia; Danube; Hungary;Magyars; SloveniaPANTALOVNA, QUEENRussiaAt one time held captive by a sultan ofTurkey, Queen Pantalovna was releasedwhen Vol'ga Buslavlevich gathered togetherhis bogatyri and marched into Turkey.Volgaand his bogatyri killed the sultan and hismen, released Queen Pantalovna, andthen divided the rich spoils equallyamong themselves.See also:Bogatyr';Vol'ga BuslavlevichPARAKHARussiaThe eldest of the two stepsisters ofMarfusha, and the only one of the two tobe named.

One ofthe few truly Russian saints, Paraskeva is ofpagan origin. She was usually referred to inher dual identity as Paraskeva-Piatnitsa, or“Saint Friday.” The epithet of “Friday”applied to this most popular Russian saintappears to have come from the translation ofthe Greek word paraskeva,meaning the daybefore the Sabbath, or Friday. Friday wassacred to the goddess Zhiva, and it wouldseem that the connection being sought byChristian missionaries was again one ofassimilation by association.Celebration of Saint Paraskeva, however,remained pagan, being condemned in 1589by the patriarch of Constantinople. TwelveFridays throughout the year were believedsacred to Paraskeva, and on these days, menand women, both young and old, wouldstrip naked and jump and shake, saying thatthey had seen Saints Paraskeva and Anastasiaand had been ordered to honor them withtheir lascivious dances.The Stoglav Council,set up during the latter half of the sixteenthcentury by Ivan Groznyi, also condemnedthe festivals, calling them orgies. However,P"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"the cult continued, especially in Ukraine,where Friday was considered the Sabbathover Sunday until well into the eighteenthcentury.The Stoglav Council issued a decree,known unsurprisingly as the Stoglav docu-ment, denouncing Saint Paraskeva as thegoddess of fate connected with two othersaints with pagan roots—Saints Sreda andNedelia. All three were seen as the triuneFates, spinners who wove the course ofmankind’s life, and as mistresses of the cosmicorder. This, of course, the Christian churchcould not accept, as it would place the threesaints on the same plane as God.Paraskeva was represented in folklore andicons as a tall, thin woman with long, flow-ing hair, the hair being an uncharacteristictrait in a country where long hair was usu-ally plaited. She was surrounded by hertwelve “apostles”—another aspect of hercult that brought it into direct conflict withthe Stoglav Council. The members of theCouncil considered the cult a mockery ofthe Christian faith and an unveiled attemptto assimilate Christianity with paganism,rather than the other way around. Para-skeva’s icons were even said to have been“miraculously” discovered, as variousChristian icons had—claims that were againan open challenge to the Orthodox faithbecause they explicitly identified Paraskevawith the Tree of Life. So widespread andwell integrated was her cult that at one time,right in the heart of the Russian Empire, inRed Square in Moscow, there stood a chapeldedicated to Paraskeva that was open only towomen, who came there to worship onFridays.Worship of Paraskeva was perhaps themost entrenched pagan tradition of all and itproved the most difficult for the Orthodoxchurch to eradicate, particularly among thepeasantry. The saint was as feared as Baba-Yaga, being associated with death and theunderworld, but at the same time was asrevered as the Virgin Mary. Paganism andChristianity came into direct conflictthrough the cult of Paraskeva, giving wayeventually to an uneasy coexistence of thetwo, called “double faith” (dvoeverie). Onlyafter many generations did Paraskeva’s paganinfluence begin to wane, giving the advan-tage to the Orthodox rite. Paraskeva was notonly worshiped as a saint but was alsoremembered in folklore, where she has twonames—Paraskeva Griaznaia,“MuddyParaskeva” or “Dirty Paraskeva,” and Para-skeva L’nianitsa, “Flaxen Paraskeva.” In thesetwo guises she was identified with MotherEarth and the bounty she provided.See also:Anastasia, Saint; Baba-Yaga (-Jaga,-Iaga); Constantinople; Dvoeverie; IvanGroznyi; Mokosh; Moscow; Mother Earth;Nedelia, Saint; Paraskeva Griaznaia; ParaskevaL'nianitsa; Paraskeva-Piatnitsa; Sreda, Saint;Tree of Life,The; Ukraine; Underworld,The;ZhivaReferences:Afanas'ev 1916 and 1865–69;Bezsonov 1861; Chicherov 1957; Dal' 1957;Haase 1939; Kologrivof 1953; Meyer 1931;Potebnia 1865; Ralston 1872;Warner 1976PARASKEVA GRIAZNAIARussia“Muddy Paraskeva” or “Dirty Paraskeva,” aname given to Saint Paraskeva in popularRussian belief that seems to identify thisaspect of the pagan goddess-saint as MotherEarth.See also:Mother Earth; Paraskeva, SaintReferences:Chicherov 1957; Dal' 1957;Potebnia 1865PARASKEVA L'NIANITSARussia“Flaxen Paraskeva,” a name given to SaintParaskeva that identifies the pagan goddess-saint with the bounty provided by MotherEarth, who is represented by ParaskevaGriaznaia.See also:Mother Earth; Paraskeva, Saint;Paraskeva GriaznaiaReferences:Chicherov 1957; Dal' 1957;Potebnia 1865214PARASKEVA GRIAZNAIA"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"PARASKEVA-PIATNITSARussiaDual aspect of Saint Paraskeva in which sherepresented the duality of Paraskeva Griaznaiaand Paraskeva L'nianitsa, at once MotherEarth and the bounty she provided.

His name ispossibly cognate with that of Paranjanya, anepithet of the Hindu storm god Indra. Perunwas depicted with a head of silver and a goldmustache. In the tenth century an idol ofPerun stood in Novgorod near Lake Il'men',around which six eternal fires burned.Regarded as the lord of the universe, Perunlived in the sky and had absolute controlover the weather. When he was angry, hecaused thunderstorms and sent lightning tostrike down people who had offended him.Belemnite fossils, which formed around thearrow-like internal bone of a creature simi-lar to the cuttlefish, traditionally wereregarded by those who found them as mis-siles flung down by Perun, and they werethus called “thunder arrows.” Perun’s thun-derbolts also were considered a potent fertil-ity symbol because they were thought toawaken the earth in spring from its death-like winter sleep.God of war as well as thunder, Perun wasbelieved to ride across the sky in an ironchariot pulled by an enormous billy goat andto carry a bow and arrows as well as a heavycudgel, a spear, and a battle-ax that alwaysreturned to his hand after it was thrown.Theprotector of soldiers, the god could bestowvictory on those he favored. For this reason,when military or commercial treaties wereconcluded, it was by their naked swords andby Perun that the Russians swore to keeptheir word. Very much an exclusive deity,Perun had no priests, his rites being per-formed by princes and military leaders.However, the common populace did regardhim as necessary to their everyday existence,for without his intervention every morning,Darkness would hold the Sun prisoner in acell whose door was impregnable to every-thing but Perun’s lightning.Cockerels and other animals were offeredas votives to Perun, and human sacrifices inhis honor also were common.

Eventhough Christianity was the new officialfaith in Russia, Christian missionaries foundit enormously difficult to stamp out wor-ship of this king of the gods. In Novgorodhe was apparently tolerated well into theChristian era, as records show that the statueof Perun was solemnly flogged each year torid it of demonic forces. In other areasPerun was simply amalgamated with theprophet Elijah—or Il'ya, as he was known inRussia—because according to the OldTestament, Elijah shared many of Perun’spowers, including the ability to call downrain or fire from heaven. Some say thatPerun became Il'ya Muromets, the bogatyr',although separate legends of Perun and Il'yaMuromets appear to have sprung up side byside.Perun and two other ancient gods, Khorsand Mokosh, together form a trinity.See also:Anna; Basil II, Bulgaroctonus;Bogatyr'; Darkness; Dnieper; Il'men', Lake;Il'ya; Il'ya Muromets; Khor(s); Kiev;Mokosh; Novgorod; Perkunas; Sun;Vikings;Vladimir IReferences:Gimbutas 1971; Ivanov andToporov 1965; Potebnia 1865PERUSANBulgariaThe Bulgar name for Perun, the god ofthunder and rain.See also:PerunPESEIASSlavOne of the two patrons of domestic animals,the other being Krukis.See also:KrukisPETAR LONZARICCroatiaA notorious gambler from the thirteenthcentury who was playing cards outside thechurch of St. Vid in Rijeka (Vid being theSlav form of Vitus) and losing badly.

Paul’s wife,euphemistically referred to as the DarkPrincess, was visited by the Devil in the formof a serpent. Only she could recognize theDevil in this serpent, whereas those aroundher saw only the image of Paul. When shetold her husband of the visit she had receivedin her bedchamber, Paul advised her to dis-cover from the Devil the manner of hisdeath. She did as he asked, and found outthat Paul’s brother Peter would kill him.However, when Peter came to do the dirtydeed he succeeded only in killing the serpentthat had assumed Paul’s guise. It is worthpointing out that at this point in the legendall references to the Dark Princess stop, andit can only be assumed that she was, in fact,a servant of the Devil, and when she hadaccomplished her purpose, she returned toeternal damnation.Peter, however, had been tainted by theblood of the serpent. Covered in sores, he setout in search of a cure for himself and hiskingdom, which had been struck down as aresult of his apparent fratricide.Traveling witha large coterie, Peter arrived at a village calledCharity, where he was carried to an isolatedcottage in which a very beautiful, half-nakedwoman sat spinning. The spinner told Peterthat she lived alone as her family had diedlong before and that she would cure him ofhis affliction on the condition that he marryher. Peter immediately agreed; and no soonerhad he done so than his sores disappeared andhis strength was renewed. However, Peternow saw no reason to marry the maiden, andhe made to leave the cottage. As he did so, hisstrength sapped away and the sores againerupted. Convinced that he had no choice inthe matter, Peter agreed to the union, and thecouple were duly married.At their wedding the woman told Peterthat her name—or rather the name she hadchosen to use as his wife—was Fevroniia.Together Peter and Fevroniia traveled backto Murom, where the influential boyars,angered that Peter had married a mere peas-ant, accused Fevroniia of bad manners at thefeast thrown in honor of their prince.Fevroniia retaliated by performing a series ofmiracles, such as turning crumbs from thetable into frankincense and myrrh. Theseacts, however, did not alleviate the anger ofthe boyars, who demanded that she be ban-ished from court because she was a powerfulsorceress and would hold their wives in herpower. Fevroniia agreed to leave Murom,provided Peter accompany her.So Peter, Fevroniia, and their retinue setout from Murom by boat. As they madecamp that evening, Peter expressed worryabout their exile. Fevroniia assuaged his fearsby performing another miracle: She pickedup the branches that had been cut to fuel thecooking fire and blessed them, saying that bymorning they would be great trees. Trueenough, the following morning Peter and hiscoterie awakened to find themselves in themiddle of a great forest, whereas they hadbeen on the edge of a small wood the nightbefore. Peter and Fevroniia remained thereuntil news was brought to them of a fratrici-dal war that had broken out among theboyars in Murom, who were asking Peterand Fevroniia to return and rule over them.This they did; but while Peter was the fig-urehead, the true ruler of Murom wasFevroniia.219PETER OF MUROM"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Many years passed, and the couple ruledMurom wisely. After Peter died and wasburied in the cathedral, Fevroniia died by herown will on the feast of Kupalo. She wasburied outside the city walls, in emphasis ofher pagan and peasant origins; but the fol-lowing morning the boyars discovered hergrave was beside that of her husband, insidethe cathedral grounds.Fevroniia, as symbolized by her legendarytransformation of the cut branches into afully grown forest, is a personification of thepagan tree goddess. This story, which wasrecorded by the fifteenth-century monkErmolai-erazm, demonstrates the willingnessof the Christian faith to accept certain cen-tral aspects of the ancient pagan religions andshows that the two belief systems lived hap-pily side by side so long as Christianity wasdemonstrably the more potent (as was wellillustrated by the burial of Peter in the cathe-dral and Fevroniia outside the city walls).Themagical movement of Fevroniia’s grave tothe cathedral demonstrates that no matterwhether pagan or Christian, God accepts allinto his kingdom after death.See also:Boyars; Charity; Dark Princess,The;Devil,The; Fevroniia; Kupalo; Murom; PaulReferences:Zenkovsky 1963PETROV DEN'RussiaSaint Peter’s Day, the Christianized festivalthat preceded the harvest and thus welcomedthe degenerative powers of autumn.The fes-tival was popularly referred to as “Petrovki.”Women, married and single, were central tothe festival.

One day, however, Petrushkawas having no luck at all.All day long he hadneither seen nor heard any prey suitable forhis master. Trudging wearily back to thepalace, thinking about the punishment thetsar might mete out, Petrushka saw a whitedove seated in a tree. Carefully notching anarrow to his bow, Petrushka shot andwounded the bird, which fell to the ground.Petrushka ran up to the bird, picked it up,and was about to wring its neck when thebird cried out to Petrushka to spare its life inreturn for a wondrous reward. Petrushkaagreed, and the dove gave him instructionson how he might obtain this reward.Petrushka took the bird home, patched upits broken wing, and set it on his windowsillso that it might rest. When the bird fellasleep, Petrushka tapped it with a finger as hehad been instructed, whereupon the bird fellfrom the sill and instantly became the mostbeautiful maiden in all Russia. Petrushkastared in amazement at the apparition beforehis eyes. Masha the Dove Maiden (for that ishow she was known) said they shouldimmediately marry, and Petrushka agreed.Their life together was extremely happy,though the tsar paid Petrushka little and thecouple lived a life of abject poverty.Petrushka’s entire life savings amounted to amere hundred rubles. One day Masha toldher husband to take those hundred rubles220PETROV DEN'"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"and buy her one hundred skeins of silk.Petrushka did as his wife asked; and whileMasha worked the silk, Petrushka went tobed. The following morning he awoke tofind his wife asleep at the table, and the mostbeautiful silk carpet he had ever seenstretched out in front of her. The work onthe carpet seemed to live, and Petrushkaembraced his wife.She told him to take the carpet into thecity and sell it for the first price he wasoffered, warning him not to ask any price butto let those interested give what they thoughtwas fair. Petrushka did not question his wife,as he knew there were forces afoot that he didnot understand. He simply gathered up thecarpet and went to the market.There he wassoon surrounded by a good number of peo-ple who marveled at the carpet. Many askedhim what price he would take, but Petrushkawould not name a price. Finally, hearing thecommotion, the tsar’s counselor came to seethe carpet and immediately offered Petrushkafive thousand rubles for it. Petrushka acceptedthe money, and the counselor set off for thepalace with the carpet under his arm.At the palace the counselor showed thetsar the new carpet. The tsar immediatelyrecognized it as a woven tableau of his king-dom. So impressed was the tsar with the car-pet that he bought it from his counselor forfifty thousand rubles. The counselor decidedthat there was a great deal of money to bemade from dealing with Petrushka. After thetsar retired to admire his new acquisition, thecounselor rode to Petrushka’s lowly homeand knocked on the door. However, whenMasha opened the door, he was so dumb-struck by her beauty that he could not uttera single word, and so Masha closed the door,thinking that an idiot had called on her.The counselor rode back to the tsar andreported the beauty of Petrushka’s wife to hismaster. The tsar decided to see whether hiscounselor was speaking the truth, and herode out to Petrushka’s home. He wasequally stunned by Masha’s beauty. Thatevening the tsar summoned his counselorand promised him half his kingdom if hecould dispose of Petrushka so that the tsarcould make Masha his wife.The counselor pondered the problem, andwas still pondering it when he wasapproached by a rough peasant who offeredhis assistance in return for a goblet of wine.The counselor gave the peasant the requiredpayment, whereupon the peasant told thecounselor to advise the tsar to ask Petrushkato travel to the underworld to see how thetsar’s father was faring in that land—for therewas never any return from the land of thedead.The counselor so advised the tsar, whocommanded the hapless Petrushka to do asbidden or be put to death. Petrushka coulddo nothing but agree. He went home to tellMasha the news.She told him to sleep soundly. The fol-lowing morning she gave him a gold ring,221PETRUSHKAA 1990 ballet depicting the story of Petrushka by theKirov Opera Company in 1996 (Sovfoto/Eastfoto)"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"which she told him to roll along the ground:It would take him straight to the under-world. She also advised him to take the tsar’scounselor along as a companion becauseotherwise the tsar would never believePetrushka’s report. Thus Petrushka set out,accompanied by the tsar’s counselor.Together they followed the gold ring all theway to the underworld. As they entered thatdark realm they encountered an old manpulling a cart laden with wood, goaded bytwo red-horned demons.Petrushka recognized the old man as thetsar’s father. He called to the demons to allowthe old man ten minutes to talk with him.The demons agreed, but only if the coun-selor took his place; so for ten minutes theold tsar talked with Petrushka, while thecounselor hauled the cart under a relentlessbeating by the demons.Petrushka and the counselor then re-turned to the tsar’s palace and met with thetsar, who was furious to see Petrushka backin his realm. At first the tsar refused tobelieve Petrushka’s story, especially when thelatter told him that his father advised him tobe kinder to his subjects.The tsar was on theverge of ordering his guards to takePetrushka away,when the counselor re-vealed the marks from the beating he hadreceived at the hands of the demons.The tsarreluctantly allowed Petrushka to returnhome, and then set about berating his coun-selor for failing him, demanding that hedevise a new plan.Once more the counselor sought theadvice of the old peasant, who again ac-cepted a goblet of wine in payment for hiscounsel. The peasant told the counselor toinstruct the tsar to send Petrushka to theThrice-Ninth Kingdom, which lay in theThrice-Ninth Land, to capture Kot Bayun,the talking cat, and bring him back.The tsar followed his counselor’s advice,and once again Petrushka returned crest-fallen to his wife, who told him to sleepsoundly for in the morning she would equiphim to safely undertake his task. Sure enoughMasha woke him in the morning and gavehim three felt hats, a pair of pincers, andthree metal rods. Petrushka followed Masha’sadvice to the letter. As he drew near the cat,he put the three felt hats on his head andgrasped the first metal bar in one hand andthe pincers in the other. The cat hissed andclawed viciously at Petrushka; but the hatsprotected him, although they were torn toshreds. Shortly before the cat tore away thethird hat, Petrushka managed to catch theflaying leg in the pincers and started to beatthe animal with the first metal rod, whichwas made of iron. When that bar broke, hepicked up the second bar, made of brass, andcontinued to beat the cat; and when that barbroke, he took the last one, made of tin, andcontinued the punishment. This bar grewhot and bent, but it did not break, and in theend the cat begged mercy and promised togo with Petrushka to his tsar.When he stood again before the tsar,Petrushka bowed and told his ruler that hehad accomplished his mission. The tsarlooked at the cat and asked Petrushka how hecould be sure that this was indeed Kot Bayun.Petrushka released the cat, which immedi-ately bared its teeth, arched its back, spat, andflew at the tsar’s throat.The tsar called out forhelp, whereupon Petrushka simply bran-dished the pincers and the tin bar, and the catreturned to his side. Petrushka then lockedthe cat in a cage within the palace andreturned to the arms of Masha his wife.The tsar nursed his wounds and thencalled for his counselor, telling him that if hedid not rid him of the troublesome Petrushkaonce and for all, the counselor would lose hishead. The counselor immediately sought outthe rough peasant and bought a plan fromhim as he had done twice before, the pay-ment once again being a single goblet ofwine.The peasant this time advised the coun-selor to tell the tsar to send Petrushka to I-Know-Not-Where, with instructions toreturn with I-Know-Not-What.The counselor relayed the plan to the tsar,who in turn passed on these instructions to222PETRUSHKA"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Petrushka, who again returned home andtold Masha of his plight. This time Mashawas at a loss; but she sent her husband off thefollowing morning with an embroideredtowel and a ball of wool that he was to rollon the ground and follow to the home of theonly person in all the world who might help.Petrushka did as he was instructed and fol-lowed the ball of wool. After a long journeythe ball of wool came to rest beside the fencethat surrounded a curious hut that stood onchicken’s legs, a hut that Petrushka immedi-ately recognized as the home of the witchBaba-Yaga.As Petrushka entered the compound thatsurrounded the hut, it stopped revolving inthe wind, and the witch came out to see whohad dared enter her dominion.When she sawPetrushka she cackled and sang about thefine meal of Russian man she would dine onthat night. Unperturbed, Petrushka faced thewitch and told her that she would not enjoyhim as he was, grimy from his journey, andperhaps she would at least allow him to washbefore she ate him. Baba-Yaga led him to abarrel of water, and Petrushka washed off thegrime of the journey, taking out the towelMasha had given him to dry himself on.When Baba-Yaga saw the towel, she askedPetrushka where he had come by it; andwhen he said that Masha his wife had givenit to him, Baba-Yaga embraced Petrushkaand welcomed him as her son-in-law, forMasha was Baba-Yaga’s daughter. Baba-Yagaled Petrushka into her unusual home, andthere she laid out a feast fit for any tsar. Afterthey had eaten, Petrushka explained his mis-sion to his mother-in-law. She knew nothingof I-Know-Not-Where or of I-Know-Not-What, but she told Petrushka that he shouldsleep and she would work on the problemthat night.As soon as Petrushka had fallen asleepBaba-Yaga took her pestle and mortar andsailed through the night sky to the boundariesof the Green Marsh. There she stood on theedge and called out to Babushka-Lyagushka-Skakushka (“Grandmother Hopping Frog”),the oldest living creature. The marsh stirredand the frog appeared. Baba-Yaga asked thefrog if it knew the place I-Know-Not-Whereand the thing I-Know-Not-What; and whenthe frog replied that it did, the witch asked itto take Petrushka there.Babushka-Lyagushka-Skakushka said thatshe would do so, provided Petrushka firstcarried her in a jug of fresh milk to the Riverof Fire; for she was old, and without the reju-venating powers of that river, she would nothave the strength to undertake the journey.Baba-Yaga agreed and took the frog back toher home in her pestle and mortar.There sheprepared a jug of fresh milk, placed the frogin the jug, and woke her son-in-law and toldhim what to do.Petrushka took the jug with the frog in it,mounted Baba-Yaga’s swiftest horse, andwithin a matter of a few minutes, stoodbeside the River of Fire. There Petrushkatook the frog out of the jug and placed heron the ground. Placing one foot in the Riverof Fire, Babushka-Lyagushka-Skakushkastarted to grow until she was the size ofPetrushka’s horse.The frog told the archer toclimb on her back and hold tight, whichPetrushka did, waiting while the frog contin-ued to grow until it was higher than thetallest tree in any forest. The frog made cer-tain that Petrushka was holding on tightlyand then leaped high into the air.When theycame to earth, they found themselves in aforeign land. The frog slowly exhaled untilshe resumed her normal size.Babushka-Lyagushka-Skakushka informedPetrushka that they were now in I-Know-Not-Where. The frog then told Petrushkathat he should go to the lowliest hut in anearby village and hide there behind thestove, for within that hut lived I-Know-Not-What. Petrushka thanked Babushka-Lya-gushka-Skakushka and set out. He found thehut with little difficulty and hid himselfinside, as instructed.A short time later an old man came in andtold Nobody to bring him food. Instantly abanquet appeared. The old man called out223PETRUSHKA"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"again, this time for drink, and a jug of wineappeared. After the old man had eaten anddrunk his fill, Petrushka crept out frombehind the stove and called to Nobody toaccompany him. Then he left the hut withhis mysterious companion and started backtoward the kingdom of the tsar and the armsof his beautiful wife.After a short walk they came across a ban-dit who owned an enormous club.The banditasked Petrushka for food, whereupon Pe-trushka ordered Nobody to supply the banditwith food and drink. The bandit was soimpressed that he offered his club to Petrushkain exchange for Nobody, adding that his club,unaided, would kill anyone its master orderedit to kill. Petrushka agreed to the exchange andthen continued on his way. After he had gonea short distance, he commanded the club tokill the bandit, which it did; and then heordered Nobody to return to him.A distance farther on, Petrushka cameacross a second bandit, this one carrying aguslislung over his shoulder. Again Nobodyfed the man, and again Petrushka agreed tothe exchange of Nobody for the gusli,whichhad the power to create a vast sea when thefirst string was plucked and a huge fleet ofships when the second was plucked; and tocause those ships to fire their cannons when-ever the third string was plucked. However, ashort distance away, Petrushka ordered hisclub to kill the bandit and to return Nobodyto him. Then he continued his journeyhomeward.After many weeks of travel, Petrushkareturned home. To his dismay, he found thedoor broken from its hinges and his wifegone. Cursing the tsar, Petrushka saw a whitedove fly down toward him, and then beforehis eyes, change back into Masha, his wife.The couple embraced. Masha told him thatshe had been forced to hide from the tsar.Petrushka then commanded Nobody tobuild him an impenetrable palace, whichNobody did with amazing speed.Some weeks later the tsar was travelingthrough his kingdom when he came acrossthe palace and asked a local woodsmanwhose it was. When he was told that theowner of the palace was Petrushka, the tsarcommanded ten of his men to enter thepalace and drag Petrushka and his wife out;but when the tsar’s men advanced, the clubflew from a window and quickly killed allten. The tsar then called out his entire army,but Petrushka saw what was happening,opened the gusli,and plucked the first string.A vast sea appeared between the palace andthe tsar’s army. Petrushka then plucked thesecond string, and a fleet of ships appeared.He then plucked the third string time andtime again, and within a few short minutesthe tsar’s army was no more.The tsar, horrified by these events, calledout to Petrushka to stop, whereupon Pe-trushka closed the gusli,and the ships and theocean vanished.Then Petrushka called out tothe tsar to have his counselor put to death,for it was his evil that had led to their prob-lems; but when the counselor heard this, hetook to his heels and fled. Petrushka sent hisclub after the counselor, and the latter fell ashe ran for cover, his head caved in.From that day on, the tsar and Petrushkawere close friends. The tsar gave his oldarcher half the kingdom in recompense forhis service.

On PokrovDay (Pokrovskaia Subbota) in October,which was inextricably linked to pagan fertil-ity worship, it was believed that peasant girlsof marriageable age would be granted favorsby the Virgin Mary as she wandered throughthe countryside. In some areas, the day wouldbe marked by these young women comingtogether to weave a veil to adorn the localicon of the Mother of God, behind whomstood Saint Paraskeva, associated with thepagan goddess of childbirth, Mokosh. By thusinvoking the matriarchal powers of theVirgin, the young women would be assured asuitable marriage, protection from the tiradesof their future husbands, and most important-ly, children. It was also a time when thewomen would ask for a good harvest, thoughthis was not the primary function of the fes-tival of Pokrov Day.See also:Byzantium; Mokosh; Paraskeva,Saint; Pokrovskaia SubbotaReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Haase 1939;Kondakov 1914–15; Potebnia 1865POKROVSKAIA SUBBOTARussiaLiterally,“Sabbath of Protection” or “Sabbathof Intercession.” The true name of PokrovDay, a festival in October at which women(in the main) paid homage to the veil of theVirgin Mary and were thus ensured fertilityand a good, safe marriage.

It is named for the Poliane, a Slavictribe that lived more than a thousand yearsago in what is now Poland.The name Polianecomes from a Slavic word meaning “inhabi-tants of the fields,” which aptly describes acountry that is mostly covered in flat plainsand gently rolling hills. Poland has had a longand varied history.Slavic tribes probably lived in what isnow Poland as early as the second millen-nium B.C. The various tribes were first unit-ed under one ruler in the tenth century A.D.,under the Christian prince Mieczyslaw. In1025, Boleslaw was crowned the first king of225POLANDEngraving of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a Polish patriot(1746–1817), in battle (Archive Photos)"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Poland, but after his death later that year,Poland went through periods of warfare anddisunity. By the mid-twelfth century, it hadbroken up into several sections, each ruledby a different noble. Mongols devastated thecountry in 1241. Some time later, Germanand Jewish refugees began to migrate intoPoland and settle among the Slavic indi-genes. In 1386, Queen Jadwiga of Polandmarried Wladyslaw Jagiello, the Grand Dukeof Lithuania—a move that combined bothcountries’ rule under a single monarch,though each remained largely self-governing. Jagiellonian kings ruled Polandfor nearly 200 years, and under their leader-ship Poland expanded its territory and madeimportant advances in its cultural, eco-nomic, and political development. ThePolish empire reached its height during thesixteenth century, when it covered a largepart of central and eastern Europe, includingUkraine and Belorussia. In 1493, the firstnational parliament of Poland was estab-lished, and in 1569, Poland and Lithuaniawere united under a single parliament. Atthat time, Poland was the largest country inEurope. It would not long be so. In 1648,Poland lost much of its territory in Ukraineas a result of a rebellion there, and in 1655,Sweden won control over most of Poland’sBaltic provinces. The dramatic decline ofPoland continued into the eighteenth cen-tury. In 1772, Austria, Prussia, and Russiatook advantage of Poland’s weakness andpartitioned Polish territory among them-selves. Austria seized land in the south,Prussia took land in the west, and Russiatook land in the east. As a result, Poland lostaround one-third of its territory and half ofits population. In 1793, Prussia and Russiaseized additional territory in eastern andwestern Poland, which led to an uprisingamong Poles in 1794. Polish forces underThaddeus Kosciuszko fought Russian andPrussian troops but were defeated, as a resultof which Austria, Prussia, and Russia dividedwhat remained of the country among them-selves in 1795.In 1815 a small, self-governing Kingdomof Poland was created under Russian control.In 1830, Poles in the Kingdom of Polandrebelled against the Russians, but Russiacrushed the revolt. Other unsuccessful revoltswere launched against Austria and Prussia,and after a second revolt in the Kingdom ofPoland in 1863, Russia tried to destroyPolish culture by making Russian the officiallanguage there. After 1871, when Prussiaformed the German Empire, Poles underPrussian control were forced to adopt theGerman language.

Recorded within 150 years ofthe adoption of Christianity as the statereligion, the Primary Chroniclerelates thelegends in the spirit of dvoeverie; thus,although the legends obviously reflect aChristianized view of pagan religiousbeliefs, they retain enough of their originalcharacter to enable the pagan elements tobe reconstructed. The Primary Chronicleisalso considered an extremely useful sourceof early Russian history. There are severalversions of the text. One,Povest' vremennykhlet,is known as the Laurentian.

The king of snakes was a strangebeing with the head of a man but the bodyof a huge serpent. Trying to ignore his situ-ation, Purto lit a fire and sat down to dryhimself, and he did not feel the king ofsnakes reach out and place his mark on theyoung man’s back. Purto placed some of hiscatch on a spit and roasted it over his fire,and having only taken a small portion forhimself, offered the rest to the king of snakesand his four serpent attendants.After he had eaten, the king asked Purtofor some water. Purto left the cave andreturned a short time later with a basin ofwater from a nearby spring. Then Purto setto work, and six days later he had finisheddigging a channel from the spring so thatclear water now flowed into a basin he hadprepared in the cave. Thanking him for hiskindness, Shah-Mar gave Purto a small stoneof great value and then adopted the younghunter as his son.Purto thanked Shah-Mar and went hisway, sold the stone for a great price, settledall his debts, and built himself a fine man-sion.Then he bought a flock of forty sheepand returned to the cave, where he regallyentertained Shah-Mar and his attendants. Inreturn Shah-Mar gave Purto another stoneof great value and an escort back to hismansion.Meanwhile Kayen, or Cain, the ruler ofKilikia, or Cilicia, who had his palace inAdana (in south-central Turkey, above the“tail” of Cyprus), had fallen ill with terribleulcers all over his body that were slowly eat-ing him away.The king called his most trusteddoctor to his side and asked him if there wasany cure for his illness. The doctor knew ofPurto, and by magic means, also of his associ-ation with Shah-Mar. He told the king thatonly the power of Shah-Mar could cure himand that he would see to it that Purtobrought the king of snakes to his assistance.The doctor had Purto brought to him andtold him to bring Shah-Mar to the palace.Purto refused, whereupon the doctor hadPurto flogged. Still Purto refused, so the doc-tor had Purto’s ears sliced open and salt andpepper rubbed into the wounds. Still Purtoremained resolute, so the doctor set to theunfortunate hunter with pincers, tearing offlarge chunks of his flesh until finally Purtoconsented.Purto made his way painfully to the caveof Shah-Mar, who already knew of the tor-ment his adopted son had suffered. Shah-Mar quickly consented to travel with himto Adana. On the way they came to MountNauriz, where Shah-Mar plucked a flowerand told Purto to swallow it. Then hepicked a whole bunch of different flowersand told Purto to make a brew of them,which would imbue him with the power oftelling the properties of every flower andherb. Purto did as he was told and then fellasleep. When he awoke, he found that hedid indeed know the healing qualities ofevery plant in existence.Shah-Mar then told Purto that he mustnow make him drunk on red wine that wasexactly seven years old. Then he was to cutoff his head, bury his body, and make twopotions—one from the brains in the left sideof his head, and one from those in the rightside, the former potion being healing and thelatter poisonous. Purto did as he wasinstructed and then set out for the palacewith the two potions. There Kayen told the229PURTO"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"doctor to test the medicine, so Purto gavehim the concoction made from the right-hand brains of Shah-Mar.As soon as the doc-tor tasted the brew, he screamed the mosthideous scream anyone had ever heard, andhe died before his body hit the floor. Theking was petrified; but when Purto explainedwhat had happened, the king was happy todrink the other potion. He was immediatelycured of his vile illness. From that day forth,he decreed, Purto would be known asLoqmân the Wise, the Father of Medicine.All went well for a while, but then one ofthe snakes that had once attended Shah-Marlearned of the king of snakes’ death, and hesent word to all the snakes of the world tocome together and attack Adana. When theking heard what was happening, he sent forLoqmân the Wise, who promised to quicklysettle the situation. Loqmân the Wise thenmade a potion from the liver of Shah-Marand set out to visit the snakes, wearing theprayer beads that had once belonged toShah-Mar. When they saw these beads andreceived the potion made from Shah-Mar’sliver, the snakes accepted Loqmân the Wiseas their king and made their peace.Loqmân the Wise took a deaf and dumbyouth as his assistant. Unsure that the youthwas really afflicted as he appeared, Loqmânmade sure that the youth did not learn any ofhis secrets, at the same time as he attemptedto trick him into talking. For seven years theyouth remained dumb, but Loqmân contin-ued to try to make him speak.One day they were summoned by a manwho suffered intolerable headaches. Loqmânbrewed the man a potion that rendered himunconscious and then removed the top ofthe man’s head.There he saw an eight-leggedcreature crawling inside the man’s brain; buttry as he could, he could not get a grip on itwith his pincers. The young man, forgettinghis subterfuge, told Loqmân to heat thetongs, which Loqmân did and so cured theman. However, knowing that his secret wasout and that his life was in peril, the assistanttook to his heels and hid, and no matter howhard Loqmân searched for him, he could notfind him.Many years later, as Loqmân grew old andknew death was close at hand, he called forthe youth’s mother to come to him and per-suade her son to give himself up, for Loqmânmeant him no harm. Several days passed.Finally the assistant came back, and the twowere reconciled. Then Loqmân had theyouth brew a potion that would restore hislife, but the assistant managed to pour onlyone drop into Loqmân’s mouth. Loqmângasped, and then died.Thereafter the assistant was beset withhaunting nightmares of Loqmân and took towandering the countryside. For twenty-fiveyears he wandered sleeplessly, until he cameto a richly appointed house, the home of abishop whose wife was in labor but couldnot deliver. The youth went to her aid, andwith the knowledge he had gained fromLoqmân, delivered the baby. Having thusproved his worth, the young man conqueredhis nightmares, and from that day to his deathhe slept peacefully.See also:Cain; Cilicia; Kayen; Kilikia; King ofSnakes; Loqmân the Wise; Shah-MarReferences:Hakyuni 1901PUSKAITISLatviaA subterranean deity who lived beneath anelder bush and ruled over the barstukai andkaukai.

The nameappears to be related to rad,meaning “glad-ness,” or to rod,meaning “birth” or “off-spring.” Celebrated in the main by women,Radunitsa was concerned with the damag-ing aspects of fertility and rebirth, and washeld in direct contrast to, and to counteractthe effects of, the Rusaliia, which was heldslightly later in the year. It has been arguedthat russalki, with whom the festival isclosely linked, were once known as radu-nitsy.In Kievan Rus', Radunitsa was alsocalled Babii Prazdnik (“Old woman’s holi-day”). During the festival it was customaryto paint eggs, a practice that was later trans-ferred to the Christian festival of Easter.The egg in both cases symbolizes rebirth: Itwas a seemingly inert or dead object fromwhich life would eternally emerge—lifethat would later be reborn in a futureegg, and so on, with the cycle beingendlessly repeated.See also:Babii Prazdnik; Rus(s)alki (~ulki)References:Mansikka 1922; Snegirev1837–39RAIRussiaOne of various names applied to theunderworld, others being Nava and Peklo.Rai was believed to be the home ofAlkonost', a terrible bird-woman whosesong tortured the souls of the dead andgave them no rest.

Peklo was a paradisal realm that couldbe associated with the Elysian Fields ofHades. Nava could be equated with therivers of Hades, while Rai would seem to beclosest to Tartarus.

Rod was originally the god ofhusbandmen, though his attributes went farbeyond this role. He was a universal deity, thegod of heaven, rain, and the thunderbolt,who had created the world and all forms oflife in it. He created man by sprinkling dustor gravel over the surface of the earth, estab-lished the importance of the family, and unit-ed his devotees into a unified nation. Hiswife was called Rozhanitsa (also spelledRozanica). The frequent use of the wordwith the plural ending -y (rozhanitsy) impliesthat Rod had many wives; appropriately,polygamy was a common trait among paganSlavs. Later, Rod was toppled from his posi-tion at the head of the pantheon by Perunand was reduced to his role as protector ofthe home and guardian of ancestors.

The earliestknown inhabitants of Romania merged withinvaders from Thrace to form an indigenouspeople who became subject to Rome whentheir land was conquered by Emperor Trajanaround A.D. 106 and became the Romanprovince of Dacia. Most of the inhabitants,known as Daci, had originally emigratedfrom Thrace in northern Greece. Followingthe withdrawal of the Romans in 275,Romania was occupied by Goths. Later,between the sixth and the twelfth centuries,it was overrun by Huns, Bulgars, Slavs, andothers. Through intermarriage and gradualassimilation with Slavic tribes, these peopledeveloped into a distinct ethnic group calledWalachians, or in Slavonic, Vlachs. Theirnomadic habits and warlike conduct madethem a constant threat to the neighboringByzantine Empire.Under Bulgarian rule, in the ninth cen-tury, the Orthodox form of Christianity wasintroduced to Dacia. Around the end of thethirteenth century, Hungarian expansion byMagyars drove many of the people from thewestern provinces to settle south and east ofthe Carpathians. There they established the233ROMANIA"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"principality of Walachia and later that ofMoldavia, each ruled by native princes orvoivodes(from the Russian voevoda,“leaderof an army”), many of whom acknowledgedthe suzerainty of the kings of Hungary orPoland. With the defeat of the Hungariansby the Ottoman Empire at the Battle ofMohács in 1526, Moldavia and Walachiacame under Turkish rule, which lasted threecenturies. At the close of the sixteenth cen-tury, Moldavia, Transylvania, and Walachiawere temporarily united by Prince Michaelof Walachia, who made continual war onthe Turkish sultan in an attempt to gain andmaintain independence. For a time Michaelsuccessfully opposed the Ottomans, con-quering Transylvania in 1599 and Moldaviain 1600, but he was assassinated the follow-ing year, and the spirit of independencewaned thereafter.The Ottomans restored their control overthe principalities after Michael’s death,imposing severe political restrictions. Finallythe Romanians turned to Russia for help. Inan effort to fend off the growing influence ofRussia in the early eighteenth century,Moldavia and Walachia were ruled byTurkish-appointed hospodars(Old Slavgospodî,“lords”), usually members of Greekfamilies from the Phanar district of Con-stantinople.Russian influence became preeminentafter 1750 and remained so for a century. In1774 Russia defeated Turkey, which wasthen forced to promise lenient treatment ofMoldavia and Walachia. In 1802 Russiaobtained a voice in the appointment ofhospodars.In 1812, having defeated Turkeyin the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812,Russia obtained Bessarabia, which had pre-viously been part of the principality ofMoldavia. The weakening of Turkish influ-ence became more evident after the start ofthe Greek War of Independence in 1821. Bythe Treaty of Adrianople, which ended theGreek war in 1829, Moldavia and Walachia,while remaining nominally under Turkishcontrol, became more autonomous. ThePhanariot system was ended, and Russiabecame the unacknowledged suzerain ofthe two states—a situation disapproved ofby the great European powers, which hadbegun to intervene in Balkan affairs duringthe Greek war.The country has existed within its currentborders since 1859.See also:Bessarabia; Black Sea; Boyars;Bulgaria; Byzantine Empire; Dacia; Hungary;Magyars; Moldavia; Poland; Russia;Transylvania;WalachiaROSSIYAGeneral“Land of the Rus',” the Russian name for thecountry of Russia.ROSTOVGeneralPort on the river Don in southwest Russia,some 14 miles (23 kilometers) east of the Seaof Azov.

Although they principally livedin the waters that flowed through the forest,they would quite often climb out and lie onthe banks of the river or lake, or climb a treethat hung over the still waters below. Theirfavorite pastime was combing their flowinggolden or green hair while admiring theirbeauty in the water. On clear, moonlit nightsthey would assemble to dance and sing,weaving garlands out of the forest flowers. Arussalka could not live long out of the water;but as long as she carried her comb, she wasnot in danger, for her comb gave her themagical ability to conjure up water when sheneeded it, no matter where she was.Russalki were thought to be the spirits ofdrowned girls, so they were depicted asalmost human, though their characteristicsdepended on their surroundings: Russalki ofsoft and sunny southern rivers were de-scribed as nubile and attractive, while thosefrom the cold north were stern, cruel, andugly.Their skin was exceptionally translucentand pale, and they sometimes had tails; thelatter characteristic indicates that they mighthave originated as mermaids. Like leshie theypossessed the power to transform theirappearance; but they were severely limited inthis ability, for they could only change intoanimals that lived in the water, such as fish ortoads and frogs. Some accounts say that dur-ing the winter the russalki lived in the water,coming ashore during the summer to live inthe forest.The russalki are spinners who weave thecycle of the seasons and the weather andwho regulate human and animal fertility.They are mistresses of the woodland;guardians of streams, lakes, and other water-ways; and representatives of Mother Earth.They were the goddesses of the horse, andcould change their shape at will into that ofany animal—though if they were not inhuman form, they would most commonlyappear as a horse. In the underworld theywere said to inhabit Nava, the ocean that thedead had to traverse upon entry into theafterlife. Depending on the region, the rus-salki had various names, such as mavki, navki,vodianiani, and faraony; but no matter whatname they were known by, they shared com-mon attributes, if not appearance.They wereinextricably linked to the festivals ofRadunitsa and Rusaliia, and they may beequated with the Germanic Lorelei, theFrench Ondine, and the classical Greek sirensand harpies.Often represented as sad and lonely fig-ures, russalki might well attempt to findhuman companions who could be lured totheir deaths and thus join the russalki in theirunderwater crystal palaces. Young childrenwere fair game, and legends describe the rus-salki as attempting to lure them into thewater with baskets of fruit and nuts or bis-cuits. However, what every russalka reallydesired was a young man. In order to lureyoung men into their power they wouldleave the water and call out young men’snames at random. If a young man in the for-est was foolish enough to call out in reply,then the russalka had him in her power.Therussalka would then make him join her inher games and eventually would drown himin the water.

Spending the winter sealhunting on the bleak island of NovayaZemlya, in the Arctic Circle, he spent manynights alone in his hut playing his balalaika.One night the oil in his lamp ran out and hecontinued to play in the dark.

The fol-lowing night, the same thing happened.Finally he hid the lit lamp behind a thickcurtain, and as soon as the sound of dancingstarted, he drew back the curtain, revealing ayoung girl.This girl explained to Ivan that she was arussalka but that as she had a human father,she was able to remain out of the water aslong as she liked, so long as she was only inthe presence of one person. Ivan fell hope-lessly in love with the russalka and they spentthe winter together. However, when springcame Ivan had to return to his home to sellhis catch. On parting the russalka gave himinstructions on how he might find her again.Some time later Ivan found he could notlive without the russalka. Rememberingwhat the russalka had told him, he soughtout her home, climbed a tree that hungabove the water, and on the stroke of midday,dived into the water. As he reached the bot-tom of the river, his love rushed out from theweeds and embraced him. Ivan stayed quitesome time beneath the waters of that river,but in the end he began to long for home.Remembering that anyone could be pro-tected from the charms of the russalka by theholy cross, he made the sign and was imme-diately transported back home—thoughhaving crossed himself, he would never beable to return to his love. In the words ofAlexander Pushkin (1799–1837) in his poemRussalka:She looked at him and shook her hair,Threw kisses, laughedAnd like a child,Cried to the monk: “Come to me,here....”Some authorities have sought to connectthe russalka with Rosa,the Latin for “rose,”and thus say that the name is a reflection ofthe wedding garlands worn by newly mar-ried women.See also:Arkhangel'sk; Faraony; IvanSavel'evich; Leshii (~y); Mavki; Mother Earth;Nava; Navki; Novaya Zemlya; Radunitsa;Rusaliia; Underworld,The;VodianianiReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Branston 1980;Gimbutas 1982; Haase 1939; Mansikka 1922;Moszynski 1967; Oinas 1969; Paulson 1971;Pomerantseva 1975; Pushkin 1964; Ralston1880 and 1872; Snegirev 1837–39;Vasilenko1960RUSSIAGeneralThe Russian Empire in the nineteenth cen-tury comprised parts of Europe and westernand northern Asia—a vast territory that wasinherited by the Bolshevik regime after therevolution of October 1917 and subse-quently renamed the Union of Soviet So-cialist Republics (USSR).Today Russiacom-monly refers specifically to the RussianFederation, the largest and most influential ofthe fifteen former constituent republics ofthe USSR, and an independent nation sinceChristmas Day 1991.The term Russiaalso isused more broadly to denote the formerRussian Empire. At its greatest extent, in237RUSSIA"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"1914, the Russian Empire included about8.5 million square miles (22 million sq km),an estimated one-sixth of the land area of theearth, divided into four general regions:Russia proper, comprising the easternmostpart of Europe and including the GrandDuchy of Finland and most of Poland; theCaucasus; Siberia; and Russian Central Asia,which was further subdivided into the stepperegions of the southwest and RussianTurkestan in the southeast. It is roughly thishistorical area that is represented within thisbook, along with a few fringe areas that havecome under, or exhibit, Slavic and/orRussian influences.During the pre-Christian era the vast ter-ritory that became Russia was sparselyinhabited by groups of wandering, nomadictribes, many of which were described byGreek and Roman writers. The largelyunknown north, a region of extensive forests,was inhabited by tribes later known collec-tively as Slavs—the ancestors of the modernRussian people. Far more important was thesouth, where the indeterminate regionknown as Scythia was occupied by a succes-sion of Asian peoples, including the Cim-merians, Scythians, and Sarmatians.In the early centuries of the Christian era,the Asian peoples of Scythia were displacedby the Goths, who established a kingdom onthe Black Sea. In the fourth century A.D. theinvading Huns conquered and expelled theGoths, destroying Scythia.The Huns held theterritory constituting present-day Ukraineand the region of Bessarabia until their defeatin western Europe in 451. Later came theAvars, followed by the Magyars and theKhazars, who remained influential untilabout the mid-tenth century.Meanwhile, during this long period ofsuccessive invasions, the Slavic tribes dwell-ing northeast of the Carpathian Mountainshad begun a series of migratory movements.As these migrations took place, three distinc-tive subdivisions evolved. The western tribesevolved as the Moravians, Poles, Czechs, andSlovaks; the southern tribes as the Serbs,Croats, Slovenes, and Bulgars; and the easterntribes as Russians, Ukrainians, andBelorussians. The Eastern Slavs becamerenowned traders and established a numberof trading posts, notably the cities of Kiev inthe south and Novgorod in the north.The political organization of the EasternSlavs was largely tribal. According toRussian tradition recorded in the PrimaryChronicle,internal dissension and feudsamong the Eastern Slavs around Novgorodbecame so violent that they voluntarilychose to call upon a foreign prince whocould unite them into one strong state.Theirchoice was Riurik, a Scandinavian chief,who in 862 became ruler of Novgorod.Twoother Scandinavians, Dir and Askold—possibly legendary figures—gained controlof Kiev;A.D. 862 is thus considered thebeginning of the Russian Empire. From theScandinavians, called Varangians, or Rus',came the name Rossiya,or Russia, meaning“land of the Rus'.” The establishment ofRiurik and the dynasty he founded initiateda period of consolidation and expansion ofSlavic populations, notably toward thenortheast and northwest, where indigenousFinnic groups were largely absorbed orreplaced by Slavs.Riurik was succeeded in 879 by his sonIgor (reigned 912–945), a child for whomOleg ruled as regent. Prince Oleg, realizingthe value of the Kiev region, had theVarangian rulers of that city killed in 882 andunited the two centers, establishing his capi-tal at Kiev. He extended Russian rule con-siderably, subduing neighboring tribes, andled his raiders as far south as Constantinople,where he concluded a treaty with Byzantiumin 911—the first event in Russian historythat bears a date verified by non-Russiansources. In the years that followed, Russianrelations with the Byzantine Empire becamecontinually closer. Igor assumed power in912, and in 945 he was succeeded by hiswidow, Olga, who became a Christian in955. In 964 Olga abdicated in favor of herson, Sviatoslav, the first prince of the house238RUSSIA"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"of Riurik to bear a Slav name.With his gov-ernment centered in Kiev, Sviatoslav devotedhimself to strengthening the Russian posi-tion in the south. He led his troops againstthe Khazars in the southeast, against thePechenegs, and against the Bulgars. Sviatoslavbuilt a great empire, and commerce andcrafts increased under his reign.The empire was divided among theprince’s three sons, causing dynastic conflictsthat were ended in 980 when the youngestson, Vladimir I, later known as Vladimir theGreat, became sole ruler. The most signifi-cant event of his reign was his conversion toChristianity (the Byzantine rite) in 988 andthe institution of that religion as the officialreligion of the Russian people. After castingoff his several pagan wives,Vladimir marriedAnna, a sister of the Byzantine emperor BasilII. Early Russian monasteries and churcheswere built in the Byzantine style, andByzantine culture ultimately became thepredominant influence in such fields asarchitecture, art, and music.Upon the death of Vladimir in 1015, hisdominions were divided among his sons, andstrife immediately developed. Vladimir’seldest son, Sviatopolk, called The Accursed(reigned 1015 and 1018–1019), held thesupreme power; but in order to secure hisposition, he murdered his brothers Boris andGleb. Sviatopolk in turn was defeated anddeposed by his brother Yaroslav the Wise,prince of Novgorod. Yaroslav attempted tore-create the empire of his grandfatherSviatoslav, and by 1036 he had succeeded inmaking himself ruler of all Russia. Duringhis reign, the state of Kiev reached its great-est power. Yaroslav made Kiev an imperialcapital with magnificent buildings, includingthe notable Hagia Sophia. Schools wereopened; and the grand duke revised the firstRussian law code, the Russkaia pravda.Toconsolidate the position of his heirs,Yaroslavdevised a system of precedence, grading thevarious principalities from the smallest toKiev, the most powerful, so that when agrand duke of Kiev died, each vassal belowhim was moved to a larger principality, end-ing with the throne of Kiev.Although this unique pattern of prece-dence was nominally practiced, Yaroslav’sdeath in 1054 signaled Kiev’s decline. Onefinal attempt was made to unite the countryby Yaroslav’s grandson, Vladimir II Mono-machus; but his death in 1125 ended effortsto form an alliance, and the division contin-ued, with other states challenging Kiev’ssupremacy. Russia became a loose federationof city-states held together by a commonlanguage, religion, traditions, and customsand ruled by members of the abundanthouse of Riurik, who were usually involvedin internecine wars.In the early thirteenth century a greaterdanger than any that Russia previously hadfaced came from the east. In 1223 theMongol armies of Genghis Khan appeared inthe southeast, and in the Battle of the KalkaRiver (now Kalmius River), completelyrouted Russian forces. For twelve years afterthis Mongol victory, however, the khan’sarmies remained in their homelands. In1237, Batu Khan, grandson of GenghisKhan, led the Mongols again to easternRussia; this time, on their march northward,they captured and destroyed most of themajor cities on their route.In 1240 Batu Khan swept the southwest,destroying Kiev despite the city’s desperateeffort at self-defense, and in 1242 he estab-lished his capital at Sarai on the lower Volga(near modern Volgograd), where he foundedthe khanate known as the Golden Horde.Although the Mongols did not attackNovgorod, northwestern Russia was men-aced by invaders from the west at the sametime. In 1240 a Swedish army landed on thebanks of the Neva. Prince AlexanderYaroslavevich led a Russian army to meetthem, and his forces so completely defeatedthe Swedes that he was thenceforth knownas Alexander Nevsky (the epithet means “ofthe Neva”). Two years later the TeutonicKnights advanced from the west, but againAlexander’s troops routed the enemy. Faced239RUSSIA"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"with continuing danger in the west,Alexander adopted a policy of loyal acquies-cence to the Golden Horde and conciliationwith the khan. In 1246 Alexander succeededhis father as grand prince of Novgorod, andin 1252 he was invested by the khan as grandprince of Vladimir and Suzdal'.In 1263 Alexander Nevsky gave Moscowto his younger son, Daniel, the progenitor ofa line of powerful Muscovite dukes, who asMongol favorites, gradually extended theirlands by annexing surrounding territories. In1328 Daniel’s son Ivan I became duke ofMuscovy. Beginning with Ivan, the dukes ofMuscovy styled themselves “princes of allRussia.”In the mid-fourteenth century internaldissension weakened the power of theGolden Horde. Taking advantage of thisweakness, Grand Duke Dmitrii led the firstsuccessful revolt against the Mongols.Dmitrii’s important victory over the Mon-gols on the banks of the Don River in 1380won him the honorary title Donskoi(of theDon) and marked the turning point ofMongol power.When Constantinople fell to the Otto-man Turks in 1453, Moscow became thecenter of Christian Orthodoxy. The grandduke Ivan III Vasilevich, who added toMuscovy the states of Novgorod in 1478 andTver' in 1485, began to regard himself as thetsar. In 1480 he refused to pay the annualtribute to the Golden Horde, a date that isregarded as the end of Tatar domination.Once free of Tatar rule, Ivan invadedLithuanian territory, in 1492 and 1500. Ivan’sson and successor, Basil III Ivanovich, fol-lowed his father’s aggressive policy of expan-sion to the west—he annexed Pskov in 1510,captured Smolensk in 1514, and absorbedthe grand duchy of Riazan' in 1521.Ivan IV Vasilevich, better known as IvanGroznyi (“the Terrible”), became ruler in1533 at the age of three. In 1547 Ivanassumed the throne and became the firstMuscovite grand duke to be formallycrowned as tsar. In 1549 he convened thefirst Zemsky Sobor (National Assembly), andin December 1564, Ivan left Moscow andannounced that he had abdicated. Hereturned the following January, however,having agreed to resume the throne afterreceiving absolute powers. He then seizedhalf of Muscovy as his personal property—aterritory called the oprichnina,which was aseparate administrative unit ruled directly bythe tsar. Ivan distributed these holdingsamong his supporters as rewards for militaryand personal service, thereby establishing anew service corps of oprichnikiwho acted asIvan’s personal police. In 1552 Muscovitearmies conquered and annexed the Tatarkingdom of Kazan', while Astrakhan' becamea Russian territory in 1556.Ivan’s son, Fyodor I, was sickly and feeble-minded, and during his reign (1584–1598)he was dominated by his brother-in-law, theboyar Boris Godunov. In 1598, when Fyodordied childless, ending the house of Riurik,Boris was elected tsar by a Zemsky Sobor.Although he ruled with ability, his hold onthe throne was uneasy because of the widelyheld belief that he had murdered DmitriiIvanovich, a son and legal heir of Ivan theTerrible. Dmitrii’s mysterious death in 1591made possible the subsequent appearance ofpretenders to his name and ranks, inaugurat-ing a period of unrest and revolt known inRussian as the smutnoe vremia(Time ofTroubles).In 1604 a pretender to the throne callinghimself Dmitrii I, and known as the FalseDmitrii, gained the support of a number ofPolish and Lithuanian nobles and Cossacks.Three months after the death of Boris in1605, Dmitrii I entered Moscow and wascrowned tsar. He was murdered by boyarswho subsequently elevated Prince BasilShuisky to the throne. This move wasopposed by the Cossacks and rebellious peas-ants who supported a second pretender,Dmitrii II, who was already advancing onMoscow. At the same time King SigismundIII of Poland invaded from the west.At Basil’srequest, Sweden sent in armed support. After240RUSSIA"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"a long period of fighting and intrigue, in1610, Basil was deposed and the country fellinto a state of anarchy. The situation was atlast resolved in 1613 when a Zemsky Soborelected Michael Romanov, grandnephew ofAnastasia Romanovna, as tsar. Michaelfounded the ruling house of Romanov.Under the first two Romanovs—Michaeland his son Alexis I, who succeeded him astsar in 1645—Russia advanced to the statusof a European power. In 1654 the Cossacksof Ukraine, rebelling against Polish rule,offered their allegiance to Tsar Alexis; and inthe resulting war with Poland (1654–1667)Russia regained Smolensk (lost in 1611) aswell as eastern Ukraine, including Kiev.Alexis was succeeded by his son FyodorIII, and he in turn was replaced in 1682 byhis half brother, Peter I (the Great). Peter’solder half sister Sophia Alekseyevna suc-ceeded in having her own brother, theweak-minded Ivan V, declared senior co-regent with herself acting as regent. Sophiawas forced to resign all power in 1689 afteran attempt to deprive Peter of his right tothe throne and to assassinate both him andhis mother.The accession of Peter I to the tsardom in1682 marked the beginning of a period dur-ing which Russia became a major Europeanpower. Peter was greatly attracted by the cul-ture of western Europe, and in 1697 he led atechnical and diplomatic mission to the West.He was absent from Russia for eighteenmonths. On his return, Peter attempted totransform Russia into a Western society andto make the Russian state a major power inEurope. Moreover, during his reign Russiabegan a series of great territorial acquisitions.In 1703 Peter began construction of a newcapital city, St. Petersburg, on marshy terri-tory taken from Sweden.The seat of govern-ment was moved there from Moscow in1714. By the terms of the Treaty of Nystad(30 August 1721), Russia acquired Livonia,Estonia, Ingria, part of Karelia, and severalBaltic islands. Having achieved Russiandominance in northern Europe, Peter wasformally proclaimed emperor in 1721, andthe Muscovite state was renamed the Rus-sian Empire.Peter left no direct heir. His son Alexishad been charged with treason and died inprison in 1718. The throne thus went toPeter’s second wife, Catherine I. After herdeath in 1727 the accession passed to a suc-cession of rulers. Peter II, the son of Alexis,was chosen emperor after Catherine, andwas succeeded in 1730 by Anna Ivanovna,daughter of Ivan V. Anna ruled as a despotand was succeeded by Ivan VI, an eight-week-old grandnephew. A palace conspiracythe next year placed Elizabeth Petrovna,youngest daughter of Peter the Great, on thethrone, and under her rule (1741–1762) anational revival took place. Her nephew andsuccessor, Peter III, was swiftly deposed andmurdered. His wife, a German princess bybirth, ascended the throne as Catherine II,and became better known as Catherine theGreat.241RUSSIAPeter the Great of Russia (1672–1725) (ArchivePhotos)"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Catherine successfully carried out ambi-tious plans for Russian expansion.

The Russian was riding a thinwhite horse and the Tatar a sturdy black one.As night fell, the two made camp. After theyate, they argued over who should keep watchover their horses.The Russian argued that hehad no need to watch his horse, because itwas white and therefore easy to see; so it wasonly fair that the Tatar should guard his ownmount. The Tatar, hoping to get the betterend of the bargain, exchanged his horse forthe Russian’s—whereupon the Russian saidthat he had no need to watch over a blackhorse, which could not be seen at night.TheTatar stood guard and fumed.After a while he led the Russian’s horse toa nearby swamp and pushed it in beforereturning to their camp and falling asleep.The Russian had only been pretending tosleep, and as soon as the Tatar fell asleep, heled that man’s horse to the swamp, rescuedhis own, and pushed the Tatar’s horse in.

TheTatar rushed to the swamp, but the horse hadbeen dead several hours.Feigning compassion, the Russian sold hishorse ostensibly so that they would be equal,and the two continued on their way on foot.Before long the Tatar suggested that theyshould take turns carrying each other.

Each of the twenty-seven portionswould then be thrown into a heap and mixedtogether. Half of this mixture would beground into flour and made into small loaves,one for each member of the family. Theremainder would be mixed with more barleyand brewed into beer.Then, on an evening atthe beginning of December, when farmerscould expect that they would not be inter-rupted, they would celebrate the harvest.First the farmer would pour a jug of thebeer over the bung of the barrel and take thebeer through to where his wife and familywere waiting with a black, white, or speckled(never red) cock and hen. With the jug ofbeer in his hand, the farmer would kneel andgive thanks for the harvest. Then he wouldtake a wooden spoon and beat the cock andhen to death. His wife would then boil thebirds in a new pot, and the cooked meat andsmall loaves would be set out.The farmer andhis family would then drink the beer and eatthe flesh and the loaves, until everything hadbeen eaten and all the beer had been drunk.The bones of the birds would then be givento the dogs; and if they left anything, theremains would be buried under thedung in the cattle stall.All this was done to celebrate andgive thanks for the harvest and toensure a similarly good harvest in thecoming year. This complex ritualwas performed in December torekindle the fertility of the earth at atime when everything would appeardead and thus to ensure that the followingyear the earth would spring back to life.Theritual was widely practiced until about thestart of the nineteenth century, and a variantof it is still practiced in rural areas today.SADKORussiaOriginally an ancient water deity, Sadkoreemerged after the advent of Christianity asa poor musician from Novgorod who playedthe gusli,a stringed instrument similar to apsaltery—essentially, a flat wooden box thatwas laid across the knees and plucked withthe fingers. Sadko earned his living by play-ing at banquets. One day he fell into disfa-vor, for a reason that is not given. Saddenedand worried by this, he went to the shores ofLake Il'men', where he began to play. Heplayed all day long and into the dusk—untilhe saw a huge wave forming out on the lake.Greatly frightened, he ran all the way back toNovgorod.Three days later, still out of favor, hereturned to the shores of Lake Il'men' and satdown to play. Again a huge wave formed onthe lake and he ran away.Another three dayspassed before Sadko had plucked up enoughcourage to return to the lake. Once more heplayed until the huge wave appeared, andthis time he did not turn and run but sat andwaited.Out of the wave came the Sea Tsar—per-haps the personification of Lake Il'men'—tothank Sadko for so regally entertaining hisS"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"guests. As a reward, he told Sadko, the verynext day he would be invited to play at abanquet at which some of the richest men ofNovgorod would be present. At this banquetthe rich men would start to boast about theirwealth and their possessions. The Sea Tsartold Sadko that he too should make a boast,stating that he could tell them where to finda fish with golden fins swimming in thewaters of Lake Il'men'.The following day, just as he had beentold, Sadko was invited to play at a magnifi-cent banquet. As the rich men began tobecome drunk, they started to boast. In aloud voice Sadko made the boast he hadbeen told to. When the rich men pouredscorn on Sadko, he challenged the men as hehad been instructed to, wagering his headagainst the men’s shops and merchandise. Sixmen took Sadko up on his wager. Havingprocured a silken net, Sadko led the men tothe shores of Lake Il'men', where he cast thenet three times into the waters, each timehauling it in with a fish with golden finsstruggling in its mesh.The men were obliged to keep their endof the wager, and soon Sadko became one ofthe richest merchants in all Novgorod. Inkeeping with his wealth, Sadko decided tohold a banquet for all the merchants and freemen of the city. As the meal ended, the cus-tomary time came for those present to boast.Sadko was the first to do so, boasting that hehad sufficient wealth to buy up everythingthat was for sale in the city of Novgorod,wagering thirty thousand rubles should hefail to do so. The wager was accepted byFoma Nazariev and Luka Zinoviev, gover-nors of the city.For three days Sadko’s men bought upeverything in the city; but as they cleared theshops and stalls, more goods arrived fromMoscow, and Sadko began to realize the follyof his boast. Thus he settled his wager ofthirty thousand rubles and set sail in a fleet ofthirty boats to sell all the goods he hadbought. He sailed from Novgorod to theRiver Volkhov, and from there to LakeLadoga. From Lake Ladoga the fleet sailed tothe River Neva, and thence across the sea tothe land of the Golden Horde.As Sadko was returning from this long seavoyage, during which he had sold all of hismerchandise and had reloaded his fleet ofships with gold, silver, precious gems, andpearls, the fleet became strangely becalmedon the open sea.Although the sails flapped inthe wind and the waves lapped against the246SADKOOlga Markova-Mikhailenko performs in a KirovOpera production of Sadkoat the Edin Festival inScotland, 1995.

Finally Sadkosuggested that they draw lots and make ahuman sacrifice; but Sadko tried to trick hismen by writing his name on a twig while themen wrote theirs on gold coins. The humansacrifice would be the name that was on thefirst lot to reach the bottom of the sea. Sadkofully expected his lot to float, but to his dis-may it sank while the gold coins floated.Realizing that the Sea Tsar wanted himalone, he called for writing materials so thathe could write his will.Then, having loweredan oak raft into the sea and taking only hisgusliwith him, he bade farewell to his menand was cast adrift. Immediately the shipswere released and sailed off toward Nov-gorod, leaving Sadko alone.Having nothing else to do, Sadko lay backon the raft and quickly fell asleep. When heawoke, he found himself on the seabed closeto a white palace that was the home of theSea Tsar. As soon as the Sea Tsar had chidedSadko for having failed earlier to pay himtribute, he ordered Sadko to play his gusli.AsSadko played, the Sea Tsar began to danceuntil the sea was whipped into a frenzy, caus-ing many people to die. Soon people beganto pray to Saint Nikolai of Mozhaisk, thepatron saint of sailors, also called MikolaMozhaiski, to save them.Beneath the sea Sadko continued to playand the Sea Tsar continued his frenzieddance.As he played, Sadko was confronted byan old man who bade him stop; but Sadkocould not stop, as he was under the spell ofthe Sea Tsar. The old man then instructedSadko to break the strings and the pegs of hisgusliso that it would be impossible to con-tinue playing.This Sadko did, and the stormsabated.Seeing that Sadko could no longer playbecause his guslihad been ruined, the SeaTsar tried another way of keeping Sadko for-ever beneath the sea. He offered him a wifefrom hundreds of beautiful maidens. Asinstructed by the old man, Sadko chose thevery last maiden, a beautiful girl by the nameof Chernava—though some sources namethis maiden as Volkhof—and did not con-summate the marriage but instead fell into adeep sleep.When he awoke, Sadko found himself onthe banks of the river Chernava, his fleet sail-ing toward him down the river Volkhov intoNovgorod. Released from the grip of the SeaTsar, Sadko kept a promise to the old manwho had appeared to him on the ocean bed,and built a cathedral in honor of SaintNikolai of Mozhaisk, in Novgorod, for it hadbeen none other than the saint himself whohad appeared to and had helped Sadko. Thiswas the last time Sadko ever sailed the seas,for he had decided instead to stay safely athome in Novgorod. Some sources say thatSadko not only built a cathedral to SaintNikolai but also built another in honor ofthe Virgin Mary; but this assertion appears tobe a much later addition.An alternative version of events says thatthe storm created when the Sea Tsar dancedto the music of Sadko’s guslisank Sadko’sships, and that when Sadko escaped from theundersea palace he found himself penniless.As a result he had to take work as a bargehand, a job he stayed in for twelve years, eat-ing nothing but bread and salt. Then Sadkodecided that the time had come to returnhome; but recalling the Sea Tsar’s wrath, thistime Sadko remembered to give thanks tothe spirit of the river that had provided hislivelihood for the past twelve years.The riverspirit responded by asking Sadko to take amessage to his brother, the spirit of LakeIl'men'. Sadko agreed and dutifully carriedthe message to the lake. The lake respondedby telling Sadko to take a boat to its centerand to cast out a net three times there.

He cried out to Saint George torescue him, promising to burn an ounce ofincense in his honor. Saint George immedi-ately plucked the fox out of the river and sethim down on the bank beneath a huge rock.There the fox began to complain and beratethe saint for only responding to prayers inreturn for a bribe. However, as he com-plained, the rock began to slide toward him,as though it might crush him.Once more the fox called out to the saintfor help, this time promising to burn one anda half ounces of incense, and again the saintplucked him from the jaws of death. Again, assoon as he had recovered from shock, the foxbegan to complain about the saint, saying thatmartyrdom had done nothing to lift the saintbeyond the enticement of a bribe, and if hewanted incense then he could buy it himself.As he moaned, a group of hunters cameacross the fox and set their dogs on him.This time, when the fox called out toSaint George, the saint stood by and watchedas the dogs set about the fox, and then as thehunters flayed him for his pelt and threw hisbloody carcass away. When the hunters hadleft, Saint George appeared and scolded thefox, saying that as it had broken its oaths, itwould never be a martyr and would dieunabsolved.One of the fables of Vardan of Aygek.See also:George, Saint;VardanSAITE (~VO)LappAlternative names for the sacred sejda stone.SALTYKRussiaIn the legend of Volkh Vseslav'evich, the kingof India who was killed by the hero of the tale.See also:India;Volkh Vseslav'evichSAMOSEK SWORDRussiaA self-cutting sword that was jointly inher-ited by two leshie who lived on a smallisland.

Samson was the sonof a poor, unnamed peasant who saw amaiden in a dream and fell in love with her.At the same time, the maiden, who actuallyexisted, had a dream in which she sawSamson, and she fell in love with him. For awhole month Samson pined for the mysteri-ous maiden he had dreamed of. One day hefell asleep briefly, and when he awoke, he feltimbued with tremendous strength. Feeling soempowered, Samson first went into the vil-lage near his home where he floored an oxwith which several men were struggling bytaking hold of a horn in one hand andpunching it with his other fist.Then Samson went to the local black-smith and had him make a sword weighingthirty litr(a litris an indeterminate weightthat varies between twelve and twentypounds, so this sword might have weighedanywhere between 360 and 600 pounds).Thus armed, Samson set off on foot, andafter many days’ travel met a lone man trav-eling in the opposite direction. After theyhad exchanged the customary greetings, eachwishing the other good health and a longlife, Samson told the man that he was enroute to Anatolia in search of his “dreammaiden.”The man told Samson that he couldnot possibly accomplish the journey on foot.Rather, Samson should buy a bridle andmake his way to the sea.There, under a tree,he would find a fountain. Every evening ahorse that lived beneath the sea came to thefountain to take a drink. While it was thusengaged, Samson should place the bridleover its head, and it would become his.Samson followed this advice to the letter,and snared the horse. At first, the animalthreatened to dash him to death under itshooves, but Samson sat steadfastly on itsback, and before long the horse consented todo Samson’s bidding. Samson told the horseto take him where his heart most desired,249SAMSON"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"and immediately the horse leaped upwardand flew swiftly through the sky until its pathwas blocked by two mountains. The horsetold Samson to strike its belly with his stir-rups, and as he did so, the horse reared upand cleared the peaks, losing only a few hairsfrom its tail. On and on the horse andSamson flew until they came to a magnifi-cent garden where the horse alighted tograze. As Samson sat eating his own meal, agardener came up to him and told him thathe had settled in the private garden of theking of the devils and that he should be gonebefore the king found out.Samson replied that he would welcomethe attention of the king and all his army, andthen gave the gardener a shove. Some timelater the gardener regained consciousnessand ran to his master, who drew his armyaround him and marched toward Samson.Samson saw them coming, drew his sword,mounted his horse, and killed each and everydemon, including the king of the devils him-self.Then Samson flew onward.After several days Samson saw a hugestone slab blocking the entrance to a cave—a cave in which Samson knew his beloved“dream maiden” was captive. Samson had thehorse land, easily moved aside the stone slabthat a hundred normal men could never havehoped to move even a fraction of an inch,and entered the cave. There, seated on a car-pet, he saw his “dream maiden,” and he knewthat his journey had come to an end. Thetwo embraced, and the maiden told Samsonthat her name was Gulinaz (a Persian namedenoting a young rose), adding that she hadbeen carried off and imprisoned in that caveby Tapagöz.Samson had never heard of Tapagöz,though Gulinaz actually refers to this crea-ture as aTapagöz, rather than theTapagöz,signifying that there was a race of giants andher captor was just one example of that race.Gulinaz told Samson how he might kill theTapagöz, and then she asked her beloved toreplace the stone slab and hide in the cave.Asnight fell, the ground began to shake, andpeeping out from his hiding place, Samsonsaw the Tapagöz returning, driving a mixedflock of bison, sheep, cows, and oxen in frontof him, using an uprooted tree as his staff.The Tapagöz entered the cave, made a vastmeal of the animals he had driven beforehim, and then went to sleep. As his snoresfilled the cave, Samson crept out and wasamazed by the size of the Tapagöz. Samsonestimated that his head weighed fifty poods,his nose fifteen poods, and each toothbetween four and five poods.Taking the spitfrom the Tapagöz’s fire, Samson climbed ontothe giant’s nose, and gathering all hisstrength, thrust the point of the spit into thesingle eye in the middle of the Tapagöz’sforehead. With a mighty sigh, the giantkeeled over and died.Setting out on the back of Samson’s fly-ing horse, Samson and Gulinaz flew for sev-eral days until they alighted in a beautifulpalace garden. While Samson and Gulinazrested in the shade of a tree and the horsefed on the lush grass, a gardener discoveredthem and asked them what they thoughtthey were doing. Samson calmly replied thathe was the one who would put out the eyeof the gardener and the king. The gardenerhurried to the king and gave him the mes-sage. Worried, the king called for his lala(aTurkish tutor or servant that has charge of ayoung prince or gentleman). The lalasug-gested that the young man’s anger had beenbrought about by hunger, so the king hadthe lalatake the young man and the younglady some food. Samson responded by draw-ing fifteen camels laden with gold on a pieceof paper, and he sent the picture back to theking with the lala.The king realized that the young man wasdemanding fifteen camels laden with gold inexchange for leaving the palace gardens. Heresponded by sending his lalaback with twoeggs, signifying that he would put out theyoung man’s eyes for being so insolent.Samson responded by sending the lalabackwith two walnuts to show that he was as harda nut to crack.250SAMSON"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Knowing that he was being toyed with,the king sent the lalaback with a handful ofgrain. Samson knew this meant that the kinghad an army as numerous as grains of wheat.Thus he responded by sending the lalabackwith a chicken, to show that no matter howlarge the army was, this chicken would soongobble them up. Seeing that reasoning washopeless, the king assembled his army andmarched out to do battle with the impudentyoung man.Samson saw the army approaching.Takingup his sword, he leaped onto his horse andcompletely decimated the unfortunate sol-diers. Seeing his army dead on the battle-field, the king summoned three demons thatlived within his kingdom and sent themagainst Samson. Within minutes the threedemons lay dead; so the king assembled allhis advisers and asked them how he mightovercome or escape this violent youth.One of these counselors advised the kingto consult a local sorcerer.The king immedi-ately summoned the sorcerer, who divinedthe situation and told the king that theyoung man had slain the Tapagöz and res-cued the daughter of King Aslan. When theking heard this, he sent thirty camels ladenwith gold to Samson, and news to KingAslan of the safe return of his daughter. KingAslan hurried to the palace and was reunitedwith his daughter.

The root of Semik is sem',which associates the festival with the wordsfor “seed,”“sperm,”“family,” and “seven.”Thefestival was celebrated on the seventhThursday after Easter, and was immediatelypreceded by a ritual called kumstvo. Duringthis prelude, a birch tree known as the“Semik Birch” would be dressed with rib-bons like a goddess to preside over the com-ing festivities. This ritual and others weredesigned to confirm the unity of the com-munity and reconfirm its link with deceasedancestors and the society of the past. Younggirls were central to kumstvo, during whichthey would wear garlands woven from birchtwigs, representing their fertility, which theywould retain unsullied until they married.The girls would embrace, signifying the sol-idarity of the village, and pledge their eternalblood ties. These rituals of kumstvo com-pleted, the festival of Semik could begin.Once the kumstvo was completed, thebirch tree would be cut down and broughtinto the village, where its boughs would beused to decorate every house. Then the treewould be feasted as a goddess of the dead.Then, having been well fed, the tree would becarried down to the banks of a local riverwhere it would be ceremonially “undressed”and cast into the water to drown. During thistime the unmarried women of the villagewould select their future husbands, and havingdone so, would cast their birch-branch gar-lands into the water. If a garland sank, its ownerwas fated to die; but if it floated, she wouldmarry, be happy, and bear healthy children.Semik lasted two days, Thursday andFriday, and was followed by Troitsa, which atthat time was celebrated on Saturday.See also:Kumstvo; Rusaliia;TroitsaReferences:Afanas'ev 1865–69; Propp 1963;Rimsky-Korsakov 1951; Zemtsovskii 1970SENMURVSlavAlternative name for the Simorg.SERAPIONRussiaHistorical thirteenth-century bishop of Vla-dimir who vociferously denounced womenfor clinging to pagan beliefs, calling themwitches.

The word means “one who isexcited” or “one who is exalted.” The priestor priestess on whom the title was bestowedwas said to have the power of entering thespirit world at will and to bring its denizensunder his or her command. In someinstances the journey of the shaman is sym-bolized by his climbing a tree or a ladder, asymbology that connects the rites of theshaman to the World Tree. In others he or sheis spoken of as flying, usually in bird form, orriding on a magical horse.The shaman is alsobelieved to have the ability, like the gods heor she could communicate with, to send hisor her spirit out at will to summon otherspirits and to exorcise those who caused ill-ness or other harm.Though in certain cases the role ofshaman might be inherited from genera-tion to generation, the shaman was usually“chosen” by a spirit that would inhabit thebody of the unwilling individual until itcould be driven out. While the spirit waswithin its host, that person would take toliving in the woods, until at length he orshe underwent an ecstatic enlightenmentduring which the secrets of the universewere revealed. These individuals then ac-cepted their particular roles in life andacknowledged their spirit aids.

Thus, the act of cutting down atree was fraught with danger, lest one fellthe Tree of Life. To alleviate this danger, anelaborate ritual was performed, propitiatingSimorg, who in response would ensure thesafety of the tree.Often mentioned alongside the goddessMokosh, Simorg was described as the pro-tector of the home and the family and hasbeen linked with the ancient Sumerian god-dess Ishtar.

The Slavic languagegroup with its many dialects is a part of theIndo-European language family and can bedivided into three linguistic subgroups: theEast Slavic branch, consisting of Russian,Belorussian, and Ukrainian; the West Slavicbranch, including Polish, Czech, and Slovak;and the South Slavic branch, includingSlovenian, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, andBulgarian.The early Slavs were farmers and herdersliving in the marshes and woodlands of whatis now eastern Poland and western Russia,Belorussia, and Ukraine. From about A.D.150 the Slavs began to expand in all direc-tions. To the north they followed the riversthrough the forests of Russia, occupying ter-ritory populated by Finnish and Baltic peo-ples, many of whom they absorbed. To thewest they encountered Germanic and Celticgroups as they occupied much of centralEurope. By the seventh century the Slavs hadreached as far south as the Adriatic andAegean Seas. During the next two centuriesthey settled in most of the Balkan Peninsula,then part of the Byzantine Empire, dislocat-ing indigenous populations or slavicizingnewcomers, such as the Bulgarians. To theeast, by the end of the sixteenth century, theRussians had already secured a permanentfoothold beyond the Ural Mountains in Asia;and by the nineteenth century, Slavic culturehad reached the Pacific Ocean.Whereas the ancient Slavs probablyexhibited considerable racial and culturalhomogeneity, the modern Slavic peoples areunited mainly by their linguistic affinity anda sense of common origins.

The Slavs quickly becamethe focus of intense rivalry between RomanCatholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Cathol-icism and Western culture triumphed amongthe Poles, Slovaks, and Czechs; later, howev-er, the Czechs were significantly affected bythe Reformation, and because of this, theyare today the only Slavic people with a largeProtestant minority. In the Balkans, theSlovenes and Croats also gave their allegianceto Roman Catholicism and fell into thesphere of central European civilization.Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians, and a major-ity of the Eastern Slavs (Belorussians,Russians, Ukrainians) joined the OrthodoxChurch and adopted many aspects ofByzantine culture, including an adaptation ofthe Greek alphabet—what is known today asthe Cyrillic alphabet.During the fourteenth century theOttoman Turks conquered much of south-eastern Europe. Parts of what are now Bosniaand Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the for-mer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbiaand Montenegro, and Slovenia remainedunder Ottoman rule until 1912. Centuries ofTurkish domination had a profound effecton the Balkan Slavs, many of whom wereforced to convert to Islam. Today the major-ity of Slavic Muslims are in Bosnia andsouthern Bulgaria.Although the Slavs created a number ofmedieval kingdoms between the ninth andthe eleventh centuries, much of their subse-quent history was characterized by subjuga-tion within foreign states. The present Slavicnations are to a great extent the results of thedissolution of the Austro-Hungarian andOttoman Empires following World War I.With the exception of the Czechs, the Slavsremained a predominantly agrarian peopleuntil the mid-twentieth century. After WorldWar II most of the Slavic nations came underthe Soviet sphere of influence, and theirMarxist governments embarked on ambi-tious programs of industrialization andurbanization. In the late 1980s and early1990s, with the breakdown of the SovietUnion, the various East European nationsmoved toward setting up independentdemocratic governments. In some areas, par-ticularly the former Yugoslavia, this transitionignited conflict among Slavs of differentnational and religious groups.See also:Belorussia; Bosnia; Bulgaria;Byzantine Empire; Croatia; Cyrillic alphabet;Czechs; Herzegovina; Macedonia;Montenegro; Poland; Russia; Serbia; Slovakia;Slovenia; Ukraine; Ural MountainsSLOVAKIAGeneralA newly independent country in centralEurope that is bordered by Poland to thenorth, Ukraine to the east, Hungary to thesouth, and Austria and the Czech Republicto the west.

In A.D. 623, the chieftain FrankoSamo created the first independent Slovenestate, which stretched from Lake Balaton(now located in Hungary) to the Med-iterranean. It lasted until late in the eighthcentury, when the region became part ofthe Frankish Empire. In the tenth century itwas reorganized as the duchy of Carantaniaby Holy Roman Emperor Otto I. From1335 until 1918, except for a brief interludefrom 1809 to 1814, Slovenes were governedby the Habsburgs of the Austro-HungarianEmpire in the Austrian crown lands ofKärnten (Carinthia), Carniola, and Steier-mark (Styria), except for a minority in therepublic of Venice. During the NapoleonicWars, the region was taken from Austria byFrance and reorganized as the IllyrianProvinces from 1809 to 1814.

The stepmother flew into a terriblerage and made the unfortunate girl climbdown the well to fetch it.The girl climbed over the lip of the welland dropped into the water, where shesank to the bottom. There she saw a door,which she opened, and walked into abeautiful garden, where all the flowerswere in full bloom and the sun shone in abrilliant blue sky, even though the villageshe had left had been gray and wet. Rightin the middle of the garden was a smallhouse, and standing in the doorway was awoman dressed all in white. The girl askedthis woman if she had seen her bucket.Thewoman replied that she had, and if the girlwanted it back she would have to work toearn its return.The girl agreed, as it did not matter toher where she worked, and she settled downto do the chores the old woman assignedher. One of these was to shake the oldwoman’s mattress. While she was shakingthe mattress, she looked out the windowand saw her home and the well in her gar-den. All around the snow was falling, andthe people of the village seemed pleased tosee it settling on the ground. The oldwoman walked into the room and saw thepuzzled expression on the girl’s face. Sheexplained that she was Granny Snowstorm;and each year, if she was pleased, she sent ahard winter so that the following yearwould produce a good harvest, the snowensuring the fertility of the soil.Three weeks passed, and the young girlworked for Granny Snowstorm and com-pletely forgot about her real home.However, one night she dreamed that herfather was grieving for her, and the follow-ing morning she asked Granny Snowstormif she might take her bucket and go home.Though she was sad to see the young girlleave her, Granny Snowstorm said shecould go, and gave the girl her bucket,which she had filled with gold coins. Theyoung girl climbed back up the well andwas reunited with her father, much to thechagrin of her stepmother, who hadthought the girl gone for good. She was sojealous of the young girl’s good fortunethat the very next morning she decidedthat her own daughter should descend intothe well so that she too might return witha bucket of gold.Deliberately dropping the bucket downthe well, the old woman’s daughter climbeddown and was soon in the employment ofGranny Snowstorm. However, the girl didnot know how to do any of the householdchores she was assigned, and GrannySnowstorm grew increasingly tired of her.After just a few days, she told the girl thatshe could go. The girl asked to be paid forthe work she had done, though in fact shehad not done any—whereupon GrannySnowstorm took her to a storeroom full ofgold, silver, diamonds, and pearls. The girltook her bucket and started to fill it, thenstopped and asked Granny Snowstormwhat was the most valuable thing in theroom. Granny Snowstorm told her that itwas a single, immense pearl. The girl emp-tied her bucket and put the pearl in it.Thenshe climbed back up the well, took thepearl out of the bucket, and ran to showher mother and all the people in the vil-lage. However, as she ran the pearl began tomelt: It was nothing more than a largesnowball.From that day on the woman’s daughterwas the laughingstock of the village.The oldman’s daughter, on the other hand, was soonbeing courted by the son of a nobleman; andas the village gathered in the harvest, thecouple married—the riches of GrannySnowstorm acting as the young girl’s dowry.See also:Mother EarthReferences:Oparenko 1996SOLOVEI (~Y) RAKHMATICHRussiaThe name literally means “Nightingale, Sonof Rakhmat.” This brigand was described ashalf man, half bird.See also:Nightingale; Rakhmat262SOLOVEI (~Y) RAKHMATICH"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"SOPHIA, SAINTRussiaThe patron saint of a great number ofchurches throughout Russia, notably thegreat cathedral in Kiev where a sixteen-foot-high image of the Mother of God, with herarms upraised in a strikingly pagan gesture,hangs over the altar.

WhenSukhman asked the river the meaning ofthis, the river replied that a Tatar army someforty thousand strong was camped upstreamand continually tried to build bridges acrossthe river, and that she had used up almost allof her strength washing these bridges away.Sukhman realized that if the Tatar armymanaged to cross the river, then Kiev wouldbe lost. Goading his horse into an enormousleap, he cleared the river in a single bound.There he uprooted a huge tree—said insome accounts to have weighed ninety poods(a pood roughly equals 36 lbs or 16.38 kg),which he wielded as a huge club as he deci-mated the Tatar army, killing all but threewarriors.

As paganism was for-gotten, the sun had become connected withdeath, as had the moon. Russians wouldalways try to bury their dead just before sun-set so that the sun on its downward journeymight carry away the departing soul.One Russian folktale describes the sun as abeautiful maiden with wings like an angel.This story says that a peasant once came to acottage at the end of the world, where theearth and the sky meet. He asked whether hecould stay the night. Welcomed into thehouse, he retired before sunset but awoke inthe night, hearing the old woman talking toher daughter. Peering through a crack in thecurtain, he saw the maiden sitting at the tableeating her supper, her dress radiating a brilliantlight that warmed the room. After her meal,the girl hung up her dress and her mothercovered it with a thick cloth, and darknessimmediately fell. The following morning themaiden put on her dress and left the house,and as she did so, the night became day.In other Russian folktales the Sun marrieshuman girls, while in others he either warmsmen who have honored him or tries to scorchmen who have offended him. In one suchstory (see Morozko) he appears as a chubbyman with rosy cheeks. However, stories of thewitch Baba-Yaga say that the Sun is under hercommand, along with Day and Night, and inthese stories the Sun is described as a scarlethorseman, dressed from head to foot in thatcolor and riding a scarlet stallion. He starts hisjourney from Baba-Yaga’s cottage, and returnsthere when his day’s work is done.Lithuanian legend held that at the end ofthe Sun’s daily journey across the sky, hewould travel from west to east in a boat acrossthe night sky in order to be ready for the fol-lowing day’s journey. Other Lithuanian leg-ends assign a feminine gender to Sun, namingSaule as the sun goddess. Others still say thatthe new sun was forged every morning bythe divine smith Kalvaitis.On the Baltic coast, the god of the sunremains unnamed but is said to be the off-spring of Svantovit. This bears comparisonwith the Lithuanian sun goddess Saule, whoin this context might be seen as the daugh-ter of Svantovit.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Day;Dazhbog; Kalvaitis; Lithuania; Moon;Morozko; Night; Saule; Svantovit (~dovit)SUN’S SISTERRussiaGiven no specific name, Sun’s Sister appearsin the story of Ivan the Mute, which tellshow she helped the young tsarevich escapefrom the cannibalistic clutches of his sister, afearsome witch.

Surentraveled for some time until he came to atumbledown house where he found an old,blind couple. The couple marveled that hehad managed to make his way to their homepast the three vicious vishaps (dragons) thatlived in the area and kept all the local peopleprisoner so that they could eat them one byone. Only the old couple remained freebecause they milked the goats and sheepbelonging to the dragons. The dragons hadplucked out their eyes and hidden them sothat they would not run away.Suren said he would live with and helpthe old couple, who immediately adoptedhim as their own. From that day on, Surenled the sheep and the goats out to pastureevery day and brought them home again inthe evening. One day, while sitting in theshade of a tree, Suren saw a huge lionapproaching. He leaped to his feet, club inhand, ready to protect the sheep and goats.The lion, however, spoke to Suren, tellinghim that he meant no harm and that he hadcome to Suren only to give him two lioncubs, which he did, and then departed. Thecubs grew in one day as much as a normallion would grow in a month. Within fifteendays, they had grown into enormous, maturelions. Suren called the two lions Zangi, or“Blackie,” and Zarangi, or “Goldie.”One day, while Suren, Zangi, and Zarangiwere sitting in the shade of a tree watchingthe sheep and goats, Zangi and Zarangi sud-denly leaped to their feet and ran off towarda huge shape that was slithering toward thetree. Suren rightly guessed that this was oneof the three vishaps that were holding thepeople captive. The dragon spoke to Suren,asking him to call off his lions, as she meantthe youth no harm and had a favor to ask.Suren called to Zangi and Zarangi, who set-tled down beside their young master, whileremaining poised to spring into actionshould the need arise.The dragon asked Suren if he would bekind enough to comb her mane and look fornits. Suren, suspecting a trick—for thedragon had hunger in her eyes—said that hewould, and he invited her to join him underthe tree. Placing the dragon’s head on hisknee, Suren pretended to search for nitswhile the dragon lay there sharpening herteeth. In reality, however, Suren was tying thedragon’s mane to the tree.When he was surethat the dragon could not jump after him,Suren got up and said that he had to fetch agoat that was wandering away.The dragon lethim go, and then tried to spring after him,only to find herself unable to.Suren gathered up the goat that wasindeed about to wander, and then stood ashort distance from the dragon, whichseemed perplexed as to why Suren had tiedher to the tree. Suren told the dragon that hewould let her go if she told him where sheand her sisters had hidden the eyes of hisadoptive parents.The dragon told Suren thatshe could not, for her big sister held the key.Hearing this, Suren set Zangi and Zarangion the dragon with the command that notone drop of her blood should fall to theground. Zangi and Zarangi tore the dragonto pieces, and within minutes there was noevidence that she had ever existed.Several days passed before Suren saw thesecond dragon coming his way. This dragon,too, asked Suren to check her mane for nits,and Suren tied her to the tree. Once morethe young man gathered up a goat that wasabout to stray and then asked this dragon forthe eyes of his adoptive parents. When thedragon replied that her little sister had thekey, Suren told her that her little sister was nomore, whereupon the dragon told Suren thather big sister held the key. Suren then setZangi and Zarangi on the dragon, andwithin minutes there was nothing left ofher—not so much as a single drop of blood.Two months passed before Suren encoun-tered the third dragon. She was so large thather form blocked the light of the sun, andthe earth trembled as she walked.

Before long hecame to two huge buildings. In the first hefound two small caskets, and unlocking thesewith the smaller two of the three keys, heremoved the eyes of his adoptive parents.Then he went to the other building andfreed all the people, who immediatelyelected Suren to become their new ruler,their true king having been one of the firsteaten by the dragons. Suren accepted theiroffer, but said that he had a couple of othermatters to attend to first. When these taskshad been completed, he would return.First Suren returned to his adoptive par-ents and restored their eyesight.Then he setout for his true home village, wonderingwhat had become of his real parents and hislittle sister. He took along a single hair fromeach of his two lions. It did not take manydays to ride back to his old home village;but when he arrived, he found it deserted.Remembering where he had once lived,Suren made his way to the house of histrue parents, and after stabling his horse,went in.There, in front of the stove, was hissister Koknas, who had become a ghovt, orshe-devil.Koknas turned around as Suren enteredthe house, and greeted her long-lost brother,asking him if he had come on horseback.When Suren said that he had, his sister toldhim to sit by the stove and warm himselfwhile she went to feed his horse. In the sta-bles Koknas tore off one of the horse’s legsand ate it. She then returned to the houseand asked Suren if he had really ridden ahorse with just three legs. When he repliedthat he had, Koknas returned to the stable,tore the remaining three legs from the horse,and ate them. Returning once more to thehouse, Koknas asked Suren if he had riddenon a horse with no legs. Suren knew whatwas going on, and replied that he had.Koknas returned to the stable and devouredwhat was left of the horse before returningto the house and asking her brother if he hadwalked.Suren said that he had; then, saying that hehad to stretch his legs, Suren went out of thehouse, locked the door behind him, andclimbed up onto the roof, where he pon-dered his predicament—for he knew that hissister surely intended to eat him next. Surendevised a plan and removed his trousers. Hethen tied the bottom of each leg and filledthem with handfuls of ashes scooped fromthe chimney. So stuffed, he dangled thetrousers down through the skylight.When Koknas found the door locked, sheknew that she could get out of the housethrough the skylight. When she walked overto the skylight, she saw the stuffed trouserlegs dangling. Thinking these to be Suren,she leaped up and took them in her teeth,whereupon they exploded in a shower ofashes that left Koknas reeling, coughing, andgagging. Furious, Koknas started to breakdown the locked door; but as she did so,Suren took the hairs of Zangi and Zarangifrom his pocket, and as soon as he did so, hislions appeared beside him. Then, as Koknasfinally managed to hack the door down,Zangi and Zarangi leaped on her, and withinseconds all that was left of the ghovt was asingle drop of blood on the ground.Suren cleaned up the blood with hishandkerchief, and then, with Zangi andZarangi by his side, he set off to return tothe city he was due to become the ruler of.En route he came across a group of people270SUREN"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"gathered around a log that was filled withgold.When he asked what they were doing,Suren was told that the gold could bereleased from the log only if the name of thetree could be guessed.

Thistime when the log was struck, it split openand the gold spilled out, for the tree was theyellow fir, or Köknar(the Turkish name forthe yellow fir).Thus, when Suren finally arrived at hisnew home city, exhausted from his travels, hewas able to restore the inhabitants’ fortunes.The people then chose Suren the most beau-tiful maiden in the city to become his wife,and Suren settled down to rule the city, hisfaithful lions Zangi and Zarangi ensuring itssafety from attack.See also:Dragon; Ghovt; Koknas;Vishap;Zangi; ZarangiReferences:Orbeli and Taronian 1959–67,vol. 4SVANTOVIT (~DOVIT)Baltic CoastAlso:Sventovit, Iarovit (“wrath”), Porevit(“power”), Rujevit (“rutting time”),Triglav“Energy,” the principal deity of the peoplesinhabiting the Baltic coastal districts, con-troller of the fertility of the world, lord ofprophecy and war, god of gods and father ofall gods, particularly Sun and Fire. His chieftemple was at Arcona, with another on theisland of Riigen containing a statue someeight meters high, depicting Svantovit infour aspects, one for each cardinal point, ona carved wooden pillar.The god held a bull’shorn cup in his right hand that was annuallyfilled with wine, which would seep away orevaporate. The amount left in the cup at theend of the year was believed to portend thecoming year’s prosperity. No wine left in thecup spelled disaster.A white stallion, sacred to Svantovit, waskept in his temple, and beside his statue hungits saddle and bridle along with Svantovit’ssword and war banner. The stallion, like thewine, was a means of divination, beingdriven by the god’s priests through a twistingcourse made up of spears stuck into theground.The forecast for the coming year wasgood if the horse did not disturb any of thespears, but bad if any spears were dislodged—the degree of bad luck depending on thenumber of spears uprooted. The statue andinner shrines of Svantovit’s temple were sosacred that they were guarded day and night,and even the high priests—who were theonly people ever to be allowed past thearmed guards—had to hold their breathwhile inside.Early chroniclers, such as Saxo Gram-maticus, are the only sources of testimonyregarding the cult of Svantovit, and theinformation they provide is sketchy at best.Similar deities—Radigast, Rugevit, and Ya-rilo—also are described in these early texts.While each has attributes like Svantovit’s,they are all plainly different, and might beunderstood as the various, contrasting aspectsof Svantovit.One statue of Svantovit, discovered in thenineteenth century near the river Zbrucz onthe Russo-Galician border, shows an aspectthat appears female, having breasts. No otherstatue of the god with this aspect has beendiscovered; and it may well be that this was alater representation of the deity designed toshow acceptance, or at least tolerance, ofwomen within the god’s sanctuary.See also:Arcona; Baltic; Iarovit; Porevik (~it);Radigast; Rugavit (~ievit); Rujevit; SaxoGrammaticus; Sun;Triglav;YariloReferences:Grammaticus 1886SVAREVICHIRussiaA group of deities identified as the sons ofSvarog.

In the first, hisstrength was put to the test by Il'ya Muromets,who rode to the Holy Mountains to find thegiant, for he had heard that Sviatogor was oneof the mightiest of men.As he neared the Holy Mountains, Il'yaMuromets saw a huge man, larger than anyhe had ever seen before, riding toward him.Realizing at once that this was the giantSviatogor, Il'ya spurred on his horse andstruck the giant a mighty blow with his hugemace. Sviatogor did not even wince and rodelazily on. Again Il'ya struck him, and againthe giant did not even flinch.The third timeIl'ya struck, however, the giant jerked uprightin his saddle. Seeing who had hit him, hedeftly picked Il'ya up by the hair anddropped him into his pouch.272SVAROG"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Some time later, Sviatogor’s horse stum-bled and complained that carrying twoknights was too much, even for him.Sviatogor took Il'ya out of his pouch, andseeing that he was a knight of Holy Russia,suggested that the two of them ride togetheras brothers.This they did for many days, untilthey came to a huge stone coffin lying besidea tree.Il'ya leaped off his horse and lay down inthe coffin. It was much too large for him,but it fit Sviatogor perfectly. Even thoughIl'ya Muromets pleaded with him not to putthe lid on, Sviatogor did just that. However,when he asked Il'ya to remove the lid, Il'yafound it far too heavy. Three times he hit itwith his mace, but each time he hit it a steelband closed around the coffin, securing thelid.Sviatogor blew some of his strength intoIl'ya so that he could use the giant’s ownsword; but this just made matters worse, fortwo steel bands closed around the coffinevery time it was hit with the sword.Resigning himself to his fate, Sviatogor hadIl'ya tie his horse to the tree, to die therebeside its master. Il'ya did as asked and sadlyrode away from the coffin, knowing thatSviatogor, the last of the giants, would shortly be no more.The second account of Sviatogor’s demiseis possibly the older of the two: Sviatogoroften boasted of his great strength, going sofar as to say that he could even lift MotherEarth. One day while he was out riding, hecame across a small bag lying in his path.Unable to move it with the tip of his staff,Sviatogor dismounted, and with tremendouseffort, managed to raise the bag as high as hisknees. In doing so, he sweated so heavily thathis sweat became blood. Sinking deep intothe earth under the weight of the bag, hecould not save himself.Interestingly, there is a further legend con-cerning Sviatogor and his attempt to liftMother Earth. In this story, Sviatogor is outriding, trying to find a means by which totest his great strength. While riding, he spotsa stranger carrying a small bag slung over oneshoulder; but no matter how hard he spurshis mount, he cannot catch up with thestranger. Finally, Sviatogor calls out to thestranger, who stops and waits for the giant tocatch up.When the two finally meet, Sviatogor asksthe stranger where he is going in such ahurry and what he is carrying. The strangerplaces the bag on the ground and tellsSviatogor that if he wants to see what is inthe bag, he should lift it up and take a look.Sviatogor accepts the challenge, climbs downfrom his horse, and takes hold of the bag.However, no matter how hard Sviatogorstrains, he cannot move the bag even a frac-tion of an inch. Sviatogor admits defeat andasks the stranger what is in the bag. Thestranger replies that the bag contains theweight of the world.Sviatogor is impressed and asks thestranger his name. The stranger replies thathis name is Mikulushka Selyaninovich butthat most people call him Mikula. Sviatogorhas heard of Mikula, and asks him how hemight learn his fate. Mikula tells the giant toride to the Northern Mountains, and thereunder the tallest tree he will find a smithywhere the blacksmith will tell him all thatwill come to be.Sviatogor thanks Mikula and rides as hardas he can toward the Northern Mountains.When he reaches the mountains, he finds theblacksmith hard at work in his smithy, forg-ing two thin hairs. Sviatogor asks him whathe is doing, and the smith replies that he isforging the fates of all those destined tomarry. Interested, Sviatogor asks whom he isdestined to wed; but the reply he receives isnot what he expects.The smith tells him thathis bride lives in the Kingdom by the Sea,dwelling in the City of the King, where shehas lain for the past thirty years on adunghill.Although he is disgusted by the thought,Sviatogor quickly seeks out the woman fatehas decreed he will marry.

Finding the money on the table, shequickly sets herself up as a merchant andamasses a great fortune, sailing all over thethen-known world, trading as she goes.Finally her ships land at the edge of the HolyMountains, and Sviatogor comes to see thewoman that everyone is talking about.

It is then that Sviatogorrealizes that this is the woman he was des-tined to marry and that there is no way ofavoiding the fate decreed by God.Later accounts seem to confuse the rela-tionship between Sviatogor and Il'ya Mu-romyets, tending to make the two one and thesame—Sviatogor being the pre-Christian per-sonification, and the bogatyr' the post-Christian one.

Perhaps it wasone of the six brothers of the Tapagöz killedby Aslan. If this is the case, then it is safe toassume that Tapagöz was a family namerather than a personal one. TheTapagöz in the legend of Aslan andSimizar had three heads, but that inthe legend of Samson and Gulinazhad just one. Both had a commonattribute, however: a single eye in the cen-ter of the head. One need only put outthat eye to kill the giant.

The Teutonic Knights wereorganized for service in the Holy Land, andmodeled their organization after two earliercrusading orders—the Knights Templars andthe Knights Hospitalers. In the thirteenthcentury the Teutonic Knights shifted theiractivities to central Europe, where they triedto convert and control the people in thelands that later became known as Prussia,Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. In the four-teenth century the Teutonic Knights lostmuch of their power, and finally the Polesand Lithuanians overthrew them. In 1525,the Grand Master, Albert of Hohenzollern,became a Protestant and changed the orderfrom a religious to a civic organization; andin 1618 the order’s territory passed to theHohenzollern elector of Brandenburg.See also:Estonia; Latvia; Lithuania; PrussiaTHIRD ALMAFIHungary—MagyarSee:Almafi.THRICE-NINTH KINGDOM, THERussiaAn unidentified kingdom that according tosome sources was (at least partly) the land ofTsar Afron.

During his travels he stopped in a largefield that belonged to a seven-headeddragon. Instead of showing his fear of themonster,Tobias challenged the dragon to seewhat they could squeeze out of a rock. Thedragon went first and quickly reduced a largerock to dust. Tobias then bent down to pickup a rock, and with his back turned towardthe dragon, swapped it for a lump of cheesehe had in his pocket. Thus, when Tobiassqueezed the “rock,” whey ran out of it.Thedragon was so impressed that he suggestedthat the two become friends. Tobias agreedon condition that the dragon treat him as hiselder brother.Thus the two set off across the fieldtoward a cherry tree. There, as Tobias di-rected, the dragon held down the tree so thathis elder brother might eat his fill. WhenTobias could eat no more, he said that hewould hold the tree down for the dragon;but when the dragon let go of the tree,Tobiaswas naturally catapulted through the air andlanded in the middle of a large bush underwhich a hare was hiding. Before the harecould run away, Tobias took hold of it andheld it up, saying that he had seen the harehiding and had leaped over the cherry tree inorder to catch it.The dragon was so impressed that heinvited Tobias to return with him to meet hisfamily. Shortly thereafter Tobias and thedragon entered the dragons’ village, and hewas soon presented to the dragon’s mother,father, and two brothers. When the dragonexplained to his family just what Tobiascould do, they immediately invited him tostay, and from that day forth Tobias did littlemore than eat and sleep. The dragons toler-ated their guest’s indolence for a short while,and then one day they said that it was Tobias’sturn to fetch water in the family’s hugebucket made of the skins of twelve oxen.Tricking the dragon into carrying thehuge bucket,Tobias went to the well, pickedup a spade, and immediately began to dig atrench around the well. When the dragonasked what he was doing, Tobias replied thathe was going to take the well back withthem so that they no longer had to fetch andcarry their water.The dragon was alarmed, asthe well served the whole village, and so hequickly filled the huge bucket and carriedthe water back home.The following day the mother dragonasked Tobias to fetch firewood from the for-est. Tobias went down to the forest with hisdragon brother. There he wove a rope andbegan to stretch it around the whole forest.When the dragon asked what he was doing,Tobias replied that he intended to take theentire forest home so that they no longer hadto fetch and carry their firewood.The dragonwas horrified, as the forest supplied the needsof seven villages of dragons; so he quicklypulled up enough trees to serve theirrequirements and hurried home with them.When they arrived home, the motherdragon was furious to see that her son was280TOAD, DR."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"again doing the work Tobias had been askedto do.

There, of course, the dragoncould hardly move, let alone swing his club,whereas Tobias set about the dragon withease and soon had him begging for mercy.Having won the fight, and with one bar-rel of gold already secured,Tobias thought hewas safe. However, the dragon now suggesteda sneezing competition, again offering a bar-rel of gold to Tobias if he won, and again say-ing that if he lost, Tobias must go home.Tobias agreed, and they went indoors. Thedragon sneezed first and blew Tobias allaround the room. Picking himself up, Tobiaswent around the walls and started to plug upany holes he found. When the dragon askedwhat he was doing, Tobias said that if he didnot plug up the holes the house would notcollapse, and if the house did not collapse, thedragon would not be certain who hadsneezed the best.The dragon was horrified, begged Tobiasnot to sneeze, and gave him the second bar-rel of gold. Still determined to beat Tobias,the dragon then suggested a shouting com-petition.

The dragon was only too happyto oblige, so that he could finally be rid ofTobias. Thus it was that Tobias rode thedragon home like a horse. At the gate toTobias’s house the dragon made its farewellsand set off for home. En route he came acrossa fox that was rolling on the ground laughing.When the dragon asked what was so funny,the fox told him that he was laughing at thedragon-horse he had seen the human riding.The dragon was furious and asked the foxwhat he might do to retrieve the three bar-rels of gold.The fox brokered a bargain withthe dragon, saying that he would help inreturn for a cock and nine hens; and the twoset off toward Tobias’s house.Tobias saw themcoming and shouted to the fox in an angryvoice, saying that he had been promised ninedragon skins, so why had the fox broughthim just one?

The Ukrainian lan-guage is a member of the Slavic branch ofthe Indo-European family and is closelyrelated to Russian.During the ninth century A.D., Kievbecame the center of a Slavic state referredto as Kievan Rus'. In the fourteenth century,most of Ukraine came under Polish andLithuanian control. Cossacks freed that por-tion of Ukraine from Polish rule in 1648(eastern Ukraine was absorbed by Russia in1667) and liberated the remainder of thecountry from Austrian rule in 1793.In 1923, Ukraine became a constituentrepublic of the Soviet Union and wasrenamed the Ukrainian Soviet SocialistRepublic. In 1991, Ukraine declared itspolitical independence, and later that year,after the breakup of the Soviet Union,received diplomatic recognition as an inde-pendent country.Human settlement in Ukraine beganalmost 300,000 years ago. By about 1500 B.C.,nomadic herders, including the warlike,horse-riding Cimmerians, occupied theregion. The Scythians conquered the Cim-merians about 700 B.C., and between 700 and600 B.C., Greek colonies appearedon the northern coast of the BlackSea, although the Scythians con-trolled most of the region until c. 200B.C., when it fell to the Sarmatians.The region was invaded by Ger-manic tribes from the west in A.D.270 and by the Huns in 375.During the ninth century a Slaviccivilization called Rus' sprang up aroundKiev, the resultant East Slavic state beingknown as Kievan Rus'. Scandinavian mer-chant-warriors known as Varangians, orVikings, played an important role in organiz-ing the East Slavic tribes into the Kievan state.Vladimir I, the ruler of Novgorod, con-quered Kievan Rus' in 980, and under hisrule the state became a political, economic,and cultural power in Europe. In 988,Vladimir became a Christian and madeChristianity the state religion. In 1240,Tatarsswept across the Ukrainian plains from theeast and conquered the region. After the fallof Kievan Rus', several principalities emergedin the region. The state of Galicia-Volhynia,in what is now western Ukraine, grew inimportance.

(TheMuseum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive)V"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"The origin of the vampire myth isobscure, but it may come from ancient BlackSea beliefs about ghosts that were persuadedto return from the underworld by pouringwarm blood onto the ground. These ghoststhen required fresh blood if they were to bekept from returning to the underworld—atrait that was to follow through to the leg-ends of corpses rising from their graves tosuck the blood of the living and thus to savethem from the corruption of death. Duringthe sixteenth century a belief arose thatvampires were the spirits of suicide victimsand could only be killed if they wereexposed to daylight, or stabbed through theheart with the sharpened point of a woodencrucifix, after which they would, in a matterof a few seconds, crumble from a livingbeing to a heap of dust. They were alsobelieved to be the servants of the Devil andwere thought to rape their virgin victimswhile they gorged themselves on theirblood. As a result, suspected victims wereexecuted just as often as, if not more oftenthan, suspected vampires.Modern belief, based to a great degree onthe novel Dracula,has added a great manyaspects to the vampire myth. Bram Stokerbased the novel not only on local supersti-tions but also on history, for parts of the storyare based on the life and times of the four-teenth-century Transylvanian warlord namedVlad, better known as “Vlad the Impaler,” forthe punishment he inflicted on his enemies.These unfortunates would be balanced at thetop of a sharpened post and tied by theirhands and feet to four more posts.Then theywere slowly rocked back and forth until thepoint of the post impaled them graduallythrough the stomach. Stoker also added theidea that vampires were shape-changers whowere in fact half human and half bat andcould change from one form to the other atwill. Since the advent of cinema, and later,television, the vampire has gone throughcountless changes; but still the vampireretains the basic elements of ancient Slavicbelief, and as such may be considered as oneof the longest-lived superstitions of moderntimes.See also:Black Sea; Devil,The; Dragon;Underworld,The; Upir;Vlad (the Impaler),Prince;WerewolfReferences:Perkowski 1976; Summers 1929VARANGIANSGeneralThe name given by the Slavs to the Scan-dinavian traders who were known as Russes,Rhos, or Rus' to the Greeks.

However, when he grew up,Vasilii began to consort with a drunken androwdy crowd, and soon he gained a reputa-tion as a lout who would do harm to otherssimply for the fun of it.The law-abiding cit-izens of Novgorod went to see the widowAmelfia Timofeyevna to complain about theconduct of her son, and she, in turn, scoldedher son for his behavior.However, the scolding did nothing toVasilii Buslayevich other than make himresolve to live his life as he saw fit. He sentout a challenge to all those in Novgorod thatif they could pass two tests he would setthem, they would become members of hisdruzhina(retinue) and live a life of luxury athis expense.Word of the challenge quickly spread, andit was not long before a huge crowd hadgathered in front of Vasilii Buslayevich’shome.Vasilii faced the crowd and told themthat the two tests consisted of drinking, in asingle quaff, a cup of green wine—no nor-mal cup, but one holding the equivalent ofone and a half vedro.The second test wouldbe to stand, unwavering, under a single blowfrom Vasilii Buslayevich’s huge mace, which291VASILII BUSLAYEVICH"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"was made of elm wood and filled with leadand weighed more than twenty poods (ap-proximately 720 pounds).The first to take the tests and pass wasKostia Novotorzheni. He was followed bytwo boyar brothers by the names of Luka andMoisei, then by the men of Zalyoshen, theseven Sbrodovich brothers, and so on, untilthere were twenty-nine members of thedruzhina,Vasilii Buslayevich himself beingthe thirtieth.Those who failed the tests werekilled and simply thrown over a wall.Several days later Vasilii Buslayevich heardthat the men of Novgorod were organizing alarge party in honor of one Nikolai, so heand his men went along to see if they couldgain entry, which they did when VasiliiBuslayevich paid five rubles for each of themand twenty-five for himself. As the eveningwore on, great quantities of alcohol wereconsumed, and a fight broke out duringwhich Vasilii Buslayevich was set upon andcame close to being strangled. He called outfor help, whereupon Luka, Moisei, andKostia Novotorzheni came to his aid, killingtheir ataman’s attackers.The fighting continued until the partygo-ers begged Vasilii Buslayevich and his menfor mercy. Vasilii Buslayevich considered theproblem for a moment and then wagered thetownsfolk that his followers could take onthe entire city and win. He added that if hedid win, then the city would pay him and hismen a tribute of three thousand rubles a year,until the very last member of his druzhinawas dead; but if he lost, then he would paythe city three thousand rubles a year until hisdeath. The men of Novgorod accepted thechallenge and agreed that the fight shouldstart the very next day.Quickly it became apparent that VasiliiBuslayevich and his men were the morepowerful; so several of the leaders ofNovgorod went to the widow AmelfiaTimofeyevna and pleaded with her to takeher son in hand.The widow considered var-ious courses of action and then had herhandmaiden bring her son to her. AmelfiaTimofeyevna gave her son a drugged drink,then had her handmaiden lock him in astrong dungeon with thick iron bars at thewindows and several locks on the manydoors between the dungeon and the outside.The battle now turned in favor of themen of Novgorod, who steadily forced VasiliiBuslayevich’s men back toward the riverVolkhov. There the handmaiden of thewidow Amelfia Timofeyevna came across thefight and was beseeched for help by VasiliiBuslayevich’s men. She immediately cast thebuckets from the yoke about her neck, andbrandishing the yoke, plowed into the menof Novgorod, killing a great many andknocking a great many more senseless.Then,with the odds slightly evened, she ran to thedungeon where she had incarcerated VasiliiBuslayevich and set him free.Vasilii Buslayevich rushed to the aid of hismen, only to find his way blocked by an agedpilgrim carrying a huge gold bell thatweighed over three hundred poods (10,800pounds). The pilgrim warned Vasilii Bus-layevich to refrain from attacking the men ofNovgorod, for he said that the men of Nov-gorod would be victorious in the end. Dis-interested and disbelieving, Vasilii Buslay-evich told the pilgrim to stand aside, andwhen he did not, he struck out at him,whereupon the pilgrim disappeared.Vasilii Buslayevich hurried back into thebattle. Soon he and his men once more hadthe upper hand. Seeing that they were losingthe battle, the men of Novgorod went to thewidow Amelfia Timofeyevna and told herthat they would accept defeat and gladly paythe tribute her son had demanded. Amelfiasent the handmaiden to fetch VasiliiBuslayevich, and over glasses of wine the twosides made their peace.Peace, however, was not what burned inVasilii Buslayevich’s heart. Still, he hadsigned a pact with the city of Novgorod, andso he had to seek adventure farther afield.Tothis end he built a sturdy ship, painted itblood red, and took to a life of piracy on thewaters of Lake Il'men'. As they sailed, Kostia292VASILII BUSLAYEVICH"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Nikitin guarded the stern and Tiny Potaniathe stem, while Vasilii Buslayevich paced upand down looking for a new target to attack.At length,Vasilii Buslayevich felt the burdenof age bearing down on him, and so he andhis men decided to make a pilgrimage toJerusalem to seek divine forgiveness beforethey died.Setting sail from Novgorod, they sailedthree weeks before sighting another ship.When the two ships drew abreast, they askedthe other sailors, who all had heard of VasiliiBuslayevich and his druzhina,the most directroute to Jerusalem.The sailors told them thatthe city they sought lay seven weeks’ sailaway by the most direct route, or a year anda half by the indirect one.Vasilii Buslayevichtold them he would follow the quickestroute to his salvation; but the sailors warnedhim that this meant they would have to passthe island of Kuminsk in the Caspian Sea,where three thousand Kazakh atamansbarred the way, robbing and sinking any shipthat attempted to pass.Undeterred, Vasilii Buslayevich and hismen sailed on until they came to an island onwhich they beached their ship. They beganto climb the central mountain, which wascalled the Sorochinsk, or the Saracen, Hill.Halfway up the mountainside, Vasilii Bus-layevich came across a pile of human bonesand idly kicked the skull aside. The skullwarned Vasilii Buslayevich that he would dieon that very mountain; but Vasilii refused tobelieve it, kicked it again to one side, andcontinued to climb.At the top of the mountain they came toa huge stone slab that had an inscription onit saying that any who dived across it wouldsurely die. This slab is described by somesources as three fathoms high (24 feet), threearshinsand a quarter wide, and a whole ax-throw across. Vasilii and his men read thewords, laughed at them, and then crossed thestone, though none dared dive across.However, they found nothing else on thatisland, so they returned to their ship andresumed their course for Jerusalem.Sailing on into the Caspian Sea, the shipcame to the island of Kuminsk and dockedunder the watchful eye of over a hundredKazakh pirates.Vasilii Buslayevich paid themno attention, calmly moored the ship, andthen leaped ashore, carrying his huge elmmace. So intimidated were the Kazakhs byhis casual indifference that they scattered totell their atamans of the arrival of VasiliiBuslayevich and his druzhina.The atamanscame out to greet their visitor, who simplyasked them to point out to him the mostdirect route to Jerusalem. They invited himto dine with them, which he did, and then,amazed by his prowess and calm among acompany feared by all others, the Kazakhatamans provided Vasilii Buslayevich a youngguide and bade him a safe journey—glad tosee him go and to have escaped his legendarywrath.Vasilii Buslayevich and his men sailedacross the Caspian Sea and entered the con-fines of the river Jordan, where they tied upthe ship, Vasilii Buslayevich going on intoJerusalem by himself. There he prayed andtook communion in the Church of the HolySepulchre. While he was away,his menwaited patiently on their ship and bathed inthe waters of the Jordan. While bathing theywere approached by an old woman, who toldthem that only Vasilii Buslayevich mightbathe in the same waters that Jesus Christhad been baptized in and that they wouldlose their valiant leader before long.The men laughed at the old woman’ssuperstition and continued to bathe in theriver. Vasilii Buslayevich completed hisprayers in Jerusalem and returned to his boat,and then set sail, retracing his course back toNovgorod. On the way he again stopped andfeasted with the Kazakh pirates, and mooredhis ship again at the island of the Sorochinsk,or Saracen, Hill.Again Vasilii Buslayevich andhis men climbed the hill, and crossed thestone slab at the top.This time Vasilii decidedto defy the prophecy engraved on the slaband dove headlong from one side to theother. He took a good run up and leaped293VASILII BUSLAYEVICH"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"into the air. However, as his legs crossed theedge of the stone, one foot caught the lip,and Vasilii Buslayevich crashed down ontothe slab, splitting his head open and spillinghis brains. He died instantly.His men quickly gave Vasilii Buslayevich aChristian burial and then returned toNovgorod, where they broke the news of hisdeath to the widow Amelfia Timofeyevna.Vasilii’s mother offered each of his men anequal share of her dead son’s fortune, butthey all refused and drank a simple toastbefore going their separate ways.This is not the only account of the deathof Vasilii Buslayevich. Another legend, whichis a post-Christian attempt to stamp out theremembrance of these great heroes anddemigods, says that seven bogatyri onceassembled to go on a journey together. Theseven were Vasilii Buslayevich, GodenkoBludovich, Vasilii Kazimirovich, Ivan Go-stinyi Syn, Alyosha Popovich, DobrynyaNikitich, and Il'ya Muromets. Setting outtogether on horseback, the seven rode outtoward the river Safat. At the junction ofthree roads, not far from the banks of theSafat, the seven men made camp and settleddown for the night.The following morning Dobrynya Ni-kitich was the first to wake and went downto the Safat to bathe and give thanks to God.As he made to leave he noticed a white tentpitched on the opposite bank that he recog-nized as belonging to a Tatar—a Muslim, andthus a sworn enemy of every bogatyr'.Dobrynya called out a challenge to the Tatar,who rushed from his tent fully armed andleaped onto his horse to meet DobrynyaNikitich in battle on the plain. For a longtime the two fought before Dobrynya wastoppled from his horse. The Tatar leapeddown and cut out Dobrynya’s heart and liver.As Dobrynya Nikitich died, AlyoshaPopovich rose from his bed and came to theSafat to bathe and make ready for the day.There he saw Dobrynya Nikitich’s horsewandering aimlessly, and catching the sadlook in the horse’s eyes, he knew that some-thing was wrong. Quickly he mounted hisown horse and rode across the plain, lookingfor his comrade. Before long he came to thetent of the Tatar, and there he saw the dis-membered body of Dobrynya Nikitich lyingon the ground. Alyosha roared a challengeand was quickly met by the Tatar. The twofought long and hard until Alyosha managedto unseat the Tatar, leaped upon him, andmade ready to cut out his heart. As hekneeled over the body, knife poised, a blackraven swooped down and beseeched Alyoshato spare the life of the Tatar, saying that if hislife was spared, then the raven would fetchthe Water of Life and Death so that Alyoshamight restore his fallen comrade to life.Alyosha agreed, and before long the ravenreturned with two vials of water, one con-taining the Water of Death and the other theWater of Life.Alyosha first anointed the bodyof Dobrynya Nikitich with the Water ofDeath, and his body became whole again.Then he anointed the body with the Waterof Life, and Dobrynya came back to life andembraced his comrade. They then set theTatar free and returned to the banks of theSafat to wash and give thanks to God.As they rose from their ablutions they sawa huge Tatar army approaching the river andcalled to the other bogatyri to join them inthe coming battle. For three hours and threeminutes they rode through the Tatar army,and by the end of that time had killed eachand every Tatar warrior. As they rode back tothe banks of the river to wash off the bloodof the battle, the seven began to boast abouttheir accomplishments. As they boasted thatnone could ever defeat them, they were con-fronted by two strange warriors, who chal-lenged them.Alyosha Popovich took up the challengefirst and rushed at the warriors, cutting eachin half as he rode past them; but as he turnedhis horse to boast to his comrades, he sawthat the two had now become four.Dobrynya Nikitich was the next to charge,and he too cut all the warriors in half; but ashe turned, he found that the four had now294VASILII BUSLAYEVICH"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"become eight. Il'ya Muromets then charged,but with the same result. For the first time intheir lives, the seven felt fear, and decidingthat living was better than certain death, theyall fled for the mountains. There, as each ofthe seven entered the foothills, he was imme-diately turned to stone.That is why, after thisencounter, there were no more bogatyri leftin all Russia.It is interesting to note in this story thatthe Water of Life and Death is depicted astwo separate elements, whereas it is usuallyreferred to as a single solution. It is also inter-esting to note that the deaths of the heroesvary from those described in the tales of theirindividual lives.See also:Alyosha Popovich; Amelf(i)aTimofe(y)evna; Boyars; Buslai (~y); CaspianSea; Dobrynya Nikitich; Godenko Bludovich;Il'men', Lake; Il'ya Muromets; Ivan GostinyiSyn; Kostia Nikitin; Kostia Novotorzheni;Luka; Moisei; Nikita; Nikolai of Mozhaisk,Saint; Novgorod; Potania,Tiny; Safat; SaracenHill; Sbrodovich; Sorochinsk Hill;Tatars;Vasilii Kazimirovich;Water of Life and Death,The; ZalyoshenReferences:Speranskii 1916; Ukhov 1957VASILII KAZIMIROVICHRussiaOne of seven bogatyri who once assembledto go on a journey together.

Forthe first twenty years of her life she livedalone, save for her maids and ladies-in-waiting, in her room at the top of a talltower. She earned her epithet from her hair,which reached to her ankles and which shewore in a single plait. News of her wondrousbeauty had gradually spread far and wide,and soon offers of marriage were received.Her father was in no hurry and waited untilthe appropriate time to announce that shewould choose a husband.As Vasilissa had never been outside herroom, she longed to see the fields and theflowers that lay beyond the palace. Finally herfather agreed to let her out just once. As shestrolled around, picking the pretty flowers, shewandered away from her ladies-in-waiting.Just then, a strong wind sprang up, lifting theunfortunate girl from the ground and carry-ing her far away to the domain of a fiercedragon, who imprisoned her in a goldenpalace that stood on a single silver pillar.Heartbroken by her disappearance, herparents sent her two brothers to find her.After two years they came to the land of thedragon and saw Vasilissa behind a barred win-dow inside the strange palace. As theyentered the palace the dragon returned.Confronted by the two young men, he deftlypicked up one and dashed him against hisbrother, thus killing both.Vasilissa at first starved herself; but thenshe vowed that rather than die, she wouldescape from the palace. Pretending to be niceto the dragon, she learned that there wasonly one who could overcome him, and hewas named Ivan the Pea.The dragon laughedas he told her this, for he did not believe thatsuch a person existed. Indeed, at that time,Ivan the Pea had not yet been born.Back at her home, Vasilissa’s mother washeartbroken for the lack of news of her chil-dren.Walking in her garden one hot day, shebecame thirsty and drank from a small streamthat ran through the garden, failing to seethat she also swallowed a small pea that wasin the water. The pea started to swell insidethe tsarina, and after the appropriate time shegave birth to a son, whom she called Ivan thePea.Ivan the Pea grew at a tremendous rate.Atthe age of ten, he was the strongest and fat-test knight in all the kingdom. Learning ofthe fate of his brothers and sister, Ivan thePea set out to find them.After traveling threedays, Ivan the Pea came to a house on chick-ens’ legs that revolved in the wind. The oldcrone who lived in the house gave Ivan thePea directions to the land of the dragon, onthe condition that he bring back some of themagic water owned by the dragon, whichwould make her young again.After a lengthy journey, Ivan the Peaarrived at the palace of the dragon. WhenVasilissa found out who he was, she beggedhim to leave and save his life. Ivan the Peawould not hear anything of the sort. Instead,he went to the palace smithy and asked theold smith to make him a mace weighing fivehundred poods (18,000 lbs or 8,190 kg).Themace took forty hours to make, and fiftymen were needed to lift it; but Ivan the Peapicked it up in one hand and tossed it intothe air, where it disappeared from sight. Ivanthe Pea returned to the palace and asked tobe told when the mace was sighted. Threehours later, a frightened messenger told Ivanthe Pea that the mace had been spotted, andhe deftly caught it in one hand, the impacthaving no effect on him but making themace bend slightly. Ivan the Pea simply laidit across his knee and bent it straight again.Shortly afterward the dragon returned tothe palace, which normally would havebegun to revolve on its single silver pillar as296VASILIS(S)A OF THE GOLDEN BRAID"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"he approached. This time it did not evenmove an inch, warning the dragon that theremust be something, or someone, extremelyheavy inside.The dragon, who had the body of a manbut the head of a serpent, flew in throughone of the windows, riding a winged blackhorse. Spying Ivan the Pea, the dragon leapedat him, but Ivan the Pea jumped nimbly toone side. As the dragon crashed to the floor,Ivan the Pea launched his enormous mace atit. As the mace made contact, it smashed thedragon into thousands of tiny pieces.However, the mace did not stop at that, andcontinued through the walls of the palace,coming to rest many hundreds of miles away.Refusing the requests of the beleagueredkingdom that the dragon had ruled over tobecome their tsar, Ivan the Pea appointed thesmith who had made his mighty mace. Next,remembering the promise he had made tothe old crone in the forest, he located themagic water owned by the dragon, the Waterof Life and Death. He carefully filled a flaskwith the water and then sprinkled some overthe bodies of his dead brothers, who cameback to life, rubbing their eyes as if they hadjust awakened from a deep sleep.All four then returned home, stoppingen route to deliver the flask of the magicwater to the crone in the forest. Oncehome,Vasilissa took a husband, and follow-ing the death of their father, Ivan the Peabecame tsar.Even though the crone in the forest in thisstory is not named, most authorities agreethat she is none other than the witch Baba-Yaga.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Dragon; Ivanthe Pea; Svetozar;Water of Life and Death,TheVASILIS(S)A THE BEAUTIFULRussiaAlso:Maryshia.Vasilissa the Beautiful was the only daughterof a merchant whose wife died when the girlwas just eight years old. As she lay dying hermother gave Vasilisushka, her pet name forVasilissa, her blessings and a doll, saying thatif ever Vasilissa needed guidance all she had todo was feed the doll and it would tell herwhat to do. A short time later the merchantmarried for the second time, this time mar-rying a widow who had two daughters ofher own.Vasilissa’s stepmother and stepsisters werejealous of her beauty and did everything theycould to make her life miserable. They gaveher all the hardest jobs to do and yet werealways complaining about her. However,Vasilissa completed each task with ease, for allshe had to do was feed the doll her motherhad given her, and while she passed the timepicking flowers or walking in the meadows,the doll did all the work that had beenassigned.The years passed and the merchant spentmuch of his time away from home. On onesuch occasion the stepmother moved theentire family to the edge of a very dark for-est in the middle of which Baba-Yaga hadher home. Every day some excuse would befound to send Vasilissa into the forest; butevery time, the doll guided her and kept herclear of Baba-Yaga’s house. One night inautumn the stepmother and her daughters letall the fires in the house go out, and order-ing Vasilissa to fetch light from Baba-Yaga,they pushed her out of the house.After talking with her doll, who told herthat no harm would come to her as long asshe kept the doll with her, Vasilissa left thehouse and started into the forest.A short waydown the path, just as dawn was breaking,she was passed by a galloping horsemanwhose face and clothes were white, as werehis horse and its harness. Just as the sun wasrising, she were passed by a second racinghorseman. This time the rider’s face andclothes were scarlet, as were his horse andharness. Vasilissa walked deeper and deeperinto the forest, well into the evening, untilshe came to the clearing in which Baba-Yaga’s house stood.The sight she saw froze her to the spot. Ahigh fence of human bones circled the cot-297VASILIS(S)A THE BEAUTIFUL"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"tage, which revolved slowly in the slightbreeze. Human skulls adorned the fenceposts. The gate consisted of a pair of humanlegs, the bolts of a pair of human hands, andthe lock of a mouth with razor-sharp teeth.As Vasilissa stood there, a third horsemanpassed her, riding swiftly through the gates,which magically opened to admit him. Thisrider was entirely black and rode the black-est horse Vasilissa had ever seen. As horse andrider passed through the gate, they disap-peared from view, and night instantly fell.Light soon returned to the scene, however,for the eyes in the skulls that sat atop thefence started to glow until the clearing waslit as brightly as it would have been in themiddle of the day.As Vasilissa stood in the strangely lit clear-ing, she heard an awful noise coming fromthe forest. Suddenly Baba-Yaga herself cameinto view, riding in a mortar that she rowedwith a pestle, and brushing away all traces ofher passage with a broom. Stopping at thegates, she saw Vasilissa and asked her why shehad come. When Vasilissa told her that shehad come for a light, Baba-Yaga said that shewould give her one provided she worked forher for a time, warning that her failure tocomplete any assigned task would result inher being eaten.For two days Baba-Yaga assigned Vasilissaseemingly impossible tasks, such as extractingearth from poppy seeds, or fennel fromwheat; but each task was carried out withease by the doll. All Vasilissa had to do wascook for the witch, a task she enjoyed andthe doll did not, for fear of falling into thefire and burning up. On the third eveningBaba-Yaga told Vasilissa that as her motherhad blessed her, she was free to leave. First,however, Vasilissa asked whether she mightknow the answer to a single question. Thewitch agreed.Vasilissa wanted to know whothe three horsemen were whom she hadseen. Baba-Yaga explained that they were herservants, Day, Sun, and Night. Leading thegirl to the gate, she took one of the skullsdown from the fence and placed it on a polebefore handing it to Vasilissa, who then madeher way back to the cottage where her step-mother and stepsisters awaited her return.Outside the cottage Vasilissa made tothrow away the skull, but it told her not to.Entering the cottage, Vasilissa was warmlywelcomed, because since she had left theyhad been unable to light anything in thecottage and had spent five miserable days inthe dark and the cold. However, when theytook the skull from Vasilissa, it stared straightinto their eyes. No matter where they hidthe skull managed to fix its gaze on them,and by morning all three had been burnedto a cinder.Leaving the cottage the next morning,Vasilissa buried the skull and returned totown to await her father. While she waited,her doll wove some spectacular thread,which a seamstress took to the tsar.When hesaw it he asked for the spinner of such athread to be brought to him. When he sawVasilissa, the tsar fell instantly in love with herand made her his wife.This story, whose theme is well known insuch stories as that of Cinderella, shows boththe benevolent and the malevolent nature ofthe witch Baba-Yaga. Authorities have iden-tified the mother of Vasilissa as a sister ofBaba-Yaga who is jealous of Vasilissa’s beauty,or as one of Baba-Yaga’s aspects that is equiv-alent to the third aspect of the triune god-dess—that of death. Baba-Yaga herself repre-sents the second aspect of the triunegoddess—that of fate, neither good nor bad,and the doll, her first aspect—that of protec-tress and life-giver.See also:Baba-Yaga (-Jaga, -Iaga); Day; Night;Sun;VasilisushkaReferences:Afanas'ev 1957VASILIS(S)A THE WISERussiaA princess from a remote, unnamed king-dom who had the ability to change her shapeat will, though she usually chose to assumethat of a frog.

Each prince did as in-structed and set off to find his arrow.Ivan was at first unable to locate hisarrow. However, after three days of searchinghe came across a small hut made of reeds, inthe middle of a swamp. Inside sat a largegreen frog with Ivan’s arrow in its mouth.The frog saw Ivan the Young and bade himenter, changing the hut into a pretty sum-merhouse so that it was large enough toaccommodate him.The frog then magically conjured up atable fully laden with food, and when Ivanhad eaten, told him that unless he consentedto marry her he would never leave theswamp. Realizing that the frog was anenchantress, Ivan the Young agreed. Withthat, the frog discarded its skin and stoodbefore him in its real form—that of a beau-tiful maiden. The maiden told Ivan that shewould wear her frog skin during the day butwould appear every night as he now saw her.When he returned home, Ivan the Youngwas at first ridiculed for wanting to marrythe frog; but finally his father consented andthe two were wed. The frog kept her wordand appeared as a beautiful woman everynight. For a long time Ivan and his wifelived happily. Then the tsar devised threetests for each of his son’s wives.The first wasto sew a fine shirt. The frog easily won, forshe had had the garment magically made.The second test was to embroider a tapestryin a single night. Again the frog easily won,for she commanded the winds to bring herthe finest tapestry from her father’s king-dom. Finally the tsar commanded each tobake him a loaf of bread. This time the twoother wives tried to cheat by spying on thefrog; but each only produced disastrousresults, while the frog produced the finestloaf ever seen.To congratulate each of his daughters-in-law the tsar organized a huge banquet intheir honor. Distraught, Ivan the Young knewhe would be the laughingstock of the king-dom if he brought a frog to the banquet.Telling him to go on ahead, the frog changedinto the beautiful maiden and arrived at thebanquet in the finest horse and carriage any-one in that kingdom had ever seen. As thefeast drew to a close, Ivan made an excuseand left early to arrive home ahead of hiswife.There, in an attempt to keep his wife inher womanly form, he found and burned herfrog skin. When his wife returned, she toldhim that had he waited just a while longer,she would have been his forever. She toldhim that her name was Vasilissa the Wise andthat she must now disappear; and she gavehim instructions on how to travel to the landof eternal sunlight if he wished to find her.Ivan the Young set out to find his wife.After a long journey he found himself infront of a small wooden hut on chicken’s legsthat revolved slowly in the wind—the homeof the witch Baba-Yaga. Entering the hut hewas confronted by the angry witch; butwhen he explained the purpose of his visit,the witch agreed to help him. She told himthat his wife flew in every day to see her.After she had made herself comfortable, Ivanwas to take hold of her firmly and not let goeven when she changed her shape. Finallyshe would turn into an arrow, which Baba-Yaga told Ivan to break over his knee. Then,and only then, would Vasilissa be his forever.Shortly afterward Vasilissa flew in on hermagic carpet. Making herself comfortable,she did not see Ivan as he leaped out of hishiding place and caught hold of her.Instantly she began to change her shape,and in surprise, Ivan let her wriggle freeand fly away.Baba-Yaga then advised Ivanthe Young to visit Vasilissa’s middle sister,for the witch knew that Vasilissa also visitedher.

For the next seven years Vol'gaBuslavlevich traveled throughout the knownworld and learned everything there was tolearn about people—their history, their lan-guage, and everything else. Then he traveledto Kiev and gathered a group of twenty-nineother bogatyri around him, himself acting astheir ataman, or chieftain.Vol'ga Buslavlevich’s first command to hismen was to make nets of silk and set them inthe forest, and then hunt through the forestsand catch him martens, sables, foxes, hares,and any other creatures they might comeacross, driving the animals into the nets. Hismen obeyed his command; but no matterhow hard they hunted, not one animal wasdriven into the nets.Then Vol'ga Buslavlevichhimself went into the forest, turned himselfinto a lion, and drove just about every animalin the forest into the nets.Back in Kiev, Vol'ga Buslavlevich com-manded his men to make him more nets, andthis time he told them to place the netsbetween the branches of tall trees, hunt forthree days, and drive all the birds of the for-est into the nets.

After three days of intensivefishing, not one fish had been caught.Vol'gaBuslavlevich therefore turned himself into agreat pike, and soon he had driven all the fishfor miles around into the nets.Knowing by these tests that his menwould do exactly as he commanded, hetold them that he had learned that the sul-tan of Turkey was planning to invade Rus-sia and that he would travel there to dis-cover the intentions of that ruler. Vol'gaBuslavlevich turned himself into a fast-flying bird, and quickly flew to the palaceof the sultan. He landed on the windowsillof the throne room, whence he could hearthe sultan speaking. The sultan was tellinghis prisoner, Queen Pantalovna, of his plansto invade Holy Russia. As Vol'gaBuslavlevich listened, he heard the sultansay that he intended to take nine cities forhis nine sons and to bring back the finestsable coat in all Russia.Queen Pantalovna replied that she hadhad a dream. In that dream a tiny white birdhad met in aerial combat with a mightyblack raven, the white bird triumphing andscattering the feathers of the raven to thefour winds. She added that the white birdwas none other than Vol'ga Buslavlevich,while the raven was the sultan of Turkey.The sultan was furious and struck thequeen, whereupon Vol'ga Buslavlevichturned himself into a wolf and quickly ranto the royal stables, where he tore thethroats of all the horses there. Then heturned himself into a weasel and ranthrough the palace, breaking bows andarrows, shattering swords and spears, andsmashing steel maces. Then Vol'ga Buslav-levich resumed his form as a tiny white birdand flew quickly back to Kiev.There he gathered together his bogatyri,and the thirty of them marched into thelands of the sultan of Turkey, killed the sultanand all his men, released Queen Pantalovna,and then divided the rich spoils equallyamong them.This story should be compared with thestory of Volkh Vseslav'evich, which apartfrom the numbers and the country involved,is similar.See also:Bogatyr'; Bylina; Kiev; Mother Earth;Naui; Pantalovna, Queen;Volkh Vseslav'evichVOL'GA SVIATOSLAVOVICHRussiaNephew and godson of Prince VladimirBright Sun, who had bestowed on him adomain that included three towns and theirsurrounding lands, and lordship over all theinhabitants of this domain.

The English name, however,comes from the Saxon wer(man) and wulf(wolf). Werewolves were born to humanmothers, were particularly hairy at birth, andmight have extra folds of skin on their headsor even a wolf ’s claws and fangs, with whichthey bit and scratched their mothers as theysuckled. Often as not, they were twins.Although some werewolves were thought tohave the ability to change their form at will,others changed involuntarily under the influ-ence of the full moon. This latter form ofmetamorphosis has become the most popularin modern tales of werewolves. Some were-wolves were thought to be invulnerable tomortal weapons, though most could bewounded with silver weapons—originallyarrows, but later bullets—and others could behurt as could any mortal human being.Wounded werewolves resumed their humanform before they died. Common superstitionstill holds that when a werewolf dies itbecomes a vampire, although the soul of thewerewolf would be reborn to another humanmother and thereby perpetuate the survivalof this supernatural race.The belief in werewolves dates back at leastthree millennia but had its heyday in latemedieval and renaissance Europe. Duringthese times, werewolves received as muchattention as did the other emissaries of theDevil—demons and witches. Any signs oflycanthropy, with a recognized series of symp-toms, were met with the severest punishment.No woman could ever be persecuted forbeing a werewolf, as all werewolves weremale; but women had to contend with witch-hunts, which were common at that time.Characteristics of the werewolf included anexcessive hairiness; a port wine–colored birth-mark known as the “mark of Cain”; short,stubby fingers with sharp nails; excessive andoften threatening sexuality; and in the mostextreme cases, cannibalism. No factually sub-stantiated record of a werewolf exists; but fromthe first quarter of the sixteenth century tothe first quarter of the seventeenth century,more than 30,000 suspected werewolves wereput to death in France.See also:Devil,The;VampireWHIRLWINDRussiaThe personification of a whirlwind, sometimesreferred to as Vikhor'.

Common tomany mythologies and religions is the con-cept of a World Tree whose roots reach downto the underworld and whose branches reachup to heaven. It was generally believed thatthis tree grew in the exact center of theworld. Later traditions tended to treat theWorld Tree with contempt. In Siberia, how-ever, the legends of the tree retained theirimportance for a much longer time, for itwas this tree that aspiring shamans climbedin order to gain their magical powers.One post-Christian story illustrates themanner in which the World Tree was treatedlong after the disappearance of paganism.Thisstory tells of a peasant couple who were sopoor that they were reduced to living offacorns from the forest. One of the acorns theyhad gathered rolled out into their cellar, whereit began to grow. When the sapling reachedthe floor of their home, they simply cut a holefor it to grow through. They did the samewhen it reached the roof. Now they had a treegrowing straight through their home.Finally the time came when they couldfind no more acorns in the forest, so the manclimbed the tree to gather acorns from itinstead. Among its uppermost branches hefound a magnificent cockerel and a handmill.Quickly he seized both and climbed backdown to his wife. Wondering what theywould have to eat that day, the old womanturned the handle on the mill. To the cou-ple’s delight, pies and pancakes began totumble from the mill. From that day forththey no longer felt the pangs of hunger.Some time later a wealthy merchant waspassing through the forest and stopped at theirhouse, where he was hospitably welcomedand fed from the mill. Seeing the mill, themerchant offered a high price for it, but thecouple would not sell it. The merchant stolethe mill and quickly made his way home.Knowing that they could not go after themerchant, for no one would believe theirword against his, the couple sent the cockerelout after the mill. The bird flew off to thehome of the merchant, perched on his gate,and began to crow, saying that the merchantshould return the mill. Hearing this, the manordered his servants to throw the cockerel intothe well. There the cockerel simply drainedthe water and flew onto the man’s balcony,where it repeated its demands. This time theman had his cook throw the cockerel into thestove. In the midst of the flames, the cockerelspat out all the water from the well and flewright into the heart of the man’s house. As theman ran away, the cockerel seized the mill andflew back to the old couple in the woods.See also:Shaman; Siberia;Tree of Life,The;Underworld,The315WORLD TREE"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"316Pacino da Bonaguida,Tree of the Cross,fourteenth century, Accademia, Florence, Italy (Alinari/Art Resource, NY)"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"317YAKUTSGeneralAncient Siberian people who speak aTurkic language (in the Uralic-Altaic lin-guistic family) and who live near the LenaRiver in northeastern Siberia—one of thecoldest regions on earth—where they con-stitute the majority of the population ofthe Yakut autonomous region.

Just five years later, when he wasnine, Zurab’s mother died of a plague thatswept through their village, and he wasthenceforth known as the Orphan Zurab.His neighbor, a well-to-do farmer, took thelad in, thereby gaining a pair of able hands aswell as the right to annex the meager landthat Zurab had inherited from his motherand father.The farmer took to calling the young boyZuro and put him in charge of the sheep andcattle. Zuro led the animals to pasture everymorning and brought them back again everyevening. At the age of twelve, Zuro also wasput in charge of the young lambs, for he hadconstantly proved his worth in fights withthe older children of the village. Though hewas small for his age, Zuro already had thestrength of any grown man. His strength wasput to the test one day when a wolf sneakedin among the lambs he was tending, snatchedone, and made off with it. The other shep-herds in the fields saw what had happenedand blocked the wolf so that it had to turnaround and run back toward Zuro. Zurostood his ground; and when the wolf camewithin reach, he darted forward and snappedthe wolf ’s neck as if it were a piece of driedkindling.All the other shepherds witnessed theevent and shouted their approval. One sug-gested that from that day forth he should beknown as Zuro the Wolf-Strangler, butanother shouted that he should be calledAslan, the Lion—and from that day forthZurab, who had already become known asZuro, was known as the Orphan Aslan.When Aslan reached the age of twenty-one, he was put in charge of all the farmer’slivestock, and in the summer evenings hetook to herding the sheep into a cave andsleeping across the entrance, his water jugand satchel of rations,baghadj(unleavened322ZORYI"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"bread) and eggs, hanging above his head. Onmore than one occasion he noticed thatsome of his rations were missing, and so onenight he kept watch instead of sleeping, hiskulab(shepherd’s cloak) pulled over his headto shield his open eyes. In the middle of thenight, as Aslan was fighting to stay awake, aradiant maiden approached the cave, tookdown Aslan’s satchel, ate half his rations, anddrank half his water.As she turned to leave, Aslan caught holdof her and demanded to know who she was.She pleaded to be released, but Aslan wassmitten; and rather than let her go, hepleaded with her to remain with him andbecome his wife. The maiden told him thatshe would bring Aslan nothing but bad luck;but Aslan was resolute. Seeing that his mindwas made up, the maiden told him that shewas the daughter of King Zarzand, who forthe past four or five years had beenembroiled in a bitter war with seven kingswho had formed an alliance against him. Herfather had ridden off to war, leaving themaiden and her two brothers behind.All would have been well had not the ter-rible giant, the three-headed demonTapagöz, arrived with his six brothers,attacked the palace, and carried her off. Hertwo brothers had raised an army and hurriedin pursuit. For ten days the two sides fought,and by the eleventh day four of the demonsand the maiden’s eldest brother had beenkilled. On the thirteenth day another demonand the maiden’s younger brother had beenkilled. Now leaderless, the army had scat-tered and returned to their homes.Tapagöz, who was the oldest of thedemons, carried the maiden to his lair, theDevil’s Castle, and there, for forty days andforty nights, besought her to become hiswife. She refused, whereupon Tapagöz wentmad for three days, calling her name, Simizar,endlessly, and then had the maiden handedover to his mother, a witch, who had impris-oned her in the cave, allowing her to wanderforth only at midnight.Thus the maiden wascondemned to live until one who truly lovedher found the swallows that knew how shemight be freed.There and then Aslan promised Simizarthat he would seek out the swallows andreturn for her. The next morning, he drovethe sheep back down to the village, asked forthe money due him, and set out. Before longhe came to the intersection of three roads.Unsure which road to take, he prayed to Godand then threw his staff in the air. When thestaff landed, Aslan picked it up and followedthe road it had lain across. All day he walked,until just as the sun was about to dip beyondthe horizon, he came to a village, and therehe saw some swallows nesting above thedoor of a cottage.The cottage belonged to an old womanwho was only too glad to receive Aslan as herguest. She fed him bread and whatever elsecame to hand; and after he had eaten, sheprepared him a bed.All night Aslan lay awakethinking about Simizar and wonderingwhether the swallows he had seen wouldindeed provide him the information herequired. As day broke, Aslan climbed a lad-der to where the swallows had their nest,praying to God for the ability to understandtheir language. God answered his prayer in aninstant, and soon Aslan understood exactlywhat he had to do.Following the guidance of the swallows,Aslan descended the ladder and went to theold woman who had provided him withfood and lodging. Aslan kissed the woman’shand three times and thanked her threetimes, just as the swallows had said, and theold woman embraced him. She gave Aslanfourteen hazelnuts, two walnuts, a small bot-tle of water, a small quantity of flour in acloth, and explicit instructions on how itshould all be used.Aslan profusely thanked the old womanand departed. A short distance from the vil-lage, he sat down and ate one of the hazel-nuts. Instantly all thoughts and pangs ofhunger left him. Aslan cracked open one ofthe two walnuts, and before him stood amagnificent horse of fire and air, with wings323ZURAB"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"that were invisible to mere mortal eyes.Aslan then cracked open the second walnut,and from it came a steel-tipped spear,a sword sharp enough to cut throughwrought iron, a shield under which a mancould shelter in safety, and the finest clothesin all the world.Aslan dressed himself in the clothes,picked up the weapons, and mounted thehorse, and for seven days he rode like thewind until he came to the Devil’s Castle.There, following the instructions he hadbeen given, Aslan sprinkled water from thebottle over the sleeping form of the ogre’smother, climbed down the well in whichTapagöz slept, took a green wand from thewater, climbed back up the well, and leapedonto the back of Tipi, the name he had givenhis horse. Aslan spurred his horse on androde toward the cave and his belovedSimizar.For three days he rode, as fast as the wind,and on the fourth he looked back and saw ahuge dust cloud following him, beingthrown up by Tapagöz and his mother in hotpursuit. As Aslan spurred on his horse, Tipispoke to him for the first time and told himto throw the flour he had been given intothe air. Aslan did as he was told, and as theflour settled on the ground, a great forestsprang up—a forest so thick that Tapagöz andhis mother quickly became entangled in itsundergrowth.For two more days Aslan and Tipi rodeon. On the third day Aslan turned around inalarm as he heard the approach of Tapagözand his mother. Tipi told them that theymust stand their ground and fight, so Aslanprepared himself to do battle.Tapagöz was the first of the giants to reachAslan. His first punch, which would havesmashed Aslan to a million pieces, missedwhen Aslan neatly stepped to one side, theforce of the blow causing Tapagöz to stumbleand fall. Aslan seized this chance to cut offone of the giant’s three heads.Again the giantcame at him, and again his blow missed itsmark, giving Aslan the chance to almostcompletely sever a second head, which thenlay useless against the ogre’s chest. Tapagözrealized he was losing the battle, so he raisedhimself to his full height, and heaving a hugeboulder over his head, he launched it atAslan, who simply parried it with his shieldand then lunged at the giant with his spear.The steel point found its mark, penetratingTapagöz’s head through its single eye andappearing again on the opposite side of hisskull.With Tapagöz dead, Aslan turned to facehis mother, but she was nowhere to be seen.Instead there was a huge lake where nonehad been before. Tipi told Aslan that thelake had been formed from the ogress’s spit-tle and that she herself was now a duckswimming on its surface. Tipi then toldAslan to pluck three hairs from his maneand throw them on the lake. Aslan did so,and instantly a bridge appeared, over whichAslan safely rode.Two days later Aslan reached the cave inwhich Simizar was imprisoned, and tappingthe wand three times on the rock, he releasedhis beloved.Together they rode to the villageof the old woman who had given Aslan thehelp he needed to accomplish his mission,and they invited her to accompany them astheir mother. She was delighted, and after shegathered together her meager possessions,she took a small carriage from beneath herdress and blew it up. Aslan and Simizar rodeTipi toward the kingdom of King Zarzand,the old woman following in her carriage ashort distance behind, some invisible forcecarrying it along.After many days’ travel the three came tothe border of Zarzand’s kingdom, where theyencountered an army that barred their way.Aslan was all for fighting, but neither Simizarnor the old woman thought it a good idea,Simizar for fear that Aslan would receive amortal blow, and the old woman, because sheknew it was unnecessary. She took her shawlfrom around her neck and spread it on the324ZURAB"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"ground.Then she and Simizar sat on it and itrose into the air, and Tipi unfurled his wings,and he too rose into the sky with Aslan onhis back.As the travelers reached the edges ofZarzand’s capital city, they landed, and on theadvice of the old woman, they waited out-side the city walls while she went to gainapproval for the marriage of Simizar andAslan. At first neither the king nor queenwould believe that their daughter was stillalive; but at length, having been shown a tal-isman Simizar had given the old woman,Zarzand and his wife came to the city gatesand greeted their daughter and herbetrothed.Several days later, following the weddingfeast, Simizar and Aslan retired to their quar-ters while the old woman, aware that theywere in danger, stationed herself outsidetheir door with a three-pronged spear in herhand. Just as she had expected, on the strokeof midnight, a huge snake slithered intoview.The old woman sprang to her feet andthrust the spear through the snake’s head.The beast was killed and instantly trans-formed itself back into the mother ofTapagöz, one of each of the three prongs ofthe spear through each eye of the ogress’sthree heads.King Zarzand was so delighted by themarriage his daughter had made that heimmediately abdicated, and so began thereign of King Orphan Aslan.See also:Aslan; Devil’s Castle; Simizar;Tapagöz; ZarzandReferences:Orbeli and Taronian 1959–67,vol. 4ZUROArmeniaSeeZurab.ZUTTIBURSlavAn obscure deity of the forests who isthought to be a spirit of the same type as theleshii, though obviously of far less potencyand lesser importance.See also:Leshii (~y)ZVEZDA DENNITSASlavThe Morning Star, sister to ZvezdaVechernyaya and the two, or three, Zoryi—all four, or five, being the daughters ofDazhbog.
