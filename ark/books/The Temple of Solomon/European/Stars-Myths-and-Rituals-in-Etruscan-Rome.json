Marble, I century CE, from Villa Adriana,Tivoli. Pio Clementino Museum, Vatican Museums. Photo by Jastrow—WikimediaCommonsFor AlessandroForewordEtrusco - Roman Astronomy is a brilliant summation of Leonardo Magini’s priorworks. Since his earliest endeavours ( Le Feste di Venere , 1996, Astronomy andCalendar in Ancient Rome , 2001), not to mention his works on the Etruscanlanguage ( La Parola degli Etruschi , 1987 and L’Etrusco, lingua dall’OrienteIndoeuropeo , 2007), all of his research has amply demonstrated the author’sinterest in the origins of Roman civilization, and just how much Romancivilization owes to the culture of its Etruscan neighbours.Magini draws on an impressive number of Latin and Greek texts which, thoughindubitably hailing from later periods, nevertheless make up a well-consolidatedbody of opinion. He collates astronomical notions and data on religious feastdays to highlight the importance of the revised calendar traditionally ascribedto the legendary king Numa Pompilius, who is generally assumed to have been theheir to the founder of Rome. Whereas the year in use under Romulus had but 10lunar months—a characteristic that soon put it out of kilter with the Sun’smotion—Numa corrected this error not just by adding a further two lunar months,but by establishing a cycle of three times 8 years which, using differentnumbers of intercalated days, almost wholly restored the year’s concordance withthe solar year.The cycle attributed to Numa is an extremely close fit to the motion of themajor objects in the sky—the Sun, the Moon and Venus—and could be used topredict eclipses of the Sun and Moon. In other words, it was a worthy successorto the cycle of Saros, a fact that itself points to a Mesopotamian influence.Did not the Greek historian Herodotus say that the Etruscans were descended fromimmigrants who originated in Lydia?Even relative neophytes to astronomical issues will be fascinated by therelationship that the author establishes and proves between the passage of theyear as marked by the Numan cycle, and the cadence of the many religiouscelebrations that set apart the fasti (festive days, and the only days when thecourts were in session in Ancient Rome) from normal days (when people had towork, and justice could not be dispensed). Every feast day offers up an“explanation” to the passage of the heavenly bodies.Among the merits of this groundbreaking work is its clear demonstration of theextraordinary astronomical knowledge contained within the Roman religiouscalendar, which was established at Rome’s very beginnings. Though by no meanscertain, it is certainly legitimate to presume that this knowledge was stronglyinfluenced by Etruscan knowledge, and, before them, by the science of theChaldeans. The author’s lines of enquiry should be considered as an initialproof, to be confirmed by additional research.Germaine AujacPreface: A LetterTo my friends, Professors Franco Aspesi, Gioachino Chiarini and Mario Negri 1Distinguished professors and dear friends,As you have followed my research into the astronomical underpinnings of theNuman calendar right from the start, I send you a monograph that I have writtento address multiple objectives.First of all, the essay brings together the fruits of several years’ study, asillustrated in my books Le Feste di Venere and Astronomy and Calendar in AncientRome , 2 supported by the indispensable writings of authors of antiquity andastronomical calculations. This essay also draws on fresh calculations andanalyses to build on my previous work and illustrates more recent developments,including a new approach here and there. Last but not least, the essay opens upa number of avenues for further research which—I am the first to admit—a senseof satiety with the work I have undertaken thus far leads me to believe will befor someone else to pursue. I am only too happy to sketch out these avenues sothat fresh blood may consolidate and advance research into the now burgeoningdiscipline of Etrusco-Roman astronomy.I would, however, like to take this opportunity to make a few remarks regardingthe point at which, I believe, we have arrived.First, the sum of astronomical and astrological knowledge held by the anonymousinventor of the Numan calendar is codified in the temporal rhythms of the year’sfestivities, fitted into an appropriate system of intercalation.Second, the rhythm of these cadences, associated with reading and interpretingthe myths and rites associated with the festivities, allows us to trackbackwards to real astral movements.Third, the astronomical knowledge thus codified includes: the motion of Venus;the periodicity of solar and lunar eclipses; the revolution of the line of lunarnodes; the passage of nodes from the Points of Aries and Libra, and the effectthat this has on the motion of the Moon; the revolution of the line of apsides;and the relation between the synodical and sidereal periods of the superiorplanets. I touch only briefly on areas where certainty remains elusive: therhythm of the motion of the superior planets, particularly Jupiter and Saturn,and the position of zero degrees Aries. Lastly, work still needs to be done toclarify the astronomical significance of the nundinal letters, the truesignificance of the days of Agonalia (March 17, May 21, December 11 and January9), and of the opening of the mundus (August 24, October 5 and November 8).Fourth, we know without a shadow of doubt that there was an astrologicaltradition in Rome, among other things, because of the protection afforded towomen—the guarantors of the continuity of the species—by the two most “feminine”of celestial bodies since the proto-history of astrology: the Moon and Venus.This tradition is further evident in the bonds between the public exchequer andthe Temple of Saturn from 497 BCE (at the very latest) onwards.Fifth, last, and most important of all, the very rhythm of public and privatelife during the time of the Roman Kingdom was regulated by the motion ofcelestial bodies. Public life was ruled by the Vestalia, the Regifugium and theinterrex , and by the October Equus, the Fordicidia and the Parilia . 3 Privatelife was wholly ruled by the celestial bodies. Conception, the seventh month ofpregnancy, preparation for birth, birth itself, namegiving, all of the rites ofpassage associated with puberty, marriage and conception anew, all of which arenotable life landmarks—particularly in the lives of women—were cadenced bycelestial movements and the rhythm of their associated festivities: Matralia andCarmentalia, Matronalia and Liberalia , Tigillum sororium and Anna Perenna,Veneralia and, once again , Matralia . 4 Indeed, the circularity of human lifeon Earth reflects the circularity of the motion of the celestial bodies in theheavens.Having established these foundations, our enquiry must shift to their origins.An initial hypothesis is that these foundations descend directly from theprehistory of the Roman people. Such a hypothesis, however, flies in the face ofthe entire weight of tradition, which has it that King Numa was responsible forestablishing the calendar, intercalation, 5 and a great many of the feast days.There is also the matter of explaining why no other ancient Italian population,despite significant similarities in many respects, was able during the sameperiod of time to achieve a similar level of astronomical and calendarknowledge. Indeed, how could it have been possible in historical times for theRomans to “misplace” the origins of a cultural and intellectual heritageacquired through endless years of research and complex mental processes, eversince prehistoric times?An alternative hypothesis would lead us to a source from outside the Romansphere. Possible solutions may be found in similarities between the Regifugium -interrex - Vestalia and the sar puhi, the “substitution of the king” ritual fromAncient Babylon, where the same landmarks in astronomical knowledge wereattained a number of centuries earlier. If this association proves to becorrect, the question arises as to how this knowledge and its vast store ofrituals and conceptions managed to reach Rome, leapfrogging the Greek world.It is my personal belief that the answer lies elsewhere. I believe that theanswer is to be found in the Etruscan origin of the names of the great manyfestivities associated with astronomical timings. The Etruscans had the Nonae ,the name Ides, the nundinae, the clavus annalis , and—this is the clincher—theCapitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. This is where we should seek the“barbarian superior to Pythagoras” who, according to Plutarch, put the finishingtouches to educating the Roman king. And yet this adds a further layer ofcomplexity, for Pythagoras himself is complex enough: known as “Tyrrhenian” bybirth and upbringing, Pythagoras studied geometry, mathematics and astronomy inEgypt and Mesopotamia, before reputedly teaching so much to Numa—though not, itturns out, the calendar to which the king would lend his name. 6The picture only becomes much clearer if we accept that the Etruscans hailedfrom the Orient—from Lydia, as Herodotus claims. This would appear to beconfirmed by “the sale of Sardians”, that is to say, the Etruscans whom Romuluscaptured at Veio. 7 First, the Mesopotamian/Anatolian area had achieved a wholesequence of scientific achievements and an elaborate worldview that was theculmination of at least two millennia of development. Thereafter, over what canin no way be described as a brief period of time, an educated and cultured élitebelonging to a population living on the fringes of this area acquired thesenotions of astronomy and astrology, along with a worldview that gave them arounded meaning. Finally, as events unfolded, this population—including itsélite—travelled to Italy, defeated Rome, and as conquerors imposed a calendarthat, far from being “agricultural/pastoral” as has long been claimed, was basedon a surprisingly sophisticated accretion of astronomical knowledge. Thisknowledge was initially held by the élite; given its complexity, it wasimpossible to pass it down through the ensuing centuries.Pursuit of this line of enquiry—which today would be validated by examination of“the genetic data of the populations in potential areas of origin”, to quoteCavalli-Sforza 8 —would also explain the sudden step change in the Romancalendar, from the mysterious, cobbled-together 304-day Romulean Calendar(unless behind this astronomically meaningless number lies a 61-day intervalbetween significant astronomical phenomena, but then what phenomena would theybe?) 9 to the complex and sophisticated calendar adopted by the followinggeneration (i.e. Numa’s generation), which was light years ahead of thepreceding simple—and basic—lunar calendar.I believe that the same path was followed by other customs, beliefs and ideasregarding the relationship between men and divinities or, more specifically, thelife of man and celestial messages. I refer to haruspicy: divination through theexamination of sheep livers, the various parts of which represented parts of theheavens ruled by the planets and constellations, each of which in turnrepresented a divine being; I refer to brontoscopic calendars, in which everyday of the year corresponded to a particular sign belonging to a particular god;and I refer to the “the curse of the number nineteen”. Indeed, in AncientBabylon, where every single month was 30 days long, the number 49 was bad luck:“The week of weeks was determined by the 49th day after every new Moon—in a30-day month, that meant that it ran from the 19th day of the following month.Hemerologists considered this nineteenth day to be an umu limnu, an inauspiciousday… The Babylonians avoided the ill-omened 19th, and even went so far as towrite the number as XX.I.lal, i.e. 20 minus 1.” 10This credence may have resurfaced in Etruria; 11 I say “may have”—with thestress on its uncertainty—because as with almost everything to do with Etruria,studies in the field, most especially in Italy, have suffered from thecalamitous impact that ideology is capable of having on science. The credence,however, certainly does reappear in Ancient Rome, in the form of undeviginti,literally “one-away-from-twenty”, despite the fact that Rome had no need forsuch counting tricks, given that it had no residual trace either of the conceptsof a “week of weeks”, nor of 30-day months…Above all, I believe it impossible to attribute such a path of transmission—fromthe East to Etruria and on to Rome—to a fashion for “orientalizing”. Fashion andbragging have little use for Calendars; Calendars are not Assyrian paterae (Fig.1 ) or Urartean cauldrons, as is evident from two thousand years of Europeancalendar history. Fashion cannot explain why people have studied, observed andrecorded the movements and rhythms of the stars to try and understand futureevents; why the planet Venus was considered to be the representative of afeminine divinity of evening love—Ishtar in Mesopotamia and Venus in Rome, and adivine protector of morning warfare—Ishtar once again, plus Mater Matuta; and,with regard to celestial bodies in general—fixed stars and planets, the Moon andthe Sun—considering them as heaven’s corollaries to the gods, an expression oftheir desires which it is our lot to interpret.It could hardly have been turbocharged Villanovans (turbocharged by what, praytell?)—and I say this in open dispute with the triumphant curators ofexhibitions in Bologna and Venice 12 —who came up with the idea of a direct andbinding relationship between the macro-cosmos and the micro-cosmos, between themotion of the celestial bodies across the sky and the life of men on this Earth.If, as Seneca writes in historical times,A324790_1_En_BookFrontmatter_Fig1_HTML.jpg[A324790_1_En_BookFrontmatter_Fig1_HTML.jpg]Fig. 1“Orientalizing” patera.

The things that they thus transformed were ‘borrowedfrom the Barbarians’, especially, notes the author, from the AncientMesopotamians (Epinomides, 987e - 988a and 987a).”I believe that, similarly, the Etruscans were not born into a world of Primates;a world in which the only civilized people were rich but uncultured gentlemenfrom the East, from whom they could import luxury items, while from the poor butwise Greeks they were able to plunder—more than learn—everything else. TheEtruscans too had their sum of knowledge, their own weltanschauung, which theyattempted to bequeath to the Romans, albeit with limited success. Much of whatwe are able to reconstruct, such as the Etruscan calendar, survived its creatorsbut in the process lost almost all of its meaning for the people who continuedto use it. If my reconstruction is correct, the label of “Roman” rather than“Etrusco-Roman” astronomy would be an umpteenth abuse of power, of history beingwritten by the winner.I fear that I may have strayed from my own sphere of competence; I shall reinmyself back in. Indeed, I wish to take up the thread from where and how I began,from the “planned coincidence” that first led me to undertake a whole series ofminor calculations on the calendar, and to note that in the Numan calendar 71days elapse between the Veneralia and the Matralia. This process led me to read(frankly absurd) books such as Graves’ The White Goddess . I may never havefinished reading that book, but I recall perfectly the day when I bought it,opened it, turned to the index, and looked under Venus to find Venus (planet).The first reference, on page 293 of my Italian edition, says: “72 […] is alsolinked to the Goddess astronomically, by the 72-day season during which herplanet Venus moves successively from maximum eastern elongation to inferiorconjunction (its closest approach to Earth) and thence to maximum westelongation.” 16 This was what first triggered my research 7 or 8 years ago. Eversince then, I have been unsure quite where my sphere of competence begins andends.One thing I do know, however, is that I haven’t invented a bean of all this. Allof my reconstructions are based on well-known, if not to say renowned,documents. I have based my theses on nothing new—nothing that hasn’t alreadybeen known and been studied for at least two thousand years. I believe that I amthe first person—to my knowledge, at least—to prove the existence of a wealth ofscientific knowledge in the classical sources I have used and interpreted,merely by investigating the anthropological, mythical and religious data thatthey contain. All of this was revealed through an investigation of theastronomical underpinnings of the Numan calendar.One further thought springs to mind. Why was it that Mesopotamian astronomy was“discovered” a century or more before Roman astronomy? Was it simply because ofthe long-held credence that the Romans knew nothing of astronomy? Canconventional thinking really have had such a negative influence? Mesopotamianastronomy was “discovered” because scholars were open-minded, notwithstandingonly minimal previous evidence of the Chaldeans’ astronomical knowledge. We maylegitimately wonder how open-minded scholars have been regarding Ancient Rome,and how much they have been influenced—as modern-day scholars of the Etruscanscontinue to be, at least in Italy—by a preconceived ideological approach.It remains for me to thank you warmly for taking the time to read this work, inthe hope that it proves to be interesting and enlightening.Leonardo MaginiTorrimpietraMarch 2002–2014Nessuna umana investigazionesi puo’ dimandare vera scienza,s’essa non passa per le matematiche dimostrazioni.(No human investigation can be called true science without going through themathematical tests.)Leonardo da VinciNotesChaps. 1 [A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html] and 21 [A324790_1_En_21_Chapter.html]have been excerpted from the paper Astronomia e Calendario nell’antica Roma ,given at the First Conference of the Italian Archeo-astronomy Society, in Padua,on 29 September 2001 (see Rivista Italiana di Archeoastronomia, vol.

THE BEGINNING OF ASTRONOMICAL TIME AND THE FERIAE MARTISLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The third book of Ovid’s Fasti is dedicated to March, the first month of theNuman year. Right at the very beginning, before commencing his description ofthe month’s feasts, rites and myths, the poet writes of Romulus’s conception:> Silvia the Vestal (for why not start from her?)> went in the morning to fetch water to wash the holy things.> When she had come to where the path ran gently down the sloping bank,> she set down her earthenware pitcher from her head.> Weary, she sat her on the ground and opened her bosom> to catch the breezes, and composed her ruffled hair.> While she sat, the shady willows and the tuneful birds> and the soft murmur of the water induced to sleep.> Sweet slumber overpowered and crept stealthily over her eyes,> and her languid hand dropped from her chin.> Mars saw her; the sight inspired him with desire,> and his desire was followed by possession,> but by his power divine he hid his stolen joys.> Sleep left her; she lies big, for already> within her womb there was Rome’s founder.1Thus was Romulus conceived (Fig. 1.1), during what is, as we can surmise fromthe Vestal’s sleep, an undefined moment in time. The poet fails to mention theother event—the other conjunction—that on high accompanied the carnalconjunction on Earth which brought life to the founder of Rome. We rely on thehistorian Plutarch to discover this, in his essay On the Fortune of the Romans:A324790_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg]Fig. 1.1Mars and Rhea Silvia. Romuluswas conceived when the god of war came down toEarth and conjoined with the sleeping vestal virgin; legend has it that thecarnal conjunction occurred at the same time as a total solar eclipse.Sarcophagus Mattei detail, 220 CE, Palazzo Mattei and Vatican Museums, Rome.Photo by Giovanni dall’Orto—Wikimedia Commons> […] regarding the generation and conception of Romulus they record that the> Sun was eclipsed and came into exact conjunction with the Moon at the time> when Mars, a god, consorted with the mortal Silvia.2In his Life of Romulus , Plutarch repeats that according to Tarutius’calculations—Tarutius was an astronomer, astrologer and friend ofCicero’s—Romulus was conceived by his mother> during a total eclipse of the Sun.3The start point of astronomical time for the descendants of Romulus begins withthe exceptional and simultaneous conjunction of the representatives of thegods—the Sun and Moon in the sky, Mars and Silvia on Earth—with an initial Numancycle (see Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]) that itself commences with atotal eclipse of the Sun on the first day of the first month of year one,celebrated on the feast of Feriae Martis.4Footnotes1Ovid, Fasti, 3.1–166; translation by J.G. Frazer. Quoted here are lines 11–24:Silvia Vestalis—quid enim vetat inde moveri?— / sacra lavaturas mane petebataquas. / Ventum erat ad molli declivem tramite ripam: / ponitur e summa fictilisurna coma; / fessa resedit humo ventosque accepit aperto / pectore, turbatasrestituique comas. / Dum sedet, umbrosae salices volucresque canorae / feceruntsomnos et leve murmur aquae. / Blanda quies furtim victis obrepsit ocellis / etcadit a mento languida facta manus. / Mars videt hanc visamque cupit potiturquecupita / et sua divina arte fefellit ope. / Somnus abit, iacet ipsa gravis.

Eliade (Histoire des religions, p. 219; cited by Liou-Gille1980, pp. 162–163), who writes: “The appearance of a given child coincides withan auroral moment: the creation of the cosmos, the creation of new world, a newhistorical age.”Notably, in the West, our tally of years starts from the birth of a ratherspecial “baby”."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_22. THE NUMAN YEAR, THE ROMULEAN YEAR AND THE FERIALE ANTIQUISSIMUMLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The oldest Western calendar with a clear link to astronomy is traditionallyattributed to the second King of Rome, Numa Pompilius (715–673 BCE).His twelve-month lunar year began in March. Four of his months—i.e. March, May,July and October—were 31 days long; the other months (see Fig. 2.1) lasted29 days, except for February, which had 28 days (see Summary Chart).A324790_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg]Fig. 2.1The month of April, detail the second month of the Numan calendar and itsfestivities. Fasti Praenestini, detail. Fasti praenestini, between 6 and 9 CE,Palazzo Massimo/Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome. Photo by Marie-Ian Guyen-WikimediaCommonsThe Numan year was 355 days long, compared with a natural length of 354.3672(=12 × 29.5306); the absolute error was +0.6328 days, or 1.78 × 10−3 inpercentage terms.However, the Roman tradition retained traces of a calendar that predated the“Numan” calendar, which was attributed to the city’s founder, Romulus (754–716BCE),1 and even to the Albans. The “Romulean” calendar divided the year into10 months—four 31 day months and six 30 day months—and a total of 304 days. Atfirst sight, there is nothing astronomical about this calendar; however, inlater chapters, we will examine the relationship between the Romulean and Numancalendars and how it may have been possible to move from one to the other (seeChaps. 26 [A324790_1_En_26_Chapter.html] and 27 [A324790_1_En_27_Chapter.html]).Both Romulean and Numan calendars contained feast days. The so-called Ferialeantiquissimum —a modern name—is a list of officially-sanctioned festivitiesdating back to the earliest Roman kings. A handful of these feast days—such asParilia and Saturnalia—already existed before the foundation of Rome; some ofthem were established by Romulus; and many others were decreed by NumaPompilius.In more recent times, the Feriale consisted of forty-five feast days, plus thetwelve Idus dedicated to Jupiter, making a total of fifty-seven feast days. Thefollowing feast days were designated in official calendars using capitalletters: * in March, the Equirria on 14, the Liberalia on 17, the Quinquatrus on 19, and the Tubilustrium on 23; * in April, the Fordicidia on 15, the Cerialia on 19, the Parilia on 21, the Vinalia on 23, and the Robigalia on 25; * in May, 3 days of the Lemuria on 9, 11 and 13, the Agonalia on 21, and the Tubilustrium on 23; * in June, the Vestalia on 9, and the Matralia on 11; * in July, the Poplifugium on 5, 2 days of Lucaria on 19 and 21, the Neptunalia on 23, and the Furrinalia on 25; * in August, the Portunalia on 17, the Vinalia on 19, the Consualia on 21, the Volcanalia on 23, the Opiconsivia on 25, and the Volturnalia on 27; * in October, the Meditrinalia on 11, the Fontinalia on 13, and the Armilustrium on 19; * in December, the Agonalia on 11, the Consualia on 15, the Saturnalia on 17, the Opalia on 19, the Divalia on 21, and the Larentalia on 23; * in January, the Agonalia on 9, and 2 days of the Carmentalia on 11 and 15; * in February, the Lupercalia on 15, the Quirinalia on 17, the Feralia on 21, the Terminalia on 23, the Regifugium on 24, and the Equirria on 27.September and November were the only months not to have any feast days, with theexception of the Ides. Some feast days—such as the mysterious Agonalia on 21May, 11 December and 9 January—return to fall on different days during the year;others, such as the Lemuria on 9, 11 and 13 May, fall on three consecutiveodd-numbered days. Incidentally, only the Equirria on 14 March and theRegifugium on 24 February fall on even-numbered days.Indeed, even numbers seem to be a distinguishing characteristic of the twocalendars: the Romulean calendar has 6 months of 30 days, and lasts for a totalof 304 days, while in the Numan calendar February alone has an even number ofdays, and the year lasts a total of 355 days.2Footnotes1On the Romulean and Numan calendar, Censorinus, de die natali, 20.3–5, writes:“These 10 months lasted 304 days, distributed thusly: March 31, April 30, May31, June 30, Quintile (i.e. July) 31, Sextile (i.e. August) and September 30each, October 31, and November and December 30. The four longer months wereknown as whole months; the other 6 months were known as incomplete months.Afterwards, Numa […] created 12 months and 355 days […] We know as a certaintythat 51 days were added to the old year; as these days were insufficient to form12 months, 1 day each was removed from the six empty months; these 6 days wereadded to the 51 days to make a total of 57 days, which were then divided to make2 months: January, lasting 29 days, and February, lasting 28 […], Hi decemmenses dies CCCIIII hoc modo habebant: Martius XXXI, Aprilis XXX, Maius XXXI,Iunius XXX, Quintilis XXXI, Sextilis et September tricenos, October XXXI,November et December XXX; quorum quattuor maiores pleni, ceteri sex cavivocabantur. Postea sive a Numa […] XII facti sunt menses et dies CCCLV […] Certead annum priorem unus et quinquaginta dies accesserunt; qui quia menses duo nonexplerent, sex illis cavis mensibus dies sunt singuli detracti et ad eos additi,factique dies LVII, et ex his duo menses, Ianuarius undetriginta dierum,Februarius duodetriginta […]”.On the Romulean and Numan calendars, see also Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.13. 2Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.13.5, attributes to both Numa and Pythagoras apredilection for odd numbers.Virgil, Bucolica, 8.75, recalls: “numero Deus impare gaudet, God is pleased byodd numbers”.

THE NAMES OF ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN MONTHSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]An opening assertion: mankind’s first ever calendar derived from the Moon andobservation of its motion: the Moon making an entire revolution around the Earthinspired the idea of a “lunation”, a span of time longer than a single day butrelatively short nonetheless. The Indo-European name for “moon”—which has beenreconstructed as *menes- or *me(n)s—provides the root of our word for “month”,in the sense of a lunar month or a lunation. The noun “month/moon” is part ofthe common heritage shared by Indo-European peoples, which implies that the veryidea of a lunation dates back to before the separation of these peoples fromtheir—presumed—common homeland.And yet the Moon’s monthly revolution around the Earth—its “lunation”—has nodirect, measurable relationship with the Sun’s apparent revolution around theEarth. And it is this astronomical cycle which, over the course of time, was setto become more significant to human life.The fact is that in the first, exclusively lunar calendar, as each solar yearelapsed the “lunations” fell at different times of year in terms of solarradiation, meteorological conditions, and the advancement of animal and plantlife. The second calendar—the solar, or rather lunar/solar calendar —evolved tocater to the changing needs of man, notably, the transition from hunter gathererto farmer and agricultural civilization. In practice, the same name, “month”,was used to denote a period of time of a slightly different length: no longerthe period of natural lunation, which lasts around 29.53 days, but rather a“virtual” lunation, which, at least in Rome, could last either 28, 29, 30 oreven 31 days.Twelve such virtual months—which do not coincide with the lunations—made up acivil year that was almost the same length as the lunar year, but failed tocoincide with the solar year at all. For instance, the Roman calendartraditionally attributed to Numa Pompilius consisted of 12 virtual “months”spanning a total of 355 whole days. This is 0.6328 days longer than 12lunations, but 10.2422 days shorter than the solar year.Intercalation was inevitable to try and reconcile the civil lunar year with thesolar year, in order to make sure that the feast days associated withagricultural labour always fell on the same days each civil year, and more orless remained within the same period during the solar year. As a result of this,each “month” in the intercalated lunar/solar year was no longer tied down to thelunation, but rather fell during a given period in the solar year, with itsparticular solar radiation, meteorological conditions, and advancement of animaland plant life.Introduction of an intercalated lunar/solar year made it necessary to givespecific names to each of the 12 months, rather than using the generic andrather anonymous word “month” for every lunation. Twelve names were allocated tothe 12 months, which are the direct predecessors of our modern-day January,February, March, etc. These names served to bind each month to itsrespective—but still approximate—period during the solar year.The creation of this type of year and its associated names for months is arelatively recent event that took place after the Indo-European diaspora, andthe slow, tortuous transition from hunter gatherers to animal and crop farmers.This explains why modern-day names for months in the various Indo-Europeanlanguages do not derive from a common Indo-European root. As Carl Darling Buckexplains in A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-EuropeanLanguages:> Previous to the widespread, though still incomplete, European adoption of the> Latin names, there was the utmost diversity. In ancient Greece alone there> were dozens of different local calendars (cf. Pauly-Wissowa 10.175 ff.). There> was no agreement between the old Germanic names (even the Old High German> lists vary somewhat), nor between Indic and Iranian, not even between the> Avestan and Old Persian names. Neither the modern Lithuanian literary names, a> recent coinage, nor the diverse older and dialectic forms agree with the> older, now obsolete, Lettic names. Among the native Slavic names, which are> still current except in Russian, there are a few cases of agreement between> Bohemian and Polish, and a few others of common words applied to different> months (e.g. listopad, lit. ‘leaf-falling’, in Serbo-Croatian ‘October’,> Bohemian and Polish ‘November’; Bohemian kveten ‘May’ = Polish kwiecien> ‘April’, originally ‘flower-month’), but, on the whole, great diversity. In> general, the month-names are based upon religious festivals (so most of the> Greek and some of the Celtic and Germanic) or upon some characteristic feature> of the weather, vegetation, harvest, etc. The enumeration and discussion of> these so diverse month-names (even if one chose for the Greek only the Attic> or for Old High German only those prescribed by Charlemagne) would require so> much space that it seems best here to consider only the Latin names and their> spread.1This long and detailed introduction serves to highlight the significance of thefact that four out of eight Etruscan month names correspond to their Old Persiancorollaries.Medieval Latin manuscripts have preserved eight of the names used by theEtruscans, running from March to October. These were handed down through thevarious codices of the Liber Glossarum, which was written prior to the 8thcentury CE, and are confirmed in Papia’s Elementarium from the 11th century CE.In three out of eight cases, surviving documentary evidence is sufficient tomake a satisfactory comparison between late medieval information and thecorresponding Etruscan original from at least a thousand years earlier, duringthe centuries immediately prior to the birth of Christ. Furthermore, “from theomission of the months November-Februarius we may conjecture that the list beganwith March and was already defective when the Liber Glossarum was compiled.”2The names of the Old Persian months have a rather complex history, which we donot have the scope to cover here in detail. For our purposes, it is sufficientto note that some of the names have been preserved solely through the Elamitelanguage, and have been reconstructed in their original Iranian form.3Table 3.1 presents:Table 3.1Names of months in Old Persian and EtruscanOld Persian monthsEtruscan months (from the glossarums)Etruscan months (certified or reconstructed)Roman monthsModern monthsadukanisVelcitanus*velχit(a)naMartiusMarchθura-vaharaCabreas*capr-AprilisAprilθaig(a)rcisAmpiles*anpileMaiusMaygarmapada-AclusAcaleIuniusJune*θur(a)na-bahsisTraneusTuraneQuintilisJuly*garma-bahsis(H)ermius*hermiSextilisAugustbagayadisCeliusCeliSeptemberSeptember*varkazanaXosfer*cezpreOctoberOctoberThis comparison is restricted to the names of the first 8 months, as these arethe only documented names in Etruscan. The names for months in Old Persian arefrom Brandenstein-Mayrhofer 1964, p. 9; the ending -bahsis in the months of Julyand August, which are reconstructed from their Elamite form, is thought to standfor “month”. As noted earlier, Etruscan month names from various glossarums arein Mountdorf 1923, p. 108; certified or reconstructed Etruscan month names arein Caffarello 1975, p. 111.

It is worthwhile looking a little more closely at these points ofcorrespondence.1.Varkazana, the Iranian name for “October”, is certified in line 88, column 3 ofthe huge King Darius (550-486 BCE) inscription at Behistan (modern Bisutun).This modified form of the Elamite name for the eighth month of the year,marqasanas (arahsamna in Akkadian), makes it possible to interpret the name inIranian as a composite of varka- “wolf” and zana- “man, human being”, to producethe meaning “(month) of the Wolf man”.4 It should also be noted that in Rome,October and March were both “martial” months, marking the beginning and end ofthe warring season; it is hardly a revelation that Mars is more closelyassociated with the wolf than with any other animal in creation. 2.The Iranian name for “April”—θuravahara-—is a composite form. The secondelement, vahara-, is the Iranian form of the Indo-European word for “spring”,which becomes εαρ in Greek and ver in Latin. Now let’s turn to Hesychius’slexicon: “boys (are called) *acaletur by the Etruscans.”5 Looking at acomparison of this word with the Etruscan name for “June”, we find a similarexplanation for the name Iunius in Latin as the month of the iuniores, “theyoung(est)”; whether or not this explanation is true or false is moot.Meteorological conditions may potentially be adduced as the reason why the namefor Iranian April became Etruscan June. 3.The first part of the Old Persian name for “July”, *θur(a)na, is probablyconnected with the Sanskrit surah and Avestan sura-, meaning “strong”. Thislatter word is one of the names for the Iranian Venus/Aphrodite: Aredvi, Sura,Anahita, “Moist, Strong, Immaculate”; in Etruscan, Turan is the name of thegoddess of love, the Etruscan Venus/Aphrodite. We should also recall that theRoman word for “July”, Quintilis, mutated over time to become Iulius, from thename of Venus’s son’s son. 4.The first part of the Old Persian noun for “August”, garma-, in Iranian means“hot”, and corresponds to the Sanskrit gharmah and the Latin formus. These threenouns—in Iranian, Sanskrit and Latin—have the same semantic value, and all threecome from the well-represented Indo-European form *g w hermo-. It is also worth bearing in mind that: * Sextilis/August is in the heart of the “hot season”, the “summer”, for which the Latin is aestus,-us, “burning heat”; * garma- in Iranian, is the opposite of aota-, “cold”; * aestas,-atis, “summer, the hot (season)”, in Latin is followed and contrasted by autumnum (sc. tempus), “autumn, the cold season”; * autumnus “ is probably Etruscan in origin” (Ernout-Meillet, s.v.).At least a further two more significant elements may be added to these fourphonetic and semantic correlations regarding the names of the months.The first is that the name of the seventh month in the Old Persian year,bagayadis, is composed of baga-, “God”, and yad-, “worship”, which allocates theancient Iranian month of September/October the value of “(month) of worshippingGod”. The God in question is, in all likelihood, Mithra, as in Pahlavi andPersian the month is called Mihr, “(the month of) Mithra.”6 In Rome, 13September was the most important feast day of the year: Epulum Iovis, “Jupiter’sBanquet”, was the day for worshipping Jupiter Optimus Maximus, theEtruscan/Roman counterpart to Mithra in Iran.The second significant element, both in Rome and in Iran, is that 21 April isnot just any old day: it is “mid-spring day”. In consequence, there is a “solar”New Year’s Day, both in Rome and Iran, on 9 March (see Chap. 7[A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]).If all of these comparisons are correct, we may start drawing some conclusions.The most important, at this stage, is that if there is an unbroken line linkingthe names of the months—the Roman names were copied from Etruscan names, theEtruscan names copied from Old Persian, and the Old Persian names carried overfrom the Mesopotamian names—isn’t this a clue to the distant Eastern origins ofthe Roman calendar? Wouldn’t it be about time to start acknowledging Etruscanculture—at least, Etruscan astronomical knowledge—as an intermediary between theOrient and Rome?7The explanations we shall see later on regarding the solar New Year, the cult ofVenus, the cycle of Saros and, above all, the Roman festivities of Regifugiumand Vestalia, all support this interpretation of available sources.Footnotes1Buck 1988, p. 1010. 2Mountdorf 1923, pp. 108–109, provides and comments on the names of the Etruscanmonths that have survived through the various glossarums.

THE NUMAN CYCLELeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Every other year, the 355 day Numan year was intercalated by 22 or 23 days:odd-numbered years of 355 days alternated with even-numbered years of 377 or378 days. In the third century, Censorinus writes:> Afterwards, Numa […] created 12 months and 355 days, though he was aware that> the Moon completes 12 lunations in 354 days […] When it was decided to add a> 22- or 23-day intercalary month in alternate years to make the civil year the> same length as the natural year, a preference was expressed for February,> between the Terminalia and Regifugium; and so it came to pass for many years> before anybody noticed that civil years were becoming notably longer than> natural years.1It is perfectly straightforward to calculate how much longer civil years werethan natural years: using the aforementioned intercalation, 8 years last2,930 days,2 eight more than the 2,922 days3 that make up 8 solar years. Thisblunder defeated the purpose of the intercalation; namely, to reconcile thelunar and solar years, and the solar year with the civil year.Writing in the fifth century, Macrobius explains:> When this error was discovered too, the following correction was adopted:> every three eight-year cycles were allotted not 90 but 66 intercalated days,> to offset the 24 extra days that accreted over 24 years.4This late and isolated statement5 has been roundly ignored up to the presentday, and yet it is crucial, as it clarifies that Numa’s “error” was to becorrected over a 24 year cycle, sub-divided into three sub-cycles: the first two2,930 days long (8 Numan years of 355 days plus 90 intercalary days, distributedas stated above), and a third 2,906 days long (consisting of 8 years lasting355 days plus 66 intercalary days). For the sake of simplicity, it is easiest torefer to this as the Numan cycle, though Macrobius fails to attribute itexplicitly to the second king of Rome.Macrobius further fails to specify how the 66 days intercalated into the final 8years of the cycle are divided up; nor does he mention the specific years whenthey were inserted. To fill these gaps, we must make two hypotheses: * as in the first two sub-cycles, the 66 intercalatory days were divided into three groups of 22 days each; * the 22 days were inserted in the 3rd, 6th and 8th year of the final sub-cycle, as practiced in cultures such as Babylon and later Athens,6 both of which adopted 8 year cycles.7 Table 4.1 is a reconstruction of the Numan cycle following these two hypotheses.

Tertio quoque octennio ita intercalandos dispensabantdies, ut non nonaginta sed sexaginta sex intercalarent, compensatis viginti etquattuor diebus pro illis qui per totidem annos supra […] numerum creverant. 5Macrobius wrote in the fifth century CE; however, his sources were sound:Svetonius’s de anno Romanorum and Cornelius Labeo’s Fasti. See Marinone 1987, p.45. 6According to the methods set forth in the Ars Eudoxi (see Geminus’s Introductionto the Phenomena, 8.33; no. 1, p. 53 in the Les Belles Lettres edition, editedby G. Aujac): Geminus posits that the intercalation took place in the 3rd, 5thand 8th years. In actual fact, given that by the 16th year the cycle is morethan 16 days ahead of the solar year (16 × 365.2422 = 5,843.8752;5,860 − 5,843.8752 = 16.1248), it would be more reasonable for the intercalatedyears in the third subcycle to be the 4th, 6th and 8th years (see Chap. 15[A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html], no. 1).Another intercalation model would be needed to reconcile the 24 year Numan cyclecited by Macrobius with the 19 year Metonic cycle noted by Livy in 1.19.6.Neither of these options affects the following calculations, given that theastronomical cycles at issue last less than 19 years; this is an issue thatrequires further research. 7The eight-year cycle—known in Greek as an octaeteride—equates 8 solar years (inmodern figures: 2,921.9376 = 365.2422 × 8) to 99 lunations(2,923.5294 = 29.5306 × 99). 84017.6642 days = 11 × 365.2422; 4016.16161 days = 136 × 29.5306.As we shall see (in Chap. 21 [A324790_1_En_21_Chapter.html], especially no. 2),the reason why the Numan cycle is not made up of three equal portions numbering2,922 days each, obtained by intercalating alternately 20 and 21 days duringeven-numbered years, is precisely this: the first 11 years of the cycle mustmaintain the same number of days as 11 solar years. 93,661.7944 days = 124 × 29.5306."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_55. THE NUMAN YEAR AND CYCLE, AND THE MOTION OF THE MOONLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The intercalations in the Numan cycle disrupt any relationship between theMoon’s phases and the day of the month. The Calends were not set by the PontifexMinor’s—i.e. younger—first sighting of the crescent Moon; the Nones do notindicate days when the Moon reaches the first quarter; and the Ides do notcorrespond to the full Moon.1The months of the Numan year also fail to mirror lunations: * If the first crescent Moon (usually 1.5 days2 after the new Moon) is spotted at the beginning of a 31 day month, at the next Calends the Moon is 2.97 days old, and already more than 36° from the Sun; * If the month is 29 days long, at the next Calends the Moon is 0.97 days old, and just 11.8° from the Sun (and far too close to be observed); * If the month is 28 days long, at the next Calends the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun. This is a particularly propitious astral configuration for relations between the micro- and macrocosms, which may explain why February, the only month that is 28 days long, is dedicated to the Manes 3—i.e. to those mortals who (temporarily) reside in the macrocosm.However, an understanding of the Moon’s synodical motion may be inferred fromthe 16 day interval between the (theoretical) full Moon, the Ides, and the firstcrescent (once again, theoretical) of the following Calends, which is the samefor all months save February.4 After 16 days, the Moon is approximately 195°from the Sun;5 if, on the first of these 16 days, the practically full Moon hasjust emerged from opposition with the Sun, 16 days later it is just 15° beyondconjunction with the Sun, and therefore about to reappear as a crescent.According to the authors of antiquity, the reason why the lengths of months andof the year were rounded up was a preference for odd numbers over even numbers.6In actual fact, the twelve synodic months total 354.3672 days, while thirteensidereal months equal 355.1808: the 355 days of the Numan year are closer inlength to thirteen sidereal months than twelve synodic months. If the yearlasted 354 days, at the following new year the Moon would be 0.367 days youngerthan it had been on the preceding new year. If we establish the start of theyear with the appearance of the first crescent at the Calends of March, by thefollowing new year’s day the Moon would be 1.133 days old: just 13.8° from theSun, the earliest crescent would still be invisible and the year would not havebeen deemed to have commenced.7And yet the first eleven months of the Numan year total 327 days: 1 February isthe 328th day after 1 March. It follows that on 1 February the Moon will havecompleted almost exactly twelve sidereal revolutions; at the same time of night,it is in the same position as it was with respect to the fixed stars on thepreceding 1 March.8 This is a clear demonstration of the understanding of theMoon’s sidereal motion.Intercalated Numan years did not respect lunations either: * In 355 days, the Moon travels 4,677.62° and is 2.38° from completing its 13th sidereal revolution; it is 0.633 days old in the 13th synodic revolution, and around 7.7° from the Sun;9—In 377 days, the Moon travels 4,967.5° and is 72.5° from completing its 14th sidereal revolution; it is 22.633 days old in the 13th synodic revolution, and around 276° from the Sun, just past negative quadrature;10 * In 378 days, the Moon travels 4,980.68° and is 59.3° from completing its 14th sidereal revolution; it is 23.633 days old in the 13th synodic revolution, and around 288° from the Sun, in the negative quintile.11From this data, it is possible to approximate the movement of the Moon withrespect to the fixed stars and the Sun from one year to the next, depending onhow long the preceding year lasted.At the end of the entire 8,766-day-long Numan cycle, the Moon has travelled just304° of the 321st sidereal revolution, 305° of the 297th synodic revolution, andis around 25 days old. It completes the 321st sidereal revolution and the 297thsynodic revolution almost simultaneously: the former at 8,770.2336 days and thesecond at 8,770.5882 days12 after the beginning of the cycle.A revised form of intercalation between one Numan cycle and the next, or betweenmultiple Numan cycles, was required for the Moon’s motion to be restored toharmony with respect to the Sun’s movement.Footnotes1Contrary to Macrobius’s assertion in Sat. 1.15.9 and 15. 2This value, corresponding to a distance of around 18° (= 1.5 × 12.1908°) fromthe Sun, is the one adopted in Babylon (Schiaparelli 1997–1998, Vol. III, pp.121–233; the figure—on p. 225—is taken from Epping-Strassmeyer’s Astronomischesaus Babylon, pp. 18–24, and derives from more than 30 observations during allseasons of the year covered therein). In reality, the interval betweenconjunction and the “apparent new Moon”, as Schiaparelli refers to the firstvisible crescent, is one of the most variable, predominantly owing to theirregularity of lunar motion, the season, and the latitude from which theobservation is being undertaken. Nevertheless, the indicated value matchesastrological tradition sufficiently closely: “the moon ‘rises’ when it is 15°from the sun”, writes Rhetorius, de planetarium natura ac vi (see CCAG VII,pages 213–224; cited in Bezza 1995, vol. 1, pp. 72–86). 3On February, the month of the Manes, see Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.13.3 andJoannes Lydus, de mensibus, 3.10.The figures in the text are the result of the following calculations:2.97 days = 32.50 − 29.53; 36° = 2.97 × 12.1908°; 0.97 days = 30.50 − 29.53;11.8° = 0.97 × 12.1908°; 29.53 days ~ 1.5 + 28 days. 4Macrobius tells us in Saturnalia, 1.15.7: “It was believed correct that, everymonth, the Ides fell on the 9th day after the Nones, and it was thus establishedthat 16 days should elapse between the Ides and the following Calends, Omnibustamen mensibus ex die nonarum idus nono die repraesentari placuit, et inter idusac sequentes kalendas constitutum est sedecim dies esse numerandos.” 5195.0528° = 16 × 12.1908°. 6On odd and even numbers, see, among others, Censorinus, de die natali, 20.4. 7These figures were calculated as follows: 354.367 days = 12 × 29.5306; absoluteerror + 0.633; percentage error 0.179 %; 355.181 days = 13 × 27.3216; a.e.−0.181; p.e. 0.051 %. 0.367 days = 354.367 − 354; 1,133 days = 1.5 − 0.367;13.8° = 1.133 × 12.1908°. 8These figures were calculated as follows: 12 × 27.3216 = 327.8592 days.For Mayan knowledge of an 82-day cycle (= ¼ of 328 days), see Aveni 2000, p. 47. 9The figures were calculated as follows: 4,677.62° = 355 days × 13.1764°;4,680° = 13 × 360°; 2.38° = 4,680° − 4,677.62°; 0.633 days = 355 − 354.367; ca.7.7° = 0.633 × 12.1908°.From hereon in, only the results of similar calculations will be presented. 10−84° = 276° − 360°. 11−72° = 288° − 360°. 128,770.2336 = 321 × 27.3216; 8,770.5882 = 297 × 29.5306."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_66. THE NUMAN CYCLE AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SUN, THE MOON AND VENUSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]To some degree of precision, the 8,766 day Numan cycle may be reconciled withthe movements of the Sun, the Moon and Venus (see Table 6.1).Table 6.1The Numan cycle and the movements of the Sun, the Moon and VenusCelestial bodyNo. of cycles × period = daysAbsolute errorPercentageerror (%)Sun(tropical year)24 × 365.2422 = 8,765.81 days+ 0.19 days0.00217Moon(synodic month)297 × 29.5306 = 8,770.59 days− 4.59 days0.0523Moon(sidereal month)321 × 27.3216 = 8,770.23 days− 4.23 days0.0482Moon(draconitic month)322 × 27.2122 = 8,762.33 days+ 3.67 days0.0419Moon(anomalistic month)318 × 27.5546 = 8,762.36 days+ 3.64 days0.0415Venus(synodic period)15 × 583.92 = 8,758.8 days+ 7.2 days0.0822Venus(sidereal period)39 × 224.63 = 8,760.57 days+ 5.43 days0.062Table 6.1 shows that the Numan cycle in particular respects the movement of theSun. It is sufficiently precise for the civil year to gain less than one day onthe solar year over the course of five cycles, equivalent to 120 years.1 Inactual fact, the margin of error with regard to the Sun’s motion—ca. 4 h 33′36′′ every 24 years—is 2.5 × less than that of the Metonic cycle,2 which wasintroduced in Athens in 432 BCE; the margin of error with regard to the Moon’smotion is around 12 times greater. The margin of error with regard to the motionof Venus is a little higher without being excessive.In conclusion, the individual years of the Numan cycle—which are either 355, 377or 378 days long—do not correspond to solar years; the individual months in theNuman year—which are either 31, 29 or 28 days long—do not correspond to thesynodic months; however, as a whole, the entire 8,766 day Numan cyclecorresponds very well to the motion of the Sun, if less well with the motion ofthe Moon. As for Venus, it is relatively easy to associate its location withrespect to the Sun (see Chap. 9 [A324790_1_En_9_Chapter.html]) with thefestivities of the Numan year over an entire Numan cycle—that is to say, during15 synodic periods of the planet—through an approximation comparable to that ofthe Numan years and months with respect to solar years and lunar months.Schiaparelli explains in his commentary on data discovered on Mesopotamiantablets referring to the motion of Venus, in which he distinguishes betweenObservations (recordings of phenomena observed) and Ephemeris (the results of“purely arithmetic labour”):> In all likelihood, I would say that the Ephemeris were based on more imperfect> elements and made prior to the Observations: this would have given observers> the background to make observations themselves, by means of an approximate> prediction for the period in which they could expect a given phenomenon to> occur. The same procedure continues to be used on a regular basis by modern> observers. Without spadework of this sort, it would be impossible, or at least> extremely laborious and difficult, to undertake the precise observation of an> eclipse or the return of certain comets, not to mention the passage of a> heavenly body over the Meridian.3To recap: the Roman festivities during the age of its earliest kings—theso-called Feriale antiquissimum (see Chap. 2 [A324790_1_En_2_Chapter.html])—werethe Ephemeris of the nameless inventor of the Numan year and cycle, as thefollowing calculations bear out.Footnotes18,766 × 5 = 43,830 days; 365.2422 × 120 = 43,829.064; 43,830 -43,829.064 = 0.936 days. 2The Metonic cycle equates 19 solar years with 235 lunations.

THE SOLAR NEW YEAR ON MARCH 8 OR 9Leonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The intercalary days were inserted after the feast of Terminalia on 23 February.The feast was thus named> because this day is set as the last day of the year; for the twelfth month was> February, and when the extra month is inserted the last five days are taken> off the twelfth month.1The only logical conclusion we may infer from these three facts—(1) that theintercalation helped to offset the difference between the lunar and solar years;(2) the solar year is 365 days long; and (3) 22 or 23 intercalated days areinserted after the “last day” of the lunar year—is that the solar year endingwith the 22nd or 23rd intercalated day begins on the preceding 8 or 9 of March.2A number of things change if the solar year begins on 8 or 9 March, and the newMoon or first crescent coincides with New Year’s day. These modifications clearup at least three issues:1.45 days later, on 21 April, is the Parilia and Foundation of Rome festival, when“springtime is half run”3; 2.On the Nones of July, four lunations after the solar new year, comes another newMoon, at which “an eclipse of the Sun with the Nonae Capratinae, a day stillreserved for solemn celebration”4 may be observed; Plutarch mentions this whenrecalling the celestial event that occurred on Romulus’ death; 3.The new Moon of the Nones of July also makes it clear why we hear assertionssuch as “Some (say) that the Nones (is so called) for the new Moon, because theymark the start of the lunation”, or “The Nones are thusly called […] because,just as the Calends of January are known as the ‘new year’ of the new Sun, theyare known as the ‘new month’ of the new Moon.”5 If the calendar year was not intercalated, the solar year beginning on 8 Marchwould end on 17 March the following year, during the feast of the Liberalia.This was the moment when the God Liber, i.e. the Sun,> as the days grow longer, at the spring equinox, increases his energies like an> adolescent, and is portrayed in the guise of a young man.6On that same day, the cycle of adolescence drew to a close for Roman males,marking the beginning of iuventus, or “youth”. With tirocinium or “training” nowover, they donned the manly toga, were eligible for the army and, mostimportantly, were presented to the population—on the feast day of 17 March—asLiberi, or “free men”, who had come of age.If we do the sums, it becomes apparent that the new Moon falls on around 8 or 9March, while the first crescent appears around 9 or 10 March, only in years 6,15 and 16 of a Numan cycle that commenced with a new Moon or, better, with atotal eclipse of the Sun on 1 March in year one (see Chap. 1[A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]). The last of these years matches Aulus Gellius’sstatement well:> Servius Tullius, the king […] considered male sons up to the age of 16 to be> ‘boys’; from 16 onwards, he believed them old enough to serve the State,> enlisted them as soldiers […]7Footnotes1Varro, de lingua latina, 6.13: […] quod is dies extremus constitutus: duodecimenim mensis fuit Februarius et cum intercalatur inferiores quinque diesduodecimo demuntur mense.The expression cum intercalatur should be translated as “every time that theintercalation is undertaken”, rather than “when the extra month is inserted”. Weshall see later (see Chap. 16 [A324790_1_En_16_Chapter.html]) how, why and inwhat way “the final 5 days are taken off”. 2In my book The Feasts of Venus (“Le feste di Venere”) I merely considered the8th of the month. I have since realized that this line of reasoning applies toboth days, considering that for the Romans the day started at midnight, whilethe Etruscans counted their days from midday (see Servius, Ad Aen. 5.738 and6.535).9 March is an ancilia moventur day (see Chap. 22[A324790_1_En_22_Chapter.html]), and shares the same nundinal letter (A) as day1. 3Columella, de re rustica, 11.2.36: ver bipertitur.21 April is the feast of “mid-spring” both in Rome and in Ancient Iran, wherethe year began on 8 March and the months were 30 days long.

THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON AND VENUS AND THE LANGUAGE OF MYTHLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The Goddess Fortuna—who was imported to Rome by her protégé Servius Tullius—haslunar characteristics (Fig. 8.1): she is as nocturnal, transitory and changeableas “the night jewel”.1 It was generic “great good fortune” that the “conceptionand generation of Romulus” engendered “a solar eclipse, with the Sun in exactconjunction with the Moon for the length of time that the God Mars remained inconjunction with the mortal Silvia” (see Chap. 1 [A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]).It was also the Goddess Fortuna in person who, at night, awakened the Capitolinegeese; it was this selfsame Goddess who visited the slave-turned-king ServiusTullius, “dropping down into his room through a small window”, and who “was wontto enter his house at night-time by a small window, hence the gate bears thename of Fenestella (“the Little Window”).”2 And that’s not the half of it.A324790_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg]Fig. 8.1Fortuna/Tyche, detail Marble, II-III century CE, Tomis/Constanta–ConstantaMuseum of National History. Photo by Cristian Chirita–Wikimedia CommonsThe incredibly complex motion of the Moon (see Chaps. 17[A324790_1_En_17_Chapter.html], 18 [A324790_1_En_18_Chapter.html] and 19[A324790_1_En_19_Chapter.html]) goes through one particularly complicated momentwhen, as it wanes, the Moon inexorably closes in on the Sun, goes intoconjunction with the new Moon, and re-emerges as the first crescent. In thelanguage of myth, this rapid succession of the Moon’s changing aspects isembodied by three divine figures: Fortuna and her two handmaidens, Necessitas,who precedes her, and Spes, the last of the Goddesses.They are represented in the heavens respectively by the new Moon, the waningMoon and the waxing Moon, and in Ancient Rome replicated the three Greek Graces(Fig. 8.2). Fortuna, the central figure in the group, turns her back—the caecumcorpus—and, more specifically, the rotundities which, in the Eternal city, tothis day, continue to be highly esteemed as a talisman. In Rome, caeca nox wasthe “dark night” over which Fortuna caeca watched, the “dark Moon”, the “Moonthat fails to illuminate”, or in other words, the new Moon.A324790_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg]Fig. 8.2The three Graces, or Fortuna and her handmaidens. In the middle, with her backto us, Fortuna, represented in the sky by the New Moon; on each side are her twohandmaidens, Necessitas, the waning Moon, and Spes, the waxing Moon (fromIllustrazione de’ Monumenti Scelti Borghesiani di E. Q. Visconti, Roma 1821)The waxing Moon was also known as Obsequens—literally “that which goes behind”,and figuratively as “obsequious, obedient, propitious”—because only the waxingMoon placidly follows the Sun to dip below the horizon at sunset. The waningMoon acquires Fortuna’s other epithet, Respiciens, “that which looks backwards”:night after night, the waning Moon alone moves from west to east, its “humpfacing east” while its face and gaze points westwards, backwards, towards thepart of the sky from whence it came (Fig. 8.3). The former and the latter are amirror image.A324790_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.gif]Fig. 8.3The moon waxing and waning over an entire lunation.

When visible in the morning, preceding therising Sun, it takes on the name Lucifer, “bringer of light”. When it is visiblein the evening, following the setting Sun, it takes on the name Vesper, or“evening (star)”. In this latter case, the planet behaves like the waxing Moon,as the heavenly representative of the divinity, and is paired with the epithetObsequens (Fig. 8.4).A324790_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.gif]Fig. 8.4The planet Venus as the evening star, Vesper.

The dots indicate the position of the planet with respect tothe Sun at two-week intervals (from Aveni 2000)When, on the contrary, the Goddess looks behind herself—more or less as FortunaRespiciens does—it takes on the name Kallipyge,3 “having shapely buttocks”(Fig. 8.5), and is represented in the sky by the planet which, in its retrogradeor clockwise motion (Fig. 8.6), retraces a portion of the path it has justtaken.A324790_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg]Fig. 8.5Venus Callipyge posing as Fortuna Respiciens.

THE MOTION OF VENUSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The planet Venus is the brightest body in the sky after the Sun and the Moon.Venus is an internal planet, that is to say, its entire orbit lies closer to theSun than the Earth’s.Viewed from the Earth, Venus is in one of four configurations specific to theplanet (Fig. 9.1):A324790_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 9.1The motion of Venus around the Sun viewed from the Earth. Viewed from the Earth,the planet Venus takes on four specific configurations with respect to the Sun:(1) lower conjunction; (2) greatest western elongation; (3) higher conjunction;and (4) greatest eastern elongation * in lower conjunction with the Sun, when the planet is between the Earth and the Sun, and is not visible; * at its greatest western elongation with the Sun, when the planet is at its greatest angular distance from the Sun to the West, and is visible in the morning, to the East, before the Sun rises; * in higher conjunction with the Sun, when the planet is behind the Sun, and is not visible; * at its greatest eastern elongation with the Sun, when the planet is at its greatest angular distance from the Sun to the East, and is visible in the evening, to the West, after the Sun sets.Venus completes a full revolution around the Sun—in astronomical terms, itssynodic period—in roughly 584 days. The planet takes 71 days to move from lowerconjunction to its greatest western elongation; it takes 221 days to move intohigher conjunction; 221 days later it moves from higher conjunction to itsgreatest eastern elongation, and then 71 days after that, it reaches lowerconjunction: 71 + 221 + 221 + 71 = 584 days.The planet’s revolution around the Sun may be described in other terms(Fig. 9.2):A324790_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.gif]Fig. 9.2The motion of Venus around the Sun viewed from the Earth. Viewed from the Earth,the planet Venus: (1) around 5 days after lower conjunction appears to the Eastin the morning sky—heliacal rising —and remains visible as Lucifer for around255 days; (2) disappears—heliacal setting—behind the Sun on average for around62 days; (3) reappears to the West in the evening sky—vespertine or achronicrising—and remains visible as Hesperus for around 257 days; (4) disappears onceagain—vespertine setting—around 5 days before lower conjunction, on completionof its synodic period * around 5 or so days after lower conjunction, the planet first appears to the East in the early morning sky—known as its heliacal rising—and remains visible for around 255 days: preceding the Sun at dawn, like Lucifer, it moves away to the West, before drawing in closer once more; * it then disappears—its heliacal setting—behind the Sun for, on average, 62 days during higher conjunction; * after this, the planet reappears to the West in the evening sky—at its vespertine or achronic rising—where it remains visible for around 257 days: following the Sun at sunset, like Hesperus, it moves away to the East, before drawing in closer once more (see Fig. 8. 4 [A324790_1_En_8_Chapter.html]); * it then disappears once more—its vespertine setting—around 5 days before lower conjunction, until it completes its synodic period: 5 + 255 + 62 + 257 + 5 = 584 days.1 And so the cycle continues, from one synodic period to the next.At the end of five successive synodic periods, during which, viewed from theEarth, the planet makes a series of five different but equal elegant sweeps asthe Morning Star and the Evening Star (Fig. 9.3),2 Venus returns to its initialposition with respect both to the Sun and the fixed stars (Fig. 9.4). This isbecause the roughly 584 days that make up Venus’s synodic period are in a ratioof 8 ÷ 5 with the roughly 365 days of the solar year.3A324790_1_En_9_Fig3a_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig3a_HTML.gif]A324790_1_En_9_Fig3b_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig3b_HTML.gif]Fig. 9.3A series of 12 subsequent intervals of Venus’s appearance.

Panel (1) first morning appearanceinterval; (2) first evening appearance interval; (3) second morning appearanceinterval, etc. The pattern is repeated after five pairs of appearance intervals,each lasting around 256 days. Thus, panel 11 repeats panel 1, and so onA324790_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.gif]Fig. 9.4Two subsequent intervals of Venus’s appearance as the evening star, 8 yearsapart.

The numbers 2, 3, etc.indicate the position of the planet on 1 February, 1 March, etc. in 1994(circles) and in 2002 (squares)In consequence, at the end of eight solar years, just as Venus is completing itsfifth synodic period and is returning for the fifth time to its initial positionwith respect to the Sun, the Sun is returning for the eighth time to its initialposition with respect to the fixed stars, and Venus consequently also returns toits initial position with regard to the fixed stars (see Table 6. 1[A324790_1_En_6_Chapter.html]).4 This is the reason for the Venus pentagram(Fig. 9.5), the five-pointed star that indicates the five constellations of theZodiac and the five moments during the year when, viewed from the Earth, theplanet returns to the same configuration.A324790_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.gif]Fig. 9.5The Venus pentagram.

Itfeatures on countless national flags, of which the US flag is the best known. Itserves as the heroic “star” in the Soviet Union, may be found on the star-shapedepaulettes of Italian military uniforms, and is the so-called Stellone, “the BigStar”, shining at the centre of the banner of the Italian Republic, keeping awatchful eye on the nation’s destiny.As early as in Babylonian times, Venus the Evening Star was contrasted withVenus the Morning Star. The former represented a feminine deity who promoted andprotected love; the latter, a male deity who promoted and protected war. Thiscounterposition continued in Ancient Rome: Venus/Hesperus protected weddings;Venus/Mater Matuta/Lucifer protected heroes, especially Furius Camillus.But by far the planet’s most important duty was, along with Fortuna/the Moon, toprotect conception.6Footnotes1These values are a rounded average of modern values for five consecutive synodicperiods of Venus. Mesopotamian tables present very similar values for theanalogous positions of Venus (see Swerdlow 1998, pp. 218–219). 2The difference in these motions arises from the way in which the planet and theEarth move, and the way that the plane of Venus’s orbit is inclined with respectto the plane of the Earth’s orbit. 35 × 584 = 8 × 365 = 2,920. 4In other words, the 584 days of Venus’s synodic period correspond to around(584 ÷ 365.25 =) 1.6 years or (1.6 × 12 =) 19.2 months. It follows that oncompletion of one of Venus’s synodic periods, viewed from the Earth, the planetmakes a full revolution of all 12 signs of the Zodiac and starts anotherrevolution of (19.2 − 12 =) 7.2 signs, equal to (7.2 × 30° =) 216°.At the end of the fifth synodic period, after around (584 × 5 =) 2,920 days, thenumber of signs of the Zodiac it has traversed is now (7.2 × 5 =) 36, and thenumber of degrees (216° × 5 =) 1,080°. Viewed from the Earth, Venus hascompleted 5 plus (1,080° ÷ 360° =) 3, i.e. 8 revolutions with respect to theZodiac. In the meantime, however, the Earth has also completed 5 revolutionsaround the sun. At this point, Venus has completed a total of (8 + 5 =) 13revolutions with respect to the fixed stars.These same figures should be multiplied by three to correspond to the 24 solaryears that make up the Numan cycle. 5If this is indeed so, Venus pentagrams on early seventh century Etruscan kraters(see Figs. 9.10 and 9.11) precede by one or two hundred years the attribution toPythagoras (ca. 580/70-480 BCE) or Parmenides (515-after 450 BCE) of theknowledge that “Hesperus and Lucifer are one and the same” (Diogenes Laertius,Lives of the Philosophers, 9.23). 6For more on Venus/Hesperus, protector of weddings, and Venus/MaterMatuta/Lucifer, protector of conception, see Chaps. 10[A324790_1_En_10_Chapter.html] and 11 [A324790_1_En_11_Chapter.html].On Mater Matuta, protector of Furius Camillus, see Dumézil 1981, passim, thoughin any event this author considers Matuta to be the Goddess of Dawn; with regardto the identification of Matuta with Lucifer/Venus at dawn, see Chap. 10[A324790_1_En_10_Chapter.html] and, at more length, Magini 1996, pp. 34−46, andin particolar Appendix 1, Furius Camillus, the protégé of Matuta, pp. 101–104.For American Indians, Venus/Lucifer also looked kindly on warriors; the Siouxnicknamed General Custer the “son of the morning star”."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1010.

In the weddingrite—described by Ovid in glorious detail—the Goddess of Love is the idealprototype for the bride: first, her statue is undressed, then it is washed,dried, dressed again, decorated, and festooned in jewellery by the faithful, whoserve as handmaidens, before making an offering of flowers:> Duly do ye worship the goddess, ye Latin mothers and brides> and ye, too, who wear not the fillets and long robe.> Take off the golden necklaces from the marble neck of the goddess;> take off her gauds; the goddess must be washed from top to toe.> Then dry her neck and restore to it her golden necklaces;> now give her other flowers, now give her the fresh-blown rose.Next, the faithful, now fully qualified as betrothed, undressed for a commongroup bath—a classical fertility rite—during which incense is offered to VirileFortune, for whom:> […] every blemish on the naked body is plain to see;> Virile Fortune undertakes to conceal the blemish and to hide it from the men,> and this she does for the consideration of a little incense.Finally, the women must make haste and drink> poppy pounded with snowy milk> and liquid honey squeezed from the comb;> when Venus was first escorted to her eager spouse,> she drank that draught: from that time she was a bride.4Ex illo tempore nupta fuit, “from that time she was a bride”: repeating every 1April the gesture once performed by the Goddess, the faithful “re-actualize”—asEliade would say—the prototypical event fossilized in the words of myth and thegestures of rite: “From that moment onwards” they too become brides (Fig. 10.2),even if it is true that Venus fails to put in an appearance as the Evening Starevery single 1 April, but only on 1 April of what were known as “ideal years”.A324790_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg]Fig. 10.2The Secundus and Projecta wedding casket.

Silver, 28 × 55 cm, from the Esquiline, late fourthcentury CE—London, British Museum (from Bianchi Bandinelli 1970) Courtesy:Gallimard, ParisThe most auspicious day for conception was 11 June, the day of the Matralia—thefestival of Mater Matuta and Fortuna—whose name derives from the bonae matres,“women capable of having children” or, better, “women (given) the gift ofmaternity”.Ovid explains that this day marks the anniversary of the wondrous conception ofking Servius Tullius (578–535 BCE), who was to found temples to both goddesses(Fig. 10.3) and decree a common feast day:A324790_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.gif]Fig. 10.3The twin temples of Fortuna and Mater Matuta: a Republican era reconstruction.Founded by Servius Tullius, this double sanctuary lies at the southernmostportion of the base of the Capitol, near Porta Carmentalis. (from Coarelli 1988)> There, on this day, it is said, Servius [Tullius] consecrated> with his own sceptered hands a temple to Mother Matuta.5Tullius’ mother, Ocresia, a slave to Queen Tanaquilla, was made pregnant by theflames in the fireplace, that is to say by the God Vulcan, who was the truefather of the servant destined to become the king of Rome. This is how the poetrecounts the tale:> For the father of [Servius] Tullius was Vulcan,> his mother was the beautiful Ocresia of Corniculum.> After performing with her the due sacred rites, Tanaquil> ordered Ocresia to pour wine on the hearth, which had been adorned.> There among the ashes there was, or seemed to be, the shape> of the male organ; but rather the shape was really there.> Ordered by her mistress, the captive Ocresia sat down at the hearth.> She conceived Servius, who thus was begotten of seed from heaven.6At both of these feasts, from their places in the heavens two feminine deitieswatch over and protect the faithful on Earth. At the Calends of April, thegoddesses are Venus Verticordia and Fortuna Virilis; on 11 June, Mater Matutaand Fortuna.Fortuna is represented in the sky by the Moon (see Chap. 8[A324790_1_En_8_Chapter.html] and Fig. 8.1), a heavenly body that is no lessvariable and changeable than the Goddess.Venus and Mater Matuta (Fig. 10.4) are both represented by the planet Venus.A324790_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.jpg]Fig. 10.4Mater Matuta.

Author: Edisonblus—Wikimedia CommonsIn the most propitious of years, on 1 April, Venus is Hesperus, the EveningStar; on 11 June, Mater Matuta is Lucifer, the Morning Star. Ovid opens hiscommentary on the feast of Matralia thus:> […] and the watchful Morning Star comes forth the eastern waters.7As matutinus, he is the natural opposite of vespertinus; Matuta is the reversedimage of Vesper.In the Numan calendar, 71 days elapsed between the Calends of April and 11June—29 days in April, 31 in May and 11 in June: counting inclusively,29 + 31 + 11 = 71 days. This figure corresponds to the 71 days that the planetVenus takes to travel from lower conjunction with the Sun to its greatestwestern elongation (see Chap. 9 and Fig. 9. 1 [A324790_1_En_9_Chapter.html]). Inthe first of these positions, viewed from the Earth, the planet appears to besuperimposed over the Sun, and is therefore invisible; in the second position,the planet lies at its greatest western elongation from the Sun, equivalent toaround 47°, and rises over the horizon, as the Morning Star, around 3 h beforethe Sun.Concordances between the movements of the planet Venus in the sky and feast dayson Earth for the women of Rome don’t end there: * 75 days8 before the Calends of April is the feast of Carmenta Postvorta, on 15 January of the preceding year, when the planet is at its greatest eastern elongation from the Sun, visible as the Evening Star for up to 3 h after the Sun sets; * 222 days9 before that is the feast of Carna on the Calends of June, when the planet is in higher conjunction with the Sun, and is not visible from Earth; * 585 days10 after 11 June—when the year is intercalated—is the feast of Carmenta Antevorta on 11 January of the following year, when Venus completes a synodic cycle and once more reaches its greatest western elongation with respect to the Sun, and rises over the horizon as the Morning Star around 3 h before the Sun (see Table 10.1).

But this is yet to be confirmedIf we take conception the day of the Matralia, on 11 June, as our startingpoint, on 13 January—the mid-point between the two Carmenta feast days—is the210th day,11 corresponding to the 7th month of pregnancy; this is the momentthat the unborn child begins to turn around in the mother’s womb and assume themost natural and least perilous position for birth.The two Carmentas, Antevorta (or Prorsa) and Postvorta, lie in relationship tothe two positions of the foetus, when either the feet or the head are facingdown. Gellius, developing what Varro had to say, makes the following unequivocalstatement:> When therefore, contrary to nature, they [babies in the womb; author’s note]> are turned upon their feet, and retained in the womb, with their arms> extended, women are delivered with great difficulty.> For the purpose of averting this calamity, altars were erected in Rome at the> two temples of the Carmenta, one of which was called Postvorta and the other> Prorsa, and which protect and take their names from the different births,> natural and contrary to nature.12Censorinus, another valuable source, notes that, according toChaldean/Pythagorean doctrine, this length of time coincides with the earliestpossible date that a foetus may be born:> Ready in less time, the seven-month child leaves the womb 210 days after> conception.13Footnotes1Vergil, Bucolica, 8.29–30: ‘Mopse, novas incidas faces, tibi ducitur uxor; /sparge, marite, nuces, tibi deserit Hesperus Oetam.’ “To leave Mount Oeta” means“the night is falling”. 2Claudian, de raptu Proserpinae, 2.361–2: Iam suus inferno processerat Hesperusorbi: / ducitur in thalamum virgo. 3Catullus, Carmina, 62.1–32: ‘Vesper adest, iuvenes, consurgite: Vesper Olympo /exspectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit. / Surgere iam tempus, iam pinguislinquere mensas, / iam veniet virgo, iam dicetur hymenaeus […] ’/‘ Cernitisinnuptae, iuvenes?

Quoted here are lines 627–634: Namque pater TulliVolcanus, Ocresia mater / praesignis facie Corniculana fuit. / Hanc secumTanaquil sacris de more peractis / iussit in ornatum fundere vina focum: / hicinter cineres obsceni forma virilis / aut fuit aut visa est, sed fuit illamagis. / Iussa foco captiva sedet: conceptus ab illa / Servius a caelo seminagentis habet.Note that the Latin praesignis does not mean “beautiful” but “foreboding”. 7Ovid, Fasti, 6.474: […] et vigil Eois Lucifer exit aquis. 8In Roman times, the practice was to count inclusively: 15 days in January + 28in February + 31 in March + 1 in April = 75 days. 929 days in June + 178 in July, August, September, October, November andDecember + 15 in January = 222 days. 1019 days in June + 257 days up to 28 February = 276; 276 + 309 days from 1 Marchto 11 January = 585 days. 1119 days in June + 178 in July, August, September, October, November andDecember + 13 in January = 210. 12Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 16.16: Quando igitur contra naturam forteconversi in pedes brachiis plerumque diductis retineri solent aegriusque tuncmulieres enituntur, huius pericoli deprecandi gratia arae statutae sunt Romaeduabus Carmentibus, quarum altera ‘Postvorta’ cognominatast, ‘Prorsa’ altera arecti perversique partus et potestate et nomine. 13Censorinus, de die natali, 11.2: […] alterum minorem, quem vocant septemmestrem,qui decimetducentesimo die post conceptionem exeat ab utero.

THE LENGTH OF PREGNANCY, THE SOLAR NEW YEAR, AND THE FEASTS OF MATRONALIAAND LIBERALIALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Censorinus informs us that, according to the same Chaldean/Pythagorean doctrine,the standard length of a pregnancy is associated with astronomical data. Ittakes 273 point something days, or ¾ of the solar year, to travel fromconception to birth:> Given that the Sun circumnavigates the Zodiac in 365 days and a handful of> hours, if we take away a fourth, that is to say 91 days and a few hours, we> may calculate that the Sun travels three quarters of the way round its orbit> in a little less than 274 days, until it reaches a position from which it> looks towards the point of conception in quadrature.According to the same Censorinus, Pythagoras points out that this is an odd, andtherefore an auspicious number> as it comprises an odd number of whole days plus, to complete the period, a> portion of the following day which, it should be noted, is still less than a> whole day.1It follows that if the ideal conception takes place on 11 June, on the feast ofthe Matralia, the ideal day to be born coincides with the solar new year on 9March (see Chap. 7 [A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]), 273.25 days2 later.In Rome, no public feast was held on 9 March; the birth of a common citizenremained a private event. But two feasts were held one nundina before and onenundina after 9 March.3One nundina before the date of birth, on 1 March, pregnancy completes the 9thand enters the 10th lunation. As Macrobius explains, this is the moment when “inthe uterus the fertilized seed ripens into life in the 10th month, retained bydelicate natural bonds until it issues into the light.”4 This is the momentwhen, approaching the start of labour and all of the attendant dangers for themother and newborn infant, we have the feast of Matronalia, which kicks off thelunar year at the Calends of the first month of the year. This particular feastis for matronae:> Matrona is the name given to a woman married to a husband, provided that thus> she remains, even if she has no children; she is so called from the word> mater, referring to the fact that, though she has not yet become a ‘mother’,> she has the hope and bears the promise of becoming one soon.5On this day, Latin mothers—“for in their travail they both fight andpray”—journeyed to the Iuno Lucina temple on the Esquiline Hill and invoked thegoddess with the words:> ‘Thou, Lucina, hast bestowed on us the light (lucem) of life;> […]‘thou dost hear the prayer of women in travail.’By 1 March a matrona, who had conceived on the preceding 11 June and hascompleted the 9th lunation of pregnancy would be preparing to give birth a fewdays later, on the 9th of the month. On the verge of realizing “the hope andpromise of motherhood”, she follows the instructions chronicled by the poet:> […] let her who is with child unbind her hair before she prays,> in order that the goddess may gently unbind her teeming womb.6One nundina after the date of birth, on 17 March, is the moment that males bornon 9 March undergo purification and naming rituals.7 This dies lustricus,“purification day”, coincides with the feast of Liberalia on 17 March, when thebirthday of those born at the same time and in the same age group (see Chap. 7[A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]) is celebrated. The feast of Liberalia—the day onwhich males reach the age of majority—should also be regarded as an anniversaryof the dies lustricus of those born as part of the same age group.The Matronalia on 1 March, the solar New Year’s day on 9 March and the Liberaliaon 17 March—all of which are feasts in preparation for labour, birth, andname-giving for male newborn babies—are nine days’ apart, and therefore all havethe same nundinal letter A.Table 11.1 summarizes what we have seen thus far (and, moreover, what we shallsee later in Chaps. 14 [A324790_1_En_14_Chapter.html], 15[A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html] and 24 [A324790_1_En_24_Chapter.html]) regardingthe relationship between the motion of heavenly bodies and life landmarks onEarth, as marked by festivities throughout the Numan year.Table 11.1Roman feasts, life landmarks and the motion of heavenly bodiesDay, feast day and deity of the Numan yearLife landmarkMovement of celestial bodiesTopic covered in:1 October Tigillo sororioBeginning of female and male initiation28/29 September: Anniversary of the 16, 35 and 37th lunar eclipsesChap. 15 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html].

The resultingcalculation is: 19 days in June + 235 in July, August, September, October,November, December, January and February + 10.25 intercalary days + 9 inMarch = 273.25. 3The nundinae are an Etruscan institution that was carried over into the Romancalendar: an eight-day cycle, it consists of seven days tilling the fields andone day in the town market. These eight days are marked by the nundinal lettersA to H. Counting inclusively, from one day A to the next makes a nine-day cycle,hence the name nundinae. New Year’s day was always considered an “A” day.In the singular, Nundina means “market day”. Nundina is also the name of thedies lustricus deity (see Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.16.36): “For the Romans,among other things Nundina stood for the name of a goddess so called for the 9thday of life in newborns, known as the lustral day. The lustral day […] is the9th day for males., Est etiam Nundina Romanorum dea a nono die nascentiumnuncupata, qui lustricus dicitur. Est autem dies lustricus […] maribus nonus.”Perhaps instituted by Servius Tullius (Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.16.33), theconcept of the nundina has survived to the present day in the religious rite of‘novena’. 49 × 29.5306 = 265.7754; 19 days in June + 235 in July, August, September,October, November, December, January and February + 10,25 intercalarydays + 1 day in March = 265.25. 5Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 18.6.8: […] matronam dictam esse proprie, quae inmatrimonium cum viro convenisset, quoad in eo matrimonio maneret, etiamsi liberinondum nati forent, dictamque ita esse a matri nomine, non adepto iam, sed cumspe et omine mox adipiscendi. 6Ovid, Fasti, 3.243–58; quoted here are lines 244 and 255–258: […] quarummilitiam votaque partus habet; […] ’Tu nobis lucem, Lucina, dedisti. / […] tuvoto parturientis ades!’ / Si qua tamen gravida est, resoluto crine precetur /ut solvat partus molliter illa suos.The terms “fight” and “pray” hark back to Mars, Rhea Silvia and the conceptionof Romulus, the ideal prototype for the conception of a Roman citizen.If we look at the calendar, we find that on the Calends of March the Moon shouldbe a crescent high in the sky at sunset, 1.5 days after new Moon; this wouldmake it impossible to refer to the goddess that the heavenly body represents asLucina, “she who brings the light, giver of light”. And yet on those very yearswhen the solar New Year and new Moon fall on 8 or 9 March (see Chap. 7[A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]), on the preceding Calends the Moon was in itsfinal quarter, high in the sky at sunrise and heralding the Sun’s arrival. TheLatin name Lucina may be translated into Greek as Phosphoros (as it wastranslated by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his book Roman Antiquities 4.15.5),i.e. “bringer of light” – and, once again, akin to Venus/Lucifer. 7This reconstruction of ancient Rome bears a striking correspondence to thetraditions handed down to us in the Christian calendar: 1) Annunciation of theVirgin, preceding conception (Luke 1.31 and 2.21), which is celebrated on 25March; 2) A child is born nine months later (now equivalent to 275 days) on thenight of 24/25 December; 3) According to Jewish tradition, eight days afterbirth, the child is taken to the temple to be given its name and forcircumcision, which brings us to 1 January, our modern day New Year’s Day. It isworth noting that, until recent times, in Florence 25 March was considered thefirst day of the year: it was celebrated along with the conception of Christ,the Spring equinox and New Year’s Day. 8On initiation rites and Tigillum sororium, see Torelli 1984, p. 106; withreferences to A. von Domaszewski, Abhandlungen zur roemischen Religion,Leipzig-Berlin 1909, p. 222 and K. Latte, Roemische Religiongeschichte, Muenchen1960, p. 97 and 133. 9The ninth lunation—or synodical month—runs from the 266th to the 295th day afterconception: birth occurs on the 273rd day, in the tenth lunation (once again,counting inclusively).See Ovid, Fasti, 3.124: “a woman brings forth in twice 5 months, bis quintofemina mense parit.”, and Fasti, 2.175: “ten times the horned moon had filledher orb afresh, luna novum decies implerat cornibus orbem.”See also Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 3.10.8, quoted in note 11.1 above, whoestablishes birth “two hundred and seventy three days after conception, that isto say, after the fortieth week has commenced”."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1212. THE SOLSTICE FEASTS: FORS FORTUNA AND SATURNALIALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The Roman calendar had a very large number of festivities scattered throughoutthe year. Two of these festivities may, for simplicity’s sake, be characterizedas Rome’s solstice celebrations: * the first festival, which by tradition was established by King Servius Tullius (578–533 BCE), was dedicated to Fors Fortuna, between 24 and 26 June; * the second festival, which, always according to tradition, was even older and predated the foundation of the city itself, was the Saturnalia, which ran between 17 and 23 December.1 The first of these festivities fell on the summer solstice; the second on the winter solstice .2To recap: the festival of Fors Fortuna occurs around the summer solstice, duringthe longest days of the year, when the sun is in the sign of Cancer; thefestival of Saturnalia straddles the period around the winter solstice , duringthe shortest days of the year, when the sun enters or is about to enter the signof Capricorn.3To the Ancients, Cancer and Capricorn were the signs that linked the microcosmto the macrocosm. In the microcosm, every man lives out his own mortal life; inthe macrocosm, the souls of human beings enjoy their immortal existence. Theformer is on this lowly Earth; the latter is on high in the heavens—or even onthe Moon. The two signs of Cancer and Capricorn facilitate the perpetual cycleof the souls, allowing them to come down from the afterlife to Earth, and torise up from Earth to the afterlife.To be more precise: souls descend to Earth from birth through the gates ofCancer (or Boreas); souls ascend to the heavens after death through the gates ofCapricorn (or Notus).4This conception was expressed in famous lines by Homer, on which Porphyrycommented in his On the Cave of the Nymphs:> Perpetual waters through the grotto glide, a lofty gate unfolds on either> side;> to the north, to Boreas, is the way down to mankind:> the other, to the sacred south, to Notus, is for the gods> and may not be passed by man, as it is the path of the immortals.5Interestingly, the conception described by Homer (ca. 8th century BCE) wouldappear to pre-date the true ‘invention’ of the Zodiac—or perhaps it would bemore accurate to say ‘codification’ in its final version of 12 signs, each ofwhich spans 30°—which scholars believe occurred in Mesopotamia sometime “aroundthe middle of the fifth century BCE”.6Two elements are worthy of note: one astronomic, the other more closelyassociated with Roman festivities. The astronomical element concerns the roleplayed by the Moon and Saturn. In reality, these two heavenly bodies are“errant” and opposite bodies, inasmuch as: the Moon is the body that liesclosest to the Earth and the farthest from the fixed stars; Saturn is thefarthest from the Earth and the closest to the fixed stars.Moreover, these two heavenly bodies share a series of correspondences that willnot have eluded the earliest sky watchers: * the Moon takes roughly 29½ days to complete its monthly cycle and return to its initial position with respect to the Sun; * Saturn takes roughly 29½ years to complete its orbit and return to its initial position with respect to the fixed stars; * over the 29½ or so years that it takes Saturn to complete its orbit and return to its initial position with respect to the fixed stars, the Moon completes around 365 29½-day cycles, at the end of which it returns to its initial position with respect to the Sun; * during these same 29½ years, the Sun self-evidently completes around 29½ of its annual 365-day cycles, and passes that same number of times through its initial position with respect to the fixed stars.What this means is that even the earliest sky watchers will have noticed thereal and gradually increasing distance of these three bodies from the Earth: theMoon, the Sun and Saturn. They will have also have begun to glimpse the idealand secret harmony of the celestial spheres that would find full expressionfirst with Pythagoras (ca. 570–495 BCE), then with Kepler (1571–1630 CE).The other bond that associates the Moon with the Tropic of Cancer and Saturnwith the Tropic of Capricorn is solely the product of the imagination of theAncients—an act of imagination that, in any event, starts off with a kernel ofreality. Once again, we hear from Porphyry:> There are two extremities in the heaven: the winter tropic, than which nothing> is more southern, and the summer tropic, than which nothing is more northern.> The summer tropic is in Cancer, and the winter tropic in Capricorn.> Since Cancer is nearest to us, it is very properly attributed to the Moon,> which is the nearest of all the heavenly bodies to the earth. As the southern> pole by its great distance is invisible to us, hence Capricorn is attributed> to [Saturn,] the highest and most remote of all the planets.7Though its origins may have been lost in the mists of time, astrologicaldoctrine has retained a similar conception of things ever since: the Moon hasits domicile in Cancer and its exile in Capricorn; Saturn has its domicile inCapricorn and its exile in Cancer.The result of all this is a long sequence of oppositions: * the first opposition is of the “nearby” Moon compared to the “distant” Saturn; * the second opposition has the Tropic of Cancer, which is also considered to be “near”, in opposition to the Tropic of Capricorn, which is felt to be “distant”. * The third opposition—which we have already touched upon—is between the solstices: * the summer solstice takes place during the longest days of the year; * the winter solstice occurs during the shortest days of the year.Most importantly, if the Sun is in the sign of Cancer, then the Moon—if it isnew8—will be in the same sign of Cancer, that is to say, at its closest point tothe Earth. This means that if the Moon is new during the summer solstice, itwill be the closest heavenly body to the Earth and, at the same time, be passingthrough the point that—ideally—is closest to the Earth. The new Moon happens tobe represented in the heavens by the goddess Fortuna (see Chap. 8[A324790_1_En_8_Chapter.html]), who on the days between 24 and 26 June iscelebrated in the most variable and unpredictable of events: Fors Fortunae, the‘Destiny of Fortune’.It is as if the opposition between the Moon—most particularly the new Moon—andSaturn exalts, and indeed acquires, its greatest value at the two solstices. TheAncients considered the two heavenly bodies to play opposite roles: * at the summer solstice, when the Sun is in Cancer—that is to say, in the domicile of the Moon—the new Moon (the planet closest to the Earth) is also in Cancer, and is therefore passing through the point closest to the Earth, which favours the descent of souls to the Earth; * at the winter solstice , when the Sun is in Capricorn—that is to say, in the domicile of Saturn—it is Saturn, the planet farthest from the Earth and closest to the fixed stars, that promotes the re-ascendance of those same souls from the Earth to the heavens.The second element of interest—one which is more properly associated with Romanfeasts—casts light on the meaning behind the rites observed: * on the feast of Fors Fortuna, during the night of the summer solstice, people used to float down Rome’s river in boats by night, as Ovid depicts:> Come, Quirites, celebrate with joy the goddess Fors!> On Tiber’s bank she has her royal foundations.> Speed some of you on feet, and some in the swift boat,> and think no shame to return tipsy home from your ramble.> Yeflower-crowned skiffs, bear bands of youthful revelers,9> and let them quaff deep draughts of wine on the bosom of the stream; * this Tiberina descensio signified a journey towards the afterlife—in Porphyry’s words, a moving “[…] on the waters […] for souls descending into generation fly to moisture”10; * for the feast of the Saturnalia, at the winter solstice, slaves donned the clothing of free men and everybody gave one another a gift; this behaviour meant that> those who are now born slaves will be liberated through the Saturnalia> festival, and the house attributed to Saturn [i.e. Capricorn], when they live> again and return to the fountain of life.11So, to recap anew: * on 24–26 June, for the festival of Fors Fortuna, the sun is in Cancer, the domicile of the Moon. If the Moon is new, it too will be in Cancer, and souls will find their descent to Earth facilitated; * on 17–23 December, for the festival of the Saturnalia, the Sun is in Capricorn, the domicile of Saturn, and souls will find their re-ascent to the heavens facilitated.The first thing to note is that these theoretical conceptions may hail fromGreece, but their practical application takes place in Rome. However, thedivinities involved—Fors Fortuna and Saturnus—are not Roman: the focal point ofthe cult of Fortuna was in the Etruscan city of Praeneste (modern dayPalestrina), and was brought to Rome by Etruscan king Servius Tullius; the nameSaturnus “may be of Etruscan origin”.12 This case repeats what we will see onother occasions13: though the documentation available to us is Roman, in alllikelihood its origins lie in the East, and arrived in Rome through Etruscanintercession.A second observation. Since time immemorial, man has considered the summersolstice to be one of two times during the year in which it is easiest to findconfirmation of the absolute, predictable and given reliability of the Sun’smotion. Year after year, the brightest body in the sky always rises and sets atthe same time, and at the same azimuth. The reason for establishing the feast ofa lunar divinity such as Fortuna—specifically, the festivity of Fors Fortunae,‘the Destiny of Fortune’—on this day probably signifies an attempt to find a wayto answer the ancient question: how, when and where will the Moon rise and seton the summer solstice? In other words, compared to the self-evident andimmutable behaviour of the “male” Sun, how will the most unpredictable and“feminine” of heavenly bodies behave? What face will the celestial body definedas a kind of “fortune squared” show? What is the “destiny”, the “fate”, the“fortune” of the Fortuna/Moon on the solstice? Clearly, it took thecontemporaneous observation of the Sun and Moon over a very long period indeedto identify the cycle that we know today as the Metonic cycle, in which, every19 solar years, the Sun and the Moon return almost exactly to the same point inthe Zodiac on the same day of the year.14 This cycle was utilized in Babylon forcalendars no earlier than the beginning of the fifth century BCE,15 beforearriving in Athens and receiving the name of the Greek astronomer in 432.However, according to Diodorus Siculus,16 it was already well known by the“hyperborean” men of Stonehenge…A third and final observation. The idea of that other Fortunae sors, literallythe “Lot of Fortune”, which truly has had good fortune in later astrologicalconceptions, must have arisen from the contemporaneous observation of the Sunand the Moon, and from the incessant and unpredictable modification of theirangular distance. This procedure consists of measuring the angular distancebetween the Sun and the Moon at the moment when a given individual is born, andthen travelling the same distance from the ascendant in an anticlockwisedirection. Such a calculation identifies the “Lot of Fortune”, which can then beused to draw up a veritable “lunar horoscope”, with a position with respect tothe Moon identical to the position of the ascendant with respect to the Sun.17Footnotes1On the goddess Fortuna as represented in the sky by the new Moon, see Chap. 8[A324790_1_En_8_Chapter.html]; see also Magini 1996, pp. 32–34; Magini 2006, pp.123–134; Magini 2008, pp. 184–188.For a more detailed examination of the feasts of Fors Fortuna and theSaturnalia, see Magini 2008, pp. 207–214. 2Different authors place the summer solstice at different times: for Ovid, Fasti,6.790, it falls on 26 June; for Columella, de re rustica, 11.2.48, between 24and 26 June; for Pliny, Naturalis Historia, 18.256, 264 and 288, on 24 June.As for the winter solstice, according to tradition (see Chap. 26[A324790_1_En_26_Chapter.html])—notably, Varro, de lingua latina, 6.8, Ovid,Fasti, 1.163–4, and the Praenestine Calendar—it falls on 21 December; for Pliny,Naturalis Historia, 18.221, it is fere, “around”, the 25. 3As for the Sun’s entry into Cancer, as far as Ovid, Fasti, 6.727, and Columella,de re rustica, 11.2.48, are concerned, it takes place on 19 June. Pliny,Naturalis Historia 18.221, limits himself to writing “bruma capricorni […]solstitium cancri, the winter solstice (occurs) in Capricorn […] the summersolstice in Cancer”.For Columella, de re rustica, 11.2.94, the Sun enters the sign of Capricorn on17 December, the first day of the Saturnalia. 4As with the tropics, the entrance to Cancer—or Boreas—faces north, and theentrance to Capricorn—or Notus—faces south. 5Homer, Odyssey, 13.109–12: εν δ υδατο αεναοντα. δυω δε τε οι θυραι εισιν, / αιμεν προς βορεαο καταιβαται ανθρωποισιν, / αι δ αυ προς νοτου εισι θεωτεραι :ουδε τι κεινη / ανδρες εσερχονται, αλλ αθανατων οδος εστιν. 6Britton-Walker 1996, p. 49. 7Porphyry, The Cave of the Nymphs, 21: […] δυο ειναι εν ουρανω ακρα, ων ουτενοτιωτερον εστι του χειμερινου τροπικου ουτε βορειοτερον του θερινου. εστι δ ομεν θερινος κατα καρκινον, ο δε χειμερινος κατ αιγοκερων. και προσγειοτατοςΣεληνη απεδοθη, αϕανους δ ετι οντος του νοτιου πολου τω μακραν ετι αϕεστηκοτικαι ανωτατω των πλανωμενων παντων ο αιγοκερως απεδοθη. 8The lunar cycle and the solar cycle are not in synch. The moon is new on 24 Juneonce every 19 years; before and after this, it is in a different phase. Themechanism is the same one that regulates the cadence of Easter for Christianity,which falls on the first Sunday following the full moon after the springequinox. 9Ovid, Fasti, 6.775–80: Ite, deam laeti Fortem celebrate, Quirites: / in Tiberisripa munera regis habet. / Pars pede, pars etiam celeri decurrite cumba, / necpudeat potos inde redire domum. / Ferte coronatae iuvenum convivia lintres, /multaque per medias vina bibantur aquas. 10Porphyry, The Cave of the Nymphs, 10: […] τας των υδατων προεστωσας δυναμειςιδιως […] τας εις γενεσιν κατιουσας ψυχας κοινως απασας. 11Porphyry, The Cave of the Nymphs, 23: […] οι νυν οντες δια την γενεσιν δουλοιδια της Κρονικης εορτης και του ανακειμενου Κρονω οικου ελευθερουνται,αναβιωσκομενοι και εις απογενεσιν απερχομενοι. 12Ernout-Meillet 1979, s.v. 13For example, as regards the feasts of Regifugium (24 February) and of theVestalia (9 June), see Chap. 16 [A324790_1_En_16_Chapter.html].

SOLAR ECLIPSES, LUNAR ECLIPSES AND THE CYCLE OF SAROSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Eclipses occur when the Sun, Moon and Earth all come into alignment (Fig. 13.1).A solar eclipse occurs when the new Moon interposes itself between the Sun andthe Earth (Figs. 13.2 and 13.3); a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comesbetween the Sun and the full Moon (Figs. 13.4 and 13.5).A324790_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.1Solar and Lunar eclipses—from Johannes de Sacrobosco (John of Holywood), SphaeraMundi, Venice 1490.

ZanandreaIf the Moon’s orbit around the Earth was on the same plane as the Earth’s orbitaround the Sun, every new Moon would lie between the Sun and the Earth and wewould have a solar eclipse, while at every full Moon the Earth would comebetween the Sun and the Moon, resulting in a lunar eclipse.In actual fact, the Moon’s orbit around the Earth is inclined with respect tothe Earth’s orbit around the Sun. It follows that in order for an alignment totrigger an eclipse, the full or new Moon must be near one of the lunar nodes,either ascendant or descendant, where the Moon’s orbit intersects the Sun’sorbit (Fig. 13.6). In such cases the Sun, viewed from the Earth, is either closeto the same node where the new Moon is in transit, or is close to the oppositenode where the full Moon is in transit. If this is not the case, no eclipse willtake place (Fig. 13.7).A324790_1_En_13_Fig6_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig6_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.6The lunar nodes.

The apparent orbits of the Sun and Moon and the twolunar nodes. On the left, the Moon is new; on the right, it is full; in bothcases, there is no eclipse because the Sun and Moon are distant from the nodesA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is new less than 11 days before orafter the Sun passes through the given node; a partial eclipse occurs if theMoon is new less than 19 days before or after this transit. Lunar eclipses aretotal if the Moon becomes full less than 5 days before or after the Sun movesthrough the node; they are partial if the Moon becomes full less than 13 daysbefore or after this passage.The Sun takes 346.62 days—known as a draconitic or eclipse year—to return to thesame lunar node. It takes half that time—173.31 days—to travel from one node tothe next. Every year, eclipses are grouped into two eclipse seasons roughly sixlunations apart. The Moon takes a synodic month of 29.5306 days to return to thesame position with respect to the Sun—from new Moon to new Moon, or from fullMoon to full Moon; it takes a draconitic month of 27.2122 days to return to thesame node.Eclipse years and draconitic months are shorter, respectively, than solar yearsand synodic months, because the lunar nodes, which spin in a retrograde—i.e.clockwise—direction along the ecliptic (Fig. 13.8), are, figuratively speaking,moving towards the Sun and the Moon, which, on the contrary, spin in adirect—i.e. anticlockwise—direction1 (see Chap. 17[A324790_1_En_17_Chapter.html]).A324790_1_En_13_Fig8_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig8_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.8The retrograde revolution of the lunar nodes along the ecliptic. The moonrevolves around the Earth in an anticlockwise direction; the lunar nodes move ina clockwise direction. At each revolution the Moon passes the same node againbefore passing the same point in its own orbitThe 6,585-day Saros cycle is the least common multiple of the synodic anddraconitic months (see Table 13.1), that is to say, it is the shortest period oftime between two moments when lunar and solar eclipses occur at practically thesame frequency. By complete chance, it is also a multiple of the sidereal month,the anomalistic month—i.e. the interval between two successive passages of theMoon through perigee (see Chap. 19 [A324790_1_En_19_Chapter.html])—and theeclipse year (see again Table 13.1).Table 13.1The Saros cycle6,585.3238 days = 223 synodic months × 29.5306 days6,585.3524 days = 242 draconitic months × 27.2122 days6,584.5056 days = 241 sidereal months × 27.32166,585.5494 days = 239 anomalistic months × 27.5546 days6,585.78 days = 19 eclipse years × 346.62 daysThe Saros cycle—a phenomenon that was known in Mesopotamia, centuries before thestart of the common era2 (Fig. 13.9)—encompasses, on average, a total of 85(total and partial) eclipses: 48 solar eclipses and 37 lunar eclipses.A324790_1_En_13_Fig9_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig9_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.9The so-called “Saros-Canon”, a Babylonian tablet dating from the third centuryBCE, is a list of years and months listing eclipses of the Moon. The years arethose of the successive reigns of Artaxerxes II (starting from the 32nd year),Umasu (U), Arses (Ar), Darius (Da), Alexander (A), Philip (Phi), Antigonus (An),and Seleucus (Si), from 373 to 277 BCE. The months are indicated as Romannumerals from I to XII; dir indicates the insertion of an intercalary month; 5 mthe five-month interval between one series of eclipses and the next. Each columnrecords 38 eclipses, corresponding to one cycle of Saros, composed of fiveseries of 7, 8, 7, 8 and 8 eclipses (with the first series of eclipsessubdivided into two portions of 3 and of 4 eclipses, respectively in the firstand last row of boxes from the top). Within each series the interval between oneeclipse and the next is 6 months (e.g. in the second square from the top of thefirst column: 33rd year of Artaxerxes, second and 8 month, and then in the34th year, 2nd month, and so on)Solar eclipses are more numerous than lunar eclipses because two solar eclipsesmay potentially occur in a single eclipse season. Lunar eclipses, which may onlyoccur once each time that the Sun passes through a node, are grouped into fiveseries: three series lasting eight eclipses, and two lasting seven eclipses, ina pattern of 8, 7, 8, 8, 7. The last of these 38 eclipses is a repetition of thefirst: it marks the end of one Saros cycle and the beginning of the next.Within an individual series, each eclipse occurs six lunations after thepreceding eclipse; each series is separated by five lunations. Only the centraleclipses in each series are total eclipses. The sequence of solar and lunareclipses moves forward like toothed sprockets: one type of eclipse is totalduring the intervals between the other type of eclipse’s series, which, viceversa, are either partial or fail to occur at all.3At the end of each Saros cycle, the first eclipse is almost an exact repetitionof the eclipse that occurred 223 synodic months and 242 draconitic monthsearlier (see Fig. 13.10). I say “almost exact” because the Saros cycle lasts anon-whole number of days—6,585 and a third days, to be precise. In practice,this leads to a change in the area on Earth from which eclipses are visiblebetween one Saros cycle and the next (see Fig. 13.11).A324790_1_En_13_Fig10_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig10_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.10Subsequent lunar eclipses visible from North Europe, predicted between the years1538 and 1570—from Petrus Apianus (Peter Bienewitz), Cosmographia, Paris 1551.In the second row, from left, the eclipse on 1 March 1542 corresponds to the 12March 1560 eclipse in the next Cycle of SarosA324790_1_En_13_Fig11_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_13_Fig11_HTML.gif]Fig. 13.11Four lunar eclipses one cycle of Saros apart from one another—8 February 1506,19 February 1524, 1 March 1542 and 12 March 1560—as shown today on the NASA website. Each eclipse has its centre (the black dot along the black vertical line)around 120° further West than with preceding eclipse. The fourth eclipse is oncemore centred where the first was centred, completing the exeligmos. The twoeclipses of 1542 and 1560 are among those predicted by Apianus; see Fig. 13.10(from http:// eclipse. gsfc. nasa. gov/ eclipse. html[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html], revised by the author)However, as Ptolemy, Geminus, Hipparchus, Aristarchus and, before them,astronomers in Babylon were well aware, adding three Saros cycles together formsa new 19,756 day-long cycle (close to a whole day),4 known as an Exeligmos, or“that which has completely gone round” (see again Fig. 13.11).Footnotes1The expressions “retrograde—i.e. clockwise—direction” and “direct—i.e.anticlockwise—direction” refer to an observer in the Earth’s northern hemispherelooking towards the south. 2Schiaparelli (1997–1998, Vol. I, pp. 41–89) explains that the use of a lunarcalendar—such as the Babylonian calendar—in which lunar eclipses can only occurmid-month makes it far easier to understand the Saros cycle.Clearly enough, this explanation also applies to the Numan calendar, in whichthe underlying lunar foundation is disturbed only by intercalations. (see Chap.15 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]). 3We shall see later on (Chap. 15 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]) how to calculatethe occurrence of eclipses within a Saros cycle. 4An Exeligmos lasts 669 synodic months, or 19,755.971 days; it also lasts 726draconitic months, or 19,756.057 days."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1414.

The latter conjunction resulted in the totaleclipse of the Sun that marked the start of astronomical time and the Numancycle (see Chap. 1 [A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]).The anniversary of another divine conception occurs one Saros cycle later, on 15March in year nineteen:> On the Ides is held the conception feast of Anna Perenna,1writes Ovid, who knows a thing or two about the goddess:> […] but since erroneous rumours are rife as to who this goddess is,> I am resolved to throw no cloak about her tale.This is the poet’s incipit for a sequence of stories that, as a whole, serveonly as a framework, before going on to explain the reason for the vulgar songssung by young women during the feast, when he comes to the crunch:> Now it remains for me to explain why girls chant ribald songs;> for they assemble and sing certain scurrilous verses.> When Anna had been but lately made a goddess, the Marching God [i.e. Mars]> came to her, and taking her aside spoke as follows:> ‘Thou art worshipped in my month, I have joined my season to thine:> I have great hope in the service that thou canst render me.> An armed god myself, I have fallen in love with the armed goddess Minerva;> I burn and for a long time have nursed this wound.> She and I are deities alike in our pursuits; contrive to unite us.> That office well befits thee, kind old dame.’> So he spoke. She duped the god by a false promise,> and kept him dangling on in foolish hope by dubious delays.> When he often pressed her, ‘I have done thy bidding,’ said she,> ‘she is conquered and has yielded at last to thine entreaties.’> The lover believed her and made ready the bridal chamber. Thither> they escorted Anna, like a bride, with a veil upon her face.> When he would have kissed her, Mars suddenly perceived Anna;> now shame, now anger moved the god befooled.> The new goddess laughed at dear Minerva’s lover.> Never did anything please Venus more than that.> So old jokes are cracked and ribald songs are sung,> and people love to remember how Anna choused the great god.2As in one of the paintings that brought such renown to the Italian Renaissance,poet Ovid offers an allegorical description of a heavenly body coming betweentwo others. In this particular case, the story illustrates how Anna Perenna,interposing herself between the ardent god Mars and the coveted Minerva, repeatson Earth the acts of the celestial bodies on high: Mars embodies the maleelement and represents the Sun, the infinite and everlasting fiery source ofseed, while Minerva embodies the female element, in representation of the Moon,the no less infinite and everlasting aqueous reservoir of the ovum.3Countless attempts by the female element (Anna or Minerva) to escape a trystwith a male element (represented by Mars) are correlated by countlessconjunctions or oppositions (new Moons or full Moons) in which the two brightestbodies in the sky come into close proximity without actually generating aneclipse. When, at last, as they travel along their respective orbits, the Sunand Moon both approach the lunar nodes and an eclipse becomes possible (seeChaps. 13 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html] and 15 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]),this is the moment when (in mythical terms) Anna Perenna comes between Mars andMinerva, corresponding (in astronomical terms) to the “full Earth” interposingitself between the Sun and the Moon, and blotting out the full Moon during lunareclipse.This explains why, when Ovid writes of the newly-elevated goddess,> Some think that this goddess is the Moon, because the Moon> [fills up the measure of the year by her months,4he uses the term annus in its acceptation of “temporal circuit”, its oldestmeaning. Macrobius bears this out:> In reality, as the lunar year is in fact the month, for in a little less than> a month the Moon travels around the entire Zodiac, so the solar year should be> calculated as the number of days that it takes to return to the same sign from> which the Sun departed. This is known as the course of the year—the grand> year; the Moon’s year, on the contrary, is the abbreviated year. Ateius Capito> is another who believes that the noun annus derives from ‘temporal circuit’.5In actual fact, on 15 March in year nineteen of the Numan cycle, 6,585 dayslater, the Moon concludes the temporal circuit defined by the Saros cycle. Onthat day, however, the Moon is new—and not full, as the Ides on the calendarwould seem to indicate—so the eclipse is once more a solar eclipse that falls onthe day of the conception of Anna Perenna, repeating the 1 March solar eclipsein year one, and marking the start of the next Saros cycle.The countless jugs of wine downed and the (same) number of years thatparticipants at the feast wish one another to live mark a rare, exceptional andextraordinary event that takes place once in a very great number of years (andglasses of wine)….At the precise moment when, in the heavens, one astral cycle comes to an end andthe next is about to begin, down on Earth another cycle of life comes to an end:the cycle of adolescence, which is replaced by the cycle of youth.This is the moment when young women go through their initiation rites (see Chap.11 [A324790_1_En_11_Chapter.html]) and prepare for marriage in the near future,on Veneralia, 1 April (see Chap. 10 [A324790_1_En_10_Chapter.html]). Malescomplete their cycle of adolescence and enter youth at the end of tirocinium,which is followed by enrollment in the Army (for those who are eligible), thedonning of the virile toga, and presentation to the people on 17 March, on thefeasts of Liberalia (see Chaps. 7 [A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html] and 11[A324790_1_En_11_Chapter.html]), while their ever more precocious femalecontemporaries do so 2 days earlier, on 15 March, the feast of Anna Perenna.This is the moment when virgins are inspected to ensure that they areviripotens, “of marriageable age” and integra, “intact, inviolate”; preciselybecause these inspections are yet to be completed and impending marriages areyet to be celebrated, the virgins in question are not allowed to copulate.6This is when virgins visit the Lavinium temple, bringing goblets dedicated toAna and other objects such as statues and votive objects to propitiate theirfertility as newlyweds. This is when virgins “meet to sing vulgar songs”—atypical pre-wedding event, a kind of hen-party—and the blood of their finalmenstruation before consummation of matrimony is poured on the sacred orchard ofthe goddess, along the Via Flaminia, just outside the modern day Porta delPopolo in Rome.According to Martial,> […] where virginal blood assists> Anna Perenna’s woods, so heavy with fruit,7in which—if we so desire—we may perceive an arch reference to the female bodyand the “fruits” enjoyed by the man who penetrates her “thicket”.The feast of Anna Perenna is the moment when the cycle of life that runs frombirth to the age of fertility cedes to a no less life-filled cycle, movingforwards from the start of fertility to the birth of the next generation ofhumankind.Footnotes1Ovid, Fasti, 3.523: Idibus est Annae festum geniale Perennae. The standardtranslation is by J.G. Frazer, who interprets the Latin term geniale as“jovial”—he is mistaken: the adjective geniale comes from the same root as theverb gignere, “to generate”, and means “of generation, of conception”. In ArsAmatoria, 1.125, Ovid writes genialis praeda in reference to the Sabine virginswho have been chosen to conceive children for the Romans. 2Ovid, Fasti, 3.543-4 and 675-96: Quae tamen haec dea sit, quoniam rumoribuserrat, / fabula proposito nulla tegenda meo […] / Nunc mihi cur cantent superestoscena puellae / dicere; nam coeunt certaque probra canunt. / Nuper erat deafacta; venit Gradivus ad Annam / et cum seducta talia verba facit: / ‘Mense meocoleris, iunxi mea tempora tecum; / pendet ab officio spes mihi magna tuo. /Armifer armiferae correptus amore Minervae / uror et hoc longo tempore volnusalo. / Effice, di studio similes coeamus in unum. / Conveniunt partes haec tibi,comis anus.’ / Dixerat; illa deum promisso ludit inani / et stultam dubia spemtrahit usque mora. / Saepius instanti: ‘Mandata peregimus’, inquit, / ‘evictaest; precibus vix dedit illa manus.’ / Credit amans thalamosque parat.

[…] for it must be out of love for the Sun that the Moon herselfgoes her rounds and gets into conjunction with him in her yearning [to receive]from him what is most fructifying”. “Bright-eyed” or “blue-eyed”—better,“Owl-eyed” (Glaukopis)—is an attribute of Athena, the Greek corollary to theEtruscan/Roman goddess Minerva. 4Fasti, 3.523-696. Quoted here is line 657: Sunt quibus haec Luna est, quiamensibus impleat annum. 5Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.14.4-5: Nam, sicut lunaris annus mensis est, quia lunapaulo minus quam mensem in zodiaci circumitione consumit, ita solis annus hocdierum numero colligendus est quem peragit dum ad signum se denuo vertit ex quodigressus est; unde annus vertens vocatur, et habetur magnus, cum lunae annusbrevis putetur […] Hinc et Ateius Capito annum a circuitu temporis putat dictum. 6See Torelli 1984, pp. 57–71 and 105–15; a different view. 7Martial, Epigrams, 4.64.16-7: et quod virgineo cruore gaudet / Annae pomiferumnemus Perennae."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1515. THE FREQUENCY OF SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES AND THE FESTIVITIES OF THE NUMANYEARLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]If we set the Saros and Numan cycles in motion concurrently, we find that: * the total eclipse of the Sun that took place on Romulus’s conception (1 March in year one of the Numan cycle) kicks off astronomical and calendar time in both cycles; * the total eclipse of the Sun 6,585 days later that took place on Anna Perenna’s conception (15 March in year nineteen of the same Numan cycle) marks the end of a first Saros cycle and the start of the next.1It is an interesting exercise to calculate the solar and lunar eclipses withinthe Saros cycle, match them to the Numan cycle, and compare these dates withfeast days in the Numan calendar. As we have seen, it is straightforward enoughto make such calculations approximately by positing that the Earth’s revolutionaround the Sun and the Moon’s revolution around the Earth are uniform in motionand follow circular orbits, and considering the apparent dimension of the Sunand Moon to be their average size. Though things in the natural world aredifferent—as ancient sky gazers became only too aware at a very early stage—themargin of error generated by this kind of simplification is not nearlysignificant enough to prevent construction of a theoretical calendar that couldbe used to predict eclipses.The key calculation for solar eclipses is the moment that the Sun passes throughone of the lunar nodes, and the number of days between this moment and the nextnew Moon. This calculation is most straightforward if we follow the simplesthypothesis: on the first day of the cycle the Sun passes through a node, and theMoon is in the new Moon phase.We therefore start with a total solar eclipse on the first day of the cycle.Having passed through a node on the first day of the cycle, the Sun movesthrough the next node 173.31 days later; the Moon—which is new on the first dayof the cycle—completes six lunations 177.18 (= 6 × 29.53) days later. The Moonis new 3.87 (= 177.18 − 173.31) days after the Sun passed through the node. Inconsequence, a second solar eclipse occurs during the sixth new Moon after thefirst solar eclipse, 177 days later, on 26 August in year one. This too is atotal eclipse, because it occurs within the 11 day interval of the Sun’s passagethrough the node.The Sun next passes through a node 173.31 days later, 346.62 days after thestart of the cycle. The Moon takes 354.36 days to complete 12 lunations. TheMoon is new 7.74 (= 354.36 − 346.62) days after the Sun passes through the node,which means that the twelfth new Moon coincides with a third solar eclipse onthe 354th day, 27 February (the last but 1 day of the year one). Once again,this is a total eclipse, because the Sun passed through the node fewer than11 days earlier.Another 173.31 days later (519.93 days after the start of the cycle), the Sunpasses through a node once more. The Moon completes 18 lunations after531.55 days, and is new 11.62 days after the Sun’s passage through the node. Theeighteenth new Moon heralds a fourth solar eclipse, this time not total, becauseit is more than 11 days after the Sun’s passage through the node.From now on, the Sun is too far from the node for the alignment between the Sun,Moon and Earth to occur: the shadow of the new Moon no longer strikes thesurface of the Earth, and the sequence of eclipses is temporarily suspended.However, five lunations later—on the occasion of the twenty-third new Moon,679.19 days after the beginning of the cycle—the Sun approaches a node for thefourth time (693.24 days from the start). The Moon is new 14.05 days before theSun moves through the node. As this is within the threshold of 19 days, we havea partial solar eclipse that starts off a new series of eclipses. And so thesequence continues.There are, of course, occasions when it is necessary to calculate the number ofdays between the Sun’s passage through a node and the two nearest new Moons: oneprior to and one subsequent to the Sun’s passage. This allows us to ascertainwhether or not two consecutive new Moons fall within a single eclipse season. Ifwe take the previous example, the Sun passes through a node for the third timeafter 519.93 days; the seventeenth lunation is complete after 502.02 days, andthe eighteenth lunation after 531.54 days. Consequently, the seventeenth newMoon occurs 17.91 (= 519.93 − 502.02) days earlier, and the eighteenth new Moontakes place 11.62 (= 531.55 − 519.93) days after the Sun passes through a node,giving us two (extremely) partial solar eclipses, one on the seventeenth and theother on the eighteenth new Moon. And so the sequence continues.The same process applies to lunar eclipses, with the sole difference that thecalculation concerns the number of days between the Sun’s passage through one ofthe nodes and the full Moon, i.e. the half-point in a lunation.After calculating eclipse dates and the Saros cycle day number when theseeclipses occur, we must check the day, month and year in the Numan cycle towhich they correspond. This may be achieved from the years of the Numan cycle(see Table 4. 1 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]) and months of the Numan year (seeS. C.).Tables 15.1 and 15.2 compare the characteristics of the Saros cycle with theNuman cycle. As we saw in Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html], the Numan cycleconsists of 12-lunation-long years in odd years of the cycle, alternating withlonger, intercalated even years. From one year to the next, withoutintercalation eclipses would occur on the same day (or at most a day earlier);with intercalation eclipses slip backwards by the number of intercalated days(22 or 23 days, or at most a day earlier).Table 15.1Solar eclipses in the Saros cycle and the initial 19 years of the Numan cycleABCDENo. of the Sun’s passages through a node/No. of lunationsDay of the Sun’s passage through a node—Day of lunation = Number of days betweenthe Sun’s passage through a node and the lunationEclipse day (rounded up or down to the nearest day)Numan cycle day, month and yearNuman calendar feast day0/01 − 1 = 011 Mar. 01FERIAE MARTIS1/6173.31 − 177.18 = −3.8717726 Aug. 0125.8.

Tigillo sororioOn occasion, an eclipse may reoccur on the same day 10 years later. For example,the 22nd lunar eclipse on 11 August in year eleven reflects the first lunareclipse on 11 August in year one. It is self-evident why this occurs: the firsteclipse coincides with the 129th full Moon, and the second eclipse coincideswith the 5th full Moon of the cycle. Through intercalation, 124 (= 129 − 5)lunations or 3,662 days elapse over the 10 years separating the two eclipses(see Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]). I say “on occasion” because thefive-lunation interval between one series of eclipses and the next (see Chap. 13[A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]) breaks up the regularity of eclipses falling onthe same day in later years. For instance, though the lunar eclipse on 11 Augustin year one is followed by a lunar eclipse on 11 August in year eleven, the 13February eclipse in year one is not mirrored by a 13 February eclipse in yeareleven because a new series commenced one lunation earlier, on 12 January.Note> The following two Tables list solar and lunar eclipses in the Saros cycle for> the first 19 years of a Numan cycle: Table 15.1 is a list of solar eclipses> (standard typeface); Table 15.2 is a list of lunar eclipses (italics).> Total eclipses are in bold; partial eclipses are in standard typeface:> Column A measures the Sun’s passages through one of the lunar nodes and the> lunations for a solar eclipse (lunation midpoints for lunar eclipses);> Column B shows the day that the Sun passes through one of the nodes, the day> of lunation (or lunation midpoint), and the number of days between the two;> Column C presents the eclipse day (the lunation day, rounded up or down);> Column D lists the day, month and year of the Numan cycle in which the eclipse> occurs;> Column E shows Numan calendar feasts (Feriale antiquissimum 2 feasts are in> bold) that fall exactly on the same day as an eclipse (in which case the day> is not indicated) or close to that day. For simplicity’s sake, months are> abbreviated in accordance with our modern-day calendar (e.g. March = 3).> A thicker horizontal line separates the series of solar eclipses; a double> line is used to separate the lunar eclipse series.3Another thing that Table 15.1 reveals is the correspondence between eclipse daysand Feriale antiquissimum feast days in the Numan calendar: * 10 solar eclipses fall exactly on a feast day: on 27 February 01, 9 June 05, 15 October 07, 15 October 08, 23 March 09, 21 February 09, 19 August 10, 15 April 17, 13 September 18, and 15 March 19 (the last eclipse in the first Saros cycle, and the first in the second); * 17 solar eclipses fall at a one-day interval—either before or after—a feast day: on 26 August 01, 26 August 02, 4 July 03, 4 July 04, 10 May 06, 8 June 06, 16 April 07, 16 April 08, 20 August 09, 22 March 10, 20 February 10, 10 May 15, 10 May 16, 16 March 17, 14 September 17, 14 October 17, and 16 March 18; * 4 solar eclipses fall at a 2 day interval from a feast day: on 27 July 02, 27 July 11, 27 July 12, and 3 July 13.In total, 31 (= 10 + 17 + 4) eclipses out of 49 fall on or around Ferialeantiquissimum feast days.Incidentally, two issues should be borne in mind if we are to correctlyinterpret what these results mean; unfortunately, there is a great deal more tobe learned about these two issues, not least the way the transition was made inancient times from theory to practical application.The first issue is Etrusco-Roman civilization’s predilection for odd numbers,and its corresponding dislike of even numbers (see Chap. 2[A324790_1_En_2_Chapter.html]). Given this knowledge, we may surmise that evenif the calculations reveal that an eclipse fell on an even-numbered day, thecorresponding festivity would be inserted into the calendar on the previous orsubsequent odd-numbered day.The second issue regards Etruscan and Roman differences in what is deemed to bethe start of the day. Virgil’s commentator informs us: “The day begins at middayfor the Etruscans, and at midnight for the Romans.”4 From this, it is clear thatwhat in the modern age is the morning was, for the Etruscans, the last half ofthe day (and for the Romans the first half of the day); and what in the modernage is the afternoon was, for the Etruscans, the first half of the day (and forthe Romans the last half of the day). In other words, for example, our morningof day 7 was already the first half of day 7 for the Romans, whereas for theEtruscans it was still the second half of day 6.The first of these issues potentially leads to confusion over the roles ofeven-numbered and odd-numbered days; the second issue may lead to confusion overthe role of the first and second half of the day.If we return to the calculations in Table 15.1, the first 10 eclipses “takeup”—if such a term may be permitted −10 days in the calendar; the second 17eclipses, which fall either one day before or one day after a feast day, take up51 (= 17 eclipses × 3 days) days; the final 4 eclipses, which falls either2 days before or 2 days after the feast day, take up 20 (= 4 × 5) days. All inall, the 31 (= 10 + 17 + 4) eclipses take up 81 (= 10 + 51 + 20) days out of the355 days in the year.If we compare the 81 days taken up by eclipses during a 355 day year with the6,585 days in the Saros cycle, we obtain the following ratio:81 ÷ 355 = 1,502 ÷ 6,585 = 0.228. This means that around 1,502 days are takenup by eclipses in one Saros cycle, making the theoretical probability that aneclipse falls on any given day 22.8 %. And yet the number of eclipses that fallon Feriale antiquissimum days are 31 ÷ 49, corresponding to 63.3 %. In otherwords, during the Saros cycle that corresponds to the first 19 years of theNuman cycle, the frequency with which solar eclipses occur on Ferialeantiquissimum feast days is almost three times the theoretical frequency (63.3 %as against 22.8 %).There is another, parallel line of reasoning that allows us to obtain the sameresult: if the theoretical probability that an eclipse falls on any feast day isequal to 22.8 %, it requires more than 4 eclipses to reach 100 % certainty. Butif the number of eclipses in one Saros cycle totals 49 in all, around 12 of them(= 49 ÷ 4) should theoretically fall on a feast day; and yet 31 eclipses fall onfeast days, more than three times the theoretical probability.If we now consider just the total eclipses in Table 15.1, we find that 18 out of28 eclipses fall on feast days, corresponding to a percentage of 64.3 %: * 7 eclipses fall precisely on a feast day: on 27 February 01, 9 June 05, 15 October 07, 15 October 08, 23 March 09, 13 September 18, and 15 March 19; * 9 eclipses fall at a one-day interval—either before or after—from a feast day: on 26 August 01, 4 July 03, 4 July 04, 16 April 07, 16 April 08, 20 February 10, 10 May 15, 10 May 16 and 16 March 18; * 2 eclipses fall at a two-day interval from a feast day: on 27 July 11, 27 July 12.All in all, 44 (= 7 + 9 eclipses × 3 days + 2 eclipses × 5 days) days out of the355 day year are taken up with eclipses, corresponding to a percentage of12.4 %. Eclipses fall on feast days more than five times more frequently thantheoretical probability: 64.3 compared with 12.4.5This is a clear demonstration that the nameless creator of the Numan calendarand cycle possessed considerable astronomical and mathematical knowledge.For a counterproof that these calculations are correct, it is sufficient tocompare the dates of the theoretical eclipses calculated above with thehistorical eclipses recorded at and around the turn of the 21st century.According to the ephemeris,6 if we designate the first total solar eclipse in animaginary modern-day Numan cycle as the eclipse recorded on 18 March 1988, andthen calculate the total and partial solar and lunar eclipses that occurred overthe following 6,585 days, up to 29 March 2006, we obtain the following results(see Table 15.3).Table 15.3Theoretical and historical eclipsesTheoretical EclipsesHistorical EclipsesTheoretical EclipsesHistorical EclipsesDay of theoretical eclipseDay of historical eclipseType of historical eclipseDay of theoretical eclipseDay of historical eclipseType of historical eclipse11◯Tot.3,307 162162●Par.3,4553,455◯Par.177177◯Tot.3,4703,469●Tot.340339●Tot.3,6323,632◯Tot.354354◯Par.3,6473,647●Par.502 3,795●Par.517517●Tot.3,8093,809◯Tot.532531◯Par.3,8243,824●Par.679679◯Tot.3,9723,971●Par.694693●Tot.3,9873,987◯Tot.709 4,1494,149●Par.856856◯Tot.4,1644,163◯Tot.871871●Par.4,3264,326●Tot.1,0341,033◯Tot.4,3414,341◯Par.1,0481,048●Par.4,4894,488◯Par. 1,196●Par.4,5034,503●Tot.1,2111,210◯Tot.4,5184,518◯Par.1,2251,225●Par.4,6664,665◯Par.1,3731,373●Par.4,6814,680●Tot.1,3881,387◯Tot.4,695 1,5501,550●Par.4,8434,843◯Tot.1,5651,565◯Tot.4,8584,857●Par.1,7281,727●Tot.5,0205,019◯Tot.1,7421,742◯Par.5,0355,035●Par.1,8901,890◯Par. 5,182●Par.1,9051,904●Tot.5,1975,197 Tot.1,919 5,2125,211●Par.2,0672,066◯Par.5,3605,360●Par.2,0822,082●Tot.5,3745,374◯Tot.2,097 5,5375,537●Tot.2,2442,244◯Tot.5,5525,552◯Tot.2,2592,259●Par.5,7145,714●Tot.2,4212,421◯Tot.5,7295,728◯Tot.2,4362,436●Par.5,8765,876◯Par. 2,584●Par.5,8915,891●Tot.2,5992,598◯Tot.5,906 2,613 6,0546,054◯Par.2,7612,760●Par.6,0686,068●Tot.2,7762,776◯Tot.6,083 2,9382,938●Tot.6,2316,230◯Tot.2,9532,952◯Par.6,2466,246●Par.3,101 6,4086,408◯Tot.3,1153,115●Tot.6,4236,422●Par.3,1303,130◯Par. 6,570●Par.3,2783,278◯Tot.6,5856,585◯Tot.3,2933,293●Par. Solar eclipse (◯), lunar eclipse (●). The theoretical eclipses column replicatesColumn C (Eclipse days) in Tables 15.1 and 15.2The theoretical series we have composed and the historical series concordperfectly, both in terms of dates and eclipse types. The few exceptions thatoccur crop up because the historical eclipse that starts off our series, whichoccurred on 18 March 1988, took place when the Sun and Moon were around 4.5°from the node, rather that at the node itself.Returning to the relationship between eclipses and Roman feast days (seeTables 15.1 and 15.2), we may note that a large number of the 84 solar and lunareclipses in the Saros cycle that begins on 1 March in year one of the Numancycle and concludes on 15 March of year nineteen, occur (some of them multipletimes) on the same Numan year feast day. It follows that certain days in theNuman year become days for celebrating the anniversary of an eclipse even duringyears when no eclipse takes place (see Table 15.4).Table 15.4The Saros cycle in the first 19 years of the Numan cycleCycle yearsMar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.Jan.Feb.1◯ ●◯ ●◯2 ◯●◯ ◯●◯3 ◯● ◯● 4 ◯● ●◯ 5 ●◯ ●◯ 6 ◯●◯ ◯●◯ 7 ◯● ◯● 8 ◯● ●◯ 9●◯ ●◯ ◯10●◯ ◯● ◯●11 ◯● ●◯ 12 ● ●◯ 13 ◯●◯ ◯●◯ 14 ◯● ◯● 15 ◯● ●◯ 16 ●◯ ●◯ 17◯●◯ ◯●◯ 18◯● ◯● 19◯ Solar eclipse (◯), lunar eclipse (●)A few things are worth noting. First, the type of feast days associated witheclipses: Laralia, Lemuria, Feralia, Parentalia, Laribus are all celebrations ofancestors, the deceased and the dead, which in some way are associated with theafterlife. This confirms that eclipses represent a moment when the exceptionalconfiguration of the celestial bodies in the sky favours communication betweenthe macro- and microcosm in both directions, upwards and downwards.The second fact of note regards the names of feast days and/or the divinitiescelebrated. The above-mentioned feasts—along with others such as Volturnus,Furrina, Neptunus, Fortuna, Iuturna, Carmenta and Saturnus—are of Etruscanorigin. Could this be a clue to the origin of the “barbarian superior toPythagoras” who schooled King Numa?The third fact regards female initiation ceremonies. The Tigillum sororium feaston 1 October—the date of the mythical duel between the Horatii and theCuriatii—is associated with the rites of passage (initiation rites for male andfemale adolescents) and marks the beginning of the process. The feast day of 15March, Anna Perenna, in which “virginal blood is poured on the goddess’s sacredwood”, heralds the end of the process, at least as far as women are concerned(see Chap. 14 [A324790_1_En_14_Chapter.html]). The former of these feast dayscoincides with the 16th, 35th and 37th lunar eclipses; the latter coincides withthe 47th and 49th solar eclipses (see Tables 15.1 and 15.2). Half a month afterthe conclusion of female initiation rites is the Veneralia, celebrated on 1April, when Roman women celebrate marriage; in the most auspicious of years, theplanet Venus/Hesperus is in lower conjunction with the Sun (see Chap. 10[A324790_1_En_10_Chapter.html]). As Manilius writes,> Who after this can doubt that a link exists between heaven and man?7And yet Manilius penned this lines several centuries after somebody had taughtNuma how it all worked.The fourth thing worth noting is how the Saros cycle concludes. The 48th totaleclipse of the Sun—i.e. the last but one of the cycle (see Table 15.1)—just sohappens to fall on the most important feast day of the whole year. The EpulumIovi Iunoni Minervae, on 13 September, recalls the foundation, the dies natalis,of the temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad. The high point of the feast isthe moment when earthly people dare to touch the statue of the god with a humanhand as they paint him with minium, symbolically representing the return to fullpower of the Sun as it leaves its temporary state of eclipse.Before we conclude, there is one more (seemingly) spurious comment to add: if wehad followed the inverse procedure to the one described above, we would haveobtained the same result. In effect, if we had hypothesized that the feast daysin the Numan calendar mark eclipses, we could have taken a Numan year with theFeriale antiquissimum festivities, inserted it into the appropriate cycle withthe appropriate intercalations, totted up the interval of time between a certainnumber of these festivities, and obtained the interval of time between thevarious eclipses calculated within a Saros cycle. These intervals oftime—characteristic of the cycle of eclipses—would have been “conclusive” torecognizing the existence of such a cycle. As, indeed, they were not so manyyears ago, in interpreting the Table of Eclipses in the Mayan “Dresden Codex”.8One final, fundamental thing must be noted: lunar eclipses are visible from theentire half of the globe which, at the time of the eclipse, is in darkness. Thesame, however, does not apply to solar eclipses, which are only visible along athin, long strip around the half of the Earth in daylight at the time of theeclipse. In consequence, out of all the solar and lunar eclipses calculated forthe first 19 years of the Numan cycle, only around half of the lunar and anextremely small number—perhaps even none—of the solar eclipses would have beenvisible from Rome.This confirms what we said at the beginning: for at least some of its feastdays, the Numan calendar is a theoretical calendar that could be used to predicteclipses: it “could be used” even if the predicted eclipse would not necessarilybe visible from Rome itself, particularly if the eclipse was a solar eclipse.Footnotes1The following calculations are restricted to the duration of the Saros cycle, inpart as a result of doubts regarding about intercalations during the final8 years of the Numan cycle (see Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]); the onlyrequisite for these calculations to remain valid is for year eighteen not to bean intercalated year (see Table 4. 1 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]). 2See Chap. 2 [A324790_1_En_2_Chapter.html]. 3The list of total solar eclipses in Table 15.1 (and subsequent tables) are thosethat arise from calculations performed as described above, circumscribed to theeclipse season as defined in Chap. 13 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]; inconsequence, they are “theoretical eclipses”. Total lunar eclipse dates are alsotheoretical. It should be noted, however, that these calculations incorporatethe corrections proposed by Pannekoek 1989, p. 59, based on the actual variationof the Moon’s angle and the Sun’s velocity, and their distribution within eachof the Saros series. 4Servius, ad Aen., 5.738: hic autem dies […] inchoat […] secundum Etruscos […] asexta hora diei, secundum Romanos a media nocte. 5These calculations have been revised and completed on the basis of observationsby Lewis Licht and John T.

ROMAN AND MESOPOTAMIAN ECLIPSES: THE FEAST DAYS OF THE REGIFUGIUM ANDVESTALIALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Since the most ancient of times, eclipses—solar eclipses in particular—have beenviewed as harbingers of misfortune. It was for this reason that in Babyloniantimes enormous efforts were made to predict eclipses and avert their mostill-starred effects on the King, who was the earthly representative of the godwho is represented in the sky by the Sun. The existence of a Mesopotamian ritualfor warding off the evil consequences of eclipses (documented particularly underthe reigns of Asarhaddon from 680 to 669 BCE, and Assurbanipal from 668 to 627BCE) and the legendary tale, traditionally dated to 509 BCE, of the Kings beingchased out of Rome reveal a similar conceptual approach by two civilizationswhich, as history would have it, never came into contact.In the Babylonian sar puhi ritual—the term literally means “substitute King”1—during the immediate lead-up to an eclipse announced by obscure presages andpredicted by high-priest astronomers as fatal for the King, the King wasreplaced by a saklu,> a term which, in general, designates a common, ingenuous man who may even be> somewhat simple […] without social importance, whose destiny is of little> interest to anyone.The saklu, who potentially may have heard tell of a prophecy that he wouldassume regal powers, dons the garb and badges of royalty, enters the palace,sits on the throne, and occupies the royal bed with a virgin married speciallyfor the occasion. His reign lasts “three months and ten days”. In the meantime,while continuing his de facto reign, the real King resides in a sacredenclosure—known as a qersu, or “block, reed hedge”—while he waits for the dangerrepresented by the eclipse to pass. After 100 days, the saklu and his unluckycompanion are put to death, their clothes and baubles burnt, and> the country and the King both go through a general process of purification […]> To finish this off, a deep ‘cleanse’ is required of the palace, after its> apparent ‘contamination’ by the presence of the now defunct stand-in. This> operation was undertaken in six phases (carried out, perhaps, over the same> number of days […]), each of which regarded one of the building’s key areas:> four were for the main entrances, one for the ‘court room’ which, in all> likelihood, was the throne room, and the other was for the Divan, where during> the day the king granted audiences, received his subjects, made and made> public his rulings […] Only then would the King return to his palace and once> more take up his role and public life. The death of his substitute marked the> end of any danger to his person and, in consequence, to his people and his> country.The Roman version runs thus: * in the Regifugium, on 24 February, the king makes a sacrifice at the Comitium and then flees,2 to be substituted by the interrex, the “inter-king”, who takes his place during the final five days of February; * there was a solar eclipse on 27 February in year one of the Numan cycle, 12 lunations after the eclipse of 1 March (see Table 15. 1 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]); * the last Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquin the Superb (535–509 BCE), had evil omens including> a horrid sight! from between the altars a snake> came forth and snatched the sacrificial meat from the dead fires,3and in a dream the King comes upon a ram which charges and knocks him over.Then, Tarquin,> prostrate on the ground, wounded gravely,> raises his eyes to the heavens to witness an event immense> and full of wonder: the Sun’s flaming disc> spews forth rays and melts away to its right,> reversing its path across the heavens.4The Roman version also has its “simpleton”, who is> the prudent Brutus [who] feigned to be a fool,> in order that from thy snares, Tarquin the Proud, dread king, he might be> safe;and it is Brutus, the one whom the prophecy predicts:> ‘He who shall first have kissed his mother will be victorious’,as he is the only one to realize that the “mother” in question is Mother Earth.It is Brutus once more who avenged the outrage perpetrated on Lucretia,> as the Sun was making ready to hide his face,5and who expelled Tarquin from the throne, “substituting him” once and for allwith the revolutionary sar puhi that marked the birth of the Republic, and whichis recalled by the Regifugium feast day.All of this occurs during the five days that follow on from the Terminalia on 23February, as we saw in Chaps. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html] and 7[A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]:> The Terminalia [are so called] because this day is set as the last day of the> year; for the twelfth month was February, and when the extra month is inserted> the last 5 days are taken off the twelfth month.6If, then, starting from the Terminalia “the last 5 days are taken off” fromFebruary, what remains are 31 days in March, 29 in April, 31 in May and 9 inJune to make one hundred days, or the “three months and ten days” during whichthe King—in Babylonia—remained isolated in his “reed hedge”, for the length oftime that he was imperilled by the eclipse.In Rome, around 9 June, a purification ceremony was held for> this little spot, which now supports the Hall of Vesta,> [that] was then the great palace of unshorn Numa.The ceremony lasted a whole novena: it began on 7 June, when the house of theGoddess was thrown open next to the Regia (Fig. 16.1); it reached its height on9 June7 and concluded on 15 June with two days of initial and finalpurification, both of which share the same nundinal letter: C.

The House of Vesta is nearthe Royal Palace (see this chapter.). The temple of Saturn is near the base ofthe Capitol (see Chap. 23 [A324790_1_En_23_Chapter.html]), not far from theMundus which coincides with the Umbilicus Urbis (see Chap. 23[A324790_1_En_23_Chapter.html]). The temple of Ianus Geminus (see Chap. 23[A324790_1_En_23_Chapter.html]) should be located midway between the niger lapisand the temple of Cloacina. (from Coarelli 1983)> the day on which thou, O Tiber, dost send the filth of Vesta’s temple> down the Etruscan water to the sea.8Varro has the following to say about 15 June:> The day which is called ‘When the dung has been carried out, Right,’ is named> from this, that on this day the dung is swept out of the Temple of Vesta and> is carried away along the Capitoline Incline to a certain spot.9One may legitimately wonder why such a ritual was institutionalized in Romewhere its underlying reason simply did not pertain: there is no lack of firewoodin Rome or in the Latium region, and there is no need to go looking for otherraw materials to put on the fire, though that could not be said about Ancient ormodern Mesopotamia. In a modern-day account of Iraq we read the following:> Girls help their mothers or older sisters gather fuel (brushwood or dried> animal dung), as well as keep the house supplied with water, and cook.10It is almost as if we obtain a glimpse, living and breathing, of the last heirsto the Vestals, as we follow a trajectory the origins of which is lost in thelong night of history… though not Roman history.The same might be said of the relationship between the Babylonian sar puhi andRome’s Regifugium. How can the latter possibly be independent of the former? Andif it is not independent, how ever did it make the journey from Babylon to Rome?Footnotes1See Bottéro 1991, pp. 145–165; this documentation and translated sources arehis. 2Plutarch, Quaestiones Romanae, 63. 3The Regifugium is narrated by Ovid in Fasti, 2.685-852. Quoted here are lines711-2: […]nefas visu, mediis altaribus anguis / exit et extinctis ignibus extarapit. 4Cicero, de divinatione, 1.44, citing Accio’s Brutus: exim prostratum terra,graviter saucium, / resupinum in caelo contueri maxumum ac / mirificum facinus:dextrorsum orbem flammeum / radiatum solis liquier cursu novo. 5Ovid, Fasti, 2.717-8, 713-4, 786: Brutus erat stulti sapiens imitator, ut esset/ tutus ab insidiis, dire Superbe, tuis; […] ‘Matri / qui dederit princepsoscula victor erit.’; […] condere iam voltus sole parante suos.The Latin stultus specifically indicates a “fool or imbecile”; then again, thevery name Brutus means “dumb (like an animal)”. 6Varro, de lingua latina, 6.13; see n. 7.1. 79 June is the date of the 12th total solar eclipse, on the 1,565th day of theSaros cycle; 27 February is the date of the third, on the 354th day (seeTable 15. 1 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]). Therefore, a total of 1,211 (=1,565 – 354) days elapse between these two eclipses, or if you prefer, 41lunations. It transpires that one of the two intervals of time after which aneclipse is almost always repeated is 41 lunations (the other is 47 lunations). 8Ovid, Fasti, 6.263-4 and 713-4: hic locus exiguus, qui sustinet Atria Vestae, /tunc erat intonsi regia magna Numae; […] haec est illa dies, qua tu purgaminaVestae, / Thybri, per Etruscas in mare mittis aquas. 9Varro, de lingua latina, 6.32: Dies qui vocatur ‘Quando Stercus Delatum Fas’, abeo appellatus, quod eo die ex aede Vestae stercus everritur et per CapitolinumClivum in locum defertur certum. 10Fiorina 1985, pp. 72–74."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1717. THE REVOLUTION OF THE LINE OF NODES AND THE FEAST DAYS OF OCTOBER EQUUS,FORDICIDIA AND PARILIALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The lunar nodes are the points where the Moon’s apparent orbit, which isinclined by 5.1° with respect to the ecliptic, intersects the Sun’s apparentorbit. The nodes are referred to as either the ascendant node or the descendantnode, depending upon whether, during its transit, the Moon moves from a negativelatitude to a positive latitude, or vice versa (see Chap. 13 and Fig. 13. 6[A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]). The line that joins these two nodes is known asthe line of nodes.According to astrological tradition, the two nodes are known as the Head andTail of the Dragon, because the ancients imagined that a giant dragon lay alongthe ecliptic, its head on the ascendant node and its tail on the descendant node(Figs. 17.1 and 17.2), poised to cause much-feared eclipses by devouring eitherthe Sun or the Moon.A324790_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 17.1The Head and Tail of the Dragon in a “modern” representation—from Albumasar, demagnis coniunctionibus, Augusta Vindelicorum, 1489A324790_1_En_17_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_17_Fig2_HTML.gif]Fig. 17.2The Moon’s Nodes, i.e. the Head and Tail of the Dragon—from Athanasius Kircher,Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae, Amsterdam 1671. This xylography explains how tocalculate and predict eclipses: the lunar nodes—the Head and Tail of theDragon—rotate, and eclipses occur alternately in the signs of Aquarius, Taurus,Capricorn, etc., up to Leo and ScorpioAs we have seen (see Chap. 13 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]), the nodes rotatealong the ecliptic in a retrograde direction, “heading towards” the Sun and theMoon, which rotate in direct motion. It therefore follows that the Sun and theMoon pass back through a given node before they pass back through the same pointon their respective orbits (see again Fig. 13. 8[A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]): the draconitic year—also known as the eclipseyear—is 346.62 days long, while the draconitic month lasts 27.2122 days.The lunar nodes—and, in consequence, the line of nodes—complete their retrograderevolution with respect to the fixed stars in around 6,793 days, at a rate ofaround −0.0530 degrees per day.1The 6,793th day in the Numan cycle corresponds to 14 October in the nineteenthyear (see Table 4. 1 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html] and S. C.). On this day, theDragon’s Head and Tail return to the position they occupied on the first day ofthe cycle. The following day—15 October—in Ancient Rome was October Equus, acelebration at which a horse’s head and tail were chopped off.2Six lunations earlier or later3 than the October Equus, on 15 April, is thefeast day of Fordicidia. Half an eclipse year—in other words, 173 days—beforethe October Equus, on 21 April,4 is when the feast of Parilia occurs.These three celebrations share common elements in their rituals and astronomy: * Rites: the blood from the tail of the horse sacrificed on 15 October, mixed with ashes from calves taken from their mothers’ wombs on 15 April and empty, dried fava bean husks, is used for the suffumigation prepared by the Vestals for 21 April. Ovid writes: > Ye people, go fetch materials for fumigation from the Virgin’s altar. > Vesta will give them; by Vesta’s gift ye shall be pure. > The materials for fumigation will be the blood of a horse and the ashes of > a calf; > the third thing will be the empty stalks of hard beans.5 * Astronomy: if one node coincides with the October Equus, the other coincides with the Fordicidia; if an eclipse occurs for the October Equus, it is likely that the previous or next eclipse will (have) fall(en) on the Fordicidia; if the Sun transits through a node at Parilia, it will transit through the other node on the October Equus.The 15 April celebration is a feast of spring, to propitiate a more plentifulharvest and larger flocks and herds:> […] the year proved more fruitful,> and Earth and cattle yielded their increase.6The 15 October celebration is an autumn feast,> for the harvest received.7The celebration on 21 April coincided with the traditional date of Rome’sfoundation. Logically, the node through which the Sun passed at that moment—inan ideal, as yet still to be identified year—should be the ascendant node, theHead of the Dragon, which “like a beneficent star […] signifies dominion,fortune and riches”. By the following 15 October, the Sun would be transitingthe descendant node, the Tail of the Dragon, which, “signifying degeneration,misfortune and poverty”, and “cold and corruptive”,8 is, according to Pliny,similar to how the horse’s blood “corrodes the ulcers and attacks the sides”.9With the right intercalation, three solar eclipses take place in concomitancewith the Fordicidia, two of which are total (in year seven and year eight of theNuman cycle), plus one partial solar eclipse in year seventeen. The two totaleclipses take place at one node, while the partial eclipse takes place at theother. A further three solar eclipses take place in concomitance with theOctober Equus, in the same years, and with the same characteristics (seeTable 15. 1 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]).This information is insufficient to establish whether—in an as yet to beidentified year, as noted earlier—the ascendant node through which the Sunpasses at the Fordicidia, and therefore at the Parilia too, is that of the totaleclipse of years seven and eight, or the partial eclipse of year seventeen. Ifwe prefer the hypothesis of the pair of total eclipses, we find that the totaleclipse of the Sun on 1 March in year one takes place with the Sun and Moon bothnear the descendant node (see Table 15. 4 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]).Footnotes10.0530 = 360 ÷ 6.793. 2Polybius 12.4b; Plutarch, Quaestiones Romanae, 97; Festus, p. 190-1L1; PaulusDiaconus, p. 246L1. 3Counting inclusively, we have 179 days before and 178 days after 15 October:179 days = 15 days in April + 149 in May, June, July, August and September + 15in October; 178 days = 17 days in October + 146 in November, December, January,February and March + 15 in April. 4173 days = 9 days in April + 149 in May, June, July, August and September + 15in October. 5Ovid, Fasti, 4.731-4: I, pete virginea, populus, suffimen ab ara: / Vesta dabit,Vestae munere purus eris. / Sanguis equi suffimen erit vitulique favilla, /tertia res durae culmen inane fabae. 6Ovid, Fasti, 4.671-2: […] fecundior annus / provenit, et fructum terra pecusqueferunt. 7Paulus Diaconus, p. 246L1: ob frugum eventum. 8For the Head of the Dragon, please see: Alchabitius, Libellus isagogigus 1512,fo. 45r; for the Tail of the Dragon, see: Ex libris Mysteriorum Apomasaris, inCCAG XII, p. 102.

THE ASCENDANT NODE AT THE FIRST POINT OF ARIES AND THE FESTIVAL OF SUMMANUSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The Earth’s annual revolution around the Sun takes place along the eclipticplane. The Earth’s daily rotation around its own axis takes place on the planeof the celestial equator, which is inclined 23.5° with respect to the ecliptic.In consequence, the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator at two points: theFirst Point of Aries (also known as the Gamma Point), and the First Point ofLibra . Viewed from the Earth, the Sun passes through the First Point of Arieson 21 March, at the spring equinox, and through the First Point of Libra on 23September, at the autumn equinox (see Fig. 18.1).A324790_1_En_18_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_18_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 18.1The Earth’s motion around the Sun. Viewed from the Earth, the Sun moves throughthe First Point of Aries on 21 March, the Spring Equinox, and through the Pointof Libra on 23 September, the Autumn EquinoxThe retrograde revolution of the lunar nodes along the ecliptic means that theascendant and descendant nodes alternately transit through the First Point ofAries roughly every 3,396 days.1When the ascendant node transits through the First Point of Aries, during onehalf lunation the Moon’s declination—that is to say, its height in thesky—diminishes dramatically, by more than 57°2 (see Fig. 18.2).A324790_1_En_18_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_18_Fig2_HTML.gif]Fig. 18.2The lunar nodes and their passage from the Points of Aries and Libra. When theascendant node moves through the First Point of Aries, the Moon’s declinationdiminishes by more than 57° during one half lunation; when the descendant nodetransits through the First Point of Aries, the Moon’s declination diminishes byalmost 37° during one half lunation. (from Romano 1985)In such cases, at the beginning of the lunation the initial crescent Moon risesand sets further north than the Sun does at the summer solstice; two weekslater, the full Moon rises and sets further south than the Sun at its wintersolstice . The points on the horizon where the Moon rises and sets are known asthe upper and lower major standstills (see Fig. 18.3).A324790_1_En_18_Fig3_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_18_Fig3_HTML.gif]Fig. 18.3The Moon’s standstills. Major standstills and minor standstills (at a 51° Northlatitude, such as London or Paris). (from North 2008)When, on the contrary, the descendant node transits through the First Point ofAries, during one half lunation the Moon’s declination diminishes by a lessdramatic 37°3 (see again Fig. 18.2). In such cases, at the beginning of thelunation the initial crescent Moon rises closer to the east and sets closer tothe west than the Sun at its summer solstice; two weeks later, the full Moonrises closer to the east and sets closer to the west than the Sun at its wintersolstice . The points on the horizon where the Moon rises and sets are known asthe upper and lower minor standstills (see again Fig. 18.3).4Let’s suppose—as we have just seen—that on 1 March of year one in the Numancycle, the Sun is close to the descendant node and is in eclipse (see Chap. 17[A324790_1_En_17_Chapter.html] and Table 15. 4 [A324790_1_En_15_Chapter.html]),the new Moon will also be close to the descendant node. On that day, the nodeitself is close to the First Point of Aries, so the half lunation that commencessees the Moon’s declination diminish by roughly 37°: the crescent Moon rises atthe upper minor standstill and, fifteen days later, the full Moon rises at thelower minor standstill.The ascendant node will consequently transit through the First Point of Aries3,396 days later, on 20 June in year ten (see Tables 4. 1[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html] and S. C.), on the feast of Summanus and close tothe summer solstice. The Moon is, once again, new5: the first crescent rises atthe upper major standstill and, fifteen days later, the full Moon rises at thelower major standstill. Viewers from Earth witness an extraordinary and worryingspectacle as the Moon “falls” by over 57°.Conversely, if we presume that on 1 March of year one in the Numan cycle, theSun is close to the ascendant node, the two celestial events described abovewould take place on the same dates, but in an inverted manner: initially, on 1March of year one, the more “dramatic” event; finally, on 20 June in year ten,the less dramatic.On the latter day, the statue of the deity who falls from the heights of theTemple of Jupiter Capitoline, his head ending up in the river, re-evokes thisexceptional and worrying celestial phenomenon and, using the power of symbolism,replicates it in an earthly setting. Cicero recalls the myth in these words:> When the statue of Summanus, which was still made of terracotta at that time,> was struck by lightning on the pediment of the temple of Jupiter Optimus> Maximus, no one was able to find its head, until the soothsayers said it had> been knocked off into the Tiber, where indeed it was found, in the exact spot> the soothsayers predicted.6This episode took place in 278 BCE, when the Romans could no longer be sure whothe god Summanus really was. All they knew was that the bolt of lightning thathit the statue was hurled by Jupiter himself7: the lunar cult was being replacedby a solar cult…Notwithstanding this, the more or less magnificent spectacle of the Moon fallingfrom on high continues to play itself out in the sky alternately every3,396 days.To conclude, one final observation: it goes without saying that it is impossiblefor a node to pass through the First Point of Aries every 20 June in every yearof the Numan cycle; if this transit occurs on 20 June in year ten, then that isthe only true feast to Summanus, and all other feasts are merely anniversariesof the occasion.Footnotes13,396 = 6,793 ÷ 2. 2The Earth’s axis is inclined 23.5° with respect to the ecliptic; the plane onwhich the Moon revolves around the Earth is inclined by 5.1° with respect to theecliptic. When, as we find here, these two inclinations are added together, overthe course of two weeks the Moon’s declination varies from +28.6° (=23.5° + 5.1°) to –28.6°, i.e. 57.2°. 3In such cases, the two inclinations (see preceding footnote) are subtracted;over the course of two weeks the Moon’s declination varies from +18.4° (= 23.5°– 5.1°) to –18.4°, i.e. 36.8°. 4See Romano 1994, pp. 163-6. 53,396.019 = 115 × 29.5306. 6Cicero, de divinatione, 1.16: […] cum Summanus in fastigio Iovis optumi maximi,qui tum erat fictilis, e caelo ictus esset nec usquam eius simulacri caputinveniretur, haruspices in Tiberim id depulsum esse dixerunt, idque inventum esteo loco, qui est ab haruspicibus demonstratus. 7Epitome, Livy, 14."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_1919. THE REVOLUTION OF THE LINE OF APSIDES, AND THE FEAST OF COMPITALIALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The Moon’s orbit around the Earth is elliptical. The Moon’s distance from theEarth fluctuates roughly from a minimum of 356,500 km to a maximum of406,500 km, and works out at an average of 381,500 km. The difference betweenminimum and maximum is around 6.5 % more or less than the average value. Thisdifference is unaltered by the Moon’s angular diameter, which varies from 29°30′when the Moon is at its greatest distance from Earth, to 33°50′ when the Moon isat its closest.Yet, at its closest, the Moon’s surface appears to be 30 %1 larger than itssurface when it is at its most distant, as anybody may see with the naked eyefrom Earth (see Fig. 19.1).A324790_1_En_19_Fig1_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_19_Fig1_HTML.jpg]Fig. 19.1The Moonat perigeeand apogee.

(from http:// www. fourmilab. ch/earthview/ moon_ ap_ per [http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per])The closest and furthest points on the Moon’s orbit around the Earth are knownas the lunar perigee and apogee .2 The line that runs through these twopoints—the line of apsides —revolves in a counter-clockwise, or direct motion,direction (see Fig. 19.2) and completes a revolution with respect to the fixedstars in around 3,233 days, at a rate of +0.11143 degrees per day.A324790_1_En_19_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_19_Fig2_HTML.gif]Fig. 19.2The Moon’s orbit around the Earth, the line of apsidesand the Black Moon. TheMoon’s orbit is elliptical: the point closest to the Earth is the lunar perigee,and its farthest point its apogee. The line that connects these two points isknown as the line of apsides , and it moves in an anticlockwise direction. TheEarth occupies one of the two focuses on the ellipsis; the Black Moon —afictitious heavenly body in astrology—occupies the other. “Viewed” from theEarth, the Black Moon is always near the lunar apogee, and moves in ananti-clockwise directionAs the Moon also follows the same direct motion, it takes longer to returnthrough the perigee—an anomalistic month —than it does to return to the sameposition with respect to the fixed stars—a sidereal month —and return throughthe same node—a draconitic month . An anomalistic month lasts 27.5546 days; asidereal month lasts 27.3216 days; and a draconitic month lasts 27.2122 days(see Chap. 13 and Table 13. 1 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html#Tab1]).The Moon’s motion along its own orbit is not related to its position withrespect to the Sun. In consequence, at apogee or perigee, the Moon might be inany phase: new, waxing, first quarter, full, last quarter, or waning. In itsmotion, however:> The Moon appears to travel along the circle of the Zodiac in an irregular> manner: if, to begin with, the Moon describes a certain arc, the following day> it travels a wider arc, and in the days after that, it journeys along> increasingly wider arcs, until it reaches its greatest arc; then the Moon> describes increasingly smaller arcs, until it returns to the smallest arc from> which it started. The interval of time between the minimum movement and the> next minimum is known as an anomalistic revolution.Geminus, a Greek astronomer from the first century BCE, thus describes aspecific characteristic of the Moon’s extremely complex motion. He explains:> Astronomical observation shows that the Exeligmos 4 comprises 669 full months> and 19,756 days. In this span of time, the Moon completes 717 anomalistic> revolutions in longitude and, at the same time, completes 723 circles of the> Zodiac plus 32°.5One problem arising from these observations and data—all of which are ofMesopotamian origin, as the author himself notes—unnecessarily taxed the mindsof Hellenistic Greece’s greatest (and other) astronomers:> What uniform and ordered movements may explain the apparent motion of the> planets?6Here we have an emblematic example of how prejudice trumps reason: who ever saidthat real movements should be “uniform and ordered”, when the apparentmotion—the “phenomena”—are variable and disordered?Long before Renaissance astronomers in Europe—Kepler, to be precise—resolved theproblem by explaining that the Moon’s motion is irregular because it follows anelliptical rather than a circular orbit, Geminus tackled and resolved a smallerissue regarding the Moon’s anomalous motion:> With the assistance of these ancient observations on apparent motion, it was> necessary to establish the Moon’s daily longitudinal anomaly by calculating> its minimum, maximum and average movements, along with its daily increase or> decrease […] The result is that the Moon’s minimum movement amounts to> 11°6′35″, its average to 13°10′35″, and its maximum to 15°14′35″; and that the> daily increase is equivalent to 18′.7The most interesting thing about Geminus’s reasoning is that the Moon’s“irregular” movement—this is what the Greek term “anomalous” refers to—has threepossible progressions: minimum, average and maximum; a corollary in myth is nothard to find. Indeed, we must return to the 3,233 days of the revolution of theline of apsides . The 3,233rd day of the Numan cycle corresponds to 5 January8in year nine (see Tables 4. 1 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html#Tab1] and S. C.). Onthis day, the line of apsides, together with the lunar perigee and apogee,returns to the same point with respect to the fixed stars as on the first day ofthe cycle.That same day, 5 January, was the feast of Compitalia in Rome. “The crossroads”,as it was known, was a conceptiva or moveable9 feast, which celebrated aparticular aspect of the Moon, represented in the heavens by Hecate Trivia ,patron goddess of the crossroads.It is beyond the scope of this book to investigate the enormous amount ofmaterial available on Hecate. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that: * The most ancient Western chronicler, Hesiod, defines her as the goddess > that Zeus Cronides, of all the gods, honoured: he gave her splendid gifts, > that she may have power over the Earth and over the shining sea: in the > starry sky she too is honoured, revered in the highest by the immortals […] > In effect, of all those born to Gaia and Uranus worthy of honour, she has > her part in all of their privileges10; * on occasion, Hecate is united with/confused with Selene, the “(full) Moon”, with Artemis, the “(final crescent of the waning) Moon”, and with Persephone, the “(new) Moon”; * she is known as Polymorphes, “of the many (different) forms, multiform”; * she is invoked as> trioditis […] heavenly, earthly and of the sea […] the lady to whom the entire> cosmos is entrusted.11Ovid also highlights her triple nature with Janus’s words:> Thou seest Hecate’s faces turned in three directions> that she may guard the crossroads where they branch three several ways12;while Plutarch explicitly identifies Hecate with the Moon, explaining:> Yet it is not with a single motion that she moves; but she is, as somewhere> she is in fact called, “the goddess of three ways” [i.e. Trioditis or Trivia],> for she moves on the Zodiac against the signs in longitude and latitude and in> depth at the same time. Of these movements the mathematicians call the first> ‘revolution,’ the second ‘spiral,’ and the third, I know not why, ‘anomaly’.13Here we have a description of the three motions of the Moon—notably of thethird, “depth”, by which Plutarch means the Moon’s distance from the Earth, itsvariations in the apogee and perigee—that reflects Hecate’s three-facedappearance.Hecate is invoked in a wide variety of occasions: Medea invokes her at midnighton the night of the full Moon, and then again at dawn; also at dawn, she isinvoked by Aeneas and Dido; Demeter comes across her holding a torch aloft, anattribute that turns Hecate into Phosphoros, the “Bringer of light”, just likethe waning Moon or Venus at dawn (see Chap. 11 [A324790_1_En_11_Chapter.html],particularly note 6). Medea “for an entire day” looks after the Goddess’stemple, and “at the first light of dawn” has herself borne there; when, thatmorning, she meets Jason, she pleads with him to attend for the “hour thatsunders the night in two”, for him to honour the Goddess and seek her protectionfor the trial that awaits him—a trial that begins at dawn and concludes atsunset.14There are countless other examples we could add to these in order to demonstratethat Hecate does not personify a specific position or phase of the Moon inrelation to the fixed stars or Sun. A more detailed and analytic investigation15would likely show that, since time immemorial, Hecate has been the idealpersonification of the Black Moon , the Moon at its apogee. It is self-evidentwhy this would be: of the great many appearances the Moon may assume, by far themost mysterious and disquieting is when it is at its apogee, when the changeablenature of the Moon’s motion is compounded by its distance, diminished surfacearea and luminosity.Indeed, in an astrological tradition whose roots are lost in the mists of time,the Black Moon that represents Hecate in the heavens becomes a truly unrealcelestial body, located at the second focus of the elliptical orbit travelled bythe Moon around the Earth. Since the Earth occupies the first focus, observerson Earth always see the Black Moon in the direction of the lunar apogee (seeagain Fig. 19.2); they will always see it revolving anticlockwise with theapogee, and completing its revolution in 3,233 days.On the Compitalia feast that falls on 5 January in year nine of the Numan cycle,the line of apsides—and in particular the apogee, including the BlackMoon—passes through the same longitude as it did 3,233 days earlier, on 1 Marchin year one. The comment at the end of Chap. 18 [A324790_1_En_18_Chapter.html]once again applies: as the line of apsides does not transit through a givenlongitude every 5 January in every year of the Numan cycle, if it makes thetransit on 5 January in year nine, the only true feast to Hecate Trivia ,goddess of the Compitalia, is that particular year; all others are mereanniversaries.Footnotes1The square of 1.065 divided by the square of 0.935 is around 1.30: 1.0652 ÷0.9352 = 1.297. 2Perigee and apogee are constantly varying—either increasing ordecreasing—between the values of minimum perigee and maximum apogee. Yet “theextreme perigees and apogees take place only during the winter in the northernhemisphere, the period of the year when the Earth is closest to the Sun. Forinstance, all 14 closest perigees during a period from 1500 to 2500 CE fallbetween 6 December and 9 February”, notes Meeus 1997, p. 15. He concludes: “Itis evident that the Earth’s variable distance from the Sun somewhat affects theEarth-Moon distance.” 30.1114 = 360 ÷ 3,233. 4See Chap. 13 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html]. 5Geminus, Introduction to the Phenomena, 18.2–18.3. 6Simplicius, Commentary on De Coelo, 2.12. 7Geminus, Introduction to the Phenomena, 18.4–18.5 and 19. 8Please see again note 2. 9It is, of course, true that the moveable feasts in our own calendar, such asEaster, are associated with the motion of the Moon, while our fixed holidays,such as Christmas, are associated with the Sun’s motion. 10Hesiod, Theogony, 411–415 and 421–422: Ἤ δ᾽ ὑποκυσαμένη Ἑκάτην τέκε, τὴν περὶπάντων / Ζεὺς Κρονίδης τίμησε· πόρεν δέ οἱ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα, / μοῖραν ἔχειν γαίης τεκαὶ ἀτρυγέτοιο θαλάσσης. / Ἥ δὲ καὶ ἀστερόεντος ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ ἔμμορε τιμῆς /ἀθανάτοις τε θεοῖσι τετιμένη ἐστὶ μάλιστα […] / Οσσοι γὰρ Γαίης τε καὶ Οὐρανοῦἐξεγένοντο / καὶ τιμὴν ἔλαχον, τούτων ἔχει αἶσαν ἁπάντων. 11Orphic Hymns, 1.1–1.2 and 7: […] τριοδιτιν, / […] ουρανιαν χθονιαν τε καιειναλιαν, / […] παντος κοσμου κληδουχον ανασσαν. 12Ovid, Fasti, 1.141–1.142: Ora vides Hecates in tres vertentia partes, / servetut in ternas compita secta vias. 13Plutarch, de facie, 937E: καιτοι μιαν ου κινειται κινησιν αλλ’, ως που καιλεγεται, Τριοδιτις εστιν, αμα μηκος επι του ζωδιακου και πλατος αντιϕερομενη καιβαθος. ον την μεν περιδρομην την δ’ελικα την δ’ουκ οιδα πως ανωμαλιανονομαζουσιν οι μαθηματικοι. 14See: Ovid, Metamorphosis, 7.179–7.194; Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica, 7.331 and335; Virgil, Aeneid, 6.247 and 255; 4.584–4.585 and 609; Homeric Hymn toDemeter, 52; Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, 3.251, 828 and 842; 956; 1029;1224; 1407. 15In reality, the Goddess’s sphere of competence is worthy of greater study(Hesiod, Theogony, 411–452), as is her relationship with the Lares, especiallythe Lar familiaris who, in the name of and on behalf of Vulcan, at the Matraliaon 11 June conceived Servius Tullius with Ocresia (Ovid, F. 6.627–6.636);Servius Tullius was later to institute the Compitalia (Pliny, NaturalisHistoria, 36.204; Dionysius, Roman Antiquities, 4.14.3; Macrobius, Saturnalia,1.7.34) and, perhaps, establish the Volcanal.As for Vulcan, his Greek counterpart Hephaestus was born to Hera without Zeus’sintervention in response to Zeus’s giving birth to Athena without Hera’sintervention. Similarly, Athena represents the Moon in eclipse, whereasHephaestus represents the Sun in eclipse. The mythical love between Hephaestusand Aphrodite reflects the fact that during a total solar eclipse, in fulldaylight the planet Venus is observable, inevitably in proximity to the Sun."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_2020. COMPOSITION OF THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE LINES OF NODES AND OF APSIDESLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]A revolution of the line of nodes with respect to the fixed stars takes6,793 days (see Chap. 17 [A324790_1_En_17_Chapter.html]); a revolution of theline of apsides with respect to the fixed stars takes 3,233 days (see Chap. 19[A324790_1_En_19_Chapter.html]). The former is retrograde, the latter is direct:their opposite motions add up one to the other.The former travels at a rate of –0.0530 degrees per day; the latter at a rate of+0.1114 degrees per day.1 The sum total is +0.1644 (= 0.0530 + 0.1114) degreesper day, and the two lines coincide again roughly every 2,1902 days.This value approximates to one quarter of the Numan cycle: 2,190 × 4 equals8,760, an absolute error of –6.00 days and a percentage error of 0.068 % withrespect to the 8,766 day cycle.Though this may be a hypothesis, it once again demonstrates the solidity andelegance of the 24-year intercalation cycle (see Chap. 4[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]), as it means that if the two lines begin movingfrom the same degree of longitude on day one of a Numan cycle, they willcoincide a total of four further times within that particular cycle. Table 20.1shows when these hypothetical encounters would occur over the 8,766-day cycle(see Tables 4. 1 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html] and S.

THE NUMAN CYCLE AS A REFERENCE FRAMEWORK FOR CELESTIAL MOTIONLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]A comparison of celestial motion data with data on the Numan calendar and cycleproves that there is a concordance between the cadence of astral movements andthe cadence of calendar feast days.As we have seen, there is in particular a concordance with regard to fourastronomical cycles that are crucial to describing the motion of the Earth, Moonand Sun. To recap, if these four cycles all commence simultaneously on 1 Marchin year one of the Numan cycle, at what can be defined as “the starting point ofastronomical time” (see Chap. 1 [A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]), we note that: * the Saros cycle is completed 6,585 days later, on 15 March in year nineteen, on the feast of Anna Perenna (see Chaps. 13 [A324790_1_En_13_Chapter.html] and 14 [A324790_1_En_14_Chapter.html]); * the revolution of the line of nodes is completed 6,793 days later, on 14 October in year nineteen, the day before the feast of October equus (see Chap. 17 [A324790_1_En_17_Chapter.html]); * if one node—whether descending or ascending makes no difference—transits through the First Point of Aries on the first day of the Numan cycle, the other node—whether ascending or descending makes no difference—transits through this same point 3,396 days later, on 20 June in year ten, at the feast of Summanus (see Chap. 18 [A324790_1_En_18_Chapter.html]); * the revolution of the line of apsides is completed 3,233 days later, on 5 January of year nine, on the feast of Compitalia (see Chap. 19 [A324790_1_En_19_Chapter.html]).What we have here are four separate astronomical events that begin on the sameday and end on four different days in four different years, all four of whichnext fall on feast days that recall myths and rites symbolizing those self-sameastral events. One thing is certain: the myth of Anna Perenna describes aneclipse, while the October equus rite is based on a horse head and tail, and soon. However, the contrary does not apply: the October equus rite does notdescribe an eclipse, and the myth of Anna Perenna is not based on the Head andTail of an animal that symbolizes the Dragon, and so on.What we must now do is ask ourselves what the probability is of these fourconcordances being a coincidence. Each one of them has a probability equal to1 ÷ 355 (one out of the 355 days in the Numan year) which works out at2.8 × 10−3, that is to say, a probability of 0.28 %. Given that the occurrenceof each of these events is independent of the occurrence of the others, theprobability that all four of these events take place corresponds to (1 ÷ 355)4,or 6.3 × 10−11, that is to say, a probability of 6 in 100 billion.So, the probability of this being mere chance is vanishingly small. From here onin, we may assert that the entire 8,766-day Numan cycle is a framework ofreference that not only covers the movement of the Earth, Moon and Sun; itcovers the movement of the planets too.We shall next be investigating how the Numan cycle serves the same function aswhat Mesopotamian astronomy referred to as the Diaries and Goal Year Texts.1Available source material demonstrates that, from at least 747 BCE, theastronomical data contained in the Diaries> were often estimated rather than measured. The date of solstices and equinoxes> and of the heliacal rising of Sirius are recorded, but analysis has shown that> at least during the Seleucid period (311 BCE onwards) these are calculated,> not observed.At the same time,> the Diaries were used to compile a number of chronologically arranged tables> of planetary and lunar phenomena. The tables of eclipse are of particular> interest. The 18-year cycle of lunar eclipses and the succession of eclipse> possibilities at 6 or occasionally 5-month intervals was probably already> known to the Assyrians. Fragments of extensive tables of eclipses giving> regnal year and month give an immediate overview of Babylonian chronology from> 747 BCE onwards, and it may be this source material which enabled Ptolemy to> compile a chronology of the Babylonian, Persian and Seleucid kings.A feature of later Diaries, which date back to 236 BCE, are the Goal Year Texts:> These exploit the known period relations between repeating phenomena of the> Moon and the five planets: 71 years and 83 years for Jupiter, 8 years for> Venus, 46 years for Mercury, 59 years for Saturn, 79 years and 47 years for> Mars, and 18 years for the Moon […]> By looking at the Diary for the appropriate year in the past the scribe could> compile a list of the phenomena to be expected in the year ahead (the Goal> Year).For each of the five planets, a whole series of relationships was known inBabylon, encompassing full multiples of synodic periods, full multiples ofsidereal periods, and full multiples of solar years. Table 21.1 presents some ofthe multiples adopted in earlier and later Goal Year Texts (respectively GYT andGYT2).Table 21.1Planetary period relationsPlanet/SourceSynodic phenomenaSidereal revolutionsSolar yearsSaturn/GYT57259Jupiter/GYT276783Mars/GYT237579Venus/GYT538Mercury/GYT1454646For instance, Table 21.1 shows that over the course of 59 solar years, Saturnhas 57 synodic phenomena of one form or another: heliacal risings, firststations, oppositions to the Sun, second stations or vespertine settings. Moregenerally, in 59 solar years Saturn completes 57 synodic revolutions, that is tosay, it returns 57 times to the same position with respect to the Earth; overthe same period, it completes two sidereal revolutions, that is to say, itreturns to the same position with respect to the fixed stars twice.Table 21.2Planetary period relations with the days, months and years of the Numan cycle inwhich each planet returns to its initial positionPlanetSolaryearsBreakdownof solar yearsinto Numan cyclesand cycle yearsDay, month and yearin which the planet returnsto its initial position with respectto the fixed stars and to the EarthSaturn59=(24 × 2) + 1128 February 11/IIIaJupiter83=(24 × 3) + 1128 February 11/IVMars79=(24 × 3) + 74 March 08/IVVenus24 (=8b × 3) 28 February 24/IMercury46=24 + 221 March 23/IIa24-year Numan cycles are indicated in Roman numerals: 11/III means the eleventhyear of third Numan cyclebGiven that this period is shorter than the Numan cycle, for comparativepurposes we have multiplied by three. As we saw in Chap. 9[A324790_1_En_9_Chapter.html], no. 4, over the 24-year cycle, Venus hascompleted a total of 39 (=13 × 3) revolutions with respect to the fixed starsand of 15 (=5 × 3) revolutions with respect to the EarthAt the end of 59 solar years, Saturn has returned to its original position withrespect to the Earth and to the fixed stars; in other words, it’s as if ithasn’t budged at all. If you are aware of Saturn’s position with respect to theEarth and the stars over a 59-year period, you know where it has been and whereit will be at all times. The same applies to Jupiter after 83 years, to Marsafter 79 years (Fig. 21.1), and so on.A324790_1_En_21_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_21_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 21.1Example of the periodical return of a superior planet to the same position withrespect to the Sun and the fixed stars. Mars—here in retrograde motion nearRegulus, the brightest star in Leo—during two passages 79 years apart: fromNovember 1994 to June 1995, and from November 2073 to June 2074. (from Meeus1997)What we must do now is calculate what these multi-year periodical relationshipcycles for the various planets correspond to in terms of Numan cycles (seeChap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html] and Table 4. 1[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]). To recap, the Numan cycle lasts 24 years, isasymmetrical, and the first 11 years number 4,017 days, which is close to 11solar years. We can now understand why that is: the multi-year cycles of two ofthe superior planets—Saturn and Jupiter (see Table 21.1)—are found by combiningmultiples of 24 with 11: respectively 59 = (24 × 2) + 11 and 83 = (24 × 3) + 11.What we find is that Saturn returns to its initial position with respect to theEarth and the fixed stars at the end of two Numan cycles plus the first 11 yearsof the third, that is to say, on 1 March in year twelve of the third Numancycle, or, if you prefer, day one of the 60th year. The same applies to Jupiter,at the end of three Numan cycles plus the first 11 years of the fourth, that isto say, on 1 March in year twelve of the fourth Numan cycle, or, if you prefer,day one of the 84th year.2Two more things should be borne in mind with regard to Saturn and Jupiter.Table 21.1 shows that, for Saturn, 59 solar years correspond to 57 synodicperiods for the planet: that’s the same as saying that Saturn’s synodic periodlasts around 378 days,3 in line with modern calculations; 378 days happens to bethe length of the intercalated Numan year. Table 21.1 also shows that forJupiter, 83 solar years correspond to 76 synodic periods for the planet: or, inother words, Jupiter’s synodic period lasts around 399 days,4 once again in linewith modern calculations; given that 399 × 22 equals 8,778, it becomes clearthat the Numan cycle is roughly equivalent to 22 of Jupiter’s synodic periods.Now, Mars returns to the position it was originally in on 1 March in year one on4 March of year eight in the fourth cycle, that is to say, in the 80th year fromthe start. Once again, the intercalation adopted fits well, considering thatMars is the closest planet to Earth, and the one with the most irregular motion.For the planet Venus, the multi-year period is just eight years. However, if wemultiply this by three, we find that the third time that the planet returns toits initial position with respect to the fixed stars and to the Earth coincideswith the end of the 8,766-day Numan cycle, on 28 February in year 24.Lastly, Mercury returns to its initial position after 46 solar years, or16,801 days. Adding in the intercalation adopted (see Table 4. 1[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]), this brings us to 1 March in year 23 of thesecond Numan cycle.Table 21.2 shows the relationship between planetary periods and Numan cycles foreach planet. At the end of their respective time periods, all five planets havereturned to their initial position with respect to the Earth and to the fixedstars—once again, it is as if they hadn’t moved an inch. The one remainingproblem is, with respect to the Earth and the fixed stars, how to locate theposition of the planets within each individual interval; once we find this out,we know it for all time, in the past and the future. The place to look for theanswer—if indeed it exists—to this is, not surprisingly, among the festivitiesof the Numan calendar.Footnotes1For more on Mesopotamian astronomy, see Britton-Walker 1996, from which I haveextracted these quotes and the following data; see in particular pp. 50–5. 2If the Numan cycle was divided into three equal parts lasting 2,922 days each,with an alternate intercalation of 20 and 21 days in even-numbered years (seeChap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html], no. 8), Saturn and Jupiter would completetheir multi-year cycles not on 1 March but on 10 March in year 12 of the thirdand fourth Numan cycles respectively. 359 × 365.2422 = 21,549.289; 21,549.289 ÷ 57 = 378.058. 483 × 365.2422 = 30,315.102; 30,315.102 ÷ 76 = 398.88."},{"pageContent":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015Leonardo MaginiStars, Myths and Rituals in Etruscan RomeSpace andSociety10.1007/978-3-319-07266-1_2222. THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR PLANETS AND THE ANCILIA, THE “SACRED SHIELDS”Leonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The first feast day we shall consider is 1 March, day one, year one in the Numancycle. At this starting point in astronomical time, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venusand Mercury are all at a given position with respect to the Earth and the fixedstars—a yet-to-be-determined position; they are set to return to this positionrespectively 59, 83, 79, 24 and 46 years later.In actual fact, 1 March is a feast day for two separate celebrations. The firstregards Mars’s descent to the Earth prior to the conception of Romulus, the actthat marks the start date for calculations of astronomical time (see Chap. 1[A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]). The second regards another no-less-miraculousdescent from the heavens.Once again, Ovid provides arguably the best account of the story:> Soft was the Earth with hoar frost spread like dew at morn,> when the people gathered at the threshold of their king [Numa].> Forth he came and sat him down in their midst upon a throne of maple wood;> unnumbered men stood round him silent.> Scarcely had Phoebus shown a rim above the horizon:> their anxious minds with hope and fear did quake.> The king took his stand, and, his head veiled in a snow-white hood,> lifted up his hands, hands which the gods already knew so well.> And thus he spoke: ‘The time has come to receive> the promised boon; fulfil thy promise, Jupiter.’> Even while he spoke, the Sun had already lifted his full orb above the> horizon,> and a loud crash rang out from heaven’s vault.> Thrice did the god thunder from a cloudless sky, thrice did he hurl his bolts.> Take my word for it: what I say is wonderful but true.> At the zenith the sky began to yawn;> the multitude and their leader lifted up their eyes.> Lo, swaying gently in the light breeze, a shield> fell down. The people sent up a shout that reached the stars.> The king lifted from the ground the gift, but not till he had sacrificed a> heifer,> which had never submitted her neck to the burden of the yoke,> and he called the shield ancile, because it was cut away (re-cisum) on all> sides,> and there was no angle that you could mark.1The astral backdrop to the scene is easy to surmise: the ancile falls in theshort space of time (less than eight minutes) that it takes for the whole of theSun’s disc to cross the threshold of the horizon: “Scarcely had Phoebus (i.e.the Sun) shown a rim above the horizon […] Even while he spoke, the Sun hadalready lifted his full orb above the horizon […]” The signal is given by theloud crash ranging out, literally, “from heaven’s vault”; the sky opens “at thezenith”, traced by the augur’s lithuus.The framework of reference—or the coordinates, one might venture to say,anachronistically—of how the poet portrays the event regards the points known inastrology as the Ascendant, or Horoscope, and Midheaven. The Ascendant is thepoint where the Zodiac intersects with the Earth’s horizon to the east;Midheaven is the meridian that unites north and south, passing through thezenith as seen from the point of observation. We also have the two diametricallyopposite points, Descendant to the west and Imum Coeli at the nadir. These arethe four “cardinal points”—as Manilius2 calls them in his particularly detaileddescription—used in astrology for public and private horoscopes. If we wanted,we could provide a horoscope for the ancile that Jupiter gave the Romans.Ovid has more to say on the matter:> Then, remembering that the fate of empire was bound up with it,> he [Numa] formed a very shrewd design.> He ordered that many shields should be made, wrought after the same pattern,> in order to deceive a traitor’s eyes.> The work was finished by Mamurius; whether he was more perfect in character> or in smithcraft, it would hard for any man to say.> Bountiful Numa said to him, ‘Ask a reward for your service.> If I have a reputation for honesty, you shall not ask in vain.’> He had already named the Salii from their dancing (saltus),> and had given them arms and a song to be sung to a certain tune.> Then Mamurius made answer thus: ‘Give me glory for my reward,> and let my name be chanted at the end of the song.’> Hence the priests pay the reward that was promised> or the work of old, and they invoke Mamurius.3Punctilious as Ovid may have been, he fails to provide the two most tellingdetails: the number of copies Mamurius made of the original ancile, and thenumber of the Salii that carried them in procession, singing, dancing andpraising the ironsmith’s craft. Fortunately, Plutarch steps into give us thenumber of copies made of the shield, that is, eleven, while other authors informus that the priests who carried them numbered twentyfour.4 These are the verysame numbers—in a different arrangement—as the number of years that Saturn andJupiter take to return to their initial position with respect to the Earth andthe fixed stars (see Chap. 21 [A324790_1_En_21_Chapter.html] and Table 21.2).There are further interesting particulars we learn about the Salii: * the priests carry “a light Thracian shield on their left arm, an oblong circular shape with hollowed sides”; * their dances are led by a praesul, “who leaps around at the front”, beating out the rhythm and showing which steps to perform, either amptruare, “moving around forward”, or redamptruare, “moving around backward”; * their ceremonies, lasting 24 days from 1 to 24 March, include mansiones, “stopovers”, where the priests consume sumptuous dinners and then spend the night; * on 1, 9 and 23 March, the priests “move the ancilia”—they carry them to the sacrarium which only they may enter (perhaps the Sacrarium Martis in the Regia); * the Salii’s songs are divided into axamenta, name lists of Gods and divine personages, and versus, songs of praise to the various divinities from whom they took their name (Ianuli, Iunonii, Minervii); * all Salii are “protected by Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus”.Lastly, all of the songs are sung “in harmony with the number of months in theItalic year”, and the ancilia are defined “shields for a single year.”5We may now understand why the shape of the shield that descended from the skiesis so specific, and a particular on which all ancient chroniclers, from Ovid toPlutarch, insist. Indeed, in the passage we have just cited, Plutarch gives thefollowing explanation of their name:> The shields themselves are called ancilia from their shape; for this is not> round, nor yet completely oval, like that of a standard shield, but has a> curving indentation, the arms of which are bent back and united with each> other at the top and bottom to make a ‘curved’, i.e. ankylos, shape.6The shape of the ankylos (Fig. 22.1) closely resembles that of the hippopede, ashape invented by Eudoxus of Cnidus in the fourth century BCE to explain theapparently irregular motion of the planets through a composition of uniformcircular motions. The hippopede of each planet has a typical 8-shaped drawing,created by the composition of spherical planes tracing its synodic and siderealperiods (Fig. 22.2). However, the “8-shaped drawing” also resembles the ancilia.A324790_1_En_22_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_22_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 22.1The ancilia that the Salii carried in their processions.

The 8-shaped drawing represents a line traced on a sphericalsurface from a point on the equator of a sphere that spins at a constant speed;the sphere, in turn, revolves at the same speed around a different axis and inthe opposite direction. (from Walker 1999)In actual fact, the Greek term ankylos calls to mind the other Greek termhippopede: the former refers to a “form of attachment” or, more specifically, “adog’s leash” or “laces for shoes”; the latter originally referred to “shackles”or “a foot-tie for horses at pasture”, and only took on its later astronomicalreference figuratively.Jupiter’s gift to Numa, the ancile that fell from the sky on 1 March, resemblesa prototype as-yet primitive tool for measuring multiples of the superiorplanets’ synodic and sidereal periods. Measurement of these multiples commencedwith the start of astronomical time, on 1 March in year one of the Numan cycle(see Chap. 1 [A324790_1_En_1_Chapter.html]), and—as far as Saturn and Jupiterare concerned—concluded on 1 March of the 60 and 84th years respectively.This confirms the entire cycle’s status as a framework-providing cycle (seeChap. 21 [A324790_1_En_21_Chapter.html]).Footnotes1Ovid, Fasti, 3.357-78: Mollis erat tellus rorata mane pruina: / ante sui populuslimina regis adest. / Prodit et in solio medius consedit acerno; / innumericirca stantque silentque viri. / Ortus erat summo tantummodo margine Phoebus: /sollicitae mentesque speque metuque pavent. / Constitit atque caput niveovelatus amictu / iam bene dis notas sustulit ille manus / atque ita: ‘Tempusadest promissi muneris’, inquit; / ‘pollicitam dictis, Iuppiter, adde fidem.’ /Dum loquitur, totum iam sol emoverat orbem / et gravis aetherio venit ab axefragor. / Ter tonuit sine nube deus, tria fulmina misit. / Credite dicenti: mirased acta loquor. / A media caelum regione dehiscere coepit. / Summisere oculoscum duce turba suo. / Ecce levi scutum versatum leniter aura / decidit: a populoclamor ad astra venit. / Tollit humo munus caesa prius ille iuvenca, / quaedederat nulli colla premenda iugo, / idque ancile vocat, quod ab omni parterecisum est / quaque notes oculis, angulus omnis abest. 2Manilius, Astronomica, 2.789: cardines.

THE HEAVENS OF THE FIXED STARS AND THEIR CUSTODIAN, IANUSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are the three superior planets visible to the nakedeye, and man has known of them since the most ancient of times. Their siderealperiods lengthen the further they lie from Earth, from a little less than2 years for Mars to almost 12 years for Jupiter and a touch under 30 years forSaturn. To the naked eye, the only thing beyond these planets is the sphere offixed stars.Mars, the closest of all, also has the most irregular motion: it is eitherimpulsive and impetuous or slow, stationary or even retrograde. Little wonderthat Mars was chosen as the heavenly representative of the god of war at leastas far back as Babylon, when it symbolized the God Nergal. Jupiter is by far themost constant and balanced of the three planets, making it an ideal symbol forthe most excellent and highest god whose calm wisdom guides and protects kingsand populations alike. As for Saturn, with its exasperatingly slow pace and30-year revolution, not far off the human lifespan in ancient times—or if youprefer, a “generation” in the ancient system for measuring long periods oftime—it is better suited to the role of a being whose long scythe harvests thefruits of a lifetime’s of work.As is generally known, the farthest-flung gods—gods grafted onto earlierincarnations from the East, represented in the heavens by these relaxed andsolemn planets—are united and split by family relations and conflictualrelationships, including over Rome. First, Saturn fled to Rome to escapeJupiter; there he was greeted by Janus, who gave him the Capitol and thenwithdrew to the Janiculum; subsequently, Jupiter arrived, claimed the Capitoland confined Saturn to the foot of the hill (see again Fig. 16. 1[A324790_1_En_16_Chapter.html]).It is highly likely, if not certain, that this myth echoes not just earlierMesopotamian notions of the heavens, but also traces of a preliminary sketch ofanother motif: that of the “great conjunction ”. The conjunction of the twolargest planets may occur every 20 years, but it takes 24 centuries for thegrand conjunction to travel the entire way around the Zodiac and repeat in thesame sign, in the same position, as it occurred all that time ago (seeFig. 23.1). If there is one astral configuration that connotes the passage oftime, and indeed the passage of entire epochs, this is a prime candidate.Clearly, the age of Saturn that preceded the age of Jupiter has always beenregarded as the one true golden age.A324790_1_En_23_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_23_Fig1_HTML.gif]Fig. 23.1The “great conjunction ” of Saturn and Jupiter—from Johannes Kepler, De StellaNova in Pede Serpentarii, 1604. This diagram shows the trigon formed from the“major conjunctions” of Jupiter and Saturn, which are repeated every 20 years;one angle of the trigon takes around 2,400 years to complete its journey aroundthe ZodiacThe bond between Saturn and Janus in Rome takes on a specific value when readagainst this hastily-sketched framework. Ovid tells us that a god like thetwo-faced deity was Roman alone, “for Greece hath no divinity like thee”.1Joannes Lydus grasps the meaning of this, when on Varro, he writes:> In the XIV book of the De Rerum Divinarum, Varro [writes] that Janus for the> Etruscans was known as Uranus, who looked over everything they did […] In his> book De Signis, Fronteius [writes] that Janus was believed to watch over all> time, and that his temple contained twelve altars, one for every month.2“Janus was known as Uranus”, and Uranus was the divinity associated with thehigh heavens, the heavens of the fixed stars. The bond between Janus andSaturn—a bond that the earliest Roman hagiography situated in the era before thecity was founded—reveals the tenor of the relationship that unites the heavensof the fixed stars and the planet whose orbit is closest to them.Ovid’s description of Janus is more of an illustration, as may be inferred fromhis writings on the God:> Two-headed Janus, opener of the softly gliding year,> thou who alone of the celestials dost behold thy back.> […] alone of all the heavenly ones> thou doest see both back and front.The poet continues, leaving the god speak:> ‘The guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone,> and none but me may rule the wheeling pole.> […] I sit at heaven’s gate with the gentle Hours;> my office regulates the goings and the comings of Jupiter himself.> […] I, the porter of the heavenly court, behold at once both East and West.> […] lest I should lose time by twisting my neck,> I am free to look both ways without budging.’3In this last quote, Ovid clearly contrasts the immobility of the skies where thestars reside—indeed, they are known as fixed stars—and the rest of the heavens,in which, as they gradually become lower and lower and closer and closer toEarth, the planets come and go, starting with Saturn. The planets make theirappearance in the east, move in direct motion, appear to stand still, retrocede,go into opposition with the Sun, appear to stand still once more, resume directmotion, and then exit stage west.All of these movements and phenomena are alien to Janus’s nature—Janus, “thouwho alone of the celestials”, “alone of all the heavenly ones”, “opener of thesoftly gliding year”—yet they are all movements and phenomena that the guardianof this vast world, “porter of the heavenly court”, must keep under observationwithout turning his head and without moving his body.He must, at one and the same time, be Patulcius and Clusius, “He who opens” and“He who closes”:> ‘[…] for on his sacrificial lips> I’m now Patulcius and now Clusius called.’4This is, of course, a pre-scientific explanation of a pre-scientific ZeroDegrees longitude. Whether it is the Greenwich Meridian (which measureslongitude on the earthly sphere) or is the Zero Degrees of Aries (which measureslongitude on the heavenly sphere), in all cases what we have is a point in spacefrom which things begin and end, “open” and “close”, and from where it ispossible to measure the size of an angle.Moreover, it is> the statue of the god, more often than not depicted holding the number 300 in> his right hand and the number 65 in his left, illustrating the length of the> year,5that gives the measurement in days of Janus’s domains.One key and final proof of the affinity between Janus and the vault of heaven isto be found in a comparison between an element of the Mesopotamian view of thecosmology and a myth dating back to the earliest times of Ancient Rome. The NearEastern element is best summed up in the biblical cosmology (see Fig. 23.2),according to which,A324790_1_En_23_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_23_Fig2_HTML.gif]Fig. 23.2The Mesopotamian cosmological vision in biblical interpretation: (1) water abovethe firmament; (2) deposits of snow; (3) deposits of hail; (4) halls of thewinds; (5) firmament; (6) locks; (7) pillars of heaven; (8) pillars of theEarth; (9) fountain of the abysses; (10) centre of the world; (11) waters belowthe earth; (12) rivers of the underworld. (from Jacobs 1978)> the earth rests on pillars (Job 9.6). Stretched above the earth is the sky,> the ‘heaven’ or the ‘firmament’, a solid substance (Genesis 1.6-8) also> resting on pillars (Job 26.11). The sun, moon and stars are positioned in, or> just beneath, the firmament (Genesis 1.14-7) and they move across it (Psalms> 19.1-7) […]> There are waters above the firmament (Genesis 1.6-7) as well as beneath it.> Some of the waters beneath the firmament were gathered together at the> beginning of creation to form the seas (Genesis 1.9-10), but, in addition,> these waters flow beneath the earth (Esodo 20.4; Deuteronomy 4.18; Psalms> 24.2) where they are connected to the waters of Tehom, the great deep (Genesis> 1.2). The Deluge was caused by a tremendous outpouring of the fountains of the> Tehom as well as by the opening of the windows of heaven (Genesis 7.11) […]> Rain is produced by the clouds (Genesis 9.11-7; Job 26.8; Eccl. 11.3). The> water in the clouds comes from the waters above the firmament so that when the> heaven is ‘shut up’ there is no rain (Deuteronomy 11.17), while when the ‘good> treasure’ of heaven is open the rain falls in abundance (Deuteronomy 28.12).6Macrobius also retells the Roman myth:> During the war against the Sabines, provoked by the rape of the virgins, the> Romans wanted to move quickly and close the gate at the foot of the Viminal> Hill – thereafter known as the Janual – because their enemies had launched> their assault there. As soon as they closed it, it opened again, all by> itself; the same thing happened a second and a third time. As it was> impossible to close the gate, a large number of armed guards were placed> beyond the threshold. While fierce fighting was going on elsewhere, a rumour> spread that our soldiers had been routed by Tatius. On hearing this news, the> Romans who were defending the gateway fled in panic.> However, just as the Sabines were about to pour through the open gate, it is> said that from Janus’s Temple rushing and unruly waters flowed out through the> gate, and many enemy troops perished, burned by the boiling surge or swallowed> by its eddying whirlpools. After this event, it was decreed that in times of> war the doors to the temple should remain open, as if the god had left to> defend the city. Such is the story of Janus.7This comparison confirms the identification of Janus with the divinityrepresenting the heavens of the fixed stars: the “unruly waters and eddyingwhirlpools” that overwhelmed the Sabines come from “above the firmament”, andthe unbarred doors to the paradisiacal Temple of Janus do not hold back therains that bring victory to “our boys”.8 In passing, we learn the reason behindthe mystery of the temple doors left open in times of war, and closed in timesof peace, in clear contravention of universally accepted military rules—amystery that has taxed minds (and not just Roman minds) for 3.000 years…Having in this manner identified the essence of Janus in the “Uranian” God ofthe heavens of the fixed stars, we find more supporters among ancientchroniclers, including—once again—Macrobius:> Janus was the first in Italy to raise temples to the Gods and establish rites> for worship […] Others wanted to see in him the world, that is to say the> heavens: and so Janus comes from ire [i.e. “to go”], because the world goes> always, travelling in a circle, starting from and returning to itself.9If we take a step backwards and return to the Oriental conception of the cosmos,we see a distinction between the “firmament”—that which separates the watersbelow from the waters above, which God calls the heavens and created on thesecond day—and the “lights” in the firmament of the heavens (distinguishing dayfrom night), which act as symbols for the seasons, the days and the years, aswell as illuminating the Earth: i.e. the Sun, the Moon and the stars, created byGod on the fourth day.The term “firmament” references a notion of “firmness, closure”10 and is used todefine the “wrapper” around the various heavens, from the outermost heaven ofthe fixed stars to the innermost heaven of the Moon, at the centre of which sitsthe unmoving Earth. In turn, the concept of “firmness” hails back to theSanskrit adjective dhruvah, meaning “firm, fixed, constant”, which, by a fact ofnature, gives its name to the Pole Star, the most fixed of all fixedstars—indeed, the one true fixed star which never moves, the Pivot Point of theHeavens.It is from the Pole Star above the heads of Northern hemisphere dwellers thatthe Axis of the World turns, and it is around this axis that the entire universerevolves. Though this axis connects with the opposite pole, we cannot see itbecause it runs below our feet. It runs through the Earth, passing through anUmbilicus which, evidently, sits right before the observer, and moves when theviewer moves. This explains, more generally, the infinite number of Umbilicithrough which an infinite number of Axes pass in this world of infinite placessacred to human beings and, more specifically, the contiguity of the UmbilicusUrbis with the temple of Janus Geminus in Rome.11So “universal” is this approach—no term could be more appropriate to defineit—that we find it in all ages among all peoples, though of course withvariations. Often, the Axis of the World is a tree whose roots tap into anUmbilicus of the World, serving as a pillar to hold up the celestial vault; inother cases, it is a mill that revolves around the axis12; in yet others—forexample, in India—Heavens and Earth “are compared to two wheels placed at eitherend of an axle.”13 In all cases there is a piece of wood, sometimes even alittle wooden rod—a cork on the world’s belly button, or a wooden pintlefastening the wheel to the mill or the two wheels to the axis—which does notmove, does not rotate, is fixed, and whose mere presence ensures eternal motionfor the mill, wheels, heavenly bodies and universe.14 The Sanskrit term anihwould appear to resemble the Etruscan name for Janus, Ani.In Classic Greece, under the Pythagorean tradition, whose roots are sunk intothe Near East, this vision of the Cosmos takes on a different and highlyparticular cant. The Pythagorean Philolaus of Croton, and later on Platohimself, mention a “hull”, something that “holds together the entire revolvingfirmament, much like the bindings round a warship’s keel.”15The two-way facing god’s dual heads and the “hull”, the “ship’s keel”, appear onthe two sides of the oldest known Roman coin: the former, on the front, recallsthat “lest he should lose time by twisting his neck, he is free to look bothways without budging” his head; the latter, on the reverse, symbolizes hisfunction as the immobile “binding” of the universe (see Fig. 23.3).A324790_1_En_23_Fig3_HTML.jpg [A324790_1_En_23_Fig3_HTML.jpg]Fig. 23.3The oldest known Roman coin, fourth century BCE.

See also Jacobs1978, pp. 55–57. 7Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.9.17-8: Cum bello sabino, quod virginum raptarum gratiacommissum est, Romani portam quae sub radicibus collis Viminalis erat, quaepostea ex eventu Ianualis vocata est, claudere festinarent, quia in ipsam hostesruebant, post quam est causa, mox sponte patefacta est; cumque iterum ac tertioidem contigisset, armati plurimi pro limine, quia claudere nequibant, custodessteterunt, cumque ex alia parte acerrimo proelio certaretur, subito famapertulit fusos a Tatio nostros.

Ea re placitum ut belli tempore, velut ad urbis auxiliumprofecto deo, fores reserarentur. Haec de Iano.The myth is also recounted, among others, by Ovid, Fasti, 1.255-82 andMetamorphoses, 14.772-804. 8Physically, the springs from whose waters the Sabines were routed are theLautulae, so called—as Varro, de lingua latina, 5.156, explains—“from lavare,“to wash”, because there [a little to the east of the Comitium; author’s note]near the Double Janus there once were hot springs, ab lavando, quod ibi ad IanumGeminum aquae caldae fuerunt.” The temple of Ianus Geminus (see again Fig. 16. 1[A324790_1_En_16_Chapter.html]) should be located midway between the niger lapisand the temple of Cloacina.Etrusco-Roman tradition also mirrors Mesopotamian cosmology in othercorrespondences between the God and spring waters bubbling up from underground.One such link is the lucus Furrinae, the “sacred wood of Furrinae”, the nymph ofsprings and divinity of the waters that emerge half way up the Janiculum, thehill named after the god; see Dumézil 1975, pp. 32–37. 9Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.9.3 and 11: […] Ianum in Italia primum dis templaferisse et ritus istituisse sacrorum […] Alii mundum, id est caelum, essevoluerunt, Ianumque ab eundo dictum, quod mundus sempre eat, dum in orbemvolvitur et ex se initium facies in se refertur. Arnobius (adversus nationes,3.29.3), though disputing it, restates the opinion that Janus is the world, theyear or the Sun. 10Note the Latin expression firma ianua, “closed door”, and the French verbfermer, “to close”. 11See Coarelli 1983, p. 199 and ff., which suggests identifying the Umbilicus withthe Mundus; see again Fig. 16. 1 [A324790_1_En_16_Chapter.html]. 12On the Axis of the World, see de Santillana-von Dechend 1983, passim. 13Gombrich 1978, p. 93. 14In Sanskrit, this diminutive but essential little wooden item has a name, anih,designating “the pintle inserted into an axle on the outside of a wheel toprevent it from slipping off”. Hymn 1.35 in the Rig Veda, stanza 6, runs thus:“The immortal things rest upon this (scil.: the heavens of Yama, which is the“house of the heroes”), like a cart wheel on its pintle (anih).” 15For Philolaus, who uses the terms olkas, “hull of a cargo ship”, see IPresocratici (edited by Lami 1991), A15 (Aetius 2.6.5) pp. 476–477 and B12(Theon), pp. 496–497; for Plato, Republic, 10.621d.

FROM THE ROBIGALIA ON APRIL 25 TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE SUN IN ARIES FOR THEFESTIVITY OF ANNA PERENNA ON MARCH 15Leonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]During the course of the so-called “Calendar of agricultural tasks”, Pliny talksat length about the relationship between the days of the year, the rising orsetting of the constellations, and the tasks to be carried out in the fields.One of these is particularly interesting, because it refers to the Numancalendar in force prior to Julius Caesar’s reforms, and indicates the Sun’sposition in the Zodiac on a given day under that particular calendar:> The Robigalia were instituted by Numa in the 11th year of his reign [705 BCE],> and they are now celebrated on the 7th day before the Calends of May [25> April], as it is more or less in this period that blight afflicts the harvest.> Varro set this date based on the position of the Sun in the 10th degree of> Taurus, according to calculations used in those times.1Under the Numan calendar, April lasts 29 rather than 30 days (as it does in theJulian calendar), and 25 April is the 6th rather than the 7th day before theCalends of May. So, there can be no doubt that the counter position of the nuncof the celebration and the tunc of the calculation period refers to the “now” ofwhen Pliny was writing, subsequent to the Julian reform, and the “then”, i.e.“in those times”, when Varro made his calculations, prior to the reform.What is more open to question is the Sun’s position on 25 April in year elevenin the reign of Numa, which is traditionally held to be 705 BCE. Unfortunately,this identification is hypothetical, and there remains no way for us toassociate the day, month and year of ancient Roman chronology with the day,month and year of our current chronology.However, one thing we do know is that around 48 BCE—the year in which Varrowrote one of his many lost works, the Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum—on 25 Aprilthe Sun was at 10° in Taurus. With this information, it is not hard to calculatethe Sun’s entry into the sign of Aries. We may choose between the following twomethods: * Attribute constant motion to the Sun over the entire year, equivalent to 0.9856° per day;2 * Attribute an accelerated motion to the Sun—equivalent to 1.0159° per day—from 13° in Virgo to 27° in Pisces, and a slower motion—equivalent to 0.9524° per day—from 27° in Pisces to 13° in Virgo, in accordance with the convention in use in Babylon.3Over such a short arc of a circle—the 40° from Degree Zero of Aries to 10° inTaurus—the two methods yield just a single day’s difference, between 41 dayscalculated using the first method4 and 42 days using the second.5 Far morestriking is that the second method yields a round result to the third decimalplace and, more important still, the 42nd day before 25 April is 15 March, thefeast day of Anna Perenna (see Chap. 14 [A324790_1_En_14_Chapter.html]).Ultimately Pliny tells us that on 25 April the Sun is at 10° in Taurus; acalculation using the Babylonian method indicates that on 15 March, the feast ofAnna Perenna, the Sun is at 1° in Aries.Among Ovid’s many tales and writings on the Goddess, we find a match withThemis—“Others deem that she is Themis”6—wife to Zeus and mother of the Horaeand Moirae. The Horae personified the seasons, while the Moirae mapped out theportion of the Zodiac that allocates to each man, according to the time andplace of their conception and/or birth, the fate written for them in the starsand dictated by the divine will that Themis herself represents.The pseudo-etymology of the Goddess’s name advanced by Ovid takes on a newmeaning:> In a perennial river I hide, and Anna Perenna is my name.7The eternal flow of the stars across the heavens recalls the continuous flow ofthe brook where one of the goddess’s personifications found shelter; at the sametime, the circle of the Zodiac continues to open and close at the very samepoint, Degree Zero in Aries.Modern scholars who consider the 15 March celebration “in all likelihood to bethe start of an extremely ancient year”,8 would appear to be on the right track.Macrobius certainly agrees:> That same month [i.e. March] people make a sacrifice in public and in private> to Anna Perenna, so that the coming year and future years will flow pleasantly> by.9Only the truly ancient year that starts on 15 March, the feast of Anna Perenna,qualifies as a “Zodiacal New Year”, with the Sun entering Aries.Footnotes1Pliny, Naturalis Historia, 18.285: Robigalia Numa constituit anno regni sui XI,quae nunc aguntur a. d.

The less accelerated motion, corresponding to 28.125°(= 15/16 × 30°) per lunation, yields 0.9524° (= 28.125° ÷ 29.5306) per day.

FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE SUN IN ARIES TO ITS ENTRANCE IN PISCES FOR THETERMINALIA ON FEBRUARY 23, TOGETHER WITH THE VESPERTINE RISE OF ARCTURUSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]If we now repeat the twin process, starting from the Sun’s entrance into Arieson 15 March, to calculate the day on which the Sun has travelled 330° and isentering into the sign of Pisces, we obtain two new results which are very closetogether. This is perhaps not surprising, as the distance between the startpoint and arrival is 330° in an anticlockwise direction; clockwise, thedifference is just 30°. The first method gives us 335 days,1 and the second336.2 Once again, the most exciting result is the second one: 336 days after theAnna Perenna celebration of 15 March comes Terminalia on 23 February.The Sun’s entrance into the sign of Pisces for the Terminalia on February 23 issignificant for a number of reasons. Pliny, for one, writes that;> Variable weather is expected with the appearance of swallows the 8th day> before the Calends of March [22 February], and the day after at the vespertine> rise of Arcturus.3The arrival of the swallows is confirmed by Ovid, who on 24 February writes:> Do I err? or has the swallow come, the harbinger of spring,> and does she not fear lest winter should turn and come again?4This is the day when the God Terminus is celebrated, as Ovid explains:> What happened when the new Capitol was being built? Why, the whole company> of gods withdrew before Jupiter and made room for him;> but Terminus, as the ancients relate, remained where he was found> in the shrine, and shares the temple with great Jupiter.> Even to this day there is a small hole in the roof of the temple,> that he may see naught above him but the stars.5So, there is somebody who observes the stars in Rome, and who is keen tocontinue observing them. This was prior to 583 BCE, the year when the firstEtruscan king, Tarquinius Priscus (616–579 BCE), began construction of the newtemple dedicated to the Capitoline triad Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.6 The starsthey wished to observe—perhaps the vespertine rising of Arcturus that Plinymentioned?—and whether they wanted to observe them solely on 23 February issomething we have yet to establish (see Chap. 27[A324790_1_En_27_Chapter.html]).What we do know is that in Rome, between the eighth and sixth centuries BCE: * Firstly, Arcturus (Fig. 25.1), the brightest star in the northern hemisphere, rises with the azimuth close to 45° (Fig. 25.2), in the North-East,7 and sets with the azimuth close to 315°, in the North-West; A324790_1_En_25_Fig1_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_25_Fig1_HTML.gif] Fig. 25.1 Arcturus, the “guardian of the (Great) Bear”, and Ursa Major—from Andrea Cellarius, Atlas Coelestis seu Harmonia Macrocosmica, 1660 A324790_1_En_25_Fig2_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_25_Fig2_HTML.gif] Fig. 25.2 The disciplina etrusca, the division of heavenly space, the vespertine rising of Arcturus on 23 February and the morning rise on 13 September. The circle of the horizon is divided into 16 segments, which are counted clockwise from the north. In Rome, the temple of Jupiter Capitoline opened in the direction that is the boundary for the seventh and eighth segments; around the eighth century BCE, the vespertine rising of Arcturus was in the direction that separated the second and third segments and the morning rising was in the direction that separated the 14 and 15th segments. (from Les Etrusques 1992; revised by the author) * and secondly, the temple of Jupiter Capitoline is oriented with the azimuth at 157° (Fig. 25.3), facing South-SouthWest.8 A324790_1_En_25_Fig3_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_25_Fig3_HTML.gif] Fig. 25.3 The temple of Jupiter Capitoline: plan and hypothetical elevation. (from Cifani 2008)It follows that these three alignments—the rising and setting of the celestialbody and the Capitoline Temple—respect the division of the circle of the horizoninto sixteen parts under the so-called Disciplina etrusca:9 the heavenly bodyrises in the direction that separates the second and third portion and sets inthe direction that separates the 14 and 15th portion, while the temple isoriented in the direction separating the seventh and eighth portion (see againFig. 25.2).And that’s not all: we just saw that vespertine rise of Arcturus occurs for theTerminalia on February 23 when the Sun enter into the sign of Pisces. Now wecould add that the morning rise of the same Arcturus occurs for the Epulum IoviIunoni Minervae, on 13 September (see Chap. 3 [A324790_1_En_3_Chapter.html]),when the Sun enters the sign of Libra.10The relationship between the celestial body, which undertakes its evening risingon 23 February and its morning rise on 13 September, and the Capitoline temple,which remains the residence of the old God Terminus celebrated at the Terminaliaand becomes the residence of the new God Iovis celebrated with the Epulum,predates by a few centuries Ptolemy’s assertion that> the luminous and reddish star known as Arcturus is akin to Mars and Jupiter.11Pisces, the sign that the Sun enters for the Terminalia on February 23, just asthe swallows arrive in Rome, once again has a link to Babylon. The southwesternbranch of the double constellation of Pisces, along with stars ε ζ θ fromPegasus, were known as sim.mah, or “big swallow” (Fig. 25.4), while thenorthwestern branch, along with a portion of the stars that make up Andromeda,were known as A-nu-ni-tum. Another, later, name for the constellation of Pisces,Zib, seems to connote the border for the series of twelve signs as “Boundary”,12a definition close to Latin Terminus.A324790_1_En_25_Fig4_HTML.gif [A324790_1_En_25_Fig4_HTML.gif]Fig. 25.4The constellation of the “great swallow” in Mesopotamian astronomy. InBabylonia, the Southwestern branch of our constellation Pisces, together withthe stars ε ζ θ from Pegasus, was known as sim.mah, the “great swallow”, for itsresemblance to a swallow; the Northwestern branch, plus a portion of Andromeda’sstars, was known as A-nu-ni-tum.

The morning rise is the moment of the year when the star begins to bevisible to the East soon before the Sun rise in the East.Hesiod too comments on the arrival of swallows at this time of yearcontemporaneous to the evening rise of Arcturus; see Chap. 26[A324790_1_En_26_Chapter.html]. 4Ovid, Fasti, 2.853–4: Fallimur, an veris praenuntia venit hirundo / et metuit nequa versa recurrat hiems? 5Ovid, Fasti, 2.667–72: Quid, nova cum fierent Capitolia?

See also Pliny, Naturalis Historia, 18.310: “Theday before the Ides of September [12 September] half of Arcturus rises […],Arcturus vero medius prid.

THE VESPERTINE RISING OF ARCTURUS FOR THE TERMINALIA ON FEBRUARY 23 AND THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROMULEAN AND NUMAN CALENDARSLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]The God Terminus’s unwillingness to vacate the position he had been allocated ina forgotten age, and the “small hole” opened in the ceiling of the newCapitoline temple so “that he may see naught above him but the stars”, hark backto the earliest observations of celestial bodies in Rome. The vespertine risingof Arcturus for the Terminalia on February 23 allows us to identify a linkbetween the Numan calendar and its predecessor, which is traditionally ascribedto the city’s founder and first king, Romulus (753–716 BCE)The Romulean year is described thus by Macrobius:> There was a time when the Romans, thanks to Romulus, had their own 10 month> year, beginning in March and lasting 304 days: 6 months—i.e. April, June,> August, September, November and December—were 30 days long; 4 months—i.e.> March, May, July and October—were 31 days long.1From an astronomical standpoint, a 304 day year makes no sense at all: it isneither solar nor lunar, and it doesn’t even last a whole number of lunations.Then there’s the fact that 31 day months are not compliant with lunations, whichlast around 29.5 days; it would make far more sense for 30 day monthsalternating with 29 or 31 day months with 28 day months. In consequence, it isgenerally believed that the Romulean year was not astronomically-based.And yet in another comment from Macrobius—one more important yet neglectedcomment, much like the rest of his writings on the Numan cycle (see Chap. 4[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html])—we discover that a link does indeed exist betweenmonth and season in the Romulean year:> Given that this number [304 days: author’s note] agrees neither with the> motion of the Sun nor with the rhythm of the Moon, at times it occurred that> the cold part of the year took place in the summer months or, vice versa, the> hot part of the year in the winter months.> When this happened, a number of days as large as those necessary to return the> season of the year to the particular climate of that month was allowed to be> lost, without any monthly name.2This comment leaves absolutely no room for doubt: every month in the Romuleancalendar is associated with “the particular climate of that month”, i.e. theappropriate type of weather, which means that the Romulean year is indeed boundup with the motion of the Sun.In consequence, no 304 day year can be followed by a new 304 day year without abreak—as is the case today in parts of the world where a purely lunar calendaris still in use. This is because without such a break, every month would slideback through the entire solar year, and could not therefore be associated with aspecific “climate” or season: a year One lasting 10 months from March toDecember would be followed by a year Two in which March starts when January hadstarted the previous year; in year Three, March would be where November had beentwo years previously, and so on. The obvious consequence is that it would havebeen impossible to associate a season with any given month in any stable form.The final quote from Macrobius shows that the Romulean calendar covers 304 daysof the solar year, divided up into 10 numbered months, which left 61 days“without any monthly name.”Something similar applied to a different civilization and tradition at the sametime as the first Roman kings. In Works and Days, Hesiod writes:> When Zeus [i.e. the Sun] has finished sixty> wintry days after the solstice, then the star> Arcturus leaves the holy stream of Ocean,> and first rises brilliant at dusk;> after him the shrilly wailing daughter of Pandion, the swallow,> appears to men when spring is just beginning.3The same occurs in Rome with the Numan calendar, in which the winter solsticefalls on 21 December. As may be deduced from a reading of Varro’s words on thetopic:> The time from the bruma until the Sun returns to the bruma, is called a year;and of Ovid’s:> Midwinter is the beginning of the new Sun and the end of the old one;> Phoebus [i.e. the Sun] and the year take their start from the same point;and the Praenestine Calendar regarding the feast of Divalia, on 21 December:> There are those who believe that the ceremony for this day is to celebrate the> New year; it is evident, indeed, that [this day] is the start of the New> year.4In the Numan calendar, starting from the 21 December solstice, the Sun “finishessixty wintry days” on 22 February,5 the day that the swallows appear; the dayafter, Arcturus performs its vespertine rising. This is exactly as Plinyrecounts it (see Chap. 25 [A324790_1_En_25_Chapter.html]), and how Hesiodchronicled events too.6 So, the period of time separating these two significantastronomical phenomena—the winter solstice and Arcturus’s vespertinerising—corresponds fairly well to the 61 days missing from the Romuleancalendar, “without any monthly name”. The remaining 304 days, broken down into10 numbered months, cover the rest of the year, from Arcturus’s vespertinerising to the winter solstice .It is here that the two calendars begin to display their fundamentaldifferences, regardless of their chronological link and similar heritage.7 Theolder of these years—the Romulean year—requires a re-anchoring every yearthrough the observation of two significant astronomical phenomena if it is tocomply with the movement of celestial bodies; however, Macrobius notes that thisalone was not necessarily sufficient. The more modern of the two years—the Numanyear—is far more similar to our own year, requiring solely the addition ofintercalary days as prescribed by the rules in order to remain in sync with themotion of the Sun, Moon and planets (see Chap. 21[A324790_1_En_21_Chapter.html]) over a long cycle of years (see Chap. 4[A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]).The vespertine rising of Arcturus, as the Sun moves into the sign of Pisces forthe feast of Terminalia, marks the end of the Ancient Roman liturgical year.Terminus’s inflexible and steadfast resolve not to cede his place even toJupiter Optimus Maximus not only marks—in all likelihood—the point where the twocalendars (Romulean and Numan) coincide, it shows the inalterable nature of therelationship between rite and the observation of celestial bodies. Ovid confirmsthis in his statement:> From that time, Terminus, thou hast not been free to flit:> abide in that station in which thou hast been placed.8His is, however, a deceptive lack of motion that the slow, imperceptible andinexorable precession of the equinoxes undermines, year after year and centuryafter century, as it alters the time and azimuth of the vespertine rising of allheavenly bodies, Arcturus in particular. With the passage of time, it is nolonger possible to observe the first appearance of the celestial body in theEast soon after sunset on 23 February from the “small hole” on the Capitolinetemple roof (see again Fig. 25. 3 [A324790_1_En_25_Chapter.html]) above thealtar to Terminus.And yet, as Augustine noted almost a thousand years later,9 Terminus wouldmaintain his privilege of representing the “end of ephemeral things”, whileJanus represents the “beginning”. The two gods remain united: Terminus isassociated with a specific point in the heavenly vault, and a specific time ofyear; Janus is associated with the entire heavenly vault and its slow, ceaselessrevolution for all time.Footnotes1Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.12.3: Romanos quoque olim auctore Romulo annum suumdecem habuisse mensibus ordinatum: qui annus incipiebat a Martio etconficiebatur diebus trecentis quattuor, ut sex quidam menses, id est AprilisIunius Sextilis September November December, tricenum essent dierum, quattuorvero, Martius Maius Quintilis October, tricenis et singulis expedirentur.See also Censorinus, de die natali, 20.3. 2Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.12.39: Sed cum is numerus neque solis cursui nequelunae rationibus conveniret, non nunquam usu veniebat ut frigus anni aestivismensibus et contra calor hiemalibus proveniret; quod ubi contigisset, tantumdierum sine ullo mensis nomine patiebantur absumi quantum ad id anni tempusadduceret quo caeli habitus instanti mensi aptus inveniretur. 3Hesiod, Works and Days, 564–9: ευτ’ αν δ’ εξηκοντα μετα τροπας ηελιοιο /χειμερι’ εκτελεσει Ζευς ηματα, δη ρα τοτ αστηρ / Αρκτουρος προλιπων ιερον ροονΩκεανοιο / πρωτον παμϕαινων επιτελλεται ακροκνεϕαιος: / τον δε μετ ορθρογοηΠανδιονις ωρτο χελιδων / εσ ϕαος ανθρωποις, εαρος νεον ισταμενοιο. Pandion, Kingof Attica, had his daughter turned into a swallow. 4Varro, de lingua latina, 6.8: tempus a bruma ad brumam dum sol redit, vocaturannus. Bruma is the “very short day”, the shortest of the year; Varro also talksof dies brumales, the “shortest days”, because of the difficulty in working outwhich one of them is the actual solstice.Ovid, Fasti, 1.163–4: Bruma novi prima est veterisque novissima solis; /principium capiunt Phoebus et annus idem.The Praenestine Calendar reads thus: S]UNT TAMEN, [QUI FIERI ID SACRU]M AIUNT OBAN[NUM NOVUM; MANI]FESTUM ESSE [ENIM PRINCIPIU]M [A]NNI NOV[I]. Mommsen’s ratherfreighted addition on the basis of chronicles by Varro, Pliny (following on fromVerrius Flaccus) and Macrobius, is universally accepted; indeed, as Warde Fowler1908, p. 275, noted, “the Praenestine fragments clearly suggests the word‘annus’.” 59 days of December + 29 days of January + 22 days of February = 60 days. 6Even using modern-day calculations, at the time of Rome’s first kings, 60 dayselapsed between the winter solstice and the evening rising of Arcturus. Forexample, the day of the winter solstice—when the Sun sets at 4:46 p.m. withazimuth 238°.54—corresponds to our 22 December 754 BCE; the day of Arcturus’svespertine rising—at 6:34 p.m., 49 min after sunset—corresponds to our 20February 753 BCE (see Chap. 25 [A324790_1_En_25_Chapter.html], no. 10). All datahas been sourced from the Cosmos Programme. 7According to tradition handed down among others by Censorinus, de die natali,20.4, the Romulean year was almost immediately amended by Romulus’s successor,Numa Pompilius: “Afterwards, either by Numa […] there was instituted a year of12 months and 355 days, Postea sive a Numa […] XII facti sunt menses et diesCCCLV.” 8Ovid, Fasti, 2.673–4: Termine, post illud levitas tibi libera non est: / quapositus fueris in statione, mane. “Post illud, from that time”, regarding thegod’s refusal to move to make way for construction of the new temple. 9Augustine, de Civitate Dei, 7.7: […] ad eum (scil.

REFORM OF THE ROMULEAN YEAR AND THE TRANSITION TO THE NUMAN YEARLeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]We began by stating that the Numan calendar is “the oldest Western calendar witha clear link to astronomy” (see Chap. 2 [A324790_1_En_2_Chapter.html]). Now, onthe contrary, we are obliged to acknowledge that the Romulean calendar also hadlinks to astronomy.The difference lies in the type of link: * The Romulean calendar is based on the observation of two astronomical phenomena (the winter solstice and the vespertine rise of Arcturus)1; * The Numan calendar is based on knowledge regarding the different lengths of lunations and of the solar year, in addition to the motions of the other heavenly bodies.In other words, the Romulean calendar is still a “primitive” calendar, even ifthe winter solstice and the rising of the brightest star in the northernhemisphere are astronomical “phenomena” of primary importance.2 The Numancalendar, on the other hand, is not just a “modern” calendar, it is the directprogenitor of our modern-day calendar: the Gregorian calendar was begat by theJulian calendar, and the Julian calendar was begat by the Numan calendar.In my opinion, this sudden and brusque transition from a “primitive” to a“modern” calendar is the biggest and most telling clue that the Etruscans hailfrom the Orient, and that they brought their cultural baggage to the people ofLazio who were soon to found the Eternal City. This topic, however, fallsoutside the scope of our research here, and requires an approach thatspecifically examines the origins of the Etruscan civilization and thefoundation of Rome.3The Numan calendar—as we have seen ad abundantiam—employs a system ofintercalation based on a large quantity of refined knowledge about heavenlybodies. For this calendar, direct and “practical” ongoing observation isrequired solely to verify what we may call the abstract or “theoretical” resultsreached through well-known and well-codified calculations.At this point, it becomes important to attempt to establish how Numa’s “reform”made it possible to move from one calendar to the other. We will begin withCensorinus and Macrobius’ writings,4 which state that the Romulean year lasted304 days; it began on 1 March and ended on 30 December, which was the last dayof the year.It is worth recalling the quotes from Varro, Ovid and the Praenestine Calendarthat we saw in Chap. 26 [A324790_1_En_26_Chapter.html]. Varro writes:> The time from the bruma until the Sun returns to the bruma, is called a year;Ovid writes:> Midwinter is the beginning of the new Sun and the end of the old one;> Phoebus [i.e. the Sun] and the year take their start from the same point;and the Praenestine Calendar on 21 December writes:> there are those who believe that the ceremony for this day is to celebrate the> New Year; it is evident, indeed, that [this day] is the start of the New Year.The only legitimate conclusion we may draw from these writings is that thewinter solstice marked the end of the year—and therefore fell on 30 December—inthe Romulean calendar. It may be objected that in actual fact, neither Varro norOvid specify exactly which “year” they are referring to. However, we may becertain about one thing: it is not the Numan year, in which the winter solsticeoccurs on 21 December. Once we have ruled out the Numan year, the only otheryear it could be in Rome is the old Romulean year.Plutarch would appear to provide the casting vote for this thesis:> But consider whether Numa may not have adopted as the beginning of the year> that which conforms to our conception of the natural beginning.> Speaking generally, to be sure, there is not naturally either a last or a> first in a cycle; and it is by custom that some adopt one beginning of this> period and others another.> They do best, however, who adopt the beginning after the winter solstice ,> when the sun has ceased to advance, and turns about and retraces his course> toward us.5It could be posited that Plutarch is not talking about the end of the old yearand the beginning of the new, but about the changes Numa made to the order ofthe months, whereby January and February preceded Romulus’s first month (March).This objection, however, does not hold water, as a number of writingsdemonstrate that this order was not Numa’s doing, but came into effect at alater date. In Numa’s time, January and February followed December, and Februarywas the last month of the year, as Varro testifies (see Chap. 7[A324790_1_En_7_Chapter.html]).This leaves us with only one likelihood: Plutarch is providing us with thatproof that we were looking for all along, namely, that Numa established thebeginning of the year “after the winter solstice ”.Let’s look a little more closely at this. Let’s imagine that Romulus chose thewinter solstice as the last day of his year (30 December), and that Numa in hiscalendar reform, brought it forward to 21 December (under the Numan year).To recap, according to tradition (see Chap. 2 [A324790_1_En_2_Chapter.html]),Numa’s reform consisted of the following: * To begin with, Numa added 51 days to the 304 days of the Romulean year and obtained a 355 day lunar year; * He then removed 1 day from the six 30 day months, recouping 6 days; * He added these 6 days to the 51 already added to the Romulean year, giving 6 + 51 = 57 days; * Lastly, he split these 57 days into two new months, to create a 29 day January and a 28 day February.Following this series of changes, the 304 day year divided into 10 months, plusthe 60 days “without any monthly name”, roughly made up a 355 day year, whichwas augmented by an average of 10.25 intercalated days. The Romulean calendarbecame the Numan calendar, and the Numan year applied intercalation on a 24 yearcycle as we saw earlier (see Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]).Table 27.1 summarizes the changes between the Romulean and the Numan yearsaccording to this thesis:Table 27.1Correspondences between the Romulean and Numan yearsRomulean yearNuman yearIntervalNo. of daysIntervalNo. of daysFrom 1 to 14 March14* * ** * *15 March >>>>>>>>>>>>> 1 March—Kalendae MartiFrom 15 March to 30 December290From 1 March to 21 December29030 December >>> winter solstice >>> 21 December—DivaliaDays without a monthly name60Last 9 days of December + 29 days of January + 22 days of February60Vespertine rising of Arcturus >>> 23 February—Terminalia* * ** * *Last 5 days of February + 10,25 intercalary days15,25Total days14 + 290 + 60 = 364* * *290 + 60 + 15,25 = 365,25 * In the Romulean year, the interval between 15 March and 30 December lasts 290 days; in the Numan year, the interval between 1 March and 21 December lasts 290 days6; * The Romulean year has 60 days (without a monthly name) between the winter solstice and the vespertine rising of Arcturus. As we saw in Chap. 26 [A324790_1_En_26_Chapter.html], the same number of days in the Numan year run from 21 December to 22 February, the day that the swallows appear, and, the day after, Arcturus performs its vespertine rising; these 60 days consist of the last 9 days of December, the 29 days of January and the first 22 days of February; * In the Romulean year, the first 14 days of March, added to the following 290 days, make up the 304 days of the 10 month year. In the Numan year, the last 5 days of February, plus the added 10.25 average intercalated days (see Chap. 4 [A324790_1_En_4_Chapter.html]), make a total of 15.25 days.All in all, the Romulean year lasted 364 fixed days, while the Numan year, onaverage, lasted 365.25 days.Table 27.1 also shows correspondences between specific days in both of theseyears: * The winter solstice fell on 30 December in the Romulean year and on 21 December in the Numan year; * The last of the 60 days “without a monthly name” corresponds to the vespertine rising of Arcturus in the Romulean year, and to 23 February in the Numan year; * 15 March in the Romulean year corresponds to 1 March in the Numan year.Footnotes1The winter solstice may be observed both in the East when the Sun rises, and inthe West when it sets; the morning rise of Arcturus is observed by lookingsolely East for the star that rises just before the Sun. But the vespertine riseof Arcturus may be seen only by looking both West, as the sun sets, and East,where the star rises: the “small hole” Ovid mentions (see Chap. 25[A324790_1_En_25_Chapter.html]) must be on the highest point of the JupiterCapitoline temple roof (Fig. 25. 3 [A324790_1_En_25_Chapter.html]). 2In its etymological sense, the Greek noun phainomenon, “that which appears, thatwhich may be observed”, in astronomy is more extensively interpreted as “thatwhich may be observed and studied through direct observation.” 3See Magini 2011. 4Censorinus, de die natali, 20.2-4 recalls that the ten-month long Romulean yearwas “like the year of the Albans, from which the Roman year was descended, uttunc Albanis erat, unde orti Romani”. And Festus (150), representing VerriusFlaccus, says: “The month of March marked the start of the year in Latium, anddid so after the foundation of Rome, Martius mensis initium fuit anni et inLatio et post Romam conditam.” See Warde-Fowler 1908, p. 5, no. 1.As we saw, Censorinus goes on to explain: “These 10 months lasted 304 days,distributed thusly: March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, Quintile [i.e. July]31, Sextile [i.e. August] and September 30 each, October 31, and November andDecember 30. The four longer months were known as whole months; the other6 months were known as incomplete months. Afterwards, Numa […] created 12 monthsand 355 days […], Hi decem menses dies CCCIIII hoc modo habebant: Martius XXXI,Aprilis XXX, Maius XXXI, Iunius XXX, Quintilis XXXI, Sextilis et Septembertricenos, October XXXI, November et December XXX; quorum quattuor maiores pleni,ceteri sex cavi vocabantur. Postea sive a Numa […] XII facti sunt menses et diesCCCLV […]”Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.3 writes: “But Numa, his successor […] added […], Sedsecutus Numa […] addidit […]” before continuing as Censorinus does. 5Plutarch, Romanae Quaestiones, 19: Ορα δε μη μαλλον ο Νομας τη ϕυσει προσηκουσαναρχην ελαβε του ετους ως προς ημας. καθολου μεν γαρ ουδεν εστι ϕυσει των ενκυκλω περιϕερομενων ουτ εσατον ουτε πρωτον, νομω δ αλλην αλλοι του ρονουλαμβανουσιν αρην. αριστα δ οι την μετα τροπας χειμερινας λαμβανοντες, οπηνικατου προσω βαδιζειν πεπαυμενος ο ηλιος επιστρεϕει και ανακαμπτει παλιν προς ημας. 6In the Romulean year: 17 days in March + 273 days in April, May, June, July,August, September, October, November and December = 290 days.

(INEVITABLE) CONCLUSION: PER ASPERA AD ASTRALeonardo Magini1 (1)Societa’ Italiana Di Archeoastronomia, Fiumicino, Italy Leonardo MaginiEmail: l.magini@yahoo.it [l.magini@yahoo.it]Among the many thousands of astronomical documents held in the royal librariesof Mesopotamia, the so-called Astrolabes—veritable lists of the northern,equatorial and southern constellations, or “three constellations for every monthof the year”, as the tablet inscriptions state—held a very special position. TheAstrolabes list “relative positions, rising and setting times, the value foragriculture and mythical meanings” for each of 36 stars.The astrolabe traditionally known as Astrolabe B, drawn up in Assur during thereign of Tiglath-Pileser (around 1,100 BCE) is closely linked to a chroniclewritten many centuries later by Diodorus Siculus. This has been observed andcommented upon as follows:> Astrolabe B, after having mentioned the stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil, and> having connected them to 12 months of the year, gives 36 statements on> simultaneous risings and settings, of the following kind: 1 iku rises and> nin.mah disappears; dili.pat rises and zibanitum disappears; APIN rises and> en.te.na bar.guz disappears, etc. The stars thus linked together always stand> just 6 months apart in the astrolabe scheme. This means that every star is> supposed to be visible during 6 months and invisible during 6 months. Now this> is sheer mythology. Zodiacal stars are visible 10 or 11 months, and more> northern stars even longer. Also for daily risings and settings the statements> in the text are nonsense.> Myths have a longer life than astronomical theories, and so we must not be> astonished to find the same star myth, enriched and modified, in Diodorus> (2.30-1):> Under the course on which these planets move, according to them, thirty stars,> which they (the Chaldeans) designate as Counselling Gods; of these one half> oversee the regions above the earth and the other half those beneath the> earth, having under their purview the affairs of mankind and likewise those of> the heavens; and every 10 days one of the stars above is sent as a messenger,> so to speak, to the stars below, and again in like manner one of the stars> below the earth to those above, and this movement of theirs is fixed and> determined by means of an orbit which is unchanging forever. Twelve of these> gods, they say, hold chief authority, and to each of these the Chaldeans> assign a month and one of the signs of the Zodiac[…]1.Unfortunately, when it comes to the Etruscans, the chronicles are always laterand indirect. Though Arnobius’s writings were even later, there is no doubt thathe has much of interest to say on the topic:> In his 16th book, following Etruscan teachings, he [Nigidius Figulus; author’s> note] shows that there are four kinds of Penates; and that one of these> pertains to Jupiter, another to Neptune, the third to the shades below, the> fourth to mortal men, and then makes some unintelligible assertion[…].> Varro believes that they are the gods of whom we speak who are within, and in> the innermost recesses of heaven, and that neither their number nor names are> known. The Etruscans say that these are the Consentes, ‘They who make a> harmonious decision’, and the Complices, ‘They who are clutched together’,> naming them because they rise and fall together, six of them being male, and> as many female, with unknown names and pitiless dispositions, but they are> considered the counsellors and princes of Jove Supreme.2We find that ever so slowly, the inexorable passage of time warps a rich,varied, harmonious and gratifying vision of the world. The loss ofunderstanding, comprehension and recollection, along with the transition fromone culture to another, impoverishes it to the point that it almost completelyloses its extraordinary original value. What remained overcame the barrier ofcenturies but in so doing become almost unrecognizable and incomprehensible,retaining scant traces of what was once a majestic and brilliant conception ofthe relationship between man and the cosmos.And yet, on high:> Iuno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars,> Mercurius, Iovis, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo3continue to show themselves and show the way. As Ovid so nicely puts it,> Ah, happy souls, who first took thought to know these things> and scale the heavenly mansions!4Footnotes1This is excerpted from Van der Waerden 1949, pp. 6–26. 2Arnobius, adversus nations, 3.40.1 and 3: Nigidius […] in libro sexto exponit etdecimo disciplinas Etruscas sequens, genera esse Penatium quattuor et esse Iovisex his alios, alios Neptuni, inferorum tertios, mortalium hominum quartos,inexplicabile nescio quid dicens […] Varro qui sunt introrsus atque in intimispenetralibus caeli deos esse censet quos loquimur nec eorum numerum nec nominasciri. Hos Consentes et Complices Etrusci aiunt et nominant, quod una orianturet occidant una, sex mares et totidem feminas, nominibus ignotis et miserationisparcissimae; sed eos summi Iovis consiliarios ac principes existimari. 3These are the names of the Consentes Dii of which Ennius writes in hexameter:Juno, Minerva, Ceres and Diana are represented by the various aspects of theMoon; Neptune, Vulcan and Apollo by the Sun; Vesta by the Earth; Mercury, Venus,Mars and Jupiter by their respective planets. Saturn would appear to be missingfrom this list. 4Ovid, Fasti, 1.297-8: Felices animae, quibus haec cognoscere primis / inquedomus superas scandere cura fuit!"},{"pageContent":"POST SCRIPTUM: A NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS, WITH HINDSIGHTAstronomia Etrusco-Romana was first published in Italian in 2003, followingAstronomy and Calendar in Ancient Rome — The Eclipse Festivals in 2001, and LeFeste di Venere — Fertilità femminile e configurazioni astrali nel calendario diRoma antica in 1996. In nigh on a decade of “crazy, desperate” study, as GiacomoLeopardi would have it, I have reconstructed a solid framework of the Romancalendar’s astronomical underpinnings, especially the Numan calendar . Stars,Myths and Rituals in Etruscan Rome makes only minimal adjustments to thisframework, as well as adding some interesting elements to the fray.Over this time—and at long last—there has been a radical change in ourunderstanding of man’s relationship with the heavens during the time of Rome’searly kings. The eighth century BCE calendars that have survived the centuriesare no longer viewed as the basic calendars of an agricultural and pastoralsociety, lacking in any consideration for heavenly phenomena or the movements ofheavenly bodies; calendar feast days are no longer considered simpleanniversaries of natural events, such as storing away grain or lambing time. Onthe contrary, the Romulean calendar demonstrates an awareness of a number ofsignificant celestial phenomena, while the Numan calendar and cycle are a highlyadvanced—indeed, close to perfect—mechanism for monitoring observable movementsin the solar system.The end result of this research is a demonstration not just that Romans inAugustus’ day were mistaken in their belief—asserted time and time again byOvid, our best witness 1 —that Romans were uninterested in and had nounderstanding of astronomy. More importantly still, the end result is anacknowledgement that extraordinary attention was lavished on the heavens, and aspecific body of knowledge accrued in the heart of the Mediterranean duringancient times.Ultimately, Etrusco-Roman astronomy has been added to the canon of astronomicaltraditions, despite the fact that until recently nobody had so much as mentionedit; indeed, nobody had even suspected its existence. Etrusco-Roman astronomy hasnow taken its rightful place alongside astronomical approaches from around theworld (the Dogon, Polynesians, American Indians, Maya, and Incas); ancientastronomical bodies of knowledge from the major Eastern civilizations (China andIndia); and astronomical bodies of knowledge from the classical Mediterranean(Egypt, Babylon , and Greece).In this diverse panorama of astronomical bodies of knowledge, astronomy ofEtruscan Rome possesses one unique characteristic: it is completely written into its calendar. Legendary events that took place in Rome, almost all of whichthen shifted to the twilight zone between legend and history, were reiterated inthe science of heavenly bodies—a science that did not have its own independentexistence, but rather overlapped with and was ultimately subsumed by theperpetual repetition of fixed cadences in the Feriale antiquissimum . Equallyunique, all of this took place at a time and in a location where writing did notyet exist. Calendar codification and a lack of writing are the two convergentthemes that indicate the foreign provenance of this astronomical knowledge,whose traces were lost far before Ovid’s day. Now, twenty-five centuries on,this knowledge is being rediscovered from the ephemeral and still mysteriouslife of the Numan calendar and its cycles.Questions need to be answered about why this mysterious life was so brief, andwhy this knowledge disappeared and was utterly eclipsed; we should also lookinto why it has taken quite so long to rediscover this knowledge. The first ofthese questions has already been investigated, 2 and we return to these issueshere in summary, recapping from the very beginning, that is to say, theprovenance of the Numan calendar that the Etruscans brought with them from theEast, and then passed on to the Romans.The provenance can only be Babylonia ; a comparison between the rituals of the“substitute of the king” and Regifugium and Vestalia provides the best evidenceof this. 3 Babylonia is where astronomy and astrology were born, and where theydeveloped earlier and more completely than in any other culture known today. Itwas from Babylonia that Pythagoras—Numa’s real or presumed advisor—and othergreat pioneers of Greek and Western science drew so much of their wisdom. It wasfrom Babylonia , directly or indirectly, that the “barbarian better thanPythagoras” came; if we are to believe Plutarch, 4 this barbarian may havetutored Numa in the two divine sciences in a Rome that was only just emergingfrom the darkness of prehistory. As sciences, they were and remained foreign,before becoming a patrimony restricted to an élite of initiates who held thisknowledge and, with it, the power of “connecting the life of man to the life ofthe heavens”. The pontifices —still today, albeit in another guise—continue todo this, as they did then, by transmitting their precious knowledge from mouthto mouth in a tight circle of those privy to sacred matters, and to the mostsacred of all: the calendar.The same applies to India, where in the Jyotisavedanga it is explained:> The Veda have been revealed for the purpose of completing the sacrificial> rites and these rites have been placed according to a temporal order. Thus,> whoever is versed in astronomy, which is the science of the computation of> time, knows the sacrifices. 5It applied in Rome as well, where the pontifex minor— the youngest and leastexperienced—was responsible for observing the first lunar crescent marking thekalends. It is not known what observations, registrations, computations andpredictions were the preserve of the pontifex maximus . In any case, the deepmeaning of Cicero’s words is clear:> Once few knew whether it was permitted or not to proceed according to the law;> in reality, public festivals were not public. Those who were responsible for> them held great power, and they were asked even the day, as was asked of the> Chaldeans. 6The terse tamquam a Chaldeis is worth more than a hundred treatises on history,archeology and linguistics put together.We should not forget that climate influences such matters: the climate in Italyand Rome is not the same as the climate in Mesopotamia or Egypt. The consequenceof this it that it was no longer practically possible to keep the extended,ramified, and perhaps even obsessive activity of observation up endlessly, for athousand and one nights and a thousand and one years; an activity which had madeevery city in the Near East a focal point for the observation, measurement,recording and prediction of celestial events. The science declined until it fellinto obscurity, and the scientists dwindled in number until they disappeared.The pontifices were followed by the decemvirs, who were barely able to keepalive a simulacrum of a calendar, chock full of errors and omissions, andcharacterized as full of uncertainties and approximations by the historians ofRome.The coup de grace finally came in 304 BCE with the publication of a newcalendar, which was greatly desired and needed by the lower classes of merchantsand peasants. After its announcement in its roughest and most simplifiedform—how else could it be made public?—the calendar was no longer subject to thecorrections and adjustments it would periodically need, either by adding orsubtracting days. Even if anybody had retained the skills necessary to work onthe delicate and complex mechanism of the calendar, he would no longer have beenallowed to do so because the political and economic interests at stake were sohuge. The opinion and caprice of those in charge of managing the calendar ofwhich Censorinus 7 writes represent but one part of the truth; the rest is,without doubt, the effective loss of the knowledge needed to maintain thecalendar in working order.So much for the “brief and happy life” and subsequent unravelling of therelationship between astronomy and the Numan calendar . As for its rediscovery,one may legitimately wonder why it took quite so long, especially compared tohow long ago similar scientific discoveries were made in the 20th century: morethan 100 years have elapsed since Strassmeier, Epping and Kugler’s discovery ofBabylonian astronomy; over 70 years since Dogon and Polynesian astronomy werediscovered; 50 years since Mayan astronomy was discovered, and so on.Indeed, there have been times between 304 BCE (which we may assume to be thedate of the disappearance) and 1996 (when this rediscovery was first mooted)when it may have occurred but didn’t: for example, in Julius Caesar’s time, whena decision was made to reform the calendar; between the third and fourthcenturies CE, when the Empire was attempting to stave off decline and ultimatecollapse; after the Italian Renaissance, when classical heritage as a wholeunderwent reassessment; in the 19th century, when modern classical studies trulybegan; or in the latter half of the 20th century, after “hypercriticism” had runits course, and new, well-founded faith was vested in “sources”, that is to say,tangible evidence from classical times.Why did this rediscovery fail to take place earlier? Because in Caesar’s day,the concern was to correct crude errors that had accumulated over time and ledto an unacceptable gap between the theoretical calendar date and the actual timeof the year, in an attempt to salvage fragments of knowledge which had longsince been lost in proto-history. Between the third and fourth centuries CE, theprimary focus was on retrieving as much information as possible from the past,rather than reprocessing and inserting such information into a worldview thathad been lost forever. In the Renaissance, it was the more philosophical andaesthetic aspects of classical thought that appealed as part of the radicalrevision of rigid thought processes bequeathed by the dark ages. In the 19thcentury, the dominant idea was to accumulate and select elements that hadsurvived the years, sift through them—in some cases by comparing them withapproaches evident in contemporary “primitive” cultures—and then reorder andcatalogue them, at last, in accordance with what were considered rational andmodern criteria. Last but not least, in the latter part of the 20th century, arenewed focus on text led to a more meticulous, richer and more completeunderstanding of the many sources available, while at the same time favouringslower and closer individual examination as opposed to a global overview.In order of importance, the reasons for this long period of oblivion and thefailure to rediscover this knowledge at each of these times may be ascribed to:(1) a prejudicial belief in Roman astronomical ignorance; (2) an equallyprejudicial belief that each branch of knowledge—physics, mathematics,nature-related or philosophical—came to the Romans from the Greeks; (3) the evenmore prejudicial belief that the Greeks invented an entire worldview ex novo —abelief that was understandably ours—leading to the inevitable reaffirmation ofan indissoluble link between Aristotle and the Fathers of the Church.We should not ignore other fairy tales too: that the Romans possessed atangible, earthy view of the world because they were peasants, shepherds,warriors and lawmakers, in other words, because they were simply uninterested inabstractions or theoretical constructs; or the total unreliability of writtensources, owing to their relative lateness, their isolation, their confusion andcontradictory nature.Having cast these prejudices aside, the certainty of the secret “meaning” ofthings and—in the case of astronomy and the calendar—the strength of the numbersthemselves would have been more than sufficient, as indeed they proved to be, todispell the mystery—a mystery that many claimed did not even exist.The fact of the matter is that courage and imagination—freedom of thought—wasrequired to replace “whys” based on negativity and impediment with more positiveand enquiring “whys”. Why is the goddess Fortuna accompanied by Necessitas andSpes ? Why did Fortuna , a foreigner to Rome, have thirteen feast days in herhonour in the Numan calendar ? Why is she associated with other femaledivinities such as Venere Verticordia and Mater Matuta on two of these feastdays? Why are these feast days separated by a 72-day interval? And, mostimportantly, why are certain feast days named as they are: Veneralia , Matralia, Matronalia and Liberalia ?In conclusion, far better to cast aside ideological bonds and fly free andunencumbered in the aerial byways of research.L.M.—Torrimpietra, 15 March 2014The following table is divided into 12 sections, one for each month of the Numanyear.
