Specifically in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, thispseudo-science became an interest, and in some cases a passion, ofknowledgeable men: kings, princes, those employed by the royalcourt, doctors, and theologians. Unlike the classical and Renaissancestudy of astrology, medieval enthusiasts who studied the constella-tions did not clearly delineate between astrology, astronomy, andalchemy, all of which they brought together in their teachings andwritten works. This feature was due to the Arabic influence thatinsisted on observing a series of points or parts of the sky, ratherthan the Greek practice of concentration on the individual heavenlybodies.The Catalan writers, their rulers, and several Jewish and Christianastrologers and translators employed by the kings of Aragon studiedthe works of Greek, Arabic, and Persian astronomers and astrologers.These works include Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, or Quadripartitum, in itsLatin translation and oriental authors such as Ali Abenragel, Albu-mazar, and Abu l’Abbas Fargani (Al-Faragani), among others.From the time of Augustine to the thirteenth century, astrologyhad lost its prestige as a science due in part to Augustine’s depic-tion of astrology as an illegitimate practice, driven by “the powersof demons” (Wedel 23). Arabic commentaries on Greek astrologyand translations to Latin, such as Albumazar’s Introductorium in Astrono-miam, Liber conjuctionum siderum and Flores astrologiae, brought about anew interest in this pseudoscience in western Europe. This new prac-tice began to attract leading Christian scholars, such as Albert theGreat (Wedel 66), who made concessions to judicial astrology, andRoger Bacon (Wedel 72–73), who read both Greek and Arabic stud-ies on this subject, with a preference for Ptolemy.xiLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiLeading figures took an interest in astrology in the late MiddleAges. Pope John XXII practiced alchemy, while the Spanish PopeBenedict XIII collected many books on astrology in his personallibrary (Rubió i Lluch 1917–18: 12). Charles V of France was apatron of astrology, and amassed one of the leading libraries ofEurope, containing some 11,000 books in the form of manuscripts(Wedel 94–95), many of which were astrological studies; he alsobrought to his court a cadre of prominent astrologers.II.Arnau de VilanovaArnau de Vilanova is regarded by many as the leading physician ofhis time, the thirteenth century. He held the Chair of Medicine atthe University of Montpellier during the last decade of this period.Leading potentates and popes vied for him to be their personal physi-cian, including the Kings of Aragon, Pere III and Jaume III ofMajorca, Frederick of Sicily, and popes of Avignion, Boniface VIIIand Benedict XI.Arnau accepted only theology and knowledge based on naturalscience, and rejected philosophical speculation, especially Scholasticism.In short, he sought God throughout nature. Religion was thereforeaccessible to all human beings because it was based on experienceand revelation, not on philosophy. Using the deductive method,Arnau bypassed philosophical speculation by asserting that experi-ence brings about reason, both of which are the sources of science.One must therefore reach God through nature.Having discarded philosophy. Arnau opted for a new concept ofman and the cosmos whose origins lie in Neoplatonism. In thisprocess, however, Arnau gave precedence to imagination rather thanto an objective scrutiny of data found in nature. The result of thisprocess was magic and spiritualist theories, described as “una con-cepción fantástica de la naturaleza” (Vilanova 1:217).Arnau studied humans (their differences, abnormalities, sicknesses,witchcraft) and concluded that a vital force he called “spiritus” (animmaterial force “fluido” of cosmic character) became an intimateand motivating part of each individual being. Arnau did concede inhis De conservandathat the stars do not have a prophetic hold onmen, but rather dispose than compel (“necessitas”) them. He addedLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiiithat the role of scientific knowledge is important in this process.Arnau was also convinced that the psychic influence of one beingcan also affect others who come under its domain by allowing oth-ers to control one’s will (e.g. necromancy). Easily transferred fromone being to another, this vital force owes its source to the constantmotion here on earth caused by celestial bodies. However, it is Godwho sets the stars in motion, causing positive results on humans.There is also a hierarchy in which pure spirits influence inferiorones, such as the human soul. Only God can control evil spirits,although God can allow holy men to control diabolical beings, butno evil person can invoke demons. Furthermore, the celestial worldmay govern nature in a specific way, again through the influence ofthe stars, which possess a hidden virtue that does not exist in humans.This cosmic animation has the power to create gold, whereas alchemistsmay bring about a stone that only resembles gold, because they lackthis hidden virtue.These convictions taken from astronomers, astrologers, and alchemistsof the past formed the basis for Arnau’s medical practices, whichmanifested themselves in magic and astrology. His treatments andpotents accorded with this occultist concept of nature.Astrology played an important role in Arnau’s medical practices.Objects suspended in space could have a positive or negative effectand, most importantly, a hidden force or “virtues,” and the appli-cation of these “virtues” constituted his practice of medical astrol-ogy. This form of cure was based on lunar phases and especiallythe influence of the predominant star on the human body. In addi-tion, in the De iudiciis astronomiae, Arnau concluded that the currentzodiacal sign of the moon is of greater importance in curing a patientthan is the motion of heavenly bodies, specifically on their effect onprescribed medicines (McVaugh 164). He resorted also to amuletsand images of celestial bodies that were composed of valuable min-erals, as well as the use of seals (see his treatise De sigillis).Arnau wrote books on medicine and was a pioneer of the mainoccult sciences in the Latin West, including alchemy, astrology, andthe interpretation of dreams. Lynn Thorndike (3:155–60) and JoaquimCarreras Artau (in Vilanova 2:19–86), among others, have shownthat throughout the late Middle Ages and Early Modern era, Arnau’smedieval and pharmaceutical treatises were studied and translated.A leading treatise on alchemy, Arnau’s Rosarius philosophorumbecameLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiva well-known work in light of numerous manuscripts and printededitions of and commentaries on its content. It is obvious that Arnau’smajor contribution to astrology was medical astrology, and the lengthytreatise, Capitula astrologiae de iudiciis infirmitatum secundum motum planeta-rum, is a major source of this branch of astrology. The De sigillisdescribes the structure of amulets and their purpose for specialoccasions.III.Ramon LlullRamon Llull, a contemporary of Arnau, informed his readers aboutastrological and astronomic beliefs in several works, including Felix(1288), Libre de meravilles(1288–1289), Arbre de sciència(1296), andTractatus novus de astronomia(1297). Like other medieval Hispanicauthors, Llull came under the influence of Ali Abenragel and otherArabic astronomers and astrologers, although his traditional systemof correspondence has been described as simple, traditional, andderived from Ptolemy, “the most exact” (Samsó 201–02). He assigneda letter, A to D, to each of the four basic complexions, and thenestablished connections between these and the signs of the zodiacand the planets. He also used houses in which the maximum influenceof each sign is reached. Furthermore, each planet represented ahuman quality, a metal, and a day of the week: (e.g. Saturn: evil,lead, Saturday).Despite certain errors in his astrological system, Llull attemptedto supply elements lacking in the traditional system by resorting tohis Art, thereby bringing to medieval astrology a unique feature. Andalthough especially interested in some 28 planetary “conjunctions,”Llull was unable to solve the problem of the number of possible“conjunctions” on the seven planets in the sign of the zodiac (Samsó205–207). However, like other religious figures of the time, Llull usedcaution. In several works, he addressed the doctrines of free will andGod’s omnipotence (Samsó 204; Bonner 14; Libre de meravilles1:156–57),although, according to Juan Vernet, Llull’s acceptance of the free-will doctrine was not of “excesiva importancia” (189–91).Ramon Llull also showed interest in medical astrology, taking intoaccount the complexion of humans together with medicines derivedfrom plants, in relation to the stars. Furthermore, the nature andamount or degree of medicine prescribed to a patient suffering froma humoral imbalance was determined by the person’s horoscopeLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xv(Samsó 204). Llull also was conscious of the uses of the astrolabeand astronomical tables and learning to tell time on the astrolabe.IV.The Catalan Kings of Aragon and Astrology: Pere the Ceremonious and His SonsAs a youth Jaume II sought the knowledge of astronomy and theoccult as well as medicine and other oriental science. His son andheir, Alfons IV (1327–1336), translated from Latin to Catalan a bookon solar and lunar eclipses (Beaujouan 14–15). It was, however, dur-ing the reign of Pere III (1336–1387) that astrology, alchemy, andastronomy became a major interest of study.Pere, whose main emphasis was in astrology and alchemy, popu-lated his royal court with Jewish astrologers who were asked to pro-duced astronomical instruments. Encouraged by his father Alfons’interest and the works on astronomy that issued forth from the courtof Alfonso X of Castile, Pere requested that astronomers Pere Gilbertand Dalmau Ses Planes observe the course of the planets. He alsoordered an almanac to be written between 1360 and 1366. In col-laboration with the astronomers Jacob Al-Corsi, author of a treatiseon the astrolabe, Pere drew up a book on astrological tables andthe eight spheres that was published in Hebrew, Latin, and Catalan(Beaujouan 16–17). He also purchased works on astrology (Rubió iLluch 1908–21, 2:171; Rubió i Lluch 1994: 231–32).Pere’s interest in alchemy is shown by his allowing Joan d’Ulzinelles,“militis,” and Gabriel Mayol, “jurisperitus,” to write a book on“alchimie auri et argenti” (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:319). In addi-tion, Pere endeavored to obtain astronomical paraphernalia fromVidal and Bellshom Efraïm (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 2:xvi), as wellas an astrolabe from another source (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 2:171).Pere’s curiosity about astrology became an obsession with his sonand heir Joan I (1387–1395), whom Rubió i Lluch described as“more superstitious than his father” (1917–18, 12). Joan consultedfrequently with astronomers and astrologers, such as Juce, Jew ofOsca, on matters concerning the wedding celebrations, the births ofhis children, and other important events (Roca 141). John sufferedfrom an illness described as an acute form or type of epilepsy (Tasis165–66). However, convinced that these symptoms were caused bywitchcraft, Joan’s wife, Violant de Bar, the niece of Charles V ofFrance, resorted to reading the Cogonina, a famous work on necromancyLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviby the bishop of Barcelona, Jaume Cigó. Joan’s symptoms subsided,leaving him mindful of the importance of medicine. He became anavowed protector of science in general and astrology, and of theJewish and Moorish minorities, to whom he felt indebted, especiallyof Jewish men of science (Tasis 165–67). His interest in astrology,described by Rubió i Lluch (1917–18: 18) as incorrigable, becamea pastime along with music and hunting.Jewish astrologers were among Joan’s main resources for astro-logical works. Before ascending the throne, Joan requested booksfrom his contemporaries, including Bartomeu de Tresbéns, who wasasked to visit Joan and bring with him all his books on “astrologiai fisica” (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:264). A similar request was madeto Jucef Abernaduch the same year (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:195).In 1379 Joan insisted that Dalmau Ses Planes bring him a book onsolar and lunar eclipses. Later, in 1381, Isaac Nafusi of the royalcourt, commissioned Vidal Efraïm, a Majorcan Jew, to finish severalworks on astrology for Joan (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:293). Duringthe same year Joan acknowledged the receipt of a book by Ali AbenJaren (Alfagra), and requested a volume by Ali Abenragel from theking’s archives (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:320 and 2:xxvi).Martí I (1387–1410), who became king at Joan’s death, is knownto historians as “el Humà” (the Human), because of his dedicationto the humanities. He is also known by a less familiar and rarelyused sobriquet, that of “Eclesiàstic.” Rubió i Lluch (1908–21, 2:xlvi)conceived of Martí as a “monk” who became the legitimate heir andwas crowned king. What Martí lacked of Joan’s interest in sciencesand the pseudo-sciences, he made up in religiosity. Martí faithfullyattended church services, enjoyed staying in monasteries, read thebreviary, and decorated churches, including his own chapel. He also became a close friend of Benedict XIII, the last of the Avig-non popes.Martí also followed Pere’s and Joan’s passion for collecting andreading books in different disciplines. However, he preferred to acquirereligious works (Bible, Psalters, missals, books on hagiography, theliturgy, and speculative religious works). This is not to say that helacked interest in astronomy and pseudosciences. Martí inherited alibrary containing some 3,000 volumes, about fifty of which dealt withastrology and necromancy. Of these fifty volumes many came fromthe private libraries of Pere and Joan (Rubió i Lluch 1917–18: 12–13).LUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xvi"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xviiV.Francesc EiximenisTo date no comprehensive study has been written on Francesc Eixi-menis’ (1327–1409) views on astrology, partly because much of hiswritings remain in manuscript form. Despite the absence of editions,an evaluation of any subject on the late medieval Kingdom of Aragonmust include his opinions and insights for the following reasons.Eiximenis set out to complete an encyclopedic work, in the medievalsense of the term, which he titled El Crestià(The Christian); hedivided the work into thirteen books that addressed most aspects ofChristianity. Only four books are extant, a fact that leads scholarsto the conclusion that he never penned them. Instead, Eiximenisincluded new material meant for the Crestiàin later works he wroteon women, moral theology, ascetism, Christology, etc. His writingsfrom 1383 to 1392 centered around social topics, for which he earnedthe reputation among twentieth-century scholars of being the chron-icler of late medieval society in the kingdom of Aragon.Before bringing to light his astrological beliefs, let us recall twohistorical sources on Eiximenis and the occult sciences. First, Eiximeniswas accused of teaching Pope Benedict XIII necromancy (Probst 6).However, the accusation lacks validity given the friar’s opposition tonecromancy and his turning toward asceticism, prayer, and Christologyin his later life, when he came to support the Spanish pope. Didthis anecdote originate from malice, confusion with, or misrepre-sentation (i.e. Arnau’s teaching Pope Boniface the art of alchemy)?Unlike this questionable charge, Eiximenis’ confrontation with Joan I is well documented and scrutinized (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21,1:372; Bohigas 31–34; Roca 139–40). Eiximenis, who was drawn toprophetic-apocalyptic tendencies, wrote in the Dotzè(ch. 466) that inthe year 1400 all kingdoms of the world would cease to exist exceptthe kingdom of France and its rulers. The passage apparently wentunnoticed for several years by the Catalan kings, but in 1391, fol-lowing on the heels of the Jewish pogroms in the kingdoms of Castileand Aragon, it came to Joan’s attention, and he immediately calledupon his chancellor, Pere d’Artés, to present a letter to Eiximenisstating: “Mestre francesch Ximeniz qui a vegades sentremet de lartde astronomia, pronostica e diu que ans que no passara lany Mccc.no haura algun Rey de cristians al mon, sino tansolament rey deFrança” (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:172). Placed on the defensive,LUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviiiEiximenis wrote back an apologetic letter to the king, which Joananswered (Rubió i Lluch 1908–21, 1:373–74).Like his predecessors Ramon Llull and Arnau, Eiximenis wroteprolifically. However, he was a compiler rather than an originalauthor, although at times he assertively expressed his beliefs. Onefinds at times in his works contrary opinions on minority groups andconfrontational topics during his lifetime. Regarding his views onastrology, Josep Torres i Bages wrote:Eiximenis s’hi veu sovint la lluita entre l’obediència que vol tenir al’autoritat de la Iglésia, qui damnava l’astrologia judiciàra, i la sevaforta afició a les arts secretes i amagades que li prometien resultatsmeravillosos; així, no obstant lo transcrit, en altres llocs manifesta lesextralimitacions de l’astrologia, i al tractar de la arts i oficis damnificantsa la societat enumera als “alquimistes qui comunament són orats eenganadors (106).I have cited or summarized representative passages culled from sev-eral of Eiximenis’ works in order to analyze Eiximenis’ attitude towardastrology and any contradictions concerning this pseudoscience thatare evident in his works in light of Torres i Bages’ passage, and willattempt to explain his attitudes toward these ancient sciences.Eiximenis dedicated several chapters of his first extant work, thePrimer del Crestià(1379), to astrology. Of the subjects that do not per-tain to the clergy’s curriculum (“no pertanyen a religiós”), he includedarithmetic, geometry, and especially astrology (Primer, ch. 32). Eixi-menis also reacted negatively to geomancy, “aquella mala art” (Primer,ch. 70).In the Primer, Venus, which represents the earth, and especiallyJupiter are the most favorable stars. He also equated six planets withthe six major religious groups he regarded as the most important: theJews, Caldeans, Egyptians, Christians, Muslims, and followers of theAntichrist. He revealed his source as Albumazar, “Livre des conun-tions”, Books 1–2, probably a commentary on the author’s De magnisconjunctionibus. In the Primer, ch. 184, Eiximenis opposed Albumazarby upholding the Christian belief on free will, citing St. Bernard andother Christian writers. Here Eiximenis introduced a proof repeatedin his subsequent works, stating that Islam, which was to last 693years due to the influence of Jupiter and Venus, had outlived itself-some 800 years; therefore, he concluded that only God knows thefuture. The author also refuted Albumazar’s and other astrologers’belief that the planets were the cause of miracles (Primer, ch. 61).LUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xviii"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xixEiximenis made mention several times in the Primerthat he wouldreturn to the topic of the constellations “coses celestials” and relatedsubjects such as magic, unexplained phenomena, and diabolical worksin the eighth book of the Crestià, which he probably never wrote.In the Segon del Crestià(chs. 94–98), Eiximenis presented his mostlengthy exposition on judicial astrology, specifying the location andascendance of a number of planets. He also revealed his source as“Ali, gran astrolech, fill de Abeutragil, en lo terç libre seu dits Juysastrolechs.” The astronomer to whom he referred is the eleventh-century Ali Abenragel (Gascón 394–95). Eiximenis included in chap-ter 94 of the Segona detailed account about whether constellationscould be used to interpret “natural” dreams and visions.In chapter 95, the Franciscan began his refutation of Ali Abenragel’sastrological convictions, stating that only the meaning that God givesto dreams and visions is true: “negun nos deu friar en ni deu darfe a negun jhuy astrolech sino fort atart e ab comuna concordan-cia de molts scients en la dita art e en materia que nos puxa regirni mudar per nostre franch arbitre.” Eiximenis went on to say thatno clergyman should study astrology because such study conveys abad example.According to Eiximenis, before the coming of Jesus learned menstudied and upheld the validity of astrology, but after his death astrol-ogy no longer was considered a reliable study for predicting thefuture. Here Eiximenis resorted to a common practice with whichto refute Islamic and Jewish astrology: the works of Ptolemy: “lomper prudencia natural pot senyorejar a les steles, e per conseguentmolt mils hi senyoreja hom devot, requirent e tement Deu, qui sola-ment posa sa fe en Deu.” Likewise, in chapter 98, Eximenis sum-marized his conclusions, again citing Ptolemy: celestial influencecannot cause one to sin because free will can overcome the stars’force, especially with the help of divine grace.In the Terç del Crestià(chs. 133–34), Eiximenis continued in thesame vein of argumentation, partly popular and partly scholastic, onthe root of evil. Eiximenis was fond of stereotyping different racialgroups. In these chapters he described the Germans and the Englishas serious and easily provoked, while the French were happy andeasygoing. These stereotypical discussions moved gradually to theplanets and constellations as the cause of racial personalities. HereEiximenis repeated his much-used astrological example, which hedescribed as “la general sentència dels estròlechs”: humors, whichLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxEiximenis called “malícies”, appear in specific regions that are gov-erned by a specific planet. Therefore the influence of Saturn is feltin regions in which men are malicious and stubborn, and Venus,where men are sensual (1929–32, 2:18). Again Eiximenis repeatedthe reference he insisted came from Ptolemy (1792 [MS], ch. 14),stating that Saturn and Mars cause malice in those born under theirsign, and Jupiter exhibits “bons costumes” to all. Those born underthe influence of Mercury show a positive trait (good nature) andtheir negative side (evil) (1792 ch. 686).Eiximenis also used astrology for his own ends and proofs. In hiswritings, especially in the Primer, he put forth characteristics of non-Christian racial and religious groups that inhabited Iberia in theMiddle Ages, mainly Jews and Moors. The Franciscan also stereo-typed Jews in chapter 119, in which he added “la malicia judayca,”labeling them with traits and moral characters caused by the influenceof Saturn, which is melancholic, cold, dry, nocturnal, and powerful.More concretely, Eiximenis, basing his conclusions on Ptolemy’sQuadripartitum2, chapter four, concluded that Jews were not adeptas government leaders because of their indecisiveness, laziness, melan-choly, and other negative traits.Despite the constant mention of free will and God’s grace as decid-ing factors in one’s salvation, Eiximenis was indeed attracted to astrol-ogy and astronomy. Contemplating the beauty God created, Eiximenisasked his reader to look to the heavens: “e pensa lavors quina graneaes aquella del cel scelat e veuras que segons que posa los astrolechs,tota la terra no es sino un punt e un centre petit e invisible peresguart d’El” (1792 [MS], ch. 939). Again in the Llibre de les dones(1392), Eiximenis insisted that his reader contemplate the beauty ofthe works of God, “axí com són los cels, e.1 lur ornament, move-ment e ferm estament, e influximent e influència a les coses jusanesleva molt lo cor a loar lo poder de nostre senyor Déu” (2:526). Thisbeauty revolves around the earth, which Eiximenis paints in darkhues (1971: 433).The Dotzè libre del Crestiàis, in large part, concerned with the edu-cation of the prince. Eiximenis is ambivalent in giving advice to royalleaders on the reliability of astrology. In the second part of the Dotzè,in which he placed freedom of the will above astrological influence,the Franciscan suggested that the prince take into account the per-sonal constellations of those who govern (2:2,310–11), especially ifthey are of “complexion diversa” (Dotzè 2:2,293). The prince mustLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xx"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxialso allow predication of his food, especially at banquets, as well asthe hygiene and the direction of his responsibilities (2:1,198). However,the prince must not place much faith in astrology because he willlose confidence in God and thereby allow the luminaries to controlhim (2:1,198).In another chapter of the Dotzè, Eiximenis referred to astrologyas a “sciència errable,” in which several astrologers might predictcontradictory interpretations of the stars: “sobre una matexa con-clusió diveres astròlechs fan juys contràries” (2:1,209). Eiximenistherefore followed the theological approach by repudiating theastrologers’ opinions and adding exempla in which Julius Caesar(2:1,264–65) and Robert of Sicily (2:2,218–19) show their disregardfor astronomy.In the Dotzè, (ch. 24), Eiximenis stated that Barcelona, his modelcity, owed its origin to a fortuitous constellation. Based on his source,Halirafal’s Judiciari, this city’s fortune and prosperity was due to thefruitfulness of its generations of Catalans, especially their intelligence,wealth, and modest honors.The Dotzè(chs. 108–10) deals with the question about whetherconstellations can affect construction of cities or dwellings. Eiximenisbrought forth unexplained occurrences: a person dies of the plaguewhereas his neighbor is not affected by it; a woman gives birth inone home, yet when moved to another house she cannot conceive.Eiximenis again resorted to Ptolemy (propositio xxii, xxxvi) to affirmthe influence of certain stars. These two chapters were recently stud-ied together with chapter 126, which reads somewhat like an almanac.Eiximenis began the latter chapter by referring to New Year’s day,which fell on a Sunday, and made predictions for each day, includ-ing the weather for the year, divided into the four seasons, agricul-tural predictions, natural disasters, diseases (including plagues), andwar. He concluded this discussion by revealing his source:Diu Alidonius Cordubensis, recitant les dites coses per vida de natura,ajuda molt lo art de astrologia, mas sobre tot es posar bo en les mansde Nostre Senyor Deu a quia pertany principalment saber les cosesesdevenidors e al qual plau mes hom se reta ignorant en esta materiaper la sua reverencia, que no massa entrecuydat per propria astucia.The aforementioned scholars who have studied the three chaptersas a unit found it odd that Eiximenis would dedicate so much mate-rial to the influence of the constellations, especially the predictionsLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxiifor each season and, in a brief paragraph, negate under the bannerof free will all that he had written regarding astrological beliefs. Theyoffer two conclusions: either Eiximenis used astrological referencesto lure his readers, given the popularity of astrology in the four-teenth century, or the Franciscan was attracted to astrological pre-dictions. However, to avoid the risk of being a true believer in judicialastrology, he relegated these astrological assertions to men of thepast and placed at the end of each treatise on astrology a refuta-tion that included the undeniable beliefs in the ultimate power offree will and God’s ability to control the stars.In chapter 120 of the Dotzè, on how the influence of the stars cre-ates a virtuous king, Eiximenis admitted Cronica that evil rulers,such as Baltasar, according to rabi Heleatzar’s Cronica judaica, pros-pered and were fortunate in war, as was Sciprion Africanus, a vir-tuous leader. Here Eiximenis somewhow omitted the reference tofree will.Throughout part 1 of the Dotzè, especially in his treatise on theprince and war, Eiximenis discussed the effect of celestial bodies onvictory in battle. These chapters include the Dotzè, ch. 223, whichconcludes, according to Ptolemy, that men are more inclined to excelin war: the influence of Mars, which predestines men born underthis sign to become virtuous and fortunate in battle.Chapters 284–286 are especially informative. In chapter 284, “Comla constellacio celestial ajuda en batalles,” Eiximenis described sev-eral remedies for misfortune that border on the occult. However, inthe next chapter (285), he refuted their remedies, insisting that theChurch opposed such beliefs. Eiximenis (chs. 285–286) preferred the“merits de les volentats dels homens e ordinacio divinal” to the “puraobra de natura,” and denied potions and incantations, leaving all inGod’s hands. He also labeled such practices as bitter superstitions,referring his reader to Machabeus 1.3. However, in the Dotzè2,Eiximenis continued to return to the science of astronomy and pseu-doscience of astrology in order to predict success in battle. In chap-ter 550 (2:1,189), he described Alexander as learned, handsome, rich,fortunate in arms, and amiable, and accepted the influence of thestars. But the friar immediately stepped back, warning those whoexamined these influences too closely that they would fall into thesuperstition of the devil. Here again he returned to the Christianacronym of free will and divine grace in Ptolemy’s works.Also, his Llibre de les dones, Eiximenis, recalled Alexander once againLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxii"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxiiiin a chapter in which the author sought to prove that it was possi-ble for an illegitimate child to become a good Christian. Eiximenis’description of Alexander as a “bon cavaller” gradually became tar-nished when he listed defects he attributed to the Greek’s supposedillegitimacy: “fort pompós e altiu, desconexent a molt e taccat d’als-cuns vices,” some of which Eiximenis attributed to the ruler’s eviltutor. To disguise his illegitimacy, Alexander wished to be called“son of Jupiter.” Although as the son of Jupiter he could not rulethe “empire of Greece,” Jupiter allowed him to reign among thestars so that Alexander could rule the land. Once again Eiximeniscuriously omitted in this discussion the superiority of free will andthe divine will and grace.Although the stars could not affect humans who freely chose good—aided by God’s grace—or evil, the planets could influence animatebeings and inanimate objects. Military arms, such as swords forgedunder certain signs, favored the warrior who carried them into bat-tle by adding to his bravery and fortitude. As an example, Eiximenisalso referred to a sword Jaume I, conqueror of Valencia, had in hispossession, as well as the one that Pere III carried with him (Dotzè,ch. 288; 2:246). Eiximenis inferred that he had seen these swords.Besides metals, the moon and celestial bodies influenced the growthof fruits and other foods, according to the Greek and Roman writ-ers Eiximenis cited. On a lighter note, to chase away bothersomeflies, Eiximenis recommended fabricating a fly of pure gold withwings of iron on “lo dia de Mercuri” (Torres i Bages, 2:105).In the Dotzè, chapter 287, Eiximenis discussed a thorny issue: ifand when a soldier, especially an officer, should retreat from battlewhen facing an imminent defeat. The Franciscan suggested that thesoldier remove himself from the battleground when a perilous cometshould appear in the heavens and followed Ptolemy’s Species de cometes,book 9. He went on to outline a summary description of cometsand constellations and their effects on agriculture and on the livesof kings and nobles. In the Dotzè, ch. 288, Eiximenis continued bydescribing stars and comets, their unique colors and effects on pro-duce and on military decisions.In his curriculum for the sons of princes and kings, Eiximenis alsorecommended astrology be included, but he stressed that kings ofthe past invoked the divine before consulting the stars. However, thefriar considered political and military decisions to be of utmost impor-tance to the kingdom. Therefore, he recommended for the princesLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxiii"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xxivof his time the study of theology, metaphysics, medicine, and ethics,as well as law, swordmanship, and military tactics. The princes’confidence should be in God, not in the constellations.Eiximenis also preferred the opinions of theologians and opposedthose of philosophers who believed in the effects of the constella-tions (Dotzè2:2,450). He therefore warned his lay readers who werenot trained in theology, philosophy, and canon law not to take upeither astrology or alchemy because they may become involved innecromancy: “Car en aquestes dues ciències són gran disposició acaure en aquesta mala art” (1927: 134–36). They will become deceit-ful, suffer, and die a harsh death that they ironically cannot them-selves predict. In the Llibre dels àngels(Book IV, ch. 31, f. 83v),Eiximenis continued in the same negative vein: to seek knowledgeto which only God is privy drives one to the ways of Satan. Andhaving been deceived by the devil, the sinner deceives others.Throughout the Dotzè, Eiximenis wrestled with astrology andalchemy as a profession. In the Primer, chs. 60–61, the friar statedthat alchemy is only revealed to few people, for example, Solomon,whom God instructed in this science. In the Dotzè(2:2,229), Eiximenislamented that there were no good astrologers in his day as therewere in the past. Given the complexity of this science, most pre-ferred the less complicated subjects, such as medicine and law, whichprovided a steady and lucrative income. Eiximenis used chapters 143to 147 of the Dotzèto expound on these professions. He began withAristotle (Politicorum2), whom he upheld as an exemplary philoso-pher because he refused to use his knowledge of astronomy to becomewealthy by predicting good and bad harvests. The friar then strongtogether several short narrations involving astrologers and alchemistsin the service of royalty and nobles whose predictions and magicbrought about the desired results. Yet Eiximenis remained cautiousand reaffirmed his opinion that there were in his time very fewlearned men in astronomy and alchemy (Dotzè, ch. 145 and 2:2,219),perhaps a quip toward the Jewish notables who populated the royalcourts of Aragon during the era of the last Catalan kings.Medieval Christianity, however, was hard pressed to reject astrol-ogy. At the birth of Jesus, the Bible tells that the Magi from Persiafollowed a celestial omen to Bethlehem. However, Eiximenis madeonly a brief mention of the event in his Vita Christi, one of his majorworks: “Ell fa aparèixer novella estela qui fa venir los tres reis d’OrientLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxiv"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"xxven Betlem a adorar-lo aqui” (Eiximenis 1951: 31; 1496, f. 93r). Onthe other hand, Mary, to whom Eiximenis dedicated several chap-ters of the Vita Christi, is referred to in an astrological context:eylla nasque en lo XXII grau del signe apellat virgoen lo zodiac celes-tial en lo qual grau e signe estech lavors feta conjuncio de plenetes,axi alta que james no estec ne n sera semblant en lo dit signe, perque diu lavors los grans astrolecs de Egipte jutgaran que aquel anyverifica (Vita Christich. 2: De vita Christi, fol. 19r).This reference, in which Eiximenis insisted that Mary excelled aboveall others in purity, is especially interesting because he relied onastrology when it did not conflict with Christian thought or when itdid not originate with Arabic astrologers. On another occasion,Eiximenis supported the metaphysical view of Aristotle, Avicena, andAugustine that angels inhabit and propel celestial circles: “mouen afer lur cors natural e ordinary” (Àngelsbook 4, ch. 5). Through theirmovement they control the twenty-four hour day and the time ittakes for a human to walk 36,000 days. This reference is a misin-terpretation of Ptolemy, who stated that a star travels the heavensin 36,000 years, while a man can walk around the earth in less thanthree years. Eiximenis also reminded his readers of the great gift(“virtut”) God, who created the skies, gave to angels.Several conclusions can be drawn from sections of Eiximenis’ worksdiscussed here. He was familiar, at least in part, with the Latin ver-sion, the Quadripartitum, of Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, and, on occasiontranslated passages from this work into Catalan. On the other hand,there is no evidence that Eiximenis consulted Ptolemy’s Almagest, per-haps because this work was too technical for him. The Franciscanappears to accept sections he had cited from the Quadripartitum.However, he is cautious regarding Arabian astrologers, although heseems to be drawn to Albumazar’s astrology, as were Christian writ-ers, in part due to its Aristotelian basis, including the doctrine ofthe fifth essence and the stratification of the different spheres. Nomatter how attracted Eiximenis became to Arabian science, he quicklylifted his shield, the doctrine of free will, which he was compelledto uphold as a Christian theologian. In addition, the fatalism hefound in Arabian juridical astrology would also cause him to turnaway (Peláez 433–44). Eiximenis found in Islam a religion that notonly approved of magic and astrology, but also encouraged theirpractice. This is especially evident in the Franciscan’s attack on IslamLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxv"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"xxviand Mohammed’s miracles in the Primer(Cerulli 41–77). Especiallyin the chapters on Islam in the Primer, Eiximenis discussed aspectsof Mohammed’s life and miracles as doubtful, deceitful, superstitious,and immoral. Another aspect of Eiximenis’ attitude that, to my knowl-edge, has been overlooked by scholars is the disconcerting presenceof astrologers and alchemists whom he discreetly regarded as ama-teurish. This label, as it existed in Eiximenis’ mind, was figurativelyplaced on Pere III and his sons and on court astronomers andastrologers, including the well-known Hasdai Cresques, whom JoanI had consulted on the veracity of Eiximenis’ prediction on the futureelimination of all kings except the French monarch. Was Eiximenisenvious of the prestige Jewish astronomers and physicians held inthe kingdom in which he lived his adult life? Rubió i Lluch (1917–18:10–18) attests to the trust Joan placed in the prediction of Jewishastronomers, whom he believed to be more knowledgeable on thesematters than the Franciscan’s and Majorcan navigators.VI.Astrologers in the Royal CourtBartomeu de Tresbéns (1:11) was a physician in the service of PereIII and Joan I from 1361 to 1374. When Pere became convincedof his physician’s expertise in astrology and in the astronomical tables,he requested that Tresbéns write a treatise on astrology. The Tractatd’astrologia, completed before 1383, combines Greek and Arabianastrology and concentrates on the position of the stars at the momentof a birth. Pere was especially interested in such a treatise not onlyfor himself but also as a means of learning about his friends andenemies.Of the many astrologers in Pere’s court, four stand out. PereGilbert and his student Dalmau Ses Planes wrote, at the king’srequest, works entitled Taules astronòmiquesand an Almanac. Dalmaucontinued in the royal court from 1364 to 1383 (Gascón 391). JacobCorsuno, who served Pere as an astrologer, translator, and scribe,penned the Taules de Barcelona, while Bellshom Efraïm translated astro-logical works by Al-Faragani.LUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxvi"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxviiVII.ConclusionAstrology and astronomy commanded much interest in the latemedieval kingdom of Aragon. Physicians and theologians, even popes,were attracted to studying the constellations. Kings and princes col-lected numerous books on astrology, astronomy, alchemy, and relatedsubjects, and consulted with both Christian and Jews on these sub-jects. Also, the horoscope and instruments such as the astrolabe wereprized much as telescopes and other scientific instruments are today.Much of this fervor must be credited to Arab and Persian astrologerswho had brough Ptolemy to the Latin West, adorned in a differentattire to attract leading minds of the Middle Ages.In the Kingdom of Aragon as in neighboring realms (Castile andFrance), the pseudoscience astrology had captured the attention ofleading intellectuals such as Ramon Llull, Arnau de Vilanova, andFrancesc Eiximenis; kings and princes called upon men of learningto examine, translate, and compose books on the planets and con-stellations. The search now continues in this neglected area of Catalanstudies with today’s scholars, such as John Lucas, who has broughtforth in this book the rich heritage of medieval astrology in the king-dom of Aragon with modern editions of works such as his editionof Tractat de prenostication.David J.

This curious lit-tle incunable helps to tell a story. The story is not mine, of course,and others would tell it somewhat differently. Since time immemo-rial, men and women have gazed at the stars. I need not belaborthe reader with the questions they asked, for we ask many of thesame ones ourselves.Our story has to do with astrology, numerology, and—at a morebasic level—with the slowly-unfolding mysteries of nature. Feared bymany, revered by some, and dismissed as harmless nonsense by morethan a few, astrology and numerology are simply tools used to answersome of the questions that necessarily arise from peering too longinto the cosmos. Tinged as they are with magic, these timeless artsof prognostication had the power to seduce both temporal and spir-itual leaders; but they could also topple governments and ruin rep-utations. Although the argument must not be taken too far, theseearly forms of science certainly brought some to an untimely demise.However the prognostic arts are no less a part of the history ofwestern science than chemistry or biology. They are often dismissedby a post-modern world far too uncomfortable with mystery. Proudof our own bold attempts to crack the codes of nature, we fear totread with hesitant steps towards the very essence of creation itself.We do so well aware of the consequences, ethical and scientific, thatthese endeavors entail. Are we so different from our stargazing ances-tors in this respect? Certainly our tools are different, better, moreprecise. But is our own post-modern eclecticism so very differentfrom medieval syncretism? We use what we have available, awarethat those who follow may find different answers.The Tractat de prenosticationis a handbook, a practical fortune-tellingguide, the kind of thing that has survived only rarely in the textualrecord. Nevertheless, we know from indirect sources that this sort ofbook was once common currency in medieval and early modernEurope. As such, a study of the Tractat de prenostication reveals someof the Catalan source texts on astrology and prognostication, a uniqueexpression of medieval syncretism, the mingling of traditions, andthe development of new ideas.xxixLUCAS_contents_v-xxxiii 8/19/03 5:07 PM Page xxix"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"xxxiACKNOWLEDGMENTSI am grateful to my parents, John and Judy Lucas, for their mostimportant gifts: language and curiosity.

In the Middle Agesthey would have burned me. Now they are con-tent with burning my books.Sigmund FreudThe Tractat de prenostication de la vida natural dels hòmens participates inthe genre “occult sciences” as practiced in the late Middle Ages andearly Renaissance. The transition from the medieval to the Renaissanceperspective, nowhere easy to define, evolved in Catalonia somewherebetween the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries.1This was a time ofcultural change, and the cover term “occult sciences” encompasses avast panorama of magic, astrology, and other forms of prognostication.To keep the Tractat de prenosticationin focus, we restrict this studyto the tools of prognostication in vogue during the time. The term“prognostication”, as defined here, includes any method of foretellingfuture events, whether to answer specific questions or provide gen-eral life predictions. Because many forms of prognostication makeuse of the supernatural, the study also considers magic, but only asit impinges on prognostication and the Tractat in question.The concept of “magic” experienced a process of redefinition andvindication during the Renaissance. In the Middle Ages, “magic” isalmost synonymous with “diabolical”; it refers primarily to those artsthat employ demons to influence the natural world by supernaturalmeans. The patristic writers include astrology with magic and cate-gorically condemn its practice. St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD)1Nadal and Prats state that the evolution from the medieval to the early modernperiod in Catalan language and literature took place between 1479 and 1520. Forthese scholars, the end of civil wars, political stabilization, and the development ofprinting mark the end of the medieval period. The coronation of Charles I (i.e.Charles V) as Holy Roman Emperor signals the beginning of the early modernperiod in Catalonia (2: 303).LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"confesses to his flirtations with astrology as a young man, an art thathe later claims true Christians should condemn (Confessiones 4.3.4).Compelled to expose astrology as superstition, Augustine devotes alarge portion of De civitate Deito refuting its claims to truth. St.Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636 AD) also leaves no room for doubt.In his Etymologiae, Isidore defines magic as a demonic art and aplague on Christian society. He states that Christians must condemnit wherever they may encounter it.2In stark contrast, scholars of the Italian Renaissance came veryclose to conflating magic and natural science so that any attempt toinfluence the natural world constituted a use of “magic”. That mem-bers of the Catholic clergy should articulate this position illustrateshow much ground the occult sciences would gain (Garin 1984: 199–201). In the sixteenth century, the Dominican Tommaso Campanella(n. 1568) argued that any act of scientific investigation constituted ause of magic. Among the achievements of magic, Campanella enu-merates the printing press and gunpowder.3Somewhere between themedieval and the Renaissance concept of magic, we find the Catalantreatise, Tractat de prenostication de la vida natural dels hòmens. The textoffers one popular system of medieval prognostication unselfcon-sciously packaged in Renaissance trappings. How this text fits intothe Catalan material and how Catalonia, in turn, fits into the widerEuropean context is the subject of this chapter.42Isidore’s encyclopedic Etymologiaedraws extensively on Classical sources and pro-vides an important reference for the state of learning in the Latin Middle Ages. Inconclusion to an lengthy passage on magi, Isidore observes the work of demons andangels of darkness: “In quibus omnibus ars daemonum est ex quadam pestiferasocietate hominum et angelorum malorum exorta. Vnde cuncta vitanda sunt aChristiano, et omni penitus execratione repudianda atque damnanda” (Etymologiae8.9.31).3The source is the Italian version of Campanella’s De Magia: “Tutto quello chesi fa dalli scienziati imitando la natura o aiutandola con l’arte ignota, no solo allaplebe bassa, ma alla communità degli uomini, si dice opera magica...L’invenzionedella polvere dell’archibugio e delle stampe fu cosa magica, e così l’uso dellacalamita . . .” (241–42).4Born at the end of the fifteenth century, the Tractat de prenosticationhelps usview the transition from the medieval to the early modern worldview. As such, ourstudy will focus on the fifteenth century and historical antecedents. For an excel-lent study of how science continued to develop in Spain during the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries, see López Piñero (1979).4 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A.Changing World ViewsThe cultural revolution of the Renaissance would have been impos-sible if the medieval period had been the barren wasteland scholarsonce imagined. As Garin notes, the first Italian humanists, of ratherhumble beginnings, self-consciously sought a renovation that beganwith their contemporaries and applied only to the previous two hun-dred years. In other words, the early humanists sought a return tothe learning of the twelfth century (Garin 1984: 60). The term “DarkAges” originally applied to the Aristotelian logic of the thirteenthand fourteenth centuries, but the notion gathered nationalistic steamand eventually became a powerful cultural myth.Cuando la inspiración religiosa y un fuerte espíritu de recuperaciónnacional entran en contacto con una reivindiación de la obra de losclásicos, la polémica cultural, todo hay que decirlo, de orígenes bas-tante limitados, se transforma en un mito de excepcional fuerza. (Garin1984: 63)It was only later and slowly that revisionist historians would imposethe concept of a thousand years of darkness (500–1500 AD) knowntoday.This notion is nowhere truer than in the prognostic and occultsciences, which never vanished entirely during the Middle Ages.Although condemned by the Medieval Church, the occult sciencescontinued to capture popular imagination from Roman times up tothe early modern period, only finally being eclipsed in the Enlighten-ment. Thorndike notes, for example, that works on geomancy wererecopied until the eighteenth century (2: 121). The system of thefour bodily humors, tinged with astrological symbolism, played a rolein medical science until well into the nineteenth century.It was traditionally believed that astrology and the prognostic artsdisappeared in the Middle Ages because access to primary sourcematerials was limited and repression from the Roman Catholic Churchsevere. However the human need to understand the natural worldand influence the course of events is universal. The arts of prog-nostication never disappeared during the Middle Ages; they just wentunderground. Although the Classical texts were missing, astrologersand magicians continued to flourish, largely through oral transmis-sion of their craft (Flint 1990: 12–16).Flint’s studies of the transmission of the occult sciences (1990;1991) help us understand the Tractat de prenosticationbecause much      5LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of her evidence for the continued practice of prognostic arts in theearly Middle Ages comes from Visigothic Spain. We have seen Isidoreof Seville’s condemnation of the non-Christian magi already (see note2). Isidore presided over several church councils, and he condemnedthe haruspices, among a long list of other types of magi. In hisEtymologiae, Isidore defines a haruspexas one how “looks to predictwhich times and days might be suitable for large undertakings” (Flint1990: 9–11).5Other citations demonstrate that the full panoply of magical artsand sciences continued to function outside the Christian Churchthroughout the medieval period. Flint demonstrates, for example,that Church authorities were aware of a number of occult sciencesand able to speak of them in the present tense (1990: 10). Furthermore,the Leges visigothorumcontains prohibitions of astrology and magic(1990: 10). Church canons and homilies also demonstrate an aware-ness and fear of practitioners of the occult sciences. We repeat hereone striking example to illustrate the point. Martin de Braga assem-bled a series of canons that typify church condemnation; the fol-lowing passage was known in the seventh century:59. Clerics may not become enchanters or make ligatures, for this isto bind down souls.71. If anyone brings diviners or lot-casters home, as is the custom ofpagans, he is to be cast out as an evildoer, and if anyone takesto magic or performs pagan lustration ceremonies, he is to dopenance for five years.74. No ceremonies or incantations are to be associated with the col-lection of medicinal herbs save for the Creed or the Lord’s Prayer,for God is the creator of all things, and he is the Lord to be wor-shipped. (Martin de Braga in Flint 1990: 13)Although we have few details of what the magi did, their existenceis documented even before the revival of the textual tradition begin-ning in the tenth and in full swing by the twelfth century.The importation of Arabic learning and Arabic translations ofGreek and Latin scholarship on a massive scale led to the first revival5Flint refers to the following passage, also taken from Isidore’s the entry on themagi: “Haruspices nuncupati, quasi horarum inspectores: dies enim et horas inagendis negotiis operibusque custodiunt, et quid per singula tempora observaredebeat homo, intendunt.

The Spanish schools inToledo and Barcelona translated works on astronomy, astrology, geo-mancy, and sympathetic magic. If Flint’s thesis is correct, however,this first renewal of occult sciences merely brought out what wasalready festering under the surface. What changes at this point,according to Flint, is the complicity of the Catholic Church (1990: 12).In the Middle Ages, most theologians believed in the occult sci-ences, but felt that magic was evil. Medieval scholasticism taughtthat individuals were subject to Divine law. Humankind’s ability toinfluence its destiny was reduced to choosing a good or evil path.Choosing to obey natural law and accepting one’s station in life werecornerstones of the medieval ethic. Divine will, never the stars, deter-mined the outcome either choice would have. Furthermore, a prop-erly contrite and repentant sinner could always see the error of hisways and choose the course of salvation.The occult arts and sciences threaten the Church in two keyrespects. The notion that the stars foretell destiny directly contradictsthe doctrine of free will. By extension, this fatalistic worldview alsodoes violence to the sacrament of penance and reformation. Moreimportant, if destiny is immutable, divine providence and humanhope are lost (Flint 1990: 2). Viewed in this light, a mage is dan-gerous demagogue who threatens established order. The CatholicChurch had much reason to fear, for these non-Christian divinersoffered a contrary means of understanding, predicting, and thereforecontrolling the natural world.At some point, however, the Church realized that terror andrepression were not the most effective methods of driving out themagicians. Faced with competing worldviews that were widely held,the Church had to begin a slow process of change or find itselfeclipsed by other non-Christian social leaders (Flint 1990: 18). TheChurch fathers must also have realized that the distinction betweenthe mysteries of the Christian faith and non-Christian magic wasoften blurry. Non-Christian mages threatened the established order,but the foundations of Christianity itself rested firmly on a belief inthe metaphysical. In this light, for example, one might consider thedoctrine of transubstantiation as a type of alchemy, and we neednot repeat here the importance of astrological observations in thecomputus tradition. Without mathematics and astronomy, the Churchcould not adjust the ecclesiastical calendar for moveable feasts.

That a change tookplace is evident; when and how is not so clear.Flint cites cases from as early as the sixth century in which theclergy began to graft Christian symbols onto the pagan forms ofprognostication. For example, one might use passages of the Bibleselected at random to decide a future course of action or substitutepaternostersfor magical spells (Flint 1990: 24–25). Some priests con-tinued to practice Christian forms of magic throughout the earlymedieval period. The use of random Biblical passages to foretell thefuture or the casting of a die after praying to God for an answer,known as sortes sanctorum, was perhaps the most common form ofprognostication (Flint 1991: 96–97).Isidore enumerated the practice among the types of magic Christiansshould avoid.6Flint’s citations of Martin de Braga demonstrate thatthe Christian Church by no means accepted thesortes as orthodox.Nevertheless, theologians probably considered Christian magic a lesserevil and were willing to tolerate it as long as it didn’t interfere withthe doctrines of free will and divine providence (Thorndike 1: 631–32).Flint makes her case with the “admirable trenchancy” she ascribesto her detractors. Non-Christian forms of divination survived becausethey found some legitimate expression in the Christian church. How-ever the argument must not be taken too far. Although the leader-ship may have overlooked Christian forms of magic, the MedievalChurch was not ready in the sixth century to co-opt the occult sci-ences altogether.Despite Christian opposition, we must remember that the castingof lots for religious purposes was accepted Hebrew practice. In theOld Testament, priests consulted God through lots. For example wefind, “The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is wholly fromthe Lord” (Prov. 16.33 RSV). A description of priestly vestmentsmentions the breastplate of judgment, a pouch containing the sacredlots Urimand Thummin(Exod. 28.15–30). Neither was the practiceunknown in the New Testament. For example we find the apostlescasting lots to choose a successor for Judas (Acts 1.26). The Christianfathers were not, however, wholly in favor of encouraging such prac-tices among their faithful.6“Sortilegi sunt qui sub nomine fictae religionis per quasdam, quas sanctorumsortesvocant, divinationis scientiam profitentur, aut quarumcumque scripturaruminspectione futura promittunt [emphasis mine]” (Etymologiae 8.9.28).LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Acceptance of Christian forms of prognostication and magic inthe Middle Ages would have to wait at least until the thirteenth cen-tury. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) addressed the problem of thesortes sanctorumin the Summa contra gentiles and Summa theologiae. Aquinasshows some sensitivity to the emerging view that Christian magiccould, in rare cases, be useful. Reflecting on the passage from Actsin which the apostles used lots, Aquinas observes that they onlyresorted to lots after fervent prayer and devotion. Aquinas hastensto warn that the practice is dangerous and should only be employedin cases of absolute necessity (Summa theologiae 2.2.95, 8). Attemptingto know the mind of God bordered on the sin of vanitas, and theuse of lots could also attract demons. St. Thomas also firmly rejectednon-Christian magic and clearly distinguished magic and lot castingfrom science.7Like Aquinas, John of Salisbury (c. 1115–80) acceptedsome use of Christian symbols in medical intervention, but he alsorejected any non-Christian magic, the interpretation of dreams, andother forms of divination.As Sezneck reminds us, Cecco d’Ascoli was burned at the stakein 1327 for calculating Christ’s birth by means of the stars (57).Furthermore, precursors to the humanists such as Petrarch (1304–74)maintained orthodox opposition to astrology. Thorndike’s survey ofexperimental science nonetheless reveals a restraint in the Church’spursuit of astrology and other sciences:Hitherto in our survey of medieval learning, more particularly of thetwelfth and thirteenth centuries, we have found little or no evidencein support of the old view, or rather assumption, that every medievalscientist was persecuted by the church. (2: 949)In this regard, Cecco d’Ascoli is an isolated case. Although theremay not have been many executions, the Catholic Church contin-ued to scrutinize astrological and other scientific writings for signsof heresy.Many astrologers needed powerful royal families to keep them outof trouble with the Holy Office. The Catalan scholar, Arnau deVilanova (c. 1238–1311), provides such a case. Vilanova served as7In the Summa theologiae, Aquinas condemns most forms of divination as the workof demons. Because of their use in the Bible, Aquinas’s position on the divine lotsis not entirely consistent with his view on other forms of divination (2.2,95).

His writings included the Libellusde improbatione maleficiorum, a treatise on how to counteract sympa-thetic magic, and a work on the Tetragrammaton, influenced by JewishCabbala. Because of his writings, Vilanova’s orthodoxy was calledinto question more than once. The Inquisition banned his booksofficially, and it was only self-abnegation and success in treating PopeBoniface VIII’s gall stone that got him removed from the Inquisition’sblack list (Thorndike 2: 844–45).Neither did the Inquisition cease to exist in the Renaissance. Someforms of magic earned acceptance as legitimate science, and theCatholic Church began to show more tolerance in the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries. However we find several cases of imprisonmentand a few notable executions as late as the seventeenth century, paceThorndike. The philosophers who laid the foundations of Renaissanceastrological magic were trained as Catholic clergy, and the Churchlater pursued many of them for their unorthodox views.Among those who fell from grace, we find such outstanding intel-lectual figures as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–94). TheInquisition chased Pico all over southern Europe on suspicion ofheresy, only to absolve him the year before his death. TommasoCampanella (1568–1639), a Dominican scholar, wrote extensivelyabout scientific magic, and those views landed him in prison. AnotherDominican, Giordano Bruno (1548?–1600), was burned at the stakefor unorthodox views bordering on polytheism. Nevertheless, exper-imentation into astrology and astrological magic proceeded steadilyduring the Renaissance and provided the framework for early mod-ern science.Before examining the vindication of the occult sciences, a wordof clarification is in order. It was once thought that the terms astrolo-gia and astronomiawere synonymous in the early Middle Ages. Wealready met St. Isidore, who included all manner of supernaturalpractitioners under the term magi. The lines of division were indeedfluid, and many authors confuse the terms. However other medievalwriters show a higher degree of sensitivity to the difference betweenthese two terms than scholars once thought. St. Isidore himself isnot consistent, but in some passages he defines astrologia and astrono-miamuch as we would today.88Flint cites Fontaine (1953) as the first to make this observation. HoweverThorndike noted Isidore’s definitions of astrology and astronomy in 1923 (1: 632).LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"      11In the Etymologiae, Isidore uses the term mathesisfor astrology, andin one passage he condemns the science outright. He states that,blinded by the beauty of the stars, some have mistakenly concludedthat they can predict the future from calculations based on the move-ment of the planets. According to Isidore, both Christian and paganscholars condemned such superstition.9However in other passages,Isidore makes a subtle distinction between the terms astronomyandastrology.Isidore notes that astronomy deals only with the movement of theheavenly bodies. By contrast, astrology is partly natural (i.e. scientific)and partly superstitious. It is a natural science when it observes theconstellations and their position in the heavens, and it is damnablesuperstition when it attempts to predict the nature of men’s soulsand their destinies.10Isidore is not the first to make such a distinc-tion; his use of the term mathesisto refer to astrology comes frommuch older astrological sources.Julius Firmicus Maternus composed his Mathesis(c. 354) on thesubject, and the treatise remains one of the few complete ancienttexts on astrology. Although the work is not cited until the twelfthcentury, Isidore obliquely refers to it. According to Tester, the titlederives from the Greek mãyhsiw‘learning’, which originally referredto the sciences of the quadrivium, particularly mathematics (134).Later the term applies strictly to astrology (in both senses). By thetwelfth century, scholars had established a distinction between mathè-sis, with a long mid vowel and máth^siswith a short vowel. The firstrepresents true learning; the second is infused with superstition. We9The passage glossed follows: “Sed nonnulli siderum pulcritudine et claritateperlecti in lapsus stellarum caecatis mentibus conruerunt, ita ut per subputationesnoxias, quae mathesisdicitur, eventus rerum praescrire posse conentur: quos nonsolum Christianae religionis doctores, sed etiam gentilium Plato, Aristoteles, atquealii rerum veritate conmoti concordi sententia damnaverunt, dicentes confusionemrerum potius de tali persuasione generari [emphasis mine]” (Etymologiae3.71.39).10Compare the following passage to Isidore’s blanket condemnation cited in notes2 and 4: “1.

Astronomy represents themathematical and theoretical branch of the science. Astrology, in itsdifferent forms, is an applied science used to make general or specificlife predictions. We will meet this distinction again when we exam-ine judicial and natal astrology in the next chapter. This evidencesuggests that, at least in some respects, medieval scholars were awarethat scientific astrology was a useful activity and did not necessarilyinvolve heretical superstition.Aquinas was bold enough to tread a bit farther in his acceptanceof astrology. He licenses the science as a means of observation ofthe natural world to search for causes and effects. Aquinas even goesso far as to assert that the stars do have some effect on the naturalworld. Given humankind’s earthly passions and its connection to thephysical world, it seems logical to assume that men and women arealso subject to astral influences. Careful to avoid heresy, Aquinashastens to note that free will allows humankind to avoid followingits baser desires:The majority of men follow their passions, which are movements ofthe sensitive appetite, in which movements of the heavenly bodies canco-operate; but few are wise enough to resist these passions. Consequentlyastrologers are able to foretell the truth in the majority of cases, espe-cially in a general way. But not in particular cases; for nothing pre-vents man resisting his passions by his free-will.

Kenny elaborates on the will in St. Thomas’s system:On the one hand, it is a capacity for certain kinds of wanting (forlong-term and universal goals that only humans can have, such as thediscovery of scientific truth or the pursuit of riches). On the otherhand, it is a capacity for action of a certain kind, namely free andvoluntary action; only those who have free will are capable of freeaction. (81)Renaissance scholars will follow Aquinas to the letter on this point,always careful to respect the freedom of individual choice.So far, we have considered the most recent scholarship on thetransmission of the occult sciences through the Middle Ages and the reception they find in the Roman Catholic Church. Most of theresearch centers specifically on astrology and, by extension, on magic.We also saw that “scientific” astrology (i.e. mathèsis) was acceptableto the medieval Christian Church in limited doses and whenever itdid not conflict with theological doctrine. What of the other occultsciences: “bad astrology” (i.e. máth^sis), astro-numerology, geomancy,lot casting, etc.?When and if the medieval Church adopted the other occult sci-ences—as Flint seems to suggest—is a question that requires muchmore philological spadework. The Church may have been willing tooverlook some forms of Christian magic as we observed, but noneof the medieval sources equate magic with science as we find in theRenaissance. Neither does magic or prognostic astrology appear inthe school curricula. Grant surveyed the educational programs ofmedieval universities and cathedral schools.13He observed that astrol-ogy was taught only as a branch of astronomy and primarily in themedical faculties. Of other forms of prognostication he notes:Whatever their significance for the history of science, magic, astrology(especially as it pertained to human fate and fortune), alchemy, andother occult sciences were not officially taught in the natural philosophy13Grant (1996) is a significantly revised and expanded version of his originalanalysis (1974).      13LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"curriculum of medieval universities, although this tells us little aboutthe extent to which individual masters and students may have pursuedthese activities privately. (1996: 137)In Barcelona, the textual record begins in the sixteenth century, butit seems to corroborate Grant’s findings for earlier periods. In 1559,the charter for the Estudi General stipulates that mathematics mightbe taught under arts and letters, time permitting. There was a chairfor mathematics at least from 1576; and in 1598 the record indi-cates that some astronomical material was included in mathematicalstudies. The textual record never mentions prognostic astrology (PeñaDíaz 492).The evidence presented so far admits some preliminary conclu-sions. The various genres of prognosticaflourished in the Middle Agesnot only because they were illicit, and so intriguing. Neither werethe prognostic arts merely subversive tools for the fringe elements ofsociety, for they had many practical applications. Prognosticationhelped kings predict future events, doctors choose the propitiousmoment for medical intervention, generals determine the outcomeof a battle, and farmers obtain the best crop yield. As such, theywere a continuation of pre-Christian forms of divination and magic,and these practices survived outside the Church in the Middle Ages.As Flint observes, the prognostic arts may have survived becausethey were practiced outside the Church—that is underground andlargely out of its reach (1990: 24).The occult sciences offered an alternative manner for humankindto control its fate. The early Christian Church was unrelenting inits pursuit of all forms of science that threatened the establishedorder. At some point, the seeds of tolerance began to sprout. TheChurch became less hostile to the more scientific forms of astrology,realizing it had much to gain by incorporating it into official doc-trines. By adopting some early pagan forms of magic and divina-tion, such as the sortes sanctorum, the Catholic Church cut the grassfrom beneath the feet of these alternative spiritual leaders. In sodoing, the Catholic Church kept much of this magic alive. The soilwould remain ever fertile, and Renaissance scholars would till thefields intensely during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.The humanistic project in the Italian Renaissance jettisoned Aris-totelianism and Thomism in favor of Neoplatonism and a reverencefor old classics newly discovered. This renovatio of arts and lettersbrought with it a revalorization of prognostic and occult sciences as14 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"expressed in classical sources. The discovery of the Neoplatonic andHermetic corpus provided a mine, rich with magical and astrologi-cal references. Marsilio Ficino (1433–99) made these Greek writingsaccessible in Latin and began to explore connections between Platonismand Christianity in Theologica platonica, which he published in 1482.Around the same time, the idea of experimentation upon the nat-ural world also became popular. Neoplatonism and scientific exper-imentation brought science and magic together as complementaryforces. A brief mention of both is necessary to understand the intel-lectual climate in which the Tracat de prenosticationwas born. Thesetwo trends redeemed the practitioner of occult science, the mage:“magus significat hominem sapientem cum virtute agendi” (Brunocit. in Garin 1981: 200–01). The Tractatreminds us of the pseudo-Ptolemaic adage that the wise man will rule the stars (fol. 12r).During the fifteenth century, around the time the Tractat de prenos-tication was published, Italian scholars, such as Marsilio Ficino, werecrafting Neoplatonic treatises on the magic arts. In Ficino’s works,one detects a concern to separate “true” magic from “false” super-stition. Ficino was one of magic’s most ardent spokespersons. Howevereven Ficino wavered on some aspects of magic. In the Disputatio contraiudicium astrologorum(1477), Ficino partially retracted the views of hisyouth, although many scholars take the third book of his De vita(1489), in which he defends astrology, as Ficino’s final word on thematter.Ficino is one of the most important authors because his worksembody the philosophical revolutions that were taking place in thefifteenth century. In De vita, one finds Neoplatonic realism fused withscientific experimentation. When Ficino describes medical proceduresand other scientific applications of astrology, he anticipates Campanellaand Bacon (Kaske and Clark in Ficino 1989: 58). For example,Ficino writes at length on the subject of astrological talismans.An astrological talisman is a piece of metal or stone chosen forits ability to attract the influences of a specific planet. The mageinscribes words, prayers, and other symbols related to one of theplanets upon the talisman to strengthen the effect. In Ficino, theword is the thing, for any operation performed upon a talisman isby extension applied to the star and vice versa(Kaske and Clark inFicino 1989: 38). For Ficino, it is the sympathy between the mate-rial used in constructing the talisman and the planet in question thatproduces the effect, not any magical words or symbols:      15LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":". . . [ T ]he making of figures has no efficacy except in cases where itis similar in material and effect to some star from which the makerwants to receive this effect; and, in addition, where the material itselfis already from the beginning of almost such a quality as you desireto render it through the figure.14The significance of this doctrine to our Tractat de prenosticationlies inits application to numbers. Although Ficino does not dwell upon thematter, he suggests that other qualities (besides the four elements)such as colors, numbers, figures, etc. are also powerful ways to obtaincelestial influence. To avoid suspicion of unorthodoxy, Ficino resortsto hedges like ut putant‘so they think’.15Ficino believes astrological magic is most acceptable for medicalpurposes. Thus magic gets smuggled into the universities dressed inscientific trappings. Ficino does not deal with the subject; howeverother philosophers treat natal astrology as a form of science. Kieckhefernotes cases in which Renaissance scientists cast horoscopes and testedtheir validity by observing the subjects over time (129). This con-trasts with the Aristotelian view of science, popular in the MiddleAges, which favored enumeration and categorization of concepts overactual experimentation. The interest in experimentation is necessarybefore magic can be vindicated:Thus, the Renaissance saw no contradiction between astrology and sci-ence; rather, the dominion of the heavenly bodies over all earthlythings was viewed by some as the natural law par excellence, the lawwhich assures the regularity of phenomena. (Seznec 59)When it first came into vogue, the experimental method encom-passed both physical and the occult sciences. The connection betweenthe natural world and humankind had previously been a one-waystreet. Humankind merely experienced the power of the stars ordivine will. However the Latin term experior, like its Romance descen-14Kaske and Clark’s translation of: “. . . ut fabrica figurarum non alibi efficaciamhabeat, quam ubi materia cum stella congruit et effectu, a qua hunc faber exop-tat accipere; ac praeterea ubi haec ipsa materia quasi iam talis est ab initio, qualemaffectas reddere per figuram” (De vita 3.17.104–109).15“Qualitates autem quae minus elementares materialesve sunt, scilicet lumina,id est colores, numeros quoque similiter et figuras ad talia forsitan minus posse, sedad coelestia munera (ut putant) valere permultum . . .

Not content to passively experience the effectsof the stars, the Renaissance mage inverted the lines of influence.Through experimentation, the mage could control the stars and shapehis destiny.The Tractat de prenosticationdistills this idea into the proverb: “lohome savi senyoragarà los astres” (fol. 12r). Often found in Latin as“homo sapiens dominabitur astris,” the proverb illustrates the powerof humankind to assert its will over the natural world, a positionthat cannot possibly conflict with Church doctrine (Tester 176–177;Coopland 175–177). Once the link between magic and natural sci-ence was forged, Renaissance theologians were able to drive thedemons out of magic or simply co-opt them. The Neoplatonists, suchas Ficino, used the Greek spellingdaemonto indicate a philosophi-cally neutral use of the term. In Neoplatonic philosophy, a daemonis any lesser spiritual force and is often best translated as “genius”or, in some cases, “angel”. This distinguishes Neoplatonic daemonsfrom the demonsinvolved in black magic.Most Renaissance scholars privileged the distinction between goodand bad magic just as Isidore had distinguished between good andbad astrology. Schumaker discerns two types of acceptable magic:natural magic and spiritual magic. Natural magic, also called whitemagic, offers an appropriate means of scrutinizing the world for signsfrom God and manipulating them to one’s advantage. It makes noappeal to spiritual forces, amulets, or incantations; rather it seeksmagical results from the properties of simples (such as roots, herbs,metals, etc.) or some combination thereof. Natural magic in this senseprefigures natural science. At the other extreme, we find acceptableforms of spiritual magic, which appeals to divine intervention forassistance: signs, numbers, astrological figures, etc. (Schumaker 108–9).As we observed, Ficino accepted the properties of the simples althoughhe was skeptical about the efficacy of the figures themselves.The astro-numerological system contained in the first section ofthe Tractat de prenosticationleans towards the spiritual or ceremonialend of this continuum. The prevalence for magical numbers is cer-tainly a feature of ceremonial magic, as are the references to thesaints and their intervention in the horoscopes. However the secondsection of our Catalan treatise anticipates the scientific vein of magic.The insistence in part two that astrology is theologically sound restson the scientific principle that inferior things are subject to superior      17LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"things. In this sense, God directs the stars, which transmit His influ-ences to earthly beings. Schumaker traces this principle back to Neo-platonic philosophy, and it would become the touchstone of magicaltreatises such as Campanella’s De Magia(1489) and Della Porta’sMagiae naturalis libri viginti(1589) (109–12).The other type of ceremonial magic we find, known as blackmagic, invokes the power of demons or pagan gods. This practicewas still—officially at least—anathema (Garin 1981: 206). In theLatin manuscripts of Campanella’s De magia, a short chapter on blackmagic explains that the use of amulets or ceremonies to invoke thepower of demons should never be taught. Campanella notes thatdemonic magic is not a part of true science and should be eradi-cated, lest it lead the naïve astray.16Even here, however, Campanellademonstrates some rhetorical if not critical distance with such phrasesas “we feel” and “in our opinion”. St. Augustine and St. Isidore weremore resolute in the matter. Thus did the Renaissance scholars makethe magic arts, particularly prognostication, part of acceptable science.However they perpetuated the medieval worldview in two ways. TheRenaissance scholars still believed in the power of demons and cau-tioned against their use in magic.These broad textual outlines incorporate the most recent scholar-ship on the matter and, as such, provide a context for the Tractatde prenostication, which was printed at the end of the fifteenth cen-tury. The method of prognostication underlying the Tractatbelongsamong the most superstitious forms of astrological magic available.The system is traceable into the early Middle Ages, although thesimple numerological symbolism represents a continuation of pre-Roman forms of prognostication. Certain features of the text, whichwe will examine in the next chapter, demonstrate the Arabic influence16Campanella’s vindication of magic has its limits. Compare his passage ondemonic magic to St. Isidore’s view: “Magiam Diabolicam [sic] non esse docen-dam sentimus. Est enim palam aemulatrix divinae et cultum illius imitatur; sedrevera, in naturali, suas operationes fundant daemones. At saepe iubent constella-tiones observare et caeremonias: quae ad rem non conferunt, sed ut sibi cultumarroget, aut quia eo tempore novit rem perfici iuvante coelo, quod ipse per se nonpotest; aut qui divinissimas Dei creaturas operibus suis sordidis in nostra opinionelabefactare studet, et impietatem suggerere passim et scientiarum abominationem,ut ignorantia crescente sapientiam ab hominibus eradicet, et suas falsitates per-suadeat...” (De Magia, 241). This chapter appears only in the Latin versions of Demagia, and the author may have added it deliberately as an apology.18 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"that was particularly important in the Iberian Peninsula after theeleventh century.The apology in the second section of the Tractatprovides a justi-fication for astrology and extends this to the prognostic apparatusin the first section. In so doing, the Tractatrepresents the Renaissanceworldview outlined here. Although the text never uses the word“magic” per se, it refers to several forms of talismanic magic and ad-vises that it may be useful to help avert negative omens in the stars.Furthermore, the treatise subverts patristic sources that condemnsuperstition and uses them to provide theological justification for itspractice. In this manner, the Tractat de prenosticationis a powerful tex-tual witness to the non-Christian forms of future-telling and Christianattempts to reframe them at the dawn of the Renaissance.B.The Catalan ContextThe Tractat de prenosticationis one of few Catalan incunables on thesubject of prognostication. It is the only witness of astro-numero-logical prognostication in the Iberian Peninsula before 1500.17Whatsurvives in the textual record is always partially a product of chance.In the case of Catalonia, however, four factors condition the pro-duction of scientific and prognostic literature in the fifteenth cen-tury. A general decline in scientific production is the result of externalpolitical and economic conditions. Texts on prognostication like theTractatare simple in style and of a popular character. This sort oftext does not survive well because later generations did not valuethis form of prognostication. As Peña Díaz observes, popular texts17Some readers may wonder whether Arnau de Vilanova was a precursor forthe Tractat. Vilanova studied Hebrew and Arabic, producing a work on the namesof God, the Tetragrammaton, in the fourteenth century. Arnau was familiar with JewishCabbala and other forms of prognostication, which infuse his theological writings.However, Vilanova’s condemnation of magic in the Libellus de improbatione maleficiorumfollows the patristic and medieval tradition to the letter. He wavers on the Christianuse of magic. In De parte operativa, Vilanova contends that astrology is a dangerousform of magic, but he does accept the influence of the stars on humankind (Thorndike2: 850–61). Our Tractatemerges from different and independent textual traditions,largely Arabic (see chapter 3, section E) and remains the only practical prognosticdevice extant. Nevertheless, in his understanding of the experimental method asapplied to medicine and his tentative acceptance of Christian magic, Vilanova canbe seen as an important precursor for experimental and magic sciences in Catalonia.      19LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"are often omitted from wills and other documents that might recordtheir possession (501–02). The influence of Renaissance humanism,present with the first translation of Petrarch in 1388, arrives late andnever fully blossoms on the Catalan mainland. Finally, we observea dependence on Jewish and Arabic scholarship in most Catalanscientific production of the period.The court of Pere III (1335–1387) represents a period of pros-perity in Catalan commerce, arts, and letters. At this time, Catalanastronomy ranked among the best in the Iberian Peninsula. The firstautochthonous works date from the fourteenth century, althoughCatalan science still relied heavily on Arabic translations (Vernet1989: 203). Much of the Catalan production served the blossomingmaritime trade and exploration industry. The Balearic Islands werehome to several notable maritime cartographers. Angelino Dulcertproduced the first dated maritime atlas in Mallorca (1339). Anotherimportant atlas (1375) is attributed to Abraham Cresques, a MallorcanJew. Guillem Soler’s atlases (c. 1389 and 1385) also deserve a mention(Samsó 1989: 195–96). Under Pere III, Catalan-Aragonese mathe-matics, science, and astronomy slowly eclipsed Castilian science. Withthe death of Alfonso X in 1284, Castilian science fell into its owndecline.Ramón Llull (c. 1233–1315) is the most outstanding Catalan fromthe fourteenth century, and his works touch upon virtually all aspectsof literary and scientific production. He is most famous for his “art”,a mathematical device that generates philosophical arguments, whichLlull developed to aid missionaries in their evangelical work. TheIlluminated Doctor, as he was known after a visionary experience,also applied his art to medicine. His medical machine made use ofthe four humors and stock physiognomy from the Greek and Arabictraditions. By turning the wheels to the proper symptoms, one couldcompute a simple diagnosis and select appropriate remedies. Llullalso made important discoveries in navigation and astronomy; hemay have been the first in the Iberian Peninsula to discuss how touse the nocturnolabe to navigate at night (Riera i Tuèbols 67–69).Vernet cautions, however, that Catalan science of the period wasstill in its infancy. He notes that the astronomical tables Pere IIIhad commissioned from Gilbert and Çes Planes in 1360 were lesssuccessful than the Alfonsine tables, even though they were trans-lated into Latin and Hebrew. The authors introduced too manysimplifications, thereby rendering their tables virtually useless (1998:20 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"79–80). Vernet also observes that, although Ramon Llull was clearlyan outstanding intellectual, he was also a bit of a dilettante and didnot necessarily demonstrate true mastery over many of the subjectshe treated in his lifetime (1998: 80–81).Although much of the scientific research into astronomy and astrol-ogy is practical in nature, some works began to show sensitivity toprognostication and alchemy in the court of Pere III. Under thereign of his son Joan I (1387–1396), astronomical work yielded to agrowing interest in popular astrology (Vela Palomares 1997: 186).We have already met Arnau de Vilanova, who conducted experimentson chemistry and alchemy. His flirtations with astrology got him intotrouble with the Inquisition. Unlike Vilanova, Bartomeu de Tresbénsand other court astrologers managed to avoid suspicion of heresy.Tresbéns wrote the Tractat d’astrologia, which explains the fundamentalsof astronomy and includes a long treatise on judicial astrology.Tresbéns worked as court physician to Pere III (1361–74). Although hiswork predates the Renaissance, his acceptance of astrology as longas it does not impede free will makes him a precursor to later workson the topic. His Tractat d’astrologia follows the Alfonsine El libro con-plido de los iudizios de las estrellas, itself a translation of the original byAlìibn abìRi#àl (Ali Abenragel) (Vernet 1989: 80). The work is,therefore, a testament to the continuing influence of Arabic astrol-ogy with its complex division of the zodiac into smaller and smallerparts and its use of the lots (Vernet and Romano in Tresbéns 11).18The sixteenth century is traditionally known as the decadènciainCatalan; however the antecedents are present at the opening of thefifteenth century. In 1410, Martí I of Aragon died without naminga successor, setting offa two-year dynastic conflict. With the Com-promise of Casp in 1412, the Catalan-Aragonese Crown came underthe Castilian Trastámara dynasty, marking the beginning of slow andsteady decline. Ferran III of Aragon and Isabelle of Castile marriedin 1469, unifying the two largest peninsular monarchies. Catalaninfluence in political affairs waned markedly afterwards, and Castilianeventually replaced Catalan as the language of the court.18The term “lot”, in this sense, refers to a specific point plotted onto an astro-logical chart with the aid of a complex mathematical formula. The effect of thelots depended upon which house of the zodiac they landed in. One of the mostimportant, the “lot of fortune”, was widely used in Western European astrology.      21LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The early printers found it profitable to publish in Castilian becausethey could sell their books more easily outside of Catalonia or tradethem for works that they were not able, usually for financial rea-sons, to publish themselves. However Castilian was not the only lan-guage competing with Catalan. Nobles and clergy had acquired ataste for books in Italian and Latin. Peña Díaz found that Latin wasthe predominant language of publication in Barcelona throughoutthe sixteenth century, except for the period from 1530–1559, whenCatalan overshadowed the Latin classics (70). Nevertheless Castilianmade slow but steady inroads in the Catalan publishing industry.Catalonia also was slow to recover from the devastating effects ofthe plague, evident throughout Europe, and a bloody civil war underJoan II (1463–1472). As a result of that war, the King of Aragonlost the counties of Rosselló and Cerdanya to France (1475), regionsthat are still known as Catalunya Nordto nationalists today. War anddisease took their toll on the population; by some estimates, thePrincipality was home to some 500,000 inhabitants in 1300 and only225,000 in 1497 (Riera i Truèbols 83). Against this generally nega-tive backdrop and despite evidence of decline, Renaissance humanismbegan to flourish.The fifteenth century witnessed the last flowering of Catalan let-ters. Bernat Metge translated Petrarch’s Griseldis (1388), marking thefirst influences of Italian humanism in Catalan letters. With Tirantlo Blancand Curial e Güelfa, Catalan romance foreshadowed the devel-opment of the modern novel. The effects of humanism were slowto bear fruit, however, and not fully manifest in the Catalan lan-guage until the end of the fifteenth century (Nadal i Prats 2: 392;Rubió i Balaguer 1964: 18–19). The effects of humanism are mostnotable in the Catalan court at Naples.Once crowned, Ferran I undertook to extend the Catalan Empirein the Mediterranean. Although he ruthlessly brought Sicily undercontrol, Ferran never lived to complete the conquest of Naples. AlfonsI “the Magnanimous” completed the project in 1442, and he neverreturned to his possessions on the Iberian Peninsula. The influencesof Italian humanism are much deeper on the literature that emergedfrom his court, but scholars do not agree on the degree to whichthis influence is felt in peninsular Catalan literature (Nadal and Prats2: 55–56). In terms of prognostic material, however, the humanisticinfluences are not as evident in Catalan literature of the mainland.The revalorization of magic, so much a part of the Italian22 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Renaissance, is largely missing in the Catalan literary tradition. Thereare no autochthonous treatises on natural magic or prognosticationto rival Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, or Campanella. Culturally, thereis evidence for growing interest in and acceptance of the magic arts,particularly alchemy, at a popular level. The proliferation of litera-ture on astrological magic is one example of this influence. GirolamoTorrella19published a treatise on astrological images in Valencia(1496) with a dedication to Ferran II (1452–1516), King of Aragon.Torrella studied in Montpellier and in Italy. He described him-self as a physician to the queen of Naples. Torrella planned to repu-diate Pico della Mirandola for his critique of astrology, although heappears never to have finished the project. Sometimes Torrella seemscritical of astrological images, but Thorndike notes a “sneaking pref-erence” for them (4: 574–75). Such images belong to talismanicmagic that Ficino studied in his De Vita. In section two of our Tractatde prenostication, we are told that images and signs may help avert thenegative influences of the stars, a reference to this same tradition.Miracle literature, such as the Viatge d’en Ramón Perellós al purgato-rio de San Patrici, is another popular expression of the interest inChristian forms of magic. The Viatge, a hagiographic work set intype in 1486, is bound together with other religious visionary andpious works. Similarities in the typeface and composition suggest thatthe same printer may have published theTractat de prenostication (Seechapter 3, section E). The Viatge d’en Ramón Perellósis a Catalanexpression of the legend of Saint Patrick. Saint Patrick obtained per-mission from God to create a hole in the desert leading directly topurgatory so non-believers could experience the truth of religiousdoctrine. The protagonist in the Catalan version was a knight fromRosselló who served under Joan I and may have undertaken sucha quest (Miquel y Planas 1917, 1: 232).Another popular tradition developed in the fifteenth century, thatof the lunarisand almanacs. Dealing neither with astrology nor magicper se, these popular works bring together bits and pieces of bothgenres. The lunar calendar was used, in the computustradition, to setthe dates of moveable feasts and mark syzygies, new and full moons.Often these lunar charts are incorporated into larger almanacs, repletewith popular wisdom. The lunariswere born as scientific texts but19Known as Gironi or Geroni in Catalan and Girolamo in Italian.      23LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"developed into popular or folkloric collections with the incorpora-tion of practical advice and illustrative woodcuts (Rubió i Balaguer1993: 430). They also bear witness to the influence of Arabic sci-ence in the Peninsula (Samsó 1981).Easy to cobble together from a variety of extant sources, thesepopular books were an important source of income for the earlyprinters and booksellers in Barcelona. Peña Díaz studied the pos-session of lunarisin the city by examining wills and other invento-ries. He found evidence that most of the early Catalan booksellerstraded in them and that they increased in popularity until about theend of the sixteenth century (501). Until 1550, the clergy and noblespossessed approximately 32.5% each of the lunarisregistered. By1600, the clergy and the artisans accounted for 28,5% each of thelunarisrecorded (Peña Díaz 502).The most important of these was Granollach’sLunari, first printedin 1485 (Chabás and Roca 124). Granollach’s tables of lunar datarank among the top ten best sellers of astrological literature, withover forty-two incunable editions (Chabás and Roca 125). Li incor-porated Granollach’s lunar charts into his larger Reportorio de los tiempos,recently edited by Laura Delbrugge (1996; 1999). Most scholarsassume Li was Aragonese; however a possible 1488 version of theReportorioin Catalan may suggest a Catalan origin for Li as well(Delbrugge in Li 1999: 18).Although it was probably never published, a fragmentary astro-logical miscellany preserved in Andorra constitutes one of the firstdocumented attempts to summarize astrological knowledge in Catalan.A paleographic analysis of the manuscript, dubbed Tencar, revealsthe humanistic influence on writing, which is first evident in thecourt of Pere III. This fact helps scholars to date the work around1430–1440 (Vela Palomares 1997: 28). A look at contents and prob-able source materials helps understand the range of texts availableat the time our Tractat de prenosticationwas printed.The Tencarcollection brings together summaries and commentarieson a selection of Arabic, Greek, and Latin source material. Althoughthe text does not include direct translations of original sources (exceptfor selections from the Tractat de Bahare), it demonstrates that a greaterrange of primary source material was absorbed into Catalan schol-arship than the textural record previously indicated. The first partof the work draws on the Picatrix, a work on astrological melothesiaand talismanic magic of Arabic origin. The title, Picatrix, is probably24 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"a corruption of Hippocrates, but the work is a translation of theArabic Ghàyat al-Hakìm(Ed. Pingree 1986). Under the court of AlfonsoX of Castile, Yehuda ben Moshe translated the Latin version of thePicatrixinto Spanish and added his commentary. The Vela Palomaresedition provides evidence that there was a Catalan version of Picatrix,now lost. Although the compiler of Tencardoes not name Picatrixasa source, he follows the Latin version closely. Like the Jewish trans-lator of the Spanish version, the editor of Tencaralso added his owncommentary (Vela Palomares 1997: 113).This miscellany also includes fragments from De prognosticationibusegrentudinum secundum motum lune, a pseudo-Hippocratic medical trea-tise that relates the signs of the zodiac to parts of the body overwhich they exercised their power. The third section of the Tencarmanuscript draws on the Alfonsine Libro conplido en los iudizios de lasestrellas, a translation made of Abraham ibn Ezra’s work on judicialastrology (Vela Palomares 1997: 155). The last section of this manu-script includes a translation from the Tractat de Bahare, also a workon lunar astronomy (Vela Palomares 1997: 188–191). Our Tractat deprenosticationdraws broadly on this same textual tradition, particularlyin terms of Arabic source material (see Chapter 2).The panorama outlined here reveals how Catalonia participatedin the humanistic revalorization of the prognostic arts during theItalian Renaissance. The Catalan court in Naples is the most impor-tant vehicle for these changes, although humanistic influence is feltmostly in poetry and early romance. The influence of magic is lessevident, particularly in mainland Catalan literature. We do find someexamples of magic, particularly astrological magic, from Arabic sources.The materials available are largely of a popular nature, with the ex-ception of the Arabic material in the Andorran Tencarand the judi-cial astrology of a few court astrologers such as Tresbéns. Thecontinued influence of Arabic sources reflects an older medieval trend.By contrast, Renaissance astrologers in Italy began to favor Greekmodels of astrology and abandon “foreign” sources from the Arabicand Jewish traditions (Vernet and Romano 10).The Tractat de prenosticationis an important expression of the con-tinuation of medieval trends. The astro-numerological apparatus,although by no means unique in Western Europe, is the only Catalanwitness of this tradition. The text draws on sources similar to thosefound in the astrological miscellany from Andorra, particularly in itsuse of Arabic source materials. The simple style, with some humanistic      25LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"flourishes added for stylistic effect, is also a reflection on the stateof the prognostic arts in late fifteenth century Catalonia.The textual evidence available suggests that prognostication flourishedin Catalonia much as it did in the rest of Renaissance Europe,although the humanistic influences run less deep. The effect is thatthe genres of a more popular character, such as the lunaris, almanacs,and miscellaneous treatises, such as the Tractat de prenostication, weremore prevalent than learned works. In the next section, we willexamine minor manuscripts that treat a number of superstitious formsof prognostication and provide further evidence that the magical andprognostic arts were more common in the Catalan tradition thanscholars once assumed.C.Catalan Material in Relationship to other European TraditionsLate medieval and Renaissance prognostic material draws on manyrelics from the ancient Greco-Roman past. Likewise much of theClassical Greek and Roman corpus had been lost and was redis-covered through contact with eastern traditions. Often the ideas ofprognostication stem directly from Jewish or Arabic sources or havebeen filtered through them. Some important scholarship has beendone on lines of transmission, but much more work remains (Flint1990; 1991).We have studied the impact of Italian humanism on the Catalanprognostic and magical traditions in the fifteenth century, which con-tinued to draw heavily on Arabic and Jewish sources. By contrast,the Italian humanists preferred Greek models of astrology. The relativepaucity of original prognostic material in Catalonia probably doesnot indicate that prognostic astrology and magic were not practiced.Rather it reflects external political and economic factors as wellas the continued reliance on Arabic and Jewish models. The prolifera-tion of Granollach’s Lunari, Li’s Reportorio de los tiempos, and the exis-tence of the Tractat de prenosticationthoroughly demonstrate an interestin popular magic. The importance of court astrologers and astrologicalphysicians such as Tresbéns and Vilanova demonstrate that the upperechelons of Catalan nobility were also interested in prognostication.Thorndike’s massive History of Magic and Experimental Science(1923–58)remains the most important source for prognostic sciences. Thorndikehad access to a number of Western European manuscripts and incun-26 LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ables, many of which have not yet been edited or studied in theirentirety. Without such text-critical spadework, it is impossible to eval-uate the quantity or quality of the material. Too superstitious forhistorians of science and too scientific for literary scholars, one getsthe impression that the prognostic corpus—slim though it may be—has slipped through the cracks. The Alfonsine translations of Arabicastronomy have been amply studied; the bibliography is too exten-sive to repeat here. Eugene Garin devoted a lifetime of professionalscholarship largely to the development of magic, astrology, and prog-nostication in the Italian tradition (e.g. compilations in 1981; 1983;1984). However works of a popular and prognostic nature don’t re-ceive the same treatment, particularly not in the Spanish and Frenchtraditions.Laurel Means’s study of Middle English prognostic material is onenotable exception and is the only recent study of this genre. Meansexamined most of the English material from the fourteenth to thesixteenth centuries and developed a categorization scheme. Her fourcategories, “electionary”, “lunary”, “destinary”, and “questionary”are a useful tool for approaching the material (367). Means’s exam-ination of the material encompasses primarily different forms of prog-nostication based on some form of astrology, and the material isextensive. Her categories will be evaluated and placed in context inthe next chapter.Means points out several important problems that scholars musttackle when sorting out prognostic material. The Latin titles maynot accurately reflect the contents of the work in question. Furthermore,since the interest in astrology and magic was deeply absorbed intopopular culture, astrological or magical references may be indis-criminately added to works in other genres (particularly in the naturalsciences, but also in literature). Often shorter works are bound togetherin collections that may not contain accurate indices (369).We observed that the most popular works are often reprintedunder different titles or incorporated into larger works without refer-ence. Andrés de Li’s use of Granollach’s Lunariis not the only instanceof this.Chabás and Roca demonstrated that Granollach’s lunar datais based upon a mathematical model developed by Bonjorn, a Jewishastronomer who was born in Girona in 1333 (128). Means providesmany examples of this sort of syncretism in the English tradition.The first step towards improving this situation is to make the mate-rial available in critical editions and accessible to a wide audience.      27LUCAS_f2_1-30 8/19/03 10:00 AM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Only then can scholars begin to see exactly what material is avail-able and what relationships exist among the various genres anddifferent linguistic and cultural traditions.

The Tractat de prenosticationand otherCatalan materials under consideration fall roughly within the sameperiod, the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. As this study rep-resents the most recent attempt to frame astrologically-based prog-nostication, we will examine, evaluate, and suggest improvementshere. Although her categories are useful tools for exploring connec-tions among different methods of prognostication, Means’s system isnot wholly applicable to the Catalan corpus because it encompassesonly astrology and fails to include prognostication by other methods.A.Astrology and Astrological MagicIn chapter one, we observed that medieval authors often conflatedthe terms astrology and astronomy, although evidence suggests St.Isidore showed a greater sensitivity to this division than scholars hadpreviously acknowledged. In this section, we exclusively treat astrol-ogy of the prognostic variety: that is astrology as a study of the con-stellations, the planets, their movements through the heavens andthe influence of these on the sublunary world.2Means’s four categories of astrological prognostication expand uponEade’s bipartite division into “judicial” and “natal” astrology (1984).Natal astrology, also called “genethliacal” astrology, sought to pre-dict the general outlines of a person’s life based upon the positionof the stars at the moment of birth or conception. This type of astrol-ogy is closely related to natural philosophy, with its concern for thelaws of nature that governed human events (Curry 8). Natal astrol-ogy is the most scientific variety, and one needs a fairly complexunderstanding of astronomy as well as a good manual for inter-preting the heavens to cast a horoscope. Ptolemy is careful to sub-divide natal astrology further into “general” and “specific” (Tetrabiblos1.3). According to Ptolemy, some astrological influences impact wholecountries or races, while others affect only the individual.2The reader may wonder why we do not simply state that astrology treats theinfluence of the stars on humankind. I cannot resist repeating Tester’s felicitous ref-erence to Morin who, in the sixteenth century, writes of the “state of the heavenscirca nascentem hunc hominem vel equum, around this man at his birth, or this horse” (239).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"       33Means calls natal or genethliacal astrology the “destinary” anddefines it as “a horoscope; a group of prognostications based upon[the] time of birth” (386). In natal astrology, the heavens are dividedinto twelve equal parts, no doubt influenced by the twelve constel-lations or signs of the zodiac. The zodiac is the zone about 8 ½degrees on either side of the ecliptic through which the sun, moon,and planets travel (in a geocentric universe). The signs of the zodiacmove through these fixed houses or resting-places. As Tester observes,“The twelve mundane houses, then, are a sort of fixed frameworkwithin which the zodiac revolves, in a clockwise direction” (27). Inancient times, this map of the heavens was represented not as a cir-cle but as a square:Each of the houses was associated with a different sphere of life,and the label of each varies according to which astrological modelone happens to follow. The point of departure for casting a horo-scope is the ascendant: “This relationship of the zodiac to the cir-cle of the houses was fixed by the ascendant, the degree of the zodiacwhich was rising over the horizon at the moment of birth, whichmarked the first house” (Tester 29). The first house, generally “life”,was the beginning of astrological prediction. Relationships amongcelestial bodies and the signs of the zodiac in the remainder of thehouses formed the basis for the horoscope, or life prediction. Wewill not say more on the subject of natal astrology since the Tractatde prenosticationdoes not deal with the topic.When Bohigas stated that the Tractat de prenosticationwas a brieftreatise on astrology (1965: 77), he was misled by its use of astrologi-cal symbolism, typical of popular forms of occult science. For exam-ple, the Tractat uses terminology from judicial astrology indiscriminatelyXIIXXXIIIIIIIIIVVVIIIVIIVIFigure 1.

Judicial astrology seeks to provide precise predic-tions or to offer advice on a specific question based on the positionof the stars at the time the question was posed or the event underquestion was to take place. As Curry notes, judicial astrology was apractical art and often considered to function by supernatural meansin contrast to natal astrology, which enjoyed a more scientific rep-utation (9).When the humanistic concern for experimental science and Neo-Platonism finally eclipsed Aristotelian rationalism, judicial astrologycame into favor among scientists. Nevertheless it forever came closeto crossing the lines of heresy and was not fully embraced by theChurch in the Middle Ages. There were Renaissance clergy whopracticed the art, such as the Italian scholar Marsilio Ficino (1433–99),and these scholars successfully vindicated the science in the Renaissancealong with other forms of magic (See Chapter 1, section A).The most important classical sources for judicial astrology includethe Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy and the Centiloquium, a popular collectionof astrological aphorisms attributed to him. Arabic translations of theTetrabibloscirculated in the Middle Ages. Plato of Tivoli translatedthe Tetrabiblosin 1136 (Lemay 65, n. 7). Latin translations were setin type as early as 1484 (Robbins in Ptolemy 1980: xv). The thirdsection of the Tractat de prenosticationcontains a collection of theo-logical statements and astrological aphorisms that derive, albeit indi-rectly, from this astrological tradition.Ptolemy confined himself primarily to natal astrology in Tetrabiblosand the mathematical observations of the stars needed to carry itout in Almagest. More complex varieties of astrological predictionexisted in the Greek and Arabic traditions. Ultimately all of thesesystems filtered into the Latin West and enriched the tradition ofprognostication:In the astrological texts of the Arabians, judicial astrology occupied aposition of distinctly minor importance. Its place was taken by twoother systems, current at the time of Ptolemy, which he had deliber-ately ignored—the so-called interrogationesand electiones. (Wedel 53–54)Both interrogationesand electioneswere known in the Middle Ages intranslation. Interrogationesinvolve a complex set of rules designed toanswer questions on a specific topic: the wealth of a future bride,the resting-place of a lost treasure, or the identity of a thief.

In the Tractat, we find references tothe appropriate day for washing the hair, which derive ultimatelyfrom this tradition.According to Lemay, John of Seville’s Latin translation of AbùMa\"shar’s Introductorium Maiusprovided the “weird expression” “judi-cial astrology” in the twelfth century. The Classical Greek term forastrological judgements was “prognostication”. John of Seville trans-lated the Arabic ahkàm, literally “authoritative pronouncement orlearning”, as “judgements” (67). Later the term “judicial astrology”is applied indiscriminately to Arabic and Greek works. We can alreadyobserve syncretism at work, the blending of two distinct systems intoa new whole. Syncretism becomes a leitmotif in any study of theprognostic arts.Means adopted the categories electionesand interrogationesand usedthem in her classification scheme, which conflates Greek forms ofjudicial astrology and the Arabic elections and interrogations. AlthoughMeans does not clearly explain this, the difference between Greekand Arabic forms of electiones and interrogationesis the apparatus usedto compute them. For the Greeks, these categories constitute twobranches of judicial astrology. In many Arabic sources, the electionesand interrogationesare not based on astrology at all, but rather ongeomancy, an entirely different method of prognostication that wewill treat in the next section.Some Arabic forms of electiones and interrogationesdo employ astrol-ogy, but differently than in the Greek texts. Arabic judicial astrol-ogy emphasizes the fixed stars, which are largely absent in Ptolemy,apart from those that make up the twelve constellations of the zodiac.There is also a greater emphasis on small divisions of the zodiac,divisions that were certainly known to the Greeks. For example, eachof the mundane houses has thirty degrees. The houses could be sub-divided into twelve smaller parts of 2 ½degrees (the so-called dode-catamoriaor twelve places) and a particular star or constellation assignedto each part (Tester 29). Thus a particular planet might be found ina house assigned to Cancer but within a division assigned to Pisces.The prediction would be tempered in part by both of these signs.The Arabic astrologers also used lots in their system of interroga-tionesand electiones, only a few of which found their way into GreekLUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"36 astrology. The lots are points in the zodiac found by computing rela-tionships among the fixed stars and planets. The lots do not corre-spond to any physical body in the universe, but are merely theoreticalconstructs. The house in which these lots ultimately land is crucialto answering questions and making proper decisions. Al-Bìrùnìstatesthat the number of these lots was increasing daily with each newtreatment of astrology, but he listed ninety-seven of the most impor-tant ones (1934: 282). When Wedel states that Ptolemy ignored elec-tionesand interrogationes(53–4), he was probably referring to the Arabicforms of this science. The Catalan astrologers of the thirteenth andfourteenth centuries, such as Bartomeu Tresbéns, employed many ofthese lots in their treatments of judicial astrology, a fact that reflectsthe importance Arabic science continued to exercise in the IberianPeninsula.According to Means, “electionary” refers to a “guide for choos-ing activities according to the most favorable astrological conditions”(370). Her definition makes “electionary” a sub-grouping of judicialastrology. This is logical, for electionesand interrogationesare really twoapplications of the same system. The only difference is that interro-gationes deals with specific questions rather than general topics. Meansadopts the Anglicism “questionary” for the Latin term interrogationes.Although Ptolemy does not have much to say on electionesandinterrogationes, most Greek astrologers do. The Latin expression “electio”is itself a translation of the Greek katarxÆ“inception” or “begin-ning”. Dorotheus of Sidon is the first to write of the subject in Greek,around the first century AD (Tester 88).The technical differences between natal astrology and the systemsof electionesand interrogationesare complex. Essentially, however, natalastrology examines the positions of the stars at one’s birth and pro-jects forward. Electionesand interrogationesexamine the position of thestars at the moment the question is made and then work backwardstowards the birth chart (Tester 88). Furthermore, the astrologicalmodel underlying the system of electionesand interrogationesis moreinvolved than in natal astrology. It looks at the ascendant (the degreeof the zodiac which is rising over the horizon at the moment inquestion), the moon, and the relationship between these two (Tester88). In contrast, natal astrology places little emphasis on the moonin determining the birth sign, although it does recognize its influenceon the overall horoscope.LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"       37The system of interrogationes, as practiced in the Middle Ages, organ-izes the questions to be asked according to the twelve mundanehouses. Here again we see syncretism at work, for the twelve mundanehouses are features of natal astrology. With electionesand interrogationes,“the starting point for the configuration of the first house...couldbe determined by different factors, but usually questions are calcu-lated according to the hour of the nativity of the questioner or thehour when the question was asked” (Means 395). The line betweenjudicial astrology and natal astrology is fluid.The Tractat de prenosticationborrows almost nothing directly fromthe system of electionesand interrogationes. In the second half of thework, however, we find a reference to the signes dretsand signes pros-trats. This division of the zodiac into straight and crooked signs prob-ably derives from Dorotheus of Sidon, one of the first to write oninterrogationes. A look at the original meaning of these terms and theiruse in the Tract de prenosticationprovides a concrete example of themultiple systems at work in our text. Tester states that the termsconstitute a “very simple division into those [signs] that rise in twoequinoctial hours and those that rise in more” (89).This division is useful as a starting place for the interrogationes, asDorotheus discusses the varying effects of the prediction if the ascen-dant is straight or crooked signs (Tester 89). We also find this dis-tinction, in a different form, in Ptolemy and in Arabic astrology.Al-Bìrùnì, whose Elements of the Art of Astrology (1029 AD) deals mostlywith astronomy and mathematics, treats this distinction under theheading “judicial astrology”. He observes, “Signs of the ascendinghalf are said to be signs of short or crooked ascension...while thoseof the descending half are said to be signs of long or direct ascen-sion...The crooked signs are also called ‘obedient’ . . .” (1934: 229).Ramsay, who edited Al-Bìrùnì, observes that the “northern signscommand because when the sun is on them, the day is longer thanthe night” (229).An astrological miscellany (c. 1440) from Andorra, known as Tencar,assigns the Catalan terms dretsand prostratsto the same signs as inthe Tractat. Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius are straight,whereas Capricorn, Aquarius, Piscis, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini arecrooked (Vela Palomares 1997: 100). Since neither Tencarnor theTractat de prenosticationis a method for making electionesor interroga-tiones, the only purpose of this distinction is to separate the weakLUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"38 signs from the strong. In the Tractat de prenostication, the straight signsare the more powerful, although this is probably due to semanticassociation and has little to do with astrology per se.Means’s last category involves lunar prognostication or “lunary”,which derives from Arabic and Hebrew traditions and substitutes the28.5 day lunar cycle for that of the sun (376). The lunar calendaris common currency in many eastern traditions: Hebrew, Arabic,Chinese, and Indian. There are three theories about the origin oflunar astrology. Some state that either the system originated in Chinaand spread through Central Asia to India and the Middle East orit began in India and spread to China and the Middle East subse-quently. Others contend that the system began in Babylonia and wasbrought to Arabia, India, and finally China (Yampolsky 68). Testerargues that the Babylonian origin is the most convincing but doesnot bother to state why this is the case (82).Whatever its origin, the lunar calendar reached the Latin Westthrough Hebrew and Arabic sources. The Greco-Roman and Arabictraditions mutually refer to one another. Ptolemy did not base hiscalculations upon the lunar cycle, however he recognized the impor-tance of the moon as the planet closest to the earth (Tetrabiblos1.2).3Even in zodiacal astrology, the moon was one of the most impor-tant planets to consider when making astrological judgements. Lunarprognostication figures prominently in Renaissance astrology, andparticularly in the fifteenth century material we find in Catalonia.The use of the term varies in different languages, however.In Middle English usage, “lunary” often refers to computations onthe age of the moon rather than prognostication based upon thelunar calendar (Means 376). In Catalan, lunarior llunari refers tocharts of lunar data that include the dates of new and full moonsand lunar eclipses. The data is based upon a complex astronomicalmodel, which is generally not published with the data tables (e.g.Granollach’s Catalan lunari). In chapter 1, we observed that thislunar data was often incorporated into larger almanacs or calendarssuch as Li’s Reportorio de los tiempos. The data was useful in comput-ing moveable feasts in the ecclesiastical calendar, for example.3“The moon, too, as the heavenly body nearest the earth, bestows her effluencemost abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate,are sympathetic to her and change in company with her . . .” (Tetrabiblos1.2).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"       39The lunar calendar also has a system of mansions (from Arabicmanzil) similar to the division of the zodiac into houses in solar astrol-ogy. The system of twenty-eight lunar mansions was not consideredin accord with orthodox Catholic theology:This system of lunar mansions could easily serve for magical purposes,and seems to have been in bad odor with Church writers. In theSpeculum Astronomiae, ascribed to Albert the Great, the twenty-eight lunarmansions are expressly connected with diabolical arts. (Alberti MagniOpera, ed. Jammy, 1751, 5. 656) (cit. in Wedel 54)Like many other features of astrology, the lunar mansions originallyhad nothing to do with the topic but represent a later conflation ofthe different systems. The importance of the lunar mansions in theArabic tradition is obvious, as the Islamic calendar was and still isbased on the synodic month (Tester 82).The twenty-eight days of the lunar month give us the division oftwenty-eight lunar mansions. The system originally grew out of thesuperstitious belief in lucky and unlucky days, referred to as Egyptiandays.4The mansions were first associated with fixed stars and laterwith seventeen or twenty-eight animal symbols. Tester believes thatthe survival of the fixed stars as a feature of Western astrology isdue to the their importance in lunar astrology (82). The associationof the lunar mansions to animal symbols is found in Egypt and rep-resents a different tradition. The association of the stars to animalsymbols and thence to the constellations represents a complicatedand lengthy process, perhaps completed and grafted onto zodiacalastrology by the second century AD (Tester 83).The importance of the moon is readily apparent in all systems ofastrology. However Means’s system of classification begins to breakdown when it treats lunar astrology as category distinct from the“electionary” and “questionary” because lunar and solar astrologycan both be used for electionesand interrogationes. Means has used afunctional label in three cases (i.e. “electionary”, “destinary”, “ques-tionary”) and structural or descriptive label in the fourth (i.e. lunarversus solar). Her classification scheme also fails to distinguish betweenArabic and Greek forms of electiones and interrogationes, namely by4Popular almanacs suggest that it is dangerous to perform certain acts (e.g. wash-ing the hair, cutting the nails, beginning a journey) on specific days of the week.The Egyptians and Babylonians both used lists of lucky and unlucky days, and theformer have given their name to the tradition (Tester 88–91).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"40 blending astrological prognostication with Arabic systems based ongeomancy. Means’s system derives largely from the titles of the MiddleEnglish texts, a feature which she observes is not always adequatefor understanding the work in question (368).A better classification system would treat natal and judicial astrol-ogy separately. The electiones and interrogationesare properly treatedtogether as two sub-branches of judicial astrology since they bothderive from the same traditions and represent two different appli-cations of judicial astrology. The influence of the moon is best treatedapart, as a philosophical addition to astrology, following Tester’s sug-gestion (82). Arabic forms of judicial astrology should also receiveseparate treatment, especially when based upon geomancy, since thisscience springs from wholly independent textual traditions. Finally,the numerological and magical treatises that employ astrological sym-bolism should also be treated under a separate heading. Means doesnot consider astrological magic in her survey of Middle English prog-nostic material.Astrological magic, broadly defined, encompasses any magical oroccult art that refers to astrological symbolism and professes a beliefin the power of the stars. Astrological magic occasionally treats theplanets as deities in their own right, and the number of these sys-tems is legion. Astrology exercised a deep and powerful influence onpopular culture throughout much of recorded history; however thescience required complex and sometimes secret or illegal knowledge.Astrological magic makes use of the astrological symbols without thecomplicated theoretical baggage necessary to compute a horoscope.Two of the most common forms of astrological magic are sympa-thetic and talismanic.Practitioners of astrological medicine believed the stars exercisedtheir effects on different parts of the body, a theory known as meloth-esia. The Reportorio de los tiemposcontains woodcuts that represent anaked male figure with his body divided into zones of astrologicalinfluence. These “zodiac men” were a common feature of popularalmanacs in the Middle Ages and Renaissance (Delbrugge in Li1999: 9). Sympathetic magic derives from the Hippocratic-Galenictradition, in which the most common cure is a force of equal powerand opposite effect: contraria contrariis curantur. The works of Hippocritesand Galen survive in the Western world largely through transmis-sion via Arabic sources. In Catalonia, the medical works of Arnaude Vilanova (1235–1313) and Raimon Llull (1232–1315) are the mostimportant expressions of this tradition.LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"       41The Tractatrefers to the parts of the body that are most likely tocause trouble for men and women born under the various signs ofthe zodiac.

Sympathetic magic makes useof a rich corpus of folklore on the powers of plants, animals, rocks,etc. to counteract the negative influences of the stars or of a curse.The Tractat de prenosticationdoes not treat magic directly, but it doesallude to the magical powers found in nature and in man-madesigns. Discussing the manner for avoiding the negative influence ofthe stars, the Tractat de prenosticationsuggests such power is found inprecious stones, herbs, animals, magical seals, and planets, amongmany other items.5Talismanic magic6simply concentrates the effect of this power in5“. . . pedras preciosas e erbas, e encara animals e segells ho pedras ab figuras,arbres e planets, e moltas altres cosas . . .” (Fol. 11v).6The Church generally opposed the use of talismans and other non-Christiansymbols.

Therefore magicians who use symbols, incantations, and so forth,must necessarily be addressing themselves to demons (Summa contra gentiles 3.105).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"       43amulets or other artifacts, also referred to in the preceding passagefrom the Tractat de prenostication. Sometimes these amulets bear thefigure of an astrological constellation or magical numbers associatedwith the sign. The most important medieval source text on talismanicmagic is Picatrix, a Latin translation of Ghàyat al-Hakìm (Ed. Pingree1986). In the first chapter, we noted that a fragmentary version ofthis work is found in a Catalan miscellany known as Tencarand maysuggest that a complete Catalan translation of the text once existed.B.GeomancyGeomancy is to the Arabic tradition what judicial astrology was forthe Greeks and, eventually, the Latin West. It was a common meansof prognostication based upon simple mathematical principles. Prac-titioners of geomancy used the science to answer their clients’ inter-rogationesand to help them make electiones. The Latin West receivedthe science of geomancy from Arabic scholars, although the prac-tice may have originated in the Mesopotamian basin or India (Char-masson 3).Originally geomancers drew a series of random points on the sandor on a piece of paper. The geomancer was not supposed to payclose attention to the number of points drawn, except to make surethere were at least twelve points in each row and that there weresixteen rows of points (Charmasson 25). The points were then con-nected and rearranged into figures in a sort of pyramid. The num-ber of points per figure was of particular importance. There wereeight possible figures, each with a name and significance. Elaboraterules explained how to construct, combine, and interpret the figuresproduced by this methodology. Although the Latin geomancies allshare basic features, there were many subtle variations on the orig-inal Arabic source material.The geomantic figures received the names of the astrological houses;and in this way, astrology and geomancy become associated in thetextual tradition.7In astrological geomancy, rather than search for7“Certaines oeuvres, qui portent également le nom de géomanties, représententun type de divination différent, qu’il serait plus juste d’appeller géomancie astrologique,ou comme le nomme le traducteur d’une géomancie de ce type, attribuée à Gérard deCrémone, géomancie astronomique. Le jet des points n’a pas pour but la constructiond’un thème géomantique, mais celle d’un thème astrologique . . .” (Charmasson 217).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"44 the answer to a question, one tries to discover the birth sign. Althoughone has to learn certain basic rules, this does not involve the complexunderstanding of mathematics and astronomy necessary to cast astandard astrological horoscope. The astrological symbolism, familiarto many people, and the simple calculations needed to obtain an an-swer earned this hybrid form of prognostication immense popularity.Some of the earliest Latin texts on geomancy are associated withthe name of Bernard Silvester (floruit1150). The texts belong to acomplex tradition known in a few of the manuscripts as the Experimen-tarius, and most of the manuscripts are preserved in English libraries(Thorndike 2: 122–23). The basis of most of the Experimentariuscor-pus is unmistakably geomancy. In one set of manuscripts, the instruc-tions require that one divide by the magical number seven to obtainthe name of a “Judge of the Fates”, of which there are twenty-eight,no doubt influenced by the lunar calendar. The magical numbertwenty-eight repeats itself as there are twenty-eight lines of text con-taining as many responses to twenty-eight subjects of inquiry (Thorn-dike 2: 113). Thus the Experimentariusrepresents an early medievalform of interrogationesbased upon geomancy. As Thorndike furthernotes, there are many manuscripts in the tradition and they are oftenbound together with unrelated material; several independent strainshave become irrevocably confused (2: 115). One of these strains treatsan alpha-numeric form of divination ascribed to Pythagorus. We willreturn to this tradition again when we speak of numerology.Savorelli (1959) is the only modern edition of the Experimentarius,but Burnett has questioned her choice of manuscript witnesses anda number of her readings (1977). According to Burnett, we find theonly bit of this tradition truly attributable to Bernard Silvester onpages 312–342 of Savorelli’s edition (1977: 84–5). Savorelli’s mate-rial, according to Burnett, more likely belongs to another textual tra-dition called Sortes regis Amalrici, of which two complete versions exist.Burnett traces the first version to the late classical period and thesecond version, in Leonine hexameter, to the eleventh century (1977:85). The text belongs to an astrologically-based form of the sortestra-dition, or lot casting, which we will examine in the next section.To date, the only complete study of geomancy as a genre is Char-masson (1980), who listed all the manuscripts on geomancy that shefound in Latin and the vernaculars. There is no listing for anyCatalan language sources, although there appears to be some tradi-tion in Provençal from the fifteenth century.

Most ofthe vernacular texts included in Charmasson’s study, however, arewritten in English and French9(301–3).Geomancy was common currency in the early Middle Ages; thenumber of manuscripts preserved in Western European libraries isquite large, although not as large as the astrological corpus (Char-masson 223). No Catalan language treatise on geomancy exists; how-ever we have least one Catalan system of prognostication based uponthe system.10The text was uncovered quite by chance, like our Tractatde prenostication. Carreras y Candi reports having discovered a bat-tered old manuscript on the subject while rummaging around theCathedral of Barcelona in 1901. Carreras y Candi believes the workwas copied around 1300, based upon paleographic analysis and thelarge number of Provençal vocabulary items in the text (325).It is an irony of history that popular works on prognostication,once condemned, are preserved in church libraries. Carreras y Candi’smanuscript, a unique find, contains eight unnumbered folia. Thecomputational apparatus is entirely missing, which makes it impos-sible to discern whether the text belongs under the rubric of geo-mancy or some similar form of lot casting. Whatever the apparatus,the work is based upon the number twenty, as there are twentychapters and twenty areas of inquiry (329). Carreras y Candi believesthe work requires the casting of a die, although there are numerouspossibilities (329).Carreras y Candi transcribed the work in its entirety and, fromthe general appearance, the work belongs to a particular form of8The unusual word calatarramaderives from the Arabic for “striking the sand”,a reference to the original method of casting geomantic themes by marking pointsin the ground with a stick.9A fifteenth century French and Latin manuscript constitutes one of the mostinteresting sources on popular prognostication. The French language sections includeworks on medical astrology, herbal lore, physiognomy, chyromancy, the interpre-tation of dreams, geomancy, horoscopes, lunar prognostics, remedies for the plague,and recipes for other medical cures among other associated lore. See Camus (1895)cit. in Charmasson (1980) for a discussion.10Ramon Llull (1232–1316) refers to geomancers who, like other sorts of for-tune-tellers, often traveled from town to town peddling advice. He condemns themfirmly in his Arbre de sciènciaas charlatans out to make a quick profit, not becausethey were associated with any sort of diabolical art.LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 45"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"46 prognostication that falls somewhere between geomancy and lot cast-ing.

The Tractat de prenostica-tionemploys one of many astro-numerological systems of future telling.Like Hebrew gematria, these forms of prognostication involve the asso-ciation of letters to numbers and require the user to perform a vari-ety of calculations upon them.Number consciousness receives added impulse from the classicalphilosophers. As Tester notes, “The Pythagoreans made numbergames philosophically respectable, and the great authority of Platoraised mathematics into theological realms. But at the lowest level,numbers remained magical” (65). Plato believed the universe was aliving creature infused with a soul, the anima mundi. The anima mundiwas based in turn upon harmonious mathematical ratios (MacQueen31). Nicomachus of Gerasa (floruit c.100–200 AD), drawing on thelater notion that Plato’s Forms were ideas in the mind of God, fusedthis notion with mathematics. The basis for Nicomachean philo-sophical mathematics is the number one, which was not a numberat all in Greek. Rather it refers to the concept of “unity” or “theunit”. Greek number series began with the number two. “One”became the motivating force for all numbers, the necessary begin-ning, although it was not a number itself.12This leads easily to the association of monad, “the one”, and God.As MacQueen notes, “Creation is then parallel to the expansion ofthe number series, and as the number series is already implicit inthe monad, so creation is implicit in the mind of God” (6). The linkbetween numbers and theology is an important point, and it is easyto see how Christianity adopted Pythagorean and Platonic principlesand worked them harmoniously into the fabric of medieval cosmol-ogy. The fathers of the Catholic Church, so dutiful in their pursuit11See note 4.12On the definition of “one”, St. Isidore repeats this observation verbatim:“Numerus autem est multitudo ex unitatibus constituta. Nam unum semen numeriesse, non numerum” (Etymologiae3.3.1).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"48 of non-Christian forms of magic, encouraged their faithful to scru-tinize the Bible for underlying numerological meaning.The patristic writers did not have to look very hard, for the Bibleis steeped in number philosophy. Whereas the Old Testament isredolent of Hebrew number symbolism, the New Testament waswritten at a time when Neo-Platonic and Gnostic theories were com-mon currency. These Greek number philosophies infuse and informthe entire New Testament.13When Jesus states, “I am the Alphaand the Omega”, He is using Greek number symbolism (Revelation22.13). In the Greek alphabet, letters also have a numerical value.Alpha and Omega are the beginning and end of the Greek alpha-bet. By extension, Christ embodies all numbers, all creation. In theGospel of John, where traces of Gnostic philosophy are most clearlypresent, Christ is referred to as the Word. We read, “In the begin-ning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Wordwas God. And without Him was not anything made that was made”( John 1.1–3 RSV). Christ encompasses in flesh and in spirit the fullpower of words and numbers. With Platonic philosophy and Gnosticsymbolism in tow, it is possible to trace all manner of numerologi-cal and alphanumeric symbolism in the Bible.14Our treatment of numerological prognostication would be in-complete without a discussion of the link between letters and num-bers. Medieval Christians explained many of their symbols in termsof numbers. This practice is based upon the Greek and Hebrewalphabets, in which each letter also represents a numerical value.Early Christians found these associations pregnant with theologicalimplications:The reason of their [the Greek Christians] having twenty-four lettersis the ten senses of man and the ten commandments of the Law andthe four Gospels. Whereas to Romans, the reason for having twenty-three letters is that there are ten senses of man also and Ten Command-ments of the Law and the Trinity. (MacQueen 11)Medieval readers of the Tractat de prenosticationand similar literatureprobably had only the most vague understanding of the rich philo-sophical basis for the prognostic art they held in their hands.

Only a few contemporary authors cite source texts in theirfootnotes; most simply cite one another.15The source texts are, witha few exceptions, unedited and inaccessible. In this review, we willconsider four strains of numerological prognostication that exist inCatalan and have some bearing on the Tractat de prenostication.The first form of prognostication involves lot casting, also knownas sortesin Latin. The second strain is neo-Pythagorean in origin andis found in Hermetic texts such as the Wheel of Life and Death. Thebasis of this form of divination is onomancy, which draws on thenumerical value of names. The Tractat de prenostication uses such asystem. The third strain of number prophecy is Arabic in origin.Some of these works are enumerated in the Hermetic corpus as well.Finally the pseudo-Aristotelian Secreta secretorumtradition employs div-ination by numbers. This tradition is also based upon original Arabicsources. Undoubtedly there are relationships among these traditionsthat can only fully be ascertained after the source material has beenmade available in critical editions.According to Burnett, the material available provides sufficient evi-dence for an uninterrupted sortes tradition from the classical periodthrough the Middle Ages (1996: 85). In as much as they employastrological symbolism, these books of fortune are similar to theTractat de prenostication. As Burnett observes, the Greek versions ofsortesliterature do not generally bear references to the lunar man-sions. One obtains a magical number and is sent to a judge, a figure,a planet or the like. In the Sortes regis Amalrici, one finds referencesto the twenty-eight mansions of the moon, and the method for obtain-ing the magical number is similar to that found in Arabic geomancy.15Tester mentions popular forms of prognostication involving the magical prop-erties of words and letters but offers no references (65). Hopper also notes theimportance of such a system but apparently finds the subject too difficult to tackle:“It was even considered possible to discover the sign of any individual by meansof arithmancy, which was itself a method of divination utilizing a highly involvedcombination of Pythagoreanism, gematria, and simple mathematics, which I willnot attempt to describe” (Hopper 119).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"50 Burnett suggests one plausible hypothesis about the transmissionof the geomancy known as the Experimentarius, based on thoroughtextual study of the material. The Experimentariusof Silvestris mayhave been an autochthonous Latin text of which only the prefacesurvives, whereas the Sortes regis Amalricibelongs to an independenttradition (1977: 86). Burnett further suggests that the Sortes regis Amalriciis much like other sortes texts occurring in the seventh century andbased on Greek material. This means that the popular sortes tradi-tion in the Latin West involves a blending of Arabic and Greeksource material, perhaps closely related to geomancy (86).Whatever the earliest sources may be, sortes literature survives inthe Iberian Peninsula in the form of popular books of prognostica-tion that, although taken seriously by many, also exist as fortune-telling games. Carreras y Candi’s anonymous thirteenth centuryCatalan text is a witness to this tradition. In sixteenth century, wefind books such as the Libro de las suertesin the Spanish language.Navarro Durán reedited a Spanish version of such a game and stud-ied the Latin manuscripts preserved in Spanish libraries (1987). InArcadia, Lope de Vega describes a pastoral scene in which shepherdsplay one such game (1980: 396–400). Indeed such games are stillpopular in the Western world.The second strain of numerological prognostication derives fromthe neo-Pythagorean tradition and is transmitted in the Hermeticcorpus. Hermetic literature is one branch of pseudo-epigraphic writ-ings that were common currency in the Roman Empire. These writ-ings, often ascribed to Egyptian gods or sages, purport to revealsecret wisdom of the ancients. Many works are doubtless forgeriesbut, as Thorndike observes, they often do repeat timeless forms ofmagic and prognostication (1: 287). Hermes Trimegistos or Hermesthe Egyptian is a conflation of the Egyptian god Thoth and theGreek god Hermes, both responsible for all manner of science, learn-ing, magic, and experimentation. Trimegistos is a curious appella-tion derived from the Egyptian megistosor “great”. When appliedthree times, the god becomes “Hermes the Great Great Great” orsimply “Hermes Trimegistos” (Thorndike 1: 288).Among this motley collection of manuscripts, we find methods ofprognostication based upon the numerical value of names. Althoughoften grouped with Hermetic writings, these works are generallyattributed to Pythagorus, the great mathematician of Samos. In theneo-Pythagorean tradition, the most important numerals are thoseLUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"       51from one to ten. These form the basis of all other numbers and havemagical properties. When computing the numerical value of one’sname for example, one reduces the number to one of these digits.A form of divination based upon Pythagorean philosophy survivesin the Western Europe in the form of the so-called “Spheres of Lifeand Death”, a generic label applying to a variety of texts. The Sphereof Democritus, Prognostic of Life and Death, preserved in a Leiden papyrusprovides one such example (Thorndike 1: 682). Generally one findsa table assigning a number to each letter of the Latin alphabet, asin the Tractat de prenostication. After computing the value of the propername in question, one examines a wheel of fortune. This spherecontains numbered compartments with such labels as “life” and“death”. The obvious purpose of these spheres is to predict the healthof a sick person, but there are other applications as well.16For example, one can employ the same basic system to foreseewhich of two combatants will win a battle. Festugière and Massignonlist many Greek manuscripts attributed to Pythagorus or to his son,Telauges, which provides a prognostic device for such a battle (1:336).17One computes the numerical value of the names of eachcombatant and reduces the result to one of the base numbers fromone to ten. An accompanying table provides various formulas fordeciding who will win the battle. Following the mystical propertiesof the monad, the number one triumphs in all cases (Festugière andMassignon 1: 336–7).This sort of name-number divination survives in yet another iter-ation known as the Letter from Nechepso to Petosirus(an Egyptian kingand priest, respectively). The only extant MS in the Iberian Peninsulais Madrid 10016 from the thirteenth century.18A text ascribed to St. Donatus also uses a form of astro-numerologysimilar to the one found in the Tractat de prenostication.19The formula16Thorndike was able to work directly from many manuscripts that are still noteasily accessible, and his partial listing of sources for the “Sphere of Life and Death”is the only such repertory available (1: 692–94).17The largest edition of Greek prognostic materials available is the massiveCatalogus codicum astrologorum Graecorum, ed. Cumont, Kroll, Boll, et al., Brussels, 1898.For a discussion of some of the material, consult Thorndike and Festugière et al.18The incipit begins “spera de morte vel vita . . .” (Fol. 85v). In this tradition,the numbers from one to thirty are used. Thorndike further notes that the text wasoriginally housed in an English Cluniac monastery (1: 693).19MS Egerton 821, twelfth century. Fol. 15: “Hic est spera quod fecit sanctusDonatus. Quicumque egrotare incipit . . .” (Thorndike 1: 684).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"52 in this text requires the user to calculate the numerical value of thegiven name and the mother’s name (Thorndike 2: 684). In the St.Donatus text, one computes the difference in value between theclient’s name and that of his mother to find the birth sign. In con-trast, the Tractat de prenosticationrequires that one take the sum of theclient’s name and that of his mother and to divide that by twenty-eight. The remainder determines the birth sign. Many other systemsare possible, and it has so far been impossible to develop a stemmacodicumfor the tradition.20In both cases, these texts illustrate divination by astro-numerol-ogy. Like astrological magic, astro-numerology is a hybrid prognos-tication system that makes symbolic use of the signs of the zodiac.In neither case do the movements, positions, or relationships amongthe constellations have any value. However some medieval readersobviously thought such systems belonged to astrology proper. Anapologetic tract, appended to the Tractat de prenostication, providesjustification for prognostication by astrology and makes use of ter-minology from the science. The compiler obviously felt it was a use-ful justification for the name-number symbolism described in the first half of the text. We find both astrology and astro-numerologyfused together in the Tractat de prenostication, which is common in thistradition.In the second section of the Tractat de prenostication, wefind a ref-erence to Pythagorus, so it appears that the treatise draws, albeitindirectly, on the astro-numerological tracts of the Hermetic corpus.The relationship between letters and numbers in our Tractatis ran-dom. However the highest value assigned to any letter is twenty-four, perhaps a reference to the Greek alphabet (See chapter 3,section B below). The use of the lunar number twenty-eight as adivisor would contradict this, however, because such lunar numbersare more commonly found in prognosticaof the Arabic variety. It is20Divination by astro-numerology survives in the twentieth century. Most of thetexts are conceived as practical manuals and are universally uncritical. Most arealso unhistorical; some grossly so. For a contemporary example, see Halfon (1984).He adds Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto to the equations (discovered in 1781, 1846,and 1930 respectively). To make the number of planets equal to the number ofconstellations, he adds the lune noiror “black moon”, which he associates with Karma(99). The association of numbers to planets and to the alphabet represents a sim-ilar conflation of Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew systems. Halfon’s work is useful as acontemporary example of the blending of cultural traditions that took place intwelfth century Spain.LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"       53possible to separate Arabic astro-numerology from Greek versionsand postulate a separate strain in the literature.The third major grouping of numerological prognostic devices areArabic in origin. The earliest witnesses preserved are dated betweenthe tenth and eleventh centuries,21the time when Arabic science wasjust beginning to penetrate into the consciousness of the Latin West.The so-called Mathematic of Alchandrus(or Alhandreus) includes a sys-tem of prognostication much like the Pythagorean spheres. Pietro ofAbano in his Lucidator astronomiae, written in 1310, mentions Alchandrusas a successor of Hermes Trismegistos in the use of astronomy(Thorndike 1: 710, n. 5).The prognostic apparatus in the Alchandrus texts also computesthe value of the questioner’s name and his mother’s name, althoughin this case the Hebrew alphabet is used instead of the Greek. Thisis no surprise, however, as many ancient texts employ foreign alpha-bets or invent magic alphabets of their own. The calculations do notprovide the birth sign, as in our Tracat de prenostication, but ratherone of the twenty-eight mansions of the moon (given in their Arabicnames). A description of the characteristics of men born under eachlunar sign usually accompanies the apparatus. Of particularly inter-est are mentions of markings found on the body, such as dog bitesand wounds from hot irons, because these references also occurrepeatedly in the Tracat de prenostication(Thorndike 1: 712–13).There are many manuscript versions of the Alchandrus text inLatin. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century onward, transla-tions were also printed in English and French. The name of theauthor varies in the texts, and no Spanish or Catalan translationsare known (Thorndike 1: 711–718). To further complicate matters,a geomancy is ascribed to Alkardianus or Alchandiandus. This textis also arranged according to the twenty-eight divisions of the zodiacwith twenty-eight judges and twenty-eight chapters. The author statesthat he has also composed works on lunar prediction and offers thissimple geomancy as a more convenient means to predict the future.According to Thorndike, who personally inspected many of the man-uscripts, the tables are identical to one of the strains of geomancyassociated with the Experimentarius(1: 717). This tends to confirm21Bibliothèque National de Paris 17868, fols. 85v–99vMathematica Alhandrei summaastrologidates from the tenth century; British Library Addit. 17808, fol. 86v; MunichStaatsbibliothek MS CLM 560, fols. 61–87 (See Thorndike 1: 710 for a discussion).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"54 Burnett’s theory (1977) that the Experimentariusis built up from sev-eral independent textual traditions.The pseudo-Aristotelian Secreta secretorumtradition is the last strainof astro-numerological prognostication we will consider. The textsthat make up the Secreta secretorumcorpus belong to a genre, knownas the mirror of princes, that transmits the wisdom of statecraft andother knowledge appropriate for young rulers. The Secreta secretorumpurportedly contains the teachings of Aristotle to his young pupil,Alexander the Great. Like the Hermetic corpus, these texts claimthe authority of the ancients and the mystery that surrounds secretknowledge. The text appears to have entered Western Europe in thetwelfth century with the first rebirth of magic and experimental sci-ence. A certain Johannes, often associated with John of Seville (floruit1135–1150), made one of the first Latin translations of the originalArabic Kitàb sirr al-asràr(Gaster 746).22The Secreta corpus is far too extensive to discuss at length here;every important European library contains at least one manuscriptor printed version. In his edition, Manzalaoui estimates the numberof MSS at around 500 (1977: ix). As we observed with the Experi-mentarius, works such as this are accretive, built up from a variety ofdifferent sources. In any case, the stemma codicumfor the Secreta secre-torumhas not yet been completed, although Manzalaoui skillfully laidout the principle problems in the tradition (1974).Gaster translated and provided a critical edition based upon thecollation of four Hebrew manuscripts, the earliest of which datesfrom 1382 (1971). We refer primarily to Gaster’s translation and edi-tion of the Hebrew version in our study. According to Gaster, thestyle and language points to one of the Jewish translators active inSpain at the time (Gaster 748). What concerns our Tractat de prenostica-tion is chapter ten involving the calculations of the names of generals.This prognostic device requires that one calculate the value of twogenerals’ names based upon the Hebrew alphabet. One then dividesby nine and examines the remainder. Unlike the Pythagorean sys-tems, the number one does not always win. One beats all other oddnumbers and loses to all evens. The remaining numbers are exam-ined in successive paragraphs. The chapter then concludes abruptly:“End of the war play, may the Lord put to shame my enemies.22Manzalaoui, however, cautions against this attribution in his edition of nineEnglish versions of the Secreta(1977: xiv) and in other publications (e.g. 1974).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 54"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"       55Amen, Amen, Selah for evermore” (799). The importance of namesprovides a faint link to the Tractat de prenostication.Without straying too far from the Iberian context, a look at oneof the fourteenth century English versions of the Secreta secretorumfur-ther illustrates how many different forms of numerical prognostica-tion have built up in the tradition. Certeyne Rewles of Phisnomycontainsonly the physiognomy and onomancy sections of the Secreta secreto-rum.23Here we find several different associations of numbers to theEnglish alphabet, each with a specific purpose. First we have a sys-tem for calculating the names of two warriors or generals, like theone we find in the Hebrew text Gaster edited (Ed. Manzalaoui 1977:15). The text advises that the same alphabet may be used to findout whether a man will overcome an illness. In this case, the bat-tle pits the man against the moon. One calculates the numericalvalue of the date upon which the illness began and compares thatto the numerical value of the man’s name.In the same text, we find an alphabet designed to compute whethera man or his wife will die first. This system is probably Pythagoreanin origin, based as it is upon the numbers one through nine. In thissystem one adds the value of both names; if the final numerical valueis even, the man will die first. If the value is odd, the woman willdie first. The importance of odd and even numbers is crucial toPythagorean systems of numerology. Subsequently we find an alpha-bet for finding the planet that rules the fate of any man.Finally an alphabet similar to the one found in the Tractat de prenos-ticationprovides a numerical value for each letter of the alphabet.24A mathematical formula, used to compute the birth sign, requiresthe reader to compute the value of his or her name and mother’sname. One can also use the alphabet to compute the fortune of anentire town.25The lunar number twenty-eight constitutes the divisor,23MS Sloane 213, fols. 118v–121 (Ed. Manzalaoui 1977).24In this text, the correspondence between numbers and letters is different thanin the Tractat. The assignations are, in both cases, probably random. A:2. B:21.C:20. D:41. E:5. F:24.

The remainder is used to determinethe birth sign, counting around the Zodiac also as in the Tractat deprenostication. This text ends abruptly here, and no account of thetwelve signs follows.Our treatment of the four principle traditions of divination bynumerology helps appreciate the age of the sources for the Tractatde prenostication. Its survival bears witness to early numerological formsof prognostication that the Latin West inherited from its Greco-Roman past in addition to contributions from the Arabic traditions,imported from the tenth to the twelfth centuries. This survey alsodemonstrates how easily astrological divination was grafted onto othernumber-based systems of prognostication to create the hybrid sys-tems of the Hermetic corpus and the Experimentarius. These prog-nostic devices, an early blend of science and magic, provided a wayof understanding the mysteries of the natural world. The CatalanTractat de prenosticationbelongs to this accretive tradition, participat-ing to some degree in all of these forms of prognostication, althoughit is not identical to any one of them. It is unlikely that we will everuncover the exact sources for our Catalan text as so much of theoriginal material has been lost.D.GematriaThe Jewish tradition of gematria provides another method of numero-logical prognostication wholly independent from the Arabic and Greekmaterials we have just explored. Gematria is a practical branch ofthe Jewish Cabbala, a mystical approach to understanding and inter-preting sacred scripture. Gematria is the device by which letters andnumbers are associated and the numerical value of words computed,as we observed with onomancy and other forms of numerology. Notall forms of Cabbala make use of gematria, and the practice doesnot bear directly upon the Tractat de prenostication. However no dis-cussion of the prognostic sciences in Catalonia (or anywhere else inSpain for that matter) would be complete without a brief mention.Beaujouan contends that Jewish mysticism played an important rolein the revalorization of the occult sciences in fifteenth century Cata-lonia (36–7).The most important text of the Cabbala, the ZoharorBook ofLUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"       57Splendor,26was born in Jewish Spain and established the kind ofauthority usually reserved for the Bibleor Talmud. The author of theZohar, purportedly Rabbi Moses de León (d. 1305), was one of themost important Spanish Cabbalists, and his work flourished fromabout 1500 to 1800. Afterwards the Zohardisappeared from the con-sciousness of the masses until experiencing a recent revival (Scho-lem 7).Catalonia played a particularly important role in the diffusion ofCabbala. Moses ben Nahman or Nahmanides (1194–1270) foundeda school of Cabbala in Girona. Known as Bonastruç Ça Porta inCatalan, Nahmanides practiced medicine as well as theology. Accordingto Tryon-Montalembert and Hruby, Nahmanides applied mysticismdirectly to sacred scripture, mostly notably in his studies of the Penta-teuch (1974: 48). The pogroms of 1391, carried out brutally in Gironaand Barcelona, brought a swift end to the flowering of Jewish Biblicalscholarship (Beaujouan 13).Astrological prognostication receives the same official condemna-tion in Jewish theology that it finds in Christian orthodoxy. Glazersonprovides many examples of this prohibition in Jewish law books. Forexample, he observes that the Code of Jewish Lawforbids the consulta-tion of one’s astrological forecast (1). Although such condemnationis also found in the Zohar, astrological symbolism finds some resonancein Jewish mysticism. The concern that astrological influences noteclipse human free will is also similar to the Christian tradition.Nachmanides wrote, “. . . [ T ]he Jew, through the power of his choiceand through his walking in the way of the Torah, may rise above theastrological influences” (in Glazerson 2). This sounds much like thePtolemaic adage “homo sapiens dominabitur astris” we find in Chris-tian defenses of astrology and in our Catalan Tractat de prenostication.Gematria is different form the other forms of numerology both inscope and in function. Whereas other forms of numerology only treatthe value of names, Hebrew scholars use gematria to calculate thevalue of all words. According to Jewish mysticism, every phrase inthe Torah has a hidden meaning. Gematria is the key to findingthat meaning in numerical permutations. The tsérûfis the study of26The work has been translated into many languages; the number of editions islegion. See, for example, Moses de León (1997; 1987; 1983) in the references.

The notarikoncollects new wordsformed from the initial or final words of verses of scripture (Tryon-Montalembert and Hruby 92). Although some Cabbalists deny theimportance of gematria, others, for example Abraham Abulafia,27make such extensive use of it that their work is virtually impene-trable without a thorough understanding of the science.The Christian equivalent of gematria and Cabbala is found inGnostic scholarship, Neo-Platonic approaches to theology, and Pytha-gorean mathematics. Christian mystics also applied numerology tothe study of sacred scripture. In fact Swietlicki applies the term“Christian Cabbala” to her study of the mystics Luis de León, Teresade Jesús, and Juan de la Cruz (1986). François Secret uses a similarlabel in his approach (1964). Prior to the diaspora of 1492 and evenafterwards, Spanish Christians were influenced by Cabbalistic sym-bolism and incorporated it into their scholarship. We find this par-ticularly in treatments of the names of God by Arnau de Vilanova.Ramon Llull was also interested in the value of words, and thisfigures prominently in the devolpment of his “art” or logic-machine.It is tempting to search for traces of gematria in the Tractat deprenostication since it is based on numbers. Certainly there were manyimportant Jewish centers of learning in Catalunya (e.g. Barcelona,Girona, Besalú), and one might expect to find some resonance.However one finds no specific influence of Jewish mysticism in thetext. The numerical apparatus, alphabet, and other symbols used inthe Tractat de prenosticationare different than in the Jewish traditionof gematria. Daniel Abrams, who has studied Hebrew sources fornumerology in Spain, explains that gematria’s influence is rare inCatalonia and had a “strong but limited influence on a number offigures in Castile” (95).27Abraham Abulafia (1240–1292) was another outstanding Spanish Cabbalist,famous for his attempt to convert the Roman Catholic Pope to Jewish mysticism.He was condemned to burn for this feat. However the Pope died unexpectedly,and Abulafia managed to escape. His most important work, Séfer ha-Tsérûf, treatsword-number symbolism. He was apparently not well understood by other Cabbalists(Tryon-Montelambert and Hruby 48–49).LUCAS_f3_31-58 8/19/03 10:01 AM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"591Made available in facsimile form by Archer Huntington (1905; Rprt. 1967).CHAPTER THREETHE PRESENT EDITIONOf making many books there is no end; and muchstudy is a weariness of the flesh.Ecclesiastes12:12A.Known Editions of theTractatThe Biblioteca de Catalunya in Barcelona houses the only extantcopy of the Tractat de prenostication de la vida natural dels hòmens, whichbears the catalogue signature Esp. 6–8°.

S is possibly incomplete, although neitherthe Colombine registrumnor Álvarez Seisdedos mentions this. Neitherdoes Álvarez Seisdedos mention other details of the format, such asthe number of lines on an average page. The variations in the incipitfor section two and the foliation suggest two different traditions; how-ever further archival evidence is necessary to substantiate this claim.B.Physical Description of “B”Edition B, the object of our study, measures 202 mm in length, 123 mm in width, and is 8 mm thick. The work has been recentlyrebound in brown leather with a gold border stamped on the out-side and inside covers. The leaves have been gilded as well. Theinside front cover bears the ex librisof Santiago Espona i Brunet(1888–1958), the Catalan bibliophile who previously owned the work.The incunable contains twelve unnumbered folios protected by fiveguard sheets. The guard sheets were added when the work wasrebound. The first folio is blank, and the work begins on 2r. Thereis no foliation in B. Pagination has been recently hand-written inpencil in the upper right hand corner of each page. The paper ishigh quality, and there are no stains. The book is in excellent con-dition except for fol. 12, which was torn and subsequently repaired.The repair was done carefully, and no text was lost or damaged.The text box measures 77 ×140 mm. The distance from the textbox to the top of the page varies from 10–20 mm because the textbox, in several cases (e.g. fol. 6r), was printed unevenly. A blankspace has been left for an initial on folio 2r. The work contains twoquires, signed “a” and “b”. Bohigas was the first to note an unusualpattern in the signatures, which he also observed in an edition ofthe Tractat sobre els novíssimsattributed to Eiximenis:En ambos impresos los cuadernos constan de ocho hojas y sólo estánsignados los folios 1 y 3 de cada cuaderno, el primero con el expo-nente 1 y el otro con el 2.

Esta manera singular de signar los cuadernos induce a pensarque cada uno de ellos se compone de dos medias hojas de papel, quese imprimió separadamente (1965a: 96).This assertion is not entirely accurate for the Tractat, which containstwelve folios. Bohigas had already provided the correct collation inhis first article on the work (1961: 59). In his original catalogue ofEspona i Brunet’s legacy, Bohigas had incorrectly listed the Tractatamong other printed works, non-incunable (1960).The quires are mostly likely formed from a single folio dividedinto fourths and a half folio divided in two. The half folio wasinserted into the quarter folio so that the first quire contains leaves1, 2, 5, and 6 and the second contains leaves 3 and 4. Folio 3rbearsthe catchword “aii” probably to indicate that it is the second foldin the quire.There is no color in B. A single gothic typeface is used through-out the text, and twenty lines measure 89 mm. The capital “M”shares features of M42 and M49 in Haebler’s Tipenrepertorium (1968).Bohigas originally classified the type as M42 89 mm but later decidedfor M49 (1961; 1965; 1965a). The capital ‘M’ used in the Tractatshares features of both of these prototypes. The collation and type-face led Bohigas to conclude that the Tractat de prenosticacionand theanonymous Tractat sobre els novíssims(pseudo-Eiximenis), which it resem-bles, both derive from the same printing tradition.C.Contents, Divisions, and SourcesThe Tractatis composed of two distinct parts: an astro-numerologicaltreatise and a brief essay on judicial astrology, which was appendedas an apology for the first section. This addendum contains a col-lection of astrological aphorisms and Biblical justification for the prac-tice of astrology. The entry for S in the registrumof books in theColombine library offers some evidence that the sections were inter-preted as two separate works during the sixteenth century. TheColombine registrumlists the second part as item aliusand records itsincipit and explicit separately (entry 3858). The two items wereintended to be read together because the second section refers tothe methodology used in part one, providing examples and theoret-ical justification for it.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"62 The bipartite structure is confirmed by the use of explicits or shortconcluding passages.

The final paragraph offers another conclusion,the explicit of the entire work, “E aquests prenòstichs són trets delssecrets dels philòsophs...” (fol. 12r).

The text mentions Ptolemyas a source in the second section, and most of the astrological ref-erences in the text follow the Ptolemaic system. In the second partof the work, however, the text incorrectly assigns Taurus to Marsand Venus jointly (fol. 3v). The text also breaks with the Ptolemaictradition in presenting the order of the planets in the first section.Planetary order indicates an underlying worldview, and each branchof astrology has its own tradition. Section one of the Tractatpresentsthe planets in the order of the days of the week, following the Hindutradition (Tester 166–67). This planetary order (Sun, Moon, Mars,Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn) contrasts with the Ptolemaic systembased on presumed distances from the earth in a geocentric universe(Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon) (Bouché-Leclercq107–08; Tester 4). This textual evidence suggests that at least twodifferent sources were brought together.The second part of section one begins “La planeta de Aries ésMars” (fol. 3r). It continues with a description of the physical andcharacter traits typical of those born under each of the twelve signsof the zodiac. The signs are given in the order in which they appearover the horizon, again following Ptolemy. For each sign, there is asection devoted to men and a shorter one devoted to women. Thedescriptions contain largely stock physiognomy from the Middle Agessuch as one finds in the Secreta secretorumtradition. Ptolemy discussesthe different factors that influence the masculine or feminine natureof the planets (Tetrabiblos3.6). However it is not common in theMiddle Ages of the Latin West to find character traits of individu-als born under the twelve signs of the zodiac divided by gender;rarely are women mentioned at all.The first few character descriptions cover approximately one anda half folios each. However the descriptions become shorter so that bythe last sign, Pisces, the space allotted to men is only fourteen lineslong. The female description extends to a mere eight lines. This may2Claudius Ptolemy (floruit100–178 AD) was the most influential classical sourcefor astrology and astronomy in the Latin West. His Tetrabiblosor Quadrapartitum, asit is known in Latin, was the “Bible” of astrology for centuries. It was reintroducedinto Europe in the twelfth century, when Arabic copies were translated into Latin.The original Greek MSS were not edited until the sixteenth century (Robbins inPtolemy 1989: x–xiv).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"64 help understand how the book was composed. The printer or compo-sitor cut some sections short as he ran out of space. The concludingparagraphs of each description suggest similar editorial intervention.The life prediction for each sign of the zodiac concludes with awarning that the individual should pray to or serve a specific saint.The material appears appended because it usually comes out of con-text to surrounding text and near the end of the concluding para-graph. Furthermore this caveatis often corrupt or missing entirely.In four cases, the saints are the same for men and women bornunder the sign in question. In eight cases the advice for men andwomen is different. Twice the woman’s saint is missing (Scorpio andSagittarius), and there are other anomalies.Women born under Gemini are told to serve the Holy Trinityrather than a specific saint. Women born under Virgo are advisedto serve the “gloriosas verges”, perhaps a reference to early virginmartyrs. The section for women born under Taurus appears to con-clude with the words “. . . seruesca a nostro senyor Déu. E viuràbeneuenturadament...” (fol. 4v). However the editor or typesetterseems to have changed his mind and added a few additional remarksand another concluding passage with slightly different advice, “eseruesca la gloriosa verge Maria e obuiarà als perills” (fol. 4r). Finallywomen born under Libra are so unfortunate that the text merelyadvises the reader to offer a candle for their souls on All Saints Day(fol. 7v–8r).In addition to being appended, the advice that individuals shouldpray to certain saints does not appear in any way related to the per-sonality traits described. Neither do the saints’ days coincide in thecalendar year with the astrological signs they are to protect. Forexample, males born under Capricorn are told to serve Saint Johnthe Baptist. Capricorn is a winter sign, ruled by the cold planetSaturn, whereas Saint John the Baptist falls on June 24. Because thedescriptions are shorter for women than men and the omissions cometowards the end of the work, the typesetter was probably attempt-ing to save space. However the shorter sections for women alsoreflect the misogyny typical of the time. In section one, the authortells us he will begin with men because they are nobler (fol. 3r). Thepresence of the saints also serves to lend religious support to the lifepredictions.Section one of the Tractatconcludes on fol. 10vwith some adviceon how to avoid making errors. We are told that the apparatus canLUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"  65only fail in three ways. One must be sure to get the correct namesfor the individuals in question. One should also take care to spell thenames correctly; finally one must avoid errors in addition or divi-sion. The text concludes with a warning that whoever uses the appa-ratus must carefully follow the instructions provided at the beginning.The original source for the astro-numerological treatise remainsunknown. Numerical systems for determining the birth sign existedin Europe from at least the ninth century. By the twelfth century,classical sources were slowly recovered and brought into the LatinWest through Arabic translation. Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew sourcesare all rife with number symbolism. The tradition is accretive, how-ever, and each new source borrows and reinterprets freely whateverprevious material was available. For this reason lines of transmissionare difficult to establish with certainty.Manuscript evidence does demonstrate some of the source mate-rial available in Catalonia throughout the fifteenth century. In chap-ter 2, we examined a codex dubbed Tencar, which constitutes thefirst summary of astrological material known in Catalan. The textdates from the mid-fifteenth century (Vela Palomares 1997: 188–191).The Tencartexts incorporate a combination of judicial and medicalastrology and talismanic magic. The Tractat, although based on adifferent system of prognostication, falls within the same tradition.The third part of Vela Palomares’s miscellany draws on AbùMas\"har(787–886 AD). His direct influences are Persian, Greek (Neo-Platonic),and Indian (Vela Palomares 1997: 143–44). A minor treatise, attrib-uted to AbùMas\"har, contains an astro-numerological apparatus sim-ilar to the one found in the Tractat de prenostication (Faddegon 1928).In contrast to the pseudo-AbùMas\"har, where 1212 is the con-stant, the number twenty-eight figures prominently in the Tractat deprenostication. Like the order of planets alluded to in the first part ofthe Tractat, the choice of this number may derive from the Indiansystem of astrology. Indian astrologers based their calculations on alunar calendar, with twenty-eight or twenty-nine houses. This sys-tem found its way into Arabic texts on prognostication as well:Many Arabian astrologers adopted, as part of the electiones, the Indiansystem of twenty-eight lunar mansions, which afforded an opportunityfor more minute calculations than that of the twelve houses...Thissystem of lunar mansions could easily serve for magical purposes, andseems to have been in bad odor with Church writers.

The use ofthis number also links the text to the Arabic tradition, which pre-serves Indian astrological notions (Vela Palomares 1997: 143).The second section of the work begins: “Seguexan se altres prenos-tics generals als quals los homens són naturalment subiectas segonssentència de philosophs.” The explicit for this section and the entirework appears on fol. 12rwith this caveat:E aquests prenostichs són trets dels secrets dels philosophs, los qualstu, lector, si’ls entendràs no deurias obrir ne menys demonstrar pertal que dels homens indoctes per lur falsa e indocte experienca no vin-gan en derrisió. Ne deurian esser donats si no a carissims e doctesamichs. Amen. Deo gracias.The section contains a mix of astrological aphorisms and Biblicalreferences. The text mentions Ptolemy, Pythagoras, St. Gregory theGreat, and the Bible. Although the Tractatalso refers to talismanicmagic and draws on Arabic sources, none are cited.The section opens by relating the number of letters in a person’sname to whether the individual is born under the head, body, ortail of an astrological sign. Classical sources on astrology categorizethe signs of the zodiac in a number of ways. One method classifiesthe signs by their nature (masculine or feminine), their position (sit-ting or standing), whether the signs “love” or “hate” one another,etc. Ptolemy dismissed the naïvité of such descriptions in favor of aclassification scheme based purely on the geometric relationshipsamong the constellations (Bouché-Leclercq 152). The Tractat de prenos-ticationasserts that one can be born under the “head”, “body”, or“tail” of a given sign and that, furthermore, this determines the num-ber of letters one will have in his or her given name.The source for this passage is not clear. Ptolemy mentions thatthe individual stars within a constellation may have influences sim-ilar to those of the five planets. For example, the stars in the headof Aries exert a power similar to Mars and Saturn. Those in themouth act like Mercury with a hint of Saturn, while those in thehind leg operate like Mars and those in the tail like Venus (Tetrabiblos1.9). Ptolemy does not appear altogether convinced by the argument,which he attributes to his ancient predecessors. Bouché-Leclercqbelieves this division of the astrological signs into parts attenuatesthe overall power of the sign in question (132, note 1).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"  67Bouché-Leclercq attributes the division of astrological signs to theless scientific and more esoteric branches of astrological magic. Hebelieves minor astrologists copied the drawings of the signs found inManilius.3These drawings were incorrect and subsequently modifiedand subdivided by other astrologers. Some of the material in sec-tion two of the Tracat de Prenosticationprobably draws on a minortext on astrological magic that was subsequently lost. The origin formaterial is Arabic. The references to talismanic magic, the order ofthe planets, and the use of the lunar number 28—taken together—confirm this suspicion.Whatever its origin, the notion that the position of the starsinfluences the number of letters in one’s name is a circular one, andit undermines the argument developed in the first section. Either thenumerical value of the names determines the birth sign, as in sec-tion one, or the birth sign determines the number of letters in one’sname, as in section two. This confusion provides further evidencethat more than one primary source was used. To determine whetherone is born under the head, body, or tail of a given sign, one wouldneed some system of natal astrology capable of generating a birthchart. Numerical systems of determining the birth sign based on thevalue of names were designed to provide a simpler method that didnot depend upon such specialized knowledge.The text does not provide references to support the claim thatthe letters in one’s name determines the birth sign. However theTractatoffers examples of Catalan names that demonstrate the prin-ciple. Supposedly if the mother and son are both born under thecap, or head of the sign, they will have the same number of lettersin their given names. The text provides Johanand Leonaas exam-ples. The reader is warned that those who are born in the head ofan astrological sign will be weak and poor (fol. 11r).Those born in the cohaor tail of the sign will have more lettersin their name than their mother. Arnauldand Guineserve as exam-ples in this case. Curiously, the author borrows another astrologicalterm here and states that those born under a retrograde constella-tion will be poor and unfortunate (fol. 11r). This reference comes3Manilius, one of the fathers of Greco-Roman astrology, built on previous workby Ptolemy. His astrological textbook, written in verse (c. 553 BC), was first editedin the Latin West in 1579 (Bouché-Leclercq x).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"68 entirely out of context as it derives from traditional natal astrology.4Finally if the mother’s name has more letters, this means she is bornin the ventreor belly of the sign. This is the most favored position,as those born in the belly of a sign will be prosperous throughouttheir lives (11r). There is no example for this case.The paragraphs of the text immediately following this discussionhave a precedent in Arabic sources. The text informs us that theupright signs or signes dretswill always be dominant: Cancer, Leo,Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius. Signes prostrats, prostrate signs,are by nature weak: Capricorn, Aquarius, Piscis, Aries, Taurus, andGemini (fol. 11v). A selection from the Libre appellat Tencaruses thesame Catalan terminology as we find here. Vela Palomares cites theElements of Astrologyby Al-Bìrùnì5as a possible source (1997: 100).Having provided some scientific authority, the text concludes withBiblical and patristic citations in support of prognostication. Thesefinal paragraphs function as an apology, lending theological author-ity to the material the text exposes. Even the Neoplatonic and human-istic texts on astrology dating from the Italian Renaissance are fullof such theological apologies. The Renaissance mage, Marsilio Ficino,begins his third book of De vita on celestial influence and astrologi-cal magic with this justification: “In omnibus quae hic aut alibi ame tractantur, tantum assertum esse volo, quantum ab ecclesia com-probatur” (1989: 240).Our text refutes the two most important theological critiques ofastrology, magic, and other forms of prognostication. The notionthat stars, fate, or numbers control one’s destiny and that the indi-vidual is powerless to change his fate is the most severe breach withChristian theology. The second charge of heresy is that prognosti-cation places the role of nature above God, thus subverting divineauthority. Any system of prognostication, to be acceptable in aChristian framework, must not infringe on divine order or impedethe individual from freely choosing to follow or to reject this order.4Planets that appear to move backwards were said to be in retrograde. Thisreverse movement was considered a negative omen. The effect is an optical illu-sion produced by the individual planets’ differing orbits around the sun. Believingthat the universe was geocentric, the ancients needed a complex system of epicy-cles to explain this movement. See Bouché-Leclercq (110–121).5Al-Bìrùnì(floruit1000 AD) was one of the most influential astronomers to writein Classical Arabic, although he also produced works on judicial astrology and astro-logical magic.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 68"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"  69The text provides a solution to both of these problems, first throughan “escape clause” to allow room for the exercise of free will. Theproblem of free will is most clearly resolved with the aphorism “lohome savi senoragarà els astres” (fol. 12r). This is a Catalan trans-lation of the old saw “homo sapiens dominabitur astris”, attributedto Ptolemy. The texts expands on the notion that the “wise manwill rule the stars” with this gloss:Així, emperò, com la natural disposició ha donats e dona infortunissegons quedemont és dit, usant de molta sauiesa per obuiar a ditsastres e infortunis e aquells subiugar ho fugir ha volguda demonstrarla manera e medicina per aquells squiuar (fol. 11v).Magic, the text explains, is a useful way to thwart the negativeinfluence of the stars.In its most common form, astrological magic is channeled throughtalismans, amulets, precious gems, and plants. Prayers and otherChristian incantations were thought to increase the effect. The textoffers the Libre de la proprietat de las cosasas a source, undoubtedly areference to the De proprietatibus rerumby Bartholomaeus Anglicus.This miscellany of popular science was written in the thirteenth cen-tury, and it immediately became a “best-seller”. The first Spanishtranslation was produced by Heinrich Mayer in Toulouse, 1494.There is no evidence that a Catalan edition of this work existed,although the Tracatrefers to it in Catalan. The use of objects foundin nature forms a part of white magic (See chapter 2, section A).This sort of magic is a precursor for natural science because it seeksto manipulate the forces of nature without appeal to superior beingsor demons. The use of talismans is less clear, and the debate aboutits use fills many Renaissance volumes (e.g. book three of Ficino’sDe vita libri tresand Torrella’s De imaginibus astrologicis).6The second section concludes by emphasizing God’s power overthe stars, a position supported by Biblical citations. The text firstrefers to Psalm 74, which states that God created the sun and moonto rule day and night. God is in control of the stars and offers themas signposts or warnings. St. Gregory’s homily on Matthew 2 ex-plains the role of the stars in greater detail. This chapter of the Bible6For an excellent edition of De vita, see Kaske and Clark (Ficino 1989). No mod-ern edition of Torrella exists.

However the Tractatsubverts the homily and usesit to justify the practice of prognostication. St. Gregory affirms thatGod chose a star to announce Christ’s birth because the gentileswould not have been capable of understanding a message deliveredby an angel (1958: 571). St. Gregory further notes that, accordingto Matthew 2, the star rose in the heavens slowly until it reachedBethlehem, where it stopped over Christ’s birthplace. He offers thisas proof that the star was controlled by Christ and followed Him.In no way did Christ follow a destiny previously marked for Himin the stars.7But if we meditate upon the words of the gospel, in which of this verystar it is said: until, arriving above the child’s location, it stopped.Thus, it was not the child who hastened to the star, but the star thathastened to the child. To be sure, the star was not the child’s destiny,rather the newborn child was the destiny of the star [translation mine].The text glosses this passage: “Lo home no va al astre mes lo astreva al infant nat” (12r). However, instead of using it against astrol-ogy, the Tractat offers the passage as proof that prognostication isnot in disaccord with Christian theology.8God created the sun andmoon to rule over day and night. These physical phenomena helpearly scientists mark time, forecast the weather, predict the changeof seasons, and even develop the ecclesiastical calendar.Only indirectly can the stars can influence human beings, in asmuch as they transmit God’s divine influence. The text uses Psalm136 to demonstrate that the stars do indeed transmit this influence,although humankind can use prayer and magic to escape harmfulinfluences of the stars. The passage reads, “Perque és manifest que7“Sed si euangelii verba pensamus: quibus de eadem stella dicitur: usque dumveniens staret supra ubi erat puer. Dum non puer ad stellam: sed stella ad puerumcucurrit. Si dici liceat, non stella fatum pueri: sed fatus stelle is qui apparuit puerfuit.” (Pastoralis sancti Grecorii pape1493: fols. 50r–50v, transcription mine).8Cecco d’Ascoli was burned at the stake in 1327 for predicting Christ’s birthby means of the stars. In part, the heresy lay in the claim that Christ’s life wassubject to the star or a constellation containing the star that announced his birthin Matthew 2 (Thorndike 4: 322).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"  71lo cors humà és regit per los cosors sobre celestials per ordinació deDéu, influints en los terranals axí com diu lo psalmista” (12r). Psalm135 briefly refers to the power of the sun, moon, and lesser celes-tial bodies. The Tractatimplies that prognostication is a harmlessmanner for understanding God’s will by examining the world Hecreated.A close reading reveals that the justification for astrology as exposedhere is akin to the Neoplatonic worldview we find fully developedand full of nuance in the Italian Renaissance. In Neoplatonic lan-guage, everything in the natural world is sentient. The anima mundior world soul surrounds and infuses all of nature, which in turn iscomposed of lesser forces. The text licenses this sort of animismdirectly by stating that nature disposes certain things such that manmay not demand further explanation (fol. 11v).9In Renaissance cosmology, the planets themselves are living beings,lesser life forces (see chapter 1, section A). It is only natural thatsuperior celestial forces influence inferior earthly ones. Careful useof Biblical and patristic sources justifies this cosmology, for God isthe ultimate spiritual force. The human soul is a platonic middleterm, mediating earthly and celestial forces. Only humankind hasdirect access to God through prayer and supplication and to lesserspirits through natural magic and prognostication.This short section also challenges the modern reader because itbrings together many pieces of prognostic science without an appar-ent logical order. Scholars have dismissed works of prognosticationas “fossilized mumbo-jumbo” for this reason (Tester 97). Far frombeing a fossilized relic, the Tractat de prenosticationhelps scholars under-stand the state of the prognostic arts in the late Middle Ages andits role in popular culture. The contents found in section two of theTractatdemonstrate, for example, that both standard texts and eso-teric Arabic material had been sufficiently absorbed into the cultureto influence the popular mind.9There are of course two worldviews at work here. The notion that man shouldnot delve too deeply into the inner workings of nature is medieval. Too muchcuriosity borders on the sin of vanitas. As St. Augustine puts it, “Let not man say‘What is this? Why is that’ Let him not say it, let him not say it; for he is man”(Confessiones 7.6.10). This view contrasts neatly with the aphorism, “The wise manwill rule the stars”, also found in the text.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"72 The need to support or refute theories of prognostication withBiblical passages also demonstrates that astrology and astrologicalmagic continued to be taken seriously. That the passages come tous in a jumbled or confused manner only strengthens the claim thatthey were common currency and could be easily recycled and reusedon an ad hocbasis. The Tractat de prenostication uses commonplaces ofastrology from several traditions to justify an entirely different sys-tem of prognostication based on numerology and numerological sym-bolism. All of this is placed in the framework of Christian theologyin a unique manner.The defense of astrology outlined in the second half of the Tractatde prenosticationhelps us locate the text historically. The lines of argu-mentation used there foreshadow the cultural revolution that wouldbring a revalorization of magic and experimental science in theRenaissance. Italian astrologers such as Marsilio Ficino first work outthis Neoplatonic and humanistic cosmology in the late fifteenth cen-tury. Garin finds this new worldview fully developed in the sixteenthcentury and uses Tommaso Campanella to sum up the three keypropositions of this system:1. All sciences serve magic in as much as any practical art seeks totransform or control nature.2. The mystery of the mage disappears as science advances.3. Despite the second proposition, the deepest mysteries are still shroudedin magic. (1984: 199–216)The Tractatillustrates the growing acceptance of magic and its incor-poration into popular culture in a number of ways. First it makes amagical or supernatural system accessible in the vernacular language.It demystifies the astro-numerological system by hinting that prog-nostication, although powerful, is just another means for under-standing nature. God controls the natural world and provides signs,in the form of the stars, to guide and shape humankind. The wiseman, through his ingenuity, the use of magic, and other forms ofapplied science, controls the stars. However magic and applied sci-ence have their limits, and God’s mysteries remain intact. As thetext asserts, some things can never be known: “la qual cosa es cau-sada per la disposició de natura, disposant las cosas mundanals perquè algú no pot saber ho demanar més larga rahó” (11v).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"  73D.Linguistic Features and OrthographyEarly incunables often present a palimpsest effect whereby closeinspection reveals multiple layers of language that may help distin-guish the language of the edition from that of its source material.The Tractat de prenosticationis written in a simple, colloquial style witha patina of learned vocabulary and syntactic forms. The text pre-sents at least three layers of accretion: archaisms, colloquial dialectfeatures, and learned rhetorical and stylistic devices. Archaic vocab-ulary items and grammatical forms reflect earlier source material.Colloquial vocabulary, the leveling of atonic /a/ and /e/, and thesimple style portray the dialect of the editor. Finally there is evi-dence of the humanistic style imported from Italian models in thelate fifteenth century.Examination of the typeface and layout of the incunable revealthat the edition was produced in the late fifteenth century. Thedialect features, typical of eastern varieties of Catalan from the latefifteenth century, support this conclusion. Since humanistic rhetoricwas not fully manifest until this time, we can conclude further thatthe Latinate style and the colloquial dialect are coeval. The authoror editor, who may have been the same person, most likely incor-porated a new style of prose that he had seen in other texts.The ornate style of the humanists is not well integrated; the effectis similar to that produced when a young writer abuses the thesaurusor the dictionary. The subject-verb inversions are forced, and theLatinate vocabulary seems carelessly appended. In any case, thehumanistic program arrived late to Catalonia, and is perhaps firstmanifest in the last quarter of the fifteenth century (Nadal and Prats2: 392). King Alfons IV of Catalonia (i.e. Alfons V of Aragon,1416–1458) patronized the arts, and under his care Catalan lettersexperienced a short-lived rebirth. Petrarch and Dante were bothknown in Catalonia in the fifteenth century, and their influence onCatalan letters has been studied extensively elsewhere (Rubió iBalaguer 1984–86, 1: 283–299).By the end of the fifteenth century, the fight against the vulgarlanguages had been lost. The later humanists changed the course oftheir program, and tried to dignify the common speech by fixingorthography and grammatical standards, normally following Latinmodels (Nadal and Prats 2: 349). The first grammars and style man-uals of European languages date from the fifteenth and sixteenthLUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"74 centuries. Nebrija’s 1492 grammar of Spanish was the first of theseprojects.The Tractatshows many examples of humanistic influence. Mostnotably, we find many instances of inversion and verb final con-structions: Lo qual signe si diligentment quolseuol experimentador inuestigarvolrà; E aquell signe, a tu demonstrat per dit nombre, pendràs; Entre auari-ciosos res no conseruarà, etc. There are a few instances of embeddedsentence structures:Axi, emperó, com la natural disposició ha donats e dona infortunissegons quedemont és dit, vsant de molta sauiesa per obuiar a ditsastres e infortunis e aquells subiugar ho fugir, ha volguda demonstrarla manera e medicina per aquells squiuar. (fol. 11v)These ornate constructions constrast with the endless stacks of com-pound sentences joined by e or et, a feature of medieval prose.Since the invention of printing, Catalan was one of the most con-servative and uniform early Romance languages (Milà Segarra inNadal and Prats 2: 567). There were many minor Nebrijasin theCatalan tradition; however normalization of the language was notcomplete until the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. By the fifteenthcentury however, the most important linguistic processes had beencomplete, and we can observe the beginnings of this normalizationin the Tractat.The text is surprisingly conservative in orthography. The letter“v” is used to represent the vowel /u/ (vnt, vsant) or the labial /b/(viurà; vendrà). The grapheme “u” regularly represents a semi-vowel /w/ (haurà) or the fricative /ß/ (quolseuol, seruesca). There issome variation in the use of “e” and “a”, which reflects a neutral-ization of these vowels, typical of the dialect used in composing theedition.In terms of lexical and phonological features, the Tractatbelongsto a rural eastern Catalan dialect from the late fifteenth century. Forexample, the text provides evidence for the phonological leveling ofatonic /e/ and /a/ < V. L. /a/, /e/, and /e/, common in thisregion. The complex process that affected the reflexes of open andclose /e/ essentially happened in two phases. The first phase involvedthe neutralization of the vowels in atonic position. A chain shift thenoccurred in the tonic series.Subsequently the closing of /°/ and the opening of /é/ via thetransitional vowel /•/ were set in motion to avoid a near mergerLUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"  75of these vowels. The weak articulation of the vowels and strong artic-ulation of the consonants is typical of eastern Catalan dialects.Compare items such as optenirfor obteniralso present in the Tractat,for example. Greater articulatory tension, when applied to the con-sonants, results in the devoicing of the voiced stops in certain envi-ronments. The changes that produced this neutral vowel /•/ wereprobably complete by 1000 AD; Rasico demonstrates that thegraphemes “e” and “a” were used interchangeably in manuscriptsfrom as early as 854 AD (19).This neutral vowel /•/ provided fuel for subsequent changes inthe tonic series /é/ and /°/. The first step in this process producedthree tonic vowels: /°/ > /é/ and original tokens of /é/ > /•/.The open vowel /°/ retained its timbre in certain phonetic envi-ronments (e.g. before /ä/, /®/, /r/ + non-labial consonant, /n ́r/,and /l/). Finally /•/ > /°/, a change which was complete by theend of the fourteenth century (Gulsoy 68–9; 96).These changes are reflected in writing by the confusion of the let-ters “a” and “e”. The leveling of atonic /a/ and /e/ began first inpost-tonic position, evident in verb forms and feminine plurals ofadjectives and nouns. The Tractatis generally conservative in spelling:18 cases of moltas, none of moltes; 2 examples of totesagainst 18 oftotas. Nevertheless one also finds: cares, dies (6),donades, dones(2),per-aules, stranyes, viandes. The preference for diesis undoubtedly due tothe Latin model, which is spelled the same in both languages. Wealso find an occasional use of “a” to represent “e” as in anamorat.The labialization of /a/ after initial /kw-/ is another dialect fea-ture. Although Catalan traditionally retains /kwa/ (viz. quatre< V. L.*QUATTRU,qualsevol< V. L. *QUALE SI VOLET,quan < C. L.QUANDO), some examples of velarization appear in Old Catalan(e.g. còtre for quatre, còrtfor quart, and cònfor quan) (Gulsoy 240). Thisdevelopment supposes a transitional stage: /kwa/ > /kwo/ > /ko/.Evidence of /kwo/ is found in rural dialects of eastern Catalan, andthere are examples in the Tractat: quoseuol, quorante/a(2), quotra(3),quont(3), quontas. Already in the fifteenth century, this pronunciationwas considered incorrect and uneducated (Badia i Margarit 1984:130). Hypercorrection based on Latin models such as quoniammayalso be at work. A similar process holds for initial /gw-/: /gwa/ >/gwo/ > /go/ as in guardar> gordar ‘to watch’; ‘to be wary’, thelatter form common in the Tractat de prenostication.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 75"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"76 Several vocabulary items further illustrate the colloquial nature ofthe text. Normal evolution of FÈDÕLIS produced feelin Old Catalan.Later the learned form fidelwas restored. The dissimilation repre-sented by faeland faeltat, found throughout the Tractat, is typical ofeastern Catalan, but may merely be a graphic representation of feel(DECat 3: 918–9). One also finds lauons, a dialectal form of llavors(Cf. Fr. lors, Occ. laors) < V. L. *ÈLLÌS HÒRÌS ‘in those hours’.The form in -nswas not common until c. 1400–1450 and appearsby analogy to other plurals in -ns, e.g. mà/mans(DECat 5: 112–16).The form llavonsis found in both central and western dialects today.The neologism frement‘roaring’ or ‘growling’ < L. FRÕMÕRE‘growl’, helps to date the Tractat. Coromines notes that the item is“. . . molt rar antigament, si bé n’hi ha algún cas espars a la fidel’edat mitjana”. The first citation is from 1480–1490 (DECat 4:192–4). Another neologism, prompte‘visible’; ‘manifest’ < C. L.PRÒMPTUS ‘idem’ confirms the date of the Tractat. The first reli-able documentation is from Eiximenis, Llibre de les dones, late fifteenthcentury (DECat 6: 824).Archaisms in the Tractateither reflect earlier source materials ora tendency to imitate older models. Since the stylistic innovations inthe text generally follow the Latinate prose of the early humanists,it is unlikely that these older forms were used deliberately to givethe text greater authority. They may reflect variants from earliersource materials or manuscript witnesses, now lost. Linguistic relicsin the Tractatfall into three classes: lexical items, the verb-complementnexus, and split futures.There are few archaic lexical items in the Tractat. The indefinitepronoun altri< *ALTERÌ(dat.) V. L. was common throughout theMiddle Ages, but was gradually replaced by algú(DECat 1: 237). Itis more commonly found after the dative preposition a, and mayhave been somewhat archaizing by the late fifteenth century.There are a few lexical borrowings in the Tractat. One finds leugier< *LEVARIUS, which is documented in the thirteenth century. Thestandard form is lleuger, and the diphthong either represents an ear-lier stage of language or influence from Occitan (DECat 5: 181).Along the same lines, one finds falsier. This form is also found inEiximenis, but it is not common thereafter (Alcover and Moll 5:716). Finally one finds antós, not documented in DECat or Alcoverand Moll. The word may be a borrowing from Provençal, meaning‘shameful’ or ‘dishonorable’. However the sense is ‘stubborn’ or ‘head-LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"  77strong’, so the term may be a neologism built upon Catalan entostand entost de‘instead of ’; ‘as opposed to’ (DECat 3: 393). The verbantostar‘to oppose’ < L. ANTE + OBSTARE may also provide someadditional influence (DECat 5: 403). Since the majority of the lexi-cal and phonological features of the Tractatbelong to eastern varietiesof Catalan, we can conclude that these Franco-Provençal borrow-ings represent an earlier stage of the language. Many Franco-Provençalwords derive from the troubadorpoetic tradition from the twelfth andthirteenth centuries.The pronoun-object complement nexus also represents an earlierstage of the language. Customarily the object complements precedetheir verbs: Aprés ly morrà son pare; E la terça muller lo soterrarà. Inperiphrastic constructions, one finds instances where the complementis placed between the conjugated verb and the infinitive: Yo desig hosaber(Moll 232). Rarely does one find the complement placed betweenthe verb and the past participle. The Tractatemploys this construc-tion, especially with the indirect complement: serà lli donada, seran llidonats. One also finds a rare case in which the complement followsthe conjugated verb: E aprés peruindrà ly la heretat del pare e mare. Thesecontructions may also represent an earlier stage of the language.They may also fit under the rubric of Latinizing influence discussedpreviously.E.ProvenancePrinted works of the incunable period (pre-1500) rarely included titlepages nor did they customarily bear printer’s marks. About two-thirdsof the incunables catalogued to date have some form of colophonat the end, a device copied directly from medieval manuscripts(Geldner 188). The colophon, in theory, registers important infor-mation about the origin of the work. Nevertheless some incunablesmerely repeat information from the manuscript colophon or anotheredition. Additionally, many incunables with a colophon fail to recordsuch key data as the author, printer/editor, place, or date of pub-lication.10The Tractatand other popular works of prognostication10Odriozola (1975; 1976) uses the term “proto-incunables” to refer to worksprinted before 1479 and which do not contain foliation or signatures.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"78 were not designed to be masterpieces of scholarship and do not showthe care taken in producing editions of more learned works.The Tractat, like many Spanish and Catalan incunables, has nocolophon or device to indicate the origin of the work. Scholars ofincunables, during the nineteenth century and the first half of thetwentieth century, used features of the typeface and watermarks inthe paper to identify the printer and place of publication, especiallyin difficult cases. Both of these approaches are helpful, but they arefraught with theoretical problems and do not usually produce a sat-isfactory result by themselves. A close study of the incunable includ-ing archival records, internal historical evidence, and linguistic cluesis necessary to understand the work’s origin and its place in history.Pere Bohigas was the first to describe and classify the B editionof the Tractat, which he labeled “un breu tractat astrològic” (1965:77). The work appeared during Bohigas’s tenure as archivist at theDiputació de Barcelona. The late Sr. Santiago Espona i Brunet(1888–1958) donated his library of manuscripts and incunables tothe Catalan government for its library. Bohigas undertook to clas-sify and describe the materials Espona had donated (1960).Bohigas remarked that Espona lived in relative obscurity and didnot appear often in public (1960: 6). He seemed to collect worksthat were of exceptional quality, rarity, or which were unique copies.The collection contained eleven manuscripts, all books of hours.Additionally there were forty incunables on virtually every topic imag-inable and a vast array of other works printed from the sixteenthto the twentieth centuries. Espona collected works in many languages,but Latin, Catalan, and Spanish predominate. Bohigas speculatesthat Espona built his collection especially from works not housed inpublic libraries so that his legacy would be more useful (1960: 6).No previous catalogues of Spanish incunables (GW, Haebler1903–07, Hain, Pellechet, Proctor) mentioned the Tractat, and Bohigaspresumed that B was a unique copy. Avenoza and her team of schol-ars uncovered a reference to the S edition of the Tractatin theColombine collection while working on the Bibliografia de textos cata-lans antics (BITECA), a recent and on-going electronic catalogue ofHispanic texts.Bohigas was also the first to study the provenance of the Tractat,which he did according to traditional methods, through an exami-nation of the typeface, collation, and signatures (1961; 1965; 1965a).Bohigas initially claimed the typeface either belonged to the CatalanLUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"  79editor, Mateu Vendrell, or the Catalan printer, Pere Posa.11Howeverhe would eventually claim that the Tractatbelonged to the small col-lection of incunables in the Hispanic Languages that Heinrich Mayer12produced in Toulouse from approximately 1484–1494. The Bibliotecade Catalunya and subsequent Spanish catalogue entries for the Tractatpreserve this claim (García Craviotto 2: 278).No further scholarship has come to light since Bohigas completedhis initial work on the Tractat. However careful study of his schol-arship and the Tractatraises four issues that make an attribution tothe Mayer press difficult. Bohigas based his claim primarily on acomparison of the typeface in the Tractatto that found in two otherincunables, neither of which bears any indication of the printer orplace of publication. Neither did Bohigas take into considerationinternal linguistic evidence, such as the dialect used in the Tractat.Bohigas was also unaware of the S edition of the Tractatand, assuch, did not have as much archival data at his disposal. FinallyBohigas did not adequately consider the genre of the Tracatand itspossible target audience when he attributed it to the Mayer press.Before drawing any preliminary conclusions, we will consider eachof these issues in turn.Bohigas’s assertion that Heinrich Mayer is responsible for print-ing the Tractatrests primarily on the classification of the typeface.Bohigas used a methodology devised primarily by Robert Proctor andKonrad Haebler at the turn of the century (Proctor 1960 [1898–1903];Haebler 1905–1924; Haebler 1995 [1925]). Haebler built on Proctor’swork for the library of the British Museum, carefully studying andclassifying as many incunables as were available to him. He deviseda basic classification of gothic typefaces according to the size andfeatures of the capital “M”, which he believed to be one of the mostdistinctive letters in gothic type. This methodology also forms thebasis for the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke(GW), one of the most11Mateu Vendrell appears in the colophons of two works produced in Gironaand Barcelona between 1483–1484. Haebler considers him a printer (1897), butmodern scholars (Vindel 63; Delgado Casado 2: 702) consider him and editor orpromoter. Some speculate that he owned his own equipment, including the type-face, since the same font is found in Girona and Barcelona within a short spaceof time. Given the similarity of typefaces, he may even have worked with PerePosa, although this is speculation (Delgado Casado 2: 703, n. 257). Also note thatPosa is sometimes spelled “Posas”, “Poses”, or “De la Posta”.12Also known as Henricus Mayer, Enrique Mayer, Enrique Alemán. Alternatespellings of the last name, e.g. “Mayer” and “Meyer”, are found as well.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 79"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"80 ambitious catalogues of incunables undertaken to date, although ithas not yet been completed. The Haebler-Proctor method was wellknown in England, France, and the United States. However it wasnot widely disseminated in Spain, where Bohigas was one of the fewSpanish scholars to apply the method.13In summary, the Haebler-Proctor method is based on careful meas-urement in millimeters of twenty lines of text and subsequent cate-gorization into one of four families of gothic type. Roman typefacesare more difficult to categorize, but there is a separate system forthem as well. The correct measurement of the text is critical to thesystem and can affect the assignation of the text to one workshopor another. Humidity and other climactic considerations can affectthe paper and distort the type. I have examined several incunablesclassified under the Haebler-Proctor system and found variations inmeasurement of 1–5 millimeters.14Once the measurement and fam-ily of type is known, one compares the capital “M” to the 102 pro-totypes collected in the Tipenrepertorium(Haebler 1905–1924; MartínAbad in Haebler 1995: 133–34). These prototypes are organizedaccording to size, country, and printing workshop.The methodology rests on the assumption that early printers wereresponsible for all aspects of printing including the design and cast-ing of the typefaces, assembly of the printing press, etc. The methodo-logy also assumes these master craftsmen maintained distinguishingcharacteristics of their work throughout the incunable period so thattypeface and layout remained a reliable method of distinguishing oneworkshop from another. While this may be true of the first Germanprinters, by 1480–1490 there is archival evidence that printers sold,hired out, or willed their equipment to other printers (Martín Abadin Haebler 1995: 137). Other problems such as falsifications ofcolophons and copies of typefaces create additional problems for themethodology. Lastly, the situation of printing in Spain is much differ-ent from the one Haebler describes in Gutenberg’s Germany.13Although Haebler’s classification system was not known, his Bibliografía ibérica(1917), an early catalogue of Spanish and Portuguese incunables, was widely dis-seminated in Spain. Bohigas was at least partially successful in introducing Haebler’sclassification system, however. Antonio Odriozola states that he was doubtful of theHaebler-Proctor method and similar approaches until Bohigas convinced him of itsusefulness (1974: 284).14Although Haebler was aware of the problem, he did not offer any solutions,and it continues to impede successful application of the system (Haebler and Abad1995: 133).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 80"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"  81Printing arrived relatively late to Castile. Juan Parix (i.e. Paris) iscredited with producing the first book in Segovia,15where he workedfrom 1472 to about 1474. Foreign printers taught local craftsmenthe trade. Often these German and Dutch masters had previouslyestablished themselves in their native lands or had spent consider-able time working in other countries, such as France and Italy, beforearriving in Spain. Once they had established themselves, they oftenworked in partnership with local craftsmen. The first typefaces wereroman (Romero de Lecea 15). However in Catalonia, narrow gothictypefaces, characteristic of the first German printers, were employedalmost exclusively during the incunable period (Madurell Marimónand Rubió i Balaguer 58–59). There are many similarities amongthe typefaces of these early Catalan printers.Some of these foreign printers, such as Pedro Brun and JuanRosenbach, worked with more than one local printing house andtraveled from city to city (Delgado Casado 1: 94–97; 2: 610–13).Also there were relatively more editors and sponsors of editions inSpain than in Germany. Perhaps some of these editors, such asMateu Vendrell, owned their own equipment, including the typefaceused to print works at their expense. All of these details make theHaebler-Proctor method difficult to apply consistently and accurately.A full discussion and critique of this method is beyond the scope ofthis investigation; however the issues raised here cast sufficient doubtupon the methodology to limit its use as a basis for cataloguing aCatalan incunable such as the Tractat de prenostication.16Methodological questions notwithstanding, Bohigas did uncovertwo anonymous texts that employ the same typeface as the one wefind in the Tractat. The first codex contains the pseudo-EiximenisTract sobre els novíssims,17the earliest Catalan version of the Viatge alPurgatori de San Patrici by Ramón Perellós, and several other hagio-graphic and mystic texts.

Wittlin accepts Bohigas’s attri-bution of the work to Mayer outright because Bohigas had “provesa la mà” (152). Of this evidence, we will say more shortly. Wittlinadds that the Viagte al purgatori, another work in the incunable, is aCatalan re-translation of a Provençal translation made of an origi-nal Catalan document (152). This explains why Provençal dialectitems appear only in some parts of the codex and not others. Wittlindoes not question why a printer in the heartland of the Occitandialect group would go to such lengths to print the text in Catalan.18On this question, Wittlin only speculates:Ignorem si l’immigrant Heinrich Mayer creia que un llibre en catalàes podria vendre bé en els països de llengua d’oc, o si tota l’edicióestava destinada a l’exportació al sud dels Pirineus. En aquest cas,atribuir-lo a Eiximenis hauria estat un ardit comercial. (154)The second codex contains the Libellus somniorum interpretationebyArnau de Vilanova followed by anonymous treatise called De mutationeaeris. These Latin texts deal with the nature of dreams and visionsand their correct interpretation. The typeface is identical to the onefound in the Tractat sobre els novíssimsand the Tractat de Prenostication.GW, using the Haebler-Proctor methodology, attributes the Libellussomniorumto the Heinrich Mayer press in Toulouse circa 1485 (2:690–91). As Bohigas correctly notes, the quires are signed in a sim-ilar fashion to those in the Tractat (1965a: 96). However Bohigasgoes beyond the data available to him when he constructs a hypoth-esis for the origin of these three texts based solely on this evidence.The attribution of the Libellus somniorumin GW led Bohigas toassign both the Tractat sobre els novíssims and the Tractat de Prenosticationto the Mayer press. Furthermore, Posa merely extends the approx-18Occitan, virtually indistinguishable from Provençal, was spoken in medievalToulouse and the surrounding Languedoc region.

Today Catalan is spoken bysome nine million people in the Spanish community of Catalonia, the Principalityof Andorra, the French “Pyrenées Occidentales” region, and Ciutat d’Alguer inSardinia. There are ongoing efforts to revive Occitan and Provençal, although thesemovements have not experienced the widespread success enjoyed in Catalonia.

Bohigas did not personally examineany other Mayer texts. Thus all of this argument rests on the cat-alogue entry in GW, which attributes the typeface found in theLibellus somniorumto the workshop of Heinrich Mayer. However theGW and Proctor, upon which this catalog is based, are not consistent.Proctor also attributes the Libellus somniorumto Mayer but statesthat the typeface used in lines 1 and 4 of the incipit is Mayer’s TypeI and the typeface in the body is Type III (2: 631). In contrast, theGW says the text in the body of the Libellus somniorumcorrespondsto Mayer Type II. I have personally examined all three of the incun-ables in question. The typeface used in lines 1 and 4 of the incipitto the Libellus somniorumis a match or very near copy of the typeused in the incipit of the Tractat sobre els novíssims. The typeface usedin the body of these three texts is identical; however I have notfound an exact match for it either in Mayer or in any other earlyCatalan printer.19The Scotus pauperumof Guillermus Gorris also bearsno printing information, although it is attributed to Mayer’s pressas well (Pellechet n. 5282). Pellechet attributes the body text to MayerType III. The text in Scotusbears some resemblance to the text inthe body of the Tractat de prenostication. However the type in Scotusmeasures 69 mm for twenty lines of text instead of the 89–90 mmin the Tractat. Additionally, the Tractathas open capitals and thebody of the letters is generally thicker than in the Scotus.The capital “M” in the Tractatshares features of M42, attributedto Pere Posa and M49, attributed to Heinrich Mayer, but is not anexact match for either one. The typefaces used by Mayer and Posaare also similar to one another and to those of Vendrell and Spindeler,other Catalan printers. Any conclusion regarding the typeface usedin the Tractatmust wait until further study of early printers andarchival evidence about any possible relationships among them pro-vide a more solid foundation.20In the absence of such a study, inter-nal evidence is necessary to clarify the issues at hand.19I have not been able, however, to examine the entire corpus of works attrib-uted to Mayer.20Archival evidence suggests that Pedro Brun (also Bru) directed a printing soci-ety in Barcelona. Among others, Juan Rosenbach, Pedro Posa, and NicholausSpindeler collaborated in this society. Further documentation suggests individualpartnerships among some of these printers.

The dialectused in the Tractat de Prenosticationis standard Catalan (although some-what rural and archaizing for the time) from the late fifteenth cen-tury. During this period, literary Catalan had no national standard,and printed works often blended the dialects found in the originalmanuscripts with that of the typesetter or printer. If the text hadbeen typeset in Toulouse, one would expect to find some traces ofnorthern Catalan orthography or vocabulary. There are only a fewFranco-Provençal items, probably attributable to the twelfth and thir-teenth centuries when these linguistic groups exercised greater influenceon Catalan. They are few and stand out as archaic or unusual bycomparison to the rest of the text. The critical edition refers to anywords of probably foreign origin.As Bohigas notes, the codex containing the Tractat sobre els novís-simsand other mystery texts betrays some orthographic features ofProvençal. For example the palatal /ñ/ is represented by the digraph“ny”. There are also Provençal vocabulary items such as noyrit, layssa,aisi, meteyssa, mayti, coyssi, miegthat were not common to the Catalanof the time (Bohigas 1965: 98) One of the texts included in this col-lection is the Viatge al purgatori de San Patrici. The mostly likely man-uscript witness for this story was composed in the county of Rosselló(i.e. Roussillon), in the Northern Catalan dialect area (Miquel yPlanas 1911–14, 1: 229).Because some of these Provençal vocabulary items appear in theTracat sobre els novíssims, supposedly written by the Catalan, Eiximenis,Bohigas concludes that they reflect the dialect of the printer ratherthan the author (1965: 98). If the Tracat de Prenostication was alsoprinted in Toulouse, it should show traces of the Romance dialectspoken there. Not only does it fail to provide evidence of Provençalor northern Catalan influence; the text is replete with dialect fea-tures unique to eastern Catalan.Two objections to Bohigas’s claims about the origin of the textremain. Bohigas had incomplete archival evidence at his disposal,and what was available he failed to consider. Archival data on theTractatis still admittedly limited. However there are now two doc-umented copies of the text, and both were preserved in libraries inthe historic Catalan heartland. The B edition has been in a privatecollection or in libraries in Barcelona as long as it has been docu-mented.

Because the Tracat is written in simple, colloquiallanguage, it represents popular texts designed for local consumption,not for export. Had it been reedited, incorporated into subsequenteditions, or exported, we would expect to find some trace of the textin the archives. Popular texts, particularly almanacs, lunar calendars,and various forms of prognostication were rarely preserved. It wouldbe unlikely to find a work such as this far from its original place ofpublication, particularly in 1512, only fifteen to twenty-five yearsafter its initial publication.We have limited but useful data about the two printers Bohigascredited with producing the work: Henry Mayer and Pere Posa.Little is known about Henry Mayer, although archival evidence sug-gests that he enjoyed a large and profitable workshop at the begin-ning of his career in Toulouse. He accumulated many debts, however,and eventually died in poverty. No definitive history of the Mayerpress has been produced to date. We have similar documentationfor Posa, Catalonia’s first native printer, although no definitive studyof his workshop exists either.Mayer was not the first printer to arrive in Toulouse, a thrivinguniversity center and an entrepôt for German and Swiss printers pass-ing through France on their way to Spain.21The De fide instrumento-rum, dated June 20, 1476, is the first incunable to boast the nameof Toulouse. The typeface derives from Basel in Switzerland andmatches the font employed in two treatises with colophons linkingthem to Henry Turner, a printer from that location.22Turner workedfor a time in association with Juan Parix, the first printer in Castile,who fled to Toulouse under mysterious circumstances.23Parix is laterassociated with Henry Mayer.21For a general discussion of early printing in Toulouse, consult Desgraves (1976)and Dureau (1982–1989).22The De sponsalibus et matrimoniis, from the Summa theologica of St. Anthony ofFlorence, concludes with the initials HTDBMHO, and an edition of De Cessolis’smoralization on the game of chess bears the initials MHDB. These are held to be:Henricus Turner de Basilea huius operis and Magister Henricus de Basilea, respec-tively (Scholderer lxxi).23The archives of the Toulouse notaries have never been completely published.Odriozola uses some of this evidence to demonstrate that Henry Turner died inLUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 85"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"86 Henry Mayer set up shop in Toulouse, where he worked from atleast 1484 until his death in approximately 1499. He is referred toas German24and is said to have lived on Rue du Taur (Macaray246). In a public document, Mayer acknowledges a debt owed toAndré Fabre, a printer from Toulouse, for six years of work Fabrehad performed in Mayer’s shop. As the document bears the dateMarch 31, 1490, Mayer must have been working in the city fromat least 1484.25Six months later, André Fabre records his last will and testament,naming a religious brotherhood of the Saint Sernin monastery inToulouse as his only heir. Mayer intervenes, acknowledging the debtof 185 golden écusand 28 doubles, only to request an extension untilChristmas. On May 24, 1491, probably not long after Fabre’s death,we find Mayer in debtors’ prison at the instigation of the officers ofthe Saint Sernin society, his new creditors. Only through the timelyintervention of several friends, some of whom were printers andbookbinders, does Mayer extricate himself from prison. He finallysettles his debt with the aforementioned society on October 23, 1491(Macaray 248).We know that Mayer printed primarily legal texts in Latin andFrench. He also produced several treatises in Spanish, which occa-sioned a debate about whether the Tolosa found in his colophonswas modern day Toulouse, in the province of Languedoc, or thesmall town of Toloza in Navarre (Desbarreaux-Bernard, passim). Muni-cipal archives settled the question; Mayer worked in Toulouse, France.Although documents link Mayer to other printers who worked orToulouse before July 1477 (1975: 294–95), although Macaray cites another docu-ment from 1483 demonstrating that Turner was alive and working with Juan Parixat that time (244–45). As Odriozola observes, either there is a scribal error in thedocuments (or Macary’s transcription) or we have two Henry Turners (1975: 295).24Without further evidence, it is difficult to know precisely where Mayer camefrom. The records use the Occitan adjective alamanor the Latin alemanus, whichcould refer to anyone from a German-speaking territory. Brun suggests Mayer mayhave come from Basel (16), although he could be confusing him with Henry Turner,who arrived in Toulouse several years earlier and is more clearly linked with Basel.There certainly were numerous commercial ties between Toulouse and Basel. Athorough treatment of these ties has not yet been undertaken.25“. . . ratione et ex causa laboris sui officii impressure, ex hoc quia dictus AndreasFabri mansit cum dicto magistro Henrico Mayer per spatium sex annorum con-tinuorum et completorum in exercendo predictum officium impressure” (Cit. inMacaray 246).LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"  87lived in Spain at one time, we have no proof yet that Mayer everworked across the Pyrenees himself.Mayer’s name first appears in a colophon in 1488 (Scholdererlxxiii), and we have two other books from that year. Subsequently,Mayer seems to have collaborated with several other printers. OnFebruary 16, 1491, Mayer acknowledges another debt, this time toPierre Hongre, for reparations made to certain characters of type intheir workshop (Macaray 248). From 1492–1494, we have evidencethat Mayer contracted many laborers for periods ranging from threemonths to three years; clearly he boasted a thriving press (Macaray249; Scholderer lxxiii). There are, however, few extant works fromthis period.Mayer also produced several works in Spanish, including his mas-terpiece: an elaborate Spanish translation of De proprietatibus rerumbyBartholomaeus Anglicus (1494). He bought the paper for this mag-nificent work in 1493 and contracted the compositor, AmbroiseBrokseser, a few weeks later (Macaray 249; Scholderer lxxiii). Thearchives also indicate that Mayer again got himself into financialtrouble and had to cede 700 copies of this masterpiece to his papermerchant to liquidate his debts, although we do not know what per-centage of the print run this represents (Macaray 250; Scholdererlxxiii).The last documentary evidence of Mayer dates from 1501, whenhis press had been sold to liquidate his debts. Parix acquired hisprinting material, which he later sold (Macaray 250; Scholderer lxxiii).Odriozola suggests that Parix worked as Mayer’s editor (1975: 301),although he provides no evidence. The relationship between thesetwo printers needs further exploration. Certainly Parix could haveprovided Mayer with useful information on the Castilian market andperhaps linguistic help acquired during his stay in Segovia. Parixwas evidently financially successful, and he loaned money to severallocal craftsmen in Toulouse.Like Toulouse, Barcelona was already a thriving city with a bookculture before the art of printing itself arrived. The early Germanprinters offered the local booksellers, paper merchants, and othersinvolved in the trade an ever-increasing array of economic possibilities.Scholars credit Enrique Botel, a German printer, and his associateswith the production the first book, Aristotle’s Ethica ad Nicomachum,in 1473.

Posa moved to Barcelona sometime prior to 1481, when heproduced his first book in conjunction with the Savoyard or Germanprinter Pedro Brun. Like many others, Posa began his career as abookseller and continued to sell books from his shop throughout hiscareer. We have no documentation of any works that Posa producedbetween 1481 and 1484, although it is likely that he continued towork during this time (Madurell Marimón and Rubió i Balaguer203). Posa was active in the printing industry until 1505, the yearof his death (Delgado Casados 2: 558–59).Archival evidence suggests that Posa was a prolific printer andthat many of the popular works he produced are now lost. Posa’spossessions are partially documented in three places: a bill of sale,his last will and testament, and an inventory of personal effects pro-duced just prior to his death. In 1498, he sold a large collection ofbooks, parchment, bookbinding equipment, and other utensils toGaspar Mir and Antoni Vernet, young booksellers, for a modestsum. This document names many works of a popular nature thathave been lost: religious sayings, lunaris,28mystery texts, and worksof popular science (Madurell Marimón and Rubió i Balaguer 271–276).Although the Tractat de prenosticationdoes not figure in any of the26Documentary evidence confirms that Botel collaborated with Juan Planck andGeorgius von Holz in Barcelona at least as early as 1473. Botel’s signature isrecorded on another document in Barcelona 1476, where he is listed as magisterlibrorum de stampa. In 1476, He rented a house on Carrer Tallers in the same city.After Holz died, Botel and Planck renewed their business agreement in Zaragoza,1477. According to the first contract, Botel, the master craftsman, was to teach theothers the art of printing. The Ethica ad Nicomachum is the only extant work Boteland his associates produced in Barcelona. From 1476–1478 Botel worked in asso-ciation with the prolific Pablo Hurus from Konstanz and his former associate,Planck. Botel worked alone in Lleida from 1479 to 1495. See Sarriá Rueda (1993–96)and Peña Díaz (1997) for further discussion.27The booksellers’ guild was not founded until 1553 (Peña Díaz 45).28Popular calendars or almanacs were repositories of popular knowledge fromboth secular and sacred sources. The most famous of these is the Lunariby BernatGranollachs (floruit1400?), which was edited over sixty times in forty years.LUCAS_f4_59-91 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"  89available documentation, it does fit the type of work Posa producedand owned.Posa’s last will and testament and the inventory of possessions inPosa’s bookshop reveal that he owned a number of esoteric worksand works on popular science. It is difficult to ascertain, in somecases, which works Posa printed and which came from other presses.The inventory records a Latin manuscript copy of De proprietatibusrerum, which is referenced in the Tractatand another manuscript titledDe astronomia. Astrological material includes the following printedworks: Libre gros d’estrologia(not identified), a copy of the Tabulae direc-tionum in nativitatibusby Regiomontanus, and Ptolemy’s TetrabiblosinLatin. Lunarisand other popular works of scientific lore figure in thelists as well (Madurell Marimón and Rubó i Balaguer 404–433).F.TheTractat in the Catalan Printing TraditionThe Tractat de prenostication de la vida natural dels hòmensis one of fewpopular Catalan texts (the only one treating prognostication) thathave survived in incunable form. The narrow gothic typeface reflectsthe influence of the German and Dutch printers who brought thecraft to Catalonia towards the end of the fifteenth century. The highquality paper, lack of title page, colophon, or printer’s device, helpidentify the work as an incunable. The simple, colloquial languageof the text reflects linguistic changes in Catalan that were comingto fruition by the end of the fifteenth century. The orthographybetrays phonological leveling of unstressed /a/, /e/, and /e/, typi-cal of the central and eastern dialect groups.These characteristics help locate the Tractatin the incunable period.The popular nature of the treatise and the dialect point towards oneof Catalonia’s early native printers. The only Catalan printers thatowned their own presses in the fifteenth century were Pere Posa,Pere Miquel, and Gabriel Pou. These men all began work as book-sellers and gradually developed the printing craft (Madurell Mari-món and Rubió i Balaguer 58). Available archival evidence pointsto Pere Posa as the candidate most likely to have printed the Tractatde prenostication.Occasional hyperbaton and a few vocabulary items indicate thatthe Tractatparticipated in the humanistic style that was beginningto emerge on the cultural scene.

The Tractatsupports the position that prognostic scienceis not in disaccord with Church teaching, and this identifies it at thevanguard of cultural changes that entered Spain through Italy towardsthe end of the fifteenth century.G.The Present EditionThe critical edition suppresses editorial marks and includes modernpunctuation and accent marks to assist readers unfamiliar with OldCatalan. In some cases, monosyllables bear written accents evenwhen this is not standard practice. This is to avoid confusion, forexample between mes(conjunction), més(adverb), and mès(past par-ticiple of metre). Expansions of abbreviations are indicated in Italictype. Agglutination is indicated in two forms. An apostrophe indi-cates material missing from the first element: de altri\u0002d’altri. Araised period or punt volatindicates that material from the secondelement is agglutinated: si en\u0002si·n. Other editorial changes, addi-tions, or deletions are flagged with superscript letters and keyed toan apparatus at the end of the work.This system of presentation is designed to make the text usefuland accessible to a wide group of scholars. As such, the system gen-erally follows the guidelines set forth by other scholars of peninsu-lar Romance such as the Vela-Palomares edition of Tencar(1997)and the Delbrugge edition of the Reportorio de los tiempos(1999).Footnotes explain linguistic features, popular culture, scientific con-cepts, and primary sources used in the Tractat de prenostication.

Occasionally, this diph-thong suffers velarization and subsequent reduction: /wa/ > /wo/ > /o/. Althougha common process, educated authors condemned this pronunciation from the lateMiddle Ages onward. A fifteenth century MS from Valencia includes pronuncia-tions such as quottreand quoresmaamong examples of rural and uneducated speech(Badia i Margarit 1950–53, Part 1: 137–52).

The Latin compound AMBO DUOS, lit-erally ‘both’ and ‘two’, combines these near synonyms into a new word. The newcompound survives in Catalan most commonly as amdós. It appears from mid tolate fourteenth century, particularly in Eiximenis (viz. Dotzè del crestià). Endósis theetymological reflex; the /e/ is no doubt the result of phonological leveling of atonic/e/ and /a/ (see notes in chapter 3, above). The nasal assimilation is also etymo-logical: /m/ > /n/. Although commonly used, the fifteenth century Regles d’esqui-var vocablesfavors los dosover amendosos, another variant (Badia i Margarit 1950–53,Part 3: 147–48).

Manyforms show epenthesis of /d/: e.g. V. L. *TENIRE HAT > tenirà> tendrà.

Guardar still exists in the sense of ‘toguard’; ‘to keep’, although the reduced gordaris common in rural speech (DECat4:698–99). The labialization of /a/ here is similar to the process at work throughthe text for initial /kwa/: V. L. QUALE SI VOLET > qualsevol> quolsevol.

Several vari-ant forms competed for a time including: desset, deaset, and deïset. The modern formin eastern and central varieties presents reduction of the two vowels: diset. InNortheastern varieties, the /z/ is more resistent to change, and we find forms suchas dezeset, deseset, and desesset, particularly in Provençal. Modern Valencian preservesdesset, which shows characteristic reduction but no vowel raising. Coromines notesthat the two vowels in hiatus were particularly subject to dissimilation or other anti-hiatic changes in the eastern and central dialects (DECat 3: 106). The appearanceof dezeset here is most likely an archaism or a semi-learned form, consistent withthe other Latinizing characteristics found throughout.17als caps dels dits. ‘to the ends of the fingers’.

Although Gemini is traditionally represented by the twins or theglyph \u0002, there are so many contradicting traditions on talismanic magic that it isdifficult to ascertain which magical symbol this text is referring to.

The text reads “baronia del senyor”, which might mean“the barony of the lord” or “the lord’s manliness”. It could also refer to the “man-liness” or “nobility” of the fortune-seeker. However the text usually does not referto the fortune-seeker as senyor. The problem is the sense of the original Cat. baró‘nobleman, lord with feudal rights’; but also ‘virile man’; ‘man of great will’ (Ger.*BARO ‘a free man, skillful at arms’ > L. BARO, -ONIS ‘brutal man’; also ‘robustor hearty man’). Both readings are a bit odd, but there is not enough context tobe sure.

The verbal phrase seràn mesos agoytspresents two possible readings. Either serànmesosis a verbal phrase meaning ‘they (the travails) will be dealt to him’ or a verbwith the complement mesos‘months.’ The item agoytsin either case is probably anadj. meaning ‘ominous’; ‘cause for concern or vigilance’. Agoytsis not documentedpreviously in Catalan and, unless it is a printer’s error, most likely constitutes ahapax. For these reasons, the editor has not altered the original form of the phrase.The term agoytsis most closely associated to guaita n. ‘the act of watching or guard-ing’; ‘vigilance’; ‘those responsible for the watch’. This word derives from Frankish*WAHTA and is related to Ger. and Dut. wachtand Eng. watch. Documented fromthe thirteenth cent., this item occurs in many iterations: e.g. guaitm. ‘the watch’;guaitada‘act of watching’; guaitèsadj. (seventeenth cent.) ‘watchman’; aguaitar‘to lookout for’; guaita!‘look out!’, etc. It also occurs in place names (Alcover and Moll 6:431–32; DECat 4: 688). The diphthong /æi/ (e.g. in guaita!) represents dissimila-tion and is still commonly heard in rural speech throughout the Catalan heartland.55Note the use of the future tense instead of the subjunctive mood after thisadverbial of time. The text characteristically uses future after quan(passim).LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"131reaches the age of one hundred, his enemies will kill him.

The ending appears by analogy to other plurals in-ns, i.e. mà/mansand to other adverbs in -s. (DECat 5: 112–16).58retrogradant. adj. and gerund. ‘retrograde’. All planets except the sun and themoon appear to halt and then move backwards through the zodiac. This “retro-grade” movement was considered a negative omen. The effect is an optical illusionproduced by our changing earthly perspective of the individual planets’ orbits aroundthe sun. Believing that the universe was geocentric, Aristotle needed a complex sys-tem of epicycles to explain this movement. See Bouché-Leclercq for treatment ofretrograde movement in different schools of astrology (110–121).LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"133IIHere follow general prognostications that men are naturally subjectto as told by the philosophers.Philosophers such as Pythagoras and Ptolemy say that every sign ofthe zodiac has three faces—that is the head, the belly and the tail—under which each man is born. And this is how one finds out howmany letters a man will have in his name and how many his motherwill have. So the boy or girl born in the head of the sign, such asJohan the son and his mother Leona, will have the same numberof letters in their names. And those born in the head of the signwill be weak and poor.He who is born in the tail of the sign has more letters in hisname than his mother has, for example Arnaud the son and Guinethe mother. And this man, having been shown to be born in thetail of the sign of a retrograde constellation, will always be poor andunfortunate. If the mother has more letters in her name than theson or daughter, then it is demonstrated that the boy or girl is bornin the belly of the sign and that he or she will be rich in this worldand blessed, prospering always, in a sea of wealth.LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"134  Strologia encara més demonstra que lo qui serà nat sotz signesdirectes dominarà e senyoregarà los qui seran nats sots los signesprostrats.

Morelikely, however, it refers to Saturn or Mars. Ptolemy considered these planets themost universally malefic (Tetrabiblios1.5).61In contrast to the forward-looking defense of astrology captured in the proverb,“The wise man will rule the stars,” this passage presents a typically medieval viewof curiosity. Seeking to know the mind of God or to unveil the mysteries of cre-ation bordered on the sin of vanitas. In this passage of the Tractat de prenostication,one hears a faint echo of St. Augustine: “Let not man say, ‘What is this? What isthat?’ Let him not say it, let him not say it; for he is man” (Confessiones7.6.10).62se lig. v. pres. ‘one reads’. llegir inf. < C. L. LÕGÕRE ‘gather’; ‘collect’; ‘read’(DECat 5: 129–34).

And iftwo men are born under straight signs, one [fol. 11v] will seek toconquer the other. And if two men are born under the prostrate orcrooked signs, one will choose to submit to the other. And what issaid of men must be understood to be true of women as well. Thestraight signs are: Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius.The prostrate or crooked signs are: Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces,Aries, Taurus, and Gemini.And therefore the corresponding good and bad fates must benoted, and those that are the cause of wealth and those that are thecause of poverty, so that the good ones may be followed and thebad ones avoided. And generally speaking, if some bad star or faterules a man, you should avoid this man because often one or theother of you will come to great harm or misfortune. Such things arecaused by nature, which arranges worldly affairs in such way thatno man may truly understand them or ask for further explanation.Nevertheless, although nature has dealt out and deals out misfor-tune as demonstrated above, it also provides the manner and med-icine to avoid such misfortune. This wisdom can be found in infiniteways, most commonly in precious stones and herbs; and even in ani-mals; in seals or in stones inscribed with images; and many otherthings that one may read about at length in the De proprietatibus rerum.LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"136  proprietat de las cosas naturals.63E més són occasions psalms e paraulesenlas quals nostro Senyor ha po[fol. 12r]sada virtut.64E per ço diulo Ptholemeu que lo home saui senyoragarà los astres.65És encara més concordança en theologia que la ànima és supe-rior e lo cors inferior, lo qual no pot fer alguna cosa sens la ànima.E axí las stelas, planetas, et signes tots són fets a lahor de Déuomnipotent per amor del home.

The shorter forms are etymological. In modern times, the inchoative formhas replaced them as the standard, while the short forms are dialectal. Moll statesthat the short forms characterize Catalan and Balearic speech (91), while Corominessays they are Valencian (DECat 5: 129).63Llibre de la proprietat de las cosas naturals.No documented Cat. edition exists ofthis thirteenth century miscellany, De proprietatibus rerum, by Bartholomaeus Anglicus.The work is a popular encyclopedia of the properties of plants, animals, rocks, etc.replete with quotations of classical and patristic sources. The work was widely knownin the Middle Ages and used as a text at the University of Paris (Thorndike 2:405). Heinrich Mayer produced the first Spanish edition in Toulouse, 1494.64In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church officially condemned sympatheticmagic, the use of magical formulas as a countermeasure to spells or negative omens(even when accompanied by psalms and paternosters). Arnau de Vilanova’s attitudetowards such incantations, for example, was inconsistent. He provided some detailon how to use such magic in his Breviarium, and it got him into trouble with theInquisition (Thorndike 2: 852–3). Most medieval authors believed in magic, butthought it was evil. That the Tractatshould advocate such practice as theologicallysound places it at the vanguard of the cultural changes that would eventually leadto greater acceptance of the occult sciences during the Renaissance.65Lo home saui senyoragarà los astres. ‘The wise man shall rule the stars.’ Trans. ofLatin proverb, “homo sapiens dominabitur astris”, attributed to Ptolemy, althoughnot found in the Almagest, Centiloquium, or Tetrabiblos. The maxim, repeated often inthe Middle Ages, illustrates that astrological prognostication is compatible with theChristian doctrine of free will (Tester 176–77). Cf. explicit to Tresbéns’s Tractat deastrologia(mid fourteenth cent.): “. . . Mas per bons companyons, de bona ley e debona natura, per bones doctrinas, los vicis e los mals se aminven e ̇s corregexen ebon esforç mal astre venç, en tal guisa que saviesa sobresenyorege tota mala ven-tura e astre e enclinacions desordenades” (fol. 85r; Ed. Vernet et al.).66Cum natus esset Ihesus. . . These are the first words of Matthew 2, which tellsthe story of Christ’s birth. “Car lo home . . .” is a gloss from Pope Gregory theGreat’s homily on this chapter: “Sed si euangelii verba pensamus: quibus de eademstella dicitur: usque dum veniens staret supra ubi erat puer. Dum non puer ad stel-lam: sed stella ad puerum cucurrit. Si dici liceat, non stella fatum pueri: sed fatusstelle is qui apparuit puer fuit.” (Pastoralis sancti Grecorii pape fol. 50r–50v. tran-scription mine). Pope Gregory points out that since the star followed the Christchild, heavenly bodies are subject to Divine will and do not control human fate.LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"137And even better are the Psalms and the holy words in which ourLord has pla[fol. 12r]ced virtue. This is why Ptolemy says that thewise man will rule the stars.And it is even more in line with theology to say that the soul issuperior and the body inferior in that it can do nothing without thesoul. Thus the stars, planets, and signs are all the work of GodAlmighty because of his love of man. And man is not made for thelove of them. Because the child does not go to the star, rather thestar goes to the newborn child as Saint Gregory says in his homilyon Matthew 2: cum natus esset Ihesus et cetera. This must be under-stood to mean that the Creator has made all things obedient to Him.LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 137"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"138  E no és entès segons la humanitat influxa ho subiecta als astres.Car scrit és: fecit Deus duo luminaria magna vt sint in signa et tem-pora.

Here the Tractatcleverly sub-verts the passage to demonstrate that the stars do affect human beings, but onlyindirectly by passing on God’s divine will. This move allows the Tractat to wieldthe homily in support of astrological divination. See Chapter 1 for further discussion.67“Solem in potestatem diei quoniam in aeternum misericordia eius. Lunam etstellas in potestatem noctis quoniam in aeternum misericordia eius” (Psalm 135:8–9 Vulgate). “. . . the sun to rule over the day, for his steadfast love endures forever; the moon and stars to rule over the night, for his steadfast love endures forever . . .” (Psalm 136 RSV).68“Tuus est dies et tua est nox.

Thou has fixed all the bounds of the earth; thou hast made summer andwinter” (Psalm 74: 16–17 RSV).69Explicit. The conclusion is typical of works on occult sciences, and models canbe found in ancient times. Cf. Vettius Valens, “I adjure you, most honoured brother,and all those being initiated into this systematic art...to keep all these things hid-den, and not to share them with the uninstructed, except those who are worthyand able to guard and receive them rightly” (cit. in Tester 48–49).LUCAS_f5_92-141 8/19/03 5:08 PM Page 138"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"139And it is not to mean that humanity influences or controls thestars.

Diacritics are added to aid thereader. Where variant spellings of a word exist, the one most com-monly used is defined. Some unusual spellings and irregular verbforms are listed separately and cross-referenced to their definitions.Set phrases are indexed by the first word. Etymologies are providedfor difficult words, reflexes that are unusual in Catalan, and itemsthat help locate the Tractat de prenostication historically or geographically.açò pron. n. neut. that.agoytadj. ominous; foreboding. This word has not been previouslydocumented in Catalan as an adjective. It is most closely related toguaita n. f. ‘the act of watching or guarding’; ‘vigilance’; ‘those respon-sible for the watch’. From Frankish *WAHTA; Compare Ger. andDut. wachtand Eng. watch(Alcover and Moll 6: 431–32; DECat 4:688). The diphthong /æi/ (e.g. in guaita!) represents dissimilation andis still commonly heard in rural speech throughout the Catalan heart-land. See also the critical edition, note 54.altri pron. another person. from V. L. ALTERUI < Lat. ALTERÌdat. case. The Latin dative is responsible for other archaic forms inCast. and Cat.: e.g. otri, otrie‘another person’ (DECat 1: 237).amagar v. to hide; to conceal. Common to Cat. and Occ., but ofuncertain etymology. Coromines derives the word from Gascon ama-gar‘to undertake to accomplish an act in detriment of some indi-vidual’, also of unknown origin. He also notes that the form canmean ‘to squat down’ or ‘to duck’ in dialects of southern Spain andPortugal, perhaps providing a semantic link to ‘hide’ or ‘conceal’.Coromines also believes the word and related forms may ultimatelybe pre-Roman in origin (DECat 1: 247).aminuarv. to decrease; to reduce; fig. to wane.LUCAS_f7_183-195 8/19/03 10:02 AM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"184ansadv. before. < C.

Thefinal /-s/ may have been added by analogy to numerous otheradverbs ending in this consonant: després, segons, dins, etc.antósadj. stubborn; headstrong. Possibly a hapax legomenon. None ofthe major Catalan dictionaries documents this word. The item existsin Prov. as an adj. meaning ‘shameful’; ‘dishonorable’ < V. L. ANC-TOS idem(Honnorat 1: 116). The Catalan form could represent areinterpretation of the Prov. term with influence from Cat. entostandentost de‘instead of ’; ‘as opposed to’ (DECat 3: 393). The verb antostar‘to oppose’ < Lat. ANTE + OBSTARE may provide some addi-tional influence (DECat 5: 403).anyn. m. year. The variant form ayn, frequent in the text, is com-mon in O. Cat. Coromines argues that the alternate form is simplyan orthographic variation and does not represent a different pronun-ciation (DECat 5: 676).aprésadv. after. < L. adv. AB+PRÕSSE ‘compactly’; ‘narrowly’.This adverb is common to eastern Romance varieties either in thelocative or temporal sense of ‘after’; ‘behind’. In Cat., this form isfound until the fifteenth century, but becomes increasingly archaicafterwards. (DECat 3: 96–7). The form despréshas taken its place(< L.

In the Tractat,this learned form refers to the tail of an astrological sign and is fol-lowed immediately by the Catalan gloss coha, which suggests theauthor or editor was closely following another astrological sourcetext: “. . . quolseuol signe del zodiach ha tres cares—ço és lo cap, loventre e la cauda ho cua. . .” (fol. 11r).cocturan. f. the act of burning; a burn. literally, cooking. < V.

The /p/ is a transitional consontant.deffrenat variant of desfrenatadj. ‘unleased’; ‘loose’; ‘without restraint’< Lat. FRÈNUM ‘bridle of a horse’. Coromines cites examples fromthe fifteenth century. Often used to refer unrestrained speech: llenguadesfrenada; boca desfrenadaas in the Tractat(DECat 4: 179). In rapid orcareless speech, the etymological /s/ assimilates to the following con-sonant /f/, as we find in this spelling.delitn. m. from Lat. DELICTUM part. of Lat. DELÈNQUÕRE‘to lack’; ‘to be missing’; ‘to commit a fault’. Originally ‘petty crimeor offense’; but the sense changes over time. According to Coromines,starting from the Lat. acc. deliquium, which could also mean ‘faint-ing’, the word takes on the sense of ‘semi-conscious state’; perhaps‘swoon’. Eventually under analogical pressure from delicia, the wordcan mean ‘supreme pleasure’. In the Tractat, the word is used mostlikely in the context of pleasure (DECat 58–9). DÈLÌRUS, whichCicero uses to describe one who engages in extravant behavior, mayalso play an analogical role.demont adv. above.desitjós -a adj. desirous; often pertaining to carnal desire. < OldCat. desig ‘sexual desire’ < V. L. DESÈDÈUM n. n. idem. The V. L.neutral form is modeled on the C. L. feminine form meaning ‘sloth’;‘idleness’; ‘laziness’. The Catalan verb desitjaris formed on the V. L.noun, with some pressure from the verb DESÌDÕRARE, which hada similar meaning. Coromines suggests that the semantic evolutionfrom ‘to be idle’ to ‘to desire carnally’ follows the popular moralaphorism: “l’ociositat és mare de tots els vicis”: lit. “idleness is themother of all vice”, but akin to Eng. “idle hands are the devil’sworkshop” (DECat 3: 85–6). By the time the Tractatwas printed,the adjective was commonly used in the modern sense ‘desirous’;‘yearning’: “Serà casta e liberal e disigosa de saber” (fol. 6v).despendre v. to spend.LUCAS_f7_183-195 8/19/03 10:02 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"187deualladv. below.deurev. to owe; to have to do something either by physical neces-sity or moral obligation; to be likely or probable.

The sense of ‘to look at’ is common in the Romance family: O.Fr. garder, now regarder, Cat. guardar and related forms; Occ. gardar;It. guardare. In Catalan, this meaning is gradually attached to theform esguardar, which disappears in favor of mirar. Guardar still existsin the sense of ‘to guard’; ‘to keep’, ‘be careful of ’ although thereduced gordaris commonly heard in rural speech (DECat 4: 698–99).The labialization of /a/ is similar to the process at work through-out the text for initial /kw/: V.
