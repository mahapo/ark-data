It is usually trans-lated rather freely as, for instance: \"good things have occurred in the sacrifice\", or \"the omens are auspicious\", etc. I In such translations, however, we lose something that is implicit in the word kala, which is that the holy rites could be seen to be good, and that there was something visually attractive about them. The fact that this and other aspects of sacrificial ceremonies were interesting and nice to look at, gave them a certain popularity on the stage, either in the form of a tragic production of a mythical sacrifice, or as a comic view of a contemporary sacrifice. Several of the relevant passages will occupy us later on. Furthermore, the visual appeal of ani-mal sacrifice made it a suitable subject for the decoration of various kinds of material. These images of sacrifice will be studied in what follows. 1. 1. LIMITATIONS In more than one respect, this is not a comprehensive treatment of ancient Greek sacrifice. In the first place there is a chronological limitation. I have confmed myself to the Archaic and Classical periods, from the seventh century (when the first Archaic depictions of sacrifice occur) to the end of the fourth century B. C. This means on the one hand that Bronze Age iconography of sacrifice is ignored. The Minoan and Mycen-aean sacrificial representations are separated from the Archaic-Classical -[V-and R-numbersl in square brackets refer to the catalogues of vase paintings and votive reliefs respectively. In the notes books are referred to by author' s surname and year of publication; for articles I have added an abbreviated indication of the journal, Festschrift, etc. The abbreviations are those used in the Archii%gische Bibliographie; a list of some additional abbreviations precedes the bibliography. On the whole, I have tried to be selective in my references to secondary literature, and to lay the emphasis on the primary evidence. I See 5.8. The quotations are from Parker, in: Linders & Nordquist (eds.) 1987, 138, and Ph. Vellacott's translation of Theophrastos, Characteres 2(1973) 51."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2 CHAPTER ONE ones by such a wide chronological gap, that they are best treated as a subject in their own right. 2 At the other end, the Hellenistic period is excluded. Occasionally some Hellenistic material will be presented for comparison, but a full treatment of these later representations and the socio-religious changes in the Greek world that they reflect falls outside the scope of this study. 3 Secondly, there are the limitations imposed by the nature of the icono-graphical material. Aspects of sacrifice on which the iconographical evidence has nothing to offer will be excluded. Basically the images show how the Greeks sacrificed, or, a little more accurately, how they liked to see themselves performing the sacrificial rites. They offer useful informa-tion on contemporary cult practice. They have nothing to contribute to the hotly debated issue of origins. 4 An advantage of the archaeological material is, that it can on the whole be dated within reasonable margins. As it covers four successive centuries, one might expect to find evidence of significant developments in sacrificial cult practice in the course of that period. There are, how-ever, certain obstacles. The bulk of the relevant material begins only in the second half of the sixth century, so that the period for which icono-graphical evidence is fairly abundant comes down to little more than two centuries. Moreover, the different classes of evidence are spread quite unevenly over this period. For the sixth and fifth century we have mostly vase paintings, whereas the fourth century material consists largely of votive reliefs. As we shall see, vase paintings and votive reliefs form two iconographically distinct categories, which makes it unsafe to draw infer-ences as to developments in cult practice from differences between the earlier vases paintings and the later votive reliefs. 5 Even within one cate-2 Sacrifice in the Bronze Age Aegean: Nilsson 1950, 194-235 and 426-446; Matz, AbhMainz 1958, nr. 7; Nilsson 1967, 275-278 and 326-329; Sakellarakis, PZ 45 (1970) 135-219; Long 1974; Marinatos, in: Hagg et al.

INTRODUCTION 3 gory, the limited period of currency of a certain motif may have more to do with a short-lived fashion in vase painting than with changes in the underlying rituals.6 So if we find hardly any reliable evidence of signifi-cant changes in sacrificial practice within our period, this may at least partly be due to the deficiencies of the material. We should, however, also consider that cult practice in general has a tendency to be rather conservative, and that its basic components are seldom liable to abrupt changes. If on the subject of chronological development our material has less to offer than we might perhaps have hoped for, we fare little better with regional differentiation. Literary texts and inscriptions with cult regula-tions attest an immensely rich variety in sacrificial rituals, not only from one region to another, but even within one area from sanctuary to sanctu-ary and from occasion to occasion. By contrast, the iconographical mate-rial is relatively monotonous. Not so much because one region, the area of the Athenian polis, is greatly over-represented (though there is that too), but mainly because most depictions of sacrifice concentrate on the more constant elements of the ritual. There are yet other aspects of Greek sacrifice on which the images shed little light. In the Greek context the word sacrifice (and its equiva-lent in other languages) embraces a multiplicity of phenomena that rather defy classification.7 For practical purposes a primary division in two main classes is useful; (1) sacrifices where only some parts of the animal were burnt for the gods, and a large portion was eaten by the human sacrificers; (2) sacrifices of which nothing was eaten, the thysiai ageustoi (\"sacrifices not tasted\"). The second class is in fact quite a hotchpotch: a number of very different types of sacrifice share this characteristic of not being eaten. We shall see that the vast majority of our images, in so far as it is possible to make the distinction, depict sacrifices of the first class. The mixed group of thysiai ageustoi is represented by only a handful of pictures. Why are they so rare? The fact that some do exist precludes the assumption that such depictions were subject to some sort of taboo. 8 Nor can the scarcity of representations be attributed to an infrequent occur-6 This is evidently the case with the kanolln-and-chernips scenes, see 2. 1.2. 7 Nilsson 1967, 132-157; \"Denn unter dem einen Wort (Opfer) verbergen sich Riten sehr mannigfaltigen Ursprungs und Sinnes\"; also 104-110; Burkert, in: Le Sacrifice dans l'Antiquite (1981) 91-125. 8 See 3.2. and 4.4.3."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 CHAPTER ONE rence of these rites in real life. Let us look, by way of illustration, at one specific type of thysfa ageustos: the purificatory sacrifice. 9 Any Athenian citizen would frequently be in a position to witness a purificatory sacrifice. Before every meeting of the council and the assem-bly, a young pig was killed and carried round the circumference of the meeting-place. Some sanctuaries were in a similar way purified by pig's blood at regular intervals, as were armies. The ritual purification from homicide was probably not so often seen in real life, but every Greek would be familiar with the story of Orestes' purification in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, again by pig's blood.IO And yet we do not have a single representation of a contemporary, real purification sacrifice of a pig. II Only mythical purifications are occasionally depicted on South Italian vases of the fourth century B. C . Three Apulian kraters [V 411 : Paris Louvre K 710; V412: Art market; V412bi s: Private collection], and one Paestan squat lekythos [V 413: Paestum 4794], show Apollo holding a piglet over Orestes, who is seated, sword in hand, on an altar. 12 There is another mythical purification, possibly of the daughters of Proitos by Melampous, on a rather formidable Sicilian krater, about 350/325 B.C. [Fig. 1, V427: Syracuse 47038]. A group of women, some of them show-ing distinct signs of madness, have gathered in a sanctuary. One of them, collapsing on her knees, is supported by one young man while another young man holds a small pig over her head, cutting its throat with a knife. 13 9 On what follows see Parker 1983, 21 ff. with references. 10 Aischylos, Eumenides 281-283. Parker 1983, 228 and 370-374. 11 The woman holding a small animal, a dog rather than a pig, and the three torches set in the ground, on an Attic red figure lekythos [V63: Athens NM 1695], might possibly have to do with the purificatory rites for Hekate at the crossroads on the sixteenth of every month: Van Straten, BABesch 49 (1974) 182; for the rites see Borgeaud 1979, 230-231, and Parker 1983, 30-31. 12 See Dyer, JHS 89 (1969) 38-56; Trendall & Webster 1971, 49, III. I , 12; cf. Brown, JHS 102 (1982) 30-32; Neitzel, WurzbJbAltWiss N.F. 17 (1991) 69-89. Rudhardt 1958, 166; Parker 1983, 139 and 386-388. 13 The interpretation of the scene as the purification of the Proitidai, by Libertini, BdA 35 ( 1950) 97-107, is attractive (though by no means certain) and has been widely accepted: e.g. Trendall, LCS 602/ 102; Burkert 1972, 193; Schefold & Jung 1981, 171; Koss atz-Deissmann, Hera, LlMC IV (1988) 717 nr. 490; Simon, Melampous, LlMC VI (1992) 407 nr. 5. For the identification of one of the two cult statues in the picture as Hera holding a pair of scissors, see Shefton apud Simon, AntK 25 (1982) 37 note 14. Langlotz 1963, 24-25, interprets the scene as the initiation of a girl in a mystery cult, INTRODUCTION 5 The question remains: why is such a common ritual so rarely, if ever, depicted. Its absence on votive reliefs, which were mainly concerned with sacrifices as gifts, is understandable.14 With regard to vase paintings it could be argued that the ritual of purificatory sacrifice, and indeed any type of thysfa ageustos, gave vase painters less scope for a variety of interesting scenes than the class of sacrifices part of which was eaten. Nevertheless it is hard to see how yet another addition to the endless series of Herakles wrestling the Iionl5 would be so much more attractive than the occasional purificatory piglet. There is always the possibility, of course, that such vase paintings were made in small numbers, and that by pure coincidence none of these have so far been found. The numerous Greek painted pots that we have are, after all, only a minute fraction of what was produced. 16 1.2. ApPROACH Taking the iconographical repertoire as a guideline, we have had to take leave of quite a few interesting aspects of Greek sacrifice, but a good deal is left. How are we to read these representations of sacrifice? I opt for a straightforward (some might call it simple~minded) approach which could be summarized, with a variation on a much abused piece of computer jargon, as \"What You See Is What It Is\".' If we see a picture of a sheep, I take it as a reference to a sheep, not as a recondite clue to some hidden deeper truth. This is not a statement of faith that such clues could never exist, but if they exist, I leave them to others. Unfortunately, even simple things have a tendency to become compli-cated. It is obvious that the \" You\", in \"What You See Is What It Is\", does not refer to us, but to the ancient Greeks who produced, bought and enjoyed the pictures we are dealing with. To understand what something is, we would have to look at it with ancient Greek eyes. In other words, we would have to acquire all the general background knowledge, the whole frame of reference, that the vase painter or relief sculptor took for granted in his contemporary spectators. To think that we can really do but that is unlikely; the iconography is too close to that of Orestes' purification. 14 See 5.8. 15 On the popularity of this theme see Brommer 1974, 7. 16 Cook, Jdl74 (1959) 114-123, calculates a survival rate of less than a half percent."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 CHAPTER ONE that would be poor judgement, but we must leave no stone unturned in trying to come as close as possible. 17 The two largest and most interesting classes of sacrificial representa-tions are vase paintings and votive reliefs. In both groups very few repre-sentations are unique. Most iconographical components can be incorpo-rated in a series of pictures that are similar, but never identical: details of context may vary. Taking the whole series into account, we get more information on that iconographical component than we would from one instance. Consequently, any interpretation proposed for it is only accept-able if it fits the whole series. In the course of this study it will become clear that votive reliefs and vase paintings, although they do have certain elements in common, are iconographically distinct categories. So when we use a depiction as a source of information on sacrificial ritual, we must always take into account the particular artisans' tradition to which it belongs. This is equally true for different regional traditions of vase painting, for instance Corinthian versus Attic. Trying to look at our images with ancient Greek eyes also implies differentiating between functions of objects decorated with these repre-sentations. A Greek drinking at a symposion would look at the picture on the bottom of his cup with other eyes than he would at a votive relief when visiting a sanctuary. We shall find that this, too, had its effect on their respective iconography. 18 For a tentative reconstruction of the ancient Greek frame of reference we are not confined to a comparative analysis of the images themselves. Fortunately there is quite a substantial amount of Greek textual material on sacrifice. We have inscriptions with cult regulations, sacrificial calen-dars, accounts of the fmancial aspects of cult, etc., as well as literary texts of various genres. It goes without saying that in using these texts as evidence on sacrificial ritual, we must be constantly aware of the nature of the text and the context of the passage. The relevant inscriptions we may on the whole assume to be factual. But here again we are confronted with the problem that on some aspects of ritual, for instance which parts of the sacrificial animals would fall to the priests, there is abundant and very detailed information, whereas we find little or nothing on the god's portion. Apparently, that was common knowledge. Similarly, historians 17 For a practical illustration of the following remarks, see e.g. 2.1.2. on kanoOn and chernips, and 4.2. on osphOs and splAnchna. 18 See 5.7. and 5.8. INTRODUCTION 7 will often leave out information that would have been most welcome to us, because it would be familiar to the contemporary readers they had in mind. 19 The use of imaginative literature, such as tragedy and comedy, as evidence for cults and beliefs, poses particular problems.20 Tragedies usually derive their subject from traditional myth and epic, and are set in an imaginary remote past. When a poet wanted to introduce detailed descriptions of ritual he would probably most often draw these from his own experience of contemporary ritual, and in that case they are valid evidence. If, however, these details were an inherent part of the tradi-tional story (which we do not always know), or if, on the other hand, they have an obvious function in the mechanics of the plot, then we may only use them with great caution. Most comedies are set in contemporary society. They contain much that is relevant to cult and ritual, and it is tempting to take these passages at face value, but it is only fair to remem-ber that a comic poet's intention was to entertain his audience, not to inform us about the religion of his contemporaries. Consequently, it is up to us to fmd out which parts of a certain passage are comic distortion and which are a faithful reflection of real ritual. Since later on we will fre-quently have recourse to comic texts, it may be useful, at the outset, to give an example of how this works. Whoever wanted to be initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, had to bring a sucking pig, the so called mystic piglet (chofros mystik6s).21 Eleu-sinian votive reliefs and statuettes, and Eleusinian scenes on vases, show initiates, characterized by the bundle of twigs (btikchos), carrying a piglet by one hind leg. On the second day of the mysteries, all initiates went to the sea to cleanse themselves with seawater, and they brought their pig-lets along to wash them as well.22 The question arises, what happened next with the piglets. The texts are not explicit on this point. Scholars have argued that they served as purificatory sacrifices,23 or that they were 19 See the insightful chapter \"What Thucydides takes for granted\", in Gomme' s com-mentary on Thucydides I (1959) 1-25. 20 Cf. Mikalson 1991, on popular religion in Greek tragedy; Bowie 1993, on myth, ritual and comedy in Aristophanes; also Ehrenberg's classic on the people of Aristopha-nes 3(1962). Parker 1983, 13-16, has some characteristically judicious remarks on the status of tragedy and comedy as evidence for cults and beliefs. 21 Nilsson 1967, 105 note l. Aristophanes, Pax (421 B.C.), 374-5 and scholion. 22 Ploutarchos, Phocion 28, 6. 23 Foucart 1914, 294; Mylonas 1961,249-250."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 CHAPTER ONE thrown into pits in the Eleusinian sanctuary and left to rot. 24 In both cases they would belong to the class of thysiai ageustoi. Others believe that they belong to the other class of sacrifice, and that these piglets were in fact (partly) roasted and eaten by the initiates. This latter opinion is based on a passage from Aristophanes' comedy the Frogs.25 When the chorus of initiates enters the orchestra, the slave Xanthias exclaims, invoking Demeter's daughter: \"What a wonderful smell of pork!\" Is this evidence for the roasting of the mystic piglets, or is it just a fantastic expression of the preoccupation with food of the stereotypical comic slave? There is another passage, from Aristophanes' Acharnians, which, I think, is rele-vant here.26 The play was produced in 425 B.C., in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. Not only the Athenians themselves, but also their western neighbour Megara, had suffered terrible hardships. In the scene in question a Megarian has come to Athens to try and sell his young daughters, whom he has thinly disguised with pig's trotters. He recom-mends them to the Athenian farmer Dikaiopolis as excellent mystic pig-lets. Dikaiopolis inspects one thoroughly, and then concludes that she is not fit for sacrifice, because she has no tail. It should be noted that in Greek the word for piglet, when used in connection with young girls, has the same connotation as \"pussy\" in English, and that the Greek word for tail was also used as slang for penis.27 That in itself would probably be enough to elicit a snigger from at least part of the audience. But there is more. A Greek would immediately understand the word tail, if mentioned in connection with a sacrificial animal, as the most conspicuous part of the god's portion in the sort of sacrifice where much of the meat was eaten by the sacrificers. 28 Now the question is: are we to assume that the comic sense of Aristo-phanes, and of his audience (and the judges who awarded both the Achar-nians and the Frogs first prize), would be satisfied with a slave's stereo-typical remark about food, and some gratuitous genital jokes? It is much more likely that both scenes have a point of reference in the real sacrifice 24 Clinton, in: R. Hagg et al. (eds.) 1988, 69-80. 25 Aristophanes, Ranae (405 B.C.), 337-338; see e.g. Nilsson 1967, 105 note I; Burkert 1972, 284; Parker 1983, 283. 26 Aristophanes, Acharnenses (425 B.C.), 738-796. 27 See Henderson 1991, 131 nr . 110 and 128 nr. 92. 28 See 4.2. INTRODUCTION 9 of the mystic piglets (a sacrifice of the edible kind); in that manner, there is a little more subtlety and depth to the humour. Meanwhile it has become clear that, if we are to use comic scenes, or other literary passages, as evidence for sacrificial ritual, again we have to reconstruct the frame of reference of the ancient audience in order to arrive at a maximal interpretation. To that effect, archaeology quite often offers useful information, especially for a better understanding of com-edy.29 More in general, we need a constant feedback between the differ-ent categories of evidence (archaeological, epigraphical, literary) to get the maximum of information from them. That is the approach I have adopted. Admittedly an argument based on such mutual feedback carries a certain risk of circularity, but so does riding a bicycle. As long as one is aware of the mechanics involved it need not be fatal. 1.3. ORGANIZATION The argument in the following chapters follows the chronological order of the successive stages in the sacrificial ritual, as it may be inferred from the representations. The main division is in three phases: (a) Pre-kill, comprising' sacrificial images where the animal is still alive and whole. (b) The killing. (c) Post-kill, including all that was done with the animal's carcass and its various parts. A closer analysis of the material covering the first and third phases will reveal a natural sub-division into sub-groups. With the help of some key pieces which show a juxtaposition or conflation oftwo or more of such sub-groups, these can be understood as successive sub-phases in the progression of the ritual. It might be thought that at least the three main phases would be embar-rassingly obvious, as indeed they are in the iconographical material. On the basis of the literary material, however, Rudhardt distinguished three \"actes fondamentaux de l'operation sacrificielle\", namely: \"(1) la mise a mort d' un etre vivant; (2) l'extraction du corps de la victime de quelques parties considerees comme essentielles; (3) 1 'utilisation de ces morceaux privilegies. ,,30 In this arrangement the whole of the pre-kill phase, which happens to include by far the majority of representations, is ignored. Burkert, in part harking back to Hubert and Mauss, presents a tripartite 29 See e.g. Hauser, Olh 12 (1909) 80-100; Sparkes, lHS 95 (1975) 122-135. 30 Rudhardt 1958, 290."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10 CHAPTER ONE structure which largely corresponds with our division in the pre-kill, kill, and post-kill phases.31 It will be argued, though, that the relative impor-tance that Burkert attaches to each of the three phases is not supported by the iconographical evidence. 32 Finally, there is the matter of the criteria that will be applied to estab-lish which representations are to be included as depictions of animal sacrifice and which do not belong. In the post-kill images, all that is visible of the sacrificed animal may be small parts that by themselves are not immediately recognizable to us. But as was noted earlier, there are firm iconographical links between these pictures and those of the earlier phases, where the animal is still complete. Which brings us to the ques-tion, by what criteria an animal (a complete one, that is) can be distin-guished as a sacrificial animal. It is best to start from the most comprehensive and detailed depictions of sacrificial processions. Several characteristics may identify the scene as a sacrificial one: the sanctuary to which the cortege is under way is indicated by an altar or some abbreviated form of architecture; often the god himself, the recipient of the sacrifice, is present; fillets or streamers adorn the animal; and at the head of the procession walks a characteristic figure, a woman carrying a basket on her head. This female basket-bearer deserves a little more attention. The basket has a distinctive shape. It has a flat round bottom and a vertical rim pro-jecting into three vertical handles (or rather \"handles\": they may be either solid or open, but they are never seen to be used as handles). Within the confines of these basic characteristics there is a considerable variation in shape, height and material (in principle it is a wickerwork basket, but important sanctuaries would often have very elaborate ones in precious metal). The three \"handles\" are essential; when occasionally a flat tray is used in the same context as this basket, three twigs are set on 31 Burkert 1972, 19-20: \"Die allgemeine Struktur des Opferrituals ist von Hubert und Mauss zutreffend mit den Begriffen 'Sakralisation' und 'Desakralisation' umschrie-ben worden: Vorbereitungsriten einerseits, Abschlussriten andererseits umrahmen ein Zentrum, markiert auch als emotioneller Hohepunkt durch den schrillen Schrei, die Ololyge: diese 'Tat' aber ist der Akt des Totens, das Ereignis des Sterbens. Ein drei-geteilter Rhythmus ergibt sich somit im Vollzug des Opfers, der von einem labyrin-thisch gehemmten Anfang tiber eine erschreckende Mitte zum sorgfaltig-klaren Ab-schluss fiihrt.\" 32 See 5.8. INTRODUCTION 11 the rim. The \"three-handled\" basket has been firmly identified long ago as the kanoun or sacrificial basket, and the female figure who leads the procession carrying the kanoftn on her head is the kaneph6ros. 33 KANOUN TYPES [V136: The Hague 5·711 [V7B: Ferrara T 57 c VPI [V74: Boston 13.1951 [R73: Brauron 11511 To act as a kanephoros for the procession at a public festival was considered one of the greatest honours an Athenian girl could achieve. In a law concerning the Lesser Panathenaia she is mentioned among the officials who take precedence at the distribution of the sacrificial meat. 34 Some of the silver kana that are listed in inventories of Athenian sanctu-aries weighed, on average, more than half a talent (13-14 kg). 35 If these were carried in processions, the kanephoroi must have been strong, not very young girls, and in fact in Aristophanes' Lysistrata the kanephoria is mentioned last in a series of important religious functions that girls could perform.36 In private sacrifice one would not normally have a procession 33 Deubner, Jdl40 (1925) 210 ff.; Schelp 1975.

All in all, the comprehensive, detailed pictures are easily recognized as sacrificial scenes. Vase painters, however, are often selective, leaving out one or more components that we might think rather essential. Still, as long as any of the indications pointing to sacrificial ritual is present, the picture will be included. If, on the other hand, we have just an ox accom-panied by a man in a felt cap and with a sack over his shoulder, 37 we should rather take that as a scene from country life without any religious implications, and it will be excluded. Depictions of mythical sacrifices are included. It seems likely that vase painters who chose a mythical sacrifice as subject would usually fill in the details from their contemporary experience, but some details may ha ve been an inherent part of the traditional story, and for us it is often impossible to distinguish between the two. To be on the safe side, I will ignore the mythical scenes in all quantitative analyses. 3 7 E.g. Att. rf. amphora on the Art market: MuM Basel 26 (1963) Dr. l35; cf. Palermo ColI.

CHAPTER TWO PRE-KILL This group comprises all sacrificial representations where the sacrificial animal is still alive and whole, and the act of killing has not yet been initiated. 2.1. VASE PAINTINGS The vase paintings representing the first main phase of the sacrificial ritual, before the killing of the animal, range from very comprehensive ones, rich in figures and explicit details, to quite meagre pictures which are little more than a cutout from the more complete scenes, showing, for instance, just the victim and its handler. Obviously the more comprehensive pictures form the best starting point for our considerations. These, on closer scrutiny, allow a subdivision of the pre-kill phase into two sub-phases: (a) the sacrificial procession approaches the sanctuary; (b) preliminary rituals are performed at the altar. 2 . 1.1. The sacrificial procession approaches the sanctuary The term sacrificial procession is here used in a very broad sense for any group of people accompanying the victim. These \"processions\" again may be divided into two subcategories, according to the presence or absence of a female figure carrying the sacrificial basket (kanoiin) on her head. As we saw above, such a kaneph6ros was a regular feature of religious processions in the proper sense of the word, which were held on the occasion of various public festivals. It is therefore reasonable to assume that pictures of the first subcategory, where the cortege is headed by a kaneph6ros, refer to some public festival. In the second subcategory, where a male figure, who may at the same time lead the victim, holds the kanoiin in his hand, we have sacrificial ceremonies on a more modest scale, perhaps of a private nature. Vase painters were not usually exhaustive in their depiction of the various elements that constituted a sacrificial procession. Depending,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 CHAPTER TWO among other things, on the space available on the pot, they would skip one or more components. If no kanoiin-bearer of any kind is included in the picture, it may sometimes still be possible to assign it, with a reasonable degree of cogency, to one of the two subcategories, on the grounds of the presence or absence of a band of musicians, or the number of participants. Festive procession, mostly headed by kanephOros ATTIC Athena In Attic vase painting, one of the earliest processions of this type is to be found on a black figure band cup of the middle of the sixth century B. C. , which turned up on the art market in 1958 [Fig. 2, V55: Private collec-tion].l The frieze of a band cup is particularly suited to accommodate a large number of figures and its possibilities are here exploited to the full. On the far left we have the recipient of the sacrifice, Athena represented as Promachos.2 In front of the goddess there is an altar on which the firewood and flames are clearly indicated. A woman standing on the left of the altar clasps hands with a man corning from the right. The man wears a himation with a decorated border, and carries a couple of twigs over his left shoulder. He is followed by the kaneph6ros. The kanoiin is quite large, and its basketry fabric is indicated by crosshatching. Then come three sacrificial animals, an ox, a pig and a sheep, led by five male figures holding twigs; the man on the near side of the ox holds a rope which is attached to the horns of the animal. The five animal handlers are distinguished from the other participants by their scant clothing: just short chitons, as far as we can tell. They are followed by three musicians, two playing the double pipes, one the kithara.3 The rest of the procession is 1 There is an earlier sacrificial procession on a Siana cup of c. 570/565 B.C. [V45: Taranto I. G. 4346]. It lacks the kaneph6ros; a man in chiton and himation, holding a horn, stands on the left of an altar with fire. From the right a man in a short chiton leads a bull towards the altar. He is followed by six men in chiton and himation. Seven more similar men and two youths are depicted on the reverse. Above the altar a bird flies to the left. 2 Promachos: Niemeyer 1960. 3 On music in cult scenes see Nordquist, in: Hagg (ed.) 1992, 143-168; also Haldane, GaR 13 (1966) 98 ff. PRE-KILL 15 made up of some men in chiton and himation carrying twigs, and three hoplites and a horseman as representatives of the infantry and cavalry. The position of the woman between the goddess and the altar suggests that she is the priestess, welcoming the procession on behalf of Athena. The man in the bordered chiton, on account of his prominent position, may be taken as a priest or an official in charge of the procession. Several elements of this picture recur about half a century later on a black figure lekythos found on the Athenian Akropolis [Fig. 3, V 19: Athens NM Akr 2298]. Here Athena Promachos stands on the right, and a man (a priest?) holding branches, is turned towards the goddess. They are both inside the temple, which is indicated by a column with a fillet tied round it, and part of the entablature. On the left of the column, i.e. outside the temple, there is an altar with a blazing fire. From the left the procession approaches, consisting of the female kaneph6ros and a man holding twigs, walking side by side, a man leading the bovine victim which is adorned with stemmata hanging over its horns, and a pipe-player. Athena Promachos is again the recipient on a black figure amphora from about 550/540 B.C. [Fig. 4, V21: Berlin F 1686]. A woman holding twigs in both hands stands on the other side of an altar, facing the god-dess. Behind her are three men accompanying an ox, one of them restrain-ing the animal by a rope tied to its foreleg. The four musicians on the reverse (two pipe-players and two kithara-players) probably belong. There is no kaneph6ros, but the considerable group of musicians suggests that we have here a selective, abbreviated representation of a substantial procession. Which Athenian festival or festivals in honour of Athena do these pictures refer to? Do we have sufficient information to pin them down? All these pictures, and especially the impressive procession on the band cup, have been connected with Athena's major festival, the Panathenaia.4 Not convincingly, I think. The Athena Promachos type does not help. It should only be taken as a convenient way to identify the recipient goddess, not as a faithful copy of the relevant cult image. Since the sixties of the sixth century B.C. this Athena type was the standard decoration of the obverse of Panathenaic amphorae. There the implicit reference is to Athena Polias, in whose honour the Panathenaia were celebrated, though we know that 4 Lehnstaedt 1970, 82 ff.; Neumann 1979,27; cf. the reservations of Shapiro, in: Neils 1992, 54 f .. On the Panathenaia in general, see Deubner 1932, 22-35; Ziehen, Panathenaia, RE xvm (1949) 457-493; Robertson, RhM 128 (1985) 231-295; Robertson 1993, 90-119."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 CHAPTER TWO the cult image of Athena Polias looked entirely different. 5 The same Promachos type, however, also occurs elsewhere, even, as we shall see, outside Attika, in a Boiotian context. So it may, but need not, stand for the Athenian Polias, and is therefore not in itself sufficient to connect the vase paintings in question with the Panathenaia. A serious objection to an interpretation in this sense is, that the peplos, which was the focal point of the Panathenaic procession, at least of the Greater Panathenaia, is nowhere indicated in the vase paintings studied so far.6 The most elaborate picture, on the band cup, has infantry and cavalry participating in the procession, as they did at the Panathenaia, but on other occasions as well.7 The men carrying twigs might be interpreted as the thalloph6roi of the Panathenaic procession: old men, selected in a sort of beauty contest, who carried young 0Iive-shoots.8 In archaic vase painting, however, the majority of figures in sacrificial processions for any deity carry twigs. Finally, there is the rather striking sacrifice of three animals, bovine, pig and sheep. In Greek such a sacrifice could be called a trittoia b6ar-chos (\"threesome led by an OX\").9 As far as we know, this was not the typical sacrifice of the Panathenaia. A lex sacra concerning the Lesser Panathenaia, dated between 335/4 and 330/29 B.C., distinguishes two sacrifices to Athena: one \"to be sacrificed in the Old Temple (if we accept this plausible restoration of the text), in the traditional way\", the other one to be sacrificed on the Great Altar of Athena. 10 The latter sacrifice con-sisted entirely of cows, on this particular occasion to the value of 41 rnnal 5 Alroth 1989, 48-54.

Beside the Parthenon frieze, there is one other possible representation of Athena's peplos, on an Attic black figure amphora of Panathenaic shape (no sacrifice): New York MMA 1953.11.1, ABV298/5: Princeton Ptr (5501540 B.C.); CVA 4, pI. 13; Bohr 1982,18,27,110, pI. 169; Neils 1992,25 fig. 14. 7 Thoukydides VI 58; Xenophon, Hipparchicus III 2. 8 Etymoiogicum Magnum S.v.

The 41 mnal derive from the rent of the Nea, which has been variously interpreted as fallow land (Lewis, Hesperia 28, 1959, 239-247), territory at Oropos, newly acquired by Athens (Robert, Helleniea 11-12, 1960, 189-203), or the elusive island Nea(i) between Lemnos and the Hellespont (Langdon, Hesperia 56, 1987, 47-58). PRE-KILL 17 (which would buy approximately fifty cows). The traditional sacrifice in the Old Temple (i.e., at that time, the \"Erechtheion\") probably consisted of cows and an equal number of sheep. II A little more than a century earlier, on the Parthenon frieze, we have a similar dichotomy. On the north frieze, facing the Old Temple of Athena Polias, four cows and four sheep are led to sacrifice, whereas on the corresponding portion of the south frieze we have only cows (at least nine, i.e. many). 12 Still earlier by a good half century we probably have a picture of the traditional sacrifice of cow and sheep on a black figure hydria in Uppsala [Fig. 5, V50: Uppsala 352]. The presence of Athena is there indicated by a huge owl perching on the altar. On the whole, then, there is no good reason to connect the picture on the band cup with the Panathenaia. It may well be one of the other Athena festivals of the Athenian polis, or (a possibility we should not overlook) of one of the Attic demes. For individual demes and local associations in Attika had their own celebrations in honour of the goddess, and we know of at least two such occasions where the sacrifice consisted of cow, sheep and pig.13 There is another trittoia b6archos on a fragmentary black figure dinos of about the same date as the band cup [Fig. 6, V13: Athens NM Akr 607]. Unfortunately the picture is very incomplete, and the deity is not preserved, but the fragments were found on the Athenian Akropolis, so the recipient of this sacrifice may well have been Athena (assuming that the pot was a votive offering in the sanctuary of this goddess, and that an appropriate picture was chosen, or even specially made, for that purpose). One of the surviving fragments of this dinos has an interesting figure walking beside the sacrificial pig. He is a bearded man in a loin cloth, II Philochoros quoted by Harpokration s .v. E7tiI30lOV. 12 Pace Boardman 1985, 108 and Idem, Fests .

According to Kardara, AEphem 1961, 141, all sacrificial animals on both the north and the south frieze are male. But on the south frieze at least one cow shows an udder; the sex of the other animals is not so clear, but circumstantial evidence is in favour of female victims: see Ziehen, i.e., and Brommer 1977, 215. 13 LS 16: deme Oinoe; on the nature of this fragmentary inscription see Dow, Hesperia 30, 1961, 67. Cf. LS 20 B 35: Marathonian Tetrapolis, sacrifice of a cow, three sheep and a piglet to Athena Hellotis. If the Oinoe mentioned in the first inscrip-tion was the deme in the phyle Aiantis (and not the one in the phyle Hippothontis), it was part of the Marathonian Tetrapolis, see Whitehead 1986, 185 and 392."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 CHAPTER TWO holding the usual twigs, and carrying a case contammg two different knives hanging from a shoulder belt. A similar figure, carrying a case with three knives, takes part in a sacrificial procession on a fragmentary black figure skyphos, probably also from the Akropolis, but found on its north slope [Fig. 7, V6: Athens Agora A-P 2197 etc.]. They would seem to be specialist butchers (mageiroi or artamoi) with the tools of their trade. 14 Finally, a procession in honour of Athena on a black figure oinochoe of the early fifth century B.C. shows the goddess seated in her temple (indicated by two columns) [Fig. 8, V31: London 1905.7-11.1]. 15 Athena wears helmet and aigis, and holds a phiale over the altar. The modest procession consists of a kaneph6ros, a man carrying a hydria (or outsize oinochoe?), and a man leading a bull. On the left the picture is framed by a third column. If we survey the sacrificial processions for Athena, we must conclude that they all lack sufficiently specific elements for us to identify the particular festival intended. In fact, this may not just be due to our incom-plete knowledge. I doubt whether any of these pictures would have been specific enough for a contemporary Athenian to recognize it as a represen-tation of a particular festival. They may be generalized impressions of any major festive sacrifice. Dionysos On three late black figure skyphoi, all attributed to the Theseus Painter, Dionysiac processions are depicted which have one feature in common: a ship mounted on wheels, in which Dionysos is seated between satyrs playing double pipes. On the most complete example [Fig. 9, V24: Bologna 130] the ship-chariot, drawn by two satyrs, is followed by a young man, and preceded by a kaneph6ros, a youth carrying a thurible, two male figures holding twigs, and two male figures leading the sacrifi-cial bull. The second skyphos [Fig. 10, V28: London B 79] lacks several of these elements (including the kaneph6ros), but adds a pipe-player. Of 14 Berthiaume 1982, passim. 15 There is another seated Athena on a black figure hydria of the late sixth century B.C. [V53: Art market). Strangely in this picture the sacrificial animal, a cow or bull, and the blazing altar appear to be inside the temple (indicated by a column and entabla-ture), whereas Athena, accompanied by a large snake, is seated outside. A somewhat similar disposition is found on a pelike in Himera [V27: Himera). PRE-KILL 19 the third skyphos only a fragment with the ship-chariot survives.16 A contemporary Athenian probably had little difficulty in identifying the festival intended here. For us it is not so easy. Among all the literary and epigraphical information we have with regard to the Dionysiac festivals of Athens, a ship-chariot is never mentioned.17 However, almost a century ago, Nilsson was able to make a plausible case for the Anthesteria, based on the fact that in Smyrna a ship-chariot was a feature of the Anthesteria procession. 18 Most scholars have followed this attribution,19 but there have been some dissidents who prefer the City Dionysia.20 It is interesting that in all three pictures the god himself and his follow-ers, the satyrs, appear to take part in the procession. It may be that they are in fact human beings dressed up as Dionysos and satyrs, but it is equally possible that the vase painter has taken the liberty of visualizing the invisible divine presence.21 Two other black figure vase paintings probably depict sacrificial processions in honour of Dionysos. On the first one, an amphora of about the middle of the sixth century B. C. [Fig. 11, V22: Berlin F 1690], we have a kaneph6ros carrying a twig. The kanoun she carries on her head is decorated with sprigs and fillets. She is followed by a man carrying a piglet, two men carrying twigs, and a man carrying a twig, an oinochoe, a wineskin, and a basket on a pole over his shoulder. The wineskin, and the ivy crowned revellers on the reverse of this vase, suggest a Dionysiac context, without indicating any particular festival. 16 Athens NM Akr 1281: ABL 250/29; also Tiibingen 1497: Watzinger 1924, D 53, PI. 15; eVA 3, pI. 6,4.

Gasparri, LIMe III (1986) 502: \"sicuramente connessi con Ie Grandi Dionisie\", is overconfident. 21 Alternatively we could consider the possibility that these ship-chariots carried an image of Dionysos. In the vase paintings he does not look like a statue, but here again we might attribute the rather lifelike, and un-statue-like, appearance of the god to the vase painter' s imagination. The vase paintings give no clue to decide between the various possibilities. On such Dionysiac ambiguities see Versnel 1990, esp. 131-150."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 CHAPTER TWO The second vase, an amphora of about 540/520 B.C. [V32: Munich 1441], has on the obverse Dionysos welcomed by a man, presumably Ikarios, and a goat between them. There is nothing to indicate whether this goat is intended as a sacrificial animal. Under one handle there is an altar, and a woman standing behind it (because of her position she may be interpreted as a priestess). The altar is approached, on the reverse of the vase, by a procession consisting of a man holding twigs and a wreath, a man carrying twigs and an oinochoe, accompanied by a ram, a male kaneph6ros carrying an oinochoe, a pipe-player, and a smaller man, partly under the other handle. This picture may refer to a mythical sacrifice in connection with Ikarios' reception of Dionysos.22 The fact that the male kaneph6ros nevertheless carries the kanoun on his head is very unusual, but perhaps we should not make too much of it, for the painter of this vase, the Affecter, \"is a stylist as no other, and the content of his figure scenes concern him little. ,,23 The Eleusinian goddesses (?) On a black figure lekythos of the third quarter of the sixth century B.C. [Fig. 12, V9: Athens NM 493], two female figures holding wreaths are seated on either side of a blazing altar. They are best understood as goddesses. As they have no specific attributes, identification is hardly possible, unless we take the fmd spot into consideration. The lekythos was found in Eleusis, and therefore a tentative identification of the goddesses as Demeter and Kore may not be too farfetched. The sacrificial procession is split in two parts. From the right approach the kaneph6ros, and two men and a woman holding twigs. A man leading an ox by a rope and holding twigs comes from the left. If any meaning should be read intI? this disposition, it may be that the procession has arrived in the sanctuary and that the various participants are now taking up their positions round the altar. Apollo The sacrificial procession to Apollo on a red figure volute-krater [Fig. 13, V78: Ferrara T 57 c VP] is considerably later than the pictures we have 22 For the Ikarios interpretation see Mommsen 1975, nr. 106, with references to older literature; also Angiolillo, DArch N.S. 3, 1 (1981) 13-22. 23 Boardman 1974, 65; see also Mommsen 1975, 68. PRE-KILL 21 seen so far, dating from the third quarter of the fifth century B. C. On the right Apollo is seated in his temple, indicated by columns and entablature; he holds a laurel branch, and his quiver hangs on the wall. Outside the temple, there is a tripod on the right, on the left another tripod and the omphalos covered by the agrenon. A man holding a staff stands in front of the temple, facing the cortege which comes from the left. The kane-ph6ros leading the procession wears a richly decorated ependytes over her chiton.24 The kanoun is of the elaborate high-handled type, almost cer-tainly made of metal. To the left, behind the kaneph6ros, stand two youths on either side of a tall thymiaterion, then follow a youth carrying a phiale and three more youths, two of whom lead two bulls by ropes tied to their horns. Both victims are adorned with fillets hung over their horns. It is usually assumed that the scene is situated in Delphi, and that we have here the arrival in Delphi of an Athenian procession on the occasion of a PythaiS.25 There is no particular objection to this interpretation, apart from the fact that it may be more specific than the iconography allows. Omphalos and tripods are at home in any sanctuary of Apollo (Pythios), anywhere. An interpretation of the scene as an Athenian festival, situated in the Athenian Pythion, is therefore equally acceptable.26 One might think of the Thargelia. A lex sacra containing regulations for this festival mentions a procession, the sacred kanoun, and the sacrifice of several bovine victims.27 Admittedly, this inscription is much later (129/8 B.C.), but the provisions are presented as both it continuation and an enhance-ment of the traditional observances.28 BOIOTIAN A Boiotian black figure plate of about the middle of the sixth century B.

Behind her there are a huge snake on a sort of pedestal, 30 and a column indicating the temple. In front of Athena stands a flaming altar on which a bird (hardly an owl) is perched. The procession, approaching from the left, is made up of a kaneph6ros, a bullIed by two men (the first one holds a rope attached to one foreleg of the victim, the second one holds two ropes tied to both its hind legs); a pipe-player walks behind the bull, between the two bull handlers. Then follow four men carrying wreaths, an oinochoe, and knives (or, less likely, short sticks), then four figures in a country cart drawn by two mules, one of whom, the driver, holds a whip, and another one holds a wreath. Behind the cart walks a man holding a long stick or a spear. Finally there are six lively men and a goat, who mayor may not belong to the same scene. This picture has been tentatively interpreted as a procession to Athena Itonia at Koroneia.3 1 This sanctuary was an important one in Boiotia, where the Pamboiotian games also took place.32 Therefore one can easily imagine that for a contemporary Boiotian the picture on our plate would evoke memories of the festivities at that sanctuary. On the other hand, there are no specific elements that would not equally well fit any other Athena festival. CORINTHIAN N early all sacrificial scenes on vases from Corinth are of the Middle Corinthian period (c. 600-575 B.C.). There usually is a female kane-phOros, carrying on her head a kanoun of a distinctive type. Its shape is best seen on a fragment of a carefully drawn krater [Fig. 15, V326: Corinth T -132]. The \"kanoun\" lacks the three vertical projections or handles: it is a flat tray with a narrow rim, clearly made of metal. Often loop handles are riveted to the bottom to facilitate balancing the tray on the head. Typically this tray contains a couple of conical oinochoai and a (probably cylindrical) box or basket of medium hight. One Corinthian 29 A comparison of Boiotian, Corinthian and Attic festival scenes: Scheffer, in: Hagg (ed.) 1992, 117-141. 30 For the snake accompanying Athena cf. the Attic black figure hydria of the late sixth century B.C. [V53: Art marketl. 31 I.a. Ure, lHS 49 (1929) 168-169; Sparkes, lHS 87 (1967) 121. 32 Schachter 1981, 117-127. PRE-KILL 23 kaneph6ros precariously carries two such trays, one above the other [V329: Philadelphia MS 552]. A regular sacrificial procession, not unlike the Attic ones, is depicted on an amphoriskos in Oslo [Fig. 16, Vl17: Oslo 6909 No.5]. The proces-sion comprises three kanephOroi, a bull, with a fillet hanging from his horns, driven by a man, a female pipe-player, and two women. The contents of the tray of the third kaneph6ros are atypical: between the two conical oinochoai a heap of black dots is depicted, which were interpreted by Eitrem as barley corns (o/al).33 There is no clue as to the recipient deity. Furthermore, kaneph6roi occur on several Corinthian vases in the context of the Frauen/est-theme. This subject was treated in depth by I. Iucker. 34 She has argued that chains of women dancing, padded dancers, and \"domestic scenes\" (women spinning and women with children), are to be identified as different aspects of a single festival, which she tentatively attributes to Artemis. Others have attributed the Corinthian Frauenfest to Hera Akraia, or Demeter, Kore and the Fates, or Athena Ergane.3 5 Amyx, however, has cautioned (quite rightly, I think) against the danger of overinterpreting these scenes: \"A determined sceptic might well object that processions and chain or ring-dances are a common feature of Greek culture, from the Bronze Age to modern times. It might therefore be argued that a Corinthian representation of a ring-dance would, per se, yield no clues as to the specific occasion to which this (krticular case applied -and that we have no assurance that all such representations refer to a single festival. \"36 On some of the Frauen/est-vases, kaneph6roi are accompanied by sacrificial animals: cows or bulls [Vl15: Athens NM Per 2066; cf. V114: Athens NM Per 1578], a goat [Vl18: Paris CM 94], and perhaps a young kid [Vl16: Munich 7741]. Finally, a fragmentary Corinthian oinochoe found in Aigina deserves to be mentioned [V 113: Aigina K 340], because it is probably the earliest surviving Greek vase painting of a sacrifice (ca. 650 B.C.).

General observations We have seen that even the more comprehensive depictions of sacrificial processions only in the rarest cases can be conclusively attributed to one particular festival. One factor here, of course, is our lack of knowledge, the extent of which should never be underestimated. But on the other hand, it could be observed that even quite detailed representations are more often than not remarkably unspecific, so that it is hard to see how even a well informed contemporary Greek could have established, which festival was meant. It would seem that perhaps it did not matter very much. That would also seem to follow from the fact that in addition to the more comprehensive pictures there are a considerable number that are highly selective. These only depict one or more figures leading one or more sacrificial animals, maybe accompanied by a pipe-player, 37 elements, in short, that could be part of any sacrificial procession. And these \"in-complete\" pictures are not just the products of sloppiness or disinterest. Some are painted with care and attention to detail, such as an early red figure lekythos by the Gales Painter [Fig. 17, V74: Boston 13.195]. The vase painter has skilfully varied the pose of the two youths holding sprigs who lead two cows to sacrifice. The red-and-white stemmata hanging over the cows' horns are among the finest in Greek sacrificial iconography. The kanephoros at the front of the cortege is beautifully draped and has a broad fillet round her head. But the sanctuary where this procession is going to is only summarily indicated by a single column with a red fillet tied round it. All in all, a detailed but absolutely unspecific picture. What the market wanted, and what vase painters aimed at, apparently, were rather generalized depictions of festive sacrificial processions. Naturally the vase painter might introduce, from some recent experience or a particularly lively memory, elements belonging to a specific festival, but that would be incidental. Any nice picture evoking the general idea of festive sacrifice was equally satisfactory. 38 37 E.g. [VI2: Athens NM 18568; V35: New Orleans; V36: Orvieto 1001; V42: Rome VG; V82: Ferrara T 734 VT; V84: Florence V 45; V85: Leipzig 2655; V76: Cambridge, Ma. , 1959.129; V99: Art marketl. 38 Similarly, when religious festivals are remembered, usually with great pleasure, in comedy, the reference sometimes is not to specific festivals but to festive occasions PRE-KILL 25 Without kaneph6ros Sacrifices on votive pots A number of pictures show an animal being led to sacrifice, without any indication that a full scale festive procession was involved. The kanoun, in these cases (if it is depicted), is typically held in one hand by a male figure. Some of these vase paintings may refer to private sacrifices, and in certain instances, where we happen to know that they were found in a sanctuary, it is probable that the pots had been placed there as votive offerings. In such cases we should consider the possibility that they may have been special commissions, decorated by the vase painter with a picture appropriate to the particular purpose they were to serve. There are, in fact, pots with votive inscriptions that were painted on before firing.39 In the absence of such inscriptions, we cannot be certain, but there may be other indications that the subject of the decoration was chosen with a view to the pot's use as a votive offering for a specific occasion. We shall consider some fmds from the Athenian Akropolis, which, on account of their provenance, may with a fair degree of proba-bility be regarded as votives to Athena. On fraginents of a black figure amphora of Panathenaic shape (but not, judging from its decoration, a regular prize amphora), dating from the end of the sixth century B.C., we have the remains of five male figures, all holding twigs [Fig. 18, V16: Athens NM Akr 842]. The foremost of them leads a goat by a rope, and carries a Panathenaic amphora on his shoulder. In all likelihood this represents a victor in the Panathenaic games, accom-panied by friends and family, on his way to the Akropolis to sacrifice a goat as a thank-offering, and to dedicate part of his prize as a tithe to the goddess.40 in general: e.g. Aristophanes , Pax 337-345. 39 E.g. from the Athenian Akropolis: Graef & Langlotz II 142, Index II C. An Attic black figure Siana cup found in Boiotia has a dedication to Apollo, painted before firing: Boston MFA 03.852, Brijder 1983, cat. nr. 14, pI. 10 b; Immerwahr 1990, nr. 68.

A fillet is hung over its head, and ropes are tied to one foreleg and one hind leg and held by boys on the far left and right of the picture. A man walking on the further side of the victim carries the kanoun in one hand. There is another man carrying an amphora on his shoulder (now largely lost), followed by a pipe-player and two kithara-players. The names painted above and alongside the figures (not without the occasional misspelling) suggest that the picture refers to a specific occasion. The same applies to the representation on the neck of a red figure loutrophoros, again of the late sixth century [Fig. 20, V67: Athens NM Akr 636]. A family (?) of two men and two women, all carrying twigs, follow a large sow which a youth drives forward with a stick. Only the lower part is preserved of another male figure, walking in front, who holds an oinochoe in his right hand (in the lacuna a kanoun may have been depicted, held in his other hand). The sow appears to be pregnant. We know from inscriptions with leges sacrae that on some occasions the sacrifice of a pregnant victim was prescribed.41 On a very fragmentary red figure krater of the middle or early third quarter of the fifth century, the subjects of the decoration suggest that it may have been especially made as a votive offering, dedicated by the potter himself to his patron goddess Athena [Fig. 21, V 69: Athens NM Akr 739]. What remains of the upper zone shows some figures at work in a potter's workshop. In the lower zone youths lead a ram to sacrifice. The krater may have been a very appropriate aparche of a potter or a vase painter, showing both the source of the income from which the tithe is taken, and the sacrifice that accompanied its dedication. From the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in Eleusis we have two fragments of a cylindrical pot, perhaps a pyxis or a miniature kiste, 41 SEG 33 (1983) 147, 38-39: (Thorikos), 38-39: a pregnant ewe (?) to Demeter. -LS 18 (Erchia), E 16-21: a pregnant ewe to Ge. -LSS 18 (Paiania), B 29-30: a pregnant sow for the Antheia. -LS 20 (Marathonian Tetrapolis), A 28: a pregnant ewe; A 43: a pregnant sow; B 9: a pregnant cow to Ge; B 12: a pregnant ewe to Daira; B 48: a pregnant sow to Eleusinia; B 49: a pregnant sow to Chloe, -LSS 19 (Salaminioi), 92: a pregnant ewe to Athena Skiras. -LS 96 (Mykonos), 11-13: two sows, one of which pregnant, to Demeter Chloe; 16: a sow, pregnant for the first time, to Demeter. -LS 151 (Kos), A 55-56: a pregnant ewe to Athena Polias; A 59-60: a pregnant ewe to Demeter; B 2: a pregnant ewe to Rhea. -LS 154 (Kos), B 37-46. -LSS 87 (Lindos): a pregnant ewe (?) and sow to Demeter. -LSA 41 (Miletus), 6: a pregnant white ewe to Hera Antheie. See Nilsson 1967, 151. PRE-KILL 27 decorated with a polychrome relief representation [VI04: Eleusis]; it is dated to the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. One fragment preserves Demeter seated on a kiste beside a thymiaterion. On the other fragment are two male figures, one of whom holds a stick-like object in his left hand, and carries a small animal in his right hand. The relief is very worn and details are unclear, but a comparison with, for instance, the relief scene on the shoulder of the somewhat later hydria which is known as the \"Regina Vasorum\" [Fig. 22, V103: Saint Petersburg St 525], suggests that the figure on the fragment in Eleusis is an initiate with the mystic piglet and bcilcchos. 42 Subject and [md spot of the unusual Eleusin-ian fragments make their interpretation as a specially commissioned votive pot plausible. Sacrifices at herms On the vases in this class that were not, as far as we can see, connected with any particular occasion, but bore a depiction of a sacrifice as a subject of a vaguely general interest, sacrifices at herms are strikingly well represented (as they are, incidentally, in representations of the later phases of the sacrificial ritual). Herms of the quadrangular type, Thoukydides tells us, were a local phenomenon in Athens, generally to be found at the doorways of private houses and in sanctuaries. 43 This passage is well illustrated by an Attic red figure loutrophoros with a representation of a procession conveying the water for the bridal bath towards a herm and an altar standing at a house door, 44 and by a votive relief from the Athenian 42 On the XOlPO~ lluo'tl1CO~ see the Introduction 1.2. Metzger 1965, 34/4, is uncertain of the species of the animal: \"porc ou chien?\"; Zervoudaki, AM 83 (1968) 451111: \"Hund? Kein ferkel\". The Regina Vasorum with its magnificent Eleusinian scene is usualy regarded as Attic; e.g. Metzger 1951, 251; Schwarz 1987,57 V 149; Zervoudaki, AM 83 (1968) 36/77, thinks it is \"Unteritalisch, wahrscheinlich kampanisch, attischen Arbeiten sehr nahe. \" 43 Thoukydides VI 27, 1 (the mutilation of the herms in 415 B.C.): EV /lE 'tOi)'tOl, OOOt :Epllat ~oav ~l9tvot EV 'tfj 1tOAEt 'tfj 'A911valOOv (EiOt /lE Ka'ta 'to E1ttXWPtOv, ~ 'tE'tpayOlvo~ EpyaOta, 1tOAAOt Kat £V i/llOt~ 1tp09ilpOt~ Kat EV iEPOt~), Ilt~ VUK'tt oi 1tAEtO'tOt 1tEptEK01tll0av 'ta 1tpOOOl1ta.

It follows from the above that the presence of a herm in a sacrificial scene may mean no more than a rather general indication of the setting: a sacrifice in some sanctuary (for herms could be encountered in any sanctuary), or, if we think of the herms at the doors of private houses, a domestic sacrificial ceremony. At least there is something distinctly domestic about the boy at a herm, catching a pig by one hind leg, on another pelike by the Pan Painter [V71: Berlin 1962.62].48 The lonely ram, nibbling at a twig from an altar at a herm, on an (early Campanian?) red figure krater [Fig. 23, V70: Berlin F 3011], has a certain rural flavour. Two late sixth century Attic black figure vases have more conventional pictures of sacrifices. A goat is led to the altar at a herm by two men holding twigs, one of them also carrying the kanoun [Fig. 24, V52: Art market], or by .a pipe-player and a man holding twigs [V54: P.c. Abbe Mignot]. Outside Attika the motif also occurs. From the second half of the fifth century we have two Boiotian Cabiran skyphoi, one with a sow, the other with a bull being led towards a herm [Fig. 25 and 26, VI10: Athens NM 426 and V112: Cassel]. A much later Campanian bell-krater, of the third quarter of the fourth century B. C., has a fairly elaborate scene [Fig. 27, V 124: Port Sunlight 45 For the general occurence of Hekateia at doors and entrances cf.

PRE-KILL 29 5008]. 49 A herm is approached from the left by a boy leading a goat, and a man. On the right of the herm is a youth holding the kanoun and a phiale, and another youth with his right hand raised in prayer. Above hangs a homed animal-skull, decorated with fillets. To return to Attika and Athens: herms, as we saw, were fairly ubiqui-tous there, but they had accumulated particularly densely in one spot, near the northwestern entrance to the Athenian agora, which could therefore simply be referred to as \"The Herms\". 5 0 And there, among The Herms, we know of one specific monument, comprising three herms, set up by Kimon and his colleagues in commemoration of their victory over the Persians at Eion in Thrace, in 476/5 B.C .51 J. de la Geniere has proposed to recognize this monument on a fragmentary pelike by that great herm-lover, the Pan Painter, dated about 470 B.C. [V308: Paris Louvre C 10793].52 The picture on one side shows two herms facing each other, and a third, frontal one between them. The other side has a girl carrying a kanoun on her head, and a young man handling a hydria; clearly some sacrificial ritual is meant. The lower part of the picture is missing; a sacrificial animal might have been depicted there, but there does not seem to be much room for it. De la Geniere's identification of the triple herm monument is attrac-tive, and other scholars have generally followed her. 53 We must, however, keep in mind that multiple herm monuments were not uncommon. On a black figure pelike, which antedates the capture of Eion by a good quarter of a century [Fig. 28, V38: Paestum], a man holding an elaborate kanoun decorated with sprigs leads a ram to a group of three herms on the right. Of the three herms, one is much smaller than the other two. A fourth, single herm frames the picture on the left.

We have several vase paintings with worshippers at two herms.54 The most interesting one is on a black figure skyphos of the late sixth century B .C. [Fig. 29, VII: Athens NM 12531]. On the right is a high stepped base surmounted by two herms facing each other, with an altar in be-tween. A youth carrying on his head a kanoun with fillets hanging from it climbs the steps. He is followed by a man leading a sturdy he-goat, whose horns are hung with fillets, a man carrying two baskets on a pole over his shoulder, and a pipe-player. The double herm monument depicted on this vase has such a distinctive shape, that it seems likely that a well known real monument (or perhaps rather shrine) was meant, which the contempo-rary public would have recognized. 55 Mythical sacrifices Mythical representations of animals being led to sacrifice add little to what we have seen so far. There is a small number of Attic late black figure vases, on which Herakles is seen leading or driving a bull. 56 In some instances the bull is clearly identified as a sacrificial victim by the custom-ary stemmata hung over his horns. The best example is a bilingual am-phora by the Andokides Painter [V378: Boston MFA 99.538]. It has the same subject in black figure on one side and in red figure on the other. Herakles is fully equipped with his lion's skin, bow and quiver, and club. In his left hand he holds a bundle of spits (obeloO,5? and a rope which is tied to the bull's horns. Two wine-skins are suspended from his left arm. The bull is adorned with the sacrificial stemmata. The episode must no doubt be identified with Herakles' sacrifice at Lindos, succinctly related by Apollodoros as follows: \"And traversing Asia he put in to Thermydrai, the harbour of the Lindians. And having loosed one of the bullocks from 54 See Webster and Osborne (previous note). Also J. Marcade, BCH 76 (1952) 596-624; Metzger 1965, 77 ff. 55 A.

These objects have been called various things by various scholars, but this need not concern us any longer since U. Kron, Jdl 86 (1971) 131-144, conclusively identified them as a bundle of spits. PRE-KILL 31 the cart of a cowherd, he sacrificed it and feasted (EUroXE110 8ucra<;). But the cowherd, unable to protect himself, stood on a certain mountain and cursed. Wherefore to this day, when they sacrifice to Herakles, they do it with curses. \"58 The spits Herakles carries on the Boston amphora will be put to good use when the animal has been slaughtered and the meat is prepared for the feast. 59 2.1.2. Preliminary rituals performed at the altar This group consists of vase paintings in which the sacrificial animal is still alive and well, held ready at the altar, where the rites are performed that precede the actual killing of the victim. Basket and basin (kanoun and chernips) A not very large but closely coherent iconographical series of Attic red figure vase paintings of the Classical period is defined by the following motif: at the altar a young man stands holding the kanoun in his slightly raised left hand, and a container in his lowered right hand; a bearded man standing next to him stretches out his hands towards that container, or dips them into it. The container in question is of a distinctive shape. It has an angular proftie with concave sides, widening slightly towards the top, and is provided with small handles, only one of which is visible on the side facing the viewer. The clearest depictions leave no doubt that it was made of metal. The identification of this container can not have posed any problems to a Classical Athenian, who must have seen it regularly at the sacrifices he attended. Fortunately for us, who lack his experience, it occurs in a well defmed iconographical context, which refers to a ritual reality that is also the subject of several literary texts. The most informative one is a passage ~ Aristophanes' comedy Peace, which was produced at the City Dionysia m 421 B.C. Towards the end of the play, Trygaios, an Attic farmer tired of ten years of war, decides to found a cult of Eirene. Naturally this foundation requires a sacrifice, and a considerable part of the rest of the play is taken up by the sacrificial ritual which is performed on the stage. 58 Apollodoros, Bibliotheca II 5, 11; translation Sir James George Frazer (Loeb ed.), where also the other testimonia are listed. 59 Durand 1986,145-173."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I I 32 CHAPTER TWO There is, of course, the occasional lapse into comic exaggeration, but basically the poet conforms to the normal ritual of contemporary sacrifice as his audience knew it.

Trygaios commands the slave: \"Now go and get the sheep and bring it as quickly as possible. I shall provide an altar on which to sacrifice. ,,60 They both go inside, after a bit Trygaios returns with a portable altar, and then goes in again to get the kanoun: \"The kanoun is present, containing barley corns and fillet and knife, and here is fire, so nothing keeps you except the sheep.\" The chorus urges Trygaios to hurry because otherwise a certain Chairis, a notoriously bad pipe-player, might come and inflict himself upon them. When the slave is back, with a suitable sheep, Trygaios instructs him: \"Come on now, you take the kanoun and the chernips and walk quickly round the altar from left to right.\" The slave: \"There! You can give the next order: I have gone right round.\" Trygaios: \"Well then, I'll take this piece of firewood and dip it in. (To the sheep:) You, shake quickly! (To the slave:) And you, hand me some of the barley corns, and you too wash your hands after having handed over this (con-tainer) to me, and throw some of the barley to the audience. ,,61 At this point we shall leave Trygaios and his assistant, for the moment. In the preliminary ritual, before the killing of the sheep, they use two main implements.

The other one is called chernips, i.e. water for washing the hands (also, a container holding such water). 62 The acolyte holds both in his hands, carries them round the altar. The text implies that at some moment Try-gaios has washed his hands in the chernips, for later on he takes over the basin so that the slave can wash his hands too, but before that, Trygaios has dipped a burning piece of wood from the altar into it and sprinkled the animal, in order to induce it to shudder. Apparently the slave too, at some point, has sprinkled water, with rather a generous hand, for a bit later on he alludes to the fact that some of the audience have got wet through \"because we pour so much water over them. ,,63 Trygaios, after having sprinkled the sheep, takes some barley corns from the kanoun proffered by the slave, but it is not clear from this passage what he does with them. Other barley corns are thrown among the audience by the slave. In Aristophanes' Birds, Pisthetairos, when preparing to sacrifice to the \"new gods\" (i.e. the birds), tells his slave to pick up the kanoun and the chernips, and, after some interference, orders him to go round with the chemips.64 And in the Lysistrata we learn that water is also sprinkled while the basin is carried round the altar. 65 New Comedy too has left us some passages in which kanoun and chernips are mentioned together as things that must be ready before the sacrificial ceremony can begin.66 62 See also Athenaios IX, 409 a-c. The vessel as such was probably also called XEP-VI~ElOV; several of these are mentioned in Athenian inventories (4th century B.C.): IG IF 1400, 41 and 50-51; 1413, 1; 1415, 1-2 (two silver ones weighing 1050 drachmae and 940? drachmae); 1421, III 69; 1474, 18-20.

Tragedy has myths as subjects, events that were attributed to a distant past. For the practicalities of sacrificial ritual, however, the poet would usually draw on the ritual of his own time, although the tragic sacrifices themselves might be far from commonplace.6 7 Thus we find the kanoun and the lustral water together again, the circling of the altar, and the dipping of the piece of firewood into the chernips, in Euripides' Herakles.68 And in his Jphigeneia in Aulis the familiar carrying round the altar of the kanoun and the simultaneous sprinkling of the cMrnips is performed by Achilles, acting as an acolyte at this human sacrifice.6 9 Already in one of the earliest sacrifices in Greek literature, on the occasion of Telernachos' visit to Pylos in the 3rd book of the Odyssey, one of Nestor's sons, assisting his father, holds a basin with water to wash the hands in one hand, and the kanoun containing barley corns in the other. 70 Finally, that cMrnips and kanoun were not just any two among many sacrificial utensils, can be inferred from the fact that Demosthenes in his law-court speech against Androtion uses the expression \"handling cMr-Ka.Va 1tpOX£tpa., xEPVlj3W;, S'Il,,:rlj!a.'ta. 1tOlEt'tE.

In the present case, it is fortu-nately enough for us to confidently recognize the container which the acolyte holds together with the kanoun as the cMrnipS.72 On a bell-krater in Agrigento of about 425 B.C. [Fig. 30, V127: Agrigento 4688], Apollo, holding a laurel branch, is seated on the right, inside a temple which is indicated by a column and architrave. In front of the temple, more or less in the centre of the picture, is the altar, at which stands the young man holding the kanoun (in the shape of a flat tray, probably with three sprigs projecting from the rim) and the chernips, in which'a bearded man dips his hands. On the left of the altar we have the victim, a he-goat held steady by a youth, and a pipe-player. In the back-ground, behind the altar, is a column surmounted by a tripod, and on the left a slender tree. A fragment in Oxford [Fig. 31, V134: Oxford 1954. 261] preserves little more than the cMrnips, the hand holding it, and two hands dipped into it, and part of the top of the altar on which there is a small amorphous heap of something or other. The central scene of the Agrigento krater is repeated on a bell-krater in Boston [Fig. 32, V131: Boston 95.25], which also has a small heap on top of the altar. Here, the recipient god is not depicted; on the right stands another bearded man, leaning on a staff. The victim, on the left of the altar, in this case is a ram. Above the figures hang a garland and a homed skull adorned with a fillet. Name-inscriptions were painted above all figures. The names, from left to right: Kallias, Mantitheos, (the name of 71 Demosthenes, 22 (Kara A VOPOTlwvo\\:, ca , 354/3 v.C.), 78: Uj!Ete; Ii' Eie; 'tou't' w iivlipEe; 'AS11Va.tOl 1tP01lXS11't' EU11SEla.e; Ka.i Pt;(S'Ilj!la.e;, roo't' oUlle 'tOla.U'ta.

Beazley has tentatively identified the figures with some right-wing, antidemocratic elements in late fifth-century Athens.73 Although the identification of historical personalities on the basis of first names only (without patronymic or demotikon) is notoriously unreliable, in this case it is perhaps slightly less so, because Aresias is a relatively uncommon name. On another bell-krater of the same period [Fig. 33, Vl30: Boston 95.24] the bearded sacrificer is about to wash his hands, and the sacrificial animal is again a ram, but other details vary. The acolyte holds a proper kanoun, not the flat tray. The rather low altar is of a distinctive shape, built of irregular stones covered by a slab, with a small pile of firewood on top of it. A young man is seated on the right, but there is no pipe-player. In the background there are two trees, and, partly obscured by the hilly landscape, Hermes in the upper left comer and a youth in the upper right comer. Finally, on a bell-krater in The Hague [Fig. 34, Vl36: The Hague OC(ant) 5-71] the representation is reduced to the acolyte holding kanoun and chernips, the sacrificer (in this instance a beardless youth) washing his hands, a youth holding the sacrificial ram, and the altar with a homed skull hanging above it. Earlier, shortly before the middle of the fifth century, we already fmd the association of kanoUn and cbernips in the picture of the inside tondo of a kylix [Fig. 35, Vl37: Vatican]. Both are held by the typical youthful acolyte, standing beside a table with a twig lying on it. The cbernips-vessel is of a slightly different, less angular shape than the ones on the vases studied above, but there can be no reasonable doubt about its identification. On the outside of this kylix we have, on the obverse and reverse respectively, a bull and a ram being led to sacrifice by a similar youth holding the kanoun. A bell-krater in Istanbul, also dated a little before the middle of the fifth century [VI32: Istanbul], poses a problem. A sacrifice of a sheep to Apollo is depicted. A youth standing at the blood-stained altar holds in his left hand the kanoun with largish twigs set in the three handles, and in his right hand a plate or shallow bowl. On the basis of the representations 73 Beazley, AlA 33 (1929) 366-7. PRE-KILL 37 listed above, one might be tempted to see here an alternative form of the cbernips-vessel, although it seems rather too shallow and is held a bit too high for a convenient washing of the hands. The bearded sacrificer holds his right hand over this vessel, while his opened left hand points down-wards towards the altar and the head of the sacrificial animal. A possible, but far from certain, interpretation of his gesture could be, that he is sprinkling water from the shallow vessel onto the victim' s head with his bare hands, instead of with the piece of burning firewood that is regularly used for that purpose in the texts quoted above. If true, this would be a unique depiction of that part of the preliminary ritual, which is otherwise absent from our vase paintings. Another feature which is mentioned in the texts but not found in the vase paintings, is the carrying round the altar of kanoun and cbernips. With the one possible exception of the Istanbul krater, the cbernips is always depicted in an etymological fashion, so to speak, i.e. in being used to wash the hands. The central theme of this group of Attic vases of the Classical period, with the acolyte holding kanoun and cbernips, is taken up again, about a century later, on a Campanian bell-krater with a sacrifice to Apollo [Vl38: Paris Louvre K 5]. Here the sacrificial animal is not depicted.74 An Attic calyx-krater of the first half of the fourth century B.C., representing preliminary rites at the altar but lacking the cbernips-vessel, is best appended here [Fig. 36, V128: Athens NM 12491]. On the right of the altar, with the firewood neatly arranged on top, stands a bearded man. He bends over the altar and with both hands appears to deposit something on it. Judging from the position of his hands, it may have been a garland that was painted on, but is now no longer visible on the vase. Behind him, on the right, the victim stands ready, held by a youth; it is a white pig adorned with a fillet or garland surrounding its belly. 75 On the left of the altar stands another bearded man, holding sprigs in his left hand, and with his right hand taking something from a kanoun, with sprigs projecting from the three handles, which is proffered by a youth standing on the far left. In the background behind the altar is a column surmounted by a 74 Trendall, LCS 260, interprets the picture as a sacrifice to Poseidon, whom he sees in the seated figure on the right. It seems to me that what this figure holds is a sceptre ending in an outsize floral bud, rather than a trident. The youth seated in the upper zone beside a small temple and holding a laurel branch should be Apollo. 75 See below 5. 1."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"38 CHAPTER TWO votive pinax or relief, or possibly a small shrine.76 A horned skull hangs on the right of it, and part of a skull with the horns attached on the left. The absence of the chernips, though in reality it would normally be in view during this part of the rites, is a useful reminder to us that vase painters were under no obligation to be exhaustive in their depictions. The picture does not show what the man on the left is taking from the kanoun, but from what we are told of its usual contents, a handful of barley corns (olai) would seem the most likely. Neither is there any clue in this picture as to where these will be scattered. What evidence we have on the subject is not entirely unambiguous. According to some passages in tragedies by Euripides, the olai (poetically called prochUtai) are thrown on the altar, 77 or more precisely into the fire that is already burning on it. 78 According to scholia on Aristophanes, however, they were sprinkled over the head of the sacrificial animal. 79 Of course, the one need not exclude the other, and it is entirely acceptable that Euripides, for instance, taking for granted a general familiarity of his audience with the sacrificial ritual, did not feel the need to be exhaustive any more than our vase painters did. As we saw earlier, in the sacrificial scene in Aristophanes' Peace part of the barley corns were thrown among the audience.8o This suggests that in normal sacrificial procedure, barley corns would be scattered not only over the altar and the victim, but also over the participants in the cere-mony. On closer inspection, however, the passage in Aristophanes might seem a little suspect as evidence, for the throwing of barley among the 76 See Van Straten, in: Le sanctuaire gre c (Entretiens Hardt 37, 1992) 254-264. 77 Euripides, Electra 803-4: A.uj3wv liE npoxu'tw; ~11'tpOe; Euvi:'tlle; OESEV Ej3uUE j3Ol~oue;, ... 78 Euripides, /phigenia Aulidensis (406 B.C.), 1111-2: roc; XEpvlj3Ee; ncipElol Eu'tpEnlo~Evul, npoxu'tul 'tE j3ciA.A.El v nup KUScipOLOV XEPOtV; and 1470-1: KUVa o· EVUPXEOSOl ne;, UlSEOSOl OE nup npoXU'tUle; KuSupoiolOl ... 79 Scholion Aristophanes Nubes 260: (Sokrates sprinkles someone with grit) KuScinEp 'to. tEPEtU 'tUte; OUA.Ute; Ot SUOV'tEe;. -Scholion (vetus) Equites 1167: EK 'trov OA.rov· OA.ui ut ~ES' ciA.rov ~E~lY~EVUl KPlSui, KUt 'tOtC; SU~UOlV Enlj3UA.A.6~EVUl. -See also Dionysios of Halikarnassos VII 72, 15: o'llv'tEA.EoSEiOlle; OE 'tfie; no~nfje; Ej30'llSU't0'llV EMue; 0\\ 'tE unu'tol KUt 'trov tEPEOlV oie; OOLOV, KUt 0 'trov S'IlllnOA.lrov 'tponoe; 0 uU'toe; TtV 'tiiJ nup' l]~tv.

PRE-KILL 39 audience leads up to an obscene joke a little further on, which plays on the double meaning of krithe (barley corn and membrum virile).81 To prepare the way for this joke, Aristophanes may have exercised a little poetic licence with regard to the details of real ritual, though perhaps not to the extent of wholly inventing the scattering of barley over people. However that may be, a red figure kylix of the late sixth century B.C. [Fig. 37, V315: Wiirzburg 474] may provide some additional evidence that olai would also be thrown to the people attending the ceremony. The picture on one side of the cup shows a man holding a large kanoun in his left hand and putting something on an altar with his right hand. What it is he places on the altar cannot be distinguished, but one assumes that it would be a handful of barley taken from the basket. On the left, behind this man, are two youths with kylikes. On the right is a youth pouring a libation from a kantharos onto the altar, and behind him, on the far right, a man leaning on a staff and gesturing with his right arm. Names are inscribed next to most of the figures.82 But in front of the man on the far right is written: Kat OEUp(O), \"hither too!\". These must be words spoken by that man, which, accompanied by his lively gesture, probably mean that he wants some of the barley to be thrown his way. 83 This sort of showering, like the katachusmata at a wedding, was believed to have a generally beneficiary effect. 84 81 Aristophanes, Pax 963-7: TP.

I 40 CHAPTER TWO Finally it should be noted that most of the vase paintings in this section give no indication at all as to the identity of the god to whom the sacrifice is made. Apparently interest was focused more on the content of the ritual than on its direction. The gods that are depicted are Hermes (once, on [V130: Boston 95.24], but his position in the picture is such that it is by no means certain that he is the recipient of the sacrifice), and Apollo (twice on Attic vases [V127: Agrigento 4688; V132: Istanbul] and once on a Campanian one [V138: Paris Louvre K 5]). So Apollo is in the majority, for what it is worth. It may not be significant; Apollo has a tendency in this period to intrude in all sorts of scenes where he does not really belong.85 Kanoun and chernips in mythical sacrifices The figure of the acolyte holding kanoun and chernips is also found on several vase paintings with mythical sacrifices, all from the second half of the fifth century (mostly towards the end) and the first quarter of the fourth century B.C. Herakles' sacrifice to Chryse On his way to Troy, Herakles visited the island of Cbryse near Lemnos and there offered sacrifice to the homonymous goddess. This event forms the subject of a small number of Attic red figure vase paintings.86 For the identification of the scene a bell krater of the late fifth century, which has the names of the figures inscribed, is important [Fig. 38, V371: Vienna IV 1144].87 In the centre is a rustic altar of rough stones covered by a slab, on which a small fire is burning. Behind the altar there is a column supporting a statue of a goddess in archaic style (Cbryse). To the left of the altar stands Herakles, turning and beckoning to Ioleos on the far left, who is leading a bull with a fillet on its horns to the altar. On the right stands Nike, who here acts as acolyte, holding the kanoun (a flat tray with 85 For the\" Apollinisation\" of mythical iconography in the Classical period, see Moret, RA (1982) 109-136. 86 Hooker, lHS 70 (1950) 35-41; Froning 1971, 52-66; Froning, Chryse I, LIMC III (1986) 279-281; Boardman et al., Herakies, LIMC V (1990) 1-192, esp. 112: \"Herakles' sacrifice to Chryse\". 87 Inscriptions: 'IOA£We; 'HpuKAfje; XpU01] NiK1]. PRE-KILL 41 th ree sprigs projecting from its rim) and the chernips. On the far right is a boy (unnamed) taking the lid off a cylindrical box or basket (kfste). The curious rustic altar recurs in all, and the archaic image in most of the vase paintings in this series. On all vases except the one in Vienna, a young man acts as acolyte. On a fragmentary calyx-krater, also of the late fifth century, he is missing, but part of the characteristic chernips-vessel survives [V370: Taranto 52399]. Here the bull bends his head downwards, \"kneeling\" with one of his forelegs. The kiste is again present. A pelike from Kerch, of the same date, shows Herakles holding a garland in both hands, which may be intended for the adornment of the bull, who is quite lively here [Fig. 39, V369: Saint Petersburg KAB 43 fl. On a fragment of a slightly later krater of the same provenance, Herakles holds a stemma of the type that usually is hung over the horns of sacrificial bulls or cows [Fig. 40, V368: Saint Petersburg KAB 33 a]. On this fragment inscrip-tions with the names of the youth leading the bull (Lichas) and Herakles are preserved.88 On the earliest (probable) depiction of the story, a frag-ment of a krater of the third quarter of the fifth century B. C., one of the figures actually dips his hands in the chernips. This picture is somewhat different from the other ones, but the altar is the usual rustic one built of rough stones that appears to have been an essential feature of the story, maybe echoed by the words ~ro~ov E1CucEXrocr~£vov in the metrical hypothesis which is found in two manuscripts of Sophokles' Philoktetes.89 Theseus A fragmentary Attic krater from Serra di Vaglio, in the ornate style of the late fifth century B.C., has a picture which so far is unique in Attic iconography [Fig. 41, V431: Potenza 51534]. It is fortunate that the main figures have their names inscribed, otherwise the interpretation would have posed insuperable difficulties.90 Theseus and Peirithoos stand at a large altar; Peirithoos, who is smaller than Theseus, holds a huge elabo-rate kanoUn, obviously made of metal, in his left hand and the chernips in his right hand.91 On the right stands Leda (?), holding a garland, and behind her Helen.

The subject would seem to be an alternative, otherwise unattested, version of the abduction of Helen by Theseus, involving a marriage ceremony. 92 Oinomaos An Attic bell-krater of the early fourth century B.C. has a depiction of Oinomaos preparing to sacrifice a ram [Fig. 42, V408: Naples 2200]. The names of the main figures are inscribed.93 At an altar, in front of a column supporting an archaic image of Artelnis, stands Oinomaos in armour, and a youth holding kanoun and chernips. From the left a youth leads a ram towards the altar. On the right, Pelops and Hippodameia are making off in a four-horse chariot. In the upper zone are Myrtilos in a chariot, Posei-don, Athena, Zeus and Ganymedes, and a goddess.94 Iphigeneia in Tauris A picture on an Attic calyx-krater of the same period is clearly inspired by Euripides' Jphigeneia in Tauris [V398: Ferrara T 1145].95 The painter has composed several moments and characters from the play into a single picture. In the upper centre is a temple with an archaic statue of Artelnis, and a table standing in front of it. Wreaths and fillets hang on the back wall. To the left of the temple stands Iphigeneia, holding a large temple-key as a sign of her priestly status,96 and, in her right hand, the letter home.97 Orestes and Pylades are sitting on the rocks, underneath and on the left. Thoas is seated on a chair on the right. Higher up, to the right of the temple, stands a female attendant holding kanoun and (probably) chernips. Above her hang two homed skulls. The attendant holding 92 Cf.

PRE-KILL 43 kanoun and chernips may point to Iphigeneia's explanation of her task in the Tauric ritual of human sacrifice: she only performed the preliminary rites, the actual killing was done by others. 98 Beautifying the beast We have seen that the VlctilllS in sacrificial representations may be adorned with stemmata, bovine animals quite frequently, other species more rarely. The question arises, at what point in the ceremony the decoration of the animal took place. As the animals in representations of processions often are so adorned, it seems clear that, whenever there was a festive procession preceding the actual sacrifice, the fillets were attached before the start of the procession. The fillets set the animal apart from the rest of the herd or the flock, marking it as a hie ran, and it made the pompe more fun to watch. 99 If no procession was included in the ceremony, the fillets would be hung on the animal as part of the preliminary ritual at the altar. In one of the representations of the sacrifice to Chryse, Herakles holds the stemma ready to hang it on the bull's horns [V368: Saint Petersburg KAB 33 a]. An Apulian bell-krater of the second quarter of the fourth century B. C . has an unusual picture of Herakles sacrificing (there are none of the characteristics of the Chryse-sacrifice) [Fig. 43, V384: London F 66]. On the left of a blood-stained altar on which a small fire is burning, Nike is putting a wreath and a fillet on the head of a bull. Of the two bovine skulls hanging above, one is adorned with a similar fillet. Herakles stands at the altar holding a knife, and from the right approaches a woman carrying a plate with sprigs and a jug. The knife Herakles holds over the head of the bull may be poised for the killing, but I think that it is not meant that way. As we are so clearly in the first stage of the sacrificial ritual, it seems much more likely that Herakles here is going to use the knife to cut a few hairs from the bull' s forehead and throw them into the fire: a preliminary rite we have not encountered before, but which is well attested in our literary sources. In Euripides' Electra, for instance, \"Aigisthos from the 98 Euripides, Jphigenia Taurica 40-41: K<X'tapxoll<Xl IlEV, ocpaYl<X I)' iiAAOWlV IlEAEl iipP1l't' EOroSEv 'trovo' UV<XK'tOProV SEne;. 99 In modern Greece sacrificial bulls are adorned with an abundance of flowers : Aikaterinides 1979, pI. 1 (sacrificial procession in Lesbos in 1969)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"44 CHAPTER TWO basket took the straight-edged blade, and cut from the beast's head one tuft; with his right hand he placed this on the holy flame. ,,100 A fillet is hung on the head of a bull by a woman on an Attic red figure oinochoe of the third quarter of the fifth century [Fig. 44, V133: Laon 37. 1044], and two women are engaged in decorating two bovine animals in this manner on an Attic amphora of approximately the same period [Fig. 45, V87: London E 284]. The fact that the task is performed here by women calls for an explanation.lol The vase painting in London (and the one in Laon may well be an abbreviated version of the same motif) includes two large tripods, and through these is associated with a short series of vase paintings connected with Dithyrambic victories. 102 Typically these pictures comprise Nike, tripod, and sacrificial bull. Dithyrambic contests in Athens were tribal contests. After the victory, the successful choregos received, as representative of his tribe, a tripod which he erected at his own expense upon a monument. Of the many that once stood alongside the Street of the Tripods,103 the well known monu-ment of Lysikrates survives reasonably intact. 104 There is literary evidence that bulls were part of the prize too: Simonides boasts that he has won no less than fifty-six. 105 Though none of the relevant texts explicitly refers to Athens, the vase paintings do suggest that bulls and tripods went together. A pelike of the last quarter of the fifth century B.C. shows two Nikai and a bull at a large tripod [V65: Athens NM 16260]. One Nike restrains the bull by a rope, while the other is about to hang a stemma over its 100 Euripides, Electra 810-2: £Ie Kavou o' eArov AiYlcr6oC; op6i]v mpayioa, l10crxEiav 'tpixa 't£l1rov ECP' ayvov nup ii6T\\K£ O£~l~ (translation P .

In other pictures [V59: Athens; V72: Bologna 286], the bull already wears his fillet, and a Nike is engaged in decorating the tripod with ribbons and twigs. Sometimes satyrs, maenads and Dionysos are present. Though these are not mythical representations in the strict sense, the vase painters have the prizes of victory decorated by (the goddess of) Victory herself, thus lifting the event onto a somewhat more than human level. 106 A stamnos of the third quarter of the fifth century B. C . has a bull adorned with a fillet drinking from a basin, into which a Nike is pouring water from a hydria [Fig. 46, V90: Munich 2412]. A woman approaches the tripod, holding ribbons. This woman has no wings, so she is no Nike, but it would be incongruous to interpret her as a mere human being, because this would again raise the question: why a woman. Following Furtwangler's convincing interpretation,107 we may best take this woman, and the two on the amphora in London [V87: London E 284], as personi-fications of the victorious phylai, who, together with Nikai, perform the ritual acts that in down-to-earth reality would be performed by the human members of the tribe. Watering the bull before sacrifice, as seen on the Munich stamnos, is a feature we have not encountered so far. As Beazley saw, it is probably also the subject of a considerably earlier vase painting, on a stamnos of the beginning of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 47, V135: Paris Louvre C 10.754].108 Here we have a bull, and a large basin standing on the ground underneath its head. 109 A young man stands at the head of the bull, hold-ing one of its horns and patting its forehead, as though enticing it into having a drink. We do not know whether bovine victims were regularly gi ven to drink before sacrifice, and if so, why. It is obvious, however, 106 Cf. Moustaka et al., Nike, LIMe VI (1992) 850-904, esp. 878-879: \" Nike bei Opferhandlungen\" ; also Brommer 1977, 213-214 note 9 . 107 FR I, text p. 84 f. 108 Beazley, in : Scritti Libertini (1958) 91-95. 109 The vessel on the Munich stamnos is a bronze laver on three short feet, of the type that people might use as a nooavln'ti]p: see Ginouves 1962, 61-75. On the Louvre stamnos it is a simple pottery basin, exactly like the one used for watering bulls on the Attic red figure krater Bologna 299: Oakley 1990, 40, 77 nr. 62 bis, pI. 43-46.

One of the silliest is the story of how Herakles came to Egypt and was taken away by the Egyptians to be sacrificed to Zeus, with all due pomp and the sacrificial wreath upon his head; and how he quietly submitted until the moment came for the beginning of the actual ceremony at the altar, when he exerted his strength and killed them all. For me at least such a tale is proof enough that the Greeks know nothing whatever about Egyptian character and custom.\" That is what Herodotos thinks of the Bousiris episode. III Well, silly or not, let us look at a slightly fuller version of the story, as given by Apollodoros: \"After Libya he (Herakles) traversed Egypt. That country was then ruled by Bousiris, a son of Poseidon by Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphos. This Bousiris used to sacrifice strangers on an altar of Zeus in accordance with a certain oracle. For Egypt was visited with dearth for nine years, and Phrasios, a learned seer who had come from Cyprus, said that the dearth would cease if they slaughtered a stranger man in honour of Zeus every year. Bousiris began by slaughtering the seer himself and continued to slaughter the strangers who landed. So Herakles also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Bousiris and his son Amphidamas. \" 1 12 The Bousiris story enjoyed a modest popularity in Greek vase painting: we have some thirty-odd vases depicting this episode, ranging from the middle of the sixth down to the fourth century B. C . 113 And precisely because of the fact that Greek vase painters, as Herodotos so haughtily remarks, knew nothing whatever about Egyptian customs, they are an interesting source of information for Greek sacrificial ritual, and particu-110 Thus Burkert 1972, 11.

PRE-KILL 47 larly utensils. The Egyptians are given a conventionally barbarian physi-ognomy. The material details, in which some of the pictures. of.the .Bou-siris story are uncommonly rich, are drawn from Greek sacnficlal ntual. On an Attic red figure pelike of the middle of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 48, V355: Paris CM 393], an Egyptian leads Herakles ~o sacrifice by ropes tied to both anns and one leg. The hero, famous for hls strength, is treated as a large, bovine animal. Herakles has arrived at the altar on an Apulian dinos of a good century later [V363: New York 1984.11.7]. Two Egyptians hold him by ropes tied to his legs. Facing Herakles, on the other side of the altar, stands Bousiris holding a knife (machaira). All round the vase, the preparations for the sacrifice are in full swing. Approaching the altar from the right are a young man carrying on his shoulder a three-legged chopping block in the edge of which two cleavers are set, another youth carrying on his head a very wide flat basket and in his right hand a long-handled fan (?), and a third one who carries a kind of trough on his shoulder filled with cakes (?), and a jug in his left hand. On the left, behind the two Egyptians restraining Herakles, a youth empties an amphora into a large kettle under which a fire has been kindled. It is the type of kettle (Lebes) in which part of the sacrificial meat would be boiled. Another youth brings a second amphora. It is clear from this vase painting, and from others we shall look at that the intended sacrifice of Herakles was thought of as the type of sa~rificial feast that would end in a splendid meal for all participants. Most vase painters select a later moment in the story, when Herakles has broken loose and is attacking the Egyptians, who try to get away, dropping the sacrificial paraphernalia left and right. Some of the richest collections of utensils deserve a closer look. In the early Classical period the Pan Painter, who can always be relied upon to make something interesting of scenes of myth and ritual, deco-rated a pelike with the Bousiris theme [Fig. 49: V341: Athens NM 9683]. The scene goes round the vase, and the room underneath the handles is cleverly used for some of the sacrificial utensils: under one there is a metal basin (very close in shape to the cMrnips-vesselsl14 we encountered earlier), which was dropped by an Egyptian whom Herakles holds upside down by the legs. Another Egyptian, facing Herakles at the other side of the blood-stained altar, swings a mallet, such as might be used to stun a sacrificial ox. Under the other handle the large kanoun has fallen on the 114 Fuhrmann's interpretation of it as a sphageion, OJh 39 (1952) 29, is less likely."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"I I 48 CHAPTER TWO ground, dropped by the third Egyptian, who is cowering beside the altar; it has toppled over and the sacrificial knife (machaira) has fallen out. In an indirect way this confirms that the machaira was carried in the kanonn, as we have read in Aristophanes.115 Three Egyptians on the reverse of the vase carry a knife case containing several knives, a table and a bundle of spits, and a hydria. That kanonn and machaira belong together is expressed in a different manner on some other Bousiris vases. A stamnos of roughly the same date as the Pan Painter's pelike has one of Bousiris' servants holding the basket in one hand, and the knife, which he apparently has taken out of it, in the other [V344: Bologna 174]. On two early versions of the myth, on a black figure amphora of c. 540 B.C. [V340: Cincinnati 1959.1] and a red figure kylix of the end of the sixth century [Fig. 50, V350: London E 38], he has dropped the kanonn, which now lies on the ground at his feet (upside down, in the case of the Cincinnati amphora), and has only kept the knife, which may come in handy as a defensive weapon. Conversely, on an early Classical stamnos [Fig. 51, V353: Oxford 521], the Egyptian still holds on to the kanonn, but he has dropped the knife, which stands on end in front of the blood-stained altar. In this picture, there is also a peculiar rounded wide-mouthed jug, which seems to be falling to the ground underneath the kanonn; it might be an alterna-tive form of vessel to contain the chernips, but it is more likely that it served as an oinochoe. 116 The familiar figure of the attendant holding the kanonn in his left hand and the chernips in his right hand occurs on the neck of a volute-krater of the same period [Fig. 52, V348: Ferrara T 579 VT]. The kanonn here has sprigs projecting from its three handles; the cheroips-vessel is a rather wide bowl. This picture is framed on the left by a three-legged chopping block, similar to the one we saw on the Apulian dinos in New York. 117 A knife case is dropped by one of the fleeing Egyptians on the right. The scene here, as on the kylix [V350: London E 38], is further enlivened by two musicians, a kithara-player and a pipe-player. 118 115 Aristophanes, Pax 948, see note 61; see also note 66. 116 On an Attic red figure \" Panathenaic\" amphora, 475/450 B.C. (Saint Petersburg 2227, ARV\" 604/52), a youth carries a similar jug and a kantharos. 117 On chopping blocks, see Chamay, Genava N.S. 24 (1976) 281-290. 118 Musicians are also present on [V347: Ferrara T 499 VT; V349: Leipsic T 651; V359: Rome VG 57912]. PRE-KILL 49 Finally, a red figure kylix of the first quarter of the fifth century [Fig. 53, V347: Ferrara T 499 VT] is very rich in ritual requisites. The inside tondo has a running Egyptian, holding a hydria and a capacious basin. It may be a large skyphos, or a chernips-vessel, but, on the other hand, it might also have been intended for watering the victim, as on an approxi-mately contemporary stamnos mentioned in the previous section [V135: Paris Louvre C 10.754]. In the background there is a bundle of spits, and two similar bundles are depicted on the outside. The picture on the outside goes round the cup. Underneath one handle is an altar with a short-legged bronze basin (podanipter) in front of it. A wide basin under the other handle is probably the sphagefon, used to catch the blood of the victim. Furthermore there are a machaira and a knife case, two hydriai and a broken pot of a different shape, and an unidentified object that may be a very large flat basket. 119 If we survey the rich spread of equipment depicted on the Bousiris vases, it strikes us that we do not only frod the things that are needed for the preliminary ritual, such as kanonn and chernips, but frequently also various utensils that will be used after the killing of the victim, for cutting up the carcass and preparing the sacrificial banquet. 120 Outside the Bou-siris iconography, vase painters usually are much more economical in this respect, and only include those instruments that are used in the particular phase of the ritual that is depicted. 119 A similar basket, if that is what it is, is depicted on [V224: Florence 5 B 2]. Large flat baskets, carried on the head, are more typical of South Italian vase painting, see e.g. de Apulian dinos in New York mentioned above. Compare also the very large flat kanofin, carried by two youths, on an Attic red figure amphora of Panathenaic shape, 450/425 B.C.

Some special groups In this section some representations with sacrificial animals are lumped together which can not be easily assigned to a particular sub-phase of the pre-kill ritual, and some doubtful ones. Lampadedromia The Athenians held torch races on several occasions: at the Panathenaia, and at festivals in honour of Hephaistos, Prometheus, Pan, Themis, and somewhat exceptional ones, on horseback, for Bendis. 121 In vase paintings torch racers are easily recognized by their special torches with hand-shields and by their spiked headdress. Essentially torch races were the transference of fire from one altar to another, and indeed some vases show that the race ended with the kindling of an altar. 122 The contest was again a tribal one. From an inscription of the first half of the fourth century B. C., listing prizes at the Panathenaia, we gather that at that festival the phyle which was victorious at the lampadedromia received a bull, while the individual winner was given a hydria.123 One vase painting shows a hydria standing next to the altar where the winning torch racer arrives. 124 On eight vases, all from the last quarter of the fifth and the first quarter of the fourth century B.C., when the 121 Jiithner, RE s .v. \"Lampadedromia\"; Deubner 1932, 211 ff. ; Schoppa, AA 1935, 33 ff. ; Corbett, Hesperia 18 (1949) 346-351; Metzger 1951,351 ff.; Giglioli, ArchCI3 (1951) 147-162; Idem, ArchCI4 (1952) 94-97; Metzger 1965, 74, 112 f. ; Froning 1971, 78-81; Arias, AntK 17 (1974) 121 ff.; Van Straten, in: Versnel (ed.) 1981, 91; Durand in: Berard et al.

PRE-KILL 51 lampadedromia theme was particularly popular in Attic vase painting, :ve see a restive bull being led to sacrifice by (among others) young men WIth the attributes of torch racers. Sometimes they are assisted by a Nike [V61: Athens NM 1548; V96: Saint Petersburg St 2070; V98: Vienna IV 1050], sometimes by a female figure without wings, probably the personification of the victorious phyle [Fig. 54, V91: New York MMA 56.171.149; also V60: Athens Agora P 10542; V86: Leipsic T 958; V89: Mannheim 123]. 125 These pictures may well refer to torch race victories at the Pan-athenaia, but we can not be certain, since we know nothing of the prizes for such races at other festivals. Dipolieia? The Dipolieia was one of the strangest Athenian festivals.126 The Athe-nians themselves, in the Classical period, looked upon it as something extremely old-fashioned, and perhaps also a bit silly, like outmoded hairpins. 127 Most of our information on procedure comes from Pausanias, and Porphyrios (who probably quotes from Theophrastos' book On pi-ety).128 Some of the main points are as follows. On the day of the festival, in the summer, several bulls were led to the sanctuary of Zeus Polieus on the Akropolis. Sacrificial cakes and dough were placed on a bronze table (or, according to Pausanias, barley corns mixed with wheat on the altar). The bulls were driven round it, and whichever of the animals (first?) ate from it, was killed with an axe by a priest called boutupos (or, according to Pausanias, bouph6nos). The priest fled, and the axe was brought to trial. The hide of the slain bull was stuffed. Four black figure vase paintings, all by the Gela Painter (about 500 B.C. or a little later), are usually connected with this festival [Fig. 55, V33: Munich 1824; also V23: Berlin F 1882; V37: Oxford 514; V46: Thessaloniki 5232].129 All have a broad rectangular altar in the centre. 125 Cf. above 2. 1. 2 : Beautifying th e beast . 126 Burkert 1972, 153-161; Durand 1986, 43 ff. 127 Aristophanes , Nubes 984-5. 12 8 Theophrastos, flEpi Ei)(:rEfJEia~ fr. 16-18 Potscher; Pausanias 124, 4 and 28, 10.

On all four vases, there is a bull on top of this altar, and a varying number on either side of it. Three of the four pictures have an additional bull, painted in white on the black front of the altar. The vase paintings, curious as they certainly are, are remarkably lacking in significant detail. The painter may have had the Dipolieia in mind, but then he is not very clear about it, and the strongest reason to accept the connection is perhaps the absence of a convincing alternative interpretation. It is worth noticing that the sculptor of the Hellenistic calendar frieze, built into the Byzantine church of Hagios Eleutherios in Athens (\"Mikri Mitropoli\"), managed a much clearer reference to the Dipolieia, by making the bouphOnos hold the double axe over a bull. 130 Goats under handles A number of Attic black figure skyphoi by the Theseus Painter (c. 500 B.C.), with more or less religious scenes, have goats under the handles, which are sometimes referred to as sacrificial victims. 131 In one case both obverse and reverse show Herakles and Athena pouring a libation, accom-panied by a pipe-player [V391: Mount Holyoke 1925 BS II 3]. The others have a Dionysiac flavour: a procession of revellers [V3-4: Athens Agora P 1544 and 1547; perhaps V20: Athens NM Per 3725], Dionysos himself seated in a country cart drawn by mules [V57: Private collection], or a satyr and maenad at a column-idol of Dionysos [VlO: Athens NM 498]. The vase painting mentioned last belongs to the series of so-called Leniienvasen, featuring a makeshift image of Dionysos made up of a mask and a robe hung on a column or a tree. 132 Animal sacrifice is not part of Durand 1986, 43 ff. -Deubner 1932, 158 ff. and Haspels, ABL 84, are silent on the connection.

They are never incorporated in an unquestion-ably sacrificial context. And there is, of course, the practical consider-ation, that there is not enough room underneath the handles of skyphoi for full-size human figures. An animal which in a vague way may be con-nected with the main scene would then be an attractive option for the vase painter. 2.2. VOTIVE OFFERINGS Offerings of consumable goods, such as animals and cereals, were fre-quently accompanied by votive offerings of a durable material (wood, clay, metal, stone). 134 In view of the ephemeral nature of the animal and cereal offerings, it was often considered a good idea to include a reference to these in the more lasting ex votos. In its most simple form, such a votive offering might be a replica or depiction of the sacrificed animal or the sacrificial cakes. 135 Alternatively, one might choose a representation of the worshipper bringing these gifts, or, even more elaborate, a more or less complete sacrificial scene. For us sacrificial representations on votive offerings are an important source of information on ancient Greek sacrifice. These votive offerings would be set up in the sanctuaries where the sacrifices depicted on them had been offered, and since they would have to be acceptable to the priests or other authorities in charge of the sanctuaries, and, in a broader sense, to the other worshippers, they would have to present a fairly truthful image of what really happened. To that extent, they may be regarded as 1990,146-150; Frontisi-Ducroux 1991; Halm-Tisserant, Hephaistos 10 (1991) 63-88.

Votive statues and statuettes The numerous votive figurines that represent an animal by itself pose a problem of interpretation. In many cases we have good reason to assume that they are a replica of the sacrificial victim, set up as a memento of the sacrifice. This should be true of the terracotta cocks found in the Asklepi-eia of Athens and Corinth,136 and probably of the marble pigs and other animals from the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in KnidOS.137 A bronze sheep from the Athenian Akropolis is inscribed \"Supplication of Peisis\" , thus closely identifying prayer and sacrifice.138 At first sight, it seems reasonable to interpret all the small bronze sheep, goats and bulls, coming from various sanctuaries all over the Greek world, similarly as mementos of animals sacrificed.139 On closer inspection, however, one gets the uncomfortable feeling that bovine animals are very much overrepresented. This is particularly evident in the case of the Kabeirion near Boiotian Thebes, where it is possible to contrast the enormous herd of bronze bull 136 Hollander 1912, 100 fig. 41; Roebuck, Corinth XIV (1951) 143 nr. 50.

PRE-KILL 55 statuettes from the sanctuary with the bone remains of the actual sacrifices made. 140 Of the identifiable animal bones of the Classical period, roughly 80% are sheep or goat, 15 % cattle, and 5 % pig.141 It might be argued that perhaps only people who could afford the sacrifice of an ox would accom-pany it with the dedication of a bronze statuette, but then again, lead statuettes too are predominantly bulls. It is probably more realistic to assume that many of the animal figurines were dedicated, not as a me-mento of a sacrificed animal, but as a means to place one's livestock under the care and protection of the god. Alternatively, the bulls from the Kabeirion may be taken to refer, not to the dedicator and his livestock, but to the Dionysiac character of the deity. 142 A comparable ambiguity is present in the votive statues and statuettes of men carrying animals. The approximately life size marble statue of Rhombos as calf-bearer (c. 575/550 B.C.), found on the Athenian Akro-polis, is usually, and probably rightly, taken as a depiction of the worship-per devoutly bringing his sacrificial animal to the sanctuary. 143 So is the twice life size ram-bearer from Thasos (c. 600 B.C.).144 From Arcadian sanctuaries we have a number of charming bronze statuettes, mostly late Archaic, which, on a very much smaller scale, show the same theme of a man carrying an animal. 145 Usually it is a lamb or young sheep, in one 140 Schmaltz 1980; Schachter 1986, 66-110. 141 See Jameson, in: Whittaker 1988, 90.

In one case, a dedication of a certain Aineas to Pan according to the inscription, the shepherd carries a mug or leather pail in both hands (presumably containing milk), in addition to the lamb comfortably tucked under his left arm. 146 Shepherds bringing offerings to the deity protecting their flocks, is what these statuettes would seem to represent. But in some of the statuettes the bearer of the animal is characterized by his attributes as Hermes, the protecting deity himself, depicted as a shepherd.147 It is therefore conceivable that the shepherds carrying animals were not neces-sarily all meant as bringing those animals for sacrifice. Some might also have been intended just as a depiction of the dedicator himself at his daily work which is a suitable form for an aparche taken from the yield of that work: 148 That interpretation would also better fit the small bronze figurine of a shepherd milking. 149 Terracotta figurines of women carrying a small sucking-pig were especially popular in sanctuaries of Sicily, though not restricted to that region. 150 Several were found, for instance, in the Heraion (?) at Tiryns, 151 (1945-46) 249 ff.

The pinax has been dated to c. 540/520 B.C., which is later than the vase paintings which show very similar kanephOroi (see above). Still, it is probably correct to take the Pits a pinax as one accidental survivor of a whole series of similar pinakes, starting much earlier, and to take the vase paintings with sacrifi-cial scenes as imitating votive pictures, rather than the other way round. Terracotta votive plaques are not as vulnerable to the Greek climate, and indeed many have survived.157 They may have either a painted representation, or a relief (usually produced with a mould). The relief representations are often painted as well. The terracotta votive pinakes that have come down to us, are remarkably poor in sacrificial scenes. A relief plaque from Olynthos, dated to c. 400 B. C ., has an interesting one. 158 It shows, on the left, a herm in frontal view, with a kerykeion on its shaft. On the right is a man, also in near frontal view, leading a sheep with his right hand and holding a kanoUn in his left hand. There is another kerykeion on the far right, and two skulls are hung above: one perhaps a goat's skull; the other, certainly bovine, is adorned with fillets. The pinax is of modest dimensions (height 17 cm), and has two suspension holes in the top centre. In view of its fmd-spot, it may well refer to domestic cult, which the herm would be compatible with. 2.2.3. Votive reliefs in stone Votive reliefs in stone (mostly marble) form the largest single class of material with sacrificial representations. It should be noted, however, that among the whole class of votive reliefs, the ones with depictions of sacrifice, to be studied in this section, are only a minority. There are some Archaic Greek votive reliefs, but by far the most date from the Classical period, and, as far as we can tell (for in too many cases we do not know the exact provenance), many come from Attika. The rich flow of votive reliefs produced in Athens from the later fifth through the fourth century dries up almost entirely around 300 B.C. Why this should have happened is not quite clear. It is not part of a general decline in votive offerings: in the Athenian Asklepieion, where the once plentiful 157 See Van Straten, in : Le sanctuaire grec (Entretiens Hardt 37, 1992) 250-252. 158 Thessalonike VII 374: Robinson, Olynthus VII (1933) 94 nr. 374, pI. 47. PRE-KILL 59 votive reliefs are no longer found after c. 300, other types of ex-votos are still recorded in impressive numbers in the inventories of the sanctuary. 159 There may be a connection between the discontinuation of the production of votive reliefs, and the prohibition of grave reliefs by Demetrios of Phaleron in 317/6 or shortly afterwards.160 We might imagine votive reliefs to have been produced as a sort of sideline by workshops whose main income depended on the sale of grave reliefs. When these were no longer in demand, the bottom fell out of their business and then within one generation Attic votive reliefs practically came to an end as well. 16 1 Here-after in Greece proper votive reliefs are deplorably thin on the ground. A votive relief from the sanctuary of Artemis in Brauron, admittedly above average in quality, may serve to introduce the most common components of such a relief in the Classical period [Fig. 57, R73: Brauron 1151]. It is of the usual rectangular shape, wider than high and wide enough to accommodate all the figures, divine and human, that the dedica-tor wanted represented. According to the inscription on the architrave, the relief was set up in accordance with a prayer by Aristonike, wife of Antiphates from the deme Thorai. The goddess, Artemis, stands on the right. She is easily identifiable by the bow she holds in her left hand, and the deer at her side. In front of the goddess is an altar, and on the other side of it, facing the goddess, are the worshippers. In this instance, Aristonike has brought an extensive family, including children of various ages. In front of the family procession there is a bovine sacrificial victim, restrained at the altar by a servant who holds the kanoun in his left hand. In the rear a maid is carrying a cylindrical basket on her head. The goddess is much taller than her worshippers, but all figures are standing on the same level, close together, sharing one architecturally framed space. Votive reliefs may have a simpler frame or none at all, but in the fourth century they often have such an architectural frame consisting of a bottom ledge, two antae, and an architrave topped by something like the lateral edge of a tiled roof (the antae seem to occur from c. 420 B. C ., the complete architectural frame somewhat later). This conventional frame has 159 Aleshire 1989. 160 Johansen, 1951, 13; Eckstein, JdI73 (1958) 18-29.

In Aristonike's relief, the deity is on the right and the worshippers are on the left. There is no hard and fast rule about this, and the worshippers may just as well be on the right and the deity on the left. Normally the deity is appreciably taller than the human worshippers. Most of the worshippers have their right hand raised in adoration. The male attendant, holding the kanoun and leading or driving the victim, is already familiar from vase paintings. The female kanephoros, carrying the kanoun on her head and heading a festive procession, does not occur on Classical votive reliefs. 163 This no doubt is due to the fact that these votive reliefs are on the whole private dedications, commemo-rating private sacrifices, not public festivals. Another difference from vase paintings, however, is less easily explained. In votive reliefs the male servant with the kanoun never holds the cMrnips (with one possible exception, to be discussed later on). When the worshippers are pictured as on their way to or arriving at the sanctuary, the time of the chernips has not yet arrived, and its absence need not surprise us. But we shall see that several votive reliefs depict the preliminary rites at the altar (things are taken from the kanoUn and put on the altar), and in that context we would expect the cMrnips to be present, on the strength of what we have seen in the vase paintings. On the other hand, the female attendant with the cylindrical basket on her head, who brings up the rear of the group of worshippers, we have not encountered in vase paintings. On votive reliefs she occurs regularly. The basket, which can sometimes be seen to be covered with a cloth and in other instances may be assumed to have a slip-on lid, is a kiste. 164 Its use is well illustrated in a passage from Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae, where a slave girl who accompanies her mistress to a religious ceremony is addressed as follows: \"Thratta, take the kiste down (from your head), and then take out the sacrificial cake; give it to me so that I may sacrifice 162 Neumann 1979, 51. 163 There is one exception, from 01bia [R114: Olbia]. 164 Amyx, Hesperia 27 (1958) 268-271.

From a fourth century inscription from the Askiepieion in Epidauros it follows that there was a choice: people could either bring the necessary things from home, or buy them at a fixed price in the sanctuary. 166 The kiste was not in itself a ritual implement; it could also be put to a more profane use. The same word kiste was also used for a different type of basket, of an approximately hemispherical shape and with strings attached to it by which it could be carried or suspended.

PRE-KILL 63 AskZepios V oti ve reliefs to Asklepios are more numerous than those of any other deity. 168 Of these many come from the Athenian Asklepieion. Since most of the more common variants are present among the Asklepios reliefs, it seems practical to begin with these. Epidauros169 The most famous Asklepieion at Epidauros has yielded very few votive reliefs, and only one with a depiction of sacrifice. The relief in question was at an art dealer's in Amsterdam in 1925 [Fig. 58, R33: Art market], and its provenance can be established beyond doubt because it is clearly identical with the one seen in Epidauros by Le Bas in the eighteen-forties.170 It shows Asklepios with snake-entwined staff, and Hygieia, standing to the right of and partly behind an altar. On the left is a family consisting of man, woman and child. The woman has drawn a slip of her himation over the back of her head. Women do this quite often on votive reliefs, but it is by no means a general phenomenon; clearly there was no rule prescribing that women should visit a sanctuary only capite veLato. Behind the couple is a maid carrying a substantial kiste. In front of the man, between him and the altar, there is very little room left for the servant with the victim, so he is rather pushed into the background, but the head of the sacrificial pig protrudes from behind the man's legs on the near side of the altar, and the kanoun is held in full view above it. Athens and Piraeus The Asklepieion of Athens, on the south slope of the Akropolis, was founded in 420/419 B.C. According to the inscription on the monument of the founder, Telemachos of Achamai, Asklepios came to Athens from Piraeus, so the Piraeus sanctuary must have preceded the Athenian one. 171 168 Hausmann 1948, 164 ff., has a list of more than 200 reliefs (including reliefs of some other healing deities). 169 Burford 1969; Tomlinson 1983. 170 Le Bas, mono fig. 104. 171 Asklepieion Athens: Travlos 1971, 127-142; Martin & Metzger 1976, 81-84; Aleshire 1989; Aleshire 1991. -Telemachos' monument: Beschi, ASAtene 45-46 (1967-68) 381-436; Idem, AAA 15 (1982) 31-43. -Asklepieion Piraeus: Travlos 1988,340-363; Garland 1987, 115-117.

C., measures c. 80 cm in height, and its original width (the left part is missing) may be estimated at c. 140 cm [Fig. 59, R8: Athens NM 1333]. Of the gods, on the left, the seated Asklepios is only partly preserved; Hygieia stands next to him, leaning against a tree trunk with her left hand. At the foot of the tree is an altar, and to the right of it a family of worshippers consisting of a man, a woman (slip of her himation drawn over the back of her head), a girl, another man and a small child. On the far right is the maid carrying a large kiste covered with a cloth. On the left, preceding the couple, is the male servant with the sacrificial sheep at the altar. On the altar the fire, and probably the firewood, has been rendered in relief: it is a somewhat amorphous heap, to which some clarifying details may have been added in paint. 172 The servant leading the victim usually holds the kanoun in his free hand (in many cases, if the relief is not too damaged, the three projecting handles of the kanoUn are clearly indicated). Here, however, he holds a distinctly different vessel in his left hand: it is a hemispherical bowl. It is just possible that the chernips is meant, though that is not normally depicted on votive reliefs. If one were to continue in this slightly overinterpretative vein for a moment, one might even see in the strong forward movement of victim and attendant along the near side of the altar, as indicated by their attitude, a reference to the ritual walking round the altar. On a fragmentary relief [Fig. 60, R217: Athens NM 1436], this walking round the altar is perhaps more convincingly suggested by the energetic gesture of the attendant's right arm, and by the fact that the altar and the sheep are set at an angle to the background. As far as size goes, a relief from Piraeus with a height of 24 cm and a width of 30 cm is near the other end of the range [Fig. 61, R27: Athens NM 1407], though there are yet smaller marble votive reliefs. Apparently the workshops catered for people of all sorts of means. In the small compass of the relief all essential elements are present. On the right of the altar Asklepios stands, leaning on his staff. He is accompanied by an enormous snake. Asklepios is often represented with snakes; snakes lived in his sanctuaries and sometimes took an active part in the healing of the Athens is scanty, for the Piraeus it is virtually non-existent. 172 For painting on votive reliefs see Karusu, in: Stud. P. H. von BLanckenhagen (1979) 111-116; and more generally: Reutersward 1960. PRE-KILL 65 patients who spent the night there. 173 Normally, however, they are de-picted on a more realistic scale. A snake of the size shown in this relief can only have existed in the imagination, or dreams, of a devout worship-per. In the slave Karion's report of the incubation of Ploutos in the Piraeus Asklepieion, as given in Aristophanes' comedy, Asklepios is followed by two huge snakes. 174 The family of worshippers in our relief comprises three adults, a woman between two men, and a female child. There is no maid with kiste. The sacrificial victim is a sheep led by a small servant with kanoun. We should not take the size of this attendant as an indication of his age. In this case he is about half the size of the adult man (and we shall come to other instances where he is much smaller yet), which would make him far too young to handle a sheep with any confidence. His small size is only indicative of his lack of importance. He is only there as an inevitable extension of the things that are essential to the sacrifice: the animal and the sacrificial implement. On a votive relief from the Asklepieion in Athens, we have a different sacrificial animal: a pig [Fig. 62, R6: Athens NM 1330]. It is led by the familiar figure of the attendant (in loin-cloth) holding the kanoun, and they stand on the near side of an altar which is vaguely visible in the back-ground. The relief is broken on the right and consequently of the worship-pers only a man and one arm of a second figure remain. On the left Asklepios is seated on a throne, with a snake coiled underneath, and Hygieia stands at his side, leaning against a votive disk set on a tall pillar. Such pillars supporting votive offerings were a common sight in sanctuar-ies, and they are not infrequently depicted on votive reliefs, as a sort of general indication of the sacred surroundings. 175 A very similar group of a seated Asklepios with Hygieia leaning against a votive disk on a pillar recurs on a relief in the Louvre [Fig. 63, R23: Paris Louvre 755]. It is reported to have come from Athens, so it probably once stood in the Athenian Asklepieion. It is unusually well 173 Kiister 1913, 133 ff.; Herzog 1931, 86 ff.

At the rather large altar the preparations for the sacrifice have advanced a little further than in the previous reliefs. A bearded man puts something on the altar, which he must have taken from the kanoiin pre-sented to him by a naked youth standing beside him. It is impossible to see what it is he places on the altar, but from what we have learned so far we may assume that it is a handful of barley corns (olaf). On the far side of the altar stands a second attendant, in an exomzs (tunic leaving one shoul-der bare), holding the bovine victim. Further to the right are there two women, paying more attention to the child standing in front of them than to the sacrifice, and a third woman or maid carrying a baby on her arm. On another relief from the Athenian sanctuary, we again see the sacrificer in the act of putting something onto the altar [Fig. 64, R9: Athens NM 1334]. The victim in this case is a pig, led by a servant in exomis. Since an animal of this smaller size would become invisible if it were placed on the far side of the altar, like the bull in the previous relief, it is here put in the foreground, on the near side of the other worshippers. Asklepios and Hygieia are both standing, Asklepios leaning on the snake-entwined staff which was to become the emblem of his art in centuries to come. The family of worshippers here only comprises the man at the altar and two children (probably girls). From the few reliefs we have seen so far, it has already become clear that, although these reliefs are composed of a limited number of more or less fixed elements, there is a remarkable variation in details. The group of deities is varied in its composition and in the rendering of its individual members. But even more striking is the variety in the composition of the worshipping families. This last observation in particular proves beyond reasonable doubt that these votive reliefs were made to order, not bought from stock. An extensive family is represented on a votive relief from Piraeus, probably from the Asklepieion there [Fig. 65, R28: Athens NM 1429]. The left half, on which the gods must have been depicted, is missing. As in the Louvre relief, an attendant holding the bovine victim stands in the background, on the far side of the altar. On the right is a bearded man putting something on the altar; he is accompanied by a woman. They are followed by three couples of a man and a girl, and two men each with a woman at his side. This large group makes the relief very crowded: the last couple on the extreme right overlaps the right anta. As a result the maid carrying the kiste had to be shoved into the background, where she is almost totally obscured by the worshippers, except for the large kiste PRE-KILL 67 itself, which is prominently displayed above their heads. The kiste, containing part of the offerings, was considered indispensable; the maid was not. The next relief was found in Kynouria in the eastern part of the Peloponnesos, on the site of the estate of Herodes Atticus [Fig. 66, R19: Athens NM 1402]. It is clearly Attic, and may be dated to the second quarter of the fourth century B. C. In all likelihood Herodes had this relief, and some other ones, brought to his estate from the Athenian Asklepi-eion. 176 This is again a very crowded relief, for now Asklepios also has brought his family. In addition to the god himself we have a goddess (probably Hygieia), Asklepios' two sons Machaon and Podaleirios, and his three daughters Iaso, Akeso and Panakeia. Together they take up two thirds of the relief on the right. The family of worshippers, on the left, consists of two men, one woman and two children. The head of the sacrificial pig can be seen protruding from behind the legs of the foremost worshipper, but no room could be found for a attendant leading it, or for the altar. The kiste is seen in the top left comer, but the maid carrying it is again as good as invisible behind the worshippers. There is, however, in this case an additional female servant, on the far left overlapping the anta. She can be identified as a slave girl by her hair style, dress, and the box she holds in her hands. On Classical grave reliefs women are often accompanied by similar handmaidens (e .g. on the well known Hegeso stele177) . There as here their primary purpose probably is to serve as status indicator. One peculiar votive relief from the Asklepieion in Athens has a unique shape [Fig. 67, R18: Athens NM 1377]. The monument, which was carved out of a single block of marble, consists of a relief depicting the usual procession of worshippers in an architectural frame (four couples, two with a child each, male servant with kanoUn and pig, maid with kiste), and, attached to it at right angles on the left, a higher naiskos containing the deities (Epione seated on a chair with a goose underneath, 178 Asklepios and Hygieia standing). It seems that the sculptor has taken the conven-tional architectural frame and developed it into a more lifelike rendering of the architecture of the Asklepieion. On the short sides of the relief, he 176 See Karusu, RM 76 (1969) 263 f. ; Faklares 1990, 96-104 and 192-193. 177 Athens NM 3624: Conze nr. 68, pI. 30; Diepolder 1931, 27, pI. 20; Johansen 1951,19 fig. 5. 178 The goose of Epione: Svoronos p. 296 f."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"68 CHAPTER TWO carved a Hekateion (on the left) and a herm (on the right), indicating, as it were, the boundaries of the sanctuary. 179 In a special class of votive reliefs, typical of healing deities, the patient is represented sleeping in the enkoimeterion and being visited by the god.180 In one instance this motif is combined with that of the grateful 179 See above 2 . 1.1: Sacrifices at herms. 180 Hausmann 1948, ch.

PRE-KILL 69 family bringing the sacrificial animal [Fig. 68, R30: lost, once Piraeus]. The relief in question once was in private possession in Piraeus, and therefore is assumed to come from the Asklepieion there. It has disap-peared since, and all we have now is a rather sketchy drawing. The patient lies on a couch, with his head to the right. Two women are attending to him: the one on the left is small, probably human, the one on the right at the head of the couch is tall and may be one of Asklepios' daughters. A basin stands on the floor in front of the couch. The god himself stands at the foot of the couch, supervising the treatment. On the left are four worshippers, and a servant leading the sacrificial pig. We may compare this relief with one in Cassel, presumably from the Asklepieion in Athens [R22: Cassel 75].181 Here the patient was lying on a couch in the left part of the relief, with his head to the right. Most of him is missing now, except part of his head supported by a pillow. Askle-pios is seated at the head of the couch, turned towards the patient and apparently treating him. Behind Asklepios, on the right, are the worship-pers: a couple and two children. They are accompanied by a maid carry-ing a kiste. There is, however, no sacrificial animal. It might be supposed that it was left out for lack of space, but that does not seem very probable. If an animal was sacrificed, it was considered an important element, and we have seen that even in crowded reliefs the sculptor would always find a way of showing the victim's snout peepmg out from between the wor-shippers legs. Moreover, there are other reliefs where the worshippers are followed by the maid with kiste, but do not bring a sacrificial animal (e.g. [Fig. 69, R35: Berlin 685]). If we remember that the kiste contained sacrificial cakes, it follows that such reliefs probably refer to occasions on which the god had only been presented with bloodless offerings. We have no reason to assume, that in the Attic Asklepieia of the Classical period animal sacrifice was a sine qua non for a patient seeking to be healed or having been cured in the enkoimeterion. In Aristophanes' Plutus, only cakes are mentioned in this context. 182 And the prothumata listed in a 43.

It is a relief of good quality and fair size (height 57 cm). Asklepios is seated on the right; Hygieia stands beside him leaning against a tree, with a snake coiled round it, which marks the middle of the scene. At the foot of the tree, in front of the deities, where we would normally expect the altar, is a table: the hiera trapeza.184 At the table stand two men, one of whom is taking something from a kanoun presented to him by an attendant, probably some more of the cakes of various shapes with which the table is already overloaded. The names of the two men are inscribed on the architrave above them. One of them, Mnesimachos from Acharnai, is known to have been, together with his father, victorious choreg6s for the tribe Oineis c. 350 B.C. 185 The monument of Telemachos of Acharnai, the founder of the Athe-nian Asklepieion, is not in the strict sense a votive relief, but it is a unique document of the foundation of the sanctuary, both in reliefs and inscrip-tion. It must have been set up in the Asklepieion shortly before or after 400 B.C., and simultaneously or slightly later a replica was made and set up in the same sanctuary. The monument has been painstakingly recon-structed from its disiecta membra by Luigi Beschi.186 It was formed of a pillar supporting a two-sided relief (amphiglyphon). The pillar bore the inscription with the record of the sanctuary's foundation and its first years,187 and at its top it was decorated with relief panels on its four sides. On one of these panels, though badly damaged, we can still recognize the typical motif of the hero banquet. The hero on the couch is more precisely determined by the presence of a lyre and a theatrical mask. Beschi's 183 LS 2l. 184 Another table with cakes, only partly preserved: [RI2: Athens NM 1346]. Some reliefs where a worshipper is seen putting something on the altar, but lacking a sacrifi-cial animal, may also refer to cake-offerings: e.g. [RI4: Athens NM 1368; R16: Athens NM 1372]. 185 Inscription: NtlciCt.~ I 'Oij9£v, MVT\\(Jil1Ct.Xo~ I ·AXCt.pvd)~.

PRE-KILL 71 identification of this figure as the heroized Sophokles-Dexion is convinc-ing.188 The two sides of the amphiglyphon, mounted on this pillar, show the interior and the exterior of the newly founded sanctuary. On the side with the exterior there is also, on the right, an indication of the Asklepieion in Piraeus, whence Asklepios had come to Athens. The nature of this Piraeus sanctuary is suggested, among other things, by a small representation of a votive relief on a pillar, and enough of this miniature votive relief remains for us to recognize the theme. It is an incubation scene: a patient lying on a couch in the enkoimeterion is visited by the healing god. There is also a dog at the foot of the pillar, and some waves and part of a ship indicating the sea. The relief on the other side shows a single male wor-shipper on the left (Telemachos himself, no doubt), and on the right the interior of the newly founded temple. Inside the temple Asklepios stands on the right and Hygieia is seated on the left, on a hiera trapeza, under-neath which lies a dog similar to the one depicted in the Piraeus sanctuary on the other side.189 A couple of surgical instruments hang on the wall between Hygieia and Asklepios. They are a forceps, which may be compared to the KUPKtVOt iU'tptKOt mentioned in an inventory of ex-votos in the Asklepieion in Piraeus,190 and a cupping instrument (crtKtl11). 191 The trapeza on which Hygieia sits is set on a platform decorated with a relief frieze, which has its counterpart on the opposite side of the double-relief, where it depicts a mUltiple sacrifice of three animals: one bovine, one smaller one (possibly a sheep) and one probably a pig. In view of the place where it is depicted, this trfttoia b6archos is best taken as the foundation sacrifice of the Asklepieion. 188 Aleshire 1989, 10 note 4, thinks Beschi's identification weak. But what other hero, connected with the foundation of the Athenian Asklepieion, would have a rightful claim to these attributes? 189 Is it too fanciful to imagine, that one of the dogs, which were strikingly prominent in the Asklepieion of Piraeus (cf. LS 21), in the late summer of 420119 B.C. followed a kindly Athenian visitor home, and was thus instrumental in causing the foundation of the Asklepieion EV iicJ\"t£t? Such a supposition would seem to tally well with the Telemachos inscription, according to which Asklepios first came to the city from Piraeus of his own accord, and only then Telemachos set into motion the usual procedure of consulting an oracle, having a snake brought from the sanctuary at Epidauros, etc. On Asklepios' introduction see also Garland 1992, 116-135. 190 fG If 47. 191 See Berger 1970, 63 ff."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"II I I I 72 CHAPTER TWO Patrai? A fourth century votive relief to Asklepios first turned up in Patrai more than a century ago [Fig. 71, R34: Patrai 208]. It may come from an Asklepieion in Patrai, of which nothing further is known, but the possibil-ity can not be excluded that it had been brought there from somewhere else. On the left Asklepios is depicted with one female deity (probably Hygieia), and his two sons, who stand closest to the large altar in the middle. The family of worshippers coming from the left is headed by a man, who puts something on the altar with his right hand; at his feet is a pig. The man is followed by two women with a slip of their himation drawn over their head, the second one a bit shorter than the first one; there are three children, a small boy and girl, and a taller boy between them. The rear is brought up by the maid carrying the kiste. The reliefs from Epidauros and Patrai display no significant differences from the Attic ones. Other healing gods Amynos On the west slope of the Akropolis of Athens, the healing heros Amynos had his sanctuary. 192 Sophokles is reported to have been priest of Amy-nos,193 whose cult probably was older than the introduction of Asklepios. The site has yielded some anatomical ex votos, the famous relief of Lysi-machides,194 and one fragment of a votive relief with a sacrificial repre-sentation; all that is left are a female and a male worshipper, and a sheep. Amphiaraos From the Amphiareia both at Oropos and at Rhamnous come some inter-esting votive reliefs with sacrificial scenes. 195 192 Travlos 1971,76-78. 193 At least if we accept the emendation ·AI.L'IlV01l instead of \"AA.rovo~ in Vita Sophoclis 11, which we probably should, in view of the strong circumstantial evidence linking Sophokles with Amynos.

They are a man and woman (slip of himation over her head) and a child, followed by a maid carrying the kiste covered with a cloth. At the left, i.e. at the rear of the group, in the foreground walks the male servant with the kanoun, leading two sacrificial animals: a sheep and a pig. The relative position of the animals is pecu-liar; usually they are at the front. The reason for this may have been in the part of the relief that is lost. The combination of the two victims has been seen as a welcome confirmation of Pausanias' description of the procedure at the Amphia-reion of Oropos: \"Everyone who comes to consult Amphiaraos first purifies himself as the rite dictates. Purity comes by sacrificing to the god, and to all the gods whose names are on the altar. When these preparations have been thoroughly finished, they sacrifice a ram and sleep on the fleece, waiting for the revelation of a dream.\" 196 The pig in the relief then would be the purificatory sacrifice, while the sheep or ram would provide the fleece to sleep on in the enkoimeterion. Incubation on an animal skin is indeed attested for the Classical period, not only in the Amphiareion at Oropos, but also in the Amphiareion at Rhamnous and the Asklepieia at Athens and Piraeus. 197 It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that it was the general practice. In fact, most of the incubation reliefs do not show an animal skin spread under the patient. Nor should we think that the sacrifice of a sheep plus a pig was the minimal requirement to be admitted to the Amphiareion at Oropos. A sacred law of the late fifth or early fourth century B.C. is very clear about that: the entrance fee was one drachma (later changed into one and a half drachmae), but one might Amphiareion, near the Hephaisteion, where during the construction of the Piraeus railway part of a votive relief was found (Athens NM 1383: Svoronos 328, pI. 38, 4; Siisserott 1938, pI. 22, 5; Hausmann 1948, 171 nr. 74), together with a honorary decree with a relief representation of Amphiaraos, Artikleides and Hygieia, all three with their names inscribed (Athens NM 1396: Svoronos 347, pI. 50; Hausmann 1948, 168 nr. 20; Meyer 1989, A 143, pI. 42, 2).

Levi. 197 Of the votive reliefs listed above in note 180, the following have the patient lying on an animal skin: (i) and (k) from the Asklepieion in Athens, (0) from the Asklepieion in Piraeus, (r) from the Amphiareion in Oropos, (s) from the Amphiareion in Rhamnous."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"I I I 74 CHAPTER TWO sacrifice whatever one wished.19 8 Practice in . the Classical period appar-ently was much less rigid than Pausanias implies. Rhamnous In a relief from Rhamnous the part where the deities were depicted is again missing [Fig. 73, R39: Athens NM 1384]. What we have is the right part of the relief with the worshippers. In the background, approximately where the middle of the relief must have been, is a pillar supporting a votive plaque. In front of it stands a servant in exomis, rendered in frontal view, who holds a kanoUn from which a bearded man takes something. In the background between these two figures the hind quarters and curly tail of a pig are just visible. The man is followed, on the right, by a woman, three small children, and a maid with kiste. The names of the woman and the three children are inscribed above them on the architrave (the name of the man is missing). 199 Zeus Zeus Meilichios and Zeus Philios in Athens and Piraeus An iconographically closely connected group of Attic votive reliefs shows a seated bearded god, not accompanied by any other deities, who may have one or more of the following attributes: an eagle under his chair, a snake, a cornucopia, a sceptre, a phiale. In the inscribed examples the god is sometimes called Zeus Meilichios, sometimes Zeus Philios, without the two being iconographically distinguishable. 200 A fragmentary example from the north slope of the Hill of the Nymphs in Athens [Fig. 74, R41: Athens EpM 8738] was dedicated by a club of eranistai to Zeus Philios.201 Enough remains to see that the victim was a pig. 198 LS 69, 20-24: E1tCl.plxiJv oE OtOOUV 'tal! l!EAAOV'tCi. 9EpCX1tEUEa9cxt ul1to 'tou 9EQU l!iJ EACX't'tOV EVVE' 0j30AOt<; OOtell!OU ap'YluplOU teCXl El!j3Ct.AAEtV Ei<; 'tOY 9l)acxupov 1tcxpElov'to<; 'tOU VEWteOPOU, Ibid. 30-31: 9uEtv oE E~IElv ii1tCl.v on iiv j3oAll'tCXt €tecxa'to<;. 199 Inscription IG IP 4426: BOlOtOV ·I1t1tOtepCt.'tl)<; EUCt.'Y'Y<E>AO<; AiaxUAo<;. 200 See Van Straten, BABesch 49 ( 1974) 163-164, 178-180. 2 01 Inscription IG If 2935: 'Epcxv< t>a'tcxl ~tl I <l>tAlWt aVEI6£acxv ECP' 'HI'Yl)alOU iipxovl'to<; (i. e. 324/3 B .C ,), PRE-KILL 75 On a relief found in Piraeus, dedicated to Zeus Meilichios, the victim again is a pig [Fig. 75, R44: Piraeus 3]. The god seated on the left holds a cornucopia. The group of worshippers is composed in a charmingly inept way. The servant with the kanoun stands behind the altar, while the pig is in front of it. On the right are a man and woman with three small children. The maid with kiste is squeezed into the background between the man and the woman. Furthermore it may be noted that, though the whole family is present, and the man walks in front, nearest the altar, the in-scription mentions only the woman as dedicant. 202 An uninscribed relief, probably also from Piraeus, has two female worshippers and two children [Fig. 76, R45: Athens NM 1408]. The woman nearest the god is kneeling, stretching out her hands towards his knees, indicating that she has come to him in considerable distress, imploring him with an urgent prayer.203 Since naturally under these circumstances the kneeling woman should be depicted as close as possible to the god, it is understandable that the servant with kanoun and sacrificial sheep is moved to the rear of the group, just in front of the maid with the kiste. The sheep seems a bit unwilling. Kneeling women occur on two more reliefs with Zeus Meilichios or Philios, together with a sacrificial sheep [R48: Athens NM 1433; R50: Dresden 150], both of unknown provenance. Other, mostly incomplete, reliefs depicting a similar Zeus come from Athens ([R42: Athens NM 2383]: sheep; [R43: Athens NM 2390]: bovine animal and two goats?), Eleusis ([R46: Eleusis 5126]: the victim is missing, part of the servant with kanoun remains), and Sikyon ([R49: Sikyon]: sheep). Of a further three or four the provenance is unknown.204 Finally, on another relief of unknown provenance [Fig. 77, R55: Vienna I 1096], the worshippers, a couple with two children, have brought no animal, but there is a maid with kiste, containing bloodless offerings. 2 02 Inscription: [Kptj't0j30Al) ~ti MtAtXlW[t]. 2 03 Van Straten, BABesch 49 (1974) 159-189. 204 [R51: Newcastle-upon-Tyne): sheep; [R54: Vicenza EI-54): sheep; [R53: Verona MM): pig.

Of the seated god at her left little remains, but he is usually supposed to be Zeus Soter, with whom Athena Soteira, whose name is preserved in the inscription on the architrave, is often associated in cult.20S On the right of the altar are a man and a woman bringing two sheep. In the background on the far side of the altar, in front of the man, and rather far from the two victims, is a small figure; perhaps in this case a child being presented to the deities, rather than the usual attendant. Zeus Karaios at Thespiai A curious dedication by a group of sussitoi was found in Thespiai [Fig. 78, R57: Thebes 154]. This dinner club dedicated a rectangular pillar to Zeus Karaios, which on the front, above the inscription, is decorated with the relief of a bucranium adorned with fillets. On the left and right side respectively are the mandible and the skull of a boar. These remains of sacrifices must have been a pleasant memento of the sacrificial banquets they enjoyed, and at the same time they may contain an allusion to Zeus' epithet in this sanctuary. 206 Athena2 07 As we saw in the previous section, being Zeus, father of men and gods, was no guarantee for receiving a copious supply of votive reliefs. What reliefs he did get, were mostly dedicated to Zeus Meilichios or Philios, not to his Olympian manifestation. And similarly his daughter Athena received remarkably few of the votive reliefs that her city produced in such great numbers in the later Classical period. It is dangerous to draw far reaching conclusions from a single class of material, but it does seem probable that the private religiosity of the Athenian people at that time, of 20S Inscription: [toll LW'tijpt K]Cl.t ·A6a.vCl.t LW'tELpCl.t KAEUIlEVlle; avE611KE.

For the general iconography of Athena: Demargne et al., Athena, LlMC II (1984) 955-1044. PRE-KILL 77 which the private dedications are an expression, was not to any great extent directed at Athena Polias. 208 Athena does have the distinction of being the recipient of the oldest votive relief in the present series [Fig. 79, R58: Athens AkrM 581]. It was found on the Akropolis, and dates from the late Archaic period (c . 500/480 B.C.). Athena herself, wearing a helmet, stands on the left; from the right approach a man and woman with three children: two boys walking in front, and a girl. The sacrificial animal is a large pig, certainly female and probably pregnant. This is the second piece of evidence that pregnant animals were sacrificed to Athena on the Akropolis.209 Next there are two reliefs of the fourth century B.C. Of the first one only the extreme left and right part remain; the middle, where the sacrifi-cial animal may have been, is missing [R59: Athens AkrM 2413 +]. Athena, with helmet, aegis and spear, stands on the right next to an altar. On the left of the altar is the leg of a man in a short chiton or loin-cloth, probably the sacrificial attendant. The left portion of the relief preserves the head of one worshipper, and the maid with kiste. The other relief is a little more interesting [Fig. 80, R60: Athens AkrM 3007]. Athena again stands on the right of the altar. Behind the altar stands the servant holding the kanoun, and on the left a small pig peeks from behind the foot of the altar. The group of worshippers on the left consists of one man standing at the altar, and more men arranged in pair~. The relief is broken on the left, but they can be plausibly restored as four pairs, making up a total of nine men. So in this case it is evidently not a family dedication. Probably the men are a group of magistrates, perhaps the nine archontes. Demeter and Kore The Eleusinian deities enjoyed an ever increasing popularity during the Classical period, both on the level of public cult and as objects of private piety. We have evidence for a considerable number of votive reliefs dedicated to Demeter and Kore in the course of the later fifth and fourth centuries.210 Many of these, unfortunately, are very fragmentary, and only a few have representations of sacrifice. 208 See also Nilsson 1967, 729 ff. 209 See the vase painting [V67: Athens NM Akr 636], above p. 26. 2 10 Peschlow-Bindokat, Jdl87 (1972) 60-157. See also Beschi, Demeter, LlMC IV (1988) 844-892."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"78 CHAPTER TWO A well preserved example, dating from the second half of the fourth century, comes from Eleusis [Fig. 81, R67: Paris Louvre 752]. On the right stand Demeter, holding a sceptre and a phiale, and Kore, holding two long torches in one hand and ears of com in the other. On the left, on the other side of the altar, are a man and a woman (head covered by a slip of the himation) making the usual gesture of worship. In front of the altar a small servant in exomis leads the sacrificial pig and holds the kanoun. Of a relief in Athens the exact provenance is not known, but it is assumed to be from an Attic sanctuary [Fig. 82, R68: Athens NM 1016]. Demeter, seated here, and Kore, holding one torch in each hand, are on the left of the altar. The servant with kanoun and sacrificial pig is on the near side of it, and the family approaches from the right. They are a couple with four small children, followed by the maid carrying the kiste. Rather exceptionally the woman on this relief walks in front of the man. This, combined with the number of children that are present, suggests that this relief may have been dedicated to the goddesses for their patronage of motherhood and child care. 211 A fragmentary votive relief found at Eleusis may have to do with the Eleusinian mysteries [Fig. 83, R65: Eleusis mag.]. A lot of it is missing, which makes its interpretation problematic. Of a goddess on the right only the raised right hand, which held a sceptre, remains. Parts of five figures approaching her from the left are preserved. The two men in front are appreciably smaller than the numbers three and four (of the fifth only a small piece of drapery remains), but the only one of these smaller men whose head is more or less preserved is clearly bearded, so they can not be children. The taller third and fourth figures, both male, were probably not quite as tall as the goddess. Number three (and probably also number four) carries a small sucking-pig by one hind leg. It looks as though the conventional difference in size between gods and worshippers on votive reliefs is here expanded into a three tier system. If we take the piglets as chofroi mustikai, i.e. the victims that the initiates had to bring and that were slaughtered in the course of the initiation,212 then the two men 211 Cf. Aristophanes, Thesmophoriazusae 295 ff. A small Attic votive relief with a representation of some sacrificial cakes is dedicated \" to the two goddesses on behalf of the child\": Athens EpM 8790, Svoronos 668, pI. 219; Mobius, AM 49 (1924) 13; IG IP 4588: [<l»tA.ll 'to-tV 6wtv I [E)i>1;O-Il£vll i>1tEP I 'tOU 1tO-tOtOl). 212 Cf. Aristophanes , A charnenses 747, 764. See Introduction 1.2. PRE-KILL 79 carrying them might perhaps be mythical mystai (Herakles, Dioscuri?), and the two smaller men preceding them Eleusinian priests. 213 Another relief from Eleusis has a reference to the local myth too [Fig. 84, R64: Eleusis 5006]. The goddess, on the right, is seated on the bare rock, which is probably the agelastos petra on which Demeter sat when she first came to Eleusis.214 The worshippers are three men and a woman, followed by a maid carrying the kiste, but there is no sacrificial animal; apparently only cakes were offered.21S I include here, with some hesitation, a votive relief found in Pompeii [R69: Naples MN 126174]. It is definitely Greek and can be dated to about 400 B.C., but nothing is known of its ultimate provenance. On the right a goddess sits on a bare rock, her sceptre leaning against her shoul-der. At her feet is a low altar. The group of worshippers on the left consists of a youth holding a small tray or kanoun and leading a sheep by the horns. He is followed by three small children, a girl and two boys, one of whom affectionately lays one arm on the victim. Behind them follow a man and two women. The goddess has been variously identified as Aphro-dite or Demeter.216 Her unusual seat is a point in favour of the latter,2I7 and so, to a certain extent, is the male sex of the victim. As a general rule, female deities received female sacrificial animals. There are excep-tions to this rule. Rams were on certain occasions sacrificed to Demeter or Kore.218 I have not found this to be true of Aphrodite (which is not much of an argument, given the fragmentary nature of our evidence). 213 Some such interpretation might find support in a late fifth century votive relief from Kertch, but that is not without its own interpretational problems: Saint Petersburg Pan 160, Peschlow-Bindokat, Jdl87 (1972) 151 R 12, fig. 39; LIMe IV ( 1988) Demeter 270 (good photograph). 214 Apollodoros I 5, 1.

On the left, on the other side of the altar, are a man and a woman (head covered by a slip of the himation) making the usual gesture of worship. In front of the altar a small servant in exomis leads the sacrificial pig and holds the kanoun. Of a relief in Athens the exact provenance is not known, but it is assumed to be from an Attic sanctuary [Fig. 82, R68: Athens NM 1016]. Demeter, seated here, and Kore, holding one torch in each hand, are on the left of the altar. The servant with kanoun and sacrificial pig is on the near side of it, and the family approaches from the right. They are a couple with four small children, followed by the maid carrying the kiste. Rather exceptionally the woman on this relief walks in front of the man. This, combined with the number of children that are present, suggests that this relief may have been dedicated to the goddesses for their patronage of motherhood and child care.211 A fragmentary votive relief found at Eleusis may have to do with the Eleusinian mysteries [Fig. 83, R65: Eleusis mag.]. A lot of it is missing, which makes its interpretation problematic. Of a goddess on the right only the raised right hand, which held a sceptre, remains. Parts of five figures approaching her from the left are preserved. The two men in front are appreciably smaller than the numbers three and four (of the fifth only a small piece of drapery remains), but the only one of these smaller men whose head is more or less preserved is clearly bearded, so they can not be children. The taller third and fourth figures, both male, were probably not quite as tall as the goddess. Number three (and probably also number four) carries a small sucking-pig by one hind leg. It looks as though the conventional difference in size between gods and worshippers on votive reliefs is here expanded into a three tier system. If we take the piglets as chofroi mustikaf, i.e. the victims that the initiates had to bring and that were slaughtered in the course of the initiation,212 then the two men 211 Cf. Aristophanes, Thesmophoriazusae 295 ff.

PRE-KILL 79 carrying them might perhaps be mythical mystai (Herakles, Dioscuri?), and the two smaller men preceding them Eleusinian priests. 213 Another relief from Eleusis has a reference to the local myth too [Fig. 84, R64: Eleusis 5006]. The goddess, on the right, is seated on the bare rock, which is probably the agelastos petra on which Demeter sat when she first came to Eleusis.214 The worshippers are three men and a woman, followed by a maid carrying the kiste, but there is no sacrificial animal; apparently only cakes were offered.21S I include here, with some hesitation, a votive relief found in Pompeii [R69: Naples MN 126174]. It is definitely Greek and can be dated to about 400 B.C ., but nothing is known of its ultimate provenance. On the right a goddess sits on a bare rock, her sceptre leaning against her shoul-der. At her feet is a low altar. The group of worshippers on the left consists of a youth holding a small tray or kanoun and leading a sheep by the horns. He is followed by three small children, a girl and two boys, one of whom affectionately lays one arm on the victim. Behind them follow a man and two women. The goddess has been variously identified as Aphro-dite or Demeter.216 Her unusual seat is a point in favour of the latter,217 and so, to a certain extent, is the male sex of the victim. As a general rule, female deities received female sacrificial animals. There are excep-tions to this rule. Rams were on certain occasions sacrificed to Demeter or Kore.218 I have not found this to be true of Aphrodite (which is not much of an argument, given the fragmentary nature of our evidence). 213 Some such interpretation might find support in a late fifth century votive relief from Kertch, but that is not without its own interpretational problems: Saint Petersburg Pan 160, Peschlow-Bindokat, Jdl 87 (I972) 151 R 12, fig. 39; LIMe IV ( 1988) Demeter 270 (good photograph). 214 Apollodoros I 5, 1.

A well preserved relief of exceptional quality in the Louvre [Fig. 85, R71: Paris Louvre 756] is usually attributed to Demeter.2 19 Its provenance is unknown, and the goddess standing on the right only holds a sceptre and a phiale. These attributes are not distinctive enough to identify her. Behind the cylindrical altar stands a boy, who holds a kanoun filled with doughnut-shaped sacrificial cakes in his left hand, and with his right hand places some of these on the altar. The victim, a small goat, stands ready at the altar. The worshippers on this relief are not a family, but a group of seven boys led by two bearded men. One of the boys holds a wreath. Probably the boys have participated in some game or performance in honour of the goddess, and are now thanking her for the victory. The only clue to the identity of the goddess, and that not a very conclu-sive one, is in the species of the victim. Of the more common sacrificial animals, bovine, sheep, pig and goat, the goat is most clearly preferred by specific deities.220 It is hard to find a sacrifice to Demeter requiring a goat. For Aphrodite and Artemis, there are several. Since, however, Artemis is usually identified by at least one of her attributes (bow and quiver, deer, torches), Aphrodite may be the most likely identification of the goddess on the Louvre relief.221 Artemis, Hekate Brauron In her Attic sanctuary at Brauron the cult of Artemis Brauronia was closely connected with the childhood and adolescence of girls, with pregnancy and child birth.222 The excavations have recovered three votive reliefs with sacrificial scenes, all relatively large ones and of good quality, 219 Hausmann 1960, 69; Charbonneaux 1963, 120; Peschlow-Bindokat, Jdl87 (1972) 156 R 68 hesitantly. 220 Particularly Dionysos, Apollo, Artemis and Aphrodite. 221 Goats sacrific ed to Aphrodite: e.g .

PRE-KILL 81 dating from the fourth century B.C. In all three a number of children are conspicuously present. Aristonike's dedication [R73: Brauron 1151] has already been pre-sented as an introductory example of a votive relief. The group of wor-shippers consists of four couples, each with one child. The children are arranged according to age: they get smaller from front to back, and the last one, at the rear, is too young to walk by himself and is carried on his mothers' arm. Obviously the parents also get younger towards the rear of the group, though it is perhaps less obvious that they should decrease in size as well. Size in their case undoubtedly has more to do with their relative importance than with how tall they really were. According to the inscription on the architrave, this relief is the dedication of one woman, Aristonike.223 In all likelihood Aristonike is the woman of the first couple; but she, the dedicant, does not even walk up front. Another votive relief from Brauron was dedicated, according to the inscription on the architrave, by the woman Peisis [Fig. 86, R74: Brauron 1152]. In the representation again the woman dedicant takes second place behind her husband. They are followed by a woman, probably a nanny, accompanying four children of different ages. As in the votive relief of Aristonike, an expensive bovine victim is offered to the goddess. In Aristonike's relief Artemis was depicted alone, in Peisis' relief she is represented together with her mother Leto and her brother Apollo. In the third relief the arrangement of the worshippers is less patriarchal [Fig. 87, R75: Brauron 1153]. The woman, by whom or on whose behalf this dedication was set up, precedes her family, with a small child standing in front of her, closest to the goddess. She is followed by three bearded men, a youth and two more children. Artemis is seated on the left with a deer by her side. It is interesting to see how the deviation from the con-ventional arrangement posed some problems for the sculptor. Since it was considered important to have the woman and child directly in front of the goddess, they occupy the place where normally the altar and the sacrificial animal with its attendant would be. The altar, in this relief, is simply left out. The victim and its handler are pushed into the background on the further side of the woman and the child. As a result, so little of the animal is visible that one has to look twice to determine its species (it is a goat). 223 Inscription: ·Ap't£j.ltOt Ell/;Uj.l£Vll 6.V£S11KEV 'Apt<J'tOVlKll 'Av'ttqlcnouc; 80pUt£OJC; yuv\"."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"82 CHAPTER TWO Echinos A most interesting addition to the corpus of Greek votive reliefs has recently come to light in an emergency excavation at Echinos (modern Achinos) on the Malian Gulf, in the borderland between Malis and Achaia Phthiotis [Fig. 88, R75bi': Lamia AE 1041). The relief, which is dated by the authors of the editio princeps around 300 B. C., 224 is very well pre-served, and has a uniquely rich and detailed representation. The goddess Artemis stands on the right, leaning with her left elbow on a short pillar and holding a long torch in her right hand. She carries a quiver; the top is faintly visible above her right shoulder, but the straps by which it was hung on her back are not indicated (unless they were rendered in paint). A drill-hole in Artemis' left hand indicates that it held a metal attribute perhaps a bow.225 In front of the goddess there is a monumental altar' depicted in quite convincing perspective, and from the left approach th~ worshippers. Nearest the altar is the bovine sacrificial animal; a male attendant in a short chiton grasps one of its horns with his left hand and holds a knife ready in his right hand. Behind him follows a woman who holds a small child in both hands, extending it towards the goddess, while the child in his tum reaches out in the same direction. Behind the young mother comes a female servant, carrying a flat tray on her head which is filled with an apple, a pomegranate, a myrtle bough, three pyramid-shaped cakes, and a bunch of grapes, all carved with admirable attention to detail' in her right hand she holds a small jug (a so-called askos). The last figur~ on the left is also female; she has drawn her himation over her head raises her right hand in worship, and holds a small object, perhaps a box: in her left. Above the worshippers, a pair of shoes and some clothes (from left to right: a short short-sleeved chiton, two rectangular fringed pieces of cloth, and a peplos) are hanging on a line which is strung directly underneath the epistyle of the architectonic frame of the relief. These must be votive offerings. It was a widespread custom, which we are particularly familiar with in connection with Brauronian Artemis, for women to donate the clothes which they had worn during pregnancy and at the time of childbirth to their divine protectress. Impressive inventories of votive 224 Dakoronia & Gounaropoulou, AM 107 (1992) 217-227. 225 Cf. e.g. [R73: Brauron 1151] for Artemis with bow. Since a bow is not among the possibilities suggested by Dakoronia & Gounaropoulou, ibid. 218-219, the nature of the bole may not be in favour of tbis restoration. PRE-KILL 83 clothes in the sanctuary at Brauron are preserved in inscriptions, 226 but so far the first representation of such votive clothes occurs on this relief from the sanctuary of Artemis at Echinos, where evidently a similar custom existed. The group of worshippers on the Echinos relief has some features . which deserve further attention. In the first place, there is the difference in size of the figures. The female figure carrying the tray on her head is shorter, and also carved in lower relief (more in the background, as it were), than the other two women, which is in keeping with her servant status. The male attendant with the sacrificial animal, however, is depicted on a much smaller scale yet, almost toy-size. The reason for that is not difficult to guess. The main point of the dedication clearly is the presenta-tion of the newborn child to Artemis, so vividly expressed by the gesture of the woman holding it. The effect would be lost if an approximately life size ox were to interpose itself between the child and the goddess. We have seen other votive reliefs where the same problem of the sacrificial animal interfering with the desired closeness between worshipper and deity was solved in different ways, either by pushing the victim into the back-ground [R75: Brauron 1153], or by moving it to the rear of the group [R45: Athens NM 1408]. In this case the sculptor simply shrunk it out of the way. Furthermore, the veiled woman on the left is a little taller than the young mother holding the child, probably indicating that she is of higher rank in the family, the mater familias, so to speak. Something similar, but with the more important people in front instead of at the back, could be seen in Aristonike's relief from Brauron [R73: Brauron 1151). Thus far, we have observed that our sculptor may have put a little more thought into the iconographical use of size differentiation than was usual, but the devices he used are all within the tradition of the Classical Greek votive relief. Two other elements, however, are foreign to that tradition. The first one is the maid carrying a flat uncovered tray on her head instead of the cylindrical kiste. She does not occur on other Greek votive reliefs of the Classical period, but she is a stock figure in later votive reliefs from northwest Asia Minor and Thrace.227 Secondly there is 226 F b' . . or t e mventones see Lmders 1972; for the cu stom also the somewhat obscure passage in Euripides , /phigenia Taurica 1462-1467, and Hippokrates, flEpi 7(apBEviOJv, Littre VIII p. 468, 13-14. 227 E .g .

He is holding it rather meaning-fully at the animal's throat, and this relief might indeed be assigned a lonely place in the second main group of sacrificial representations, where the actual killing of the victim is depicted. This, again, is unique for a Greek votive relief of the Classical period, but is a fairly common feature of the later East Greek reliefs.228 All in all, the new fmd from Echinos not only forms a welcome addition to the repertoire of Classical Greek votive reliefs, but it also goes some way towards providing the missing link between these and the later East Greek ones.229 Aigina In a votive relief of the late fifth century B. c., found in Palaiochora on Aigina, almost everything is unusual [R76: Athens NM 1950]. On the left is a high stepped base surmounted by an unexplained object (a bit of the left is missing). Welter suggested that it might be a model of a ship, which is neither impossible nor obvious.23o Two men in short belted chitons, such as working people would wear, 231 stand at the foot of this construc-tion, one holding (and apparently putting down) a goose, the other pouring a libation from a phiale. In the background behind the two men, rendered in very shallow relief, is a goddess holding two torches.

(eds.) 1993, 248-264. 230 Welter, AA 1938, 537-8. Welter discards the possibility that it is an altar on a high stepped base, but in my opinion that is not absolutely inconceivable; cf. the altar on the Attic black figure skyphos [VII: Athens NM 12531); see also Kahil, Artemis, LIMC II (1984) 658 nr. 461: \" autel A quatre gradins\". 231 See e.g. the haulier on a votive relief from the Athenian Asklepieion: Athens NM 1341 + , Beschi, ASAtene 47-8 (1969-70) 86 ff., fig. 1. PRE-KILL 85 right are other worshippers: a boy or youth leading a fawn, and a woman between two not very small children. The goddess may be Hekate, who had a sanctuary on Aigina, and who was especially worshipped by seamen and fishermen.232 The sacrificial animals, though uncommon, are not without parallel, but a fawn is hardly the sacrifice one would expect from people who earn their living at sea. Delphi From Delphi we have two fragments from the left part of a votive relief [R77: Delphi 1101 +]. It shows a standing goddess holding a torch, who must be Artemis according to the partly preserved inscription on the architrave, and part of a seated goddess to her right. On the near side of the chair of the seated figure, a small girl kneels on the ground, stretching out her arms. A larger fragment constituting the right part of a votive relief appears to belong, though the two nowhere join. On this second part is a group of worshippers: man, woman and little girl, preceded by an attendant leading a sheep. In the background, in front of the man, is a frontal woman carrying a liknon on her head.233 She is not the only unusual feature. Above the heads of the worshippers, on a much smaller scale, a row of six deities is rendered in low relief. They are, from right to left, Hermes, Apollo kitharoidos, a figure with cornucopia (Acheloos), and three female figures sitting behind a 'table (Nymphs).234 These small figures in the upper zone are best understood as the gods and goddesses who had their sanctuaries in the neighbourhood of the goddess to whom the relief is dedicated.235 On the architrave, part of the name of the dedicant can still be read: he may be the same Kleumenes who dedicated the relief to Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. 232 For testimonia see Welter 1962, 95 f. 233 There is a parallel for the woman carrying a liknon on her head on the votive relief [R239: Torcello Mus, Provo 640); the foremost of the group of worshippers, also a woman, puts something on the altar; there is no sacrificial animal; the recipient is an unidentified goddess. 234 The interpretation of Nymphs and Acheloos was proposed by Amandry, in : BCH Sup. 9 (1984) 398-401. 235 Cf. for instance the Bendis relief from Piraeus, Copenhagen NCG 231: Walter, OJh 31 (1939) 56 f.; Meyer 1989, 296 A 107, pI. 32, 2."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"I I 86 CHAPTER TWO Delos A sanctuary on the eastern slope of Mount Kynthos on Delos is nowadays generally identified as the shrine of Artemis Lochia mentioned in Euripi-des' /phigeneia in Tauris.236 More than a dozen (fragments of) votive reliefs were found there, some with pregnant women, and some with scenes of sacrifice. All date from the advanced Hellenistic age, except one, which is probably not much later than the end of the Classical period, and happens to be the most completely preserved one [Fig. 89, R78: Delos A 3153]. It depicts Artemis standing on the left, holding a torch; a servant with the sacrificial goat at a cylindrical altar; and a worshipping couple with three small children.237 ApoLLo Apollo is the recipient of a sacrifice on two votive reliefs of the fourth century B. C., both incomplete, and both of unknown provenance. On a fragment in Copenhagen [Fig. 90, R83: Copenhagen NCG 232 a] the god is depicted playing the kithara, standing on the left of an altar. At the altar stands an attendant holding a young sheep and a kanoun. Of the worship-pers two men and two children remain, and the hand of another adult. The other fragment [Fig. 91, R84: Detroit 25. 14] is a dedication, according to the inscription on the architrave, of a group a hebdoma-fstai.238 Voutiras has advanced strong arguments to link this relief with some that have been found in the Pythion in Ikaria (Attika).239 The hebdomaistai must have been a religious association named after the seventh day of the month, which was generally considered as Apollo's birthday?40 The fragment in Detroit is the left part of a relief with Apollo seated on the omphalos, holding a phiale and a laurel branch. In front of him is an altar. Of the sacrificial attendant the head and one arm holding 236 Bruneau 1970, 191-195.

PRE-KILL 87 the kanoun remain, and part of the head of the victim (probably a sheep); finally one arm of a worshipper survives. Dionysos From Koropi in Attika (probably on the territory of the deme Sphettos) comes a votive relief to Dionysos, with sixteen male worshippers in two rows, some of whom hold wreaths [Fig. 92, R86: Athens NM 2400]. In front of them, at the altar, is a small servant with a kanoun and a pig. Dionysos stands on the right, wearing a short chiton, nebris and endro-mides, and holding a kantharos in his right hand. This may be a dedication of a choregos, depicted with the fifteen members of the tragic chorus, who had won at a Dionysiac festival. 241 Herakles Athens Asklepieion Herakles was worshipped, in or near the Asklepieion on the south slope of the Akropolis, as a healing god, to whom anatomical ex votos were dedicated. According to later sources this cult of Herakles, named Meny-tes, was founded by Sophokles.242 This Herakles must be the recipient of a curious egg-shaped marble votive offering, found on the south slope of the Akropolis [R89: Athens EpM 8793]. The peculiar form is almost certainly to be explained by the fact, that a piece of marble was used originally intended for a funeral vase, the shape of which had already been roughed out. 243 The surface of the relief is badly damaged, but the main elements can be made out. On the left of an altar stands Herakles. On the right are four adult worshippers and two small children, and a servant leading the sacrificial animal (a pig or a sheep). The dedication is in-scribed above the relief: \"Lysistrate has dedicated this to Herakles on behalf of her children. ,,244 241 The youthful god, to whom a sheep is offered on the Athenian votive relief [R87: Paris Louvre 754], is interpreted as Dionysos by Charbonneaux 1963, 120. He has no distinctive attributes (the staff he holds is not necessarily a thyrsos). But I suspect that the relief may have been reworked anyway. 242 See Van Straten, BABesch 49 (1974) 168/11; id., in Versnel (ed.) 1981, 106/ 1.1. 243 Probably a funeral marble loutrophoros, cf.

A little to the south of what used to be the Fix brewery in Athens, not an unlikely location for the Herakleion at Kynosarges,245 a votive relief to Herakles was found [Fig. 93, R90: Athens EpM 3942]. It is of modest dimensions (27 x 43 cm), and is dominated by an enormous sacrificial bull in the centre of the representation, restrained by a servant in a loin-cloth. Herakles stands on the right, and on the left are the worshippers: a couple with a child and a maid with a kiste. The dedication is inscribed on the architrave. 246 Herakles and the Siiulenbau On a series of votive reliefs Herakles is associated with a construction consisting of four columns placed at the corners of a square foundation and supporting an epistyle.247 There are slight variations and often the artist has not bothered to show more than two of the four columns, but unmistakably the same type of building is intended, which must have been in use as a typical form of Herakleion in Attika, and probably elsewhere in Greece. It was a permanent stone or wooden framework which on festive occasions was decked with boughs and thus transformed into a pleasant shady pavilion, where Herakles could enjoy the banquet prepared for him by his worshippers. 248 On a votive relief reportedly from Ithome (Messenia) and dating from the early fourth century B. C., Herakles stands next to such a building [Fig. 94, R92: Athens NM 1404]. From the right approaches a man with a sheep and a bovine sacrificial animal. Bovine victims are also offered on the reliefs in Rome, said to be from Athens [R93: Rome Mus. Bar. 136], and in Venice [R94: Venice 100].249 On the latter, the worshippers are a man preceded by a boy and a youth.

Herakles is seated in his Siiulenbau, on the left.252 At Herakles' feet is a low rounded altar (eschtira). On the right is a bovine victim, and a man who by his dress (a long loose short-sleeved chiton) and the machaira in his left hand is characterized as a priest. 253 The priest is followed by a young man. Herakles reclining In view of Herakles' proverbial gluttony, it is not surprising that he is frequently represented reclining at a banquet. 254 On a votive relief in Sofia [Fig. 95, R96: Sofia], the reclining Herakles receives three worshippers, who are preceded by a tiny servant with a kanoiin and a diminutive sheep. The provenance of the relief is unknown, and its date may be the third century B. C . Pankrates and Palaimon In 1952 a most intriguing sanctuary was discovered in Athens, on the spot where the Ilissos crossed the King George II Street. A total of some forty votive reliefs were recovered. m Before its discovery, no indications of the existence of this sanctuary existed. The principal deities worshipped here, and depicted on the votive reliefs, are a bearded god with a cornucopia, named Palaimon on one inscribed relief; a youthful god closely resembling 250 Athens NM 2723, Svoronos 379, pI. 101, 121; Travlos 1971, 276. 251 Van Straten, BABesch 54 (1979) 189-190. . 252 The epistyle in this relief is not curved, as Themelis, Prakt 1982, 173, has it , but It forms a corner, suggesting that the Saulenbau is set at an angle to the background. 253 S ee Mantes 1990 (who seems to have overlooked this relief). 254 E .g. on a Classical relief from Rhamnous : Prakt 1982, 128, pI. 86.

Palaimon, as far as we get to know him from the Athenian reliefs and some comparable material from elsewhere, seems to have been rather like Plouton or Ploutos.257 Confusingly, the only published relief with a sacrificial animal shows the bearded god with cornucopia and phiale, seated on a throne on the right, but it has an inscribed dedication to Pankrates [Fig. 96, R97: Athens 1st Eph.]258 At the altar in the centre stands an attendant with kanoun and pig. The group of worshippers, on the left, comprises two men, a woman and a child. On another relief from the same sanctuary the bearded god with cornucopia is seated on a rock [Fig. 97, R98: Athens 1st Eph.]. There is no sacrificial animal, but the foremost of three worshippers, a kneeling woman, presents him with a table loaded with cakes or fruit. The third worshipper, on the far left, may in fact be the maid with the kiste. Nymphs There were many sides to the Nymphs, most of them nice.259 They were closely connected with the land, and the various aspects of its nature, like mountains and caves, water, and vegetation. They promoted the fertility of the soil and the animals, and also protected human offspring. They were generally helpful, and had so many shrines scattered around the countryside that for most people one of them would always be close at hand. Beside other votive offerings, votive reliefs were offered to the Nymphs in many of their sanctuaries. A considerable number of these have survived, testifying to the popularity of their cult. 260 From about the middle of the fourth century B.C . the Nymph reliefs typically have an irregular frame suggesting the mouth of a cave. Before that time, in the late fifth and early fourth century, we sometimes see a small stylized cave of Pan in the upper part of the relief field.261 This constitutes a clear 256 Robert, BE 1959,124; 1960, 134. 257 Van Straten, BABesch 49 (1974) 170-172. 258 Inscription: [6 oEivcx. n]cx.VICpC£'tTJt d)~aI1Evo<; o.vt9TJICEV. 259 Nilsson 1967, 244 ff. ; Herter, RE XVII (1937) s.v. \"Nymphai\"; Van Straten, BABesch 51 (1976) 1-38; but see Connor, CIAnt 7 (1988) 155-189. 260 Feubel 1935; Fuchs, AM 77 (1962) 242-249; Edwards 1985. 261 Neumann 1979, 54. PRE-KILL 91 reference to the fact that Nymphs were often worshipped in caves, but it will soon have become little more than a conventional feature, like the architectural frame of other votive reliefs. Sometimes they are, rather illogically, combined, with the cave frame set within the architectural frame. 262 Among the numerous Nymph reliefs, depictions of animal sacrifice are surprisingly rare. Before speculating on possible reasons for this, suppos-edly to be found in the peculiarities of popular worship of the Nymphs, one should note that it is not specifically sacrificing worshippers, but worshippers in any form whatsoever, that are scarce on these reliefs. So whatever the reason, it cannot have to do with animal sacrifice as such. One of the rare examples with an animal sacrifice is an Attic fourth century relief in a British private collection [Fig. 98, R99: Mus. Worsleyanum].263 Inside a cave we see a rustic altar, towards which a servant in exomis leads a sheep, accompanied by three male and two female worshippers; the women have their head covered with a slip of the himation. Hermes and three Nymphs, of impressive stature, appear to perform a chain dance at the altar; the head of Acheloos is on the right, and Pan sits just outside the cave, in the upper left corner. A fragment of a relief from the general area of the Athenian agora [RIOI: Athens Agora S 2905] has part of a sacrificial pig, and part of a dancing goddess who may be one of either the Nymphs or the Charites. According to an isolated scrap of information from the Hellenistic scholar Polemon of Ilion, the Athenians offered wineless sacrifices to (among others) the Nymphs.264 Fuchs has observed that this statement is refuted by a votive relief from Mount Pentelikon [RIOO: Athens NM 4466], where a man (Agathemeros, according to the inscription on the base supporting this relief) is pouring a libation to the Nymphs from a kantharos, which implies wine.265 Strictly speaking, there need not be a contradiction. Polemon's expression nephalia hiera means that no wine 262 E .g. fourth century Nymph relief from Piraeus: Berlin 710 (K 84), Blumel 1966, 78 nr. 91, fig. 130; Edwards 1985, 540 nr. 31.

Furthermore, the passage from Polemon has come down to us as an isolated fragment without context, and it is uncertain whether it means that only wineless sacrifices were offered on all occa-sions to these deities, or that wineless sacrifices could be offered on certain occasions. But this may be belabouring the point. Anyone who is marginally familiar with the endless variety of sacrificial regulations in sacred laws, will hesitate to accept that any such general rule as some have read into the Polemon passage, would indeed obtain on all occasions at all sanctuaries of the deities he lists. In the sacrificial calendar from the deme Erchia there are, in fact, two sacrifices to the Nymphs that are not wineless .266 In the rock face of the quarry of Hagios Minas on Paros, a dedication is carved of the Odrysian Adamas to the Nymphs, dating from the fourth century B.C . [R102: Paros].267 Above the inscription is a complex relief, now partly destroyed. The greater part of the relief was occupied by a large crowd of deities, among whom Nymphs, Attis, Plouton, Demeter, Gaia, Silenos, Pan, the Korybantes, may be identified with more or less confidence. In the bottom right comer is a group of worshippers, one of them a kneeling woman, and an attendant leading a sacrificial victim (a sheep?) . 268 Heroes Aineias the Tactician, a fourth century writer of a military handbook, has an interesting chapter on secret messages.269 One way to convey such a 266 LS 18, A 14-16 and E 44-46; since several other sacrifices in this inscription are explicitly characterized as VT]<p&.AlOC;, the absence of this stipulation may be taken as significant. 267 Inscription: 'ABalLlXC; I 'OBpucrllC; I NUIl<PlXlC;. 268 A Hellenistic relief from Rhodos depicts women sacrificing a goat, maybe to the Nymphs [RI03: Rhodos 4633]. 269 Aineias the Tactician, rIepi TOf) \"w~ Zpr, \"OJ..LOPKOVJltvov~ aVTtzelv, 31 rIepi cmuTQJ..wv Kpvrpaiwv, 15: ),pa<pol'to 0' iiv !ClXl EiC; 1tlVa!ClOv fJPOll!COV Ii1tEP iiv ~ouAn. t1tEl'tlX KlX'tlXAE'IlKwcrlXl KlXl l;T]pavlXV'tlX )'paljllXl l1t1tElX <POlcr<pOpOV 1\\ 0 'tl iiv ~ouAn, tXOV'tlX llllX'tlcrllOV A£'IlKOV KlXl 'tov \\1t1tOV AE'IlKov' Ei Bt 11\", !ClXl &'AACfJ XPWlllX'tl, 1tA\"V IlEAlXVOC;. t1tEl'tlX BOUVlXl 'tlVl <XVlXSEtVlXl tnuc; 'tijc; 1tOAEOlC; EiC; 0 iiv 'tuxn lEPOV WC; Eul;aILEvoc;. ov Bt OEt <XVlX)'VWVlXl 't<X )'E),PlXIlIlEVlX, XP\" tMOV'tlX EiC; 'to lEPOV !ClXl )'VOV'tlX 'to 1tlva!ClOv cr'llcrcr\"ILCfJ 'tlVl 1tPOcr'llY!CElILEVCfJ, <X1tEVE)'!clXV'tlX EiC; OiKOV SEtVlXl PRE-KILL 93 message made use of a painted votive tablet for a hero shrine (pinakion heroik6n). The secret message was to be written on the wood; it should then be whitened and dried. Finally one should paint a horseman on it, or whatever else one wanted. Two things emerge. A hero shrine would never be far away. And the first thing that would come to mind when one had to think of an appropri-ate representation for a votive offering to a hero would be a rider. The wooden pinakia heroika mentioned by Aineias have not survived, but we may assume that on terracotta and marble votive reliefs too the hero was often represented as a horseman. This is confirmed by a number of inscribed examples.270 On a relief from Laurion, the hero rider is armed.271 That heroes were often thought of as armed is also clear from an allusion in Aristophanes' Wasps.272 Then again, the hero warrior may be shown dismounted, standing beside his horse.273 With striking frequency the hero is accompanied by a female deity, his consort the heroine, who-one might almost say-is as much an attribute of the hero as his horse.274 More often than not the hero, standing beside his horse, and the heroine are depicted performing a libation.275 A very similar type of representation has the divine couple pouring a libation, the god in armour, but without a horse.276 In the light of the series of reliefs mentioned above, I think that notwithstanding the absence of the horse these latter ones too should be taken as votive reliefs to a hero, rather than to Ares, who is by no means a prominent receiver of votive gifts. Yet another variant shows the hero seated on a diphros [Fig. 99, R 113 : Patrai].

The representations we have seen so far would seem to refer to the hero's way of life, to his general image: he is thought of, somewhat vaguely one gathers, as a horseman, a warrior, and a family man. The second large group of reliefs has to do with a particular feature of hero cult: the hero, usually together with his consort, is reclining at a banquet, set on the trapeza that according to several sacred laws of Classical Greece was often offered to heroes, though not exclusively to them.277 The conventional name of this type of relief, \"Totenmahl\" or \"Funeral Banquet\", has proved extremely unfortunate. In the archaeologi-cal literature these reliefs are all too often thoughtlessly interpreted as grave reliefs, even after the basically sound treatment of the subject by Th6nges-Stringaris.278 Her conclusion that in the Classical period banquet reliefs of the broad type are generally to be taken as votive reliefs remains valid, and can now be based on more than double the amount of evidence. Banquet reliefs do occur on Classical grave stelai, but these are clearly distinguished from the votive banquet reliefs by the shape of the stone and the somewhat reduced version of the representation. The two main types of representation, the hero horseman and the hero banqueting, are sometimes combined in one relief.279 Or a small votive tablet of a rider hero is incorporated in a banquet scene.280 But more commonly, of course, in banquet reliefs only the horse's head, often shown within a sort of frame or window panel, reminds us of the eques-trian qualities of the hero. Occasionally some of the hero's arms are depicted, hanging on the wall.281 Furthermore the hero frequently has a young attendant, running beside his horse or acting as oinochoos at the banquet. Both in riding and in 277 E .g . Athens: LS 1 A 19; Marathonian Tetrapolis: LS 20 B 4, 23-25; Thorikos: SEG 33 (1983) 147 passim.

PRE-KILL 95 banqueting he may be (but need not be) accompanied by a snake,282 an attribute he shares with many gods. In not quite all of the banquet reliefs he holds a rhyton.283 Along the lines sketched above it is possible to compile a reliable corpus of Classical Greek votive reliefs to heroes. With very few excep-tions these tum out to be private offerings. As a group, the hero reliefs are distinctly more numerous than those of any single deity. The relative importance of hero worship in private religion must have been far greater than our literary sources suggest. Something of the nature of the heroes, as conceived by their worship-pers, may be gleaned from their names inscribed on some of the reliefs. Some of the names hint at their horsemanship (Zeuxippos,284 Chrys-ippos,285 Hippalkmos286) or at their martial character (Aleximachos,287 Symmachos288) , both recurring features of their iconography, as we have seen. But a considerable number of names or epithets found on the hero reliefs point to the hero's benevolent, kind and helpful character. He is called epekoos (hearing prayers?89 or Eukolos (good natured?90. In Epidauros the same word £UlCOAOC; was used as an epithet of Asklepios. 291 Similarly a hero Sosineos (saviour of ships) was worshipped at Andros and in Attika at Thorikos, 292 whereas elsewhere GroG\\. v£roc; is found as an 282 Cf.

But in some respects they had a considerable advantage over the great gods, which made them more popular to the common worshipper than even Asldepios: the heroes were near.297 Near in the geographical sense, for the nearest hero shrine will never have been far away, but also in a spiritual sense: the more modest stature of the hero made him seem much more accessible to the people who sought help for their every-day troubles and problems.298 The intimacy between the heroes and their worshippers is reflected, I think, in the many dedications of votive offerings t<'i'> llprol., to the hero, without a name. Some of these heroes may well have been nameless, but even if they had a proper name, to the worshippers their hero was simply \"The Hero\" . Of the several hundreds of votive reliefs to heroes known to us, close to a hundred have scenes of animal sacrifice.299 By far the most of them are banquet reliefs. In addition to these, there are twenty or so without a sacrificial animal, but with the maid carrying the kiste. We have seen this 293 Latyschev, IOSPontEux II 25, p . 22. 294 IG IF 4591. 295 New York, BulMMA 16 (1957-58) 190. Dow, BAmSocP 22 (1985) 33-47. 296 Athens NM 1522, Svoronos pI. 130.

Without context, it is hard to tell whether Aristophanes ff. 318 Kassel-Austin (= 304 Kock): oi 'Yup ijpro~ E'Y'Yil~ £lal v, is a worrying or a comforting remark. 298 On hero cult see Deneken, Heros, in: Roscher I (1884-1890) 2441-2589; Farnell 1921; Nock, HarvTheolR 37 (1944) 141-174 (= Essays 11,1972,575-602); Kearns 1989. 299 In this number some Hellenistic ones are sure to be included; sometimes it is hard to decide between a late Classical and a Hellenistic date for a relief, and in such cases I have preferred to err on the generous side. PRE-KILL 97 feature before, in reliefs of other gods, and I have proposed the interpret-ation that they refer to the bringing of bloodless offerings such as cakes. That it occurs so frequently in hero reliefs, agrees well with the fact that the setting of a table with such offerings was a particularly common part of hero cult. Hero reliefs with animal sacrifice, in so far as their provenances are known, come from all over the Greek world, from Kerkyra to the Greek cities in Asia Minor, and from Rhodos to the northern shores of the Black Sea. I have singled out only a few, with special characteristics, for some brief observations. Of the varieties of hero rider reliefs, the type with the hero dismounted pouring a libation together with the heroine would seem to lend itself best to the addition of a group of worshippers bringing a sacrificial victim. That is what we see on a relief from Pergamon [Fig. 100, Rill: Priv. colI. Nicholson].300 This is one of several instances among the hero reliefs where the servant and the sacrificial animal (a sheep) are reduced to diminutive proportions, hardly reaching to the knee of an adult worship-per. In other cases the worshippers are combined with a hero horseman in full swing, sitting on a rearing horse [RI12: Vienna AS I 1083]. In a relief from Amorgos [Fig. 101, RI09: Amorgos], this lively hero is combined with a heroine standing at the altar, and two snakes, one of which is coiled round the trunk of a tree, while the other one appears to eat something that lies on the altar. All this does not leave much room for the worship-pers and the attendant with the sacrificial sheep on the right. A relief from Boiotian Hyettos, with a mounted hero, is exceptional in that the worship-per has lifted up the sacrificial pig, which is not very small, and holds it above the altar [RIOS: Malesina]. The other one, from Thebes, with a dismounted hero and heroine pouring a libation, has a rounded altar in the shape of a low omphalos or high escbara [Fig. 102, RI06: Thebes 62]. A sacrifice to a seated hero occurs on two reliefs. One is in Patrai [RI13: Patrai], already mentioned. The group of worshippers consists of four men, three women and two children, in a strangely separatist arrange-300 The provenance is given as Smyrna by Waldstein, lHS 7 (1886) 250; and as Rhodos by Mitropoulou, Libation (1975) 20 nr.l0. There is, however, no possible doubt that this relief is identical with the one seen in Pergamon by Le Bas, mono fig. 139."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"98 CHAPTER TWO ment: first the four men, then the women and children. The other relief is from Olbia [R114: Olbia]. The seated hero is characterized by a snake, and a shield and breast-plate hanging on the wall. The sacrificial proces-sion with a bovine victim is preceded by a female kanephoros, and in-cludes a pipe-player, two elements that suggest a public rather than a private ceremony. A banquet relief found in Athens, a little to the southeast of the Akro-polis [Fig. 103, R126: Athens NM 3873], combines many of the more usual characteristics of the type. In the upper left corner is a slightly sunken panel with a horse' s head in low relief. On the right the bearded hero reclines on a couch, with his head to the right, leaning, as it were, against the anta of the relief. He holds a large rhyton in his raised right hand and a cup or possibly a phiale in his left hand. The heroine sits on the foot-end of the same couch, turned towards her spouse. With her right hand she puts some incense, which she has taken from a box in her left hand, into a thymiaterion standing on the table in front of the couch. On the table there are also some cakes and perhaps fruits, towards which a snake, coiled underneath the table, reaches up. On the right, carved in low relief on the anta, is the oinochoos (the cupbearer who serves at most of the heroic banquets). To the left of the table, still in front of the couch, is an altar, on the near side of which is the servant with kanoun and pig. The left part of the relief is rather crowded by the group of worshippers, a man and a woman (head covered), and, carved on the left anta, the maid carrying the kiste. There are three children, the smallest of whom is shooing a goose towards the altar. The goose is exceptional. All the other elements are found in many other reliefs. A fragment of a double-relief (amphiglyphon) comes from the Athenian Asklepieion or its neigbourhood [RI15: Athens Akr 3013]. On one side (A) only the worshippers remain, in the right part of the relief: a man and a woman, followed by a big girl and two smaller boys; on the left, in front of the man, is a small girl (there may have been another child, but the relief is broken there). This is another instance of a child being depicted at the head of the group of worshippers, nearest to the god (or gods, who is/are missing in this relief). On the other side (B), the deities were on the right, again in the missing part of the relief, but enough remains of a couch and table to recognize the type as a hero banquet. The group of worshippers, coming from the left, corresponds in composition with that on (A) except for an additional very small child (which, on the other side, PRE-KILL 99 may have been in the missing part). On (B) the man and woman are foremost, the children behind them, and they are accompanied by a servant with kanoun and sheep, an a maid with kiste. We could interpret (A) as the supplication for the well-being of the youngest child(ren), and (B) as a subsequent thank-offering. The recipient may be one of the heroes worshipped in and near the Asklepieion. A healing hero is certainly intended on a banquet relief in the Kanello-poulos collection [Fig. 104, R174: Athens Kan. 14]. An anatomical ex voto in the form of a large leg is depicted on the left. The provenance is unknown. If it should be from Athens, we might think of the Heros latros, or Amynos, but probably any hero could be a healer if so implored. A Hellenistic relief from Samos [R161: Samos Tigani 307] has an interesting sacrificial scene to the left of the reclining hero and his con-sort. Several figures and a sheep stand round an altar. A small figure holds up a kanoUn, and both a man and a woman appear to take something from it. Unfortunately the surface is rather damaged, so the reading of the scene is not entirely certain. A fragment in a private collection [Fig. 105, R188: Priv. coIl. Bern] has a number of unusual features. The right part of the relief with most of the reclining hero is missing. On the left are four adult worshippers, a woman (head covered) followed by three men. In the foreground is a disproportionately small servant in exomis, leading an equally small sheep with his right hand and holding in his left a tray or kanoun covered with a cloth. He moves in the direction of the table in front of the couch, and from underneath that table a snake stretches out his head towards this small servant (or rather, I assume, towards the offerings he brings). On the bottom ledge part of the dedication is preserved, by Timon to the hero.30 1 A banquet relief from Corinth [RI40: Corinth S 2644], with the sacrifice of a sheep, seems to have an unusual low rubble altar. Only part of the relief is preserved, and consequently the interpretation is somewhat doubtful. One of the most un-monumental votive reliefs comes from Sikyon [R14l: Sikyon 345]. A complete banquet scene, with hero, heroine, two worshippers and a servant with pig and kanoun at an altar, surrounded by the conventional architectural frame, is accommodated on a marble plaque of 12 x 15 cm. From snout to tail the victim measures barely 2 cm. 301 Inscription: TiIl(J)V f\\P(J)t [---J."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"100 CHAPTER TWO On a relief from Megara [Fig. 106, R137: Athens NM 1532], the servant leads two victims towards the banqueting hero: a sheep and a pig. They walk side by side, and of the pig, which is on the far side, only part of the snout and forelegs is visible, but that is enough for identification. On a banquet relief in Istanbul [Fig. 107, R149: Istanbul 407], dated to c . 300 B. c. , the hero holds a phiale in his right hand from which the snake drinks; underneath the table is a dog. At the altar, on the left, several worshippers are squeezed into a limited space. On the far side of the altar a youth (or girl?) holds a kanoun or a tray in front of a bearded man, who is putting something on the altar. On the near side, largely obscured by two children, is a small servant with a sheep; on the far left two women complete the party. This relief was found on the Thracian Chersonesos (the Gallipoli peninsula). In that area was Elaious, where the hero Protesilaos was worshipped, who is the subject of Philostratos' Heroikos. He might be the hero on this relief. On a banquet relief from the Polites collection [RI87: Private coll.], the group of worshippers consists of nine bearded men, probably an association of some sort or a board of magistrates. A third century banquet relief from far away Olbia [Fig. 108, R150: Olbia], has a group of five bearded men, whom the inscription identifies as the board of grain buyers (crt1:&Vat) and their secretary, who have dedicated this relief (1:U1tOC;) to the (apparently nameless) heros epekoos.302 2 .3.

In the early fifth century A.D . , Macrobius, Saturnalia III 5, 8, sums up many earlier testimonia: observatum est a sacrifieantibus ut, si hostia quae ad aras dueeretur fuisset vehementius reluetata os tendissetque se invitam altaribus admoveri, amoveretur quia invito deo offerri eam putabant. quae autem stetisset oblata, hane volenti numini dari aestimabant. -In Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980) 92-94, the \" large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might PRE-KILL 101 quite common for sacrificial animals to be restrained by ropes tied to their heads and legs. An ox may have as many as three of its legs secured [V107: London B 80]. The servants of Bousiris copy this method when trying to sacrifice Herakles. Small sucking-pigs were unceremoniously carried by one hind leg, and occasionally a full-grown sheep would be bodily carried to the altar. 304 These cases can not be excused by a refer-ence to the vase painting artisan' s indifference towards ritual propriety. On many votive reliefs too, some mild pulling and shoving of the animal is going on. And even on such a carefully thought out public monument as the Parthenon frieze, the Greeks did not shy away from showing that the voluntary cooperation of the victims had better not be taken for granted. 305 Later votive reliefs sometimes are very explicit in showing how the bulls are restrained by a rope which is tied to their head and passed through a ring at the base of the altar (in several places such altar rings have been found in situ306). By pulling this rope, the animal can be forced to its \"knees\". 307 Much the same technique is used in modem Greek almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips\" , goes one step further and shoots itself.

A sheep was sprinkled with some of the chernips, and if it jerked its head, that was taken as consent. The act might be repeated if the trick did not work the first time, but within reason. If the animal had to be almost drowned in the process before showing the required reaction, things were sure to go wrong.309 Bovine animals might be induced to bend their head in consent, by being given a drink of water, or perhaps in other ways. 310 It is striking that in the iconographical material even these formalities get very little attention. As far as this class of evidence goes, the formal sign of consent of the sacrificial victim clearly was not an aspect of the ritual that was thought particularly interesting or important. 837; Robert, Hellenica 9 (1950) 63, pI.

CHAPTER THREE THE KILLING In this group I have included not only pictures of the precise moment that the killing instrument (axe or knife) hits or pierces the body of the victim, but also those showing the immediately preceding moment, when the instrument is held poised for the blow. It seems a fair assumption that there too the interest is in the act of killing. Even so, this is not a large group: representations of the actual killing of the sacrificial animal are not numerous in Archaic and Classical Greece. To begin with, there is only one votive relief,l and that uncertain. The relief, which is now in the Chalkis museum [Fig. 109, R225: Chalkis 7], formerly was in Larymna (Lokris/Boiotia), but nothing is known of its ultimate provenance or the circumstances of its discovery. The marble was recognized as Thespian by Rodenwaldt. 2 Its style suggests a date about 400 B.C. We see a man bestriding a ram from behind, clasping it between his knees and pressing it down on the rocky ground. With his left hand under the animal's chin, he pulls its head up and backwards, exposing its throat to the knife or sword he holds in his right hand. We will encounter approximately the same motif in vase painting. There is really no decisive argument for or against interpreting this relief as votive. Its shape (the top part is missing, but originally it must have been somewhat higher than wide) does not help either way. Roden-waldt's tentative proposal to connect it with the cult of the Kabeiroi, which has lingered on in scholarly literature on the subject, is not based on any substantial argument. 3 For the rest of this chapter, we have only vase paintings to work with. From a practical point of view these representations may be classified according to the size of the animal, since that would determine, at least partly, the manner in which the animal was killed. 1 Or two if we include the votive relief from Echinos [R75bi': Lamia AE 1041], discussed in the previous chapter. 2 Rodenwaldt, Jdl28 (1913) 326 ff. 3 Rodenwaldt, Jdl28 (1913) 327-8; Kern, RE s.v.\"Kabeiros und Kabeiroi\", 1418; Hemberg 1950,253."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"104 CHAPTER THREE 3. 1. SMALL ANIMALS The inside tondo of an Attic red figure kylix of the late sixth century [Fig. 110, V147: Paris Louvre G 112] depicts the sacrifice of a small pig. A youth, squatting at the altar, supports the animal with his right hand and forearm, at the same time grasping its snout with his left hand, thus closing its mouth, and, by drawing the head up and back, exposing the throat. The sacrificial knife is held ready by a bearded man, who with an eloquent gesture of his left hand indicates that the animal should be held well over the altar. Thus, when the animal's throat is cut, its blood will gush directly onto the altar, which, in fact, is already stained with the blood of previous sacrifices. The Greeks could describe this procedure expressively and succinctly by \"cut an animal's throat onto or into something. ,,4 Making the altar bloody, was an essential part of sacrifice, and it was considered important that blood was abundantly poured over it. 5 Loukia-nos, in his irreverent pamphlet On sacrifices, evokes an image of a priest, up to his elbows in gore, pouring the blood round the altar, and the gods gathering round to drink it like flies.6 This is a caricature, of course. For Theophrastos, getting covered in blood at a sacrifice was of the same order as wiping ones nose while eating, spitting while talking, and belch-ing at you in the middle of a drink: not things, we gather, an Athenian gentleman was supposed to do.7 However, if we try to imagine what it was like on the Akropolis at the time of the Greater Panathenaia, when, during the heyday of the Athenian empire, hundreds of cows would be slaugh-tered at the altar of Athena, we may suspect that one could only remain a gentleman by letting others do the work.

THE KILLING 105 ately above the altar, the blood was caught in a basin specially provided for that purpose, the so called sphageion, and subsequently poured over the altar. 8 An Apulian vase painting of c. 400 B.C. [Fig. 111, V149: Naples 2411] depicts the sacrifice of a young goat to Dionysos. Behind a ~arge altar decorated with a bucranium with fillet stands a woman wearmg a fawn-skin over her chiton. She holds the knife in her right hand, support-ing the kid with the other, holding it over the altar, . on whi~h a small fi~e burns. Next to the altar, on the right, is a table WIth an omochoe on It, towards which a woman approaching from the right brings a basket filled with cakes. A small archaic image of Dionysos with thyrsos and kantharos stands at the altar. In the upper zone, the god \"himself\", so to speak, relaxes in the company of maenads and a satyr. Such an interesting double presence of the god, both as an old-fashioned cult statue and in a more contemporary manifestation, is not uncommon on South Italian vases, but A . 9 rarely occurs on UIC ones. 8 In Homer, Odyssey 3,444, it is called a.llviov, explained by the scholion ad Loc.: o<p<xyel:ov' ei<; 'tou'to liE npro'tov atlla liexollevol 'tol:<; I3wllol:<; EnlxEO'llot.

MEDIUM-SIZED ANIMALS The tondo of an Attic red figure kylix of the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 112, V144: Cleveland 26.242], offers one of the rare examples of the sacrificial knife (or rather, in this case, sword) actually piercing the throat of the victim. This, however, clearly is an unusual type of sacrifice. The sacrificer, bestriding the ram from behind and drawing its head back with his left hand, much as on the Chalkis relief, is a warrior wearing a helmet. As Jameson saw, this is probably a representation of the sphtigia on the battlefield, immediately before a battle. 10 Such a sacrifice was not a burnt offering, nor was part of the animal prepared for a meal. Its main point was divination, probably by the flow of blood (which in this vase painting is explicitly indicated by added red).11 From the vase painter's point of view, choosing a sacrifice of the sphagia-type as motif would almost inevitably entail the depiction of the act of sphtizein. An-other picture of the battlefield sphtigia, together with a battle scene, is found on a fragmentary calyx-krater about half a century later [VI46: Malibu 86.AE.213].12 A picture on an Attic calyx-krater of c. 420 B.C. may be included here [V 143: Boston 03.796], although it is debatable whether it really shows the moment of killing. A youth bestrides the victim, in this case a goat, from behind in the by now familiar fashion, holding it by the horns. There is, however, no knife to be seen. The scene is situated in a sanctuary of 10 Jameson, in CVA Cleveland I , ad pI. 37, I.

These battlefield (HPO:yW. are not to be confused with the tepo., which were offered earlier, even in camp before setting out, and which entailed tepo01co1tiex, i.e. divination by inspection of the inner organs, especially the liver, of the victims: see Pritchett 1979, 83 ff.

Various interpretations have been suggested: Schmidt, in: Opus Nobile. Fests. U, Jantzen (1969) 141-152; Griffiths, BICS 32 (1985) 49-50 and 36 (1989) 139. -Battlefield sphagia are also depicted on the reliefs from the so called heroon at Gjolbashi (Trysa, Lycia): Eichler 1950, 62, pI. 19; see also Oberleitner 1994. THE KILLING 107 Hermes: the god himself stands on the left, and two votive pinakes and a small herm-statuette hang on the wall. The next two vase paintings are not very straightforward either, as depictions of sacrifice. First there is the fragmentary pelike by the Pan Painter [V394: Malibu 81.AE.62] with on one side Triptolemos between Demeter and Kore, and on the other, as Robertson has convincingly argued, Dionysos and IkarioS.13 The two themes, the introduction of grain and agriculture on the one hand, and wine and viticulture on the other, go well together. 14 The Ikarios scene appears to have included a sacrifice: there remains a raised hand holding a machaira, pointing downwards, and probably part of the animal's back. Also in the Dionysiac sphere belongs a fragment of a late fifth century Attic krater from the Athenian Kerameikos [V142: Athens Ker. 5662]. It was found in Building Z, which according to the excavators may have been, at least in the fourth century, a brothel. 15 What is left of the picture shows a woman wearing a maenad's fawn-skin, holding a knife in her right hand, point down, and with her left restraining a white painted goat. Knigge interprets this as the customary sacrifice of a white goat to Aphro-dite Pandemos by a hetaira, which is mentioned by Loukianos. 16 3.3. LARGE ANIMALS On a Corinthian alabastron of the first quarter of the sixth century B. C. , a bearded man swings a double axe over the head of a huge bull [Fig. 113, V 148: Berlin inv. 3419]. There is no explicit indication that a sacrifice is involved, but it can hardly be anything else. A Caeretan hydria of the last quarter of the same century is more interesting [Fig. 114, V120: Copenhagen NM 13567]. On the left is a blazing altar; a column surmounted by a votive disk or lebes stands next to it. From the right approach a bovine animal whose sex is not indicated, two men and two women. The man in front, on the further side of the head of the ox, holds a double axe with both hands; his head and body are missing. He is followed by a man carrying a lebes (possibly intended as 13 Robertson, in: Greek Vases Getty Mus. 3 (1986) 71-90. 14 Cf.

Then come a kanephoros (the kanOlln contains a white substance) and a female pipe-player. We might interpret the scene as a sacrificial procession, but then we would rather expect the kanephoros to walk in front, and furthermore the axe-bearer holds his axe in a rather peculiar way. It seems more likely that the vase painter meant us to see the axe on the down-swing, just before it hits the bent head of the OX.17 Since at that moment the kanephoros would no longer be carrying the basket on her head, we have to assume that the vase painter conflated different moments of the ceremony into one picture. Apart from one aspect which will be discussed in the next section, this is the extent of the iconographical evidence regarding the killing of bovine victims, as far as Archaic and Classical Greece is concerned. That there was more to it than hitting the animal with an axe, is clear from some well known sacrificial scenes in Homer. In the third book of the Odyssey, first one of Nestor' s sons knocks down the bull by hitting its neck with an axe. And after that, they raise it (whether the entire animal or just its head, is not clear from the text) from the ground and hold it up so that another of his sons can cut its throat, and let its blood flow. 18 In the first book of the Iliad the phrase uu£pu(Juv ... !CUt £(J(pu~uv is used, and the scholion explains uu£pu(Juv as bending back the neck. 19 What this seems to come down to, is a procedure in two stages: first the animal is knocked down with the axe; then its head is drawn back and its throat is slit with the knife. We may assume that much of the Homeric method remained in use in later times. Roughly the same two stages are found in later East Greek votive reliefs (though we miss Homer' s \"bending back of the neck\") . These reliefs, mainly from the general area of Kyzikos and Byzantion, and 17 Thus Durand, in: Detienne & Vernant (eds.) 1979, 177-8; Hemelrijk 1984, 29-30. 18 Homer, Odyssey 3,442-3: nEAEICuv lie I!EVEn'tOAElI.Ot; 8pUOUI!\"Ii11t; o~UV exwv i:v XElpt nupio'tu'to, ~OUV EntICOIjIWV' 448-450: 453-5 : u1l'tiICU NEO'tOPOt; uiot;, unEp9ul!0t; 8puOUI!,,011t;, ijAuOEV a.YXt o'tat;· nEAEICUt; 0' unEICOIjIE 'tEVOV'tUt; uUXEviout;, AUOEV oe ~OOt; I!EVOt;· oi I!Ev enEt't' UVEAOV'tEt; uno X90vot; EUPUOOEi 11t; eoxov' u'tap ocpa~Ev OEtoio'tpu'tot;, 0PXUI!Ot; uvopiilv.

THE KILLING 109 ranging from the third or second century B. C . to the second or third century A.D., offer some surprisingly explicit representations of the killing of a bovine victim, and, although they fall outside the chronologi-cal scope of this study, they are close enough in time and cultural sphere to merit some attention. On a votive relief to Zeus Olbios, one man holds a rope, which is tied to the horns of the bull and passed through a ring at the base of the altar, while another man holds the axe ready. 20 On another votive relief from the same sanctuary the action has advanced just a little: the bull is tied to the altar ring, and a man swings his axe to hit it.2 1 Several other votive reliefs show the animal, which again may be tied to the ring at the base of the altar, being stabbed in the neck with a long knife.22 In these latter representations the bull has often partly collapsed, its forelegs having given way, which indicates, I think, that it has been stunned by the axe before. 3.4. THE BUTCHERS WHO LAUGHED AT STENGEL Few scholars in the field of ancient Greek sacrifice have enjoyed such unchallenged authority for such a prolonged period, as the butchers of the Berlin slaughterhouse who laughed at Stengel, when he inquired about the feasibility of lifting up adult live cows onto the shoulders and then kill them.23 The reason for his query was, that there appears to be some textual evidence pointing to this practice. 20 Berlin inv. 1686: Robert, OpMinSel II l343 f. pI. 28. 21 Istanbul 1909: Mendel nr. 836; Edhem Bey, BCH 32 (1908) 521 ff., pI. 5-6; Robert, Hellenica 10 (1955) 45. 22 Bursa 2618: Schwertheim, IKyzikos II (1983) 5 nr. 3 , fig. 6. -Bursa 2584: Schwertheim, Ibid. 24 nr. 20, fig. 19. -Bursa 3160: Schwertheim, Ibid. 27 nr. 23, fig. 2l. -Istanbul inv. 189: Mendel nr. 854; Robert, Hellenica 10 (1955) 126. -Istanbul, Mendel nr. 1144. -Istanbul inv. 4407: Robert, Hellenica 10 (1955) 125 nr. 25, pI. 19, 3 and 38,2. -Istanbul inv. 5287: Annual Arch.

In Euripides' Helena, a messenger reporting to the king of Egypt about the departure of Menelaos, tells how a bull for sacrifice refused to board the ship, whereupon Menelaos shouted: \"Come on, you sackers of Troy, pick up that bull Greek-fashion! Get your shoulders under him and heave him on board! ,,25 Here it has been ob-served, that in this context Menelaos is prepared to say, and the Egyptians to believe, that anything under the sun is a Greek custom.26 Moreover, strictly speaking both passages from Euripides do not refer to contempo-rary fifth century sacrificial practice. But Theophrastos has another useful Character for us, the Late-learner, who, among other things that are not fit for his age such as competing in a torch race, will throw off his cloak and lift up the bull to cut its throat, when he is invited to take part in a sacrifice at a Herakleion.27 The most straightforward texts, however, are some inscriptions refer-ring to the lifting up of bulls by Attic ephebes at Eleusinian festivals. 28 24 Euripides, Electra 813-4: Kiiocpa.1;' E1t' ro~CIlv ~OOXov ro~ ~pa.v XEPOtV O~OOE~. 25 Euripides, Helena 1559-1564: 6 0' 'EAEVlj~ 1tOOl~ EKUAEOEV' ro 1tEPOa.V·t£(; 'IAtou 1tOAlV, OUK Et' uva.p1tuoa.v·t£C; 'EAAl]VCIlV vO~qJ vEa.via.l~ ro~OlOl 'ta.UPElOV OE~a.~ E~ 1tp<!>pa.v E~~a.AEt'tE, cpuoya.vov 6' ii~a. 1tPOXElPOV roOEl ocpuyta.

THE KILLING 111 The inscriptions date from the late second and early first century B.C., but that is not important in this case, for if it could be done then, it could be done earlier. And there is, in fact, an inscription dated at 4211420 B.C., having to do with the organisation of a festival in honour of Hephaistos, which also appears to mention (the text is sadly mutilated) the lifting up of bulls by 200 men that the hieropoioi had to elect from the Athenian citizenry.29 Finally, Pausanias mentions the ritual carrying of a bull at the sanctuary of Dionysos in Arcadian Kynaitha.30 These texts were well known, of course, to Stengel. But the derision of the Berlin butchers induced him to interpret ulpea8m. 'tou~ ~ou~ in all these cases as \"lifting up the head of the animal, after it had been knocked down, to expose its throat to the knife.\" One wonders what he would have made of a vase painting that became known only a few years ago [Fig. 115, V141: Viterbo].31 It is on an Attic black figure amphora of the third quarter of the sixth century B. C., and it shows how seven bearded men, all naked, have lifted a bull high in the air, literally putting their shoulders under it. Two more men help to hold the animal steady, one on the right by a rope tied to its head, the other on the left by its tail. A bearded man wearing a short chiton plunges the knife into the throat of the victim from below, while a youth holds a wide basin, the sphageion, underneath to catch the blood, at the same time with his right hand helping to raise the head of the bull. Another vase painting belongs here too. One side of a red figure kylix of C. 500 B.C. [Fig. 116, V145: Florence 81600] shows some young men grappling with a bull. \"Die Epheben zwingen den Opferstier auf die Knie,\" was what Rumpf saw. 32 But that is not at all what they look like IG If 1028, 10-11: ijpa.v'to OE Ka.l 'tOt~ ~uo'tljpiot~ 'toi>~ Ilou~ I EV 'EAEUOtVl 'tfil 6uoia.l KUl a.il'tol Ellou6u'tljoa.v EV 'tOOl 1tEplIlOACIll 'tou tEPOU.

They are trying to get a hold on the animal to lift it up (one of them already has firmly gripped its tail, as in the previous picture). On the left is a youth in a loincloth, whetting the sacrificial knife. What we have here, is the scene immediately preceding the one on the black figure amphora. The rest of the decoration of this kylix may give us a clue as to the occasion of this sacrifice. On the outside, the reverse shows youths holding whips leading horses, one on horseback, and a trumpeter: obvi-ously preparations for a horse race. The inside tondo has Hephaistos sitting in a winged wheelchair, surely of his own making. He may have borrowed the idea from Triptolemos, but he has reworked the thing into a nicely original design.33 It seems hard to escape the conclusion, that the vase painter has intended the decoration of this kylix as a coherent whole, the pictures on the outside illustrating a festival in honour of Hephaistos, who is depicted on the inside. This brings us back to the mutilated inscrip-tion of 4211420 B.C. , recording the lifting of bulls as a feature of a festival in honour of Hephaistos. 34 Note, however, that on the Florence kylix the bull lifters are beardless youths, probably ephebes, whereas in the inscription they are selected from amongst the Athenians (£~ 'A81lvatrov, i.e. probably the adult male citizens). On the Viterbo amphora the bearded bull lifters are clearly adult men.35 In the Hellenistic inscriptions, on the other hand, bull lifting is typically an ephebic activity, and the context of Theophrastos' passage on the Late-learner suggests that the bull lifters at the Herakleion, which he refers to, would normally also have been young men, as is appropriate anyway, in view of Herakles' connections with the Attic ephebes.36 A lost vase from the Hamilton collections had a picture of three ephebes manhan-dling a bull, not in a religious but in an athletic setting.37 Durand points out that one of these young men, putting his shoulders under the bull's 33 For Triptolemos see Schwarz 1987, and on his \" chariot\" especially Hayashi 1992, 30-67. 34 See above note 29. It is interesting to note that both in the inscription and on the Florence kylix a trumpet is played; too much should not be made of that, though, since the use of trumpets was not restricted to this festival: cf. Aristophanes, Acharnenses 1001. 35 Cf. the iiv15pE<; running the av15piilv <J'ta15lOv on the reverse of the Panathenaic amphora New York MMA 1978.11.13: Neils 1992,42 fig. 27. 36 Van Straten, BABesch 54 (1979) 189-191. 37 Tischbein 1791-95, II pI. 3; Reinach 1891, II 88, pI. 78, 8. THE KILLING 113 head, is closely reminiscent of Herakles wrestling the bull on another Attic red figure vase.38 There is no good reason to doubt it: strong Greek men or youths, hindered perhaps by the occasional Late-learner, would lift a bovine victim onto their shoulders in order to have its throat cut. This does not mean that it was the usual practice. It seems more likely that this demon-stration of strength was reserved for special festive occasions. Further-more, we should not forget that the size of domestic cattle in various ages and regions has been far from constant. The average archaic-classical Attic cow may well have been significantly smaller than the cattle that grace our Friesian meadows. 39 Nor should we entirely exclude the possi-bility, that the animal would be stunned by a blow before being lifted up. 3.5. HUMAN SACRIFICE \"The Greeks clearly preferred the fiction of human sacrifice to its reality,\" Henrichs wrote,40 and this nicely sums up the iconographical situation as well. Apart, perhaps, from one vase painting, which is better left as an unexplained subject,41 the only human sacrifices depicted are mythical. 38 Durand, in: Berard et ai. (eds.) 1987, 236.

[V395: Kiel B 538]. Both pictures antedate Euripides' treatment of the subject, and Iphigeneia seems to go less willingly to the altar on the vases than Euripides has her.43 An Apulian volute krater dated c. 370/340 B.C. has the most interesting picture [Fig. 117, V397: London F 159]. While a bearded man at the altar holds the knife ready for the killing, we witness the exact moment that a hind takes Iphigeneia's place.44 Representations of the sacrifice of Polyxena are a little less rare. Usually we see Neoptolemos, sword in hand, leading Polyxena by the wrist towards Achilles' tomb. On an Attic black figure amphora of the \"Tyrrhenian Group\", however, the actual moment of killing is depicted [Fig. 118, V422: London 97.7-27.2]. Three warriors, named as Amphi-lochos, Antiphates and Aias (O)iliades, have lifted the girl up and hold her over an altar, on which firewood and a burning fire are indicated.45 Neo-ptolemos plunges his sword into her throat, and the blood flows onto the altar. Nestor Pylios, Diomedes, and Phoinix are also present.46 The same scene may have been painted as early as the second quarter of the seventh century B. C., on a Protoattic krater, of which only fragments survive [V420: Boston 6.67] (though here the victim may be Iphigeneia).47 We encounter it once more, round the middle of the fifth century B.C., on a Campanian black figure amphora [V426: London B 70].48 42 Kahil, Iphigeneia, LlMC V (1992) 706-729, esp. 708-710. See also Masaracchia, QuadUrbin N.S. 14 (1983) 43-77. 43 Euripides, Iphigenia Aulidensis (406 B.C.), 1553 ff. 44 Cf. [Euripides], Iphigenia Aulidensis 1578 ff. 45 Iphigeneia too, according to Aischylos, Agamemnon 231 ff.; Euripides, Electra 1022; Iphigenia Taurica 26 f., was lifted up and held over the altar (though she is not so depicted in the surviving vase paintings, unless [V420: Boston 6.67] belongs here: see below). 46 For the inscriptions see Immerwahr 1990, 41 nr. 175. 47 Vermeule & Chapman, AlA 75 (1971) 285-293, opt for Polyxena; Kahil, Iphi-geneia, LlMC V (1992) 709 nr. 2, has a slight preference for Iphigeneia. 48 A related type of human sacrifice, the slaughtering of Trojans at Patroklos' pyre, is depicted on an Apulian vase [V414: Naples 3254]; cf. Iliad 23,175-176. CHAPTER FOUR POST-KILL Depending on the type of sacrifice, after the killing the animal would either be burnt whole or discarded in some other way (e.g. thrown into the sea) without any part of it being eaten by humans, or it would be cut up and the various parts of the carcass would be divided among and con-sumed by the divine and human participants in the ritual. I As was noted earlier, sacrifices of the first type, ho16kausta or thysiai ageustoi, are only very rarely depicted. We will come back to them later. Almost all the iconographical material we have for the post-kill phase (vase paintings constitute the overwhelming majority) clearly refers to the second type of sacrifice. As we shall see, it offered the vase painters much more scope for a variety of motifs, and often had the additional attraction of being followed by a festive meal. Inevitably, then, most of what follows deals with sacrifices at which part of the animal was destined for human con-sumption. 4. 1. OPENING UP THE CARCASS At the killing, as we have seen, the blood of the animal was, directly or by way of the sphageion, poured over the altar. We will now look at some vase paintings which illustrate what happened next with the carcass.2 They all show medium-sized animals (sheep, goat, pig). A peculiar Attic janiform kantharos of c. 475/450 B.C. is formed of heads of Dionysos and a satyr [Fig. 119, V152: Ferrara T 256 b VP]. Above the heads are red figure pictures: Dionysos reclining, holding a kantharos, and with an amphora at his feet, above Dionysos' head, and the cutting up of a carcass on the side of the satyr's head. The carcass of a he-goat is stretched out on a table, feet in the air. At the head of the animal (on the left) a man in a short chiton, patterned loin-cloth, and shoes (working garb) stoops over it, busy with a knife. On the right a boy, I Nilsson 1967, 132 ff.; Burkert, in: Le Sacrifice dans I'Antiquite (1981) 91-125. See Introduction 1.1. 2 On the technical points of butchery, Durand, in: Detienne & Verant (eds.) 1979 and Berthiaume 1982 are especially useful."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"116 CHAPTER FOUR naked but for his shoes, holds the two hind legs of the goat. A basin in the shape of a bell-krater stands underneath the table, and above it hangs a knife case. The context suggests that the animal is sacrificed to Dionysos. An Attic black figure pelike of c. 500 B.C . shows the same operation being performed on a sheep [VI51: Paris, Fond. Custodia 3650]. In this picture the hind legs are held by a bearded man, and underneath the table is a calyx-krater. The problem with this picture, and with the next one, is, that there is no explicit indication that the animal is a sacrificial victim. We might assume that it is being slaughtered for human consumption only, but that would probably be an anachronistic way of looking at it. There are good reasons to believe that the Greeks derived virtually all their meat (apart from game) from the ritual of sacrifice. 3 It is, therefore, fairly safe to include all depictions of butchery among the sacrificial representations. An Attic black figure picture on a fragment of a pyxis, c. 530 B.C. [Fig. 120, V150: Bonn 62], takes the procedure one step further. There are now two assistants, one pulling the forelegs forward and the other pulling the hind legs backward, thus stretching the animal on the table (a goat, in this case), while the butcher makes a downward incision in its breast, opening up the thoracic (and abdominal?) cavity. An Attic black figure skyphos of c. 500 B.C. shows Herakles cutting up a sheep [V379: Athens NM 12626]. On the right is a herm, and a kanoun stands on its base, so the sacrificial context is clear, though it is hard to see which myth exactly is meant. Herakles does without a table. The sheep lies on its back on the ground, and Herakles clasps its hind legs between his thighs, while making the same incision as on the previous picture. At the head of the animal is a female figure who may be helping, but too much of the vase is lost to be sure (Athena?). A red figure cup-skyphos of the second quarter of the fifth century again takes us one step further [Fig. 121, V153: Warsaw 142464]. A bearded man and a youthful assistant, both with their himation wrapped round their middle to leave the arms free, are busy with a goat. The animal is stretched out on a table. The youth pulls the hind legs back-wards, while the man, standing at the head, has inserted his right arm up to the elbow into the thoracic cavity, presumably to remove the inner organs. The subject on the other side of this cup-skyphos is clearly related: a bearded man pours a libation at a blazing altar, while a youth holds something on a spit in the altar fire. 3 Jameson, in : Whittaker (ed.) 1988,87. See also Berthiaume 1982, 81 ff. POST-KILL 117 Part of the picture on the \"Ricci hydria\" also belongs in the present series [Fig. 122, V154: Rome VG]. This black figure hydria from Cerve-teri, which deservedly occupies a place of honour in any study on ancient Greek sacrifice, has been attributed to an East Greek vase painter working in Etruria in the last quarter of the sixth century B.C .4 On the shoulder a uniquely elaborate sacrificial scene is painted, framed by vines. The centre is occupied by an altar, on which a fire bums; the point of a thin black object projects above the flames. Three youths hold bits skewered on spits over the fire. From the left a man holding a cup approaches the altar, followed by a pipe-player and a youth carrying an oinochoe and a plate. Further on the left, five young men are working on the carcasses of two animals. On the far left, a pig lies on its back on the ground; a stone or something is shoved under its shoulders, and one man holds up its front-legs while another man, standing at the head, is about to make the inci-sion. The second animal is a goat, stretched out and held suspended by its hind and forelegs by two men, while a third holds the knife ready to cut. Hanging from the vine above the figures on the left of the altar are half a sheep (lacking the hind quarter), and two separate legs. The things that are going on to the right of the altar will be dealt with in a later section. An Attic black figure column-krater of roughly the same period has a sacrificial scene at a herm [Fig. 123, V160: London B 362]. On the altar a huge fire blazes, and in the fire, placed on the altar, a thin elongated curved object can be discerned. Above it, something on a spit is held in the fire by a man standing on the left of the altar. At his feet on, the ground, is a kanoun. Behind him, a man is busy with a knife at a table. The cutting up of the animal has now reached an advanced stage: two separate legs hang above the table, underneath it is the head (a goat's head), and on it some unidentifiable part of the carcass. What we have learned from this series of pictures is, that after the killing the thoracic (and abdominal?) cavity of the carcass is rather care-fully opened up with a lengthwise incision, and that some of the inner organs are extracted.5 At some point the hind quarters, and the hind legs separately, are cut off. By the time the cutting up of the animal has 4 Cook & Hemelrijk, JbBerlMus 5 (1963) 114; Hemelrijk 1984, 186. 5 This operation is also depicted on the reliefs of the north wall of the \"Heroon\" from Gjolbashi (Trysa, Lycia): Eichler 1950, pI. 25.

CURLY THINGS AND BITS ON SPITS6 A whole series of vase paintings (and one or two other representations) is defmed by the common element of the thin elongated object on the altar curving upwards in the fire, and mostly associated with portions skewere~ on spits, roasted in the same fire. Sometimes the thin object is subdivided ~y tiny ~ross-strokes, and at least in one instance, something rather plump lIes besIde the thin curving object on the carefully arranged firewood on the altar [Fig. 124, V367: London E 494]. This detailed representation is found on an, unfortunately very incomplete, Attic red figure bell-krater of the third quarter of the fifth century B.C. It depicts the mythical sacrifice of Herakles to Chryse, earlier stages of which we saw in a previous chapter: T.he a~chaic cult image and the rustic altar built of rough stones are agam m eVIdence, and in addition there is a tree with votive pinakes hanging from its branches. How should we identify the thin object and the portions on the spits? The l~tter are usually interpreted as the sptanchna, though they are sometImes loosely referred to as pieces of meat or entrails. 7 The thin c~rved o~ject was identified almost a century ago by Furtwangler as the tall, or tall plus sacrum, of the victim.8 Several scholars have followed Furtwangler's interpretation.9 Other eminent authorities in the field of ancient Greek iconography disagreed. Zancani Montuoro took it to be a goat's horn. 10 Metzger suggested that it might be a sort of grill. I I And recently Erika Simon stated that these thin curved objects were the tongues 6 An earlier version of this chapter was presented as a paper at the Fifth International Symposium at the Swedish Institute at Athens, 26-29 June 1986, see Hagg et al.

POST-KILL 1.19 of victims, for, she claims, the ancient sources never mention that the tail of the animal was burnt for the gods. 12 Perhaps it is necessary to look into the matter a little more systematically. First of all, the bits on spits and the curly object never occur in sacrifi-cial representations of the pre-kill variety, i.e. together with a whole live animal. This, and the series of pictures studied in the previous section, confirms that they are parts of the sacrificed animal. And since it is to be expected that the thin curly object in the altar fire afterwards will not be fit for human consumption by any standard, it may be taken as a portion destined for the god. At some point during the ceremony, it must have been placed on the altar. That moment is probably depicted on an Attic bell-krater of the late fifth century B.C. [Fig. 125, V19l: New York 41. 162.4]. Two young men stand at a blood-stained altar, on which the firewood is already burning. One of them holds a tray or platter decorated with three sprigs, of the type which in an earlier phase of the ritual we saw sometimes used as a kanoun. It contains a thin elongated object, painted white, the end of which does not curve upwards, but hangs down over the rim. The bits on spits are held ready by two other youths, at the far left and right of the scene, not yet at the altar. The same moment is captured in an earlier picture, on a bell-krater of c. 450/440 B.C. [Fig. 126, V178: Frankfurt B 413]. Again there is a strikingly regular pile of firewood burning on the altar, which also has impressive blood stains. A bearded man places a rather amorphous lump on the altar. He has proba-bly taken it from a kanoun-tray proffered by a small boy, which is deco-rated with the familiar three sprigs projecting from the rim, and contains a second similar lump. A youth carrying two spits approaches from the left; behind him there are another bearded man and a pipe-player who is not playing. To the right of the altar stands a column supporting a small cult image of Apollo. So apparently a thin part of the victim and more lumpy ones were placed on the altar, before the bits on spits were roasted in the fire. Now what are they? The thin elongated object, which is always seen curving upwards in the fire, has the more distinctive shape. Sometimes it does look like a goat's horn. Does that mean that Zancani Montuoro was right? 12 Simon, in: Kurtz & Sparkes (eds.) 1982, 125-9.

Secondly, it is not wise to try to identify the object by establishing what it looks like to us. We should not try to recognize it, taking the visible world as we know it as our frame of reference. The Greek vase painters painted these scenes with their contemporary compatriots in mind. It is their frame of reference we must try to reconstruct. To identify the thin curved object, we must find out, not merely what it looks like, but 'which of the parts of the victim that were regularly placed on the altar POST-KILL 121 and burned for the gods while other parts skewered on spits were roasted in the same fire' it looks like. Fortunately the Greeks themselves were rather preoccupied with the unfair distribution of sacrificial animals between gods and men.13 So there is a considerably body of texts on the subject, which at least go some way in helping us to reconstruct the proper frame of reference. Let us first return to the sacrificial scene in Aristophanes' Peace. We left Trygaios and his slave earlier at the point where they had completed the preliminary rites. Trygaios subsequently orders his slave to take the knife and slaughter the sheep like a professional mageiros. The slave, however, who seems to know a thing or two, objects that Eirene, contrary to the usual practice, does not appreciate slaughter and blood on her altar.14 Therefore the slave must kill the animal \"indoors\", that is back-stage (and thus, as Trygaios observes, the choregos will be spared the cost of a real sheep), and take out the thighbones and bring them back to Trygaios.15 Meanwhile Trygaios himself piles the firewood on the altar, drawing attention to the fact that he does that like a true mantis (i.e. like a professional priest versed in divinatory lore), and kindles it, and then goes and gets a table. 16 The slave returns and says: \"That's done. Take the thighbones and put them (on the altar). I'll go and get the splanchna and the thulemata. ,,17 And a bit later on, when he has returned with these 13 Puttkammer 1912; Stengel 1920,41,49, 117 f.; Burkert 1972, 13 ff. 14 Aristophanes, Pax 1019-20: DUX fjoE,at 0f]nou9Ev Eipf]vT] O(j)ayatt;, ouo' a\\}1a,o,\\hat j3ro}10t;. 15 Aristophanes, Pax 1021-22: 6.1,),: Elaro cptprov 9taat; ,u }1T]pi' E~EA<OV OEUP' tK:CPEpE.

These lines should not be attributed to Trygaios, as Van Leeuwen and Platnauer do, but to the slave, as indicated in the manuscripts. Thus the division of tasks between the sacrificer himself and his acolyte is in accordance with what we see in the vase paint-ings,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"I II I '/ 122 CHAPTER FOUR things, Trygaios says: \"Now roast them well. \"18 Then their activities are interfered with by the arrival of a certain Hierokies, a vagrant oracle-monger, or rather charlatan, who tries to impose his professional exper-tise, and shows a particular interest in those parts of the victim that, at a sacrifice where a priest officiated, would normally fall to the priest. He is not welcome. When Trygaios sees that the slave, by this interference, may be distracted from his task, he says: \"You, roast in silence, and keep away from the osphUs,\" and then he adds: \"The tail is doing beautifully. \"19 Some parts of this text may seem a little enigmatic, but fortunately they are clarified by some useful comments in the scholia, which are as fol-lows: \"From the osphus: Roast the splanchna on the altar in silence. He means keep your spit away from the os ph us, that is to say, be careful not to touch it. The tail is doing: The tail is giving good signs. For they were accustomed to place the osphus and the tail in the fire, and therefrom by certain signs to infer whether the sacrifice was well received. \"20 When the sphinchna on the spits are done, Trygaios says to the slave: \"Now pour wine (into a cup) for a libation and bring here some of the splanchna.\" Then, pouring a libation from the cup, Trygaios says a short prayer, and the audience is invited to share in the consumption of the splanchna.21 This text of Aristophanes is very instructive in various ways. On the one hand, it contains much useful information on sacrificial ritual. On the other hand, on closer scrutiny, we see that it is far from constituting a full and detailed record of the proceedings. There was no need for that. The poet would just hint at selected elements, and the audience, familiar with 18 Aristophanes, Pax 1043: on't<X IC<XAro~ V'IlV <xinu. 19 Aristophanes, Pax 1053-5: on't<X cru crlyjj ICU1t<XY' uno 'tij~ ocr<puo~.

POST-KILL 123 the ritual, would automatically fill in the rest. Thus, the slave is ordered to cut out the thighbones, and when he brings them, he tells Trygaios to put the thighbones on the altar. But further on we learn that there is also the osphfts on the altar, and the tail. That may surprise us, but it would not, if we had known (as surely the audience did) that these together normally constituted the god's portion. And there is another lesson in here: we should not be content to think that this now is the complete list; there may well have been other parts to the god's portion that Aristo-phanes found no reason to mention. We may hope to assemble a fuller list by studying the rest of the relevant literary texts, which we will now briefly survey in chronological order, but it is not at all certain that we will ever have the complete picture. In the Iliad and Odyssey first the thighbones are cut out for the gods; they are then wrapped in fat, and pieces of raw meat are placed on them. 22 From the swineherd's sacrifice in Odyssey 14, we learn that these pieces of raw meat are bits taken from each part of the body. 23 Hesiod, in telling about Prometheus' trick, the aetiological myth for the unfair distribution of sacrificial animals, speaks of white bones covered with shining fat. That the bones are qualified as white, indicates that they are just the bare bones, but Hesiod does not specify which ones.24 In Aischylos' Prometheus Bound (second quarter of the fifth century B.C.), Prometheus sets forth the various fields of divination he has taught mankind. One of these concerns the signs that are observed when the 22 Homer, Iliad 1, 460-463: I111POU~ 'to E~£'t<Xl1ov IC<X'tU 'tE ICVtcrn EICUA'IlIjI<Xv 15tn't'llX<X nOlf]cr<xv'tE~, En' <xinrov 15' roI10SE'tTlcr<xV.

Next come several passages from comedy. In Aristophanes' Peace, we already heard about thighbones, osphus, and tail. Elsewhere he mentions the thighbones lying on the altar/7 and the gods savouring the smell of the thighbones burning in the fat. 28 In the Acharnians we meet a Megarian flogging his daughters, dressed up as piglets, for sacrificial animals, but Dikaiopolis observes that they are not fit for sacrifice since they have no tails.29 25 Aischylos, Prometheus Vinctus 496-499: ICvion 'tE ICroAa 01lYICaAlllt'ta ICal. llaICPo.v ooq>uv ltllprooae; 151l0'tEICllap'tov Ee; 'tElVllV ml5rooa 6Vll'tOUe; ICal. cpAoyrolta oT]lla'ta E~rollllo.'trooa ltP006EV QV't' Elto.PYElla. 26 Sophokles, Antigone 1005-1011: EU6ue; 15£ I5Eioae; EllltUProv EYEllOIl llV ~rollOlOl ltallq>AEIC'toIOI V' EIC I5E 61lllo.'trov \"Hq>alo'tOe; OUIC EAallltEv. aAA' Eltl. oltol5iil 1l1l15rooa IClllCl.e; ll11pirov hT]ICE'tO ICii'tllq>E ICUVElt'tllE.

In another fragment of Euboulos, largely obscured by mutilation, we learn that the fat we heard about in other texts is more precisely the epip6laion or epiploon, i.e. the omentum,32 regarding which Aristotle has the following information: \"The omentum is a membrane, formed of suet or lard accord-ing to the animal in which it is. (We have already stated which animals contain suet and which lard.) Whether the animal has one stomach or many, the omentum is always fastened to the middle of the stomach, on the line marked on it like a seam; and it covers the rest of the stomach and most of the intestines. ,,33 30 Clemens Alex., Strom. 7, 30, 3 (p. 846): 0 YE ICrolltICOe; EICElvoe; ct>EPEICpo.'tlle; EV Au'tOIlOAOle; XaptEV'troe; aU'toue; ltEltoilllCE 'toue; 6Ebue; ICa'taIlEIlq>oIlEVOlle; 'tOle; uv6pro-ltOle; 'trov iEprov' (Pherekrates fr. 28 Kassel-Austin = 23 Kock): o 'tl 'tOlOl 6Eole; 6UE'tE, ltprono't' ultolCpi VE'tE - - - - -'to VOlll~OIlEVOV tullrov atoxuvll1' 'tro ICed EtltElvt E\\> 'tW Il11Pro ltEptAE'IIav'tEe; (ICOllll5fil) IlEXPl ~Oll~rovrov - - - -ICal.

They bring in beds, wine by the cask-for their own pleasure, not the gods'. A bit of incense makes a pious gift, or a cake; you offer it in one piece on the altar, and it all goes to the god. Those gentry there offer the gods the inedible scraps-the extreme part of the osphus and the gall bladder-and guzzle down all the rest themselves. \"34 Another comic poet put it yet more strongly: the god's portion was not just inedible by human standards; even hungry dogs would not have it. 35 The main points are assembled in the table below. What the gods get are mainly inedible parts: thighbones (just the bare bones, that is, which have been cut out, and are characterized as \"white\" and \"without flesh\"), wrapped in fat (more precisely the omentum); the osphds (also absolutely bare) and tail; and the gall bladder. Incidentally, such a tabulation of data may be as misleading as it is neat. One gets the impression that the only edible part the gods received in Homer, the pieces of raw meat indicated by the verb roI108£'\"C£tV, were later withheld from them. This impression, however, may be wrong. In many of the literary testimonia after Homer, especially in comedy, the point is precisely the meagreness of the god's portion.36 This literary cliche may well have generated a sort of self-fulfilling selectivity. Cult practice was probably less uniform. In any case, there is epi-graphical evidence for pieces of meat being laid on the altar, together with the thighbones. 34 Menander, Dyscolus (316 B.C.) 447-453: OOC; 8uouot o· Ot 'tOtxropuXOt· KOI'tCXC; CPEPOV'tCXt, O'tCX~Vl', ouxi 'trov 9Erov EVEK' aU' ECXU'trov. <'> At[3CXVro'tOC; EuoE[3ee; KCXt 'to 1tOltCXVOV' 'tou't' €A,cx[3EV <'> 8EOC; Eltt 'to ltUP iiltCXV Eltt'tESEv.

On the scale of the average vase painting, we can hardly expect an unmistakably distinctive depiction of such rather amorphous shapes. And the same goes for the gall bladder. It has been argued that the gall bladder is depicted on an interest-ing Attic calyx-krater in the Hermitage, dated to the third quarter of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 127, V204: Saint Petersburg 1658]. Three bearded men on the left, one seated and two standing, watch a scene of sacrifice. On the right is an altar on which firewood and fire are indicated. Behind the altar stands a youth holding a tray-shaped kanoiin decorated with three sprigs, and containing a flat rectangular object. A boy, standing on the right, holds a spit over the altar. To the left of the altar, on its projecting base, stands a bearded man, who holds a smallish roundish object in his right hand over the altar. Jameson's interpretation of this object as an ox's gall bladder, being squeezed by the officiant, to squirt bile into the fire for divinatory purposes, is attractive.39 There seems to be no real objection to it , apart from the fact that the shape of the object is not distinctive enough to make the interpretation anything more than possible. Here too, it might just be a piece of meat. Osphus But before we return to the vase paintings depicting the god's portion, we first have to establish what exactly, in this context, the word osphiis refers to. Since it may be specified, like the thighbones, as absolutely bare, it must be part of the skeleton. But which part is it? Careful study of the word in ancient medical and anatomical literature and lexica shows that it was used in slightly varying senses. It may stand for the whole pelvic girdle, comprising the sacrum and the ossa innominata.40 Or, alterna-tively, it may indicate the extreme posterior part of the spine, that is the tail and the sacrum, with or without the lumbar vertebrae.41 In short, one 39 J .

On a krater in New York, we have seen it hanging limply over the rim of the kanoun-tray in which it is brought to the altar [VI91: New York 4l.162.4], but usually it is seen curling up in the heat of the altar fire, as an animal tail will do when properly placed.44 In three vase paintings, probably inspired by a satyr-play, this part of the god's portion is shown in yet another context.45 Iris, who apparently was sent by the other gods to collect their portion of the sacrifices from the altars, is seen holding the tail in her hand while being molested by satyrs.46 On a kylix by the Brygos Painter [Fig. 128, V402: London E 65], the tail has a slightly broader piece at the lower end, which must be the sacrum. In another, somewhat later, picture of the same incident, on the tail held by Iris the separate caudal vertebrae are again indicated by tiny cross-strokes [Fig. 129, V400: Berlin F 2591].47 Some real bones Valuable new information has become available by Reese's recent careful study of the remains of burnt animal bones, found in the fill within the monumental altar on the north side of the Athenian Agora.48 The altar, attributed to Aphrodite Ourania, was first built about 500 B.C., damaged (perhaps by the Persians in 480 B.C.), and eventually repaired c. 430/420 tEpOUPYEt'tCll 'tOt<; 6£Ot<;.

Riezler 1914, 8 fig. 7, saw another Iris with osphCts on the Attic white ground lekythos Munich 2776; comparison, however, with the Erinys handling snakes on the lekythos in the collection Ludwig, Berger & Lullies (eds.) I, 1979, 164 nr. 60, rather seems to favour a similar interpretation for the figure on the Munich lekythos. 48 Reese, Hesperia 58 (1989) 63-70; there is a very useful survey of other finds of burnt bones on altars or in sanctuaries at p. 69-70. The preliminary report on the Agora bones by Foster, Hesperia 53 (1984) 73-82, should be disregarded. POST-KILL 131 B.C. The fill contalllillg the animal bones may either have gradually gathered within the orthostates in the interval between the destruction ~d the repair, or may have been intentionally brought in when the repaIrs were undertaken. 49 Analysis has shown that by far the majority of the burnt bone frag-ments come from sheep and goat, and that (caudal) vertebrae and thigh-bones are particularly numerous. This would suggest that we have here mainly the remains of the god's portion burnt on the altar. Another observation by Reese is worth quoting: \"It is quite clear that the bones were burnt 'green', or flesh covered. Burning bones in this condition (as opposed to dry or defleshed bone) creates transverse fracture lines, cracking, checking, irregular longitudinal splitting, and marked warping or twisting. Such evidence is commonly seen on the bones from this altar. ,,50 Here, then, is another piece of evidence that the gods' portions were not always quite as bare as the comic poets would have us believe (unless the effect noted by Reese could also have been produced by the bones being burnt wrapped in the omentum). Splanchna The portions skewered on spits and roasted in the fire on the altar, while the god's portion is being burnt, were identified in the testimonia above as the spldnchna. A complete set of splanchna would include, according to Aristotle, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys.51 When the sphinchna were done, they were cut in pieces, distributed among those participating in the sacrifice, and immediately consumed on the spot, while still warm. 52 But not only the human participants ate a part of the sphinchna: the god, 49 T .L.

This is clear from two passages in Aristophanes. In the Birds, since the city in the clouds was built, the gods' portions of the sacrifices can no longer reach them. What they miss are, among other things, parts cut from the splanchna.53 And in a somewhat similar situation in the PLutus (the redis-tribution of wealth by Ploutos, who has regained his eyesight, has caused people to stop sacrificing to the gods), Hermes regretfully remembers the warm splanchna he used to gobble up. 54 How, in actual ritual, a portion of the sphinchna would be given to the god, is a matter of conjecture. It may have been thrown into the still burning fire on the altar. But in Aristophanes' Birds we are told of the custom of placing the splanchna literally in the hands of the gods.55 For this to be possible, there would have to be present a cult statue of the god such as Aristophanes describes elsewhere, with its hand outstretched, palm upwards, in an appropriately greedy fashion. 56 Outside Athens, a similar custom is attested in some leges sacrae from Chios. They mention \" splanchna into the hands\" or more often \"splanchna into the hands and onto the knees\" (which eventually would fall to the priest).57 The splanchna that were placed on the knees would require a seated cult 53 Aristophanes, Aves 1515 ff.: £I; 01l7tEP UI1Et<; 0Ktml'tE 'tOY aEpCl.

Many cult images held a phiale in the outstretched right hand, which would make a convenient receptacle for the \"splanchna into the hands. ,,58 On a very battered fragment of a votive relief from the Athenian Askiepieion, one worshipper, according to Svoronos' description, puts something into the phiale that the seated goddess holds in her hand. 59 If this description is correct, we might have a unique picture here of such a deposition of the splanchna, but the deplorable condition of the relief makes it impossible to be certain. Between the goddess and the worshipper there appear to be slight traces of a thymiaterion, so perhaps the worship-per is putting incense in the bowl of this thurible. Osphus and splanchna Now that we are familiar with the main elements of the ritual at the altar after the killing of the victim, i.e. the god' s portion and the splanchna, we may return briefly to some of the vase paintings described in the previous section. It is now clear that the lengthwise incision made in the animal stretched out on its back, had the purpose of making the extraction of the splanchna possible, as is particularly clearly illustrated on the cup-skyphos in Warsaw [VI53: Warsaw 142464]. On the Ricci hydria [VI54: Rome VG] we saw half a sheep hanging from the vines; its hind quarter is missing, as a result of the cutting out of the osphus and the thighbones. The two separated legs, also hanging from the vines, recur on an Attic krater [V160: London B 362]: they are the two hind legs with the thigh-bones removed. Both the Ricci hydria and the London krater belong to the series depicting the osphUs being burnt on the altar while the splanchna are being roasted. We shall now look in a little more detail at the representations which have one or both of these two components. The osphus with the tail curving upwards is depicted in something over 30 representations, mostly (in about two thirds of the cases) together with the splanchna on spits. Representations of splanchna without osphUs are about twice as numerous as those depicting osphUs without splanchna. Almost all the relevant pictures are found on vases, with two exceptions: 58 E.g. Attic red figure squat lekythos Oxford 1966.714, ARV2 1325/51: manner of the Meidias Painter; Beazley Gifts (1967) nr. 277; LIMe II Aphrodite 44. 59 Athens NM 1368: Svoronos 287, pI. 45, 3; Einzelaujnahmen 1233; Hausmann 1948, 176 nr. 124."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"I I 134 CHAPTER FOUR a terracotta votive relief from Locri Epizephyrii of c. 475/450 B.C., 60 and a marble votive relief from Rhamnous with a rather doubtful osphus [R47: Rhamnous 102]. The vase paintings range from the second half of the sixth to the early fourth century B.C. The shape of the osphus varies within reasonably narrow bounds. Basically it is a thin elongated object, with one end curving upwards like the crook of a walking-stick or a shepherd's staff; sometimes the curve is slightly S-shaped. Variations in the rendering might in principle indicate different species of animals, but on the whole, I think, they should rather be attributed to the idiosyncrasies of the various vase painters. Not surprisingly the two earliest representa-tions are least canonical: on the black figure London krater [V160:London B 362] the osphUs forms a rather large loop; on the Ricci hydria [V154: Rome VG] only the end projecting above the sacrificial fire is shown. It is interesting that in a considerable majority of the representations the carefully arranged firewood is conspicuous, reminding us of the impor-tance attached to this point by Trygaios in Aristophanes' Peace. 61 Several vase paintings give a sort of synopsis of the various elements that played a part in the osphus-sphlncbna phase of the ritual, as we encountered them in that comedy. Two Attic red figure stamnoi, probably from the same workshop (they are attributed to Polygnotos and his group, respectively), and painted perhaps ten or twenty years before Aristo-phanes' Peace, have very similar compositions [Fig. 130, V185: London E 455; Fig. 131, V186: London E 456]. To the left of the altar, on which the osphUs is clearly visible on the burning firewood, stands a bearded man, who raises his left hand in prayer. He is about to make a libation with a cup he holds in his right hand, and into which a Nike hovering above the altar pours from an oinochoe (restored on E 455). On the right are two naked young splancbn6ptai. One holds his spit in the fire (almost touching the upward curving end of the osphUs, which he should not do, as Trygaios warned his slave); the other one, behind him, is not roasting, for the moment, and holds his spit upright. On the far right is a young man playing the auloi. Trygaios had managed to do without a pipe-player, but otherwise we are on familiar ground: splancbna being roasted while the osphUs is burnt on the carefully arranged firewood, libation and 60 Reggio (Cal.)

POST-KILL 135 prayer.62 On one of the London stamnoi, the name of the bearded officiant is inscribed as Archenautes [V 185: London E 455],63 on the other one he is called Diomedes [V186: London E 456]. A third stamnos, attributed to Polygnotos, again has Diomedes as sacrificer [Fig. 132, V179: Gotha 51].64 There are some differences with the London stamnos: Diomedes holds a phia1e instead of a kylix; there is only one splancbn6ptes, wearing a loin-cloth and crouching on the left of the altar, in front of the officiant; and on the right the recipient of the sacrifice, Apollo (also with his name inscribed) is depicted, holding a lyre. The fact that in all three pictures Nike performs part of the tasks of the acolytes would suggest that these sacrifices were offered on the occasion of some victory. About half a century earlier, within the limited compass of the inside tondo ofa ky1ix by Makron [Fig. 133, V198: Palermo V 661 a], the main components are already there. The officiant is characterized as a priest by his long ornate robe.65 He raises his left hand in the direction of the altar, where the osphUs bums in the fire, and holds a kantharos for libation in his right hand. The splancbn6ptes here rather exceptionally is a bearded man in a loin-cloth, squatting next to the priest. Still earlier, in the late sixth century B. C., a similar iconography is used for a mythical sacrifice [Fig. 134, V381: Berlin inv. 3232]. Hera-kles, who has donned a sacerdotal robe over his lion-skin, pours a libation from a kantharos onto the altar, raising his left hand. A satyr acts as splancbn6ptes. We do not know, which of Herakles' many adventures occasioned this sacrifice, but there may be a connection intended with the picture on the outside of the same kylix, showing Herakles preceded by 62 Osphus, spi<inchna, libation and gesture of prayer or presentation are combined on [V381: Berlin inv. 3232; V198: Palermo V 661 a; V185: London E 455; Gotha 51; V186: London E 456; V165: Athens NM 14501; V171: Catania 9.418; V199: Paris Louvre G 402; V182: Laon 37.1041; V203: Ruvo 1093; V187: London E 504]. 63 On London E 455, in addition to the name 'Apx£va.{n'll~ written above the head of the sacrificer, there are also the names NtKOO'llI!O~ (which may belong to one of the splanchn6ptai) and LocrtFo~ (? miswritten) next to the pipe-player.

The inscriptions on Gotha 51 are ~tol!£o£~ above the sacrificer, ['IloA£o~ (?) above the splanchn6ptes, and 'A1tOAAOV above the god. The slight remains of letters over the Nike do not warrant the observation by Webster 1972, 51, that she is labelled [Pyth]ia; see E. Rohde at eVA Gotha 2 , pI. 56-8. Webster suggests a possible historical identifica-tion for Diomedes. 65 Mantes 1990."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"136 CHAPTER FOUR Hermes leading Kerberos out of the Underworld. The capture of Kerberos may also be the context of another representation of Herakles sacrificing, on an early fifth century black figure lekythos [Fig. 135, V380: New York 41.162.29]. In this case Herakles himself holds the spits with splanchna over the fire. The scene is situated at the end of the world by the presence of Night, Sun, and Dawn.66 The synoptic representations (osphUs, splanchna, libation, prayer) persist throughout the fifth century. On an oinochoe of the last quarter of that century the painter has succeeded in creating some depth in the representation [Fig. 136, V199: Paris Louvre G 402]. The altar and the firewood on it are rendered in perspective, and the osphus, painted in diluted glaze, is clearly distinguished amidst the flames, which are done in added white. There is another less successful attempt at perspective by the same painter [VI72: Copenhagen NM 4996]. The officiant, almost always a bearded man,67 usually raises his left hand in prayer. In some instances he points his opened left hand down-wards towards the altar and what is on it, in what is best understood as a gesture of presentation, well illustrated by a krater in London [Fig. 137, V187: London E 504].68 The god to whom the sacrifice is offered, is depicted or at least indi-cated in only a minority of the vase paintings of the present series. We already met Apollo once [R179: Gotha 52]. He may be hinted at by the presence of a tree, which may well be a laurel tree, on two pelikai by the Academy Painter [Fig. 138, V165: Athens NM 14501; Fig. 139, V171: Catania 9.418]. But he is again fully there, with laurel branch and lyre, on a krater at one time on the market in Basel [Fig. 140, V208: Art market]. This vase has a rather elaborate sacrificial scene, which, in addition to Apollo himself, comprises two tripods. There are two splanchn6ptai, and a youthful officiant pouring a libation. The altar is set on a high stepped base, and has an impressive pile of firewood. There is, however, no osphus to be seen.

POST-KILL 137 the other hand, at least in some cases it may originally have been there, painted on in added colour (as was sometimes done), which flakes off relatively easily and may leave no trace that is visible on a black and white photograph. 69 In one instance, the fmd circumstances may help us to determine, whom the sacrifice was meant for. In the dromos of the Mycenaean tholos tomb in Menidi (t\\chamai, Attika), ample evidence was found that this was the centre of a hero cult from the Late Geometric down to the Classi-cal period.70 The fmds include fragments of black and red figure vases with representations of sacrificial processions. 71 On one of two fragments of a red figure kantharos, a blood-stained altar is depicted, on which lies an osphUs; the other fragment preserves part of a kline and a table [Fig. 141, V162: Athens NM]. Since both the latter representation and the shape of the vase (kantharos) are singularly appropriate to the cult of a hero, it is perhaps not too farfetched to take this as a special commission, specifically decorated with a view to its lise in this cult. If this proposition is accepted, it constitutes interesting additional evidence for a hero sacri-fice wherein the worshippers shared the victim with the deity. 72 Another rather special vase, where the recipient deity may have been immediatdy clear to the contemporary Athenians, though less so to us, is a late fifth century krater in London [Fig. 142, V188: London BM 98.7-16.6]. It obviously celebrates a victory in a torch race.73 Two young men with the characteristic spiked headdress frame the picture on both sides. Next to an altar, with firewood burning and the osphUs vaguely visible in the flames, stands a third figure with the torch racer's headdress, holding the torch with which the fire on the altar must have been kindled. This one, however, is bearded, and he has the word ANTIOX inscribed on his head band. The inscription may be completed either as 'AvnoX(tC; sc . CPUA:it), referring to the tribe of the victorious torch racers, or more likely 'Av'ttoX(oC;), identifying the bearded man as the eponymous hero of that 69 Osphiis in added red or white: [VI74: Dijon 1223; V190: Naples 127 929; V188: London 98.7-16.6]. 70 Wolters, JdI 14 (1899) 103 ff.

To the right of the altar stands an old white-haired man leaning on a staff.75 The vase is signed on the foot by the potter Nikias son of Hermokles from the deme Anaphlystos (from whom Beazley has named the vase painter Nikias Painter). 76 Anaphlystos belonged to the victorious tribe Antiochis, and there can be little doubt that a real historical victory of the potter's tribe inspired this vase painting. We have seen that in the pre-kill sacrificial scenes, sacrifices at herms were relatively popular, and we have argued that many of these herms may be little more than a rather general indication of the setting. In the present series of post-kill sacrificial scenes, in so far as there is any indication of a deity at all, herms are again in the majority, presumably with the same vague implication. Some, however, have additional charac-teristics, which, to the contemporary public, may have been recognizable as belonging to specific sanctuaries. On a krater in Kiel [Fig. 143, V181: Kiel B 45], by the same painter as the krater in London with the victorious torch racers of the tribe Antiochis, but a much more sloppy work, there is a white painted herm set in a sort of naiskos or shrine (maybe consisting of no more than four columns on a base, supporting a roof). And on a krater in the Vatican [Fig. 144, V206: Vatican 17924] the same painter, again not at his best, has depicted a curiously slender elongated herm. It is regrettable that the Nikias Painter did not spend more care on these two vases, for both appear to have some interesting features. On both the firewood on the altar is clearly indicated, but it is difficult to be certain whether there is an osphUs on it. The altar itself on the Kiel krater is of a common shape: a high rectangular block set on a broader base, and surmounted by volute-bolsters. The altar on the Vatican krater, however, is of the much less usual low rounded variety, referred to by the term eschtira. In both pictures an acolyte approaches from the left, carrying a kanoun (besides an oinochoe, Kiel, or spits with splanchna, Vatican). As often, three sprigs are set in the rim of the kanoun, and -something which does not occur so often -its contents have been indicated in white paint (though not, unfortunately, so precisely that we might identify them 74 See Kron 1976, 193,240, 279 An 2 . 75 Poss ibly Prometheus ; cf. the inscribed white-haired Prometheus on the fragments Vatican (ex Astarita 124-7), ARV' 1269/ 6 : Codrus Painter; see Froning 1971, 120 nt . 513. 76 Signature: NUClW; 'EPI10KA.EOU<; ·AVCL<pI.:ilCJ'tlO<; E1tOlWEV.

These pictures, and quite a few others, show that in this stage of the ritual too the kanoun was used to bring certain things to the altar. A low altar occurs on two more vase paintings, each with enough unusual features to merit special attention. The first one is a kylix by the Pan Painter, c. 470 B.C. [Fig. 145, V195: Oxford 1911.617]. On one side we see a figure in a long sacerdotal robe pouring a libation from a kantha-ros onto the fire, which bums on the altar. There is a respectable pile of firewood, on which the osphUs can easily be distinguished. The altar has a unique shape, different from the escbara-type we saw on the Vatican krater above: it looks like no more than the top slab of a regular altar, sitting almost directly on the ground. On the right stand a youth and a man, each pouring from an oinochoe. On the far left is another youth, who stretches out his right arm; what he held is lost (possibly also an oinochoe). Since the pictures on the other side of this cup, and on the inside tondo, undoubtedly belong together, it could well be that all three pictures are related, and that the sacrificial scene is connected with the activities that are going on there. These, however, have not been satisfac-torily explained.77 On the inside a male figure walks to the left, himation tied round his waist, holding a long shallow vessel (skaphe) full of irregu-larly shaped small balls painted red (with this painter, who works with clear outlines, the fuzzy shape of the balls, lacking a distinct contour, must be significant). He is followed by a man who holds a writing case. On the left is seen part of a structure, which may be better understood if we look at the picture on the outside of the cup. There, in the centre, is a low platform supported on big stones. On it stands a large kotyle-shaped vessel, containing the same small red balls, some of which lie on both sides of it on the platform. On the right a man, holding a stylus and a writing tablet, sets one foot on the platform and looks back at a youth who has his himation tied round his waist and brings a skaphe full of the small red balls. On the far side of the platform, to the left of the man, stands another youth, similarly dressed. He extends his right hand holding some of the red balls over the vessel, and stretches out his opened left hand, in a gesture that precisely echoes that of the priestly figure with the kantha-ros on the opposite side of the kylix. On the far left, behind this youth, is an elderly bald man holding a writing case. Clearly things are being collected and recorded, but the interpretation of the whole scene rather 77 See the discussion by Beazley in eVA Oxford I , p . 6-7."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"I II 140 CHAPTER FOUR hinges on the identification of the small irregular red balls, and no con-vincing suggestion has been made.78 On an amphora of Panathenaic shape, dated c. 430 B. C., the altar is so low that the firewood is piled almost immediately on the ground [Fig. 146, V173: Darmstadt A 1969:4]. The osphUs is burning in the fire. On the left stands a youthful acolyte, himation tied round his waist, who holds a kanoun in his left hand and an oinochoe in his right. A man standing opposite him, on the right, is distinguished as a priest by his robe. In his right hand he holds a kantharos, from which he pours a libation onto the fire, and in his left hand he holds some small balls or pellets. These differ from the red objects in the previous picture, in that they do have a distinct regular outline. There are some other representations of persons involved in a sacrifice who hold a handful of such pellets, not unlike marbles. On an oinochoe, also of the third quarter of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 148, V196: Oxford 1931. 9], we have a youthful splanchn6ptes holding his spit over the altar fire, while a bearded man pours a libation over it. A second youth holds an oinochoe, and a handful of pellets. On a neck-amphora of the second quarter of the same century [Fig. 147, V303: New York Brooklyn Mus. 59.34], as on the amphora in Darmstadt, the pellets are held by the man pouring the libation from a stemless kantharos onto the altar (there appears to be no osphus here), while an acolyte opposite him holds the oinochoe. A stamnos by the Pan Painter [V31O: Once Rome Palazzo Ruspoli] again has an officiant pouring a libation from a kantharos onto a (relatively low) altar and holding pellets (painted red) in his left hand. Behind him stands a youth holding a kanoUn and opposite him another one with an oinochoe. In the descriptions of this vase, no mention is made of an osphus.79 Still earlier, in the first quarter of the century, belongs a krater which shows satyrs engaged in a sacrifice [V428: Castelvetrano]. One side has a satyr with a kanoun and another one holding an oinochoe and a bowl; on the other side one satyr, holding a handful of pellets painted red, pours from an oinochoe into the kantharos which is held by the other satyr, who also has a kithara. A fragment of a krater of the later fifth century only pre-serves part of the person holding the libation cup and a handful of pellets [Fig. 149, V306: Oxford 1954.255]. Perhaps we should also include a 78 Webster 1972, 142, considers the possibility that they might be pot-sherds and that what we have here is the counting in an ostracism. 79 See Beazley in eVA Oxford 1, 6-7, and Beazley 1931, 22. POST-KILL 141 fragmentary krater from the Athenian Akropolis, of around the middle of the century [V281: Athens NM Akr 752]. It shows an altar, a woman standing on the far side of it praying, and another woman on the right who holds some tiny objects, rendered as black dots, in her left hand, while putting some of them with her right hand on the altar. A number of these small dot-like objects can be distinguished on top of the altar. It has been suggested that the pellets in these vase paintings might be barley corns (OhU,).80 This may be true of the black dots in the last picture, but in the other cases it seems unlikely. Their size, I think, is no real objection. For the sake of visibility the vase painter may be excused for painting them a bit larger than life. But the context pleads against their interpretation as olai. These are an intrinsic part of the preliminary ritual, before the killing of the animal, whereas our pellets always occur in the context of a libation, and in the two most complete pictures unrnistakeably in the post-kill, osphus-and-splanchna phase of the ceremony. I would propose that they may be thulernata, a component in this latter stage of the ritual that we have so far ignored, but which we shall now look into. Thulemata After the slave in Aristophanes' Peace has slaughtered the sheep, he brings the cut out thighbones to Trygaios ,and says: \"Take the thighbones and put them on the altar. I'll go and get the splanchna and the thulema-tao \"81 In a fragment of a comedy by Aristophanes' contemporary Phere-krates, a god complains that people just lay the bare bones on the altar for the gods, and then, feeling ashamed before one another, cover them with lots of thulemata.82 The scholion on the Aristophanes passage tells us something about the nature of these things: \"Thutemata: alphita (barley groats or meal) added as a supplement to the sacrifices to the gods. It is sprinkled with wine and olive oil. Telekleides in the Sterroi: '0 lord 80 Beazley 1931,22; Webster 1972,142. 81 Aristophanes, Pax 1039-1040; see above note 17. 82 Pherekrates fr. 28 Kassel-Austin (= 23 Kock); see above note 30. Menander, Dyscolus 440-1, also mentions the preparation of thultmata as an indispensable part of the sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"142 CHAPTER FOUR Hermes, gulp down of the thulemata' . ,,83 Another late source has it that the barley meal was kneaded together with wine and oil. 84 In Eumaios' sacrifice, in Odyssey 14, the swineherd throws the parts that are destined for the gods into the fire \"having strewn them with meal. ,,85 This has been taken to mean that they were covered with a coating of moistened meal or dough, before they were put in the sacrificial fire. 86 For Homer, this may be so, but in the Aristophanes passage, which dates from the same period as our vase paintings, the procedure is clearly different. The thighbones etc. are already being placed on the altar by Trygaios, while the slave goes to fetch the thulemata. So it is only after they have been put on the altar, that these bare bones will, in Pherekrates' words, be covered with thulemata. This, and the passage from Tele-ldeides, clearly indicates that the thulemata were something separate, not just a coating.87 Of the shape of the thulemata the texts tell us nothing, but to be able to throw the meal mixed with wine and oil onto the god's portion without any risk of extinguishing the sacrificial fire, it would be convenient to knead it into small lumps or pellets. The pellets in our vase paintings appear at the right moment in the ritual, to make their identifica-tion with these thulemata reasonably likely. The kanow, which is depicted in several of the relevant pictures, was probably used to bring them to the altar. 88 The acolyte carrying a kanoun 83 Scholion Aristophanes, Pax 1040: 8uA:I]j!a'ta' 'tCt 'tOle; 8£Ole; E1tl8uoj!£va aA!pl'ta. f:1nppatV£'tal /)£ olvC!JKal.

The immediately subsequent moment is shown on a late Classical krater [Fig. 151, V189: Nancy]. A boy presents the kanoun to the bearded sacrificer standing at the altar, who is taking something from it. We can not see what it is he takes, and by itself this part of the picture could equally well have a place in the pre-kill phase, to denote the sacrificer taking olai from the kanoun [cf. V128: Athens NM 12491]. On the Nancy krater, however, it is clear that the ritual is in a more advanced stage: in the fire on the altar the osphus is being burnt, and a youth on the right holds the spit with splanchna over the same fire, while a pipe-player accompanies the proceedings. For a contemporary Athenian, familiar with the various consecutive components of sacrificial ritual, the context in this and similar pictures would suggest that the kanoun contained, not olai, but thulemata. Finally, a late Classical krater in the Louvre [Fig. 152, V200: Paris Louvre G 496] presents yet another element that is not at first sight easily identifiable. Most of the scene is familiar: a blood-stained altar with neatly arranged firewood (apparently no osphus); on the left, behind the bearded officiant, a youthful assistant holding the splanchna on spits over the fire; on the right a second assistant with kanoun and oinochoe, and, behind him, Apollo holding a laurel branch (on the far side of the altar stands a laurel tree). If the bearded sacrificer would have held a phiale or cup for libation in his right hand, this would have been just one more member of a familiar series. What he holds, however, is of too irregular a shape to be so interpreted. It looks like a soft yielding mass, with traces of yellowish paint. 89 There is some evidence, though it is far from conclusive, that part 1466; V161: Athens Agora P 5495; V175: Durham 1972.1; V176: Ferrara 9925; V180: Heidelberg 143; V183: Lecce 630; V193: Oxford 536; V200: Paris Louvre G 496; V204: Saint Petersburg 1658; V206: Vatican 17924; V210: Pivate coIl.; V21l: ex Hamilton; V181: Kiel B 54; V189: Nancy). 89 For the yellow colour see Pottier 1897-1922, 279 G 496. Durand 1986, 137 f., proposes to recognize the enigmatic object on this vase (and some others) as a pelanos being deposited on the altar. As far as our evidence goes, however, the pelanos would not seem to have a place in this part of the ritual. Jameson, in: M. Cropp et al. (eds.) , Greek tragedy and its legacy.

There is a similar picture, with a man holding an irregular object over the fire (with ospbUs), on a black figure lekythos of the early fifth century B.C. [Fig. 153, V158: Athens NM 595]. There, however, the drawing is even less clear, and slightly damaged by a crack in the vase, so it contributes little to our understanding. 4.3.

In Homer, in this second part the ritual aspect of the sacrifice is no longer very much in the foreground, and we shall see in this section that the same is largely true for the icono-graphical material. In Classical Greece animal sacrifice was the main source of meat for human consumption, so it stands to reason that there would have been considerable interest in this aspect of the ritual. Cult regulations in in-scriptions may stipulate that the sacrificial meat should be consumed within the sacred precinct (or, more precisely, that it should not be taken away).93 Sometimes, on the other hand, the flesh of the sacrificed animals could be sold.94 Normally, if no such special regulations were in force, those who participated in the sacrifice took home part of the sacrificial meat. 95 At the great festivals of the state, when many animals were slaugh-tered, large scale distributions of meat· had to be organized. The fourth century law regulating the Lesser Panathenaia contains detailed instruc-tions for the distribution of the meat of the two main sacrifices: several groups of officials had their share guaranteed before the general distribu-tion was ·made to the other participants in the festivities.96 Similarly, a decree of the early fourth century concerning the cult of Asklepios re-served the meat from the first ox for the prytaneis, the archons, and other officials.97 When the epimeletai of the Mysteries in 215/4 B.C. were 93 For the interdiction to take away any part of the victim, leges sacrae use the formula oine c!.1tocpopa, ou !popa. jlTt Eivat EK!pOPTtV. vel sim.: LS 18 passim; LS 54, lO-ll; LS 69,31-32; LS 132. 3; LS 151 A 45, 58-60; B 4. 24; LS 157 A 5-7.

On the later Hellenistic votive reliefs from northwestern Asia Minor, the theme of the sacrificial banquet occurs a few times. The type is well illustrated by a stele from a sanctuary near Apameia on the Propontis, dedicated to Apollo and Meter Kybele by a religious association of thia-sftai and thiasitides. 100 It shows the familiar sacrificial scene in the upper panel, and in the lower register the members of the thiasos at a festive meal, with a copious supply of drink and souvlakia, and some light entertainment provided by musicians and a dancer. The inscription dates the stele in the year 178, which translates to 119 B.C., or 93 A.D., or something in between, depending on which era is meant. 101 We should not hastily conclude, that the Classical Greeks had no interest in what happened with the rest of the sacrificial animal.

And a number of vase paintings of the later sixth and the fifth century B.C. depict the working of meat. On an Attic black figure krater, described above [V160: London B 362], the roasting of the sphinchna and the burning of the osphus is combined with the chopping up, on a table, of the rest of the sacrificed goat. A simple subtraction sum may teach us, which parts of the animal the man at the table is putting his knife to: the splanchna have been extracted and the ospbiis cut out, the two hind legs (minus the thighbones) hang on the wall, and the head lies under the table, so the rest is what is being sliced up. Further operations concerned with the preparation of the sacrificial meat for consumption are depicted on the Ricci hydria [V154: Rome VG]. The altar scene in the centre, and the things happening to the left of it, have already been dealt with. To the right of the altar, nearest to it, is a man, ladling wine from an amphora on a stand into a cup. He faces left, and may be considered part of the central scene, where a libation is being (or about to be) performed. Further to the right is a man at a large kettle (lebes) on feet, which stands over a fire; he holds a flesh-hook (kreagra) in his right hand, with which he has fished a piece of meat out of the lebes, to put it on the plate in his left hand. Then follow two men on either side of a shallow basin on a pedestal. Next are two men at a table, skewer-ing small pieces of meat (some of which may be seen lying on the table) onto two spits. Finally, on the far right, is an enigmatic scene, to which we will return, albeit to little avail. So far, we have seen that part of the meat is put on spits, to be roasted eventually (or possibly as a convenient means of transportl°2) , and part is boiled or stewed in a kettle. In Homer, all the meat apparently was roasted, but later on that was unusual, and a lebes was considered a rather indispensable implement at the preparations of a sacrificial feast. The mageiros and slave in Menander's Dyscolus forgot to bring one. After having pestered the man next door for some time, trying to borrow one, the cook decides to roast all the meat, or better yet, to use the frying-pan he happens to have with him.103 But normally a lebes would be used. 104 On 102 Thus Durand 1979, 155 and Berthiaume 1982.

One man holds an indistinct object, possibly a platter of some sort, while the other holds a stick-like object with which he stirs the contents of the kettle, or is fishing for a piece of meat to put it on the platter. Next to them is another man, chopping up meat to put it on spits. And the preparations for the cannibalistic sacrificial meal by the servants of Bousiris, on an Apulian dinos [V363: New York 1984.11.7], include the filling and warming up of a tripod kettle over a fire. The two men at the standed basin, between the kettle scene and the table scene on the Ricci hydria, are generally interpreted as washing themselves at a laver (louterion). 105 Having a good wash in the middle of the various stages of food processing may seem a good idea to us, but even if we assume that Greeks in the late sixth century B.C. had similar ideas about hygiene, it is still a bit unexpected that the vase painter should have considered it important or interesting enough to include it in his picture. To see it as a ritual ablution at the beginning of the ceremony would be, in itself, more acceptable. But then, the place of the scene in the whole narrative sequence is hard to understand, and moreover we would expect to see the ablutions performed by (one of) the officiant(s) himself, not by servants. It seems to me that the identification of the basin on a stand as a loute-rion may have been too easily accepted. It is true that louteria looked like this, and that they were of common occurrence in sanctuaries. 106 But there was another household utensil that was very similar in shape to a loute-rion, so much so that in vase painting they are often impossible to distin-guish unless the context is conclusive: the kneading trough or kneading KpanO'OV 07t.&.v .a KpeU 7tav.u; cpUiVE'Ul.

POST-KILL 149 table (ktirdopos, maktra).107 It may be because of this similarity that louterion and kardopos (both stone and pottery) appear in successive entries on the Attic Stelai. 108 There are, however, a number of unmis-takeable three-dimensional representations of kardopoi in terracotta groups of women kneading dough, either singly, 109 or in the context of a bake house. 110 They all show round kcirdopoi on a single central pedestal. Some are fairly deep troughs, others are almost flat, like a table. In vase paint-ings, kardopoi, as opposed to louteria, may sometimes be identified with certainty (because the dough on it is visible), III or with a reasonable degree of probability (because they are too flat to be functional as a washing basin). 112 The \"louterion\" on the Ricci hydria, in my opinion, makes better sense as a kneading table, not so much because it is on the shallow side for a wash basin, though there is that, but mainly because thus it fits much 107 The object has received an exemplary treatment by Amyx, Hesp eria 27 (1958) 239-241; and Sparkes, iHS 82 (1962) 126, 135, and iHS 85 (1965) 162-3. 108 The Attic Stelai comprise a group of inscriptions recording the sale of items of personal property confiscated from Alkibiades and other condemned men, who were accused of mutilating the Herms and profanating the Eleusinian mysteries in 415/4 B.C.; see W.K.

This leaves us with one unexplained activity, on the far right of the picture. One man stands facing right, holding a cup in his left hand and perhaps a knife in his (damaged) right hand. Opposite him sits another man, holding an object which Ricci interpreted as a bellows, and which has been passed over in silence by most of the subsequent interpreters of this vase. The object does indeed resemble a pair of bellows of the type that adorns many a modern fireplace (essentially a soft leather bag fixed between two wooden boards that one pulls apart and presses together). But the problem is that the object, if so interpreted, would seem to be ahead of its time by several centuries, for it does not otherwise occur before the Roman period.113 Bellows in Archaic and Classical Greece were of a different type, and-and this is a more serious objection-their use was typically restricted to smelting furnaces.114 Open cooking fires were helped along, if necessary, with a simple fan (rhfpis). 115 So, what the man on the Ricci hydria is handling is probably not a bellows after all (anyway, no fire can be seen where he is pointing it, and if there were, the man opposite him would be standing in the middle of it). If we take the half goat hanging from the vine above these two men as an indication that they are busy with some part of the victim, we may perhaps consider the possibility that the seated one is holding two spits with entrails. 116 Perhaps not. An incomplete Attic red figure kylix of the late sixth century B.C. [V224: Florence 5 B 2] must also have shown a sacrificial ceremony in its more advanced stage.

Another fragment of the same cup, now in Heidelberg, has part of a man in a patterned sacerdotal robe, so the ritual context of the handling of the meat was explicit in this pic-ture. In the following examples that is not the case. An early picture of a man and an assistant chopping up a leg of meat is to be found under one of the handles of the Corinthian Eurytios krater [V240: Paris Louvre E 635]. This scene is clearly linked, by an interposed dinos on stand and oinochoe, with the banquet on the obverse of the vase. On this Corinthian krater the chopping up is done on a sort of table, consisting of a (round?) platform supported on a central pedestal. In later representations the mageiroi often use a solid wooden chopping block. The Greek word for it was epixenon, and it plays a part in Aristo-phanes' Acharnians, where Dikaiopolis states his case with his head on the block, so that he may be decapitated on the spot if he does not convince his audience.118 Typically this epixenon was a solid cylindrical block of wood with three legs, such as is still fairly widely used in modern times. 119 Two red figure pelikai of the first half of the fifth century B. C., one Attic [Fig. 155, V222: Erlangen I 486] and one Boiotian [Fig. 156, V239: Munich 2347], show butchers at work at such a block. The three-legged chopping block is also a feature of some of the representations of the story of Herakles and Bousiris [V348: Ferrara T 579; V363: New York MMA 1984. 11.7]. On an Attic black figure oinochoe [Fig. 157, V213: Boston 99.527] the butcher and his helper use a different type of block: a solid cylinder of wood sitting firmly on the ground, and having a slightly projecting top. 120 In this picture there is a table as well, with some slices of meat on it, and a basin underneath.

This is what is going on on the outer sides of a kylix by Makron [V232: Paris Louvre C 10918].122 The inside of the cup has a man at a large kettle or bowl on a tripod stand, into which he appears to be putting lumps of meat. 123 Two men putting meat on a spit and cutting it to size, while two dogs show an interest in their work, are again the subject on a black figure olpe of the same period [V225: Heidelberg]. 124 A Boiotian black figure lekanis lid, dated to c. 500 B.C., shows various aspects of the mageiros' work in a continuous narrative [Fig. 158, V238: Adolphseck 120]. Two men hold up a large slice of meat, one of them preparing to cut it to size with a knife; a number of similar slices lie on a bench. Next to them two men are wrapping pieces of meat round a spit. In the third part of the scene, between two columns, two men are busy with meat on a spit placed on a support, ready to be roasted, while a third man brings another spit with meat. 125 To sum up, the vase paintings depicting men working or handling meat, with the exception of the first three mentioned, contain no explicit reference to sacrificial ritual. The vase painters and their patrons, if they had cared to think about it, would probably have assumed that the meat depicted came from sacrifices, but that is just not the point of interest in these pictures. They are rather of the class of representations of artisans at work, comparable to vase paintings of potters, blacksmiths, carpenters 121 It seems that pieces of meat hung in a fig tree would become tender more quickly: Ploutarchos, Moralia 696 e. 122 The small pieces of meat on the table, rendered in added red, are not visible on the photographs published; see Durand, in : Detienne & Vernant (eds.) 1979, 165 fig. 19. 123 Sparkes, lHS 85 (1965) 163, saw him as taking dough (?) out of a bowl in the shape of rolls to bake, and this may well be the preferable interpretation. 124 A series of late black figure olpai shows Herakles holding a similar spit of meat at an altar [V386: Berlin F 1919; V387: Gotha 44; V388: London B 473; V390: Paris Louvre F 338]. 125 There is a third spit with meat in this scene; it is not quite clear whether it stands ready, or is held by the last mentioned man in his left hand. POST-KILL 153 and cobblers. 126 The butchers and their assistants are shown either naked, or in typical working clothes (loin-cloth or himation wrapped round the waist). There are a few vase paintings which show a man or youth walking or running, who carries a leg of meat. It may be a leg of a sheep or goat, carried in one hand [Fig. 159, V215: Agrigento 26 (715); Fig. 160, V220: Boston 10.184; V226: Laon 37.1034; V229: London 1928.1-17.60], or a hea vy ox's leg carried over the shoulder [V233: Providence 25.076; V214 : Salerno]. Most of these are isolated figures with no context. We could see them as people who have participated in a sacrificial ceremony and are now taking home part of the sacrificial meat, which, as we have seen, was the customary thing to do, unless there were special regulations requiring the consumption of the animal within the sacred precinct. Thus Makron's picture of a boy running with a hoop, holding a leg of meat, while his little dog frolics at his side [Fig.-161, V231: Munich 2674], may be meant as a boy running home from a sacrifice. 127 Or maybe he was sent by his father to bring a portion of the sacrificial feast to a good friend. 128 Yet the painter may have had something very different in mind. A contem-porary pe1ike [V221: Boulogne 134] has a homoerotic courting scene on either side. On one side, the boy being courted by an adult man, holds a large cake on a plate and a leg of meat. The latter probably derives from some sacrifice, but once again that is clearly not the painter's point. What it refers to here, is one of the gifts exchanged between erastes and ero-menos.129 126 See e.g. Ziomecki 1975. For a somewhat different appreciation of these vase paintings, however, see Sarah Peirce's recent article on revelry and thysia, CIAnt 12 (1993) 219-266. 127 See also the boy balancing a tray of food covered with a napkin in one hand, while trundling a hoop along with the other hand: Oxford 1886.587, Attic red figure kylix, ARVl 357/69: Colmar Painter; CVA 1, pI. 1,8; Boardman 1975, fig. 236; Vickers 1982, fig. 37; Vanhove (ed.) 1992, 160 Dr. 12, 166. 128 Cf.

MISCELLANEOUS POST-KILL TOPICS 4.4.1. Priest's prerogatives? There are, to my knowledge, no unmistakable representations of certain portions of the sacrificial animal being reserved for the priest. The icono-graphical material, taken by itself, therefore hardly warrants the inclusion of a section on this topic. There are, however, literary and (numerous) epigraphical texts dealing with the subject. In Aristophanes' Plutus, the sla ve Karion pokes fun at the priest in the Asklepieion, whom he saw, during the night of incubation, taking the cheese-cakes and figs off the holy table, and going round all the altars seeing if anyone had left a cake there, and then \"consecrating\" all of them into his bag.130 A joke about the priests' greediness was always good for a laugh, but as a matter of fact any Athenian would have known that what the priest here collected was nothing but his due.131 In a fragment of a comedy by Aristophanes' contemporary Ameipsias, it is stated that the special perquisites given to the priests would normally include a ham, the rib (or side), and the left half of the head. 132 Inscriptions with sacred laws abound in a variety of very precise regulations regarding the priest's perquisites at sacrifices (hierosuna, gera).133 The parts mentioned by Ameipsias indeed occur frequently. In a sacred law from Athens, of the fourth century B.C., they are further defined as \"to be put on the table\". 134 A general survey of similar regulations shows, that the trapezomata, i.e. the offerings placed 130 Aristophanes, Plutus 676-681: e1l:Et't' ava!3AEljla.; opro 'tOY tEpea 'tou.; <pSOt.; a<papmxt;,ov'ta lCat 'ta.; iaxMa.; a1l:0 'tij.; 'tpa1l:tt;, 1I'; 'tij.; tEpa.;. ~E'ta 'to\\l'tO lit 1I:EPlijA9E 'tou.; !3Ol~OU'; a1l:av'ta.; tv ICUIC\"'qJ, E\\ 1I:OU 1I:01l:avov £Ill n lCa'ta\"'E\"'El~~tvOV' e1l:Et'ta 'tauS' flYlt;,EV Ei.; aalC'tav n va. 131 Greedy priests in Aristophanes: Pax 1044 ff. ; Plutus 1171 ff. 132 Ameipsias fr. 7 Kassel-Austin (= 7 Kock): liilio'tal ~a\",tcrS' tEproauva 1C00\",ij, 'to 1I:\"'EUpOV, f]~ilCpalp' apla'tEpa. 133 For a recent survey, see Le Guen-Pollet, in: Etienne & Le Dinahet 1991, 13-23.

POST-KILL 155 on the holy table, would normally fall to the priest,135 The parts of the victim most frequently included are a ham (11:0)1.11) or a leg (01l:£AOC;), the head (or half of it), portions of splcinchna and meat, and, above all, the skin. In addition to parts of the victim, the priests regularly received sacrificial cakes of every conceivable description, which also would first have been placed on the holy table. As we saw in the previous section, there are a number of vase paint-ings with men or boys carrying a leg of meat. But there is only one instance, I think, where one might reasonably consider the possibility that the vase painter had the priest's portion in mind. That is on the inside of a kylix by Makron [Fig. 162, V228: London E 62]. A bearded man, wreathed with vine, is seated on a stool, and a boy brings him a leg of meat and a dish with a delicious looking cake or pie. In some of the vase paintings showing the chopping up of meat, the victim's head (another regular part of the priest's portion), is put to one side [V160: London B 362; V230: Munich; V235: Vatican 17924], but nowhere is there any explicit reference to the priest, and the same goes for the picture of a youth dragging the skin of an ox, on an amphora by the Pan Painter [Fig. 163, V219: Boston 01.8109]. A holy table loaded with cakes (or portions of meat?) is set beside the altar on an Attic red figure krater of the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. [Fig. 164, V175: Durham 1972.1]. On an Apulian krater ofc. 400 B.C. [VI49: Naples 2411], we see a woman bringing a tray filled with various cakes etc. towards the table next to the altar, where another woman is about to kill the sacrificial kid, And on a fourth century votive relief from the Athenian Asklepieion, the worshippers are overloading the hiera trapeza with a rich variety of cakes [RIO: Athens NM 1335]. In a fiscal sense, so to speak, these trapezomata might be regarded as priest's perquisites. But to call them that would be a misrepresentation of the intention of the makers and buyers of these depictions, At the moment that a worshipper deposited these offerings on the holy table, they were gifts to the god, even though he knew full well where they would end up. 135 For 'tpa1l:Et;,ro~a'ta see LSA 13, 15; the verb 'tpa1l:Et;,oOl: LS 64, 13-14; LS 65, 86; LS 125, 2; Altert. von Pergamon VIII 3 (1969) nr. 161, l.

Hieroskopia When the carcass of the victim had been opened up, inspection of the splanchna, particularly the liver, would reveal whether the signs of the sacrifice were favourable.136 Such an inspection of the inner organs of the animal, though not restricted to military sacrifices, played an especially important role there. The reading of the signs was a specialist skill, the mantike techne, which was the domain of the mantis, but anyone with an interest in the matter would be familiar with the main principles, such as that the absence of the processus pyramidalis (A.o~6C;) meant trouble. In Euripides' Electra, Aigisthos only has to take one glance at the splanchna to know that things are not well. 137 And, to turn to a less mythical figure, Xenophon made no secret of the fact that he had acquired a working knowledge of the art of extispicy, a useful thing for a general to have, as a means of checking on the honesty of his mantis. 138 Depictions of hieroskopia enjoyed a short-lived popularity in Attic vase painting in the last decades of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B. C. Most of the relevant pictures, 19 black figure and 3 red figure, have been assembled and analyzed in some recent studies. 139 This section will therefore be limited to a couple of general observations. In all of these vase paintings, hieroskopia is performed in a military context. Normally the nucleus of the group is formed by a warrior facing left, inspecting the liver that is presented to him by a rather small boy standing opposite him. In most cases the warrior is actually touching the 136 Stengel 1920, 60-61. 137 Euripides, Electra 826-829: lEpa 0' E<; XElPU<; Aul3cbv A'lYlcr90<; ij9PEl. lCUt 1.0130<; ILEV oil ltpocrfiv crltAurxvol<;, ltUAUl OE lCUt OOXUt XOAfi<; ltEAu<; lCulCa<; Ecpul vov 'tqJ crlCOltOUVn ltpocrl3oAU<;. 138 Xenophon, Anabasis V 6, 29: LlAuvo<; oE ILOl I> lLuvn<; altElCpivu'to 'to ILEV ILEYlcr'tov.

(Plovdiv: Roux, AntK 7 (1964) 30-41). POST-KILL 157 liver with the fmgers of his right hand. In one instance [Fig. 165, V262: Wiirzburg 507], the warrior holds a small part of the sphinchna in his raised right hand (one might think of the gall bladder, though there is no particularly close resemblance). In 18 vase paintings an old ~an is pres~nt at the inspection of the liver; in most instances he stands dIrectly behind the small attendant who holds the liver, and gestures with one of his hands. In one case, the old man has taken the place of the warrior, oppo-site the boy holding the liver, and is inspecting it himself [Fig. 166, V247: Copenhagen NM 3241]. This picture has other unique features as well: the boy holds up two separate pieces of sphinchna for inspection, one in each hand, and there is a table in the background on which lie what in this context are probably meant as other splanchna. Other figures that may be present, more ore less frequently, are other warriors, Scythian archers in their characteristic outfit, women, and dogs. In one picture, the vase painter has given a mythical connotation to the familiar scene by naming the old man Nestor [V261: Vatican ex Asta-rita763]. Conversely, in two other ones, their contemporary character is emphasized by a peculiar expedient: the small figure of the boy holding the liver is changed into a slave by the addition of a beard [Fig. 167, V242: Bonn 464.39; V254: Rome VG 47266].140 Taken as a whole, the series gives an interesting illustration of how vase painters could play around with, and give somewhat different mean-ings to, a scene, by shifting around and slightly varying a few stock figures. In most cases, the central part of the representation would suggest a warrior inspecting the splanchna of the sacrificed victim before depart-ing on a campaign. The gesticulating old man in most cases can be inter-preted as an experienced mantis, expounding on the signs he observes, while in some he may have been given the role of the old father taking leave of the departing warrior. 4.4.3. Hol6kausta One can easily understand that the type of sacrifice in which the animal was burnt whole offered less scope for vase paintings than the type of sacrificial ceremony that has been our main concern so far. Still, it is a little surprising that hol6kausta are all but absent in the Greek 140 Cf. Himmelmann 1971."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"158 CHAPTER FOUR iconographical material. There is one good example: an Attic red figure oinochoe of the late fifth century B.C. [Fig. 168, V382: Kiel B 55]. It shows a low altar (escMra) at the foot of a tree, on which lies a bovine skull and possibly a second animal skull. A man in a long ornate sacerdo-tal robe pours a libation from a kantharos onto the altar, while a youth holds an oinochoe. On the far right stands Herakles. We have seen Hera-kles several times participating in a sacrifice, either as sacrificer or as intended victim, but here he appears to be neither. He stands somewhat aloof, not involved in the ritual action, much as the recipient god is represented in comparable vase paintings. 141 The representation is there-fore best taken as a sacrifice to Herakles. And since in a sacrifice where the worshippers consumed part of the victim, the head would not normally belong to the god's portion, it is likely that we have here a rare depiction of a hol6kauston in honour of Herakles. In Attika, where Herakles' cult was very widespread and popular, it was by no means usual to offer a holokaustic sacrifice to this deity. On the contrary, often there is much emphasis on the copious sacrificial feast, which more or less mirrored the proverbial gluttony of Herakles himself. 142 But we know of hol6kausta for Herakles elsewhere,143 and there is nothing against assuming that in Attika too on some occasions he received such sacrifices, as other heroes did. 144 141 E.g. Apollo in [VI27: Agrigento 4688; V179: Gotha 51; V202: Port Sunlight 5036; V200: Paris Louvre G 496; V208: Art market].

Memories of sacrifice Animal sacrifice, by its very nature, was an ephemeral affair. After the last slice of sacrificial meat had been consumed, no tangible memento of the sacrifice remained. To a certain Hermesandros in Cyrene, this was clearly an unacceptable thought, and he saw to it that his sacrifice of 120 oxen at a festival of Artemis was not forgotten, by setting up two inscrip-tions commemorating his largesse.145 And even poor people, who could only afford to sacrifice very little, would not like their little to be soon forgotten. 146 It probably was a common practice to accompany the sacri-fice of an animal by the dedication of a more durable votive offering, be it a humble wooden panel or a large marble relief, which in its shape or decoration contained a reference to that sacrifice. Such votive offerings have been the subject of a previous chapter. Another, simple way of keeping the memory of a sacrifice alive, was by nailing the skull of the victim to the wall of the sanctuary, or, in the case of a domestic sacrifice, to the porch of the house. In vase paintings with sacrificial scenes, such skulls, often adorned with stemmata, are of remarkably frequent occurrence, which suggests that this was a very common custom indeed.147 This throws an interesting light on a passage from Theophrastos' Characters, where he mentions the following as a characteristic feature of the man of petty ambition (~tKpoq)tA.6't1.11OC;): \"When he has sacrificed an ox, he nails up the front part of the skull with the horns, wreathed with enormous fillets, just opposite his door, so that everyone who comes in can see that he has sacrificed an ox. ,,148 It is not burnt whole. To take OlCEA,Oe; as an accusative, as Sokolowski does, would make an awkward Greek sentence; besides, 13 drachmae as compensation for the skin alone is an unacceptably high amount. An ox hide, at that time, would have been worth something between 6 and 8 drachmai (see Jameson' s ingenious calculations, in: Whittaker (ed.) 1988, 107-112). 145 ASAtene 39-40 (1961-62) 312-313 nrs. 161-162: 11 val1Ct.

Often the types portrayed by Theophrastos will do things that are not in themselves unusual, but they will exaggerate them. Maybe our man was overdoing the size of the stemmata hung over the skull. Or perhaps we are to assume that the nailing up of skulls of sacrificed animals was customary in sanctu-aries, and that decorating your own house with them was considered a bit over the top. CHAPTER FIVE PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF SOME ASPECTS 5.1. WREATHS AND FILLETS Participants in a sacrificial ceremony would normally wear a wreath round their head. 1 In the representations it is nowhere significantly absent, that is to say that it is indicated in all representations that are sufficiently clear and precise to include such details, i.e most vase paintings. In votive reliefs it can rarely be distinguished now, but it is not unlikely that often it was painted on originally. Wearing a wreath was not in itself distinctive of participation in sacrifice, but was also usual in other religious ceremo-nies.2 This created enough of a demand for ready-made wreaths for a poor war widow with five children to earn some sort of living by plaiting wreaths in the myrtle market. 3 And there were many other occasions, less strictly religious, that required a similar adornment, for instance taking part in a wedding,4 a banquet or a symposion,5 making a public speech,6 or being dead.7 Which makes it a source of comic misunderstandings. The victims too would be wreathed or hung with fillets.8 In Aristo-phanes' Nubes, when Strepsiades is handed a wreath by Sokrates, he is 1 Blech 1982. Cf. Rudhardt 1958, 258-9. 2 Cf.

II Stemma denotes the fillet used for that purpose. 12 It is formed of loose strands of wool with pieces of string tied round it at regular intervals.13 In vase paintings such fillets are frequently depicted, hung over the horns of bovine victims. On other animals, they are hardly ever seen. Occasionally a sacrificial pig has a fillet or garland round its belly (vase painting [VI28: Athens NM 12491], votive relief [RI64: Leiden Pb 158]),14 and once round its neck (what there is of it): [VI22: Geneva HR 66]. In votive reliefs, this again is a detail that may have been rendered in paint, leaving no trace. 5.2. THE KANOUN The literary evidence on the use of the kanoun in sacrificial ritual is quite straightforward. It contained the things that were necessary for the prelim-inary ritual: the barley corns, the fillet and the knife (olai, stemma, machaira).15 The very straightforwardness of the evidence has misled scholars into assuming that this was it. 16 It was not. The representational evidence shows that it had further uses. In a considerable number of the 9 Aristophanes, Nubes 255-257. 10 Euripides, Jphigenia Aulidensis 1567.

On the Boiotian tripod pyxis [V105: Berlin F 1727], a twisted fillet is shown hanging over the rim of the kanoiin, which could be the stemma. The knife is never actually shown in the kanoiin, but in some of the vase paintings of the myth of Herakles and Bousiris we have seen the two closely associated. See also the fragments of a Boiotian' Cabiran skyphos [Vl11: Brynn Mawr P 217]. 16 Deubner, IdJ 40 (1925) 210 ff.; Schelp 1975. PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 163 post-kill representations, showing the osphus and/or the spl<inchna, the kanoUn is present. It might be objected that these are perhaps examples of the vase painters combining several phases of the ritual into one picture. This, however, does not seem likely, for more than one reason. In the first place, the vessel with water to wash the hands (cMrnips), a typical pre-kill implement, is never found in a post-kill context. Secondly, we have seen that in some pictures the kanoUn is actually used by an acolyte to bring the god's portions of the slaughtered victim to the sacrificer, who takes them from it to put them on the altar [V 178: Frankfurt B 413; V 191 : New York 41.162.4]. This use of the kanoUn is also attested by Dionysios of Halikar-nassos, admittedly in a description of Roman sacrifice, but the point Dionysios wants to make here, is the similarity between the Roman and the Greek rite. 17 Furthermore, I have argued that in some representations we see the kanoun being used to bring the thulemata, which are to be thrown onto the god's portion on the altar. 18 But in the earlier part of the ritual, before the killing of the animal, the kanoun had other uses too. On a votive relief in the Louvre [R71: Paris Louvre 756], the kanoun is filled with doughnut-shaped sacrificial cakes, some of which have already been laid on the altar. Some vase paintings too show the kanoun containing cakes of various forms,19 e.g pyramid-shaped ones [VI49: Naples 2411], such as are often depicted on the tables of hero banquet reliefs, and round ones with a nob in the middle, for which popanon monomphalon would not be an inappropriate name.20 In the light of the above, the flattish rounded white object in the kanoun on the Caeretan hydria [VI20: Copenhagen NM 13567] is much more likely to be some sort of sacrificial cake or loaf, than a heap of olael Finally the 17 Dionysios of Halikarnassos VII 72, 15: Ked I1E'ta 't01),;0 OEtpav'tEe; 'tE Kal I1EAl-oav'tEe; anapxae; tAUI1PaVOv t~ EKUO'tOU onAurxvou Kal naV'toe; anou I1EAOUe;, lie; aAcpi'tOle; sEae; aVaO£1)Oav'tEe; npooEcpEPOV 'tOte; SUOU01V tnl Kavii'lV' Ot 0' tnl 'toile; PWJloile; tnlSEV'tEe; ucpfjn'tov Kal npooEonEvoov oivov Ka'ta 'trov a:YV1S0I1EVWV. 18 Above 4 .2: Thulemata. 19 E.g.

Usually this would be the work of the assistant, who would then present the kanoun to the officiant at the altar, so that he could take out of it what was needed. To see the kanoun as a mere server or tray, however, would be disregarding the fact that the kanoun in itself was a ritual implement, as expressed by its distinctive shape. Therefore, if something was put into the kanoun, this act would already mean a certain degree of consecration. This may be what the Greeks meant by the word enarchesthai.2 3 Finally, there is a considerable number of vase paintings depicting someone with a kanoun at an altar, but without any reference to animal sacrifice. A libation, or at least a cup or oinochoe, is often included in the scene. It is not impossible to regard these pictures as excerpts from scenes of animal sacrifice, but in that case the absence of any reference to the victim is awkward. It is more likely that such pictures were commonly seen as referring to the presentation of bloodless offerings. There were many occasions, apart from animal sacrifice, where prayers would be accompanied by the pouring of a libation and the deposition on an altar of some cakes or barley corns.24 5 .3. TABLES In the sacrificial scene in Aristophanes' Peace, at line 1033, while the slave is backstage allegedly slaughtering the sheep, Trygaios himself goes to fetche a table.25 A table would be a practical thing to have at hand, to cut portions from the splinchna as soon as they have been roasted, or to deal with the rest of the meat. We have seen several vase paintings where 22 Corinth, Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, kanA and Iikna: Stroud, Hesperia 34 (1965) pI. 11; Bookidis & Stroud 1987, 26. -Tiryns Heraion: Tiryns I (1912) 85 Dr. 155-156. -Argive Heraion: Athens NM 14226 -See also the fragmentary terracotta kaneph6ros from Phlious: Biers, Hesperia 40 (1971) 419 Dr. 82, pI. 93. 2 3 See Stengel 1910, 47-49. 24 See Stengel 1910, 14.

PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 165 a table, or sometimes a chopping block, is so used. But a little later in the Peace, when Trygaios' table must have been in full view on the stage, the charlatan-priest Hierokles asks: \"Where is the table?,,26 What he is interested in is an entirely different thing from the piece of household furniture Trygaios had fetched. In keeping with the rest of his questions, which are mainly concerned with the usual perqui-sites of priests, Hierokles is inquiring after the offering-table (hiera trapeza), for what was put on that table would usually fall to the priest as well.27 Offering-tables occur in some vase paintings [VI75: Durham 1972.2; V149: Naples 2411]. They are a standard component in the hero reliefs of the banquet type, but they also occur on votive reliefs to other gods, in particular Asklepios, and the Eleusinian deities. 28 The existence of hierai trapezai, and the setting of an offering-table in the cult of these deities, is well attested by several inscriptions. 2 9 5.4. ALTARS Various refmed typologies of ancient Greek altars, both real and in representations, have been published.30 I shall here confme myself to one specific functional distinction, corresponding with a difference in shape, that appears to follow from the ancient literary evidence, i.e. the distinc-tion between bomOs and escMra.31 A bomos is a rectangular altar standing 26 Aristophanes, Pax 1059: 1t01> 'tpn1t£~a. 27 See above 4.4.1.

Since doctors called hollow sores or boils escharai after this type of altar, it probably was circular in plan and hollow. The texts in question suggest a neat bipartite scheme, with on the one hand the cult of heroes (and chthonic deities) characterized by sacrifices of animals burnt whole (holokausta) on an eschdra, and on the other hand the worship of (Olym-pian) gods, which entailed the burning of only a small part of the animal for the god on a bomOs, while the rest of the animal would be eaten by the sacrificers. In a classic article of almost half a century ago, A.D. Nock has convincingly shown that the supposed correspondence of participation in the sacrificial meat, and non-participation, with respectively the cult of Olympian gods and the (so called chthonic) cult of heroes, can not be maintained, in the face of an overwhelming amount of (especially epigraphical) evidence to the contrary. 32 In archaeological literature, however, the old bipartite scheme has lingered on. The other part of the scheme, restricting bomol to the cult of Olympian gods, and escharai to the cult of heroes or chthonic deities in general, is easily refuted by a simple perusal of the representations of sacrifice assembled in this study. The first thing that stands out is, that the altar in almost all instances is a barnas, also in the substantial number of votive reliefs to heroes. Only in the rarest of cases do we fmd an occasional eschara. The one vase painting with a possible representation of a holo-kaustic sacrifice [V382: Kiel B 55] shows an eschdra, which fits in with the old scheme, but is immediately offset by another vase painting [V206: Vatican 17924] where an eschdra is combined with the rite of the splanchna (i.e. participation). A vase painting on a kantharos found in the Mycenaean tomb at Menidi, and therefore to be considered as an illustra-tion of hero cult, has an osphus on a bomos (which, in the old scheme, would be both the wrong type of sacrifice, with participation, and the wrong type of altar). In addition to the representations with sacrificial scenes assembled here, there are many other depictions of altars in combination with iden-tifiable gods. There too, the overwhelming majority of the altars are j.lEv yap Ot 1tpocrj3acrEle; EXOV'tEe;. -Ecrxapav <P11crt KaA.Etcr8al A 'IlKOupyoe; Kat 'Aj.lj.lWVlOe; 'ti]v j.li] EXO'llcrav UIjIOe;, aA.A.' £1tt yfje; tOP'llj.lEV11V· i\\ KoiA.11V. 1tap' 0 Kat 'wue; ia'tpo'l>e; 'to.

FIRE Fire, obviously, is mentioned among the first necessities for burnt sacri-fice.35 The usual thing to do, probably, would have been to bring fire in the form of some glowing charcoal in a portable brazier. 36 Kindling and firewood for a private sacrifice could be brought, or bought for a small sum at the sanctuary. 37 The cost of the considerable amounts of firewood needed for large public sacrifices would soon mount up. 3 8 In any stage of the sacrificial ritual, and indeed in any context at all, altars may be depicted with a blazing fire, as a sort of visual epitheton omans. Now and then a vase painter might add a touch of realism by painting only a small pilot fire on the altar while the sacrifice was in its initial stage.39 Later on, when the god's portion is being burnt on the altar and the splanchna are being roasted, there always is a big fire, and re-markably often the vase painters have taken special trouble to depict the carefully and regularly piled up firewood. It was probably common 33 See r~ferences in Van Straten, BABesch 49 (1974) 187-189. 34 Schlesier, ScrClIsr 11 (1991-92) 38-51, convincingly argues that the Olym-pian/ chthonian distinction cannot be usefully applied to ancien Greek ritual on the strength of the textual evidence either.

GREEKS AT SACRIFICE: MASTERS AND SERVANTS Animal sacrifice in ancient Greece was not a one man' s job. As a mini-mum, two persons are involved: one officiant, nearly always a bearded man, and at least one assistant, who is usually beardless, and whose lesser status in relation to the officiant is indicated by his size, his costume, or both. The officiant is normally dressed in a himation. Only in a very few instances does he wear the long loose chiton that is a typical sacerdotal robe.40 In fact there is only one such unmistakeable priest in the votive reliefs with sacrificial scenes [R95: Eretria 631]. In vase paintings there are perhaps a dozen, often with richly decorated robes.41 As far as we know, there was no general rule that all Greek priests when officiating would always wear such a robe, so it cannot be excluded a priori, that the bearded sacrificers in himation are also priests. In the vase paintings we have little to go on, to fmd out whether they are. If, however, in the votive reliefs we were to take all the bearded sacrificers in himation as priests, that would leave us with a statistically improbable amount of fatherless families of worshippers. The officiant in these private sacrifices would normally be the pater familias. Some sacred laws explicitly grant permission to the worshippers themselves to do SO.42 In vase paintings, the assistants, if they are not naked, may also wear a himation, but more often they are dressed in some kind of working clothes. Some wear a short chiton or a short loin-cloth, which probably means that they are working men or slaves. Sometimes they are equipped with a knife case, indicating their trade as mageiroi or artamoi [Vl3: Athens NM Akr 607; V6: Athens Agora A-P 2197 etc.]. Then again the assistants are young men who have wrapped their himation round their 40 Stengel 1920, 47-48; Mantes 1990; cf. Miller, Hesperia 58 (1989) 313-329. 41 Priests: [V381: Berlin inv. 3232; V286: Boston 00.334 (?); V173: Darmstadt A 1969.4; V224: Florence 5 B 2; V382: Kiel B 55; V182: Laon 37.1041; V184: Lisbon 11.257; V195: Oxford 1911.617; V198: Palermo V 661 a; V39: Paris Louvre FlO (?); V55: Private coll.]. 42 E.g.

PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 169 waist, in which case they may be junior members of the family who, for the occasion, act as acolytes. A passage from Isaios proves that a domestic sacrifice could be performed entirely by members of the family, with the pater familias officiating and the younger members of the family assisting, but that it was rather unusual that no slaves were involved. 43 On votive reliefs, the standard personnel is made up of the maid carrying the kiste, and the male animal handler who also carries the kanoun. From the way they are treated when there is little space, it is clear that they are only there as an almost inevitable extension of the offerings and the ritual implements. The maid would probably be a domestic slave. The animal handler, who wears an exomis44 or a loin-cloth (if any clothes can be seen at all), could also be a domestic slave. But from a number of texts we get the impression, that by the fourth century B.c. it was not uncommon to leave the whole business of fmding a victim, bringing the necessary paraphernalia such as the kanoun with its contents, and doing the slaughtering etc., to a hired mageiros. 45 43 Isaios 8 (nepi roD KipOJvot; KAT/PO V) , 16: 1Ced llEt' E1CEivou tE E9EwPOUllEV 1Ca9TjllEvol 1tap' ai:l'tov, 1Cal ta.<; £Opta.<; ijYOllEV 1tap' E1CEtVOV 1ta.oa<;· tiP ~li tE 9uwv tiP 1Ct\"oicp;1tEpl fiv lla.A,lOt' E1CEtVO<; 9uoiav E01tOUOa~E 1Cal OUtE OOUA,ou<; 1tPOOfjYEV OUtE EA,EU9tpou<; 09VEiou<;, UA,A,' auto<; Ol' £autOu 1ta.vt' E1toiEl, taut,,<; illlEt<; £!COl VWVOUllEV 1Cal ta. tEPa. ouvEXElpoUPYOUllEV 1Cal. oUVEti9EllEV 1Cal tUA,A,a ouv-E1tOlOUllEV, 1Cal \"uXEtO illltV uyiElav ol06val 1Cal 1CtfjOlV uya9Tjv, W01tEP Et1CO<; ovta 1ta.1t1tOV. 44 Basically the exomis is a short chiton fastened on only one shoulder. It is defined as a slave's costume in the scholion on Aristophanes, Vespae 444, but that probably is too specific for the Classical period; rather more generally a working man' s costume, see Vespae 444 and Lysistrata 662. As the \" Old Oligarch\" correctly observes, costume by itself was not sufficient to determine someone's social status in Classical Athens; [Xenophon], \"A 811 vaiOJ v 1Co21'feia I 10: Eo9fjta. tE ya.p ouoev j3EA,tiwv 6 ofjllO<; aUt09l fi Ot OOUA,Ol 1Cal Ot llEtOl1COt 1Cal ta.

Like the short chiton, the exomis was worn by soldiers, who on Attic grave reliefs are sometimes qualified by the inscriptions as Athenian citizens: e .g . Athens NM 953, Kokula 1984, 176 L 74; IG If 7799 (c. 370/360 B .C .) and Paris Louvre 3119, Kokula 1984, 154 L 12; IG IP 6345 (c . 370 B.C.) .

The assistant leads the animal to the altar. The assistant holds kanoun and chernips, so that the officiant can wash his hands and take the olai from the basket. The actual killing may be done by the assistant or by both in collaboration. The butcher's work is done by the assistant; he brings the parts destined for the gods to the officiant, who lays them on the altar. The assistant prepares the thulemata and brings them to the altar in the kanoun. The assistant skewers the splanchna on spits and roasts them over the altar fire. An assistant pours wine from an oinochoe into the cup or phiale held by the officiant, who then makes a libation and says a prayer. And the further cutting up of the animal and roasting and boiling of the meat again is a lot of hard work for the assistants. 5.7. THE CHOICE OF ANIMAL 46 The iconographical data form an important documentary source for the study of ancient Greek sacrifice. Nevertheless, we should be aware of their limitations. We have encountered a vase painting and a votive relief where the victim was clearly characterized as an adult female pig, and probably a pregnant one [V67: Athens NM Akr 636; R58: Athens Akr 581]. But such precision is rare. More often than not it is impossible to ascertain either the sex or the age of the victim, let alone its colour. The sizes of the animals and the other figures in votive reliefs are largely dictated by considerations other than their respective age. The worshippers normally are smaller than the gods, and the attendant with kanoun and victim is smaller, and at times very much smaller, than the other human beings. He is smaller as a consequence of his less important status. He may become excessively small as a result of the limited skill of the artisan in accommodating a sizeable group of worshippers in the confined space of a votive relief. And inevitably the size of the victim is to a large extent 46 Some of the main points in this chapter were first put forward at a conference in UppsaJa in 1985, see Van Straten, in: Linders & Nordquist (eds.) 1987, 159-170. I was pleased to learn that around the same ,time, at another conference, some similar conclu-sions were arrived at by Jameson, starting from another angle; see Jameson, in: Whittaker (ed.) 1988, 87-119. PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 171 determined by the size of its handler. Fortunately the species of animal (bovine, sheep, pig, goat, etc.) is usually unmistakable. On the other hand, iconographical material has its advantages too, not least of which is its quantity. The number of surviving sacrificial represen-tations is such that a quantitative study would seem feasible. Yet, here again we have to be careful. Firstly, it is in the nature of a quantitative study that it will yield a more or less generalized picture of the average Greek's attitude towards the average, most common types of sacrifice. Special and relatively exceptional cases will remain hidden in the crowd, and will have to be studied individually. Secondly, although quite a significant amount of material remains, we must remember that it is only a very small portion of the original bulk, and we cannot possibly be sure whether this surviving portion even approximately fulfils the conditions that real statisticians would like to apply to a \"sample\" in the strictly statistical sense of the word. To minimize the dangers it seems advisable to define the classes of material we will be analyzing as precisely as possible, and to take whatever patterns may emerge as significant only at that conjuncture, when they are quite distinct. In analyzing the relative frequency of various species of sacrificial animals I will for the present purpose limit myself to the three most common types: cattle, sheep and pigs.47 The classes of material that are sufficiently large are vase paintings and votive reliefs. In addition to these archaeological data, we have records of animal sacrifice in inscribed sacrificial calendars. They are sufficient in number for a similar quantita-tive analysis. SacrificiaL caLendars (diagram) The following five Attic sacred laws have been preserved, either virtually complete, or at least to such an extent that they lend themselves to a quantitative analysis. 1. The sacrificial calendar of the deme Thorikos, probably the oldest of the present group (c. 440/420 B.C.).48 47 Goats are never very numerous (c. 13 % in Attic sacred laws, c. 9 % in vase paintings, c. 4% in votive reliefs). They are in the same price class as sheep. The choice of a goat as a sacrificial animal was probably often determined by the nature of the recipient deity; according to the leges sacrae, they were mainly sacrificed to Dionysos, Apollo, Artemis and Aphrodite. 48 SEC 33 (1983) 147.

The sacrificial calendar of the genos of the Salaminioi (36312 B.C.).52 Taken together these inscriptions record slightly more than 200 occa-sions on which animals were sacrificed. Here and elsewhere I have not counted the individual victims, but the occasions on which animals were sacrificed. Thus sacrifices comprising more than one victim are counted as one, and in the diagram they are put in the column of the most expen-sive animal included, but distinguished by a different fill pattern. So they may be disregarded altogether if it is feared that these multiple sacrifices might muddle the issue. The relative frequency of the occurrence of cattle, sheep and pigs, as shown in the diagram, is as follows: bovine 3.5 % (or, if we count the multiple sacrifices, 7.4%), sheep 57% (or 58.4%), pigs 20.8%. The peak of sheep stands out markedly enough to be significant. 53 Vase paintings (diagram) A very different pattern is displayed by the vase paintings. To keep the \"sample\" as close as possible to that of the sacrificial calendars, I have excluded the non-Attic vases. I have also excluded the representations of mythical sacrifices (such as, for instance, Herakles sacrificing on Cbryse). We have seen that these mythical sacrifices in vase painting were usually represented in contemporary Athenian gui~e, and as a source of informa-tion they are certainly not to be neglected, but to keep the quantitative analysis as clean as possible it seems safer to put them on one side for the moment.54 That leaves us with about 115 cases: 54.8% (or, if we include the mUltiple sacrifices, which are strikingly numerous in this class, 61.7%) cattle, 11.3% (or 13%) sheep, and 12.2% pigs. Votive reliefs (diagram) If we pass on to the Classical Greek votive reliefs, another pattern again emerges. Of about 180 cases 7.9% (or 10.1 %) are cattle, 39.9% (or 42.1 %) are sheep, and 43.8 (or 44.4%) are pigs. 52 LSS 19. Ferguson, Hesperia 7 (1938) 1-74; Rosivach 1994, 40-45. 53 If the unspecified adult victims ('ttAEOl) so frequently mentioned in the Thorikos calendar are to be counted as sheep (which is not improbable), the pattern is even more distinctive. 54 Also excluded are the goats under handles and in the context of a komos, where they are not clearly identified as sacrificial animals, The animal skulls that are seen hanging in several sacrificial scenes are not counted either."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"II 'I I 174 CHAPTER FIVE Attic Vase Paintings 70 % ................... ::;:::::;:;:::::;:;:;::::::::::::::::: 50 40 30 20 10 o 50 -% 40 -3 0 20 10 o Legend D Multiple o Single o Votive Reliefs Mainland Greece o Legend D Multiple o Single PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 175 Here one might argue that the evidence is not entirely comparable with the other two classes because the geographical spread is different. The sacred laws and the vase paintings are Attic, and the votive reliefs come from the whole of the Greek world. This discrepancy is not easily elimi-nated because of a practical problem. For many Greek votive reliefs in museums allover the world the provenance is not, or only approximately, known. If we were to restrict ourselves to material that is undoubtedly Attic, the sample would become rather too small. But it is possible to steer a middle course, and count only the votive reliefs from mainland Greece (just under 130 items). In that case there is a more pronounced peak of pigs (46.5 or 47.3 %) as against 32.6 or 35.7% sheep, and 10.1 or 13.2 % cattle. Now when we compare the three sets of material we see that in the sacrificial calendars sheep are clearly predominant, in votive reliefs pigs, and in vase paintings cows and bulls. It might be objected that the three groups of evidence are not entirely compatible. Not only is there a difference in geographical spread, already remarked upon in connection with the votive reliefs, but there are chrono-logical discrepancies as well. The votive reliefs are nearly all of the fourth century B. c., and so are most of the sacrificial calendars (although here many of the regulations may well be older than the inscriptions), whereas the vase paintings are mainly datable to the fifth century B.C. This cannot be helped. However, for our present purpose it is not unreasonable, in my opinion, to look upon the fifth and fourth century as a continuum. In any case, I cannot see how the slight geographical and chronological discrep-ancies we are unable to eliminate might explain the differences in relative frequency of occurrence which we observe. How, then, are these differ-ences to be accounted for? It seems strange, after all, that three classes of evidence which, on the face of it, should reflect the same reality, present such divergent patterns. Prices of victims Some light may be cast on the matter, if we look into the prices of the sacrificial animals. This is not too difficult, as in several sacrificial calendars not only the species of animal to be sacrificed is stipulated, but"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"176 CHAPTER FIVE also its price. 55 The relevant data are tabulated below. 56 PRICES OF VICTIMS IN ATTIC SACRIFICIAL CALENDARS THOR.

IG IP 1635, 35-37, records the purchase for a festival between 377/6 and 375/4 B.C. of 109 bovine victims for the sum of 8419 dr., which amounts to 77.24 dr. per head; in addition, a little more than 125 dr. was spent on gold leaf and salary for the gilder, no doubt to gild the horns of the sacrificial animals. 58 The Eleusinian inscription IG IF 1673, 62, mentions a price of 12 drachmae for sheep and 17 drachmae for a ram. For a new fragment of this inscription, and the probable date 333/332 B.C., see Clinton, AEphem 1971, 83-113; also Clinton, in: Hagg et al. (eds.) 1988, 69 f. 59 Daux, AntCl 52 (1983) 169.

So roughly speaking pigs, sheep, and cattle may be thought of as points on a rising scale of livestock prices. Now let us look more closely at the three classes of evidence: do they really reflect the same reality? We may assume that both the sacrificial calendars and the votive reliefs faithfully recorded sacrifices that had actually been made or had to be made. But there is an important difference. The sacrificial calendars all refer to communal sacrifices, whether the community be the polis, a group of demes, a single deme, or a genos. It so happens that the surviving fragments of the state calendar do not include any of the greater festivals at which large hecatombs were sacri-ficed, and consequently give a distorted view of the sacrifices of the polis. From other inscriptions we may form a picture of the size of these heca-tombs. In 410/9 B.C. for the hecatomb at the Greater Panathenaia 5114 drachmae were made available by the treasurers of Athena. 61 At a price of 50 drachmae a cow, this alone would buy a literal hekatombe, and this number of victims would yet be augmented by the Athenian colonies and the member states of the Delian league, each of whom had to contribute one cow to the Greater Panathenaia.62 For the hecatomb of the Lesser Panathenaia, at some time between 335/4 and 330/29 B.C., 4lO0 drach-mae were provided.63 A little later in the fourth century, a sum of 2000 drachmae was voted for official sacrifices to Agathe Tyche.64 For part of the year 334/3 B.C. we have the records of the receipts for the sale of hides from sacrificial victims by the Athenian state.65 Seven months' worth of hides amounted to a little over 5099 drachmae, equivalent, according to Jameson's calculations, to the hides of between 850 and lOOO full-grown cattle sold by the officials. 66 In view of these data, it would be more accurate to regard the evidence of the sacrificial calendars tabulated above as typical of communal sacri-61 IG P 375, 7-8. 62 IG I' 34 (IG P 66; Meiggs & Lewis 1969, 46); IG I' 46 (IG P 45; Meiggs & Lewis 1969,49); IG I' 71 (IG P 63; Meiggs & Lewis 1969, 69).

The votive reliefs, on the other hand, with hardly any exceptions, are documents of private worship, recording private sacrifices made by in-dividuals or families. \"People should worship the gods and the local heroes, communally in accordance with the ancestral laws, privately according to their means\", Drakon's law stipulates.67 A similar distinction between communal and private sacrifice seems to be implied in an inscrip-tion from Thasos. 68 And throughout the leges sacrae the same principle underlies the very precise prescriptions as to species and price of victims for communal sacrifices listed in the sacrificial calendars, as opposed to the clause that private persons may sacrifice whatever they wish.69 It is only to be expected that, on average, private persons sacrificed cheaper animals than whole demes or other communities, and therefore the propor-tions of sheep and piglets in sacrificial calendars and votive reliefs are naturally different. Vase paintings are another matter altogether. Some vases with scenes of sacrifice may have been ordered as special commissions, to serve as votive gifts commemorating a particular sacrifice.70 Normally, however, the vase painter's choice of subject was guided by other considerations. The workshop would want to produce vases that would sell well, deco-rated with scenes of general interest, which people might find attractive. If, therefore, the vase painter occasionally drew his inspiration not from myth but from contemporary cult, it is obvious that he would prefer to select the more festive occasions with grand and expensive sacrifices in which many people participated.71 This, I think, explains the high density in this class of evidence of expensive cows and bulls and of sacrifices comprising several animals. At this point we may perhaps draw a provisional conclusion.

Each class of evidence has its own peculiarities that should be taken into account. 72 Whether my suggestion is convincing that the value of the victims is of crucial significance remains to be seen. Let me enlarge a little and try to avoid any misunderstandings. There can be absolutely no doubt, of course, that on some specific occasions Ge, for instance, would only accept a black he-goat,73 or Demeter a pregnant ewe,74 and that on other occasions the sacrifice of a particular animal, for instance a pig or a goat, was strictly forbidden.75 But these are special cases, forming a fascinating but relatively small minority, which do not greatly influence the overall picture. It is my contention that for the remaining majority of sacrifices the choice of victim is largely dependent on its value. That the common people in ancient Greece were very much preoccu-pied with the value of their offerings appears from various texts. In a much quoted passage, Theophrastos holds that it is not the plethos of the offerings that counts but the ethos of the sacrificer. 76 His insistence on this point in itself suggests that many people thought otherwise. We have already made our acquaintance with the mikrophil6timos, as portrayed by the same Theophrastos, who, after having sacrificed an ox nails up the skull at his front door, and decorates it with enormous garlands, so that everyone who comes in can see, not just that he has sacrificed, but that he has sacrificed an ox, no less.77 In Aristophanes' Peace Trygaios and his slave start their deliberations as to the type of animal to be slaughtered for the foundation of the cult of Eirene by considering a cow; by way of a joke, however, the cow is discarded in favour of a great fat pig, which in turn is discarded in a similar manner, and eventually a sheep is decided upon.78 Thus, their puns have served to beat down the choice of victim from the most expensive to one in a more popular price class. In the Birds Aristophanes has Pisthe-72 Kadletz 1976 suffers from a lack of discrimination, in this respect. 73 Marathonian Tetrapolis: LS 20, B 17-18: 'tpa:yo<; 1tal1l1£A.a<;. 74 E.g. Thorikos:.

Suppose a man vows an offering to any of you gods, and then, when the time comes-well you know how it is, one excuse or another: 'the gods are patient', he'll say, to quiet his con-science-the miserly rascal. We'll make him pay up. - - -When he' s counting out his money, or lying in his bath, a kite can swoop down, snatch up the price of two sheep, and bring it back to the god con-cerned. ,,79 In Menander' s comedy Pseuderakles a mageiros rather impertinently criticizes his employer who makes a great show of setting several tables for the sacrificial banquet, but sacrifices only one little piglet. 80 A similar criticism is expressed by the same author in his Methe.81 In Herondas' fourth mimiambus the women visiting the temple of Asklepios apologize to the god for their humble gift, a cock and a votive tablet. \"For\" -they say-\"we are women of slender means, otherwise we might have offered an ox or a fattened pig. ,,82 Value obviously mattered. To put it more bluntly, sacrificial animals were often thought of in terms of quantity of meat, rather than individual beings with specific biological characteris-tics.83 Sheep at two prices In the sacrificial calendars there are various expressions for young and not so young lambs (ot<; AEt7toyvcOIlOlV, ap\"v, allv6<;), rams (lCpt6<;, oi<; apPTJv), and pregnant ewes (oi<; lCuouocx/hKiIIlOlV), each with its own price, but OIS without further specification regularly comes in two prices. What might be the difference between a cheaper and a more expensive OIS? Several scholars have remarked on this phenomenon, but always in passing, as it were, without really going into the subject. It has been suggested that the difference in price corresponds to a difference in age or 79 Aristophanes, Aves 1616-1625. 80 Menander, Pseuderakles fr. 451 Koerte. 81 Menander, Methe fr. 264 Koerte.

This explanation, which has been put forward tentatively by George Daux,85 and more firmly by Sterling Dow, 86 seems to find support in the fact that in all cases, without any exceptions, the more expensive OIS is destined for a male deity and the cheaper one for a female deity. So we are reminded of the ancient rule, usually quoted in the words of Amobius, that to female deities female victims are sacrificed, male victims to male deities.87 The exceptions to this rule are far from rare, yet enough of a minority to warrant the use of the word \"rule\", as has been shown by E. Kadletz in his dissertation. 88 Still, there remains a difficulty.

PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 183 male god is in fact a ram, what about the kri6s and the OIS arren that are mentioned in the same sacrificial calendars, and which are sometimes priced even higher than the god's 01S?89 Indeed, if we disregard the lambs and the pregnant ewes, the sacrificial calendars confront us not with a bipartition of the adult sheep population, but with a division into three groups, namely two large groups of unspecified OIS sacrificed respectively to gods and goddesses, and a much smaller group of definitely male sheep or rams (OIS arren, kri6s). It might help us to understand this tripartition, if we were more famil-iar with the practical details of flock management in Classical Greece. Unfortunately, there is very little information on the subject pertaining to the Classical period.90 However, it may be worthwhile to go back to an earlier period in Greek history. The Linear B archives of Mycenaean Knossos contain records of numerous flocks of sheep. The sheep ideogram used in these tablets differentiates between male and female sheep. 1. T. Killen has convincingly, and indeed brilliantly, argued that the male-sheep-ideogram could also be used, and was in fact generally used, to 89 The only kri6s that is cheaper than the more expensive ois is in the Erchia calendar: LS 18 E 58 (I follow Sokolowski's line numbering). However, the text as published by Daux, BCH 87 (1963) 603-634, may need correction. Under the heading, the Erchia inscription has five columns; all are inscribed stoichedon, with II letters per line in column A, 10 letters per line in columns B-Ll, and 9 letters per line in column E. The text being inscribed in the usual scriptio continua, any word may be divided and wrapped to the next line at any point, so there should be no problem in keeping to a strict stoichedon pattern. There is one exception: the prices of the victims are given as numerals, composed of acrophonic signs (e.g. r for 1tEV\"tE, t;, for OEK<X, etc.), and these numerals are never split up over two lines. To keep all the signs of a numeral together, the stone cutter has, on several occasions, had to cramp one or two more letters into a line than would have been normal for that column, and then the letters inevitably are slightly out of line with those on the lines above and below (some examples from column E on the right, where the standard number of letters per line is nine: line 30 eleven letters, line 38 ten letters). Now, if we look at line E 58 in the same column, we may observe that the last letter on the right (t;,: being the price of the ram in question) is slightly out of line, to the left, with the corresponding letters above and below (see photographs in Daux p. 605 fig. I, and pI. XIV). As it stands, this line has the standard number of 9 letters. The obvious reason for its irregularity is , that originally it had one or two extra letters that are now lost on the right (the right edge of the stone is chipped at this point). In the context the most likely restoration for the numeral at the end of line E 58 would be either t;,(~~] or t;,[rJ, i.e. a price of 12 or 15 drachmae for our ram. 90 See the contributions of Hodkinson and Jameson in Whittaker 1988; Isager & Skydsgaard 1992, 83-104, 19 I -198; also, on flock sizes in Classical Greece, Alcock et al., in: Morris (ed.) 1994, 153."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"I I I I : I I I I' ! IIII I 184 CHAPTER FIVE describe wethers (that is castrated rams).91 His argument is based on the internal evidence of the tablets, on the ethological characteristics of ewes and rams, and on a comparison with ancient Near Eastern and medieval English records of flock management. It appears that in Late Bronze Age Crete the sheep population consisted of large flocks of wethers and ewes, and a much smaller number of rams needed for breeding purposes. The advantages of keeping wethers were, among other things, their higher wool yield and the superior quality of their mutton. Unfortunately, detailed information such as is contained in the Knossos tablets is not available for the Classical period. Flock management is not a subject often discussed by the Classical authors, and on the few occa-sions that they have something to say on the subject, knowledge of such infrastructural data as the composition of the sheep population is taken for granted. Nevertheless, several passages in Aristotle, Varro, Columella, Pliny and Galen imply that large flocks of wethers were kept throughout antiquity and that the castration of male lambs was a regularly recurring large-scale operation. 92 Against this background it would seem likely that the two large groups of unspecified ofs mentioned in the Attic sacred laws as victims for gods and goddesses respectively were taken from the flocks of wethers and ewes. So unless it was explicitly stipulated that the victim should be enorches, an ofs arren, or a krios, the sheep normally sacrificed to gods would be wethers. 91 Killen, BSA 59 (1964) 1-15. 92 Aristotle, Historia animalium 632 a; Varro, De re rustica II 2 , 18; Columella, see G.

The knife is interpreted by Robert, Etudes anatoliennes (1937) 206: \"lise peut que se soit un couteau a chatrer les moutons, comme on me Ie suggere.\" Waelkens, Ancient Society 8 (1977) 286 accepts this possibility. Pfuhl & Mobius disagree: \"Schwerlich zum Kastrieren, das pflegt bei Widdern mit Steinen zu geschehen\", but this would seem to be refuted by the Greek usage of EK'tEj.lVElV and its derivatives for \"castrating\" etc. On the castration of young bulls see also Georgoudi 1990, 218-219 and 280-282. PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 185 In a time when much of the material we have been discussing was still unknown, both Stengel and Ziehen were convinced that castrated animals could be sacrificed in ancient Greece. Stengel refers to the Molpai-inscrip-tion from Miletus,93 where a hekatombe is mentioned consisting of three adult animals of which one is to be female (tMlu) and one an uncastrated male (enorches). Nothing is said about the third. \"Das dritte ist also kastriert\", Stengel remarks.94 I am not sure that his logic is entirely impeccable on this point, for it might also be argued that the sex of the third animal was thought immaterial. Ziehen writes: \"1m allgemeinen waren kastrierte Tiere nicht Grundsatzlich verboten, wass schon daraus hervorgeht, dass die Opfer-Gesetze bisweilen ausdriicklich nichtkastrierte Tiere (enorcha) verlangten. ,,95 But is not it an appalling, even sacrilegious, thought that castrated animals should be sacrificed to the gods? Are not there several texts, from Aristotle down to Pollux' Onomastikon, insisting that sacrificial animals should be perfect and undamaged?96 That is certainly true, although the explicit interdiction of castrated animals is, as far as I know, only found in post-classical texts. But theory and practice do not always coincide, as we saw above in the matter of the victims' alleged willingness to go to the sacrifice. And as far as our wethers are concerned, the matter may also be looked at from another angle. If there is any truth in my earlier assump-tion that, on average, a sacrificial animal was largely looked upon as a certain quantity of meat, then wethers might even be considered more perfect, in their own way, than uncastrated animals. According to Aris-totle \"All animals, if castrated when they are young, become bigger and 93 LSA 50, 18-20. 94 Stengel 1910, 191. 95 Ziehen, RE XVIII 593. 96 E.g.

THE CHOICE OF MOMENT When a vase painter set himself to decorate a pot, or a sculptor to carve a votive relief, with a sacrificial scene, one of the decisions he had to make was, which moment in the sequence of sacrificial ritual he would depict. The word \" moment\" in this context must be taken in a broad sense. The relief or vase painting need not necessarily have the typical qualities of a photographic snapshot; the artisan could take the liberty to combine in one picture elements of the ritual that were not strictly simulta-neous. We have indeed seen such synoptic pictures, but it must be said that they never stray very far from the concept of a unity of time. If we stay with the rough division of the sacrificial ritual into a pre-kill, kill, and post-kill phase, we may observe that these three phases, or two of the three, were never conflated into a single picture. So clearly the artisan chose, if not a precise moment, at least one of the three main stages of the ceremony. The question arises, whether anyone phase was chosen more often than the others, and whether different classes of material display different patterns of preference. Vase paintings (diagram) If we do not count mythical sacrifices and representations where sacrifice is only a secondary subject (in these cases the choice of moment might be determined by elements that have nothing to do with the sacrifice itself), and if we also ignore some dubious examples, there remains a total of 155 Attic black and red figure vase paintings depicting sacrifice. Of these 55.5% are pre-kill; 4.5 % kill; 40% post-kill. Votive reliefs (diagram) Classical Greek votive reliefs show a markedly different pattern. Of a total of close to 200,99% are pre-kill; 0 .5(?)% kill; 0.5(?)% post-kill. The dubious 0 .5 % for kill and post-kill each represent one relief: [R225: 97 Aristotle.

The 4 .5 % (equalling 7 representations) in vase paint-ings may even be a little inflated. In this group I have not only included pictures of the precise moment that the killing instrument (axe or knife) hits or pierces the body of the victim, but also those showing the immedi-ately preceding moment. Furthermore, two of the seven probably depict sphagia before a battie, and therefore refer to an entirely different kind of ritual than the festive sacrifices that are the subject of most or all of the other representations. If a vase painter chose to paint sphagia, he could hardly get round depicting the killing itself. Two other representations of the killing have the additional attraction of the lifting of the bull. So all"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"188 CHAPTER FIVE things considered, the amount of interest in the killing as such is remark-ably unimpressive. For the under-representation of the moment of killing various, even conflicting, explanations might be proposed. The most straightforward one would be: lack of interest in this particular aspect of sacrifice on the part of those Greeks whose religious beliefs are reflected in this material, shall we say, the common people in the Classical period. At first sight this view might seem to be opposed to Burkert's conception of the \"Opfertotung\" as \"Grunderlebnis des Heiligen\".99 However, the two need not be irrecon-cilable. That part of the ritual that may have been the predominant element in the remote past, and perhaps was still felt to be crucial at least by some Classical Greeks whose ideas have survived in our literary sources, could well have been of little interest to the mass of the people, whose votive reliefs and vase paintings we have. In addition to their common lack of interest in the killing itself, votive reliefs and vase paintings share a preference for the pre-kill phase. Vase paintings display a little more variety in the depiction of this phase, in particular by the addition of the washing of the hands in the vessel with water specially provided for that purpose (the cMrnips). This motif is not found on votive reliefs. 100 But why should representations on votive reliefs be nearly 100 % pre-kill, whereas in vase painting a considerable portion, though still a minor-ity, is post-kill? We must try and explain that difference starting from the respective functions and uses of these two classes of material. Votive reliefs with sacrificial representations would usually be set up in a sanctuary by private persons to keep alive the memory of a real sacrifice. In a monument of this kind, certain essential pieces of informa-tion are indispensable, such as the species of animal sacrificed. For this, as we saw in the previous section, was at the same time an indication of its value. In the final phase of the sacrificial ritual, after the animal had been killed and cut in pieces, the species would no longer be easily recogniz-able. 99 Burkert 1972, 9-10: \"Grunderlebnis des 'Heiligen' ist die OpfertOtung. Der homo religiosus agiert und wird sich seiner selbst bewusst als homo necans. Dies ist ja 'Handeln' schlechthin, pt~£lV, operari-woraus das Lehnwort 'Opfer' iibernommen ist-, eine Benennung, die den Kern ctieses 'Handelns' euphemistisch verschweigt.\" See Dumbrowski, Numen 23 (1976) 136-144, and Burkert's reply, Numen 25 (1977) 77-79. 100 The vessel may possibly occur once: [R8: Athens NM 1333]. PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 189 Now what about the vase paintings? The vase painter in principle is much freer in the choice of his subject than the carver of votive reliefs. He is not usually very much of an original, inventive artist, but rather an artisan, working within a traditional framework, and catering for the demands of the general public, following the current contemporary ideas, conceptions and prejudices. Seen in that light, what is there in the post-kill phase of sacrificial ritual that would make it an attractive subject for producers and buyers of pots? If we survey the relevant vase paintings, two recurring features that would have been of interest to the general public in ancient Greece catch the eye. 101 Firstly, the splanchn6ptai: acolytes who roast the inner organs of the victim, skewered on spits, over the altar fire. After they were done, part of the splanchna was given to the gods and the rest, while still warm, was immediately consumed on the spot by the sacrificers, who accompa-nied this rite by prayers and libations. The type of Greek sacrifice under discussion, where the victim was shared out among the recipient god and the human participants in the ritual, brought about a kind of communion, between the gods and the sacrificers, and among the human participants themselves. 102 As Eryximachos in Plato's Symposium puts it: sacrifices are all about the communion between gods and men.103 This communion is 101 The Attic vase paintings with post-kill sacrificial representations break down as follows: the splanchna (alone or with the osphus) are depicted on over 75 % of this group, the osphUs (alone or with the splanchna) on nearly 50 %; the opening up of the carcass or the extraction of the inner organs is depicted on c. 6 %; the post-splanchnal or taratalla-representations are a mere 5 % (if we exclude the pictures that lack an explicit reference to the sacrificial ritual). 102 Demosthenes, 19 (IlEpi -rik trapaJrpEa/3£iac;): 190 EYro Ii' otli' o'u nav'tEe; Ot 1tpu'taVEte; SUOUOt v EKao'to'tE KOt vfi Kelt OUVIiEt1tVOUOt v aAA\"AOte; Kelt ouontvliouOlV' Kelt o-illita 'teluS' Ot XPTlo'tOt 'toue; novTlPOUe; l1t1lOUV'telt, aU' Eav alitKOuv'tel Aaj3wol nVel el1l't&V, 'tfi j30UAfi Kelt 'tiilli\"I1C!lIiTlAouotv. \" j3oUAT] 'tel-ll'ta 'telu'tel, Eiot't\"ptel eSUOE, oUVEtOnaSTI, onovli&v, tEp&V EKOtVroVTlOEV.

As part of the standard portion of the gods, and the most readily recognizable part at that, this represents a motif the inclusion of which would need no further justification. There is, however, the additional point of interest (perhaps even the main point), that the curling up of the tail in the fire constituted a favourable sign. Observing the signs and establishing that the sacrifice was favourably accepted, was of course of major importance in public sacrificial ceremo-nies. Certain officials were appointed to report to the boule that the sacrifice had been successful; the standard phrase for this was ta hiera kala.

PRE-KILL TO POST-KILL 191 honoured for the discharge of their religious duties with appropriate philotimia. Among these religious duties the act of reporting the hiera kala is mentioned regularly. 108 Before the Hellenistic period, as Rhodes puts it, honours were not awarded, or at any rate their award was not published, on such slight pretexts.109 To make a lot of fuss about making such a report is indeed considered a sign of mikrophilotimia by Theophrastos.l1o We have no reason to assume that mikrophil6timoi (men who glory in petty distinctions), or for that matter any of Theophrastos' other charac-ters, were particularly rare in Classical Athens. Of the variety of possible signs that could be observed during the burning of the god's portion on the altar, the vase painters always chose to depict that given by the tail, probably because anyone, like the farmer Trygaios and his slave in Aristophanes' Peace, could recognize it, and one did not need to be an expert to be able to interpret it. If the firewood had been skilfully arranged so that the fire burned properly, and the tail curled up in the heat, any Athenian could see that the sacrifice was well received. We may imagine them standing round the altar in their best himatia, and when the tail had given good signs, announcing to their friends: ta hiera kaM. And later on, when they had gone home, like Theophrastos' man of petty ambition they would tell their wives what a marvellous day it had 108 Extensive lists in Rhodes 1972, 132 note 6-17.

The sort of occasion it would be nice to be reminded of by the pictures on one's pottery. To sum up. The vase paintings testify to a fairly broad interest in the various aspects of sacrificial ritual. People who appreciated watching the enactment of prolonged stretches of ritual during the performance of a comic play, would be willing buyers of such products. Votive reliefs rather one-sidedly depict the sacrificial ritual as the bringing of a gift of a certain value to the god, as part of a continuous exchange of gifts and favours between the god and his worshipper. 111 III Cf.

The descriptive notes and the references have been kept to (what is hoped to be an efficient) minimum. The abbreviation \"bov.» is used for any bovine animal, since specific terms like bull, cow or ox would often imply more than can be seen. In Catalogue I, the vase paintings are arranged in broad iconographical groups, and within these by region of manufacture. For the sake of compari-son I have included representations that lack an animal, but have either a kanoun or a liknon (these may refer to non-animal offerings). In Catalogue II, the votive reliefs are arranged according to recipient deities and sanctuaries of provenance, in so far as these are known. Here I have included representations that lack an animal, but have the maid carrying the kfste, or a table loaded with sacrificial cakes etc., clearly referring to non-animal offerings."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"VI V2 V3 V4 I I I V5 CA T ALOGUE I: V ASE PAINTINGS Pre-kill Aigina Att. bf. skyphos (fL).
