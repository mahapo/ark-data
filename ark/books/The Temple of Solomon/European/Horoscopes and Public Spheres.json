DARREL RUTKIN, and KOCKU VON STUCKRAD 1. \"The Study of Wretched Subjects\" \"A savoir, qu'on ne perd pas son temps en recherchant a quoi d'autres ont perdu le leur\"—with these words Auguste Bouche-Leclercq (1842-1924) justified his pioneering monograph on the history of Greek astrology (Bou-che-Leclercq 1899, ix). For a classical scholar of his time, astrological sources were obviously somewhat offensive. In the nineteenth century only a very few scholars called for an unprejudiced assessment, such as the mathe-matician and historian of science, Siegmund Günther (1848-1923). He ar-gued for thorough research into the history of astrology and astronomy as part of a general cultural history already in 1876 (Günther 1876a, 124 and 128; 1876b, 306). Astrology, left behind by modern astronomy and astro-physics, was generally looked upon condescendingly as a curious aberration of the human mind undeserving of serious consideration. But only a short time later, at the beginning of the twentieth century, there was notable pro-gress. Aby Warburg's (1866-1929) legendary 1912 lecture on the fresco cy-cle in the Palazzo Schifanoia and the pictorial tradition of its astrological motifs was a milestone (Warburg 1998ff.; see Bertozzi 1985). With his study Heidnisch-antike Weissagung in Wort und Bild zu Luthers Zeiten (1920, see Warburg 1999), Aby Warburg broke new ground for a serious assessment of the role of astrological iconography in the Renaissance, which he interpreted as a conscious revival of ancient paganism. Subsequently other Warburg scholars, notably Ernst Cassirer and Eugenio Garin, paved the way for a fuller understanding of astrology in Renaissance culture (Cassirer 1964 [1927]; Garin 1983 [1976]). Ancient astrology saw similar progress. Franz Cumont (1868-1947) and Franz Boll (1867-1923) systematically edited the corpus of Greek astro-logical texts (Corpus codicum astrologorum Graecorum) during the first half of the twentieth century (Cumont et al. 1898-1953). A classical philologist, Boll devoted his research activities almost exclusively to the history of as-trology. The same is true for Wilhelm Gundel and his son, Hans Georg (see particularly Gundel and Gundel 1966).

Darrel Rutkin, and Kocku von Stuckrad Thorndike (1882-1965) laid new textual and bibliographic foundations with his encyclopedic History of Magic and Experimental Science (1923-1958), which surveyed no less than seventeen centuries. Thorndike unearthed a great wealth of original sources—mainly in manuscripts—that were hitherto ne-glected or completely unknown. Nevertheless, historians of science (includ-ing Thorndike) often had trouble accurately interpreting and assessing astrological evidence, which, in 1951, George Sarton (1884-1956) univer-sally dismissed as \"superstitious flotsam of the Near East.\" This remark pro-voked Otto Neugebauer's (1889-1990) famous reply, \"The Study of Wretched Subjects,\" in which he emphasized the importance of astrological concepts for Hellenistic and Arabic astronomy, and the fact that astrological sources provided crucial evidence for reconstructing (inter alia) the transmis-sion of ancient astronomy to India (Neugebauer 1951). We should no longer need excuses or apologies. The history of astrol-ogy as an important element of western science and culture has received much scholarly attention in recent decades, some of the highest quality. Nev-ertheless, scholars writing on astrology today still encounter numerous prob-lems and prejudices. The reasons are manifold, but two elements stand out as particularly important from an analytical point of view: problems of ontology (concerning astrology's ontological status) and strategies of 'othering.' As far as ontological issues are concerned, historians of astrology are asked time and again, \"do you believe in these things?,\" a question with which historians of alchemy, mathematics, or Christianity are not usually confronted. Al-though the personal opinions of historians of astrology are not unimportant— as they might influence historical interpretations—the ontological status of the planets and their presumed influence and meaning, as well as whether astrology actually 'works,' are not directly addressed in historiographical research.1 Historically meaningful and interesting are questions such as: Why and how have people used astrological methods and assumptions to interpret the past, present, and future? How and why do normative views about astrol-ogy change over time? On a deeper level of analysis, the question of astrology's ontological status reveals a strategy of 'othering' and a discourse of inclusion and exclu-sion that has had significant impact on the academic study of astrology. While astronomy and astrology had both been part of the canon of legitimate bodies of knowledge (artes liberales) for centuries, epistemological and dis-ciplinary transformations (reconfigurations) associated with the eighteenth-and nineteenth-century Enlightenment encouraged a dismissive attitude that distinguished legitimate from illegitimate knowledge in different ways than they had previously been distinguished, framing the debate polemically in 1 This misunderstanding is a characteristic of battles between 'believers' and 'non-believers' of astrology that are fought out on the fields of social scientific research in particular; see von Stuckrad 2003b, 357-368.

These terms, which became instruments of analysis in subsequent aca-demic disciplines, reflect the socio-professional identities and conceptual perspectives of 'modern' people who view themselves as progressive, ra-tional, and enlightened, against which the 'other' was constructed as a neces-sary counterpart. In the wake of the 'cultural turn' in the humanities, however, scholars have turned their critical attentions toward analyzing and articulating the strategies of distancing that underlie these processes of iden-tity formation. For example, Charles Zika argues that, with the help of such scholarly models of interpretation, Europe exorcised her demons to the mar-gins of power, subsequently endeavoring to ensure their distance: \"We exor-cise them [the demons] to the geographical, cultural and chronological margins—to the underdeveloped, the poor, the disadvantaged, the colonized; to the primitive, the savage, the uncivilised; to the medieval imaginary of magic and mysticism and dark age barbarism\" (Zika 2003, 4). Martin Pott analyzes the construction of 'superstition' with reference to the Enlighten-ment movement that was at the same time a \"battle community\" (Kampfge-meinschaft)2 When approached from contemporary critical perspectives, the impact of these processes becomes visible: the discourses of inclusion and exclusion that fostered identities of 'modernity' and 'science' during the last two centu-ries have contributed to distorting the scholarly understanding of astrology and other 'wretched subjects' (see also von Stuckrad 2000, 55-68). In a dis-course of power, not only the themes but the scholars engaged with them have been marginalized and 'distanced,' tinged, as it were, with their sub-ject's lunacy. The production of scholarly historical knowledge is by no means an innocent or neutral endeavor.3 Consequently, every serious aca-demic study of astrology has to include in its historical analysis an element of reflection that is aware of the precarious—often polemical—status of its in-struments of analysis. Instead of fixating on underlying ontological commit-ments in favor of or against astrological truth claims, discourse analysis 2 \"Stärker als andere Bewegungen der Kulturgeschichte ist die Aufklärung zugleich auch eine Kampfgemeinschaft, die ihre Geschlossenheit nicht zuletzt durch be-stimmte Feindbilder gewinnt\" (Pott 1992, 2). 3 This was noted by Paul Feyerabend in his critique of the \"Statement of 186 Leading Scientists\" against astrology (1975), including eighteen Nobel Prize winners. \"The learned gentlemen have strong convictions, they use their authority to spread these convictions (why 186 signatures if one has arguments?), they know a few phrases which sound like arguments, but they certainly do not know what they are talking about\" (Feyerabend 1978, 91). To be sure, Feyerabend did not intend his critique as a defense of modern astrology (nor do we thus intend these essays, although indi-vidual authors personally may): \"It is interesting to see how closely both parties ap-proach each other in ignorance, conceit and the wish for easy power over minds\" (ibid., 96).

The Status of Astrology in European Culture The discourses of inclusion and exclusion that accompany processes of mod-ern identity formation have also affected the way scholars describe the status of astrology in western cultural history. Besides labels such as 'pseudo-science' or 'superstition,' astrology has often been called an 'occult science.' This term seems to have originated in the sixteenth century (Secret 1988, 7), along with notions of occulta philosophia. Occult,' in this context, refers to hidden or secret powers that inform a substantial part of the disciplines lumped together under the rubric 'occult sciences'—notably astrology, al-chemy, and (natural) magic.5 Twentieth-century scholars turned this rubric from an emic (an \"insider's\") into an etic (an \"outsider's\") category, indicat-ing a 'unity' of these various disciplines. While Keith Thomas (1971, 63 If.) believed that astrology formed the basis of the occult sciences—and that con-sequently the 'decline' of astrology would inevitably lead to the decline of magic and alchemy—Brian Vickers (1988, 286) encouraged this tendency by arguing that all 'occult sciences' share a common \"mentality\" that is clearly distinguished from a rational 'scientific' mentality (see also Vickers 1984). Such a distinction is problematic for several reasons. First, although these disciplines overlap in varied and complex ways, all of them have dis-tinct histories with quite different and complex, multiply branching and mu-tually interacting trajectories. \"Even during the heyday of Renaissance neoplatonism, astrology and alchemy lived independent lives, despite the vast inkwells devoted to the rhetorical embellishment of occult philosophy\" (Newman and Grafton 2001, 26; see the whole passage pp. 18-27). Second, there are other disciplines and practices that had direct and longstanding links to astrology, notably, mathematics, philosophy (natural and moral), medicine, historiography, theology, and politics. Configuring astrology with the other so-called 'occult sciences' as a first interpretive move (consciously or uncon-sciously) tends strongly to distort our understanding of its relationship with these other (and to many scholars more legitimate) areas of knowledge. Third, the analytical notion of 'hidden powers' continues to remain important within the 'legitimate sciences' from the 'scientific revolution' to the present. One could even argue that contemporary science, from quantum mechanics to 4 On the discursive implications of self-reflection, which has to be applied recur-sively, see von Stuckrad 2003a. 5 In an influential work, Wayne Shumaker (1972) also adds witchcraft to this me-lange.

Hanegraaff notes: [I]n a context that insisted on science as a public and demonstrable rather than secret and mysterious knowledge, the very notion of \"science\" came to be seen as incompatible ex prin-ciple with anything called \"occult\". As a result, any usage of the term \"occult science(s)\" henceforth implied a conscious and intentional polemic against mainstream or establishment science. Such polemics are typical of occultism in all its forms. (Hanegraaff 2005, 887) Hence, relating astrology closely to magic or other 'occult sciences' is a quite modern configuration, reflecting again a discourse of identity formation through strategies of distancing. Against this, some scholars have recently pointed out that astrology is more accurately configured with mathematics, natural philosophy, and medicine (Rutkin 2002; see also Monica Azzolini's contribution to the present volume), and that 'esoteric discourse' transgresses the boundaries between science, theology, and other cultural systems of knowledge (von Stuckrad 2004, 100-159). 3. Horoscopes and Public Spheres Despite these difficulties, the scholarly study of the history of astrology has taken enormous strides during the last century. Scholars have become in-creasingly aware that \"[t]rying to understand the society and culture of early modern Europe without taking astrology into account is exactly as plausible as trying to understand modern society without examining the influence of economics and psychoanalysis\" (Newman and Grafton 2001, 14). A similar case can be made for the ancient, medieval, and modern eras. Perhaps sur-prisingly, however, the particular role of horoscopes in public and private discourse has only rarely been explicitly addressed by historians.7 The pre-sent volume intends to cast new light on this issue, combining historical case studies and methodological reflections. Although every author of this volume shares the opinion that astrology is a significant feature of western cultural history, the fourteen chapters reflect a variety of approaches and perspectives, 6 We do not mean, of course, to equate quantum mechanics and astrology, as Land-scheidt 1994 tried to do. Scientific knowledge in physics is demonstrable and open to falsification, which is not the case in any obvious way with astrological knowl-edge, efforts to the contrary from John Goad to Michel Gauquelin notwithstanding. We refer here only to the fact that modern physics operates with 'hidden powers' such as quarks or \"strings\" that are necessary assumptions of theory, but are invisi-ble and only indirectly demonstrable. 7 Notable exceptions are North 1986 and Holden 1996; see also various essays in Nauta and Vanderjagt 1999.

Darrel Rutkin, and Kocku von Stuckrad ranging from in-depth philological analysis to cultural criticism. Indeed, the editors themselves represent three different but complementary approaches. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach is more beneficial than prob-lematic, however, revealing as it does both the richness of the topics ad-dressed and the range of roles astrology played in western culture. In this light, some preliminary remarks will be useful to help orient the reader. As the title Horoscopes and Public Spheres indicates, this volume ap-proaches astrology as a key element of public discourse. Such an approach is not as self-evident as it might seem. It responds to recent developments in the academic study of religion that abandon older concepts of 'religion' as 'be-lief and 'inner states of mind' in favor of 'religion' as a communicational, public, and processual positioning (see Kippenberg and von Stuckrad 2003). With regard to astrology in general, and horoscopes in particular, this leads to new questions: Although the analysis of concrete astrological sources in pre-cise historical contexts remains fundamental, these analyses are carried out not only for their own sake, but also to gain accurate access to the functions and roles astrology played in a given cultural context. The communicative aspect of horoscopes, their public presentation, and the discourses of identity that attach to them are given greater emphasis. On a theoretical level, the general topic \"Horoscopes and Public Spheres\" has at least four different and overlapping dimensions: Horoscopes as historical sources addresses the question of how the study of nativities can enrich historical research. Horoscopes can be regarded as a highly specialized genre of historical narrative that needs to be applied by historians in different ways than other source material (see Oestmann 2004, 16-29). How can horo-scopes be scrutinized in order to understand and reconstruct historical events? In addition, the importance of horoscopes for the history of mathematics, medicine, and other modes of natural knowledge is at issue here. Moreover, horoscopes as astronomical sources refers (inter alia) to the astronomical parameters which underlie nativities. Any astrological interpretation relies on astronomical data, from which certain techniques for predicting (e.g.) the development of the native and future events have been derived. How are these parameters deduced and interpreted, and how are they employed in spe-cific astrological techniques and calculations? Horoscopes as rhetorical de-vices considers the role of horoscopes in political and public discourse. Publishing imperial nativities and publically debating the horoscopes of reli-gious leaders were two ways representatives of social elites used horoscopes to claim superiority over political and religious opponents. Likewise, annual prognostications published in almanacs were often used on both sides of po-litical power struggles (see, e.g., Curry 1989). Finally, horoscopes and bio-graphical narrative is closely related to the other approaches but stresses the role of horoscopes for constructing coherent and meaningful individual biog-raphies.

The present volume aims to explore the role of horoscopes in histori-cal research and to apply these considerations to concrete case studies in dif-ferent cultural contexts. The contributions cover a broad period of time— from classical antiquity through the nineteenth century. Part I engages as-trology's eminence in Roman antiquity. Nativities of high-ranking individu-als—particularly the emperor—played a crucial role in political and religious discourses. In their respective contributions, W. Hübner, J.-Η. Abry, and St. Heilen focus on the rhetorics involved in interpreting imperial nativities. At the same time, they demonstrate how important astrological sources can be for gaining new insights into significant episodes in ancient history. N. Cam-pion then casts an interesting (perhaps controversial) light on Babylonian astrology's influence on Christianity's quarrel with paganism. Taking the coronation horoscopes of the rebel pagan emperors Basiliscus and Leontius as his point of departure, Campion argues for a surviving tradition of Baby-lonian astrological practice, linked to astral religion, that flourished within a Neoplatonic philosophical context in the fifth century CE. In part II, four chapters address the influence of astrological interpre-tive techniques in medieval Islamic and Jewish discourses. While D. Pingree outlines the importance of Mäshä'alläh as a link connecting eastern and western astrological traditions, E. Orthmann and A. Caiozzo break new ground for understanding the dynamics of astrological argumentation in me-dieval Muslim public spheres, as well as the cosmological visions that astrol-ogy inspired and enhanced. J. Rodriguez-Arribas then demonstrates that important Jewish authors of the Middle Ages interpreted biblical chronology in terms of mundane astrology, thus indicating that biblical narrative and sci-entific exploration were seen as mutually informative and complementary means of constructing a coherent Jewish identity. Part III investigates various aspects of horoscopic astrology in early modern Europe. Focusing on Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Francis Bacon, H. D. Rutkin provides an integrated portrait of various uses horo-scopes had in Renaissance culture, indicating both technical aspects and socio-political contexts. M. Azzolini explores the strong bonds between as-trology and medicine in the Renaissance and, in particular, the political di-mensions of courtly medical practice. St. vanden Broecke analyzes the place of evidence and conjecture in Girolamo Cardano's horoscope collection, and thus offers a fresh approach to practical and social aspects of early modern astrological interpretation. Both he and Azzolini insightfully discuss the medical theory of critical days. K. von Stuckrad also takes Cardano as his point of departure, but now examines literary and rhetorical functions of horoscope interpretation in autobiographical narrative from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries.

It was forbidden, of course, to publish the nativity of an emperor,1 but voluntary self-restraint protected the privacy of individuals as well. If we disregard the horoscope cast for Antio-chos of Commagene, which was probably not a birth horoscope, but a coro-nation chart,2 there remain only a few individuals whose horoscopes were published with their proper name, as that of Manetho in the sphragis of his didactic poem,3 that of the orator Aelius Aristides in a dream of the fourth sacred speech,4 that of Hephaestio as an example in his astrological manual,5 and that of Proclus published in the Vita by his pupil Marinus.6 Because most horoscopes in the astrological manuals have been transmitted anonymously, modern curiositas often tried to find out which individual might be hidden under the anonymous data. In earlier times the tables established by Paul Victor Neugebauer (Neugebauer 1912) or Bryant Tuckerman (Tuckerman 1964) rendered possible the dating of horoscopes.

The Horoscope In 1996 James Herschel Holden tried to identify two other nativities transmit-ted by Firmicus Maternus in his Mathesis. The first one opens the final chap-ter of book 6. Here is the text in his fairly stilted language:13 si Saturnus in Libra fuerit constitutus, infinibus scilicet Iovis et in altitudine sua, et in eadem parte horoscopus fuerit inventus, in Ariete vero Venus constituta horoscopum ex occasu dia-metra radiatione respiciat, Mars vero et Luna aequata partium societate coniuncti in MC [Medio Caelo] sint partiliter collocati, Sol vero et Mercurius in Geminis constituti nonum ab horoscopo locum teneant, Iupiter vero in Aquario positus et stationem faciens quintum geni-turae possederit locum, haec genitura potentissimum regni decernit Imperium, vel potentis dignitatis decernit insignia. If Saturn has come into Libra, that is, in the region of Jupiter and in its exaltation, and if the ascendant has been found in the same degree, (if) Venus in Aries aspects the ascendant with her opposite rays (shining) from the setting house, (if) Mars and the moon, conjoined by an equal partnership of degrees, are located in a partile conjunction in the midheaven, (if) the sun and Mercury, dwelling in Gemini, hold the ninth house from the ascendant, (if) Jupiter, situated in Aquarius and being stationary occupies the fifth house of the geniture—this nati-vity determines an omnipotent dominion of kingship, or determines decorations of mighty honor. (All translations are mine unless otherwise noted.) The astronomical data are fairly precise.14 First of all, one must check to see if Mercury and Venus are not too far from the sun. This does not happen, since Mercury is in conjunction with the sun (and thus invisible), and Venus forms a sextile aspect, which distance is possible. Let us bring the astronomi-cal data together into the following list: Saturn is in Libra in Jupiter's district, which, according to the most current system (named 'Egyptian') extended from Libra 15° to 22°. It is in it's exaltation, that is, Libra 21°, which is the ascending degree as well. Jupiter is stationary in Aquarius, in the fifth house, the επαναφορά of the lower culmination. Mars, together with the moon, occupies the midheaven precisely, which must be Cancer. 13 Firm. math. 6,31,1 See Holden 1996, 73. On p. 74 follows a calculation of the data given by Firm. math. 6,31,54 with dating to 27-28 September 96 BCE and an as-sumed identification with \"Ptolemy XI. Auletes,\" born c. 95 BCE. The surname Au-letes, however, belongs to the furtherer of the cult of Dionysus, Ptolemy XII. (XIII.) Philopator II., born c. 111/108 BCE; Ptolemy XI. (according to the numbering of Bouche-Leclercq 1903-1907) had the surname Alexandras I. Philometor and was born c. 108 BCE. The next two ruling Lagides, the sons of Ptolemy XII., Ptolemy XIII. Philopator Philadelphos and Ptolemy XIV. Philopator, were born later, i.e. in 61 59 BCE respectively. Hence, a Lagide should be excluded. 14 I am grateful to Stephan Heilen for extensive discussion and valuable suggestions.

The descending Venus occupies Aries in opposition to the ascending Saturn. James Herschel Holden has calculated these data for 23 May 139 BCE,15 tak-ing three rulers into consideration: Ptolemy IX (X) Philometor Soter II (born in 143/2 BCE), Antiochus VIII Epiphanes Philometor Kallinikus Grypus (born in 141 BCE), and finally Sulla (born in 138 BCE). In this article, I want to show that not only the date but many other references make a case for Sulla. As Otto Neugebauer pointed out, the astrologers generally presup-posed an equinox at Aries 10°,16 which was approaching, because of the pre-cession of the equinoxes, to Aries 0°, covering one degree in about 72 years. In 140 BCE one has to add some eight degrees in order to arrive at the actual positions.17 Taking this into consideration, all the data fit for 139 BCE, ex-cept Saturn, the farthest and slowest of the planets, which at that time was retrogressing in the final part of Virgo, which leads, after an addition of eight degrees, only to Libra 5°. On the morning of 20 May, however, Jupiter actu-ally became stationary (until 16 September) and just began to go retrograde: see ill. 1, which has been calculated for the latitude of Rome. 15 Holden 1996, 73f. He corrected his initial error \"138 BCE\" later in a list of errata, disseminated via the internet: \"for 23 May 138 B.C. read 23 May 139 B.C.\" For the numbering of years, see Ginzel 1914, 182. It seems to be only a strange coincidence that the first expulsion of astrologers from Rome happened in the year 139 BCE: Cramer 1951; id. 1954, 232-248. 16 Neugebauer 1975, II 593-600. One has to include also the positions of the paranatel-lonta in Manilius, located sometimes at the cardinal points of the year (8°): Hübner 1975,401-403; id. 1984, 148 note 83 and 182-193. 17 According to the rule dressed by Theo Alexandrinus in his commentary on Ptolemy's Πρόχειροι κανόνες 12 (p. 236f. Tihon), cf. Jones 1999, 343: λ5 = ληι + 6°15'-x/60°, this is in our horoscope: Xs = + 6° 15' - -108/60° = λ™ + 6° 15' + 1° 48' = λιγι + 8° 03'.

A discrepancy of 16 degrees remains. A calculation for the following year 138 BCE, however, when Sulla actually was born, in the same period at the beginning of summer (the sun being in Gemini), leads to Libra 9°, that is, after adding eight degrees, to Libra 17°, which is within the district of Jupiter (Libra 15° - 22°) and only a little before Libra 21°, Saturn's exaltation (see ill. 2).

Following an appealing sugges-tion by Stephan Heilen, the astrologer who cast this horoscope could have found Saturn's position for 138 BCE in the ephemerides and conflated it with the positions of the preceding year 139 BCE, either accidentally confusing two columns, or doing so in order to obtain an ideal configuration. Likewise, one must assume a similar confusion of two consecutive years if the horo-scope for the year 51 CE is really that for the birth of Domitian,18 and in a nativity transmitted on papyrus for the year 242 CE.19 18 19 Peter 2001, 134 and Suet.

(Firm. math. 6,31,1) 19 Hitherto, Sulla's horoscope has been taken into consideration at least once.20 We know of two glass gems showing Aries, Capricorn, and Libra,21 that seem to hint not at Augustus (for whose birth sign Capricorn and Libra are rivals), but at Sulla. I quote Josephe Henriette Abry:22 \"[...] il semblerait que Sylla ait diffuse le Belier comme signe de sa naissance, accompagne peut-etre du Capricorne. Cela supposerait que Ton avait dejä etabli pour Sylla une nativite faisant intervenir au moins deux des quatre signes tropiques.\" Indeed, the tropical signs are decisive in our horoscope, for they occupy the cardinal houses. 2. The Context in Firmicus Let us now look at the chapter's context. After having systematically consid-ered from books 2 through 6 (chapter 27) all possible planetary positions in the zodiacal signs or houses, Firmicus proceeds to individual nativities that combine manifold different parameters, beginning (in chapter 6,29) with the lowest social class—slaves. Then he considers mythological and historical examples, and exceptionally he quotes some proper names here: Oedipus (§1), Paris Alexander (§1 If.), Demosthenes (§22), Homer (§23), Plato (§24), Pindar or Archilochus (§25) and finally Archimedes (§26). These names seem to signify typical characters rather than individuals. This is confirmed by the fact that, in the case of poets, the author leaves the choice between Pindar and Archilochus to the reader. These strange ideal horoscopes deserve their own interpretation. Chapter 31 begins a new series without any name:23 sed sufficienter tibi [...] illustrium virorum deer eta narravimus. nunc ad incepti operis ordi-nem revertamur. We should note an obvious but implicit opposition between the first example of chapter 29, the slave, and the first example of chapter 31, the greatest ruler: Firmicus begins the first series with the lowest, and the second with the highest social position. The last example of horoscopes with proper names in chapter 30, that of Archimedes, differs from the others in three respects: first, Archimedes is neither a mythical figure nor a rhetorician or poet, but a mathematician and 20 It may be mentioned that under the rule of Caligula lived an astrologer named Sulla: Suet. Calig. 57,2; see Gundel 1966, 177. 21 Fossing 1929, no. 1596 and Zwierlein-Diehl 1979, no. 811. The fact that the repre-sented Ram is looking back, confirms the zodiacal interpretation: see Hübner 1982, 118 no. 2.242.1. 22 Abry 1988, 1 lOf. with note 28, on suggestion by Ernst Badian. 23 Firm. math. 6,31 pr. In 31,37 he adds another mythical name: the odd anti-hero Thersites, just for fun: decretum ioculare monstrabo.

It cannot be excluded that a horo-scope of Archimedes actually existed at that time. Indeed, he lived at Alex-andria for some time, which was not only the center of scholarship in general, but of astronomy and astrology as well. Firmicus mentions his famous model of the universe, the armillary sphere (σφαίρα κιρκωτή).24 The last example thus approaches the author in three regards: locally, temporally, and as to his subject matter, cosmologically. We have to wait only one and a half centuries to reach Sulla. For this reason, the opposition between chapters 30 and 31 is weaker than the author declares. The introductory sentence seems rather to announce a matter of greater importance. This observation will be strengthened if we look at Archimedes's as-trological data. The structure of Archimedes's horoscope corresponds in cer-tain details with that of Sulla: Ascendant, Mars, Venus, Mercury: Aries, in the district of Jupiter (Aries 1° - 6°) Jupiter: Libra (house VII) Sol: Taurus (house II) Luna: Leo (house V) Saturn: Sagittarius (house IX) Likewise, the cardinal houses are equally occupied by tropical signs. The data begin with the axis Aries - Libra that is inverted. In our horoscope Saturn (in Libra) is in opposition to Venus (in Aries); in Archimedes's horo-scope Venus (likewise in Aries) is in opposition to Jupiter (in Libra). The ascendant likewise falls in a district of Jupiter, and finally the fifth and ninth houses are emphasized, the latter being governed not by the sun, but by Sat-urn, qualified sometimes as 'anti-sun.'25 Supposing that the following horoscope belongs to Sulla, the destiny of both men form an impressive contrast: Archimedes, who is designated as a 24 Firm. math. 6,30,26: cuius ingenio fabricata sphaera lapsum caeli et omnium siderum cursus exemplo divinae imitationis ostendit. Archimedes also constructed a solid sphere (σφαίρα στερεά), which the victorious M. Claudius Marcellus captured and set up at Rome in the temple of Virtus: Cie. rep. l,21f. 25 Their exaltations and depressions are opposites, respectively, see Boll 1903, 3Ϊ3f.; id. 1918/19, 342-346; Cumont 1935, 14; Olivieri 1936, 25; Hübner 2002, 40 with note 68.

Sulla, however, had a cruel character, but nevertheless lived a splendid life even after his ab-dication. The contrast between the two men leads us to Firmicus's introduction in the first book, where he quotes Sulla in a long moralistic passage (such διατριβαί are not extraneous to astrological literature, as we can see in Manilius or Vettius Valens) as an example of the sharp opposition between virtue and disappointment, between moral perversity and success. The force of destiny seems to extinguish every kind of morality, which at first is de-monstrated by the fortunes of two Greek politicians, Miltiades and Themisto-cles, who, despite their performances, earned from their citizens nothing but hatred (Firm. math. l,7,23f.). To these two short Greek examples Firmicus contrasts one long Roman specimen, inverting the relationship: Despite his extraordinary cruelty, Sulla was extremely successful, endowed with the pro-verbial felicitas. This paradox had already acquired a considerable tradition by Firmicus's time.28 Filling no less than fourteen paragraphs with his mora-lism (Firm. math. 1,7, 25-38), Firmicus seems to follow Sallust's Historiae19 But since he became so prolix, he begged his reader's pardon (Firm. math. 1,7,29): permitte mihi longiore oratione Syllanorum scelerum replicare dis-crimina, and felt the need to excuse himself:30 nimis longa oratione vim ne-cessitatis fati [...] deflevimus. 26 Firm. math. 6,30,26: haec genitura divinum facit artis mechanicae repertorem. It may be noted that according to Teucrus of Babylon (first century BCE) the begin-ning of Aries (Aries 3°-5°)—here distinguished by the ascendant, Mars, Venus, and Mercury—is qualified by the technical goddess Pallas, in opposition to Vulcan with Libra 24°-25°; see Anon.

Astrological Interpretation In general, our horoscope is distinguished by the fact that three of the four cardinal houses, occupied by the tropical signs, are visited by a planet—the ascendant by Saturn, the midheaven by Mars and the moon, the descendant by Venus. The tropical signs generally are regarded as 'political' signs.31 The three remaining planets are in houses that form a favorable triangle to the ascendant, Jupiter being in the fifth and the sun and Mercury in the favorable ninth house, so that every sign of the ideal third triplicity, which consists only of human signs,32 lodges a planet: Gemini, the sun and Mercury (in house IX); Libra, the ascending Saturn; and Aquarius, the stationary Jupiter (in house V). Let us now examine whether the stellar positions of the horoscope confirm the astrological lore presented by Firmicus in his Mathesis, while also paying attention to other astrological writings. The enormous mass of different prognostications with their numerous specifications and modifica-tions increases the chance of finding elsewhere something that fits with Sulla; thus the following observations are far from decisive. Nevertheless, they may provide subsidiary arguments. 3.1. The Generally Favorable Prognostication If Saturn, escorted by Jupiter (as here in a trine aspect from Aquarius) stays within Libra, this signifies good fortune:33 quicumque in genitura Saturnum habuerint in Libra benivolarum stellarum testimoniis adornatum, habebunt maxima subsidia facultatum. The trine aspect of these two mighty planets farthest from the earth is generally evaluated as favorable. In our horoscope, their cooperation is enhanced by the fact that, on the one hand, Saturn resides in a district of Jupiter, and, on the other, that Jupiter dwells in the night-house of Saturn.34 Firmicus evaluates the trine aspect of Saturn and Jupiter as posi-tive if either both reside in a kindred zodiacal sign or one of them dwells in it's own house. The first condition is given here by Saturn in it's exaltation. Since at least this condition is fulfilled, the following prognostication may also be taken into consideration: si itaque Saturnus Iovi fuerit trigonica ra-diatione coniunctus, [...] sint et ambo in his in quibus gaudent signis, vel unus eorum in domo sua constitutus alium trigonica radiatione respiciat, sintque horoscopo partili radiatione sociati, infinitas copias cum magna feli-31 See Hübner 1982, 212-213 no. 4.231 and 4.232. 32 See Hübner 1982, 130-135 no. 3.12. 33 Firm. math. 5,3,29.

Then follows a further specification according to the typical Greek μάλιστα: praesertim si unus de duobus [...] lumen Lunae cres-centis exceperit. The additional reinforcement is actually at play here because the crescent moon is moving from Cancer toward Saturn in Libra. Concern-ing Jupiter's stationary position, Firmicus does not say anything, but accord-ing to other authors, the first turning enhances all planetary effects. Consider Vettius Valens:35 έάν δέ τον πρώτον στηριγμόν έπέχωσι και άναποδιστι-κοι εύρεθωσιν, τά τε προσδοκώμενα καΐ τά πράγματα και τάς ωφε-λείας και τάς εγχειρήσεις έν ύπερθέσει ποιοϋσιν. 3.2. The Success of Actions and the Surname Felix The recently quoted word felicitas leads to successful actions warranted by the conjunction of the moon and Mars in the midheaven: faciei ista coniunc-tio homines [...], et quos in omnibus prospere frequenter sequatur eventus, praesertim si in aliquo geniturae cardine fuerint collocati (Firm. math. 6,24, 9). The favorable effect, Firmicus says, is enhanced by the cardinal houses which we encounter here. Then the author invites the astrologer to look for the governor of the zodiacal sign. The ruler of Cancer is the moon, which, by residing in its own house, enhances the influence. The cardinal house in ques-tion here is the midheaven, rival of the ascendant for priority;36 it is re-sponsible for glory, honor, and success in all actions.37 To this could be related the dignitatis [...] insignia at the end of our horoscope. For Sulla's unmerited success we may compare Firmicus's introduction: totiens prospere duxit exercitum (1,7,25), and we find also the insignia: perpetuae dictaturae cumulatur insignibus (1,7,36). 3.3. Dominating, Judging, and Legislating Most important, of course, are the manifold prognostications for rulership. When Libra rises, the native will be, among other things, victorious every-where and famous: si horoscopus in Libra fuerit inventus [...], in omnibus invictus er it et talis ut in nulla re videatur esse posterior, gloriosus.

But when the autumnal Claws have begun to rise, lucky is the man born under the equilibrium of the Balance. As judge he will set up the scales for weighing life and death and he will impose the yoke upon the world and introduce new laws. The mention of a yoke relates to a part of the Balance. Many scholars believe that this points to the emperor Augustus39 in combination with the nativity of the city of Rome,40 but Manilius means rulers in general, although it would have been easy for him to insert a panegyric here as he does elsewhere.41 Perhaps the poet combined characteristics of several rulers. At any rate, the opening word felix fits with Sulla just as deciding about life and death fits with his proscriptions and issuing laws with his legislation. An equal felicitas is given when Jupiter resides in the fifth house.42 To this position Firmicus devotes a rather long paragraph:43 in quinto loco Iupi-ter ab horoscopo constitutus magna felicitatum augmenta decernit, facit eum, qui natus fuerit, in maximis <rebus> publicis honoratum. If there is an addi-tional positive aspect from Mars (as here from the midheaven), the native will have the power over life and death (as in Manilius): quodsi sic posito love Mars se bona radiatione coniunxerit, faciei duces, dabit etiam vitae et necis potestatem.

Perhaps the comma after Librae should be deleted. 39 Concerning Augustus's birth or conception, related in Libra or Capricorn, at least nine different theories have been proposed; see the dissertation by Terio, to be pub-lished. It was not yet possible to use Alfred Schmid's new study (2005). 40 As Tarutius Firmanus calculated, when Rome was founded, the moon dwelled in the Balance; cf. Gundel 1966, 126 note 10. 41 See the concluding verse of the first book, Manil. 1,926: cumque deum caelo dede-rit, non quaerat in orbe, and, once more in combination with the word felix, speak-ing about Capricorn, 2,508f.: quid enim mirabitur ille / maius in Augusti felix cum fulserit ortum?

(Firm. math. 6,31,1) 25 divina documenta proferantur. The exact degree (Libra 21°), however, misses a ruler-prognostication by two degrees; only Libra 23° makes kings or queens: in parte XXIII. Librae quicumque habuerit horoscopum, erit aut rex aut regina (8,25,8). In other ruler-prognostications, the cardinal houses are likewise ex-tremely important. At the birth of Alexander, Saturn is said to have risen in the tropical sign Cancer.44 For the moon in the midheaven, Firmicus predicts rulers, but only if the sun resides within the ascending house, either in its own house or exaltation, or in the house of Jupiter, which is not the case here. Ne-vertheless, another condition is fulfilled throughout, namely, that one of the luminaries has to aspect Jupiter positively, for the sun in Gemini trines Jupi-ter in Aquarius. In Firmicus we read: <si> sic Luna et Sole constitutis (Sole scilicet in horoscopo in his quibus diximus signis, Luna vero in MC) pariter ambos vel unum de duobus Iupiter prospera radiatione protexerit, impera-tores faciei felicitate ac iustitia praepotentes et quos omnes cum terroris trepidatione suspiciant (3,13,10). Like Manilius, Firmicus combines felicitas, rulership, and extremely bad judgment. The cardinal houses are equally crucial in the ruler-prognostications of Antiochus45 and of Ptolemy46 in his chapter περί τύχης αξιωματικής, which were also known to Firmicus, as we will see. Both luminaries should be in a masculine sign,47 and both (or at least one of them) in a cardinal house:48 έν άρρενικοΐς μεν γαρ ζωδίοις όντων αμφοτέρων των φώτων και έπικέντρων ήτοι αμφοτέρων πάλιν ή και τοϋ ετέρου [...]. The first con-dition is fulfilled by the sun being in Gemini,49 the second by the moon in the midheaven.50 In contrast to Ptolemy, Firmicus specifies the cardinal houses 44 Ps.Callist.

If we add 8°, it reaches the masculine and royal Leo, but dwells no more in the mid-heaven. The sun occupies a feminine sign (Taurus), but after adding 8° it reaches the Twins, a male sign, but not the midheaven. Nevertheless, it dwells explicitly in the ninth house, the apoclima of the midheaven.

Indeed, the moon resides in the midheaven here. Let us notice that in the apodosis Firmicus enhances Ptolemy's simple βασιλείς by reges terribiles potentes; he says: reges facient terribiles potentes, regiones vel civitates maximas subiugantes, which may point again to Sulla. The sun and Mercury are not actually in a cardinal, but in the ninth house, the άπόκλιμα of the midheaven. According to Firmicus, a conjunction of these two planets in the neighboring tenth house produces rulers. If they reside at exactly the same degree and in their own houses (which is the case here with Mercury in his night-house, Gemini), they will produce particularly great rulers: in decimo loco ab horoscope, idest in MC Mercurius cum Sole partiliter constitutus in his, quibus gaudet signis vel in quibus exaltatur, per diem totius orbis dominos faciei etc. (3,8,10). This will be enhanced if Jupiter aspects them: praesertim si bonum eis Iuppiter testimonium commodarit, and this actually happens here, for Jupiter looks to the Twins from Aquarius in a favorable trine aspect. This prognostication is all the more valid because Firmicus also pre-dicts rulers from Mercury being alone in the ninth house, especially if it is aspected by favorable planets (as here by Venus from Aries in a sextile and by Jupiter from Aquarius in a trine aspect): si vero in hoc loco [IX] matutinus fuerit inventus [sc. Mercurius], faciei [...]. sed haec fortiora erunt, si beni-volae stellae fuerit radiatione protectus; faciei enim felices beatos magnos potentes, et quibus omnia felicitatis insignia conferantur (3,7,19). Once more, the formulation omnia felicitatis insignia reminds one of Sulla. But this prognostication is only valid if Mercury is matutinus, that is, if the planet precedes the sun, whereas according to our calculation it follows the sun. 3.4. Corporeal and Mental Characteristics We know that Sulla was haughty, tall in stature, and had blond hair. These qualities are foretold by Firmicus, if we apply the lore of the planetary ruler (idominus geniturae, οικοδεσπότης).52 After mentioning several different methods, the author follows with his own, which proceeds from the second house reached by the moon following the house it was in at the time of birth. In our horoscope, the moon moves from Cancer to Leo, the latter ruled by the sun. Since this method eliminates the luminaries, one has to proceed to the next sign, namely Virgo, which is ruled by Mercury. If Mercury in conjunc-tion with the sun governs the second sign (as here Virgo), among other things it produces haughty men: si Sol cum domino geniturae hac, qua diximus, ra-51 Firm. math. 7,22,1 quoted above.

(Firm. math. 6,31,1) 27 diatione fuerit coniunctus [...]. facit itaque homines plenos fidei, sed inflate superbiae spiritu sublevatos (4,19,32). The high-minded character fits with Sulla as well as the corporeal qualities that follow: facit etiam corpore longos decoros, sed quorum caput flavo capillorum crine lucescat. Also the position of Jupiter aspected by Mars in the fifth house mentioned above, will give solid bodies:53 erit autem [.. ,]fortis corpore validis ossibus. Furthermore, it is known that Sulla repeatedly broke his word. Fir-micus makes such a prognostication in the case where a district of Jupiter happens to be rising (as here). In general, this position is favourable, as we might expect: si in finibus Iovis horoscopus fuerit inventus, <omnia virtutis ac sapientiae ornamenta decernit> (5,2,5). This fits with Archimedes, whose ascendant, as we have seen, falls within a district of Jupiter. But the additio-nal influence of Saturn given in Sulla's nativity completely inverts the effect into its contrary: si Saturnus <aut Mars> in ipsis partibus fuerit inventus et sit diurna genitura, faciei perfldos et qui numquam promissorum suorum fidem conpleant etc. Here we note another contrast between Archimedes and Sulla: Saturn's presence corrodes the basically positive effect. But we should also note positive characteristics, like trusting in the gods. Sulla had a special relationship with Apollo (Christ 2002, 206), bearing his amulet on his breast (Turcan 2003, 424f.), and in the fight at the Porta Collina he invoked this god. Prognostications for Libra rising foretell not only victorious (as we have seen), but also religious men:54 religiosus sane erit et cultor deorum. 3.5. The Sexual Life Sulla had a special relationship not only with Apollo, but also with Aphrodite (Christ 2002, 206f). In 86 BCE he accepted the surname Έπαφρόδιτος, and at Rome he convinced the senate to confirm it.55 It is unclear whether this was directed against the pretension of king Mithridates VI, celebrated as Νέος Διόνυσος.56 Since Latin in that period was unable to form composite nouns, the Roman chose the simple epithet Felix. We saw that Firmicus re-lates this in his first book. Scholars have interpreted this name in a different manner, however: either as \"a favorite of Fortuna,\" as \"a favorite of Venus,\" 53 Firm. math. 3,3,8. See above note 43. 54 Firm. math. 5,1,19. See above. 55 Plut. Sulla 34,4, cf. Sallust's famous judgment (lug. 95,4): illi felicissumo omnium etc. With some restriction Val.

We may com-pare the felicitas of the emperor Septimius Severus, who was equally credulous concerning astrology: Maass 1902, 146f. 56 Volkmann 1958, 36-43: \"Sullas Gegenideologie: Der Liebling der Aphrodite.\" Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 Wolfgang Hübner or simply \"a charismatic person without any relation to the gods.\" The oppo-nents of the Venus-theory only offered weak arguments. Indeed, Felix was an epithet of Venus. Sulla had the name \"Aphrodite\" inscribed on the spoils dur-ing the battle of Cheironeia, and he obeyed the oracle at Delphi which asked him to offer a sacrifice to Aphrodite of Aphrodisias. At Rome, he ordered coins showing Venus and Felicitas, and he even promised a temple for Ve-nus.57 Finally, he named the twins born to his fourth wife, Metella, Faustus and Fausta\\ these names point to the same semantic field. In our horoscope, Venus resides in the descending house occupied by Aries. In general, the descending house concerns the wife.58 Among Sulla's five marriages, the fourth one was eminently honorable: that with the afore-mentioned Metella, the niece of the famous Caecilius Metellus Numidicus (cos. 109 BCE). In his youth, however, Sulla is said to have lived a life full of debauch-ery, and to have returned to it in his old age. In Firmicus's first book we read: ignavus ille vir et omni infamiae maculatione pollutus, Syllam dico etc. (1,7,25), and again: quod nunc putas esse iudicium, quem rationis ordinem, ut ille, qui numquam fuit memor sexus sui, qui ultra commendationem gratiae puerilis aetatis senex exoletus in aliena aetate flagitia corporis detinebat, vitiis obsessus Romana gubernaret imperia? (1,7,28) A similar attitude is foretold from two further configurations, both of which are relevant here. First, an opposition between Saturn and Venus, which is represented as a strong hostility:59 si Saturnus et Venus diametra se radiatione respexerint, <et> in contrariis constituti locis longa se invicem virium suarum potestate pulsaverint, facient homines lupanaribus deditos promiscua libidinum <cupiditate> scorta sectari, ut ex hoc cum magna nota gravi pulsentur infamia. We should notice the resonance between pulsaverint in the protasis and pulsentur in the apodosis, and the fact that bad reputation {infamia) resulting from a vicious life fits with Sulla as seen by Firmicus in his introduction. The same word recurs in the other condition, which requires that Venus be in the descending house: in septimo loco Venus ab horoscope 57 See Wissowa 21912, 291: \"Sulla, der sich für einen besonderen Liebling der Aphro-dite hielt und seinen Beinamen felix griechisch durch ' Επαφρόδιτος wiedergab, verehrte die Venus insbesondere als Glücksgöttin unter dem Namen Venus Felix.\" 58 Hübner 2004, 166-169 no. 24. 59 Firm. math. 6,15,14.

It is uncertain whether the additional condition formulated before— that Venus has to be in its own sign during a nighttime birth—is still at work here or not. But in what follows Firmicus adds another specification that fits here: If Venus stays in a tropical sign, in opposition or quartile aspect to Mars, this signifies debauchery: si enim hunc locum [VII] tenuerit in tropicis signis constituta [...], et cum ea Mars fuerit aut se illiper diametrum aut de quadrato forti radiatione coniunxerit, facit inpuros libidinosos infames (3,6,14). The two conditions are fulfilled here, since Venus, dwelling in the tropical sign Aries, is in a quartile aspect to Mars in Cancer. At the end of the passage, Firmicus concentrates the effect on two particular tropical signs: Ca-pricorn and Aries: sed haec vitia erunt fortiora, si in Capricorno vel Ariete ha[e]c se stellarum mixtura coniunxerint (3,6,15). Both signs belong to the greedy signs (ασελγή),60 but most of all Aries creates greediness in many single degrees.61 At any rate, the text of Kroll and Skutsch has to be corrected here. The modification made by Pierre Monat62 is not convincing. The solution proposed here (ha[e]c) relates the plural coniunxerint to the famous couple just mentioned, Mars and Venus, and presupposes the metaphor of copulation for the conjunction, which is employed in the former paragraph for Mars and elsewhere for the conjunction of Mars and Venus:63 \"If they conjoin them-selves in this starry mixture.\" The two planets neighboring the sun (according to the ancient system) are contrasted in the same way in an interpretation of a famous earlier ruler's life. Iulianus of Laodicaea quotes the life of Alexander as an example of Mars's unexpected good and Venus's likewise unexpected bad influence. Alexander's victories, gained by the support of Mars, would have been troubled by his venereal end:64 και τό γενναίο ν καΐ αήττητο ν του Μακεδόνος'Αλεξάνδρου [sc. ήν] άρεϊκόν, ή δέ δια τήν μέθην συμ-βασα αύτω τελευτή άφροδισιακόν.

The Short Life With regard to the conjunction of Mars and the moon, Firmicus forecasts, as we saw above, not only a successful, but also a short life:65 sed his aut breve vitae decernitur spatium, aut vitae cursum inmaturus exitus mortis inpugnat. A similar prognostication is given for the degree ascending here (Libra 21°): in parte XXI. Librae quicumque habuerint horoscopum, erunt [...] oligo-chronii (8,25,7). We know a speculative method for calculating the duration of life. Al-though not mentioned by Firmicus, it is described at length by Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos in the notorious chapter about the \"spender of life\" (αφέτης, prorogator).66 In the case of a daytime birth, if the sun resides in house X, I, XI, VII or IX, it sends forth the ray of life in the direction of the planets (counterclockwise). In a sort of \"zodiacal roulette\" (Bouche-Leclercq), the ray moves on until it comes to rest at the next planet in a position not to ex-ceed a quarter circle (90 degrees), and the number of zodiacal degrees cov-ered roughly indicates the years of life. Let us apply this method to our horoscope. As the sun dwells in the ninth house, it is its turn to send forth the ray of life. According to our calcu-lation, the sun resides at Taurus 28°, which leads, by an addition of 8°, to Gemini 6°. The first fatal meeting with a malefic planet happens in Cancer 22° with Mars, which leads, by an addition of 8°, to Cancer 30°, thus the end of Cancer. This position, where the moon is also involved, increases its per-nicious power by an unfavorable quartile aspect to the other malefic planet, Saturn, dwelling in Libra. The ascensional values from Gemini 6° to Cancer 30° amount to slightly more than 60 degrees, independently of the geographi-cal latitude, because the sums of the right ascensions of Gemini and Cancer are pretty much the same in the Babylonian systems A and Β for all climata. This figure corresponds to a life's duration of roughly 60 years, Sulla's actual lifetime, and such a result could have been present in Sulla's mind. 3.7. Sulla's Abdication and Death At age 59, Sulla appeared before the public meeting and unexpectedly abdi-cated after having earlier renounced that year's consulship.67 According to 65 Firm. math. 6,24,9, see above.

(Firm. math. 6,31,1) 31 Hans Volkmann,68 he did so because the astrologers, as Plutarch relates, fore-told a premature death for him. We must not forget that Sulla was extremely superstitious;69 he recorded his dreams, and in his voluminous memoirs he must have often spoken about the goddess Fortuna, signs, and wonders (Misch 1945-1950,1 254-256). But the symptoms of his grave illness could also have caused him to do so. Only a few months later, after having spent less than one year as a pri-vate citizen, Sulla died at the age of 60.™ According to the sources, he suf-fered from the φθειρίασις (morbus pedicularis, \"illness of lice\"),71 but this may be a later legend, since a similar death by worms passed for a typical death of tyrants (Ehrhardt 1959, 19). It is precisely in relation to this disease that Plutarchus relates: προέγνω την έαυτοΰ τελευτήν (Plut. Sulla 37,1). He continues that Sulla had written in the last book of his Commentarii (ύπομνήματα) that astrologers foretold to him that at the peak of his success-ful life he would expire:72 καί φησι τους Χαλδαίους αύτω προειπεΐν, ώς 5eot βεβιωκότα καλώς αύτόν έν άπμη των ευτυχημάτων καταστρέψοα. We cannot yet determine when the Chaldeans uttered this prognostication. If it was at the end of his life, as the reference in the last book of Sulla's mem-oirs suggests, the astrologers could have known about the illness, and there-fore made this prognostication. But it cannot be ruled out that they in-terpreted an already existing horoscope. 4. Conclusion Five reasons increase the probability that the detailed horoscope given by Fir-micus Maternus for a mighty and successful ruler indicates Sulla's nativity: first, the virtually exact date of his birth by a combination of elements from two consecutive years, 139 and 138 BCE; second, the conformity with many general predictions given by the author throughout the work (especially for Saturn in the ascendant in Libra in alliance with Jupiter, and the conjunction of Mars and the crescent moon in the midheaven); third, the contrasting jux-taposition of Firmicus's compatriot Archimedes's nativity; fourth, the promi-nent position of this horoscope at the beginning of a new series of nativities, 68 Volkmann 1958, 86, approved by Christ 2002, 134f. On the other hand, in his youth a great future was foretold to him: Plut. Sulla 5,11. 69 Christ 2002, 134f. See also Fröhlich 1900. 70 Val.

XII, 68-69) JOSEPHE-HENRIETTE ABRY Every reader well acquainted with classical antiquity has heard of that fa-mous night when Agrippina, fearing that her imperial husband, Claudius, might feel some fatherly love again for his children, for Britannicus in par-ticular, and that this could upset the situation of her son, Nero, decided to act and poison the emperor, to speed up her son's accession to power. Did Claudius die earlier than expected? According to the historians, it seems that the end of the night and the following morning were spent buying time to prevent the news from being spread: the body was swathed in blankets; the Senate was convened, waiting for an important piece of news; Agrippina her-self, \"heart-broken apparently and seeking comfort, held Britannicus to her breast and [...] prevented him and his sisters from leaving their rooms; ever and anon she issued notices that the emperor's indisposition was turning fa-vourably [...] to allow time for the advent of the auspicious moment insisted upon by astrologers,\" as Tacitus writes. \"At last, at midday, on the thirteenth of October [54 CE], the palace gates swung suddenly open [...] and Nero passed to the cohort, was greeted with cheers and finally taken to the camp of the Praetorians who saluted him as Imperator.\" Such is, in brief, Tacitus's account of what was, in fact, a 'coup d'etat.'1 Although Suetonius gives two different accounts of that night, he corroborates what is most important for this paper: the hour at which the accession took place, and the fact that * I want to express my deepest thanks to Dr Stephan Heilen (Münster) whose kind help was most precious and valuable for correcting important points in this paper. 1 Agrippina, velut dolore evicta et solatia conquirens, teuere amplexu Britannicum [...] ne cubiculo egrederetur [...] Cunctos aditus clauser at crebroque vulgabat ire in melius valetudinem principis. quo Γ...1 temvus prosperum ex monitis Chal-daeorum adventaret. 69 Tunc medio diei tertium ante Idus Octobris foribus palatii repente diductis [...] Nero egreditur ad cohortem [...] Ibi monentepraefecto faustis vocibus exceptus inditur lecticae [...] Inlatusque castris Nero [...] imperator con-salutatur (Tacitus, Annals XII, 68-69).

Indeed, the French Canadian P. Brind'Amour is the only scholar who has tried to find out what confirmation astrology could provide to the account of both Latin historians.4 Since the answers he gave thirteen years ago do not seem quite satisfactory to me, in this paper I will investigate the matter further. 1. History and Astrology: The Story of a \"Coup\"! From many points of view, Nero's accession to the Empire may be regarded as a good example of the interesting but difficult relationship between history and astrology. The main elements of the question are (1) historical circum-stances in which (2) astrologers play the most influential part determining the most propitious time for action. Thus, the question to be asked from the per-spective of this volume is what astrological value lies in both Tacitus's and Suetonius's accounts; does astrology confirm or explain any details of the situation, does it help us understand what lies behind the historical relation? The historical circumstances are clear: taking advantage of the ab-sence of Narcissus, the imperial freeman Claudius trusted, Agrippina decided within a very short time (a few days? a few hours?) to murder Claudius. Death had to look natural; this is why the poison was sprinkled on mush-rooms, a dish Claudius was extremely fond of, with the hope that he would 2 \"When the death of Claudius was made public, Nero, who was seventeen years old, went forth to the watch between the sixth and seventh hour, since no earlier time for the formal beginning of his reign seemed suitable because of bad omens throughout the day [...]\" Septemdecim natus annos, ut de Claudio palam factum est, inter horam sextam septimamaue processit ad excubitores, cum ob totius diei diritatem non aliud auspicandi tempus accommodatius videretur (Suetonius, Divus Claudius, XLIV-XLV). 3 Cramer 1954, chapter 3: \"Astrologers, the Power behind the Throne from Augustus to Domitian,\" especially 112-131; Martin 1983. 4 Brind'Amour 1991. After finalizing this paper, Stephan Heilen pointed me to an article by A. M. Lewis (1998), in which Lewis tries to prove that Nigidius's proph-ecy corresponds to the horoscope of Nero's accession on October 13, 54 CE. Some of the conclusions of her extensive study are close to my own, although Lewis ar-gues in a different direction.

At what time did Claudius die? In one account, Suetonius writes \"just before dawn,\"5 but we can reasonably assume that it was perhaps a little ear-lier, during the second half of the night. Clearly Agrippina and her coterie did not have complete control over the time of death. But, on the other hand, 'Chaldaeans,' that is astrologers, had advised that Nero had to wait until noon to be hailed as the new Emperor. Hence those eight or nine hours during which it was necessary to maintain absolute silence about the Emperor's death and to play the farce of 'things are serious but we still hope....' The part played by the astrologers in Agrippina's coterie is not sur-prising. We know that she requested their advice on many occasions: from Tiberius's reign, court astrologers had been present as the Emperor's coun-sellors and astrology was used either as a weapon—to eliminate enemies, rivals for power or marriage—or as a tool to secure one's future.6 Among these secret counsellors was Ti. Claudius Balbillus, the son or grandson of Tiberius's famous astrologer, Ti. Claudius Thrasyllus, who was himself a learned man (we still have some excerpts of his works, mostly on the length of life7). He had belonged to Agrippina's coterie for some time, if indeed he prophesied that Nero should reign and slay his mother, and, afterwards, he advised Nero during the main part of his reign. On the night Claudius died was it Balbillus who decided the most propitious time for the beginning of the new reign? This seems quite likely, because one year later, in 55, he be-came Prefect of Egypt, which may have been the reward for important deeds. Indicating the most propitious time for an action is part of the astrolo-ger's job: it is called electional or catarchic astrology,8 and it aims to investi-gate the influence of a momentary configuration of the heavens upon the outcome of an enterprise. Before undertaking some action, such as embarking on a journey, being bled, marrying, or founding a city, one must know its most auspicious moment. With such knowledge, everyone can reconcile fa-talism and free-will: knowing in what condition the heavens will be at a given time, one may decide freely to carry out an enterprise or not. For the most trivial actions as for the most important decisions, the part played by astrological counselors was crucial. The time chosen for beginning the new reign is identical in both ac-counts: it was midday, according to Tacitus, and between the sixth and sev-5 Defecisse prope lumen (Divus Claudius, XLIV, 3). 6 Brind'Amour (1991, 147) gives many examples; see also Barton 1994, 42-46. 7 On Balbillus's life and works, see Grzybek 1999, 122 note 16, to which can be added Gage 1968, chap. 2, 75-124; Pingree 1978, vol.

We may discard the moon: however fast its motion may be, its position does not noticably vary within an hour; on the other hand, the sign rising on the eastern horizon, the ascendant (ASC), changes constantly, roughly every two hours, sometimes less, sometimes more. It is also the main element on which the whole chart rests: it is certainly one of the points as-trologers had in mind when they looked for a precise time.10 2. Is the 13th of October 54 CE a \"Coronation Horoscope\"? Drawing the astrological chart for 13 October 54 midday at Rome is not dif-ficult. Stephan Heilen checked Brind'Amour's positions; here are the accu-rate results (see ill. 1 at the end of this article): Sun Lib 18°  MarsScol7°  Moon Cnc nearly 27° (26° 47') Venus Lib 18° (exactly 17° 58') Saturn Ari 3° (retrograde) Mercury Lib 0° Jupiter Ari 15° (retrograde) ASC Sgr 26° 56' (nearly 27°) To these positions we can add the Lot of Fortune at Lib 3°. But drawing a diagram of the heavens as astrologers did in the first century CE raises several difficulties: First, computer-calculated planetary positions are tropical longitudes c. 5° lower than the sidereal longitudes reck-oned by ancient astrologers. On this point, Neugebauer's commentary (p. 182) is essential. One can assume that Balbillus, for instance, would have given the following positions: sun, Venus and Mercury in Libra (22° or 23° more likely than 18°); moon (in fact at the very last degrees of Cancer) in Leo (1° or 2°); Saturn and Jupiter in Aries; Mars in Scorpio, and ASC at the beginning of Capricorn. The second difficulty concerns the location of the centra and the astrological 'houses' or loci: if it is easy to calculate the axis ASC—Dysis (rising to setting point), it is more difficult to determine the axis midheaven (MC, upper culmination)-lower midheaven (IMC). In normal practice, it seems likely that astrologers used to put the centra every 90° 9 Inter horam sextam septimamque, Suetonius, Nero VIII. 10 Stephan Heilen was kind enough to check the chart for 13 Oct. 54 at 11:46 and at 12:00 (Rome, local time) using Galiastro 4,3 software; the moon moved from Cnc 26° 39' to Cnc 26° 47', the ASC moved from Sgr 24° 0' to 26° 56', which means a shift of nearly 3 degrees within a quarter of an hour.

XII, 68-69) 41 (Hübner 2003, 15), without regard for astronomical reality, that is, the zodiac, rising with a more or less oblique angle over the horizon is hardly ever di-vided into four equal quadrants by the horizon and the meridian. This has an important consequence: if the ASC is located at Sagittarius 27°, it is likely that, for the less precise among the ancient astrologers, the MC fell at Virgo 27°, while in the modern computation, it falls at 18° Libra according to P. Brind'Amour, or, more precisely, at 21° 27' according to Heilen's computa-tions (for 12:00). For the same reason, the intervals allowed for each of the twelve 'places' were, it seems, of a constant length of 30° each, computed either from the ASC, or from 5 or 10 degrees before the cusp. More often, a whole zodiacal sign corresponded to a single mundane house. Only after Ptolemy, in the second century, was the mathematical problem of the exact location of the centra and of the uneven loci clearly defined and solved (Neugebauer and van Hoesen 1959, 8). However, once it was known that the signs do not rise evenly every two hours in relation to the different latitudes of the earth (Manilius, Astronomica, III, 218-246), it was certainly possible, from the first century, to compute with greater precision which sign was cul-minating at the MC for a given time without being satisfied with the normal 90° method. Using tables of rising times (anaphorai) (Manilius, Astronomica, III, 385-442), even an ordinary astrologer (not to mention fully qualified astrologers as were Agrippina's advisers) could reckon that the culminating sign was Libra instead of Virgo, and that the sun-Venus conjunc-tion was very close to the MC (upper culmination). Now the interpretation of the horoscope becomes clearer: according to P. Brind'Amour, the sun-Venus conjunction, which he thought was in the tenth place exactly on the MC (18°), sufficed to explain why this precise time had been chosen. 1 His demonstration thus stops there with this prospect of a glorious and auspicious reign. So 13 October could seem a propitious mo-ment for becoming Emperor, a perfect \"coronation horoscope\"1 promising glory and happiness. Yet Brind'Amour missed two essential details: the meaning of the ASC, which he computed at Sgr 24°, and Suetonius's state-ment that it was an ominous day. Let us treat this last point first. Does the chart drawn for this moment have anything to do with a 'coronation horoscope'? Brind'Amour identified the most salient point, namely, that Venus was very close to the MC. He could also have added the position of the sun in this same place,13 and the fact that the sun-Venus con-11 Firmicus, III, 6, 21: In decimo loco Venus ab horoscope sifuerit inventa, id est in MC., faciei claros et coronatos et quihus grandis gloria et fortuna maxima conferatur. 12 To use Barton's expression (1994, 67), referring to Pingree 1976. 13 Firmicus, III, 5, 34: in decimo loco Sol ab horoscope partiliter constitutus in diurna genitura, id est in MC., in domo sua aut in domo Iovis, aut in ea parte in qua exal-tatur, faciei reges quibus a patre tradatur imperium aut duces quibus hoc honoris simili modo paternis cum honoribus conferatur [...] \"Although in that special case, Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 Josephe-Henriette Abry junction is also quite propitious in itself: Si Sol et Venus pariter collocati in eodem signo constituti aequabili societatis potestate iungantur, facient quidem homines gloriosos, et qui desiderata omnia facillimis rationibus con-sequantur (Firmicus, Mathesis VI, 25, 1). Moreover, Venus was in Libra, its night house, and the three planets (sun, Venus, and Mercury) being close to the MC in the sign of Libra could appear as a link between the fate of the new emperor and the destiny of Rome, founded, according to a well estab-lished tradition, under the sign of Libra.14 As Augustus had done before, one can imagine the profit imperial propaganda could derive from this kind of coincidence: a 'coronation horoscope,' in which the ASC was in Capricorn, the sign which Augustus claimed to be his birth sign, and the MC was in Li-bra. One may add some other propitious points: the presence of Mars in Scorpio, its day house, and in the 11th place (Manilius calls it Fortuna Felix), and Mercury in the 9th place (called Deus according to Manilius). All this seemed to portend a new Golden Age. Yet Suetonius expressly wrote that the day was dire and that \"because of bad omens throughout the day,\" it had been necessary to choose the less ominous time: cum ob totius diei diritatem non aliud auspicandi tempus ac-commodatius videretur. Is this a retrospective pronouncement from someone who knew how the story ended? Actually, an astrologer can easily spot three oppositions that cast suspicion on the future: Saturn opposite Mercury and Jupiter opposite the sun-Venus conjunction seem to foretell Nero's wretched end: si Iuppiter et Sol diametra se radiatione respexerint, et in contrariis constituti locis longa se invicem radiorum suorum potestate pulsaverint, pa-ternas facultates miseris faciunt lacerationibus dissipari; sed et omnem vitam et substantiam et praecedentis dignitatis gradus miseris bonorum deiectioni-bus minuuntur (Firmicus, Mathesis VI, 16,2). So, in spite of the many points which were actually auspicious, 13 October was certainly not the most ideal moment for a 'coronation.' Of course, in the panic in which Claudius's death was decided and realized, astrologers had to choose the 'less problematic' time, but why the precise moment of noon? the sun was not located in its own 'house' nor in one of Jupiter's houses, nor on a degree in which it was 'exalted'.\" 14 On the horoscope of Rome, see Manilius, Astronomica, 4, 773-775; Abry 1996. Actually it seems that, at the beginning of his reign, the official propaganda aimed at presenting Nero as a new Augustus: Dumont 1986; Arnaud 1987; Le Boeuffle 1989.

An Ambiguous Nativity We have a fairly good idea of how astrologers worked when they were asked for \"katarchai\": they would need to consider both the future state of the heavens and also the positions of the stars at their client's birth in making such a recommendation. Nero's birth is well known: \"(He) was born at Antium nine months af-ter the death of Tiberius, on the eighteenth day before the Calends of January, just as the sun rose, so that he was touched by its rays almost before he could be laid upon the ground,\" that is, on 15 December 37 in Latium at sunrise.15 As one would expect, the birth of a man with such an outrageous reputation has drawn the attention of astrologers from antiquity to modern times.16 Ac-tually, the ancients had less interest in the monstrosity of the man than in the documentary value of his biography: in his Anthologiae, book V, 7,20 (Pin-gree 1986, 222) Vettius Valens asks the question: knowing the exact nativity of a man and the planet which was the 'starter' (aphetes), how are we to reckon the date of his death? As an example he takes Nero's nativity (without giving his name) and explains how the planetary revolutions lead to 11 June 68, which was supposed to be Nero's death, Saturn having revolved to ex-actly the same degree as in his nativity. The analysis of this twofold horo-scope by O. Neugebauer and Η. B. van Hoesen gives the following positions (see ill. 2): Sun Sgr 22°  Saturn Vir 26° Mars Sgr 26°  Jupiter Sco 14° 15 Suetonius, Nero, VI. The report goes on: \"Many people at once made many direful predictions from his horoscope, and a remark of his father Domitius was also re-garded as an omen; for while receiving the congratulations of his friends, he said that 'nothing that was not abominable and a public bane could be born of Agrippina and himself.\" Nero natus est Anti post Villi, mensem quam Tiberius excessit, XVIII.

Cardano drew two horoscopes for Nero's geniture, the first one in the Libelli Duo (1543, Xv-XIIr) calculated for the 14th of December 36, the second one (Libelli Quinque, 1547, in Opera omnia, V, 480-481) corresponding to the 14th of June 38, which he declared haec est vera Neronis genitura. Although neither has anything to do with the actual genitura of Nero and they are quite different from each other, the commentary is the same: saevitia in fratrem, uxorem, matrem, in omnes denique, urbem incendio, cor-pus stupris, animum flagitiis, omnia cruenta nece foedavit. Animo trepidus etiam ad ipsa facinora, valetudine flrmus, anno 18 imperium orbis matris fraude adeptus, 32 aetatis, scelere proprio cum vita simul amisit, manum timore publicae poenae in-ferre sibi compulsus.

Although there is no indication, the MC too was necessarily in Libra (16°), if we accept the idea that it was computed according to the astronomical reality instead of being put 90° ahead of the ASC. This coincidence between the charts of Nero's birth and his accession to the Empire is too impressive to be fortui-tous, and it is very likely one of the keys to understanding why midday was chosen for the time on 13 October. If later astrologers were mostly interested in the length of life fated by such a disposition, those who attended the birth foretold a most ominous fu-ture: de genitura eius statim multa etformidulosa multis coniectantibus [...], writes Suetonius. Although Nero was later to avail himself of a solar nativity, the planetary positions portended a baleful future. Actually the nativity chart shows four squares, Saturn (Vir 27°) aspecting the sun, the ASC (Sgr 23°) and also Mars (Sgr 27°) from quartile, and the moon too (Leo 9°), being 95° ahead of Jupiter (Sco 14°), aspects it from quartile. So this aspect, very omi-nous in itself, occurs four times! The square moon-Jupiter could, a priori, seem less ominous because of the benign character ascribed to the planet Jupiter, which was, furthermore, in a place judged auspicious (XI); but, whatever the determination of the places was in antiquity, it is obvious that the moon was in the eighth place (death). Does this quartile explain the prophecy that Nero should reign (Jupiter in the 11th house) and slay his mother (moon in the 8th house)?18 All these ominous aspects, added to the 17 Which means 22° or 23°; see Neugebauer and van Hoesen 1959, 79. Vettius Valens does not give any indication of the birth time; he simply writes that the ASC was lo-cated in Sagittarius. Dio gives more details: \"At his birth just before dawn a ray not cast by any visible beam of the sun enveloped him\" (Epitome of book LXI, 2, 35). 18 We have two accounts of this prophecy: Dio's chapter on the signs indicating that Nero should one day be sovereign: \"A certain astrologer [... ] from the motion of the stars at that time and their relation to one another, prophesied two things at once concerning him—that he should rule and that he should murder his mother. Agrip-pina, on hearing this, became for the moment so bereft of sense as actually to cry out: 'Let him kill me, only let him rule!' but later she was to repent bitterly of her prayer\" (Epitome of LXI, 1,1); and Tacitus (Annals, XIV, 9, 3) who mentions the prophecy Occidat, dum imperet!' after Agrippina's murder. According to Annals VI, 22, Thrasyllus's son Balbillus had made this forecast. At what moment was this prophecy uttered? At Nero's birth, although it sounds very ominous in such a cir-cumstance? Or on 13 October, when astrologers were looking for the less ominous time?

XII, 68-69) 45 fact that Sagittarius was itself a sign lacking in 'charisma',19 may explain why Nero's nativity was never openly published, nor was it given any politi-cal publicity. For Agrippina and for her son, this evil nativity certainly re-mained a threat on their way to power. 4. Conclusion From this analysis several conclusions can be drawn: The horoscope cast for 13 October, about noon, shows many auspicious features, the most salient of which is the sun-Venus conjunction very close to the MC (or exactly on the MC, if we take into consideration the fact that planetary positions used to be sideric and therefore higher than modern [tropic] values); it may have looked like a 'coronation horoscope,' and perhaps that was told to Agrippina and Nero in order to promote psychological confidence. Actually, although there were propitious elements, one can also see threatening dissonances likely to fuel great apprehensions. Suetonius is the only one to note this, which may indicate the difficulty of finding the 'less problematic' time in an emergency situation. Playing with the only available element, namely time, Agrippina's as-trologers chose a disposition very close to Nero's nativity, with centra lo-cated on nearly the same degrees (ASC Sgr IT v. 23°, MC Lib 21° v. 16°). Was it their main intention to recreate a nearly identical framework, in which new planetary positions would mitigate the dire aspects of the nativity with auspicious elements taking the place of the ominous ones; was it an attempt to rub out what had once been written in the stars? For Nero's second birth, his birth as an emperor, one can assume that Agrippina's advisers tried to find a new starting point as similar as possible to the former one in order to cancel it in a definitive manner. One last detail might have been highly significant and might explain the tiny difference between the two charts. Whatever the uncertainty on the exact locations of the twelve places, the moon in Nero's nativity was at Leo 12°, i.e. quite certainly in the 8th place (death), hence the prophecy made by Balbillus: \"To her inquiries as to the destiny of Nero, the astrologers an-swered that he should reign, and slay his mother; and 'Let him slay' she had said, 'so that he will reign,'\" (Tacitus, Ann. XIV, 9, 3). In the chart corre-sponding to 13 October, it was in the last degrees of Cancer, 27°, a position 19 According to Trimalcio, \"Under the Sagittarius (are born) cross-eyed people, lifting the bacon while looking at the vegetables,\" in Sagittario (nascuntur) strabones, qui holera spectant, lardum tollunt (Petronius, Satyrica, 39, 11). Most astrologers insist upon this weakness of the eyes; see Firmicus, Math. VIII, 27,1. This was actually the case for Nero; Suetonius, Nero, LI.

As the 8th house started from Leo 5° (about 10° sideric), it seems that, instead of the place of death, the moon was still in the 7th house (marriage), while before noon it would have been once again, as in 37 CE, in the 8th place. If I am right, the decision to wait until noon may be interpreted as the pathetic hope to avert fate, the last attempt to escape the impending parricide. References 1.

As usual in Greek literary horoscopes,5 all three natives are anonymously presented as \"someone\" (τις). Kroll and Cumont realized that the first and longest horoscope refers to the Emperor Hadrian, born in 76 CE.6 While the identity of the second native is controversial, the third one has been identified as Hadrian's grandnephew, Pedanius Fuscus (F. Cumont, CCAG VIII 2 [1911], 851). This name reminds us of a gloomy event towards the end of Hadrian's reign: Shortly before his own death, the emperor had Pedanius Fuscus,7 who was only 18 according to Cassius Dio, executed (see Cass. Dio 69,17,1), while Iulius Servianus (PIR21 631 [see I 569]; Caballos Rufino 1990, 386-388, no. I 30), who was Ped-anius's grandfather and Hadrian's brother in law, was forced to commit sui-cide. Since Hadrian was childless, Pedanius must have seemed to be the natural candidate for the imperial succession.8 He was the only male relative of suitable age. Although Pedanius had not (or not yet) been officially desig-nated, he must have had the highest expectations for the future. Hadrian seems to have taken the young man with him on journeys to the East, as a member of his closest entourage.9 Iulius Servianus, on the other hand, who was already some ninety years old, was highly honoured by Hadrian who, for example, made the old man consul for the third time in 134 CE. But then Hadrian seems to have rather abruptly changed his mind. In 136 CE, the consul of that year, Lucius Ceionius Commodus, was adopted and designated for succession as L. Aelius Caesar.10 When he died on the first of January 138 CE, Hadrian, who had himself fallen seriously ill and was close to dying, chose a new heir to his throne who actually followed him as Antoninus Pius (138-161 CE). Young Pedanius must have resented and somehow imprudently reacted to either the first or both of these decisions, a fatal mistake that led to his own and his grandfather's deaths. In July 138, Hadrian died \"hated by everyone\" (invisus omnibus), as the Historia Augusta reports (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 25,7), and it took 5 See Neugebauer and van Hoesen 1959, esp. 76-160.

Aug. Hadr. 27,1-2). Our main historical sources for Hadrian's attempts to secure the suc-cessor to his throne are Cassius Dio and the Historia Augusta. Dio's ac-count11 is brief and hostile to the emperor.12 The life of Hadrian in the Historia Augusta is written hastily and carelessly, veering from hostility to-wards Hadrian (derived from Marius Maximus, as is explicit in several places) to a more balanced attitude.13 Since both Cassius Dio and Marius Maximus wrote in the early third century and shared the hostile attitude to-wards Hadrian which had long become typical of the senatorial order, it is interesting to find in the fragments of Antigonus of Nicaea the only preserved earlier version of the same events, a version that takes the opposite point of view: Antigonus praises Hadrian and condemns Pedanius. The anonymously presented horoscope of Hadrian (Heph. 2,18,22-52) falls into three parts:14 first, a short exposition of the astronomical data; sec-ond, an equally short life of the native; and third, a long astrological explana-tion of the biographical details in the preceding section. The astronomical data are limited to the positions of the luminaries, the planets, the ascendant, and midheaven, all given to the degree. They correspond to the configuration of 24 January 76 CE, which is the birthday of Hadrian as known from in-scriptions and from the Historia Augusta (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 1,3). The bio-graphical information contained in the text is as follows:15 The native had been adopted by a certain emperor who was of the same family (namely Tra-jan) and became emperor himself around his 42nd year.16 He was well-built (εύμεγέθης), manly (ανδρείος), gracious (εύχαρις), prudent (φρόνιμος), educated (πεπαιδευμένος), profound (βαθύς), praiseworthy (δοξαστικός), high minded (μεγαλόφρων), munificent (δωρητικός), effective (άνυστι-κός), and beneficent (εύεργετικός) (Heph. 2,18,23.29.30.33.36); in other words: of excellent physical, mental, and imperial qualities. Antigonus went on to analyze the social environment; first the state, and then the family.

But the correct readings can often be restored from a valuable epitome and two other short excerpts (for a full discussion of this and related problems see the monograph an-nounced in note 3 above). 15 I partly follow the full English translation of Schmidt (1998).

This person, Antigonus says, engaged in his own destruction and that of his forefathers around his 25th year.24 He was of most eminent and illustrious birth on both his father's and his mother's side, a most highly esteemed person, but he died a violent death. For, after he had developed great expectations, and when he already seemed to be moving straight to the throne, he was ill-advised around his 25th year and made a deadly mistake. Being denounced to the emperor, he was destroyed along with a certain old man of his family who was accused, too, because of him. Furthermore, all his family members were relegated to humble conditions.23 We further learn about two personal characteristics that make the young man seem unqualified to imperial dignity: he yielded to erotic passions and was fond of gladiators.26 Unlike Hadrian's horoscope, which does not add significant elements to historical knowledge,27 the horoscope of Pedanius enables us to correct 17 Heph. 2,18,34: πολλούς αντιδίκους καί επίβουλους. 18 Heph. 2,18,35: τό δέ περιγενέσθαι των έχθρων των τοιούτων. 19 Heph. 2,18,23: ώς θεός έτιμήθη ναόϊς και τεμένεσιν. 20 Heph. 2,18,36: τό δέ τιμασθαι αυτόν και προσκυνεϊσθαι παρά πάντων. 21 Heph. 2,18,23: γυναικί μια συζευχθείς από παρθενίας έγένετο οίτεκνος. 22 Heph. 2,18,23: και άδελφήν μίαν έσχεν, έν ύπονοία δέ και στάσει έγένετο προς τούς ιδίους. 23 Heph. 2,18,24: περί δέ ξγ έτη γενόμενος τελευτα ύδρωπικη δύσπνοια περιπε-σών. 24 Heph. 2,18,62: Öv φησιν έπ' όλέθρω τω τε ίδίω καί των πατέρων γεγενήσθαι περί τό κε' έτος. 25 Heph. 2,18,65: ό τοιούτος έκ μεγίστου γένους καί προφανούς, λέγω δή πατρός καί μητρός, ένδοξότατος μέν, βιαιοθανατήσας δέ [conieci, ένδοξοτάτων μέν, βιαιοθανατησάντων δέ codd.]· ούτος γαρ έλπίδων μεγάλων γενόμενος καί δοκών ήδη επί βασιλείαν έλθεΐν, κακόβουλος γενόμενος περί τό κε' έτος έσ-φάλη καί έν κατηγορία προς τον βασιλέα γενόμενος άνηρέθη μετά τίνος πρεσβύτου των τού γένους αύτού (έν διαβολή καί αυτού γενομένου δι αυτόν, προς δ' έτι των άπό τού γένους αύτού πάντων δι' αύτόν ταπεινως άπηλλαγ-μένων).

Following Cassius Dio, scholars long believed that Pedanius died at the age of 18, in 136 CE.28 Antigonus, however, emphasizes that the young man died in his 25th year.29 Since the birth configuration de-scribed is that of 5 or 6 April 113 CE, the fatal 25th year extends from April 137 to April 138. As Cramer has pointed out, it is likely that Pedanius made his deadly mistake not after the adoption of Aelius Caesar in 136, as has long been assumed because of Cassius Dio's report, but after the unofficial desig-nation of Antoninus Pius on 24 January 138 CE (made official on 25 Febru-ary 138 CE).30 Pedanius seems to have been put to death in the following weeks, between the end of February and the beginning of April. Maybe Ser-vianus was not immediately forced to commit suicide, but it was certainly before the tenth of July, when Hadrian himself died.31 2. The Literary Form of the Preserved Horoscopes Since Hadrian was hated by many for the cruel decisions against Pedanius, Servianus, and other senators,32 one wonders at the positive picture of him the credibility of the late reference to a plurality of sisters in the odd letter allegedly written by Hadrian to his mother and quoted by Ps.-Dosith. herm.

Did Antigonus, maybe, write in the very year 138 CE and aim to please either the dying emperor or his successor with an astrological apology? And did he later include this very text in a manual? In order to answer these questions, it is important to deter-mine the literary form of the transmitted text. That we are not dealing with a copy of an analysis presented at court is clear from the following typical fea-tures of astrological manuals: In Hadrian's horoscope, Antigonus addresses not the emperor or his successor, but a fictitious disciple, reminding him of what he should not forget, guiding him to the correct solution of various problems, and anticipating questions by one who is being introduced to the art. On several occasions, Antigonus makes a threefold distinction of pos-sible cases and their different consequences. This is appropriate for a manual with a general purpose of instruction, but superfluous in a text where only one specific set of data is at issue. Hadrian's natal configuration is presented in an extremely brief man-ner, which is typical of exemplary horoscopes in manuals, but totally different from any original deluxe-horoscope that we know.33 All personal names are suppressed.34 Since the horoscopes of Hadrian and Pedanius were, at least in their pre-served form, -written for an astrological manual, let us determine what kind of intertextual relation, if any, exists between them. One might think of a com-parative analysis like those five included by Vettius Valens in his Antholo-giae (around 175 CE). The terminus technicus employed by Valens is σύγκρισις (see Val. 5,6,91 and 7,3,17 in the critical edition of Pingree 33 On Hadrian's configuration (Heph. 2,18,22), see above after note 14. Original de-luxe-horoscopes on papyrus (some thirty of them are completely or partially pre-served) usually give detailed and solemnly arranged additional information on astrological 'houses,' 'exaltations,' 'terms,' 'decans,' bright fixed stars, etc. This in-formation sometimes comprises some 50 or more lines of text. Furthermore, it is important to note that the preserved deluxe-horoscopes were not written for the Roman court but for comparatively unimportant individuals. In fact, most of these texts have been discovered in the ancient rubbish mounds of Oxyrhynchus. Hence, one should expect an analysis written for any member of the Roman court to be even more solemnly arranged. 34 This is typical of Greek literary horoscopes in a didactic context. In original horo-scopes for private individuals, the name of the native is often, though not always, mentioned. Officially, of course, any investigation of the emperor's horoscope was strictly forbidden by empire-wide legal restrictions and edicts; see Cramer 1954, 248-281. There must, however, have been special conditions for astrologers in the emperor's (or his successor's) service which—in the absence of any preserved horo-scopic text that had been presented to a Roman emperor or members of his court— are simply not known.

On another occasion we learn about a woman who sued her husband concern-ing inheritance. The husband won the suit, but when the case was appealed two years later, he lost. According to Valens's analysis, the course of events was in every detail predetermined in each of the two natal configurations (Val.7,6,27-44 [= no. L 124 and L 134,VI]). In his most complex σύγκρισις. Valens discusses the horoscopes of six people who almost died together in a storm at sea in 154 CE.35 It is a common feature of all of Valens's συγκρίσεις that horoscopes belonging together are discussed in immediate succession, that the relation between them is made clear, and that the presen-tation of the astronomical data follows the same pattern. The case of Antigonus is different. Hephaestio makes it clear that he is presenting the preserved horoscopes in their original order: first Hadrian, second an anonymous one, third Pedanius. Α σύγκρισις, if there is any to be detected, would require that the second individual be involved in one and the same event with Hadrian and Pedanius; in other words, that the second indi-vidual be Iulius Servianus. The configuration is that of 5 or 6 April 40 CE. If Cassius Dio and the Historia Augusta are correct in saying that Servianus was put to death at the age of 90 (Cass. Dio 69,17,1; Hist. Aug. Hadr. 15,8; 23,8; 25,8), this is eight years too early. Let us nevertheless take a closer look at this second nativity (Heph. 2,18,54-61). Antigonus calls it a splendid and very notable horoscope.36 The native is a very distinguished man, one of au-thority who punishes many. He is very wealthy, and unjust without ever be-ing accused.37 He happens to be disinterested with regard to female intercourse and sordid with regard to male intercourse.38 Antigonus under-lines, partly repeating himself, that this man is fortunate and very wealthy, one who provides many votive offerings and gifts to his fatherland.39 35 Val. 7,6,127-160 (= no.

Aelius Hadrianus Afer,41 the emperor Hadrian's father; Barnes (1976, 76-79) tried to make Hadrian's friend L. Licinius Sura42 plausible, and Caballos Rufino (1986, esp. 124; 1990, 35f.) proposed first M. Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus43 and some years later the praetorian prefect P. Acilius Attianus.44 None of these identifications is certain, but Birley in his recent biography of Hadrian concludes—rightly, in my view—that Acilius Attianus is the most plausible candidate (Birley 1997, 3279 and 35526). Attianus be-came an enemy of the emperor shortly after Hadrian's accession to power, and he probably was long dead when Pedanius and Servianus were put to death. Taking into consideration two additional details, namely that the text offers no explicit connection between the three horoscopes and that the pres-entation of the astronomical data is notably different in each case, one can only conclude that what we have is not a σύγκρισις. This result calls for explanation because even if what we have is not a literarily shaped συγκρισις, some kind of comparative analysis seems to lie behind the horoscopes, at least in the case of Hadrian and Pedanius. There are three arguments in favor of this assumption: Hadrian is alluded to in Pedanius's horoscope and vice versa: in Ha-drian's horoscope, Antigonus discusses the discord between Hadrian and his relatives (Heph. 2,18,23; see note 22 above), and in the horo-scope of Pedanius he explains why the young man was put to death together with an older relative by the emperor (Heph. 2,18,65; see note 25 above). The historical and moral judgments expressed in both texts are consis-tent: Antigonus praises the emperor and condemns Pedanius. The astrological arguments employed in both texts also fit into one consistent view. In Hadrian's horoscope, for example, the identity of those relatives with whom the emperor was at odds is not specified, but it is astrologically explained through the position of Saturn and Mercury in the twelfth place,45 that is, by the meeting of the mythic grandfather and his grandson in the place of enmity. This makes sense especially if the emperor's main opponent is a relative two genera-40 Martin 1982, 295-298.

It is likely, therefore, that Antigonus made a σύγκρισις before writing the horoscopes as preserved through Hephaestio. Maybe there even existed a written version of this comparative analysis, either for his personal use or for other purposes, which Antigonus later reworked and separated into two or more single dis-cussions for inclusion in his manual. But this is very uncertain, and we should stick to the first, more likely assumption. 3. Was Antigonus a Court Astrologer? What strikes us is the unparalleled length and elaboration of Hadrian's horo-scope. Among the more than 300 preserved horoscopes from Graeco-Roman antiquity, there are only two similar texts, although they are shorter and dated much later: the horoscope of Ceionius Rufius Albinus (born in 303 CE, con-sul in 335 CE; see PLRE I 37 s.v. Albinus 14), which was cast by the con-temporary senator Firmicus Maternus (Firm. math. 2,29,10-20; see Neuge-bauer 1953, 418-420), and that of Pamprepius of Panopolis (440^84 CE; see PLRE II 825-828), a leading figure in the rebellion against emperor Zeno in 484 (see Delatte and Stroobant 1923; Neugebauer and van Hoesen 1959, 140f., no. L 440; Pingree 1976, 136. 142. 144-147), which was in all prob-ability cast by an astrologer in the service of emperor Zeno. It is important to realize that both these horoscopes were written in close temporal proximity to the political events reported, and that the authors had close relations with the 46 This interpretation does not seem exaggerated because the text presents more in-stances of the same kind of genealogical reasoning (Heph. 2,18,48; 2,18,66), which will be discussed in the commentary announced in note 3. 47 As opposed to other possible causes like wild beasts or the elements. 48 Heph. 2,18,66: τό δέ και έξ άνθρωπου είναι την βλάβην δια τό τον \"Αρεα είναι έν άνθρωποειδέΐ ζφδίφ. 49 Heph. 2,18,22: έγένετο, φησί, τις έχων τον μεν \"Ηλιον Ύδροχόου μοίρα η', τήν δέ Σελήνην και τον Δία και τον ώροσκόπον αμα τούς γ επί της πρώτης μοίρας τοϋ αύτοϋ ζωδίου. 50 And, besides, by the first and most powerful of all 'human beings,' the Roman Em-peror.

Maybe Antigonus's situation was not much different. We have no evidence when and where exactly he lived during the period from Hadrian's death to the end of the second century CE,51 but it seems worth examining the possibility that he lived and wrote in the environment of the Roman court during Hadrian's later reign and/or the early part of Antoninus Pius's reign. From Hephaestio's excerpts one gets the impression that Hadrian's horoscope was the first and most impressive in Antigonus's collection.52 Its unusual elaboration points to a date of composition shortly after Hadrian's death, when the deceased emperor was still among the most interesting ob-jects of astrological investigation. Since he was hated by many at the time of his death and the senate did everything in its power to prevent his deification, Hadrian's life would have been an intriguing example of a rise from rather modest origins to the highest splendor, eventually followed by decline and isolation. But Antigonus, instead of investigating this change of fortune, con-veys a one-sided, somewhat disappointing message: Hadrian is to be praised in every respect; his enemies were all wrong and failed.53 This message would not be surprising, however, if Antigonus was an astrologer at the Ro-man court. If the Historia Augusta can be trusted (not in each detail, but in its basic characterization of the emperor), Hadrian was seriously interested in astrology,54 and it may be assumed that there were professional astrologers at his court, like, for instance, the famous Thrasyllus at the court of Tiberius. If Antigonus was an official court astrologer, he would certainly have praised the emperor and assumed a hostile attitude towards the emperor's enemies. At some point, he might then have decided to set down his accumulated ex-perience in a manual and to illustrate the book using his precious collection of astrological analyses made over a span of years or decades. There is an interesting parallel in the late fifth century. As Pingree has shown, the afore-mentioned horoscope of Pamprepius of Panopolis formed part of a collection of political horoscopes from the reign of Zeno, all cast, as it seems, by one 51 The terminus ante quern is his being referred to by the astrologer Antiochus of Ath-ens. See Ps.-Porph. isag. 51 in CCAG V,4 (1940), p. 223,14-21 (= Rhetor. 5,15); and Pingree 2001, 9 (\"most of this must be a summary of a work by Antiochus\"). Antiochus can be dated to about the end of the second century. 52 Either in the collection as a whole or, if the manual contained several sections with exempla, in the one dedicated to political horoscopes. 53 The only negative thing we learn about his end is the painful physical illness (see below note 64). 54 See Cramer 1954, 162-178, which is to be read cautiously because of his uncritical use of the Historia Augusta (see the judgements of Syme 1976, 2912; and Tester 1987, 5015) and because of numerous errors in astrological detail. See further the critical analysis of the Historia Augusta by Kuhlmann 2002, 97-172, esp. 105-115 and 171 (as to astrological technique, however, Kuhlmann reveals shortcomings similar to Cramer's, esp. 108f.).

In three cases it is shown that prominent rebels were fated to revolt in vain: these are Pamprepius (see above), Basiliscus,57 and Leontius.58 In the case of the Ostrogothic leader Theodoric Valamer who had devastated large parts of Greece, it is shown that conferring the consulship upon him in order to get his aggressive energy under control would not dangerously en-hance the barbarian troublemaker's power. The remaining two horoscopes are similar in purpose.59 The parallel to Antigonus's case is even closer if Caballos Rufino and Birley are right in attributing the second horoscope preserved by Hephaestio to the praetorian prefect, Acilius Attianus, who became Hadrian's enemy shortly after Hadrian's coronation (see above). If Antigonus lived and wrote at the Roman court, his manual would have found the favor of all those who were interested in the stars and owed their political positions to Hadrian. They might have read the preserved text (and even more so an explicit σύγκρισις, if Antigonus in fact wrote one and had it circulated in imperial circles) as a legitimation of Hadrian, as a cosmic proof that the historical course of events had been right and necessary:60 The scientific61 demon-stration that it had been Hadrian's fate to become emperor wipes away as nonsense all rumors that Trajan had died without nominating a successor and that his widow, Plotina, had faked Hadrian's adoption.62 The analysis of Ped-anius's horoscope shows that he was not suitable for imperial power and dig-55 They are all edited and discussed in Pingree 1976. 56 One case is slightly different; see note 59 about the prefect Theodoras. 57 He was emperor in Byzantium from January 475 to August 476 CE. See PLRE II 212-214 s.v. Basiliscus 2. 58 On Leontius (d. 488 CE) see PLRE II 670-671 s.v. Leontius 17; and Neugebauer and van Hoesen 1959, 147-148, no. L 484. 59 One of them is of a new born son of emperor Leo, Zeno's father in law, who might have become Zeno's rival. It is shown that the child was fated to die after some months. The sixth horoscope concerns a certain Theodoras whom Zeno had ap-pointed to the prefecture of Egypt; we learn why this magistrate came to fall after a brief period of success. The horoscopes concerning Basiliscus, Theodoric Valamer, Leontius, and Theodoras are not nativities but catarchic analyses of the respective dates of coronation (in the case of Theodoras, of the time when he entered Alexan-dria). The first two horoscopes are preserved only in an Arabic version. 60 Despite the legally requested anonymity, educated contemporaries would certainly have understood the reference to Hadrian. Compare the later case of Firmicus Ma-ternus who, towards the end of his aforementioned, anonymously presented horo-scope of the consul Ceionius Rufius Albinus, remarks: cuius haec genitura sit, Lol-liane decus nostrum, optime nosti (Firm. math. 2,29,20). 61 In the ancient sense, considering astrology as a science. 62 See Millar 1964, 63: \"It is probable that the circumstances of Hadrian's accession were from the first a subject of dispute\"; Birley 1997, 289: \"his adoption [...] was thought by many to have been fraudulent.\" Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 Stephan Heilen nity, that it was necessary to choose another heir to the throne and, conse-quently, to remove the dangerous young pretender. Finally, Antigonus's in-vestigation of Hadrian's death could be read as a proof that it was not the famous curse of Servianus63 that had caused Hadrian's painful end, but that his κακοθανασία had long before, at Hadrian's birth, been determined by the unchangeable laws of the universe.64 4. An Alternative Explanation It must, however, be emphasized again that there is no definitive proof for Antigonus's association with the Roman court. A basic difficulty is to decide whether Antigonus aimed at illustrating the tenets and demonstrating the truth of astrology by means of famous political horoscopes or whether he aimed at legitimating politics by means of astrology, or maybe both, giving more prominence to one or the other aspect on different occasions. On closer inspection, the hypothesis that Antigonus was a Roman court astrologer re-veals, besides its advantages, several weak points. No doubt it allows an easy explanation of how Antigonus had managed to be so well informed and to know even details like the birth dates of minor figures like Acilius Attianus (?)65 and Pedanius Fuscus. But since the preserved text was evidently part of a manual written for didactic purposes (see the arguments above before note 34), the comparative analysis that possibly lies behind it—but which cannot be proven to have ever actually been composed—becomes an important missing link. Only if that σύγκρισις existed and contained clear references to people, political events, etc., would the assumption that Antigonus was a court astrologer deserve closer attention. The preserved fragments alone seem too veiled to serve a political, legitimating, or adulatory purpose. Besides, the available sources on the reign of Antoninus Pius do not record any predilec-tion of this ruler for astrology or other forms of divination (see Cramer 1954, 180). And there is one puzzling element that does not seem likely to please 63 See Cass. Dio 69,17,2. Michelotto (1987, 189) and Birley (1997, 291) consider the curse of Servianus to be authentic. 64 See Heph. 2,18,51: τοΰτο ouv κακοθανασίας αύτω αίτιον γέγονεν. Furthermore, the analysis of Hadrian's childlessness (Heph. 2,18,46) could be directed against gossip saying that Hadrian's wife, Vibia Sabina, purposely avoided pregnancy in order not to produce a monster (see Ps. Aur. Vict. epit. 14,8: huius uxor Sabina, dum prope servilibus iniuriis afficitur, ad mortem voluntariam compulsa. quae palam iactabat se, quod immane ingenium probavisset, elaborasse, ne ex eo ad hu-mani generis perniciem gravidaretur). 65 If this identification is correct.

It is therefore necessary to pay equal attention to the alternative pos-sibility, namely that Antigonus was just a 'regular' Greek astrologer who lived and worked in Roman Egypt (Alexandria?), like so many others, one who had nothing to do with the Roman court. In this case the main difficulty regards Antigonus's source(s): Where did he get his detailed information, and why does he take such a positive view of Hadrian while the prevailing atti-tude after 138 CE was hostile? The question concerning the source(s) under-lying the historical data in Hadrian's horoscope was already raised by Boll (Boll 1908, 1142 = Boll 1950, 141), but it has never been answered. Maybe this has to do with the aggravating circumstance that no second century histo-rian's account of Hadrian's reign survives.69 Nevertheless, there is a possible source available, one that in the present author's view deserves close exami-nation: the emperor's autobiography, comprising at least two books and composed—in all probability—during the last months of his life. 66 Heph. 2,18,38: Έρμης δέ καi Κρόνος έν τω ιβ' τυχόντες έπι έφας ανατολής και δορυφοροϋντες τον \"Ηλιον ποιοϋσι φρονίμους, πεπαιδευμένους, οϋ μήν άγα-θοθελεΐς αλλά δολερούς (this is the text of the epitome; cod.

A masterly analysis of this kind that does not indulge in inappropriate speculation has been made by Lewis (Lewis 1993; on Hadrian: 697-702). Lewis never men-tions the horoscopes of Antigonus of Nicaea, but his results should clearly be applied to them. As he shows, Hadrian's De vita sua stands in a long Roman tradition of autobiographical literature that can be traced back at least to the second century BCE. This literature can best be approached with a broad definition of the term 'autobiography,' including not only comprehensive accounts of entire lives, but also commentarii by outstanding Roman indi-viduals on chronologically limited military campaigns and political crises. As Lewis shows, a common feature of almost all these texts is self-advertisement and apologia, often obtained through appraisals of perils (discrimina) and designs (consilia) to handle them. Already Q. Lutatius Catulus published his Liber de consulatu et rebus gestis suis with the intention of an apologia for failure in his campaign against the Cimbri in 102 BCE, and to contest with C. Marius the credit for victory in 101 BCE (Lewis 1993, 636). The need for apologetic autobiography became all the more urgent in the case of controversial leaders with unprecedented power during the civil wars and the early principate, like Sulla who composed 22 books on his life, and young Augustus, who published 13 books in order to show, among other things, his legitimacy as Caesar's heir and his personal ability to rule the em-pire. Altogether we know of autobiographical writings—either partial or comprehensive71—for several Roman emperors between Augustus and Ha-drian: Tiberius, Claudius, Vespasian, Titus, and Trajan, and we should not omit those relatives, vice-regents, and military leaders who might be deemed in some degree capaces imperii·.

Suetonius Paulinus, and Agrippina the Younger.72 Whenever a comprehensive autobiography was undertaken, a certain standard format seems to have been applied, which had developed during the last two centuries of the Roman Republic. From several laudationes of Cicero, Lewis reconstructs the following model that could easily be applied, with due modifications, to a variety of individual cases and needs: \"ancestry, origo, parentage; birth, boyhood and education; toga virilis, tirocinium fori and/or prima militia (stipendia); honores, each with its appropriate res 70 Collected by Peter 1906, 117-118.

The preserved fragments of Hadrian's De vita sua indicate strongly that Hadrian followed the same standard format (Lewis 1993, 700). And there must have been many apologetic elements. This is certain in the case of the alleged conspiracy of the four consular es (118 CE) who were executed, according to Hadrian (Frg. 4 Peter = Hist. Aug. Hadr. 7,1-2), on the orders of the senate and contrary to his own wishes. Furthermore, \"it is inconceivable that Hadrian failed to assert the strongest possible claim to be a worthy and legitimate successor of Trajan, with particular stress on the validity, probably disputed even at the time, of the famous death bed adoption.\"73 And it is more than likely that he gave an acceptable explanation of the deaths of Ped-anius Fuscus and Iulius Servianus, probably in connection with the problems and dangers inherent in providing for the succession to his own principate.74 In view of these and related arguments,75 it is clear that most, if not every aspect of Hadrian's life discussed by Antigonus (see above after note 14), as well as the data concerning Acilius Attianus (?) and Pedanius Fuscus, could have been drawn from Hadrian's autobiography. As far as we know, it had been published in a Greek version as well, the work of Hadrian's learned freedman Phlegon of Tralleis (see Hist. Aug. Hadr. 16,1; Lewis 1993, 698 ad loc.). Publication of leading men's memoirs in both Latin and Greek was a traditional way of addressing the entire audience of the Mediterranean world. Already P. Rutilius Rufus, Sulla (through L. Lucullus), Cicero, and Augustus (through Nikolaos of Damaskos) had done the same.76 Since Hadrian wrote De vita sua during the last months or even weeks of his life, it would not be surprising if Phlegon, in his Greek version, supplied some final information on the emperor's death, specifying its date and medical cause. Compare the case of Sulla, whose freedman Epicadus completed the last of the 22 books of the dictator's memoirs.77 Antigonus would in all probability have read Phle-gon's Greek version; consequently, his discussion of the time and cause of Hadrian's death (See Heph. 2,18,24 [see note 23 above] and 2,18,49) is not necessarily an argument against the hypothesis that he based the three pre-served horoscopes on the emperor's autobiography. 73 Lewis 1993, 699-700. Compare the harsh verdict of Cass. Dio 69,1,1: 'Αδριανός δέ ύπό μεν Τραϊανού ούκ έσεποιήθη (\"Hadrian has not been adopted by Trajan\"). 74 Lewis 1993, 701-702 (Lewis's date 136 CE should be corrected to 138 CE; see above before note 30). 75 They will be discussed in more detail in my monograph announced in note 3. 76 See Lewis 1993, 6302; 63620; 662110; 672; 698.

Our astrologer would simply reflect the apologetic tendency of his source without a deliberate or systematic intention of doing so.78 Not a few ancient historians, for different reasons and to various extents, used imperial autobiography in exactly the same way. For example, Lewis points out that \"Appian's account of the Illyrian campaign [scil. 35-33 BCE], almost certainly from Augustus,79 shows concern to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and evasion of a charge for what might easily in fact have been genocide.\"80 Only two elements of Antigonus's three preserved horoscopes require further explanation: the birth-dates of Acilius Attianus (?) and Pedanius Fus-cus, which are implicit in the astronomical data of their horoscopes.81 These must have been much more easily accessible to someone who lived in the environment of the Roman court than to a resident of, let us say, Alexandria. But alternative explanations are not impossible: Antigonus could have had some kind of informant or correspondent in the capital,82 or maybe he also drew these data from Hadrian's autobiography: We know that omina and divination played an important role already in Sulla's and Augustus's autobi-ographies, 3 and it is beyond doubt that Hadrian included similar features. One omen is attested among the six preserved fragments of his memoirs.84 After examination of all the available direct and indirect evidence \"may we suppose that Hadrian [scil. in his autobiography] made liberal use of astro-logical and perhaps other means of prophecy in claiming not so much per-haps skill in the art as the sanction of Fate.\"85 78 Compare the otherwise inexplicable slip in the remark on Hadrian's being not well-intentioned, but crafty and deceitful (note 66 above). 79 Appian explicitly cites Augustus's autobiography (App. Illyr. 14 = frg. 13 Peter). 80 Lewis 1993, 680; see ibid. 679-683 on similar assimilation of apologetic features from Augustus's autobiography by other Greek and Roman historians. 81 That Hadrian's own date and place of birth were mentioned in the autobiography is beyond question because these elements are part of the 'standard format.' 82 Theoretically the two birth-dates in question could even be pure invention; but this is unlikely. 83 See Lewis 1993, 667 and 686. The same is true in the later case of Septimius Severus's autobiography (see ibid. 706). 84 Hist. Aug.

Conclusion In view of the preceding arguments, there is a strong possibility that Anti-gonus of Nicaea was inspired by Hadrian's autobiography (in the Greek ver-sion of Phlegon of Tralleis) to analyze the emperor's and some related individuals' horoscopes. The necessary data will have been completely—or almost completely—available from the same source. If this is so, the pre-served astrological fragments are not to be considered as independent histori-cal documents, but as testimonia of this lost imperial autobiography and its apologetic traits. Even some biographical details that have long been disputed by modern historians could, then, be definitively ascertained, like Hadrian's birthplace (Rome, not Italica)86 and his number of sisters (one, not several; see above note 27). All this would, in conclusion, allow us to speak in a se-cond, unexpected sense of 'the emperor Hadrian in the horoscopes of Anti-gonus of Nicaea'.

Introduction In 475 and 484 CE rebellions took place against the Eastern Roman emperor, Zeno. Horoscopes for the proclamations of the two rebel emperors survive and the texts were published by Neugebauer and van Hoesen in 1959 (p. 147), and Pingree in 1962. Pingree suggested that the rebellions may have been associated with pagan opposition to the Christianizing tendencies of Byzantine culture. The texts present us with a problem, however, for analysis of the astrological reasoning given in these charts, combined with the exami-nation of the actual disposition of the observable planets, suggests that the astrology being used may have had little to do with fifth century Greek horo-scopic astrology. An alternative hypothesis, which is developed in this paper, is that the rebel emperors' astrologers may have been working within a con-text provided by solar religion and a surviving tradition of observation-based Babylonian astrology. If so, the conclusions add to a picture of complexity and diversity in the religious world of Late Antiquity. 2. The Religious Environment in the Fifth Century The religious climate in the late Roman Empire was complex and the rela-tionship between Christianity and paganism defies simple categorization.1 It has been argued, for example, that, in spite of the periodic and sometimes brutal persecutions of Christians, there is little evidence of pagan-Christian 1 See the discussion in Cameron 1993, esp. pp, 67-98.

The Vandal kingdom in North Africa was Arian and, after years of intermittent harassment, king Huneiric (477-484) ordered all Catholics to convert to Arianism (Moorhead 1994, 65). Christian-ity's very diversity was the reason why there were such persistent attempts to establish and enforce a single set of dogmas, beginning with the Council of Nicaea in 325. There also appears to have been a substantial problem (from the Church authorities' perspective) of Christians converting to Judaism (Cameron 1993, 77), suggesting that the boundaries between different reli-gious groups could be extremely fluid. The dispute between paganism and Christianity, it is true, could be bitter. When the emperor Aurelian died in 275, the year after he instated the worship of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, as the state religion, he was \"apparently planning a new attack on the Christians\" (Salway 1981, 715). After an unsuccessful revolt by a pagan sympathizer, Magnentius, who reigned from 350-353, the emperor Constantius II (337-361) enacted a series of anti-pagan measures in 353-354 (Cameron 1993, 75), establishing a pat-tern which continued in spite of the attempt by the emperor Julian, Constan-tine's nephew, to restore the official pagan religion in 360-363. Theodosius I (379-395), the last man to rule the entire empire before its disintegration in the west, was strongly anti-pagan. He presided over a spate of violent assaults by Christians on pagan sacred sites, and passed laws prohibiting pagan rites in 391 and 392. The worst violence of his reign occurred in Alexandria, where the bishop organized the destruction of the Serapeum, the temple of the Egyptian god Serapis and reputedly one of the most magnificent build-ings in the empire. The direct consequence was a rebellion in 393 which, though led by a Christian, Eugenius, attracted widespread support from aris-tocratic pagans (Cameron 1993, 75), an illustration of the complexity of theo-logical-political allegiances. As John Moorhead put it, \"intellectual culture in late antiquity was subject to currents which flowed in different directions\" (1994, 28). Within the Roman elite itself, the Senate, based in Rome, remained far more friendly to paganism than did the emperors, whose capital in Italy was now at Milan. Neither were the emperors necessarily hostile to the old ways. Their principle task was to maintain order and their interests were not necessarily served by enforcing religious laws against a substantial pagan population. Aside from concerns of state, the pagan-Christian debate also involved genuinely rival cosmologies, with pagans accepting the stars as a possible route to the divine and Christians denying this, insisting that the 2 See the discussion in Hutton 1991.

The authoritative Christian theological position on astrology was established by Augustine when he com-plained that Manichaeism, of which he had been an adherent when he prac-ticed astrology, came too close to worshipping the sun and the moon, in other words, worshipping the creation rather than the creator (Augustine, Confes-sions III.6; City of God V.30). However, as an illustration of the fluid nature of philosophical boundaries, Augustine had a high respect for Platonists who were themselves among the strongest advocates of astrology (while some-times being critical of both its practitioners and Aristotelian cosmology).3 Pagan teaching continued at a high level in the Platonic Academy in Athens, which offered a safe home to philosophical supporters of solar relig-ion. As Cameron has pointed out, the major intellectual alternative to Christi-anity in the late Roman Empire was provided by Neoplatonism and its leading advocates, including Proclus (412^485), one of the last and most no-table official teachers at the Academy (Cameron 1993, 80f.). For many, it was the state sun religion, Sol Invictus, which represented a preferable alter-native to Christianity (Halsberghe 1972). Indeed, among Proclus's surviving works are a series of hymns, of which one, the Hymn to Helios, the sun, is illustrative: Hear golden Titan! King of mental fire, Ruler of light; to thee supreme belongs The splendid key of life's prolific fount; And from on high thou pour'st harmonic streams In rich abundance into matter's worlds. Hear! For high rais'd above th' aetherial plains, And in the world's bright middle orb thou reign'st Whilst all things by thy sov'reign power are fill'd With mind-exciting providential care. The starry fires surround thy vig'rous fire, And ever in unweary'd ceaseless dance, Over earth wide bosom'ed, vivid dew diffuse. By thy perpetual and repeated course The hours and seasons in succession rise.4 The religious tone of Proclus's Neoplatonism and its close relationship to the worship of Sol Invictus is unmistakable. The rivalry between paganism and Christianity was all the sharper because they both (particularly the pagan re-ligions of Isis, Dionysus, and Mithras) \"took on universalist claims and pre-tensions, such as the offer of salvation\" (Eisner 1998, 200; see also Fowden 3 For Augustine on Platonists, see City of God VIII.6-12, and for the Platonic position on astrology, see Plotinus, \"On Whether the Stars are Causes,\" Ennead II, 3. 4 Proclus, \"Hymn to the Sun,\" trans.

Pingree's argument that Basiliscus's and Leontius's rebellions can be seen as pagan challenges to the rising Christian orthodoxy suggests that both may be seen within the context of competing world views as well as personal ambition. The apparent use of astrology in both rebellions then be-comes a sub-text in the historical narrative of Christianity's complex strag-gles with paganism. 3. Basiliscus's Revolt The first of the two horoscopes translated by Neugebauer and van Hoesen, and Pingree, was set for the rebellion of Basiliscus against the Eastern Ro-man emperor Zeno in 475. By this time the empire was in a deep and pro-longed crisis. It had been coping with massive Germanic migrations for most of the century; in 410 Rome had been sacked by the Visigoths, a trauma re-peated in 455 at the hands of the Vandals. In the year after Basiliscus's rebel-lion, 476, Romulus Augustulus became the last emperor to live in Italy, and his abdication marked what is often considered the end of the Roman Empire in the West. Basiliscus's reign was itself short-lived and he was defeated by Zeno in July 477, having alienated all his supporters, especially those in the mainstream church. Basiliscus was extremely well connected; he was brother-in-law to Leo I (457-474) and uncle to Leo's daughter Ariadne, Zeno's wife (Norwich 1988, 165; see also 169f., 174, 178, 206). Basiliscus was not himself a pagan, which complicates Pingree's argument that his revolt was part of a pagan reaction to Christianity, but it is nevertheless perfectly plausible, given the precedent of the Christian-pagan collaboration in Eugenius's revolt. More-over, that Basiliscus was a heretic, a Monophysite, who rejected Christ's di-vinity, was a factor in his failure to secure lasting support in Byzantium. His educated, Hellenized instincts also hint at some sympathy for the Neoplatonic position. If the horoscopic sources are correct and Basiliscus authorized the use of astrology, further questions arise: did either his Monophysite alle-giance or possible Platonic inclinations make it possible for him to use as-trology where a more orthodox emperor would have refused? Clearly, Christian-pagan rivalry was not bi-polar but multi-faceted, with complex ri-valries and affinities. Pingree noted that there had been a lunar eclipse on 8 January 475 which, being interpreted as a bad omen for Zeno, might have precipitated Basiliscus's revolt. The time for the coronation itself is assumed to have been elected by Basiliscus's astrologer who was employed by another general, Illus.

It must be supposed that this horoscope, if set for a genuine astrological moment, was set for an event which may have been considered of astrologi-cal significance but preceded the revolt itself. In the Greek text the horoscope is referred to as a katarche, a word which can be translated simply as 'initiative.' The word also suggests, though, the descent of the archetype, and so potentially has clear significance in a Neoplatonic context; the horoscope may be set for the launch of a new enterprise, but it is one which carries the sanction of heaven. The house posi-tions given in the text are consistent with the assumption that the two horo-scopes would have been calculated using whole sign houses, in which the cusp of the sign containing the horoscopos, or ascendant, was also the cusp of the first house. 2.1. Commentary on the Katarche for the Coronation of Basiliscus at 9:00 am, 12 January 475, at Constantinople. There is a tension between positive and negative readings of the horoscope. To begin with, the following were given as reasons for Basiliscus's astrolo-ger's belief that this was an auspicious moment: (1) Venus, one of the most benevolent planets was \"at the midheaven.\" In fact it was not, but this statement may refer to Libra's elevated po-sition, since Venus rules Libra (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.17, p. 81). (2) Venus is lord of the Lot of Fortune. (3) Venus is lord of the sun's triplicity, namely, the earthy triplicity (Tau-rus—Virgo—Capricorn—), because the sun is in Capricorn (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.18, p. 85). (4) Jupiter, the most benefic planet, aspects the sun \"from quartile\" (i.e., Jupiter is in Libra, the sun, in Capricorn). We are told that \"This indi-cates power and eminence and splendor.\"6 Against this positive reading, the following reasons were given to explain the failure of Basiliscus's revolt: (1) The sun is weak in the twelfth place (house) from the horoscopos, i.e., ascendant. (2) The sun is in the same sign as the descending (i.e. south) lunar node. 6 Yet see Firmicus Maternus: \"Those who have Jupiter in Libra will have disasters and riots in early life\" (Mathesis, V.iv.16, p. 176).

Thus Basiliscus will fall from the power and splendor indicated by the quartile from Jupiter to the sun. (4) Saturn, the most malefic planet, is (a) weak, being cadent in the sixth place, \"diminishing and evil in its influence\"; (b) important, being lord of the sun and the horoscopos; and (c) destructive, being quartile to Mars and opposed to the sun. (5) The moon is in the eighth house of death. (6) The moon is in Virgo, but is not aspected to Mercury, the ruler of Virgo. (7) Jupiter, the benefic planet, is weakened by the opposition from Mars. (8) The previous full moon was an eclipse, conjunct Saturn, and in quar-tile to Mars. The revised conclusion stated that, \"All of this indicates poverty, the loss of rulership and its diminution, and strife and evil and misery.\" 4. Leontius's Revolt In 484, nine years later and the year before Proclus's death, another general, Leontius, rebelled against Zeno in a last attempt to restore the pagan religion. According to the texts, he was advised by two astrologers who elected the time for his proclamation, which took place in Tarsus in Syria and, like Basi-liscus, was supported by the general, Illus. Zeno defeated Leontius with the assistance of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric, who was rewarded with Italy, over which Zeno was still nominal emperor. The horoscope and commentary survive in two versions; the Greek was translated by Neugebauer and van Hoesen (1959, 147) and the Persian by Pingree (1962). Pingree reports that Leontius was crowned at Tarsus, Neugebauer at Antioch; the data is consistent with a coronation at sunrise on 18 July 484 in Tarsus. Neugebauer's and Pingree's translations differ in style; for example, Neugebauer's \"Mercury in epanaphora\"7 is translated by Pin-gree as \"Mercury and how it happens to be in the second (place) from the ascendant, cadent [...].\"8 The astrological significance of the comment in Neugebauer's text that by the time the moon passed Jupiter, so would Venus, 7 Epanaphora = \"a sign which follows, in the order of signs of the zodiac, a centre\"; thus Taurus is the epanaphora if Aries in on the midheaven; \"that which immedi-ately follows a centre, which is one of the four angles\"; the zodiac signs on the cusps of houses 2, 5, 8, and 11 are called epanaphora.

Commentary on the Katarche for the Coronation of Leontius: 4:42 am, 18 July 484, Tarsus Let us first consider the original positive reading by Leontius's astrologer. According to the texts, Leontius's astrologer elected what he thought was the most auspicious moment possible on the basis of the following arguments: (1) The sun, Mars, and Jupiter were in the horoscopos, i.e., Cancer, the sign containing the ascendant. (2) Mercury was in epanaphora. (3) The moon was in the fifth locus (Scorpio), thus forming a benevolent relationship with the planets and the horoscopos in Cancer. (4) After its conjunction with Saturn, an aspect with profound malefic consequences, the moon forms a trine to Jupiter, a benevolent contact (N.B. although the text places Jupiter at 5°, its computed position is 17°). It is not clear how soon after Leontius's defeat the horoscope reading was revised, but subsequent astrologers found good reasons why the katarche was inauspicious. In their opinion: (1) Mercury, being extremely important as lord of the day (Wednesday) and hour, \"had fallen into passivity,\" being at its greatest elongation from the sun (from then on Mercury's speed relative to the sun began to slow down and the two bodies began to grow much closer). (2) Mercury was making only one aspect, a malefic square to Saturn (from Leo to Scorpio), indicating violent death. (3) Venus was unable to exert its benevolent role and relieve Mercury's passivity (Venus in Gemini was in a benefic relationship with Mer-cury in Leo, for the sun was between them). Pingree's version gives a different rationale: the Jami al-Kitab claims that Venus is unable to drive Saturn's maleficence away from the moon because it is cadent from the horoscopos, that is, in the second place (house) counting clockwise, an interesting claim as normally such places are counted anti-clockwise.

(5) The moon was in the twelfth locus from the Part of Fortune, that is the twelfth Athla, the Bad Daimon.9 (6) The sun at 26° is trine the moon at 7°, but Saturn at 17° blocks the beneficial results. The revised conclusion was that the beneficial effect of the sun-Jupiter-horoscopos conjunction is overwhelmed, the ruler of the sun and the moon, the two luminaries, are malefic, and Leontius can only rule for a short while. Note that neither the original nor revised readings considered what was later seen as a crucial relationship between the moon and Mars: that the moon was in Mars's sign, Scorpio, while Mars was in the moon's sign, Cancer. Neither is it mentioned that Venus would have been rising as morning star, a fact that would have been extremely significant to any group of solar pagans watching and waiting for the dawn. 5. Critical Analysis of the Horoscopes While the horoscopes for both rebellions may be subject to a variety of inter-pretations as the disputed readings which survive from the Persian manu-scripts show, the damning indications in both horoscopes are undeniable. However, any attempt to reconstruct the rules which may have been used by the fifth-century astrologers is hampered by the fragmentary nature of the literature, the diversity of opinions, and the uncertainty as to the extent to which the theoretical structures outlined in the written texts were actually applied by astrologers. There is a further problem: most of the surviving texts provide rules for the interpretation of nativities and almost none deal with katarchai, aside from brief passages in Dorotheus and Ptolemy.10 Neverthe-less, there is sufficient textual evidence from the rules for interpreting nativ-ities to suggest that both horoscopes should indeed be regarded as inauspicious. 9 The athla were twelve houses in which the cusp of the first house was the Part of Fortune.

In one brief section in Dorotheus of Sidon's first century Carmen Astrologicum, a text which does not survive in any Greek original, instructions are given to look at the power of Mars in order to determine the outcome of war.11 Ac-cording to the rules outlined by Ptolemy (though in relation to nativities), Mars in the horoscope for Basiliscus's coronation was strong, being in its own sign, Aries, which, he claimed, supported its \"destructive and inharmo-nious\" nature (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.17, p. 81). Yet, however strong Mars was in itself, it was still in an inharmonious square aspect to Saturn and the sun (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.13, p. 75). As Firmicus wrote (in line with stan-dard astrological tradition), \"If Saturn and Mars are in any aspect or together with the sun, this produces treacherous perjurers, miserable because of con-stant accusations of this crime. They will be gluttons, frequenters of secret dens of vice, and will be free with sacrilegious words against the gods. They will be disturbed by constant burning anxieties\" (Firmicus, Mathesis, trans. Bram, III.v., 16, p. 90). Had Firmicus not already stated unequivocally that not only was it wrong to comment on the emperor's horoscope, but that such a thing was theologically impossible,12 he might have mentioned that the sun was a universal and very public symbol of the emperor, and had been so since Nero became the first ruler to portray himself on his coins wearing a gold crown with solar rays. The sun-emperor relationship was an accepted part of imperial iconography in the fourth century. According to Ferguson, writing of the period immediately before Firmicus, when the emperor Con-stantine Chlorus (305-306) returned to Britain after defeating the usurper Allectus, \"the great medallion which he struck proclaimed him REDDITOR LVCIS AETERNAE, the restorer of eternal light; this is the emperor's sun-rise in other language\" (Ferguson 1972, 55). Ferguson adds that the same identification between the sun and emperor was followed by Constantine I, for whom the sun was, effectively, an ally. Whatever else can be said about this horoscope, only an astrologer wishing to see Basiliscus fail can have elected the time for his coronation with the sun applying to an opposition to malefic Saturn, no matter how weak that planet was, and a square to malefic Mars. An alternative hypothesis is that the astrologers' primary concern was not with the complex techniques of Hellenistic astrology but with observation of the night sky. 11 Dorotheus of Sidon, Carmen Astrologicum, ed. and trans. Pingree, V.30, 6-7, p. 291. 12 Firmicus, Mathesis, II, 4-5, p. 69. Firmicus still allowed himself to discuss general indicators of imperial status; see for example II.ii, 20.

Leontius's Katarche The horoscope for Leontius's coronation does indeed, as the positive reading claims, contain auspicious indications, and supporting evidence can be found in contemporary texts. For example, Firmicus, writing probably in 334, comments that \"Saturn in the fifth house, if by day, will make kings and lead-ers, very powerful men. But if the sun is on the degree of the ascendant and Saturn comes into conjunction with the waxing moon, continual good luck and great power are indicated\" (Firmicus, Mathesis, III.ii.10, p. 76). Yet, there is a problem with using the Mathesis as a reliable guide for fifth-century horoscope interpretation; Firmicus seems to have constructed the book entirely out of examples which are so specific that it is difficult to gen-eralize. For example, the above text is directly contradicted later in the same passage when we are told that \"if the waxing moon is in aspect with Saturn or moving toward him, this indicates widowhood for the mother and constant grief for the house of women\" (Firmicus, Mathesis, IV.ii.l). Firmicus added to the latter example the information that an individual born with this place-ment will work in a temple and lose their inheritance, but later gain it back through their own efforts, suggesting that he is attempting to extrapolate gen-eral rules from a single example. The best that can be said is that the indica-tions in the horoscope are ambivalent and, as is clear from the very brief rules for initiating new enterprises included in Dorotheus of Sidon's Carmen As-trologicum (ed./trans. Pingree, V.30.1-2, p. 290), benefic indications are bal-anced by malefic ones. It is undoubtedly true that the moon and Saturn in Scorpio are in a trine, a harmonious aspect (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.13, p. 75). Yet the moon's location in Scorpio, Mars's sign, in a conjunction with Saturn, is so serious as to completely destroy Leontius's chances of success. In spite of justified skepticism concerning Firmicus, his reading of the moon in aspect with Sat-urn is in line with the astrology of the time. 3 Saturn and Mars are, quite sim-ply, malefic planets (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos 1.5, p. 39). Valens's judgments on Mars's and Saturn's aspects to other planets were universally damning (The Anthology, Book IV, trans. Robert Schmidt, 20 and 22, pp. 50-52, 54-56). As Dorotheus wrote, \"if a malefic is with it [the moon] or aspects it, it will cut off [his] hope\" (Carmen Astrologicum, 1.21 .ii, p. 224). Antiochus of Athens, writing in the first or second century, reinforced the point, stating that \"when the Moon is conjoining Kronos [Saturn], opposition is encountered for every-thing\" (Antiochus of Athens, The Thesaurus, trans. Robert Schmidt, II. 1, p. 40). Worse, discussing astrological indications of the length of life, Ptolemy wrote, \"the places of the maleficent planets, Saturn and Mars, destroy [...]\" (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, III. 10, p. 283). To have Saturn in Scorpio, as it was 13 See also, for example, Firmicus, Mathesis, Ill.ii. 9. 17, pp. 76f.

To have the moon in the same place compounded the problem; the moon in Scorpio was in its \"depression\" (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, 1.19, p. 89). The question of house system is an additional complication. For this paper I cast the horo-scope using whole sign houses, placing the sun, Venus and Jupiter in the first house. Were the horoscopos to be the cusp of the first house, that would have placed all three planets in the inauspicious house of the Cacos Daemon or Malus Daemon (Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, III. 10, p. 275; Firmicus, Mathesis, II.xix.13, p. 51). That said, the Scorpionic moon-Saturn conjunction was it-self sufficient to lead Leontius to disaster. Such a malefic configuration could easily have been avoided by delaying the coronation for a matter of days. After ten days the moon would have moved into Pisces, once again making trines to the Cancerian planets, but this time to Saturn as well. As Antiochus of Athens wrote, the moon trine Saturn is fine for building, planting trees, and intercourse and, when it is trine Jupiter, it is \"fine for everything\" (An-tiochus, Thesaurus, II. 1, pp. 40f.). From the point of view of horoscopic astrology, the moments suppos-edly elected for the proclamations of Basiliscus and Leontius contain serious weaknesses. The former places the sun in the twelfth locus (house) in square to Mars and Jupiter and in opposition to Saturn, while the latter puts a debili-tated moon in Scorpio in conjunction with malefic Saturn. Given that the judgment as to whether a horoscope is auspicious must always be made on the balance of probabilities, weighing up benevolent and malevolent factors, it is frankly unlikely that these horoscopes were elected with the aid of the rules of horoscopic astrology. It is clear that, whatever the provenance of both horoscopes, if they were chosen by astrologers using the text-based rules of Hellenistic astrology, the intent can only have been to destroy the rebel cause. There are a number of solutions to this dilemma. One is that the texts originated in the astrologers' commentary on, rather than election of, the re-spective horoscopes. That is, the horoscopes were not cast at the time of the rebellions, but were calculated retrospectively and were later assumed to have been elected. However, if the claim that the times of coronation were indeed elected is accepted as sound, then a different possibility emerges: that the actual disposition of the heavens was more important than the rules of horo-scopic astrology.

Phenomenology Neugebauer and van Hoesen and Pingree based their discussion of the Basi-liscus and Leontius rebellion horoscopes on documentary sources. In both cases the veracity of the texts as originating in horoscopic work undertaken by astrologers working for the respective rebel emperors was accepted on the basis of the manuscript evidence. However, examination of these texts in relation to the extended literary context, the instructional texts of Greek as-trology, suggest that no fifth century astrologer working from the rules of Hellenistic horoscopic astrology would have elected such moments. An alternative hypothesis is that, if astrologers were indeed employed by the rebel emperors, they were working from direct observations of the sky. Such an argument finds support in an application of phenomenology, namely that it is possible, within a modern perspective, to understand the actual ex-perience of fifth century astrologers when faced with the awesome sight of a dramatic pre-dawn sky, especially one containing a prominent Venus.14 As Husserl, who first set out the principles of phenomenology in the early twen-tieth century, argued, it is essential to understand the \"I,\" the individual's subjective, inner, often transcendent, experience (1972 [1913], 7), the aim being, according to Twiss and Conser, the \"qualitative understanding of the forms of life of a religious tradition from that tradition's standpoint\" (1992, 27). This model is finding its way into archaeological thought, and from there into contemporary archaeoastronomy. For example, Tim Robinson claimed, in his account of a Bronze Age site in the west of Ireland, that he was able to understand its purpose and function better by experiencing a particularly bril-liant setting sun in the same landscape (1996, 201). This approach has re-cently been championed by Clive Ruggles in relation to the study of archaeoastronomy, citing Ed Krupp, Director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, on the experience of the solstice at Stonehenge. Krupp wrote: One should make a point of being there. Celestial events take place in context. When you see what actually happens in the landscape, you learn a great deal more about it. It is, of course, possible to determine the alignment of a building with instruments, but nuances of light and shadow, details of the horizon, difficulties in practical observation, and many more subjec-tive aspects of a site can only be appreciated in person.15 Ruggles himself added, \"Similarly, by walking in the modern landscape we can try to appreciate patterns of relationship between monuments and the topographic elements of the landscape as experienced by people living in that landscape in prehistoric times\" (Ruggles 1999, 151). He concedes that we 14 For a useful discussion of phenomenology as applied to questions of landscape and sacred space, see Tilley 1994. 15 Ed Krupp, HASTRO History of Astronomy e-mail list 8 August 1995, cited in Rug-gles 1999, 151.

It is that serious consideration which the horoscopes for Basiliscus's and Leontius's rebellions require. Writing on the phenomenology of sociology, Alfred Schutz argued that phenomenology is the source of all philosophical thinking: \"phenome-nology, searching for a real beginning of all philosophical thinking, hopes when fully developed, to end where all the traditional philosophies start\" (1979, 54). Helmut Wagner added that phenomenology's \"starting point is given in the experiences of the conscious human being who lives and acts in a 'world' which he apperceives and interprets, and which makes sense to him\" (1979, 5). Following Schutz and Wagner, then, it may be argued that the testimony of the night sky and an especially bright rising Venus might reveal more about the intentions of fifth century astrologers than the abstract interpretive structures of Hellenistic astrology. As Ninian Smart argued, the goal should be to achieve a \"value-rich\" appreciation of the world view of the fifth century astrologer (1973, 21). The astrologer working for Basiliscus or Leontius would have lived in a culture in which the planets might still be regarded as divine and their heliacal risings as heralds of the sun, Sol Invic-tus, Proclus's \"golden Titan,\" and might still send messages which were far more immediate and powerful than the complex readings contained in the astrological texts. It may, therefore, have been the astrologers' lived experi-ence in their fifth-century world, and their numinous awe when faced with a brilliant pre-dawn sky, rather than their use of the rules of Hellenistic horo-scopic astrology, which informed their work. Whatever the astrological texts claimed, the astrologers' primary perception, their 'real beginning,' or 'start-ing point,' was their experience of night giving way to dawn. 7. The Pre-Dawn Sky The time for Basiliscus's coronation is given for early morning; that for Le-ontius, for sunrise. It is evident from the horoscopes that the pre-dawn sky in both instances would have featured a prominent Venus. The pre-dawn sky for Leontius's rebellion would have been the most striking, with Mercury, Jupi-ter, and Venus all rising. If the time of Leontius's coronation is moved from sunrise to before dawn, then all three planets would have been rising and visi-ble.

From the Assyrian period, probably the seventh century BCE, one tablet survives in which the astrologer wrote to his emperor: Since the planet V[enus] is shining he[re], [the time is oppo]rtune for my reverence.\" The king, my lord, [kno]ws that the [Venu]s rituals of the \"overseer's wife\" are performed [...] the said [...]; now then Venus has risen [at] the (very time of its (computed) [appearance], [Tod]ay is favourable [to] do [...].

Neither do the eclipse re-ports to the Assyrian kings mention planets (see Hunger 1992). It is clear, though, from both the omen texts and the eclipse reports, that an eclipse is an overwhelmingly bad indication for the king. One indirect route by which Babylonian eclipse astrology was trans-mitted to the late classical world was via a set of texts derived from the Enu-ma Anu Enlil, introduced, adapted to local conditions in Egypt in the Persian period, around the sixth or fifth centuries BCE (Parker 1981, 723), and sub-sequently paraphrased in Hephaistio's Apotelesmatica. The texts may then have been further edited in the second and third centuries CE. Hephaistio has just this one comment on lunar eclipses in Cancer: \"the ruler of Syria will clash with another ruler and a certain great man will be destroyed, and the leader will be given up by the multitude\" (Hephaistio, Apotelesmatica, 1.21, p. 46). It is possible that, if this text was current, Basiliscus's astrologers would have identified Zeno as the ruler of Syria and seen the eclipse as a be-nevolent indication to their candidate for the throne. 7.2. Leontius's Rebellion At Basiliscus's coronation, Venus was a bright morning star, which may have been taken as a good omen. However, at Leontius's proclamation, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter were all morning stars and Regulus was an evening star. In addition, Sirius was rising (its heliacal rising would have taken place a few days earlier) and Orion was prominent. The interpretive possibilities are therefore more complex. The relevant texts would be concerned with Regulus setting, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter rising in Cancer or Gemini, and the rela-tionship between them. If, for example, the reports of the astrologers to the Assyrian kings are consulted, then there are some deeply relevant texts. For example: If Jupiter reaches and passes Regulus, and gets ahead of it, (and if) afterwards Regulus, which Jupiter has passed and got ahead of, reaches and passes Jupiter, moving to its setting; there will be rivalry; someone will rise and seize the throne, variant: the land will have wor-ries. (Hunger 1992, 279) Jupiter had not performed the required maneuver, but it was close to Regulus, although it was a morning star while the latter was an evening star. But the report to the king may have been an adaptation of a more general omen con-cerning Jupiter and Regulus. Mars, though, offers less ambiguous information. In the seventh cen-tury BCE the Babylonian astrologer Akkallanu wrote to the Assyrian em-Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Possible Survival of Babylonian Astrology in the Fifth Century 87 peror, \"Maybe someone will w[rite] the king my lord as follows: 'If a strange star (i.e. Mars) comes close to Cancer: the ruler will [die]'\" (Hunger 1992, 101.6-8, p. 60). And again, \"If a strange star [comes close] to Can[cer]; the ruler will die\" (Hunger 1992, 452.6, p. 255). Further, \"Mars reached Cancer; [the king sh]ould know and be circumspect until it goes out\" (Hunger 1992, 380.4, p. 218). And \"[w]hen Mars, furthermore, retrogrades from the Head of Leo and touches Cancer and Gemini, its interpretation is this: End of the reign of the king of the Westland\" (Parpola 1993, 9). Mars, in this case, was not retrograde, but it had just moved from Gemini to Cancer. Regarding Venus and Jupiter, a letter from an unknown astrologer reported, \"[If Venus] comes close to [Jupite]r: the king of the Westland [will see destruction. [...] comes near: land will become hostile to king, brother to brother [ ].\" 17 And: \"If Jupiter passes to the right of Ve-nus: a strong one will conquer the land of the Guti (i.e., the north)\" (Hunger 1992, 448.1, p. 251). Another, which may, perhaps, have encouraged pagan rebels, predicts, \"If Jupiter goes with Venus: there will be praying of the land to the gods\" (Hunger 1992, 244.r.2, p. 136). There are a number of problems with the Babylonian hypothesis, not least the lack of evidence for the direct transposition into Hellenistic astrol-ogy of any texts apart from the eclipse omens. There are, however, some tex-tual comparisons between cuneiform and Greek texts; for example, Firmicus Maternus stated that \"all kinds of danger\" occur when Mars is in aspect to Cancer {Mathesis, VIII.ix.2). In relation to Jupiter and Venus, he wrote that individuals born when they are in conjunction \"are devout in religious rites\" {Mathesis, VI.xxiii.4). Yet these examples do not necessarily imply direct transmission. However, the phenomenological argument—the impact of the numinous power of the night sky or the rising sun—provides weight for the continuation of an observational astrology. Supporting evidence is provided by the insistence in Jewish practice on the observation of the rising crescent moon (a religious necessity inherited and maintained by Islam). 8. The Survival of Babylonian Astrology There is a widely held view that Greek astrology was fundamentally different from Babylonian in both its conceptual foundations and technical applica-tions, an opinion which pervades the literature on the history of astrology.18 However, Francesca Rochberg has demonstrated aspects of technical continu-ity between Babylonian and Greek astrology (Rochberg-Halton 1988b), 17 Hunger 1992, 212.4, p. 119.

This text had been available in Arabic after the 660s, and was formerly known in Greek in the late Roman period, if not earlier. Pingree records that the passages included in Alexius's text include the \"interpreta-tion of solar and lunar eclipses, halos around the two luminaries, new moons, comets, falling stars, rainbows, flashes of light, the reddening of the sky, thunder, lightning, rain, hail and earthquakes\" (Pingree 1998, 134). There was, of course, an overlap between the technical procedures of Babylonian and Greek astrology. The codification of astrology, including the development of birth charts and a zodiac of twelve thirty degree signs, which culminated in the complex rules evident in the extant Greek texts of the first century onwards, predated the Hellenization of the Near East and appears to have begun under Persian rule in the fifth century BCE.19 The only safe dis-tinction to be made between Babylonian and Hellenistic astrology is that the Babylonian art relied heavily on direct observation, while the Hellenistic craft could be practiced on the basis of tables. Until such time as the astrol-ogy that the Babylonian priest Berossus taught to the Greeks on Kos around 280 BCE (Vitruvius, De Architectura, 9.6.2) can be reconstructed, we can have no absolute idea of the extent of the distinctive Greek contribution to astrology. Indeed, the evidence suggests that the observational Babylonian tradition was flourishing in the first century BCE, two hundred years after Berossus set up his school; Cicero reported that the Chaldaeans, by whom he specifically meant the astrologers of the Babylonian tradition and race, were active in Syria and well-known for their knowledge of the stars and impres-sive intellectual qualities (Cicero, De Divinatione, I.i.2; I.xli.90 - xlii.93). The magi, the Persian priesthood, were also active throughout the Middle East and met regularly in sacred places, including hill tops, to conduct divinatory exercises, which I assume, on the basis of their inclusion in the Christian na-tivity story, would have included astrological consultations.

It is known from evidence in the Dead Sea Scrolls that these practices surfaced in Jewish culture in the first century CE. Two pas-sages from a surviving astrological text are typical:20 \"if it thunders in the sign of Taurus, revolutions (in) the wor[ld]...\"; \"if you saw the moon upright towards the south and its other horn inclined towards the north, let it be a sign for you: be careful of evil; trouble will go out from the south.\" There are no extant texts discussing observations of Venus in the Hel-lenistic period, and to draw comparisons between cuneiform and Greek litera-ture is problematic. Is it really possible to link the Venus tablet's claim, from around 1700 BCE, that Venus's reappearance in the east signifies messages of reconciliation from king to king, with pseudo-Valens' statement that \"when the star of Aphrodite [Venus] has come on to the Horoscopos, it pro-duces gaiety with good cheer\"?21 It is, though, reasonable to argue, on the basis of the survival of an observational Babylonian astrology together with a continuation of Venus worship, that Venus's physical appearance in the pre-dawn or early evening sky was still of astrological significance in the Roman Near East. Whereas Pingree looked for the direct incorporation of Babylonian omen texts into Greek works, there was also a more subtle incorporation of the principles of Babylonian astrology. Hephaistio, for example, described a technique which was clearly an adaptation of Babylonian principles, and which he defined as \"spear-bearing\" (Hephaistio, Apotelesmatica, 1.17, p. 35); essentially, spear-bearers were rising planets. At Leontius's coronation benefic Jupiter (and perhaps Venus and Mars) was spear-bearer to the sun, rising immediately before it. Hellenistic astrology therefore maintained, in at least some respects, the principle of direct observation. Equally significant is that the Babylonians' theoretical model of as-trology survived. As Gadd put it, the Babylonians regarded the stars as \"the writing of heaven,\" a question of interpreting signs of divine intent, favor, or displeasure to which humanity might then respond (Gadd 1980, 57). It is of-ten argued that Greek astrology replaced omens and signs with a mechanistic Aristotelian model of causes and influences, and that Greek and Babylonian astrology were therefore necessarily fundamentally different practices (see for example, Rochberg-Halton 1988b). However, the notion of astrology-as-signs was not replaced by the theory of astrology-as-influence, but existed in parallel with it. Plotinus, who shaped late Roman Platonism, made the most 20 4Q318: A Divination Text (Brontologion), in Wise et al. 1996, 303-305.

Conclusion The horoscopes for the proclamations of the rebel pagan emperors Basiliscus and Leontius are of historical interest, being set in the period when the Ro-man Empire in the West disintegrated and that in the East was adopting its Byzantine Greek identity. It is, however, highly implausible that the astrolo-gers were using the rules of Greek horoscopic astrology suggested in the commentaries translated by Neugebauer and van Hoesen, and Pingree. Thus other explanations must be considered. I have argued in this paper that an approach adapted from phenomenological principles should include an ex-amination of the visual sky and an understanding of the numinous awe which a striking celestial display can inspire. It is therefore suggested that the key to understanding the astrological moments recorded in the texts lies not in the abstract interpretive procedures typical of Greek astrological texts, but in a surviving tradition of the observational astrology characteristic of Babylonian practice, linked to astral religion and flourishing within a philosophical con-text provided by Neoplatonism. As Pingree has shown, there is textual evi-dence for the survival of Babylonian eclipse and lunar omens into the Roman and Byzantine periods, though there is almost no evidence for the survival into the fifth century of a textual tradition of Babylonian planetary astrology, aside from general notions such as the importance of rising planets. The pos-sibility of continuity between the interpretive frameworks of Babylonian and Greek horoscopic astrology has been discussed. However, it is suggested that the reconstruction of the pre-dawn sky provides more effective evidence for the fifth century astrologers' intentions than do the documentary sources. If such an observational astrology survived, it adds a further dimension to the understanding of the political uses of sky-based pagan religion in the context of the religious complexity of Late Antiquity.23 22 Plotinus, Ennead II.3, \"On Whether the Stars are Causes,\" trans.

This passage is completed in 51 mean conjunctions spread approximately twenty years apart. Mäshä'alläh's history, the Kitäb fi al-qiränät wa al-adyän wa al-milil (\"Book on Conjunctions, Faiths, and Re-ligions\"), is preserved for us only in the Kitäb al mughnl (\"Book of Satisfac-tion\") composed by a Christian named Ibn Hibintä at Baghdäd after 929. Mäshä'alläh had written his Kitäb fi al-qiränät in 810, but Ibn Hibintä be-cause of hindsight believes that its predictions were distorted by its author so that he attempts to correct them. One such intervention is Ibn Hibintä's prom-ise, at the beginning of his discussion of Mäshä'alläh's work, to include \"what Hermes and others mentioned concerning judgments based on con-junctions and world-year transfers and as to what the ancients had to say con-cerning judgments on nativity years and so on as to what follows it of the duration (of the reigns) of kings and governors, and the times of wars\" (Ken-nedy and Pingree 1971, 39). Since no one in antiquity wrote about the his-torical interpretation of Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions, Ibn Hibintä must be referring to the mythical role of the three Hermes in the history of science proposed by Abü Ma'shar (Pingree 1968, 13-19), and perhaps to the Kitäb asrär kaläm hurmus al-muthallath bi al-hikma (\"Book of the Secrets of the Words of Hermes who is Tripled in Wisdom\"), which presents a variant ver-sion of the horoscope of Gayömart (Pingree 1997, 43). However, whereas Abü Ma'shar followed an Indian chronological tradition in making the mean conjunctions that occur in 0° of Aries, the tropi-cal sign in the triplicity of fire, mark the beginning and the end of a yuga, Mäshä'alläh connected the birth and death of the universe with conjunctions in Cancer and Capricorn, under the influence of an ancient Greek tradition associated by Seneca with Berosus the Babylonian (Quaestiones Naturales III 29,1). Seneca claims that Berosus states that a conjunction of all the plan-ets in Cancer indicates that the earth will be burned, one in Capricorn that it Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"96 David Pingree will be flooded. The Zoroastrian astrologers followed by Mäshä'alläh shifted the flood to Cancer so that it fit into their conception of world history and so as to make it conform to the astrological doctrine that defined that zodiacal sign as watery. This is cleverly combined with the Zoroastrian theory of the universe that lasts for twelve millennia corresponding to the twelve zodiacal signs. The first three millennia, according to such sources as the Bundahishn (Anklesaria 1956, 305-307) saw the creation by the Good Spirit, Ohrmazd, of the material world, which, however, remained motionless. Motion began—in particular, the motions of the planets, which had all been in their exaltations (Anklesaria 1956, 59), awaiting their leader, the evil spirit, Ahriman, who was aroused—at the beginning of the fourth millennium (Anklesaria 1956, 47). The Iranian Bundahishn, from which I have been quoting, speaks of a cow that Ohrmazd created along with Gayömart (Anklesaria 1956, 25); the Saddar Bundahishn calls this creature a bull (Mole 1963, 519); both texts state that this creature was slain by Ahriman at the beginning of his assault. The celestial symbol of the bull is the zodiacal sign Taurus, which belongs to the astrological triplicity of earth. It is presumably for this reason that Mäshä'alläh claims that the first Saturn-Jupiter conjunction occurred at the beginning of motion at Taurus 7;42° when 509 years, 2 months, and 24 days had passed of the millennium of Mars (Kennedy and Pingree 1971, 40). This millennium was considered to belong (appropriately enough) to Mars be-cause the tropical sign within the triplicity of earth is Capricorn, in which is located the exaltation of Mars, where that planet was at the time of the as-sault. Using the parameters of the Zij ϊ Arkand (Haddad, Kennedy, and Pin-gree 1981, 209-211), which were adopted by Xusraw Anösherwän's astronomers in the Zij 1 Shahryärän which in turn was used by Mäshä'alläh (Kennedy and Pingree 1971, 75-85 and 127), the mean increase in the longi-tudes of successive Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions is about 242;25,35°, and the mean increase in time about 19 years, 10 months, and 10+ days. The first potential conjunction, then, in the triplicity of earth would have occurred in Capricorn 2;25,35°, the second in Virgo 5;10°, and the third (the actual first, in the symbolic Taurus) in Taurus 7; 16,45°, for which the manuscript of Mäshä'alläh has Taurus 7;42°. Mäshä'alläh states that this mean conjunction which occurred 9 years, 2 months, and 24 days after the middle of the millennium of Mars preceded the shift in triplicities that indicated the Flood by 2412 years, 6 months, and 26 days (Kennedy and Pingree 1971, 40). This shift from the airy to the wa-tery triplicity is firmly dated -3380 (Kennedy and Pingree 1971, 77-88 and 187-193), so that Mäshä'alläh took the fourth millennium, that of Mars, to have begun in -6291, and the first millennium in -9291.

In Zoroastrianism the fixed stars—and especially Tishtrya or Sirius (Panaino 1986)—released the immobile waters in heaven at the beginning of motion, thus according a special relationship of floods to the region of Can-cer; for the astrologers who were followed by Mäshä'alläh, it was the con-junction of -3360 in Cancer that precipitated the Flood. According to the Persian king-lists available to al-Blrünl in 1000 when he composed his Al-athär al-bäqiya 'an al-qurün al-khällya (\"Chro-nology of Ancient Nations\"), the Persian kings reigned for 3352 or 3354 years (Sachau 1923, 103-109), from the \"birth\" of Gayömart to the death of the last Achaemenid; these numbers, of course, are rounded to integers, so that the number of solar years must be close to 3360. The Flood is said to have occurred in the reign of Tahmurath, which began, according to the same sources, 253 or 250 years after the \"birth\" of Gayömart. This implies that the Macedonian and early Seleucid kings were not counted; the approximately 3600 years extend from the time of the Flood to the beginning of the rule of the Arsacids. Note, however, that the Bundahishn's horoscope of Gayömart essentially locates all the planets in their exaltations (Raffaelli 2001), which were in those zodiacal signs before the beginning of motion in the fourth mil-lennium. How this astrological re-interpretation of the Zoroastrian theory of twelve millennia gives significance to the later, more real events of Sasanian and early Islamic history is not clear from what Ibn Hibintä reports. But we do have some relevant information, provided by Mäshä'alläh himself as quoted by al-HäshimT in his Kitäb β 'ilal al-zljät (\"Book on the Reasons be-hind Zljes\"), composed in about 890, and by al-BIrünl in his Al-qänün al-Mas'üdi (\"Masudic Canon\") of the early 1030's. Al-Häshäml reports (Haddad, Kennedy, and Pingree 1981, 95): It is stated of Mäshä'alläh that he said: —Khusrö Anösherwän, when he beheld the differ-ence between the Arkand and what Ptolemy asserted, gathered together the people learned in computation and in (astrological) judgments, and looked over these two books. He found the Arkand to be the more accurate by observation and eye-sight, and the judgments based on its planets more accurate. So he worked out a Zij. The actual date of the composition of this Zij is indicated by al-BIrünl (Al-qänün al-Mas'üdl, vol. 3, 1956, 1973f.): It is their (the Persians') opinion that the seven planets and the two nodes rule in turn the years in numbers which are assumed for them and which are called fardärät. Their agree-ment as to these is that there had passed of the fardäriya of Jupiter 4 years when 25 years had passed of the reign of Anösherwän (556 CE) ... there had passed of the thousands 3,851 years.

The time since -3295 was di-vided into fardärs, each of which contains 75 years of which specified num-bers are ruled by the planets and the lunar nodes in the order of their exaltations (Pingree 1968, 62)—sun 10 years, moon 9, Ascending Node 3, Jupiter 12, Mercury 13, Saturn 11, Descending Node 2, Mars 7, and Venus 8. In 530 CE, the year before Anösherwän's coronation, 3825 years or 51 fard-ärs had passed; the first 26 years of Anösherwän's reign contained the fard-äriyas of the sun, the moon, and the Ascending Node, and the first 4 years of Jupiter's fardänya, as al-Blrünl correctly notes. From this one can conclude that our account of Mäshä'alläh's chronology is essentially correct, that it may have been known to the astrologers/astronomers at Anösherwän's court, and that in it the tenth millennium, the first of the final three in which Ohr-mazd defeats Ahriman, began in -295 or -291 and included the reign of Anösherwän. Unexpectedly, we have an independent witness to the chronology followed by Anösherwän's astrologers. It is the horoscope they cast for the king's coronation at c. 7 A.M. of 18 August 531 in the garden of Räm-Qobad in the district of Räm-Ardashlr (Pingree and Madelung 1977, 249f.). The horoscope, preserved in the Jämi' al-kitäb (\"Compilation\") composed by al-QasränT after 882, by its details shows every sign of being a genuine product of Anösherwän's time, whether it was cast before the coronation in order to select an auspicious time for the ceremony or after it as a record. It claims to have been cast by the astrologers of Färs and Hind, whom we know to have collaborated at the Sasanian court at this time. It mentions that the date fell in the millennium of the sun. This can be explained not from Mäshä'alläh's method of determining the planetary lord of the millennium which is dis-cussed above, but from a method found in the Zand ϊ Wahman Yasn; in this system, as the millennia progressed through the zodiacal sign containing the planets' exaltations, each planet thus designated became the lord of that mil-lennium—Aries indicates the sun, Taurus the moon, Gemini the Ascending Node, Cancer Jupiter, and Libra Saturn. Saturn therefore is the lord of the seventh millennium, which began in -3295/3291 (Pingree in Panaino 1996, 241f.). Saturn's lordship of the millennium of Saturn, in which the assault of Ahriman occurred, is confirmed by the Bundahishn (Anklesaria 1956, 69). A related Persian tradition, preserved in a Byzantine Greek translation, indicates that the millennia after the seventh are ruled by the next five planets in de-scending order from Saturn (Pingree 2004, 544). Therefore, the tenth millen-nium was ruled by the sun. The horoscope also says that the century in which Anösherwän's coronation fell was ruled by the sun. If we follow the rules of the Byzantine text, 531 fell toward the end of the eighth century, near the beginning of the ninth, which commenced in 535 CE and was ruled by the sun, if we accept Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Masha'alläh's Zoroastrian Historical Astrology 99 that the first century was also ruled by the sun and therefore the eighth as well.1 The symbolism of the coronation ceremony should now be clear: The King of Kings is associated with the tenth millennium and with the sun; the sun and the moon are in the royal signs, Leo and Aries, both of which belong to the triplicity of fire; Jupiter, the Ascending Node, and the Descending Node are in the signs of their exaltations; the sun and Venus are in their domiciles; and Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are close to a conjunction in Cancer, wherein occurred the mean conjunction of the Flood. The relative reason-ableness of the basic pattern of Mäshä'alläh's solution is also apparent. It avoided the fantastically long periods of the Indian tradition of yugas—a Kalpa of 4,320,000,000 yeas or a Mahäyuga of 4,320,000—for which the Iranian tradition provided no historical narrative. It satisfied both the reli-gious and the historical traditions of Iran. When Abü Ma'shar imitated the Indians by shifting the date of the Flood to that of their beginning of the pre-sent Kaliyuga in -3101, he attempted to ameliorate the problem of the length of time by fixing the Flood at the midpoint of a period of 360,000 years, a twelfth of a Mahäyuga. But he did not (or could not) fill in the antediluvian millennia with prophets and dynasties as his theory required. References Al-BTrünl. Al-qänün al-Mas 'üdl, 3 vols.

Its fasci-nation is partly due to the sovereigns' efforts to integrate the different ethnic and religious groups of the subcontinent in their system of rule. These efforts resulted in the propagation of a new faith, the din-e elähl, a syncretistic relig-ion initiated and developed by Akbar.1 The flourishing of the Mughal Empire was accompanied by a flour-ishing of astrology. It is true that astrology had played an important part in the Muslim world since the middle of the eighth century CE, but no other dynasty apparently made such extensive use of astrological advice and pre-dictions as the Mughal rulers. Historiographie works of that epoch abound with remarks on the omnipresence of astrologers and their activities at court. The function of astrology in Mughal ideology and historiography has not yet been investigated. In the following article, I will approach this phe-nomenon by an analysis of the four nativities of the Mughal emperor Akbar given in the Akbarnäme of Abü 1-Fazl-e 'Alläml. In spite of dealing with only a limited part of astrology in Mughal times, this analysis nevertheless catches a glimpse of its use for propagandist^ and ideological aims and opens up further research on this subject. Situated almost at the beginning of the Akbarnäme, the accounts of the Mughal emperor Akbar's birth and especially of his nativities hold a very prominent place in Abü 1-Fazl-e 'Alläml's famous biography. In chapters three to eight of this book, altogether four different nativities of Akbar are depicted and analyzed, covering twenty pages of the printed Persian edition and sixty pages of Beveridge's English translation.2 Only after this extensive account does Abü 1-Fazl turn to the history of Adam and of Akbar's prede-l 2 For a short introduction to the din-e elähi, see Grobbel 2001, 1-9; Rizvi 1975, 374-417; Srivastava 1962, 296-330.

The main objective of this study is to demonstrate how Abü 1-Fazl achieved this aim. First, I will show how the four horoscopes were constructed and their respective differences, then I will address their ideological content and their association with the dln-e elähJ. Finally, I will inquire about the importance of astrology in Abü 1-Fazl's book and the causes of its prominence. 1. The Nativities of Akbar and Their Setting Let me begin with some remarks on nativities in general. Assuming that the astral configuration at the moment of birth has an enduring influence on a person's fate, the drawing up of nativities has always been one of the astrolo-ger's most important tasks.4 To determine the time of birth as precisely as possible, astrologers had to be present at the moment of birth. In miniature paintings of Mughal times we therefore see astrologers in close proximity to the birth-chamber.5 The astrologers then calculated the position of the ascen-dant and the planets, and drew the figure of the nativity. But this natal figure was not the astrologer's only requirement. To get the astronomical data for future moments in the new-bora's life, they usually undertook extensive cal-culations. As a result, they produced large books with computation tables, called zäyche. At the core of such books, we find the figure of the nativity, sometimes splendidly decorated. Astrological prognostications appear only in the second and shorter part, while most of the space is occupied by the astro-nomical calculations and tables.6 With such extensive zäyches in mind, the nativities provided by Abü 1-Fazl are rather disappointing. They do not contain any calculation tables, giving us only the figure of the constellation at the moment of birth and its astrological interpretation. Instead, Abü 1-Fazl depicts four different horo-scope figures, and embeds them in a comprehensive account of the circum-3 Akbarnäme 1,48-52; tr.

We should con-sider the beginning of this account which deals with the delivery, because it stresses the significance of the moment of the emperor's birth: Among the strange circumstances which occurred near the time of the appearance of the light of fortune, there was this,—that before the auspicious moment above-mentioned, the mother felt a pressing urgency to bring forth the child. Moulänä Chänd,7 the astrologer, who by the king's order had been stationed by the chaste threshold in order that he might cast the horo-scope, was perturbed, as the moment was inauspicious. \"In a short time, a glorious moment will arrive, such as does not happen once in a thousand years. What an advantage if the birth could be delayed!\" Those who were present made light of it and said, \"What is the good of your agitation? Such things are not under control.\" At this very instant the impulse to bring forth passed off and the astrologer's mind was set at rest somewhat by the transit of the unlucky moment. [...] But when the chosen time came, the Moulänä became disturbed, lest it should accidentally pass by. The confidants of the harem said to him: \"Her Majesty, has after much suffering, got an interval of relief and is now slumbering. It would not be right to waken her. Whatever Almighty God, in His good pleasure, has determined, must happen.\" Just as they were speaking, the pains of travail came upon her Majesty, Miryam Makänl, and awoke her in that auspicious moment, the unique pearl of the vice-regency of God (khiläfat) came forth in his glory.8 Ascribing the moment of Akbar's birth to divine intervention, this account makes it clear that the main interest in rendering Akbar's nativities is not to provide us with astral positions and astrological houses. They are rather used to create a link between the new-born child and supernatural forces which act with the help of the stars. Therefore, the nativities at the same time provide proof of and establish the emperor's privileged position in comparison with the rest of mankind. In spite of this alleged link, however, it poses no prob-lem for Abü 1-Fazl to transmit four different horoscope figures. As he himself explains, this ambiguity is a divine means of protection: Keen-sighted inquirers after truth and subtle perceivers of the secrets of the skies fell into the valley of perturbation on account of these discrepancies. [...] Rather it was the Divine wis-dom and the Divine jealousy which demanded that the description of this cavalier of the plain of majesty and confident of the sublime cabinet, should remain hidden from the gaze of keen-sighted, penetrating, minute inquirers, as well as from the eyes of the evil-disposed and the inwardly blind.9 7 Moulänä Chänd was an astrologer of Indian origin who accompanied Homäyün at least at the beginning of the emperor's flight to Iran (Akbarnäme I, 374). Later on, he prepared the TashTl-e zTj-e Ulugh Beg for Akbar: Khan Gori 1985, 33f.; King, Samso, and Goldstein 2001, 55. 8 Akbarnäme I, 18-19; tr. Beveridge 56f. 9 Akbarnäme I, 41-42; tr.

The Four Horoscope Figures With this background in mind, let us now look more closely at the four horo-scope figures. The first figure10 was prepared by Moulänä Chänd, the as-trologer who was present at Akbar's birth. It was calculated according to the \"altitudes taken by the Greek astrolabe\" at the time of birth and was based on Ulugh Beg's Gurgänl tables.11 In this horoscope, the ascendant—that is, the point of the ecliptic rising above the horizon at the moment of observation— is in Virgo. The second horoscope12 was pre-pared by the Jotik Rai according to the calculations of Indian astrologers.13 Here, the ascendant is in Leo instead of Virgo. The position of the planets in the astrologi-cal houses is also different: Venus is now in the second house instead of the first, and Mercury in the third instead of the second. The moon has been placed in the sixth house. The third horoscope14 was drawn by 'Azod od-Doula Amir Fatholläh Shl-räzl15 according to Persian rules and the Greek canon. The ascendant was not observed, but estimated. It is in Leo; Mercury is in the second house again, and the moon back in the fifth. The fourth figure16 has a Virgo ascendant. I cannot detect any differ-ence with the first figure apart from the fact that Mercury and Jupiter have 10 Akbarnäme I, 23-26; tr. Beveridge 69-84. 11 The Gurgänl tables were prepared by a group of astrologers for the TTmürid ruler Ulugh Beg in Samarqand around 1440: Kennedy 1956, 125f.; King & Samso 2001, 53f. What is meant here by \"the Greek astrolabe\" is not obvious. It was well-known that the Muslims had inherited the astrolabe from their Greek predecessors (King 1987), but no type of astrolabe was usually given this name. Note that in these horo-scope figures the ascendant is shown at the top and not, as elsewhere, on the left side of the diagram. 12 Akbarnäme I, 27-31; tr. Beveridge 85-95. 13 Jotik Rai is probably a term for a certain position rather than a personal name: Ak-barnäme I, tr. Beveridge 86, note 1. This is confirmed by the frequent mention of the Jotik Rai in the Jahängümäme, such as p. 337, 362. Abu 1-Fazl does not give us the name of the Indian tables. Beveridge discusses at length whether they were Vik-ramäditya's: Akbarnäme I, tr. Beveridge, 12If., note 2. 14 Akbarnäme I, 31-40; tr. Beveridge 94-116. 15 Amir Fatholläh ShTräzT originally came from Shlräz. He first went to the Deccan before he came to Akbar's court. He excelled in all natural sciences and had a talent for mechanics: Ä'Jn-e Akbaril, 28, tr. Blochmann 34, note 1.

As Abü 1-Fazl himself explains, such differences may be caused by the astronomical tables in use. The Indian astrologers used Indian tables which did not take into account the so-called precession, the very slow movement of the sphere of the fixed stars including the Zodiac.19 Taking a fixed star as starting point, calculations based on such ancient tables do indeed arrive at different results than calcula-tions based on new observations which take this motion into consideration. The second major difference between the four horoscopes concerns the position of the planets in the astrological houses. Astrological houses are subdivisions of the sky. These houses are not of equal length, and there exist different methods for calculating their boundaries, the so-called cusps.20 It is therefore not surprising that the planets are placed in different houses in the four horoscopes. 16 Akbarnäme I, 40; tr. Beveridge 117f. 17 We learn from the Akbarnäme that Homäyün met with Elyäs al-ArdabTlT in Kabul in the year 1544: Akbarnäme I, 221, tr.

The Astronomical Data of the Nativities Dealing with astrological material, it is always interesting to verify the given astronomical data.21 In Akbar's case, the only horoscope to give detailed in-formation on the position of the houses and the planets is the third one. Here, the house cusps and planetary positions are given precisely in degrees and minutes. We can verify these data by calculating at which day and time the planets reached these positions at Akbar's birthplace,22 namely, October 15th at 1:45 am. Starting with the given ascendant at 28°36' Leo, we then deter-mine the cusps and compare the indicated positions of the planets in the twelve astrological houses with our horoscope figure. As we learn from the enclosed table, we get approximately the same results.

The Prognostications and Their Ideological Content After this survey of the horoscope figures, let us now examine the prognosti-cations. The different horoscope figures have their own explanations and judgments. While the fourth figure does not contain any prognostication, the second figure is explained in two different ways: the first is anonymous, and the second is according to the \"Sages of India.\" All of the predictions are quite extensive. Their discussion here is therefore limited to the most interest-ing points. According to the first horoscope, the masters of understanding and reason will gather around the newborn child. The philosophers of the age from every sect will leave their countries to come to his court. His thoughts and ideas are in total accordance with reason. He bestows justice and equality on everybody.24 24 Akbarnäme I, 24-25; tr. Beveridge 73f.

He will act according to his own mature reasoning, examining contradictory faiths and different dispositions, and guiding every sect in the way of good works. He is beautiful, accomplishing whatever he undertakes. He will also travel a lot.25 According to the prediction by the \"Sages of India\" (the second pre-diction of the second horoscope), the newborn child will be brave and stead-fast. He will have a large kingdom and a broad understanding of music. His memory is very good and he will be very rich and generous.26 The third horoscope has again only one interpretation. It predicts that the newborn child will be very rich. At the beginning of his rule, additional territories will be conquered by his soldiers and his father will die early. In his youth, the child will marry the daughters of ruling Indian families. He has some knowledge of mysteries, and happiness reaches him from the world beyond. Most of the time he will be concerned with ordering the state and religion. Endowed with outstanding reason, he will bestow favor on learned 27 and wise men. In comparing these prognostications, it is clear that the contents of the first and the anonymous second horoscope are very close to each other. Both predict central issues of Akbar's later policies, especially concerning his reli-gious ideas. Keywords mentioned in the prognosis are the gathering of repre-sentatives from different faiths at Akbar's court and the harmony of his deeds and thoughts with reason. These are both central ideas of Akbar's dln-e elähl (Grobbel 2001, 5f., 70f.). The prognostications of the \"Sages of India\" are quite general, the most interesting point being perhaps the native's broad understanding of mu-sic. The third horoscope again contains some interesting details, but they seem to be focused on events of the early days of Akbar's reign, like the premature death of his father and the emperor's marriages. Nevertheless, some issues of Akbar's new order are at least hinted at when the horoscope emphasizes the emperor's reason and points to his ordering the affairs of state and religion.28 With respect to these differences, I contend that the horoscope of the \"Sages of India\" had been cast before the outlines of Akbar's religious re-forms were perceptible. As Beveridge found out, these predictions resemble 25 Akbarnäme I, 28-29; tr. Beveridge 87-89. 26 Akbarnäme I, 29-30; tr. Beveridge 90-95. 27 Akbarnäme I, 36-39; tr.

But since the judgments do not refer to Akbar's political reforms, they were com-pleted later by an anonymous addition. The third horoscope was cast shortly after Fatholläh ShTräzI arrived at the Mughal court in 1583. At that time, Akbar had already carried out some important reforms.30 We may wonder why we do not find more allusions to the new policies in the judgments of this horoscope. Perhaps the newly ar-rived astrologer preferred to remain vague about developments of a not yet predictable extent, and therefore put the stress on earlier events. It is interest-ing to note that Fatholläh ShTräzI did not base his horoscope on the observed ascendant, but on an estimated one. There is good reason to suppose that he wanted to change the ascendant from Virgo to Leo, because Leo is much stronger than Virgo and is especially apt for a king. Despite the horoscope's good ascendant and its detailed astronomic data, however, Abü 1-Fazl post-poned it to third place in his book. I assume that this was done because the prognostications had lost their immediate relevance: containing no clear an-nouncement of Akbar's reform, they were somewhat outdated. The predictions of the first and the anonymous prognostication of the second differ greatly from ordinary horoscopes. Such predictions cannot be found in astrological manuals. Too precise to refer back to a time when the outlines of the din-e ilähl were not yet perceptible, they were probably in-vented after the fact by Abu 1-Fazl himself. The horoscope figures, however, may well be the original ones. I assume that the first horoscope figure has indeed been cast by Moulänä Chänd: first, because it fits well with the astro-nomical data of Akbar's birth, and, secondly, because the Virgo ascendant is not auspicious enough to have been faked. Therefore, Abü 1-Fazl probably reproduces actual horoscopes here, but replaces the original predictions and adds his own explications. As a result, we get a series of horoscopes quite different from what we find in most historiographic works and even at other places in the Akbarnäme:31 of course, astrology was used for propagandistic ends in many other sources, but I do not know of any other examples with obvious reformulations of existing horoscopes. The only other histo-riographic work known to me with such an extensive description of a birth 29 Akbarnäme I, tr. Beveridge 92, note 1; 93, note 1. 30 The poll tax for non-Muslims (jezya) was abolished in 1564 (Akbarnäme II, 203-204); the 'Ebädatkhäne was built in 1575 (Akbarnäme III, 112ff.) and the so called infallibility decree was signed in 1579 (Akbarnäme III, 269-270; text of the decree: Badä'üni II, 27If.). 31 See for example the horoscope of Akbar's accession to the throne (Akbarnäme II, 6), and those of the birth of prince Moräd (Akbarnäme II, 354-355) and prince Dän-yäl (.Akbarnäme II, 374-375).

Astrology and Propaganda In this final section, I would like to ask why the emperor's nativities in the Akbarnäme were so emphasized. As already stated, these nativities are not an isolated indication of Akbar's unique personality and fate in the Akbarnäme. On the contrary, many chapters are filled with accounts of the emperor's marvelous relationship with supernatural forces. In these accounts, however, astrology and astrological symbolism are not merely one narrative device among many others; rather, they permeate all the narrations and set their tone. Of course, it is also possible that such imagery reflects Abü 1-Fazl's personal inclinations. I contend, however, that such an explanation would be unsatisfactory. To suggest another interpretation, I would like to quote one further account: And those intimate friends of his Majesty [Homäyün] [...] have been heard to tell that when his Majesty had the auspicious horoscope shown to him and had considered it, it happened several times that when in his private chamber and with the doors all closed, he fell adancing, and from excess of exaltation, revolved with a circular motion. [...] And he many times said to those who were privileged to converse with him, that the horoscope of this Light of Fortune was superior, in several respects and by sundry degrees, to that of his Maj-esty, the Lord of Conjunction (TImür) as indeed clearly appears to the scrutinizing students of the prognostications.33 This last sentence provides us with an important key for understanding the function of the astrological metaphors in the Akbarnäme. The emperor's na-tivities are a way to compare Akbar with his famous predecessor and to prove his superiority. Given the fact that astrology was of outstanding importance in TTmürid ideology, astrology was indeed a very obvious medium to do so: TTmür himself was called the säheb-e qerän, the Lord of conjunctions.34 This title referred to a conjunction of Mars and Jupiter in the zodiacal sign Taurus in the year of TImür's birth.35 It was used to emphasize the privileged posi-32 Bädshähnäme I, 17-41. The Badshahname was written for Akbar's grandson Shäh Jahän by 'Abd ol-Hamld LähourT who died in 1654-1655. 33 Akbarnäme I, 42-43; tr.

The date of TImür's birth, April 8th 1336, clearly shows that in his case, it was a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars. The origin of the title sähib-e qirän and its first use are not clear.

Are they meant only to stress Homäyün's private pleasure? To fully grasp their meaning, we should pay attention to the vocabulary used in this quota-tion. It is the same as for the planets: they also revolve with a circular motion. In some way, Akbar's father is thus transformed into a celestial body. It is hard to decide if this episode and its imagery were simply in-vented by Abü 1-Fazl or if they had some foundation in Homäyün's behavior and intellectual orientation. This description, however, is only one piece of evidence among many for Homäyün's astrological leanings.39 Akbar's father was unquestionably very interested in astral phenomena and calculations. Astrology's important role in Akbar's time may therefore partly be explained by tendencies already present under his predecessors. But there is also the fact that Akbar later invented a kind of solar cult with strong astral symbol-ism. In the new belief system, Akbar himself was in some way equated with the sun to which he had a special relation.40 The literal transformation of his father into a planet is therefore not strikingly different from ideas current at the time of the Akbarnäme's origin. In my opinion, these ideas were largely responsible for the astrologi-cal tone of Abü 1-Fazl's text. Generally speaking, solar cults and a belief in astral deities often imply belief in astrology. Even if the sun and stars were not deified in the dln-e elähJ, I assume that there existed a similar correlation between Akbar's religious innovations and astrology's important role in his empire. Both the prognostications and the narrative frame in which they were embedded connect obviously to Akbar's politics. The nativities therefore provide clear evidence for this correlation. As represented in the Akbarnäme, a highly ideological text, they provide particular insight into its importance at the level of language and propaganda. We should not forget, however, that this cohered with strong personal inclinations for prognostication and astrol-It indicates, however, a propitious rule and has some messianic overtones.

The zäyche of Soltän Abi Toräb is a further good example. 38 It is noteworthy that later on Shäh Jahän was also called sähib-e qirän: Bädshäh-näme I, 9.

Introduction Oriental princes and dignitaries of the Middle Ages commonly had their horoscope calculated. The only one that has reached us together with a beau-tifully decorated miniature is the horoscope of the Timurid prince Mirza Is-kandar (1384-1415). This horoscope is preserved at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine in London under the shelf mark Ms. Fers. 414. This is thus the most famous illuminated horoscope, and that is why it has caught the attention of the most renowned scholars in the history of art (Ke-shavarz 1984; Kesharvarz 1986, 46f.; 63-66; 69f.; 396-399), in the history of science (Savage-Smith 1992), and in the history of astrology (Tourkin 2004). Unlike most birth charts, this horoscope was cast in Shiraz on the 22nd of Dhü-l-Hijja 813H./18 April 1411 by the astrologer Mahmüd Ibn Yahyä Ibn al-Hasän al-Kashl (whose shortened name was 'Imäd al-Munajjim), at the beginning of the reign of Prince Iskandar who was then aged 27, and not on the day of his birth, which was on the 3rd RabT' 786H./25 April 1384 (El-well-Sutton 1984, 120-124; Keshavarz 1984, 198). Prince Mirza Iskandar, called Iskandar Sultan by modern historians, was the third of the six sons of Umar Shaykh, and one of the favorite grand-sons of TTmür Leng. TTmür first considered choosing Iskandar as a successor, but he decided otherwise because of the prince's independent mind and his insubordination. Iskandar Sultan ruled over Fars from 1409 to 1414. His reign was brief and turbulent but, at this time, culture reached an incontest-able greatness (Gray 1979, 121-145; Sims 1981; Canby 1993, 51-54). Iskan-dar Sultan was indeed the leader of Timurid patronage (Aubin 1957), one of the most famous protectors of the art of the book of his time; he showed a particular interest in astrological and astronomical illuminated works, which he repeatedly ordered (Soucek 1992).

Each of them is decorated with stars, dots, and gilded Chinese-style clouds, and bears in its centre a circle with a zodiacal sign, followed by six lines of alternating red and black naskhi writ-ing that states the characteristics of each of the twelve houses.2 In several sectors, the personifications of the planets are drawn next to the local zodia-cal sign. Crowned angels carrying presents in their arms are represented in the corners around the main circle. Among other things, the text of the horoscope indicates that the indi-vidual who was born at the given time will have a long, prosperous, and suc-cessful life. Mars being both lord of the exaltation and in sextile in the eleventh house generally means victories and conquests (Elwell-Sutton 1984, 130). 2. The Horoscope of Iskandar, a Surviving Form of the Planispheric Vision of Heaven In the art of Middle-Eastern Islamic books, the horoscope of Iskandar Sultan stands out as an exception: it is both the only individual illuminated horo-scope left to us, and one of the rare circular miniatures showing simultane-ously the zodiac and the planets surrounded by angels. Some later miniatures similar to such a representation are known (Caiozzo 2004b), but only one of them—which dates back to the first half of the fifteenth century and can be identified as Timurid on the basis of its style and iconography—should be mentioned here: folio 164a of the Album Hazine 2153 of the T.S.M. (ill. 1). That folio (15.5 cm χ 23.3 cm) displays a double circular composition: The planets stand around the sun and are surrounded by the zodiacal signs, with 1 The Nativity Book is divided into three parts as explained by Tourkin 2004, 105. The first part gives the place and date of birth of Iskandar Sultan and some astro-nomical observations; the second part gives general astrological predictions on the twelve houses and the location of the five planets, the fixed stars, and the various lots at the time of birth; the third part gives the predictions between 1411 and 1424. 2 Mundane houses are never drawn in Islamic astrology. During its own revolution along the zodiac, each planet occupies one of the twelve houses (bayt/buyüt). At any given instant, it stands in one of the twelve houses that divide the sky in a given place. Since these houses are similar to the zodiacal signs, the planet has more or less affinity with the house it occupies at any given moment. Houses are sometimes drawn in western miniatures (Halbronn 1994, 10f.).

Thus, while the metalworkers of the geographical area stretching from Syria and Mesopotamia to Khuräsän were used to decorating trays, caul-drons, tops of round boxes, or mirrors with astrological themes displayed within circles from the twelfth century, the circular structures for astrological themes appeared in books within small illuminated miniatures over blue backgrounds and with golden dots representing stars only at the end of the fourteenth century, and especially in the fifteenth century.3 These circular representations, which are limited to the isolated repre-sentation of a sign or planet, seem to bespeak the aesthetic and symbolic im-pulse to place the zodiac and the planets back into their original context, namely heaven. More complex representations are rare: actually three of them are known, which may be surprising, since circular shapes evoking the heavens were quite frequent on any type of support and object in the ancient Middle East (Abry 1993). Indeed, as soon as zodiacal iconography was codi-fied during the Hellenistic period (Obrist 2004, 195-226), circular zodiacs spread in the Mediterranean area during the first and second centuries CE both in the western and eastern parts of the Roman Empire. They were used to decorate mosaic floors of houses (Parrish 1984, pi. LXIV), ceilings of Egyptian temples (zodiac of Dendera or Tabula Bianchini), bas-reliefs of mithraea, and also coins dating back to the reign of Antoninus.4 In these cir-cular representations, the zodiac, which represents the ecliptic belt of the sun's path in the sky, is divided into twelve equal sectors, each bearing a spe-cific sign. The twelve figures are generally associated with deities of the Greco-Roman pantheon, sometimes with the figures of the Egyptian decans; in most cases the twelve figures surround the busts of Sol and Luna, the two luminaries (Gury 1993, 118-119). These ancient representations were continued in the Middle Ages both in the East and the West thanks to copies of illuminated manuscripts dating back to the third and fourth centuries CE, such as the Aratea,5 ninth-century Byzantine manuscripts describing the mythography of the constellations (Panofsky and Saxl 1990, 21-36; Obrist 2004, 214-224). 3 On Turkmen zodiacal and planetary iconography, see Tuhfat al-ghara'ib, Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Ms. Ν.

Astronomy was the science of observation and astrology the science of forecast in which planets, by their associations with the zodiacal signs, played a significant role in the macro-cosm and in the future of humanity.6 Thus, it seems that the miniatures, which show the concentric circles of the planetary paths or the constellations of the fixed stars as planispheres, could have had a higher astronomical func-tion than as 'sectored' representations showing zodiacal signs and planetary deities, yet without any systematic representation of these latter. Among the miniatures that have reached us, three main categories of celestial representations can be distinguished: Similar to the celestial globes or painted vaults of ancient times (Lehmann 1945; L'Orange 1953, 18-27), some illustrations are limited to the realm of the fixed stars, the constellations of the northern and southern hemispheres, and the zodiac, agreeing with the canonical mythography established by Aratus and his successors, and similar to the planisphere of Bern (Codex Bernens is, ninth century, fol. lib)7 or the planisphere of Rome (Ms. Vat. Graec. 1087, fifteenth century; see ill. 2).8 The astronomical sky is also present in Islamic Art. Apart from instruments of study like globes, there exist illuminated treatises among which we find The Book of the Fixed Stars by 'Abd al-Rahmän al-Süff (Wellesz 1959; Wellesz 1965; Kunitzsch 1986) as the most representative, dating back to the eleventh century. That type of sky is also represented on the vault of the cal-darium of the Umayyad palace of Qusayr 'Amrah (Saxl 1932). The second category is represented by the Byzantine planisphere of Ptolemy's Tables (Vatican Library, Ms. Vat. Graec. 1291, ninth century), which was copied from an original dating back to the third or fourth century. Helios, as Apollo Phoebus, stands in the middle of the miniature, surrounded in order by the twelve months, then the twelve protecting deities, and finally the twelve zodiacal signs (ill. 3). During the Hellenistic period, the spherical representation of the heavens was an accepted convention, in the upper sphere of which each sign of the zodiac was connected to one of the twelve major gods of the Greco-Roman pantheon (Seznec 1993, 49-52).9 The third group of representations, of which the planispheres of the Leiden Codex Vossianus (Katzenstein and Savage-Smith 1988; Eastwood 1983) or its Carolingian copy of Boulogne-sur-Mer (ill. 4) are examples, shows the cosmological system that Aristotle, then Ptolemy, imposed on as-6 \"II n'y a aucun traite d'astronomie dans la litterature latine parce qu'il n'y eut aucun astronome de metier ä Rome\" (Le Boeuffle 1973, 10). 7 Map of the Fixed Stars, Bern, Codex Bernensis 88, 1000, eleventh century, fol. 1 lb, Vermaseren 1974, pi.

The spheres are embedded on one another in the following order: the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and, beyond, the eighth sphere of the fixed stars, in this case the zodiac (Verdet 1990, 39-70; Morelon 1997; Obrist 2004, 53-165). This system, in which the number of planets is limited to seven, was founded both on centuries-old as-tronomical observation and the identification of stars with the Babylonian planetary deities. It was adopted by the Chaldaean astrologers who redefined the relationships between the signs and planets by attributing one diurnal and one nocturnal sign to each planet, and only one sign to each luminary.10 Thus, in the 'astronomical' planispheres of Leiden and Boulogne, the seven spheres (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon) overlap, but they also embrace the heliocentric conception of Heraclides Pon-ticus in which Mercury and Venus appear as satellites of the sun (Flamant 1978, 381-391). That point of view was completely abandoned when the Ptolemaic geocentric system stood out in the miniatures of the medieval West. Although representing planetary orbits is characteristic of geocentric planispheres, it seems to have been either unknown or neglected in Islamic art, since it was mainly used for theoretical purposes within scientific astro-nomical books.11 This type of Ptolemaic representation is also remarkably illustrated by a Turkish Ottoman miniature dating back to the sixteenth century from a copy of a Zubdat al-tawärlkh, which also displays the mansions of the moon (ill. 5).12 A planisphere is used to represent the earth, which is set in the mid-dle and surrounded by the different spheres upon which the planets are drawn: the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Above rises the sphere of the fixed stars symbolized by the zodiac, then the 28 lunar mansions (Varisco 1991), and finally the great sphere of the Throne carrying the whole universe (Nasr 1976, 238). In that perspective, a few miniatures characterized by a very sche-matic representation of a Ptolemaic heavenly structure illustrate copies of the Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (Kitab fi ma 'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya) by al-Jazarl (595-597H./1198-1200), with the most ancient example, the Ms. T.S.K.

A circular plan shows the main mechanism, the orbit of the sun and moon around the earth, and the zodiacal circle decorated with the twelve constellations whose imagery is taken from the simplified astronomi-cal figures of 'Abd al-Rahmän al-Süfi's Book of the Fixed Stars. These miniatures could thus be the first to show a circular representation of the zo-diac, yet without planets and with no cosmological signification. Variants of the circular zodiac with a stronger astrological association can be seen in two other copies: the manuscript of the Freer Gallery of Art, copied in 1315,14 and in Istanbul manuscript T.S.L. A. 3461.15 The shape of the signs used in these cases shows the presence of the planets.16 Thus the horoscope of Iskandar Sultan should be classified as belong-ing to the iconographic tradition of early planispheres divided into sectors representing the zodiac, planets, and angels, which have been substituted for the winds, seasons, or winged spirits. This overall organization can partly be observed on metallic objects of the Islamic world dating back as early as the twelfth or thirteenth centuries (ill. 6-7). Practical requirements explain this organization better than the themes themselves, since these objects are round, for example, trays and the bottoms of bowls or cauldrons (Baer 1981, 17). The miniature deserves our attention for several reasons: it shows the horoscope of Iskandar as a historical document celebrating his apogee (El-well-Sutton 1984); it uses an iconography of signs and planets typical of Timurid workshops of the first half of the fifteenth century; and even if it reflects a view of the heavens characteristic of general Islamic cosmological principles, these latter clearly have an ideological dimension influenced by astrological doctrines thatreveals the prince's political and religious convic-tions. 13 The figures of this Zodiac have the same shapes as one of the first illustrated manu-scripts of the Book of Fixed Stars depicted by the son of the astronomer 'Abd al-Rahmän al-Süfi and realized according to his recommendations. On al-JazarT manu-scripts, see Ward 1985; gagman and Tamndi 1979, 10. 14 Atil 1975, ill. no 44, 103: the copy dating back to 715H./1315 was executed in Syria by Farrük b.

A. 3461 is dated to the thirteenth century. 16 The iconography of the astrological Zodiac is rather different from its astronomical counterpart; see the different shapes in Qazwlnl's illustrated copies from 'Ajä'ib al-makhlüqät, Caiozzo 2004a.

A Classical Iconography of the Zodiac and Planets in the Horoscope From a stylistic point of view, the horoscope of Iskandar Sultan has been classified by specialists as belonging to the style of the school of Shiräz (Gray 1979), and some scholars have attributed the miniatures to the master PIr Muhammad Baghl ShamalT (Robinson 1990, 14). Many elements seem to support this interpretation. After an education in Baghdad, PIr Muhammad became the greatest master of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir's workshop. He was abducted by TTmür among the spoils of war and, once in ShTraz, he first served Iskandar Sultan who then ruled the city. Robinson, who identified his particular style, reminds us that it reflects some specific features of Jalayirid miniatures. The painter is also supposed to have illustrated three scientific manuscripts written for Prince Iskandar: An Album (Istanbul, T.S.L. B. 411) and two scientific anthologies preserved in Istanbul and London (Robinson 1990, 8). The decorative style of the background and faces is close to what can be observed in Iskandar Sultan's other scientific manuscripts that are deco-rated with astrological, astronomical (Richard 1997),17 or magical motifs, as in several folios (138a-166b) of an astrological and talismanic treatise en-closed in Album B. 411 (816 H./1413) in the Museum of Topkapi Sarayi (Lentz and Lowry 1989, 148, pi. 48; Tourkin 2003, 8f.). In particular, two treatises of the same work entitled Raudat al-Munajjimln—preserved in two volumes of astronomical and astrological texts dedicated to Iskandar Sultan—display constellations drawn in a closely related style using a very similar iconography (Gray 1977, 70f.; Robinson 1958, 11). These two treatises, illuminated at the same time in April and May of the year 813 H./1411, are very similar.

One is reminded of the astrological motifs drawn in Jalayirid workshops, such as those decorating the Kitab al-Bulhän preserved in Oxford (Carboni 1988), or the cosmography preserved in the B.n.F. (Ms. B.n.F. Sup person 332) (Caiozzo 2003c, 59-78), and, most of all, the exceptional Kitab al-Mawätid that was shared between the Keir Collection and the Library of the University of Sarajevo (Carboni 1987). The horoscope illustrations fall be-tween the more elaborate Jalayirid motifs and the astrological prototypes dat-ing from the Timurid Period, which folio 164a illustrates perfectly. 3.1. An Astrological Representation The horoscope of Iskandar shows the planets and zodiac according to a pre-cise order inspired by the astrological requirements linked to the theme. Thus, the horoscope stands apart from the other circular miniatures, as on folio 164a, or on a formerly isolated folio of the Binney Collection that could be of Jalayirid origin (Badiee 1978, 422, PI. 58), in which the planets are drawn around the sun in the center of the composition. This particular order echoes that of the planets on many metallic artifacts (ill. 6-7)} The order in which the planets are displayed could testify to the sur-vival within the Arabo-Persian world of a vision inspired by the astrological geography of the keshvars, which can be found for instance in al-BTrünl (al-BTrünl 1934, 142f., Corbin 1960, 40-48, Nasr 1976, 37). According to the principle of the Hermetic analogies, the planets rule over the parts of the world related to them as in the Haft Paykar, one of Nizami's tales of the Hamsa (Vesel 1995). The Islamic tradition brought forth another cosmological vision: the seven planets revolve around the sun, the zodiac belongs to the sphere of the fixed stars, and beyond the external circle appear the angels carrying the world, namely, the 'Arsh or God's throne (Fahd 1966, 162; Fahd 1959, 237-251; Nasr 1976, 31-37; Jachimowicz 1975, 150f.).

Here, although the zodiac does not decorate the image's outer border as the eighth sphere does in theory, it still provides the stable element holding the planets when they enter the sky of the newborn child, or when they come into a given house. According to Elwell-Sutton,21 the planets are distributed in the signs and houses calculated by the astrologers. If Venus is in the third house in Pisces, however, the other planets are distributed with a half-sign shift: the fourth house is vacant but the sun should be there; the fifth house has the sun in it, but Mercury and Jupiter should be there; in the sixth house dwell Jupi-ter, Mercury, Saturn, and the moon, when it should only have the moon and Saturn; the tenth house, which is vacant, should shelter Mars who in fact ap-pears in the eleventh house. The painter seems to have favored each planet's position in houses which do not necessarily correspond to the signs. That choice allowed the artist to emphasize Taurus, which had the sun in it and was associated with Iskandar. The sun was represented as larger than the other planets, since it is the planet of kings and princes. Likewise, two other planets have their size increased for emphasis: Mars, the planet of war and victories, was placed in Scorpio (its nocturnal sign), and Venus, as the protector of arts and leisure, was represented in Pisces, usually the sign of Venus's exaltation. Thus, desire for power, ambition for military campaigns and the conquest of new territo-ries, and, finally, patronage of art and spiritual creations are symbolized by these three planets. They establish the specific features of the theme, the ma-jor aspirations and realizations of Iskandar Sultan's reign up to 1411. 3.2. The Planets as Iconographic Prototypes in Islamic Astrology The iconography of the planets was established during the twelfth century, with the most ancient examples transmitted in the decoration of Iranian or Syrian and Mesopotamian metallic artifacts. When not associated with the signs of the zodiac, planetary representations follow two main iconographic tendencies in the fifteenth century. The planets of Iskandar's horoscope, like those represented on folio 164a of the Album Hazine or in the Timurid cosmographies of 1420-1440, follow the original iconographic tradition. At the dawn of Arab astrological 20 For example, Muhammad Refi Khän, Hamle-i Hayderi, Ms. B.n.F.

It was mainly inherited from the surviv-ing cults of the planets, such as those worshipped by the Sabians of Harrän. We know them from numerous sources, among which are Ibn al-Nadim, al-Mas'üdl, Fakhr al-DIn Räzl, and al-BTrünl; their intellectual heirs, the Ikhwän al-Safa'; and even from texts describing their rituals, as the compendium en-titled Ghäyat-al-Hakim, \"The Goal of the Wise\" or Picatrix (Ritter and Pless-ner 1962). The iconography of the planets, further endowed with stylistic influ-ences from Central Asia, was fixed as early as the end of the twelfth century, as we can observe on an Iranian cauldron, the Vaso Vescovali (Pinder-Wilson 1951; Hartner 1973), or in a compendium of Saldjuq magic, classi-fied as Ms. B.n.F. persan 174 (Barrucand 1991). We can also see this in the cosmography of Munich, 'Ajä'ib al-makhlüqät wa gharä'ib al-mawjüdät, illuminated in 1283 during the author's lifetime, and whose figures are not far from those of Iskandar's horoscope (Saxl 1912). The second iconographic tradition is characterized by the representa-tions of planetary series typical of the Turkmen and Timurid cosmographies of the end of the fifteenth century, such as the 'Ajä'ib al-makhlüqät of the B.n.F. (Paris, Ms. Sup. persan 1781) and the Tuhfät al-gharä 'ib of the Ö.N.B. (Vienna, Ms. N.F. 155).22 The latter shows some variation in the figures' at-tributes, which tend to be simplified (Caiozzo 2003a, 287-290). Since the twelfth century, al-Qamar, the moon, had been a human figure, sitting cross-legged and holding a circle in front of his or her head. The divinity, whose origin is Semitic, is male but, from an astrological point of view, the moon is female, which inverts it towards the sun. Thus, both luminaries have a relatively asexual aspect, as in the present case with the two beardless, crowned figures. They are dressed with great tunics spotted with gold (only the colors are different), sitting in identical postures, holding golden water-drop shaped halos in front of their faces (Caiozzo 2003a, 99-101, 172). The moon, as the sun, al-Shams, stands for power, yet the sun sym-bolizes the power of sovereigns, temporal kings, and mighty people, whereas the moon symbolizes viziers, administrators, and the followers of the prince (al-Blrünl 1934, 252-254). Mercury, al-'Utärid, whose tutelary divinity was Nabü, protector of scribes, dressed in a blue robe and a white turban, points at a bookstand with an inkwell beside it. This picture is different from the usual illustrations 22 See the iconography of the planets in Vienna: Ö.N.B., N.F. 155 (Tabriz, 1492), Duda 1983, I, 76, pi. 73-74-75, and those in Paris, Ms. B.n.F., Sup. persan 1781, Herat, 1488; Richard 1998, pi. 101.

Protector of scribes and secretaries in Arab astrology too, he is also the protector of intellectual functions, teachers, thinkers, and astrologers. This may explain his promotion to the role of an active character in the present case, since he points at the book lying on the bookstand (Caiozzo 2003a, 102f., 175). Dressed in pink and wearing a crown, Venus, al-Zuhara, the protector of leisure, whose iconography was inspired by the Mesopotamian and Iranian goddesses (Ishtar, Anähita, etc.), stands as a courtesan playing the lute as in most representations dating back to the Timurid period (Caiozzo 2003 a, 104-106, 175). Mars, al-Mirrikh, a planet linked to war and violence, is endowed with his usual attributes: he holds a sword in his left hand and grasps the head of the warrior he has just beheaded with his right (Caiozzo 2003a, 106-109, 176). Jupiter, al-Mushtari, who became the planet of wisdom, of medita-tion, and of pious and righteous men thanks to astrology, is represented as holding an astrolabe (Caiozzo 2003a, 176). Such a representation was usual after the second half of the fifteenth century, particularly in Turkmen manu-scripts. The astrolabe, whose function is to determine the direction of the qibla, plays an essential part in the elaboration of astrological charts. This may explain its presence in the picture. In Timurid and Turkmen manuscripts, Saturn, al-Zuhal, is usually represented as a disheveled Hindu divinity with numerous arms holding vari-ous attributes. Some are represented: crowns, and a small basket from which a rat seems to escape. Still, this character is close to the type of Jalayirid rep-resentation found in the Kitäb al-Bulhän or on metallic artifacts, where he stands as an old bearded and dark-skinned man, half-dressed, with a red pair of trousers or a red loincloth. Saturn's attributes are mostly associated with the agrarian activities he protects, or with dark and noxious animals living underground, such as rats. The crowns symbolize the wisdom associated with experience and patience, some of the qualities he embodies as Kronos who founded the kingship during the Golden Age of Humanity, but whose chil-dren siezed his throne. Later he became the antithesis of a king, with a black sun symbolizing tyranny. Like Mars, Saturn is a powerful and malefic planet whose attributes can be used as talismans (Caiozzo 2003b). All the planets are servants of Prince Iskandar and seem to show him the way to follow: Saturn offers him experience in power, Mercury shows him the occupation of the astrologers and intellectual faculties, Jupiter teaches piety and justice, Mars warfare, and Venus leisure and artistic crea-tions.

The Zodiacal Signs in Timurid Style The zodiac is finely painted in the horoscope of Iskandar Sultan: animals are drawn with restraint in browns and greys, while the clothes of the people are decorated with golden embroideries; stylized clouds are drawn in every me-dallion and in the background of the planets. Its zodiacal signs can be distinguished from the astronomical zodiacal signs in two of Iskandar's other scientific manuscripts {Ms. F. 1418 of the University of Istanbul and Ms. Add. 27.261 of the British Library), which show constellations according to the iconographic tradition established at the end of the tenth century by 'Abd-al-Rahmän al-Süfi (Caiozzo 2003a, 92-95). The signs of the horoscope belong to one of the two traditions that were established between the twelfth and the fifteenth century. In the first tradition, signs and planets are always associated, as on Syrian and Egyptian metallic objects dating back to the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. The second tradition shows some series in which the planets are not systematically asso-ciated with one of their two zodiacal signs, thus leaving space to create a large number of variations. In this case, animal signs (Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces) can be distinguished from human signs which merged with their planets in domicile (Sagittarius with Jupiter and the Dragon's tail, Virgo with Mercury, Aquarius with Saturn, Gemini with Mer-cury and the Dragon's head). At the end of the fifteenth century, these series were progressively simplified as can be seen in Turkmen cosmographies.23 The iconographic originality is based on the dynamic and lively repre-sentation of the human figures, and on the particular image of Gemini, whose characters look as if they were fighting over a crown. These latter accurately follow the Jalayirid tradition, since they are represented as Siamese twins and not yet as an ophidian creature holding a spear stuck into a monster's head, as commonly found later, and in particular on folio 164a. 4. An Ephemeral Reign under the Protection of Heaven? In contrast to his relatives, Iskandar Sultan was a Shi'ite of Horufi obedience, a reformed Ismaili sect centered on letter symbolism (Richard 1996, 59f.; Corbin 1972, 233-237). This encouraged Iskandar's interest in the study of the skies, including the conception of the heavens presented by the horo-scope, its possible singularity, and the meaning or politico-religious inten-tions that could be detected there. 23 See note 16 above.

In addition, human beings are subjected to a system of correspon-dences between the heavens and the earth through the astral influx which allows the earthly advent of divine archetypes. The planetary influences are thus decisive, and the will of God is exerted via the stars and served by a multitude of angels (Peters 2004, 68-70). The question is then raised whether the horoscope of Iskandar also shows such a system of correspondences be-tween the heavens and the earth, within which the heavenly bodies would play an active part. 4.1. Protective Angels The four angels that govern the destiny of Iskandar's horoscope on folio 164a remind us of the figures of the winds or of divinities in ancient representa-tions of the heavens. Carved ceilings, bas-reliefs, or mosaics dedicated to the stars were generally surrounded by the winds or the seasons, and here the angels, worthy successors of these apotropaic divinities, are obviously play-ing the same part. Winds are indeed the oldest such decorative elements: they adorn the corner pieces of a Babylonian tablet considered to be one of the earliest known planispheres, in which the world is represented according to the prin-ciples of both the seven regions and the four quadrants that divide the world. These four quadrants are the four winds that rule the destiny of human be-ings: The north-west wind, which belongs to Ishtar; the south-west wind, which carries diseases and disasters, associated with the demons; the south-east wind, which blows the clouds from the sea; and the north-east wind, from the mountain (Unger 1935). The angels gradually replaced the winds in ancient planispheres. In-deed, the four winds theoretically rule the organization of the ancient skies. These blowing winds can be seen on the Tabula Bianchini (Abry 1993, pi. VII). Furthermore, we find them as tutelary divinities in many works of Ro-man times: mosaics, bas-reliefs, and carved ceilings representing gods, stars, mythological, or cosmological scenes, particularly in the corner pieces of circular compositions. 24 The Sabians of Harrän worshipped the stars until the ninth century; even after their conversion to Islam, they continued—albeit secretly—their rituals and magical practices until the eleventh century; see Green 1992; Pingree 1980.

Endowed with two pairs of wings, they are reminiscent of certain Timurid angels. For example, one can observe them on the astrological wooden tablets of Grand or in Dak-hla. Elsewhere, they are simply dadophores, as in Dendera or in al-Salämünl (Abry 1993 pi. 2-3-4-5, fig. 5, pi. V, fig. 3). In the same manner, four winged geniuses—in which H. Seyrig wanted to see the eagle, symbol of Jupiter— surrounded the busts of the seven planets in Bel's temple in Palmyra (Seyrig, Amy and Will 1975,11). Angels were rather quickly substituted for the winds, since they were deprecated for their evil connotations (Raff 1978-1979). Indeed, the winds belong to the world of sublunary creatures that depend on the generation of demons, in contrast to the angelic inhabitants of Heaven. In Jewish and Gnos-tic cosmologies, angels and demons are known for their psychopomp func-tion, leading the souls to the beyond. In monotheistic religions, the winds progressively disappeared, leaving their places, appearances, identities, and functions as psychopomp and mediating messengers of God to the angels (Leclercq-Marx 1990, 33; Cumont 1933, 70-75). Identifying the winds with angels, beneficial and protective creatures, originated in antiquity, for example in Babylon, where protective geniuses were found frequently at the entrances of temples. They were called cheru-bim, and their names were: Nattig, an eagle; Alap-kirub, a human-faced bull; Lamas-Nirgal, a human headed lion; and Ustur, a human being.25 On folio 164a as in the horoscope, each crowned angel offers a pre-sent: in the horoscope of Iskandar, there are two crowns, symbolizing power, and two golden dishes. But the presents are more varied on folio 164a: a sword, a crown, a dish with precious gems, and an incense burner. These four objects brought by the divine messengers symbolize the roles, attributes, and qualities of the prince, which are offered by the angels as nativity gifts: the military qualities are symbolized by the sword; the jewels characterize the prosperity of the reign, and the crown its temporal power; the incense sym-bolizes the piety of the Muslim leader. In the horoscope, they offer crowns and golden plates, usual presents for good fortune and prosperity in the East, namely power and wealth. In Greco-Roman antiquity, the winged geniuses were seldom repre-sented as offering presents; likewise, Christian angels discreetly surround the significant scenes (various theophanies, the presentation, etc.), but they never bear presents. Conversely, Buddhist frescoes of central Asia show not only worshippers carrying numerous presents, but also angels offering a dish to 25 PI. 78 in Parrot 1981, 70, and Amiet 1977, pi. 595, 403; pi. 606 and 607, 406; see also Marques-Riviere 1972, 96.

The four angels were often identified with the highest angels of the hierarchy or archangels (Fahd 1971, 168; Tabäff 1980, 39): Mikhä'Il, in charge of human souls (Qur'an 52:6); Jibrä'Il, messenger of God; Isräfil, blowing into a trumpet and foretelling the Last Judgement; Isrä'Tl, the angel of death (Qur'an 32:2). According to al-Büm's advices, the latter should have been placed in the corners of pentacles, talismans, and horoscopes (Doutte 1984, 158-159; Spoer 1935, 252). 4.2. Angels Carrying Presents as a Theophany of Sovereignty? In the mediaeval Islamic world, the structure of Heaven inherited from both Aristotelian and Ptolemaic systems (Jachimowicz 1975; Savage-Smith 1992) was enriched with elements of Neoplatonic and Hermetic philosophies, of which astrological traditions and certain Shi'ite sects were the heirs. This explains why heaven progressively became the reflection of the terrestrial world (Nasr 1976; Nasr 1978; Duhem 1997, 67). The earth was divided into seven regions; each was ruled by one of the planets according to the principles of the astrological geography devel-oped in the Tetrabiblos (Jachimowicz 1975, 146f.). This astrological geogra-phy was taken up by Abü Ma'shar in his Madkhal, who complemented it with a complex system of planetary correspondences. The planets not only ruled their own spheres; they were also the seats of the archetypes that mate-rialized on earth. In addition, as told in every version of the Prophet's Ascen-sion, each of the seven spheres was endowed with particular characteristics: composition, color, angels, prophets, qualities, and divine theophanies (Cor-bin 1980, 67-141). Furthermore, in the Islamic cosmology evoked by the Qur'an, the sun and the moon are distinguished from the other planets according to their im-portance, but remain subordinated to God. The sun in particular holds the first rank; its light emanates from the 'Arsh, God's own throne, whereas the moon's light only emanates from the pedestal, al-Kursi (Fahd 1959, 256-57). Allah placed the sun at the center of the Universe in order to transmit the influx of al-Rüh, the divine spirit, to men. As a beating heart at the center of the universe or a breath, al-Qalb (Marquet 1999, 115), the sun animates 26 Von Le Coq 1959, 101 and 111.

According to the theory of Hermetic correspondences between the celestial and terrestrial worlds developed by Abü Ma'shar27 and al-BIrünl in the Tafhim (al-BTrüm 1934), the sun patronizes kings, nobility, and powerful men; furthermore, it symbolizes good government and legitimate power (Marquet 1999, 116-118). Since a man is the reflection of the stars which protect him, it is es-sential to establish his horoscope in order to guide this chain of correspon-dences that extends to inform all he needs for living, eating, residing, or clothing (al-BIrünT 1934). Thus, a man is a complete microcosm closely re-lated to the macrocosm. Animated by the divine spirit al-Rüh that blows through each of the seven spheres, this soul animates the different parts of the body by analogy (Fahd 1966, 163f.; al-BIrünl 1934, 216), thus playing an essential part in the moral and physical health of the sign's native (Tourkin 2004). The seven planets make it possible for the divine emanation to be ex-pressed on earth through their respective qualities by means of theophanies and by the descent of the spirits which inhabit them and are called \"angels\" (Marquet 1999; Peters 2004). The sun is the king of the heavenly bodies, and is higher than the other planets; its qualities—in addition to beauty, nobility, and light—provide life, growth, and order, balancing celestial and terrestrial matters (Marquet 1999, 114-118). Saturn, the evil planet par excellence, gen-erates sadness, misfortune, and death, but is also the one who brings quiet and stability (Marquet 1999, 118f.). Jupiter brings harmony, beauty, wisdom, temperance, and also spiritual happiness; it shows the way to God (Marquet 1999, 119f.). Venus conveys joy and beauty, as well as terrestrial happiness and pleasure (Marquet 1999, 12If.). Mercury leads men to fulfillment in the field of knowledge and the intellect, and opens the gates to hidden knowledge (Marquet 1999, 122f.). Finally, the moon is no pale copy of the sun. It plays a crucial role in 'generation and corruption', conveying the emanation from the upper worlds by proceeding as a regulator or as a 'lung' (Marquet 1999, 123-127). Likewise, the twelve signs of the zodiac play a central role in trans-mitting the emanations of the planets with which they are associated, increas-ing or reducing them according to the respective planets and signs (Marquet 1999, 112). Consequently, the horoscope's organization may be interpreted in the following way: the angels carry the planetary influx through signs and houses, and thus inform the destiny of the native who is symbolized by the converging point at the center of the horoscope. Since they serve the planets and are protective, should we not expect the angels of the horoscope to have a much more obvious mission, namely, to 27 Abü Ma'shar 1995, 3, 552-555: Qawl VIII, Fasl IX.

The horoscope was written at the height of Iskandar Sultan's reign, when he became the master of Shiraz during the summer of 1409. In 1410-1411 he tried to seize Isfahan, which was at this time allotted to his brother Rustam. These victories, which led the prince to claim more and more territories and political power, revealed an individual thirsting after power and conscious of his own strength, as the chronicler Mir Dawlathshäh underlines (Thackston 1989, 30): On the 4th of Dhu-l-hijja 813: dec 31 1410 the Iskandar power over Fars and Persian Iraq reached its zenith. He was always proud of his splendor and daring and boastfully recited heroic verses, even composing his own: \"What importance can the Gog (and Magog) of world events have for me, who am like Alexander's dam in splendor ?\" Iskandar considered himself to be the heir of TImür Leng, and the anony-mous author of the Synoptic Account—written in 1413 and preserved at T. S. M. in Album Β 411—while celebrating Iskandar's work as patron and his incomparable qualities, reveals his political and territorial ambitions at his uncle Shäh Rükh's expense: \"He (TImür) left his great empire as a legacy to His Highness Sultan Iskandar—may he enjoy long life and great fortune\" (Thackston 2001, 90a).

[...] Indeed the reason for the creation of worldlings was the appearance of his noble essence, for regardless of how one looks backward to the time of Adam and searches through past princes, kings and emperors, not one of them \"has even a scent of our spring.\" Just as the Divine Majesty is without equal or peer, so too is he the shadow of that very es-sence and the manifestation of those very attributes. So exalted is his quality of dominion and so great his felicity [...]. (Thackston 2001, 91) By reconstructing the biography of Iskandar Sultan, P. Soucek (1996, 74) raised an essential question: can the ambitions of the prince be found in the manuscripts he commissioned? The interpretation of the four angels repre-sented here raises the same question. One notices the accumulation of crowns which decorate the horoscope—crowns that indicate temporal sovereignty in the medieval Muslim world. Of course, crowns are often decorative headgear in the Jalayirid and Timurid miniatures. In the context of the horoscope, however, they are too numerous not to be significant. The crowns both indi-cate the authority of their holders—crowns carried by angels, planets (the sun, the moon, Saturn, Venus), and signs (Libra)—and they constitute pre-sents offered by angels, planets (Saturn), and signs (Gemini?). There are thir-teen crowns in total! As already emphasized, according to the astrological conception of Isma'ili such as the Ikhwän al-Safa' (\"The Brethren of Purity\"), many angels accompany the planets, preceding them, raising flags with their colors, carry-ing their influx and the divine prototypes which have to be incarnated on earth. Also, are crowns not theophanic symbols of sovereignty wished by the Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132   AnnaCaiozzo   heavens? Sent by God and located beyond the planets and zodiac, do the four messengers not provide divine approval and legitimacy for Iskandar's power? In 1407 Iskandar was ruling Yazd; in 1409 he seized Fars when his brother PIr Muhammad died, and settled in Shiraz; then, in 1411-1412, Isfahan was subjugated. The horoscope was painted at the peak of his glory and his hegemonic ambitions concerning western Iran. The two crowns held by Saturn and the angels could respectively symbolize the territorial heritage claimed by Iskandar and the sovereignty designated by the heavenly powers. Power, glory, and wealth: The angels here show the consecration of the prince as acceding to sovereignty, a dynast whose posterity will especially retain the benefits of a patron, as the author of the Anonymous Synoptic summarizes it: \"May God preserve him for ever and ever—until the disintegration of the world—upon the throne of patronage of the arts through the prophet and his glorious family\" (Thackston 2001, 92a). The ambitions of the prince were soon denounced by his uncle Shäh Rükh, successor of Tlmür, who, two years after the horoscope, accused him of strik-ing coins and of making the khutba pronounced in his own name (Soucek 1996, 74). Besides the references to astrological texts by authors such as Ptolemy, Dorotheus, Abü Ma'shar al-Balkhl, etc. (Elwell-Sutton 1984, 121), one finally notices in the comments of the horoscope the presence of Qur'anic verses related to the luminaries (7:54; 5:5) and the zodiacal signs (25:61). Are these verses linked to the Horufi beliefs of prince Iskandar de-veloped in the work of Saedin 'All Torkeh (Corbin 1972, 233-237), where a particular part is granted to the theosophy of light (Milstein 1986; Khairallah 1997)? Indeed, if the light refers to the luminaries of the Qur'an, these two stars were the seat of sovereignty and patronized kings and powerful men from time immemorial. Following the long tradition of Assyro-Babylonian astral royalty, the Iranian dynasts invested by Ahura Mazda placed the sym-bols of the sun and moon on their crowns, as the bas-relief of Täq-1-Bustän shows (Azarpay 1968, 113; Lewy, 1949). That tradition survived thanks to Arab astrology, via the planetary children, by retaining political power for the sun, the lord of kings and nobil-ity (al-BIrüm 1934, 252). Both temporal and spiritual royalty, granted by the heavens and aspired to by the prince, thus transformed Iskandar Sultan into the worthy heir of the holders of a cosmic kingship.

Conclusion Iskandar Sultan's horoscope raises many questions which remain partly un-answered due more to uncertainty about the painter's real intentions than to Iskandar's. It belongs to an iconographic tradition of zodiacal signs and plan-ets and should be interpreted within the continuity of Jalayirid forms and the emerging series of Timurid stereotypes; at the same time, it retained a certain originality. Moreover, it shows a representation that was adapted to the con-figuration of the heavens at a given time, and discreetly articulated a system of politico-religious thought to confirm an ambitious prince's ambitions, one obviously blessed by heaven. Indeed, if Iskandar Sultan was at the height of his power when the horoscope was constructed, his fall would have been imminent. Suspected of treason by his uncle Shäh Rükh in July 1413, he was imprisoned, blinded, and lost his throne. He was executed by his brother Rustam during the spring of 1415. The reign of Iskandar was like a shooting star, luminous but transi-tory, and, as a result of his unbounded ambition, condemned by the men of his own clan (Richard 1996, 46-48; Soucek 1996).

The use of astrology was neither an excuse to introduce astronomical knowledge into religious texts, nor a symbolic application of astral theories. On the con-trary, as I am going to make clear in this work, for these three writers, bibli-cal chronology was an expression of so-called mundane astrology. My work is a description of some of the horoscopes found in their writings. 1. Abraham bar Hiyya: The Kingdom of Israel Conjunction Bar Hiyya was a Jewish philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Barcelona (Spain) in the first half of the twelfth century. He worked as a Latin translator with Plato of Tivoli, and is considered together with Abraham ibn Ezra as responsible for the transmission of Islamic science from Al-Andalus (Spain) to the South of France.

The date Bar Hiyya fixes for this horoscope is the year of creation 2365, Adar 25.2 Bar Hiyya affirms that the ruler of this year was the sun (Aries 1°), which rules the beginning of the year, in the midheaven (Aries 22°).3 It was in a trine aspect with the rising sign (Leo 2°). Jupiter and Saturn were in con-junction (Aquarius 24°) in the seventh house, and both were also in conjunc-tion with the moon. All three were in a sextile aspect with the sun.4 All the stellar positions—Bar Hiyya clarifies—are according to the ir-regular movements of the planets. The horoscope that he proposes shows that: All the planets were above the horizon. The ruler of the year was the sun (which ruled the rising sign). The sun was in the midheaven, according to the equal division, or in the ninth house, according to the uneven division of the horizon.5 Both houses showed the strength of the sun and made its light shine. The sun looked at the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the seventh house.6 The moon was in a sextile aspect with the sun.7 1 Milläs Vallicrosa (1929, XLIX-L) expressed his doubts on the authenticity of the horo-scopes drawn in the manuscripts because their uneven presence in the different manu-scripts makes him suppose that these are probably later interpolations. 2 Approximately, March 11, 1397 BC. For the conversion of Jewish years into Gregorian years, I have used: Alan D. Corre, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2002, (www.uwm.edu/cgi-bin/corre/calendar [2 August 2003]). According to the author's warning, the Christian dates that result are only approximate because of historical inter-calations, although they are correct according to our present Gregorian calendar. 3 Jews had and continue to have a luni-solar calendar. Months follow the lunar cycle and seasons, the solar cycle. To avoid the gap between the lunar year and the solar year, they decided to intercalate a month seven times in a cycle of 19 years, in this way main-taining the Jewish festivals in their original seasons. Months and years both begin with the New Moon (called molad). Because of this gap between lunar and solar month, the twelve zodiacal signs did not coincide exactly with the twelve Jewish months, which is visible in some of the horoscopes, like this one of Bar Hiyya. For the Hebrew calendar, see Gandz 1954; 1956; 1970; Feldman 1979. 4 It is clear that the values for the aspects are not necessarily exact, which means that the trine aspect is not only a 120 degree angle between two planets, but also angles with a value above or below this. This margin is not explicit in the astrological texts of Bar Hi-yya, but we know from other medieval texts that it could be very generous. 5 On the division of the horizon in Bar Hiyya, see Sefer heshbon (Milläs Vallicrosa 1959, 96-98 and 103-105). 6 Saturn and Jupiter are in a cyclical conjunction every 960, 240 and 20 years which af-fects the destiny of peoples, religions and kingdoms; cf. Ibn Ezra's Sefer ha-olam. This theory influenced Bar Hiyya and Ibn Ezra through the writings of two Arabic astrolo-gers: Mäshä'alläh (eighth century) and Abu Ma'shar (ninth century).

The arrival of this kingdom will bring a new law, which will spread itself to the limits of the world as the sun spreads its light from the midheaven above the horizon at the beginning (mo-lad) of this year. The rising sign is a fixed sign (Leo), a quality that it shares with the sign (Aquarius) in which Saturn and Jupiter are conjoined. In consequence, the kingdom will be long, as many years as the great years of the sun, namely, 1461 years (the number of days of four solar years: 365.25 χ 4 = 1461). In addition, the stellar positions warn of the appearance of a great prophet by the following signs: The sun, which rules the year, also controls the ninth house (relig-ions), according to the uneven division of the horizon, in the Hebrew text, the division according to calculation (heshbon). The conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, according to the regular move-ment, is in Pisces, eighth sign from the rising sign,8 Leo, according to the equal division of the horizon, literally, the division according to the degrees of the zodiacal signs (ma 'alot ha-mazalot). 7 This affirmation of Bar Hiyya makes us suppose that he considered the sun and moon to form this aspect because there are two signs between them, even if the degrees separat-ing them are less than 60, the normal angular separation for a sextile aspect. 8 In the critical edition and the manuscripts it is written ninth, which is impossible.

The sun rules the year together with Mars because this last has its domicile in Aries, the sign in which the sun is. Since Aries is a cardinal sign, it will accelerate the coming of the prophet during this conjunction. Bar Hi-yya continues explaining that both planets—Saturn and Jupiter—are in con-junction, according to the regular movement, in Pisces. This sign is the domicile of Jupiter and the place of exaltation for Venus. This last was in conjunction in the first degree of Pisces, which belongs to its decan.9 Both Jupiter and Venus are connected with Pisces, and they are both favorable and righteous planets. The conjunction according to the irregular movement was in the sign Aquarius, which was called \"true sign\" among the four fixed signs, and it has a human figure. Therefore, the kingdom to appear should be a kingdom of truth and justice, which would govern with laws of rectitude and truth. In the first year of this conjunction a solar eclipse occurred at the end of the sixth hour of Siwan 29 (June 22).10 This eclipse obscured most of the sun (only one eighth of its light would be visible above Egypt). Bar Hiyya links the mean length of the eclipse, three hours, with the birth of Aaron, three days after it, and with that of Moses, three years later. He gives the chart of the eclipse: 9 Bar Hiyya does not give any definition for the decan, but Ibn Ezra gives one in the first (Fleischer 1951, 41) and second recension (Ben Menahem 1941, 13) of his Sefer ha-teamim. There he explains two systems for finding out the ruler of each panim or ten-degree division of each zodiacal sign. One system was Egyptian and assigned one ten-degree division to each of the rulers of the triplicity (fire, earth, air, water), beginning with the ruler corresponding to the sign from which the calculation is made (for exam-ple, Mars for Aries, sun for Leo, etc.). The second was Indian, and beginning from the ruler of the sign, continues not with the rulers of the triplicity, but with the rulers of the spheres according to their order from the Earth. Cf. Al-BTrünT (Wright 1934, [451] 263 and [449] 262), who also distinguishes between these two types of divisions, but calls only the last one face. 10 According to Bar Hiyya the day of the week was Tuesday.

Abraham ibn Ezra: Astrological Exegesis Abraham ibn Ezra was born in Tudela (Spain) in 1092. During his youth he visited the centers of Islamic learning in Al-Andalus. He divulged the sci-ences he had learned in many genres of writings: poems, biblical commentar-ies, scientific monographs, works on Hebrew grammar, etc. In 1140 he left Spain and began a life of wandering, his subsistence depending on the favor of patrons in the Jewish communities of Italy, France, and England, where he taught Arabic science. He died (it is supposed) in England, leaving as a leg-acy an extensive, varied and polemical set of works, which makes him a pro-totype of the so-called renaissance of the twelfth century. Ibn Ezra is the most striking and original of the three writers consid-ered here. Although he did not innovate in astrology or astronomy, he had the audacity to incorporate astrological beliefs into the Jewish creed. In doing so, he did not force either to conform to the other. Thus he found astrological Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"150 Josefina Rodriguez-Arribas clues disseminated throughout the Torah: in the order of the Ten Command-ments, in the structure of the Temple, and in the organization of the Israelite tribes after the exodus from Egypt. He was certainly very critical of the as-tronomical and astrological theories of his time. This can be seen in his monographs on the different branches of astrology or in his technical treatises on astronomy and the calendar. His encyclopedic spirit led him to compare doctrines, theories, and data of very different origins. He set out and criti-cized them, choosing those he considered correct. Mostly he provided rea-sons, but sometimes (albeit infrequently) he left the question to the reader's discretion. Ibn Ezra seems to have understood astrology as an ensemble of natu-ral laws stemming from the nature of the stars, but above all from the ordered structure of the universe as it was created by God. Thus he often repeats that the stars are the executors of God's will (he calls them in Hebrew ha-meshartim, \"the servants\"). The influence that they exert on the world of creatures is simply an expression of divine providence, the way in which God looks after each one of His created individuals, because (as Ibn Ezra repeats from time to time) God knows individuals only as universals.11 The clearest case of a horoscope in the heart of a biblical commentary is that of Israel's camp in the desert after the exodus from Egypt.12 The text of Ibn Ezra is difficult to understand, as usual, and we have to consider four of his excursuses in order to grasp the meaning. In his commentary on Num 2:2 (Weizer 1976, 115), Ibn Ezra presents four of the twelve tribes of Israel, whose banners and places in the camp of Israel are connected with the four fixed signs of Ptolemaic astrology (Rob-bins 1998, 64-69). The banners of these four tribes were: Reuben, a man (Aquarius); Judah, a lion (Leo); Ephraim, a bull (Taurus); Dan, an eagle (Scorpio). Ibn Ezra links these figures with the four cherubim that the prophet Ezekiel saw during his exile in Babylonia, the tetramorphs (Ezek 1:5-28).13 Strick-man and Silver (1999, 12 note 8) rightly observe that just as the cherubim held the Throne of God, these four tribes held God's presence over the Israel-11 Cf. Ibn Ezra's commentary on Exod 33:21 (Weizer 1977, 215-218). 12 This is not the only horoscope in Ibn Ezra's biblical commentaries. He also mentions the horoscope of the deluge and that of the exodus from Egypt. 13 This association is clearly given by the figures of the cherubim as well as by the fact that, in the vision of Ezekiel, each tetramorph is associated with a wheel. This wheel evokes the cycle that the sun completes around the zodiac.

According to the text of Num 2:2, the four tribes and their banners were placed in the desert camp with the following orientations: Right (south): Reuben; Left (north): Dan; Back (west): Ephraim; Face (east): Judah. Illustration 3: Abraham ibn Ezra Anthropomorphic orientation SOUTH Right hand EAST Face WEST Back NORTH Left hand What is the meaning of such positions? The most important signs are the car-dinal signs, because they mark the moments of the solstices and equinoxes (Robbins 1998, [I. 10] 58-65 and [I. 11] 66-69), as Ibn Ezra says in his Sefer ha-teamim (Fleischer 1951, 56). However, the signs implied in the biblical text are those following the seasonal changes, the fixed signs, so called, ac-cording to our writer, because the weather does not change and is stable in them (Sefer ha-teamim, Ben Menahem 1941, 5). In order to understand the mention of these signs, we have to consider Ibn Ezra's commentary on Amos 5:8 (Simon 1989, 209-215). In it, our writer explains two stellar names that appear in the text of Amos: Kimah and Kesil. Ibn Ezra identifies the first one with the Pleiades (in the constellation of Tau-rus) and the second one with the constellation of Scorpio, and sometimes with its star Antares. He affirms that these two stars were important in the biblical text because they coincided with the equinoxes in biblical times: the Pleiades with the vernal equinox, and Antares with the autumnal equinox. These referential points have changed from then because of the astronomical phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes, by which zodiacal con-stellations and signs coincide only once every (approximately) 26,000 years, Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"152 Josefina Rodriguez-Arribas the duration of the cycle of the fixed stars (the eighth sphere in the astro-nomical system of Ibn Ezra). From the previous considerations we infer the following correspon-dences: Reuben—Aquarius—winter solstice; Judah—Leo—summer solstice; Ephraim—Taurus—vernal equinox; Dan—Scorpio—autumnal equinox. To specify the angles of the horoscope that Ibn Ezra seems to have had in mind, finally, we have to consider his commentary on Num 1:19 (Weizer 1976, 114f.). Here he briefly explains that Reuben is the head of the camp and Dan its tail, and that they are placed facing south and north, respectively. Recalling that the camp was established on the first day of the second month in the second year after leaving Egypt, Ibn Ezra must have considered what the divisions of the sky (houses or batim) were at that exact moment, as he says in his excursus on Num 1:19: \"the directions of the world are four and each direction has three [sections].\"14 In this way, a horoscope results in which the south point (midheaven or tenth house) is occupied by the sign of Aquarius, and the north point (fourth house) by Scorpio. The Rising-sign is therefore Taurus (east) and the descendant Leo (seventh house). 14 See Sefer ha-teamim (Fleischer 1951, 55) where Ibn Ezra says that each quadrant of the horoscope is divided into three parts. In the second recension of this treatise (Ben Me-nahem 1941, 14), he adds that this happens because each quadrant has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

The special position of Reuben (Aquarius, the sign of Israel)16 in the midheaven, the place of power in the chart, and the place of Ephraim (Taurus) in the ascendant, the spring equinox of that mo-ment, points to the intention of making the people of Israel at that moment a kind of celestial talisman. The stellar and cosmological influence that such a talisman tries to capture is the instrument and expression of God's power. 3. Yosef ben Eliezer: The Horoscope of the Deluge Ben Eliezer was born in Huesca (Spain) in the second half of the 14th cen-tury. He traveled to the Orient, and it is known that he wrote his commentary on Ibn Ezra's commentaries to the Torah in Damascus (1370). He is espe-cially interested in the astrological clues implied in the writings of his master. The horoscope that he develops more extensively is that of the deluge (Gen 7:4-8:13). Ben Eliezer summarizes the data about the deluge given in the Torah (Herzog 1911-1930, 74-77): 15 Ben Eliezer proposed this same horoscope in his commentary on Ibn Ezra's commen-tary on this biblical passage (Herzog 1911-1930, 83). 16 See Ibn Ezra's commentary on Exod 31:18, where this is affirmed.

It lasted 40 days until Siwan 27 (Gen 7:4), third month of the year (May-June). For 150 days (five months) from the beginning, the deluge's effects were felt, until Tishri 17 (Gen 7:24 and 8:3-4), seventh month (Sep-tember-October). Noah sent the crow on Shebat 17 (Gen 8:7), eleventh month (January-February), nine months from the beginning of the deluge. Ben Eliezer next references two theories on the relationship of the deluge to stellar positions: one belongs to the sages of Israel, the other, to the astrolo-gers. The astrologers teach that the deluge began on the New Moon of Nisan (beginning of the month and season).17 But the New Moon (molad) is diffi-cult to determine. For this reason he decides to consider the Full Moon, which the sages of Israel used to do. According to the sages of Israel, the data for the horoscope of the de-luge are: The deluge began in the spring equinox (but the horoscope is fixed not at the New Moon, the beginning of the season, but at the Full Moon, the middle of the month). The sun was at the beginning of Aries, at the descending node (de-structive).18 The moon was in Scorpio (a water sign; it is harmful because it is the domicile of Mars). 17 All of them (Ben Eliezer, the astrologers, and the sages of Israel) think that the astro-logical fortune of the year is fixed according to the planetary positions on the first New Moon before the spring equinox, or the first Full Moon of the year. 18 Evidently, the sages of Israel were not following the biblical date, because they changed the beginning of the deluge from the second month (Iyyar) to the first (Nisan); in other words, they were aware that the zodiacal signs did not coincide with their original con-stellations because of the precession of fixed stars.

However, Ben Eliezer's text must have been paradoxical for his readers, because, while explaining the text of the Torah, he apparently strays from it, which must have raised con-siderable discussion among his contemporaries. Ibn Ezra avoided the risk of controversy, silencing any direct allusion to the precession in almost all his biblical writings. 4. Conclusions From the horoscopes considered, the difference is evident between Abraham bar Hiyya, on the one hand, and Abraham ibn Ezra and his disciple, Yosef ben Eliezer, on the other. This last closely followed his master in casting horoscopes starting from the biblical text and respecting Ibn Ezra's under-standing of astrology as an instrument of divine providence. Thus we can say that he did not innovate on the basis of Ibn Ezra's findings, but improved and completed them, as we can see in the horoscope of the deluge, which was developed more extensively by him than by his master. Unlike Ibn Ezra and Ben Eliezer, Bar Hiyya tried to give as much in-formation as possible for his horoscopes. He referred to planetary positions more or less exactly, e.g. in the first third, in the middle, at the beginning of the sign, and sometimes the number of degrees. He also explained his inter-pretation as founded on the astrological aspects between stars, which he ref-erences, especially the cyclical conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter.20 All this makes his texts clearer and more self-evident than those of Ibn Ezra, and even those of Ben Eliezer. On the contrary, we know that the degree of com-promise between religion and astrology is deeper in Ibn Ezra's work than in Bar Hiyya's, and that Ibn Ezra returns again and again to this relationship throughout his writings. If Ibn Ezra makes some astronomical information vanish in the horo-scopes under consideration, two reasons can be given: He takes this knowledge for granted among his learned readers. 20 Ibn Ezra applies the cyclical conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter to his exegetical texts, but in such a general way that we cannot construct a chart as we have for Bar Hiyya or Ben Eliezer. Ibn Ezra refers to the conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter in his commentar-ies on Exod 6:7, Exod 31:18, and Exod 33:21. He links this conjunction with the cycles that control the appearance and extinction of species (commentary on Eccl 1:9), with the exodus from Egypt (commentary on Exod 6:7), and the episode of the golden calf (commentary on Exod 31:18).

All three authors had knowledge of the astronomical phenomenon of the pre-cession, and two of them applied it more or less openly in the texts ex-pounded. Its use by Ben Eliezer, however, is the most problematic, and makes us suppose that the Jewish communities of his time (fourteenth cen-tury) were more learned and familiar with the sciences than those profiting from Ibn Ezra's works (twelfth century). Ibn Ezra's treatment of the sciences in the heart of his biblical commentaries was a subject of great interest, but also of controversy. Bar Hiyya was the first of them to propose a horoscope on a biblical episode, but given that he did not write biblical commentaries and that he devoted himself to the exposition of Arabic sciences in Hebrew and Latin, his impact on Jewish exegesis is less than that of his near contemporary, Ibn Ezra. Ibn Ezra's reflections on astrology and its relationship with the Jewish creed are more coherent, continuous, and deeper than those of his predeces-sor. With Ibn Ezra, astrology was part of a coherent system of thought that, even if expressed in a diffuse and fragmentary manner, is found in the entire corpus of his many-sided religious, scientific, and astrological works. Astrol-ogy was for him a way of religious knowledge insofar as it reveals God's ways of action in the world (commentaries on Deut 6:7, Deut 32:39, and Exod 20:1). From the point of view of language, differences also appear in the texts of the three writers. Bar Hiyya is very clear in his exposition. His tech-nical vocabulary relies on terms of Arabic origin, most of them translations or transliterations into Hebrew. In contrast, Ibn Ezra's writing is brief and obscure, and he often envelops his words in a mysterious and religious at-mosphere. This cryptic and elusive treatment of such a subject must have made his texts very attractive to a certain kind of reader. With respect to technical terms, he carefully chose words that already existed in the Torah, giving them a new meaning, and he avoided the use of foreign words. This procedure is consistent with his idea that all the sciences—astronomy and astrology included—were once the original patrimony of Israel and are al-luded to in the text of the Torah.21 None of these writers contested the scientific status of astrology, the elements involved in its practice (aspects, cycles, mundane astrology, etc.), or the legitimacy of applying astrology to the interpretation of biblical facts, which are fundamental in the history of the Jewish people. 21 On the choice of biblical words for astronomical technical terms in Ibn Ezra's writings, see Sela 1999, 209-219 and 2003, 104-106, as well as his articles in Micrologus (2001) and Arabic Sciences and Philosophy (2001).

DARREL RUTKIN Astrology was still a vital and vibrant part of the European cultural fabric during the first thirty years of the seventeenth century, reaching perhaps its fullest development within the realm of legitimate natural knowledge as well as in socio-political and cultural domains. This was the last period in which the finest natural philosophers and mathematician-astronomers practiced and theorized about—and tried to reform—astrology's natural philosophical, mathematical and astronomical foundations. To be sure, the reform move-ment continued for another century or so, but the scientific dimension of the tide had already turned, at least as it appears to us in retrospect. This paper seeks to indicate some of astrology's personal, scientific and political appli-cations at this high-water mark by exploring a range of uses to which horo-scopes could be put.1 From 1600 to 1630 many people studied and practiced astrology, em-ploying it over a broad range of the socio-political and cultural spectrum for personal, political and patronage-related purposes, among others. To illus-trate and evoke this range of practices, I will present a series of portraits in various landscapes, primarily in Italy, England and the Holy Roman Empire. Most of the dramatis personae will be familiar to all: Johannes Kepler, Gali-leo Galilei, Francis Bacon. Others—Tommaso Campanella, Orazio Morandi, Andrea Argoli—are less so. Of course, astrology was also alive and well in Louis XIII's France, as we can easily see in the striking image of the court astrologer, Jean-Baptiste Morin, attentively waiting, concealed in the royal apartment, to record the precise moment of the dauphin, the future Louis XIV's birth and thus to construct his horoscope (Thorndike 1923-1958, VII: 479).2 In examining various uses of horoscopes during this period, I will ex-plore three primary themes. First, the horoscopes will be identified within the 1 Astrology did not reach its fullest expression in politics until c. 1640-1660 during the civil wars and interregnum in England.

Darrel Rutkin four types of astrological praxis, namely, revolutions, nativities, elections, and interrogations. Revolutions are concerned with large-scale changes, pri-marily of the weather, but also in political affairs. Nativities, on the other hand, study the astrological configuration at a person's birth. Elections de-termine the most propitious moment to begin an enterprise or perform an activity, such as crowning a ruler, passing the baton of command to a general, or laying the cornerstone of an important building. Interrogations, finally, address questions on any matter of concern, including personal, medical and business-related issues. In this case, horoscopes are constructed for the time the question is asked.3 Second, these astrological practices will be situated within their socio-political and patronage contexts, which often decisively shaped how the ho-roscopes in question were used. For example, Kepler and Galileo both used central features of their patrons' natal horoscopes—their nativities or geni-tures—as primary motifs in the dedicatory letters of their respectively epoch-making Astronomia Nova (1609) and Sidereus Nuncius (1610).4 Finally, our protagonists' horoscope usage will be considered in relation to their views on astrological reform, especially for Kepler, Galileo, and Bacon.5 I begin with a brief sketch of Johannes Kepler, whose astrological works are fairly well known, beginning to flesh out a typology of uses within various relevant contexts. Then I provide more extensive portraits of Galileo and Francis Bacon, whose astrological practices and reforms are less well known. Finally, I treat Campanella, Morandi and Argoli in Urban VIII's Rome in relation to one of the most politically charged of astrological prac-tices, predicting the pope's death. 1. Johannes Kepler My first astrologer in a landscape is Johannes Kepler, who used horoscopes in a range of practices over his entire career, from his student days in Tübin-gen until his death in 1630.6 Educated—as was Tycho Brahe—within Philip Melanchthon's deeply astrological reformed educational system, Kepler learned various features of astrological theory and practice within the mathe-matics and natural philosophy courses while also learning the basic structures 3 Keith Thomas's chapters on astrology (1971, 283-385) are probably still the best introduction to the subject in English.

In the personal domain, Kepler used natal astrology to ana-lyze and understand himself and the most important members of his family, including his parents, for whom we have nativities with an astrological inter-pretation of their characters (Caspar 1993, 34). Likewise, for understanding himself, Kepler constructed his own nativity, and, for every year of his life, he made a revolution horoscope for that year (many of which are still extant) to help him better understand the year to come (Caspar 1993, 357 [and note l]).8 These horoscopes were not published at the time, thus further indicating that he made them only for his own personal interest. Moving from the personal and private9 to the more public professional and political domains, a context deeply conditioned by patronage demands, Kepler also used a range of horoscopes. In addition to constructing natal horoscopes of patrons and major political figures, Kepler made horoscopes normally called \"revolutions of the year.\" On this basis he composed annual prognostications, published mostly in German, as a component of the calen-dars he was required to compile from 1595, when he was appointed district mathematician at Graz (Caspar 1993, 58-60). But these practices were also the subject of his own strong views on how astrological theory and practice should be reformed, as he informs us in several works, including the Latin De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus (\"On the More Certain Fundaments of Astrology,\" 1602), published just after he became imperial mathematician in 1601.10 It also included a reformed prognostication focused primarily on the weather, but also treating public health and politics. He continued these prac-tices throughout his career. Unlike normal revolutions of the year, however, Kepler rejected the construction and interpretation of horoscopes for the sun's annual ingress into Aries, the beginning of the astrological year, or its entrance into the other seasons. In Kepler's view there is no natural substrate for the weather as there is for nativities, namely, the human soul, which is imprinted at the moment of birth with enduring astrological influences. For this reason, Kepler's re-formed horoscopes for his annual prognostications focused on important planetary configurations during the course of the year, including their astro-7 For Melanchthon's educational reforms, see Kusukawa 1995 and chapter five of Rutkin (forthcoming). 8 One should compare Kepler's practice with Girolamo Cardano's intense self scru-tiny in the sixteenth century; see Grafton 1999.

Darrel Rutkin logically significant angular relations, the planetary aspects, which are then interpreted to illuminate the traditional themes of annual astrological prog-nostications.11 As imperial mathematician, Kepler also provided private astrologi-cally-informed political counsel for Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, at court in Prague until Rudolfs forced abdication in 1611. Although Kepler never described his personal interviews with the emperor, some of the essays writ-ten for him survive, in which Kepler gave Rudolf advice about Venice, the Hungarian question, and the Turk, among other pressing issues (Caspar 1993, 152f.; see also Bauer 1989). Likewise, Kepler provided astrological services for many important persons, including the Chancellor of Bavaria, Herwart von Hohenberg, and the famous general, Count Wallenstein, whose nativity Kepler constructed and interpreted in 1608 and again in 1624. Kepler looked into Wallenstein's future by means of directions of his natal horo-scope, an astrological technique Kepler saw no reason to reform. These horo-scopes and their interpretations are still extant (Caspar 1993, 338-345). Kepler also made other horoscopes for political and patronage purposes, in-cluding horoscopes of historical figures, for example, Augustus Caesar and the prophet Muhammad, and even for the creation of the world (Caspar 1993, 89f.; see also Grafton 1991). Tycho Brahe likewise made nativities for the king of Denmark as well as annual prognostications (Christianson 1979 and Oestmann 2003). In addition to practicing astrology, Tycho and Kepler were both pas-sionately interested in reforming and improving both sciences of the stars, astronomy and astrology—Tycho by reforming astronomy's observational and cosmological foundations and astrology's mundane house structure (North 1986, 175-177 and vanden Broecke 2003, 263-269; in general, see Thoren 1990). Kepler's astronomical and astrological reforms were even more fundamental, including his rejecting the signs of the zodiac as astro-logically significant, and thus planetary rulerships and all associated doctrine, except elemental triplicities, which played such a large part in prognostica-tions based on the Great Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter. According to Kepler, elemental triplicities could be retained because they had a natural foundation, namely, the twenty year cycle of Great Conjunctions. Saturn and Jupiter conjoined in the same triplicity—namely, all three signs of the same element—in an interlocking series of triangles (trine aspects) for 240 years before switching to the next element (Field 1984, 199-201). In this respect as in others, he retained the powers of the planets and the importance of their 11 Kepler describes his theory and exemplifies its practice in thesis XLIX of the De certioribus.

Galileo Galilei Galileo's use of horoscopes presents a different profile.14 Although an astro-logical practitioner during a significant portion of his career, Galileo seems to have had no interest in astrological reform. A further contrast is that Kepler used horoscopes in a much more overtly political manner, as both a political counselor and public prognosticator, but for Galileo there is no evidence of either practice. Indeed, Galileo mainly made nativities for personal, profes-sional, and patronage-related reasons, and he employed the full panoply of technical astrological features for constructing and interpreting horoscopes. Galileo's two main domains of astrological practice were the personal and the professional. Most of our evidence for Galileo's personal use of horo-scopes comes from the time he taught mathematics at the University of Padua (1592-1610). Our main evidence is MS Galileiana 81 at the Biblioteca Nazi-onale Centrale in Florence, which contains twenty five horoscopes in his own hand, including his own and his two now famous daughters'.15 Indeed, we even possess his astrological interpretation of his daughters' horoscopes, where he discussed their mental and moral makeup. There is also rich evidence for Galileo's use of horoscopes within pro-fessional and patronage contexts, which will be treated more fully. Although Galileo's astrological practice was not overtly political, it was certainly per-formed in a patronage context, for which we will first turn to Florence and the milieu of Cosimo II de' Medici, to whom Galileo famously dedicated his epoch-making telescopic discoveries in the Sidereus Nuncius (1610; see Bi-agioli 1993 and Rutkin 2001). It is well known that Galileo personalized his discovery of Jupiter's moons to Cosimo in the dedicatory letter by relating them to Jupiter's exalted position in Cosimo's natal horoscope. Indeed, we find Galileo's rendering of Cosimo's horoscope in two versions on the back of his wash drawings of the moon.16 13 For useful discussions of Kepler's reforms, see Simon 1979, Field 1984, and Ste-phenson 1994. His astronomical reforms are too well known to require discussion here; see e.g. Caspar 1993. 14 For a fuller treatment of all these issues, incidents, and characters (plus others), see Rutkin 2005. I know of two other surveys of Galileo's astrological practice, Favaro 1881 and Kollerstrom 2001. See also Culture and Cosmos 7 (2004), entitled Gali-leo 's Astrology, which is devoted to this topic. 15 For his own horoscope, see now Swerdlow 2004. 16 Righini (1976) describes the two horoscopes that survive, but only publishes the one corresponding to the dedication.

Darrel Rutkin Another important patronage-related use of horoscopes was for Co-simo's parents the previous year. At the very beginning of 1609, the Grand Duke Ferdinand, Cristina's husband and Cosimo's father, was gravely ill. We have Galileo's response to Grand Duchess Cristina's urgent request for him to establish the accurate date of the grand duke's birth—between the two competing dates, a year apart—so that an accurate horoscope for the grand duke could be constructed and, thus, a fully accurate understanding of his malady astrologically discovered. Galileo used the technique of rectification, deciding on the earlier date based on its better astrological correspondence with the events (accidents) of the grand duke's life (Galilei 1890-1909, X: 226f.).17 Galileo's correspondence provides further evidence for his use of horoscopes in a patronage context. A splendid example is Cardinal Alessan-dro d'Este's request of Galileo to construct and interpret his nativity—in 1618—in recompense for which the good cardinal offered to help Galileo any way he could, forever, in any matter. Although we apparently do not possess this horoscope, it is extremely unlikely that Galileo would have refused such a request from the Este cardinal.18 Although the use of horoscopes for patronage purposes could occa-sionally be spectacularly successful (as with the Sidereus Nuncius), con-structing and interpreting horoscopes even in a purely professional context could sometimes be fraught with danger. Antonino Poppi (1993) recently discovered some interesting documents related to Galileo's little known early brush with the Venetian Inquisition. We learn that Galileo had been de-nounced to the Inquisition in Padua in 1604 for practicing a deterministic astrology; that he was denounced by his former amanuensis, Silvestro Pagnoni (from Pesaro), who had lived in Galileo's house for eighteen months;19 and that the authorities in Venice reviewed and summarily dis-missed the charges.20 Most interesting is the light the accuser's testimony throws on Galileo's practice of astrology in the earliest years of the seven-teenth century, while he was professor of mathematics at Padua, and during the very time he drew up the horoscopes in MS 81. The value in Pagnoni's testimony comes from his being an eye-witness who actually lived in Gali-leo's house. We learn that Galileo drew up natal horoscopes for a variety of people. I quote from Pagnoni's official denunciation:21 17 Letter 204, Galileo to Cristina di Lorena in Florence, Padua, 16 Jan 1609. 18 Biagioli (1993, 43) refers to this letter in a discussion of gift giving. 19 This is Poppi's very probable conjecture (1993, 19 f.). 20 This is recorded in document VI: \"II governo veneziano valuta l'inconsistenza delle denunce contro Cremonini e Galilei\" (1993, 55f.).

He made one judgment on one nativity, where he said that the person had twenty more years to live, and he held it as firm and indubitable that that judgment would follow. He spoke one day with a gentleman from beyond the Alps, a German, named Giovanni Svainim, for whom he had made a nativ-ity [...]. There are two points to be made here. First, no one is disputing that Galileo had an astrological practice, which in the early seventeenth century was still considered a normal professional activity for a mathematicus. At issue is only whether Galileo practiced a problematic deterministic astrology. The other point is that this evidence, which clearly indicates that Galileo had an office in Padua where he constructed and interpreted horoscopes, can then be used to flesh out evidence from one of Galileo's notebooks which recorded money he received in various contexts, but primarily for private teaching and for supplying instruments (Favaro 1883, II, 147ff.).22 In addition to payments received for lectures on De sphera, mechanics, perspective and fortification, there are also five notices for payments received per sortem, one of which is dated January 1, 1603: dall 'illustre signor Sweinitz per sortem, for which Galileo received 60 Venetian lire. This is the same person mentioned in Pagnoni's accusation of the following year. Two others are recorded together for October 22, 1603: Sig. Massimiliano in nome dei signori Cristoforo e Marco Stettner per sortes (153). The horoscope for Christoforo Stettner ex-ists in MS 81 (f. 36). 3. Francis Bacon Galileo is also indirectly implicated in the political use of horoscopes con-ducted by Orazio Morandi's astrological political research institute at Rome during the 1620s, but we should first head over to London to explore Francis Bacon's proposal for astrological reform, with its own striking political im-plications, as found in his De augmentis scientiarum, the 1623 Latinized ex-pansion of his Advancement of Learning (1605). Indeed, Bacon composed it in the immediate aftermath of his impeachment as England's Lord High Chancellor, which directly constellates his proposal within a highly charged public political context at the highest levels, in which he himself had until recently been an active participant (Marwil 1976; Jardine and Stewart 1999). But, like Galileo soon after, he had precipitously fallen out of favor at court. 3 22 Poppi discusses this in detail (1993, 56f. [n. 3]). 23 Biagioli's chapter on the fall of the courtier is illuminating on this topic (1993).

Darrel Rutkin Although I know of no evidence for Bacon's practice of astrology, his pro-posal, which is wholly an addition to the Advancement of Learning, sheds light on his very interesting views, in which, like Kepler, he tried to ground astrological practice on a sound natural foundation.2 Thus he promoted the reform, not rejection, of astrology in relation to his areas of greatest concern, natural knowledge and politics. Bacon proposed a reform of astrological theory and practice in Book III, Chapter 4 of the De augmentis scientiarum (Bacon 1963, I: 554-560). Discussing astrology as a part of natural philosophy, Bacon hopes to reform astrology as an astrologia sana based explicitly on physical principles. He begins by indicating the superstitions and lies to be removed from astrology, including the individual planetary rulership of each hour of the day, and the astrological figure constructed for precise points of time. Bacon then dis-cusses what parts of astrology should be retained. He begins by noting that unlike nativities, elections and interrogations, which he previously said have little if any foundation, revolutions have much more soundness (sanitas). We will recall that these are the four primary divisions of astrological praxis, with revolutions concerned with large-scale changes, primarily of the weather, but also state affairs. Revolutions are the primary feature of annual prognostications. To make revolutions optimal in practice, Bacon prescribes five gen-eral rules, including that every operation of the heavens extends more to the mass of things than to individuals, and that no operation of the heavens flows down into and rules points of time or precise minutes, only larger spaces of time. In describing the basic elements of his reformed astrology, Bacon also retains the normal doctrine of astrological aspects, and the traditional natures and inclinations of the planets and fixed stars, which he thought should not be lightly rejected because of the tradition's great agreement. On this reformed basis, he concludes, figures of the heavens, horoscopes, should be con-structed and interpreted. What, then, can Bacon's reformed astrology reasonably predict? Gi-ven that these are his considered views after a lifetime as courtier and politi-cian, the implications for his actual practice of astrology (or for the use of skilled astrologers in his employ) are striking. I present this section in the 1640 English translation, interspersed with comments and glosses (Bacon 1640). He begins with a brief introduction: \"Sound Astrologie is likewise applied and referred with more confidence to Predictions; to Elections, with more Caution, within due limits to both.\" First, predictions: Predictions may be made of future Comets, which as we conjecture may be foretold; and of all sorts of Meteors; of Deluges, Draughts; Heats; Conglaciations; Earth-quakes; ore flowing of waters; breaking out of Fires; Windes; great Raines; divers Tempests; and strange seasons 24 For a discussion of Bacon's astrological reform and its influence, see Bowden 1975.

(153) According to Bacon, astrology may be used to make predictions related to many vital natural and political concerns, the normal subjects of annual prog-nostications. He next discusses how specific such predictions can be: [S]o these predictions may be drawn downe [deduced] (though not with like certainty) to more speciall occurrences, and perchance to singularities; if the generali inclinations of such times and seasons, being first discovered and found out, these be applied by a sharpe piercing judgment Philosophicall or Politicall, to speciall or more particular events, which may be most subject to such Accidents. As for example, a man shall found out from aforesight of the seasons of the yeare, such temperatures of weather, as are propitious or pernitious rather to Olives, than to Vines [...]. Or if one from the knowledge he hath of the influence, the Heav-ens have over the spirits of men, should find out a man to be of such a complexion and dis-position; to affect or distast rather the people then Princes; rather learned and curious, than couragious and warlike dispositions; rather sensuall and voluptuous, than active and politique nature. Such instances as these are infinite, but (as we have said) they require not only that generali knowledge, taken from the starres, which are Active; but also a particular knowledge of Subjects which are Passive. (153f.) Bacon ends this section with two important points: one, that the domain in which astrological predictions may be applied is virtually infinite, and two, that a knowledge of the celestial configuration (the active causes) alone does not suffice, following Ptolemy (Ptolemy 1940, I, 2f.). One must also have a deep knowledge of the subjects at issue, the recipients of the active planetary influences. This knowledge seems to be precisely what his broader scientific research program was intended to produce. He also states explicitly that these astrological predictions concern not only generalities, but also specific cir-cumstances and individuals, albeit with less certainty. Let us now turn to Bacon's views on elections, which are concerned with choosing the most propitious times to begin any sort of venture: Nor are Elections altogether to be rejected but more sparingly to be credited, than Predic-tions. For we see in Planting and in Sowing and in Grafting, that the observation of the [phase] of the Moone is a matter, not altogether vaine and frivolous. But these Elections, are by our rules more restrained than Predictions: and this must ever be observed, that Elections are of force, in such cases alone, where both the Influxe of the Heavens is such, as doth not sodainly passe over; and likewise the Action of Inferior Bodies such, as is not presently per-fected: for neither the Encreases of the Moone, nor of the Planets are accomplisht in an in-stant: but Punctuality of time, is by all means to be rejected. There are found many of the like precise observations (which one would hardly believe) in Elections about Civile affaires. (154) Bacon thus plainly states that there are significant realms in which astrologi-cal elections may legitimately be applied within the framework of a sound astrology. He also strongly implies his own personal experience with elec-Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"176 Η. Darrel Rutkin tions concerning political affairs, which could also be construed as an adver-tisement for his expertise and thus for his services. In this respect, the De augmentis scientiarum may be profitably compared with his distant compa-triot Roger Bacon's similar appeal for patronage in his three Opera during the 1260s, which also offered astrologically informed knowledge and ser-vices at the highest levels of politics and patronage.25 In the final section, Bacon responds to a hypothetical challenge by in-dicating how a multifaceted research program should be instituted to clarify and develop the claims made in the preceding discussion. He is most inter-ested in a historically oriented program: Astrologians (if they be not wanting to their Profession) may make a collection from the faithfull reports of History, of all greater contingences; as Inundations, Pestilences, Warres; Seditions; and (if the state so require) the deaths of Kings: and may contemplate the situation of the Heavens, not according to the subtletie of Figures; but according to those general rules which we have already set downe; to know in what postures the Heavens were, at those times, when such effects came to passe; that so [where] there is a cleere, and evident consent, and concurrence of events; there a probable rule of Prediction may be inferred. (154f.) Bacon here suggests an empirically-based inductively-structured historical research program to investigate precisely those topics which he had just men-tioned as legitimate subjects of astrological prediction and election. Thus Bacon retains two of the four types of astrological praxis, revolutions and elections, although he rejects a formerly fundamental feature of horoscopes, namely, their being made for precise moments of time. The De augmentis scientiarum's astrological reform of 1623 is Ba-con's mature statement; there is nothing like it in the Advancement of Learn-ing. Given the tenor of his statements, his ever precarious situation at court, and his passionate political ambitions, it seems very likely that he would have pursued this avenue of possible insight—and thus advantage—in the many areas in which he himself actively participated. It also seems likely that he would have at least ventured his own historical investigation of these matters so clearly and forcefully advocated. For Kepler (and Tycho), then, we have discussions of astrological theory and practice, including their ideas for astrological reform. For Galileo, the only evidence we have concerns his practice. For Bacon, in contrast, we only have a theoretical discussion which is deeply concerned with reform. Although there are strong implications of practice, no such evidence has yet been found. 25 See David C. Lindberg's biography of Roger Bacon in Lindberg 1983.

Astrology in Urban VIII's Rome Our last examples of highly politically-charged horoscope usage require us to return to Italy later in the 1620s, to Rome in fact, in order to observe a very dramatic—and curious—set of incidents surrounding Pope Urban VIII and the expected timing of his demise. Indeed, Urban himself was quite interested in astrology, to such an extent that he was in the peculiar habit of casting the horoscopes of cardinals resident in Rome, and of predicting their deaths. But by 1626, Urban had himself become the target of such predictions, which became increasingly persistent by 1628. These rumors were apparently being stirred up by pro-Spanish factions who were trying to scare the pope to death. The two most dangerous years were 1628, when there was an eclipse of the moon in January and of the sun in December, and 1630, with a solar eclipse in June (Walker 1958, 205f.). During this time, the philosopher, prophet, and currently-imprisoned heretic Tommaso Campanella's reputation came to the pope's attention in relation to these menacing predictions of maleficent celestial influences (Ernst 1991, 263ff.). Not wanting to sit idly by, Urban transferred Campan-ella to prison in Rome and ultimately released him to implement a Ficinian program of prophylactic astrological magic. He formulated it in late 1626 soon after arriving in Rome; it was later published in an unauthorized edition as the De fato siderali vitando.26 Here is a scene from D. P. Walker's classic description: First they sealed the room against outside air, sprinkled it with rose-vinegar and other aro-matic substances, and burnt laurel, myrtle, rosemary and cypress. They hung the room with white silken cloths and decorated it with branches. Then two candles and five torches were lit, representing the seven planets; since the heavens, owing to the eclipse, were defective, these were to provide an undefective substitute, as one lights a lamp when the sun sets. (207) It seems likely that Campanella developed his apotropaic astrological magic for precisely this important occasion, since there is no evidence for anything like it before in his writings (Walker 1958, 209). During the summer of 1628, both the Florentine and the Venetian ambassadors reported on the frequent secret meetings between Urban and Campanella (Walker 1958, 206; see also Headley 1997, 108). When the pope's brother Carlo died in Feb 1630, Urban was relieved to think that the malign influence intended for him had instead expended itself on his brother (Ernst 1991, 266). The pope had Campanella assist him once more in 1630 to protect his nephew (Walker 1958, 209). 26 For an evocative account of Campanella's procedure, see Walker 1958, 206-208.

Darrel Rutkin It was into this context that Galileo arrived in Rome in May 1630 with his completed manuscript of the Dialogo to secure its imprimatur and publi-cation.27 Upon arrival, Galileo was invited to dine with his old friend, Orazio Morandi, abbot of the Vallambrosan monastery, Santa Prassede.28 Unbe-knownst to Galileo, however, and just before he arrived in Rome, Morandi had published in newssheets astrological prognostications of Pope Urban's and his nephew's deaths. Furthermore, after Galileo's arrival in Rome, but before dinner with Morandi on the 24th, Galileo himself somehow became associated with these predictions. I quote from a passage in a contemporary Roman avviso of 18 May 1630: Galileo, the famous mathematician and astrologer, is here [in Rome] to try to publish a book in which he attacks many opinions held by the Jesuits. He has been understood to say that Dfonna] Anna [that is, Anna Colonna, the wife of Taddeo Barberini, the pope's nephew] will give birth to a son, that we shall have peace in Italy at the end of June, and that shortly there-after Taddeo and the pope will die. This last point is confirmed by the Neapolitan Caracioli, by Father Campanella and by several writings that discuss the election of the new Pontiff as if the Holy See were already vacant.29 Galileo was so concerned about these rumors that he had his friend Michael-angelo Buonarroti (the painter's nephew) inquire directly of the papal nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, how these rumors were perceived by those who matter, and to explain that he was innocent of any astrological foul play. Galileo was relieved to find out in early June that the cardinal did not believe these rumors for a moment (see esp. letters 2022 and 2030). Galileo left Rome 26 June 1630. Soon after, in mid-July, Morandi was summoned to the Holy Office and thrown into prison. Galileo, greatly con-cerned, requested information from a mutual friend. He was informed that the Morandi case was very big. Many people were involved, and information related to it was tightly controlled. Apparently Santa Prassede had been an important center for producing astrological information on the major political figures of the day—a sort of astrological political research institute. Indeed, dozens of nativities were discovered when the church was searched after Morandi's arrest (Ernst 1991, 267f.). There were horoscopes of popes and cardinals; and the cardinals who were most likely to become pope had judg-ments drawn up on their nativities, thus indicating their respective astrologi-cal strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, Galileo's and Campanula's horoscopes were also found in this cache (Fiorani 1978, 104). Further, Raf-faelo Visconti reported during the course of Morandi's trial that he, Morandi, 27 Most of this story is well known and requires no retelling here. See e.g. Westfall 1989 andBiagioli 1993, 313-352. 28 For Morandi and this episode, see Shea 1983; Ernst 1991, 265-271, and 1993; Fio-rani 1978; and Bertollotti 1878.

Over 2800 folios of evi-dence relating to this case are extant at the Archivio di Stato in Rome, includ-ing the cache of horoscopes, many letters, a catalogue of the library at Santa Prassede and depositions from the trial.30 As an aftermath to the Morandi case, Urban promulgated the papal bull Inscrutabilis against astrology in April 1631, which basically repeated the content of Sixtus V's similar bull of 1586.31 Although Urban's bull was directed against astrology overall and its practitioners, it was mainly con-cerned with those who predicted the death of the pope and his kin to the third degree of consanguinity, as we saw was the case with Morandi's prediction. By the way, Morandi died in prison later in 1630; poison was widely rumored to be the cause (Ernst 1991, 270). There is rich evidence here for a fully tex-tured study of this extremely interesting and extensively documented episode which still very much remains to be done. As noted, among the 2800 folios of evidence were dozens of horo-scopes. We also find an extensive collection of horoscopes of the powerful in a medical textbook with political overtones composed by a frequenter of Morandi's library at Santa Prassede, Andrea Argoli, who later became pro-fessor of mathematics at the University of Padua (Ernst 1993, 240).33 Indeed, Morandi favorably reviewed the first edition of Argoli's extremely influential ephemerides—with an extensive astrological introduction—for its official Roman imprimatur in 1628 (see Rutkin 2003, 230). We shall cast a brief and parting glance at Argoli's textbook, the De criticis diebus: first edition, 1639; second edition, 16 52.34 The structure of the horoscope collections in each edition is the same, namely, there are two horo-scopes for each individual: first, a nativity, the astrological configuration at birth; the other is for the onset of the final sickness which led to death. We have, then, an extensive medico-astrological casebook (significantly aug-mented in its second edition) for investigating the death of important people, including popes, cardinals and kings, a highly illegal activity, but one of pas-sionate interest in this intensely competitive culture. Indeed, with this horo-scope collection we possess the raw material for a historical research program—ä la Bacon—which even, ironically, included Urban VIII's horo-30 See especially Ernst 1993 for a rich discussion of Morandi and his library, with a transcription of its contents from the trial records. 31 For these bulls, see now Germana Ernst's informative introduction and the texts in Campanella 2003. 32 Dooley's recent book-length study (2002) is disappointing in that he does not suffi-ciently rely on the extensive evidence for his account. 33 For more on Argoli, see his biography by M.

Conclusion We have now surveyed a small sample of the many and varied uses of horo-scopes in the early modern culture-historical landscape. We found mainly nativities and revolutions, to be sure, but also elections within various rele-vant contexts, personal, political and patronage related, among others. We found no interrogations among the horoscopes surveyed, but they were cer-tainly still practiced. We also examined certain features of astrological re-form. There is much more work to be done, of discovery, analysis, and integration, before we will fully understand the complex roles astrology play-ed in early modern Europe during this period of profound and multifold transformation.

On 20 July 1492 Ludovico il Moro, then the acting duke of Milan, wrote to his most promi-nent court astrologer to make inquiries regarding the health of Innocent VIII, a Genoese pope unsympathetic to the Milanese Duchy. Ludovico wrote to his personal astrologer Ambrogio Varesi da Rosate asking him to foretell if the Pope's illness would result in death or not. For want of a nativity chart (genitura), Varesi cast a horoscope for the time of the inquiry, and reported to Ludovico that the position of the planets in the sky indicated that Innocent VIII was likely to die either on August 3, or sometime between August 10 and ll.1 I wish to thank H.

(with some minor differences in the transcription of the original). Gabotto interprets the astrological prognostication as having been re-quested by the Pope himself. Given the often tense relationship between Milan and the Papacy, the delicate nature of astrological prognostications of this kind, and the reference to the fact that Varesi could not draw the nativity chart of the Pope (and thus did not have essential information for the accurate prognostication of his death) it is obvious that what Ascanio and Ludovico were doing was to probe the stars in the hope of anticipating the Pope's death, a highly illicit practice. For the more fa-mous case of the prognostication of Pope Urban VIII's death, and the trial that en-sued, see Dooley 2002. As is well known, in 1631 Urban VIII issued a long bull against astrological prediction later published under the title Inscrutabilis.

Such stories reveal a worldview in many ways alien to our own, and reveal much more besides.4 They show how in the Renaissance politics was played at various levels, not only by making alliances and strengthening diplomatic ties, but also by using predictive arts such as judicial astrology (of which horary astrology was one mode of practice), which were believed to rest on sound 'scientific' princi-ples.5 Among other things, therefore, this account is a story of the role of as-trology in fifteenth-century political life. Varesi's interrogation reveals how horary astrology was skillfully exploited in political circles and suggests that, far from being irrelevant to our understanding of Renaissance Italy, astrology played an important role in shaping its history. This paper explores some of the ways astrology played a political role in the lives of early modern elites. Judicial astrology was not the only branch of astrology employed to investigate somebody's health by studying the position of the stars and the planets in the heavens. Different competing astrological practices intersected in the Renaissance, all of which were employed to varying degrees in fif-teenth-century Italy. The link between medicine and astrology had been es-tablished in classical times, and physicians since had relied on medical Cancro, quale e ascendente de la Reverendissima Signoria Vostra, e che in la revolutione de Ii anni del mundo el medesimo Cancro era in mezo del celo, che e la casa regia; le quale due cose portendeno felicita alia Reverendissima Signoria Vostra in questa creatione. Ε vero che ne l'hora de la interrogatione mia dice che Saturno era in aspecti col significatore de la Reverendissima Signoria Vostra; la quale cosa fa che si possa dubitare che la Signoria vostra possa essere offesa ο per avaricia ο per infedeltä.

Ludovico's letter is quoted at p. 376. 4 On the long durie of astrology as a body of knowledge, and qualifications as to its relevance in contemporary society, see the perceptive remarks of Anthony Grafton in Grafton 2000, 70-83. 5 Judicial astrology comprised natal, horary, and electional astrology. Natal astrology included the practice of 'annual revolutions' in which the astrologer calculated the client's prospects for the coming year on the basis of their birth chart; see Thomas 1973, 338f. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance there was considerable confu-sion between interrogations and elections. The two were originally interrelated but distinct practices. Interrogations were used to determine the outcome of specific questions in terms of a figure (horoscope) drawn up for the moment when the ques-tion was formulated. Elections, on the other hand, studied the planetary positions in order to establish the most suitable time for beginning an activity. See Page 2002, 30-35, and Burnett 1996, 369-382, esp. 375f.

Although not all rulers and doctors embraced the practice of astrology uncritically or to the same degree, the existence of contemporary critiques of astrological practice and medical astrology does not seem to have convinced many physicians and their patients to reject medical astrology.7 This essay seeks to explore the way in which Renaissance elites relied upon astrological prognostication in matters of health. In doing so, it seeks to illuminate the role of medical astrology within the private and political spheres of Italian Renaissance courts, and put renewed emphasis on the vitality and importance of this tradition. My analysis will concentrate on the practice of astrological medicine among one of the most important fifteenth-century European political elites: the Sforzas. I will approach this question within the context of ideas concern-ing the relationship between the stars and the human body that had emerged in the period 1200-1500. In attempting to explore this complex topic, I will first offer a concise overview of the major tenets of medical astrology and a brief outline of some of its key texts. I will then investigate this tradition by comparing university learning and court culture in Renaissance Milan. This comparison will reveal similarities and continuities between the university curriculum and the theoretical body of knowledge in the possession of the court physician-astrologer. I will then conclude my essay with a case study of 6 The first important ancient author to draw attention to the analogies between medi-cine and astrology was Ptolemy: in representing astrology as a stochastic techne, that is, an art which had carefully developed rules of conjecture, he said that it was like medicine. See Ptolomy 1940,1.2, especially pp. 13-19. 7 As Anthony Grafton and Nancy Siraisi warn, generalizations about medical astrol-ogy in the Renaissance are hazardous. See Grafton and Siraisi 2001, 110. Only fur-ther research on court astrology will be able to establish to what extent the Italian elites and their doctors relied on medical astrology. The fact that in the late fifteenth century there were a number of authors who openly contested the reliability of medical astrology seem to suggest that medical astrology was reasonably popular. This seems also testified by the rich manuscript and printed tradition. The most powerful critique of medical astrology was arguably that of Pico della Mirandola in his Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem, first published in 1496, which dedicated a number of chapters to the topic. See Pico della Mirandola 1946, espe-cially pp. 322-363. The debate generated by Pico's work certainly contributed to the renewal of medical astrology and engendered debate over the Galenic theory of the critical days. In relation to Pico, see Bellanti 1498, quest. 14, art. IV (An critici dies a luna sint). For an example of later debates see Fracastoro 1538 and Turini 1542. Turini was the archiatra of Pope Paul III. See also Steven vanden Broecke's essay in this volume for two seventeenth-century examples: Giovanni Antonio Magini and Andrea Argoli.

But before discussing the specific case of Milan, I will provide a general overview of the classical and medieval background to Renaissance medical astrology. 1. The Long Life of Medical Astrology The literature on medical astrology has a venerable tradition that cannot be fully explored in the space of a short essay.8 This medical literature formed part of the flowering of astrology in Renaissance Italy more generally, and has been transmitted down to us in hundreds of different manuscripts and printed sources. The basic principle behind medical astrology was that the stars and planets exerted a noticeable influence on everything on earth, in-cluding plants and stones (Grant 1987; North 1987). A corollary to this the-ory was the principle that each part of the human body was influenced by a different sign of the zodiac and that each of the 'openings' of the body were influenced by one of the planets (Burnett 1996, 376). This theory was often visualized in medieval and Renaissance texts through drawings such as the \"zodiac man\" and the \"microcosmic man.\"9 Theories of influence were par-ticularly significant for the practice of phlebotomy as well as surgery, and could be extended to the administration of medicaments. As medication was composed of herbs and minerals, the relative influence of the signs of the zodiac and the planets on the medication's ingredients was another factor for the physician to consider when administering the treatment. 8 To the best of my knowledge there are no studies in English that address systemati-cally the genre of medical astrology. Although single texts, or groups of texts, have been studied to some degree, medical historians have paid relatively little attention to this genre, and both the manuscript and printed traditions of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance still await a major study. For illuminating studies on specific aspects of the topic (largely restricted to England), see Mooney 1984; Carey 1994; French 1994; French 1996; O'Boyle 1991; Grafton and Siraisi 2001. Ficino's De vita lihri tres is arguably one of the most significant works of medical astrology of the Italian Renaissance. The literature in German is more extensive. See Weisser 1981; Weisser 1982; Müller-Jahncke 1985; Schadewaldt 1988; Welker 1988. 9 A survey of the iconographic tradition goes beyond the scope of this study. For a very popular example of a zodiac man, see Ketham 1491. The vernacular edition of Sebastiano Manilio is printed in Ketham 1493. For an example of microcosmic man see Page 2002, 52.

Because it was related to predictable cycles and cohered with the main tenets of astronomy, natural philosophy, and humoral theory, the theory of critical days proved particularly popular, and as such can be traced in medical and non-medical writings alike. As a specific genre of medical writing, the literature on critical days can be further subdivided into two categories: one includes texts that are solely devoted to the theory of critical days; the other comprises texts where the authors embrace elements of this theory in their treatment of specific ill-nesses. As a classical example of the first category, one can mention the nu-merous commentaries or texts based closely on Galen's De diebus criticis, one of the most important and popular texts of medical astrology. Pertaining to the second category, one can look, for instance, at the numerous treatises on fevers that employ the theory of critical days in prognostication, as well as medieval and Renaissance commentaries on Hippocrates's Prognostica, ps-Hippocrates's De medicorum astrologia, and some of the aphorisms included in ps-Ptolemy's Centiloquium.11 In addition to the transmission of these texts from classical antiquity, the Middle Ages inherited a rich tradition of Arabic and Jewish medicine that incorporated the theories of critical days within its theory and practice. Among the most influential Arabic works that propounded the theory of criti-cal days, one should mention Avicenna's Canon, Averroes's Colliget, and Arabic commentaries on ps-Ptolomy's Centiloquium, while significant con-tributions were also offered by the Jewish tradition of the De luminaribus et de diebus criticis of Abraham ibn Ezra, and the Liber de febribus of Isaac Israeli.12 10 The study of the phases of the moon seems to have predated classical times and is common in popular lore. Lunaria, namely predictions or recommended activities for each day of the moon, as well as zodiologia, namely predictions based on the sign of the zodiac in which the moon falls at a given time, had wide circulation. For the Latin tradition, see Svenburg 1963. For the medieval tradition see Means 1993. 11 For an excellent survey of some of these texts, see dell'Anna 1999, I: 9-11. The ps-Hippocratic De medicorum astrologia was widely available in Pietro d'Abano's translation. For a printed edition, see d'Abano 1485. On this text, see Thorndike 1960; and Kibre 1978. On medical prognosis in the Middle Ages see also the recent article by Demaitre 2003. Demaitre, however, questionably argues for the minor role of astrology in medical prognostication. 12 See Avicenna 1555, Liber IV, fen. 2, tract. 2 {De diebus crisi et horis eius), cap. 1-10, fols. 449r-451r; and Averroes 1574, Liber IV, cap. 40 {De diebus criticis), fols. 76v-77r.

For instance, the passage of time as determined by the position of the planets in the heavens was an essen-tial element of medical prognosis. The theory of critical days hinged on the relationship between the macrocosm (the heavens) and the microcosm (hu-man beings), expressing a close connection between illness, time, and the position of the luminaries and planets. According to one of its basic princi-ples, for example, acute fevers were due to the movements of the moon, while chronic fevers were due to those of the sun.13 The popularity and lon-gevity of these theories within medical circles is attested not only by the nu-merous extant medical manuscripts, but also by the fact that the theory of critical days became one of the favorite topics of seventeenth-century aca-demic prolusions and disputations (dell'Anna 1999,1:11).

Reading Health in the Stars: From the University to the Courtly Library In Italian universities, the teaching of astrologia (by which we should under-stand both astronomy and astrology) seems to have been foundational for the three major disciplinary areas in which the university curriculum of a student in ars et medicinae was structured: mathematics, natural philosophy, and medicine.14 Lectures in astrology were certainly part of the curriculum at Pavia, the Studium of the Duchy of Milan, and the Rotuli of the university generally indicate at least two teachers of astrology in any given year.15 2.1. Astrological Medicine at Pavia Although we have a reasonably complete list of the names of the professors who taught at Pavia, unlike those of Bologna, the Pavia statutes of the Col-lege of Arts and Medicine do not provide much information regarding the texts studied. From the high mobility of the students and professors at Pavia, we can presume, however, that their course of study must have been similar to that of other universities such as Bologna, Padua, Pisa, and, to some ex-tent, Paris.16 Before the Studium at Pavia was established, the citizens of the Duchy of Milan who wanted to pursue a university degree had no choice but to study 'abroad,' often choosing Bologna and Paris as their preferred institu-14 For a discussion of the importance of astronomy/astrology in these areas, see Rutkin 2002, If.; ch. 2 (on astrology and natural philosophy); and ch. 3 (on astrology, medicine, and mathematics). 15 To give only some random examples: the Rotuli of 1399-1400 indicate the follow-ing: M. Blazio de Parma legenti Philosophiam moralem, naturalem et Astrologiam, Magistro Iohanni de Catelonia legenti Astrologiam, and M. Francisco de Crispis legenti Astrologiam. See Majocchi 1905-1915, I: 421 f. The Rotuli of 1425 report under the rubric \"Ad lecturam Astrologie\": Μ. Petrus de Montealcino, legat in die-bus festivis, and M. Antonius de Bernadigio, legat astrologiam cum salario flor. XL. Bernadiggio appears also on the same Rotuli as teacher of phisica, while Pietro da Montalcino also taught ad lecturam extraordinariam Pratice. See Majocchi, 11/1, 221f. By 1439 Bernadiggio had risen considerably within the academic ranks and received 300 florins for his teaching ad lecturam ordinariam Medicine, but he was also still teaching astrologia. Pietro da Montalcino does not appear in the Rotuli, whereas a Stephanus da Faventia also taught astrologia together with Bernadiggio; Majocchi 1905-1915, II/l, 395. 16 It would be a mistake, of course, to assume uncritically that these universities did not have their own specificities. This, however, should not prevent us from assum-ing that the basic teachings were similar. One should also mention that despite the regular bans issued by most cities forbidding their citizens from studying at other Studia, this ban was often ignored or circumvented, at least partially. Often students spent time at another university before returning to Pavia to graduate, as in the case of the physician-historian Paolo Giovio; see Zimmerman 1995.

For our purposes, it is particularly significant that the Bolognese medical students had to study all three books of Galen's De diebus criticis during their first three years, and that as part of their training in astrology in their third and fourth year they studied medico-astrological texts such as ps-Ptolemy's Centiloquium with Haly's commentary and Guillelmus Anglicus's De urina non visa}* Although we cannot compare the Pavia and Bologna curricula in their entirety, at least for astrology there is substantial evidence that the curriculum at Pavia may not have differed considerably from that of Bologna.19 Evidence in support of this thesis can be gained by examining the 17 In the initial pages of this article, Tiziana Pesenti examines the early teaching at the University through two prominent teachers: Albertino Rinaldi da Salso and Gio-vanni Capitani da Vittuone. Here Pesenti argues that from Albertino da Salso on-wards, because of his training at the University of Bologna, the University of Pavia showed a marked non-astrological character: \"Da Albertino in poi la fisica soppi-antö decisamente, nella produzione dei maestri pavesi, l'astrologia. Questa rimase la scienza della corte, mentre i professori dello Studio cominciarono da allora ad affiancare agli autori medici testi di filosofia naturale.\" And later, \"L'interesse di Albertino per problemi di una fisica del tutto aliena da valenze astrologiche derivava dalla sua formazione bolognese ed anche la tendenza che egli esercito sulla scuola pavese, isolando la tendenza astrologica rappresentata da Maino [Maineri], va inquadrata in un ambito piü generale di relazioni tra Pavia e Bologna\" (Pesenti 1990, 468f.). Although Nancy Siraisi (quoted by Pesenti) has drawn attention to the different medical models offered by Pietro d'Abano and Taddeo Alderotti, respec-tively the two most significant representatives of the universities of Padua and Bo-logna in the Middle Ages, one should be cautious to draw the conclusion that these medical models were mutually exclusive. Furthermore, Pesenti seem to see astrol-ogy as one monolithic practice, a concept that fails to recognize the complexities of this discipline, and ignores its profound relationship with medicine in the theory of the critical days. As I will discuss below, one could hardly argue that astrology was not part of the Bolognese curriculum. On Bologna, see Federici Vescovini 1998, I: 193-223. On Paris, see Jacquart 1992, 121-134. The astrological teachings in the Bolognese curriculum have been recently contexualized in Rutkin 2002, ch. 3. Rut-kin presents a cogent and persuasive argument in favor of the centrality of astrology within the Bolognese curriculum. Although he does not address the issue of medical astrology in detail, his argument reaffirms the centrality of astrology within the Bolognese curriculum.

The comparison with the Bolognese curriculum, however, reveals much more. It indicates those texts that in all likelihood were also at the core of the curriculum of medicine and astrology at Pavia. The correspondence between the holdings in the ducal library and texts studied and taught at Northern Italian Studia should not be surprising. Some of the most esteemed court physicians held positions at the University of Pavia. Furthermore, the duke himself heavily influenced the politics of the Studium. The constant intervention of the ducal authority in the life of the Studium is well documented, not only regarding the appointment of profes-sors to the Studium, but also in relation to litigation between members of the university, regular impositions upon a collegium to accept a new member, or upon the Studium to confer a degree.39 Additionally, during Ludovico il Moro's rule, Ambrogio Varesi da Rosate, his most famous court astrologer, was put in charge of university hires, most likely strengthening any astrologi-cal leaning at the Studium (Cuomo 1987, 28). Clearly there was no sharp separation between university and court medicine, and there is substantial evidence demonstrating that a number of prominent physicians moved com-fortably between these two spheres.40 3.

It is therefore time to turn to private correspondence that bears witness to the practice of medical astrology in fifteenth-century Milan. As noted before, one of the staples of astrological medicine was the theory of critical days. In what follows I will concentrate on one particular incident, in which we can observe the practical application of the theory of critical days and other types of medical astrology. My case study centers on the illness and death of Gian Galeazzo Maria Sforza (1469-1494), duke of Milan from 1476-1494. The various phases of the illness were characterized by persistent fevers that eventually led to his death in 1494. In reading the thick web of correspondence between the physicians and courtiers attending the duke, his wife Isabella d'Aragona, and his uncle Ludovico, we can gauge the personal and political implications of the duke's health. Only at his death in 1494 did Gian Galeazzo's uncle and custodian, Ludovico il Moro, offi-cially receive the title of duke of Milan. And it seems no coincidence that it was in 1494 that France, with the support of Ludovico, invaded Italy, occu-pied Naples, and finally—in an unexpected turn of events—attacked its erst-while ally Ludovico.41 From the correspondence it is evident that the disease, which never fully abandoned the young duke from an early age, followed a regular cycle. References to the day of the illness are very common in the correspondence. In addition, the fevers alternated between cold and hot. Furthermore, while the disease was progressing, reference was often made to the expulsion of excess humors. All these elements are present in the treatment of fevers in Galen's De diebus criticis. Additionally, one can presume that Gian Galeazzo's physicians erected a celestial figure (or horoscope) at the time of the onset of the disease, its decumbiture.42 It is therefore worth following some of this correspondence. Gian Galeazzo often wrote personally to his uncles Ludovico and As-canio to inform them about the progress of his illness. In the fall of 1483, for example, Gian Galeazzo himself informed his uncle Ascanio of his poor health with the following words: As I wrote to you in other letters, today—which is the fourth day—a certain alteration (al-teratione) appeared, which was accompanied by cold and hot fever. All day yesterday and tonight we felt very sick and unwell until the 9 1 hour, to the point that it was too much for our complexion and young age. Nonetheless, around the 9th hour it started to get better and we have been feeling quite well for the remaining part of the day. For this reason we rest our hopes in the divine clemency that we will sail to a safe harbor and be free from this condi-tion. And to reassure you we wanted to inform you, so that if you have read otherwise you 41 On the events preceding the invasion of Italy, see the numerous essays in Abulafia 1995a. The full political implication of Gian Galeazzo's death and his relationship with Ludovico (including Ludovico's alleged poisoning of Gian Galeazzo) are ex-plored fully in a forthcoming article. 42 For an illuminating analysis of this practice in the late sixteenth century, see Grafton and Siraisi 2001, esp. 69-72.

Gian Galeazzo was still sick, but the physicians were hopeful he would soon recover: Around the 17th hour this Illustrious Lord started feeling cold, and then hot, and this condi-tion persists up to now, the 24th hour. The paroxysm has been much less significant than that of the day before yesterday and although the matter expelled (materia peccante) is of such a nature that shows the illness to last a few more days, nonetheless the doctors hope to bring His Excellence to a safe port. They have not yet ordered to give him the remedy as they are waiting for Nature to take its course, which so far has been very successful, and to let the present conjunction pass, because, as the moon is [in conjunction] with Mars, this would negatively affect the remedy {faria furere la medicina)44 As noted earlier, astrological medicine was also associated with the admini-stration of herbal treatments. Within this framework, some medications needed to be administered at certain times and not others so as to ensure maximum efficacy and the positive influence of the stars. The unfavorable conjunction of the moon with Mars would have had a negative effect on Gian Galeazzo's health and therefore the doctors had suggested waiting a few days before administering it. The disease was explicitly set within an astrological framework on other significant occasions. For instance, on 2 October 1483 Gian Galeazzo himself wrote as follows to his uncle Ascanio: 43 ASMi, Sforzesco, Potenze Sovrane (henceforth SPS), cart. 1464, n. 329.

In the beginning [this illness] caused us much pain and discomfort, but since Sunday we have felt much better and we are now without fever. Since yesterday we have had a few lines, and we believe the reason is the combustion of the moon. Thank God around the 22nd hour it went away and we hope in His clemency that we will soon be free from it as it has been much more moderate than in the beginning.45 The terms alteratione, compressione, parocismo, and materia peccante in the correspondence are all part of a specialized technical vocabulary used to ex-plain the theory of critical days (dell'Anna 1991,1: passim). The combustion of the moon refers to the moon's position in relation to the sun: if it is within eight and a half degrees, it is combusta (i.e. burnt), an aspect that often leads to complications (Burnett 1996, 376). Far from presenting a technical and lucid medical explanation, how-ever, these letters use a lightly textured medical jargon. While they do in-clude medical theories and terminology, they do not discuss it in the same lucid and compact prose that one finds in the medical treatises; but this is hardly surprising. As the record of oral conversation, and the result of a medical discourse aimed at people with no medical training, these stylistic and rhetorical features are to be expected (cf. Crisciani 2001, 695f.).46 Gian Galeazzo's illness fits the mould of Galenic fevers. According to the Galenic tradition, the cycle of a patient's pathology started from the mo-ment the fever appeared. The cycle lasted twenty days, and it could be re-peated numerous times.47 Gian Galeazzo told Ascanio that his alteratione appeared on the fourth day of the cycle. According to the theory of critical 45 ASMi, SPS, cart. 1464, n. 332, Gian Galeazzo to Ascanio, Milan, 2 October, 1483: Respondendo ad quanto me scrive la signoria vostra per le soe del penultimo del passato condolendose de la alteratione nostra de la febre dicemo che siamo certissimi che sua signoria insieme con quello lllustrissimo signore Duca di Calabria nostro patre ne habino havuto displacentia et in vero al principio la ce dede grande affano et ambastia.

(Transcription and emphasis mine.) 46 Crisciani's argument that theory does not appear in this type of correspondence is based on a small sample of correspondence from the Milanese archives. A larger study reveals variations of the kind examined here that complicate the picture. 47 Galen makes a distinction between the mensis medicinalis and the mensis lunaris. See dell'Anna 1999, ch. I; and Galen, De diebus decretoriis, 3.9, in Kühn 1964-1965, IX, 928-933. Galen's treatment of this theory did not receive a sustained cri-tique until the sixteenth century, when the Milanese physician Gerolamo Cardano openly challenged Galen's 'medicinal month'; see Grafton and Siraisi 2001, 89f.

The signs can be positive or negative, and this will establish the final outcome of the illness. Galen's theory of critical days incorporates Greek humoral theory and semiotics within a mathematical framework, indicating a primary develop-mental factor of the illness and its manifestation in the concotio of the hu-mors. The sooner the patient shows the signa concotionis the better, as the illness will be shorter.49 Hence, Gian Galeazzo's allusion to compressione (by which he probably meant complessione) and his uncle's reference to ma-teria peccante are explicit references to humoral theory and to the idea that, according to the theory of critical days, the early expulsion of excess humors was an essential part of the illness's progress toward recovery. According to the tenets of classical astrology, the moon was associ-ated with the element of water, and, as a consequence, with all the liquid elements of the human body, namely its humors. 0 Despite the strong rela-tionship between the position of the moon and the progression of the illness, other factors could intervene and upset this delicate balance. Among these factors, ps-Ptolemy mentioned food (cibus), anger (ira), and physical exer-cise {labor), but also, significantly, the position of the other planets.51 The 48 According to this theory, the dies indicativi are the fourth, eleventh, and seventeenth day of the cycle (which, as noted, starts at the appearance of fever). The seventh, fourteenth and twentieth days are the dies iudicativi, namely those days when the doctor will be able to determine the outcome of the illness (these are, in effect, the critical days, the dies critici). If the cycle were protracted beyond 120 days, the fe-ver would be declared chronic; otherwise it was considered acute. For a treatment of these complex aspects of the theory, see dell'Anna 1999, 48-76.

Many more letters on Gian Galeazzo's health followed over the years until he died in 1494. Always prone to poor health, he fell seriously ill in 1492 and a wealth of correspondence offers invaluable insight into the pro-gress of the illness that ultimately led to his death. From 1492 until the mo-ment of his death, his health never improved. According to the ducal physicians Gabriele Pirovano and Nicolo Cusano, who took care of Gian Galeazzo in the years and months preceding his death, this was due both to the influence of the heavens and the concurrent eclipse, but also to Gian Galeazzo's own ill-fated nativity: Illustrious and Excellent Lord most Distinguished, after the notice [we sent] at the 17th hour, the Illustrious Duke woke up again at about the 18th hour and we think he did not look re-stored as we expected after his meal and some sleep. Rather, he looked very weak, and, hav-ing given him a bit of broth, soon after he had a violent jump and a tremor in his stomach and he let off some air from his mouth; this was accompanied by some noise of water that one could hear moving. Further, he had a twinge and a sense of suffocation that affected the liver and the spleen with a rather sharp pain in the liver if pressed. But it stopped, and the noise appeared to descend to the intestines, which is a worrying sign in medicine for we have very few remedies [for it.] But we will carry on [caring for him], especially because of the terrible influence of the heavens, both because of the eclipse and the direction of his nativity as his Highness knows from past experience because \"etiam in medicina solus casus virtutis est per se signum malum.\" We will continue with the proper and necessary remedies for as long as we can, and we won't fail to inform you of that which ensues and make provisions for that which happens and may occur easily in these circumstances. And if this happens, it is not in our power to restore his health, but he will be in clear danger of dying immediately—God forbid.53 morbos acutos. Sol vero prolixos.

On October 21 a series of letters to Ludovico announced his death. On the fol-lowing day Ludovico proclaimed himself duke of Milan and took official control of the duchy at a crucial point in the history of the Italian peninsula. The disastrous results of his rule, most notably the French invasion of Italy in 1494, can hardly be overestimated (Abulafia 1995b). Milan was occupied by the French army in 1499 and Ludovico was forced to flee. Finally captured while trying to cross the mountains and seek refuge with the emperor, he died in the Castle of Loches in 1508 (Abulafia 1995b, 24). It seems that neither Ludovico nor his astrologers and physicians could predict the events that had ensued. 4. Conclusion As this essay illustrates, astrology could be employed in many different ways in the Renaissance. At court, however, astrology was often closely connected to both political practices and the health of the ruler. Without a doubt, medi-cal astrology retained a certain prominence in both the curricula of Northern Italian universities, and in cities, as well as in the daily practice of Italian physicians. Far from being solely a theoretical body of knowledge, medical astrology was regularly employed in the treatment of illness and in medical prognostication. Its conjectural nature was disguised by fashioning astrologi-cal medicine in the language of astronomy and mathematical computation. At the same time, the complex nature of the art allowed the physician significant flexibility for adjusting the course of his prognostication and hence of his treatment. For this reason, medical astrology offered more reassurance than other branches of medicine. By determining the influence of the planets on the human body and thus resorting to different astrological practices, the phy-opressa piu la virtute et multo debile et havendoli dato uno pocho de stilato fra pocho li sopravene uno salto et moto tremulo nel stomaco cum una gurgitatide di ventositate et strepito di aqua che sensibilmente se sentiva movere et li faceva dolore et suffugatione che comunicava alfidago et ala milsa cum dolore maggiore nelftdago al tochare; pur cessava et pariva descendesse tale rugito ad le intestine, cosse che sono di grande timore in medicina, et che haveriemo poche ο nulle medicine.

Introduction Sometime around 1540, the Nuremberg publisher Johann Petreius ap-proached Girolamo Cardano to prepare a new edition of two astrological trea-tises by the Milanese polymath.1 The first of these tracts, De supplemento almanack, called for greater sophistication in the use of planetary ephem-erides by teaching practitioners to inspect the heavens for themselves.2 Its complement, entitled De temporum et motuum erraticarum restitutione, fo-cused on the observational correction of planetary parameters. Cardano was out of his depth in accomplishing this last goal, but the new German editions of these works brought him great fame anyway.3 This success derived in no small part from his decision to append a series of remarkable genitures to his booklet. By 1543, a sizeable collection of 67 birth charts had begun to dwarf the original content of the libelli duo. Cardano's German horoscope collection benefited strongly from two local developments: on the one hand, a preoccupation with the collecting of celebrity genitures in the volatile diplomatic context of the Holy Roman Em-pire; on the other, Philip Melanchthon's promotion of astrology as a key component of Lutheran higher education. At the same time, Cardano de-1 On the publication history and content of Cardano's Libelli duo, see Grafton 1999, 57-70 and 77-87. I would like to thank Patrick Curry and H. Darrel Rutkin for their stimulating comments on an earlier version of this paper. 2 Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 587a: Si locus Planetae certus habetur, locum fixae hie in tabula cognosce, ac eius latitudinem: deinde considera in Almanach, quando planeta talem gradum & minutum adipiscetur, quo tempore etiam Stella illi coni-ungetur. 3 For Cardano's limitations in the observational improvement of mathematical astron-omy, see Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 11: Vtinam nobis ex superis aliquis reuelaret exac-tam motuum coelestium vicissitudinem: at postquam id fieri minime contingit, tentabimus per proximiores accedere coniecturas. (My emphasis.) 4 See Warburg 1920; Kusukawa 1995, 124-173. Cardano's views on astrology are sometimes reminiscent of Melanchthon.

Since the art is infinite, it must be taught through judgment, not discipline.5 This quote has been adopted as a motto in Kocku von Stuckrad's masterly synthesis of the history of astrology. According to von Stuckrad, Cardano realized that astrology is more of a hermeneutic than a mathematical practice, which seeks to generate a convincing image of one's personality through a dialogue with the client. This interpretation attributes the credibility of as-trology to the social dimension of judgments, and questions the relevance of categories like 'true' or 'false' (von Stuckrad 2003, 366-368). Patrick Curry has recently defended a similar view, which also turns to recent work in sci-ence studies for inspiration (Willis and Curry 2004, 118). Curry proposes an interpretation of astrology as cunning knowledge (metis), in which the ritual of preparing and interpreting an astrological map constitutes the meaning of the different factors in that map. Accordingly, \"metic truth\" cannot be meas-ured, explained, universally applied, nor taught (Willis and Curry 2004, 97 and 104-106). Cardano is thus appropriated as one who anticipated the most recent views on the epistemology and scientific status of astrology. It is the purpose of this paper to examine this operation by studying Cardano's offhand remark within the original context of the published horoscope collections. Were these collections symptomatic of a Renaissance revaluation of hermeneutics over mathematics, of therapy over theory? Were two millennia of astrological theory- and truth-seeking exposed as window dressing and divergence from a prisca astrologia where divinatory rituals reigned supreme? In other words, do these texts (written in an era when the academic status of the art shifted from a rational to an irrational pursuit) justify the aforementioned views on astrology? Est autem ars haec Philosophiae pars prognostica & praecognoscere docens, unde non uere scientia, sed ut ad medicinam se habet liber praedictionum Hippocratis aut Galeni, ita hie ad totam Philosophiam. 5 Cardano 1543, fol. A3v: Atque illud citra iactantiam dictum sit, qui huius libelli compendiosa breuitate futura non intellexerit, neque ea quam numerosa librorum multitudine intelliget.

Experiment and the Challenges of an Infinite Art In the aforementioned quote, Cardano emphasized the practice of judgment as a solution to the problem that \"the [astrological] art is infinite.\" What was Cardano's understanding of an 'infinite art' and its specific challenges? Two passages in his collected works are particularly helpful to elucidate this ques-tion. The first locus is Cardano's commentary on the famous opening phrase of the first Hippocratic aphorism, \"Life is short, science \\ars\\ is long; oppor-tunity is elusive, experiment is dangerous, judgment is difficult.\" Cardano interpreted this as a warning that time was not on the rational physician's side, because of the ever-changing conditions of disease and the limited life-span of the physician. The solution to this problem, he added, was to privi-lege the composition and study of aphorisms (Cardano 1663, vol. 8, 217f.). The second passage occurs in Cardano's commentary on Ptolemy's astro-logical manual Tetrabiblos, where Cardano distinguishes two ways of inter-preting a natal chart. The first mode, practiced by the Egyptians and Arabs, proceeds by combining specific signs into a syndrome that can be retrieved in an authoritative textbook.6 According to Cardano, Ptolemy was right to call this procedure \"infinite.\" In the alternative mode, the astrologer combines specific signs into an original syndrome, on the basis of a specific point in the natal chart, rather than the textbook (Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 246a). This highlights two crucial dimensions of Cardano's understanding of an 'infinite art.' The second passage suggests that the infinity of the astro-logical art was linked with a specific (\"Arabic\") interpretive practice, which proceeded on the basis of a myriad number of available syndromes and corre-sponding 'ready-made textbook probabilities.' The (\"Ptolemaic\") solution consisted in allowing the interpreter to 'invent' his own syndromes and cor-responding probabilities from a more restricted textual repertoire. The first passage adds a second dimension by suggesting that these solutions are most efficiently embodied in aphorisms. A shift in the structure of Cardano's horoscope collections documents the genesis of this view. In the first German edition of the horoscope collec-tion, the Libelli duo (1543), Cardano started out by identifying a single, ex-traordinary trait in each of the 67 people whose horoscopes he published and interpreted.7 For instance, the natal chart of Charles de Bourbon-Montpensier 6 'Syndrome' here denotes a collection of signs that can help us to infer a hidden cause. For the meaning of related technical terms like 'signs' and 'probability,' see Maclean 2002, 149. 7 See Cardano 1543, fols. A2r-A3r (table of content), and fols. A3v-A4r: [...] nempe in his primo omnis mortis uarietas expressa est, ueneni, fulguris, aquae, publicae animaduersionis, ferri, casuum, morborum: tum & circa ilia tempora diuturna, breuia, media: turn uariae nascendi formae geminorum, monstruosorum, posthu-morum, spuriorum, eorumque quibus in puerperio materia extincta est: tum etiam Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"210 Steven vanden Broecke was announced in the index to the collection as \"belonging to one who was killed and deserted his king.\"8 This specific biographical focus allowed Car-dano's interpretation to proceed from specific astrological elements in the chart, such as the seventh house, the 'terms' of maleficent planets, and ma-leficent directions. In doing so, Cardano effectively selected his own syn-dromes of signs and relevant probabilities. On the level of astrological teaching, Cardano interspersed specific pieces of his repertoire of astrological doctrina throughout the horoscope collection. The interpretation of Bourbon-Montpensier's fate, for instance, provided the occasion to insert a didactic poem explaining the distribution of planetary terms in the zodiac (Cardano 1543, genitures 27 and 28). In other words, the \"teaching through judgment\" of which Cardano spoke in our initial quote was still equivalent to a teaching of disciplined doctrine. The 1543 collection 'invented' specific interpreta-tions of horoscopes, but taught a fairly traditional textual repertoire, albeit one that exchanged a \"multitude of books\" for a \"brief yet packed booklet\" in the best Ptolemaic tradition. In other words, Cardano stuck to the first dimen-sion of the 'infinite art.' But when Cardano published a new, expanded version, called Libelli quinque (1547), he substantially modified the relation between invention and teaching. This happened when he announced the existence of ten books De iudiciis astrorum that contained his complete astrological teachings.9 This announcement enabled Cardano to explain the genesis of the Libelli quinque: \"Thus I believe to have followed a unique mode of both discovering and teaching the discipline [of astrology]; that is, linking its principles with the principles of philosophy, and its decrees (decreta) with experiments.\"10 Car-dano's attitude of 1543 can still be recognized in the notion that astrological teaching should proceed by linking its \"decrees\" with the practical experience of judgment. But a notable expansion occurs in the statement that this also morum, timidi, temerarij, prudentis, stulti, daemoniaci, fallacis, simplicis, haereti-corum, furum, siccariorum, pediconum, cinaedorum, meretricum, adulterorum: atque etiam circa disciplinas, rhetorum, iureconsultorum, philosophorum, quique archiatri, & diuinatores, artiflcesque clari, tum etiam contemptores uirtutum sint.

Cardano claimed that he had secretly re-invented the entire astrological art. Another new element is Cardano's revelation that his \"unique mode\" for doing this in fact consists of a double strategy: philosophy for its principles, experiment for its decrees. This raises two obvious questions with respect to the horoscope col-lection. First of all, what was the precise role of the 'experiments of judg-ment' in the discovery of the art? Second, how did philosophy fit into all this? The first question will be answered in the next two sections, but at least one preliminary remark can be made. Cardano's emphasis on the separate role of philosophy suggests that we should not approach this as a Baconian process of induction from singular experiences to universal principles. But then what is the case here? As we will see, the answer to this further question revolves around the second dimension of 'infinite art.' 3. Doctrine, Aphorism, Judgment Although the Libelli duo and Libelli quinque were presented as excerpts from the larger De iudiciis astrorum, Cardano remained unwilling to publish the latter work, \"so that no intolerable sacrifice of private property would ruin me\".\" But, as we have seen, Cardano's reference to the astrological magnum opus did enable him to lay down the novel claim that it substantially over-hauled the art. Moreover, this ambitious claim was embodied in the structure of the new Libelli quinque. By 1547, the horoscope collection had become a separate book, which no longer carried the task of teaching astrological doc-trina. Various theoretical topics that were previously revealed as Cardano's readers worked their way through the horoscopes were now relegated to two textbooks on revolutions and on the judgment of genitures. Last but not least, Cardano added a new book of astrological aphorisms, containing the most important inventions of the De iudiciis astrorum,n Apparently, the dichot-omy between doctrine and judgment that was fundamental to the Libelli duo, was now replaced by a tripartite structure where aphorisms occupied a middle ground in the order of teaching and invention. Thus Cardano made the sec-ond dimension of his 'infinite art' operational. 11 Cardano 1547, fol. 3r: [...] nec tamen intollerabilis iactura rei familiaris me pessundaret. 12 Cardano 1547, fol. 3r: Scripseram haec omnia decern libris ab initio, uerum cum nulla in re maiorem rei familiaris iacturam fecissem, non fide, non studio, sed fortuna temporum aut mea, te deserere coactus sum.

In his commentary on a passage in chapter IV.9, \"On the Quality of Death,\" Car-dano introduced a natal chart that he received from the Louvain mathemati-cian Reinier Gemma Frisius (1508-1555) while passing through the Spanish Netherlands on his voyage to Scotland in 1552.13 This chart belonged to \"Laurentius of Louvain,\" a \"heretic\" who was burned alive in 1547. While interpreting this extraordinary event, Cardano soon found that the relative positions of the sun and Saturn agreed with the actual year of death. But Ptolemy's apodictic statement, \"If Mars is quartile or in opposition to the sun or the moon, [...] at mid-heaven or the opposite point, [indicates a death] by being set up on the stakes,\" proved more difficult to reconcile. While the sun and Mars were indeed in quartile aspect at the time of Laurentius's birth, Mars was placed in the first house, not the tenth or the fourth houses as re-quired by Ptolemy's rule. The solution to this riddle, Cardano added, lay in the relationship between the astrologer and his books: One should heed Ptolemy's warning, here and in the next chapter, that it is necessary to know this art perfectly. Someone who has not studied Ptolemy's book effectively and for a long time cannot teach the art. For instead of these two missing conditions, there are five others which are not necessary but increase the effect anyway.14 Having said this, Cardano provided five other aphoristic statements to ex-plain why Laurentius died in the fire after all. In doing so, he claimed that using and teaching the art depends on an intimate relationship between the astrologer and the Tetrabiblos. Selecting, composing, and teaching aphorisms in turn testified to the success of this relationship. Aphorisms, in other words, embodied the effective appropriation of astrological doctrine. They offered a powerful means to steer through difficult texts, tried in the practice of diffi-cult judgments. Aphorisms were now the tangible 'invention' that resulted from \"teaching through judgment.\"15 They were what held Cardano's public discovery of the art together.16 13 See Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 353f. The original passage can be found in Ptolemy 1940, 434f. 14 Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 354a: [...] oportet animaduertere, quodPtolemaeus docuit, & in sequente capite, docebit, quod oportet ipsam artem perfecte cognoscere. Et istud non potest doceri, nisi ei qui diu & ejficaci studio in libro suo versatus fuerit. Nam loco harum duarum conditionum deficientium, sunt aliae quinque, quae non erant necessariae, & tarnen augent effectum. 15 Even within Cardano's collection of astrological aphorisms, horoscope judgments frequently appear as fiducia of the aphorisms. See Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 84a. 16 These elements were not lost on at least some of Cardano's readers. In an apparent attempt to recover more of Cardano's \"tacit knowledge,\" one unknown reader ea-gerly quarried the Libelli duo (1543) for predictive aphorisms, while another used Brought to you by | Cambridge University LibraryAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Evidence and Conjecture in Cardano's Horoscope Collections 213 4. Renaissance Medicine and Giovanni Pico's Critique of Astrology Cardano thus succeeded in restoring the finite, doctrinal nature of the astro-logical art by embedding it within an infinite process of reading texts, judg-ing horoscopes, and producing aphorisms. How was this possible? Ian Maclean has provided an important clue by pointing out that Renaissance physicians also viewed the medical art as a \"finite doctrine of infinite things\" (Maclean 2000a). This basic attitude was supported by specific logical, meta-physical, and ethical convictions. In the realm of logic, Renaissance physi-cians were remarkably tolerant towards non-contradictory contraries. On a metaphysical level, they often assumed that the natural and the preternatural, the ordinary and the exceptional, were commensurable in the order of being. From an ethical perspective, they generally opted for strongly individual, patient-oriented practices (Maclean 2000a, 238-241). This situation also had an important epistemological component, insofar as medicine habitually op-erated with much more relaxed notions of knowledge and empirical proof (Maclean 2002). The medical art distinguished the medical use of evidence, governed by conjectural magna ex parte logic, from the rules and precepts that were implemented, and which were held to be universally valid. The similarities between the case of medicine and that of Cardano's as-trology are striking. Consider the opinions and terminology of the dedicatory letter of Libelli quinque (1547): [...] Natural causes, such as we hold the stars to be, can also be frustrated by natural reasons. And the arts do not achieve their ends of necessity, but only for the most part (magna ex parte), which is also the case in the science of the stars.17 Such similarities should not surprise us. Cardano, after all, was an academi-cally trained physician who held prestigious posts at the medical faculties of Pavia and Bologna. Moreover, Nancy Siraisi has shown that Cardano viewed the Hippocratic Epidemics as a methodological model for medical invention. More specifically, he believed that Hippocrates had derived the principles of the art of prediction by collecting and comparing similar \"experiments\" (ex-perimenta) (Siraisi 1997, 128). Likewise, Cardano claimed that both Ptolemy the horoscope collection as study material to hone his own astrological skills. See National Library of Medicine (Bethesda MD, USA), shelf marks WZ 240 C266L 1543 and WZ 240 C266Lq 1547. 17 Cardano 1547, fol. 2v: [...] naturales causae, qualia nos sydera esse supponimus, naturali etiam ratione frustrari possint: & finem assequi artes non semper sit necessarium, uerum magna ex parte solum, quod & in syderali scientia euenit. It is difficult to extract a uniform view on the factors affecting uniform celestial causal-ity from Cardano's work. A 'minimalist' stance can be found in Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 107b-108a.

An important clue appears at the end of Cardano's commentary on the natal chart of his brother Cornelius: Even if Pico della Mirandola himself would come to life again, this one clearly shows that astrology is not doubtful, unless someone would care to pursue minutely, as in a trial on gold, things that are ambiguous, fortuitous, and completely hidden from the senses.19 It is well known that Giovanni Pico's Disputations against divinatory astrol-ogy (1495) (possibly the most devastating critique of astrology ever written) had a tremendous impact on Renaissance practitioners like Cardano (see Al-len 1941; Westman 1993; vanden Broecke 2003). Less well known, however, is the fact that Pico's systematic attack on astrology relied almost exclusively on the twin categories of reason and authority. In doing so, Pico largely fol-lowed the late medieval academic astrologers whom he attacked. A good example of this appears in the dedicatory letter of Girolamo Salio's edition of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (1493), which appeared while Pico was composing his Disputations (Ptolemy 1493 [ISTC ipO 1089000]). Salio described astronomia as a science that elaborated upon the natural-philosophical premise that the virtues and motions of the stars are the cause of generation and corruption in this world.20 Astronomia then distributed its study of generation and corrup-tion over a \"science of motions\" (its \"demonstrative\" part) and a science of judgment. Salio acknowledged that the latter part proceeded from effect to cause, but emphasized how this happened by the strict standards of Aristote-lian induetio: many memories build an experience, many experiences build knowledge. Moreover, Salio described astrological judgments as fully de-monstrative, reasoning from cause to effect by means of a syllogism. In his De astrologica veritate (1498), Lucio Bellanti even provided an example of such an astrological syllogism: Anyone with a geniture having Mercury in the house of Mars, and Aries in the ascendant, is loquacious; 18 Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 94 and 591. At the same time, Cardano deplored the fact that Ptolemy—unlike Hippocrates—had not bequeathed his data to posterity: the brevity of the Tetrabiblos made it much more akin to the Hippocratic Aphorisms. 19 Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 473a: Ex hoc palam est, etiam si Mirandula reuiuiscat, non dubiam esse Astrologiam, nisi quis minutim concidens, velut in auri experimento ea prosequi curet, quae ambigua & casui subiecta, & sensui pene abscondita sunt. 20 This liberal interpretation of Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption was fairly widespread among late medieval mathematicians and natural philosophers.

(Ibid., f. a4v) Bellanti pre-empted the objection that many people with a similar geniture were in fact not loquacious, by qualifying his judgments as reasoning ceteris paribus or \"ex suppositione\" (the supposition being that no material, fortui-tous, or voluntaristic impediments would intervene).21 It should be clear that this approach, strongly inspired by the logic and natural philosophy of the arts faculty, was very different from Cardano's choice to approach his de-fense of the art through empirical singulars, about which he readily admitted that they were to some extent conjectural and concerned with objects that are \"ambiguous, fortuitous, and completely hidden from the senses.\" This is confirmed in chapter II.9 of the Disputations, where Pico does employ a few 'experimental' arguments. He recounts having observed the weather conditions for 130 days during a single winter, finding them to match astrologer's predictions on no more than 6 or 7 days. What is most stunning about Pico's experiments from a modern perspective is their overall irrelevance to his case. The anecdotes appear almost casually, and I have not been able to find similar arguments in the rest of the Disputations (Pico della Mirandola 1946—1952, vol. 1, 162-166). Once again, this reflects the founda-tional role of late medieval Aristotelian natural philosophy and epistemology in Pico's final work, which precluded the direct use of historical events as a legitimate basis for valid knowledge claims (Dear 1995). By assigning a central role to horoscope collections, Cardano thus took advantage of a strategy that Pico had left untouched. And it was medi-cine that taught him exactly how to do this. 5. Horoscope Collections in Later Medical Astrology Not surprisingly, the publication of horoscope collections was most eagerly emulated among writers on medical astrology. The first astrologer to follow Cardano's example was Thomas Bodier, whose De ratione et usu dierum criticorum was published in Paris in 15 5 5 22 As its title suggests, Bodier's treatise sought to prove that \"astrology is entirely necessary for the physi-cian,\" and to illustrate the praxis of the astrological theory of critical days (Bodier 1555, fols. 5r and 16v). These were challenging claims: although 21 Ibid., ff. a5r and blv. On reasoning 'ex suppositione' and Renaissance science, see Wallace 1981. 22 This work was first commented upon in Sudhoff 1902, 58f.

Once again, Bodier confronts us with the primacy of the relation be-tween practitioner and text. The entire treatise, including its horoscope col-lection, was presented as a commentary on the obscure aphorism 60 of ps.-Ptolemy's Centiloquium, one of the standard texts in academic astrological teaching.23 Following a discussion of theoretical principles, Bodier devoted 70 percent of his booklet to the systematic investigation of 55 horoscopes, each illustrating a specific case history from Bodier's own practice. In the introduction to this second part, we read: In an oft-cited passage, Galen states that the critical days should be observed from a very young age, so that one may consider their disagreements. Therefore, one should not make haste in proposing a judgment on these days until one has accurately observed many sick people for a long time. This is why I hope that the following charts, confirmed by art and use, will please you in procuring an able judgment.24 This emphasis on the variability of singular events was equally typical of Renaissance astrology and medicine. For precisely astrologers and physicians were able to accept these anomalous events within the confines of their art by a variety of logical, metaphysical, and ethical strategies (Maclean 2000b, 337-338). Not surprisingly, Bodier's horoscope analyses often highlighted the presence of significant anomalies by dramatizing professional and epis-temic showdowns around the patient's sickbed. On 22 November 1549, Bodier was called upon by a nobleman whose sides were swollen from the navel down to the groin, and had to prove his mettle against a midwife (Bod-ier 1555, fol. 25r/v). On 12 January 1549 and 2 October 1553, Bodier arrived just in time to confirm the doubts of his patients about their physician's ad-vice to undergo venesection (Bodier 1555, fols. 26v and 36v). Several pa-tients were erroneously diagnosed with pleurisy.25 Each of these cases promoted astrology as an important tool for medical diagnosis and prognosis, to be neglected at one's own peril. 23 Bodier 1555, fol. 5v. For the medieval Latin text of Centiloquium 60 and standard commentary, see Ptolemy 1493, fols. 112r/v. 24 Bodier 1555, fol. 17r: Galenus loco saepissime allegato fatetur dies decretorios ab adolescentulo obseruasse, vt de ipsorum dissensione diiudicaret, idcirco de dictis diebus minime iudicium properandum est, donee in multis aegris diuturno tempore quis accurate obseruauit. Quapropter spero nostra schemata subscribenda arte & vsu explorata tibi fore criticae diiudicationi conquirendae grata, [...]. 25 Bodier 1555, fols. 28r and 36v. Since pleurisy was a locus classicus for the harmony of medical syndromes of signs, Bodier's examples may have been specifically chosen to reinforce the superiority of astrological medicine.

Once again, these aphorisms operated in a textual universe: Bodier always claimed that the lessons \"that Ptolemy, Abraham Ibn Ezra, and our other masters remind us of,\" supported his personal experiences. His ex-amples thus made no clear distinction between the interpretation of these 26 texts and his singular \"experimenta.\" Bodier's public extraction of aphorisms from his horoscope collection received further elaboration by the two most famous Italian professors of astrology of the late Renaissance: Giovanni Antonio Magini and Andrea Ar-goli. Magini, who taught mathematics at the University of Bologna, pub-lished De astrologica ratione, ac vsu dierum Criticorum in 1607. Its contents were equally distributed over a commentary on Galen's treatise on critical days, two treatises on medical astrology and astrological directions, and a collection of 30 genitures. No less than fourteen of Magini's horo-scopes were borrowed from Bodier, while Cardano's collections contributed another three; all were recalculated using Copernican parameters. Magini's friend Girolamo Rossi provided another four, while the remaining nine came from his own practice.2 The structure and use of Magini's horoscope collection was very simi-lar to that of Bodier. Detailed case histories were offered as the evidential basis for a set of aphorisms that constituted chapters 21 and 22 of Magini's introduction to medical astrology. Throughout, the central task for Magini's aphorisms was to provide some measure of explanation for unexpected natu-ral deaths. Not surprisingly, such explanations were heavily cloaked in medi-cal language. Magini used the term indicationes as a synonym for aphorisms, and described their relation to the case histories as a proruptio, a \"rushing forth\"; although these aphorisms were not certain, \"several combined offer certain testimony of either death or a serious illness.\"29 Such notions were a central feature of medical semiology, which played an equally dominant role in Cardano and Bodier: indications constituted a persuasive \"prompting to follow a certain course or to act,\" successful only for the most part.30 26 Bodier 1555, fol. 51r: [...] documents quae commemorant Ptolemaeus, & Abraha-mus Auenesra caeterique nostri vates, alienum comperient.

In his first book, Argoli covered the norma and disciplina of the doctrine of critical days.31 The second book pro-vided prognostica that allowed an astrologer to tell whether a disease would be curable, long, or chronic, based on \"aphorisms, observed by the ancients, and the state of patients with respect to the daily course of the moon.\"32 Ar-goli's 113 case histories (in the 1652 edition) were appended as evidence for these prognostica. Arguing for the superiority of astrological prognosis through the Italianate image of the lynx, Argoli claimed that the medical art could offer no more than \"raw and imperfect conjecture.\"33 This makes it only more apparent that the astrological prognostica in the second book were also announced with qualifiers like \"a most important conjecture\" or \"a con-jecture that depends on several things.\"34 Indeed, conjecture even marked the very content of Argoli's aphorisms, sometimes explicitly (\"for the most part [vt plurimum]\"), but usually through the qualifications, modalities, and em-pirical accretions that characterized the narrative structure of such aphorisms. 6. Natural Philosophy and Life Writing Nevertheless, there is one feature of Cardano's horoscope collection that was not taken up by his Italianate followers. This feature pertains to the second question that was raised at the end of section 2: how did philosophy fit into all this? essarily a performative and contingent act even if performed on the basis of past training in the art of medicine, in the same way that he becomes the embodiment of the art of medicine and its precepts at the bedside of his patients\" (p. 314). 31 Argoli 1639, introduction to book II [no pagination]: Apposui itaque primo Tomo quae ad Dierum Criticorum normam facere videbantur singula; & Medicorum, qui Patres facultatis sunt, loculos, placitaque omnia ad disciplinae virgulas pensitatim excussi. 32 Ibidem: In secundo Prognostica disposui, an morbi curabiles sint, longi, chronicique, an ne, ex obseruatis Veterum aphorismis, & statu aegroti ex Lunae peragratione per dies decubitus exarato. 33 Argoli 1639, book I, 45: Ex arte enim Medica rudis est coniectatio, & imperfecta: quis enim nisi sit Lynceus, qui trans robora, quercusque perspiciebat, intestina, quaeque viscera, in quibus morbi saepe latet vis quae partes ideö nigrae appellan-tur a Graecis, quod in tenebris quodammodö, ac in absidio sint. 34 Argoli 1652, 113 (Principalissima coniectura de aegritudinis saeuitia, ac magnitu-dine, & an fuerit curabilis) and 116 (An aegritudines futurae sint chronicae, an breues, & breui terminandae, ex pluribus dependet coniectura).

More specifically, he held that different forms of divination were often 'subaltern' to specific arts like medicine, agriculture, navigation, or jurisprudence: the latter were certain per se, but became conjectural when implemented in prognostication (Cardano 1663, vol. 6, 360 and vol. 5, 94). This view raised important problems for the epistemological status of astrol-ogy. As Cardano explained in his commentary on the Tetrabiblos: Ptolemy proceeded by distinguishing and deducing causes from similar effects, and bringing several of these together again. Indeed, this art is conjectural and not an accurate science, because the causes are known from the effects.35 Where Ptolemy had claimed that astrology was entirely similar to medicine because only its praxis was conjectural, Cardano suggested that uncertainty was lodged at the very heart of the discipline.36 Fortunately, he had a solu-tion: \"This art is the prognostic part of philosophy [...] this one is to the whole of philosophy what the books on prediction of Hippocrates or Galen are to medicine.\" 7 Having promoted astrology to a 'subaltern' position with respect to natural philosophy, Cardano added that the essence of astrology resided in its systematic comparisons between cause and effect.38 Only the accident of time made it different from natural philosophy.39 But to the extent that astrology drew upon the causal principles of natural philosophy, it took part in a body of certain, rather than conjectural knowledge. Many studies have carefully documented Cardano's project in natural philosophy, which received its most extensive, if not most systematic, expression in the widely read De subtilitate (1550) (Bianchi 1994; Schütze 2000). Interestingly, some of the key ideas of this work made their way into Cardano's commentary on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (1554). Following De subtilitate, Cardano's astrologi-cal commentary evicted fire from the sublunary realm, and differentiated the 35 Cardano 1663, vol. 5, 94: Procedit autem Ptolemaeus diuidendo, & deducendo ex similibus causarum & compositione plurium, causae uerd ab effectibus cognoscun-tur, ob id coniecturalis est haec ars non exquisita scientia. 36 Ptolemy 1940, 25-27.

Moreover, this procedure shared the same overall goal as the apho-risms: to restore the finite nature of the astrological art itself. In this respect, Cardano's approach was very similar to his views on traditional biography, where he questioned the Renaissance pursuit of exemplary history and pre-ferred to investigate the mechanisms underlying fame and reputation instead. When Cardano isolated ability, power, and piety as the main parameters of fame, he also emphasized that their specific attribution to a person depended on historical context. Even apparent monsters like the Roman emperor Nero embodied a finite set of attributes in an infinite historical continuum.41 Not surprisingly, Cardano explicitly compared this situation to astrological life writing: Just as several recurring, constant, and regular motions in the stars produce a great variety that seems alien from all equality, similarity, or constancy; so we would believe that every-thing happens by chance and fortune when they seem varied, unequal, and inconstant.42 7. Conclusion We have seen that Cardano attached great weight to the personal skill and experience of the practicing astrologer. He even codified such qualities under the banner of \"subtlety\", which De subtilitate (1550) famously defined as: \"A specific reason why sensible things are comprehended by the senses, and intelligible things by the intellect, with difficulty.\"43 As this definition clearly shows, subtlety would become a key component in Cardano's program to expand the realms of the knowable. Cardano located it at once in substances, accidents, and representations, and even went so far as to present it as a qual-40 For Cardano's view on these matters in De subtilitate, see Schütze 2000, 100-109.

Within astrology, the practitioner's relation with his books offered important testimony of subtlety. Cardano, Bodier, Magini, and Argoli be-lieved that these books contained finite knowledge and that they should be subjected to an infinite series of tactical operations, with astrological apho-risms as one particularly tangible result. Following the example of most Ren-aissance physicians, Cardano and his followers self-consciously distinguished between universally valid doctrine and conjectural dealings with clients. In our introduction, we pointed out that recent studies of astrology have a tendency to interpret the art as a (social) operation that cannot be justi-fied using classic epistemic notions like 'true' or 'false'; this view has also been attributed to Cardano. Doing so obliges us to overlook the fact that Car-dano and his followers did claim truth for their astrological knowledge, even if this was a truth that was valid \"for the most part.\" It also forces us to over-look the wish of their clients to see such epistemic categories applied to ex-traordinary events, in order to extend the order of their world. In other words, astrological practitioners and their clients are at risk of being denied the right to provide a rational account of their actions in their own terms. And by dis-missing the relevance of classic epistemology for astrology, we may our-selves run the risk of underestimating its flexibility. References Allen, Don Cameron.

Setting the Stage: Girolamo Cardano's De vita propria liber \"Although various abortive medicines—as I have heard—were tried in vain, I was normally born on the 24th day of September in the year 1500, when the first hour of the night was more than half run, but less than two-thirds\" (Car-dano 2002 [1653], 5). With this remarkable sentence, sixteenth-century as-trologer, physician, scientist, alchemist, and gambler, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576),1 opens the second chapter of his autobiography, De vita pro-pria. Often the book's title is translated simply as \"The Book of My Life,\" but there is more in propria: This is the story of an \"extraordinary life\" or a \"life of his own\" with all its peculiarities, ups, and downs. Cardano leaves no doubt about the troubling circumstances of his nativity: I have taken into consideration [...] that both luminaries were falling in the angles, and nei-ther was applying to the ascendant, inasmuch as they were posited in the sixth and twelfth houses. They might have been in the eighth house, subject to the same condition, for the latter house descends and is not an angular house; a planet therein could rather be said to be falling from the angle. And although the malefics were not within the angles, nevertheless Mars was casting an evil influence on each luminary because of the incompatibility of their positions, and its aspect was square to the moon. Therefore I could easily have been a monster, except for the fact that the place of the preceding conjunction had been 29° in Virgo, over which Mercury is the ruler. And nei-ther this planet nor the position of the moon or of the ascendant is the same, nor does it apply to the second decanate of Virgo; consequently I ought to have been a monster, and indeed was so near it that I came forth literally torn from my mother's womb. 1 In De Consolatione (Liber III, Opera, Tom. I, p. 619), Cardano mentions 24 Sep-tember 1501 as his date of birth. All editions of the Vita give 1500. In his horo-scope, however, Cardano gives the date and hour of his birth as 24 September 1501, at 6:40, the hora noctis prima being six o'clock according to the old Italian method of reckoning; see note 1 in Cardano 2002 [1653], 258.

My hair was black and curly. I was revived in a bath of warm wine, which might have been fatal to any other child. My mother had been in labor for three entire days, and yet I survived. Besides, to return to the horoscope, since the sun, both malefics, and Venus and Mercury were in the human signs, I did not deviate from the human form. Since Jupiter was in the ascendant and Venus ruled the horoscope, I was not maimed, save in the genitals, so that from my twenty-first to my thirty-first year I was unable to lie with women, and many a time I lamented my fate, envying every other man his own good fortune. Although Venus was, as I have said, ruler of the whole nativity, and Jupiter in the ascendant, unfortunate indeed was my destiny; I was endowed with a stuttering tongue and a disposition midway between the cold and the harpocratic—using Ptolemy's classification—that is to say, gifted with a kind of intense and instinctive desire to prophesy. In this sort of thing—it is called prescience, to use a better expression—as well as in other methods of divining the future, I have been clearly successful at times. [...] I could [...] have escaped some of the consequences of entering my existence with a genesis—as Ptolemy calls it—so wretched and luckless, had the sun itself not been directly in its fall, cadent in the sixth house and removed from its own exaltation. I was gifted, therefore, with a certain cunning only, and a mind by no means at liberty; my every judgment is, in truth, either too harsh or too forbidding. In a word, I shall say that I am a man bereft of bodily strength, with few friends, small means, many enemies—a very large part of whom I recognize neither by name nor by face—a man without ordinary human wisdom, inclined to be faulty of memory, though rather better in the matter of foreseeing events. Yet withal, my condition in life, to be deemed lowly if one considers my family and my betters, is, for some unknown reason, regarded as honorable and worthy of emulation among these same. (Cardano 2002 [1653], 5-7) I quoted this introduction at length because it gives a very good impression of the particular style of Cardano's self-description. He wrote down his autobi-ography in 1575 and 1576 in Rome, but it was published only in 1643. Along with Benvenuto Cellini's famous Vita, Cardano's De vita propria is usually regarded as the most important autobiography of the Renaissance.2 But while Cellini sketched his adventurous life with a focus on the outward aspects of his career (see Cervigni 1979; Goldberg 1974; Hösle 1975), Cardano trans-formed the autobiographical genre into an in-depth study of his own person-ality, his character and feelings. In the words of Roy Pascal: \"In Cellini and Cardano we have two extremes of autobiography: Cellini presents himself, Cardano analyses himself' (Pascal 1960, 31). Cardano does not describe his life in a chronological way but structures his account according to questions like \"My Health,\" \"Customs, Vices, and Errors,\" \"Virtues and Constancy,\" or \"Concerning my Enemies and Rivals.\" He tackles \"My Will\" and the 2 See, for others, Cervigni 1979, 22; Sturrock 1993, 64-81. One of the earliest Italian autobiographies is Francesco Petrarca's De studiorum suorum successibus ad pos-teritatem epistola (\"Letter to posterity\", c. 1370). Petrarca notes that he was the first to write such a report of his life (quod ante me, ut arbitror, fecit nemo, Petr. epp. var. 25). On Petrarca, see Misch 1969, 577-582; Guglielminetti 1977, 101-158; Sturrock 1993, 60-63. On Cellini, see Misch 1969, 631-640; Guglielminetti 1977, 292-386; on Cardano, see particularly Misch 1969, 657-738 (\"Die Formen reflek-tierter Selbstdarstellung.

In fact, we can say that this scholar stands at the beginning of psychological astrology (see von Stuckrad 2003, 228-232). And what is more, his is one of the earliest examples of a modern autobiography. Jonathan Goldberg con-cludes: \"whereas modern autobiography unveils a unique, personal and pri-vate self, early autobiography presents a universal, depersonalized and public version of the self' (Goldberg 1974, 71). Cardano, the physician, \"feels his own pulse,\" as Jacob Burckhardt said in his Romantic praise of Cardano,3 and in so doing Cardano does not shrink from a minute analysis of his psy-chological shortcomings. His intention is not a heroic presentation of a repre-sentative life such as the ancient self-fashioning of Marcus Aurelius with its Stoic virtues—a model Cardano looked up to—but a precise analysis of his character in the light of astrological scrutiny.4 While these characteristics have frequently been noted in secondary literature, interestingly enough most interpreters do not comment on the use of astrological interpretation in this autobiography.5 In fact, I have found very little indication that historians were interested at all in the relationship be-tween the analysis of one's birth-chart and the presentation of one's life. This is surprising, because for Cardano—and also for others to be discussed later—the horoscope served as a powerful instrument of analysis. Whereas in earlier discourses publishing horoscopes was often a means to mythologize one's own destiny—the Roman emperors and the Florentine Medici are prominent examples—for Cardano it was an instrument of demythologiza-3 Burckhardt 1922 [1860], 247. Burckhardt's nineteenth-century audience was so well acquainted with De vita propria that the author found it inappropriate to recall its content: \"Doch ist es uns hier nicht erlaubt, ein so stark verbreitetes, in jeder Biblio-thek vorhandenes Buch zu exzerpieren\" (p. 248). Anthony Grafton notes: \"Though Burckhardt was fascinated by some of the forms that astrological practice and the-ory took in medieval and early modern Italy, he did not see the art as an integral part of Renaissance culture. For the most part, in fact, he treated it as an obstacle to the free development of individuality. But he recognized, as later historians sometimes have not, that a practitioner of this ancient discipline could describe the condition of modernity\" (1999, 198). 4 On ancient autobiographies, see Misch 1950; Pascal 1960, 21-26. On Cardano's relation to Marcus Aurelius, see Misch 1969, 710; Grafton 1999, 195f. 5 Goldberg, for instance, talks of \"providence\" and \"mystery\" instead of astrology: \"Cardan's account reveals a belief in the role of providence. Accompanied by an at-tendant spirit, Cardan receives mysterious signs and tokens\" (1974, 75). Notable ex-ceptions to this neglect of astrology are Georg Misch who treats Cardano's \"Astro-logie und Anthropologie\" in a chapter of its own (Misch 1969, 700-709), and Anthony Grafton in his seminal work on Cardano (Grafton 1999, see particularly pp. 178-198).

The importance of my life is that I made it despite this horo-scope. I accepted my fate, not heroically but with a certain sense of humor, with support of my guardian angel, and with respect for the rulings of fate.\" I am inclined to call this position a playful Stoic attitude, a Stoicism stripped of its severe gravity.7 2. Broadening the Perspective: Horoscopes and Narratives in the Seventeenth Century Important as it was, Cardano's De vita propria was by no means an isolated phenomenon in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe. It was part of Renaissance culture's ongoing interest in biographical narratives, and this at all levels of society. While the learned \"humanists forced the facts of their subject's life to fit the often inconvenient outlines of existing literary lasts\" (Grafton 1999, 181) and the well-known rhetorics from antiquity, recent scholarship reveals that there also existed many so-called 'ego-documents,' stretching from private family sagas to interrogation protocols in early mod-ern Europe (see Mayer and Woolf 1995; Schulze 1996). In order to contextu-alize Cardano's autobiography, two related issues seem particularly interesting here—the genre of astrologically informed biographies and the use of astrology in empiric medicine. 2.1. Astrological Biographies Steven vanden Broecke has pointed out that collections of horoscopes were extremely prominent in early modern Europe.8 These collections were often set up not only for reasons of private curiosity, but also for empirical research to test and improve astrological theory and prediction. This is true for Car-6 See Hösle 1975. Helmut Pfeiffer calls this the \"melancholy of writing\": \"There is no better formulation for the genesis of his marginality and his written relationship to himself than the description of the deformities predicted by his horoscope, a de-scription retrospectively providing a clear example of his social dysfunction\" (Pfeif-fer 1994,235). 7 In his treatment of Cardano's Stoicism, Misch (1969, 707-709) correctly observes that although much of ancient philosophy is found in De vita propria, something new was taking form because \"das entscheidende Prinzip der Erhebung über Natur und Schicksal war für Cardano nicht in der abstrakten Vernunftregel gelegen. Etwas Neues bereitete sich in ihm vor, eine auf erfahrungsmäßige Erkenntnis des eigenen Ich und des Weltwesens gegründete Methode bewußter Lebensführung' (p. 709). 8 See his contribution to the present volume.

They eventually provided material for biographies, as the following three examples reveal. An obsessive reader of Cardano and Gaurico, Sir Thomas Smith, who eventually became a royal secretary and ambassador to France under Eliza-beth, studied the horoscope collections of his famous teachers after 1555 and subsequently came up with an astrological biography of his own. He gave a detailed account of his illnesses, his ups and downs, and related these to his natal horoscope; in addition, he also speculated about the future of others, including his illegitimate son's highly depressing prospects.9 The Englishman John Aubrey (1625-1697)10 spent the better part of his later life collecting nativities of famous and less famous people, subse-quently comparing these with the respective events of their lives. For, as he wrote, \"[t]he Transits of the Planets by their Radicall places & Aspects are worth any gentl<eman's> serious observation.\"11 From the 1670s onwards, Aubrey used astrological techniques as a corner-stone of his research. The horoscopic predictions were mainly made by his friend Henry Coley,12 one of the most important astrologers of Restoration England, and the adopted son of the famous William Lilly (1602-1681; see von Stuckrad 2003, 270-274). The result was an impressive collection of Brief Lives that gives an outline of over one hundred biographies.13 Hence, we have here a hybrid of astrological almanacs and biographical research. \"The biographies in the Brief Lives manuscripts are often written around horoscopes, showing that these were more than mere appendages to his narrative, and another of Aubrey's manu-scripts, his Collectio Geniturarum, compiled in the 1670s, is merely a series of horoscopes\" (Hunter 1975, 121). 9 On Smith and his similarly interesting protege and relative, Gabriel Harvey, friend and counselor to Philip Sidney and Edmund Spencer, see Grafton 1999, 103f., 185f., and 191f. (with the references given there); see also his critical remark about Dewar 1964 on p. 258 note 67 (interestingly enough, both \"astrology\" and \"horo-scopes\" are lacking in the index to Dewar 1964). 10 According to his own account, he was born on \"March the 12 (St. Gregorie's day) A.D. 1625, about Sun-riseing, being very weake and like to dye that he was Christ-ned before morning prayer\" (Dick 1958, xviii). 11 MS A 23, 66; quoted from Hunter 1975, 117. On the development of astrology in early modern England, see Curry 1989 and 1991. 12 Coley became famous with his two astrological handbooks Clavis Astrologiae (London, 1669) and Clavis Astrologiae elimata (London, 1676). 13 That these biographies originate from a horoscope collection is not acknowledged by the editor, O. L. Dick, who plays down Aubrey's astrological interests (see Dick 1958, lxv). Anthony Grafton (1999, 194) correctly notes that this is due to the \"typi-cal disdain for astrology\" by modern editors; see also Hunter 1975 who strongly emphasizes the astrological element in Aubrey's life and works.

The Astrological Diary of the Rye merchant Samuel Jeake (1652-1699) diligently notes every aspect of his life—stretching from illnesses he suffered and personal events to political and economic developments in England—and links these in a fully empirical way14 to the particular astrological configuration on the respective days.15 Quite contrary to common views in historiography, \"the way in which Jeake's account juxtaposes astrology with the new aspirations of late Stuart England should illustrate the dangers of uncritically presuming that all the progressive forces of his day were equally antithetic to astrology\" (Hunter and Gregory 1988, 76).16 2.2. Medical Narratives From the examples given so far it has become apparent already that health in general and medical issues in particular form a crucial element of these bio-graphical accounts. This is not by chance. In a culture where medicine and astrology were closely related disciplines, the empirical scrutiny of illnesses and their development in time quite naturally had its impact on astrologically informed biographies.17 In her seminal analysis, Girolamo Cardano and Ren-aissance Medicine, Nancy G. Siraisi recently showed that Cardano and his contemporaries used astrology in their biographical accounts to understand the relation between particular instance and general rule. [Cardano] often pur-sued this goal by way of retroactive analysis of narrated examples. This procedure is conso-nant with his entire approach to mastering knowledge and exactly parallels uses he made of two other narrative disciplines with which he was engaged, astrology and history. But he was also, simultaneously, participating in what may be thought of (not entirely accurately) as the Renaissance prehistory of the case history; his accounts, like those of other medical writers, both depend on sources and models within earlier traditions of medical narrative and reflect contemporary developments. (Siraisi 1997, 196) With her focus on the narrative structure of both autobiography and medicine 14 In fact, Jeake's Diary belongs to the same genre of 'inductive' empirical scrutiny as the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries (see von Stuckrad 2003, 61-63), despite its quite different context. 15 The full title of the book is A Diary of the Actions & Accidents of my Life: tending partly to observe & memorize the Providences therein manifested; & partly to in-vestigate the Measure of Time in Astronomical Directions, and to determine the As-tra/1 Causes, &c. Rye, Begun July 12 1694. 16 It may be noted in passing that this document is also valuable as an astrological source for fleshing out historical details of life in Stuart England. 17 See also Monica Azzolini's contribution to the present volume.

On the other hand, it is important to note that biography and identity are formed in a mode of narration. I will come back to this latter aspect of astrological bio-graphies, but before doing so, let me bring in another famous example of an autobiography that starts with the analysis of the author's geniture. 3. Goethe: The Geniture between Poetry and Truth On the 28th of August, 1749, when the bell struck twelve noon, I came into the world in Frankfurt on the Main. The constellation was lucky: The sun was in Virgo and culminating for the day; Jupiter and Venus were looking friendly at it, Mercury not repulsively, Saturn and Mars behaved indifferently; only the moon, which was almost full at the moment, ex-erted the power of its opposition even more so because his planetary hour was just begin-ning. Hence, the moon resisted my birth, which could only take place after this hour was over. These favorite aspects, which the astrologers later credited high against me, may well be the reason for my surviving: Because due to the clumsiness of the midwife I was born as dead and was brought to see the light only after manifold efforts. This circumstance, however, which caused much distress for my people, turned out to be an advantage for my fellow citizens because my grandfather, the village mayor Johann Wolfgang Textor, took this incident to hire an obstetrician and to inaugurate or improve the education of midwifes. This was for the benefit of many a future generation.19 18 See her whole chapter, \"Historia, Narrative, and Medicine,\" in Siraisi 1997, 195-213. That \"[m]edicine is, indeed, in fundamental ways a narrative discipline, al-though the form the narrative takes—and by whom it is told—has varied greatly over time\" (Siraisi 1997, 195), is argued by other scholars, as well; see particularly Hunter 1991 and, more generally, Dear 1991. 19 \"Am 28. August 1749, mittags mit dem Glockenschlage zwölf, kam ich in Frankfurt am Main auf die Welt. Die Konstellation war glücklich: die Sonne stand im Zeichen der Jungfrau und kulminierte für den Tag; Jupiter und Venus blickten sie freundlich an, Merkur nicht widerwärtig, Saturn und Mars verhielten sich gleichgültig; nur der Mond, der soeben voll ward, übte die Kraft seines Gegenscheins um so mehr, als zugleich seine Planetenstunde eingetreten war. Er widersetzte sich daher meiner Geburt, die nicht eher erfolgen konnte, als bis diese Stunde vorübergegangen. Diese guten Aspekten [sie], welche mir die Astrologen in der Folgezeit sehr hoch anzurechnen wußten, mögen wohl Ursache an meiner Erhaltung gewesen sein: denn durch Ungeschicklichkeit der Hebamme kam ich für tot auf die Welt, und nur durch vielfache Bemühungen brachte man es dahin, daß ich das Licht erblickte. Dieser Umstand, welcher die Meinigen in große Not versetzt hatte, gereichte jedoch meinen Mitbürgern zum Vorteil, indem mein Großvater, der Schultheiß Johann Wolfgang Textor, daher Anlaß nahm, daß ein Geburtshelfer angestellt und der Hebammen-Unterricht eingeführt oder erneuert wurde; welches denn manchem der Nachgeborenen mag zugute gekommen sein\" (Goethe 1911 [1811], 5; all transla-tions from German are mine).

There is no doubt that Goethe respected Cardano's De vita propria (see Weintraub 1978, 352; Grafton 1999, 180), and the similarity in presentation is not with-out meaning. The conscious construction of Dichtung und Wahrheit that be-gan in 180921 has to be seen in a wider context. In 1777/1778, Goethe had published the first part of Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling's Lebensgeschichte·, in the 1790s he had translated Cellini's Vita; and with his Schrift über Win-ckelmann (1805) and the Biographie Hackerts (1811) he had already taken steps towards a new understanding of the biographical genre. Goethe ab-horred the usual self-fashioning in biographical narrative and anecdotal ap-proaches to a person, weighing the good and bad elements of one's character or boring the audience with a confession of one's shortcomings. These were the works of what he called \"Nekrologen,\"22 \"the dull product of hacks who pieced together the lives of great men, without a scrap of insight into their subjects, without any sense of human growth bursting forth out of the live background of the age\" (Bowman 1971, 11). As the title Dichtung und Wahrheit indicates, it was Goethe's intention to show the 'truth behind the facts,' because, as he argued, a fact, even if it is true, is only important if it has meaning.23 'Truth' (Wahrheit) means the gradual formation of his per-sonality; 'poetry' (Dichtung) means the description of possibilities and latent potentials that were important in a creative process, even if they did not manifest in concrete situations. Following an ideal in freemasonry,24 Goethe presents to the audience the constant work on his own character, the carving and refinement of an artist's personality. Consequently, he sees the genre of biographical narrative as a therapeutic and pedagogical means to educate the people. 20 Goethe worked on his autobiography for decades; the fourth part, comprising Books 16-20, was not published until after his death. Of the many works on Dichtung und Wahrheit see Misch 1969, 917-955; Bowman 1971, which is a brief and sympa-thetic introduction close to Goethe's own writings; Sturrock 1993, 172-181; on its reception see Aichinger 1977; Wefelmeyer 1981. 21 On 11 October 1809 Goethe wrote in his diary: \"Schema einer Biographie\"; see Bowman 1971, 11. 22 In a letter to Zelter dated 29 May 1801. Among the biographies Goethe stood out against are St. Augustine's Confessiones in antiquity, Karl Philipp Moritz's Anton Reiser (1785-1790), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Les Confessions (1782-1789). 23 Goethe in a letter to Zelter from 1830.

Playing with Fragments: Joseph von Eichendorff Goethe's autobiography had a tremendous impact on later generations of au-thors. It was at the same time the last attempt at presenting a meaningful, coherent account of the gradual unfolding of a personality and the beginning of a new understanding of the conditio humana that emerged in Romanti-cism. The possibility of attaining coherence in literature was increasingly brought into question during the first half of the nineteenth century. With regard to autobiographical narrative two extreme positions have been taken, represented by Franz Grillparzer (1791-1872) and Christian Friedrich Hebbel (1813-1863). Both authors left fragmentary accounts of their lives that were only published posthumously (see Kunisch 1985, 38-42). Grillparzer, on the one hand, noted in his diary (September 1827) that \"if I ever should hap-pen—which I will never do—to write down the sequence of my inner states, people would think that they read the pathogenesis of a lunatic.\"26 Hebbel, on the other hand, claimed the right of the classic autobiography: \"Those who describe their lives should, as Goethe did, emphasize only the charming, the beautiful, the appeasing, the balancing, which can be found even in the dark-est conditions, and leave the rest unnoticed.\"27 This, obviously, was no longer possible for Hebbel himself. In their contrast, both positions reflect the new social and cultural conditions of the nineteenth century which differed fun-25 Bowman 1971, 11, refers to this famous sentence without indicating its astrological background. Cf. Misch 1969, 933. 26 \"Wenn ich je dazu kommen sollte—aber ich werde es nie tun—die Geschichte der Folge meiner innern Zustände niederzuschreiben, so würde man glauben, die Krankheitsgeschichte eines Wahnsinnigen zu lesen.\" And he goes on: \"Das Unzu-sammenhängende, Widersprechende, Launenhafte, Stoßweise darin übersteigt alle Vorstellung. Heute Eis, morgen in Flammen. Jetzt geistig und physisch unmächtig, gleich darauf überfließend, unbegrenzt.

Truth and fiction, self knowledge and literary construction, classical ideals and new uncertainties, were in a state of tension; this ultimately led to the disintegration of the entire genre of autobiography.28 Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (1788-1857), one of the leading pro-ponents of German Romanticism, is a good example of this changed situa-tion. His approach to autobiographical narrative can best be described as a playful palimpsest and a consequent transgression of literary genres. Eichen-dorff never wrote a formal autobiography; instead, he inserted fragments of his life in various formal ways—in novellas, pseudepigraphic texts, poems, novels, etc. (see Kunisch 1985, 43-46). The experimental character of his autobiographical writings applies to the use of astrological symbolism as well. His \"Kapitel von meiner Geburt\" (\"Chapter Concerning My Birth\"), clearly a reference to Goethe's account, has the following to tell: The winter of 1788 was so cold that the nails of the roofs cracked, the poor birds during their sleep fell from the trees, and deer, rabbits, and wolves—completely confused—flew into the villages. [...] My father stood nervously at the window, blew the beautiful frostwork off the window pane, and looked at the starry sky. The constellation was extremely auspicious. Jupiter and Venus flickered in a friendly manner at the white roofs; the moon stood in Virgo and was to culminate straightaway.29 Like Goethe's, Eichendorffs nativity was ruled by an auspicious aspect of Jupiter and Venus accompanied by a fortunate moon. But then, as Eichen-dorff reports, the scene was disturbed by the arrival of a coach, bringing not the doctor but a strange man (whose identity is not revealed). This disturb-ance had fatal consequences: 28 This is Kunisch's thesis: \"Das autobiographische Fragment erhält von daher einen bedingt formalen Status, es wird als 'Unform' zum authentischen Ausdruck der Gat-tungsproblematik.

[...] [Mein Vater] trat [...] unruhig ans Fenster, hauchte die prächtigen Eisblumen von den Scheiben und betrachtete den weiten gestirnten Himmel. Die Konstellation war überaus günstig.

My father, when he heard the cry of a baby, looked frightened at the sky: the moon had just culminated! I was almost born at the auspicious hour, I was only one and a half minutes too late, and was born confusingly with the feet first; one says that thus I made an entrechat. However, that I missed the wonderful aspects, the right constellation, has annoyed me to the present day, like the poor boy who almost received a cake during the wedding. Otherwise, it would have really been a pushover for me: a rich wife, a medal, excellent con-tacts and protections, instead of a bony shape, a distinguished ä plomb, or even an honor in the morning newspaper.30 Eichendorff concludes his fragment with a pious acceptance of the fate that has been given to all humans by God, and even those pushed down by a fatal constellation are given the talent and power of a \"holy will\" to gain a bal-anced life—a playful Stoic attitude combined with a pious Christian devo-tion. The author seems to insert the interpretation of his nativity—mainly by his father, interestingly enough—to engage the difficult relationship be-tween divine determination and free will. The conditio humana had become uncertain; the old model of complex symmetry in the stars had lost its reas-suring quality. Stronger than in Goethe, a playful attitude to the importance of astrological inquiry enters the stage.31 At the same time, however, Eichen-dorff implicitly acknowledged his father's reading of his nativity as valid, and thus took his fatal constellation as an expression of a divine impetus to strive for a successful life. An intertextual presence of Cardano's De vita pro-pria is evident. 30 \"[D]er Fremde nahm schnell eine Handvoll Schnee und rieb sich damit die halber-frorne Nase, der Kutscher fluchte, der Schnee knirschte unter den Tritten, der Hof-hund bellte—da wurde ich in der Stube neben dem Tafelzimmer geboren.

Daß ich aber, trotz der vortrefflichen Aspekten, die rechte Konstellation verpaßt, verdrießt mich noch bis auf den heutigen Tag, wie jenen armen Jungen, der bei der Hochzeit beinah einen Kuchen bekommen hätte.

Horoscopes and the Narrative Construction of Identity The examples I have discussed reveal quite different functions of the use of horoscopes in autobiographical narratives. Referring to one's nativity can mythologize and legitimate the course of one's life, provide it a sort of inevi-tability, and serve as a red thread that structures the development and unfold-ing of one's personality and circumstances. It can also demythologize one's life by setting it in the context of a higher interpretive register, or by illustrat-ing the relation between general rule and individual case in astrological re-search. Despite the functional differences, it is easy to detect common fea-tures in all biographies. The most obvious commonality is the fact that we are dealing here with textual or, more generally, with narrative constructions. The horoscope is introduced intentionally as a rhetorical device which con-structs a subtext underlying the narrative. It inserts a separate level of mean-ing independent from yet linked to the plot of one's life. And it adds meaning to the narration by providing a red thread and a higher importance to a life that could otherwise be quite ordinary. 4.1. The Narrative Structure of Identity Now we may ask if this observation can be generalized. My answer is \"yes\"; and to substantiate this answer I make use of psychological and histo-riographical research into the formation of identity.32 Constructivist ap-proaches in psychotherapy derive from the thesis that the most interesting task of psychotherapy is to substitute painful interpretations of one's life with less painful ones, rather than to find out the 'truth' about one's character (see Neimeyer and Mahoney 1995). The individual arranges past and present in a coherent and plausible structure, a process in which the construction of one's biography is itself a mode of adding meaning to life (see Straub 1998). The construction of biographical identity is by no means—as the common notion of 'patchwork-identity' suggests—an arbitrary act of invention; it is a com-plex process of organizing experience with a necessary selection of data. As J. A. van Beizen exemplified with a nineteenth-century conversion narrative,33 it is particularly fruitful to apply recent psychological approaches to the study of biography. Dan P. McAdams (1993 and 1999), for instance, says that every person has an individual myth that one \"lives by\" (see also Campbell 1972). This personal myth, however, is by no means fixed. The 32 For a more detailed analysis with a focus on conversion narratives, see Kippenberg and von Stuckrad 2003, 136-146 (with further references). 33 Van Beizen 2004; see particularly ch. 3 (\"De bronnen van het zelf—Autobiografie en zelfpresentatie\") on pp. 139-266.

Hermans and Kempen (1993; see also Hermans and Dimaggio 2004) argue that the human self is a text that is constantly being reworked. The author of a life story is not the sovereign cen-ter of control, but negotiates a dialogue between several ego-positions— positions and perspectives that occasionally even contradict one another. The linkage between constructivist approaches in psychology and in cultural stud-ies is this simple fact: the formation of biographical identity is only possible in a mode of narration. The very term 'biography' reveals the narrative ele-ment of this construction that follows an identifiable pattern in which certain events are seen as meaningful and central, while other events are arranged around these centers (Ulmer 1988; Stenger 1993). 4.2. Horoscopes and Emplotment Evidence for this mechanism comes from literary studies as well. Hayden White scrutinized the famous historiographical narratives of the nineteenth century and argued that the phenomena are constituted and prefigured by the manner of presentation the author chooses. The historical fact is itself the product of the narration; language is not only the form but also the content (White 1973; cf. Kippenberg and von Stuckrad 2003, 38-40). The inevitable structuring of otherwise meaningless or, more precisely, unconnected events, White calls emplotment, i.e. the creation of a plot or structure. In his concrete presentation, the author makes use of certain classical devices known from ancient rhetoric—the so-called tropes,34 What has this to do with horoscopes in biographies? Quite a lot. The horoscope is the crystallizing point of emplotment in autobiography. It signi-fies the underlying unity of seemingly incoherent and disconnected phenom-ena. It is an element of the text, both literally and functionally; but it is more than that too: it is itself a text to be decoded in the subsequent chapters of autobiographical narrative. Using the horoscope prefigures and constitutes the biography's content, or, as Anthony Grafton says regarding Cardano: \"Astrology shaped content as well as form, since it played a crucial role in Cardano's willingness to reveal the secrets of his bedrooms and bathrooms\" (1999, 184). Put more generally: \"Astrology offered a language for describ-ing the indescribable, the momentary, the felt, in late recollection\" (Grafton 1999, 197). 34 These four basic tropes are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony; see White 1973, introduction. An important contribution to the relationship between narrative discourse and historical representation is White 1987, particularly chapters 1 and 2.

It is a metaphor because the horoscope expresses the biography's data by way of analogy drawn from astrological tradition.35 And it is a synecdoche because the horoscope reveals the intrinsic quality of the biography; by using the trope of synecdoche, it is possible to integrate both parts into a whole that is qualitatively distinguished from the parts, which are only microcosmic reproductions of the whole. I conclude my analysis with the observation that these functions of a birth chart are not limited to autobiographical texts alone. If we take into ac-count that identities in general are shaped by discursive practices and that they have a narrative foundation, every horoscope reading serves the need of providing people with a meaningful interpretation of their lives.36 No matter whether this reading represents the 'truth' of one's personality, it is definitely a means of emplotment, since it prefigures and pre-structures the understand-ing of a life.

Pfaff and the Rediscovery of Astrology in the Age of Romanticism GÜNTHER OESTMANN 1. Introduction: The Crisis of Astrology After Isaac Newton (1642-1727) had explained the planetary orbits by grav-ity and given physical reasons for Kepler's descriptive laws of planetary mo-tion, astronomy made great progress in the course of the eighteenth century, profiting largely from the rapid advances in mathematics. In his Mecanique celeste (\"Celestial Mechanics\"), which appeared between 1799 and 1825, Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749-1827) treated all motions in the solar system as a purely mathematical problem. He could demonstrate that the solar sys-tem—notwithstanding all perturbations—is highly stable. It was taken as a huge mechanism driven by the universal force of gravitation with eternal movements. With the skillfully devised theory laid down by Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777-1855) in his Theoria motus corporum coelestium (1809), these movements could be calculated and predicted very accurately. Computing the orbits of celestial bodies became the foremost task of astronomy in the nine-teenth century. Moreover, in his Exposition du systeme du monde (\"Exposi-tion of the World System,\" 1796), Laplace postulated an evolutionary development of the solar system from an entirely different original state, a train of thought already developed by Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) in 1755. There was good reason to assume that also human affairs would reach a simi-lar level of perfection under the rule of freedom, reason, and science. During this period astrology saw a rapid decline. Apart from England, where the situation was somewhat different, there was virtually no public interest, and the intellectual climate of the Age of Enlightenment was unfa-vorable. So, at the end of the eighteenth century, astrology was almost dead, at least as far as Germany is concerned. Astrology was no longer tolerated among astronomers, who were busy hunting for new comets and computing their orbits as well as the four minor planets between Mars and Jupiter, which had been discovered at the beginning of the nineteenth century. But a move-ment arose in opposition to a completely mechanistic view of the cosmos.

Here nature was viewed as a work of art constructed by a divine imagination and veiled in emblematic language. It was an organically unified whole, not, as rationalists would have it, a system of mechanical laws and mathematically defined mo-tions. The notion of the clockwork universe, in which God had only wound up the mainspring, was replaced by an organic image. Symbolism and myth were given greater prominence. Placed above the supremacy of reason, imagination became the supreme faculty of the human mind. Only imagina-tion allowed man to read nature as a system of symbols. Intuition, instincts, and feelings were seen as necessary supplements to logic and reason. Conse-quently, August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767—1845) spoke of a missing sense of the miraculous as a consequence of Enlightenment in his lectures Über Lit-eratur, Kunst und Geist des Zeitalters (\"On Literature, Art and Spirit of the Age,\" 1803). Men thought only in categories of quantity and utility. There-fore, astronomy had to become astrology again because the observer of the heavens was far more elevated if he believed in the stars' assistance as if he were a bondsman of nature. A similar train of thought can be found in the writings of Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis, 1772-1801). Johann Wolf-gang Goethe's (1749-1832) description of his own horoscope in his autobi-ography Dichtung und Wahrheit (1811/1833) is well known.1 Confined to literature and philosophy, this aesthetic and symbolic reception of astrology was separated from the rapid development of the natural sciences at the turn of the nineteenth century. Only one natural scientist tried crossing the bor-der—and he was met with a heavy barrage of criticism. 2. Enter J. W. A. Pfaff Johann Wilhelm Andreas Pfaff was born on 5 December 1774 in Stuttgart. From 1791 on he studied in the famous Protestant Theological Seminar, called \"Stift,\" in Tübingen (Hermelink, Bürk, and Wille 1906/54, 3: 355, nr. 38850). There was a considerable spirit of opposition among the students at this time—the new revolutionary ideas from France had even reached Tübin-gen's theologians who lived in almost monastic seclusion (Leube 1921/54, 2: 115ff.; Hahn and Mayer 1985, 54-58). The extant regular assessments con-tain harsh criticisms. Despite Pfaff being second best in the final examina-tions in 1796, one can find the caustic remark \"Studia theologica non plane neglexit\"—he did not neglect theological studies entirely.2 Although becom-1 See Kocku von Stuckrad's contribution to the present volume. 2 \"Joannes Guilielmus Andreas Pfaff, Stuttgardianus, Friderici Burcardi, Consiliarii aulici ibidem filius, nat. 1774.

He must have had close contact with Christoph Friedrich Pfleiderer (173 6-1821),4 professor of mathematics and physics, and probably also with his successor Johann Gottlieb Friedrich Bohnenberger (1765-1831), who was appointed as professor of mathematics and astronomy in 1798. The observatory was lo-cated in the castle of Hohentübingen in the immediate vicinity of the \"Stift.\" In 1802 the University of Dorpat (Tartu) in Estonia (then belonging to the Russian Empire) had been reopened. Georg Friedrich Parrot (1767-1852) became Rector and offered a position as professor of mathematics to Pfaff s elder brother Johann Friedrich (1765-1825), who was then a professor of mathematics in Helmstedt. Although he was willing to accept, the University of Helmstedt did everything possible to keep him, even raising his salary. Therefore he recommended his younger brother for the position. Desiring to appoint candidates for the newly opened university from among his associ-ates, Parrot told the council of Dorpat University that he knew the character of Johann Friedrich Pfaff thoroughly. Thus the soundness of his brother's recommendation was sufficiently guaranteed. But there were three other pos-sible candidates for the post: Carl Friedrich Gauß, Johann Karl Burckhardt (1773-1825), a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris, and Johann Anton Ide (1775-1806), a private lecturer from Göttingen. To achieve a vote between Pfaff and Ide only, Parrot tried to eliminate both Gauß and Burck-hardt as candidates, remarking that Gauß would not leave Brunswick since the duke had promised to build an observatory for him. Burckhardt had al-ready been appointed as successor to Joseph-Jeröme de Lalande (1732— 1807), astronomer at the Military Academy of Paris, and—horribile dictu— had accepted the citizenship of a revolutionary republic. Parrot's strategy was successful, and the commission nominated Pfaff as professor of mathematics and astronomy.5 He arrived in Estonia in spring 1804, also becoming director of a projected observatory, but building activi-ties did not start until 1809. In the meantime, Pfaff made astronomical obser-vations under primitive conditions in an attic.

Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert In 1804 Pfaff married Pauline von Patkul, a noble woman from Livland, but life in Dorpat was very expensive at this time, and many professors— including Pfaff—ran into increasing debt (Levickij 1899, 27-30). Moreover, the administration of Dorpat University was restrictive, which caused many problems,7 so Pfaff left Dorpat in 1809 before the observatory had been com-pleted, and received a teaching post at the Nuremberg Realinstitut. Heading the institute was Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert (1780-1860), a natural philoso-pher who had been trained in medicine at Jena. Schubert was a pupil of Jo-hann Friedrich Schelling (1775-1854) and had studied galvanism with Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776-1810).8 In 1807/08 Schubert delivered a series of public lectures on natural history, psychology, and animal magnetism in Dresden, which were published under the title Ansichten von der Nachtseite 6 Tartu, Eesti Ajalooarhiiv (Estonian Historical Archive): Best. 402, Verz. 3, A. 1969. 7 In 1809 Olbers wrote to Gauß, who had been proposed as successor to Pfaff: \"Nur mit wenigen Zeilen sage ich Ihnen [...] Dank [...] und eile nur noch hinzuzufügen, daß ich hier das Vergnügen habe, mit dem Professor Pfaff aus Kiel [...] umzugehen, und daß mir dieser sehr nachtheilige Schilderung von der Lage der Professoren in Dorpat gemacht hat. Sein Bruder hatte dort 2500 Rubel, welches aber bei der Theu-erung wenig sein soll, und fand überhaupt seine dortigen Verhältnisse so unange-nehm, daß er sich um eine Stelle am Gymnasium zu Stuttgart, die 800 fl. einträgt, jedoch unter Ausbedingung einiger nicht bewilligter Nebenvortheile vergebens be-worben, und jetzt eine Stelle von 1000 fl. bei dem Institut zu Nürnberg angenom-men hat. Pfaff versicherte mich, die Schuld der Unzufriedenheit seines Bruders in Dorpat liege nicht etwa in dem individuellen Charakter desselben oder seiner Un-verträglichkeit, und er könne, dies waren seine Worte, keinem seiner Freunde, der anderweitig sein Auskommen habe, rathen, nach Dorpat zu gehen. Besonders sei der Kurator dieser Universität, Hr. v. Klinger, ein äußerst unangenehmer Mann für die Professoren. Kasan sei Dorpat in aller Rücksicht für das Auskommen sowohl, als das angenehme Leben weit vorzuziehen, und man möge ja in dem so theuren Dorpat sich nicht durch anscheinend große Besoldungen täuschen lassen.- Ich habe mich, wie sich von selbst versteht, Ihretwegen, lieber Gauß, nichts merken lassen, halte es aber für meine Schuldigkeit, Ihnen diese Aussage sogleich zu referiren. Der Theil derselben, das unschickliche Benehmen des Kurators gegen die Professoren betreffend, wurde auch von einem anderen hier anwesenden Gelehrten, dem Leib-medikus Sterglitz aus Hannover, bestätigt. Sehen Sie sich also vor, mein theuerster Freund, ehe Sie sich für D[orpat] bestimmen\" (Schilling 1894/1909, 2.1, 438). 8 There is no comprehensive treatment of Schubert available, but see Engelhardt 1980 and Merkel 1913.

Pfaff and the Rediscovery of Astrology in the Age of Romanticism 245 der Naturwissenschaft (\"Views from the Dark Side of Natural Science\") in five editions through 1840. The \"dark side\" of natural science Schubert treated were elements and appearances inexplicable by rationalistic science or simply unknown. With their emphasis on irrationality, fantasy, and vision, these lectures had a lasting influence on Romanticism and made him an in-stant celebrity (Gregory 1995), influencing many poets, including Ε. T. A. Hoffmann, Justinus Kerner, and Heinrich von Kleist. Only an outline of Schubert's ideas expressed in a vast number of books with revealing titles, like Ahndungen einer allgemeinen Geschichte des Lebens (\"Presentiments of a General History of Life,\" Leipzig 1806/21), can be given here. His publications were enormously popular, running through numerous editions. Schubert had a deep appreciation of the religious meaning of nature, and saw all things as existing in spiritual interconnection, resulting in a co-herent physical and historical existence. Thus no part of human experience should be ignored or omitted, and for Schubert the history of science was fundamentally important for understanding man and nature both past and future. Evidence for deeper insights could be found in extinct civilizations and cultures. The oldest of all the sciences was astronomy. Indeed, astro-nomical knowledge was revealed to mankind from a higher spirit and had immediately attained the highest perfection (Schubert 1808, 29, 33). This ancient all-embracing knowledge had been obscured over the course of his-tory, although some of its traces could still be found in astrology and al-chemy. In the beginning of the modern age new impulses had been released, but to Schubert Renaissance meant the reanimation of old traditions. With Kepler the entrance to the innermost sanctuary of science had been found (Schubert 1808, 14, 156). In contrast to Germany, a mechanical and artisanal view of lifeless nature developed in France, a science \"in which only me-chanic forces moved like worms gnawing rotten bones.\"9 Motivated by the discovery of the four minor planets, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta between 1800/07,10 and inspired by Schelling (Schubert 1806/21, 2: 146ff), Schubert speculated about certain proportions in the solar system which were derived from the radii of the planets and their distance to the sun. He postulated the existence of two mathematical progressions (the first one from Mercury to Juno, the second from Juno to Uranus), and he hoped to have ascertained a mathematical dependency between the greatest distance of a planet to the sun, the diameter and greatest distance of the next 9 \"[··•] neben Keplers erhabenen Ansichten, hat sich noch zu derselben Zeit, in Frankreich, eine mechanische und handwerksmäßige Ansicht einer todten Natur ge-bildet, in welcher sich wie Würmer, welche ein moderndes Gebein benagen nur noch die mechanischen Kräfte bewegen\" (Schubert 1808, 14). 10 \"Diese 4 Weltkörper sind uns erst der Schlüssel zu jenen tieferliegenden Verhältnis-sen des Planetensystems geworden, und ohne sie wäre hierinnen kein Fortschritt möglich gewesen\" (Schubert 1808, 170).

For the second progression, Schubert divided the radius of the sun with the addi-tion of the radii of the orbits of Ceres and Pallas.11 In a review, the astrono-mer Franz Xaver von Zach (1754-1832), director of the Seeberg observatory near Gotha, rejected Schubert's speculations sharply and marked them as a \"mere creation of an effusive imagination entirely beyond the horizon of as-tronomy and mathematics.\"12 Without a doubt, Pfaff was attracted by Schubert, who connected anti-rationalistic piety with a Romantic spirit and became a leading representative of the religious awakening in Southern Germany. Soon a deep personal friendship developed between these two kindred spirits. Moreover, he found like-minded colleagues in Johann Arnold Kanne (1773-1824), \"a genial re-searcher of Antiquity\" (as Schelling described him; see Schubert 1854/56, 2: 286) and Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger (1779-1857), who taught chemistry and later became professor of chemistry and physics in Halle (Snelders 1971; Kleinert 2000). 3. Pfaff's 'Conversion' to Astrology Pfaff was noted as an astronomer and had already written several papers on practical and theoretical astronomy, when in 1816 he published a book of 245 pages with the simple title Astrologie in Nuremberg. In twelve chapters— each under the heading of one sign of the zodiac—he set out to vindicate the ancient science of the stars in opposition to contemporary enlightened (and hence disapproving) views. The first part (Aries to Leo) comprises the history of astrology with chapters on Paracelsus and Kepler, whereas in the second part (Virgo to Aquarius) astrological doctrines (the signs of the zodiac, and the natures of the planets and twelve houses) are treated. The last chapter under the sign of Pisces forms the third part consisting of three supplements. Here a letter from Kepler to Emperor Rudolf II (Pfaff 1816c, 203-212) can be found, and Pfaff 11 Schubert 1808, 166-176, with additions on pp. 389-464 (Ueber die Verhältnisse der Größen, Eccentricitäten und Rotationen der Weltkörper unsres Systems).

The third supplement comprises his German translation of the Centiloquium, then still ascribed to Ptolemy (Pfaff 1816c, 227-242). Pfaff sent a copy to Bernhard von Lindenau (1779-1854), director of Seeberg Observatory and editor of the Zeitschrift für Astronomie (\"Journal for Astronomy\"), who was obviously somewhat irritated and asked for an explanation. Therefore, Pfaff addressed a letter to him, which v. Lindenau published. The Zeitschrift für Astronomie was a short-lived project existing only from 1816 to 1818 (Herrmann 1972, 60-70) and is now quite scarce. Pfaff s letter is a key document for his 'conversion' to astrology, and there-fore central passages shall be quoted: Schon vor mehr als zehn Jahren habe ich mich mit Astrologie beschäftigt. Bei populären Vorlesungen schien mir das Ganze Erwähnung zu verdienen. [...] Früherhin hatte ich nur wenige Schriften gelesen, allein doch machte manches, historisch betrachtet, einen großen Eindruk auf mich. Auch des Ptolemaeus Buch [Tetrabiblos] hat mehreres merkwürdige fur mich gehabt. [...] Endlich war mir weder Ursprung noch Ende dieses räthselhaften Systems bekannt. Von Keppler kannte ich damals hierher gehöriges nichts als etwa das Mysterium [cosmographicum]; später lernte ich Kepplers Harmonie [Harmonice mundi] kennen, ferner seine Briefe, die astrologischen Bewegungen zu seiner Zeit und seine Ansichten die so ganz verschieden von denen seines Zeitalters waren. So sammelte sich manches, die Bilder erwei-terten sich, und so entstand der Entschluß dem astrologischen Glauben ein Denkmal zu stif-ten. Ich sammelte was in meiner Nähe aufzutreiben war, sah mich etwas im Arabischen um, und so gieng es nun in mannichfacher Zeit und Sage, auf die Aphorismen, Paragraphen und Sentenzen los. Bis hierher werden Ew. alles in der Ordnung finden. Nun aber entstand die Frage: was soll man dem Papierstoß für einen Geist einblasen? Sie schreiben mir unbedingt richtig: den historisch critischen Geist. Aber der wurde mir aus mehreren Gründen unmög-lich. Es fehlten mir die Hülfsmittel, meine Leetüre reichte dazu nicht hin [...]; endlich war ich überzeugt, daß der astrologische Glaube durch Tradition gieng, also sein Ursprung nicht nachgewiesen werden könne, also eine Hypothese aufgestellt werden müsse. Da war nun freilich leicht zu sagen, es war Pfaffenbetrug oder mißverstandene Einkleidung astronomi-scher Wahrheiten, oder irrige Anwendung sonst richtiger Sätze: aber beweisen konnte ich nichts. Dazu kam, daß Kepplers Wirken und Wesen, auch dargestellt werden müßte: denn er war gewiß ein Astrolog, d.h. er glaubte an den Zusammenhang der Gestirne mit dem Leben der Erde. Es ist wahr er fiel mannigfach in Irrthümer [...]; aber die Art, der Sinn, das Leben mit dem er dieß that, muß für jeden interessant seyn, der sich für das Streben eines großen Geistes empfanglich hält. In diesem Sinn sagte ich: er schrieb den Geist der Gesezgebung; und in diesem Geist schien es mir merkwürdig, daß er die gemeine Astrologie verachtet und jenen Glauben gegen sein Zeitalter doch zu retten sucht. Aus diesen Gründen mußte ich also den historisch critischen Weg aufgeben, und dem ganzen einen andern Ton und Stimmung geben. Den längst untergegangenen astrologischen Glauben zu widerlegen wäre unzeitig gewesen; ihn zu vertheidigen und zu preißen in einer Zeit, die Ernsthafteres zu thun hat, nicht anständig. So entstand also der Plan, dieß Bild des astrologischen Glaubens, gleichsam aus der Seele eines Astrologen heraus, mit aller Klarheit und Kunst, in abwechselnder Ges-talt und Haltung vorzuzeichnen, dem Ganzen aber eine schwankende Bewegung zu geben, so daß das Klare wieder getrübt erscheine und die Kunst wieder mächtig. Dieses Schwanken glaubte ich durch mancherlei Mittel hervorbringen zu können, Zuvörderst schon die ganze Einkleidung des Buchs, nach den zwölf himmlischen Zeichen: der Löwe, Keppler, die Jung-frau Astronomie u.s.w.; die Erinnerung an den Leser, daß er sich hier, in einer Bilder- und Schattenwelt eigner Art sich befindet.

Dieß Leztere ist mir um so mehr gelungen, da mir manches selbst undeutlich ist. [...] Das ist die Geschichte der Astrologie, für welche Sie in Ihrem lezten Briefe nicht ohne Besorgniß für mich waren. [...] Ich glaube nicht, daß ich Eingriffe in die Astronomie gemacht habe. [...] Auch ist es wohl nicht so schädlich, wenn unter den Astronomen je ein cometenartiges Wesen, - vielleicht ich - wäre, wenn sie sich nur alle um die Sonne der Wahrheit bewegen, und keiner den andern mit sich fortnimmt. Stören ja doch auch die Planeten einander!13 13 \"For more than ten years now I have occupied myself with astrology. I felt that it should be mentioned in popular lectures. [...] Earlier I had only read a few works, although some, viewed historically, made a marked impression on me. Ptolemy's book [i.e., the Tetrabiblos] also had several curiosities for me. [...] Finally, I did not know either the origin or the end of this mysterious system. I knew then only the Mysterium [cosmographicum] by Kepler. Later I became acquainted with his Har-mony [Harmonice mundi], later still with his letters, the astrological movements of his time, and Kepler's views, which were so different from those of his age. Thus a number of things were collected, and the resolution originated for establishing a monument to astrological belief. I collected what was available in my vicinity, looked around a bit in Arabic, and went for aphorisms, paragraphs, and sentences in many times and legends. Up to now Your Excellence will find everything in good order. But now the question arose: Which spirit should be blown into this pile of paper? You have written absolutely correctly: The historico-critical spirit. But for several reasons this was impossible for me. Aids were missing, my reading was in-sufficient; of the Greeks I loiew little [...] Finally I was convinced that astrological belief had a tradition; therefore about its origin no proof could be furnished; there-fore a hypothesis had to be put forward. Admittedly, it was easy to say that it was clerical deception or the misunderstood couchings of astronomical truths or false application of otherwise correct propositions, but I could not supply evidence. Moreover Kepler's work and nature had to be described: For he certainly was an as-trologer, that is, he believed in a connection of the celestial bodies with life on earth. It is true, he sank into many mistakes [...], but the nature, the mind, the life with which he did it, must be of interest for everybody who keeps himself receptive to the striving of a great genius. It is in this sense that I have said: He wrote the spirit of legislation, and in this spirit it appeared curious to me that he despised common astrology and tried rescuing this belief against his age. For these reasons I had to give up the historico-critical way and gave another tone and mood to the whole. To refute the astrological belief which declined long ago would have been untimely; to defend and praise it in our time, which has more serious things to do, would not be decent. So the plan originated to draw this picture of astrological belief with all clar-ity and art, so to speak, from the soul of an astrologer, in varied form and style, but giving a swaying movement to the whole, so that the clarity would become overcast and the art again mighty. I believed that I could produce this swaying by manifold means; first, the whole clothing of the book with the twelve signs: The lion Kepler, the virgin astronomy, and so forth, reminding the reader that he finds himself here in a strange world of pictures and shadows. The account by means of aphorisms left me the freedom to change not only the tone at any moment, but also the contents [...]. Finally the whole should be taken in such a way that none of the common peo-ple in a broader sense could learn astrology from it in order to use it. I was success-ful in the latter, because many a thing is indistinct for me, too. [...] This is the history of astrology, for which you were not without concern for me in your last let-ter. [...] I do not believe that I have made encroachments on astronomy. [...] It would also probably not be so harmful if there existed among astronomers a comet-like nature—perhaps me—even if they all are only in motion around the sun of truth and none carries another away with him.

Wilhelm Olbers (1758-1840), phy-sician and renowned astronomer in Bremen, wrote to his close friend and colleague Carl Friedrich Gauß: Pfaff s Astrologie habe ich mit Befremden gelesen. Pfaff scheint nicht genug daran gedacht zu haben, daß, so lange man die Erde als den Mittelpunkt des Weltalls, und als den Zweck aller übrigen Weltkörper ansähe, der Glaube an Astrologie sehr natürlich, und ich möchte fast sagen, sehr konsequent war. Daß aber nun, da wir das wahre Verhältniß unserer Erde zu den übrigen Himmelskörpern kennen, die Nichtigkeit dieser frivolen Wissenschaft klar vor Augen liegt, da Erfahrung und Thatsachen sie nie bestätigt haben. Nach Copernicus' Zeiten mußte dieser Aberglaube von selbst aufhören. Kepler thut Pf[aff] in dem Stücke großes Un-recht, daß er ihn mit den krassen Astrologen, die selbst Begebenheiten, von willkürlichen Handlungen freier Geschöpfe abhängend, aus den Stellungen der Himmelskörper ableiten und vorhersagen wollten, gewissermaaßen in eine Linie setzt. - Auch Pfaff s Darstellung der Astrologie an sich würde noch vielen Tadel verdienen, und er scheint mir nicht sehr mit ihren ehemaligen Lehren vertraut geworden zu sein.14 And Gauß replied: Pfaff s Astrologie habe ich jetzt auch durchblättert. Es ist mir dabei zu Muthe gewesen, als ob ich mich in einem Irrenhause befände. Ich glaube aber doch, daß das Buch vielen Schaden stiften wird. Die hiesigen Buchhändler sollen eine große Menge Exemplare abgesetzt haben. Man geräth oft in Verwunderung, wenn man sieht, wie sehr die Menschen, auch die sonst gebildeteren, am Aberglauben hängen und überall in Zufälligkeiten wunderbaren Zusam-menhang suchen.15 He was also publicly criticized when Johann Eiert Bode (1747-1826), editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (\"Berlin Astronomical Yearbook\"), announced the publication of Pfaff s book in the following note: 14 \"I have read Pfaff s Astrology with displeasure. Pfaff does not seem to have thought enough about this, that, so long as the earth was looked upon as the center of the universe and the purpose of all other celestial bodies, belief in astrology was very natural, and I would almost like to say, very consistent. But now, since we know the true relation of earth to the remaining celestial bodies, the insignificance of this frivolous science is clear to everyone because experience and facts never confirmed it. After Copernicus's time this superstition had ceased by itself. Pfaff does a major injustice to Kepler in the piece, that he, so to speak, lines him up with crass astrolo-gers, who even derive and predict events dependent on the deliberate acts of free creatures from the positions of the celestial bodies. Also Pfaff s account of astrology in itself would deserve still more reproach, and it seems to me that he did not be-come very much acquainted with its former doctrines\" (Schilling 1894/1909, 2.1: 647f. [Bremen, 12 March 1817]). 15 \"I have also now leafed through Pfaff s Astrology. I felt as if I found myself in a madhouse. But I believe the book will cause much harm. The local booksellers must have sold a vast number of copies. It is often astonishing to see how much people, even educated ones, adhere to superstition and search for miraculous correlation in accidental coincidences\" (Schilling 1894/1909, 2.1: 653 [Göttingen, 28 April 1817]); see also Schaefer 1927, 136, 158.

Er erwarb sich, dagegen doch, durch die Entdeckung der wahren Gesetze des Planetenlaufs, die Unsterblichkeit. 6 But in 1817 Pfaff faced serious professional problems from quite another direction: The Bavarian government decided to dissolve the Realinstitut,17 and he was moved to Würzburg as an associate professor. A year later he was appointed professor at Erlangen, where he lectured on mathematics and phys-ics until his death on 26 June 1835.18 3.1. Astrology and Beyond Pfaff s speculative mind was by no means confined to astrology. Besides writing school textbooks and editing German translations of scientific works,19 he also took a lively interest in comparative language studies (Pfaff 1816b, 1817), oriental studies (he started learning Sanskrit), and Egyptian archaeology. In 1825 Pfaff published a polemical book against Jean-Fran?ois Champollion's (1790-1832) successful attempt to decipher the Egyptian hi-eroglyphs: Die Weisheit der Aegypter und die Gelehrsamkeit der Franzosen (\"The Wisdom of the Egyptians and the Erudition of the French\"; Pfaff 1824/27).

In 1821 Pfaff had finished a book on conjunctions and the Star of Bethlehem in Bamberg, where he stated in the preface: Die zweyte Abhandlung gesteht frey heraus, daß sie astrologischen Inhalts ist. Seit die Fran-zosen sich rühmten, die Welt, oder die civilisierte Menschheit, vom astrologischen Aber-glauben befreyt zu haben, war die Meinung herrschend, die Astrologie sey nichts gewesen, als das Nativität-Stellen für eine bestimmte Person oder eine moralische Gesammt-Einheit, z.B. Staat, Königreich, aus dem Stande des Himmels gegen den Horizont in dem Augenbli-cke der Geburt. Diese Meinung schien herrschend, als ich unter der Aufschrift: \"Astrologie\" [...] ein unter mancherley Rüstung und Waffen kämpfendes Frey-Corps von Paragrafen unter zwölf Fähnlein mit den Zeichen des Thierkreises in die gelehrte Welt ausziehen ließ.20 A year later he began publishing an Astrological Pocketbook, which con-tained a German translation of books I and II of the \"Bible of Astrologers,\" the Tetrabiblos of Claudius Ptolemy (Pfaff 1822, 18-112). Pfaff used a Latin translation by Aegidius de Thebaldis printed first in Augsburg (1484), the Greek texts edited by Joachim Camerarius (Nuremberg 1535) and Melanch-thon (Basle 1553), and also another edition by Nicolaus Prugner (1551). But mostly he relied on Melanchthon's Latin translation, which accompanied the Greek edition of 1553 (Pfaff 1822, 10, 18). Pfaff s Astrological Pocketbook is now very scarce, but his translation was reprinted in 1938 as an appendix to the German astrological journal Zenit. After the Second World War this appendix was printed again as a separate booklet by a small astrological pub-lishing house near Hannover (Pfaff 1950). Furthermore, Pfaff added ten propositions on the nature of astrology (Pfaff 1822, 113-246), an essay by Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert on the coinci-dence of volcanic eruptions with the appearance of great comets (Pfaff 1822, 247-268), and he closed with \"metagnostics\" and prognostications for 1820 and 1822 (Pfaff 1822, 269-282).

No more volumes appeared thereafter. Pfaff announced the edition in Gilbert's Annalen der Physik und der physikalischen Chemie with the following words: Die Astrologie tritt wieder in die Reihe der Wissenschaften ein; sie nimmt Besitz von ihrem ächten und unveräußerlichen Eigenthum; sie sammelt das Zerstreute; alles, was den alten Glauben der Völker über die Bedeutsamkeit der Zeit, den Gang des Periodischen in der Na-tur, den Sinn der Zahl, selbst die Erhebung über die Zeit betrifft, das ist das Ihrige; nicht einzig in Beziehung auf das Siderische der Bewegung der Himmels-Körper am Firmamente.

[...] Auch nur die historischen Darstellungen, die es enthalten soll, mögen die Aufmerksamkeit eines sinnigen Lesers ansprechen [...]. Der Unterzeichnete er-freut sich der Theilnahme einiger ausgezeichneten [sie!] Naturfreunde, und ladet hiermit die Freunde siderischer Weisheit ein, durch Rath, Weisung und Beitrag ihn zu unterstützen.21 However, his announcement was accompanied with a very critical footnote written by Gilbert, in which he expressed his serious concern that this reani-mation could nurture an inclination to mysticism and the miraculous among a public lacking knowledge of the fundamental principles of science. In a letter to Heinrich Christian Schumacher, Pfaff also referred to his intentions: Wenn es nicht zu verwegen wäre, das Wort Astrologie zu nennen, so möchte ich fast meine Verwunderung Ew. W. ausdrükken, daß die meisten darunter blos das Nativitätstellen und die Aderlaßtafel verstehen: auch wie sie sich wehren und dafür streiten, daß sie auf der Erde als einem bloßen Gefängniß sizen, das gar keine Gemeinschaft mit den andern Himmels Lichtern hat.22 Schumacher's reply is not extant, but he was no friend of astrological thought and we can be quite sure that his reaction was unfavorable. Pfaff s two books only received a scornful comment from Bode in the Berlin Astronomical 21 \"Astrology takes her place again in the order of the sciences; she takes possession of her genuine and inalienable property; she collects what was scattered; everything is hers which concerns the ancient beliefs of people on the significance of time, the pe-riodic course of nature, the sense of number, likewise the elevation over time, not only the movement of the celestial bodies in the heavens with regard to the sidereal realm. Through the announcement of an Astrological Pocketbook for the year 1822, the author believes himself to fulfill the latest developments in science and the movement of time in the above respect. [...] The historical explanations, which it shall contain, may meet with the good response of an apt reader as well.

According to Bode's testimony, Pfaff was work-ing on a German translation of Kepler's Harmonice mundi in 1810.24 Of these papers no traces exist, however. He also tried extending Kepler's har-monic investigations to the new planet Uranus, discovered in 1781 by Wil-liam Herschel (1738-1822), and to the four minor planets, which had been found in the first decade of the nineteenth century (Pfaff 1814). This early reception of Kepler became fruitful in the second half of the nineteenth cen-tury: It was not purely by chance that Christian Frisch (1807-1881), who studied with Pfaff in 1830/31, was responsible for the first critical edition of Kepler's works from 1858 to 1871.25 3.2. A Ruined Reputation Nonetheless, Pfaff s academic reputation among contemporary astronomers and physicists was seriously damaged, if not completely ruined. It also seems that among students there was only a little interest in his speculative inclina-tions. At any rate, Count August von Platen (1796-1835), who studied in Erlangen from 1819 to 1826 and had friendly connections with Pfaff, men-tioned him in his very successful satirical comedy Die verhängnisvolle Gabel (\"The Fatal Fork\"), where in act one a Jew named Schmuhl boasted about having read Pfaff s Astrology.

There-fore, it is somewhat exaggerated to call him \"the last professor of astrology\" (Korsch 1935, 90). From 1823 on Pfaff was the only lecturer on all branches of mathematics at Erlangen. However, in winter semester 1819/20, 1822/23, 1827/28, and 1834/35, he lectured on popular astronomy,28 and here Pfaff may well have also made astrological digressions. 3.3 Pfaff s Memory After his death, Pfaff was soon forgotten and only remembered as a curious, if not ridiculous figure.29 In his History of Astronomy, Rudolf Wolf (1816-1893) even thought he had been temporarily crazy: Nach der Kepler'schen Zeit verlor die Astrologie aisgemach ihre Bedeutung und man kann kaum begreifen, wie [...] auch in unserem Jahrhunderte der allerdings zuweilen überhaupt verrückte Wilhelm Andreas Pfaff [...] wagen durfte, den Tod des ersten Napoleon aus einer Konjunktion von Jupiter und Saturn in Parallele zu setzen.30 26 \"I am a great astronomer and necromancer/ All secret powers of nature are well-known to me/ [...] Still in Leipzig, I gave myself up, as you know, to the dark arts and chemical studies/ And to Chiromancy and Pyromancy and Necromancy of Agrippa/ Then I read for myself Pfaff s Astrology, and in Göttingen I carried on the art of Geomancy/ But I did it secretly, because already a thinker is called there a vi-sionary\" (Platen according to Wolff and Schweizer 1894, 2: 14, 17). 27 Lecture timetables, University of Erlangen, SS 1822, 5.

Pfaff and the Rediscovery of Astrology in the Age of Romanticism 255 It took well over seventy years until Pfaff was remembered again. Germany and Austria witnessed an increasing interest in astrology, and in 1910/11 Wilhelm Knappich (1880-1970), librarian and astrologer in Vienna, thought it important to commemorate Pfaff s life and work. He published a bio-graphical essay with the subtitle \"the last German astrologer\" in the short-lived periodical Zodiakus: Erste deutsche Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Astrologie (Knappich 1910, 241-245). One hundred years after Pfaff s death, a certain Karl Weidner in 1935 published a short paper on his life in the As-trologische Rundschau (Weidner 1935/36, 15-19). During astrology's heyday in Germany with its culmination after the end of the First World War, Pfaff was primarily known among astrologers for his German translation of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos. Although he cannot be ranked among the most distinguished scientists of his period, Pfaff s romantic attempt to lead astrology back into the circle of the legitimate sciences deserves attention. His conversion to astrology as a professional astronomer was a unique case—at least, as far as the nineteenth century is concerned. In the second decade of the following century Pfaff got a \"colleague\" in Hans-Hermann Kritzinger (1887-?), the last astronomer of the private observatory founded by Chamberlain Friedrich Gustav v. Bülow (1814-1893) in Bothkamp near Kiel (Lühning 2004, 164-167). But this is another story. References Becker, Udo. Lexikon der Astrologie. Freiburg/Basel/Wien 1981.

Introduction I would like to suggest a change in how social and cultural historians of as-trology approach their subject-matter. That change is at once obscure, impor-tant, and impertinent: obscure, because it is virtually impossible to codify, except in very general terms, as a methodological rule; important, because it would nonetheless have considerable and, I feel, highly positive effects on history-writing; and impertinent, because my advocacy requires me to criti-cize my equals and/or betters.1 The initial stimulus for what I want to say was a relatively inchoate but persistent intuition, a disquiet about the current state of the subject. How-ever, it coincided with two other influences. One was some new work from within the contemporary astrological community (Cornelius 2004). The other was a newly awakened interest on my part in anthropological analyses of 'magic,' 'the supernatural,' and/or 'the occult'—in connection with my re-cent work on astrology and/as divination (Willis and Curry 2004). There is no space here to argue the case for approaching astrology as divination. To obviate any misunderstanding, however, I must stress that for reasons explained in Willis and Curry (2004), it would be quite inappropriate to categorize divination—and by implication, astrology qua divination—as magic, if by that is meant, for example, the manipulation of occult forces ä la Neoplatonic, Hermetic, or Renaissance magic (see also Curry 1999). Equally ill-judged, for the same reasons, would be the rubric of 'occult science.' Divination is certainly not a science, whether ancient or modern (although the reverse is not so easy to dismiss; see Curry 1992, 167). In order to explore the issue, I decided to take as my starting-point Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971) and, as a conven-ient terminus, a relatively recent book that seems on its way to achieving 1 For earlier reflections, see Curry 2000.

Then I remembered a powerful critique of the first book by the an-thropologist Hildred Geertz which appeared, together with a reply by Tho-mas, in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History of 1975. The point is not so much Geertz's specific criticisms and suggested corrections as the fundamen-tal problem she perceived, and, consequently, the kind of approach that might serve as a remedy. It seems perfectly fair to ask, after thirty years, what pro-gress, if any, has been made. Actually, both problem and prescription also figure in a longstanding debate within the discipline of anthropology, as well as (albeit to a signifi-cantly lesser extent) among historians. And although it is not my purpose to trace it in any detail, anthropologists have already had considerable impact upon historians of magic (for want of a better label)—again, more so than the reverse. 2. Thomas vs. Geertz Let us start with Religion and the Decline of Magic. The essence of Geertz's critique (shared by others) was that Thomas's approach to magic was funda-mentally utilitarian and functionalist, with the meeting (or attempted meet-ing) of needs, both individual-psychological and social-sociological, as a virtually exhaustive explanatory framework. In this, as she also pointed out, he had followed Bronislaw Malinowski in assuming that magical acts are necessarily ineffective; thus their persistence apparently gives rise to the puzzle, why do they persist? And the functionalist answer is, because they meet actors' needs that they themselves fail to recognize. Thus, for Thomas, the principal question to be answered regarding astrology was: why were such beliefs, which are \"now rightly disdained by intelligent persons, taken seriously by equally intelligent persons in the past?\" (Thomas 1973, ix). Geertz rightly pointed out the peculiarity of this attitude, all the more striking on the part of an historian writing of a period when to take astrology seri-ously (some of it, at least, and to some degree) was the norm, no less for in-telligent persons than anyone else. It follows, she wrote, that \"[i]t is not the 'decline' of the practice of magic that cries out for explanation, but the emer-gence and rise of the label 'magic'\" and its attendant connotations (1975, 76). In a related context, four years later, G. E. R. Lloyd remarked on how Greek science developed: \"The explanandum is not, in any case, the victory of rationality over magic: there was no such victory: but rather how the criti-cism of magic got some purchase\" (1979, 263f.). And in a paper on early modern English astrology, I called for \"a project which defies anachronism Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The Historiography of Astrology: A Diagnosis and a Prescription 263 by asking not 'why did they believe in astrology?' but 'why did they stop believing in it? Why them and not these others?'\" (Curry 1991, 290).2 But note that as recently as 1991 this was still more of a desideratum than a real-ity. So this is one problem, or one aspect of the problem: anachronism. Geertz also argued that what linked together the specific behaviors exhaustively catalogued by Thomas was \"not a psychological attitude but an ontology\"—a world. In particular, \"What it means to know and to gain knowledge ('cunning') in such a cosmos has a peculiar connotation in such a cosmos, having much more to do with participation and influence than our terms signify\" (1975, 83; 85). This point overlaps one made by E. P. Thomp-son in an earlier cogent essay-review of Thomas: \"religion, magic, astrology, prophecy—all operate in a language of symbolism which, when translated into rational argument, loses a portion of its meaning and all of its psychic compulsion\" (1972, 49). Let this be the second problem, then, or aspect thereof: positivism, or, to borrow an apposite term from Owen Barfield, RUP: residues of unresolved positivism.3 Thomas (1975, 101; 102), in his reply to Geertz, was unrepentant: [I]t is unquestionably true that it is the technological gap between man's aspirations and his limited control of his environment which gives magical practices their relevance [...]. Their [cunning folk's] prestige depended upon their supposed efficacy, and earlier anthropologists were right to point out how the self-confirming nature of their activities prevented clients from realizing that they were not efficacious. In short, 'we' know, and what we know is the truth; they, on the other hand, 'believe,' and have only beliefs. (Until, that is, they turn into us, which puta-tive process is what supplied the grand narrative of Thomas's text.) 3. Grafton's Cosmos At this point, let us turn to Grafton's Cardano's Cosmos. At the risk of seem-ing ungrateful, I shall pass over its several virtues to come straight to the point in the present context: what progress has there been? Certainly Tho-mas's crude functionalism has disappeared from view, but it seems to have been replaced by refinements—historiographical epicycles, if you will. Thus, Grafton writes of \"the social worlds [astrology] served.\" Classical and Ren-aissance astrologers \"projected the same beneficent and threatening images into the heavens,\" while the \"preserved horoscopes and textbooks of astrol-2 See Veyne 1988, 2: \"No positivist criticism can adequately deal with mythology and the supernatural.

Furthermore, \"Cardano would never have admitted that he—or Ptolemy—owed his prominence to persuasive abilities, rather than operational knowledge of nature\" (1999, 145). Just as Malinowski was an inspiration for Thomas, there is an anthro-pological iminence gris for Grafton: Ε. E. Evans-Pritchard and his Witch-craft, Oracles and Divination among the Azande (1937). And just as the work of the latter was more subtle than that of Malinowski, so is Grafton's in com-parison to that of Thomas. Thus, Grafton (1999, 15) proclaims that \"I wanted to do justice to both the rationalism and the irrationality of Renaissance as-trology [...].\" An admirable goal, but note the choice of words: the 'rational-ism' (not rationality) of astrology follows granted the premises, but modernist sensibilities are saved by the very next term, because those prem-ises, as 'we' 'now' 'know'—and all three terms can, and should, be closely questioned—are 'irrational.' So it is safe to grant what Thomas probably would not have, namely that \"the astrologers and their clients used rational means to explore their worlds and their selves, and to master them\" (1999, 202). \"Even Cardano's expressions of skepticism,\" Grafton (1999, 162) writes, \"resembled those of the Azande medicine men studied by Ε. E. Ev-ans-Pritchard; he often challenged the proficiency of individual rivals, but not the validity of the art they practiced.\" This approach raises several questions. (1) Is there any sense here that astrology could have involved—and, by implication, could still involve— anything more or other than serving, mirroring, or projecting official realities (whether physical, social, or psychological) compared to which it is essen-tially epiphenomenal? (2) Is there any awareness that historians of astrology too owe their prominence to persuasive abilities rather than 'operational knowledge of nature'—and, horribile dictu, maybe even professors of phys-ics? (3) Is there any evidence that we too very rarely question the validity of our 'arts,' and just as quickly come up against the limits of our skepticism?4 That we are thus, aufond, in precisely the same situation as Cardano and his contemporaries, and vice-versa? And (4), is there any acknowledgement that there were any serious astrologers—in as serious a sense of 'serious' as you like—after the Renaissance and early modern period? Or, by the same token, that however rare they might perhaps be, it is still possible (as well as still possible) to be a serious astrologer? Unfortunately, the answer to all these not unimportant questions must be \"no.\" By implication, if we take Cardano's Cosmos as a touchstone, the answer to my earlier question about progress must be \"very little.\" This conclusion is reinforced at a less exalted level by such recent books as Stephen Wilson's The Magical Universe: Everyday Ritual and 4 As Wittgenstein observed, it is impossible to doubt everything.

Magic here gives a sense of control in a situation of actual insecurity and impotence [...]. Via rituals, people [...] could 'do something' rather than remain passively helpless,\" and so, depressingly, on. (I would make an exception of one work, however: Ann Geneva's Astrology and the Seventeenth-Century Mind [1995], whose crowning virtue is to take William Lilly's astrology seriously.) Of course, I accept that there are perfectly valid sorts of history-writing which escape this damning verdict because they are trying to do something else. But in terms of the kind that both Thomas and Grafton pro-fess to have undertaken—the recovery of 'lost' worlds of meaning, let us say (although we shall have cause later to question that goal more closely)—the approaches and conclusions of both are clearly unsatisfactory. They fail to respect and accommodate fully the lived experience of their historical sub-jects, astrologers and their clients, as real and true to exactly the same extent, and with the same qualifications (as part of that experience), as that of the historian writing about them. In a word, they lack reflexivity. Even to the extent an historian's goal is not hermeneutic but explana-tory, perhaps along social scientific lines, it seems to me that there is a seri-ous problem here. Without going into this debate to the depth it ultimately requires, is explanation really satisfactory when data that is regarded as es-sential by the human subjects has been discarded, tacitly ruled inadmissible, from the outset?5 One will undoubtedly end up with an explanation, but it will surely not be one of its subject(s), whole and alive; it will be one of only whatever can be explained in such a way. 4. Insights from Anthropology What, then, does anthropology have to offer? After all, its historiographical influence to date has not been an unmixed blessing. And as I already men-tioned, the same debate is longstanding, and often heated, within that disci-pline too. A useful starting-point is Susan Greenwood's Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology (2000). It is useful because it reviews that debate within anthropology, and because her points have some ringing reso-nances with their historiographical equivalents. For example, she writes that: 5 See the forthcoming review of Grafton (1999) by Geoffrey Cornelius in Culture and Cosmos.

Alternatively, they have analysed informants' accounts as 'texts' to be analysed in terms of meaning. The emic [i.e., 'insider's'] reality of informants has been treated as interesting and even reasonable (given the premises upon which it rests), but not as a serious alternative to Western scientific views of reality [...]. (2000, 11) Now one of Thomas's conclusions in his response to Geertz was that \"histo-rians are going to have to come to terms with the methods and approaches of structural analysis\" (1975, 108). But it should be clear that structuralism, whether in history or in anthropology, does not go to the heart of the problem we are considering. Nor even does the symbolic approach of the late Victor Turner, whose work on ritual, communitas, and liminality is fascinating for the way it balances on the very point at stake here—\"swaying between ra-tionalization and deep understanding,\" in the words of Edith Turner (1992, 29). Roy Willis notes that Turner's 'communitas' concept was certainly an improvement on the 'functionalist' theory that long dominated anthropology, according to which all social institutions, including ritu-als, served to uphold the status quo. But it was still Durkheimian in that it saw human reality as contained within an alternation between the limitations of social structure and its libertar-ian antithesis. [...] In this model of'communitas', the infra-social world of aliens, beasts and cosmic spirits—especially spirits—would seem to have no part. (1999, 118) Edith Turner was, in fact, one of the first modern anthropologists to take that brave next step toward deeper understanding in her book Experiencing Rit-ual: A New Interpretation of African Healing (1992). She grasped, and wrote (1992, 2; my emphasis), the crucial fact that in the healing ritual—in which \"I participated instead of merely witnessing\"—the central ritual object \"is both a spirit and a tooth\"—not just a tooth, 'really,' onto which spirit-like properties are projected, mirroring social realities, and all the rest of the mod-ernist rationalizing apparatus. (It is a tiny but revealing fact that for all his innovative work on divination, Victor Turner did not actually attend a divina-tion session; see Peek 1991, 9.) Why brave? Not only because breaking with the consensus risks pro-fessional (institutional) censure, but because of the way it demands what Keats called negative capability—\"that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.\" This is a personal and psychic demand as much as a professional desideratum, of course. Why not? Isn't the pretense that the individual and personal can be ironed out and dispensed with through methodology itself part of the modernist myth? And it is demanding. In the words of Greenwood (2000, 19), the effect of post-80s \"critical awareness and the radical democra-tisation of knowledge\" is \"that ethnographic work is now attempting to bridge the gulf between Self and Other by revealing both parties as vulner-able experiencing subjects.\" In another word, participation.

(2000, 13) Such devaluation is entailed by both anthropological ethnocentrism—the inferior Other in another place—and historical anachronism: the inferior Other in an earlier time. (Note too how easily, given a teleological narrative of Progress, no matter how subtle, 'earlier' becomes evaluative as well as chronological). And a lack of reflexivity is part of the same package. Evans-Pritchard ascribed the Azande's \"blind\" adherence to oracles \"to the fact that their intellectual ingenuity and experimental keenness are conditioned by patterns of ritual behaviour and mystical belief. Within the limits set by these patterns they show great intelligence, but it cannot operate beyond these lim-its\" (1937, 338). Unlike ourselves, constantly and heroically venturing be-yond the limits of our own assumptions, rituals and cultural patterns...? I think not (cf. Peek 1991, 8). I am afraid it follows that ideally, at least, \"if an anthropologist wants to examine 'magic' then she or he must directly experience the otherworld\" (2000, 12). But what is the corollary for historians of astrology? How are participation and reflexivity possible when one's subjects are, so to speak, history? The answer, it seems to me, is this—and here I am trying for that elusive methodological prescription: la. The historian should have experienced, for him- or herself, the truth of astrology in action, in practice, and without any post hoc \"reaching after fact or reason\" to disqualify such an experience as metaphysically, ideo-logically or personally unacceptable. lb. Failing this, he or she should have recourse to some equivalent experience and a principled habit of accommodating it. 2. When horoscopes by the astrologer(s) survive, the historian should have, or acquire, sufficient skill in the astrology involved to follow and illu-minate them. (But note that this stipulation alone, although desirable, is not sufficient to result in the kind of history-writing I am advocating.) Is no. 1, the key demand, unreasonable or unduly onerous? On the one hand, surely not. Unless one has succeeded in entirely turning oneself into a modernist automaton, some such experience is part of every life and, proba-Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268 Patrick Curry bly, at least to some degree, everyday life.6 So the second, alternative stipula-tion (lb) is actually fairly generous. But the first remains the ideal. On the other hand, where academic disciplines are concerned, appar-ently it is asking a lot. Even within anthropology, where ethnography is so central, it has been a struggle to attain and arguably remains a minority view. An anthropologically literate historian, Ronald Hutton, recently provided a terse and amusing summary as part of a valuable overview (2003, 286): the dominant methodological positions have been that (1) it is alright to behave like the natives, but not to think like them, subsequently succeeded by (2) it is alright to go native as long as you do not stay native afterwards. But as he points out, even the latter approach retained the assumption that the beliefs and attitudes of the people studied were valueless in themselves, and that the anthropologist would accordingly suffer no loss in shaking them off at the end of the project [...]. [Also] it turned the researcher into a form of impostor, an un-dercover agent for a different culture who acted out membership of a group before leaving it and throwing off the disguise. Too many historians have, for too long, undertaken an equivalent of this pa-tronizing and ultimately exploitative act. 5. Against 'Belief' The issue at stake is one summarized in this way by another anthropologist, Katherine Ewing (1994, 571)7: \"the taboo against going native results from a refusal to acknowledge that the subjects of one's research might actually know something about the human condition that is personally valid for the anthropologist: it is a refusal to believe.\" But I would prefer to say 'to experi-ence,' and this leads to an important point which needs emphasis. I am not arguing that historians should 'believe in' astrology. Belief is not the issue here, or certainly not a fundamental one. Another anthropologist, Jenny Blain, reflects helpfully on the adverse consequences of \"Taking the view that 'they believe it, so I'll accept it as emic description'\" and stopping there: [It] positions the researcher as having access to a 'truth' outside and at odds with that of her participants. It is, to say the least, patronising. It may also, in the final resort, actively deny access to the 'realities' of the participants [...] including the researcher's own experiences. And in distancing the ethnographer from this 'belief, it starts to reify 'emic knowledge' as fixed, static and unchanging, as generally shared, rather than as a specific construction of interpretations that each person, ethnographer included, engages in, and with. 6 Hence the title of Latour's We Have Never Been Modern (1993). 7 Reviewing Luhrmann 1989, a work whose controversial status still remains potent.

In addition to Blain and the other anthropologists mentioned here, I could adduce Wouter J. Hanegraaff s (2003, 374) recent reflections on the inadequacy of intellectualist interpretations of participation, and David J. Hufford's (1995) succinct methodological critique of scholarly 'disinterest.' Similarly, the striking progress in science studies in the last few decades, both historical and sociological, required adopting the 'symmetry principle' of bracketing the so-called truth-value of both 'scientific truth' and 'supersti-tious beliefs' and treating the conditions of their production alike.9 Doubtless further support of a philosophical kind could be found in the work of Gada-mer, Ricoeur, and Wittgenstein. There is a simpler test regarding the adequacy of 'belief,' however. It is to note the fact that (at least in my experience, both personal and second-hand) historians and other academics studying astrology are often asked— including by other academics, although usually in private—\"But do you be-lieve in it?,\" whereas those lecturing on, say, physics, very rarely are. (This asymmetry is itself a revealing fact with a history, of course, which can and should be studied—but which also impinges directly on how it is studied.) But what justification is there for regarding such a question as relevant in the one case but not in the other? And what would we think of someone who thought it a substantively important question for an historian of science, or of art: \"Do you actually believe in it?\" Could we sensibly require historians of religion to be 'believers'—or require them not to be? For these reasons, I am taking as fundamental not belief but reflexive participation: in Geertz's (1975, 83) terms, not a \"psychological attitude\" but \"ontology,\" that is, worlds; and in Wittgenstein's (1953, 241), not \"opinion\" but \"form[s] of life.\"10 By the same token, the appropriate objects of enquiry are not beliefs but practices. And a point I made in 2000, recently endorsed by Hutton (2003, 289f.), still stands: to write an 'objective' or 'impartial' history of astrology (in the sense that is meant by objectivists) is simply not an option; in taking astrology and astrologers seriously, one is already, in Hutton's words, \"automatically taking sides in at least one major, and often bitter, cultural debate.\" At this point I want to introduce a voice from the astrological com-munity. Indeed, I am honor-bound to do so, because Geoffrey Cornelius's recent call for \"primary scholarship,\" honoring the phenomenological \"pri-8 As it was mine: see Curry 1992, 16f. 9 The historiographical locus classicus is Shapin and Schaffer 1985. 10 Cf. again Hanegraaff 2003, whose position (e.g on pp. 374f.) seems very Wittgen-steinian.

And one of his points too is that astrology cannot adequately be treated as \"some sort of belief-system, to be sympathetically annotated, dissected, and put up for comparison with various other belief-systems.\" To do so is to engage in \"a common avoidance strategy,\" typical of the social sciences, \"which is to avoid allowing the material to touch the observer as truth for the observer\" (2004, 108). Cornelius's emphasis on the need to allow for the possibility for ex-periencing the primary truth of astrology—on a par with that of any other truth-experience, including scientific—should not be understood as an at-tempt to elevate the status of astrology to that of science. We are denying that scientific truth-value has such privileged status, one which sets it apart from other experiences of truth and grants it a superior epistemological position, even in principle, against which to measure other kinds, such as astrological or magical, and to which they might aspire (and then, all too predictably, fail; see Willis and Curry 2004, ch. 8). Such an attempt would simply be another anachronistic and positivistic move in the service of what we are criticizing. The intention, rather, is to move towards reconstruing the notion of truth as such (including scientific) as itself participatory. Now for historians to ignore these sorts of points because of their provenance—whether astrological, anthropological, or philosophical, but in any case extra-disciplinary—would only be evidence of a professional ten-dency to circle the wagons and sit tight. But let me offer some slight relief: even if the news remains unwelcome, I am at least about to quote another historian! Before leaving the anthropologists, however, let me emphasize, with irresponsible brevity, something more we could learn from them. Astro-logical truth does not emerge arbitrarily, willy-nilly; like arguably every other human situation where truth is an issue, it does so in the context of what, viewed diachronically, is a tradition, but what equally, viewed syn-chronically, is a ritual. However understandably, we have, I think, neglected the latter aspect, and our work has suffered as a result. Now what ritual 'is' is beyond the scope of this paper, but all the anthropologists I have mentioned positively have valuable insights into it for us (and to their ranks must cer-tainly be added the late Roy Rappaport [1999]). 6. Provincializing Reason Dipesh Chakrabarty, in his book Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (2000), makes essentially the same obser-vation as Cornelius: \"the giveaway word 'belief is what takes [us] out of lived, preanalytical relationships and inserts [us] into on objectifying rela-Brought to you by | Stockholms UniversitetAuthenticatedDownload Date | 8/25/15 9:58 PM"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The Historiography of Astrology: A Diagnosis and a Prescription 271 tionship of social science [...].\"U And his title refers to just the project of reconstruing what constitutes truth I have just described. Chakrabarty's analysis is profound and subtle, and I hope I shall not do it an injustice in briefly summarizing the salient points for my purpose. \"Reason becomes elitist\"—in the way we have seen at work in the historio-graphy of astrology—\"whenever we allow unreason and superstition to stand in for backwardness, that is to say, when reason colludes with the logic of historicist thought. For then we see our 'superstitious' contemporaries as ex-amples of an 'earlier' type, as human embodiments of the principle of anach-ronism\" (2000, 238). And what is the enabling condition for historicism, that opens the door to teleology and anachronism? It is the \"capacity to construct a single historical context for everything [...] the capacity to see the past as genuinely dead, as separate from the time of the observer [...]. It is through such objectification—predicated on the principle of anachronism—that the eye of the participant is converted into the eye of the witness\" (2000, 239; my emphases). (If I may add a purely subjective comment, perhaps this point also explains that deadening pall that so much history-writing seems to cast over its subject-matter, no matter how exciting it is—or should be.) However, as Chakrabarty adds, the same program also provokes ro-mantic attempts \"to try to get inside the skin of the past, to try and see it 'as it really was,'\" and so on, by way of reaction (2000, 243)—noble, to be sure, but still missing the essential point that the past is actually not, in the objec-tivist sense, past; so the effort needed is not to overcome its deadness and pastness but to recognize its living presentness. The resonance with Blain (as well as the contrast with Grafton) is plain: If historical or anthropological consciousness is seen as the work of a rational outlook, it can only 'objectify'—and thus deny—the lived relations the observing subject already has with that which he or she identifies as belonging to a historical or ethnographic time and space separate from the ones he or she occupies as the analyst. In other words, the method does not allow the investigating subject to recognize himself or herself as also the figure he or she is investigating. It stops the subject from seeing his or her own present as discontinuous with itself. (Chakrabarty 2000, 239) This is a key passage, particularly the last two sentences. They entail a double hermeneutic which is the substance of my earlier methodological pre-scription: a recognition (1) that the historian is in the same existential situa-tion of vulnerability and uncertainty, vis-ä-vis 'the truth,' as were his or her subjects; and (2) that for all parties concerned, their situation is characterized by \"the plurality that inheres in the 'now,' the lack of totality, the constant fragmentariness, that constitutes one's present\" (2000, 243). In both these 11 Cf. Veyne again (1988, xi; 113): \"instead of speaking of beliefs, one must actually speak of truths [...].

What then of the 'residues of unresolved positivism'? Secularism is an integral part of the modernist historical program, cut from the same cloth, with the added twist of having seminally defined itself against 'magic,' in-cluding astrology.12 When there is a dominant consensus that reason is the 'highest' human attribute, and furthermore that scientific reason is its 'high-est' expression (Platonism lives!), then, as Chakrabarty writes, \"the life prac-tices we do not approve of—practices that seem superstitious or that ascribe agency to gods and spirits—seem anachronistic if not reactionary [...]\" (2000, 243). And the rationalizing efforts of many ambitious astrologers, past and present, to present astrology in terms of a natural science— notwithstanding the fact that those efforts have been overruled by superior hegemonic power—are surely more evidence to that effect (see Curry 1992). Indeed, they are often contradicted by the same astrologers' own experiences of the actual \"moment of astrology\" (Cornelius 2003): what Cardano called \"a certain hidden power\" (Grafton 1999, 146). Two centuries later, William Oughtred, one of the ablest mathematicians of his generation and a practicing astrologer, confessed that \"[h]e was not satisfied how it came about that one might foretell by the Starres, but so it was that it fell out true as he did often by his experience find; he did believe that some genius or spirit did help\" (Aubrey 1898, vol. 2, 105). Programmatic secularism does have one additional peculiarity. In spirit as well as (to some extent) provenance, the import of much of what I have been setting out can validly be described as 'postmodern,' using that term with all the cheerful incoherence it requires, from Lyotard to Foucault and Derrida; and none the worse for that.13 The twist, however, is that much of the modernist fear and loathing of the magical and spiritual survived the postmodern turn, especially in the academy.14 Now as any intelligent 'relativist' (including the authors just named) would, or would have, agreed, the argument I am putting forward is not 'irra-tionalist' or 'anti-reason.'15 To return to Chakrabarty, the project of 'provin-12 On the historical roots of the anti-astrology mentality, see Curry 1989 and 1991. The same situation can be found in anthropology; Peek (1991, 9) found a \"striking [...] number of British social anthropologists who treated divination with great deri-sion.\" (The degree of animus involved is often the giveaway.) 13 Grafton's [1999: 176] well-worn crack about scholars availing themselves of the iron laws of aerodynamics to fly to conferences and denounce realism betrays his misapprehension of these issues. (See Herrnstein Smith 1988 and 1997.) 14 Witness Richard Rorty's aggressive programmatic secularism, for example. 15 Not unless a realist-rationalist definition of reason—the point under discussion—is already assumed a priori (see Herrnstein Smith again); or unless those are simply terms of abuse.

To \"think beyond historicism [...] is not to reject reason but to see it as one among many ways of being in the world\" (2000, 249). This is the nub of the matter. As Chakrabarty points out, the 'objecti-fying' mode \"is simply one, albeit a globally dominant one at present\" (2000, 252). And where our own field is concerned (as in so many others), reason cannot even do its rightful job properly until it is no longer forced—in the name of a grossly distorted, because totalized, version of itself—to do them all. As the late Paul Feyerabend observed, in that way that managed to be simultaneously mild and (it seems) scandalous, \"[t]he objection that [a] sce-nario is 'real,' and that we must adapt to it no matter what, has no weight, for it is not the only one: there are many ways of thinking and living\" (1995, 164). Astrology too is a form of life, a way of being in the world. It is not a flawed or failed version of something else, but fully itself to the same extent, and ultimately in the same way, as being an historian, or scientist, or anything else: fully, in a word, human.
