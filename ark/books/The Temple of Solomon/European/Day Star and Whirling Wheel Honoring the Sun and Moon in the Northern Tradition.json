Because so little has come down to us of Their tales and sacred stories, I have chosen to approach this small book not with the eye of a scholar, but with the heart of a mystic. It’s the best I have to give Them, and so herein you will find a collection of prayers, poems, and rituals written by people who have a shared devotion to Mani and Sunna, who have in some way been touched by these two Gods. Here you will find a collection of devotional writings by people who love Them. I find it surprising that there isn’t more information in the surviving lore on these two deities, given the importance They must have had to a predominantly agricultural community, but outside of who They are and what They do, we have almost nothing. Of course, this may be viewed as both our blessing and our detriment. It is a blessing because it opens up a rich world of devotional practice, without limit, through which we can come to know this beautiful God and Goddess. It is our detriment because our faith is all the poorer for its lack of sacred stories recorded in the surviving lore dealing with these two deities. Mani and Sunna aren’t alone in this; there are numerous deities within the Northern Tradition whose stories have been lost."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 GALINA KRASSKOVA There are even some for Whom all we have left is a name. Most modern Reconstructionist Heathens like to know exactly how a God was viewed and worshipped by our pre-Christian ancestors before taking the metaphorical plunge themselves, so, to the modern mind, patterned as it has been by two thousand years of dependence on textual authority, this poses quite a quandary! With Mani and Sunna, and numerous other deities (like Alateivia, Arvolecia, or Gna, to name but a few) we just don’t have the luxury of looking solely to the authority of lore. To begin with Mani, the facts, as we know them, are few. Basically, Mani is the personification of the moon; He is a God of the moon. He steers the moon on its course, determining the time of its waxing and waning. As the moon reflects the light of the Sun, so Mani can be said to, in His ever-subtle way, reflect the light and might of Sunna’s power, which is not to say He has none of His own. Mani doesn’t travel alone; He has two companions on His nightly journey: a girl named Bil and a boy named Hjuki. These children are brother and sister and once had a very cruel father. Mani observed them being mistreated and came to steal them away. They now accompany and assist Him on His nightly journey. Our moon God is also pursued by a wolf, Hati, who makes sure that He doesn’t stray from His assigned course. According to the shared UPG (unverified personal gnosis) of many in the community, there is some likelihood of this for Mani truly likes humanity and likes to watch over those He cares for, even if only from afar. Hati has the difficult job of keeping the moon punctually on course. Of course, according to the surviving lore, at Ragnarok, the wolf will capture the moon and devour Him, plunging the night into unbroken darkness. My own experience with Mani began shortly before Etinmoot 2008. I was planning to lead a ritual honoring Mani as part of the celebrations at this gathering and a couple of months beforehand, I got the strong feeling that Mani wanted to be “horsed”. What this essentially means is that He takes a willing human and pushes aside that person’s consciousness, entering and wearing that person’s flesh for"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 3 a set amount of time. In this way, He could directly interact with the people gathered. This is not an uncommon practice in many indigenous religions and is most commonly known as part of the Afro-Caribbean religions like Santeria and Voudoun. Over the past decade it has begun occurring within the Northern Tradition as well. Many of us use the common Afro-Caribbean terminology of “horsing” and “being horsed” or “being ridden”; i.e. the Deity rides the person like one might ride a horse. We utilize these words not in an attempt to bring Afro-Caribbean practices into the Northern Tradition, but because they are apt descriptions and we simply lack the Norse or Anglo-Saxon equivalents. We have no concrete evidence that this was ever practiced historically in Northern Europe, but it is happening now within modern Heathenry, though it is very controversial. It certainly isn’t necessary to experience or witness god-possession to properly honor a God or Goddess. Since “horsing” is part of my practice as a Northern Tradition shaman, however, I quickly consented to be “ridden” by this God. This was to be my first interaction in any capacity whatsoever with Mani and for me, it brought me far closer in devotion to Him than I ever expected. The ritual was planned and I set about acquiring the clothing that Mani had indicated He’d like. Having special garb not only often pleases the Deity in question, but removing it after the possession aids the vessel in returning to him or herself. I had no prior experience with Mani and was more than a bit nervous about whether or not I’d be able to open enough to Him. I need not have worried. I’ve been doing this type of work for over a decade and although I’ve “horsed” numerous Gods and Goddesses, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Mani is the gentlest Deity I have ever had the privilege of carrying. Usually I am exhausted and a little sore after a horsing but not with Mani. I was left, as it were, in tip-top shape. But I am getting a bit ahead of myself. He seemed very concerned in His passing with honoring the work that we both had to do. He left before moonrise and made sure that He left me in good condition. He"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 GALINA KRASSKOVA also took care not to overwork my assistants, which is not the case with some other Deities. The experience was actually quite charming, and to say that I am utterly charmed by Mani would be a gross understatement; besotted would be a more accurate description of the effect He has on me. He is a sweet and gentle presence, at least when He came to me. He was curious, and fascinated, enthralled, utterly delighted with the minutiae of embodiment. There is always a time during all but the most intense possessions where the human and the Deity share a point (however fleeting) of co-consciousness, where it is possible to see through a God’s eyes. That never lasts long and it is usually the last cognizant moment for the person before the Deity seats Him or Herself fully and human consciousness is gently pushed aside. With Mani, that point is glorious and seems to go on forever, though in truth, I’m told it lasted only seconds. Each leaf, each twig, each ray of sunlight seemed a wonder to Him. He looked around at the grass and trees, people and animals with the uninhibited wonder of a child. From this experience with Him, it is my belief that He has much to teach about how precious our physical embodiment is, how sacred our world. Once Mani was fully seated within me, I don’t remember anything until He departed, but I will intersperse my description here with accounts of His behavior as described to me by those assisting me and those present for the ritual. He wanted music, throughout the time He was there. It seemed as though the turning of planets and the pulsing of stars echoed in its notes. He perceives music and the connections it brings quite differently from the way that we do. He loves His sister dearly and seemed fascinated and delighted to watch Her passage across the sky. He had requested that I assemble an odd assortment of rings with moon images or moonstone, beaded necklaces, anklets with moon images on them and moonstone jewelry that He then proceeded to give away to those gathered around. We had laid out food for Him but He partook only that which had been given to Him by a child, instead sending the basket of offerings around the gathered folk, bidding them"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 5 to eat, drink, dance, and celebrate (though He loved the Sambuca we offered Him). He walked around the gathered folk, touching them gently, talking to them, blessing them. He held a woman who had been very broken by life and told her that there is none so broken in this world who cannot come to Him, no pain that He has not witnessed in the night. He knows, He weeps, He understands. The first time Mani came into me, we’d inadvertently prepared the ritual to occur on a day of the full moon and a lunar eclipse. The second time, a year later, it was a day after the height of the full moon, when the moon had just started, ever so slightly, to wane. Though He again passed out offerings and blessings to the assembled folk, there was something a touch more somber about His presence, a melancholy, almost a very quiet sadness. Many of us conjectured in light of this that His personality changes somewhat with the moon phase. That second time I horsed Him, He apparently blessed several animals that were present, and again delighted in the presence of the people, inviting them to feast, dance, and rejoice. Still, onlookers said there was a melancholia in Him, evident in both His actions and His words. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6 GALINA KRASSKOVA While I’ve had many experiences with Mani, including the two aforementioned horsings, Sunna has always seemed more remote. Perhaps She truly is less concerned (or interested) in the intimate workings of humanity than Mani, or perhaps it is simply that I am the consummate night person and relate better to Her brother. Those times I have called to Her, I’ve experienced the energy of Her presence as bright, fiery, forceful, and dense... there is weight and power, controlled might in all She does. Sunna is sometimes called Sol, and the sun is the living embodiment of Her power. She must have been immensely important to our ancestors; anyone living an agriculturally focused lifestyle (i.e. farmers) would be, especially before industrialization, utterly dependent on Her for a good harvest. As my colleague Sophie Oberlander has noted in The Jotunbok, Sunna’s presence in the heavens also has tremendous eschatological import: Her capture by the wolf Skoll is one of the signs of impending Ragnarok.1 More than that though, Sunna’s power is one of the building blocks of an ordered, healthy, whole society. Her sister Sinthgunt is associated with healing (She is mentioned in the Merseburg charm as having healing power), and in a way, Sunna might also be said to have healing power. As the Sun She brings health and vitality. As the sun is made of heat and fire, so Sunna’s power has the potential to hallow, just as all fire has the potential to cleanse and consecrate. She drives out metaphysical darkness and decay as Her sister drives out disease. “She makes the world holy and by doing so defines the inangard, the sacred enclosure of a healthy community.”2 Scandinavian winters were and are long, tedious, and hard. The lengthening presence of the Sun in Her daily voyage across the sky must have been a welcome sight to our ancestors as winter turned slowly into spring. As Sophie Oberlander points out:   1 Jotunbok, p. 215. 2 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 7 Many of the holy tides, the holidays celebrated within both Heathenry and Neo-Paganism, revolve around the yearly cycle of the Sun and Her control of the earthly seasons. ...today, we may not be bound to cycles of the seasons in the same way our ancestors were, but we can still benefit from a certain mindfulness of the Sun’s cycles. Most of us live busy, harried lives made all the busier by the supposed convenience of modern technology. The rhythm of our days is largely governed by Sunna’s cycle across the heavens: we rise in the morning, work throughout the day and seek our rest as She disappears into the Western horizon. Without Her life-giving light and warmth, the earth would be a barren, frozen, lifeless rock. Technology enables us to forget about Her for a time, but when all is said and done, we are still dependent on Her for nourishment. Modern science has even proven that some people will suffer physically, mentally, and emotionally if they do not receive enough of Her life giving rays (SAD, or seasonal affective disorder). In our rush through our work day, many of us who ignore the rhythm She sets for us end up overworked, over-stressed, and ill. Sunna is our Pace-Setter. She orders our days just as She did for our ancestors. She is our defender, teaching us how to maintain health and well-being even in the midst of industry and endeavor. ...Looking to Her to be our guide as we strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance is a subtle way of nourishing spiritual awareness in the sturm and drang of our daily, often numbingly mundane lives. That after all, is one of Her greatest lessons: nourishing a sense of the holy both within and without. Sunna teaches us to create the holy in our lives by managing our time, wisely, mindfully, and well.”3   3 Sophie Oberlander in The Jotunbok, p. 217-218."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8 GALINA KRASSKOVA This devotional begins with people’s offerings to Mani and ends with those to Sunna.

"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 19 Mani and I Andrew Gyll When I first became involved with Paganism I worked within an essentially Wiccan framework. My coven met to celebrate esbats on, or as near as possible to, the Full Moon. We also celebrated the eight major solar festivals. For the first time in my life I bought a lunar calendar and came to know instinctively where I was in the lunar and solar cycle. Being aware of the seasons and the passing months, I came also to recognise my own cycles and, in particular, my mood swings. I realised that I waxed and waned with the Moon and, on the other hand, grew increasingly fractious and brittle as the days grew longer. A waning Moon somewhere between Litha and Lammas finds me wrapped in shrouds of gloom and of no earthly use to anyone. As a result of this awareness I have come to see myself as an essentially lunar person and regardless of which tradition I’ve worked in I’ve always felt drawn to Moon Deities. When I was called into the Northern Tradition I found it surprisingly easy to adapt to the idea of the Moon as a God rather than a Goddess. The fact of Máni’s maleness doesn’t alter His essentially lunar qualities. He is passive, aquatic, receptive and intuitive. Of course there is no such thing as a typical male or female but, if we pay lip service to the stereotypes, it is clear that Máni is no more a regular male than His sister Sunna is an ordinary female. It has always intrigued me, given the widely held preconceptions of Norse culture, how many of our Deities evince qualities more often associated with the opposite gender. Such Deities are bridges, they occupy that liminal space between different states and realities. Like Sigyn, for example, Máni is a bridge between different races and therefore ideas of how the worlds are and how they should be. He is a Jotun employed by the Aesir who has a soft spot for human children and is greatly beloved by the Alfar, light and dark. His connections with the tides and long standing agricultural practices regarding the sowing and harvesting of crops also tie Him in with the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"20 GALINA KRASSKOVA Vanir. Máni provides a point through which these races and their disparate philosophies can connect. For me He has always been a comforter, most prominent when I am at my lowest. He doesn’t talk that much, usually a crazy zigzagging dance, a song or a burst of formless but seductive music distracts Him. Other times He can be quiet and calm, loving unspeaking walks across moonlit heaths or along the seashore. On occasions like this He doesn’t need to say anything—His presence alone is pure balm. In my experience the Vaettir, great and small, tend to be quite changeable in Their appearance until They get to know you. At this point They then seem to settle into a form that works both for Them and you. I see Máni as a very beautiful young man. His hair is long and black and lies in ringlets about his shoulders. His eyes are grey but can glint with purple or even red at times. He generally favours loose clothing, usually white and purple, and prefers to wear sandals. He carries a wooden flute with Him and seems to like lace and silver jewellery. Having said all this, He is, however, unpredictable and a little vain. As He says Himself ‘Sometimes I am saffron, sometimes I am blue!’ So what will happen to Máni at Ragnarok? Allowing for the fact that things may not pan out as prophesied, the Voluspa states that the wolf Hati will finally catch and devour the Moon. If, as Loki sometimes asserts, the Moon is just a ball of stinking green cheese, this may be no bad thing, providing a suitable replacement can be found. Of all the Deities of the Northern Tradition Máni, with his sympathetic and empathic qualities, seems to be one of the most vulnerable. Despite this He has an air of indestructibility about Him. Disasters and humiliations, and I’m told He has suffered a few, seem to slither past and through leaving Him much the same as ever. Perhaps this is His greatest mystery?"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 21 Evening Prayer to Mani Galina Krasskova Hail the rising of the Moon, Beautiful God, sensual singer of the night’s blessings, Sometimes hidden, sometimes bright, You watch over us, Taking your place in the heavens, Following the path your sister daily treads.

It doesn’t have to be very large, but it should, in some way, reflect your impressions of this God. There ought to be a candle in the middle of the altar. I usually give Him sweet wine (like Lillet dessert wine, or Inniskillin ice wine), and I’ve written the offering part of this ritual to include that, but readers should feel free to give Him whatever offerings they feel He might like and to alter the wording of that part of the ritual accordingly. If you are able to stand where you can see the moon, it is best to do so and to do this ritual in Mani’s light. But if not, don’t worry. Begin by reaching your arms up as if to embrace the moon. (This makes the rune Algiz, which is incidental. It is a physical expression of devotion and prayer found in many ancient images.) Take a few moments to breathe Him in, to feel His light, His presence, His power filling you and wrapping itself around you. Allow yourself to physically embody and express your devotion to Mani. Light a candle and say the following prayer: Mani, I ask Your blessings upon me tonight. You who are the night’s sweetness, majestic and beautiful; You who gleam like a jewel in the fabric of the heavens, gliding across the sky from horizon to horizon, please smile upon me. Grant me the safety and protection of Your regard as I sleep and as I dream. The delicious luster of Your beauty leaves me in awe. You are my inspiration and my heart’s haven.

Since the moon has such a strong influence over me and always has it was only natural that I come up with a set of prayer beads specifically for the moon and His many faces. The idea is to pray on the day of the moon phase in question. Start with the current moon phase and go through the prayers. Each phase tends to have a different “theme” or type of energy to work with in my mind. The New Moon for me is for setting goals and making plans to achieve them. The Waxing Crescent is for healing work. The First Quarter is for work involving protection, and the Waxing Gibbous is for luck workings. The Full Moon I see as the “Thanksgiving” of the lunar month, when the moon is at its fullest and thus its bounty of light is at its greatest, so too should we look at our own bounty and be grateful for what we have. The Waning phases are more for banishing work. The Waning Moon is for banishing bad habits and the Last Quarter is for cleansing and doing away with negative thoughts. The Dark Moon is the time of the dead, when the moon is dark and hidden away and thus other things dark and hidden are remembered as well. Month by month the meanings of these prayers can change. For example, the Full Moon prayer “May I always be grateful for what I have” can take on a totally different meaning from one month to the next depending on how things have been going in your life. The moon directs the tides of the seas and since our bodies are mostly water it is only natural that it directs us as well. These prayers are a way to get back in line with the natural flow of your individual tides. The beads can be any style you please, although at least nine beads should be on the strand. Each bead represents a phase of the moon. You can make them simple with just the nine beads or you can make them elaborate with decorative moon charms, stars, mirrors which Mani loves, or anything else you like."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"38 GALINA KRASSKOVA However you choose to do it, it is my hope that these prayers are a good help to those seeking to get back in sync with the moon’s cycles.

Since my childhood, I’ve been a creature of darkness. Given the choice, I stay up till nearly dawn and sleep well into the daytime; this distressed my partners for many years. When we moved from the city to a little homestead-farm in the country, I started getting up earlier in order to do farm work. While I wasn’t exactly greeting the dawn, I was seeing the morning on a daily basis for the first time in many years, and I got to watch the Sun’s slow progress across my garden as I worked. It was during those first years that I became aware of the Sun as something more than just a light in the sky that went on and off at semi-regular times. I also became aware of the Sun’s difference during the various times of the year. I was aware that the Neo-Pagan church that I belonged to celebrated eight holidays that comprised a solar year, of course. How could I not know that? It was baby stuff. As we continued to farm, however, I grew deeply into that solar year. It taught me how the Sun isn’t just something to tan our hides at the beach. It is closely bound up with our food supply. I learned, for example, that the reason that eggs are the symbol of Ostara, the spring equinox, wasn’t just theoretical. Chickens who aren’t kept under artificial lighting but are allowed to lay as they will automatically follow a solar cycle. Their egg laying slows as the light fades and the days shorten, until around Yule eggs are rare commodities—unfortunate for all the Yule baking I expected to do! As the Sun turns and the days lengthen, the egg-laying increases until it peaks during the period from Ostara to Beltane. Eggs, which some ancients referred to as suns-in-a-shell, are produced on a solar cycle, and are the true harbinger of spring. I watched as the Sun stroked the leaves open, and learned why Beltane is the Green Man’s holiday. I watched as fruit ripened, and learned why the red stain of the berry is the blood of the slain Sun King who dies at the Solstice in Mediterranean countries. I watched"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 69 the grain ripen, and realized why the golden god of more northerly countries is slain at Lammas, when the weather is more truly the Sun’s time in our cold north, and the grain reflects its gold. I watched the harvest come, and saw what happened when the balance of sun and rain wasn’t right. I saw the Sun fade to a mere few hours during the cold dark time of Yule, and understood why we desperately light bonfires at that time, and gather closely around them. I watched the midwinter festival of Oimelc, where the light is bright on the snow, a bright white cold that we don’t associate with the Sun but which is still part of her cycle. I watched my seedlings grow upward, and realized deeply the relationship that all plants, all the Greenwights, have with Sunna. Greenwights have only three Gods: the Earth, the Rain, and the Sun, however humans may name them. Of the three of them, the Sun fills them with the greatest joy, even the shade-loving plants. They uncurl from the earth and reach for her blessings. She gives them half their nourishment; they understand what it is to feed on the sun’s rays, and to hibernate or die entirely when her presence leaves them and the white cold ensues. I planted Sun gardens—small plots with yellow and orange annual flowers that would live for only one of her seasons—sunflowers, calendula, cosmos, German chamomile, dahlias, and heliotrope as blue-violet as the sky when she begins to drop below the horizon. I also watched my friends with Seasonal Affective Disorder, a problem that has never affected my vampire self. I watched them wilt as the days grew shorter, and expand again in the light of the Sun. I suggested that they might go out and lay in the early morning rays, but I was told that the Sun was now dangerous. We’ve stripped part of the atmosphere off the earth, I’m told. In parts of Australia there’s hardly any protection from the deadly UV rays, and skin cancer is growing rampantly as a disease. We’ve made sun-worshiping a deadly activity. Sun-worshiping, that’s what they call it on the news when they refer to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"70 GALINA KRASSKOVA people laying out on the beach, and they only speak of it now in terms of smug warnings. Flames leaped orange and burners glowed red, The Sun beat down golden on our youthful heads, The burns on our fingers were testament to Our not giving Fire The respect it was due... And now we are stripping the shield off the Earth, Exposed to the Fire that once gave us birth. Do we really think our dear Sun won’t be cruel? But Fire has no mercy And She’ll kill us for fools. -Corbie Petulengro, All That Burns It’s something to think about. We’ve done such damage to our atmosphere, the blanket that lies between us and the terrifying side of the Sun, that it’s certain we can expect a change in attitude toward the Sun’s blessing. I’m already seeing it. People speak of sunlight in terms of fear and damage and protection, not warmth and joy. Parents no longer say, “Go outside—you need to get some sunshine!” They say, “Wear a hat and make sure that you wear extra-strength sunscreen, and don’t get burned.” Tans are acquired in studios, and my friends with SAD huddle up in front of little lamps rather than going out into the light that they need. A friend of mine who is a sacred whore, working for the Love Goddesses, once wrote passionately about how fatal sexually transmitted diseases and the consequent need for safe sex have drastically changed attitudes toward sex and especially bodily fluids in this day and age. In ancient times, bodily fluids were considered sacred and to exchange them was a blessing. Today, when people think about that, they immediately think of Death. In the book Pagan Polyamory, my friend wrote about the issue:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 71 I’m in a full-time rigid fluid bond with my primary partner, which means that no body fluids can get exchanged when I do my temple work. It is so incredibly difficult for me to have sacred sex while maintaining a safe separation between me and the other person’s bodily fluids! But I have no choice. I did safer sex education for a while, and in the training they give you answers to the common objections people have to using barriers, but nothing can address this: you must keep in mind at all times the association of their bodily fluids with death and disease. No. Their bodily fluids are sacred, and to take them into my body is to show ultimate acceptance of them and the physical product of their sexual arousal. To see this exchange not as a messy unpleasantry but as something desirable and beautiful is an affirmation of the sacredness of the body and of the physical realities of sex ... The way I’ve ritually dealt with it is this: When doing sacred sex, I have sometimes taken a small pot of honey and fed my client a dab off my finger, and had them do the same for me. I explain to them that it is reckless and disrespectful to our bodies to play without barriers in these times, but this sharing of honey is a symbol of the sacred exchange of fluids natural to sex. To share sexual fluids creates a link between you, just as a blood bond does. It is important to me to emphasize that although this exchange has been made symbolic, it is not because the sexual fluids are inherently dirty or disgusting, and I do what I can do downplay that connection to death. But I am of the age where from the time I was sexual, sex could kill. If I broke that fluid bond, every unsafe sex act would feel like Russian Roulette. I’d be constantly thinking: Will"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"72 GALINA KRASSKOVA this one kill me? Am I still safe? Maybe it is already killing me, and I don’t even know it. How can we be sexual and not be aware that we walk this line? What AIDS has done for sex, ozone pollution has done for sunlight. (While it may be a coincidence, I am struck by the reference to honey in the preceding quote—golden and sweet; honey has long been a sun-substance as well as a love-substance.) Those of us who want to have a relationship with the Sun need not to be in denial about this issue. If we don’t acknowledge what we’ve done, and what its consequences are (if only to ourselves), we are being hypocrites every time we raise our voices in praise of the Sun’s passing. How do we reconcile the danger, the dark side of all that light? For me, I start with the fact that Sunna is a fire-giant. Most reconstructionists in the Northern Tradition are fairly wary of the giant-Gods in general, but they always seem to make allowances for Mani and Sunna and their harbingers Daeg and Nott ... perhaps because the markers of their presence are right there overhead all the time anyway, so it really takes a stretch to demonize them. I’m not saying that they should be demonized, because I believe that it is inappropriate to demonize any of the Gods that I honor; our worldview doesn’t contain two divided sides of angels and demons, good and evil. Every creature, divine or otherwise, has their dark side. For the “brighter” deities, we usually only see that side when we’ve screwed up. What we’ve done to the Earth’s atmosphere is an insult to Sunna, and to all solar deities. Since the Giant-Gods are the protectors of Nature—just as the Aesir and Vanir are the protectors of Civilization in two rather different forms—it makes sense that Sunna would show her wrath in this way. She’s a powerful force, and for us to want to stare her in the face without that veil between us is a wrong that she will swiftly punish. There are some forces that Man is better off keeping some kind of a distance from, and the Sun’s direct rays are one of them. As the Fire-Giant responsible for protecting sunlight, and"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 73 protecting the Earth from sunlight, what we’ve done is near to unforgivable. But not entirely. You want to propitiate Sunna? Give aid to an organization that is trying to replenish the ozone layer, whether from increasing sea plants to decreasing emissions. Buy a car that is emissions-free—or, better yet, buy one for someone who will never have the money to purchase such a thing. Run things on solar power whenever possible. (There, see, the cleanest form of alternative energy we have is solar power! Let’s declare Sunna the patron of that industry.) Sunna has a typical Fire-Giant personality—impulsive, rambunctious, easily moved to laughter and suddenly inspired to scorching wrath ... and, inevitably, easily moved again to more laughter when someone tries to please her. On top of that, all Sun deities are rather vain. It’s just part of the job. She enjoys being hailed, and having things done in her honor. Why else would she put on such a show? At this time in our history, we need to propitiate her more than ever ... and replace the veil we are ripping off of her, before she smites the lot of us. My story of learning about Sunna has not ended with undiluted happiness. I have lupus, a serious autoimmune disease that is worsened by sunlight. No one knows why sunlight makes the symptoms worse, but the fact remains that it does so. When we moved to the farm, I had just begun a new medication that put the illness into remission for several years, and I was able to enjoy Sunna’s rays regularly. Unfortunately, the disease caught up to the medication and progressed past it, and sunlight began to make me ill, more so than it had ever done before. I retreated again to the night, to shade, to large hats and umbrellas. This is probably the way that it will be for the rest of my life. I am doomed to be a creature of darkness, a vampire in the shadow. It would be easy for me, with my affliction, to come to hate the Sun. I can tolerate about a half hour of sunlight, perhaps an hour if I’m feeling especially well and nothing else is acting up. One minute too"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"74 GALINA KRASSKOVA long, and I’m down in bed for the next few hours. It would be easy to come to hate this beauty which I was allowed to experience for such a short time, only to have it taken from me. It wouldn’t be hard at all, and yet I will not succumb to that anger and sorrow. I believe that we can make change in the world magically, one small thing at a time, by living mindfully and dedicating our mindfulness to that change—as above, so below. Macrocosm, microcosm. As I pull this weed, I pull another small bit of fear and hatred from my soul. As I pull this weed, I pull another small bit of fear and hatred from the great mass of humanity. The one is just as achievable as the other ... and holding onto a love for the Sun, even if I must observe her light from underneath the brim of my wide Chinese coolie hat, is a way to hold that faith for everyone else as well. This land is my native earth, even if my ancestors did not live here, and I sleep on it every night. It is under my feet wherever I go, and it is the Sun that makes it green instead of barren. Like the greenwights told me: In the end it comes down to earth, rain, and sun. I will love the Sun even as I am driven from her by my own safety, through no fault of hers or mine ... and if I can do that, so can all the rest of you. It’s easier than you think.

Before offering it to Sunna, (or serving it to guests if you’re making this for human consumption), decorate the top with confectioner’s sugar. I take a paper lace doily and lay it on top of the cake and sprinkle the sugar over that. It will make a pretty pattern on the cake when the doily is removed.

Her symbol is one the most tangible manifestations of Divine power that we have and one of the most ancient. Most pre-Christian religions conceived of the sun as belonging to a male Deity and the moon as being female. To our ancestors, however, that polarity was reversed. What does this mean? What can we learn from this? What does it say about these two Deities? The blessings of the sun were absolutely necessary for our ancestors’ survival. Contrary to popular media, the ancient Scandinavian and Germanic cultures were predominantly agricultural, which means they were utterly dependent on the land and elements for nourishment. Without Sunna’s constancy, without Her presence, there would have been no harvest, no nourishment, no continued survival. She was a very, very important Goddess. Today, with the environmental problems that our culture is facing in the wake of industrialization, that balance has shifted. What does this mean? How may we best honor Her in our modern world for She is no less important? If you have a candle, light it at this point (don’t worry if you do not). Meditate on how the power of the Greater is held forth in the lesser, how we can use the heat and light and warmth of a tiny fire to represent Sunna’s power.

True, some depression is chemical in nature, and people who can get medical help that actually helps them (or some alternative health care) should do so. However, it isn’t always possible. Perhaps they can’t afford health care and are still waiting for some bureaucracy to grind fine enough to allow them free care. Perhaps they’ve tried various medications and they did not work, or had intolerable side effects. (It happens.) Perhaps they’re taking medications, but still have the occasional down day or three where there is a glitch in the med absorption, and the ensuing bout of depression must be dealt with. (That happens too.) Perhaps the problem isn’t chemical at all, but one of grief and stress from outside circumstances overwhelming someone’s defenses. Golden gods, like Frey, Freya, and (of course) Sunna, are the divine equivalent of an antidepressant. Their warm light reaches out into people’s hearts and souls and brightens everything, if only for an hour, or even a moment. If you’re wrapped in a black cloud, even that moment can be the thing that keeps you going until tomorrow, one weary step at a time. To that end, these beads are a spell against depression. They can be done any time of the day or night, but it’s best to do them while She’s still in the sky. One note: While it is expensive, at least one bead (ideally the first one) should be made of real amber, not fake. It’s how you connect to Sunna’s power to begin with. Amber has always been Day to jet’s Night. This is a small string of beads—one large golden bead, eight medium-sized beads for the eight solar points of the year, and nine small sun-colored beads as spacers between these. The first and last lines are said on the large golden bead, as the prayer comes around in a circle (like the year). The same line—“Hail Sunna!

Hulsman Midsummer (or Litha, Sonnenwende, Sankthansaften, Midsommardagen, etc.), is without a doubt a day with heavy connections to the sun. For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, Midsummer is the longest “day” of the year, as the sun appears in the sky for far longer than any other day of the year. In certain places of the Northern hemisphere including parts of Scandinavia, the sun may never fully set, giving locals an eye-witness view to a phenomenon colloquially known as the “midnight sun”. As such, it should come as no great surprise that in pre-Christian times, as well as for Pagans and Asatru today, the summer solstice is marked with celebration honoring the sun itself. Sunna (or Sol) is described in our tradition as the Goddess who guides the sun in its track in her chariot drawn by horses, as her brother Mani similarly drives the moon coursing through the sky. We have no actual depiction in the archaeological record of Sunna herself; the closest we come is the Trundholm sun chariot from the Nordic Bronze Age (1700 BCE - 500 BCE) found in Denmark, which depicts the sun (not the Goddess) being pulled by a horse drawn chariot. In this image, the wheels of the chariot are clearly in the form of solar crosses, or sunwheels. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" DAY STAR AND WHIRLING WHEEL 93 From ancient sources going back thousands of years, we have two types of sunwheels present in the archaeological record. The first is known as a solar cross, which is a circle bisected by a horizontal, and a vertical line arranged in the shape of a cross. The other incorporates the Sowilo rune (which literally means ‘sun’), and may be known as a swastika (which was infamously misappropriated by the Nazi party in World War II) or fylfot (which is a specific type of swastika that has truncated looking limbs). Variations of this later type of sunwheel can incorporate a varying number of Sowilo runes (two or more) into its symmetrical design. One of the traditional folk practices for Midsummer celebrations in the areas where the Norse Gods were once (and in some cases still are) honored is to set a sunwheel (or a wagon wheel) on fire. In some cases the wheel was simply lit locally and incorporated into the Midsummer bonfire. In other cases people trekked out into the countryside, found a hill, set the sunwheel on fire, and let it roll down the hill as they chased after it, people watching and cheering as they watched it roll along it’s fiery way, setting vegetation aflame. Sometimes mini-fires were set in the fields, as a way of directly burning, in offering, the crops that the sun had helped to grow. Fragrant herbs might also be tossed into local bonfires instead. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"94 GALINA KRASSKOVA Figure 1 For Litha this year (2009), I made my very own sunwheel to adorn the altar, which was infused with fragrant herbs and flowers. I opted to make my sunwheel in the solar cross design, and began by going to my local crafts store where I purchased a natural straw wreath, as well as natural raffia. Additionally, I stopped off at the florist and picked up sunflowers, yellow roses, purple mums, and a few other odds and ends that seemed appropriate. Then I used the raffia, and wrapped the wreath with it creating my base solar cross design. Once I had made the solar cross (Figure 1), I then began incorporating the flowers into the sunwheel (Figure 2). The end result (Figure 3), only decorated the altar for a few brief hours before it was tossed into the Litha bonfire in offering to Sunna herself. This is an easy project that anyone can do for a modest investment, and can be made both by individuals for their own private rituals or by groups of people as a joint and collective offering.

Without crops, there was no food and the people suffered. Of all the Gods and Goddesses, Sunna perhaps had the most direct impact on the lives of Her people.

Yet without Sunna, our world would be a barren, icy rock. Sunna Meditation: Drinking in the Sun Have the participants extend their hands upwards to the sky. Invite them to concentrate on the heat of Her presence. She is a Goddess of health, wholeness, and vitality. She is a Goddess of might in its purest, most unfettered manifestation. Invite them to drink in Her presence. This is something that they can do every single day. Go outside, stand in the sunlight and spend a few seconds or minutes drinking in Her warmth, drinking in Her presence, drinking in Her vitality. These are the gifts She offers us and they’re there for anyone who would reach out for them. When the officiant has the sense that everyone has done this to their own satisfaction, he or she should fill a horn with libation and pass it around the gathered folk, inviting each person to hail Sunna in their own words. Offerings The officiant then makes whatever offerings he or she has brought to Sunna, and invites the gathered folk to do the same. Thanks are then given to Sunna, for Her presence, Her strength, Her constancy, Her might. The ritual is completed by having the folk chant Her name, over and over until the energy peaks.

We made a Sun Wheel by lashing pieces of wood to a yard-wide metal hoop bought in a craft store, so as to form an eight-spoked wheel, and we covered the unsightly metal by wrapping it with colored yarn. More yarn was tied to the ends of the spokes and knotted together, about four feet up from the center of the wheel. A flat candle holder was affixed to the center. The first time that we did the rite that this one is based on, the wheel acquired its eight sacred dangly objects. After that, we would bind (with more colored yarn) evergreen boughs onto it. We always lit a short fat red candle in the center, where the strings were farthest away, but sometimes we put candles on the edges as well. When it was covered in fresh evergreens, we would cut oranges in half and hollow out the inside (throwing the orange bits into the Yule punch), and nestle the half-orange-peel cups in among the boughs holding votive candles. We never had a problem with the candles burning the fresh greenery or the wettish orange peels (if carefully arranged and watched), but if you try this, be very careful that no candle flames are near enough to the supporting strings to burn through them, or the whole thing will come down in a flaming mess. This rite uses at least nine people, so it’s a good one for an inside ritual where you’ve got a lot of folks who want to participate. Each person was dressed in the appropriate colors. Our sun symbol was trashpicked, someone’s thrown-away art project, a base with a big gilded metal spiral and a candle holder on top.

Hail to the cycle and the flow. Welcome to our hearth and home and tribe. This is the darkest day of the year, the longest night, when the Sun is swallowed up and dies. In ancient times, the Sun was brought back to life with fire and light on the Solstice. Let us imagine, now, those dark and ancient times. Go back six thousand years to a cold place. You are clad in clothing of rough wool and fur, and you speak a language unlike ours, yet with some words that will someday be passed on to us. Your people have lived in this cold place for so long that you remember the glaciers melting, the Ice Age receding. It is part of your creation myths. Imagine that you are standing in a clearing in the woods, the scent of pine all around you, just before dawn. It is freezing cold, and for days uncounted you have huddled inside next to a fire, with the sky too dark to work or even to see outside. Yet on this morning your eyes are fixed on a single standing stone, or perhaps a pole driven into the earth, which will prove the rebirth of the Sun which gives all life. Imagine that you watch the Sun rise, seeing it come up in its appointed place as it always does, and a hush of wonder falls over your tribe, crowded around you. It is the promise of the new year, the promise that the days will get longer, and eventually warmer, and the spring will come. You rejoice. You cheer. You weep with joy. You beat on drums and shout.

It is my hope that this book will be pleasing to Them, and useful to people who may wish to honor Mani, Sunna, and Their family but who don’t know where to begin. I’ve also included a list of suggested titles, books that have the potential to feed that devotional flame. Ultimately though, devotion, faith, spirituality are not found in books. They’re found in action, in a heart attuned to practice and experience. It is through experience that faith expands. It is through that expansion that religion becomes something other than an antique relic—carefully reconstructed, fanatically preserved, brittle, and lacking in true nourishment. To quote a Baltic proverb that my mother taught me: when it comes right down to the minutiae of devotion, “the work will teach you how to do it.” Books while precious, are only markers on that road of action. So ... may we all become drunk on our love and devotion to the Gods. May we lose ourselves in the profligacy of that inebriation. May the moon bless us in this divine lunacy; may the sun strengthen us in our words and in our deeds, and may Her sister give us fortitude. Hail to the house of Mundilfari.
