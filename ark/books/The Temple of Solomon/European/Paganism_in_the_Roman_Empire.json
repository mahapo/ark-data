If we imagined the British Empire of a hundredyears ago all in one piece, all of its parts touching each other, so that one could travel (not very fast, of course, in the days before the automobile) from Rangoon to Belfast without the interposition of any ocean, and if we could thus sense as one whole an almost limitless diversity of tongues, cults, traditions, and levels of education, then the true nature of the Medi-terranean world in the two centuries of this study would strike our minds. Then, too, we would acknowledge the inevitability of interchanges to a degree and with historical significance .not found earlier. Few corners of that ancient world can have lacked their own quite distinct way of life, as few can have felt no challenge at all to that way of life from others forced ontheir attention by their conquerors, or by their neighbors no longer sealedoff in enmity, or by soldiers, traders, government clerks, or inquisitive tourists and their slaves who knew shorthand. The tidy mind, abhorring so confused a scene, divides it for better com-prehension into several social strata, provinces, language areas, tax dis-tricts, and so forth. The Romans themselves treated what they had con-quered in this manner; in this manner its historians treat it today. But something is thereby lost, as if one tried to comprehend a good rich Irishstew by eating in succession, no matter with what speed, each one of its ordinary ingredients. In this book I try to repair that loss. It is on the system as a whole andinterchange within it that I focus. The constituent parts, the individual cults and their derivation and internal nature, are not my concern. I begin by surveying the variety so as to subordinate the lesser to the more important cults. From there I move on to the question, Who cared, and howmuch, about religion? From that to the categories of written evidence that can be used in answer-themselves so many forms of advertisement for one or another cult. From that to the concourse attracted by cults in their dailyroutine or at special festivals. And after this group of topics, all having todo with the outer face of religion, I address a second group, dealing first with the inner vitality of paganism as a whole and its roots in urgent human needs, and next with the vitality of certain of its parts and the extent xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii Preface to which one can discern a dynamic in paganism across the two hundred years chosen for study. It is, after all, change and movement that historians are expected to talk about. In handling such topics, naturally I aim at broad, clear statements. They are not easy to frame. I have found myself continually having to distin-guish, for accuracy's sake, between the views and practices common in one kind of source but not in all or in one class of person but not in some other. The need for accuracy sets me at odds with my own aim of easy generaliza-tion. It also sets me at odds with many of my predecessors, including \"Franz Cumont, whose unique authority in the field is universally acknowledged.\" • So far as possible, I have left argument to the endnotes; but some sense of controversy inevitably appears in, and complicates, the text of my discus-sion. In the religious history of the Roman Empire, the chief event was of course the triumph of Christianity. It would be good if the pages that fol-low helped to explain how the one religion could succeed universally across the endless variety of cults surrounding it. It seems fair to infer from that universality, however, some set of broadly shared religious ideas and practices within the boundaries of which Christianity could make its con-verts in Gaul as in Syria; or to put it in other words, the thing so arrogantly called paganism, being in fact all the many hundreds of the Empire's reli-gions save one, must really have shared certain widespread characteristics. It remains to determine what they were within the spans of time and space that saw the triumph of Christianity. The area may be roughly marked out within the two centuries before Nicaea (or the two centuries of the Apolo-gists, Quadratus up to certain works of Athanasius, let us say), and within the oblong of territory having as its corners Alexandria and Origen, Car-thage and Tertullian, Lyon and lrenaeus, and Pontus and Gregory the Wonder-worker (not an Apologist, granted, but a great missionary and saint). These are the names and reasons which set the boundaries around my curiosity. The epilogue is no more than that. Had I been competent to handle Judaeo-Christian texts, early Church history, art and epigraphy, then I might have attempted something more. In explaining the triumph of Christianity, however, the first need that I see is to sponge out of the picture of paganism those false outlines and colors that have been painted in over •Marcel Simon (himself no mean authority), speaking in praise of Cumont's Religions orientales, in Religious Studies 9 (1973), 392."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Preface xiii the course of the present century.

FINDING ORDER IN CHAOS To move about in the Roman Empire at all, or to make the hastiest survey of its religious variety, brings home the pullulation of beliefs. The standard Roman city, if such a thing could have been discovered within its bound-aries, would need room for temples to the Capitoline Triad (Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva), plus Mercury, Isis and Sarapis, Apollo, Liber Pater, Hercu-les, Mars, Venus, Vulcan, and Ceres. So Vitruvius recommends, the archi-tect writing about 27 B.c. and speaking (On Architecture 1.7.1) of Italy in general. But he indicates cities with gymnasia, hence he is including the more Hellenized southern parts of the peninsula. At the other extreme, in the secluded little Val di Non among the Alpine foothills, an even more generous pantheon appears in dedications set up to Jupiter, chief, and Minerva, Apollo, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Diana, Luna, Hercule.s, Mithra, an~ Isis, with only the one true native, Ducavavius.1 Inscriptions from Philippi in Macedonia give us a Greco-Roman mix of Jupiter or Zeus, Juno or Hera, Minerva or Athena, the properly Italian Vertumnus and the properly regional Souregethes, Myndrytus or Etepancus, to the number of two dozen or more deities;2 just as the coins of Nicomedia, farther east, advertise more than forty that receive worship in that city, Sabazius ancil Isis and A pis and Sarapis, Helios, Cybele and Men (all extraneous), plus dozens of more familiar Greek names.3 Or we can read the satirist Lucian, in mid-second century imagining a congress in heaven well attended by Bendis (from Thrace), Anubis (Egypt), Mithras (Persia), and Attis and Men from different parts of Asia Minor, not to mention another half-dozen more often seen on Olympus;• and Eusebius a few generations later reels off the wor-ship in different provinces of Horus, Isis and Osiris, or Melkart and Ousoros, or Dusaris and Obdos, or Zalmoxis, or Mopsos, depending on whether you found yourself in Arabia, Egypt, or some other place.5 That last testimony points to an obvious explanation for so many gods: not that the Thracians and the rest, to say nothing of Greeks and Romans, 1"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 Perceptible were especially given to the picturing of new unseen powers about them, but that the political unit here under survey had been assembled out of many peoples, each of which had its own system of faith. In the course of time, conflict had brought into being successively fewer but larger states that drew strength from the absorption of divine, as of human, resources. To rehearse that whole story would be to rehearse the whole of ancient his-tory. The process was now over. Rome's Empire under our gaze was com-plete, and completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth. Perhaps not quite completely: Jews off and on, Christians off and on, Druids for good and all, fell under ban, in the first century of the era. So did human sacrifice. In the second century, laws forbade mutilation, even vol-untary and for divine service. But humanitarian views were the cause, not bigotry. For laws against soothsayers, the cause was fear of popular unrest, not any hostility to preaching in itself. 6 Even a Christian could declare that everyone's ancestral beliefs were permitted-ta patria.7 That was only half the story. The other half was a widespread feeling that to slight the gods, plural, was wrong. I leave aside the active persecution of Jews and Christians, except to note that monotheists rated as atheists: to have one's own god counted for nothing if one denied everybody else's.8 I leave aside also, for later discussion, the existence of real atheism. But there was very little doubt in people's minds that the religious practices of one generation should be cherished without change by the next, whether within one's own community or another's. To be pious in any sense, to be respect-able and decent, required the perpetuation of cult, even if one's judges themselves worshiped quite other gods. So the Jews could be excused be-cause they were at least loyal to their own inherited error, as one of them can declare to a pagan audience. He declares, of course, only a reason that he is sure will be acceptable. It duly appears unprompted in the mouths of pagans.9 Entangled in exactly the same presuppositions, Christians were continually on the defensive as deserters from what was seen to be their true spiritual home, namely Judaism. They replied by appealing to considera-tions that might weigh against ancestral piety, for example, \"philosophy\" and \"reason\" against \"superstition\" and ta patria. Whatever their answer, the debate demonstrated polemically one of the bedrock beliefs of both the Greek-and Latin-speaking halves of the Empire in the second century and on into the fourth, a belief presented, moreover, out in the public arena and intended to win approval from a wide audience. 10 As Eusebius explains it, pagans \"have thoroughly persuaded themselves that they act rightly in honoring the deities, and that we are guilty of the greatest impiety in making no account of powers so manifest and so beneficent, but directly break the laws, which require everyone to reverence ancestral custom, ta"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1. Finding Order in Chaos J patria, and not to disturb what should be inviolable, but to walk orderly in following the religion of our forefathers, and not to be meddlesome through love of innovation.\" 11 Less often because less stimulated by opposition, pagans thinking only of other pagans affirm exactly similar views. \"Such is the chief fruit of piety,\" says Porphyry, \"to hono~ the divinity according to one's ancestral custom.\" 12 Porphyry indicates one reason anyway for saying what he does: the impious man wrongs his own forebears as well as the deity.1~ Human at-tachment to parents or grandparents inspires the perpetuation of whatever they held dear. Plutarch's father reveals a little more, through the warmth with which he asserts, \"The ancestral, ancient faith suffices in itself, than which no demonstration can be declared or discovered more palpable ... \"; and in Plutarch's own generation, among his circle of friends, various members express very similar and very lovingly espoused opinions about religion.14 All these passages do no more than testify, however, to what anyone would assume to have existed throughout the Roman world, that is, a strong emotional element in religious conservatism. What is more particular and useful is the hint in the quotation from Eusebius above, that innovation in itself was not only painful but bad. \"New'' was a term of dis-approval, used in that sense both in and beyond the debates between pagans and Christians; 15 \"old\" was good. In the apologies written by Christians, the reader is struck by the emphasis, through position near the front of the works or through length and frequency of discussion, accorded to proving the religion of the jews, Moses, and the Pentateuch,older than Hellenism, Homer, and the Iliad, or to proving the priority of Jewish ethical positions over Platonic. The writers agreed, then, with Hesiod's mode of reasoning, which Porphyry appeals to: \"ancient law is best law.\" \"With you pagans, too,\" says Tertullian, \"it is almost a religion to demand belief on the basis of age.\" We could add many other statements to the same effect.16 All that needs to be marked out in them is the common ground occupied by authors of divergent origins or aims and their audiences, providing a ready respect for all cults. Truth as well as venerability had been established through the number of persons approving, whose approval was in turn implied by the long survival of an idea or custom. The result was seen as a sort of com-munity decision formed across time, slowly fixed, and therefore even more slowly to be set aside. On that view, more than any other, rested toleration of beliefs boasting a long past. \"Ancestral\" is a term ordinarily applied to deities in inscriptions in one of two ways. In the first, it salutes \"him who watches over us here at home,\" and other adjectives may be added to make the feeling clearer: \"guard-ian,\" \"patron.\" 17 The individual or the community asserts some special"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4 Perceptible claim and devotion. For whatever reason, such rich language is far easier to find in epigraphy of the eastern provinces than of the western. The second way in which the word \"ancestral\" is most often attached to a deity is for remembrance's sake and from a sense of being a stranger abroad. A letter of the Tyrians settled in Puteoli, addressed to their original home, uses the term in appealing for financial help to maintain traditional cults.18 Anum-ber of other texts from Italy but more often from less central regions record the lonely and fervent thoughts of strangers turned back to their homes. The particularly possessive assertion of loyalty to local gods 'can be noticed in still a third way, though much less frequently: on the occasion of prayer for the imperial family, in the form \"to the ancestral god Such-and-Such for the well-being of our emperor.\" 19The latterfor his part repaid the courtesy, when he visited a city, by offering some cult object in precious metal, a statuette or the like, or simply a prayer to the god of that place. So Hadrian, being in the vicinity, climbed to the sanctuary of Zeus Casius; again, made an offering to Aglibol and Malakbel of Palmyra. Caracalla offered a sacrifice to Asclepius at Pergamon, an act advertised on coins; and Diocletian dedicated an offering to Minerva at Ilium, to Zeus and Leto at Didyma, to the sun god at Comum, to Mithra at Carnuntum, and to Bele-n us at Aquileia.2o Evenhanded respect shown by the emperors to the famil-iar pantheon was shown also to divine figures of only regional fame. Regional or topical names: Tars giving his name to Tarsus, Kakasbos of Telmessos, Vintius on the northern Rhone.21 Of such, there is no end and no story. A step up in prominence are those names of localities (really at-testing purely local gods) that are tacked on to the better known, like Zeus Thamaneitanos in Lebanon, Artemis of Perge, Mother of Zizima-not the great Mother Cybele.22 In the eastern provinces it is Zeus around whom, or hyphenated with whom, the richest ferment of devotion gathers-there exist some dozens of local versions in Caria alone, for example-and in the western provinces, Mars.2~ These transformations, substitutions, elisions, conjunctions, impostures, whatever they may be called and of whatever origin or end, produced an approach to a defined pantheon for the whole Empire much closer in titulature than in reality. Labels had been attached to the outside of hundreds of separate worships that were in fact very little changed from their form as it had been before Greek or Roman conquest. We will return to the matter later. For the moment it is enough to recall those lists of independent and by no means entirely Greco-Roman gods and goddesses cited above, from writers like Vitruvius, Lucian, or Eusebius; to which we can add more, from Minucius Felix-\"among the Eleusinians, Ceres; among the Phrygians, the Mother; among the Epidaurians, Aesculapius; among the Chaldaeans,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1. Finding Orckr in Chaos Ba'al; Astarte, for the Syrians; Diana, for the Taurians; among the Gauls, Mercury\" -or from his contemporary and fellow-African, Tertullian. Ter-tullian has a wider range, taking in Astarte for the Syrians but also Dusares for the Arabians, Belenus in Noricum, Caelestis in Africa.u A little later, the lawyer Ulpian offers quite a different selection of deities recognized by the government as entitled to re.ceive bequests. Of the eight, five are to be found in western Asia Minor.25 He has apparently picked out the more familiar names from some much longer list; or perhaps only more familiar ones stood much chance of gaining grants of money; but in any case he excludes the exotic ones that Apologists fortheir own faith might choose, for polemical reasons, and he excludes the conservative Italian and long-naturalized onesthat Vitruvius must think of when reviewing the likely needs of Roman cities. The purpose pursued thus far, to find some grip, some orderly way by which the mind can fasten on the shapeless profusion of polytheism, can be advanced a little further through the epigraphic evidence. We have at our disposal a quarter of a million published inscriptions. A sizable share have something to do with religion. Those from the Latin-speaking parts of our field of survey are well indexed (not the Greek inscriptions) so that some impression may be easily gained of what deities appear most often. The bar graph below shows the relative popularity of the fourteen most mentioned, so far as inscriptions can be trusted, and excluding the most popular of all in each district: that is, Jupiter everywhere except Africa. In Africa, Saturn is added to Jupiter to make a more trustworthy total.26 In the four districts, the number of all inscriptions of all sorts naturally differs; the customs dictating how commonly religion received mention on stone at all may have differed, too; so for each of the four districts the total of the numerically dominant god has been determined and divided into the number of men-tions of the other fourteen gods, to yield a percentage. The percentage is what determines the length of the bar for the fourteen. The results must be discussed again in the second chapter, but they need some qualification immediately. First, a goddess like Nemesis, much fa-vored in the eastern provinces, has little following in the western and by average therefore fails to make tbe select company of those tabulated; 27 similarly Caelestis in Africa and Belen us in Venetia, though both appear in Tertullian's list. Next, allowance must be made for the gods not being what they appear, as, for instance, Apollo sometimes hiding a Gallic god of oracles, Hercules sometimes hiding a Phoenician or Punic god, and so forth. This produces one distortion in particular: Mercury served as the chief translation into Latin for the dominant Celtic deity Teutates,28 and one cannot ordinarily be sure when that translation has been made or not."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"FREQUENCY OF MENTIONS OF DEITIES RELATIVE TO JUPITER IN INDICES TO THE CORPUS OF LATVII INSCRIPTIONS AE~APJJS APOLLO DIANA FORTIMA HERCULES ... \"\" \"\"\" \"\"\"' ~ \"' '//// \"\"\" ISIS-SARAPtS .....

Finding Order in Chaos 7 Finally, certain localities rich in evidence beyond their actual size of popu-lation are disproportionately represented, though the gods they favor maynot be favored more widely. This inflates the importance of Jupiter Doli-chenus especially, in Africa, through the disproportionate number of texts from the military camp and nearby civilian city of Lambaesis. The frontier zone has the same effect again on Dolichenus in the total of texts from Gaul and Germany. And exclusion of Ostia has the reverse effect of deflating cer-tain numbers-of eastern deities like Isis, Cybele, and Mithra-Sol, but alsoof Venus and Silvanus-in the total from ltaly.29 For what it may be worth, private worship in Pompeii favored Fortuna first, then Vesta, and Bacchus· Liber, Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury in that order. All figure in the group of fourteen-plus-Jupiter used for the bar graph, with the exception of Vesta, who naturally bulks larger than life in domestic worships. so The sizable presence of Jupiter, even here, and of course overwhelmingly in public inscriptions, contradicts the view that worship of the supreme deity was mere empty ceremony. Because of the unlucky way they have been published, to say nothing of their far smaller numbers and arbitrary clustering in particular sites, Greekinscriptions cannot be used to provide even a general impression of the hierarchy of worships in the east. But, in a standard collection for Asia Minor, if one sets aside Zeus, invoked two and a half times as often as anyother god, the rest offer no surprises: Apollo, Athena, Dionysus ( =Liber), Artemis (=Diana), Hera (=Juno), Aphrodite (=Venus), Asdepius, Tyche (=Fortuna), Hercules, and the Great Mother (=Cybele), in that order.31 Overlap with the picture in the north and west is striking, but good Greekgods and goddesses, Athena and Hera, more than take the place of the oriental Mithra, Jupiter Do lichen us, Isis, and the rest. Even Cybele enjoys little prominence. The many gods of the second and third centuries can be arranged in some sort of ranking, then, with ten or fifteen rather easily identifiable ones ,atop.a mass beyond ordering. There is a clear summit to this pyramid, Zeus!: Jupiter; there are much less clear planes of cleavage in the pyramid accord· ing to regions rather uncertainly defined. But lastly, the gods may bear· ranged according to the social position of their worshipers. That the human population of the Empire formed a pyramid like the divine, anyone would guess. Perhaps its strange proportions, however, need to be recalled, with the senators, governors, legionary commanders, and in short almost every single name to be found in the ancient historians lying at the absolute tip, that is, within the upper I percent, while a similar figure circumscribes the bare names (lacking anything else we would like toknow about them) that appear in municipal senates; so the extreme steep·"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 Perceptible ness of that upward slope from the masses to the local leadership is the prime fact to be noted in society of the times. 32 But it is important further to determine if the social fact had anything to do with religious feelings. Where digging unearths the objects offered in sacrifice, as in some of the sanctuaries west or south of Carthage or in eastern Gaul, they vary a lot in cost of manufacture, indicating that rich and poor alike worshiped in the same place and the same way. And in eastern sanctuaries great crowds, plainly of all conditions, gathered in holy days to perform the same rites in honor of the same divinity. Against such evidence, on the other hand, there are to be set, first, more than ample testimony to a gulf separating rich from poor, in contexts having nothing to do with religion but suggesting broad habits of thought; and second, explicit statements that emphasize the gulf. These deserve consideration. What is likely first to attract notice are the blunt words of contempt and disapproval with which the lettered aristocracy, in talking about religious views, belabor the simple, unthinking, ordinary folk, the unlearned.33 It is a pagan, but it could almost equally well be a Christian, who deplores any sort of theological speculation by the \"crude untaught raw yokels, to whom it is not even granted to understand citizen affairs, let alone to discuss the divine,\" 34 just as it is a pagan who tries to place Christianity among the \"goatherds and shepherds, led astray by yokel tricks,\" \"the stupid and ser-vile,\" \"wool-workers, cobblers, laundry-workers, the most illiterate and bucolic yokels,\" only to be answered by a Christian's description of detrac-tors as \"the scum of the marketplace, a godless chorus of superstition.\" 35 Each polemist assumes that his words will strike a sympathetic chord in his audience-readers in both camps, that is, and the more than literate. A public speaker on the other hand must go about it differently. He must not think to offer profound poems on religious subjects \"to the crowd and the populace, for they will be thought pretty unpersuasive and ridiculous by the masses.\" 36 We may note in passing the categories that are held up for derision: in cities, petty artisans and people of no fixed place of business, the unproper-tied; in the countryside, peasants; also, everywhere, slaves, children, and women.37 What we do not find in anyone is a sense of distance from some particular ethnic enclave, nor even from life in the backcountry. The line of cleavage that counts is a matter not of place, then, but of cultivation, or, we may say, of culture. That line would correspond very considerably with one of class; but among those managing to attain a higher education, there were always some not born to it. Whatever their origin, the educated were exposed to ideas beyond the horizon of the unschooled. Thus they some-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"1. Finding Order in Chaos 9 times grew away from the most broadly held beliefs. It is common to find specific distinction made between a theology or point of creed proper for the masses and another reserved for the learned, for initiates, or for believers specially capable of deeper understanding.ss Anyone in the Empire who ever picked up a book must have been aware of the two kinds of know ledge, inner and outer, in the philosophic schools, mystery religions, or other pagan or Judaeo-Christian religious circles. It might be treated lightly and with common sense, as a fact of life calling for a simpler and selective presentation of doctrine to the unlearned (so Cle-ment), or it might be treated heavily and with dark exaggeration, to arouse awe of secrets about to be revealed (so in magical papyri). In all its forms, however, it reminds us of something important for the forming of a just acquaintance with ancient polytheism: the testimony that reaches us on paper-papyrus, parchment-comes from witnesses of a particular kind, not only a tiny minority within the whole population but one whose mem-bers generally felt themselves to be different from the majority, different in culture, sometimes aggressively so. When they speak to us about religion as they observed it in the rest of their world, their report must be heard criti-cally. When they speak about their own ideas and feelings, though they are much more to be trusted, their report cannot be used as the basis for any generalization about the whole. The point might seem obvious but is some-times forgotten-with the less reason, given the varieties of countervailing evidence. In truth, even if we define \"literary\" evidence very broadly to include fragments of philosophical treatises or collections of laws, it holds disap-pointingly little on our subject: the essay on the Syrian goddess ascribed to Lucian, the dosing chapters of Apuleius's novel, the spiritual diaries of Marcus Aurelius (but that is really philosophy), and Aelius Aristides (and that is hypochondria), all amounting to a couple of hundred pages quite ill suited to the demands of our curiosity. However enlarged by oddments from the satirists or historians, the dark theologists and seers (to whom we must return in the next chapter), this whole body of writings suggests (wrongly, as will appear) that the inhabitants of the Empire were simply not much interested in the variety of worships around them. Had that been true, of course the vitality of interchange would have been correspondingly low, and our subject would bear a very different character. When one wanted to refer in broad terms to the library of available infor-mation about religion, the headings first offered were \"poets and philoso-phers.\" The pair are a fixture in the Apologists. 59 By \"poets\" were meant Homer above all but Hesiod also, and others.

Moreover, all poesy was divinely inspired, according to its practitioners; 40 and the great ones, at least, were so widely known in the Greek world that reference to them would be understood among all the literate. 41 To be sure, they had no equivalent in the Latin west. Neither did the philosophers. That fact did not deter Latin writers from using both members of the pair as touchstones in debate and verification, for they joined in generally intelligible abbreviation the two main aspects of reli-gious heritage: myth and theology, the irrational and the rational, or how-ever it might be phrased. Philosophy interpreted the poets. The interpreta-tions by Plato and other heads and followers of all the schools circulated not only in works still surviving but in many others unfortunately lost: by the Epicureans Philodemus and Diogenianus, by the Stoics Cornutus and his contemporaries the Elder Seneca and Heraclitus, writing treatises on theology; by the Cynic Oenomaus in the second century who exposed reli-gious frauds, as the Elder Seneca had written on superstition; and by a number of Platonists, notably Numenius and Porphyry in the second and third centuries, the latter in works some of which survive, some of which are known only through quotation.42 There were special treatises that focused on a single cult, 43 others dealing with particular iiturgies and rules of sacrifice. 44 Anyone too lazy to refer to them or in a center too small to supply them might turn to more or less standard handbooks on religion, by Apollodorus in Greek and Varro in Latin.45 The object of this rapid survey is the measurement of educated interest in the subject of our study. True, the evidence that can be brought to bear is very little for the span of two centuries in question. It weighs little against the popularity of the sensational-against \"the tens of thousands\" of essays on oracles that Eusebius mentions, with whatever exaggeration, 46 or against those scenes of worship, marvelous signs, or picturesque rites generally called for in novels and generally supplied.47 But more intellectual works could still find a public in the west as in the east. That public was certainly quite small. On the other hand, we can go on to show that it shared its enthusiasms in unexpected ways with a consider-ably wider community. A traveler to Argos in the 170s found a guide there ready to unfold local myths in poetic version; a novelist or biographer, it is not clear which, has his hero at a temple in Elis encounter the author of a just-finished disquisition on Zeus, which he plans to recite in public the next day; most extraordinary, a citizen from an obscure place inland in Asia Minor obtains permission from the authorities to inscribe on a wall near the city center, in columns six feet high and across a distance of well over fifty yards, it cannot be said how much more, a collection of mainly philo-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1. Finding OrdeT in Chaos 11 sophie, partly theological texts. 48 The inscription would strike the eye of small farmers and peddlers as they came to market. Its author sought to raise their thoughts to a higher plane. With what success, who can say? The substance of the collection of writings is elevated, the language at points obscure, but Diogenes the expositor of the whole must know his fellow citi • zens better than we and thinks to address them all. He makes clear that he is also in erudite correspondence with students like himself in Athens, Rhodes, Thebes, and other cities. He is not alone, then, in his passionate interest in theosophy. And before he is dismissed as unique, his effort to share it with the general public should be put side by side with something similar at Phlius, where, in the third century, an observer could study \"the so-called 'rites of the Great Mother.' There is a portico in it [the city] and in the por· tico is depicted to this day an outline of all the doctrines expounded. Many things are depicted in that portico that Plutarch discussed, too, in his books On Empedocles.\" 49 In addition to general public libraries, temple libraries are attested in both the Greek and Latin halves of the Empire. so There is no special reason why they should be mentioned at all, so their presence can perhaps be imagined at most large centers. Public lectures presented in temples also crop up casually, at Aigeai and elsewhere (we will return to them); and temples drew people interested in discussion of philosophy and religion-the man Plutarch met at Delphi, perpetual note-taker and intellectual tourist, lately returned from Egypt and points east, or the other stranger back from Britain, all three joining Ammonius the philosopher in the temple of Apollo, for a good talk.s1 Such travelers will reappear later. Temples had resident experts, their theologues, ready to join the discus· sion.s2 An epitaph from early in our period or a little before praises \"the man. of many books, guardian of all research, who picks out the ancient page of the poets; lover of wisdom, Gorgos mighty in mind, the servant of the tripod in Apollonian Claros.\" A wonder of learning! ss But no doubt Claros was atypical: a much bigger and better equipped shrine than most, and as an oracle, for the preparation of responses, specially in need of some· one like Gorgos. Great pains might be expended on determining the things most suitably to be said, offered, or done before a given temple. When a new cult center was established, all this had to be made clear at the very outset and posted where strangers could not help but see the regulations they must follow. Regulations were needed for the worship of a man's son, revealed to be a demigod or hero; they must be specified for worship of a little-known local Jupiter-the-Free in an Italian village5• or ad hoc for relief of particular situ·"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"12 Perceptible ations.55 Some required re-publication through the fresh cutting of an inscription blurred by age.56 Cult associations bound their members to detailed usages, 57 incidentally offering us a glimpse of what not to do: you were not to vomit up your wine or carve your initials on the walls of the temple's banquet rooms. 58 But entrants in general, at whatever sanctuary, were likely to find notice of what was expected: you were to present yourself suitably clothed, uncontaminated by recent childbirth, by sexual inter-course with woman or dog, by sight or touch of a corpse, or by consuming pork or garlic or milk; 59 you were to offer specified animals in sacrifice to specified deities, or not animals but wine only, or incense only; and at par-ticular shrines you were to respect local conditions, not lighting a fire near the walls, not poaching sacred fish or cutting trees in the sacred grove. Directions might be given on the whole range of daily service, a subject that will recur. And the text might be very long-190 lines, at the shrine of Demeter and Kore in Andania-or very short. At Athens, \"by oracle from Hygieia and Asclepius: the celestial serpent of the gods [directs the setting up of?] these statues, where should be offered sacrifices unmixed with wine, on the 5th and lOth of the month at noon. Send a good taste to the good gods! \"&o \"By oracle\" was a common way of finding out what the gods wanted. The learned Gorgos would intervene for that purpose, after consulting the proper works of reference. They were, as we have seen, readily available to say what was proper for every sort of divine purpose and why.&1 Neopy-thagoreans and Neoplatonists were full of information about the effects of diet or sexual regimen on worship, or about the reasons for offering sacri-fices on one rather than on some other day of the year. Research in their treatises and the like would lie behind the moment when \"the god replied oracularly.\" 62 Occasionally a god was alleged to have spoken through some person he had chosen as his voice, his commands being duly recorded on stone.63 Sometimes, again, ancestral customs might be invoked to sanc-tify the rules of worship because, simply by virtue of their great age, they could only have been learned from the gods themselves. 64 Whatever the means by which they were communicated, cult practices made up a body of revealed truth rich in content and stimulating to in-formed piety. Anyone who wanted could read the rules prominently on display. At Oenoanda, home of the eccentric Diogenes, a city wall bore the text of one of the answers given by Apollo of Claros to a certain Theophilus who, in the early third century, inquired about the nature of the divinity. He was told: \"Born from himself, innately wise, without mother, unshake-able, abiding no name but many-named, living in fire, that is god. But we"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"1. Finding Order in Chaos lJ are particles of god, his messengers. Whatever persons ask god what he is, he answers, 'Looking upon him, the Aether, the All-seeing god, pray facing east in the morning.'\" At Claros, this too on stone: \"When someone asked Apollo whether the soul remained after death or was dissolved, he answered, 'The soul, so long as it is subject to its bonds with the destructible body, while being immune to feelings, resembles the pains of that [the body]; but when it finds freedom after the mortal body dies, it is borne entire to the aether, being then forever ageless, and abides entirely untroubled; and this the First-born Divine Providence enjoined.'\" Direct glimpses of celestial verities could be had not only through inscriptions scattered about Miletus but collected for easier reference in the Oracle Archive in neighboring Didyma. Before the mid-third century a compilation circulated. Lactantius used it and, much more fully, the pagan theologian Porphyry, in the writing of his Philosophy Drawn from Oracles.&s Before leaving the subject of religious practices as they were described for contemporaries in epigraphic form, note should be taken of the wide spread of so-called sacred laws given to cult centers. Certainly more often drawn (and better edited in modern dress) from the Greek-speaking prov· inces, they are known also from Palmyra, Africa, Italy, and Dalmatia.66 A dedicant C. Domitius Valens puts up a long notice in Salonae to fix the right procedures for sacrifice to Jupiter, and \"the other regulations for this altar shall be the same as those assigned to the altar of Diana on the Aven~ tine [in Rome]. By these regulations and within these points, as I have de· dared, this altar I give, assign and dedicate to you, Jupiter best and greatest, that you may willingly favor me and my colleagues, municipal senators, citizens and residents of the Julian Martian colony of Salonae, and our wives and children.'' The text serves as reminder of the particular character borne by the re· gions within Rome's reach: far more susceptible to cultural challenge than the eastern half of the Empire, where various ways of life were so much better able to maintain their differences; far more directly touched by a civilization, the Roman, that actively favored uniformity and made use of it in the planting of its outposts. From even a cursory reading of Caesarian colonial charters, it is easy to sense that Roman inclination and to infer some corresponding pressure from the center to establish traditional Roman worships in traditional Roman forms wherever settlements were made. If we have only the one lex sacra of Diana used for such a purpose, we can at least see it taken as a model in the establishing of practices at two other points, in Italy and Gaul, and with the key phrase, \"this temple shall have the same laws as Diana at Rome on the Aventine,\" all reduced to abbre-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 Perceptible viations-obviously from being routinely repeated in records now lost to us. On the larger question, what to make of the chance survival of evidence on stone and the distortions to be feared in the resulting picture, there can of course be no last word. As a working principle, better too much caution than too little. Yet the single inscriptions of Valens, of Diogenes, and of Gorgos each invite generalization outward to whole categories of people and practices. Of all three men, assessment may and should be made by asking oneself, What surrounding and supporting modes of behavior must be assumed to account for their having done, in the face of their whole com-munity, what each of them plainly did do? Students of ancient religion or of society or culture in any of its manifestations must be willing to pause over individual pieces of evidence and make an attendant effort of imagi-nation, in which the only aid that can be expected will come from a survey of analogies. That means footnotes. Apology may as well be entered here as at some other point for all the dense documentation that my purpose seems to call for. In the broadest terms, it is at least clear that a very great deal of religious lore was not only in lively motion among educated people but actively thrust upon their attention from the walls of public buildings in cities east and west. The lex sacra is not the only genre of exposition (or however we might call it) that is hardly known to us save through inscriptions: there is are-talogy as well, the narrating of wondrous powers at work. Thus an inscrip-tion from a temple in Stratonicea states \"that statues are set up ... of the aforesaid deities [Zeus of Panamara, Hecate of Lagina, and others-see below] to make known the wondrous deeds, aretai, of their power,'' through further inscriptions no doubt displayed on the bases.67 Narratives of this sort found an eager audience. Hence professionals, hawking them about-heard agog by the simple but scorned by the wise. Hence, too, a half-dozen texts that survive on stone around the Aegean from as far back as the second or first century B.c. running down to the third century A.D., all in honor of Isis. Their common source one dedicant places in Memphis's Ptah temple: a source already in Greek, however, and in a style that would blend easily into the Greek world. One derived version slips into literature in excerpts; another, into both verse and prose on stone. The most recent version runs like this: To Karpokrates, to Sarapis, to the ears of Isis, to Osiris who gives heed, to Hestia who rears from childhood [ ... ] I am Karpokrates, son of Sara pis and Isis, of Demeter and Kore and Dionysus and Iacchus [kin?], brother of Sleep and Echo.

Liguris (What the name Liguris signifies at the bottom, and who Titanius is, no one knows.) Isiac hymns survive in Latin prose of the second century, in first-and third-century papyri, and from the pen of the second-century poet Meso-medes. 68 Apuleius in the second century celebrated Asclepius as he had learned to do in the god's temple at Athens, in both prose and verse, but published in North Africa-\"published\" both through declamation and circulation as books in Latin. 69 There is a still-surviving Latin hymn to the Mother of the Gods, and in Greek, on papyrus, an author's unfinished verses to Dionysus; 1o and there are favorite old hymns now lost71 and other favorites even more ancient, recovered now from inscriptions: the Paeans to Asclepius by Ariphron of about 400 B.C. and by Sophocles a generation earlier,72 plus some otherwise unknown verses to the god by Aelius Aris-tides. 1s These last are somewhat fragmentary; but it is pleasant to think that in a museum in Turkey a traveler today can read the same stone read by that gifted, boring, tenacious, pitiable, godly sufferer who dedicated years of residence to the healing sanctuary at Pergamon, undergoing a thousand experiences of divine assistance recorded for us in his spiritual diary. It is pleasant to suppose, too, even if we cannot be quite certain, that Sophocles' verses were sung before temples of Asclepius every morning in series un-broken for six hundred years up to (and, as we know, more centuries be-yond) the date at which their text in his own city was most recently inscribed on stone. That particular inscription is on a monument containing several other similar compositions, not all by very inspired poets. Further epigraphic texts could be added to them in good number, and from as far afield as"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16 Perceptible Mauretania and Britain. 74 But clearly their ancestry and origin had once been Greek, and in the lands of that language is found the bulk of evidence about what hymns were like, who wrote them, for what purpose, and how they were sung. So-called Orphic ones survive in a collection perhaps the best known (though there were other collections in use).75 It contains twenty-eight rather sorry exercises six to forty lines long, sometimes addressed to local deities of Asia Minor (where all the poems were written, most likely in the second or third century), more often to deities like Artemis, Asclepius, Eros, and Hermes. For example, the ninth: twelve lines that string together nothing but thirty-three adjectives, seven adjectival phrases, two impera-tive verbs, and two nouns (\"king\" and \"maiden\"), one of which is very boldly repeated three times. Sophocles did better! But it is not untypical of the genre, in apostrophizing the deity named, describing him or her hon-orifically as descended in thus-and-such a line, capable of thus-and-such wondrous actions, known in thus-and-such celestial haunts, gracious to petitioners, Hail! Attend! Occasions needing particular celebration in verse outnumbered and exhausted the Muses. There was the initiation of aspirants to a fuller knowledge of some god,76 plagues or imperial visits to be called to divine attention, 77 festival parades, and daily services. 78 Quality suffered. For hymns, simple shouted phrases might be substituted in the god's honor (for Asclepius at Pergamon, at least sometimes) or the mystic litany, \"Bedu, zaps, chthon, plectron, sphinx, cnaxzbich, thuptes, phlegmo, drops!\" (for Apollo at Didyma).79 Instrumental accompaniment one expected to hear from worshipers of Cybele, Mother of the Gods, both those itinerant and at fixed sanctuaries. Typically, they played pipes made with reeds like oboes or bagpipes, ahl bagpipes of a shrill and carrying note. 80 The cithara belonged especially to Apollo;81 to Isis, the rattle (sistrum), along with other instruments.82 Cen-sorious writes, \"If it (music] were not welcome to the immortal gods, theater spectacles would not have been instituted to conciliate the gods, the horn-player would not be used in all sacrifices in sacred temples, nor would triumphal parades be conducted with the horn or bass-horn player in honor of Mars, with the cithara for Apollo, with the pipes for the Muses .... \"83 The picture Censorious offers, of accompaniment suited to the god hon-ored, may be too schematic, but in its broad assertion of the habitual place of music in worship it is certainly true to life.lt serves further to introduce scenes of worship that are not Greek. In fact, music could be heard at shrines of many -we cannot be sure of all-large regions throughout the Empire. 84 Both at the heart of Greece and in an obscure shrine of Asia, both"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"I. Finding Order in Chaos 17 to the great Apollo and to the unknown Sinuri, hymns were inscribed on their temple's walls with musical notation, presumably to instruct casual worshipers in the most acceptable tune.85 Hymners who appear to have been specialists and at least semiprofessional were sometimes heard; but they cost more than cities, and obviously more than cult groups, could easily afford; so either the emperor paid for them to serve the imperial cult or they served more than one master.86 The word \"hymner,\" hymnodos, may also indicate a sort of master of musical ceremonies, semihonorific. Choruses made up of amateurs were the general rule where cult and music were joined, choruses sometimes of men or women of the upper class, sometimes of their daughters, normally of their sons, boys before their voices changed. 87 They sang in groups of twenty-five or thirty, except when they traveled to the oracle of Apollo at Claros near Colophon. Then they usually numbered nine. As many in-scriptions from Claros make plain, it was almost obligatory for corporate inquirers, that is, cities as such, to return thanks for answers given them by singing a hymn. In the second century, when the oracle enjoyed great fame, it heard delegations of boys, their trainers, and conductors from many distant places. 88lt is odd to think of little groups of children, of course very strictly chaperoned, traveling a hundred miles or more to the sanctuary \"in obedience to the oracle,\" as the inscriptions declare. After their performance was over, they had their names put up on the walls of the shrine, along with the names of the adults in the party. From hymnology and aretalogy to my point of departure-general knowl· edge about religion-! return by way of hymners who were also theolo· gians, or theologians who were in charge of religious music; 89 for in either combination they suggest a close working relation between the two kinds of expert. Moreover, hymners had also to pronounce prose hymns, called \"theologies.\"9° The third-century professor of eloquence, Menander of Laodicea, wrote a short guide to their composition. They were to dwell \"on the naming of a god, or on valedictory, or on the god's nature or story or birth or form, or to invoke or deter, or a mixture\" -which sounds exactly like the advice offered by Alexander the Rhetor in the preceding century or like the epigraphic texts discusse4 some pages past-with the difference that they were not versified. Menander indicates elsewhere the freedom he would allow to speeches of praise-here, however, praising men, not gods: \"You should invent dreams and pretend to have heard certain voices and wish to proclaim them to your listeners, or of dreams, for example, that Hermes stood by your bed at night, commanding you to announce who was the best of the magistrates; and, 'Obedient to his commands, I will repeat"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 Perceptible from the very center of theaters what I heard him say ... .'\" 91 That last boast recalls another passage with the same setting, \"when the populace as-sembles in the theaters and someone enters wrapped in some special robe, carrying a cithara and singing to it (as he says in the hymn of the Great Initiation, without knowing what he says), 'Whether offspring of Kronos, whether blessed of Zeus, whether of great Rhea, hail to thee, mournful message of Rhea, 0 Attis. The Syrians call you Adonis, thrice-desired, all Egypt calls you Osiris, Greek wisdom calls you the heavenly crescent of the month, Samothracians, venerable Adamna; the people of Haemon, Cory-bas; and the Phrygians, sometimes Papa, sometimes the corpse, the god, the sterile unharvested, or the goat-herd, the verdant ear of grain gathered in, or the piper whom fruitful Amygdalos brought forth.' \" And so he continues, quoting next from a hymn to Attis.92 2. ATTRACTING CROWDS \"In the theaters .. .'' Alexander and Menander, who made their living by speaking to a general audience and, in their handbook~, by writing for a still wider one, and who must then be supposed to have intended nothing at odds with prevailing views but everything conventional, acceptable, and safe, are the very best witnesses a historian could ask for-that is, if he seeks to define broad cultural phenomena. Of which, first and most obvious to be noticed is the size of audience implied by the need for a theater at all, a theater called into use to hear verse or prose hymns about the gods only because there were very large numbers of people to whom such things were really important. In the northwestern provinces, the evidence for crowds of worshipers gathering around some cult exposition or spectacle is archaeological, un-assisted by the literary; and the prime site is typically rural, not in some city center. Adjoining dozens of more or less isolated temples are cult theaters, sometimes right inside the same sanctuary wall. Functional links between the two kinds of building are clearly indicated by various facts but are actually clinched by those cases where the pair lie along a single axis; so seated spectators could see past the stage (which lacks or breaks the back-drop or scaenae frons) to the temple's front, beyond. Just what those spec-tators witnessed, no one knows-no doubt the acting out of scenes or musi-cal performances illustrative of the beliefs of the local cult. It was not one god but many that received this tribute, in central and northern France and the Moselle and upper Rhine valleys. It can have been offered only at festi-vals, not daily or weekly, to attract the crowds requiring such accommoda-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds 19 tions. They numbered many thousands where they can be counted, for example at Sanxay and Grand in southwestern and central France.1 In the provinces of North Africa, only one similar site is known, a Hadri· anic temple to Liber having a small stepped structure suitable for seating at one end of the sanctuary, but lacking a stage.2 It turns its back on the temple. Tertullian gives a characteristically high-colored treatment to theatrical presentations in Carthage with religious subjects. We will return to them. But they were offered in secular amphitheaters, connected to shrines only by the inaugural parades that reached them \"from temples and altars.\"' Moreover, they only followed Roman practices, brought in with everything else Roman in the course of conquest and settlement. In their land of origin, Italy itself, such practices are too familiar to need description.• The Syrian priest and worshipers of Hadad and Atargatis dedicated a theater on Delos in 108/7 B.c. It lay at one end of a terrace, the other end of which held the temple; and on holy days the seated idol was paraded out of ber house, along the terrace, to a marble throne that faced the theater, there to receive offerings at an altar in front of her. What else was shown the spectators is not known. Not quite a century later in the Hawran (Auranitis) at Seeia (Si'), the temple of Ba'al-shamin was equipped with steps that could be sat on along three sides of the main court, shaded by a portico behind them, and with the temple front as the fourth side. The whole can be identified as a theater by an inscription, and compared to closely similar arrangements at two other sites in the region, Sur of the first century B.c. or A.D. and Sahr of a slightly later date, with the difference that in the latter two the steps are actually inside and covered by the portico, and that the temple at Sahr is also flanked by a small proper theater capable of seating several hundred people.5 Moving north, a mile outside Gerasa lies the sacred pool for the Maioumas festival, connected to the city by a sacred boulevard and flanked by a Severan theater with fourteen rows of seats. From the upper ones there was a clear view through the stage (lacking a backdrop) to the pool.6 Next, to the obscure sanctuary of Artemis at Amy· zon in Caria, with a theater;7 and so on to Dura on the Euphrates. There, the theater attached to the shrine of Artemis Nanaia was a little smaller (fourteen meters in diameter), ensconced in a closed building, and therefore too dark for anything but dancing or singing; and there were four more tiny theaters in the town tied to shrines of other Syrian deities. 8 Theaters for the ceremonies of Syrian cults, spread over several centuries and a very wide area, display a good deal of variety, but they have in com· mon the need to accommodate only limited numbers. The most natural explanation for that is the use of the facilities for special doings in which a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 Perceptible minority of worshipers participated at any given time. That in turn might be explained by the cult's offering revelations to which all members were exposed only once in their lives, or rarely. Of this, however, nothing can be said for certain; and in any case it is not my purpose to discuss more than the open face and shared aspects of religious practices. Accordingly, there is no need to do more than mention some of the cult theaters for initiates in the Greek world proper. Of these, Eleusis is best known. Clement of Alexandria, for example, speaks of its rites as still ad-ministered in his own day.9 The telesterion at Samothraee, with wooden benches around three sides and a sign at the door, \"Noninitiates stay out,\" is familiar, too.10 More to my purpose because of its more significant dimensions is the theater facing the temple front of the god Cabiros, a few miles from Thebes in Boeotia. It had room for one to two thousand specta-tors.11 And better still, the great Asclepius shrines at Pergamon and Epi-daurus. The former lay some distance out of the city, at the end of a sacred boulevard, and included a 3,500-seat theater adjacent to one corner of the quite immense walled and porticoed sacred enclosure; the latter, Epidaurus, though its shrine lay far off the beaten track, nevertheless required a theater to hold 12,000-15,000. That was for crowds attending the festival every four years.12 Pausanias in the second century marveled at its proportions. We cannot assume, however, that the wide and intense interest and en-joyment in the \"spectacular\" side of worship (using the word in its root sense), here at these locations so spectacularly accommodated, did not also exist where similar facilities do not happen to be demonstrable. People rather made do with available substitutes. They used wooden bleachers which have left no trace for the archaeologist,13 or, as at Altbachtal near Trier, they placed odd-sized, half-cut stones for seats in a rough half-circle around the slopes of a natural cup of land-facilities very easily overlooked in excavation. Or again, they borrowed the city's central square for a few days14-preferably, the city's secular theater or amphitheater. In Italian or Romanized cities, performances with religious themes so offensive to the Apologists inevitably took place where, on the next day, there might be executions or gladiatorial combats. We will touch on those scandalous dramas very shortly. But in the eastern provinces, in what category, secular or holy, should we place the theater in which ended the procession of Arte-mis's worshipers, in Ephesus, and in which the icon was ceremonially en-throned to oversee, perhaps in its wooden way to enjoy, the musical, dra-matic, and athletic events? In what category should we place the gladiatorial troupe hired for exhibits locally by high priests, or (no doubt purely secular) dancers and musicians paid to perform in the city theater all year long, as a"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds 21 gift from the ministrants of Hecate? 15 Above all, there are the shows that took place in the precincts of temples where, as is already clear in shrines of Syria, steps could serve as seats. As much may be assumed of the hundred yards of stairway with its eleven steps that stretch around the enclosure at Lagina in Caria; as much is implied by the like features at Didyma near Miletus and Eleusis near Athens.16 Direct testimony to the requirements of gatherings largely or wholly religious in purpose is enough, surely, to give some sense of the weight or significance of that purpose in the daily life of the Empire. But indirect testimony, too, carries weight: for every piece of evidence must be measured in terms of the likelihood of its survival. By that measurement, crowds attending in hundreds or thousands must be taken for granted even in settings where their voices have been cut off by the total silence of our sources. Spectators in the numbers described could hardly have been assembled for a lecture on theosophy. Something else it was that drew them: a varied bill of entertainment, but still all holy. The Maioumas, notorious set of rites at Gerasa, brought women out of town to a sacred pool in the suburbs, there to bathe naked, that is, to be purified and magicked in some way never really described, before the stare of the townsfolk.17 But it happened only every third year. Annually at Patrai, on the other hand, occurred a sort of roundup of wild animals, a great battue, driving them into a corral dedi· cated to Artemis, and up a ramp, and so (apparently) right on to a bonfire. Pausanias describes the amazing scene-perhaps duplicated, however, at another city in Pontus.1s In areas and cities not enjoying an inheritance of customs so dramatic, there were nevertheless very rich entertainments pro· vided to visitors by the generosity of liturgists, hiring professionals. Com-panies of dancers made their living through sale of their services to many, many shrines. They specialized in the forms traditional to particular cults: the Silens of Dionysus at Pergamon, the kinaedoi or wagtails of Oriental cults (most often connected with Egypt), the ballatores of Cybele, the akro-batai or toe dancers of Artemis, the armed Couretes for the same goddess at Ephesus.19 What everyone most liked to watch, however, were miming dancers. Those in Egypt added their motions to the reading aloud of holy texts by the priest, producing \"danced hymns,\" as they have been well described.

To the right, on the stairs of a temple, worshipers gesticulate with the music. In the temple court-though C. Picard (1955) 244 would see a cult theater-dancers clack sticks like castanets and whirl and wiggle frenziedly. Some may be female, others male. The latter are nicknamed in Greek \"wagtails\" after the word for swallows, since the swallow is a bird \"qui agite particulierement la partie inferieure du corps\" (so Bernand 2 [1969) 121, discreetly). centuries-make clear that there was no sharp distinction between actors and dancers. The same word was used for both, and their means of portray-ing stories were mingled. In the amphitheaters, \"your deities dance, sup-plying themes and stories to the wicked.\" Performers can \"call up your tears with make-believe agonies through the empty movements of hand or head,\" and Venus leading a troupe of child dancers as Cupids uses her own glances so expressively that she can be said \"to leap with her eyes alone.\" 21 Venus was a popular subject, Hera also, Zeus or Jupiter, all in erotic scenes no doubt presented very suggestively. Tertullian (Ad nat. 15) reels off a list of common favorites on the stage: \"Anubis Adulterer, Mr. Moon, Diana Flogged, Jove's Last Testament, and as a comedy, Three Hungry Hercu-leses.\" In Italy, too, dancers and actors were more or less interchangeable.22 They were of course active in the capital, but in lots of towns up and down Latium and Campania as well, playing the same parts as their like in Alexandria or Carthage and just as closely tied to some of the major cults."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds 2J They too used the tilt of the head, eyes, eyebrows, hands, and very fingertips to communicate a great range of thoughts and feelings, much like Oriental dancers to this day.23 Presumably they found a responsive knowledge of sign language among their audience, for much of the repertoire was highly traditional, and symbolic gestures would soon settle into their own conven-tions. Tradition went by region. Each had its own. So one writer speaks of rites addressed \"to Egyptian deities generally by lament, to the Greek for the most part by choruses, but to the non-Greek by the clangor of cymbalists, drummers and pipe-accompanists\"; or to the same effect, another reports that \"the Bacchic dance is taken especially seriously in Ionia and Pontus, although it belongs to Satyric drama, and has so taken hold of people there that, in the appointed [i.e., festival] time, they put aside everything else and sit the day through, watching corybants, Satyrs and shepherds; and people of the best lineage and foremost in every city dance, not in the least embar-rassed but proud of it.\" 24 Lucian, the author of this latter passage, also cites a number of other local specialties. \"At Delos not even the sacrifices are offered without dancing .... Boy choruses assembled and, to the pipe and cithara, some moved about, singing, while the best performed a dance in accompaniment; and hymns written for such choirs are called dances-for-accompaniment.\" 25 It is likely that, wherever cult dancing is found in the Greek-speaking world, it has something of local color about it.26 That takes care of the great public ceremonies on holy days and the reli-gious use of the really large municipal theaters at places like Pergamon; but there are the smaller facilities at Samothrace and elsewhere still to be filled. They served \"Mysteries.\" The word conjures up quite mistaken ideas of secrets about the gods revealed in darkness to a tiny circle of oath-bound devotees. At all periods there were indeed such groups and rituals-elabo-rate ceremonies reserved for the specially devout (or wealthy), or more often viewed by neighbors with disapproval or alarm (see section 3, n. 29, below), A mysterion normally meant something more open and unexciting, essen-tially a lesson in a cult to be learned, perhaps by very large numbers at a time, as in the Eleusinian rites or in the mystery cult best known in the period of our study, that of Cybele. Its setting might be in cities of Asia Minor, where \"the populace assembles in the theaters and someone en-ters ... \"-but the description has been quoted already.27 We gather from the context as well as the explicit words that anyone at all could attend, quite unchallenged, exactly as one would gather also from the facts: first, that children and professionals-that is, outsiders-were employed in the choruses to sing the hymns of revelation; 28 second, that theaters for mys-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"24 Perceptible teries were designed to hold, not scores, but hundreds or thousands. Lucian, in his recollections of his old teacher Demonax (11), reports how th.tt free-thinker was pilloried in Athens as \"the only person of all that-had never been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries.\" No very select company, those votaries! And the same author, in his essay On Dance (15), tells us \"there are no ancient rites of initiation without dancing,\" which satisfac· torily distributes over a very wide area the conclusions forced on us from other directions: so-called mysteries were in general quite open, come-if· you-wish ceremonies, to which as large an audience as possible was attracted by interpretive dancing, singing and music of all sorts. \"Barbarian\" or \"non-Greek\" rites, notably of· Atargatis, Isis, and the Phrygian Cybele, made use of inspired, mad dancing that produced a great impression on observers and was also easily and often seen, since its prac· titioners wandered about in public in search of an audience. To the sound of rattles, tambours, and shrill pipes, with their heads tipped back or roll-ing wildly on their shoulders, accompanied by their own howls and yells, they whirled about and worked themselves into a state of frenzy. Then they held out the begging bowl. The scene meets us in poems, novels, and fres-coes-all too familiar to need discussion.29 The entire range of musical instruments known to the world of the Apologists was called into the service of the gods in one cult or another, so along with every conceivable style of dance and song, theatrical show, prose hymn, lecture or tractate philosophizing, popularizing, edifying, and so forth-in sum, the whole of culture, so it would seem. The same conclu-sion can be expressed negatively. From the arts of those centuries, remove everything that was not largely devoted to religion. The heart of culture then is gone. But another conclusion emerges: the heart belonged to the cultivated. Hardly a novel insight! -yet very strikingly demonstrable through the foregoing pages. Theaters were built and programs and artists chosen and paid for by the more educated well-to-do, who, themselves, also offered some of the performances. Of anything that could be called popular cul· ture, hardly a trace appears.31 Naturally, that fact reflects the state of the sources, not of reality. The materials from which ordinary people made their lives were wretchedly impermanent. Ovid gives a glimpse of a simple gathering on the Tiber bank for a feast in honor of Anna Perenna. Of those who attend, some pitch tents, others patch together huts of reeds or blankets. They spend the night there. When the sun rises they begin the holy day's dancing-and drinking. The glimpse is that and no more. Afterward, nothing is left but the trampled grass. What are attested much, much more"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds 25 often are \"advanced\" manifestations of the religious impulse through specialized skills and settings, that is, through theaters and telesteria, not tents; through trained choruses of aristocratic boys and girls under paid trainers; paid dancers, too, and instrumentalists, not villagers and cottagers doing their best. The 'structure of religious leadership corresponds in its human shape to that divine hierarchy of frequency-of-mention which we examined earlier. Within it, the many were quite subordinate to the few. They acquiesced in the elaborate tribute of the arts !:>ought by the few for Zeus, for Minerva, Artemis, and Mars. They acquiesced by streaming in to the theaters and festival celebrations; not to the extent of quite forgetting Anna Perenna and her like. There was room for many gods. Throughout most of the eastern provinces, cities advertised their princi-pal, most characteristic religious beliefs by sending out delegations of heralds or by issuing small change, that is, bronze currency from their own mints and of their own design. They wanted to attract wide attention, in-spired by a mixture of sins: pride and avarice. So Ma, better known as Bellona in the west, showed herself op the coins of her home in Pontus, Men on coins of cities in his home Pisidia, the river oracle XPHCMOC on coins of Limyra, Asclepius on those of Pergamon, the Mother of the Gods, all over, and festival presidents on coins of many cities, of Apamea, for example-by their title and prominence indicating what occasion they and all th~se mintings chiefly served. Visitors not only fed their hosts' self· esteem; they were good business.s2 Nor should it be thought that the phe-nomenon of the cult festival, advertised to and drawing from the popula-tion of a wide region, was not to be found where the imperial government forbade municipal mints. On the contrary, the evidence comes from every· where, even if not on coins, and so abundantly as almost to match, within the economy, what we have seen cults supplying in higher culture: the very heart. Their economic importance in itself has no claim to discussion here; but the role of festivals in the exchange of ideas as well as goods is very much our business. People assembling for commerce could not avoid ex-posure to the challenge of others' religious beliefs. Lyon, for example, had \"a festival that was populous with throngs as· sembled to it from all the provinces,\" in Marcus Aurelius's reign; under Augustus, in half-deserted Fregellae near Rome, the people of half a dozen surrounding towns \"gather in it still to conduct fairs and certain religious rites\"; and to these welcome but rare hints from literary sources can be added more from the archaeological, showing us facilities for trade, booths or shops, built into the porticoes of sanctuaries or attested indirectly by quantities of dropped coins in the soil, even by inscriptions recording this"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"26 Perceptible or that trader as having his business at this or that temple.33 To be sure, we do not know if these signs indicate annual gatherings or, more likely, gath-erings at closer intervals. They offer their testimony, in any case-the \"cafes and gardens,\" \"the sales-tax-free monthly holy days on the fifteenth and thirtieth\" of each month-in the east as well as the west. In Syria, the sanctuary wall at Damascus embraced a sacral area twice the size of a foot-ball field, constituting at the same time the principal bazaar of that great caravan city.34 In Greece, the traffic that once nourished Tithorea now, in Pausanias's time, flowed instead to the half-yearly festival-cum-market at the Isis shrine a few miles away. Olympia had the same magnetic force on commerce, earning its meetings the name mercatus 0 lympicus. ss That tells something! The fullest evidence of all, however, comes from the cities of Asia Minor. In this region, the system of free gifts of money and services provided by the well-to-do to their communities, and a healthy economy during most of our period, combined to produce relative luxury at the holy days of smaller centers and remarkable brilliance at the major ones. The liturgists involved had saved up, sometimes for years, to be able to lavisq quite dispropor-tionate sums on the duties of their term of office, magistracy or priesthood. The greater the concourse attracted from round about! Hosts found it a little hard to maintain their smile of welcome. 36 Their guests were, after all, a very mixed crowd, in part unrestrained and unrespectable, in part pitiably gullible, and most giving a good deal of consideration to pursuits entirely secular. Hence, need for the authorities to put extra amounts of money into circulation and give extra care to the policing of the marketplace. In time, the office of festival president could be seen absorbed into that of agora superintendent. Where that happened, it revealed much about the focus of their concern.37 How mixed the interests, how various the types of person drawn to a festival, can be measured in the scene sketched for us by a con-temporary: \"some people attending out of curiosity, some for shows and contests ... , and many bring goods of all sorts for sale, the market folk, that is, some of whom display their crafts and manufactures while others make a show of some special learning-many, of works of tragedy or poetry, many, of prose works.\" ss Developing out of terrain, seasons, plain routes of travel, and human needs of all sorts, some of the smaller religious fairs known in the second and third centuries filled those needs so naturally that, with changes only on the surface, they were still being held in the nineteenth. 59 Some of the grand ones drew worshipers \"from remote regions for religion's sake,\" as Artemis did to Perge or Ephesus, \"venerated not only in her own home-city"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds 27 ... but by Greeks and barbarians.\"40 Whatever their size or area of attrac-tion, they constituted one of the chief means of introducing someone to a larger world than that in which he was likely to pass his workaday life. Thereby they help to answer the chief question latent in the last several pages: How did the isolated and the uncommitted, people away in their villages or people who had no interest in a given belief, come naturally to a knowledge of it? In the absence of missionaries and mass media, it is not easy to picture the two kinds of individual learning of many gods. Such was certainly not the chief object of (for example) the high and mighty colonels and imperial bailiffs who paid a call on the hot baths of Scaptopara, so handy (as close as two miles) to a rustic cult center and its holy days. Reli-gious learning can have been of no concern at all to those sons of heroes who patronized a company of whores on circuit around Thermopylae as it went from one holy day to another. And the desire to find out about strange gods was certainly not what accounted for the peddler who set up his skin tent near the sanctuary walls or for his customers fresh come from the plow, in Tithorea. Nevertheless, their senses were assaulted by messages directing their attention to religion: shouts and singing in public places, generally in the open air, not in any church, and to an accompaniment as loud as an-cient instruments could sound; applause for highly ornate prose paeans before large audiences; enactment of scenes from the gods' stories performed in theaters and amphitheaters by expert actors, singers, and dancers, while the idols looked on from seats of honor; the god-possessed swirl of wor-shipers coming down the street to the noise of rattles and drums; and all of this without the onlooker's offering a pinch of incense or so much as glanc-ing at a temple. So obtrusive upon the attention of the least interested was the world of the divine. Holy places only by chance lay where cities grew. Many lay rather at some distance away: the Asclepieion in the suburbs of Pergamon, Didyma twenty-three miles from Miletus, Daphne outside Antioch, Eleusis twelve miles from Athens. There was thus much traveling out to see them. But some deities themselves had to make an annual visit to convenient water. Among them, Isis. Early in the spring her image was taken from its house down to the shore, to set the ships asail, and again in the autumn, to find Osiris. Other images went to water for a bath; 41 many were ritually carried to a secular or cult theater, 42 many simply paid a brief call on their friends and relations. They were borne on carts drawn by a pair of horses, by a deer, by elephants (at least in representation); 45 they were carried on a litter with human bearers (the means of transportation most often shown in reliefs, coins, and frescoes).

Animals driven to be sacrificed had signs on them proclaiming their donors' names. 46 In Greece and western Asia Minor, specifically at-tested, regularly recurrent religious parades number in the hundreds, in some towns taking place several times a year on behalf of different cults; but beyond this area, too, and especially as a feature of Oriental cults, they are known, though not so familiarly.47 The reason for drawing out the evi-dence on them is the same that required the describing of other public cult activities: the need to make as vivid as possible the degree to which testi-monies and teaching about religious beliefs demanded notice, even from the most uncaring observer. But perhaps the point has been labored, and to the neglect of a more obvious truth: most inhabitants of the world here under inspection were by no means uncaring observers. Had they been that, there would be no ex-plaining their efforts to attend great or little festivals a day's journey from their homes, or a week's journey-in short, there would be no explaining pilgrims. These were a phenomenon distinct by themselves. Like many a visitor of festival times, they spent money when they arrived at their desti-nation; but only to make offerings. That is what Lucian means by saying of the Holy City, \"to the great goddess' temple in Hierapolis comes wealth from Phoenicia, Babylonia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia.\"48 Wealth, that is, coins, discovered in the excavation of a shrine to the Mother of the Gods, south of Pergamon, similarly shows the origin of visitors to lie in a number of cities fifty, a hundred, or more miles away. 49 They had to be lodged in a special hostel such as has been found in one form or another, and with a few or with dozens of rooms, in many shrines, 5° though most frequently where visitors' business would keep them for a matter of days, even weeks. That could be necessary for the attending of a long festival (Olympia or Pana-mara), religious study (Jerusalem), consultation of an oracle (Trophonius), treatment by Aesculapius (Pergamon), or a water cure by deities of hot or cold springs in many Celtic shrines beyond the reach of this study. Divine doctors received many calls. Asclepius alone maintained hundreds of offices open for patients throughout the Greek-speaking provinces,s1 of which those at Epidaurus and Pergamon are only the most famous. The size of their adjacent theaters suggests the numbers drawn to them.

Attracting Crowds 29 way from Cadiz; others, to Samothrace from far north; and so forth. Pil-grims were ordinarily men, rarely women.52 In Egypt, a land to all of which the Nile served handily as main street, it was customary as nowhere else to pay one's respects to many gods, traveling if need be many miles. Witness to the custom are some two hundred texts on the walls of the Isis sanctuary and the buildings it contained, on the island of Philae. They were inscribed in the period of the Empire, most of them on the pattern, \"I, Apollonius son of Theon, came to the Lady Isis [to offer] the prayer for ... \" (relatives-plus date). The prayer may, however, be versified, like this: \"When we arrived at the island of Isis, splendid and holy, at Egypt's edge, before Ethiopia, we saw in the river Nile swift boats that bore noteworthy shrines [miniatures, as offerings] from Ethiopia to our land rich in crops and worth the beholding, which all mortal men on earth venerate.\" u When, particularly in the second century but right up to the end of the third, too, we find visitors to the remotest shrines of Egypt coming from Greece and Italy, it is more easily understood why Greek and Latin literature in the same period should be able to show so many readers and writers well informed about Egyptian religion. Of course, the same instruction could be gained secondhand. Every pilgrim who visited some exotic temple then came home. His neighbors would hear all about it the next evening, and for perhaps more evenings· thereafter than they would have predicted, until they were fully acquainted with whatever he could tell them. Pilgrims not only learned but taught, too. To repeat: they were a distinct phenomenon. Their journeys were the physical expression of· a faith greater than prevailed generally. But they were not unique in their interest. At sanctuaries they were joined by, and hard to distinguish from, another stream made up of plain tourists. And the two met a third category: local experts. Lucian at the Holy City mentions a hereditary corps of hosts to pilgrims; Aristides at Pergamon like Pausanias in Lydia and at countless sites of Greece encounters and quotes from guides, exegetes; Athenagoras, Lucian, and Plutarch and his friends quote the priests both in Egypt and nearer home. 54 And there were people casually on hand at temples, to be described just as learned or wise men; but of a special religiosity accounting both for their presence and their lore.55 They would be most drawn to festivals, \"a time at which,\" says Strabo, \"it is best for the participants to see and hear about these matters,\" namely, details of the local cult. Bookish Plutarch sat down with strangers in the precinct at Delphi, near the temple, to discuss with them the significance of the letter E over the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"JO Perceptible entrance. They were soon joined by a chief priest and other people from the shrine (not further explained, but ministrants of some sort). In the course of their conversation they refer to \"the tourist-guide view.\" The scene is thoroughly believable-confirmed by Pausanias's report of a very similar argument begun by chance at the Asclepieion in Achaea.s6 It could, per-haps, just as well have taken place in a secular setting, in which other conversations about religion arose: a beach at Ostia made famous by Minu-cius Felix. But that was the scene of a debate no less profound between one of Plutarch's friends and another philosopher.s7 Religion was talked about in a public portico, where two strangers met, one of them in the character-istic cloak of a philosopher. They entered on a debate before a cluster of bystanders. And in the same sort of building but another time and temple, Lucian imagines two philosophers of contrary schools colliding before \"a multitude of men, some inside the portico itself, many out in the courtyard, some shouting and straining forward on their seats\" -concerning the question, Do the gods exist? 58 The stridency of interest is what counts for our purposes-an interest which is far more easily documented among Christians in the history of their internal debates but which animated non-Christians as well. There even survive a few hints of the two engaging in a dialogue with each other.59 Contemporary with some of these moments, a rhetor of the type we have seen elsewhere on display in cult theaters offers us a lecture exactly on the subject of chief concern to us: what were the means by which ideas of the divine came to be shaped. He lists ideas inborn, those derived from the poets, and those derived from decreed cult regulations. So far, familiar sources. He adds a fourth, works of art. He proceeds to an extended discus-sion of them. They belong of right to his subject. We have seen Plutarch using them as a means of approaching and understanding the divine.60 Pausanias in his tours of Greece, like Pliny earlier around Italy or Lucian in Gaul and the Danube provinces, comments on the paintings he saw in sanctuaries. 51 He expects to learn what beliefs are held at a given shrine by studying them closely and hearing them interpreted by resident experts. They are evidently to be looked for in any well-maintained sanctuary in Greece or, indeed, in Asia Minor, in the Danube provinces, or in Africa. That much appears in inscriptions boasting of their installation.62 Figured frescoes still survive on temple walls from an area even wider.63 Bas-reliefs were ordinarily painted, as too were architectural details on Greek or Hellenizing temples (the practice is familiar) and on theaters also . (as may be learned from the example at Stobi); most wall surfaces not marble would be stuccoed and painted; and, for the famous old cult statues"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"2. Attracting Crowds of earlier Greece or Rome, there was a match in the Sara pis of Pergamon, thirty-five feet high even seated, or in the many images everywhere that were gilded. That rhetor of the previous paragraph, Dio Chrysostom, whose ideas on art we can examine quite fully, delivers his address while standing in the neighborhood of the great Zeus image by Pheidias at Olympia, a fact no doubt explaining why he should attach special importance to sculpture compared with painting; but he is surely right in attributing to any true masterpiece a kind of tyranny over every worshiper's subsequent percep-tions (Or. 12.53 )-\"by this glorious vision, conquering and uniting Greece first and then others-revealing something so wonderful, so splendid, that thereafter no one who saw it could form a different view.\" Depending on the good will and wealth available to freshen the paint, sacred enclosures and their buildings, frescoes, friezes, and statues must be imagined, first, as drawing the eye with a very rich display of color through-out, and second, as rewarding it with scenes and symbols full of meaning for even a stranger. To this striking polychromy, inscriptions contributed their share. They too were ordinarily painted, the letters alone or the back-ground as well, with the obvious intent of providing better advertisement. 64 The importance attached to some of them is manifest in the efforts of the authorities to maintain them in good repair, to show them off properly or otherwise reaffirm them. 65 They constituted the best means by which priests and pious alike could impress their beliefs on the public entering the shrines. While gods and goddesses resided in every temple and could be seen in secular surroundings, too, at street comers or ensconced in niches in the town hall, nevertheless it was the stone population inside sanctuary cir-cuits but outside temples themselves that contributed most to the total of 30,000 statues of deities estimated to exist in the Empire as a whole; and this population received additions all the time, to the point of needing to be thinned out. 66 Prolific piety commissioned many of these conceptions, eveq if many others were the offspring merely of convention: \"to great Artemi~ Thermia, this bronze image in obedience to her command and revelation\"; \"So-and-So the barber, seeing it in a dream, erected an Asclepius to the Nymphs, for his health, and gave thanks\"; \"the Ionian Polemo, sophist, following his dream, set up a bronze statue of Demosthenes the rhetor in the Asclepieion of Pergamon in Mysia, inscribing on it this epigram .... \" 67 Only a selection from epigraphic memorials in the provinces east and west suggests that a variety of cult reliefs, fonts for lustration, and whole chapels as well as dedicatory statues were offered by worshipers obedient to the gods' own expressed will.

No one dared disobey divine commands-or almost no one. Isis of Tithorea wished only certain individuals at her festivals, and let them know by appearing to them in dreams. Worth heeding, in the view of local folk. \"They say that someone uninvited entered the shrine and died soon after. ... I heard the same thing from a Phoenician man,\" adds Pausanias, speaking of Isis in Coptos.6s An often-discussed type of inscription from Lydia and Phrygia, belonging to our period, relates how some person went against the will of this or that local deity, Apollo Lairbenos, Artemis Anaitis, the Great Mother Artemis, or Mis (Men, and in that name settled with his worshipers in Attica, too); whereupon the sinner is struck by some punishment to self or kin or property, learns of the trouble \"ina dream\" or \"through command,\" confesses openly, and concludes his requital at the deity's orders by posting an account of the whole affair on a stone tablet, to advertise the deity's \"powers\" and \"manifestations\" (epiphaneiai).69 Too many gods are involved for the practices reflected in these texts to belong to any particular few; rather, to a region; and a fairly wide one. Moreover, punishment for offenses against right and wrong, for example, theft, is as sharp as for any against the rules of worship. The two kinds of punishment together fall on someone who swears falsely before the altar. Such perjury receives its due at Palmyra, where Iarhibol reigned; and con-tempt for a deity brought on its penalties in Mysia near Pergamon and at Epidaurus, too, as we can see in the very inscriptions that Pausanias him-self saw and reported in about A.D. 170.7° They recorded from the fourth century B.c. well over a hundred remarkable medical case histories, for example, one in which a man came to the Asclepius shrine suffering from crippled hands, and, \"seeing the tablets in the sanctuary\" (i.e., of exactly the same kind as these texts themselves), \"he disbelieved the cures and somewhat sneered at the inscriptions. But going to sleep, he saw a vision ... ,\" etc. Or another man who, \"transporting fish to Arcadia, in prayer saying he would give a tenth to Asclepius from the sale of the fish, did not fulfill the prayer. The fish suddenly bit him ... ,\"etc. Or a third visitor to Epidaurus, \"suffering from an unhealed wound. While he was in Troezen about to be cauterized by the physicians, in his s]eep the god stood by him and told him not to be cauterized, but to sleep in the temple at Epidaurus ... ,\" etc.71 But whether the painted letters on marble stelae told stories five or five hundred years old, anyone like Pausanias whose curiosity led him to enter"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"2.

Like the hymns written up on walls with indications of the tunes best suited to accompany them, like the examples of aretalogy already mentioned, in which wondrous deeds were strung together in rapid series, or like the rules of ritual declared to be given by a god through dream, oracle, or vision, the whole of a cult was displayed to the observer in the most accessible fashion possible. Exegetes were at hand to address a stranger and invite his questions. Benches invited him to sit down and talk or think about what he saw before him:72 the texts, the friezes on the temple, the dedicatory statues with their inscribed bases, and the paintings most often in stoas, where the rain and sun could not spoil them. In Asclepius's casebook at Epidaurus, an alert editor can find the style of simple folk, 73 the pinning down of highly improbable tales to named per-sons and places, and other points of presentation likely to win credence. Some of these same qualities Pliny remarked in an out-of-the-way sanctuary deep in the Apennines. There \"stands Clitumnus himself, girt in decorated official costume. That he is a present power and prophetic, the oracular responses show .... You will read many things written up by many persons on every column and wall, praising that holy spring and the god. You will admire most-but laugh at some.\" The passage serves as reminder that the same devices of explanation and advertisement found on an elaborate scale in a great center like Epidaurus were to be found also in the most remote nooks of Italy.74 They were not the monopoly of Asclepius at Cos, Epi-daurus, or Pergamon-not a peculiarly Greek possession, that is;75 for inscribed testimonials to divine cures distinguished shrines also in Italy, North Africa, and Egypt.76 The modern student is unhappily aware of the capricious capacity of evi-dence to survive at one point and perish at another. So much depends on the nature of the materials to which records were originally committed: in the Greek-speaking world, a great variety of topics on stone, and quite fully expressed, but in the Latin west and north, a habit of inscription much, much more shallowly rooted and perfunctory in its style. An ephemeral literature on papyrus once existed to attest to miracles of healing wrought by Asclepius in his Egyptian manifestation and, no doubt more often, by Isis and Sarapis;77 there were prayers on papyrus once pinned to statues; and almost equally perishable wooden panels once bore painted texts. 78 None of these records still exists today, therefore none of the beliefs and events to which they bore witness can be substantiated.

They could be seen in shrines throughout the area of our study, as reliefs on stelae or on a wall. 79 Their ubiquity is strik-ing. In the major Asclepieia they seem to have been offered as things or places (carved, and with a hole in them?) for a visitor to address, like tele-phones linked to Olympus. And they expressed silently the character often attributed to the gods in dedications, the character of listening.80 Without that, prayers would have no reason. In healing shrines, ears carved in relief occasionally indicate a part of a suppliant made well, i.e., hearing restored. Two· or three-dimensional representations of feet occur, 81 which more often tell of the presence on the spot of whatever person comm~ssioned the carving; but they, too, may signify a healing of that part of the body.

There remain only tantalizing lists from earlier centuries, cataloguing objects in some sanctuary: \"on the third row, a leg in relief, uninscribed, dedicated in the priesthood of Lysias,\" something else \"hung from the ceiling,\" or \"on the left as you enter,\" \"on the wall,\" \"two tripods, two small masks, two breasts, two phalluses, a snake, a hand.\" as It must be supposed that the contents of temples had not changed by the point in time studied in these pages; for stray objects of the sort one would expect to find in the glass cabinets of an old-fashioned medical school turn up, most improperly, in the excavation of second-and third-century ruins. 3. DISPLAYS AND ACCOMMODATIONS AT TEMPLES It was customary for men to leave, nailed to the side of some building in a holy place, a lock of their hair cut off to mark the end of their adolescence. Accumulation of gifts could produce a peculiarly furry wall. I There were elephant tusks nailed up at two temples in Africa, an elephant skull at a third, in Capua (with a clever poem inscribed below it). 2 There was a pair of sculpted camels on view in a shrine a few miles from that skull, a pair of sculpted lions elsewhere, and live lions, bears, and bulls wandering loose but tame in the enclosure of Atargatis at Baalbek;' tame sacred snakes very"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"J.

They were one of the things that caused religion to be talked about. As a wonder or a curiosity, they drew people to strange places of worship. The whole city of Hierapolis served as sanctuary for doves held sacred to Atargatis. The effect can be judged from the scene at Ascalon, in the same region. When Philo arrived there in his travels, he \"observed an enormous population of doves in the city-squares and in every house. When I asked the explanation, I was told it was forbidden to catch them ... , and the creatures, having no cause for fear, had become so domesticated that they not only regularly share one's roof but one's table, too.\" Similar conse-quences must be imagined at Aphrodisias, where the governor intervened to protect Aphrodite's holy doves; in Phrygia and Lydia, the gods them-selves punished poachers; Achilles, worshiped in South Russia, guarded or was served by \"hordes of birds\" on a holy island; and the Romans in our period, it must not be forgotten, still put out to bid each year the feeding of the geese on the Capitoline hill. 6 To complete the picture of religious centers constituting also cultural centers, with zoological parks, aviaries, museums, concerts, art galleries, and public lectures, or the equivalent of all these things provided nowhere else in most cities, we must add botanical gardens: one consecrated to the goddess of the woodlands, seat (says Pliny the Elder) of \"a famous tree.\" And he goes on to tell of the Italian bamboo, \"which we commonly see in temples.\" 7 At Ephesus, the shrine of Artemis had woods around that con-tained rare trees, and perhaps still the deer parks of earlier times, nea,r the copse in which ran the sacred spring.s Cybele shrines in every province owned woods from which annually a pine was cut on the day \"the tree enters\": arbor entrat (March 22).9 It was in a copse that the Arval Brethren, priests to the Dea Dia in Rome, held their frequent ritual meetings. All over Italy it was immemorial to feel divine presences in such a place. No different the Greeks, or other peoples of the east.10 Indeed, whether from a feeling of awe before the darkness of thick-clustered trees or to enjoy the refreshment of their shade, the inhabitants throughout the world here studied attached a special value to groves, set them apart and regulated their use.

Safety for us lies in our having a clear and limited purpose: it is to appreciate the ways by which religion was estab-lished close to the center of daily life and therefore forced itself on people's attention. That is easily imagined happening in, for example, the sanc-tuary of Aphrodite at Cnidus. The space before and around the temple was not paved but agreeably planted with orchards. \"Under the most deeply shadowy trees were cheerful picnic places for those who wanted to provide a banquet there; and some of the more well-bred used these, sparingly, but the whole city crowd held festival there, in truly Aphrodisiac fashion.\" 11 In this description we encounter a distinctive and ubiquitous feature of cult centers, a place where a number of people could sit down together to eat and drink. It is best understood through our first asking what is known of ordinary social life and the equivalent of parties in the ancient world. To this inquiry, answer is very hard to give. In larger houses, a dining room could be expected to accommodate the usual nine guests. Only a really grand mansion had couches for more. How then could lavish entertain-ment take place? And for the great majority of people, whose quarters had no dining room at all, where could they play host to their friends? The solu-tion lay in sacred tables, where religious and social life were joined in a common occasion. The priests of Atargatis have already been seen at a fishy meal by them-selves, from which worshipers were excluded. Similarly the Arval Brethren: as might be guessed, being of the nobility and sometimes including the emperor, they dined well.12 These companies, however, and their like in whatever region for whatever god are too private to serve common socia-bility. Dedicatory banquets are too rare-by definition, once only.13 More to the purpose are those regular meetings indicated by the existence in sanctuaries of buildings called kitchens. Let us look first at Italy. There they are supplied, for example, by and to worshipers of Venus. Would guests attend wearing the popular earrings of dangling little Cupids? 14 The gods met one's glance everywhere unexpectedly. In Aquileia, gateway to the Danube lands, there are a number of sanctuaries equipped with kitchens for an equal number of different gods. On the river's bank at Carnuntum was built, and later repaired by an ex-legionary in the early third century, a shrine to the spirits of the woods and crossroads with a monumental en-trance, stoa, and' banquet area. Throughout the whole region there pre-vailed a cult of the so-called Rider Gods in which banquets were evidently common, because representations of them in painted stone reliefs are also common, at least in the third century .15"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"J. Displays and Accommodations at Temples J7 St. Paul provides the most familiar evidence for our subject in Greece. He speaks to the Christian community in Corinth about its members, or about people who are at least not devotees of some given pagan deity, joining the real devotees in that deity's temple grounds to share in the eating of sacrificial meat. His rather offhand reference to the scene as something quite everyday fits with the frequent epigraphic mention of dining rooms opening off the stoas that ran around sacral areas.16 As we would expect, those Greek buildings and the custom they accommodated found a second home in Asia Minor.17 Also predictably, the best-known example was one built for worshipers at the foremost cult center of all, for Artemis of Ephesus. The benefactor who paid for it was, significantly, also noted for his charities to the poor in the city. That beggars and the homeless found refuge in temples will become clear shortly. From the many terms used for the facilities that received the diner, it is obvious that they varied in size and shape, some being big enough to hold large crowds of guests, others, to hold only nine; and they might be found only one to a shrine or, more often, judging from excavated remains, in numbers ranging from three to more than twenty-five. In Syria, even a little rural shrine might have five separate rooms for eating; even a remote center might boast a banquet hall with a portico around it.18 Two well-excavated sites have supplied evidence on detail. At Dura on the Euphrates, Syrians in small groups equipped their places of worship (the word \"temples\" perhaps conjures up the wrong picture), each group with its own dining room, eight or ten or twelve persons constituting a cell or cult society (thiasos, as the Greeks called it) and their quarters closely following a set model for size and shape-at the Adonis shrine, anyway, and with a single grand exception which, according to its founder, was to enjoy a peristyle and wine cellar. The building up of a congregation of worshipers cell by cell can be seen also at the second site, Palmyra. One whole temple there, though not very large, turned into a banquet hall seat-ing about forty-five. Again, in the long, long effort of constructing porti-coes, entrance colonnade, propylaeum, and so forth around the temple of Bel, right through from the earlier first to the early third century, the work-men coalesced into small religious fraternities serving the holy triad that they had ensconced in the temple already finished; and they built and feasted in separate chambers.19 Throughout the city, where four tribes made up the dominant part of the population and established and main-tained various cult centers, there were unknown scores of privately funded sacred dining rooms in which, on just what holy days and how frequently, no one knows, there gathered the guests of the members in response to little"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"JS Perceptible tickets of invitation, for elaborate cocktail parties-so they have been called -at which there were dishes of hot meat and vegetables, perhaps (or after-ward only?) pipe and cithara players to add entertainment; and next, the guests having departed, the hosts settled down by themselves to serious eating and still more serious drinking, served by butchers, bakers, chefs, sommeliers, cupbearers, dancers, and musicians. Good manners obliged the lolling votaries to toast all their companions but at the same time to observe the sacred regulations against \"whoever vomits up his wine.\" People from this corner of the world, wherever they went, took with them their loyalty to their religious customs. So when a temple was erected in Dacia \"to the ancestral deities Malagbel and Bebelahamon and Benefal and Manaval,\" the donor provided it with a kitchen; the same in Rome and elsewhere.2o And worshipers of the one god in particular, the divine pro-prietor of the town Doliche, hence called Jupiter Dolichenus, added (once at least \"at the command of the god\") a dining chamber to his temple.21 Our circuit of survey comes last to Egypt. From this land spread the cult of Isis and Sarapis, along with its cult meals, even to Germany. Tertullian reminds his western audience of sumptuous feasts in Sa~apis' honor.22 At home, however, Isiacism is far better documented through papyri. Eleven of these resemble the hundreds of surviving Palmyrene invitations. In almost unvarying words, as if by strict courtesy or convention, the writers ask the recipients to meet them \"at the couch [or dining room] of the Lord Sara pis.\" Not always in his temple: \"Dionysius asks you to dine on the 21st at the couch of Helios, Great Sara pis, at the ninth hour, in the house of his father''; or in the temple of some other deity. The best suggestion to explain this is that, on any of the more obvious holy days of the year, the numbers of people wanting to celebrate with their friends exceeded the capacity of a single shrine, and some parties had therefore to find space elsewhere.25 They could the more easily do so because there would be many gods in town, and each or most evidently had commodious facilities for private banquets, either built permanently in stone or less elaborately in the form of arbors over stone couches. Users would lie on leaves or straw, hence the name \"mattress\" given to a banqueting place as a whole; and they would be shielded from the sun, hence the word \"tent\" used for the same purpose. Aelius Aristides, the rhetor, reminds his listeners that \"in sacrificing to this god [Sarapis] alone, men keenly share a vivid feeling of oneness, while summoning him to their hearth and setting him at their head as guest and diner .... [He is] the fulfilling participant in all cult associations, who ranks as leader of toasts (symposiarch) among them whenever they as-semble\" (Or. 8.54, l, p. 93f. Dindorf.).

The phenomenon was widespread. \"Devotees of Hercules,\" \"the devotees of Jupiter Axoranus,\" \"the association of Aesculapius and Hygia\" (all these in the west) assembled at periodic din-ners in temples-but then, of course, entirely secular fraternities used, perhaps rented, parts of a convenient temple for their meetings or even inscribed their rules on its walls; and the same customs could be found in the Greek provinces.24 Observing the latter from a distance, Tertullian re-marks that \"for the Apaturiae, the Dionysiac or the Attic mysteries, a draft of cooks is proclaimed.\"25 From the east to the west, too, there spread the worshipers of Mithras, bringing with them, like worshipers of Jupiter Dolichenus or of Isis and Sarapis, their own religious practices, which included common meals. Wherever they built their cavelike chapels, ar-chaeology uncovers gnawed bones of all sorts of edible animals.26 And for votaries of every sect or none at all, there were graveside meals in memory of the deceased. Those too are common.27 What emotions animated these scenes? The question, because of its in-trinsic interest as well as its bearing on the Christian Eucharist, has been often examined. It barely touches our subject proper-fortunately, since material for an answer hardly exists. Two points may nevertheless be made without need of any long discussion. First, the idea that a god might join worshipers who were eating together was widely diffused, most overtly in celebrations called lectisternia, when the icon was brought out of its house and was laid on a couch beside the celebrants; but also in other settings, larger and smaller; and obviously the emotions prevalent in some one setting could not be expected in all. The range would run from moments of great intensity (of hope, love, abase-ment, peace, and more) to moments, hours, or days of a festival in which religious meaning was all but forgotten. It has been the tendency of recent studies, in my view very persuasively, to deny much scope to the former, the more intense feelings.2s · Second, many signs prove the grossest indulgence of the appetites at banquets of the sort being considered. At least it indicates their reputation, that a novel could describe an initiation at which the banqueters eat, vomit up, and eat again human flesh, while, in drinking, only the presiding priests exercise any moderation. A wild, revolting fantasy, no doubt; but the vomiting of wine we have seen at Syrian meals.29 When Christian graveside meals enter the literary record a century later, scandalous drunkenness at them earns rebuke,so and it is a fair guess that their patterns of conduct had"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"40 Perceptible been taken from the pagan. When we turn to citywide parties, evidence for heavy drinking grows. We will consider them shortly. Does all this add up to something less than the spirit of worship, to shallowness of feeling, a secular devaluation of once-fervid beliefs? Or can that only be said if some extraneous standard of behavior, defining what is and is not \"truly\" reli-gious, were imported into the world of the Apologists? That was the latters' intent. It need not be ours, at our remove. Citywide cult celebrations are described, not lovingly, from a Christian viewpoint. They are said to be staged in the name of false worships, \"to which most men abandon themselves at festival time and holy days; and they arrange for drinking and parties, and give themselves up wholly to pipes and flutes and different kinds of music and in every respect abandon themselves to drunkenness and indulgence.\" 51 Against this interpretation of how people usually acted, an apologist, Plutarch (Moralia 1102A), might offer another: \"It's not the abundance of wine or the roasting of meat that makes the joy of festivals, but the good hope and the belief that the god is present in his kindness and graciously accepts what is offered.\" The pic-turing of the scene thus aroused in contemporaries a range of emotions; but the visible events were clear enough. A good meal was had by all, or many meals: for thirteen days, free meat with hymns and parades to, from, and in Apollo's shrine at Didyma; or feasting, dancing, and singing for the twelve days of Aglibol and Malakbel in Palmyra.52 We will turn later to more detail about such long-drawn-out affairs, as it can be recovered from the inscriptions of Caria; but here it is enough to offer no more than the two quoted descriptions from the Greek-speaking world. Their like are found very rarely in the west.55 In opening a glimpse upon these festivities, my aim is to place religion at the heart of social life as surely as it must be placed at the heart of cultural activities of every sort. For most people, to have a good time with their friends involved some contact with a god who served as guest of honor, as master of ceremonies, or as host in the porticoes or flowering, shaded grounds of his own dwelling. For most people, meat was a thing never eaten and wine to surfeit never drunk save as some religious setting per-mitted. There existed-it is no great exaggeration to say it of all but the fairly rich-no formal social life in the world of the Apologists that was entirely secular. Small wonder, then, that Jews and Christians, holding themselves aloof from anything the gods touched, suffered under the repu-tation of misanthropy! In rejoinder, they pointed with elaborate repugnance to \"the pollution around the idols, the disgusting smell and smoke of sacrifices, the defiling"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"J. Displays and Accommodations at Temples 41 gore about the altars and the taint of blood from the offerings.\" 34 Did they overstate the case? It was a pagan who described \"the priest himself [who] stands there all bloody and like an ogre carves and pulls out entrails and extracts the heart and pours the blood about the altar.\" 35 It is clear that the great bulk of meat (not fish or fowl) eaten in the ancient world had been butchered in temple precincts, most of which, ill-supplied with water, could not be swashed down easily, accumulated ugly piles of offal in cor-ners, and supported not only flies in clouds but stray mongrels as well. There would have to be wood stacked handy to the altars, and provision to store the hides stripped off the carcasses, since at least in some temples they were reserved for the priest. He was entitled, after all, to make his living from the premises.!& It appears common for him to have received a portion of each victim which went to \"the god's table\" and which he could then do with as he wanted: give for a feast or sell to retailers. That latter choice would explain Pliny's remark that, as Christians in Bithynia were perse-cuted, \"the temples begin to be crowded and the meat of victims to be for sale everywhere\"; but a number of cult regulations specify that the hide, the head, or a set fraction of the whole animal belongs to the god (hostile ob-servers making fun of the mean portion he receives), and such parts are to be sold.37 As to what worshipers could keep, they consumed it on the spot. Rules might even forbid their taking anything away, since symbolically all had been consecrated. Here served those kitchens, cooks, couches, arbors, and so forth that have been discussed. \"Sacrifices were devised by men, I do think, as a pretext for meat meals.\" 38 Though most of this detail about the apportioning of sacrifices comes from services in Egypt, Asia, and Greece, enough touches other regions to suggest that practices were broadly similar everywhere within the lands here being examined. The western provinces, however, yield a different kind of evidence of their own in the form of the remains of feasts, bones, skulls, and broken cups. The use of horses as sacrificial victims in Celtic areas seems securely attested but not explained. 39 In the region to the south and inland from Carthage, Punic custom directed worshipers to tophets with altars but no temples (perhaps a small chapel or two}, where sacrifice was made an~ the remains usually consumed in a feast by the party that brought the animal. Unused parts were buried under memorial stelae, often decorated with painted reliefs that help to explain the whole routine. In one such sanctuary dedicated to Tanit, \"pele-mele with the charred wood was a prodigious quantity of half-calcined bones, among which could be easily distinguished the jaws of oxen and sheep and a large quan-tity of leg-bones,\" plus thousands of lamps, hundreds of unguent bottles,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42 Perceptible and so forth, built up over time to a depth of six feet. 40 The absence of stone couc;:hes at shrines of that god who was by far the most widely revered in Carthage's old dominions, namely Saturn, and the Celtic practice of sacri-ficing horses, together warn against assuming uniformity too readily across all parts of the empire, where explicit evidence is lacking; while, on the other hand, in all parts were many gods, one or another displaying the pre-dominant cult practices-the offering of a sheep that worshipers then shared with family and friends, and the like customs-that we have been surveying. What was not native might thus still be familiar. At the Pergamon shrine of Asclepius, Aristides dreamt the god appeared to him with instructions to \"make an offering to Asclepius ... and distribute the holy portions to fellow-pilgrims.\" The latter must be added to the num-ber of possible or likely beneficiaries of sacrifice. They would include per-sons making long stays for a cure, of months or years. At the shrine favored by Aristides, vast though the whole complex was, its recovered plan does not show clearly just where they lodged; but other Asclepieia offered good accommodations. Some of the buildings have been described above. 41 Against modern stereotyping, Asclepius drew pilgrims also for initiation into the mysteries of his cult at Epidaurus, and Artemis to Ephesus, for healing. Many or most deities attracted seekers of many sorts, it should be remem-bered. 42 Inscriptions of Asia Minor speak specifically of a category of per-sons whose existence we could generally assume anyway, the more or less permanent hangers-on and dependents of the whole fat, smoking cluster of b,uildings and activities that Aristides dwelt among. Who these were, besides paupers and fugitives enjoying asylum, cannot be said. 45 A second category to be taken for granted St. Paul encountered at Ephesus in the person of Demetrius, \"a silversmith who made silver shrines of Diana and provided a great deal of employment for the craftsmen\"; and the pagan holy man Apollonius met the like in Athens, a wholesaler of statuettes of gods for sale to worshipers. 44 Excavation of shrines in Africa and the European prov-inces often turns up quantities of objects all nearly alike, which had some-how become conventional offerings to this or that deity and in whose manufacture there was obviously involved a sizable population of artisans. These one would expect to find in or near temple precincts. 4.

This year to the gods, the next to the city-such was the pattern of service rendered by the local aristocracy. Even within a given office, the two kinds of duties could not always be kept apart: \"the strategos assisted at the tradi· tiona! procession for the great goddess Isis ... ,\" \"for the visit of the most distinguished prefect ... , all [statues] in the temple crowned with wreaths ... , anointing of all the statues in the temple with oil ... , workmen accom· panying the image of the god to go and greet the prefect, wreaths for the image, a rhetor addressing the most distinguished prefect ... \"-so read the entries in the daybook of a magistrate and of a priest regarding quite similar public occasions and, for both of them, quite similar duties in third· century Egypt. It would be the same in any province.1 As the gods came out to meet officials, so officials visiting a city for some secular purpose paid courtesy calls on the gods; 2 and magistrates made free use of accommoda· tions in the porticoes of sacred enclosures, for their business, in just the same way that votaries as such met freely in civic buildings. 5 So closely were sacred and secular services confused in some settings. In others, not. From the gallery of faith in the Roman world no picture is better knowri, because none has been more often painted, than that of the fanatic who, half-naked, whirls about in a mad dance, flails at himself till the blood flows, gashes his arms and legs, even castrates himself in the transports of his faith. From northern Asia Minor originally came the cult of Ma, providing Romans with their first sight of such wild doings; then from Phrygia, the cult of Cybele and her eunuch priests who howled like dogs; then from Syria, the cult of Atargatis, another goddess served by eunuchs; and Isis, whose devotees shaved their heads and twitched about in dance to demonstrate their grief at the death of Osiris, later to rejoice as extravagantly at his recovery.• Their long hair was thought to be a sign of divine inspiration, the longer the better,s and they and other priests, not only those of Isis and Cybele, wore distinctive costumes. 6 Outside the cults of the four eastern female deities just named, ascetics are indeed attested-extremely rarely; and in Cilicia you could see inspired votaries walk bare· foot on hot coals, in trust or tribute to their local goddess, as still today in Macedonia the votaries of St. Constantine walk on coals \"at the command of their General,\" as they say. 7 But the sum of all this evidence for enthusi· asm in the literal sense is striking by its narrow limits, all thing~ (all gods) considered. The essential figure in sacred precincts is no doubt neither the aristocrat nor the fanatic but the priest, ministrant, or caretaker of whatever title."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 Perceptible Often a group of them acted together, answered questions and kept order. Enthusiasm was not the mark of such persons at all. Mentioned by travelers, they remain always nameless, humdrum, and helpful. In the sanctuaries of most gods it was rather the worshipers in whom eccentric behavior appears. So we can gather from scattered small hints, and from a single description that survives of people in a temple enclosure. It was written by Seneca: Go to the Capitol and you will be ashamed of the folly there disclosed, and of the duties which a deluded madness has assigned itself. One servant informs Jupiter of the names of his worshippers, another announces the hours; one is his bather, another his anointer, that is, gestures with empty hands to imitate the act of anointing. There are women who are hairdressers for Juno and Minerva; while standing far away from the temple as well as from the image, they move their fingers as if they were dressing the hair, and there are others who hold a mirror. There are men who summon the gods to give bond for them, and some who offer them lawyers' briefs and explain their case. An ex-pert leading actor in the mimes, now a decrepit old man, used to act a mime each day .... 8 Certain elements here we can identify: interpretive cult dancing and the calling of the god to witness and judge suits and oaths. Such customs we have seen before, though not at Rome. One element is obscure: the naming of worshipers. Others will need to be discussed. For with this passage we approach the center of our subject, the actual idol in its house. Our first-and by anticipation, it may be said, likewise our last-impression is curiously disappointing. Once past that circle of devotees that Seneca describes, we are left to the company of sextons. They have their everyday duties. They can sometimes be made out at daybreak opening the temple doors and singing a hymn to the deity-this for Sara pis, Asclepius, or Dionysus. 9 The altars had to be lit, too, each one to a prayer or acclamation.10 There followed one or two later junctures for hymns or sacrifices during the day, and then the doors were closed again.tl But it may be that very few places of worship were regulated according to so nice a timetable. Certainly some temples never opened their doors at all, rather were secluded from their worshipers behind an anterior screen or fence. Others were never closed. Apparently it did not matter. And some admitted worshipers to their interior for services that required permanent seating arrangements or for sacrifices of burnt offerings.t2 Lack of any pattern of practice, almost total lack of mention of gods seen in their own dwellings, suggests that idols played no very active part in the ongoing life of their cult.

It was what the faithful did in the precincts around them that counted for much more than what could be seen, or never seen, deep in the inner sanctum. To both precinct and temple within it, night brought the illumination of lamps dedicated as offerings or of statues holding torches.1' The effect had something magical about it, a sure sign-part of the evidence deserving discussion later on-that persons in charge of the premises consciously arranged things to arouse certain feelings in observers. The same inference may be drawn more specifically from the revised liturgy of the Arval Breth-ren, whereby, after the Brethren's cult dance, the statues of the goddesses in the temple were rubbed with perfumed oil, candles were lit all about, and the temple doors were thrown open.•4 The anointing of idols, if not merely mimed, made them gleam in lamplight. It was also a symbolic attention, like the dressing_of them in rich clothes. As if they had been great dolls, they were prinked and bejewelled and shown off in processions by specially titled servants: \"robe-bearers,\" \"adorners.\" 15 The same literal piety was seen earlier washing them and stretching them out on couches in the company of their devotees for a feast. Much of the long-elaborated, colorful sequence of activities that went on about the gods in their daily or yearly calendar has left its trace in sources for Greece and Asia Minor (actually, parts only of these broad areas), but not elsewhere. How is this unevenness of evidence to be handled? The most obvious recourse is simply to indicate what can be found where. But beyond that, it would be good to know if paucity of evidence corresponded to paucity of show in the cults of the province of Africa Proconsularis or Gallia Lugdunensis. It appears certain that Mithraism, lsiacism, and Cybele worship were well known (though not of course known to literally every-one, either in the west or in the east) throughout the Empire. With them they brought a full liturgy, in every sense of the word. It figures in a long list of pagan and Christian Latin authors. Authors, however, by no means tell the whole story. If it were not for the two words written next to figures on the wall of a Roman chapel, in a text all but destroyed, we would never have learned that Mithra was addressed with hymns.•s They and other features of cult are relatively familiar in the east, not in the west. The chief cause for the difference lies in habits of epigraphy, by which the Greeks set down a large variety of subjects on stone, rather discursively, while the Romans did not. We have confronted the consequences of those customs above. The people they conquered took on their masters' habits. Thus it could be argued that, in Latin lands, the example of liturgy of eastern type and origin was placed before people, therefore no doubt copied, but not reported"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 Perceptible in the type of source on which we depend in Greek lands, namely inscrip-tions. On the other hand, had the Romans possessed a native elaboration of cult to match that of their eastern subjects, it seems odd that they should have imported so much from the east into practices of emperor worship. Such borrowing is plain in texts from Gythion and Arsinoe, for example, and the role of the Dionysiac artists is specially revealing. But all that evi-dence has still to be put together into a single picture, one that does not belong to the gallery that is my concern here. Perhaps what is of concern, the salience of worship that could not be ignored in daily life, can best be illustrated by the customs of Stratonicea, near the southwest comer of (modem) Turkey, with its two nearby sanctu-aries, Hecate's at Lagina and Zeus's at Panamara. The cult of the latter is especially well documented. Indeed, it may be known in fuller detail than any other in ancient times save Judaism. It is, however, quite neglected,l7 perhaps through appearing nowhere in any classical text, only in inscrip-tions, and through being neither Roman nor Greek. Students who attach much living significance to those latter two words in the world of the Apologists, except as they refer to language itself, have (I would think) a good deal of explaining to do; but that is a separate matter. Enough to say here that the coloration taken on by one of those regional deities with which this chapter began throws useful light on the degree of uniformity that may be looked for in our area of study. It was, as I said at the outset, a proper melting pot. Panamara was the home of a male divinity whom visitors and conquer-ors settled on as Zeus, whatever the natives once had called him. The sanc-tuary occupied the flat top of a hill. The circuit wall enclosed a space about 100 by 85 yards. In and around the space and on the temple itself were more than four hundred inscriptions.

There was also a Hera temple in the sanctuary, receiving new paint and plaster one year, as we are told; a dining hall; \"the god's tables\" supplied by the gods' share of the sacrifices offered; a building called the Komyrion; and a monumental portico dressed in stucco. Among the votive objects to be seen, perhaps the most precious were four feet made out of gold to commemorate the gods' active manifestations or epiphanies.

They were the annual ten-day Panamareia, the one-day biennial Heraia, and the two-day Komyria every fifth year. At the beginning of the Panamareia, the idol was set on horseback and taken along the road, a part of which is still paved, for a sojourn in Stratonicea, during which his priest used the city theater to present dancing, singing and acting by professionals hired for the occasion, and in the public baths distributed free oil to the bathers, men and women in their separate buildings, plus cash to the needy in the market-place, wine, and take-home meals. At the end of the sojourn, those who accompanied the god to his home received gifts of sweet pastries and wine en route. For the other two festivals (the Komyria having been instituted only in the first century to solemnize what had been a private rite of adolescence), the amenities were still more lavish: aged wines at banquets with no head table, for the ordinary arranging of guests of course involved worse or less food to hoi polloi; no head table, but drinking parties, love and good cheer, symposia, agape, and euphrosyne, often advertised as part of the \"mys· teries\" which begin to appear in Marcus Aurelius' reign in connection with the Komyria.19 In a period and sequence not easily fixed but nearly com-plete by the later second century, men are first (and necessarily ever after) admitted to the Heraia, and women to the Komyria; and persons not of Stratonicea-Roman citizens, country folk, even slaves-are invit{:!d, and then feasted; and then new items of increasing luxury and frequency are added, in a great tower of celebration built by competitive generosity among the leading citizens over many decades. In the third century the so-called gymnasiarchy of the high priest, meaning the period during which he supplied anointing oil to the baths and gymnasia in the city, totaled twenty~two days; in the fourth century, thirty-four days.

From among the children of those inhabitant families, the priest chose a choir of thirty to sing \"the customary hymn to Hecate just as it has come down from the past.\" 21 This was to be done every day in the municipal senate building, the choristers wreathed in flowers, holding flowers, and accompanied by someone playing the harp. A charming sight, before the lawmakers bent to their labors! Outside, in the portico, since a date near the tum of the second century, stood statues of Zeus, Hecate, Artemis, Asclepius, and Hygieia, statues which wrought miracles.

NEEDS AND ANSWERS Was every one of these many gods just an invention? And did the whole structure of belief that we have surveyed thus rest at last on pure delusion? Achallenge to be taken seriously. As superstition, so-called by some, much of that whole survives today; much (a little changed) receives attention dailyin the newspaper, for readers who see stars. Historians, however, moved by some natural persuasion or by the dictates of their craft, pretend a terrible impiety. They must pretend, not that the gods lived and ruled, but that theydid not exist-yet served. The altogether human needs they served give us our starting point inexamining the life that lay, not in paganism observed, but in paganism felt and thought out. Those needs are reflected in the activities that went on inany center of worship-activities most of which, however, might have fitted just as well in quite different settings. Entertainment or barter or sociable intercourse need not have been sought of absolute necessity intemple precincts and nowhere else. What really did belong? The answer should lie in whatever remains when everything expendable or extraneous is somehow stripped away. There is no more obvious place to begin the search than in Asclepieia. Those particular shrines were very numerous and, if all other places of resort for healing were counted in as well, drew tothemselves more suppliants than any competing category of belief. What could be found there? Dreams and health. The chief business of religion, it might then be said, was to make the sick well. A simple test can be made through inscriptions. They tell us what was expected of gods, sometimes by attaching epithets to them, for example, inaddress or hymn to \"the Healer,\" sometimes by specific thanks for a cure. By the former practice, Asclepius alone is \"the Savior,\" without further defi-nition; Isis and Sarapis, too, emerge as specially great healers, workers of endless medical miracles; but many or most gods could heal.1 49"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"50 Debatable A semifictional biography tells us of sickness caused by a maleficent spirit, who can only be destroyed when a holy man, come to help, calls on the power of some appropriate deity. The anecdote is not particularly rep-resentative of beliefs and practices prevailing in its dramatic setting, western Asia Minor in the later first century; 2 but it provides a convenient transition from the curing of the body by Asclepius, Isis, and other gods, to that of the mind. Mental sickness, too, could be and most commonly was explained as possession. Cure lay through casting out the devil. And the same holy man, Apollonius, is seen to be capable of this feat also.' Powers such as his were commonly on sale in marketplaces throughout the area of our study-so the rather sparse and casual mentions seem to indicate. Though exorcism provided agreeable shivers to the reading public and fed more serious con-victions among evidently unlettered folk, the art itself had no great fame or audience. Christians, however, had their own views. They stood out as frequent and powerful exorcists, \" ... as you can learn even now from things done for all to see: for many persons possessed by demons, everywhere in the world and in our own city, have been exorcized by many of our Christian men\"; \"for some people incontestably and truly drive out demons, so that those very persons often become believers, those cleansed of evil spirits\"; \"let a man be produced right here before your court who, it is clear, is possessed by a demon; and that spirit, commanded to speak by any Christian at all, will as much confess himself a demon in truth as, by lying, he will else-where profess himself a god\"; and \"traces of the Holy Spirit are still pre-served among Christians, whereby they conjure away demons and effect many cures.\" 4 It would be hard to frame more specific assertions than these, from both halves of the Empire and from the mid-second century on to the 230s, joining then with tales of saints in action in the second half of the third century, and so on to the declaration of continuing powers by writers, eastern and western, in the reign of Constantine. Such testimony suggests how helpless people felt before mental illness and how inevitably they turned, therefore, as they did also for the cure of bodily illness, to a source of superhuman aid. It duly met the needs of Christians. But while churches, high in their hierarchy, had designated exorcists, pagans lacked any cor-responding deities, lacked temples known as places of recourse for the possessed, on the model of Asclepieia, and had instead to trust to luck or to some not very respectable help bought in the shadows.

Other things-a winning horse, sexual pleasure, revenge, foreknowledge to be used against one's adversary, and a variety of trivial conveniences of the kind the Sorcerer's Apprentice tried to master-all belonged to the realm of magic.5 For whatever reason, exorcism was included. The point of division was fixed by moral considerations, not exclusively but more than by any others. When Apologists charged that among their persecutors could be found some tolerated pagan who prayed for the death of a fellow being, meaning a gladiator, the reproach proved the rule. Whatever Christians might believe, few pagans thought that gladiatorial combat was immoral, therefore few would have hesitated to send up a gladiator's prayer.6 What pagans did pray for-their needs engendering and giving outline to the divinity they thought they could discern above them-was health, first. That is the best and most easily proven domain of supplication. Others can be illustrated out of the very small minority of votive inscriptions that specify why they were set up. There was beauty, close to health: thanks \"to Minerva for the restoring of hair\"; and prayer for new life, \"to Leto, that my wife bear a child\"; also \"to Zeus Helios the Great Sara pis, savior and giver of wealth\"; \"to Silvanus, from a vision, for freedom from slavery\"; for relief from tax payments; many vows for protection from natural disasters like lightning and earthquakes, or rescue from drowning or (most often) from unspecified \"great dangers,\" for example, on a journey; for protection from one's enemies or the safe return of a squadron from patrol; for safety-and booty; or \"for the safe-being of the colony and its senate and people ... because he [Jupiter Best and Greatest] by his numen tore out and rescued the names of the decurions that had been fixed to monuments by the un-speakable crime of that most wicked city slave.\" Which returns us to magic distinguished from prayer. Some wretched streetsweeper had exercised his right to strikeJ7 It is disappointing that habits of inscription should not have producfd in our period of study a richer body of material; but the sampling just offered is useful in measuring the reach and variety of prayer; and there remain several categories for mention which, if they indicate nothing un-expected, at least define the center of our subject, human needs. Those were the needs, beyond health, which touched an individual's household, do-mestic animals, and crops. The first member of that trinity occurs in vari-ants of the formula, \"for himself and his\" (i.e., his or her people or kin or the like).8 The prayer is so often expressed that, in Latin, it reduces to an abbreviation, a mere four letters.

As to the third member, there is no relation between the importance of winning one's food, on the one hand, and, on the other, the likelihood of prayers on that score being recorded epigraphically. A god or goddess of fertility does not preside over every regional pantheon-surprisingly, since agriculture certainly presided over real life. The nearest approach is Dionysus, guardian of the vine that classi-cal myth proclaimed him and addressed in that capacity just often enoJ.lgh to meet our expectations. Perhaps folk closer to the soil, and further from writing, held to faiths totally unrecorded.10 Other matches exist explicitly or by implication in prayers to Mercury-Hermes from travelers, traders, and market supervisors; to Silvanus from cowherds and hunters; to Poseidon, from those spared in his shaking of the earth; and to Zeus from those spared by his bolts, the gods being seen in the actions assigned to them by all the handbooks. There are special connec-tions we do not understand between young women and Hygia in her temple near Sicyon, as between children of both sexes and Mars Iovantu-carus near Treves.n Of spheres of divine functions, indeed, a great deal more can be sensed than demonstrated. More still was probably left uncer-tain in the minds of worshipers. Warning has already been given against supposing that Apollo or Isis could not heal so quickly as Asclepius. And Artemis in Cyprus or Perge, \"national\" deities that reigned alone, must have answered prayers for aid of every sort, not only within the bounds fixed by Greek convention. Jupiter and Zeus could do everything, witness whole lexica of epithets tacked on to their names. When we survey the full range of human requirements, then, from the most central to the peripheral, looki'ng for a logic that might explain the origin and vitality of religious beliefs, we discover the expected lines of connection quite broken and twisted or, more often, to be drawn only by conjecture. We are to blame the loss of evidence, not the inadequacy of the whole system of cults in themselves. It is not to be supposed that comfort was not somehow afforded to all the various causes of misery in the human condition. It is easy to sense, and worshipers certainly make no effort to hide, in their relation toward the objects of their worship, a spirit of self-interest, of do ut des and contract. That spirit has in the past often drawn reproach. It still does-witness most recently the critic who contrasts \"the Isiaccult[which] possessed a moral system purer, more elevated than that of classical Roman"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"1. Needs and Answers religion. Who did not feel his soul shaken with feelings of admiration as he watched those votaries of Isis plunge thrice into the frozen Tiber and, shivering with cold, creep about the temple?\" Reference is offered then to the source of the picture, Juvenal.12 Juvenal did indeed have strong senti-ments about it: he found it all ethically and esthetically repulsive. And to the notion of the Christian Lactantius, that God could not be expected to love worshipers who did not first bring their love to Him, a pagan might have answered that what mattered was rather the service that the deity could provide, since a god (as Aristotle had long taught) could feel no love in response to that offered. The modern or alien critic of prevailing pagan views, judging the reasons for worship, starts from assumptions that are only his. Their own, pagans found quite comfortable. Among felt wants, the modern observer expects to find none sharper than the need for life, promised for ever. But, like a deity to insure good harvests, assurances of immortality prove unexpectedly hard to find in the evidence. Even the longing for it is not much attested. What can be gleaned from the several kinds of source has been often discussed. The chief features need only brief review. People belonging to one or another of a small number of cults, and it:t small groups, sought further lessons in their beliefs, lessons learned through rites designed to catch the imagination and arouse awe. Impressiveness of presentation could be heightened by rules forbidding the lessons to bf talked about with outsiders. Obedient secrecy of course obscured the his-torical record forever. One group, nevertheless, in the worship of Dionysus, can be faintly discerned through inscriptions, developing more formal ceremonies of instruction, at least in Italy, in the later second and early third century. During the ceremonies, participants may have received prom-ises of afterlife. But evidence for all this is unfortunately very little and very indirect. u Similarly with Isiacism: the evidence lies in the concluding chapters of Apuleius's novel, in which his hero Lucius undergoes a lengthy and most expensive course of instruction at the hands of Isis's priests. At the end, he is fully satisfied by her promise, \"You shall live in blessedness,\" vives beatus; and when life is over, he may continue to worship her. He is the envy of everyone for being renatus, reborn \"in a sort of way\" -defined as having earned the goddess as his patron and at the cost of no more than temporary bankruptcy. There is, however, no word of his being renatus in aeternum, which is what counts.l4 As to Mithraism, it grew like Syrian cults, cell by cell. At meetings in underground chapels, members dined together, sang hymns, and from time to time participated in rites that brought promotion through a series of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"54 Debatable titles and roles. One line of a graffito on the walls of the Santa Prisca Mithraeum in Rome, almost illegible, seems to read rebus renatum dulci-bus atque creatum, \"reborn and created for delights\"; others tell how \"you have saved us(?) by the shedding of eternal blood.\" \"Saved\" for what? \"Re-born to eternity through secret baptism,\" answers an inscription-a for-gery! 15 Nor do Celsus and (a century later) Porphyry serve to clarify the matter much. The one speaks of beliefs in the passage of Mithraists' souls through the seven spheres of the planets, the other, of passage after death into some different living being.1& Which is not to everyone's taste in im-mortality, even if it could be reconciled with the few other fragments of belief that survive. When Sabazius cult by the mid-third century had come into contact with Christian doctrines in Rome, one of its priests depicted his departed wife in a fresco, banqueting among the blessed. There in that scene was immor-tality clearly portrayed;!? but only a part of the portrait, probably a very small part, could be considered pagan, to throw light on unaltered eastern ideas. A mile away, across the Tiber, a certain Gaionas, servant of a Syrian shrine there, died, so his epitaph declares, \"paid in full to death-Gaionas' little soul.\" 18 So flippant a farewell ill suits the moment of rebirth into eternal blessings. The inscription cannot be used to support any broad interpretation of afterlife in the minds of the inhabitants at the center of our time and area of study. Other scraps of evidence survive without adequate context. There are indications of inner circles or more advanced degrees of revelation in a few Greek cults, but what was won by them cannot be discovered. Part of their value lay in their being reserved for special seekers, and their deep secrecy .1s When Theon of Smyrna, some time in Hadrian's reign, speaks of initiation rites as bestowing \"a blessed state of divine grace and companionship with the gods,\" it is not clear what rites he has in mind; when Plutarch, close to the same decade, speaks of finally joining \"the company of the sacred and pure,\" \"the fully liberated and released\" as opposed to \"the uninitiated, uncleansed mob of the living,\" he does not explain what he means by \"The Great Rites,\" the ones producing these results, whether they are the Eleu-sinian or some other; and Tertullian discusses rites of advanced instruction through several different phases or moments, as do the preceding two authors, but in a jumbled paragraph which fails to show what belongs to Mithraists (named), what to various other unspecified mysteria. \"He both celebrates the offering of bread and introduces a likeness of resurrection,\" runs one key sentence. The last word may as well mean \"of the new man,\" reborn in his life like Lucius, as \"of the man that dies.\" 20"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"1. Needs and Answers From all three authors' pictures of initiation, what seems to emerge in clear outline is a considerable clientele-let us say, many thousands at a given moment, but not tens of thousands, since our glimpses are only of the educated classes-in the Greek-speaking world, among whom prevailed some faith in an agreeable afterlife earned by attention to ritual purity; and in Tertullian's world, perhaps similar views more localized in region and class, reflected also in the epitaph of the departed Julia Benenata: \"For I,\" she declares, from her tomb at Mactar in Numidia, \"who always lived in a pious body, inhabit, thanks to divine law, the sweet Elysian Fields of Proserpina, that is the sun whom I have seen on high, with the constella· tions.\" Echoes of Vergil? And surely of Christianity, now, in the late third or fourth century? Of Isiacism, too, or Neoplatonism? But the ideas are widely shared commonplaces; whether literary or genuinely religious, it is very hard to say; and (returning us to an eastern setting, possibly Egyptian) there remains the one generalization that survives from our period, inserted casually in a religious tract: \"as hoi polloi believe, when the soul leaves the body, it turns into an anima1.\"21 In all the \"Oriental\" cults in general, whether of Atargatis, Mithra, Isis, or Cybele, the element of resurrection has received emphatic attention in studies old and new-attention emphatic but not always firmly controlled. It should really not be taken for granted, as it often is assumed, that people who believe a god might rise from death also believed in such a blessing for themselves as well. The conjecture needs support-and finds none.22 More· over, in one of these Oriental cults, though the death of Attis is primordial, there is no mention of his resurrection in sources before the end of the second century at the earliest. 23 A second feature of the same cult, ritual cleansing in the blood of a bull, has been taken as a sign of belief in the possibility of life after death. What it was actually thought to grant, how-ever, was an extension of one's earthly existence, in a state of ritual purity, and then only for a limited term of years.24 On the views of death most commonly held in the world of the Apolo· gists, there exist one or two statements of quite broad import by contem· poraries. They should be brought forward as a sort of summary to the positive evidence assembled in the preceding pages. Justin (to begin with that figure of the mid-second century) declares that pagans do indeed en· vision some afterlife, witness their belief in magic (he means, practiced at tombs upon the spirits of the deceased) and possession by demons. But, in saying this, he chooses peculiarly roundabout ways of substantiating his point, at least, if the Elysian Fields had been much talked about. He goes on to appeal to statements, unspecified, from the oracles of Amphilochus,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"56 Debatable Dodona, Pytho, \"and many others.\" That too is not probative, because of its vagueness.2s Lactantius can do a little better. He cites not only anony· mous philosophers and seers but a particular reply from Apollo at Didyma. \"Does the soul survive death?\" Yes, says the god, it is borne into the aether, there to exist forever. The passage has been quoted above.26Jt is as interest· ing for what it does not say as for what it does: it instances no easily recog· nizable, universal, or at least very familiar deity to name, whose followers all trusted in his power to save them from extinction. Nothing like that existed. In striking the true balance of the evidence we should return, too, to Plutarch's circle. How pious it was can be sensed from many conversations he records or imagines. One of the most forceful is inspired by the subject of Epicureanism, naturally enough, since that was the chief stronghold of atheists. During the exchange, one of the company wishes to underline the delights and rewards of piety. \"No visit,\" he says (IIOlE), \"gladdens us more than a visit to a shrine, no season, more than a festival, nothing done or said, more than what we see and do in regard to the gods, whether we are present at secret rites, or at dancing, sacrifices or initiations.\" But if those last had conferred immortality, surely they would not have received so casual a mention, added by afterthought to such agreeable diversions as one might find at a church picnic. Initiations, teletai, can have meant nothing more soul-shaking than those big, open spectacles encountered in the first chapter, above, as they unfolded in theaters. Spectators received no special promises. The pagan Celsus takes Christian ideas of resurrection as being, at best, metempsychosis misunderstood; at worst, ridiculous; and the pagan Caeci· lius, in Minucius Felix's dialogue, agrees.27 The pagan Seneca rejects with scorn the whole Greek afterlife, Ixion, Cerberus, and the rest, in favor of the disembodied spirit reserved to a second, Stoic existence within the very heart of light.28 He represented the cast of mind most often to be found within that class that gave its thought to abstract questions; he represents its strengths, also its weakness. For, with no very significant or prominent exceptions, people of all directions of belie£, to the extent they could con· ceive of life continuing beyond the grave, did so in terms of the divine spark, as we might call it, the disembodied soul. That was very much a philosopher's view, one of those convictions one may hold without always remembering one holds it. No one cared greatly that he might gain eternal life if it were not really he that gained it, rather, some animula, some particle ephemerally spun off from the Great Soul, or the like.

Needs and Answers or similar ideas of immortality had little to do with people's most earnest longings. Inscriptions here as on other points hold out the best hope for a broad sampling. \"Savior\" in them, or \"salvation,\" had to do with health or other matters of this earth, 29 not of the soul for life eternal. Or in epitaphs, people so often joke about annihilation that the jokes at last congeal into com-monplaces or abbreviations: \"I was not, I am not, I care not,\" boiled down to six letters.50 Or, last, in rules of cult associations, even those intimate gatherings of the faithful around a table that so instantly recall the Eucha-rist-but wrongly: the most telling note is struck by the injunction, \"do not vomit up your wine.\" If there is no absolute certainty that banquets were not thought of in times past (as they have been so often by modern inter-preters) as conferring immortality, there is no scrap of testimony to such a thing; and the silence itself is quite extraordinary. No, at festal meals, as at teletai of dancing and music, the wine, women, and song satisfied wants more simple and secular.51 At Panamara, at the two-day Zeus festival, the crowds invited from far and wide to what were officially termed \"mysteries,\" and who there received the wine from the priest at solemn meals, enjoyed a fellowship with the gods among them-that may be assumed, that would be typical of such cult meals-but no life promised forever after. The aim of the foregoing discussion is the quite elementary one of estab-lishing the qegree of correspondence between common emotional wants and the satisfaction supplied by religion. That aim it seems natural to pursue first on the level of the individual, but the individual multiplied by millions. Thereby we should gain some sense of the vitality o£ paganism-key word in this second chapter. Before resuming examination of individuals' feelings, however, it might be best to consider the satisfaction offered by religion in larger contexts. It was certainly recognized throughout antiquity, at least by people able to look at their world with any detachment, that religion served to strengthen the existing social order. Explicit statements to this effect, and very interest-ing ones (because the juggling of high principle and selfish advantage always rewards the spectator), can be found across a string of well-known writers, who protest the crucial role of religion among the masses. Public largesses such as were described in the preceding chapter-the enormously expensive distributions of wine, liqueurs, meat, pastries, more wine, and cash-should be made, says Plutarch, \"on an occasion affording a graceful, noble pretext, through honor to god that draws everyone to piety; for in hoi polloi at the same time a strong belief in, and conviction about, how grand the divinity is, and how august, is engendered when they see those whom"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"58 Debatable they honor and consider great, themselves so liberally and zealously com-peting in regard to the divine.\" 52 Which by no means convicts Plutarch of hypocrisy. He had his faith and believed in its truth; hoi polloi had theirs, and he believed in its usefulness. Many gods in one particular region, Phrygia, could be counted on to avenge themselves upon the wicked. That certainty was encountered earlier (p. 32), along with similar ones thinly scattered in other quarters as well. Most characteristically, it was the man forsworn on whom some punish-ment descended. ss Most often, in both halves of the Empire, it was the water of a sacred spring or river that scalded or melted away the flesh of the per-jurer. But (magic aside, which does not quite belong to this book) the wretch who disturbs a tomb is threatened, too, in epitaphs sometimes found in Phrygia. One invokes vengeance from \"the gods of the Roman People,\" no doubt conceived to be supremely effective.'4 And frequent abasement in Phrygian sanctuaries before a god whose wrath is feared finds parallels occasionally elsewhere, both as an individual and as a general or loose-floating belief. Isis, wherever she was worshiped, was thought to seek out criminals and strike them blind or paralytic, Sol-Helios saw their every misdeed, and the pagan Celsus professed faith on behalf of himself and others that the wicked would be made to suffer. So one is taught, he says, in undergoing initiation into the mysteries. He means, of course, sufferings on this earth as distinct from the pains of hell fire.55 A second distinction must be kept in mind, too: between misdoings defined in terms of laws divine or human. In terms of the former, offense lies against ritual purity or the sacredness of a god's own dwelling. Perjurers will be caught only if they sin in the very face of the god, the virgin-not-a-virgin, only if she immerses herself in sacred waters. When people expect divine vengeance, it is usually in circumstances of this sort, not through supposing that the human and divine sense of right and wrong will be identically offended and that retribution will thereupon reach out to catch the criminal wherever he may be. Of such a grander faith there are very few signs indeed, at least in cults untouched by Judaism. Phrygia provides an exceptional inscription; Lydia and Lycaonia a few more, nearby; and there are further scraps and hints in Hermetism and Mithraism.36 What emerges, however, are glimpses of an expectation of punishment-that is, guilt-attached to no one cult in any significant manner, rather little talked about or counted on, and generally felt in regard only to basic tabus: parricide, for instance, and incest. With these conclusions we may return to look a second time at Plutarch's views. They represent the end of a string of statements on the social usefulness of religious faith, going back to the fifth century B.c."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"I. Needs and Answers 59 Perhaps not chance but change of perception and diminishing detachment accounts for their being almost the last. And Plutarch does not, after all, say exactly what his predecessors had said (that religion keeps the masses down, or honest); rather, that the masses' faith should be stimulated so as to direct their thoughts upward in reverence for nobility: to be found among the gods, found likewise among the local-nobility. Naturally, he could also see the practical value in having as many people as possible discern a sort of harmony and mutual respect between the gods and the city magnates. We have earlier heard an orator inventing and pub-lishing in a theater certain wonderful visitations from above, in favor of this or that sitting magistrate.57 Cicero told the Roman Assembly that Pompey deserved a high command, being born to it by divine plan, divino quodam consilio natus esse videatur. He made the proposition incontest· able with his favorite clausulass_not that he himself believed a word of it. We might accuse him, and his brother orators in the east, of empty compli· ments to which not even the most credulous audience could have attached much meaning, were it not for the evidence of private supplications on the people's behalf-that is, by a citizen for his village, city, or neighborhood. It is hard to see what gave rise to these other than a perfectly sincere convic-tion, a certainty that the gods did care about the whole unit which offered them its cult. 59 More proof of this sincerity appears in plague times, when city senates tried to enlist the direct help, or at least the advice, of some god in their salvation. •0 Again, we ourselves may be skeptical. In desperation, any measure might be tried, however little credited. Yet some of our inscrip-tions, to say nothing of Aristides' report on his private efforts, declare after the event that salvation had been really won by prayer: plagues or earth· quakes had been ended, unspecified benefits bestowed, the Goths scattered. 41 That partnership, mutually respectful, between the powers above and the leadership below, was seen actually to work. But how, precisely, did it do this? By what means could any contact be established with the beings of another world? From testimonies to a living faith (which we are not done with yet) we must turn briefly to its quite mechanical functioning. Aside from rare and rarefied speculation on sympathetic magic, inhabitants of the Apologists' world thought first to touch the gods through images, because that was where the gods lived; or at least, to images they could be brought by entreaty, there to listen and to act. Whether or not they fitted exactly, whether they looked like their portraits in stone or wood, they were to be found inside. Christian observers, who had no reason not to be accurate, report this as the generally prevailing idea.42 Moreover, three Greek pagans at·"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"60 Debatable tribute miracles to statues of men who lived in their own, the second, cen-tury. One statue fell over and killed a man and then, being punished by drowning, got itself fetched up again from the sea. A second provided cures to suppliants. A third and fourth respectively provided cures and oracles. And a statue of Antinous in the city renamed for him wrought unspecified miracles, as even a Christian could concede. So ready were people to attrib-ute powers to images even of mortals, so ready to see the divine even in their fellows!43 A final glimpse takes us to Palestine in the fourth century, there to find women consulting the image of Aphrodite on their choice of hus-band, or the sick cured by the weeds that grew at the base of a certain bronze statue. Local inhabitants, questioned by a touring bishop, regretted they could not identify it. They suggested, however, that it looked very much like Jesus. 44 There was a second means by which contact could be made with the gods, beyond their images. That lay through sleep. In antiquity, dreams as such constitute a very large subject, studied for centuries by learned men-their handbooks published, passed on to the next generation, and so fattened into miracles of sound scholarship under the names of Artemidorus, and others. But that is all by the way. So too are the interpreters that served Isis or Asclepius and their customers in dormitories, another large subject in which specially figures the name of Aelius Aristides. More to the purpose are the sheer numbers of testimonies to the appearance of divine figures before the minds of sleepers. 45 They introduce an extraordinary variety of gods and goddesses spread broadcast over all provinces, acknowledged typically in the form, \"To Such-and-Such, from having seen,\" or \"having been advised\" or \"commanded,\" or \"by order\" or \"in a dream.\" The formu-las occur also in literary sources that describe nocturnal revelations.46 When a man died, he might somehow earn promotion to demigod and, as \"hero,\" could appear to worshipers in their dreams. So could the Genius of a given legion. The two examples convey how quickly and carelessly the practice of consulting deities through sleep might spread, even to the most newly invented inhabitants of the heavens. 47 Corporate bodies might act on dreams as well, presumably not vouchsafed on one night to every member of the town council.481t was their priest's experience, perhaps, and then interpreted to them? And sailors off the north coast of the Black Sea could count on the hero Achilles to tell them in their sleep just where the best anchorages lay. That was common knowledge; visions of the Dioscuri seen by sailors, also common; but less well known, thatPatroclus, too, might be seen in local waters. All this Arrian discovered in his tour of the area during Trajan's reign.49"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"1. Needs and Answers 61 Famous only in their own region, these heroes' visits from above serve to correct the impression that might be gained from Asclepius's visits, famous in every region: it was not only in the latter's hundreds of shrines that people counted on contact with the divine through dreams. Origen, exter-nal observer and therefore to be heard with special attention, declares that \"it happens to lots of people that a dream reveals to them that they should do something\" -instructed by an angel or some other means, he adds. He does not intend pagans alone. Celsus, too, is quoted, \"that someone in a certain condition, dreaming or out of his own wish, may have an experi-ence, an illusory vision that carries some message to him, as has happened to tens of thousands.\" 50 \"Out of his own wish\" -evidently, then, just as one could have them at Asclepieia (else why venture the journey?), so one could turn them on at will in any temple. \"I have come to see a dream that will give a sign to me on the matter about which I am praying,\" reads an inscription from a shrine in the Greek-speaking world. And from the Latin, the incident in a novel in which a woman is sick: \"and for that reason I inquired for a treatment through dreaming; and I was commanded .... \"51 While there are scattered indications that experts might be called in to the interpretation, that practice was a local matter and not prevalent.52 Nor-mally, one helped oneself. Iussus, \"I was commanded,\" is so frequently a boast as to be abbreviated in Latin inscriptions, v(otum) i(ussu) d(ei) f(ecit).55 In Greek inscriptions, equivalents are, if anything, more easily found. And the only deity whose votaries seem to enjoy a detectably greater access to his will (such is the impression gained from inscriptions) is Jupiter Dolichenus, from the east, but probably better known in the west. The peak of his popularity belongs just in the middle of our period of study. In the world of the Apologists, contact with the gods lay most often through signs and scenes longed for and granted to the suppliant in sleep, thereafter in waking to be interpreted. The process served pagans as prayer served jews and Christians. It would of course be quite parochial to sup-pose that, in every land and every age, the plea for help can only follow certain forms or not exist at all. But a third means of contact, neither through idols nor dreams, joined worshipers to the objects of their worship, namely, oracles. This is the means most familiar. It is characterized by the interposing of a third party (not invariably but almost always needed) between the two that must com-municate. A priest, priestess, seer, or spokesman of some sort gives the deity's answer to spoken or written questions. Plutarch wrote a well-known essay on the decline of oracles, meaning in central Greece.

More obviously, however, it brings to the fore an element of dissent within the body of polytheism. 2. THE VITALITY OF PAGANISM The health of that body we must now begin to examine. It is convenient to look first at the group just mentioned, Epicureans, who represented the furthest extreme of disbelief. But aside from their name's being attached in obloquy to anyone who doubted a local oracle-\"Atheist or Christian or Epicurean\"-they hardly appear in the sources for our period.1 It is rather their company that calls for comment: they are close to Christians, and that, in mid-second century Pontus, was not good. They are close to atheists, and that was a great deal worse. In public, as many statements make clear, to deny the reality of the gods was absolutely unacceptable. You would be ostracized for that, even stoned in the streets.2 There is no need to recall the scenes of persecution in Smyrna, Rome, and Lyon in which the mob rails at Christians as godless.8 An Apologist acknowledges his opponent's feelings: you \"believe that to worship no god at all is impious and unholy.\" A con-temporary, but a pagan, Aelian, condemns the atheist who, with alien \"wisdom,\" disputes whether the gods exist or not,4 and Lucian, a half-century later, declares that \"the great majority of Greeks and all the non-Greeks\" (which includes Romans) are believers.5 To have the same author, in contradiction of himself, tell us there were no worshipers left to Zeus any more is certainly puzzling; puzzling, that our learned friend the Epicurean of Oenoanda, Diogenes, should have dared instruct his fellow citizens in the freethinking of his sect, spellesi out across the most public walls in town (above, pp. 10-11); and puzzling, that the same ardent Romans who burnt the \"atheist\" Justin should, in Juvenal's day, have laughed at anyone professing faith in an altar or temple. So the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"2.

We may take their like for granted elsewhere, if there were other sites so well preserved.? In Africa, down the coast from Carthage, a rich man commissioned a semipermanent, semi-public bit of humor: a mosaic wall with figures and captions making fun of the gods at their feasting.8 This is the kind of mixed bag of facts that renders general statements about religious life so hard to frame or so easily criticized if they are framed too narrowly. What, for instance, can one make of the assertion that oracles, \"it is true, enjoyed a recovery in popularity in the second century\"-for which a single inscription is cited, recording help sought by a city in Sardinia from Apollo in Claros? 9 Such characterizing of the feelings and thoughts of fifty million people on any day out of thirty-six thousand has something ludicrous about it, as if one were to measure the pulse of the western world on the basis of a single headline in the St. Albans Sentinel. Worse than that, perhaps: since religious feelings are not something to talk about in public, in some of their aspects, they must prove all the harder to assess from the outside. The more need for care. Let us consider a few further contradictions suggested by the important role of inner emotions in religion. Lactantius tells pagans to their face (and there is a sort of reliability in such testimony, out in the open and instantly subject to challenge by contemporary readers) that theirs is \"a superstition about those gods of theirs ... in which, for all I can see, there is no more than worship by the finger-tips ... , nothing required but the blood of one's flocks, and smoke, and foolish libations.\" In contrast, Porphyry declares \"the one who loves god cannot love pleasure or body; but the latter sort of man will love money and so be unjust, and the unjust man is unholy, both toward god and his ancestors, and a criminal in his conduct toward others. So he may sacrifice hecatombs and adorn the temples with a myri,ad oifer-ings, but he remains impious and godless and, in true calling, a sacrilegious person.\" 10 Or we may turn back from the later Empire to the earlier, there to read, \"Vesta, be gracious! To you we now open our lips for worship-if indeed we may join your ceremonies. I was completely absorbed in prayer, I was aware of the divine powers; and the earth, joyful, shone back with a dark red glow.\" And another's assertion that \"all men feel a powerful longing to honor deity and pay cull from close up, drawing near and seizing hold with persuasion, offering sacrifices and crowning with wreaths.

But consider for comparison the scene of devotion that Seneca painted (above, p. 44), in which simplicity of feeling and intensity itself are derided as madness. And in other pages too long to quote, leading up to that scene, he dismisses the dancing or howling or bloodied priests of Cybele or Isis or Bellona, all of them as revolting as they are demented-the very manifestations of \"true\" piety that modern students most often point tol12 Even Porphyry's plea for god and ancestors, almost equating the terms of the two, and sounding a note so exactly in tune with all those praises of one's inheritance that were heard in the first chapter (above, p. 3)-even Porphyry's plea Seneca denies head on: \"What of the fact that we even join the gods in marriage, and dishonorable marriage at that, the marriage of brother and sister? We give Bellona in marriage to Mars, Venus to Vulcan, and Salada to Neptune. But some we leave unwed, as if no match could be arranged, especially since some are widows, such as Populonia, Fulgora and the goddess Rumina. I am not at all surprised that there has been no suitor for these. As for all this obscure throng of gods, assembled through long years of ancient superstition, we shall invoke them, but with the reservation in mind that their worship belongs rather to custom than truth.\" The repudiation of mythology here is echoed by other writers as well.1s Enough of such contradictions-which, useful though they may be to indicate the bounds of the possible, chiefly demand resolution. It cannot be found, however often sought, in the change from one century to another-from \"the religious crisis in the Roman world at the end of the Republic and beginning of the Empire\" to \"the second century with its powerful upsurge in religious life,\" then the mid-second century to the early fourth, all one \"age of anxiety,\" in its later phases coinciding with \"the decline of paganism in the second half of the third century.\" 14 Conventional and representative of a sort of scholarly consensus regarding successive develop-ments within our subject, that succession of periods must nevertheless be looked at critically. All of its parts are made of, or meant to describe, religi-osity, not only the whole nexus of thoughts and feelings about the divine, but their intensity or vitality as well. For the final period of decline, sub-stantiation is sought in the much-diminished epigraphic record, not in what it says but in its very silence. The silence itself is a fact plain and un-contested, though its interpretation is something else again. We will return"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"2. The Vitality of Paganism 65 to that matter, later. But for the other periods, the sources used are almost wholly literary, since \"inscriptions seldom tell us much about the under-lying personal experience.\" 15 Here too is a fact uncontested, witness the passages called on in the last few pages to convey a sense of what emotions characterized moments of active worship. They are drawn from a meta· physician, Porphyry; a poet, Ovid; a rhetor, Dio Chrysostom; and still others that display or suggest deep attachments or experiences might be found in a novelist and rhetor, Ap!-lleius, in a natural philosopher, Aelian, or in other poets.16 Inscriptions provide no match. There are, however, two objections to be raised against reliance on such authorities. First, they represeQt only a small group. The fact has been stressed before. Summing up a good deal of discussion, it is stressed again, below (p. 88). Second, even that small group they do not represent accu· rately. To examine the latter objection: as is clear in the opposing pairs of quo· tations ~hat were just presented, the religious feelings most common in the Empire, and those considered suitable or \"true,\" covered a very wide spec· trum indeed. Explanation lies in plain human variety, not in place or period. Moreover, the range indicated in the comparisons could be easily extended by the inclusion of prinking and frivolity in sacred processions, erotic or abnormal titillation in cult groups (or in novelistic fantasies about them), exaltation roused by concentrated and emotive word pictures de· scribing the great powers and loving kindness of a god-and so forth. Ex-amples of all such passages in the literature of our two centuries of study have been offered above.1' Except from a sectarian point of view, then, it would be wrong to pick out one or a few particular dispositions as charac· teristic of paganism. Indeed, it is my guess that the variety of feelings satisfied in the practice of I religion differs inconsequentially from age to age, however much accepted patterns of behavior to receive those feelings change in shape; for, as Nock wrote, \"there are fashions in religion as in everything else.\" 18 If my guess should be righ4 religiosity in any society as a whole would likewise differ inconsequentially across time, and the several phases or periods which it is conventional to distinguish in the religious history of the Roman Empire would lose all meaning. Whether one age is \"more religious\" than another, that is, whether it actually stimulates its inhabitants to significantly dif· ferent levels of emotion in the service of their god or gods, is a question almost too important to leave alone; but surely even those who choose to offer an answer to it for ffieir own living generation, if they were really pressed, would admit they had no evidence anvwhere near adeauate in"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"66 Debatable scope or weight to support any opinion. Hope of discovering the truth about a remote and ill-documented period it would be foolish to entertain. Let us rejoin the circle of writers from whom we turned aside a moment ago. None in the present connection is better known or more certain to be referred to than Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor. His Stoicism, how-ever, stands out in isolation. There are no signs of a similar devotion in the preceding half-century. Suppose that we knew nothing of his meditations, or that another spiritual diary of the same bent but from a half-century later were discovered, would historians have any difficulty in accommodating either possibility? Would either be clearly at odds with its context? Surely not. There is a quite inadequate, and therefore indiscriminately welcom· ing, texture of evidence across the whole period of this study. Accordingly, the emperor's devotion has human interest but not historical. Even-or perhaps one should say, especially-a careful examination of the man and his time must conclude by admitting that we do not know to what extent he typified his own aristocratic circle.19 The same admission should guide the student of Plutarch's circle, earlier, or Porphyry's, later. Marcus Aurelius and the other names most likely to occur in a book about the cults of the Empire are in any case self-selected for the interest they felt in their own spiritual life and things divine. They wrote on those subjects. Not everybody did. Some people are simply more given to belief than others, like Teucrus of Cyzicus, who journeyed to Pergamon in search of relief from epilepsy. There Asclepius \"appeared to him, and they struck up a conversation, and he developed a quartan fever, and through it recov-ered from epilepsy.\" They \"struck up a conversation\"-extraordinary! Or D. A. Lazurkina at a congress of the Communist party not many years ago, who reported, \"Yesterday I consulted Lenin again . . . and he said to me .... \"2o There is epigraphic confirmation for the point, perhaps. Among vows paid to the more prominent deities, where some very rough statistical tests are possible, and particularly among those vows that depart at all from the bare formulas of dedication, dedicants who identify themselves as servants of the god-priests or the like-are present disproportionately, in com· parison to ordinary dedicants. Some of them are quite lowly. 21 The cult of Asclepius at Epidaurus presents a striking case: the sanctuary is filled with scores of altars set up by the priests themselves.22 Another illustration lies in the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus, whose priests made themselves exceptionally prominent.25 It was naturally to their advantage to celebrate the deity who fed and sheltered them; no less natural, we should grant them, to feel a genuine faith. That faith prevailed over advantage is suggested by those"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"2. The Vitality of Paganism 67 priests of one deity who offered tribute to another.24 Taken as a class, they were surely representatives of human nature at its most devout. It would not be too cynical, but simply wrong, to attribute to the profes-sional servant of the gods real doubt about their existence or efficacy; for most of the most highly admired and educated people in the world about him were quite at one with his convictions-at the top, the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who doubted wonder-workers but credited healing dreams, above all, those sent by Asclepius. Everyone agreed: Marcus's teacher Fronto, for one.2s But there is no need to call up from earlier pages the proofs of un-feigned belief to be found in virtually every writer of the second and third centuries whose works survive. They all believed; which cannot be expected to mean that they all believed everything. The variety of religious convic-tions or systems (to which we will return) matches the variety of emotions regarding the divine; but the former can be examined with some hope of understanding them. The latter, as has been said, lie beyond reach of profitable discussion. What is untypical about the religious views of the highly educated we may identify by following them out beyond the surviving literary corpus. Will that distort those views? Apparently not. Some literary works are known only through copies on stone. Our sources epigraphic and literary join without a seam.26 But acceptance of the gods is as widespread in inscriptions as is implied, for instance, by Lucian, when he counts listeners to atheism as so few.27 We would have been misled had we given too much weight to his own scepticism, or Seneca's. Here is one illustration of the danger of relying only on a small selection of writers. For a second illustra-tion: the gods ·addressed in inscriptions are described only in very broad strokes and simple affirmations, in a shouted phrase, for example-\"The One,\" \"Greatest,\" \"Savior\" -or in a string of epithets without integration: \"swift-running,\" \"dwelling on high.\" 2s Examples of the style have been offered in the preceding chapter. The resulting picture of the gods is oddly pointillist, as if in acceptance of each one's birth and growth out of the visions of all his votaries, individually, by quite uncontrolled accretion-pointillist and motionless: it is rare that the gods are seen in action in any episode of their story, though a life or biography many of them are indeed known to have possessed. 29 The literary treatment of religion in this respect also matches the epigraphic. After Ovid, back at the tum of the era, and all the way up to Claudian and Nonnus at the edge of another great break in history, writers show little interest in anecdotes from \"mythology,\" as we would call it. So it would be misleading to draw our own impressions too much from certain exceptional passages in Plutarch, let us say."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"68 Debatable Literary evidence, at least in Greek, joins closely with one other type, papyrological. There is no sharp break detectable in moving from the style and interests that broadly prevail in one, to the other. Good reason, there-fore, to trust to Egypt for some impression of the place of religion in litera-ture-though that province was famed for being particularly addicted to sacred lore and studies. Out of some thousands of papyri, whole or frag· ments, that are of literary character, only a small number focus directly on religion. Numenius, Ammonius, Plotinus, and Porphyry make no appear-ance; other philosophers very rarely and for treatises on government or ethics or logic. ao There is a Hellenistic scrap of Orphism, there are two or three scraps of aretalogy, quite a few hymns and paeans (so far, the same mix found in inscriptions, minus the votive), plus bits and pieces of fiction describing scenes of worship. Throughout this little corpus of texts there is a distinctly regional quality, to which Isis and Osiris especially contribute. Had anyone demanded a larger share of the written word for piety, there was an answer ready to meet him: all the big temples had their own libraries, containing no doubt the same sort of prose and verse in praise of native deities that still survives, but in much, much greater abundance; beyond that, representing Hellenic culture in a broad sense, there was Homer. A majority of all identifiable literary papyri are the two epics, or commentary; and Hesiod is high in popularity, too. Those, it might have been said, were the old and the new testaments of truest Hellenism. In trying to understand the faith prevailing in the lettered classes, use is commonly made of Gnostic, Hermetic, Chaldaean, Neoplatonic, Orphic, or Neopythagorean texts. With favorite selections drawn from other genres, they constitute the material from which the modern account of religious feeling in our period of study is typically composed. They are, however, given an importance quite out of scale with what contemporaries conceived their faith to be. \"The underlying personal experience\" (above, p. 65) is indeed far better found, at its very deepest, in Gnostic texts and the like. To call this deepest level \"religion\" without further qualification misrepre-sents the subject. So much for the first objection that must be raised against choosing one's sources to fit one's modern preconceptions-against reliance, that is, on a small group of writers. The choice must rather widen to include experiences by no means intense, but no less a fact; concerns by no means profound, but no less sincerely expressed; and indifference or positive rejection almost as strongly represented as high-wrought religiosity. This said, nothing is sub-tracted from the subject. It is only taken away from a little, rather peculiar collection of books, and restored to a very much larger circle of real people,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"2. The Vitality of Paganism 69 some of whom (like any sampling from the Canterbury Tales, Simplicissi-mus, or War and Peace) felt religion at the heart always; most, at the finger-tips, as Lactantius puts it; and a few, never at all. The second objection lies against the presenting of religion in our period only through the testimony of writers and readers. How few they were in the entire population has already been emphasized. That they were dif-ferent remains to be asserted. Plutarch may stand for a type thoroughly accepted among the well edu-cated and well-to-do. He had a broad range of friends and interests Roman and Greek, even (but not untypically) reaching beyond, to write our only extant essay on Isiacism. He counted as more devout than most. In his col-lection of antiquarian oddments called Quaestiones Romanae, he takes up about a hundred customs having to do with Roman religion. For example: (1) Why do the Romans consider Kronos the father of truth? (Because they suppose Kronos is Chronos, Time, and time discovers truth?) (2) Why do they pay honor to the dead in December? (Because in that month all grow-ing things have done with their lives?) (3)Why may the priest of Jupiter never anoint himself in the open? (Because it is not decent for a son to strip before a father, and Jupiter is the father of all?) (4) Why are slave women barred from the shrine of Matuta? (Because her Greek equivalent, I no, was jealous of a slave woman on her husband's account?) (5) Why may the King of Sacrifices never address the people? (Because the Romans expelled their kings, and wish to limit his semblance to cult acts?) And (6) Why is Rome's guardian deity never named? (Because that protects him from being con-jured away?)31 The answers he offers to his questions he arrives at through six charac-teristic modes of thought. They lie in punning, in symbolic or esthetic appropriateness, in analogy with mortal customs, in echo of myth or a deity's life story, in historical accident, and in suitability for achieving some result, through binding or pleasing a deity. Only that last could be called functional, that is, only in that category of explanation does Plutarch consider the gods and their will as really existing. All the others (the next to last being the most often invoked) assume that cult is wholly man-made. His approach, not only in the first category, is bookish in the extreme, and in a sense also extremely rational. By contrast, an inscription from third-century Dacia in semiliterate Latin describes how Aurelius Martinus Basus and Aurelius Castor Polydeuces, \"standing about, saw the spirit of an eagle come down from a hill upon three snakes. One big viper tangled up the eagle. The aforementioned freed the eagle from danger. They set this up as their vow deserved, willingly,\" to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"70 Debatable the sky god Jupiter of Doliche.32 Somehow they felt the divine had entered th.eir lives, and in a fashion far from bookish and rational, they did what needed to be done. The differences in religion separating the upper class from the lower (and no middle really existed) can be more easily sensed than brought out explicitly through the evidence. That they existed, at least one of the two well knew, and reminded the other in clear and often scornful terms. ss They may all be gathered under one alone: \"superstition.\" In tum, however, what we and the ancients, too, indicate by that term is a crudeness of convic-tion in regard to both the gods' sphere of action and their nature. The two elements in \"superstition\" now to be examined should be kept distinct so as to grasp the meaning of the word clearly and to understand the chief class differences in religious views. The wonderful happening in which the two Aurelii participated brought the god of Doliche down from the sky to the very roadside. It was a sign that they could touch-as Timoleon's soldiers could touch the load of parsley on the mule's back, when they passed it on their way. They took it for a portent. Plutarch tells the story (the explanation does not concern us), calling it an instance of superstition. 34 He uses the word to express his dis-agreement with those who would take a perfectly ordinary event, as he saw it, and ascribe divine dimensions to it. The more a person saw the gods at work in the material world-moving things around, for instance-and the less a person explained in terms of'natural causes, the clearer was the presence of superstition. Over the course of the centuries chosen for examination here, supersti-tion within this meaning certainly increased. The fact is best sensed (to say \"measured\" would imply a degree of accuracy beyond our reach) in the greater prominence of magic; for magic, after all, is most shortly defined as the art that brings about the intervention of superhuman powers in the material world-\"moving things around, for instance.\" Proof of the prac-tice of the art grows more abundant, most obviously in recipes and hand-books written on papyrus. It is to be found in every province, for example, in leaden curse tablets. And people who should have known better come to credit invocations with an efficacy that, in some previous century, would never have been believed. It means nothing that a late orator attributed an ineffectual speech to hexing by jealous detractors; an early orator, consul in Cicero's day, offered the same excuse; but when the very emperor resorted to wizards to aid him in his wars, times had changed. 55 Perhaps no new ideas are to be discovered, but old ones are found in circles previously immune to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"2.

With the change, no doubt partly cause and partly effect, philosophy in the old sense fell out of favor. This too is a phenomenon well known. It is often remarked among the upper classes. It shows itself in times of peace and prosperity in the later second century, or at least the symptoms that characterize the developed disease are by that period already discoverable. Its origins therefore cannot lie in the decline of wealth, schools, libraries, endowed chairs of learning, and the like, although all these latter indeed suffered in the third century. Alternatively, to explain the waning of phi-losophy as a mere fashion, in Nock's term (above, p. 65), provides no serious answer unless the fashion itself can be derived. But contemporaries had their own explanation: \"philosophers agree about nothing-one of them even says that silver is black. You can hear more uproar from a house-hold of philosophers than from a household of madmen.'' 36 And variations on the theme: \"I frequented the schools of the philosophers [at Rome] and found nothing but preparation for the overthrow of doctrines; competing and arguing; and tricks of syllogizing and the imagining of premisses\"-from all of which the wise man would turn away to more profitable studies. 37 At the end of our period, the emperor himself before a learned gathering could describe \"Socrates, elated by his debating powers, making the weaker reasoning appear the stronger, and pll!lying about with mutually contradic-tory arguments ... , and Pythagoras as well, while pretending to practise self-control in a special degree, and silence, too, was caught in impos-ture ... , and finally Plato, up to a point, was wise, but in other matters he is found to have erred from the truth.'' se They had all been wrong, every one. Disciplined abstract thought, tested by challenges made sharp in the course of fierce fights over many, many centuries, the challenges themselves not to be handled or even understood by the casual observer, had passed from favor. As in the history of warfare periods emerge in which attack prevails over defense, so in the history of thought a time had come in which the nays had it. Every proposition could be overthrown by ten different arguments. All the arguments were in every student's hands, or handbooks. And the casual observer whose interest counted for most had spent his youth, not in a university, but in some catechetical school or, more likely, in a barracks. Thus the balance of techniques of debate, and then political and economic troubles, and the hastening advancement of people new to wealth and cultural leadership, combined to bring on the moment when Constantine could simply wave philosophy aside without being laughed at."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"72 Debatable That was the test: ridicule. Fully to sense the meaning of Constantine's preposterous pontification, he must be imagined speaking at Plutarch's table. There, his views would have produced delighted grins; likewise, no doubt, in the company of Lucian or Apuleius. Lucian knew of opinionated ignoramuses in very high places indeed, followers of the pious fraud Alexander. They were the equal in gullibility of the population of Abonu-teichus where Alexander set up shop. Lucian expects his readers to laugh at them, as Apuleius could hope (a little anxiously, in a small town like Oea) to raise a laugh at yokel accusations of magic. He practiced no magic, he insisted in his defense, but scientific experiment in the tradition of Aristotle. Who but a clod could misinterpret that? With his trial, we have passed the mid-second century. We still feel a difference-the difference between \"reli-gion\" and \"superstition\" -separating the literate few of Athens, Rome, or Carthage from the people of remote centers like Oea in Tripolitania or Abonuteichus in Pontus. Another hundred years pass, and gullibility is no longer a target for ridicule. In the most educated circles that the Empire has to show, enchantments, trances, and wonder-working raise no laugh; rather, fear and awe. It is rationalism, as w~ would call it, that now must defend itself; and it is easily put to rout by Constantine. Most of his listeners-not all, for such large changes come about very gradually-no doubt shared his views.39 To return, then, to our point of departure, in the contrast between the lettered elite and the broad masses of the population, and between the reli-gion of the one and the superstition of the other: it is clear that the differ-ences were sharper at the beginning of our period than at the end. It follows that a sharper objection must be raised against the use of some member of Plutarch's circle than of Constantine's, to represent the whole world of the Apologists. Elite and masses, in their views about the supernatural at work, had at the end drawn much closer to each other. What divided them still was only a matter of complexity or depth of explanation. A final sign of their approximation: by piety, that is, by a life lived in accord with divine will and laws, one could draw down upon one's whole community all sorts of blessings-wonderful happenings, or good crops and bread at low prices. \"The priestess Alexandra of Demeter Thesmo-phoros asks\" -so begins an inscription of the second century from the oracle of Apollo at Didyma. And her question follows: \"Because, since first I assumed the priesthood, the gods as never before have been visible through their attentions-and this, sometimes through the virgins and matrons, sometimes through men and boys-what means such a thing, and toward what destiny?\" The answer, though largely lost, can perhaps be recon-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 71 structed: the cause of the phenomena she asks about was the devotion of the priestess herself, here, as reported also of others in other inscriptions, at Stratonicea (for a specific miracle vouchsafed) and elsewhere.40 We can recall, too, a traveler of the period talking with a Greek shepherdess who claimed \"the power of prophecy given her by the Mother of the Gods; and all the shepherds in the region and the farmers used her for the fertility and security of their crops and ftocks.''41 Or we can compare another tourist at Atargatis's shrine, seeing the pillar saints atop their pillars, \"whom hoi polloi believe to be up there in the company of the gods, requesting benefits for the whole of Syria.\" 42 Intercessors for divine favor thus appear widespread in the eastern prov-inces-but more easily to be found in the hinterlands and periphery (Olbia, Cyrene, Caria, and the islands) thanatthecenterofthings; more venerated, too, by the ignorant and simple. It is not till the third century that the very emperors are acclaimed in open ceremonies as winning bountiful harvests for their farmers and calm seas for their sailors, by their piety. 43 The change is not abrupt, a matter of emphasis rather than of innovation; but it as-sumes in the gods accessibility to direct and specific appeal, it assumes their willingness to make their favor felt by visible tinkering in the natural world. Earlier, by contrast, when a panegyrist credited Trajan with averting famine, it was not the emperor's prayers that had brought supernatural aid, but his shrewd administration that had mobilized quite human forces. 44 3. HOW THE DIVINE WORLD WAS ENVISIONED Almost to see, or actually and with one's own eyes to see, the natural order suspended through the exertion of one's will upon the divine, or a wizard's or holy man's will, constituted only one element in superstition. The other element was accused of misrepresenting the nature rather than the reach, accessibility or sphere of the gods. It attributed to them an unpredictable malice forever to be feared and deflected through seemingly irrational acts. Plutarch wrote an essay on the subject (in Greek, deisidaemonia, \"demon terror\"), which he calls folly because it corresponds to nothing in reality. The gods in fact are kind; there is no cause for dread. Well said, the super-stitious man would have rejoined; but he himself had a better understand-ing of reality; and in that, his own mad actions and panic were actually the height of good sense.1 Only Clement of Alexandria penetrates into the implications of deisidaemonia much further, in supposing that wicked people will invent wicked, savage gods, just as benevolent people invent the reverse. The result, a superstitious dread of gods who should indeed be"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"74 Debatable feared, is logical-\"reasonable,\" as he says. Normally, \"superstition\" is used by ancient writers simply to indicate religious beliefs they do not share, without their bothering to justify the pejorative term. Justification must be guessed, and usually can be guessed, by drawing in to the judgment quite familiar ethical or esthetic standards: temple prostitution or castra-tion to serve the god better was \"superstition,\" and so was rolling about in the mud or shrieking and dancing in public. Needless to say, condemnation of actual, existing cult practices arises in the library or school, among observers of a certain education and fastidi-ousness. They are the same on whose experiences it is common to draw for a picture of religiosity in its various degrees and levels. They appear to have their own forms of engagement, however, and their own forms of detach-ment, just as the masses demonstrate their own loud blasphemy, contra-dicted by unconditional zeal. Of the one, quite tiny, circle, Plutarch is a good member to advance our discussion further. He wrote at the outset of the time. span here chosen for examination, and from the geographical center, near Delphi. His connec-tions with the Roman as well as the more obvious Greek population have been noted once before. When we glance through his essays in search of his view on the true nature of divinity, to be contrasted with superstitious views, we find him repeatedly insisting on goodness as its essential charac-teristic: goodness in the sense of active beneficence as well as inactive virtue. Divinity can never be the cause of ill. We must trust what is \"suitable, reasonable, and likely\" on this score, not what the poets have written. The gods cannot have engaged in violent quarrels-such opinions are \"neither sound nor true\" -against each other or against or for men. They cannot have suffered wounds from men, as Homer relates, or dismemberment or other mishaps, as Dionysiacs or Egyptians believe, according to myths both \"barbarous and unlawful.\" They cannot be imagined lowering or dimin-ishing themselves by too direct involvement in human affairs. To suppose otherwise would be \"naive and childish,\" disrespectful to the greatness of divine goodness, arete.2 And Plutarch scatters in his writings a good many normative words, showing that he had very clear ideas about the nature of the divine, even if he does not happen to spell out some of the (to us) most interesting ones. No doubt he supposed they needed no explanation. His contemporary, Dio Chrysostom, and (born about when these two died) Lucian and his generation, can be used to amplify Plutarch's testi-mony. The divine, says Dio Chrysostom, is goodness complete and the source of all that is good in our lives: good esthetically, that is, glorious to look at, and glorious ethically, for our contemplation. As such, gods can"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 75 delight in gifts only from mortals resembling themselves, the just and good, though their delight implies no satisfaction of a need. Divinity of course stands in want of nothing, not even of statues or burnt offerings.' Indeed not, Lucian agrees. It is impious to imagine the gods being bought or swayed by men; and yetthe contrary view, thatthey care nought for men, is equally wrong. The key to the dilemma is not to portray them too much like men, as the poets do; by whom they are even lowered to physical ugli-ness or menial employ, like Hephaestus, all sooty and \"always in the fire, by his trade\"; crucified, like Prometheus; physically restrained in shackles or wounded in combat; caught up in emotions, in love; or melted down, in idols. In Egypt, they assumed the shape of monkeys, birds, and crocodiles! • All such pictures of the immortals do them violence, by setting them in postures or acts which would be condemned as weak or wicked if they were human. Lucian and others do not see the difficulty in applying two standards, one anthropomorphizing, the other, more abstract, whereby the gods must be everything that is best in man-handsome, benevolent, high-minded, and so forth-but also what is best in creatures of some other, higher species altogether. That difficulty arose from the conftation of long-established criticisms by Plato, Xenophanes, and others of the past, whose views could not be made to fit together logically. Making a cast beyond these obvious authors, for beliefs scattered more sparsely but more widely among others of the second and third centuries, we catch some fragments of the Pseudo-Apuleius, the Pseudo-Aristotle, Iamblichus, Porphyry, and others; also of Apologists. In part, at least, the latter spoke to pagans, therefore intended to anticipate and withstand their criticism. It needs no demonstration, of course, that Christians were wholly of the world around them-of what other can they be supposed?-and drew in its everyday assumptions with their very breath; that those among them who engaged in debate with pagans had had the same schooling, beneath or in step with the catechetical; and that in such debate they could best hope to win by anchoring their assertions to points of common con-viction. Hence their free characterizing of beliefs as ''absurd,'' ''irrational,'' \"folly,\" \"incredible,\" \"outrageous,\" and the like, without need of refuta-tion step by step. All parties shared the same preconceptions. Accordingly we have for illustration two men who never saw each other (conveniently, they straddle the midpoint of our period), Celsus and Origen, the former at one point summing up some arguments of Christians in order to answer them, while Origen the Christian quotes. that passage itself in order to supply the surrebutter.5"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"76 Debatable It is \"not reasonable\" to consider idols as gods, when they have been manufactured by men, and, worse, by men of low social status and morals; and the point was long ago made by a pagan Heraclitus (of the first cen-tury), so says the pagan Celsus-it was no invention of higher-minded Christians. Celsus is indeed right in bringing out how much derisory or outraged criticism of current cult practices, theology, and mythology could be found in pagan writers. Here it is aimed at implications that gods are the mere creatures of men. And to continue the survey of divinity as it is portrayed in these less obvious sources: gods or divinity can do no ill, being goodness perfect and complete.6 That, like all the points now to be summarized, has also been found or implied in Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom, and Lucian. Further, the gods are infinitely remote from the material world, themselves incorporeal and insubstantial. 7 To imagine that they have any need of the world would imply some incompleteness in them; rather, it is of the essence of divinity to have no desire, no wish, no lack or feeling at all.B It follows that the gods cannot change, assume other shapes, grow up or grow old. Assuredly they cannot die and be reborn, like Osiris. They cannot be cut up, wounded, put in chains, tossed out of Olympus, crippled; nor have they appetites. They do not eat or drink, defecate, or fornicate. Of course not. Rejection of such pictures is registered or implied in the writ-ings of Plutarch and Lucian but also of Heraclitus and Celsus. 9 And no one may rightly accuse the gods of adultery, sodomy, theft, perjury, cowardice, murder, or wicked or disgraceful acts of that sort-again, features of belief shocking to pagans and highly convenient to Christians.10 The gods should never be thought of or portrayed as dependent, servile, or menial. The opposite is the truth.11 Still less should they ever be described as monsters of any sort, misshapen, abnormal, or even as animals: Egyptian crocodiles and so forth.12 From conceptualizations, the higher criticism turned to visible routines of worship to make its point. Idols that were in the first place sawn, glued, nailed, and filed could hardly be divine. The materials of their manufacture were base, and they endured the birds that shit on them and mice that nested in them.18 It was equally misguided, if the gods were conceived aright, to suppose that they could \"taste good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke,\" or respond-still more wicked folly-to human sacrifice.14 Of all the danc-ing, singing, miming, or recitation of prose hymns; of all the anointing, bathing, wreathing, robing, and parading about of images; of all the toast-ing, holocausts, and cheerful tables; of ivory, gold, sublime skills in painting and carving-really nothing remained that held the faintest interest for"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"J.

Certainly not in the sense or shapes that Homer meant, certainly not in the Dionysiac's or Isiac's demented terms-not if the pagan purists were to be believed. The gods really lived; but at a great remove. Cult could not reach them. It might be inoffensive, never persuasive. Mythology, not only as the poets had written it but as the Phrygians embraced Cybele in it, or the Syrians, Atargatis, was folly or insult to the true beings above. The sacred had lost its story when its enlightened critics finished with it. But who cared? The inappropriateness of common forms of worship, seen through the eyes of Seneca or Porphyry, appears not to have deterred a single soul from the inheritance of his tribe. If anyone listened to Epi-cureans or Stoics, no signs attest to his conversion. Which is not to deny that conversions may have been made-let us say, must have been made-but not in numbers at all detectable. The same limits perhaps circumscribed the Apologists. There is no knowing what effect if any they achieved, when they attacked religious customs of their time-idolatry, for instance, or burnt offerings. Had they managed to find many readers for the kinds of arguments and conclusions that have been summarized in the preceding pages, surely Tertullian, at the outset of his Soul's Testimony, need not have deplored the fact that \"no one turns to our literature who is not already Christian.'' And surely, too, we would expect some sign of the higher criticism to show in the corpus of surviving inscriptions and papyri. It is there-barely: the one oracle issued by Apollo from Claros, speaking of the hereafter and recorded on stone; from Egypt, the one fragment of Pseudo-Plutarch's otherwise lost Placita philosophorum. Otherwise, of Plutarch, Philode-mus, the Pseudo-Aristotle, Lucian, Sextus Empiricus, Celsus, Porphyry, and all the Apologists from whose collective testimony the foregoing views about the nature of god have been reassembled, there exists not a word, not a scrap of papyrus-against some hundreds for Homer alone.15 One prov-ince, and the survival of evidence by chance (unless chance is rather an element to be desired, in this sort of testing), should not be allowed to stand for all the Empire. But what is there better? And besides, why should any-one expect a broader audience for what we might call analytical theology? No, the literature of religion par excellence was hymns, in every century (above, pp. 15£.); and hymns present a world of ideas quite cut off from the higher criticism.

Menander the rhetor in the third century, describing how to write prose hymns suitable to whatsoever deity, calls attention to one useful device: the discovery of ainigmata, riddles. He means a sort of decoding, whereby the speaker detects, or pre-tends to detect but actually invents, hidden intents in traditional material. By this trick everything can be spruced up: the older hymns and rites, now outmoded; cult objects at initiations that offend prudery or common sense; local images and lore; stories of deities that tell too much or too little.16 In the same century, Porphyry takes up a stretch of an Orphic hymn for illus-tration: Zeus, as commonly portrayed, \"is seated, the firm seat of his power being shown through riddle (dtvtn6~evo~). for his upper parts are un-clothed because he is visible through his thoughts and in the celestial por-tions of the universe, but the parts to the fore are covered because he is invisible among the things hidden below.\" And Menander again interprets Apollo as the Sun, Hera as the air, because of the resemblance of her name to the word in Greek. Rather elementary examples.17 The stories of Kronos eating his young bewildered and revolted anyone who stopped to think of them; but they could suggest cryptically that mind turns in upon itself. So says Sallust the philosopher. Pausanias worried about them, too, but \"grew to hold a more thoughtful view of them. In olden times those Greeks who were considered wise spoke in riddles, not straigln out. Accordingly, it is my supposition that these legends about Kronos are a piece of Greek wis-dom.\" 18 Reinterpretation had a long history before the period of our study. The art found favor among Jews and Christians as well as pagans. Seneca thought it nonsense, Dio Chrysostom scorned its exculpations of Homer; but their respective contemporaries Cornutus and Plutarch made frequent, reverential use of it in defense of existing religion-even Egyptian.19 The tearing apart of Osiris could be understood in a new and most unobvious light; so also the same fate suffered by Dionysus; and passageti in Homer and Hesiod could be enriched with marginal commentary pointing out, for example, the former's confirmation of Empedocles.2° Most practitioners of reinterpretation felt or appealed to a loving awe, an automatic veneration for everything in the distant past, feelings that were emphasized earlier. It was too much to throw out one's heritage, Iliad, Theogony, and all, only because of the parts at odds with a university edu-cation.

How the Divine World Was Envisioned 79 the end, however, until Porphyry, interpreters either said explicitly that what was drawn out by unriddling should be kept from ordinary folk; or, Porphyry included, they proposed ideas of a sort that few people could have understood. Everyone venerated antiquity, no doubt; but by no means everybody thought its lore required to be rewritten. Where enlightenment crossed antiquity, the two could be realigned to fit well enough with each other. That, beyond allegorical interpretation, pro-vided another way of tolerating both one's religious heritage and the ideas most in fashion among intellectuals. By realignment, the old systems of belief were made parallel but subordinate to the new, as intermediaries between man and the \"real\" god(s). Plato had seen the possibilities in this, his followers developed his thought, and from Middle Platonism it passed into common currency within that tiny circle who read philosophy at all. They believed in \"de-mon\" intermediaries,21 to which could be attributed everything gross, wicked, bizarre, or irrational. To higher planes could be attributed passion-less perfection, sedate entirety, and remoteness above everything material. According to various thinkers, there were more or fewer planes: of demons alone, beneath the divine, three kinds, so said Plutarch, Apuleius, and Plotinus; two kinds, higher and lower, according to Celsus; several gradations not all called demons by Iamblichus, including \"angels\" and \"rulers\"; or spheres above spheres at unimaginable distances from earth, each with its special denizens. Seven was a favored number for such regions; but there might be ten; or, if one thought about it-better, in Dr. Johnson's phrase, \"if one abandoned one's mind to it\" -there might be 365. Encoun-tering Gnostic systems, on the I una tic fringe of such speculation, Irenaeus, Clement, and Hippolytus gave hundreds of pages to their destruction, repeatedly in their attacks characterizing their adversaries as quite mad-Irenaeus at one point hanging on to his own sanity, the reader feels, only by giving way to a choice parody of the wilder flights of Valentiniaqism . .22 \"Mushroom growths,\" he calls the Gnostic systems elsewhere ( 1.29.1 ). They were as sudden in their appearing as they were light, and quite as perishable. But demons were something else again: very deeply rooted in paganism, western as well as eastern, even if much more easily documented in the latter. First, the word itself.

But the fact emerges less clearly from the vocabulary in ordinary use than from people's mental picture of the divine order. It is often revealed. By far the most usual outline is a regal one: there is a king god, Zeus, from Homer on; there is a queen, or rather, two at least: Isis and Juno regularly receive that title; and Men, Osiris, Attis, and Helios are occasionally called king, too.24 These are all eastern, perhaps not by coincidence.

The imagery is sometimes drawn out into armies, com-manders, prefects, governors, and messengers around the throne.2s Such were the agents which had to be assumed in order to bring divinity into touch with the material world or, more crudely conceived, into control of countless subjects and responsibilities. Because the divine could will no evil, theorists supposed that demons served as instruments of vengeance and punishment; likewise as instru-ments for the dirty or menial business of magic, and for the mechanical business of providing signs and oracles. It need not be Apollo in person who spoke at Delphi.29 Demons were assigned specific spheres of activity-oversight of animals, delivery of men's prayers to higher authorities, con-trol over mortal events or natural processes 5°-and specific cities or tribes of men. 51 The pagan and Christian pictures of divine administration were identical, however different in origin; both could have accepted what the emperor Julian later said in his oration against the \"Galilaeans\" ( 143A-B), that \"over each nation is a national god, with an angel acting as his agent, and a demon, and a 'hero,' and a peculiar type of servant-powers and sub-ordinates.\" The titles he chose would have aroused some disagreement; the authority of the Psalms and Plato'sLawsmighthave been matched against each other-always supposing that the hierarchy had been worked out at all in the minds of disputants on either side, even by those (both Christian and pagan in both eastern and western provinces) to whom the thought of minor beings in action was quite familiar and in whom their names had always produced a shiver. Not everyone had taken the time to arrange his ideas in any logical shape. But there would have been no dispute that such powers did exist. \"Spirits,\" or however they might be termed, could be found everywhere. Evidence is more abundant than might be expected, considering that it must be found in the realm of the shadowy, the shameful, the illegal, and the illiterate. Everyone believed. But since belief procured no major benefits -those lay in the gift of the gods-it attracted no priesthood or other control. Instead, there was a great deal of free borrowing, extemporizing and invention by ignorant votaries.

How the Divine World Was Envisioned SJ of the dead and dying religions of the whole ancient world,\" while no doubt a trifle dramatic, conveys the right impression.s2 Magic without doctrine; devils ·without priests; prayers unintelligible; worship homeless; and ignominious realms of rule over a single house, a single field, cow, racehorse, gladiator, rival in love or adversary to one's career or party-all, together, constituted the broad underpart of the world above this one, the part with which mortals felt themselves to be most directly in contact. Further above reigned beings of grander dimensions, still confined, however, in their authority to one village, town, or city; next, a smaller number of what Christian writers call \"Great-Demons,\" all one word, like Apollo or Mars. But did the logic of this structure culminate, as it ought to have done, in one supreme being at the highest, the most remote point, in the universe? The answer is yes, in the minds of some; almost, for more; no, for the vast majority. It was a question requiring more thought than most people were inclined to give to the relations, not between mortals and immortals, but among the latter by themselves. Moreover, to describe Jupiter as prince of gods or as \"saving your ancestral gods from every destruction,\" in public documents,ss was to imply a subordination not very flattering to the inferior. To accept it diminished them and denied ancestral worship. How univer· sally such disrespect was condemned has been emphasized in earlier pages (above, pp. 2-3). Perhaps that was the reason, then, why testimonies just now cited, which assume some gods to be subordinate to others, cannot be easily found before the very end of our period. By that time, the Roman Empire here beneath had had some centuries in which to suggest itself as a model for the Empire above. That the human should supply a way of being conceived to the divine has been shown to be quite natural. In the second century, Apuleius writes with real anger about a character in his novel, a baker's wife, \"enemy to faith, foe to modesty, who spurned and kicked aside the divine powers of sure religion, and substituted for a true religion the audacious imagining and invented rites of a god whom she proclaimed the only one\"; while, in the earlier third century at Rome, when a worshiper set up an inscription to \"One Zeus, Sarapis, Helios, maker of the universe, invincible,\" someone else came along and substi· tuted the name \"Mithra\" for \"Sarapis\" 54-two indications that too high a claim for one god gave offense to the worshipers of others. That sort of intolerant behavior in paganism was extremely rare. Indeed, the illustration from Apuleius may be unique; for the second belongs to a phenomenon which only appears to be monotheism. In reality,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"84 Debatable it is the melding of several gods into one chief: \"Zeus Helios the Great AU-God Sarapis,\" this on an altar from second-century Carthage. 55 Zeus is worshiped as Papa and Attis, all at the same time, in Bithynia; he is \"Zeus Greatest Helios Olympian, the Savior,\" in an inscription from Pergamon; \"Zeus Sarapis\" often on gems and amulets, \"Zeus Dionysus\" in Phrygia or Rome.56 More commonly still, supremacy is concentrated in the sun, natural and visible master of at least the eastern skies. So in Mithraism the sun, in hyphenation with Mithra, is the supreme deity. Inscriptions from the west-em provinces make that clear. They also call the sun \"Helios\" more often than \"Sol,\" and the dedications are disproportionately in Greek, not Latin, indicating the god's special favor among people of Greek-speaking origin. In western Asia Minor, the sun enjoys favor as a witness to men's oaths, with his all-seeing eye; but that presents him in no regal role. 57 Better, in Egypt, magical papyri invoke the sun in such terms as \"Lord god who grasps the whole, gives life to all, and rules the universe.\" ss In the Levant, the sun is most at home. In Emesa, and among Arabs generally as Aziz, he reigns uncontested; and as a god great but not supreme, like Apollo, he is worshiped in Palmyra, Baalbek, and other towns and cities.s9 A mosaic ftoor from the area (Tiberias) and from the later third or early fourth century portrays him in a characteristic pose, standing in his chariot (like Apollo), wearing the commander's cloak (the paludamentum, like the Roman emperor), holding in his left hand the orb or globe of rule (again, like the emperor), and raising his right hand in the typical gesture of benediction and mastery. 40 What was said earlier about how the heavenly powers were most often and naturally arranged in the mind's eye, tore-semble the shape of earthly powers, is well illustrated by this picture. It very much resembles also a well-known depiction of Christ in a mosaic beneath St. Peter's basilica in Rome. To examine a little further the form in which the divine world was com-monly envisioned, Roman imperial coins can be used very helpfully, since they reached and presumably did not conftict with the ideas of an enormous audience. At the beginning of our period they advertise Sun or Sun-of-the-East, Sol Oriens, in quite conventional fashion, to suggest that the region was friendly during Trajan's and Hadrian's wars. The same conventions govern portrayal of Gordian receiving the orb of sovereignty from Sol, toward the mid-third century.41 Sol as invictus, whose invincibility is as specific as the beneficent power of his raised right hand, appears on Antoni-nus Pius's coins first (and about that time, too, in inscriptions); then on Commodus's coins; and on Septimius Severus's (and at that point the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"J.

What we have tripped on here is a point at which religious and political history intersect. There is no way to keep the two distinct, despite the ob-vious fact that coins and dates and individual personalities of emperors ill suit the style of our discussion so far. At best, those implications of the junc-ture which have to do with emperor worship can be left aside. Imperial cult hardly belongs to this study; and no one supposes that the worship of the ruler himself, even where he plainly wanted to be seen as the embodiment of a god, constituted monotheism. It is supposed, however, that the sub-ordination of all deities to one, and a kind of personal equation with that one, was sought and advertised by successive emperors off and on over the course of the whole third century, until at last an orator could declare, \"Surely, Constantine, you have some secret bond with that divine mind which, delegating our care to the minor deities, thinks fit to show itself to you alone.\"4' The idea that, even over the gods (not \"demons,\" note), a greater being presided, has been encountered in earlier pages, where the pyramid of powers was described and where people's perceptions of the celestial and the terrestrial hierarchy were compared. It may seem only the last stage of a logical development that finally subordinates the many of traditional paganism to the one, Sol. To make this seem more natural, too, there are two earlier nexus of events to be added to that which ends in Constantine-two very much less impor-tant and well known, but still quite often described. In A.D. 218, Elagabalus had come to the throne. He was hereditary priest of the solar deity at Emesa, in whose favor he now took every measure he could think of to lower other deities publicly. The principal image of Caelestis-Tan it from Carthage, for example, was shipped over to pay homage in Rome. A new temple was built .there for the Sun, new festivals and ceremonies instituted, and every-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86 Debatable thing advertised on coins. \"He used to say that all gods were the servants of his own god, while terming some its chamberlains, others, its slaves, others, its servants of various sorts.\" 44 Words from a doubtful source, the Augustan His tory-but at least the picture they offer of a celestial monarchy is recog-nizable as perfectly conventional. Thew hole structure of worship vanished the moment Elagabalus died, in 222, leaving no sign it had ever been con-ceived. Its obliteration was no doubt due to the unpopularity of its author, since in the 270s Aurelian renewed the experiment, and under his hand its history can be traced long after his death, in the form of a Sun temple he built in the capital. It honored a Syrian deity, from Emesa or Palmyra (the story is con-fused); and games and priesthoods were established; and the cult announced on the currency through the most emphatic legend possible, \"Sol Master of the Roman Empire.\" 45 These reigns and their particular religious focus are often thought to support the view that \"if the solar cult had not succumbed to Christianity, ... it could well have become the permanent religion of the Mediterranean area.\" 46 The prediction, though of course meant only to indicate the general force and dimensions in the cult, seems very hard to substantiate. It ignores or it overvalues evidence, especially evidence that concerns the effi-cacy of imperial patronage. We will return to that. For the moment, how-ever, our business is only with the prevalence and depth of monotheism, of which the solar is certainly the most prominent species. And further sup-port for its claims can be sought beyond ~he actions of Elagabalus, Aurelian and Constantine, in wide if blurry statements that are scattered through the literature of the time. · One of Plutarch's friends refers casually to Apollo, \"whether he is the sun, or the Lord of the Sun and Father, and of all else beyond our seeing\"-that statement at the opening of our chosen time span; and this second from the other end, in which Firmicus Maternus glorifies \"the Sun, Best and Greatest\" (Jupiter's usual epithets), \"who holds the center of the heavens, the mind of the world, the moderator, chief of all and prince.\" Between these two speakers, Porphyry's voice is heard, too, in Neoplatonic essays which Firmicus had read.47 All three writers drew their ideas, though in no very clear or discriminating way, from Platonic and Stoic teachings. Fur-ther, Dio Chrysostom reminds his audience that \"some people say Apollo, Helios and Dionysus are all one, and so you,\" the citizens of Rhodes, \"be-lieve; and many people combine into one strength and power absolutely all the gods, so that there is no difference in honoring one or the other.\" Quite true-another commonplace that turns up in Porphyry later, but in Seneca"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 87 earlier. 48 God is one but his force, vis or MvaJ.U~, is many, expressed through the various familiar divine personalities. So a Roman says, it matters not whether you receive help from \"Lucius\" or \"Annaeus\" or \"Seneca\"; and a Greek, Plutarch, in analyzing the riddles hidden beneath the Isiac legend of \"Typhon's plot and usurpation, that is, the power of drought,\" and so on through other tales, checks himself: \"These matters, however, resemble the theology of Stoics, for whom the generative, nour-ishing spirit is Dionysus,'' etc., etc.491t appears thus to beapartofthe intel-lectual heritage of the times that god might be one; all \"gods,\" simply his will at work in various spheres of action; and the interpretive structure, as accommodating of Zeus at its center as of Sol or of any other traditional deity, no matter which. But that was all quite abstract doctrine, taught in universities. It left few signs in surviving literature-beyond the library and school, only one trace. An unknown Cornelius Labeo, a writer who is perhaps most easily dated in the earlier or mid-third century, sought interpretation of an Orphic verse: \"Zeus is One, Hades is One, Heliosis One, Dionysus is One.\" What did the poet mean? \"The authority of this line rests on an oracle of the Clarian Apollo, in which another name for the sun, too, is added, who is given among other names, in the same holy lines, that of lao. For the Clarian Apollo, upon being asked which of the gods was meant by lao, spoke as follows: 'Initiates must hold their secrets-yet know! lao is Hades in the winter, Zeus in spring, Helios in summer, and lao in autumn.' The force of this oracular saying, and the interpretation of the divinity and the name, whereby Father Liber [Dionysus] and Sol are meant by lao, Cornelius Labeo treats in his book titled On the Oracle of the Clarian Apollo.'' 50 So, like others before and after him, Labeo had asked the gods to speak for themselves. He had sought truth at the source. And if the result was more Clarian than clarity, at least it did not conflict with the wisdom passed down from the philosophers: many gods were really aspects of a single god. That finding had been brought out of the schools into the open. l But it has been seen in the open already. Dio Chrysostom in a public ora-tion at Rhodes ventured a general statement about the beliefs to be found, or assumed, in his audience. To some, he attributed monotheism. It can only have been mixed Neoplatonism and Stoicism of the sort we have dis-covered in half a dozen Greek and Latin authors already. That the orator was right to expect it among his listeners, however, even in an attenuated or confused form, can be shown out of a rhetor's handbook compiled by a certain Alexander in the second century. In describing how to eulogize a god, he distinguishes the wiser opinions, largely Platonic, from those of"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"88 Debatable hoi polloi. According to the former, \"the gods were engendered by the first god-as is also the common opinion .... And to some, god seems to be one and the same, and unites in himself the power, MvaJ.w;;, of a number of gods, as they say Helios and Apollo are the same and Selene and Artemis and Hecate are the same; and veneration is offered by all peoples or by some. For not all gods are recognized among all, but some by one people, some by another. If, however, the god happens to be universally recognized, that is the greatest praise.\" 51 And last, because later in the century than Dio Chrysostom or Alexander, this declaration by Maxim us of Tyre, rhetorician-philosopher: \"Amid all these contests internal and external, amid all con-troversy [on other questions], you will see throughout the world one uni-form rule and doctrine, that there is one god, king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of god and his coregents. The Greek says so, likewise the non-Greek.\" s2 These writers are all generalizing; all are in touch with a wide public, too, and two of them are known to have traveled around a good deal. It would be surprising if what they said could not be accommodated to the other kinds of evidence that have been gathered, so as to yield conclusions broadly applicable across the whole scene, and throughout the two cen-turies, of our survey. We must first confront the very term \"monotheism.'' Like most big words, and \"-isms\" worst of all, it is no friend to clear thought. It indicates acknowledgment of one god only. Very good. But it suggests no definition of \"god.\" That, as we have seen in our discussion of demons, was a crucial point of disagreement between the Jews and Christians, on the one hand, and most other people in the Empire, on the other. The two sides were united in perceiving a pyramid of powers above them-real powers capable of suspending the laws of nature. They were united, or at least many of their more intellectual leaders agreed, on the qualities, origin, and distribution of power( s) within the pyramid. Plato had established their common ground. Within the pyramid, however, the \"monotheists\" of our everyday defini-tion discovered the hatred or enmity of the greatest power toward all others beneath, an enmity based on a moral vision. \"Polytheists\" perceived no split within the pyramid. They could only distinguish the supreme god from others by the amount of power he possessed. If they gave him all-that is, if they adopted monotheism in its radical sense-they must take away power from every other god, thus denying or obliterating everything in the pyramid save the top. To have done so would have involved the destruction of their whole culture. That, it hardly needs to be said, could not come easily."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 89 Accordingly, pagan \"monotheism,\" though not for the reasons usually put forward, barely existed at all. The schools still taught, as they had taught for many centuries, that all the gods were but the applications of the one, or that they drew their strength only from One. So rarefied a doctrine left the gods in fact quite undisturbed and independent entities, so far as ordinary worship was concerned. It was a way of conceiving things as harmless as it was restricted in the circle of its supporters. Once outside that circle, whether Stoic or Neoplatonic, there remained only the question of what name to put to the top of the pyramid. That there should be a top was, of course, the most familiar of notions universally, reaching back to Homer, to Etruscan Jupiter, to the local ba'al of this or that Syrian city. Adherents of one or another might assert for their favorite a special eminence-not monotheism, this, but megalodemonia (to borrow a neologism from Cle-ment and Eusebius). The Great Spirit would be portrayed in perfectly friendly relations with others not quite so great; would have a special claim but no exclusive right to gestures or titles suited in strict logic only to a single supreme being-\"unconquerable\" or \"highest\"; and would defend or accept the veneration of worshipers having each his own, different Great Spirit. \"Live and let live\" -even among the jealous Tetrarchs, bowing to each other's \"supreme deity\" with perfect affability.s5 It may well have been easier to do so in those late days than earlier. Rather than indicating ascendant monotheism, \"Sol Invincible\" on so many coin issues of Maximin Daia may only have shown the popularity, almost the need for mere politeness's sake, of flattering language, used more and more routinely in addressing anyone of a higher status. The later Empire loved hyperbole. It loved shouted phrases of clarion superlatives: \"the very best!\" \"unique!\" \"savior!\", offered to the mayor or governor as enthusiastically as to the god above.s4 To call Artemis \"the greatest,\" then, so far from indi-cating a serious view of her supremacy, meant no more in later Ephesus than \"great\" had meant in St. Paul's days; to serve and acclaim a god named only \"Highest\" did not rule out the veneration of Sara pis and Apollo; and writers in both Greek and Latin routinely shifted from the singular to the plural of \"god\" in their theological discussions without the least sense of any consequences implied. Modern readers have a hard time getting used to the practice.ss · All this discussion of ours starts, it should be recalled, from the need to distinguish between the more organized, explicit theology of \"the lettered elite\" (p. 72) and that of the masses. In what structure the gods disposed themselves was a matter explained in somewhat different ways at different cultural levels."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"90 Debatable One practice hard to understand but very commonly found at all levels is polyonymy. Some triple forms have been noted: Zeus Helios Sarapis, for example. But a local goddess, Perasia in Cilicia, was addressed in inscrip-tions as \"Selene or Artemis,\" Hecate, Aphrodite or Demeter, all the same to the dedicant, who thinks to magnify her in this fashion.56 Similarly, the Mother of the Gods, Cybele, borrows or lends characteristic articles she is shown with, so as to be portrayed as Bellona or Astarte or Ma of Phrygia; or her name is simply run together with that of some other female deity. In Apuleius's novel, the hero hesitates whether the goddess who saves him is Artemis or Persephone (Proserpina), the latter called \"polyonymous\" in inscriptions (and so, sometimes, is Cybele); but he rightly settles on her being Isis. After Zeus, she was the most truly polyonymous of all gods in antiquitys7-witness what survives from the beginning of our period: hun-dreds of lines of an address to Isis (the opening and closing of the text being lost), \" ... ruler of the fleet, of many guises, Aphrodite, ... savior, ruler of all, the greatest,\" Persephone (Kore), Athena, Hestia, \"in Lycia, Leto, ... in Sinope, of many names, ... in Caria, Hecate,\" and soon, through city after city round the Empire to Italy; \"first in the festivals of the gods ... thou, of things moist, dry or cold, from which the whole is created,'' and a great deal more to the same effect, typical of the genre of extended prose hymn. ss The editors suppose the author was a priest, a likely conjecture. He evidently enjoyed a congregation patient of long sermons. That audience must have included, over a lifetime, everybody within a day's walk of the temple who felt the least interest in worship (though no doubt a few did not, even if they avoided giving offense as overt atheists). The priest through hymns thus taught a large class, one rather different from gatherings that heard professional rhetoricians. The latter, whether dependent on Alexander's or Menander's handbook or masters by them-selves, like Dio Chrysostom and Aelius Aristides, brought to their theme what higher culture could contribute: pillage from \"poets and philoso-phers.\" That was the pair to whom Apologists forever had recourse, for support or, more often, for a target (above, pp. 9f.). In discussing mono-theism as in discussing the afterlife, rhetoricians and Apologists alike spoke to a tiny minority of listeners who read Plato and commentaries, a larger minority who liked to hear about such deep subjects, but a majority who preferred their Homer uninterpreted. The different preferences and relative proportions of these groups can be sensed distinctly (above, pp. 68£. and 77). All together, however, they made up a number far smaller than those addressed by the priest. The priest taught a very simple lesson: Isis was great! He wished before"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 91 his listeners only to magnify her name. Isis was great! -or Zeus or Sara pis, Asclepius or Liber. How did he know? Clearly, because so many people said so, in one city after another all over the world. They worshiped her even under other names. To report and repeat them was a work of magnifi-cation, not theologizing. But it naturally proved more acceptable as the habit of free, peaceful travel settled on the peoples of the Empire. On a smaller scale and in the eastern areas, that had been seen in Hellenistic times; now, more noticeably, in Roman times. Given the pilgrims, traders, tourists and, above all, sol-diers and civil servants moved about willy-nilly from province to province, comparison of cults was inevitable; and the conclusions inevitably enriched the praises of this or that deity as being really (so worshipers believed) one and the same beneath a dozen local faces. The people of Rhodes, inquiring of an oracle, were given a little hymn to sing in which Attis was hailed as Adonis and Dionysus, both; in Africa, it was the new god Antinous, Hadrian's younger friend, who at his death was hailed as Dionysus-more correctly, as Liber and Apollo, too. 59 So perva-sive and vital and itself polymorphous was the practice of discovering one god to be another. Accordingly, illustrations have been sought in unwritten evidence as well. All sorts of bas-reliefs, coins, gems, and mosaics have reli-gious subjects. Each deity had his or her characteristic attributes-items of costume, an object held in the hand, a stance or gesture. Hence, the equiva-lent of polyonymy should be discoverable in art. As might be predicted, the earliest signs show up in the east. Mints of cities like Mylasa and Alexan-dria, even before our chosen period, jumble Zeus and Poseidon together, or Zeus, Poseidon, Ammon, and Neil us (the Nile river personified)-later fol-lowed by more and more inventions and combinations all the time. 6° Cult reliefs in a shrine of Jupiter Dolichenus on the Aventine hill in Rome combine the god with Sarapis, assign him a consort (Juno, naturally) and depict her with certain traits also of Isis.61 And from the middle Danubt region the twin Rider Gods, never named, are shown on plaques crowded with the Dioscuri, Sol, the stars, Epona (Celtic equestrian goddess), Mith-raic symbols, the tree of life with the snake coiled around it, and much else. The high point of their popularity falls near the end of the third century. 62 Generally speaking, the phenomenon of tossing together many gods or their symbols falls a little earlier, let us say, in the Severan age; but, if there is no gre~t profusion of examples before that, later times right through the fourth century supply plenty, judged against the proportions of all art surviving. It is tempting to infer from this body of evidence that the religious ideas"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"92 Debatable herein expressed were of the same sort, promiscuously eclectic, and so to use it all as proof of a loose but powerfully working syncretism. Tempting, but risky. In a period of extreme concentration of power into the hands of a Sun King or the like, European artists best pleased their patrons by frescoes crammed with figures of mythology, heroes and heroines; and to affirm the monarchy of Rome at the height of the Counter-Reformation, Bernini de-signed St. Peter's chair to show a golden mob of dozens of angels and cherubim aswirl above the throne. Art has its line, cult another. In the Rider-Gods reliefs, symbols appear to have been added just to fill space, bearing no relation to the deities honored; in the Saturn reliefs of Africa, the complex overcrowding is rightly recognized as belonging to art of the period, especially the earlier third century, whether sacred or profane; and contemporary fancy coins, Roman imperial medallions, may be used con-veniently to illustrate the style, displaying \"a strong tendency to elaborate and to introduce subsidiary figures ... for scenes of liberalitas, adventus or profectio, battle scenes, scenes of imperial sacrifice before a temple ... or historico-allegorical scenes with the emperor standing or seated in the presence of deities or personifications.'' 65 N ock cites these views in support of the argument that the later Principate was a time of widespread, easy syncretism. The coins, however, are all of secular subjects. Like the evi-dence for ideas about the afterlife in sarcophagi reliefs (see section l, n.l3), art seems to introduce more that is problematical or irrelevant than helpful to our understanding. Discussions of the phenomenon are very likely to include a favorite item, the emperor's chapel. Alexander Severus, we are told, for his private prayers set up the images of ancestors and predecessors, Christ, Abraham, Orpheus, and Apollonius of Tyana.64 The source for such a tale, the Augustan His-tory, would rather tell against it were there not so many and so universally distributed examples of many gods being gathered into a single place of worship. For illustration, take Mithraea, in which are found dedications to or images of Silvanus (Ostia), Sarapis (Rome), Venus (Bologna), Vulcan (Metz), Mercury Cissonius (Strasbourg), and Attis (Strasbourg again)-these and others by luck of preservation: for Mithraea were underground, and their collections more naturally kept together. A rarer accident informs us that Mithraic reliefs were set up in a shrine of Jupiter Dolichenus on the lower Danube; Asclepius was honored in Men's sanctuary at Antioch in Pisidia, along with various other gods; provisions were made for the cult of Artemis, Dionysus, Hecate, Zeus, and Heracles in Apollo's shrine at Claros; and in the same god's complex of buildings at Bulla Regia in Africa stood statues of Saturn, Ceres, and Minerva.65 An interesting inference may be"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"J. How the Divine World Was Envisioned 9J allowed. None of these intrusions into the sacred space of the host deity can have been made without permission of the priests in charge. Plutarch's friend Clea, herself priestess at Olympia, was also initiate in the rites of Osiris. She, then, could hardly have objected to the accommoda-tion of a second loyalty; no more the priestess of the Sun at Philippi, initiate into the mysteries of Cybele and of Dionysus. A cult association of Hercules set up a dedication to its own god in the temple of Jupiter Doli-chenus in Rome, and \"the votaries of Sarapis,\" another guild, built a meeting room for Isis and Cybele in Rome's port.66 Examples abound of ministrants of one sort or another erecting an altar or a plaque or them-selves signing some honorific inscription, in worship of a god other than the one they served. The practice can be observed without distinction of honorand, whether Roman, traditional Greek, Oriental, or Celtic; without distinction of area; and only circumscribed in time, perhaps. It may be that such actions are more often attested in the period after A.D. 150 than before. But even that is not sure. 67 These apparent betrayals of one's god were of course not only open, else never known to the present; they were divinely authorized. \"By the inter-pretation of the rites of Sol,\" a worshiper honors Liber and Libera. Obvi-ously the priest himself had overseen whatever was done; or a village honors \"Zeus Galactinos according to Apollo's command\"; a \"priest of Sol invictus saw to the dedication to holy Silvanus, from a vision\"; and so on, by direct order from Hercules or Men or Apollo.68 It can only have been priests who guided these acts, seeing in them no betrayal at all. No one but priests can have permitted the placing in the temple of Dolichenus, in Rome, of a relief that shows the god sitting next to his consort and holding busts of Sarapis and Isis: he had welcomed his friends from Egypt into his house. Priests directed that the feasts of Iarhibol and Aglibol in Palmyra should fall on the same day. 69 The accommodation, fraternal welcome, courteous referral, or punctilious deference shown in one or another part of the surviving testimony seems to an unbeliever merely the interaction of the worshipers and priests. But worshipers and priests naturally saw it as the reflection here below of relations existing in the world above. Tolerance in paganism operated at both levels, until Christianity introduced its own ideas. 7° Only then, from Constantine on, were gods to be found at war with other gods. Returning to Alexander Severus's chapel where he had assembled various holy images for worship: the collection seems to demonstrate the opposite of what is sometimes concluded from it. Not syncretism but discrete beings were on display. By real, undoubted dissolving of the images of two or"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"94 Debatable twenty gods into a single one in people's minds, and by the repeating of the process twenty or a hundred times, the teeming numbers of primordial paganism, of paganism among tribes and cities prior to the Greek and Roman conquests, had indeed been very much reduced. The solvents that brought about this reduction were still at work in Alexander Severus's day. But they had always worked in the gentlest fashion, without affecting the essential character of polytheism. In its upper reaches, as we have seen, \"monarchic\" or more abstract pressures of interpretation toward unity of worship did exist. They should not be credited with more than their actual, quite limited force and significance. 71 They did not reduce Christ, Abraham, Apollonius of Tyana, and Orpheus to a single figure in the emperor's chapel (if that ever existed); rather, Christ and Iahveh were drawn into polytheism on the latter's terms, simply as new members in an old assembly. There, awaiting fuller incorporation, for a long time they stood at the edges, in magic and folk belief. As to emperors of the period like Aurelian or Diocletian, making great show of close relations with Sol or Jove, at the most they asserted for their patrons some relative superiority, not a power sole and unique. Jove had succeeded Sol as Sol had succeeded to the position once occupied by Her-cules under Commodus, or Apollo under Augustus. Had Constantine not intervened, why should the series not have been extended further still? Or perhaps there would have been slow change. Change is a sign of vitality. 4. CONVERSION Yes, but if paganism really had retained its nature in good health through-out our period of study, why at the end were there so many scores and scores of thousands who had left it for the Church? The question recalls the aim proposed some pages back, to distinguish several broad types of theology characteristic of several types of person: Marcus Aurelius at one extreme-he may be chosen for his very long-drawn-out, choice education and for the strong element of philosophy in his faith, a consciously worked-out system of explanation-and at the other extreme, the nameless peasant giving his penny to the shepherd-cum-seer in the hills behind Olympia (above, p. 73). By drawing the necessary distinctions, some offset can be offered to the appeal felt in the former type, whose intellectuality and moral code speak to our own; whose beliefs, moreover, can be known in some detail because they have been written down and preserved for us across the ages. Marcus Aurelius in our minds stands all too easily for \"religion in the Roman Empire.\" Anything toward"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 95 the opposite extreme is observed without much sympathy or long attention by Pliny, Pausanias, or modern tourists-through-time. Historians, in con-trast, apportion their focus on the past according to the significance of people and events-that is, according to the change these wrought on other people and events around them. As there is no sign and very little likeli-hood that many were affected by theM editations, the extreme they and their author represent have correspondingly small claim on our notice. Human interest is one thing; historical, another-unless it can be shown that Marcus Aurelius in fact imposed his views on his subjects. To the structure of influence in his world we will return. Meanwhile, we have moved along the spectrum of theology from Neo· platonism and Stoicism and the higher criticism (pp. 74-77) to the con-venient theory of intermediaries, demons, and the like; then to the shape in which all supernatural beings together were thought to arrange themselves; and so to successively wider categories of evidence, hymns, inscriptions, and symbolic representations, in which successively wider categories of person dealt, to express their ideas about the divine order. Whether by plan or good luck, we arrive at last among the masses, in whom can certainly be found the kind of historical significance we are looking for. What was essential in their beliefs? The answer to that question, likewise the answer to the question why such throngs were attracted to Christianity, is the same. It may be seen in the moment of conversion. Converts sought reality, they sought truth, and the definition of what they sought can be seen in what produced a change in their allegiance. There are plenty of explicit descriptions of the moment. The heretic Marcus, active in the Rhone valley in Marcus Aurelius's reign, won recruits to his doctrines through turning water into wine, or a little into a lot. Another Marcus, two hundred or more years later, brought water to drought-parched Gaza, where \"some of the pagans, seeing what great wonders God had performed for us, now believing, opened the gate and joined our throng, shouting 'Christ only is God, He only has pre· vailed.'\" Or in Caesarea in A.D. 306, a miracle is performed \"and all the men and women acknowledge the one and only God of the Christians.\" Or in another Caesarea, this city in Pontus and a half-century earlier, the very priest of a local cult sees a miracle, and \"when this happened, the man believed in the Word, on the very instant, and leaving all, followed\" the Christian. Or further back by another half-century and in North Africa: \"the witness from your gods, then,\" says Tertullian of exorcisms, \"is what regularly produces Christians.\" Or when the governor in Egypt questioned the Christian Phileas, '\"Was Christ God?' Phileas responded, 'Yes.' Cul·"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"96 Debatable cianus said, 'What has convinced you that he was God?' Phileas responded, 'He restored sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, healed lepers and raised the dead to life, made the dumb speak, and cured the infirmities of many ... .' \" ' All but one of these passages were written by someone living at the same time as the events he described. A great many other witnesses to the same effect could be brought forward, separated from the events described by some generations but not necessarily the less to be trusted for that reason. And many extremely emphatic statements about exorcism by Christians should not be forgotten. Some have been reported, earlier. Their point in common was the simplest: announcement of supernatural powers new in the world it would be quite irrational to credit, without proof of their effi-cacy before one's own eyes. That was what produced converts. Nothing else is attested. Speaking of the votaries of Pythagoras, Iamblichus says, \"they recount these things\" (various wonders) \"to inspire belief\"; and, he adds, since none of them was within the scope of humankind, \"clearly it was necessary to accept what was told about him as belonging not to a man but to some higher being.'' By the same logic Marcus Aurelius was reduced, or raised, to his own faith: \"If anyone should ask where have you seen the gods or how have you persuaded yourself of their existence, so that you are so devout, I answer ... , from the continual proofs of their power I am convinced that they exist, and I revere them.\" And another governor, this time skeptical not of Phileas's god but of the oracle of Mopsus, submitted the oracle to a telling test; when it was passed, \"that governor was overwhelmed and made obeisance and revered Mopsus forever.''2 So pagan sources tell the same kind of stories as the Christian. The last incident about the oracle is related by Plutarch, who in another passage extends the Il.ne of logic a bit further. In weighing the merit of mortals who are accorded temples and worship, as if divine, false claimants can be picked out because \"their good fame flourished only a short time, and then, convicted of false glory and imposture, with impiety and unlaw-fulness, 'of a sudden fate, like smoke arising,' (as Empedocles had said) they flew off.'' 3 True divinity, in other words, will prove itself by its wide or long-lasting impact on the human scene. Therein lies a further test by which mere magicians and manipulators of minor, dark spirits can be dis-tinguished. The Apologists stress this as much as pagans. And still further: the divine is beneficent, as we have seen; demons alone, not gods, do evil; so if the effects of superhuman acts are bad, or somehow reward the wicked, then they have been produced by demons, whereas if they are good and benefit good men, they are really divine. 4 Finally: the divine has no needs,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 97 or different needs, compared with humankind. Its working can be judged, and its prophets known apart from frauds, through their superiority to material things. s Asceticism will mark them. At the least they will not make money out of their converts. To credit the divinity behind a name newly presented to one, a person had to discover the qualities generally thought to belong to a god. Of course. Those qualities were: a constitution and substance somehow differ-ent and above material nature; the ability to do things humans could not do; and the applying of this ability in ways helpful and desirable to wor-shipers, indeed, helpful to everyone. Individual instances of conversion (really reducing to two well known, Lucius in Apuleius's novel and Aelius Aristides) only confirm in greater psychological depth the outline of cause and effect that can be traced in scenes involving hundreds or thousands-scenes which in turn fit exactly with the outline of common views about divinity discussed in earlier pages. The fit is predictable, the process fol-lowing from the fit, ending in a new belief, likewise predictable. The in-habitants of the Apologists' world were, after all, rational beings. That does not mean only or entirely rational. Conversions might lead on to a feeling of overwhelming awe or deepest thankfulness, as we have seen; to love felt toward a deity; even to love felt from a deity-once divinity itself was proven. But we are now fairly involved with the gaining or losing of believers in one or another cult and with the types of belief that moved great numbers. In pursuing these subjects, perhaps the point to begin with is evangelizing. Aelius Aristides devotes many pages to describing persons of a certain type known to his audience and only too well known to himself. Like him-self, they spoke in public, took the title \"philosophers,\" sought out and consorted with the rich and respectable, asserted their candor and freedom of speech, and claimed to offer their wisdom to a wanting world without fee. Actually, he says, they are abusive, greedy, scheming hypocrites, and atheists into the bargain. 6 They may be put beside the eminently respectable Diogenes of Oenoanda, to suggest the wide variety of preachers on meta· physical matters; but they may also be dismissed; for clearly their relation to paganism is quite tangential, indeed hostile. More to our purpose is \"Julius Eutecnius, native of Laodicea, the ad-mired ornament of Syria .... When he addressed the Gauls,\" so says his epitaph, found at Lyon, \"persuasion flowed from his tongue. He circulated among various races, he knew many peoples and afforded training to the soul among them. He entrusted himself constantly to waves and seas, bringing to the Gauls and to the land of the West all the gifts that god"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"98 Debatable ordered the fruitful land of the East to bear-for god loved mortal man.\" And so the text trails off into fragments. It reminds the reader of Saint Irenaeus. Even the dates fit. But had Eutecnius been a Christian, surely the inscription would never have been set up in public; and had his like been found only in Christianity, in that case too he would not have been described in terms to be confused with them; so we must suppose he was a pagan of a type unusual but not unknown. 7 A parallel lies at the opening of a third-century Gnostic text, where a disciple recounts how he was dispatched by the Spirit to preach about what he had learned of god's beauty. As he preached, men assembled to hear him and, when he bade them repent, a part laughed at him, others held back, but some were persuaded and asked for deeper knowledge.s With Gnosticism, however, we approach the Judaeo-Christian tradition, in which despatch of emissaries from a central organization, and other formal aspects of missionary activity, were perfectly at home.9 The credos carried by Eutecnius and his like cannot have been within the reach of very large numbers of listeners. Besides, they lacked the ingredient seen to be essential to actual conversion: the proclamation of wonders. That figured prominently, however, in evangelizing of a different sort, centered in the oracle at Abonuteichus. The fraudulent Alexander who had settled there sent out his agents everywhere to spread the fame of the re-sponses. It was a conscious campaign.10 Eusebius, speaking in broad terms of pagans, describes how, \"among them, prophecies and oracles are con-tinually talked of, and cures and healings of all sorts of illness, and punish-ments of the impious, and of this you might see them spreading the report and inscribing stelae and crying it up in every corner of the earth.\" 11 The picture he paints is of course perfectly accurate. We have surveyed some of those stelae in the previous chapter. Posted where no one could miss them, their letters recut and repainted periodically, they testified not only to the wonderful deeds of their patron deities but to a set practice of the deities' servants: priests could naturally be expected to present the cult which they supported, and which in turn supported them, as impressively and attrac-tively as possible. They are even to be found spreading the word of their festivals by heralds, at least from the two shrines of Panamara and Lagina. But such activity represented no system of beliefs; it sought to change no one's life; and it quite took for granted, and assumed that listeners likewise took for granted, the true divinity of the god advertised. It focused rather on the attractions to be had at the shrine: healing, foreknowledge, or a feast. On the road or in the marketplace, one indeed encountered the representa-tives of Cybele or some other god-who begged, not preached.12 Of any"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 99 organized or conscious evangelizing in paganism there are very few signs indeed, though it is often alleged; of any god whose cult required or had anything ordinarily to say about evangelizing there is no sign at all. A priest in one Mithraeum in Ostia set up some cult reliefs in a second, where also he served as priest; a priest of Dionysus erected a cult building \"at his own expense, for his dearest homeland,\" Hierocaesarea; and others encouraged worshipers to adorn their shrine. That encouragement may be generally assumed, rarely proven.u A single deity, Jupiter Dolichenus, en-joyed an active and prominent priesthood. It figures in the epigraphy of the cult, in the northern and western provinces, far more often than, for ex-ample, that of Mithra in Mithraic inscriptions.141ts members throughout Pannonia joined in a common prayer for the emperor and his son appar-ently at the time of the imperial visit to the region in A.D. 202. Perhaps the prayer acknowledged the imperial funding of a temple built at Gorsium in Pannonia a few months earlier .15 In Dacia, three priests combined to erect a temple to Jupiter Dolichenus; and one later repaired a temple himsel£.16 Perhaps all of them drew on temple funds, not their own, since such funds accumulated in other cults and since (unlike some other cults) that of Jupiter Dolichenus did not draw its ministrants from the aristocracy. Most of them came from the east.17 Inscriptions occasionally show Isiac priests abroad being drawn from Egypt: one in Rome, a second in Aquileia, and other doubtful cases. The liturgy at the end of our period still required a knowledge of Egyptian. That could have been learned-or faked.18 Perhaps Mithraism, too, em-ployed some strange tongue at points in its services; the mother of Dusares was hymned in Arabic at Petra, the divine twins at Samothrace, in Locrian; and to Cybele, even in Italy, it was proper to speak only in Greek.19 But for the worship of the Sun in Dacia, the congregation of local Palmyrenes imported a priest from Greece.2o Overall, expatriate cults seem to have lost at least some of their native character within a generation or two. Which raises the question of control and uniformity. Was there in fact such a thing as Isiacism, without further qualification? Was there a Sara pis or a Saturn? Obviously not. Consider first, as a test case, Roman Jupiter. From several considerations, his was a worship most likely to have been the same wher-ever it was found: at home, closely under the hand of authority and tradi-tion; in its forms abroad, safe from the familiarity that forgets or casually corrupts. Jupiter sat enthroned atop many a hill at the edge or center of cities in Italy, Gaul, Germany, Greece, Pannonia, or Africa, in shrines called Capitolia. Therein, each year began with special prayers taken up"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"100 Debatable immediately after those offered in army camps: prima in principiis, as Tertullian says, secunda in Capitoliis.21 In Arsinoe in Egypt, the town council in A.D. 215 picked out one of its members \"for oversight of every-thing that belongs to our ancestral deity Jupiter Capitolinus,\" according to the instructions of the local bailiff of imperial properties-himself no doubt still feeling the weight of Caracalla's edict of 212. The emperor had written, \" ... I would give thanks to the immortal gods for watching over me in time of the recent unforeseen conspiracy-on which account, think-ing that I should, with pious magnificence, be able to do something com-mensurate with their greatness if I could attract to the sanctuaries of the gods .... \"22 But when, a little later, in Stratonicea, we discover one man serving simultaneously as priest of that god and of three others, we must surely doubt whether he, any more than the local nominee at Arsinoe, could have been much of an expert in his duties.23 That amounts to no more than negative guessing. Jupiter temples at least bore the right name, even correctly transliterated into Greek. A match for Capitolia can be found in the \"Vatican Hill\" at Lyon and again at Kastel near Mainz, both named after the Cybele shrine in Rome and sug-gesting dose imitation of the Roman model. 24 The tiny Almo river near Rome, in which the statue of Cybele, taken out from the city, was annually bathed, had its descendant in Milan, just as Isiacs built a Canopus at one place or another or worshipers of Apollo named local springs \"Castalian,\" at Antioch and elsewhere. 25 Duplication of such physical features can only have derived from worshipers' sense of a sort of unitary character in cult. An even dearer proof of that sense appears in the careful duplication of cult statues, sometimes attested in words expressly.26 Then there are the holy days of Cybele, observed in an unchanging calendar wherever she was recognized.27 Hymnodes of Sarapis in Rome closely followed the Egyptian calendar, and hymnodes of the emperor in Pergamon closely followed old Roman rituals.28 Lastly, when the cult of Ma of Comana in southern Cap-padocia took root to the north in Pontus, her new home was called Comana, too, and her new services \"used the same procedures in sacrifices, divine inspiration and veneration for priests.\" So Strabo reports (12.3.32), al-though he wrote a century before the period in which we are interested. These scattered details are meant to suggest the limits of uniformity, not to exhaust the evidence by any means. The use of identical hymns in shrines spread widely over the Greek-speaking regions can be demonstrated in the survival of the actual texts on stone (above, chap. 1, section 2, nn.79f.). More might be said or very plausibly conjectured about the role of those songs in fixing the character of cult across time. Or we could infer, almost"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 101 prove, the same changelessness in cults all using the rules of sacrifice in force at Diana shrines in Rome(above, chap. I, section 1, n.66). The typical attributes with which deities were portrayed-a bushel basket for a crown, a two-headed ax in the hand, wings on the feet, and so forth-remain re· markably consistent and in wide use. Enough, however, on such familiar topics. Equally diffuse but not so often discussed is the evidence for the lack of uniformity in cults. Again, a sampling suffices to show the outline of the subject. In Cicero's day, as his readers know because he took such pains to tell them, that wretch Clodius defiled himself and jeopardized the very life of Rome in no act more expressly than in attending the rites of the Bona Dea. Men in them violated tabu. But in the provinces, in our period, in· scriptions record the names of a number of male votaries. Shocking and inexplicableJ29 But no doubt the faithful of Baalbek would have been equally shocked at the alien portrayal of their ba'al in his temple (itself also quite odd) on the Aventine hill in Rome. Isiac ceremonies in the west de· parted from Alexandrine, though perhaps less than one might have pre· dicted; Dionysiac ceremonies, being not so much out in the daylight, took on a hundred forms; and the sanctuaries of Saturn, recognizably Punic in plan around Carthage at the beginning of the second century, along with recognizably native icons, had taken on an altogether different appearance by the end of the century-partly Roman, now, partly \"classical\" in a loose sense that included Hellenistic elements as well. 5° The development is not surprising. Though a distinctly regional figure, underneath his Latin name, Saturn had no one great temple serving as center, model and arbiter to his worship. So far as the evidence indicates, no one enjoyed authority more than anyone else over questions of correct liturgy, iconography or temple construction. A good deal is known about Mithraism, for a final illustration. Its cells of worshipers, like those of Dionysus, arranged themselves under a varying hierarchy; in the reverse of what happened with the Bona Dea, women slipped into a cult usually reserved to men; and the central depiction of the god and his great act, the slaying of the bull, took on a variety of postures, attributes, and connected episodes. The god himself was equated not only with Sol and Apollo but with Mercury, too, and he sheltered a great con· fusion of other gods in his shrines. 51 Other features could be added which have been found by excavators at one or a few Mithraea but not in others. \"The greater part of the people,\" said Seneca of common Roman rites, \"know not why they do what they do.\" 52 He could as well have meant lsiacism or Cybele cult, in which all sorts of conflicting episodes and inter·"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"102 Debatable pretations of the divine story circulated.33 It was not from neglect that the religious heritage had become, over the centuries, festooned with airy, blowing, trailing tales and customs. Rather the opposite: too much atten-tion. Perhaps no deity had roots into a deeper past than the Maid, Kore, Persephone-whose worshiper Damian, at the very end of the time here chosen for study, still approached an oracle in ignorance of the right term with which to address her in hymns. \"Savior,\" answered Apollo.34 And Menander the rhetor, speaking of hymns, recommends the composing of some in a fashion consciously loose and inventive, for example, in \"shap-ing some new deity, Envy, attributing to her as her veil, Jealousy, and as her sash, Contention\" -this in the third century, too, so the free-changing quality of paganism had lost none of its vitality. 35 Everything mentioned in earlier pages concerning polyonymy should be superadded at this point, everything about the various levels of understanding among believers, and everything implied in the \"national\" origin of the larger cults. The sum was confusion. No counterforce for order existed. It is, of course, conventional to talk about \"state cults.\" I cite a few illus-trations of that, above (chapter 2, section 3, n.42). Beyond that, modern accounts commonly attribute to one or another emperor the advocating or imposing of one or another cult. If such a phenomenon could really be discerned, it would present us with just the force most logical for the attain-ing of uniformity in religious beliefs. None, however, can be found. Like any city, Rome had its temples. They were supported by taxes. Local authorities administered them, and administration involved control. All this is too well known to need elaboration. It might perhaps be thought, further, that the gods in the capitol enjoyed a position defined and sup-ported throughout the empire. True, temples were built to house them out-side Italy, often involving conscious imitation, as we have seen. But imita-tion included Cybele in its embrace with Jupiter, and without any help from public funds. Plenty of examples do exist to show state monies spent in the provinces on religion, but for the benefit of local shrines whose spokesmen attracted some single imperial gift. 36 The conviction that a real power lay behind some name-Apollo, let us say-must surely have been strengthened by deference and tribute offered from the emperor himself. In that sense, imperial patronage may well have produced conversions to the worship of Apollo. The patron, however, never intended them and still less meant to define or unify Apollinian teachings. Hadrian's establishing of a new cult to honor Antinous brought the whole of his authority into play. His success was sharply limited: compliant cities built temples, individuals put up prayers, and honorific games were"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"4. Conversion JOJ staged. The games lasted; the name, however, disappeared from people's minds. Hadrian's effort, the most emphatic of several he undertook, had never struck root in the west at alJ.37 His successor, the almost motionless old Antoninus Pius, gave Cybele more place in his coins than had been usual. A special kind of sacrifice known as the taurobolium is not attested before his reign on behalf of the throne but is so afterward; and an undated law offers rewards to inhabitants of Rome's port city who, for the emperor, offer a sacrifice which is perhaps the taurobolium, according to instructions from the high priest of the goddess. These data have been assembled to show Pius instituting a formal presidency of the cult and a new rite with subsidies, not only at Rome but elsewhere. Which could all be true-or none of it. The dates necessary to fit the pieces of evidence together into one whole are either unknown or fixed only by arguments from silence. Moreover, the taurobolium for the throne can be found on inscriptions in the western provinces but not in the capital itself. The emperor's rewards seem to have stimulated no new piety.38 But, if we pause for a moment to examine the scene without preconcep-tions, we are bound to ask where the very idea of \"official\" or \"state\" cults comes from. Surely they have been attributed to the Roman world by reasoning from alien, generally modern and Christian, times. Search for them therefore proceeds with tell-tale indirection, effort, and paucity of proof. In paganism uninterpreted, at any level lower than the throne, zealots were hard to find. In court and noble circles natural to all the An-tonines, they were decidedly \"bad form.\" Why should the emperors depart ex officio from the ordinary rules of behavior? It was perfectly acceptable to favor one deity more than another. One could speak of \"Domitian's god\" (most likely Isis), meaning whichever he was known to honor specially or which especially aided him. That recogni-tion throws light on a phenomenon very common but nowhere directly explained, the adding of the epithet \"August,\" that is, \"imperial,:' to a deity.39 Perhaps the deity so described was envisioned as a face more effec-tually turned upon men's affairs and therefore worth specifying in one's prayers; perhaps only compliment and loyalty were offered to terrestrial authority. No one from the past has been good enough to tell us what he really thought he was doing when he wrote any religious message upon stone. But the entirely spontaneous turning up of \"Sarapis Augustus,\" \"Mercury Augustus,\" or \"Diana Augusta\" in dedications by private per-sons throughout the west, obviously without conceding the emperor any monopoly on these gods' attention, suggests that what was most in the dedicant's mind was not the gods' claim to extra veneration but rather their"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"104 Debatable relation to the emperor. As the other side to that same fact, the emperor himself could announce the relation without trying to impose it on others ex officio. He differed from his subjects only in his responsibility to see that the gods received enough thanks and respect to win their favor for the realm. That is more or less what Caracalla said in his edict of A.D. 212 (above, p. 100); and it was in defiance of that that his cousin Elagabalus, the zealot, wrought his own destruction. Though the whole family of the Severi have been portrayed as \"Orien-talizers,\" there is no evidence that any but the mad boy Elagabalus wanted or tried to change anyone's religion.4o From his reign we pass to others in which Sol and Oriens were advertised or favored. The sequence of events was sketched above (pp. 84-85). Until after 312, however, there is no sign of imperial pressure for uniformity in cult. The independence, not to say license and shapelessness, of paganism had suffered no disturbance from above. No one contested the government's right, of course, to do whatever it wished in this area. The potential for interference is indicated by a number of odds and ends of administrative action. An ancient committee for over-sight of religion, the quindecimvirs in the capital, formally installed the Cybele priest of Lyon in A.D. 160, and his like, too, in Arausio in Gaul and in several Italian cities subsequently. Those were all coloniae. Perhaps other centers enjoying that legal status were similarly controlled in other provinces. 41 The priest of Hercules Augustus in Apulum in Dacia was in-stalled by the governor and other priests in Smyrna by the emperor and Roman senate.42 And government intervened, often by local request, in matters of little concern to us, but vital to temple management: the law regarding rights of inheritance by temples, adjudication of their boun-daries, scheduling of their festivals, even building of new facilities . .s Early in the second century in Bithynia, the younger Pliny planned some urban redevelopment that would have touched a Cybele sanctuary. He inquired locally what rights might exist of record in a lex dicta templo, a founding charter; but, he discovered, local customs of consecration were un-Roman. That tells us that Republican formalities were still commonly in force in Italy as the mos that Pliny expected to find abroad.44 At home, when he planned a shrine in Tifernum, he applied to the local senate for the assign-ing of the land to be consecrated and so got what he needed. To determine the fixity of beliefs gathered under the name \"Isis\" or \"Dionysus\" or \"Mercury,\" the need was seen to determine also if there existed any force in the empire at work in that direction. So our search began, it will be recalled. Thus far it has uncovered almost nothing. Having"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 105 passed over the obvious areas, in the educated elite and in the imperial administration itself, we have arrived at Tifernum in Italy. Did cities even within their own restricted boundaries seek, or manage, to control local beliefs? Though the matter has never been studied, clearly town governments in the west controlled the use and allocation of space within some limits, per-haps within the city walls. That accounts for the very common use in reli-gious inscriptions of the abbreviation l. d. d. d., \"in space given by decree of the decurions.\" 45 A fair number of inscriptions show town governments as such, and with town money, erecting a temple, idol, or dedication, most of all in Africa but occasionally in other regions. 46 Pliny mentions how the people of Hispellum in central Italy had set aside funds to build an inn and maintain a hot baths at a shrine outside the town. Money well spent: such facilities were bound to be attractive-at Scaptopara in Thrace, they were to prove dangerously so, later. But it was only hoped that tourists, pilgrims, and the idly curious would contribute a little to local markets. 47 Civic pride, an ardent wish to put one's town on the map, to advertise and embellish it, was a salient feature of Greco-Roman civilization. Everyone gloried in the god or goddess who watched over him and his fellow citizens, gloried in the size of the shrine, and loyally supported with his pocket or applause the most ruinously generous subsidizing of worship. Such feel-ings best account for the reward of membership in the Pompeian senate extended to a little six-year-old for his (that is, of course, his father's) re-building of the Isis temple after the quake of A.D. 62.48 In Narbo, the authorities collected money to pay for a particularly expensive kind of offering on behalf of the emperor-the taurobolium, quite often made by cities, not by individuals, in Gaul-and determined the type and calendar for sacrifices for the numen of the emperor. The act would be a prime illus-tration of secular authority controlling worship were it not actually a part of the imperial cult. 49 In the eastern provinces, a match for Narbo's act, but quite unconnected with emperor worship, can be found in Teos. There, the senate and people laid down the rules for the honoring of \"the god presiding over the city, Dionysus, on each day, by the priest and the ephebes,\" and so forth. The details are spelled out fully, including the matter of who pays (the god, from temple resources).50 At Ephesus, it was the Society of Elders (gerousia) that oversaw most religious concerns; elsewhere, it was usually the same bodies that are found at Teos. Use of sacred buildings for secular, public business, and vice versa; the honoring of sacred officials in secular settings, and vice versa; the prominence of the one or the other at each other's cere-"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"106 Debatable monies; the alternation of offices from sacred to secular in a given man's career; and the confusing of aims and benefits in assemblies for the gods or for civic business-all reflect the closest relations. They were nowhere plainer than in Stratonicea, where we have seen how town senators, de-liberating as such, included among their leaders the past and present in-cumbents of the chief priesthoods. 51 Implicit in such overlap was the poten-tial for interference in religion at the narrowest local level quite as much as any we have seen at the provincial or imperial level; and we may now repeat our challenge: was this control not used to produce uniformity in cult? The question may sound a little odd. How could there be anything but uniformity in the worship of Zeus of Panamara at his very shrine (or of the like deity in any sanctuary anywhere)? But the matter is not so simple. Even at the absolute roots of faith, paganism tolerated disagreement. It may be discovered up and down Syria, where a triad was worshiped, somewhat like the Capitoline, except that it consisted of a male sky god, a consort, and another male. At one town or sanctuary, however, one member of the triad would bear one name, another at another. 52 At Sidon, Byblos, and Hiera-polis, the tourist who inquired within the very walls of the shrine would be told two contradictory stories about one or another myth or feature of wor-ship; the same again in Greek centers. Sometimes dispute lay between versions of the wise and hoi polloi. Still, the wise might disagree among themselves. We have already noticed, too, that rites and beliefs changed over time: among the Arval Brethren in Rome; among Mithraists in Italy, Pannonia, and Syria; among the devout of Cybele in Italy and Gaul, or of Saturn in Carthage and the African backcountry.53 So long as paganism retained its full life, it went on growing. Even if a part of it had somehow been well unified across all the Roman empire at a given moment-which we have seen to be never the case-we might nevertheless expect the vitality of faith to have produced within that part continual disuse of old practices and introduction of new. Our expectation is met. In a sizable number of cults well enough documented for us to tell true innovations from features that are simply not earlier known to us, a general refreshing can be seen over the course of the second and third centuries. It affected the rituals associated with Demeter at Pergamon, Artemis at Ephesus, Hecate at Lagina, and the hoax at Abonuteichus.54 All these developed their own \"mysteries\" because, perhaps, that was the thing to do. It was a fashion, at least in the Greek-speaking cities. Each had to have some religious festival, too, and it would be improved or altered from time to time, at Cos, for instance, or at the rela-tively well known shrine of Zeus at Panamara. The feast days there, as we"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 107 have seen, underwent several significant, and perpetual minor, elabora-tions.55 Enough to answer the question, Was there one thing called Mithraism or Isiacism? There was not, at least not in the sense in which one can speak of any major branch of Islam or Christianity. Too much in ancient culture, quite aside from mechanical and administrative difficulties, opposed the control that would have been required to produce any sort of unitary cult. The changefulness of our subject must strike anyone who browses through the epigraphic evidence. It calls before the mind's eye, over and over again, the most striking pictures of dislocation and decay. Their match are com-mon in a literary account of second-century Greece, too: roofs fallen in, votaries departed, idols missing, the whole sanctuary tumble-down. 56 From a third approach, the archaeological, it can be seen that Olympia enjoyed its last bloom in the first half of the second century, while Epidaurus, after a thin first century, recovered popularity and attention in Hadrian;s reign. After that, it slid downhill. Inscriptions from the site come to an end in the later third century. Artemis's shrine at Ephesus in the first century likewise suffered from neglect. Staff had to be reduced, repairs put off, and the second century continued on the same level. Claros, however, enjoyed good times then and to the end of the third century, and Panamara, almost as long. If the catalogue of sites were extended, as it most easily might be, to dozens of others, the conclusion forced on the observer would be a simple one: the ups and downs in fortune of any cult had nothing to do with mis-sionary activity or (so far as anyone can demonstrate) with properly reli-gious forces. Among extraneous elements may be mentioned, and set aside, the purely art-historical, in which taste is misunderstood as faith. An instance in-spected above is the liking for Dionysiac scenes among the patrons of fancy marble sarcophagi. This developed in Italy in Hadrian's reign, favorin~ what were then antique motifs issuing from newly popular workshops.5 At the same time, in the same circles, archaizing in all sorts of things like word choice and daily manners showed itself as well in a fondness for almost forgotten ancient rites and icons and names like Juno Sospita.58 Needless to say, the vogue could only be cultivated by the upper classes. Finally, they continued in their liking for Egyptian culture, a liking which had been marked for a full half-century and which produced both the Canopus at Hadrian's villa and the Flavians' importation of obelisks to the capital. It produced also the fourteenth century B.c. statue of Atoum with hieroglyphics found in a house in Herculaneum. A rich Pompeian mer-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"108 Debatable chant who commissioned Nilotic scenes in his house and Nilotic arrange-ment of his garden was at the same time a worshiper of lsi~. Very natural-or rather, very affected. 59 The cultivating of Juno Sospita, Liber-Dionysus, and Isis distinguished the beau monde of Italy and its admirers but needs to be mentioned only because of their disproportionate prominence in the surviving evidence. The ages intervening between the present and the Roman past were of course bound to preserve the best of literature and art more carefully than the worst or mediocre. For just the same reasons, students today turn to the best, first, in trying to reconstruct that Roman past. But in defense of the resulting distortion, it must be granted that the beau monde, or their equivalent in confined settings, made people look, conferred prestige, and gave expression to their private preferences through all that money can buy. In particular, they financed religion. The contrary to testimonies of decline that can be read in Latin inscriptions or in Pausanias's Baedeker of Greece lies in the elaboration of facilities at Lagina, typifying (except in richness of detail) what can be known or guessed about any sanctuary: \"three porticoes\" erected and the record carefully kept on stone-\"three porticoes and monumental gateway and the stoa along the front of the temple toward the food market,\" and so forth (above, p. 48). Donors from the aristocracy of nearby Stratonicea thus preempt our attention; but after all, they paid for it. The appearance of ruin that Pausanias mentions-half a wall here, an unroofed building there-might be offered by a cult center rising in for-tune. Expansion or improvement had begun, but money was not flowing into it at the rate allowing its prompt completion. So at Athens the in-credibly enormous space and parts of the Zeus temple under Hadrian still awaited a finishing hand 650 years and more after they had been first con-ceived by Peisistratus. At Claros, outside of Miletus, the shrine of Apollo on an almost equal scale likewise had stood for centuries incomplete. It never did get its roof. 60 It calls to mind half-done or lopsided cathedrals in Europe. At Damascus, perhaps the biggest shrine in the ancient world still needed part of its circuit wall done in A.D. 264-265, and work on the interior bazaar in 286/287, and more work in 339/340; at Dougga in Africa, the Caelestis temple was given to the city piece by piece through the generosity of the local Gabinii (the same whose members Aulus Gabinius Datus and his son Marcus Bass us under Hadrian paid for the complex dedicated to Concord, Frugifer, and Liber Pater).61 But the special responsibility assumed by a clan or family for a shrine, and the repair or expansion or completion of it as their fortunes allowed over the generations, is familiar from Rome itself"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 109 and from a number of examples in the provinces: for Ceres, in Uchi Maius in Africa, by the Pullaeni; for Jupiter, at Iciodurum in Gaul, by the Petronii; above all, in Palmyra for Ba'al-shamin by the bene Ma'zin, for Belhammon by the bene 'Agrud, and so on. As anyone would guess, sometimes a poor man got together the cash to pay for a religious building. More often the poor, if they were to afford that, had to organize themselves in congregations. 62 On any rich man's land, if it was not he himself who put up a shrine, his permission would have to be sought-his or hers. In the Roman Campagna in the mid-second century, a consul's wife, Pompeia Agrippinilla, headed an association centered in Liber-Dionysus, whose four hundred or so devotees were overwhelmingly of Greek-speaking origin mixed with a substantial minority of Roman citizens. These latter, under Agrippinilla, supplied all the officers in the association and were all of one clan, originating generations earlier in the household of a certain friend of Pompey. Of Pompey, too, the Bacchic high priestess herself, to judge from her name, was a descendant or relative. The arrangements here recall a group encountered earlier at Samothrace, where one rich man carried the costs of worship for his dozens of dependents.6~ It is equally predictable that by far the greater part of building for cult purposes in cities, too, would be paid for by the rich. Among them, only two special categories need to be noted. One is made up of repeaters: men and occasionally women of wealth whose names recur more than once.64 There is Marcus Aurelius Decimus, former head of the noncitizen com-munity at Lambaesis and governor of Numidia, honoring \"Jove Bazosenus, ancestral god,\" plus Mithra, Minerva, Mars Pater, Fortuna Redux, Her-cules, Mercury, Aesculapius, and Salus, \"and all the gods and goddesses.\" Punctilious polytheistl-outmatching in the same town even the legate's, Cominius Cassianus's, restoration of the Septizonium, vows recorded in the Aesculapius temple, and dedication of the Capitolium, all in his one year of office, A.D. 210/211.65 The individuality of faith shows through the broader probabilities: names through classes. Simply by natural inclination, some people felt impelled to render more than conventional service to a god. They consti-tute our second special category. They might offer themselves as priests (exactly how, we rarely know). Their piety was registered, as we have seen, in the dedication of their lives or in the many testimonies they have left in one or many shrines. And when religion came under attack, it was they-in Smyrna against the Christians, similarly elsewhere for the same cause-who rallied support and directed public opinion. 66 They had their purely secular equivalents, too: persons whose actions cannot be accounted for by"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"110 Debatable position or material circumstances. Two illustrations will be enough. Marcus Valerius Maximianus, native of Pannonia, learned to honor Mithra in Poetovio, perhaps; left a dedication in Apulum in Dacia when he com-manded a legion there; and in the same rank in A.D. 183/185 in Numidia recorded the same faith again in the Lambaesis Mithraeum. Second, at Pergamon in the mid-second century, Tiberius Julius Perseus recorded his vows to Asclepius and a little later built the god a home in Utica in Africa. 67 The type of these two men may be as close as paganism gets to missionizing. Legates referred to among the instances of religious behavior incidentally draw attention to the links between military command and the advancing of some given belief. The connection extends and completes the subject of centralized evangelizing (above, pp. 103ff.). If there were such a thing as a \"state religion,\" it could be imposed on no group more under the emperor's thumb, no group better suited to be the agent of further propagation, than the army. To anticipate a longer discussion, however, there seems to be no evidence that the government saw the possibilities latent in the army for these uses. A small unit of Pafmyrene troops in a Syrian station in the A.D. 220s had and must certainly nave observed a written calendar of festivals. Suppose all units had been issued the same: then we could see to what beliefs these hundreds of thousands of men were bent by imperial management. But, first, there is no saying if there was a single calendar for the whole province, even for a whole station; second, the gods actually honored are just what one would have expected in a Roman-citizen setting two or three hundred years earlier, that is, the Capitoline Triad, Mars and Vesta (!),with a few old Italian or Roman municipal holidays; and third, the Palmyrene troop itself, off duty, worshiped its native gods and paid no attention to these others,68 which can only have seemed hoary, odd, and meaningless. Ques-tion de dieu, cela manque de realite. There is record of directions issued by Licinius about A.D. 322 to a post on the lower Danube, ordering anniversary prayers on his behalf to be offered in the camp annually to Sol. The ceremony need not have been prescribed for other camps as well. A couple of years later, Licinius's communication with an angel yielded, so he claimed, a sort of monotheistic prayer which he had his troops join in reciting before battle with Constantine. Though the text refers with exquisite ambiguity to \"the highest god,\" it might fit with Sol worship. On the other hand, Licinius was polytheist in his other poli-cies and statements. What seems to fit the facts best is a far more conscious dictation of worship to the army than had been attempted before, in form re-calling Constantine's orders to his army in 312, but in content nothing"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"4. Conversion 111 at odds with the long series of developments over the preceding half-century. From Aurelian's coinage in the 270s until almost the 320s, those develop-ments were traced earlier. 69 Quite incompatible with any theory of a mission for the army is the very profusion of acts by not quite so high commanders and by smaller assem-blies of troops. They make vows or sacrifices in shrines and cities, they build temples and appoint priests within the camps themselves-not, however, to one god or authorized pantheon but to the usual confusion of all powers: Diana and Isis, Silvanus and Mithra, Jupiter optimus maximus of true Romans, and Heliopolitanus, of Baalbek. 70 The most random and partial search uncovers dozens of inscriptions from widely scattered points in the western and northern provinces set up in commemoration of some act of religion by officers in charge of a company within a legion, a squadron of horse, or an entire regiment, on up to those commanders who were also entrusted with a province like Numidia, and so to governors of Pannonia or Noricum. Since some of the texts also indicate that the individuals were acting as such, and none indicates action ex officio, there is no reason to think that any of these testimonies represents a centralized policy. Nothing, indeed, explains where that very idea of \"state\" or \"official\" cults originates, so universally assumed in modern accounts. It rather ap-pears that persons enjoying an important rank used it in a personal way. If they were religiously inclined, they expressed their inclinations without regard to their predecessors or successors, certainly without regard to the men under them. Much as a fort commander lines them up to receive some dignitary on a junket and leads them in hoorahs without consulting their real views about their corpulent visitor, so it may be imagined Roman legionary chiefs led the praise for Jupiter or Mars. The next year, another commander would praise another god. That was one of the perquisites of power-as, in a municipal or rural setting, it was a perquisite of wealth. On a grander scale, the emperors behaved in exactly the same way. Having now examined conversion from several points of view, we can begin to see the shape of the process within pagan terms. It may in the first place be described by a number of negatives. It was not in the hands of mis-sionaries. People best described by the word existed, to be sure, but' they were oddities. It was not the charge or intent of secular government, either, though the personnel of government from the very top down certainl~ felt and freely expressed religious convictions.

Periodically, parades brought images of the gods out into the city at large, or bore them for miles around the countryside. But ordinarily initiative lay with the unconverted, to come and look and listen, or to do nothing. The visible structure of paganism cost money. From the beggars, exiles, and cripples permanently camped in temple grounds, on up to the archi-gallus of Cybele in Rome, all needed to be fed and sheltered. The shape of support naturally followed the lines of wealth distribution in society at large. Holy men and frauds alike hung about rich women;71 and every brick and block that went to make a proper residence for the deity or proper resort for pilgrims was paid for by some member of the aristocracy-paid for or occasionally voted for, out of municipal funds, or supplied by troops under the donor's command. The aristocracy of course enjoyed control over all the heights of wealth and power. In signing their names to affidavits about miracles or to the cornerstones of temples they had built, they added their titles: \"knight\" (like \"Bart.\") or \"Judge\" (praeses) or \"Colonel\" (legatus). That practice did not indicate obedience to higher or central authority. Almost the reverse: assertion of self. It was a far better proof of one's high position to act without orders. Testimonies of faith from great personages, without need of any added weight, naturally made a deep impression. Plutarch, in a passage quoted above (pp. 57-58), gives conscious expression to the pride in persuasion felt among the nobility. Not only could they present their opinions in more attractive, moving, forceful words; not only did they speak with the habit of confidence in public, elevated upon thrones, titles, platforms and inherit-ances; but the mere fact that they themselves had been won over to belief was a son of proof of divine efficacy-a miracle. By that, everyone would be persuaded. By that, beyond their wealth and influence and eloquence, the aristocracy made religion in their communities their own. 5. THE DYNAMIC CULTS This outline of the process of conversion fits well enough in the settled surroundings of a city, village, or rich man's estate. With mention of legions and colonels, however, we have touched on a special aspect of the subject: conversion operating across great distances. In religious history, the more dramatic part, in some ways also the more significant part, is the more dynamic. By what force can we explain the appearance of entirely strange faiths hundreds of miles from their homes, in areas that had not known them, especially if it is true that \"initiative lay with the unconverted?\""},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 113 In attempting an answer to that question, the last in this chapter, it is best to start with large, easy statements. First, paganism in the Greek-speaking provinces underwent no significant changes.1 Individual cult centers be-came more crowded, or deserted, or richer or poorer; but no major ones grew up or died. Even the Roman Jupiter made almost no impression on these lands.2 Second, in the Latin-speaking provinces, by far the most im-portant change was the broad establishing of the worship of Jupiter and, after that, of a fairly straightforward, representative mixture of deities out of Italy such as Cicero might have known: that is, a mixture heavily Hellen-ized, with many features equally characteristic of great eastern cities like Antioch and Alexandria; for Isis and Cybele (as Bellona) had been thor-oughly at home in the peninsula for centuries when our period of study begins. So, too, had Dionysus (as Liber). Only two new names, Jupiter of Doliche and Mithra, appear, not prominently, among the top fifteen (above, the table on p. 6). In the ascendancy of Jupiter, one reservation was noted (above, p. 5). The African provinces opposed to him their own Saturn. Jupiter alone or in the Capitoline Triad was housed in more, and more splendid, temples; but he received few prayers inscribed on stone, especially where Punic traditions were strong. Moreover, those prayers that did address him came from Roman citizens, town magistrates, officials. 5 The native preference for the native Saturn proved too strong-which does not mean that Jupiter inspired merely formal acknowledgment. In the third century and in Nu-midia, \"Jupiter Best and Greatest, of the Apennines,\" was invoked, whose home lay at ancient Iguvium in Umbria. Place names like Apenninus attached to a god point to people's lively sense of his roots and individuality. Two other deities identified in that way may be used to suggest the vitality of Italian exports to the provinces: Diana of Tifata is given a temple at Intercisa on the upper Danube in the second half of the second century, by a worshiper whose own origins can be traced back to her neighborhood in Italy, and \"Juno the Queen, of Populonia, ancestral goddess,\" is invoked in Dacia by a legionary legate of the same period. • This latter text serves also as reminder of the great tides of alien culture flowing into the lands across the Danube in the early second cen-tury. Jupiter or Diana or (we could add) another old Latin god like Silvanus seemed quite as likely to turn up on new frontiers then as in the youth of Roman conquests.5 Initially, everyone is agreed, the gods traveled only in the baggage of the strangers settling in those regions where religion had a dynamic history-virtually all of the west, as was said just above. The strangers both estab-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"114 Debatable lished themselves with their own faith and communicated it to others. Those others and their visitors can be divided into a number of obvious categories, and weight must be assigned to the two explanations for the rising of a temple or an altar, whether by act of immigrants or of converted natives. It is in terms of these divisions and considerations that the move-ment of individual cults great distances around the Empire is normally described. Each cult appealed to certain categories of persons, which it is not our business to describe-the decurions, the lower officer class, the rural poor, and so forth. But a few general traits may be brought out. Once the familiar picture of traders in motion is considered, 6 it is natural to characterize them as carriers of cults. It must certainly be assumed, and can occasionally be proved, that they held on to their beliefs wherever they went. Take for illustration the pair that identify themselves as Syrian mer-chants on a votive stone to Jupiter Dolichenus in Dacia. But such a stone explains only itself. It would go beyond both evidence and likelihood to turn the dedicants into missionaries, even though that sort of transforma-tion is very often implicit in modern accounts; sometimes explicit, for example, in explaining the substantial popularity of Isis in Italy. Isiacism was plainly not brought back by soldiers, the means whereby so many other cults had been, and were to be, dispersed. The dates and distribution of the evidence will not fit that possibility. Moreover, in the provinces, soldiers are not much seen in Isiac lists. 7 But there is a third possibility far more attractive than either traders or troops: immigrants to the peninsula brought in by force, that is, slaves and their descendants. For the sake of focus, we may instance the Isis temple in Pompeii, pre-dating 80 B.c. Who knelt there? But the answer imposes itself from a familiar statistic: at the time, a third of the population in Italy was slaves, of whom in turn the great majority came from eastern conquests and purchases and of whom there was a far higher than average concentration in Campania. Isis had watched over them all at birth and again when they took passage to the west with their captors. Over the years, some got money. Their descendants would be freed, and prosper. Yet even so, lsiacism in the town remained mainly the choice of the servile and freedman elements. 8 In Campania generally, as in Apulia and Etruria, three-quarters of the dedi-cants in inscriptions to Isis are slave or freed, during the span of the Empire; elsewhere, three-fifths, in Rome or Venetia or Sicily. The same material that underlies these statistics and conclusions can be approached from another direction-yielding the same results. Isiacs ap-pear in somewhat more than three hundred inscriptions from Italy. Nearly half of their names (43 percent) betray non-Italian origin. As we would pre-"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 115 diet, there are differences according to locale, the percentage dropping lower in the countryside and where Isis had been longest settled. There, her worshipers included some natives as well as immigrants who passed as natives through marriage or other means. By contrast, newcomers clustered in ports. That explains why, in Latium excluding Rome, 85 percent of the non-Italian Isiacs are found in Ostia; in all of Venetia, more than 70 percent in Aquileia. 9 The true percentages perhaps were higher still, for the reason just mentioned: non-Italian women married to natives, and their descend-ants, might well appear as natives on the surface and so be wrongly counted, even while holding fast to their ancestral faith. Isis evidently inspired fully as much loyalty as any other god, but nothing suggests that she counted much on new recruits. Such broad conclusions can only be derived from epigraphic evidence.

And we can determine a high point in the fortunes of Isis in the whole Latin west: under Caracalla. Thereafter, a sharp decline.10 So it would appear. But the evidence can be pressed too far. In actual fact, inscriptions of every sort in the Roman Empire overall trace exactly the same line. Offset by its rise and fall, the lines of freeborn Isiacs and of the cult's history as a whole flatten out completely. In the early 1900s, Jules Toutain, the first to make good use of inscrip-tions for the study of religion in the western and northern Empire, con-fronted the rising high priest of \"Oriental\" cults, Franz Cumont. The point at issue between them was the historical proportions of those cults. Isiacism, Cumont had said, \"conquered new converts in every province\"; whereas Toutain believed that it remained everywhere \"an exotic cult, taking no root in provincial soil. It did not perceptibly modify the religious ideas or practices of the vast majority of the inhabitants.\" As usual, Toutain was right, Cumont wrong.11 The truth appears in the table above, p. 6; even excluding her great center of Ostia and greater, in Rome, Isis stands tall in Italy as nowhere else. In Africa, she had only two temples. One was erected in the completely Romanized enclave, Lambaesis-the camp and the neigh-boring civilian settlement. From Lambaesis come all of her inscriptions. In Gaul, though the popularity of \"Oriental\" cults has been defended recently as well as by Cumont, Isiacism counted for nothing. Her only inscription comes from the chief city, Lyon-where more than a quarter of the people whose names are preserved for us at all are Greek, that is, from the eastern provinces.12 Once more, we can explain what favor the cult did enjoy by supposing it to have been passed on within families, whose members moved about, rather than communicated to new recruits. We are very much at the mercy of our data. We know that Isis appealed especially to women, but that women rarely put their names and vows on stone. It is likely that the main part of her worshipers are hidden in silence. Other distortions may be sensed in glancing through CIL 13, the volume of the epigraphic corpus that deals with the northwest. Here are 125 dedica-tions to \"Oriental\" deities by persons whose sex can be known. Of this little group, 44 belong to the cult of Cybele, 81 to Mithra, Isis, and Dolichenus all together. Of the 81, only 1 was a woman; of the44, a majority(24). But most of the Cybele texts come from the interior of the area (35), most of the 81 from the frontier (70).

The Dynamic Cults 117 old Italian; the other gods, for soldiers; and Isis (as Toutain said) simply not very popular ,Is In a totally civilian area, Cisalpine Gaul, if we divide by sex the wor-shipers of the major fifteen deities, we expect to find large numbers of women addressing Cybele; a few, Isis. But in fact we find only one woman honoring any \"Oriental\" deity against fifty-five who honor the Greco-Roman. Men favored the exotic a little more ( 10 percent), except in the largest city, Milan.14 That is predictable. The data teach us, however, that there were different kinds of civilians according to region. If we look next at the stretch of provinces from N oricum to the Black Sea, we can confirm these various impressions.15 Here, women amount to 10 percent or fewer of worshipers of eastern deities. Their names are attached only to Isis and Cybele. We find also a marked overrepresentation of dis-tricts in which troops resided. As these latter, in Gaul and Germany, pro-vided close to half of all sorts of inscriptions, or as in the great frontier city of Mainz the epitaphs belong 88 percent to soldiers and another 5.7 percent to their kin and veterans, so in the Danubian army towns the same military types predominate-as do those towns, and their neighborhoods, over the interior. The effect is to present the preferences of the troops as if they were valid for the entire populations. Their weight has been doubly exagger-ated.l6 It hardly needs to be said that, even more than women, another category is underrepresented: that is, natives. Their names, for example, make up about 5 percent of the total in inscriptions of Moesia Superior. Another statistic can be used to draw out the meaning of that: only 4 percent of Gallic inscriptions addressed to native gods are offered by persons with nonnative names,17 The indigenolls population is far more completely hidden from us than are immigrant women, and its own beliefs are appar-ently barred, or of no interest, td the immigrants of both sexes. It seems likely that the religious history of the West resembled that of the East in its uneventfulness far more than appears on the surface. Super-ficially surveyed, the one is sated with experiment, occasionally disturbed only by innovations themselves developing along conventional lines, while the other, the Latin-speaking area, is swept by floods of new belief. In reality, however, the new turns out to be ancestral, ta patria-only dis-placed. Underneath the lsiac in Ostia is a man or woman from Alexandria or Antioch, or from a parent or grandparent originating in those cities.

It should never be forgotten that the habit and the price of an inscription, both, were needed to make a mark on the surviving record; and both were lacking among the great majority of the population. The record on which we depend almost entirely in forming general conclusions is itself sadly partial. But some conversions there were, undeniably. If the old gods were not quite driven from people's minds, at least they made room for new at the level which our information allows us to look at. And two cults in the west appear to have grown to a good size from nothing-therefore, of course, entirely through conversions-over the stretch of time here chosen for study. The first is that of Jupiter of Doliche, virtually unknown in the east, first attested in the west in the A.D. 120s, seeming to attain a peak of popularity around 200 and falling off steeply after 220 or so. The number of testimonies of one kind or another (mostly dedications) is large enough to earn a place on the Table of Fifteen and recognition from emperors. But for these signs of prominence there is a common and deceptive cause at work: an intimate association with the army. The Tetrarchs might very well salute a god so greatly venerated by the army; and the student today must make a conscious effort to resist the impression given by the epigraphic evidence. It is clear that Do lichen us, however many thousands or tens of thousands of the loyal he may have commanded in a certain sphere for a certain time, enjoyed favor defined by persons of eastern origin or army calling and did not trace so dramatic a rise as the apparent numbers suggest.1s The second cult coterminous with our period is Mithraism. In the east, a single monument of A.D. 77 from Phrygia and an inscription and city coins from Cilicia, much later, are the only traces of a cult thought by contem-poraries to be \"Persian\" (whatever that term meant to them); but early in the second century Plutarch knew of its current existence and prior preva-lence in Cilicia. He speaks of it as if it might not be familiar to his audi-ence.19 It was, in sum, then, a somewhat out-of-the-way religion whose adherents perhaps preferred not to advertise it but which was gaining notice in the second century. In the west, a poet from Naples, writing early in the A.D. 80s, mentions Mithraism. He seems to have in mind a version of an episode from Mithra's life that was later portrayed differently. About the same time (certainly before the end of the first century) Mithraic monuments show up on the Danube at Carnuntum2° and, about A.D. 100, lower down the river, and on"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 119 the Rhine and at Rome.21 From then on, the signs multiply quite rapidly all over, especially in Rome and Ostia.22 Representation of Mithraism in inscriptions is numerically similar to that of all inscriptions of every sort, throughout the west. About a third of the Mithraic dedicants are to be found in Italy; but so is nearly a third of the Corpus. A bare majority of the Italian come from Rome; but that is just the ratio within the Corpus overall. The civilian worshipers in Ostia include many (a half) with Greek names, many (more than a third) with Greek names in Rome; compared to the soldiers, their numbers are about typical in Italy (240 to 8) and in the north and east, from Raetia to the Black Sea (247 to 65)-although, in the north-west, they outnumber soldiers in an unusual way (in Gaul, 25 to 3; in Ger-many, 61 to 20).23 In chronological distribution (allowing for Mithraism's late start, so to speak), the inscriptions follow the normal curve; and in social distribution (making the same allowance), Mithraists include an unremarkable assortment of one emperor, maybe; a praetorian prefect, for certain; a good many commandants in camps and their vicinity, and other ranks as well; from civilian settings, the highly Romanized in outlandish places (soldiers and tax collectors) and the lowly un-Romanized in melting pots like Ostia.24 In excavated Ostia, there were fifteen chapels, all small affairs: they might indicate as few as 300 votaries (out of a population in that space of 25,000), or double or treble that, perhaps. Were impatient larger crowds queuing up at dawn before the still-closed gates of older gods?25 The weight of a given cult is quite impossible to guess within close limits. Taking account, however, of a possible undervaluation in the east, where its members may have been too poor to put their prayers on stone, and of overvaluation in Italy and the northern frontier zones, where epi-graphic habits certainly favored them very greatly, we shoul<t no doubt rank Mithraism among the two or three dozen better-known cults of the Empire.2& What elevates it above that in interest are two special features: first, that i t had no home, and second, that its chapels were of a design ideally suited to archaeological resurrection. Mithraism's ties with the east amount to so little that they can be denied entirely: it was rather \"created at a defined moment by some unknown reli-gious genius,\" best, in the Danube provinces. So say some scholars. 27 When it is found at Dura on the Euphrates in the third century, its presence there is explained (perhaps rightly-nobody knows) as secondary, brought by soldiers from Palmyra who had learned it in their service with legions from Europe.

For a god with no great temple anywhere, without ta patria in which to anchor loyalty, without a city or a people to proclaim his wonders, the winning of prominence across a full quarter of the empire was quite remarkable. The nearest parallel, but a mortal one bounded, or almost bounded, by the life of a single \"religious genius,\" was the oracle of Glycon and his prophet Alexander. By artistic combination of Pythagoreanism, Asclepius myths, superstitious regard for snakes, old hymns, boys' choirs, Homer and Moon worship (or lunacy, our unpersuaded informant Lucian would have said), the religious practices and habits of thought prevailing in the north-east quadrant of the ancient world were formed into a brand new, artificial whole. It even had its own \"mysteries.\" That feature, in several older cults in Greece and Asia Minor, took on broadly similar shapes through mutual imitation (above, chapter2, section 1, n.20, andsection4, n.54). The genius of Alexander of Abonuteichus consisted in sensing this and so much else that was common in paganism across the eastern provinces. So in the western, veneration for the east (Egypt being good but lands beyond Euphrates better still to lead one to new heights of sacred lore) was widespread. Further, everyone could expect some sort of more or less con-sciously reverent meal together, whatever the name of the deity presiding. And there should be ranks of leadership-that Mithraism had-and ranks of initiates-which Mithraism had, too. For the more curious seekers, there should be complicated doctrines about the return of the soul to its distant home, perhaps explained in hymns accompanying Mithraic services.28 The west had its ways, a little different from those of the east-less wordy, less sunny. Mithraism summed them all up with almost commercial intuition. In the first decades of the second century, it demonstrated an ability to make converts throughout the very mixed Italian (and Italian export) population, in a degree most unusual. The cult (to repeat) had no launch-ing point, no center from which to begin a larger life-as once Bendis or Cybele had begun. The puzzle posed by a dynamic faith that came from nowhere has been often addressed. No solution has won general acceptance. To touch on some of the suggested interpretations serves as a review also of major religious trends, at least as they have been commonly perceived. The most ambitiously overarching explanations for the success of Mith-raism lie in the characterization of religious life in the times at large. By contemporaries, that is rarely attempted.29 Among modern authorities, the best known, Cumont, begins by sketching the decline and recession of older alternatives to Mithraism. In our period of study, \"less and less is that"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 121 sturdy health of character found that, unable to depart at length from the road, felt no need of a guide and comforter. The spreading sense of decline and frailty could be noted that follows the wanderings of the passions; the same weakness that leads to crime urged the search for absolution ... ,\" etc. etc.so For none of these thoughts does Cumont, or any adherent of the \"Spiritual-Fortitude, Spiritual-Weakening\" school of interpretation, offer any serious substantiation. The terms of description themselves are useless as too vague; useless a second time as normative according to prejudices not divulged, perhaps never examined; and useless a third time as applied to a population whose moral attributes and inner thoughts are not only almost entirely hidden from us but not even investigated through such few data as could be used. But Cumont continues: \"In the third century, the misery of the times was the cause of such great suffering ... that people sought asylum in the expec-tation of a better life.\" This argument, making of the \"Oriental\" cults in general a retreat for desperation, can be expanded backward and forward in time to account for all the manifestations and appeal associated with those cults.'1 Indeed, it must be expanded, if their popularity is rightly reflected in the only promising category of evidence available to us, inscriptions. Such a correspondence is generally assumed. The number of epigraphic testimonies begins its steep rise from the earliest Empire, up to a point a little past A.D. 200. As we have seen, however, the correspondence is illusory and the rise means nothing, because all inscriptions of every sort rise equally. Beyond that, what sense does it make to assign a single character to so long an era?-as if one were to say, \"in Italy, Switzerland, the Low Coun-tries, Britain, France, and Spain between about 1400 and 1600, people were tense and worried.\" The statement denies the very change and complexity which it is the job of historians to discover, and which indeed they never fail to reveal, wherever their sources allow them to portray events and figures of the past full-scale. As if a century, let alone two or three, could be \"an age\" -that is, a stretch of time in which just about everybody acted in signifi-cantly different ways from other human beings before and after, but with something close to a characteristic uniformity among themselves! It can only be the observer's ignorance that would make all the life of a vast area for so long a span, in the mind's eye, blur, shrink, stop. Such ignorance is the natural condition of the ancient historian, paradoxically inviting him to arrange his few scattered facts into grand patterns-the fewer, the grander.

It is, alas, only too easy to be hard; equally hard to be easy; and translation of one's ideas into simple words opens them not only to understanding but to question. The ancients themselves (above, chapter 2, section 1, n.32), of course, could sometimes see that religion helped to keep the have-nots quiet. In Mith-raism specifically, the allotting of initiates to seven degrees, and the number of initiates whose secular lives carried them through ranks, civil or mili-tary, perhaps pointed to parallels that were made attractive in worship and, from that, tolerable on the job. But was that likely to be what people wanted? When soldiers take the day off, do they freely seek out associations just like the ones they left in camp?'4 The attraction of the cult lay rather in a broad range of feelings and experiences: in roasting sacrificial hens and pork ribs on the sidewalk or somewhere above ground, with one's friends; descending into the barrel-vaulted dusk of the chapel, into the very presence of the god, for a long meal with much wine; thereafter (it may be imagined) communal chanting of a prayer, fortifying thoughts, perhaps some special verses or paean pronounced by the priest. When and how often the priest spoke of the god's gifts to men and drew worshipers in to a know ledge of the soul's necessary passage to a higher home, there to abide for all eternity, we do not know. But these were familiar parts of Mithraism. Most modern observers of the cult who discuss how it was organized assume that it had a rather hierarchical feel to it, because of the seven grades of worshiper. Actually, however, more than seven terms for grades are attested. Individual cells may have had eight or ten. Some may have had only two or three. Whether the number produced a special sense of one's place is unknown. The cult and burial society of Aesculapius and Hygia in Rome (ILS 7213) had five grades of membership, receiving portions and handouts of different sizes at their banquets. The practice recalls mention of cult festivities at which there were to be, as a novelty, no distinctions in seating (above, p. 47). A huge Bacchic association in the Campagna at Torre Nova (above, p. 109) had twenty-odd ranks and offices. Entirely non-religious associations, for example, of the builders and carpenters (fabri) in Latin-speaking lands, often provided themselves with officers bearing mili-tary titles, even the mass of the membership being termed (ILS 615) \"regu-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 125 lar privates,\" milites caligati. Odd-but the worshipers of Aesculapius and Hygia had a rank immunis borrowed from army speech. Where the variety of evidence points in so many directions and the individual pieces are so small, surely nothing certain can be said about the social or psychological meaning of a cult's organization. If it was in the promise of immortality that the secret of Mithra's appeal lay, those who had attained it were not thought to be in any hurry to take up their claim. \"Hail to the Lions, new years and many to them!\" runs the salute for those who had reached one of the higher ranks, admitting them among the full officiants. 55 It is certainly odd, too, that the Apologists make no mention of any hope of eternal life, a hope to be ridiculed and under-mined, among Mithraists. Mithraists may have seen eternity in no more sharply defined or enticing an outline than votaries of other gods (above, pp. 54ff.). The evidence, however, is hard to make sense of and very much under debate. Turning to the second feature that holds particular interest, the subter-ranean nature of most Mithraic chapels, there the most incontestable facts emerge, quite literally, from the earth: benches on which worshipers sat at services or reclined at meals; paintings that show how their officials waited on them, wearing fantastic animal masks; and various curious features of design. The vault might be decorated with painted stars whose centers held glass, to catch light and sparkle; gilt and jewels were used for the same purpose on parts of cult reliefs to be particularly noticed, with bright paint applied to the rest; a round or many-rayed hole in the vault admitted the sun and thus dramatically illuminated some chosen point or person under-neath; striking scenes were portrayed in relief and color on the two sides of a stone slab rotating so as instantly to reveal a second message to viewers; and arrangements allowed the sudden raising of a curtain from in front of such a scene.56 Altars had cut-out crescents with glass in front, to be lit from behind by lamps or candles; or they had cut-out halos or sun rays over a deity's head, or whole figures of deities cut out-in short, elaborate provi-sions for unexpected lighting effects, the more certain to impress because of the ordinary darkness of the windowless surroundings.57 In one German Mithraeum, by good luck not rusted· into nothing, excavators found a trick sword consisting of the handle and upper part of the blade, attached to a big loop of metal, ending in the continuation of the blade; so, with the loop around half his chest, an actor would appear to be transfixed by the weapon but still alive.58 That fits with other mentions or proofs of naked men, blindfolds, helmeted men, swords, graves, and corpses real or resurrected, assembled into what initiatory show, no one can say."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"126 Debatable Underground roused powerful associations: of death, necromancy, and a separate world of deities and spirits. The physical fact of darkness around you heightened expectation-and Mithraea could be very gloomy indeed. Tertullian remarks on that; the Augustan History reports \"it was the cus-tom [in Mithraic services] to do or say something for a show of terror.\" 39 All speculation concerning the doctrine taught in those services aside, all con-troversy about cult meals aside, all doubts about the Mithraic view of im-mortality disregarded, one certain thing remains: the subterranean rites were carefully designed to amaze and terrify. Of no other cult can quite the same be said. Yet of several it is known that crypts, hidden narrow passageways, gloom, and torchlight were played with to produce in initiates feelings of fear and awe. 40 Lucian describes the jugglery used by Alexander of Abonuteichus, Hippolytus knew a bookful of tricks of the same sort. There is really a lot of talk about religious deceits in writers of the time, Jewish, Christian, and pagan. We should not be sur-prised to find them employed in a widespread way in Mithraism. Added to an eclectic base of broadly acceptable cult practices, the advantage that Mithraism may have enjoyed-or rather, manifestly did enjoy-was show-manship. Which is not to deny sincerity to the priests who decided just where best to cut a nineteen-rayed aperture in the ceiling of their god's house, to let in the light, or who had a fake sword discreetly hammered out on the forge of the local smith. Sincerity and deceits may easily go together. Nor is it to deny that the symbols freely applied to a cult scene or myth scene, a fresco or relief, may have been linked in learned discourse to the astrology of the time, the theosophy, and so forth. Those were a part of the common culture of paganism. Different devices appealed to the clever clerk on the governor's staff and to the barefoot porter in Ostia who carried grain sacks on his back all day. The question raised on a previous page, \"How can the exceptional faith be explained that reaches across a hundred miles, or turns up whole prov-inces away?\" can perhaps best be answered through another question: \"What made converts?\" -converts of any sort, near or far. To that latter, the answer was seen to lie in the visible show of divinity at work (above, pp. 95-97). Thereafter, to make a richer belief, other thoughts and feelings might take over. So it all was with Mithraism-whether also of the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus, no one can tell. To repeat: these were the only cults whose power to draw in new recruits on a significant scale, at least for a time, is clearly indicated. Their success has been taken sometimes as a sign that older gods had lost their hold on people's loyalty. The \"Oriental\" were demanded by some no-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 127 longer-satisfied spiritual appetite. Their title, however, has meaning only for those who think that most of the Levant and Near East, with Egypt and parts of the Middle East tossed in, shared religious beliefs and practices sufficiently similar all to fit better together than any of them might fit with the Greco-Roman-that is, that Mithra was more like Sarapis than like Dionysus, the Syrian triad more like Isis than like the Capitoline Triad. So stated, the unity underlying the notion of \"Oriental religion\" falls apart. It is still harder to accept the decades around A.D. 300 as those in which the \"Oriental\" cults enjoyed their most pronounced ascendancy. Close before those decades, Aurelian proclaimed a special veneration of the sun; close after, both Constantine and Licinius put Sol on their coins to adver-tise their trust in him. But in between came the Tetrarchs, titled Jovian and Herculian. What could be more evenhandedly, quintessentially, conserva-tively Greco-Roman than that? Diocletian's coins most favor \"the Genius of the Roman People.\" Nothing could be more old-fashioned. But he also reduced the pantheon of his coins generally. At the end, Jupiter, Hercules, and Mars were left almost alone. Hardly a sign of paganism shrinking. The real explanation is unknown, but Antoninus Pius's coins likewise acknowl-edged only a small selection of the gods.41 For that policy of his, too, no explanation is known; from it, no weakness in paganism inferred. About the same time, the coinage of eastern cities was becoming more crowded with a larger selection of deities. Possibly the reason was esthetic.42We lack the keys to unlock these puzzling phenomena. Nevertheless, interpretation still insists that paganism was \"pressing on to its doom\" (or the like phrase). We are invited to consider the sharply diminishing number of inscriptions attesting to the active worship of Mithra himself, in the third century, to say nothing of Vesta in the capital, Saturn in North Africa, or Dolichenus in Dalmatia and Pannonia. I choose particularly striking examples of deities fading out of our sight within their very homes.43 The data, however, tell nothing about people's faith.lt is not the priest who is stilled but the stonecutter. For the last time, the reader is referred to Mrozek's frequency table (above, p. 115). Religion, like many another aspect of life, rises and falls on the quantity of surviving evi-dence like a boat on the tide. Highs and lows of attestation, if they only follow the line on the table, indicate no change at all. The tide itself-the number of pieces of data, especially written data, remaining from any decade in the first four centuries-has been noticed only very rarely and casually. The neglect is surprising, in this present era of statistics. But the dating of the pieces is problematical and the usefulness of all the necessary work not obviously apparent. After all, everybody knew"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"128 Debatable there was some approximate correspondence between the general wealth, peace and \"progress\" of the Empire, on the one hand, and the richness of documentation, on the other. Perhaps the matter is not so simple as it seems. The custom of presenting some thought or fact to one's community, living and to come, was generally unnatural, at least unnecessary. It assumed literacy. It had to be displayed to those not familiar with it and imitated; it had to be maintained at some cost by those to whom it was a part of inherited culture. Apparently both categories of person found they could do without it. Its decline in the west· ern provinces was precipitous, as we have seen; in the eastern, perceptible but never measured. In a large section of Syria, some hundreds of inscrip-tions have been found spread across our period and on through the sixth century. They show a gap almost complete over the years A.D. 250-325.44 Other kinds of written evidence elsewhere in the east also are less abundant then than fifty years earlier. The explanation that might most naturally offer itself is poverty, during the Empire's Time of Troubles. But if that were right, why, earlier, should the number of inscriptions have continued to rise past Com modus, even past the turn of the second century? By then, as everyone surely is agreed, the Empire's fortunes had long since taken a downward turn. It is not easy to understand why that section of Syria in the mid-third century, or most of Egypt some decades earlier, or Proconsular Africa for a period beginning in the A.D. 230s and Pannonia in the 220s, and so on all around the Empire-perhaps most puzzling of all, the Arval and Vestal cults, snug in Rome-should clearly start to fade out of the written record as they did, at a time when there appears to be no common factor in control of their fortunes. Not even coinage touched them all in the same way. Imperial currency did not reach into Egypt at all; and small change was imperial in the west; in the east, municipal-at least to a considerable degree. Even where both the deterioration of the currency and the fading of the written record can be noted together, unmistakable signs of prosperity may appear (just as the reverse appears earlier: general prosperity, but specific depressed regions like Greece).45 I must leave these puzzles unsolved, however, and go on to say what I think can be said. If the fortunes of the pagan record-the number of testimonies to prayer, invocation, praise, and so forth-run parallel to those of other phenomena -to writing itself, in chief-so that one cannot say those fortunes were in decline, yet nevertheless, when the worst is over and other lines begin to rise, it is not paganism that reemerges. Rather, it is Christianity. That, at least, is true in several places. 46 To which another fact should be connected."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"5. The Dynamic Cults 129 Whatever was needed to produce an inscription was more easily found among Christians than pagans. During the same worst period, the curve of epigraphic data drops down for inscriptions of some sorts more than for others: for economic indicators and economic records of municipal life or of private citizens, or for expenses generally.47 It would be hard to deny, then, that the publicity attending religion had something to do with money. The connection seems obvious. It can be confirmed. When the pagan masters of the world set about the destruction of Christianity in a thinking manner, they did so from the top down, evidently taking it for granted that only the Church's leaders counted.48 Suppose that it was the natural but wrong assumption of the ruling class, to think itself, or its like among Christians, the essence of everything; and suppose therefore that the focus of the persecutions does not prove, in paganism, the key importance of the ruling class-yet there are still other proofs. They arise almost by them-selves from the nature of paganism as it was portrayed in the first chapter, above. From that portrait, if the aristocracy and their wealth were to be removed, a very, very great deal would disappear with them. Consider a few of the consequences. It was not universal, but it was the prevalent fact, that the gods were decently housed. If possible, they should be housed magnifi-cently, exhausting the resources of local rich families over generations. Paganism, therefore, for us to recognize it in its familiar forms, required the patrons who paid for its temples. Games, exhibitions, performances, and public feasting likewise cost great sums. To offer certain sacrifices was out of the ordinary man's reach, when five months of his labor were needed to make up the price of an ox. 49 The impression of strain conveyed by these con-siderations is reinforced by recalling from earlier pages the many glimpses of shrines active but only half-built, or half in ruins. The more prominent, public features of paganism no doubt did fade out in the third century. That fact, unlike the silence that falls on record keep-ing of several sorts, allows straightforward explanation: costs of cult had come to seem too high. The sense might be challenged: \"What sort of reli-gion is it that takes money?\" asked the Apologists in derision (above, pp. 96-97). A fair question-if it is also fair to ask, What is especially good about a religion that costs nothing? Why should the hollow-cheeked St. Anthony stare down the Buddha? Eating and drinking may be a form of worship, and dancing and singing, building and painting, writing and reading. Paganism, as it existed in good times and as it was presented in my first chapter, there was no reason to reject; nor was there any general disposition to diminish pomp-not in the age that saw Rome's rebirth sanctified by the emperor Philip with incredible expenditures, nor in the age of Constan·"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"110 Debatable tine's basilicas. Only, most people who would formerly have paid the costs of festivals and temples at the local level could now, in bad times, no longer find the money. To the best-attested fifteen cults, or the best-attested thirty, if their tradi-tions had become too expensive, alternatives emerged here and there. They were drawn from the non-Greek, non-Roman substratum to be found throughout the Mediterranean lands. Its religious expression, so rich and varied, underlay a great many hyphenated names, as has been pointed out: Artemis Pergaea, Mars Segomo. Worship of such deities had continued for many centuries beneath the very feet of Greek and Roman (or even earlier, Celtic or Punic) conquerors in Asia Minor as in North Africa.'0 It consti-tuted the oldest part of living paganism-in a Darwinian sense, the fittest to survive, since it required so little nourishment. \"Higher\" forms of reli-gious life needed, and might not always find, the kind of bountiful patron-age that made brilliant the festivals of Zeus of Panamara and Hecate of Lagina. The \"lower\" unexpectedly gained somewhat in strength and prom-inence, over the whole of the third century. But with cults that are centered in cities or tribes, we return to our starting point, \"national\" gods. They were the beginning and essence of the whole resilient, living fabric of belief. For the most part, however, they lie below the reach of our inquiry, at a level of the merely local and illiterate. More-over, they were the ingredients of the Empire's culture least dissolved in the melting pot, therefore least to be described in any general statement about paganism as one whole. When political and economic conditions favorable to them settled in, as was clear by (indeed before) the end of our period of study, the point at which this study ought to end is also clear."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Epilogue THE MANNER OF DEATH OF PAGANISM Paganism as one whole is most easily seen as the patterns of thought andaction, and their attendant feelings, roused by belief in the existence of superhuman powers; such powers are most easily grouped in the mind as a structure having a narrow summit and a broad base; and such a structure most easily accommodates the known facts about it if it is conceived as changing all the time, therefore alive. The metaphor of the pyramid has been, in earlier pages, employed often enough to make it familiar, both inregard to the superhuman world with its few great and many minor beings, and in regard to its worshipers, among them, the few of the ruling andliterate classes and the many of the obscure and illiterate. The organic metaphor likewise is familiar.lt underlies phrases like \"dying paganism.\" Metaphors have their uses, also their deceits. Paganism died, agreed-like the last stegosaurus or like a coral reef? Having its origins in particular localities, its upper parts generally cor-responded with the fortunes of the natives of those localities. Athena andJupiter were great because they were the deities of conquering peoples; Artemis and Saturn guarded great cities. They inevitably preoccupy our notice. Indeed, the elaboration of their worship becomes, for us, the verycanon and definition of paganism. It is, however, in fact only the upper parts that we are looking at, and they are vulnerable to changes in fortune as the lowlier cults of less important peoples are not. For one thing, if the means by which we know them are lost to us, theythemselves will appear to have receded. The appearance may be false, but we cannot easily make correction for it. It is this difficulty that the dimin-ishing of inscriptions creates-of coins, too, and of papyri and writtenworks generally. But most inscriptions, unlike these other media, served noobvious or practical purpose. They arose from someone having somethinghe wanted to communicate to his whole world, from which in turn he ex-pected approval or esteem: approval for piety or achievement-or both, as for example in a text that might read, \"So-and-so, high magistrate, erected 131"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"JJ2 Epilogue this monument to Such-and-Such a god at his own expense, willingly.\" Much of the epigraphic record on which we depend for an estimate of paganism reflects not only what people believed but whether or not their belief was likely to raise them in others' eyes. For the same reason, then, that few Christians declared their faith during the third century, few pagans can have cared to do so, once the emperor, and with him, those who sought his favor, changed allegiance. For Constantine ushered in a new age, in which for the first time there was such a thing as a state cult-moreover, one animated at the center by that missionary motive unique to Christianity. In a number of his state· ments and in more still of his actions, he declared his intent to increase the ranks of the faithful. Contrast with the adherents of other gods needs no underlining. At the very towering peak of their appalling rage and cruelty against Christians, pagans had never sought to make converts to any cult-only away from atheism, as they saw it. Toleration gone mad, onemaysay. Such were those times, cruel and violent. Under the Tetrarchs, Church leaders in the chief eastern cities were arrested and tortured; even pagan priests and dignitaries if suspected of fraud.l Thereafter, shrines and the holy things within them were again confiscated or destroyed; leaders exiled; humble worshipers beaten up. In these incidents, pagans were now the victims. 2 Occasionally they reacted with their own violence-over the long run, unavailingly. They did not suffer at the hands of the governors' guards, as Christians had done. The army remained in the fourth century predominantly pagan -so it is safe to say, though just when the balance tipped the other way no one knows.3 A. H. M. Jones puzzles over the supine acceptance by the army of now one faith in its commander, now another, from Constantine through the 360s. There is no clear explanation; and the behavior of Arbogast's and Eugenius's soldiers extends the problem almost to the end of the century. One conclusion, however, imposes itself: soldiers somehow managed to keep their religion separate from their business, even when their business appears to us to have lain with religion. That was as true in the 390s, in Italy and the west, as it had been in the east, in the transition from Julian to Jovian to Valentinian. It suggests that emperors and commanders dared not press their views upon those of their servants who bore arms. Powerful people made their own rules. Those in Italy, even unarmed but of high station, maintained theirloyalty to the old gods quite openly. Their story has been told a hundred times. Little details add themselves continu· ally, in the form of inscriptions recording the repair of temples or the holding of priesthoods by private individuals or officials.4 So long as they"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Manner of Death of Paganism JJJ were left alone, they gave more than respectability to their faith. There is no reason to suppose theirs was not the majority party until the fifth century. Because of their family holdings and prescriptive right to governorships in the central African provinces, those latter also yield many indications of paganism respected, open and confident, throughout the fourth century;s but there were deep-rooted cults there, too, which needed no support from Italy. 6 To the north, the restoration of a long-deserted Mithra temple was adver-tised by an inscription of the period, in Virunum; but this was under Julian the Apostate, therefore perhaps an insincere act. What could be more genu-ine, what could better testify to the confidence of pagans even under a Chris-tian emperor, than the celebrations at Emona when Theodosius visited the city? There went out to meet him \"senators notable in their snow-white dress, the flamens venerable in city-purple, the priests standing out because of their peaked hats.'' 7 It was officially a pagan reception. The Danube lands suffered such destruction in the third century from barbarians and so much more, from Christian ardor, in the fourth and fifth, that idols and temples of the late Empire are hard to find in one piece. Out-side Pautalia, the sanctuary of Zeus and Hera, enclosing several temples alive and well over the fourth century, at the end received such a smashing that only two simple capitals remained intact. They were of granite. 8 Mean-while, the inscriptions of the region change under Constantine. Pagan gravestones and ex-votos are no longer set up, while Christian epitaphs and increasingly rich burials come into view. All this is best explained by imag-ining a takeover of the town senates by new converts, while humbler folk and the countryside remained little affected. In the east, the continuing prominence of paganism in Athens is well known; of Asclepius's cult, too, at various shrines.9 In Syria, in its greatest city, Antioch, the masses appear to have been Christians for a long time, by (let us say) A.D. 375; the city senators, mostly Christian; but the peasants over the country side generally a mixture, possibly half and hal£.10 In Egypt of the mid-fourth century, an army commander had plenty of Christians, including priests, who were in courteous correspondence with him; but in his headquarters' chapel an image of the goddess Nemesis presided, and his personal servant took oath by the gods, plural. Perhaps that meant nothing. A deacon of the Church toward the same date \"swears by the divine and holy Tyche of our all-conquering Lords,\" the emperors.11 Inside people's minds the most contrary beliefs might coexist, at some moment suddenly to be recognized as mutually intolerable.

Gaza, around the end of the century, illustrates how the religious forces might change their balance. Being an out-of-the-way place, it had been hardly touched by Christianity. The emperor Arcadius is imagined saying, \"I know very well that the city is full of idols. But it loyally pays its dues and contributes much [to the treasury]. If we suddenly impose a reign of terror, they will flee and we will lose all that tribute. Still, if you wish, we will squeeze them gradually, removing the dignity of their idolatries and other municipal offices.\" To that, an impatient missionary replied with more direct action, performing miracles in the town. Thereupon \"some of the pagans, seeing what great wonders God had performed, now believing ... , shouted, 'Christ only is God, He only has prevailed!'\" 12 Enough of these disconnected episodes and glimpses, picked up around the whole Empire. Since so much of the raw fact, the archaeological, epi-graphic and papyrological material, remains still unevaluated, to say noth-ing of its being assembled into broad regional surveys, there is little that can be said at this point with any confidence. Just a few broad statements may be hazarded. First, as Peter Brown has said, \"the historian of the later Roman church is in constant danger of taking the end of paganism for granted.\" u His warning gives shape and weight to all the scattering of facts just reviewed-a warning the more needed because what it warns against appears so thor-oughly reasonable. We naturally assume that such wonders as were worked at Gaza had long since had their effect in other places. It surprises us, indeed, still to find an almost wholly pagan town in the Holy L a n d in the fifth century (but there remained others in the sixth I). If wonders had not availed everywhere, it surprises us that laws against sacrifices, seizure of idols by the state, and so back through the crowded chronicles of violence to Constan-tine's own reign, should not have turned everybody Christian. But pagans survived, unterrified. To the emperor's face they shouted, \"The gods save you!\" Their priests turned out to welcome him on his journeyings. The higher reaches of his government-not only barbarian generals like Arbo-gast, but civil functionaries-were predominantly pagan before Julian as after, too-and not in remote regions but in the eastern provinces them-selves. The enormous thing called paganism, then, did not one day just topple over dead. No metaphorical description of that sort will apply, even if the process of demise is somehow stretched out over a generation past the great conversion of 312 (and more than a generation, it is not the fashion to"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Manner of Death of Paganism JJ5 suggest: Julian must be a dreamer, doomed, born out of his time, or the like). Second, distinction must be made between two elements in religion: the perceptible, meaning the activities and all that those activities imply in consequence of a person's being an open participant in some belief; and the debatable, as I have called it, meaning those feelings and thoughts that accompany a person's acknowledgment of a god; and a person may grow up into certain religious activities without ever believing, or come to be-lieve but never participate, so the priority of the one or the other element is not fixed, nor even their occurrence as a pair. It was the perceptible and its pomp and privilege enjoyed by leaders of a congregation that the emperor Arcadius thought to strike at, so as to turn them from their pagan ways; while the missionary who asked for his help aimed his efforts at another point. To force acknowledgment of their God, Christians commanded remark-able means. Tertullian had called the blood of martyrs the seed of the Church. Backhandedly, the emperor Julian had shown later that he attached the same importance to martyrdom, through what he decided not to do even more than through what he did. Surrender of one's life for one's faith was bound to work most powerfully on witnesses. It was quite beyond nature, a wonder. Along with miracles of other kinds and exorcism rou-tinely (above, pp. 95-96 and 50), it goes far to explain how thousands, not mere dozens of the uncommitted, might be induced really to look at another man's god and really to open their minds to a new reality. Indeed, if we relied only on pre-Constantinian sources, we would suppose that such supernatural acts accounted for very much the greater part of all conver-sions. There should be nothing surprising, then, in the missionary's miracles in Gaza at the turn of the fourth century. But many students of the ascendancy of the Church (being thus by impli-cation also students of the dying away of paganism) would rather erqpha-; size the importance of the social ethics, status-structure, congeniality, morat challenge, and psychological support offered to those who joined the Church.14 Perhaps it is all a matter of definition: When does the process of conversion cease and the process of living in a faith begin? Or perhaps the two elements of religion distinguished above cannot be known and sepa-rated in enough instances for us to tell which best explains the fading of pagan cults. Anyway, Arcadius had no doubts; and by his day existed, thanks to his Christian predecessors, many, many laws aimed against the prominent sort"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"116 Epilogue of pagans. They could not legally pass on their estates, they could not enter on profitable careers, their sanctuaries had been stripped of land and wealth.15 As added penalty, in the good gold solidus dispensed by Constantine and his successors to the Church, pagans could recognize the metal confiscated from the treasuries of their gods. They were financing their own destruction. And this they were made to do in a period that was, for quite secular and impersonal reasons, radically inimical to the pagan \"Establishment\"-that is, inimical to local urban magnates. Their difficulties had sharpened in the third century. By the fourth, many of them had been driven into the refuge of their villas, or into bankruptcy. In either case, they were not on hand to pay the bills for what, some pages back, were called the upper parts of paganism. Upon those upper parts our account has naturally focused, because they were the most visible in the surviving record. They were also the most fragile. Like a coral reef, to live and grow further, they required conditions favorable within quite narrow limits. When conditions changed, life and growth must end. The more substantial, older, primitive parts of the pyra-mid of beliefs, however, lying at a leve_l below the reach of our inquiry, died more slowly-just when, no record declares. From the triumph of Christianity, it is natural but not certainly right to reason backwards: Christianity in its now familiar outline, Christianity as it was \"supposed to be,\" prevailed because it was intrinsically better.lt was freely espoused by people who could see its superiority. But that view should not involve the quite crude error of supposing the now familiar out-line to have been already clear in the period of our study. In fact, of course, the Church was undergoing constant change in its early history as in its later. The marked prominence of exorcism in its outer face, and of demon-ology in the inner, faded rapidly away during the fourth century-to name two areas of development that have received mention above. Crude error avoided, there remain several further points of doubt. First, is it possible to define, almost a priori, major human wants to which answer must, or can only easily, be made through religion? So, if nothing in all the variety of paganism answered some of those wants, but Christianity did, the rise of the latter could be explained. As one illustration (pp. 53-57-but several others, I think, offer themselves from the preceding pages or have been discussed in other books): no pagan cult held out promise of afterlife for the worshiper as he knew and felt himself to be. Resurrection in the Oesh was thus a truth proclaimed to the decisive advantage of the Church. In making any such assertion, however, much care would be needed against"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Manner of Death of Paganism IJ7 attributing to the third century social and spiritual needs that were created rather than answered by Christianity. Second, is it possible to weigh the impact of two adventitious factors, the destructive political and economic forces at work upon the more prominent parts of paganism after 250 and the constructive dynamic of Constantine's reign in favor of the Church? Together, one might argue, these factors over three-quarters of a century coincided with, and were very nearly enough to account for, the great changes in the Church's fortunes. But the argument must be tested. Third, from the study and especially from the dating of pagan testimonies post-312, is it possible todeterminejusthowmuchandhowearly paganism retreated? The most casual reading in the late Empire suggests that there is plenty of material to reward inquiry on this front. Those are points that occur even to an inexpert observer. It is curious, when one stops to think about it, that the success of the Church in taking on historic proportions has never been described with much care.16"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Abbreviations Citation in the notes is abbreviated to the form \"Jones (1967) 100,\" or, where I cite two works by the same author published in the same year, I add \"a\" or \"b\" to the date.

For example, Cumont (1896-1899) 1.68f.; idem (1915)206, bones including of boars, in Roman and German Mithraea; Vermaseren ( 1956-1960) 1.185 and 2. 79 and 213. bones of birds being most common; and Bull (1978) 79, at Caesarea. 27. To the better-known evidence from the west, CIL 8.20780, l>epe (1964) 826, CIL 2.266, a tomb equipped cum munitionibus tricleae, and Gallavotti (1972) 360, add Negev ( 1971) 111 and 127-129, the practice accommodated in much of the Levant by tombside stone tables, esp. in Nabataea of the first cent. to ca.

Hinrichs (1970) 29-31 quotes from a novel in a late second-cent. copy,above, chap. 1.1 n.47; compare Dio 71.4, the Boukoloi in Egypt kill Romans \"in sacrifice and swear an oath on the entrails\"; the cult society of Priapus, worshiping his genius in his sacellum with its drunken and erotic orgies, pervigilia, in Petron., Sat. 17 and 21; also Robert ( 1943) 190, on the festivals typical of villages around N icome· dia, where \"il s'agissait essentiellement d'une beuverie.\" The poor rustics of the east find a match in those that Ovid observed, Fasti 3.541£., senem potum pota trahebat anus, or in the scene, surely meant to be familiar, of the half-drunk farmer coming from worship with his family (Tibullus 1.10.51; cf.

For secular or semisecular (that is, imperial cult) purposes, citywide parties are very amply attested in the west. For a cult feast as an exception that proves the rule, see ILS 6328, Misenum in A.D. 169, a feast offered to the city senate on the occasion of \"the all-night celebration for the ancestral god.\" Both the practice of the nawuxi~ and, probably, the deity are eastern. 34.

Matern., Math. 3.10.6, 4.10.8, and 4.14.5, constitutes a very good source to prove the substantial profits normally to be expected from serving in a temple, not only as priest but in other capacities. A. H.M. Jones (1940)228and Magie(l950) 545 and 1404 provide good discussion of sale of priesthoods and revenues therefrom, some very large.

Matern., Math. 3.4.27 and 3.8.9, and in Orig., C. Cels. 1.68. As a youth, Marcus Aurelius was taught skepticism about pagan exorcists, Medit. 1.6, but Tatian, Ad Graec. 18, had no doubts, nor the pur-chasers of home remedies, such as Cyranides 1.3.10, 18.25 de Mely. 4.

Lact., Div. inst. 5.20, with an echo in Tert., De spect. 25.102. Lactantius emphasizes his case by joining a brigand to the gladiator, and a poisoner, etc. But such criminals could only invoke demons, as he well knew. Similarly, Tertullian rebukes the admiration of scaenici, De spect. 22.101; but open inquiry of Apollo may be made by an acrobat about his upcoming performance, c£.

Dubois (1902) 27, on \"a renascence of Dionysiac mysteries in Italy.\" But the evidence does not exist: Dio 76.16 (no word of mysteries), cult colleges at Ostia ( CIL 14.4, the date too early by nearly a century) and at Rome (CIL 6.641, no word of mysteries). Charles-Picard (1954) 203-205 detects the same renascence, based on sar-cophagi reliefs, the symbolism of which may show the promise of immortality. The inference seems quite subjective, at least not well supported. See Nock (1946) 140, critical of the inference in its best-known version, Cumont's, and further, Andreae (1963) 81 n.445, supporting Nock and citing F. Matz to the same end. On the ques-tion whether Dionysus cult could insure immortality, Bruhl ( 1953) 309 professes to lean on Cumont (1942), a work in which I can find nothing solid, and(cf. Bruhl 314 n.20) also Cumont (1949) 256f., again not useful. Bruhl himself (p. 312) offers a number of assertions while admitting scanty evidence beyond the sarcophagi: CIL 6.30122, which provides no support, and Plut., Moral. 61IE, depicting the soul as undergoing modified metempsychosi,s, and without individuality. Plutarch tells us that he relies on teachings partly ancestral, partly Dionysiac; but they appear rather Neoplatonic. 14. The \"mysteries\" are new features within the period of the Empire, d.

The evidence lies in Plut., Moral. 351Ff. and 364E, Heliodorus, Ethiop. 9.9, and Hippolyt., Refut. 5. 7. The arguments of Merkel-bach (1962) 12 and passim, that initiatory rites can be found hidden in Apul., Met. 4.33f., seem quite unsubstantial and can be set aside in the light of Williams (1978) 194 and Kane (1975) 342.

Franz Cumont, after more confident statements in the past, finally con· fessed in 1947 to \"our well-nigh total ignorance of the mysteries,\" in Mithraic Studies (1975) 198. For the third text, CIL 6.736 (A.D. 391), arcanis perfusionibus (not profusionibus) in aetemum renatus, c£. Meslin ( 1978) esp. 303-305, apparently unaware that itisa forgery (thus omitted from Vermaseren's Corpus and specified as false by Duthoy [1969) 66). The date and the echoes of Christianity and of non· Mithraic taurobolia, cf. below, n.23, would in any case deprive the text of value for our purposes. Finally, we have CIL 3.686 (third cent., Philippi)=Vermaseren (1956-1960) 2.382 no. 2343, i n part reading, sic placitum est divis aeterna vivere forma qui bene de supero lumine sit meritus, \"gifts promised to you in your pure course of life by the natural innocence once commanded by the god.'' The verse epitaph is pretty poetry, no more. It portrays afterlife \"as a Satyr\" summoned to Bacchus, or to the Naiads. It has no reference to Mithraism. As to the \"dead\" man shown in Mithraic frescoes, recalled by SHA Commod. 9, that need not be the initiate, about to be resurrected; pace Meslin 306, that item in the rites may have many meanings un-related to resurrection. 16. Orig., C. Cels. 6.22, with bibliog. ad loc., H. Chadwick(1965) 334; Porph., De abst. 4.16, but these \"statements ... about metempsychosis are not reliable,\" says Gordon ( 1972) 115 n.26. He gives no reason for saying this, but Porph., De antra 6, is compatible with Celsus-still more so, the statement ibid. 29, if that passage were tied by Porphyry to Mithraism (it is not). 17. Nilsson (1949) 765f. on the fresco called by Kane (1975) 343 \"the most con-vincing instance known' to me of an earthly banquet foreshadowing the blessed feast of the future life\"; but even here (Nilsson, p. 764), the inscription next to the dedicant contains common and quite opposed pagan sentiments of the sort, \"eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you die.\" 18. CIL 6.32316, date, A.D. 180, says Goodhue (1975) 9. Cumont (1917) 280-282 and others thought this text was proof of belief in immortality; but (Goodhue 111-114) still others disagree. Cumont (1917) 282 n.2, in his efforts to support his view, offers three perfectly useless citations, to Diog. Laertes (speaking only of Pythago-ras), Mnaseas (nearly five centuries too early), and S/G2 584 (not mentioning im-mortality).

One was the person heading the whole group. \"Schinas paid the bill for all his party,\" says K. Lehmann, ibid. The circumstances seem to contra· did Lehmann (1954) 93, that selection for epopteia \"was conditioned neither by financial nor by social status.\" Of the Eleusinian mysteries (the Great-the Lesser being at Agrae), Otto (1955) 23-30 offers a powerful vision; but it must be set against the icy sarcasm of Hippolyt., Ref. 5.8.39 (PG 16.3150B ), specifically speaking of the Great Epoptikon (therefore including the more advanced, if there were several grades). I do not agree with Kerenyi ( 1955) 34 n. 7 that Great rites at Cyzicus (known only in one inscription, BCH [1890] 537) necessarily imply Lesser. Nor does the seating in the show-theater of Demeter's shrine at Pergamon seem to me adequate evidence of two levels of initiation-contra, Ohlemutz (1940) 211. 20. Theon Smym., Math. p. 23 Dupuis, an interesting look at a generalized initiatory experience, suggesting that the same procedures were found in a number of rites. For the date, see Lesky (1966) 879, or OCD s.v. Similarly, Plutarch in Stobaeus 4.52.49 (Loeb ed., vol. 15 pp. 316-318) mayofferageneralizeddescription. He calls them onlyteA.etai ~eyciA.at; cf. Moral. 1105B, asserting that \"lots of people,\" 1tavu 7toA.A.o{, feel no fear of death, believing that the initiatory rites will assure them a delightful hereafter, described just as in the preceding fragment. Tertullian, De praescr. haer. 40.1-5, receives most recent comment from Gordon (1975) 234-236. The punctuation of the passage is controverted, but I agree with Gordon that diabolus rules all verbs save signat (my disagreement on 40.1.5 alone is irrelevant). Echoes of word choice recall idem, De baptismo 5, per lavacrum initiantur in both Isiacism and Mithraism. But the meaning of the rite may lie (5.1) in the Apollinian and Pelusian Games, \"where people are anointed, tinguntur, and believe by this they are born afresh and unpunished for oath-breaking\" (regeneratio to impunitas periuriorum, best explained by chap. 1.2 nn.69f., above, and n.34, below). 21. Charles-Picard (1954) 146 n.2; Festugiere (1945) 123, Corp. Herm. X, 20. 22. Meslin (1974) 290 is only the latest in a long series of scholars to make the assumption. He speaks of worshipers of \"the Oriental cults,\" undefined, as identi· fying themselves with the suffering and death of their god and his resurrection. But of course Jupiter Dolichenus, Sabazius and Mithra are Oriental but never suffered; and resurrection in divine stories more often calls to mind fertility (planting and growing) than immortality, e.g., in the story of Attis, cf. Firm. Matern., De errore profan. relig. 3, or of Kore or Osiris. 23. As pointed out by Lambrechts (1952) 163. 24. Cf. Duthoy (1969) passim, esp. 106 and 110.

In Mithraism, Cumont expatiated beyond measure on two fragments of evidence, namely a Dura graffito, cf. Cumont (1975) 204 and the inscription in Vermaseren (1959-1960) 1.49 no. 18. Gordon (1975) 231 n.64 seems a little harsh in calling the latter text \"the only evidence yet published that Mithras was conceived as just in the Graeco-Roman world,\" and further depreciates even that evidence. But his dismissal of Cumont is not far off the mark. Note Cumont' s main statement, (1929) 147, that Mithra presides as judge against the evil-a statement supported (282 n.68) by reference top. 83 (on Sarapis-irrelevant) and top. 92 (on Egypt-irrelevant) and to Cumont ( 1942) 89£., where is offered a dualistic picture of Mith· raism, but nothing on Mithra as judge. Here, Cumont also refers to Philo, De praemiis et poenis 6, but the passage, contrasting heaven and Tartarus, has no rele-vance to Mithraism. Tertullian, De praescr. haer. 40.2£., refers to the initiate's sins (in an unspecified cult), expositionem delictorum de lavacro repromittit, which might perfectly well be violations of ritual, not ethics. Porphyry, De antro 15, does not decide the ambiguity, though explicitly on Mithraism. He is cited for other ends by Gordon ( 1972) 114 n.24. The passage in Orig., C. Gels. 3.36, evidently regarding Isiacism, describes oracular or healing gods that also punish people for sins against \"some rule about impure food, or touching a corpse\"; similarly, Juv. 6.520f. and 535 on Isiacism show that only ritual purity (i.e., regarding sexual taboos or the like) are in question, for expiation; so likewise PI ut., Moral. 168D, transgressions of diet or, against promptings of one's guardian spirit (daemon ion), taking the wrong fork in the road; but Corp. herm. 10.19-21, ed.

(PG 22.337), in declaring the oracles, indiscriminately, to have been \"quenched,\" is simply wrong. So tooisCumont(l929)285, for\"thescep-ticism regarding oracles\" in the early Empire. He cites Strabo (who speaks obiter and obscurely of his own views), Livy (skeptical of portents two or three generations earlier), and Lucan 5.111 (who actually laments the silence of Delphic wisdom and justice). Dodds (1965) 57 likewise errs in speaking of \"the increasing demand for oracles\" in the second half of the third century. He adduces oracles quoted by Por-phyry (but these predate the crisis, cf. above, chap. l.l n.65) and POxy. 1477 (but that also is not relevant, cf. POxy. 2832f. andRE s.v.

Gels. 8.45), Christians could thus draw on a rich skeptical literature. The Christian arguments appear compendiously in Passio SS. Carpi, Papyli et Agathonicae I7f. (H. Musurillo, Acts of the Christian Martyrs p. 24), also often in the Apologists, e.g., Lact., Div. inst. 2.17. 2. The Vitality of Paganism 1. Lucian, A lex. 38-and 44, where one of the school appears as active chal-lenger. Chilton (1971) xxivf. finds Epicureans on the rise in the century, but Drach-man (1922) 121 finds that \"an essentially anti-religious school like that of the Epi-cureans actually dies out at this time,\" the first h a l f of the second century. The evidence, either way, is scant. 2. The charge of atheism against the Christians was extremely serious, and seriously repulsed. The evidence, e.g., Just., I Apol. 5f., or Athenag., Leg. 1, has been often discussed. Harnack ( 1905) 11 shrewdly notes the counterattack made by Apologists Greek and Latin through the pagan atheist Diagoras, as reproach against all pagans. For atheism being allegedly illegal, cf. Dio Chrysos., Or. 43.11 and 75.5 (obscure)-most likely a matter of public scandal but not actual crime, as also in Athens (Lucian, Demonax 11, with danger of stoning). 3.

The increase in superstition is generally sensed by modern students. P.R. L. Brown ( 1972) 122 doubts it. \"Thus it is far from certain that there was any absolute increase in fear of sorcery or in sorcery practices in the Late Roman period''-but he offers nothing in support of his \"thus.\" Further, Brown (1971) 82dismisses the older, and \"too often\" the modern, view that the increase arose from the \"democratization\" of culture and \"dilution of the ideas of an enlightened minority ... intrusion into the upper classes\" of lower class ideas. \"To take issue with such a view would involve rewriting the social and religious history of the Roman world.\" This, he does not attempt.

Helios Apollo in a Milesian inscription, Rehm (1958) no. 504, Tetrarchic, and the identification Heliodorus draws at the end of the Aethiopica {late Severan?) between Helios and Apollo. 38. For example, PGM 7lines 529f. (third cent.); 4lines 481£., Helios Mithras the Great; lines 640f., \"0 Sun, Lord of the sky and earth, god of gods\" (but, lines 987f., Horos Harpocrates is addressed in closely similar terms); lines 118lf., \"Helios, father of the Cosmos,\" etc., d. 1997£.; 12lines 115£. (A.D. 300-350), \"the fiery god\" is \"master of the whole cosmos.\" 39. Cumont's long-popular interpretations are disposed of by Seyrig (197lb) 338-366. One of the latter's main points is the distinction between Sol simply being worshiped (e.g., p. 365), and being worshiped as Zeus (or as some king-god). On Aziz, see further Hanslik (1954) 180, the god identified with Apollo and put on coins of Gallus, A.D. 252. 40. Dothan (1968) 99-103; the gesture is often discussed, as for example by L'Orange ( 1935) 89. It appears on coins from Sept. Severus on, as characteristic of Sol, taken up simultaneously by the emperors (p. 95) along with the globus in the left hand (p. 97); but Brilliant (1963) 109 Fig. 3.13 and p. 110 shows the gesture earlier (Trajan), d. also 149 and Fig. 3.111 (Commodus) and 209 (Sarapis in 216)-so Sol has no monopoly. 41. Kantorowicz ( 1963) 117-126; Fears (1977) 241, Trajanic and Hadrianic aurei; 257 and 267, Gordianic; and the same symbolism with Aurelian, ibid. 285, and with Licinius and Maximin Daia in A.D. 308, d. Seston ( 1956) 185. Against Kantorowicz, I think Oriens means \"the eastern regions\" (sometimes personified as a woman, d. RIC 5,1.290), not \"on the rise\" or \"rising-ness.\" Against Fears, I think Sol giving the globus even to Jupiter indicates friendliness, not superiority, and is therefore not \"a numismatic statement of solar monotheism\" (p. 285£., cf. Saturn giving Jove his thunderbolt, p. 287-not Saturnian monotheism). 42. Sol invictus on second cent. coins, Kantorowicz (1963) 128; the survey carried into the third cent. by Storch (1968) 200-203; the epithet is applied also to Perse-phone, below, n.53. It is attached to Commodus and Severus on coins and to Cara-calla and emperors thereafter in coins and inscriptions, L'Orange (1935) 97; first epigraphic appearance in A.D. 158, Seyrig (197lb) 366; Sol invictus on Gallienus's coins, in De Blois (1976) 115, that emperor being the first to wear Sol's jeweled diadem instead of the rayed crown, d. Arnheim (1972) 25; Aurelian also wore the diadem, ibid. 26, d. Aur. Viet., Epit. 35.3; and his coins proclaimed Sol dominus imperi Romani, c£. A. Alfoldi (1967) 376=CAH 12 (1939) 193, and Redo (1973) 68. Notice, however, that (except for a period in the Serdica mint) Sol does not crowd out Mars and Jupiter from Aurelian's coinage (RIC passim). On Sol as conservator Augusti under Probus, see Fears ( 1977) 293. For Sol invictus on Tetrarchic coins, see M. R.

Seston (1956) 185 notes Licinius's coins honoring Sol in 308 and 317 (and see further, below n.53). The best-known Constantinian Sol-Comes issue is closely derived from an issue of Probus, cf. M. R. Alfoldi ( 1963) 51. The cult offered by Constantine is termed, by L'Orange ( 1935) l 0 I and 107, a Staatsreligion, staatlichen Sonnenkult. Compare Merkelbach, below, n.46, or Latte ( 1960) 365, where Aurelian and others from the mid-third century are seen trying to establish a \"Reichsreligion\" through Solar cult, very much as Swoboda ( 1964) 72 can say that \"Sol as invictus from Aurelian on stood at the center of the state cult.\" But no such descriptions seem justifiable. 43.

SHA Elagabalus 7.4; for the coins, cf. CAH 12 (1939) 54 n.2; the main sources are Herodian 5.5.6-5.6.8 and Dio 80.11-13, Dio expressing outrage at the subordi-nation of Zeus himself. Ephemeral traces of Elagabalus's efforts are canvassed by Dupont-Sommer and Robert (1964) 79£. 45. Zos. 1.61 and SHA Aurelian 25.4 and 31.7-9 seem in conflict. Homo (1904) 184-189 refers to the Roman temple attested in the Regionaries, etc., and the pontifices dei Solis in CIL 6.2151, etc. For a short and more sober account, see Mattingly in CAH 12 (1939) 309. On the buildingatPalmyra,cf. Seyrig(l971) 110£.: Belus is actually Bel, nota solar deity at all. Note CIL 11.6308 (Pisaurum), Herculi Aug. consorti d. n. Aureliani, at odds with any picture of solar monotheism. 46. Grant (1968) 173 speaks of the moment around A.D. 309. Cf. Merkelbach ( 1962) 234: \"The last stage of ancient paganism is the syncretistic Helios cult. In the 3rd cent. it was for long periods the official religion of the Roman state; all other religions were to be subsumed in that of Helios.\" The statement is in accord with the importance most scholars attribute to the cult. 47. Plut., Moral. 413C; Firm.

Other allegations of evangelizing are easy to find but unsupported, e.g., in Cumont (1929) 81, Festugiere (1949) 231, Mocsy (1974) 255,or Krill (1978) 40. 13.

Legion-ary commanders offer dedications often (I withhold many inscriptions by lower officers, tribunes, centurions, and prefects), sometimes clearly not ex officio-e.g., with their wives, in ILS 3085-3087 or 3092 (or wife and daughter, CIL 8.2630), or from a vision, ILS 3229; cf. CIL 3.5862, dated to late third cent. by Schwertheim (1974) 221. Other texts do not indicate whether or not the governor appears ex officio (presumably not): CIL 3.1111, 1118,4796, and 5862; 13.6754; in Africa, a third of all named dedications to Mithra are by consular governors or legionary commanders, in Vermaseren (1956-1960) 2.92-98. Citing several of these texts, LeG lay (1954) 277 infers \"the official character of this cult in the military capital of Roman Africa.\" The inference is gratuitous. 71.

Other local Italian Dianas are easy to find, e.g., Nemoren-sis, CIL 3.1773 in Dalmatia; d. Fortuna of Praeneste invoked in Sarmizegetusa, CIL 3.1421. 5. On Silvanus in Dacia, though not solely the Italian deity, seeS. Toth (1967) 78. 6. Negotiatores may identify themselves as such when they make dedications, e.g., in CIL 3.7761 (Apulum, Suri to Dolichenus) or 11812 (Mainz, to Dolichenus); but the practice is far too rare to produce usable statistics. The clustering of Mercury inscriptions on commercial points and routes produces a striking pattern in the Dijon-Langres area, d. Renardet (1973) 122, patterns which could no doubt be found elsewhere, too. L. Toth (1974) 346, 352, and map on p. 357, finds it in Pan· nonia, for Isis inscriptions; Malaise ( 1972) 350, too, for Isiacism in Italy. He infers traders spread the cult. 7. Vidman ( 1966) 113 points that, aside from a single example in Lambaesis and another in Britain, there are no Isiac temples in military contexts anywhere in the west (in the east, the picture changes slightly, e.g., CIL 3.1342, to the goddess by an ala I Hi11p. Campagonum, and see following note). 8. The Isis temple (VIII 7, 28 on the map) was never large, though eventually ornate. On the slave population in Italy (or a fair guess), see Hopkins (1978) 9; on the class of Isis's congregation, d. Castren (1975) 115n.8and207. Note also Malaise (1972) 76f. for Italy broadly, with ingenui totaling three in the first cent., seventeen in the first/second, and twenty-four in the second/third (p. 77 n.2). Compare Zoto-vic (1968) 63, finding Isiacs in Dalmatia and Pannonia (esp. Pann. Sup.) to be largely slaves, and of Greek descent. · 9. Malaise (1972) 71-73. Malaise, esp. in pp. 26-37, 70-74, and 103, offers very valuable remarks on method. 10. Malaise (1972) 77 n.2; Vidman (1965) 389, first dating the high point of Isiacism in the west merely to the third century, and citing only Cumont ( 1929) 11-who himself, without specifying Isiacism or offering any substantiation, speaks of the apogee of the \"Oriental\" cults in that period. But Vidman then turns to \"base himself above all on inscriptions,\" finding their apogee under Caracalla and (p. 394) thereafter a sharp decline. On their chronological distribution, see Mrozek (1973) 114-116, in an article of exceptional value. Mrozek 115 n.2 gently points out how his results invalidate certain findings in Roman religious history. His findings received confirmation in the same year he offered them. Lassere (1973) 133-151 offered approximate dates for pagan epitaphs from a number of major sites in Africa Proconsularis and Numidia. The great bulk of his examples, roughly 4,000 texts, can be arranged into centuries (his own categories, such as \"end of the Repub· lie to Trajan,\" \"second/third century,\" do not lend themselves to a table or graph): they are in the proportions 1:3:2 for the periods A.D. 1-100, 101-200, and201-\"mid-third cent.\" (\"milieu du Ille siecle,\" meaning evidently not exactly A.D. 250 but, let us say, 240-260). The high point is Severan (texts dated \"end of second or third century,\" \"end of second/beginning of third century,\" and \"Severan\" total ca. 1250).

Toutain (1907-1920) 1,2.34, colliding with a statement handiest in Cumont (1929) 81. Toutain's work seems to me admirable. In all my reading, however, I recall seeing it cited only by Frend (1952)-himself the best of judges. Cumont's work, on the other hand, entirely dominates the study of religion in Roman antiquity. I have offered elsewhere (above, chap. 1.3 nn.I9 and 28; in chap. 2.1 nn. 15, 18, 36, and 55; in chap. 2.2 n.9; in chap. 2.3 n.39; below, nn.l9, 24, and 26) a sampling of points which suggest how little trust should, in my opinion, be placed in Cumont's statements. The collision between him and Toutain was renewed: Toutain (1907-1920) 1,3.5 and 10 against Cumont (1912) 127, regarding the accept· ance of Isiacism in North Africa. Charles-Picard (1954) 225 attempted to correct Toutain: there is evidence for the cult in Africa. True-but nothing to invalidate Toutain's method, heavily relying on inscriptions as opposed to literary texts; and even in 1954, there was not enough new material seriously to modify conclusions based on the data available in 1920. The indices of GIL 8 yield only two inscriptions (excluding, as I do from this book, Mauretania). 12. Hatt (1978) 277 defends the importance of \"Oriental\" cults in Gaul, but means mostly Cybele and Mithra. On Lyon, see LeG lay (1972) 13: out of I, 150 texts, 306 are of Greek-speaking origin, all texts being almost exclusively of the second and third centuries. In GIL 13, in Gaul, I count seven Isiac texts, of which one comes from Lyon, the rest from Belgica and Germany. 13. For distribution of inscriptions according to sex, notice those of the Mainz area which give the age of the deceased: 186 men to 15 women, in Szilagyi (1961) 128f. In GIL 13, in compiling the figures offered in the text, I count under Mithra the dedications to Cautes, Sol, and Invictus; under Isis, also Sarapis; under Cybele, also Mater Deum, Magna Mater, and Attis. In the same volume, nos. 1-5192 and 11000-11600 are from the interior; 5193-8860 and ll601-12085 are from the limes, some-what arbitrarily defined (the omitted nos. are milestones, graffiti, and on ceramic material). Of all, 40 percent or more are from the frontier. To show that Cybele worshipers were \"old-Italian,\" observe that in the western and southern peninsula, where there was the least moving in and out of population, this cult shows its largest share among the several \"Oriental\"-Malaise ( 1972) 460 lists 37 inscriptions for Isis, 8 for Dolichenus, 17 for Mithra, but 80 for Cybele. Quite different in Venetia: the same four cults produce figures of 44, 5, 25, and 20. The same contrast appears in Dalmatia and Pannonia: Cybele-worshipers are much more likely to be Roman citizens than worshipers of other \"Oriental\" cults. See Zotovic (1968) 62. 14. In GIL 5, where I add Jupiter to the deities listed in the table (above, p. 6), and where I count Dolichenus, Cybele, Isis, and Mithra as \"Oriental,\" the numbers (out of 500 all told) are 394 men honoring Greco-Roman names as against 55 women; 50 men honoring \"Oriental\" gods as against 1 woman (her memorial coming from Milan, where the men's ratio is 15:8, Greco-Roman and \"Oriental,\" i.e. 60 percent of the men favor \"exotic\" deities, not I 0 percent as in the area overall). 15. For example, in Merlat (1951) passim, 123 inscriptions attest Jupiter Doli· chen us: 113 male (35 being soldiers or veterans) with 10 women (6 ofthem as wives). In Dacia, GIL 3. 787-1627 and 7624-8060 yield 69 dedications in which the sex of the dedicant is dear and in which the deities are \"Oriental\" (Mithra, Isis, Cybele, Do lichen us, Dea Syria, and Malagbel ). Of these 69, 64 are men ( 42 for Mithra alone), The women worship Isis and Cybele. The percentages arrived at by L. W. Jones"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Notes to Pages 117-119 201 (1929) 298, comparing men's and women's attachment to \"Oriental\" or \"Italian\" deities, are perhaps credible for men, but I suspect that the sampling for women skews the truth through being too small. It shows a positive preference for the \"Oriental,\" 36.6 percent to 31.7 percent. 16. On Mainz, see above, n.l3, and Clauss ( 1973) 399, who compares distribution among epitaphs also in other towns (ibid.): 73.4 percent of all that give age at death are of soldiers and kin in Carnuntum, 60 percent in Viminacium, etc. At Singi· dunum, city and territory, half of some 62 inscriptions are of soldiers and veterans, cf. Mirkovic and Dusanic (1976) 39. Mocsy (1970) 167 estimates troops in Moesia Superior, including veterans, at less than 5 percent of the total population but they account for 25 percent of the inscriptions ( 13-60 percent in different districts). How such maldistribution might affect our picture of a cult may be guessed from com· paring these figures with others, for Dolichenus, in chap. 1.1 n.29, above. Note, too (Mocsy [1970] p. 208) that 92 percent of all inscriptions come from 20percentof the area of the province (or 80 percent come from 8 percent of the areal). 17. Mocsy (1970) 193; Toutain (1907-1920) 1,3.445, on 24 out of 520 votive texts from Gaul; cf. Drexel ( 1922) 25 describing the Roman and Celtic element in Rhaetia as \"the very thinnest crust,\" covering native deities not one of whose names we know from inscriptions; and (p. 24) we are similarly in the dark about religion in the Rhine provinces. Etienne et al. ( 1976) 98 offer a revealing figure: at Conimbriga, in Latin inscriptions on stone, one-third of the cognomina are native; but once one turns to those inscribed on clay, the figure rises to three-fourths. 18. For the dates outlining the Do1ichenus cult, cf. Merlat (1951) passim; I. Toth (1971) 23; Malaise (1972) 461; and Speidel (1978) 4, 9f., and 73. Fitz (1959) 259 more than once speaks of the cult as being \"offizielle,\" thanks to Sept. Severus. The view and terminology, though conventional, are mistaken. See above pp. 103£. and chap. 2.4 n.70. 19.

Cf. also the Hadrianic essayists on the cult referred to by Porph., De abst. 2.56. Gordon (1975) 237f. persuades me that Dio Chrys., Or. 36.39£., shows no knowledge of Mithraism. But the cult is better known ca. A.D. 160, when Justin assumes that an eastern audience will have heard of its cult meals, pial. 70and1Apol. 66. Cumont's views on the connections between Mithraism and Persia, and hence the meaning of \"Persian\" applied to the cult, are in process of dissolution.

I accept questionable texts in the collection, including \"Sol\" texts, some of which are possibly, some cer-tainly, not Mithraic. In Africa, Mithra is as unknown as in the east, save for the Lambaesis area, as Charles-Picard (1954) 222 pointed out. On the high proportion of soldiers in the epigraphy of the frontier, see above, nn.l3 and 16.

SHA Commod. 9-a wild paragraph in an unreliable author. Cumont(l929) 139 offers no substantiation for saying \"the conversion[!] caused an immense stir.\" The phrase was repeated verbatim from Cumont ( 1896-1899) 1.277 and a third time in Cumont (1902) 70. So truth becomes established, d., e.g., Ferguson (1970) 48, Commodus's initiation \"led to the first great period of the cult.\" For the prefect mentioned, L. Flavius A per in CIL 3.15156, see Hoffiller and Saria ( 1938) 1.146£. and 149; and proportions of high officers, etc., are noted by Gordon (1972) 103f. 25. Packer ( 1967) 86 offers ca. 27,000 as the max. pop. for Ostia (including unex· cavated parts; earlier estimates are double that); but density estimates in Packer 86 n.55 are to be modified upward by Frier (1977) 28£. The Mithraea were generally small, mean structures, holding less than twenty up to a maximum of forty, d. Meiggs ( 1960) 372. Not all fifteen were certainly in use at any one time. Schwertheim (1979) 57 mentions an average capacity of 20-30, counting larger examples in Rome. For crowds at temple gates, no more than a suggestive picture, d. Herondas, Mimiambi 4.54, cited in Edelstein and Edelstein (1945) 1.273. 26. Cumont ( 1929) 130 calls Mithraism a more and more pressing presence in the second century, \"remaining until the end of the 4th century the most important cult in paganism.\" His view might still receive general support. Discouraging. 27. M. P. Nilsson's suggestion is quoted as a fact by Nock (1958a) 292-with which Wikander (1950) 44 more or less agrees. Cumont (1975) 205 pictures Mith· raism \"finally coming under the control of the State and the emperors,\" so that he can explain the wide dispersal of the cult, e.g., to the Dura chapel, without having to admit a native eastern branch; but d. above, on \"state\" cults. I withhold my own inexpert ideas about pre-100 Mithraism, not to add to inconclusive debate. 28. Above, at chap. 1.4 n.l6; d. theuj.lVl']tpia in the Demeter mysteries, Ohlemutz (1940) 221. 29. Paus. 8.2.5, complaining of evil days as the reason why no new gods come into being from men. The passage happens to coincide with, and contradict, CIG 5980=1G 14.966=SIG2 807, which reports a miracle in Rome, bystanders rejoicing \"because the powers were living then in the reign of our emperor Antoninus.\" Porphyry in Euseb., Praep. ev. 5.1 (179df.) speaks of the declining presence of the gods, but in a polemical setting. 30.

In works demonstrating the most admirable scholarship and powers in phi· lology, one may find statements that no historian would dream of making. Drawing from major authorities, throughout this chapter's notes, I have scattered examples which it would be invidious to recall at this point. 33. Gordon (1972) 94. 34. Gordon (1972) assumes Mithraism's exclusion of women, special connection with soldiers, moral dualism and notions of sin, derivation from Iran and many other features contrary to my understanding of the facts or wholly unsubstantiated; but, in addition, I cannot accept his main point, that \"the departmental boss,\" slave owners, \"various superiors,\" \"senior officers\" (pp. 107f. and 112)-in short, the ruling class-encouraged the cult as a \"self-conscious piece of opportunism\" through \"conscious realization\" of its usefulness (pp. 110 and 112). That implies a manipulative conspiracy among upper-class worshipers supported by no evidence and, I would say, by no likelihood. 35. Vermaseren and van Essen (1965) 232. 36.

But the datable coins of Brit. Mus. Lycia, Pamphylia, and Pisidia in the same six half-centuries run 17, 13, 30, 67, 231, 177. Hence the two curves, for Men and for all coins (of one region), differ (i.e., they tell us something about Men) only in the third century, esp. 235 on, since in both curves the Severan rulers account for the identical 28 percent. 43.

On Saturn, see Frend (1952) 76, noting the abrupt falling-off in ex-votos and temple building after 235, and modifications of this picture by LeG lay ( 1966), accepting the decline, pp. 96f., but insisting (without really very much data, pp. 101£.) on the cult's continued survival; for Jupiter Dolichenus, see Zotovic (1968) 73. 44.

Their numbers first diminish sharply at the accession of Sept. Severus, fall off a second big step (say, by a half, from the second-cent. average) in A.D. 225, and a third, in 300. 45.

Jones (1968) 24. CT 7.20.2 receives more weight than it deserves (ibid.), since it gives the shouts, dei te nobis seroent, of only one army unit at one date-both unknown. Jones intends to follow Seeck (who surmises A.D. 826, on the basis of an emendation); but his confused sentence actually indicates 822. The fourth-cent. burial practices of soldiers in the West are abundantly attested, but only show that some were pagan, not how many. The only indications of religion in the ranks of the competing forces in 894 are Christian-in Theodosius' s army folded in with Eugenius's, after the Frigidus. Cf. Hoffmann (1968) 24f. and his nos. 11, 14, and 85. 4. Old inscriptions, like CIL 6.102, 987 and 50=IG 14.1018; new, like AE 1969-1970 no. 116 and 1975 no. 54; and neglected details, e.g., Macrob. 1.28.18, Antium, and Maximus of Turin, Sermo 72.2.42 (for the date, cf. Mutzenbecher in Corp. Christ. Lat. p. XXXV n.J ), 5. E.g., CIL 8.6975; 12272; and 24521. 6. Cf. texts like Aug., Ep. 16£. and Civ. dei 7 .26. On the strength of fourth cent. African paganism in general, see Warmington ( 1954) 85£. and above, chap. 2.5 n.lO. On Saturn cult, against Frend (1952) 88f., I would set LeG1ay (1966) 101£. and Frend' s own picture (pp. 61-64) of the sharp decline of the classes and centers which were most likely to produce records and buildings of any sort. The existence of a church in a town or village, here in Africa or anywhere else, of course does not prove Christian predominance. Christians and pagans everywhere coexisted. That is easily shown to be the rule-with noted exceptions. 7. ILS 4197 (A.D. 860s) and Paneg. vet. 12(2).87.4 (A.D. 888). 8. Pautalia (in Moesia, later Dacia Mediterranea), in Hoddinott (1975) 182. Mocsy (1974) 824 offers more (but undatable) examples of vandalized shrines and statues; also, p. 828, some interesting speculation on the epigraphic evidence, with· in which, in the earlier 300s, pagan epitaphs vanish and Christian begin to appear. For the burning and smashing of pagan temples and images in the upper Danube areas, see Alfoldy (1974) 210f., A.D. 380 and later, and Stlihelin (1948) 580, A.D. 840s and later. 9.

But discussion of what life and views the convert would find in the Church does not seem to me very useful in explaining the growth of the Church, unless one supposes that many converts (in the sense of persons now believing that the Christian God really existed and really was supreme) would promptly have fallen away if they had not found other essential things that held them unshakably in the faith. 15.

Among its thousands of references to sources, however, I can find not one to a pagan source and hardly~ line indicating the least attempt to find out what non-Christians thought and believed.
