To date, there have beenno comprehensive evaluations of Nordic witchcraft beliefs between1100and1525, whereas studies of Scandinavian witchcraft in the eras both before andafter this period abound. The reasons for this situation are many. In largepart, it is explained by the tendency for many of the late medieval materials,such as the Icelandic sagas, to be appropriated to discussions of the muchearlier Viking Age; moreover, there is a view among some specialists thatnothing much happened with respect to Scandinavian witchcraft before circa1400.1I argue, on the contrary, that much was happening and that an evalua-tion of this important meeting ground of church doctrine and vernacularbelief systems in the period between the Viking Age and the early modernera has long been a desideratum, both for the study of witchcraft in Scandina-via itself and for the study of witchcraft in Europe more broadly.2The currentwork thus presents an account of developments in witchcraft beliefs through-out Scandinavia in the later Middle Ages, of how elite and nonelite, nativeand imported constructions of witchcraft evolved during the centuries beforethe Reformation, an era of profound and widespread changes that set thestage for the early modern crazes.A phrase like ‘‘Nordic witchcraft,’’ especially when framed by specificdates, suggests a highly bounded entity, a set of orthodox views held by ahomogenous culture, but nothing could be further from the truth. What weknow and what we can reconstruct about the world of Northern Europefrom the early Iron Age through the Middle Ages says that it was always aheterogeneous and dynamic world, and, importantly, seen from the perspec-tive of the people we tend to think of as ‘‘Scandinavians’’ or ‘‘proto-Scandina-vians,’’ a world in which their neighbors, the Sa ́mi, with their shamanic"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xprefacepractices, played significant roles, as recent research has emphasized.3More-over, as the Nordic world expanded during the Viking Age, leapfrogging itsway across the North Atlantic islands, Norse settlers and travelers came intocontact with yet another shamanism-practicing culture when they establishedcolonies in Greenland, western outposts that lasted throughout the MiddleAges. Likewise, their eastward expansion brought them into greater proximityto Finnic and other peoples, whose cultures too had echoes of shamanism.4And it should be borne in mind, as regards the variegated nature of theNordic cultural region, that these events took place across a stretch of theearth roughly comparable to distances across North America.5At the same time, that Scandinavia was drawn into the Christian ambitby the beginnings of the new millennium meant that the cultural construc-tion of such concepts as magic and witchcraft was increasingly shaped underthinking developed in other parts of Europe. By the later Middle Ages, ideasabout such matters reticulated between the local Scandinavian populationand adjacent vernacular cultures, especially in Hanseatic-influenced citieswith large foreign settlements (e.g., Bergen, Copenhagen, Stockholm). Inother words, there is in one sense no such thing as ‘‘Nordic witchcraft,’’ butthere are recoverable outlines of an evolving set of more or less similar beliefsheld by the Scandinavian-speaking peoples of the Middle Ages, and it is inthat sense that I intend the phrase ‘‘Nordic witchcraft,’’ even when I havenot elaborated the problematic nature of the expression.The time frame1100–1525is naturally both artificial and subjective butdoes reflect certain important criteria that tend to bundle around theseboundaries: in the European context, the dates capture the legal reforms thattook place circa1100and the early thirteenth-century shift in the church’sthinking about the nature of witchcraft and magic and the relationship ofthese phenomena to diabolism and heresy (e.g., the oft-citedVox in RamaofPope Gregory IX in1233); at the other end, the date reflects the beginningsof the Reformation (e.g., Martin Luther’s excommunication in1521).6Withinthe Scandinavian context, Christianity is reasonably well established in elitecircles—at least—throughout Scandinavia by1100, and it is first in the thir-teenth century that contemporary Nordic documents become available inlarge quantities. And, of course, the Nordic region was deeply transformedby the early sixteenth-century Reformation, a period in which major political,religious, and linguistic developments mark a break with the medieval past.7I have used the somewhat arbitrary year of1525, because it is at approximatelythis point that the dominant political map of Scandinavia is set for the next"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"prefacexithree centuries with the establishment of a Swedish kingdom clearly indepen-dent of Denmark.Many of the residents of this region were descendants of the Nordicpirates and adventurers who traveled, raided, traded, and settled widelythroughout much of the known world during the so-called Viking Age, butthis emphatically isnota book about Vikings. It does, however, depend inlarge part on a great medieval literature that centers on events—sometimesfactual, sometimes mere literary confections—set in the Viking Age. Thesheer brilliance of these texts, and especially their uncanny ability to makethe medieval world seem so accessible, can be an attractive nuisance, to usethe lawyer’s term of art. An extraordinary medieval literature, often well in-formed by tradition, the sagas are nevertheless not mirrorlike reflections ofthe Viking Age but rather something akin to forerunners of the historicalnovel.8No one would, by way of a parallel, hope to use the weird sisters fromthe opening ofMacbeth(ca.1605) as source material for eleventh-centuryScottish witchcraft beliefs rather than those of Jacobean Britain. Yet in theOld Norse field, mining an Icelandic saga known only from post-Reformationarticulations in order to comment on the tenth century does not automati-cally seem so improbable or problematic.That is not to say, however, that the remarkable work done in interpret-ing the sagas in the light of folklore, archaeology, philology, and other frame-works has not done much to encourage our confidence in the sagas as sourcesand shown how critically important they are as parts of a larger culturalpuzzle.9As a number of earlier studies have carefully combed through thesetexts, identifying their testimony to the various qualities the thirteenth andlater centuries attributed to Nordic magic and witchcraft, I have avoidedrepeating that process yet again here. Instead, I want to demonstrate howand to what extent medieval Icelanders actively used the concepts of magicand witchcraft in their literature and, more narrowly, how witchcraft and itspractitioners are employed to project a sense of the past, of the remote worldof pagan Scandinavia.Determining the best means for presenting the complicated, interlacedevolution in clerical and popular cultures about witches in the centuries be-tween the Viking Age and the Reformation presents a challenge. In structur-ing this monograph I have eschewed the more obvious chronologicalapproach—its directness appealing at first blush, of course, but fraught withits own complications—and instead embraced an approach in which the vari-ous chapters are organized around specific idea complexes. Thus, although"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiprefacethe chapters are not meant to be limited to, or by, types of source material,they do often reflect concentrations of certain genres—literature, laws, andso forth. Chapter1surveys the available materials on, and approaches to, thetopic; further, it reviews the status of magic in pagan Scandinavia, as well asits represented value in the conversion of the Nordic region. The nature andusefulness of magic in daily life, in both Christian and pagan contexts, is thesubject of Chapter2, which also reviews the major arenas in which magic wasused, namely, romance, fortune, health, weather, and malediction. Chapter3examines how medieval Nordic authors represent, and use, witchcraft andmagic in narrative materials, not only in the Icelandic sagas, but also inhistories and other forms of courtly and ecclesiastical literature. In Chapter4, I take up late medieval mythologies developed in the Nordic world aboutthe nature, powers, and habits of witches. Chapter5examines the rich mate-rials about witchcraft contained in normative documents, such as the provin-cial laws, as well as the documented cases of witchcraft prosecution frommedieval Scandinavia. The complex relationship between gender and theconstruction of witchcraft in medieval Scandinavia is the subject of Chapter6. And, finally, in the epilogue I survey the developments in the medievalperiod in Northern Europe, with a focus on how these changes help establishthe framework for the witch-hunts of the early modern era.As regards nomenclature, it should be noted that there are importantdifferences in the contemporary world between the geographically deriveddesignation ‘‘Scandinavian’’ and the more inclusive ‘‘Nordic,’’ an adjectivewhose usage embraces with greater ease the non-Indo-European cultural andlinguistic traditions of the region, Sa ́mi and Finnish in particular, and doesnot so readily pigeonhole Icelandic and Faroese traditions. On the otherhand, the terms are so thoroughly intertwined in standard English usage,and offer such an excellent opportunity for stylistic relief, that I use theminterchangeably and mark meaningful differences in materials that are Ger-manic versus non-Germanic, insular versus noninsular, and so on with ex-plicit designations. Similarly, in the interest of clarity, I have generally usedwhat are strictly speaking anachronistic terms such as Danish, Norwegian,and so on, even where the cultures and polities under discussion were notalways consonant with the modern national states. At the same time, I havetried to respect the political realities of the Middle Ages where there havebeen important postmedieval changes in boundaries (e.g., the modern Swed-ish regions of Ska ̊ne, Blekinge, Halland, and Bohusla ̈n). As regards the spell-ing of personal names, no single rule works perfectly. I have generally"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"prefacexiiinormalized names to Old Norse standards for periods before the mid-four-teenth century or so but, for later periods, regularized them according torules of the dominant national language, orthographic anachronisms not-withstanding.10No less difficult has been the question of what terms to apply to thephenomena scrutinized in the following pages. The very sensible concernsraised by scholars who prefer employing native terminology liketrolldo ́mrandgaldrrather than ‘‘witchcraft’’ and ‘‘magic,’’ for example, are not lightlydismissed; yet at the same time, this debate, so familiar to students of folknarratives, has another side, one which argues that although using nativeterminologies has its advantages, it also removes the Nordic world from thegrowing international discussion of such topics.11Moreover, because thisstudy is keyed to the later Middle Ages rather than the pre-Christian era, andespecially given the increasing influence of the church in shaping these issues,employing the vernacular terms, where many of our documents use Latinterms such asmaleficia,would be forced and anachronistic. In the hope ofresolving this issue favorably, and with due attention to both the native tradi-tions and the international context, I have generally used standard Englishterminology followed by the Nordic or Latin terms in parentheses where theexact phrasing can be deemed significant."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IntroductionNorse mythology, as described by Snorri Sturluson (1178–1241), tells of astory falsely spread by the dwarves about the death of Kvasir, the anthropo-morphic representation of knowledge in Norse paganism. The dwarves, whohave actually slain the creature themselves, tell the gods that Kvasir diedbecause he was unable to disgorge himself of what he knew: Kvasir has essen-tially choked on his own knowledge.1The diligent student of witchcraft inany European tradition writing in the twenty-first century must necessarilyfeel uncomfortably at home in this story, as the volume of scholarly literaturetreating European witchcraft, already vast, has grown especially rapidly overthe past forty years or so, reflecting a rekindled interest that is simultaneouslyboth popular and professional.2Certainly witchcraft has been in the spotlight in recent decades, so muchso that it has been likened to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, that is,a field unto itself.3Given the volume and diversity of available scholarship, awriter hoping to provide a fully articulatedStand der Forschungfor the studyof witchcraft in medieval Scandinavia, let alone Europe as a whole (or otherinkhorn act of hubris), will want to think twice. Still, some observations ontrends in this extensive scholarship will be useful in their own right, as wellas to situate in the reader’s mind my own line of inquiry and the basis for—and biases of—my comments.4First, I outline the main currents in scholar-ship about magic and witchcraft in Europe, and then turn to the issue of thetrends within scholarship on this field in Scandinavia. Finally, I examine thebasic concepts and vocabulary important to this study.Very broadly, the development of the church’s thinking about witch-craft—the ability to manipulate power due to an individual’s innate qualities,to acquired learning, or to a bargain with evil forces—increasingly saw thisphenomenon in nearly Manichean terms, characterized by one scholar as thechurch’s ‘‘sharp binary division of the spiritual universe into opposing divineand demonic realms. . . .’’5On the one side stood church doctrine about"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2introductionsuch matters; on the other, everything else, namely, all that was perceivedas opposing that view, notably, paganism as an active force in areas as yetunconverted, the remnants of paganism in those that were, and, increasingly,heresies of various kinds. Throughout the Christian era, witchcraft and otherforms of magic are condemned by influential church leaders (e.g., SaintsAugustine of Hippo, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville) and church coun-cils (e.g., the Council of Paris in829). At the same time, a critical spirit insome writers cautiously regards these beliefs as unreal, that is, as phantasmsand diabolical deceptions, expressed most famously in the early tenth-centuryCanon episcopiof Regino of Pru ̈m and works influenced by it (e.g., the peni-tential of Burchard of Worms).The significant changes in legal thinking that came in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries, especially the recovery and reintroduction of Romanlaw, and with it, an inquisitorial (as opposed to accusatorial) system but-tressed by judicial torture,6as well as a more robust system of canon law,7hasled some scholars to conclude that it was at this point that Europe became a‘‘persecuting society.’’8With respect to magic and witchcraft, an importantresult of this transformation was the tendency to seek out perceived hetero-dox views. It is hardly surprising that those believed to practice magic wouldsoon fall within the ambit of such a system: thus, for example, in1326, PopeJohn XXII published a decree (Super illius specula) calling for immediateexcommunication of all those who invoked demons in the pursuit of divina-tion or other acts of magic.9By the end of that same century (1398), thetheology faculty of the University of Paris condemned in broad terms allforms of sorcery, tying acts of magic to the notion of the devil’s pact (pactumcum diabolo).In1437, Pope Eugenius IV wrote all papal inquisitors concerning in-vokers of demons, enumerating some of the evil deeds of which he under-stood them to be guilty (e.g., weather magic) and associated these acts withthe work of the devil. In fact, throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centu-ries, a series of works by a variety of clergymen (e.g., Nicolaus Eymeric,Nicholas von Jauer, Jean Gerson, Johannes Nider, Johannes Hartlieb of Ba-varia, Nicholas Jacquier) helped promote similar views.10What is perhaps themost famous of the medieval texts to address witchcraft,Malleus maleficarum,came into existence only near the end of the Middle Ages (1486). The workmainly of Heinrich Kra ̈mer (Institoris), a Dominican inquisitor, with uncer-tain, and disputed, assistance from his fellow inquisitor, Jakob Sprenger, thisso-called hammer of the witches perhaps represents more an outlying view of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction3women, witches, and court procedures than the norm for which it is some-times taken; certainly the degree to which it reflects medieval mentalities hascome under attack in recent years.11For many centuries, the church regarded activities associated with witch-craft as mere superstition, simple error that could be corrected through pen-ance and other forms of contrition. By the end of the Middle Ages, however,those who employed this kind of non-Christian magic were conceived of aspart of an organized diabolical cult, worshippers of Satan who engaged ingruesome rites and activities and who were generally beyond salvation andsubject to capital punishment.12That this came to be so, it has been argued,resulted from the combination in clerical thinking of two different systemsof magic. One type, practiced among elites as well as nonelites, includedspells and talismans for such purposes as finding lost articles, identifyingthieves, preventing illness, and so on. Those guilty of such activities, it wasthought, had fallen into superstitious ways and were to be corrected. By theend of the thirteenth century, a less common form of magic appeared, whatcame to be called ‘‘necromancy,’’ where access to Latin learning was a prereq-uisite.13Magic of this sort has been characterized by one expert as ‘‘learneddemonic sorcery [ . . . ] a highly structured variety of magic limited to a smallclerical elite.’’14The conflation at the end of the Middle Ages of such viewswas partly responsible for the caricature of the evil-intentioned hag, settingthe stage for the witch-hunts of the early modern period.15These theological innovations occurred against the backdrop of impor-tant historical events, including medieval heresies (e.g., Cathars), the Cru-sades, and such political and social upheavals as those created by theextermination of the Knights Templar and the Black Death of the mid-four-teenth-century. And, as one noted scholar in the area reports, despite theimportant codification of the church’s thinking about witchcraft in the laterMiddle Ages, nothing in the fifteenth century compares in importance to theshifts that transpired in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.16A synthesizingaccount of the medieval and early modern European witchcraft phenomenonsuggests that popular traditions about witchcraft and other forms of nonelitemagic in the medieval era evolved, and largely even merged, with elite beliefsystems. Thus, age-old slanders—used at first against Christians themselvesand later against the Waldensians and other heretics—were recycled to fit theemerging image of devil-worshipping witches.17The stage was thus furtherset for the great witch-hunts of the early modern era.With the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, elite society with-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4introductiondrew from the consolidated belief system that had given rise to the ‘‘hunts’’and was inclined to regard such beliefs as primitive. So changed is this per-spective among the upper classes that their disbelief evolves into a kind offascination with historical episodes of witchcraft that needed to be explainedaway as delusions, or as the product of a mass hysteria.18The seriousness ofpurpose evident in a text like Hutchinson’s famous eighteenth-century cri-tique of witchcraft ideology gives way over time to views in which the ideaof witches cannot be taken seriously in elite circles—although we have everyreason to suppose that beliefs about witchcraft continued to have vitality inpopular opinion.19Enlightenment rationalism led to ever greater disbelieftoward traditional witchcraft systems. In her splendid study of the shiftingviews in Sweden, Linda Oja finds what she calls a secularization of attitudes.20The subsequent reinterpretation of the early modern witch-hunts gave rise,for example, in Sweden to reproductions of tracts from the seventeenth-century witch-hunts and their presentation of the sabbat scenario.21Compila-tions of this sort satisfied the public’s appetite for gothic horror and producedin the book-buying public a lust for texts that centered on witchcraft as akind of spectacle.22By the end of the Nordic nineteenth century, more sober, if still popular,historical treatments of witchcraft and related topics were increasingly com-mon, sometimes with important considerations for the future use of the socialsciences in the study of witchcraft.23Studies written from the perspective ofintellectual and church history abound in the new century, but at about thistime, what might be regarded as a reaction against the top-down view ofwitchcraft gave way to the possibility of more popular origins for witchcraftbeliefs.24The most famous work to expound this view was Margaret Murray’sThe Witch-Cult in Western Europe(1921). Its revolutionary thesis that themedieval witches represented the survival of ancient European fertility tradi-tions created, the book’s many flaws notwithstanding, increased interest inunderstanding witchcraft from this popular perspective.25Although Murray principally focused on British data, it did not takelong for the book’s impact to be felt outside the Anglophone world. Her keynotion perhaps found most fertile expression in Northern Europe in ArneRuneberg’s sober and still very readable treatment of the topic,Witches,Demons, and Fertility Magic: Analysis of Their Significance and Mutual Rela-tions in West-European Folk Religion(1947). Nordic witchcraft scholarship,as exemplified in the work of, for example, Nils Lid, Bente Alver, GustavHenningsen, Jan Wall, and Kim Tørnsø, continues to value nonelite sources"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction5as a means for understanding what witchcraft was believed to be and howthe system as a whole functioned.26Hugh Trevor-Roper is widely credited with turning attention away frommedieval superstitions, the confessions of accused witches, and other effortsto discover folk beliefs about witchcraft and toward the question of socialattitudes, especially the degree to which it was indeed elite members of soci-ety, those few powerful political and ecclesiastical figures at the apex of soci-ety, whose instrumental roles shaped the nature of European witchcraft.27Inline with this hierarchical stance, the principal champion of cultural material-ism within anthropology, Marvin Harris, introduces his discussion of histori-cal European witchcraft in explicitly class-conscious terms, more or lessrecycling, if inverting, Michelet’s nineteenth-century peasant-revolt hypothe-sis: ‘‘My explanation of the witchcraft craze is that it was largely created andsustained by the governing classes as a means of suppressing this wave ofChristian messianism.’’28A more influential interpretation of the role of class relations in the caseof early modern English witchcraft came with Keith Thomas’s monumentalReligion and the Decline of Magic.29Similarly, Bengt Ankarloo’s breakthroughstudy of the seventeenth-century witch-hunt in Sweden,Trolldomsprocessernai Sverige(1971), made the case for the importance of carefully sieving the datawith such issues as the wealth, gender, and so on of the accused in mind,an influential Nordic example of a much larger tendency within witchcraftstudies.30Over the past several decades, scholars coming from differing disciplinaryallegiances—history, religion, anthropology, folklore, philosophy, literature,and so on—have put their shoulders to the wheel, occasionally borrowingmethodologies from other fields, often anthropology.31Particularly powerfulin structuring this inquiry has been the opportunity to understand the Euro-pean experience against the backdrop of important observedcomparandafrom such regions as sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas.32Few scholarshave had a deeper influence in this regard than Victor Turner, whose dy-namic, incident-specific approach became, and remains, a widely imitatedmethod.33It was at this point that the observations of anthropologists on theAfrican experience began to be turned to the historical European situation.34The suitability of the analogical ethnographic argument to historicalWestern European documents, although generally well regarded, has notbeen without its difficulties.35One obstacle has been the frequently insur-mountable differences between the realities of village-level observations and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6introductionthe uncertainties of reconstructed large-scale events, with their attendant ex-tralocal factors such as the strategies of the national secular and supranationalreligious authorities. A further complication has been the proliferation oftheories looking to interpret the data, many of them exceedingly helpfulbut almost always presented with a certain intellectual hegemonic quality.Historians have certainly felt the pinch that comes with interpretations thatdare to rely on multiple theories for getting at some central truth, as RobinBriggs rightly reminds us.36Yet after several decades of debate, the bipartite summary proposed byMacfarlane of the phenomena necessary for the formation of accusations ofwitchcraft in specific instances—‘‘firstly, the presence of some tension oranxiety or unexplained phenomenon; secondly, the directing of this energyinto certain channels’’—remains useful, tempered, as another scholar notes,by a newfound ‘‘emphasis on the need to reconstruct holistically the mentalworld of the participants in the trials, and a perception of the enhancedimportance of folklore studies and psychology in the interpretation of theHunt.’’37That scholars often find themselves struggling against the confinesof disciplinary walls is natural enough: after all, scholarship does not alwaysfit into neat categories, and any claims that suggest otherwise must be ad-justed by an appreciation for the realities of the synthesizing human mind.38Much of the scholarship on Scandinavian witchcraft, whatever its theo-retical orientation, has tended to focus on the post-Reformation situation,where the extent of the witch craze outbreaks is great, the imprint of elitewitchcraft ideology imported from the Continent readily apparent, and thedocumentation substantial.39Witchcraft in the Viking period and the earlyMiddle Ages, on the other hand, has long fascinated scholars but proved tobe an elusive topic for earlier generations, only slowly precipitating out of theevidence as much more than a shadowy survival of Norse heathendom.40Lately, however, there has been a veritable flood of research on magic andwitchcraft during the Viking Age.Among the many works to have appeared on pre-Reformation Nordicwitchcraft and magic, several important monographs stand out. Perhaps noother work tackles the question of magic as represented in the medieval Ice-landic sagas with quite the same vigor as does Franc ̧ois Xavier Dillmann’sextraordinary1986Caen dissertation,Les magiciens dans l’Islande ancienne:E ́tudes sur la repre ́sentation de la magie islandaise et de ses agents dans les sourceslitte ́raires norroises, recently revised and republished.41In this dense and richlytextured study, Dillmann argues for the historical value of the Icelandic sagas"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction7as repositories of earlier magical traditions. From his detailed observations,Dillman draws a number of intriguing conclusions about both the functionof magic in the pre-Christian Nordic world and the social status of its prac-titioners.42The erudition and learning of its author notwithstanding, the book isnecessarily limited by the fact that it largely allows the surviving medievalIcelandic sagas to define both the range of its inquiry and the nature of itsevidence.43Brilliant though they are, the sagas are first and foremost testi-mony to how thirteenth-century Christian Icelanders understood—andused—their forebears’ conduct and beliefs; to that must be added the factthat we possess, of course, only a fraction of the saga materials that onceexisted, a factor that further limits our perspective. Reconstruction from suchdata is possible but fraught with difficulties. Yet, within this confined rangeof sources, Dillmann ably and exhaustively demonstrates how the image thatemerges of the magico-religious world of the Viking Age might be character-ized as one that retains a functional magical component (power to divine,protect, and alter the weather, for example, but, curiously, relatively uninter-ested in influencing fertility), as well as, more revealingly, the reception andperception of those who practice it among their fellow Icelanders. This istricky terrain, not least because here Dillmann attempts to rescue for theninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries the attitudes of the publictoward magic and the psychological profiles of those who practiced sorcerythrough works written and recorded in the thirteenth and later centuries. Iam sympathetic to the mission and impressed by the author’s insights andindustry but am less inclined than he, as will become clear, to place faith injust how far we can utilize these late medieval narratives to reveal the mentali-ties of the Viking Age (as opposed to the later Middle Ages themselves).Of a very different attitude toward the sources is Catherine Raudvere’sKunskap och insikt i norro ̈n tradition: Mytologi, ritualer och trolldomsankla-gelser.44Writing from the standpoint of the history of religions, Raudvereundertakes a source-critical review of many of the same Icelandic sagas andeddic texts on which Dillmann’s study focuses. Raudvere, however, is moreskeptical about the prospect of teasing from these delicious late medievalnarratives insights into the magical world of Viking Age Scandinavians. Thatis not to say that she does not believe it possible to draw conclusions aboutthese beliefs, like Dillmann, largely basing her views on the products of Ice-landic literary enterprise. But in this instance Raudvere cautiously distin-guishes between what she regards as faux and echt testimony, seeing in some"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8introductionsaga examples ‘‘authentic’’ witness to pagan practices, but elsewhere Christianinterpolations and propaganda; moreover, Raudvere is careful to draw intoher discussion such adjacent disciplines as archaeology. In addition to magicand witchcraft, she takes up their relationship to the all-important arena offate and presses to new heights the possibility of precipitating ritual practiceand other performances out of the narratives.45Working from their perspectives as archaeologists, but with a deepknowledge of the textual materials, two archaeologists published studies in2002with a focus on magic and the question of gender. Brit Solli’sSeid:Myter, sjamanisme og kjønn i vikingenes tidargues for an understanding ofViking Age magical practices from the perspective of queer studies, specifi-cally the social construction, rather than a biological designation, of gender,a key factor in the consideration of O ́1inn’s purported role in the practiceofsei5r.46The evidence of material culture is certainly important to Solli’sconclusions but perhaps secondary to her theoretical explication and rumina-tions, which are powerful. Solli focuses on the Norwegian world and reliesfor much of her archaeological evidence on the so-called sacred white stones,with their apparent gender ambiguities, traits for which she plausibly positsanalogues within Old Norse mythology, such as the question of Nerthus-Njo\u0001r1r.47Although also concerned with these vexing questions of gender construc-tion, violence, and cognitive archaeology, but less dependent on a specifictheoretical orientation and more reliant on the material and textual data,Neil Price’sThe Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinaviarepresents a saltation event in our understanding of Viking Age mentalities.48Interested not only in the specific issue of magic and the practice ofsei5rbutalso in recapturing for Scandinavian history and archaeology the vital role ofthe Sa ́mi in the cultural evolution of the region, Price explores in both aSa ́mi-specific and more broadly circumpolar context the likely shared ideolo-gies and practices of shamanism among the indigenous Sa ́mi peoples andtheir North Germanic-speaking neighbors.49Price’s is a study that looks to provide a unified explanation for theparadox represented by Norse magic, with its apparent reliance on gender-bending practices (ergi) carried out in the context of perhaps history’s mostexplicitly homophobic culture. The answer, he argues, is to be found in theVikings’ need to produce effective battle magic through such shamanisticpractices, praxes that at the same time resulted in ‘‘nothing less than a viewof the nature of reality itself.’’50This ritualized aggression came at a cost, one"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction9that under normal circumstances would have been shameful and unthinkablewithin Norse culture, but that in the specific context of the practice of warand what he terms the ‘‘supernatural empowerment of violence’’ was under-stood to be worth the cost one had to pay.The Viking Waybreaks newground in assessing that world, extensions of our knowledge and methodolo-gies not easily captured in a short summary, one of which is surely its artfullybalanced appreciation for evidence of many different types from many differ-ent disciplines and regions. It also makes clear that the various modern de-bates from the past seventy years about the question of shamanism in Norsereligious practice raised important issues for which equally important andrevealing answers are now being formulated.51Despite their diverse areas of interest, differing approaches, and variedreceptions by the scholarly community, these recent monographs touchingon witchcraft in medieval Scandinavia share one feature: they are all princi-pally concerned with the Nordic world during the early Middle Ages, that is,the Viking Age (ca.800–1100). These studies, complemented by the oftenmagisterial studies on sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century Scan-dinavian witchcraft mentioned earlier, thus form two ‘‘bookends’’ in thestudy of Nordic witchcraft. What has largely gone missing concerning thisimportant meeting ground of church doctrine and vernacular belief systemsis the period between them, roughly the years from1100to1525, the subjectof this monograph. It is, after all, as noted earlier, precisely during these fourcenturies that we witness the accommodation of native views about magic,sorcery, and the supernatural to church teachings on witchcraft, and it isfrom these years that we first possess contemporary texts on these issues. Theexcitement over the possibilities of recovering the magical worldview of Vik-ing Age Scandinavia, on the one hand, and the concern to account for thedisturbing witch-hunts of the early modern era in the Nordic region, on theother, have generally led scholars to ignore or devalue the post-Conversionera.In fact, there has been a strong tendency among scholars of Nordicwitchcraft—despite the evidence suggesting that developments in the twelfthand thirteenth centuries were more important to the conceptualization andprosecution of witchcraft and other forms of magic in Europe than those ofthe fifteenth century—to regard the understanding of magic in that era asrelatively unchanged for much of the Middle Ages, with the principal shiftin thinking about witchcraft and magic in medieval Scandinavia comingabout in the fifteenth century.52"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10introductionTo be sure, these fifteenth-century developments were important, but itis manifestly not the case that a relatively unaltered perspective on paganwitchcraft and magic was suddenly transformed at the very close of the Nor-dic Middle Ages, as important and dramatic as some of these newly intro-duced changes were. The process had already begun centuries earlier as bothsecular and ecclesiastical authorities strove to gain, maintain, and exercisecontrol and power, as well as to ensure the spiritual and physical well-beingof their communities. Of course, these changes were often made as a directresult of clerical thinking flowing from the Continent. Thus such importantconsiderations of magic, sorcery, and witchcraft (and often also of inquisito-rial practice) as Pope Alexander IV’s decretal,Quod super nonnullis(1258),Bernard Gui’sPractica inquisitionis(1320), Nicolas Eymeric’sDirectorium in-quisitorum(1376), and Johannes Nider’sFormicarius(1437–38) help shapeNordic views about magic and its practitioners. Likewise, the canonical andpenitential writings of such important figures as Ivo of Chartres and Burchardof Worms were well known in Scandinavia.53On the other side of the diapha-nous membrane separating elite from nonelite attitudes were, of course, com-plex systems of traditional beliefs. These magical practices and views were byno means uniformly distributed with respect to region, livelihood, gender,status, or personal predilection, nor were they immutable entities: the charmmagic and other activities of Nordic ‘‘witches’’ were as subject to mutationand renewal over time as are any set of customary rites, especially ones thatare not monitored by a centralized authority.The degree to which specimens of medieval magic are to be understoodas residues of paganism has been much bruited about in recent years.54Thenotion that ‘‘all tradition is change’’ is widely accepted in folklore studies,and the truth of that idea is as relevant to the study of post-Conversion relicsof Old Norse religion as it is to other areas of customary behavior.55If suchpractices do not continue to be relevant, why would anyone continue toperform them, as one noted scholar in the field has asked, and the student ofmedieval folklore would do well to keep that thought in mind as much asdoes the student of contemporary folklife.56Still, in the case of the medieval Scandinavian world, although one mayreasonably debate the accuracy with which a particular Old Norse belief orpractice has been described and preserved, or the way modern scholarshiphas interpreted such phenomena, that there existed well into the Middle Agespractices and narratives whose roots can be traced back to pre-Christian timesseems so far beyond question as to be well outside the grasp of even the most"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction11ardent Christian triumphalist or other skeptic.57At the same time, it wouldbe naı ̈ve to assume that elements of pagan magic, sorcery, and witchcraftsimply continued to exist for centuries, completely unaltered by their Chris-tian contexts, or, more especially, by the Christians, even if only nominallyso, who used such charms or passed other sorts of numinous knowledge alongto subsequent generations.58Neither chunks of undigested paganism nor fan-tasies cut from whole cloth, magic and witchcraft in the Nordic Middle Ageswere constructed both ‘‘from below’’ by a populace (including elites) thatregularly employed them in their daily lives and ‘‘from above’’ by churchauthorities and others who feared, described, defined, and prosecuted them—and from whom, anything but incidentally, we get much of our information.As to the terms used in this study, the broadest is surely ‘‘magic.’’ As willprecipitate out of many of the discussions that follow, I am hard-pressed tosee in exoteric terms much essential difference between the magic elite mem-bers of society believed was being used by their social inferiors,59even thoughthey may have preferred to call these activities ‘‘superstitions,’’ ‘‘errors,’’ andso on, and the kinds of magic they themselves venerated, which they wouldcall ‘‘miracles.’’60Naturally there were critical differences between these two categories,critical at least in the minds of church authorities, based on the source ofpower that made them effective. A truism, as appropriate to the medievalway of thinking as it is of much modern scholarship, is that practitioners ofmagic—sorcerers, witches, cunning folk, and so on—manipulate that power,command it, ordering the source of power to do the performer’s will, whereasthe religious person comes as a supplicant, praying to the source of power.Writing of the first type, Valerie Flint notes, ‘‘Magic may be said to be theexercise of a preternatural control over nature by human beings, with theassistance of forces more powerful than they.’’61The latter part of Flint’s formulation conforms to the idea that the magi-cal practitioner commands these forces and hints at one of the most impor-tant aspects of the Catholic Church’s perspective on magic as a theologicalissue in the Middle Ages: thedaemones, those morally ambiguous spirits ofantiquity, have been collapsed with the biblical notion of the fallen angels.62The devil (diabolus) is principal among them and thus the prince ofdemons.63In the minds of the church, these demonic forces become thesource of power for medieval magicians and thus also the source of mostaccusations of witchcraft, where it is equated with heresy.64Occasionally, thejuxtaposition is quite straightforward: in an Old Swedish legendary, trans-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12introductionlated from foreign sources, for example, a pagan magician confronting aChristian commands (biudher) his devils to bind the saint, whereas the saintprays (or asks [badh]) for help from God’s angels.65Indeed, as we will see, formulations among surviving Nordic charmmagic fit the ‘‘manipulation versus supplication’’ model, with the imperativeform of the verb, not asking but rather commanding. So, for example, ‘‘Iexhort you, O ́1inn, with heathendom, the greatest of fiends; assent to this;tell me . . .,’’ as one Norwegian sorcerer carves in runes in attempting todiscover the identity of a thief.66The command to ‘‘tell me’’ (seg me ́r)isrepeated no fewer than three times in the inscription. The question is notpurely the technical matter of what form of the verb is used—after all, theimperative can certainly be seen in Christian runic inscriptions as well (e.g.,part of N289M reads, ‘‘Lord Jesus Christ, who is both God and man,hearmy invocation . . .’’ [drottinn jesus kristr sa er bæ5iergu5ok ma5r heyr akallmitt. . . ]), and such forms were common in the Latin mass.67The use ofhonorifics and introductory phrases (Te rogamus), however, indicate a markedif ineffable difference in expectation and attitude.Distinguishing between magic, on the one hand, and religion, on theother, by reference to this notion of ‘‘commanding’’ versus ‘‘imploring’’ isone held within the church from the time of the patristic writers (e.g., Au-gustine). It is also the most frequent means that scholarship of the last centuryand a half has used to distinguish the two categories. The modern parametersof this discussion were set in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centurieswith an eye toward the interrelated character of magic, science, and religion.68Frazer, one of the most influential figures in the discussion, in extendingTylor’s earlier views, argues that these concepts were to be understood histori-cally with an evolutionary perspective: magic is perceived as a kind of faultyreasoning about causality, which over time is replaced by religion, and that,in turn, gives way to science.69A different approach can be seen in the more socially oriented perspec-tive taken by Malinowski, in line with the earlier work of Durkheim andMauss. Famously living among the Trobriand Islanders, Malinowski urges anunderstanding of magic that is less evolutionary and that focuses instead onfunction. Toward that end, he sees magic as a result of anxiety: in situationswhere danger is present, technology stressed, and the outcome uncertain,magic addresses a psychological need. Magical beliefs, spells, and so on fill,as he wrote, ‘‘those gaps and breaches left in the ever imperfect wall of culture"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction13which [man] erects between himself and the besetting temptations and dan-gers of his destiny.’’70Considerations of the magic-religion-science triad have since the earlytwentieth century been carried out with these two opposing perspectives,Frazer’s and Malinowski’s, keenly in mind. Writing in the influentialEncyclo-pedia of the Social Sciences, Ruth Benedict argues, ‘‘Magic is essentially mecha-nistic; it is a manipulation of the external world by techniques and formulaethat operate automatically. Frazer names it therefore the science of primitiveman. Both magic and science are technologies, capable of being summed upin formulae and rules of procedure [ . . . ] although both magic and scienceare bodies of techniques, they are techniques directed to the manipulation oftwo incompatible worlds. . . .’’71By two incompatible worlds, of course,Benedict refers to the natural world and the supernatural world. Writing inthe successor encyclopedia three decades later, Nur Yalman insightfully cap-tured the essence of the debate by noting, ‘‘The core of the magical act restson empirically untested belief and is an effort at control—the first aspectdistinguishes it from science, the second from religion.’’72I find compelling a proposal made by Rosalie and Murray Wax that, Ibelieve, fits the evidence of medieval Scandinavian notions of magic: in aseries of articles, the Waxes proposed a different kind of paradigm to accountfor the category we call ‘‘magic.’’73In their ‘‘The Magical World View,’’ theWaxes make a case for viewing the continuum of magic-religion in a mannerquite different from the traditional manipulation versus supplication divi-sion: ‘‘Has our understanding been advanced by the attempted distinctionbetween manipulation and supplication? We think not. The facts are that thecultic practices of the magical world exhibit a variety of relationships to be-ings of Power. Sometimes these are supplicative; sometimes manipulative;sometimes a forthright embodiment of kinship reciprocities; and so on.’’74Their basic premise, that the relationship to ‘‘Power,’’ is what matters, strikesme as a highly relevant concept in considering the lingering acts of paganism,perceptions of syncretism, and so on that we witness in the medieval Nordicrecord. Power, here essentially synonymous with effectiveness, is surely whatmagical practitioners sought, not theological purity.With respect to the third member of this group, science, it is importantto bear in mind that, in the Middle Ages, what was understood as a form ofnatural science does not always appear that way to modern observers. Inthat context, Kieckhefer concludes that ‘‘intellectuals in medieval Europerecognized two forms of magic: natural and demonic. Natural magic was not"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14introductiondistinct from science, but rather a branch of science. It was the science thatdealt with ‘occult virtues’ (or hidden powers) within nature. Demonic magicwas not distinct from religion, but rather a perversion of religion. It wasreligion that turned away from God and toward demons for their help inhuman affairs.’’75Finally, a brief word or two about the terms ‘‘sorcery’’ and ‘‘witchcraft’’:one can, following a well-established tradition in anthropological usage, arguethat the basis of the former has to do with its uses of the magical toolkit, itslearned character, and so on while the latter is associated with those whopossess a more intuitive power to harm others.76I believe, however, thatwhen these terms are used in standard English, it is very difficult to escape acertain gender bias: in our hearts, we recognize that a sorcerer ‘‘is’’ a man anda witch a woman, historical realities, our intellectual dispositions, and astream of scholarship notwithstanding.77The point is that it is difficult forus to escape the way we use these terms in contemporary speech. I have forthe most part looked to acknowledge the gender questions involved by usingthe two terms, if not as equivalents, then at least with keen awareness of thisproblem, noting gender marking in the original languages where it is impor-tant. In my mind, a witch, or a sorcerer, whatever her or his magical kit,was an individual who in the minds of contemporaries had and used specialknowledge that allowed him or her access to abnormal or increased amountsof Power (to employ the Waxes’ orthographic convention). The definition ofwitchcraft is, in the end, a dynamic human perception rather than a boundedentity; that is, its meaning derives most importantly from behaviors thatwere regarded as acts of witchcraft rather than from the appearance or otherattributes of individuals believed to be witches. To do otherwise, of course,leads to all the stereotypical portrayals of witches—the hag, the seductress,conical hats, black cats, and all that—a perspective that also has its place indiscussions of this sort, to be sure.A useful definition of witchcraft takes its principal cues from the socialinteractionism associated with Victor Turner’s work in Africa.78At its core, adefinition based on this perspective is, to exploit Turner’s evocative expres-sion, dynamic rather than static, that is, one might say that it is composed ofverbs rather than adjectives and nouns—‘‘she killed,’’ ‘‘he cursed,’’ or ‘‘theypoisoned,’’ rather than assemblages of ‘‘eye of newt and toe of frog’’ andother ingredients or personal and often physical characteristics such a pendu-lous breasts.And this view comports well with medieval perspectives too: in an Old"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction15Swedish translation of Bernhard of Clairvaux (1091–1153), for example, it issaid that the sin of witchcraft and witches, specifically female witches, isresistance or opposition (genstridh) to obedience, underscoring the idea thatit was behavior rather than articles or attributes that defined the term.79Simi-larly, medieval Latin usage commonly employed the termmaleficiumto des-ignate witchcraft, a term that derives from ‘evil doing.’ The samefundamental pattern accounts for many of the words used in Old Norse forthose who practice magic, male and female (e.g.,fordæ5uma5r, gerningakona),which are often built onda ́5‘deed’ orgerning‘act, doing, deed’ (\u0002gerningar‘witchcraft’).

Moreto the point, perhaps, what sort of evidence is not? Church statutes, amulets,court records, runic inscriptions, pictorial representations of witches, and soon all have their parts to play. Interpreting bygone cultures clearly requiresus to have access to ‘‘data,’’ the information-laden detritus that history capri-ciously bequeaths to us. Having collected it, scholars grandly organize thesematerials into what we trust are sensible taxonomies and refer to the resultswith all-too-obvious high hopes as ‘‘databases’’ and the like.

In the case of the present study, the resources available to us arenot unlike the situation faced by our hypothetical future students of twenty-first-century Christianity in that, like them, we are dealing with a choruscomposed of many different voices, with a far less centrally harmonized li-bretto in the pre-Christian era. Studies of medieval popular culture, andmedieval popular religion in particular, frequently note different sociologicallayers—generally bifurcated into elite versus nonelite. Even this view, whichsees, as one scholar summarizes it, ‘‘two distinct cultures, the one clerical andbookish, the other popular, oral and customary, the first accessible throughtraditional intellectual and spiritual categories, the second mainly throughcultural anthropology and comparative religions,’’ fails to appreciate ade-quately the complexity of the systems under discussion.1How then do thereligious systems and demographics of medieval Scandinavia impinge onour—and its—understanding of witchcraft?The Cultures, the Sources, and the MethodGiven the monolithic stereotype of Scandinavia, it is important to underscorethe rich diversity of the medieval Nordic world, an area that spanned muchof Northern Europe, including Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroes, of course,but also Shetland and parts of insular and coastal Scotland; it also includedmodern-day Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and Gotland to be sure, butalso parts of coastal Finland and other areas around the Baltic littoral, andextended south into modern Germany. Complex not only in geography butalso in cultural terms, late medieval Scandinavia possessed both Alpine andmaritime economies, rich farmlands, mines, courts, international trading cen-ters, remote valleys, and isolated farms, and the people, foreign-born andnative, speakers of various Germanic, Finnic, and Balto-Slavic dialects, to gowith them.2In brief, the political history of Scandinavia in the later Middle Ages canbe characterized as one in which a period of growing Norwegian influencebecomes one of rapidly expanding Danish hegemony, followed by a century-long effort by Sweden-Finland to free itself from this arrangement, a featfinally managed in the1520s.3By the late thirteenth century, a muscularNorway had control of Iceland, Greenland, the Faroes, Shetland, and Orkneyand wrestled with Scotland over its continued possession of the Hebrides—itis indicative of the period that King Ha ́kon Ha ́konarson died in Orkney in"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18chapter 11263, following a mostly inconclusive invasion of Scotland over the very issueof the Hebrides. Marriages arranged between the various Scandinavian royalhouses led to the birth of Magnus Eriksson, son of the powerful Swedishduke,ErikMagnusson,andIngibjo\u0001rg, the daughter of King Ha ́kon ofNorway.Magnus thus technically became king of Sweden and Norway through-out much of the fourteenth century, followed by a brief period during whichSweden was governed by Albrecht von Mecklenburg. Growing German in-fluence, especially from cities like Lu ̈beck through their role in the HanseaticLeague, was an important factor in many of the political, linguistic, andcultural developments of late medieval Scandinavia, rivaled in significanceonly by the mid-fourteenth-century arrival of the Black Death. Through dy-nastic marriage arrangements, political upheavals, and a series of deaths,claims to all three Nordic crowns could be made toward the end of thefourteenth century by Margarethe of Denmark, under whose influence theso-called Union of Kalmar was forged in1397, in theory creating a unitedpolitical entity of Scandinavia under a single monarch. The history of thefifteenth century is largely framed by the struggles of Sweden-Finland towrest its independence from the Danish crown, something finally accom-plished under Gustav Vasa’s leadership in1523.4The impignoration to Scotland of Orkney in1468, followed in1469bythe similar mortgaging of Shetland, further diminished the Danish empireand removed from the Nordic world the last vestiges of its former possessionsin the British Isles. By the end of the medieval period, the Nordic world thusconsisted of a Swedish-Finnish kingdom and a still very impressive Danishkingdom, including Norway, Iceland, and the Faroes. Although certain prov-inces were hotly contested, especially border areas such as Ska ̊ne and Bohus-la ̈n, for the most part these areas did not take their present places on thepolitical map until the seventeenth century; Gotland, traditionally a broadlyautonomous region within the Swedish orbit, fell to Denmark in1361anddid not come under Swedish rule again until1645.5Trade ensured lively communications between such increasingly impor-tant Nordic emporia as Bergen, Copenhagen, and Stockholm, and theirDutch, British, German, and other Baltic counterparts.6With the conversionto Christianity came the rapid growth of a church infrastructure and religioushouses, and Scandinavia too took its place among the recently converted invenerating local saints—for example, Saint Knu ́tr and Saint Knu ́tr Lavard inDenmark; Saint Magnu ́s in Orkney; Saint4orla ́kr in Iceland; Saint O ́la ́fr in"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past19Norway; Saint Sigfrid, Saint Botvid, and Saint Erik in Sweden; and SaintHenry in Finland—as well the remarkable Saint Birgitta of Sweden (1303–37), who was officially canonized.7The image of daily life that emerges from,for example, the original and translated (and almost always also transformed)literature of the Nordic Middle Ages is extremely rich and can give modernreaders a vibrant sense of that world.8For all the diversity apparent in the Nordic world, there exists a moderntendency to divide its population along simple lines into a ruling elite, onthe one hand, and an unlettered peasantry, on the other, institutional versusnoninstitutional entities (also often vicarial representatives for Christian andpagan, one suspects, and a host of other dyads necessary for the descriptionof medieval Scandinavia, such as noninsular and insular). Although not with-out its advantages, this view of the Middle Ages tends to assume, for example,that a medieval fisherman believed in and practiced magic, whereas a monkdid not. In all likelihood, both of them did.This elite versus nonelite model of the medieval world has been criticizedand challenged in recent years, and instead of a simple bifurcation betweenclerical and lay, elite and popular, and so on we should bear in mind that amore nuanced and synthetic image comes by envisioning individuals in termsof their relation to a number of factors, not just those two poles.9The resultsprovide a more rounded and realistic view of lived lives and do not automati-cally slot individuals into proscribed behaviors, allowing us to see from ourmaterials that priests, princes, and wealthy merchants, for example, were justas capable of a ‘‘magical worldview’’ as farmers, laborers, and prostitutes.10In fact, the Nordic world is rich in resources for the student of medievalpopular culture, perhaps especially where witchcraft is concerned: a widearray of nonnormative texts provide insights into how the image of the witchwas constructed in the Scandinavian world, providing opportunities for us tosee realities that go beyond condemnations of magic and its practitioners byauthors representing church and state.11Broadly speaking, we look to eithermaterial objects, such as paintings and talismans, or narratives, that is, textsand monuments in one sense or another, for our knowledge. About all ofthese materials—laws, literature, historical chronicles, synodal statutes, let-ters, skaldic poems, sermons, charms, prayers, the visual arts—the same ques-tions need to be asked: not just when and where they were written, but alsofor whom, to what purpose, under what sponsorship, and so on. Among thedocuments most influential in shaping attitudes toward witchcraft, of course,were those authored by, for, and within the church. Prohibitions against"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20chapter 1witchcraft and magic were developed and promulgated first and foremostby this tissue-thin—if deeply influential—segment of society, together withsecular authorities, and it is overwhelmingly their views that inform standardvisions of medieval Nordic witchcraft. But in addition to these institutionalimages of witchcraft, it is important to keep in mind opportunities to dis-cover additional perspectives and attitudes, ones that reflect the full spectrumof society, not just its apex of educated elites.12Despite modern assumptions about the uniform vision that Christianityhad of witchcraft, ecclesiastical works are no more monolithic than otherforms of narratives. Hagiographies, spiritual literature in the vernacular,homilies, miracle collections, prayer books, synodal statutes, and penitentialscollectively suggest trends in medieval thinking about magic and witchcraftamong learned ecclesiastics but do not present a uniform impression. Fortheir part, legal texts represent an area with considerable overlap betweenchurch and state: the reticulation between these two poles of authority wasgreat at the time the materials were codified, and many of the medievalNordic law codes specifically include sections relating to religious life (e.g.,kyrkobalker).13An attractive nuisance I hope to have avoided in working with thesematerials is the assumption that the more official the source of our informa-tion, the more its data should be trusted. Scholarship has found this cautionto be especially true of such presumed gateways to truth as court documents,whether ecclesiastical or secular, to which a modern audience naturally at-taches significant probative value.14In addition to these official narratives, adiverse network of unofficial sources of information exists, a designation notintended to deny the influence of the church, either direct or indirect, on thematerials. Paramount among these sources are the Icelandic sagas, to whichmay be added a wide array of other resources, including runic inscriptionsand other evidence of charm magic. In many respects, the goal of reconstruct-ing medieval mentalities has advantages over studies that want to establishhistorical facts, as for our purposes even texts patently invented and fabulouscan be of great interest; moreover, their lack of historical verisimilitude neednot only fail to concern us but can even be a help, insofar as they allow usinto the thought world of medieval Northern Europe.15With the possible exception of the archaeological record, perhaps ourbest and most direct indication of prevailing, popular views of witchcraft andmagic in the immediate post-Conversion era is to be found, not among thejustly celebrated literary texts of medieval Iceland (in which category one"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past21might reasonably include large numbers of the mythological works), butrather among the early laws of Scandinavia. None of these codes, at least inthe form in which we have them, is old enough to provide direct testimonyon the eleventh century, but several of them may have originated soon afterthe Conversion. Many of them specifically legislate against pagan practicesand may be among our most reliable opportunities to see the raw data ofearly Nordic witchcraft, that is, views about this world that have not beenmasticated by the brilliance and narrative purposes of later Icelandic sagawriters.Thus, for example, the statutes governing the western fjord area of Nor-way,Gula7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Gula7ing), preserved mainly in thirteenth-century manuscripts but believed to have been recorded first a century earlierand to have even older oral roots, hint broadly in this direction. In a sectioncalled ‘‘Concerning Prophecy and Witchcraft’’ (Um spa ́r oc um galldra), thelaw declares that people should believe in neither ‘‘soothsaying, witchcraftnor maleficence’’ (spa ́m ne golldrum ne gerningum illum) and goes on to enu-merate penalties for those who harbor such beliefs or practice them.16Admonitions of this sort, despite their general wording, are neverthelessa good indication of the negative attitudes held by elite society in medievalChristian Norway toward the practice of witchcraft and sorcery but in them-selves detail little about the nature of such beliefs and behavior.17Somethingcloser to such an itemized litany of practices appears in the law code for theOslo fjord area, the Borgar3ing laws, which are, like the Gula3ing code,datable to the mid-twelfth century, although preserved only in later, mainlyearly fourteenth-century, manuscripts:II.25. But if a woman bites off a finger or toe from her child anddoes that [in order to secure] long life, she is fined3marks. Theworst witch is she who destroys a man or woman or child or cow orcalf. And if sorcery is found in bedding or bolster, the hair of a man,or nails or frog feet or other talismans which are thought wont inwitchcraft, then a charge may be made[. . . . ] That is a felony if onesits out and rouses trolls thereby. That is a felony if one kills oneself.That is also a felony if one journeys to Finnmark for soothsaying.18This and related texts are taken up in later chapters, but at this juncturesuffice it to say that this enumeration of charges connected with the practiceoffordæ5uskapr‘witchcraft’, ‘sorcery’ is striking, especially given the specific-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22chapter 1ity of the charges. It suggests an active tradition of manipulating the universethrough charm magic and rituals.To reiterate an earlier point, the existence of a law of this sort from theearly era of Christianity in Norway against such behavior does not guaranteethat such activities were actually practiced in the earlier pagan world or thatthey continued to exist in the post-Conversion world of medieval Norway.Still, few would doubt that we can indeed read out of these texts practicesand beliefs (whether ‘‘real’’ or invented) that were current at the time the textwas written—and that a well-developed witchcraft complex existed already inthe earliest periods from which we possess reliable textual data from medievalScandinavia.19A further important window onto that world, and one that inherentlynullifies the problems of contemporaneousness and cultural distance that at-tach themselves to textual sources, is provided by the archaeological record.And the attention of archaeologists is increasingly turning to matters of spiri-tual culture in the Nordic world.20Finally, after years of working in relativelyatomistic parallel universes, such necessarily interrelated fields as folklore,history, philology, and archaeology are once again recognizing the advantagesof a comprehensive approach to such subjects as witchcraft, magic, and reli-gion, what Neil Price, in the most important study of this phenomenon todate, calls ‘‘an archaeology of the Viking mind.’’21Yet those interested mainly in texts are not entirely without a direct, ifoften enigmatic, material image of pagan spiritual life, namely, the runicinscriptions that hark from both the pre-Christian and Christian eras. Butthese sources, if direct, are nevertheless not without their troubles, as special-ists in the field are wont to remind us.22Key to our understanding is the factthat although the content of certain inscriptions may correctly be understoodas relating to the magico-religious world of pre-Christian and Christian Scan-dinavians, the writing itself is no more or less ‘‘charged’’ than it would be ifit were written in a Latin script on vellum.The inference that certain runic inscriptions derive from magical prac-tices does not require great leaps of faith: to take a Viking Age example, theninth-century Nørre Næra ̊stone (DR211), from the Danish island of Fyn(Odense amt), is one of a number of so-called grave binding runic inscrip-tions. Its imprecation apparently calls on the dead to remain still and not towander: ‘‘Make good use of the monument!4ormundr.’’23No mere bit ofwell-wishing or celebration of a relationship to the deceased, this monumentintends to prevent the dead man from coming back and haunting the living."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past23It is a form of charm magic writ large. The practice of charm magic canalso be seen in a small twelfth-century amulet from the Swedish province ofVa ̈stergo ̈tland: ‘‘(I) practice witchcraft against the spirit, against the walking(spirit), against the riding, against the running, against the sitting, against thesinking, against the travelling, against the flying. Everything shall [lose] itsvitality and die.’’24The linguistic and runic forms of the amulet suggest thatit comes from the same era as the Christianization process in this region ofSweden; moreover, it was found in the cemetery of a church likely to havebeen contemporary with it.25Thus it is important to recognize that we cannotknow for certain whether we are here dealing with a charm that should beunderstood against a pagan or Christian background. Very likely it is a transi-tional monument, that is, one whose basic form harks back to the pagan erabut whose user may well have been a Christian, an appropriately ambiguousstate of affairs as we consider the complexity of medieval Nordic society andthe resources it offers us for research.26So, how should we approach such confoundingly ambiguous medievalevidence? Modern interpretations of European witchcraft have naturally beenformed in their own intellectual context, often reflecting the views of theperiod in which a given study is produced.27Thus early students, who foundthe possibility of witchcraft actually existing impossible, could see in thewitch-hunts little more than mass hysteria, yet more recent views have in-creasingly teased out of the same accusations of witchcraft the empowermentof early modern women.28A social context for knowledge is natural, andcertainly in recent decades, studies of historical witchcraft have needed to becognizant of a variety of factors that condition our understanding.29An area of inquiry particularly well suited to an investigation of this sort,of course, is folklore. Maximizing the opportunities offered by this fertileintersection of the humanities and social sciences has not been without itschallenges in modern scholarship, especially to the degree that folklore (orfolkloristics, as some prefer) is often pared away from its adjacent fields. Thisproblem is common in Anglophone scholarship, but by no means limited tothat world. Indeed, this debate is one that has had far-reaching effects in theNordic world, a cultural region that has itself played a critical role in theshaping of folklore studies.30In the context of a study largely concernedwith medieval folklore, especially Nordic concepts of magic and witchcraft,a collection of essays by the preeminent Nordic folklorist concerned with thisissue, Dag Stro ̈mba ̈ck, is worth noting. Published asFolklore och filologi(Folk-lore and Philology), the author introduced the collection with the comment"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24chapter 1that they, and he, belonged to that folklore school which traced itself back toMoltke Moe in Norway and Axel Olrik in Denmark.31Stro ̈mba ̈ck subse-quently spelled out what he meant by noting his dedication to ‘‘the Scandina-vian philological discipline and the critical-historical method,’’ which hedescribes as ‘‘the approach which interweaves historical fact, philological in-terpretation and textual criticism. . . .’’32That one can approach the folklore of the bygone Scandinavian world,the medieval period in particular, through the tools of contemporary folklor-istics is, as Stro ̈mba ̈ck notes, an important issue.33The history of folklorescholarship in Scandinavia, a region beset by issues of colonialism and postco-lonialism, has been one conditioned by nation-building and nationalism,most obviously in the cases of Finland, Iceland, and Norway, but also trueelsewhere.34And, indeed, many, perhaps even most, cultural institutions andacademic pursuits at the end of the nineteenth century were harnessed to thesame nationalistic yoke, even the seemingly rarified disputes about such top-ics as the character of Icelandic saga origins (i.e., the so-calledFreiprosavs.Buchprosadebate), the nature of the Nordic ballad, and the dissemination offolktales. Out of the subsequent exchanges surrounding these issues, vonSydow noted that ‘‘collaboration between philology and the study of folkloreis of supreme importance. Philologists can produce much material of verygreat value to folklore research[. . . . ] But the oral material is no less impor-tant for placing the contents of the ancient sources in the living whole towhich they belong. . . .’’35This dictum is of obvious importance to thestudy of medieval witchcraft, with its copious and highly variegated sourcesof information.On the current relationship between folklore and philology, RichardBauman suggests the philological model of the past as one possible charterfor the future of folklore: ‘‘The enduring importance of the intellectual prob-lems that the philological synthesis was forged to address constitutes a pro-ductive basis on which we as folklorists might orient ourselves to our cognatefields and disciplines.’’36In a characteristically more strident manner, vonSydow argued much the same thing when he wrote that it was, after all,philologists who had discovered folklore’s scientific value and that mutualcooperation ought to be the standard relationship between the two disci-plines, especially as they are each other’s ‘‘necessary assistants.’’37One caneasily imagine that the same thing is true of ‘‘ancillary’’ fields such as history,sociology, and anthropology.Perhaps best represented by Jacques Le Goff—in particular his inclusive"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past25view of how folklore should figure into our understanding of the MiddleAges—we have in recent decades entered into a new understanding of thefield of medieval folkloristics.38It can no longer be understood as merely abranch of textual criticism but as something of an archaeology of past mental-ities and a recontextualization of performance practices.39This highly trans-disciplinary view, which looks to integrate the methodologies and strategiesof a number of fields, is the modern understanding I take to what the fieldof folklore can mean to the study of medieval witchcraft and magic and,more generally, medieval cultural history.40Pagan Scandinavia and the ConversionMagic in pagan Scandinavia, as it has been reconstructed from the writingsof foreign observers, the archaeological record, and—not least—the textswritten in cultures tracing their ancestry back to the Viking world (mostprominently, Iceland), suggests that many people were able to call on, andeven command, supernatural powers. After the Conversion, Christian observ-ers associated these activities with the church’s evolving image of witchcraftand sorcery. Beyond such simple assumptions, however, there is little we canbe certain of regarding the belief complexes, religious practices, and mytho-logical systems from this early period, as they overwhelmingly come to usfrom several hundred years after the acceptance of Christianity. What sort ofpicture can we confidently draw about the world of Nordic magic before thewidespread adoption of Christianity? And beyond the attempt to reconstructScandinavian paganism, how does magic ‘‘work’’ in the medieval Christianworld, not only in the most transparent sense of the term, but also in the wayin which magic itself becomes a kind of metalanguage for communicatingperceptions and important ideas about what it meant to be a pagan or aChristian?This problem of perception, especially where the so-called Frazerian trip-tych is concerned (i.e., magic, science, and religion), can be illustrated by afew examples drawn from medieval Nordic leechbooks.41One recommendsthat the gall of a black dog, or of a particular kind of fish, be burned in awooden vessel and used as a remedy against witchcraft and diabolical influ-ences.42A Danish formula against wantonness calls for a potion made of theleaves of a plant mixed with liquid, although what makes it stand out is theinstruction that the brew should be blended while thePater nosteris being"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26chapter 1‘‘read.’’43Modern readers naturally assume that recipes of this sort are a formof magic.But how would medieval users have understood such practices? If a prac-titioner were to intone phrases invoking a pagan god or the Christian deitywhile burning the fish gall, for example, would we understand it as a religiouspractice? Or if the fumes of the gall were believed to have a specific chemicalor pharmacological purpose, should we then understand this practice as akind of primitive science? And are the answers we give to these queries merelyelusive matters of perspective, or are they in fact hard and fast conclusions,as true in the modern context as they would have been in pre-ChristianScandinavia?And for that matter, just what is pre-Christian Scandinavia? Christianmissionary efforts in the Nordic world were diverse with respect to theirpoints of origins and successful only over a long period of time. Taking theSwedish area as an example, the conversion effort begins by at least the earlyninth century, with Ansgar’s missionary ventures to Birka, but Christianitycannot be said to have been the dominant religious culture until well intothe eleventh century, perhaps even later.44In1075, for example, the heathenSwedes are said to have deposed their Christian king and replaced him withhis pagan brother-in-law, ‘‘Sacrifice-Sveinn’’ (Blo ́t-Sveinn). Traditions aboutevents of this sort eventually gave rise to an Icelandic literary portrait ofSweden in later centuries as a backward, heathen holdout.45Although wemay look with deep suspicion on the reliability of these later accounts, justhow long the deep-rooted pre-Christian practices associated with such talesmay in fact have continued in remote districts will no doubt remain an areaof unresolved dispute for some time to come.After all, it is precisely from the image of rural—and thus, from theperspective of the dominant society, culturally peripheral—inhabitants thatthe two words most commonly used in English for people holding on totheir pre-Christian religion are often said to be fashioned: ‘‘pagan’’ (derivedultimately from Latinpa ̄gus‘country, rural district’) and ‘‘heathen’’ (possiblyderived from Old Englishhæ5‘untilled, uncultivated land’).46Language is vital but cannot, of course, tell us everything. Archaeology,and its focus on material culture, has certainly shown itself to be of para-mount importance and is providing exciting and valuable new vistas fromwhich to view witchcraft and related magical practices in these preliteraryperiods.47So too have recent investigations utilizing the subsequent textualrecord,48perhapsespeciallywhenthatrecordisexaminedcomparatively,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past27against the important backdrop of adjacent cultures, the Sa ́mi in particular.49Although we assume that the complex set of late medieval Nordic beliefsrelating to witches and magic evolved from (and within) native traditionsunder heavy influence from imported views brought by Christianity, it isimportant to recognize as well the probable roles played by the various Finnicpeoples of Scandinavia.50What, then, did magic look like in the Nordicworld at the time of Christianity’s arrival? Although no attempt at a fullaccount of witchcraft in those earlier periods is intended here, it is certainlyhelpful to have a grasp of these pre-Christian traditions. Toward these ends,this section briefly reviews several of the main deities from Norse paganismconnected with magic, as well as examples of missionary efforts in Scandina-via and the ways in which the metalanguage of magic figures into them.The modern image of pre-Christian religion in Scandinavia is one thathas been drawn from non-Icelandic sources, such as Saxo’sGesta Danorum(History of the Danes), and, principally, from the literary traditions of Iceland-ers several centuries after the Conversion—thePoetic edda, Snorra edda,andthe sagas, as well as the tradition of skaldic poetry (e.g.,Haustlo\u0001ng).51It isdifficult not to be drawn to these rich materials, with their vivid story linesand memorable characters, but at the same time, few scholars today accept atface value that these mainly thirteenth-century texts mirror with accuracy theactual belief systems of the farmers, traders, raiders, concubines, and kings ofthe Viking Age. Many layers of selection, interpretation, and obfuscation liebetween us and that world, just as they did for the medieval Icelanders.Thus, for example, much of the mythological material preserved in liter-ary tradition, almost all from Iceland, focuses on the numinous and sexualexploits of O ́1inn, but a variety of reasons—tied to sponsorship, the medievalIcelanders’ perceptions of their history, and, not least, O ́1inn’s close relation-ship to poetry and chieftainship—may account for his popularity in theselater traditions that color so greatly our perception of his importance in thelives of everyday people in the pagan world. Despite the near omnipresence ofO ́1inn in the texts, the evidence of theophoric place names from throughoutScandinavia, for example, strongly suggests that other gods and goddesses,including some who do not emerge distinctly from the literary sources, werevery significant in the religious lives of people throughout Viking Age Scandi-navia. Hence, for example, Ullr is mentioned in eddic poems andGesta Da-norum,but whereas he is a rare figure in the texts, the name so often formspart of the built landscape of parts of Sweden and Norway as to suggest thathis worship may have extensive.52The lesson here is that we must constantly"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28chapter 1bear in mind the possibility that we possess a highly skewed version of Norsepaganism.Still, the preserved stories tell us something, and they frequently concen-trate on the exploits of the gods O ́1inn and4o ́rr against thejo\u0001tnar‘giants’and other representatives of the Otherworld, such as the World Serpent. Weare often told of the attempts by the giants to possess various goddesses,Freyja in particular. Other narratives describe such events as Freyr’s acquisi-tion of Ger1r; how the gods’ citadel is built; how the two families of gods—the Vanir and the Æsir—resolve their dispute and exchange hostages; howthe soteriological figure of Baldr comes to be killed; and the defeat of thecurrent generation of gods at the final battle,Ragnaro\u0001k‘fate of the gods’.Magic, too, emerges from these tales and is associated, as we shall see in detaillater, with two figures in particular, O ́1inn and Freyja.Briefly, the sources paint a portrait of O ́1inn as the master of magic: heshape-shifts, awakens and speaks with the dead, sees into other lands, workscharms, knows how to use the magic calledsei5r(which allows him to lookinto the future and inflict death, misfortune, and other harms on men), andknows the whereabouts of treasures and how to retrieve them. Freyja is por-trayed as a female counterpart to O ́1inn, a great offerer of sacrifices and theone who teaches the Æsirsei5r, a form of magic common among the Vanir.So certain does the relationship between Viking Age women and magic seemthat several scholars have even sought to apply to the magical traditions of theNordic region in the Viking Age the much earlier statement by the Romancommentator Tacitus (Germania8) to the effect that women held a markedprophetic status among the various Germanic peoples, a view also reflected inCaesar’sGallic Wars(1.50).53Against a seemingly highly patriarchal pantheon,dominated in the extant narrative materials by the lusty sexual adventuresand arcane knowledge confrontations of O ́1inn,4o ́rr, and other male deities(and, where magic is concerned, spiced with the possibility of shamanisticinfluences), the role of females in the world of gods and humans has becomean area of increased attention by scholars.54Of female deities, only Freyja (toa lesser degree, Frigg and I1unn) receives much attention in the survivingtexts. In assessing the saga reports about those Icelanders who practiced magicin this earlier period, some scholars have seen the gender ratio as beingroughly equal; other researchers focusing on the mythological materials haveemphasized the role of female deities endowed with magic as well as of sagawomen who wield magical powers.55A telling indication of Freyja’s prominence in Nordic paganism is re-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past29flected in a bit of poetic rhetoric from the history of the Conversion: just asthe debate between paganism and Christianity reaches a crescendo in Iceland(ad 999), Hjalti Skeggjason publicly assails the old religion by making up aditty, which he concludes by saying, ‘‘I consider Freyja a bitch.’’56For hisblasphemy, the Icelanders outlawed Hjalti. The connection between Freyja’smore frightening attributes and subsequent constructions of the witch figureis readily made, as are the transfer of her positive aspects to the Virgin Mary.57Although the somewhat slender mythological materials treating the goddessesmay prove to be an important resource on Nordic witchcraft, the reality oflater Christian mediation in selecting what has been preserved and how it ispresented clearly represents an awkward impediment against employing thesemedieval literary texts as a direct window onto the Viking Age itself beforethe Conversion.58A more direct view of pagan practice may be offered by recovered mate-rial objects, although these items are no more free from problems of interpre-tation than are texts: they are more or less randomly preserved, oftenrecovered alternatively in paradoxically very precise and very imprecise waysand always ‘‘read’’ according to human designs.59Since the earliest recogni-tion that such things as serendipitously discovered artifacts bore a relationshipto the preserved Norse mythological texts, scholarship’s understanding ofpre-Christian Nordic religion has relied on archaeology. Conclusions drawnfrom modern scientific research at cult sites (e.g., Uppa ̊kra in Ska ̊ne) andIcelandic temple-farms (e.g., Hofsta1ir, Hrı ́sbru ́) seem to confirm just howthoroughly magic and its rituals formed part of not only pagan worship butalso daily life.60With respect to magic in the Viking Age, recent archaeologi-cal interpretations have focused on gender, and especially transgressive genderroles, as key elements in its practice.61Wary, one suspects, of the museum-cum-warehouse approach to archae-ology and ethnography, Neil Price’s exemplary study of magic and warfarein Viking Age society looks to move the discussion of daily religious life inthat period well beyond a catalogue of the bric-a-brac of magic, the serendipi-tously preserved incunabula of day-to-day magic, and place his field closerinstead to realizing what has been termed cognitive archaeology.62Followinga close inspection of the ritual form of magic, much referred to in our laterliterary sources, calledsei5r,Price compares this reconstructed magic ritualwith an analogous Sa ́mi practice callednoaidevuohta.63He examines both ofthese rituals in the broader context of shamanism (itself a much debatedterm, especially when presented as a single bounded entity), of whichnoaide-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30chapter 1vuohtais surely an example andsei5rmight well be, and finds confirmationfor this perspective in everything from the material remains of the graves ofsorceresses (vo\u0001lur) to written Arabic and Norse accounts. Price argues thatthe magic of the Viking Age and the aggression it helped channel were boundup in the mythological figure of O ́1inn, making this curiously Viking-specificform of shamanism a kind of ‘‘battle magic’’ and a view of reality.64Price’s synoptic study also offers us an explanation for one of the strangeraspects of Viking Age magic, namely, the evident use of practices with sig-nificant gender implications (ergi) in a society notably hostile to such notions.He reasons that acquiring effective battle magic through such gender-chal-lenging shamanistic practices resulted in ‘‘The Viking Way’’ of his title.65Price provides us with a detailed image of what place magic had and what itspractice might have looked like in the pagan era—or to put it another way,what the face of magic may have looked like when the missionary efforts inScandinavia began in earnest.Dating the conversion of the various regions of the Nordic world toChristianity tends to be a matter of providing the year in which ruling mon-archs or leading statesmen accepted the new religion—between965and985for Denmark, around1000for Norway, and the same for Iceland. AlthoughSweden had a Christian king as early as1008, even enthusiastic partisanswould not claim it as a Christian nation for nearly another century.66Thistendency is natural enough, for these are the dates that history, and especiallythose who wrote history in the Middle Ages, have bequeathed to us. But thetruth is that the conversion process began much earlier than any of thesedates and was surely not fully articulated throughout the Nordic world untilafter many more generations had passed.No one knows with certainty, for example, the name of the first Scandi-navian who actually received theprima signatioor converted fully to Chris-tianity.67On the other hand, we can say with authority who finally, someearlier efforts notwithstanding, brought Christianity to the Nordic world:Ansgar (801–65), the so-called Apostle of the North.68According to his vita,Ansgar undertook his missionary activities at the behest of Scandinavian rul-ers, first to Denmark and then to Sweden. Perhaps the most notable aspectof Ansgar’s efforts among the Danes was the education of young natives,resulting in a school with a dozen or so boys. Taking careful advantage ofboth political and commercial opportunities to promote Christianity, Ansgarreceived permission from the Danish king to build a church in Hedeby, verylikely also the site of the school. Importantly, Rimbert notes that the presence"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past31of a priest brought much delight to those Danes who were already Christians,that is, he specifies, those who had been baptized in towns such as Dorstadtand Hamburg, and that this Christian entree into the Nordic world easedthe prohibition against Christian merchants plying their trade in the paganworld.69Ansgar’s reception and missionary work in the Swedish trade center ofBirka in829and thereafter is given detailed treatment by Rimbert, whovividly portrays the confrontation between the native and foreign faith sys-tems. The Swedish king receives Ansgar’s company well and grants thempermission to preach the gospel. Their work finds favor among the Christianslaves held in Birka—their presence no doubt a key reason for the mis-sion—as well as among some of the pagan natives, most notably an officialof the town, Herigar. So devout does this convert become that Herigar is saidto have had a church built on his own land. Ansgar departs, leaving behinda small, but apparently vibrant, congregation of Christians. Years later, how-ever, pagan resentments—ascribed by Rimbert to the devil—lead to an upris-ing, during which one of the Christian priests is killed and the others drivenaway. The vita then employs several vignettes to illustrate the tribulationsinvolved in working with the northern pagans.In one of them, Rimbert relates a Job-like story in which miraculous, ormagical, events have a central role. It concerns an important pagan’s son whohad taken part in the attack on the mission and secreted his portion of theloot in his father’s house. Thereafter the father’s fortunes decline, his herdsdecrease, and his son, wife, and daughter die, one after the other. Feelingthat he must have offended one of the gods, the man follows local customand consults an oracle, who casts lots and discovers that it is the god of theChristians who is angry with him because of what turns out to be a purloinedbook taken from the mission, a manuscript he goes to some lengths to getback into Christian hands.70After several years’ absence, Ansgar sends a representative to Birka, andwith Herigar’s help, Christian services begin anew. Now, however, there aremore direct if less violent confrontations between Norse paganism and thenew religion: at an assembly meeting, for example, praise for the traditionalgods is mixed with reproach for Herigar for his having separated himselffrom the community by adopting the foreign deity. Through an importantseries of miracles—that is, what must have seemed to the pagan Swedes,like the earlier story of the stolen book, to be Christian magic—Herigardemonstrates the greater power of his religion.71"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32chapter 1Yet, despite the tenacity of this Christian outpost, another century and ahalf would pass before we hear of a Swedish king being baptized; moreover,the Svea region itself would not be Christianized until some250years afterAnsgar’s mission. This point underscores a key element in the present discus-sion: Conversion dates presumably reflect the behavior and decisions of a fewelite members of society. Given the preference of the missionaries to worktop down, changes of faith and practice among the populace as a whole musthave filtered in only very slowly.An imposing monument to the conversion process is the tenth-centuryassemblage of rune stones and other materials at Jelling in Jutland.72One ofthe rune stones proclaims that King Haraldr made the Danes Christian.73However true this statement may be in the broad sense, there is little likeli-hood that its assertion that the king ‘‘made’’ (or declared legally or the like)the Danish people Christian actually speaks to the conversion experience oflarge numbers of Viking Age Danes: perhaps they simply followed thecrown’s declaration of Christianity as empty ritual observations lacking per-sonal meaning, but just as likely, they were motivated by economic or othernonspiritual opportunities, or perhaps the Nordic experience in Anglo-SaxonEngland,74or even by opportunities for personal spiritual growth, possiblyespecially for women in the community.75Or perhaps it was none of thesepossibilities; perhaps the average Jutlander simply ignored the whole thing.But one thing we do know: narratives in the Middle Ages about theconversion experience of the Danes emphasize the moment when Christianmagic—a miracle—tipped the scales in favor of that religion. According tothis story, as given first in Widukind’s history of the Saxons, the tenth-cen-tury Danish king Haraldr Bluetooth challenges the view that Christ is theonly god. Poppo accepts the challenge and is reported to have carried glowinghot iron in his hands and then shown the king that he remained unharmed.By virtue of this feat, the king converts, ordering that his subjects shouldthenceforth reject idols.76In fact, magic, often dueling pagan and Christianmagic, is a frequent phenomenon in conversion tales.The key role played by pagan magic and its practitioners in the confron-tation between heathenism and Christianity, such as Rimbert describes atBirka and Widukind for Jutland, is highlighted in the life of the Norwegianmissionary ruler, O ́la ́fr Tryggvason, king of Norway from995to999(or1000). O ́la ́fr had been a renowned Viking in the British Isles before returningto Norway and becoming one of the figures most closely tied to its conversionto Christianity, at least in Icelandic and Norwegian traditions.77But among"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past33the oldest sources of information about O ́la ́fr is Adam of Bremen’s Latinhistory of the Hamburg-Bremen archbishopric, the see charged by the Catho-lic Church with the conversion of Scandinavia. Basing his narrative not onlyon the archives available to him in Bremen and such written sources as Rimb-ert’sVita Anskariibut also on personal interviews with King Sveinn of Den-mark in the late1060s, Adam gives us a picture of O ́la ́fr some sixty-odd yearsafter his death.78Adam’s O ́la ́fr inGesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum(History of theArchbishops of Hamburg-Bremen) is a dissolute apostate, angry at God forhaving allowed him to be driven into exile. Not only is O ́la ́fr’s embraceof Christianity depicted as questionable, but in O ́la ́fr’s necrologue, Adammaintains—with a churchman’s eye toward the topic—that the king washimself a practitioner of pagan magic, specifically an augur, a reader of lots,and a diviner of bird behavior, and known by the cognomen, Cracabben(presumably from Old Norsekrakabein‘crow bone [or leg]’).79Indeed, Adamreports that not only was O ́la ́fr himself an adept of the ‘‘magical arts’’ (artismagicae), but also allowed his household to be composed of witches (ma-leficos).80By contrast, later West Norse sources portray O ́la ́fr as utterly resolute inhis determination to promote Christianity in his homeland and to wipe outpaganism, especially to the extent that the vitality of the heathen world canbe gauged by the practice of pagan magic. In Snorri Sturluson’sO ́la ́fs sagaTryggvasonar(The Saga of O ́la ́fr Tryggvason), for example, King O ́la ́fr declaresthat all those who traffic in magic must leave the country,81and he then hasthe area searched for suchmen.82Having brought the sorcerers together, theking provides them with strong drink at a feast and then has the building setablaze.

They approach the king’s quarters under the cover ofmagic, but as they do so dawn breaks, and the magical darkness that hadmade them invisible now envelopes and confuses them.85King O ́la ́fr’s troopscapture the sorcerers, and the king orders that they be taken and bound on askerry, where Eyvindr and the other witches are drowned with the incoming"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34chapter 1tide. It should be noted that from a narrative perspective, the principal im-portance of this incident is to establish the framework for the immediatelyfollowing episodes, in which the king is first confronted by, and defeats, thepagan deity O ́1inn and subsequently compels the recalcitrant franklins of4ra ́ndheimr to accept Christianity. Essentially the same story about Eyvindrand O ́la ́fr—with an even more heightened confrontation between paganismand Christianity than in Snorri’s version—is recounted in theO ́la ́fs sagaTryggvasonar en mesta(The Longer Saga of O ́la ́fr Tryggvason).86The image ofKing O ́la ́fr as a fierce missionary hero thus emerges in many West Norsesources, includingA ́grip af Noregskonunga so\u0001gum(A Synoptic History of theKings of Norway) andFagrskinna, another panorama of Norwegian history.87It would be difficult indeed to reconcile the distinctly disparate imagesof O ́la ́fr Tryggvason textual history offers us.88If we are to coax meaning outof the dislocation created by the dueling pictures of O ́la ́fr the grudging apos-tate and O ́la ́fr the fiery zealot, we may want to take a page from anthropolo-gy’s field notes: ethnography long ago demonstrated how, given similarinstances of opposing narratives among living peoples, reconciling antipodalpoints of view can be perhaps precisely the wrong approach. Writing of ex-actly this kind of conundrum in Kachin society with competing origin myths,Edmund Leach notes, ‘‘Neither of these versions can be said to be morecorrect than the other [. . . . ] Now, in the past, Kachin ethnographers havenever appreciated this point. They have regarded tradition as a species ofbadly recorded history. When they have found inconsistencies in the record,they have felt justified in selecting that version which seemed most likelyto be ‘true’ or even in inventing parts of the story which appeared to bemissing.’’89How often do philologists, historians, folklorists, and other scholarsworking in nonliving traditions commit this same crime against their data byimposing a unifying meaning without recognizing either the implicit debateinvolved or, as in this instance, the idiom of that argument?90In the case ofthe Kachin, Leach is able to show how the conflicting narrative traditions ofcompeting clans are not usefully explained if they are merely viewed as factualerrors in need of straightening out, but rather shed light only when they areunderstood as part of a larger dialogue: ‘‘It is a language of argument, not achorus of harmony.’’91The element common to both Adam’s eleventh-century presentation andthe later Icelandic tradition is the way both narratives seize on and valorizepagan magic as a means of demonstrating O ́la ́fr’s relationship to Christianity,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past35tepid as it is in the one case in which O ́la ́fr is a magician, and zealous as it isin the other when he rids the land of such people.92It is a fair suppositionthat neither the West Norse nor the Dano-German portrayal of O ́la ́fr reflectsdeep concern for historical verisimilitude, and we can safely assume that bothportraits tell us less about the historical O ́la ́fr than they do about how thevarious authors responded to complex cultural forces. What matters hereis the idiom the two traditions have selected for this implicit debate—themetalinguistics of witchcraft and magic.Magical acts, whether Christian miracles or pagan divination rituals,draw, after all, on a common experiential foundation, what one noted scholarcharacterized as ‘‘a region in which the evidently real and the imaginary seemto overlap . . . ,’’ an area where prospective converts and evangelists sharedconcepts, beliefs, and perhaps even language.93Magic may not only have beenuseful when it was believed to have invoked the supernatural or ‘‘worked’’ inother ways, but was, as the examples of Herigar, O ́la ́fr Tryggvason, and manyother conversion histories show, also valuable for its implicit communicativevalue. Or, as one might express this idea, magic is not only good to practicebut also good to think with.94In Christianity’s confrontation with paganism, magic was fraught withpossibilities, and by no means were all of them negative from the church’spoint of view. True, its practice was a palpable embodiment of heathen wor-ship, and as such, magic, at least magic that called on the old gods, neededto be eradicated. Yet the concept of magic also embodied a kind of discourse,or at least the possibility of discourse, between pagan and Christian, a meta-language that could communicate complex ideologies on a high plain.95Magic as the basis for a system of communication between pagans and Chris-tians should not be surprising. In fact, the binary character of the Christianmagic–pagan magic dyad represented a highly productive way to think aboutthe special nature and value of magic and religion in the no-man’s-land ofturn-of-the-millennium conversion activities.96Like other paired cultural categories that constitute society’s system ofsigns, pagan and Christian magic overlap significantly yet also differ mark-edly. Speaking to how cultures employ such conceptual categories, Leachelsewhere notes, ‘‘Certain binary concepts are part of man’s nature—e.g.,men and women are alike in one sense yet opposite and interdependent inanother; the right hand and the left are, likewise, equal and opposite, yetrelated.’’97The value of such binaries derives from the fact that they arecritical to humanity’s capacity for symbolic thought.

Look, it is going to rain. . . .’’98Little wonder then that reports of missionary efforts often center aroundcompetitions between Christian magical acts (miracula), on the one hand,and whatever magic the worshippers of native gods can muster, on the other.At one level, naturally, such tales offered prospective converts the possibilityof tapping into a more powerful source of magical authority, of gaining au-thority and might, but these contests were also exchanges of ideas. Storiesabout the varying efficacy of pagan and Christian magic were a form ofcommunication, where magical acts represent the competing faiths and com-peting deities; where, contrary to modern Western aversion to the reality ofmagic, the actuality of magic is readily accepted and only its source of poweris debated; where pagan and Christian practitioners could exchange examplesof their magic and, most important, the power of their deities, just as individ-uals exchange words in verbal duels.99The conversion to Christianity was notjust a struggle aboutwhatwas to happen, but also abouthowit was to comeabout.Thus, with an almost modern scientific sense for experimentation, theauthor ofBrennu-Nja ́ls saga(Njal’s Saga), writing centuries after Rimbert,sets up the following test in his presentation of the conversion of Iceland:knowing that a warrior, a so-calledberserkr, is coming, the Christian mission-ary,4angbrandr, challenges his still-pagan hosts to test the powers of theirdiffering faiths. They will light three fires, he suggests, one that the paganswill consecrate (vı ́gja), and one to be consecrated by4angbrandr, while thethird ‘‘control’’ fire will remain unconsecrated. If theberserkris frightened by4angbrandr’s fire but unafraid of the pagan fire, then they must adopt thenew faith.100Predictably, when this fearsome warrior arrives, he moves un-troubled through the pagan-hallowed fire, but when he gets to4angbrandr’sfire, he dares not cross it and says that he is burning all over.4angbrandrstrikes theberserkr’s arm with his crucifix and a great miracle takes place (var5jartegn sva ́mikil), in which theberserkrdrops his sword and is dispatched.As a result of this magical competition,4angbrandr’s host and all of his"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past37household are baptized.101Importantly,4angbrandr proclaims beforehand,as had Herigar, that he is offering the pagans the chance to test which faithis better (at7e ́r skulu5reyna, hva ́r betri er tru ́an). Although we have littlereason to accept the historicity of the scenario as it relates to the tenth cen-tury, its widespread use in saga literature notwithstanding, it is easy to seehow thirteenth-century authors employ the idea of magic as a way to praiseChristianity and demean paganism.102Magic used as a metalanguage lasted for a long time: with respect to itsvalue as a means of expression, it hardly seems to matter whether the text isfrom the ninth or thirteenth century, consumers of this kind of story con-tinue to understand the message. The key element in a scene of this sort isthe display of God’s power over that of the pagan gods: for all we know,4angbrandr and his pagan competitors may have hallowed the fires by simi-lar, even identical, technical means, but what was important was the sourceof the power they invoked to affect the ends they sought—a fact that willgain importance as the Middle Ages progress.103The fire-consecration com-petition between4angbrandr and the pagans come near the end of his mis-sionary activities in Iceland: it is true that he has previously, with somesuccess, converted a few Icelanders by persuasion, but he has also fought aduel about the competing faiths, using a crucifix for his shield,104been subjectto attack by sorcery,105and had a pagan woman ‘‘preach’’ (bo5a) to him atlength about the native gods, who, she claimed, had been the ones responsiblefor his earlier shipwreck.106If magic in its abstract form constituted a special system of signs in loftypagan-Christian dialogues about religion, it was also at a mundane level cen-tral to a wide variety of everyday activities—protection from illness, shelterfrom supernatural forces, assistance in childbirth, foresight about weatherand harvests, recovery of lost articles, and so on. Christianity looked to sup-plant many of these purposes with its own devices—with saints’ relics, holywater, crucifixes, devotional medals, and the like—but it could neither do soimmediately nor expect to supersede entirely long-standing traditions usedfor the same purposes.107The persistence of various indigenous practices inScandinavia lay in part with the unwillingness, inability even, of the popula-tion to relinquish them, as well as the fact that throughout the era of mission-ary activity, the church showed itself willing to accept, or to adapt, nativepractices to its own ends when it could not decisively deal with them moreexpeditiously.108How this practice influenced the character of Nordic witch-craft and magic in the later Middle Ages is integral to our story."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38chapter 1Given Western historiography’s tendency toward Christian triumphal-ism—with, as it is often presumed, its complete, uniform, and evenly distrib-uted spiritual hegemony over all postmillennial events, institutions, andregions in Scandinavia—the possibility of pagan beliefs having survived forlong periods after the Conversion in the north has generally been dismissedout of hand. Admittedly, the terms used in the languages of medieval Scandi-navia for the change of faiths may appear to strengthen this impression:re ́ttsnu ́ning,si5askipti,umva ̈ndilse, and so on build, like their English counter-part, ‘‘conversion,’’ on the idea of turning away from one faith and towardanother one.109Implicitly such language gives rise to the impression that the‘‘turn’’ is a quick one, although there is nothing in the data that demandssuch an interpretation. The alternative position, one that accepts a moregradual shift in popular attitudes toward a Christian norm, including signifi-cant reinterpretation of past practices within the emerging dominant culturalparadigm, has not been an easy one, not least because of the often unreason-able and far-reaching claims of its early advocates.Still, the notion of a generations-long process is exactly the image thatemerges from the widely cited pronouncement in Icelandic saga literatureabout the Conversion, in this instance, like the earlier examples, drawn fromthe thirteenth-centuryBrennu-Nja ́ls saga.The text says that, after the discordcreated by4angbrandr’s mission to Iceland, at the next national assemblythe Christian and pagan Icelanders, after naming witnesses, withdrew theprotection of the law from each other.110Bedlam follows, but in the end, theIcelanders select the pagan priest (go5i)4orgeirr fra ́Ljo ́savatni to declare howthey should proceed. In what is perhaps the most famous scene in all ofmedieval Scandinavian literature,4orgeirr spends an entire day with a cloakover his head without anyone speaking to him.111When he reaches his con-clusion,4orgeirr asks for and gets sureties from both parties that they willabide by his decision and then declares that henceforth the Icelanders shallbelieve in one god—father and son and holy ghost—and forsake all idolatry(skur5go5avilla, lit., ‘carved image heresy’).4orgeirr then specifies two otherpagan practices that will also have to be renounced—the exposure of infantsand the consumption of horse flesh. He further enumerates how the questionof feast days should be resolved. And, importantly,4orgeirr adds the follow-ing codicil: it will be considered a matter worthy of outlawry if anyone openlypractices the old heathen ways, but if they are done secretly (leynliga) the actwill go without punishment.112The saga’s author then adds that within a fewyears all heathenism is forbidden, whether practiced openly or secretly.113"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Past39Naturally the sentiment expressed here and elsewhere about the possibil-ity that post-Conversion Icelanders continued to worship the pagan gods insecret has occasioned a great deal of speculation about how fully and howquickly Christianity replaced the worship of O ́1inn,4o ́rr, Freyr, Freyja, andso on. It is impossible to know today how accurately the statement attributedto4orgeirr reflects possibly tolerant views on this issue in eleventh-centuryIceland, but it is clear that later historians and saga authors felt it vital toinclude the idea so as to demonstrate the unity displayed by the Icelandersand the reasonableness they showed at the point of there ́ttsnu ́ning.Moreover, there were, as one scholar has remarked, ‘‘bridges’’ in cult,custom, and worldview between the old and new faiths that could, and did,serve the Christianization process.114Among the best known of these oppor-tunities are the widely discussed uses of the pre-Christian gods and heroeswell into the Christian era. That a representation of Gunnar in the snake pit,for instance, a scene drawn from the legend of Sigur1r the Dragon-slayer,should decorate a number of medieval Nordic churches and baptismal fontsmay baffle a modern observer at first blush, but clearly such appropriationsmade a great deal of sense to their contemporary audiences.115Pagan ritualswere even sometimes incorporated into Christian worship and given a Chris-tian interpretation: it has been argued that pagan traditions of feasting, beerbrewing, and ritualized beer consumption are adapted into Christian obser-vance (see Chapter2).The tendency has been, however, to assume that this portrayal of a slow,and, if correct, tolerant and perceptive, Christianization process cannot beaccurate, and there has been a general disinclination on the part of academicsto venture back into this hotly debated arena. Yet after a prolonged period ofrelative obscurity, and nearly embarrassed silence, the twin questions of pagansurvivals and pagan-Christian syncretism have risen again to positions of re-spectable scholarly debate.116It needs to be noted, however, that not all ques-tions of ‘‘survivals’’ and so on are the same. A very helpful contribution tothis question is the distinction made between different types of syncretism:one kind of syncretism takes place at the level of elements, that is, individualaspects of an old religion that have been accommodated to the new faith,whereas the other type of syncretism functions at the level of systems, wherewhole segments and ideologies have been transferred.117In the case of theNordic materials, as far as scholarship has been able to make out, we areoverwhelming faced with the former rather than the latter, and, if anything,syncretism at the level of systems has probably been imposed onto the pagan"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40chapter 1Nordic religion in the centuries before the Conversion rather than the otherway around.Influences could run in both directions, as the well-known embrace ofthe Germanic-derived terms ‘‘God’’ and ‘‘hell’’ into the Christian vocabularyamply demonstrates. Surely some dramatic changes accompanied the adop-tion of Christianity in the various Nordic cultures, but just as the belief thatsome elements of the old religion may have survived the Conversion doesnot argue for a tradition of underground worship, secret cults, or the like,neither does the Christianization of the Nordic world necessarily lead to theconclusion that all vestiges of the old faith were suddenly eliminated.118Certainly Nordic sources themselves support this case: the annals of theIcelandic settlement,Landna ́mabo ́k(Book of Settlements), comment on Helgi‘‘the Lean,’’ a Norse settler said to have been fostered in the Hebrides andreared in Ireland, that he was a man of mixed faith, being a Christian butcalling on the pagan god4o ́rr when making sea voyages or when in difficul-ties.119That we are told these details about Helgi depends, of course, on thecontinuation of the entry about Helgi, which serves to cast doubt on theusefulness of4o ́rr’s assistance. As Helgi approaches Iceland, he inquires of4o ́rr (gekk hann til fre ́tta vi58o ́r) about where to land, and sails further north.Helgi’s son then asks whether he would be willing to sail all the way to theArctic if4o ́rr showed him the way.120The scenario this episode poses—thatsome Norsemen may have attempted to fold Christ into the pagan pantheonor otherwise accommodate both faiths—mayreflect the genuine experiencesand attitudes of some early Nordic Christians, but as our oldest attestationof the story comes from the thirteenth century, prudence demands that weunderstand it rather as an attempt to show the foolishness of putting faith inthe old gods rather than as a mirrorlike reflection of an actual conversionbiography.Significantly, several redactions ofLandna ́mabo ́kconclude by notingwidespread apostasy in early Iceland. A number of Christians were amongthe settlers, most having come from the British Isles, but although some ofthem remained Christian until death, that was uncommon in most families.Among them, their sons built temples and sacrificed, and the country wasfully heathen for nearly120years.121We can only speculate, of course, butone wonders if, to the degree this view is accurate, the early settlers in thisfirst new world colony did not find the everyday rituals and magic of pagan-ism more comforting than their Christian counterparts."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter2Magic and Witchcraft in Daily LifeBronislaw Malinowski, one of the principal shapers of scholarly debate aboutthe function of magic, bluntly wrote early in the last century, ‘‘There are nopeoples however primitive without religion and magic.’’1Despite the lack ofconsensus about such so-called universals, few observers would disagree thatspiritual life—religion, magic, and so on—represents an area where humanbeings demonstrably share common impulses across time and space.2Andthe desire to influence events, to look into the future and manipulate it, isthe beginning point of what for some is the defining evolutionary pattern inhuman history, moving from magic to religion to science.Key to understanding this human instinct is what has famously beencalled the ‘‘magical world view,’’ that is, belief in causation, a world wherenothing is accidental but rather the result of the actions of others, stimulithat can be interdicted and altered.3Not only does this ideology bear directlyon the nature of witchcraft, but it is also intimately related to virtually allareas of daily life in the Middle Ages. Indeed, it is not difficult to understandthe power of this satisfying view of life and why the theory of causation isnot merely a useful analytic tool for scholars. It is central to the culturalconstruction of witchcraft because the ‘‘magical world view’’ allows for thediscovery of how individuals and communities are beleaguered and by whom.Once identified, the community can deal with them through various sociallysanctioned means, such as countermagic, exile, or execution. But it is impor-tant to realize that the same theory of causation that can identify witches andexpose them to justice also provides supplicants with power, with the possi-bility of securing their health, of improving their financial circumstances,of preventing accidents, of coaxing better production from their fields andherds—in short, of managing their fates, not merely being subject to them."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42chapter 2Historical accounts, archaeological evidence, poetry, prose, and everyother means of understanding the Nordic Middle Ages tell us that the ‘‘magi-cal world view’’ was, in fact, its dominantWeltanschauung, both before andafter the conversion of Scandinavia to Christianity. Yet the language used bythe dominant Christian culture to describe many of the magical practices ofeveryday life associated with the past—what in English is called ‘superstition’but more transparently termedhindrvitni‘hinder knowledge’,vantru ́‘unbe-lief ’, and so on in the Nordic languages—inclines modern observers to as-sume that magic had relevance only in the lives of nonelites.4But nothingcould be further from the truth.With respect to nomenclature, many terms in the older Scandinaviandialects describe what we would today broadly regard as charms, magic, andso on. But their use is not evenly distributed. Icelandic sagas and other narra-tive sources typically employ a very wide array of locutions in referring toincantations and spells (e.g.,a ́lag,a ́kvæ5i,atkvæ5i,galdr,taufr) and their use(e.g.,magna,sı ́5a,taufra,trylla,vitta), verbs meaning ‘to enchant’, ‘to charm’,‘to bewitch’. But such descriptions as we get from legal and other less literarysources tend to be more restrained, usually mentioning only something likea person being apprehended in an act of witchcraft, as when, for example,the late thirteenth-century Swedish laws of Uppland call for a homicidalwitch to be taken to the assembly for trial ‘‘together with the articles of herwitchcraft,’’ or when the Danish laws of Jutland blandly talk of homicide‘‘through witchcraft.’’5Yet even here the distribution pattern of terms is unequal, as the Norwe-gian laws often use a more explicit range of activities than those of Swedenand Denmark. Thus the Norwegian Gula3ing laws talk not only about notengaging in ‘‘soothsaying, incantation, or wicked sorcery,’’6but in a supple-ment from the early fourteenth century, add a wide array of activities, includ-ing being a ‘‘troll-rider,’’ a soothsayer, a believer in the land spirits, and onewho ‘‘sits out’’ to discover the future.7And within the Swedish tradition, thefurther back in time the law, the more diverse and colorful the language thatis used, as in the famous passage from the early thirteenth-centuryA ̈ldreVa ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Older Law of Va ̈stergo ̈tland) concerned with the gate-ridinghag.Whether these patterns demonstrate an increasing adherence withinNordic jurisprudence to evolving European norms, both legal and with re-spect to the nature of witchcraft and away from native traditions, or merelydemonstrate the more restrained nature of the codifiers’ language, the rheto-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Daily Life43ric of those who dealt semiprofessionally with acceptable evidence within theNordic legal system, is difficult to know. But as this chapter explores, therecan be little doubt but that medieval Scandinavians were every bit as subjectto Malinowski’s observation as any group he had in mind when he wrotethat there exist no peoples without magic.Pagan and Christian MagicChristianity may have changed Scandinavia forever, but it did not change itovernight. As the history of missionary activities in the previous chaptermakes clear, no cultural saltation event precipitated an immediate and abso-lute dividing line between old and new throughout Nordic society, whateverthe impression generated by modern timelines of the conversion process. Topursue the biological metaphor further, gradualism rather than saltation isthe process that emerges from the evidence. If, for example, some magicalpractice were believed to be effective before the dominance of Christianity,would it automatically have been discarded after the Conversion? And if ahandy bit of heathen magic remained in use after Christianization, adaptedto the new faith, would we recognize it today?8In all likelihood, the answershere are ‘‘no’’ and ‘‘maybe.’’An example of the sort of transformation that may have been common,and of the difficulties that face us, comes from the Christian law section ofthe Norwegian Gula3ing laws. This law is concerned with beer brewing andthe celebratory consumption of the brewer’s art at specific times of the year,which, the law says, is to be done as a means of giving thanks to Christ andMary for abundance (i.e., abundant crops) and peace (til a ́rs ok til frı ́5ar).9This very same tradition appears to have been widespread already in paganScandinavia and figures prominently in various sagas and other historicalsources: in his thirteenth-century edda, for example, Snorri Sturluson notesof the god Freyr that he is a deity to whom it is good to pray ‘‘for abundantharvests and peace’’ (til a ́rs ok frı ́5ar), precisely the formulation used in theGula3ing Christian laws.10InHa ́konar saga A5alsteinsfo ́stra(The Saga ofHa ́kon A5alsteinsfo ́stri), Snorri enlarges this image by describing a great hea-then sacrifice at yuletide, during which toasts in honor of the various godsare drunk, including one to Freyr using that same phrase, ‘‘for abundantharvests and peace’’ (til a ́rs ok frı ́5ar).11That a tradition of brewing ale forthe purpose of celebrating pagan deities at festivals was adjusted to fit the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44chapter 2Christian milieu is widely accepted by modern scholarship. It is a form ofsyncretism, a special kind of ‘‘cultural loan shift,’’ representing not, of course,the continuation of paganism as such, but an adaptation of old customs tonew conditions and new interpretive frameworks.12Supporting the likelihood of such continuities, or loan shifts, is the factthat many issues—health and sexuality, for instance—transcend the conver-sion from paganism to Christianity: they were of the same central concern toone group as to the other. So too with respect to care for the dead—and theliving: where a pre-Christian pagan inscribes a memorial for a dead man withsuch protective words as ‘‘May4o ́rr hallow this mound,’’13or ‘‘May4o ́rrhallow the runes. . . . ,’’14Christian Scandinavians formulate the same ideainstead as ‘‘May Michael protect his spirit,’’15or ‘‘May God and the holymaiden protect his [scil., soul].’’16And where a Christian might hope tosafeguard his health by bearing an amulet with the inscription, ‘‘May Godprotect the one who carries me. . . . ,’’17a pagan’s periapt declares, ‘‘May4o ́rr protect him. . . .’’18The structures and mentalities of these passages are broadly comparable,although the pagan entreaties focus on the tangible, whereas the Christianprayers tend to focus on the soul of the departed. And clearly the powers towhom the prayers appeal differ. The wording of all such invocations embod-ies the purpose of every type of magic, whether pagan or Christian. It is, asone venerable scholar in the field observes, ‘‘to impose the human will onnature, on man or on the supersensual world. . . .’’19But the difference tothe Christian observer is the context as well as the powers called on. Althoughessentially the same magical paraphernalia are sometimes used, the evalua-tions of such items are strikingly dissimilar and entirely framed by whetherthey are thought to be connected with pre- or post-Conversion Scandinavia.So, for example, the medieval Norwegian laws denounce the use of pop-pets made of dough and clay and make it clear that the practice is condemnedbecause it is a vestige of homeopathic magic belonging to the old pre-Chris-tian religion (til hæidins sidar).20Yet when a very similar object plays a role aspart of a saint’s life, it is equally clear that praise and glory are intended.Thus, according to a miracle attached to the vita of Saint Katarina (d.1381),the first abbess of Vadstena cloister and daughter of Saint Birgitta of Sweden,when a resident of Arboga falls gravely ill, his friends promise that he will goon a pilgrimage to Katarina’s grave and there present the image of a humanbeing made from wax (de cera). Through Katarina, the sick man miraculouslyimproves and is able to make the pilgrimage, and the episode concludes with"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Daily Life45the man’s praise of God’s work through Katarina.21Again, the pagan poppetand the Christian anthropomorphous image are obviously analogous prac-tices (perhaps even historically connected), but because of the sources of thepowers involved, one set of circumstances leads to condemnation, the otherto the declaration of a miracle.As these examples demonstrate, the differences between what might beconsidered ‘‘village-level’’ superstition, charm magic, and witchcraft at oneextreme and the activities associated with the ‘‘high’’ magic of elite and oftenclerical culture at the other are not always easy to gauge. In fact, a debateraged throughout the thirteenth and subsequent centuries among the neo-Platonists about the precise dividing line between such activities as goeteia(or theurgy),maleficium, and simple charm magic, such as the wearing ofamulets.22A fine example, known in Scandinavia and elsewhere in NorthernEurope, combining elements of all the traditions—Christian, pagan, learned,and so on—is the advice to write on lead the opening words of the Gospelof John (‘‘In the beginning was the word . . .,’’ known as theIn principio)asacharm against elves, apparently to be carried as an amulet.23To most medievalScandinavians, however, as a practical matter, the critical distinction wheremagic was involved must surely have been one thing and one thing alone—efficacy. Terminological and taxonomic debates concerned with high and lowmagic would no doubt have been meaningless to them, even if refashionedas questions of natural magic versus demonic magic. Nor were pagan andChristian worldviews in opposition in every way: both perspectives benefitedfrom what might be termed practical magic. The Conversion stories in whichpagan magic competes with Christian magic suggest that the membrane sepa-rating them was often diaphanous indeed, having mostly to do with thesource of their power.Still, if medieval Scandinavians were principally concerned with the effi-cacy of magic, they were also aware of the differences between the two types,a fact underscored by the vocabulary for magic and witchcraft. A completeinventory of terms for magic, witchcraft, and so on shows that the lexiconcould be broad, as when Saint Birgitta lists magical practitioners of differentsorts, including witches, pharmacognosists, and soothsayers of both genders(trolkonor ok lifkonor ok spakonor a ̈lla spama ̈n), conjurers who trouble peoplewith ‘‘devilish arts and give themselves to the devil for worldly things.’’24Most frequently, however, non-Christian magic is typified by its relation tothe supernatural or the old religion. Thus they often play on its connectionto the world of the trolls (e.g., Old Swedishtroldomber‘witchcraft, sorcery’"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46chapter 2\u0003troll-ness) or to the world of the past, with expressions such as Old Icelan-dicfornspjo\u0001ll‘old lore’ andfornfræ5i‘old learning’. Tied to this image ofmagic as a special kind of learning is the termfjo\u0001lkyngi‘manifold knowledge’.And it seems that magic was indeed knowledge, something in the medievalNordic world one consciously acquired as part of a learning process, not aninnate ability. Thus we routinely encounter practitioners of witchcraft whoattribute their knowledge to those who have taught them specific practices,as well as literary texts that paint the picture of something like apprentice-ships, in which individuals study the magical arts.25Church statutes (e.g., the Arboga statute of1412) and other ecclesiasticalwriting (e.g.,Fornsvenska legendariet[The Old Swedish Legendary],Jacobs sagapostola) in Scandinavia often cite the existence of grimoires (fjo\u0001lkyngisbækr,galdrabækr) and other learning aids associated with high magic, and it isuseful here to recall that the image of goetic books plays an important role inthe New Testament.26When Paul’s missionary work in Ephesus leads manycitizens to repent their use of magic, ‘‘a good many of those who had formerlypracticed magic collected their books and burnt them publicly’’ (Acts19:19).References to books of this type increase notably throughout Western Europefrom the late thirteenth century onward.27Necromantic writings take on newdimensions in particular at the court of Pope John XXII: he both approvesof a commission to look into the misuse of such books and is himself subse-quently said to be the object of necromancy.28Such texts asLemegeton(alsoknown as theLesser Key of Solomon) and other pseudo-Solomonic works fig-ure regularly in learned discussions of witchcraft and sorcery thereafter.A well-developed narrative about such a magic book from the IcelandicMiddle Ages comes in the story of Jo ́n Halldo ́rsson, a Norwegian cleric whostudied in both Paris and Bologne.29In the tale, the young Jo ́n—who wouldlater serve as bishop of Ska ́lholt from1322to1339—has recently taken up hisstudies in Paris. One day, the master is gone and leaves his book out. As theyoung man hurries to read from his master’s text, a furious storm begins. Jo ́nhears the master returning and rushes back to his seat. As the master walksin, he swears an oath, saying that if the storm continues until evening, it willdry up all the lakes in France. Then it occurs to him that perhaps someonehas been fooling about with his book while he was gone. Jo ́n confesses to thedeed, and the master hastens to his book and proceeds to read a section of it.Soon the storm subsides, and the episode concludes with Bishop Jo ́n com-menting that such things demonstrate what ‘‘arts’’ live in books (hverjar listirlifa ı ́bo ́kunum). This image, one of learned clerics dabbling in the magical"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Daily Life47arts, ran deep in the Middle Ages: several late medieval Danish statutes, forexample, prohibit clerics from engaging in magic, because of its inevitableconnection with the devil.30Learned magical books of this sort (e.g.,Rau5skinna) are frequently, andprominently, mentioned in legends,31but suggestions of medieval Nordicgrimoires notwithstanding, extant copies mainly date near the early modernperiod.32What they would have been like we can mostly infer from thevery rich Nordic charm materials from more recent centuries,33often post-Reformation materials from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries resem-bling those of the Greek magical papyri or of Anglo-Saxon tradition, com-plete with carefully detailed utterance instructions.34Learning and magic are also blended in medieval texts with importantconnections to the grimoire, namely, the medical treatise. Thus a Danishleechbook from the mid to late1300s, for example, exhibits strong interest inthe occult sciences amid its various pharmaceutical recipes.35It notes that todiscover whether a sick man will recover or not, one should take a woman’smilk and steadily drop it into his urine. If the milk sinks, he will die; if itfloats, he will live.36In a similar vein, if one wants to know whether a womanis carrying a male or female baby, ‘‘Take a vat of clean spring water and dropinto it a woman’s milk. If the milk floats in the water, then it is a son; if themilk sinks, then it is a daughter.’’37It recommends, underscoring the connec-tion between magic and religion, that if one wants to ensure that thieves,robbers, and wolves not steal ones livestock, one should inscribe a particularLatin prayer on the doorpost where the animals go out.38‘‘If you don’t wantyour wife,’’39it helpfully suggests, ‘‘to take another man, take the liquid ofthe ‘common houseleek’,40and smear your penis with it, and then lie withyour wife, and after that, while you are alive, she will not have ‘sexual rela-tions’ with another man.’’41The text also provides the remedy for wantonness,42a cocktail made ofthe juice of the gladiola (Gladiolus) mixed with wine or water and given tothe afflicted person with atramenta or other liquid.43But what makes thisotherwise rather ordinary recipe notable is its injunction that the brew shouldbe blended as thePater nosteris being ‘‘read’’ (læs,in the imperative in keep-ing with the nature of the recipe). And here, of course, we see again thepower of a practice that draws on all three elements of the magic-science-religion triptych, the sort of symbiosis that leads the editor to comment, ‘‘Wehave in this leechbook a good example of so-called clerical medicine [lit.,‘monk medicine’] with its raw empiricism, its ignorance and superstition.’’44"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48chapter 2Learned clerics, in fact, were keen to pursue ‘‘natural magic,’’ althoughthere is little direct medieval Nordic evidence for a knowledge of alchemy,such data as we have all point to its knowledge having been restricted tothe clerical community.45The early fifteenth-century bishop of A ̊rhus, BoMogensen, apparently had some knowledge of it: in documents relating tothe disposition of the bishop’s property, Archbishop Peter notes in1420thatthe late bishop had engaged in ‘‘some peculiar arts’’ (noger besynnerlik konst),including alchemy, medicine, and geometry.46A century earlier, when theformer Danish archbishop, Jens Grand, dies in Avignon in1327, ‘‘a little bookabout alchemy’’ (Quidam libellus Arquimie) is listed in the inventory of hislibrary.47And a Swedish poem from1379connected with the Birgittine com-munity at Vadstena also appears to display a knowledge of alchemy, a findingin line with Sten Lindroth’s conclusion that already those Swedish clerkswho studied abroad from the thirteenth century onward probably becameacquainted with the basics of alchemy.48By the end of the fourteenth cen-tury, the church begins to question seriously the goals and role of alchemy,and its relation to the church changes significantly.49Another important form of learned thaumaturgy in the Nordic MiddleAges derives from Jewish magical tradition. Dror Segev, in particular, hasargued for the largely overlooked importance of this branch of magic for theNordic materials.50Thus, in addition to such standard elements of learnedmagic in Europe asAGL A, with its Jewish background, and theSator ArepoTenet Opera Rotaspalindrome, both found on a number of medieval Scandi-navian rune carvings, Segev draws attention to such interesting issues as thepossible influence of the Jewish Solomonic tradition on the treatment onbiblical topics in Old Norse and the likelihood of isolated words in magicalformulas, for example, being of hitherto unrecognized Hebrew origin.51Attributes of the church were common elements in the everyday magicof the Nordic Middle Ages. Typical of these, for example, is a Latin hymn orencomium to Saint Dorothea and Christ found on a piece of paper dated tothe late fifteenth century and thought to have been used as part of a charmor as an amulet.52Similarly, the Latin text of John1:1–14written on parch-ment, bearing on the reverse a further Latin inscription beginning, ‘‘Sanctussanctus sanctus . . .’’ with several circles around it, was almost certainly borneas a protective amulet peddled to its owner by a traveling monk.53Amongthe runic inscriptions from medieval Scandinavia, those from the Norwegiancity of Bergen play a special role and include a number of amulets, or talis-mans, variously calling on God in Latin and the vernacular to protect the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Daily Life49bearer and so on.54An amulet with the popular Saint Anthony’s ‘‘brief ’’ putsthe protective magical nature of European Christianity in a medieval Nordiccontext—a Latin-language inscription in runes—when it begins by proclaim-ing, ‘‘Behold the cross of the Lord; flee, you hostile powers. . . .’’55A Danish text, described by its editors as a teacher’s manual (in the beliefthat it might have been used at, e.g., a cathedral school), from between1452and1467is telling in this regard: among the many highly diverse entries inboth Latin and the vernacular, mostly addressing grave theological issues, areincluded charms against fever in oneself, disease, fever in others, and tooth-ache and two charms against theft.56The first of the theft charms is especiallyinteresting as it invokes the powers of both hell and heaven (in nomine dyaboli[...]in nomine domini ihesu christi).Christian magic was not only textual; it could be corporeal as well.

Because the formula represents the per-spective of the dominant Christian culture, one reverentially writes ‘‘reli-gion’’ here, although it is not difficult to image a similar pagan scenariowhere it would be phrased differently: perhaps medicine, superstition, andmagic.Similarly, according to another of the miracles appended to the vita ofSaint Katarina, a woman in the Swedish parish of Lindera ̊s fell victim topoisoning and was near death. Seeing that she is barely able to breathe, thosewho are with the woman appeal to Katarina, offering a donation, and sud-denly the woman regurgitates a worm from her mouth, followed immediatelyby fourteen toads (xiiij buphones). Thereafter she recovers fully.58If we acceptthe facts as they are presented, as a medieval audience was surely meant to,what were people to think, and, indeed, what must people have thought? Aswe have seen, the distinction between miracle and magic has as much to dowith the observer as with the observed. This story is one of a series of wondersassociated with the life and works of Saint Katarina,59but it is easy to imaginehow if the figure to whom the supplication had been directed had been, say,the pagan goddess Freyja, we would form entirely different conclusions aboutthe character of the event.60"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50chapter 2Continuity in connection with charm magic of this sort can be tracedover long periods in the North. An extraordinary example of this point is acase in which a pagan god is involved centuries after the nominal conversionof the area to Christianity. A late medieval trial for theft and apostasy inStockholm charges that the accused ‘‘had served O ́1inn for seven years.’’61The tendency has been to dismiss this reference to O ́1inn with the explana-tion that what is really being referred to here is the satanic figure constructedby late medieval Christianity, but there is evidence suggesting connections tothe pagan god through charm magic.62Nor is this case an isolated one: someyears later, another man is charged in Stockholm with similar crimes and asimilar connection to the old heathen god. This man is sentenced to burn atthe stake for apostasy, and again the accusation maintains that he servedO ́1inn.63Evidence from the postmedieval period strongly suggests a continu-ous Swedish tradition in which people appealed to O ́1inn for success, espe-cially in financial matters.64But to understand these episodes simply as a question of the struggle ofChristianity against paganism, or of the ability of paganism to escape beingeradicated by Christianity, is to miss the point. The question as I would styleit is not ‘‘Who wins the religious war?’’ but rather the question of howScandinavians of the Middle Ages addressed their problems in health, ro-mance, misfortune, and so on. Magic, whether Christian or pre-Christian inorigin, provided one key response. For most moderns, magic is generally thestuff of gothic novels and Hollywood fantasy, but for its medieval prac-titioner, magic was by no means all ‘‘smells and bells’’—it was also the com-monplace. Of course, there was nothing quotidian about, for example, themarked language of charm magic, or applying a handful of grave mould, ormixing meadowsweet [meadwort] root in wine, or acquiring a cat’s brain.These actions must have had their spiritual dimensions, but such practiceswere not sequestered from the flow of everyday existence in the lives of sail-ors, priests, beggars, farmers, laborers, queens and other people making upthe complex fabric of medieval Nordic society.But if people were able to make use of magic for their own beneficialpurposes, there was, of course, another side to this story. Although magic,whether connected with local saints’ cults or a legacy of pagan folk religion,might in certain circumstances be acceptable, there were also magical prac-tices that were definitely not, and the perception of such unacceptable prac-tices was conveniently summarized under the notion of ‘‘witchcraft’’ (i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Daily Life51trolldo ́mr,fjo\u0001lkyngi,fordæ5a,forneskja,fyrnska, etc.). Even if most people prac-ticed some form of magic in their daily lives, that does not mean they didnot fear its power when wielded by others. Many prayer books at the veryend of the Nordic Middle Ages, for example, express fear of witches andwitchcraft.65Lapidaries and leechbooks brim with various concoctions usefulagainst devils and witchcraft: Peder Ma ̊nsson’s early sixteenth-century trans-lation, for example, contains numerous entries useful for protecting againstwitches, as one description says.66A medical treatise recommends amongother prescriptions fish galls placed in a juniper pail and covered at bedtimewith glowing coals, the reek of which will drive away all witchcraft and dev-ilry; a similar effect can be had with the gall of a black dog, the stench beingso great, that witchcraft loses its power.67Relief through magic and relief from magic were both important meansof addressing the stresses of everyday life in the Middle Ages.68One sanc-tioned way to ameliorate the problems of everyday life was to pray, do hom-age, go on pilgrimages, or otherwise hope to gain the approval of the church,perhaps even witness or be the beneficiary of a miracle.69The differencebetween a miracle and an outcome produced by magic was thin, the greatdistinction for the church having to do with the power from which it drewits vitality—does the supernatural event derive from a kind and benevolentGod interceding on behalf of his people or from demonic powers who use,or are used by, a human to accomplish these goals? In her treatment of magicin the early Middle Ages, Valerie Flint comments on this distinction as itrelates to the magical and the miraculous: ‘‘Augustine recognizes that magi-cians and good Christians may do similar things. The difference lies in theirmeans and ends.’’70It also lies, she might have added, in the interpretativeframeworks of the observer.In fact, we possess an excellent example of precisely this notion. Or whatwould we otherwise think of a supernatural figure who could heal illness andinjuries through song, cure sick cattle the same way, extinguish fires withmere words, and by using special magical gear heal humans and animals andwith the same equipment protect food stores from the deprivations of ver-min? But this is not a figure outside of a Christian context: if he were, wewould assume him to be a pagan god, witch, or sorcerer. The person believedto be so remarkable was none other than Bishop4orla ́kr, declared a saint in1198: his songs are hymns, his words a blessing, and his magical kit holywater.71"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52chapter 2Romance, Fortune, Health, Weather, and MaledictionSaint Birgitta enumerates many of the purposes to which magic was put,saying that both men and women follow the counsel of ‘‘accursed witchesand sorceresses’’ (and here she specifies the female gender) in order to con-ceive children, win love, discover the future, and be healed of illness.72Magicof one sort or another touched all aspects of daily life, but we should hardlybe surprised to discover that, as in Birgitta’s list, romance, attempts to dis-cover one’s destiny, and health emerge as the dominant elements of survivingexamples of medieval Nordic magic, to which might be added, imprecation.73The curious case of weather magic—little in evidence as performed magic,yet much talked about in literature—represents another important area toconsider in the materials that follow.RomanceAmong charms, those concerned with love and sex constituted an importantpart of the magical tradition of medieval Scandinavia, a tradition representedboth before and after the Christianization of the area. That such charmspersisted in the post-Conversion world may be seen from medieval Nordicreligious works of various types—sermons and visions, for example—thatcondemn people who turn to witchcraft and magic in order to make theirparamours love them better.74In general, charms associated with men lookto seduce—or more accurately, coerce—women into having intercourse witha man (i.e., aphrodisiac charms), while at the other extreme, charms associ-ated with women seek to prevent a couple from having sex (i.e., anaphrodis-iac charms). Whether hoping to consummate or prevent a liaison, magic isthe medium, and that this particular arena of magical and sociological con-cern was perceived as a genuine problem is supported by its sober treatmentin both medieval laws and ecclesiastical writings and by its role in a numberof fourteenth- and fifteenth-century trials from Norway and Sweden.75In fact, we possess a dramatic treatment of this sort of enchantment,what is often euphemistically referred to in the scholarly literature as ‘‘lovemagic,’’ inSkı ́rnisma ́l(The Lay of Skı ́rnir), a poem preserved from circa1270.76The poem describes Skı ́rnir’s wooing of the giantess Ger1r on behalfof his master, the god Freyr. Skı ́rnir’s mission is seemingly doomed to fail aslong as he merely offers the maid a variety of gifts, nor do its chances ofsuccess improve when he simply threatens her and her family’sphysicalwell-being.

Such wands (referred to in this poem as atamsvo\u0001ndr‘tamingrod’ [v.26] andgambanteinn‘magic wand or rod’ [v.32]) are well known inNorse literature and did in fact exist in the Viking Age as part of the sorcerer’skit.78In this case, Skı ́rnir not only carves runes on the wand but also declaresthat he will ‘‘tame’’ (temia) Ger1r to his will after he has touched or struckher with it (v.26). He then exiles Ger1r to a vile distant region, tells her shewill be painfully ugly and will know nothing but sorrow, be bitten by imps,and likens her to a thistle at harvest time. Skı ́rnir explains that he has acquiredthe wand by going to the forest and then immediately declares that she hasangered the gods.Addressing himself to various races of supernatural beings, Skı ́rnir thendenies the pleasure and enjoyment of men to her:how I forbid,how I debarmen’s mirth to the maid,men’s love to the maid. (v.34)Having refused to her human males, Skı ́rnir then says a thurs willhaveher(Hrı ́mgrı ́mnir heitir7urs, / er7ic hafa scal[v.35]). The phrase he uses (scalhafa) can in this instance only mean one thing: Skı ́rnir does not sayeiga‘own, possess, have for a wife’ or some other term that might imply the legalobligations of marriage, but ratherhafa, almost certainly to be understood as‘use, employ’, no doubt with a sexual connotation. He further declares thatshe will know only ‘‘lechery, loathing, and lust’’ (ergi oc œ5i / oc o ́7ola),emotional states and drives represented by runes that he apparently can ma-nipulate by carving them into the wand. Alternatively, he can also cancelthem by obliterating the runes.79This threat clinches the deal, and she acqui-esces to his demands.Scholarly attention to the poem’s ‘‘love magic’’ has tended to centerrather narrowly on the metaphor of the dried thistle at harvest time.80Theclassic interpretation of this image is one according to which it is best under-stood in light of an Estonian harvest custom in which a rock holds down athistle, metaphorically containing and controlling the demon within it, andthus preventing the harvest from being spoiled.81In recent years, focus haswidened to include as well the connections between Skı ́rnir’s curse and vari-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54chapter 2ous other Nordic imprecations, especially since the discovery of a Norwegianrunic inscription with important connections to the poem.82The fourteenth-century runic text is inscribed on a four-sided wooden stick (wand?) fromBergen that begins, ‘‘I cut runes of help; I cut runes of protection; onceagainst the elves, twice against the trolls, thrice against the ogres. . . .’’83Inthe middle of the inscription, the carver calls down on the woman who is theobject of the text, ‘wolfish lechery and lust’ (ylgjar ergi ok u ́7ola), echoing thephrase inSkı ́rnisma ́l,and concludes its Norse portion with a curse that thewoman should be subject to unbearable distress and misery, declaring,‘‘Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep,’’ until the woman loves the carveras she loves herself.84The language of this inscription and that ofSkı ́rnisma ́lsuggest that they are both part of a much broader tradition of Nordic charmmagic, where the object is to compel the subject of the charm to ‘‘love’’ inall senses the one for whom the charm is being done.85Representations of this kind of magic, as in these cases, often suggestthat it was more or less the exclusive province of men and their desires.Although there may be some truth in this image, there are also portrayals ofit being used by women, in literature in any event.86In one of the mostfamous such cases, Snorri Sturluson, in his early thirteenth-century portrayalof events that supposedly took place in the ninth century, draws a picture ofKing Haraldr being subjected to just such a form of ‘‘love magic’’ when hevisits ‘‘the Finns.’’ In Norse tradition, the Sa ́mi, which is what is intendedhere by Finns, are presented as especially well-endowed magically, so muchso that a term such asfinnfo\u0001r(lit. ‘Finn-trip’) meant to visit the Sa ́mi in orderto inquire about the future.87In this case, the king is taken to the beautifulSnæfrı ́1r, who rises to meet him. ‘‘She poured a cup of mead for the king,and he took both the cup and her hand; and immediately it was as if a hotfire coursed through his body [lit., ‘his penis’], and he desired to lie with herthat same night.’’88This desire is parlayed into a marriage, and so enamored of his new wifeis the king that he neglects the kingdom and his responsibilities to it. WhenSnæfrı ́1r later dies, her corpse does not putrefy, and the king remains besideher for three years in the hope that she will come back to life. Finally hisadvisors fool him into moving the body and suddenly its corrupt naturebecomes obvious: ‘‘then stench and foul smell and all kinds of odors of cor-ruption rose from the corpse [. . .] her entire body became livid, and all kindsor worms and adders, frogs and toads and vipers crawled out of it.’’89Thedegenerate yet apparently wholesome-appearing corpse is no doubt intended"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Daily Life55to parallel the nature of pagan magic itself; that is, even when it worked—andthere is little doubt but that medieval observers believed it could be effec-tive—its nature was corrupt.In yet another example of ‘‘love magic,’’ and here this label seems espe-cially inappropriate, the inscription reads in its entirety, ‘‘You will fuck Rann-veig the Red. It will be bigger than a man’s prick and smaller than a horse’sprick.’’90This thirteenth-century phallocentric inscription from Bergen iscarved on a wooden stave. There can be little doubt that one of the individu-alswhosefatewasconjuredonthischarm—itssecond-person‘‘you’’—believed the inscription capable of directing the future (and especially theobject of the owner’s lust), although we should hold out the possibility thata text of this sort might have been an augury, a device geared toward prognos-tication. More likely, however, its owner thought that by manipulating thetalisman in various specified ways, or perhaps through its very production orpurchase, he could direct the future, not merely know it. For her part, ofcourse, Rannveig, the object of all this concupiscent concern, may, if sheknew what was going on, justifiably have considered it an imprecation.Although the topic and wording of this charm will strike many modernobservers as crude, it forms part of the larger tradition of love charms evidentthroughout medieval Scandinavia. As was the case inSkı ́rnisma ́l, charmmagic of this sort, which looks to seduce, or coerce, a woman into havingintercourse with a man, was widespread in the Old Norse world. Not allrunic inscriptions treating matters of the heart—or elsewhere, anatomicallyspeaking—are abusive, of course. We can presumably infer that a Norwegianinscription that reads ‘‘I love the maiden even better! Even better!’’ maysimply represent a private declaration of hope and emotion or, just perhaps,given the repetition of the phrase ‘‘even better,’’ a less violent form of charmmagic.91If inscriptions of this sort give us the context for understanding the line‘‘You will fuck Rannveig the Red’’ (Rannveig *Rau5u skaltu stre5a[alt.,ser5a]),how are we to contextualize and interpret the remainder of the text, ‘‘It willbe bigger than a man’s prick and smaller than a horse’s prick’’ (8at se ́meiraenn mannsre5r ok minna enn hestre5r)?Vo\u0001lsa7a ́ttr(The Story of Vo\u0001lsi) is an OldIcelandic story that treats a priapic cult—featuring a horse penis—and isknown to us only from the late fourteenth-century version of the life of SaintO ́la ́fr inFlateyjarbo ́k.92The central question about this story has always beenthe issue of its authenticity: Is it a reflection of ancient practice, or is it acreation of the Christian Middle Ages?93For our purposes, perhaps this ques-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56chapter 2tion does not matter: that a medieval author and audience found this sort ofmaterial engaging—and whatever the background of the story, whether in-vented or inherited, King O ́la ́fr’s resolution of the problem of recalcitrantpaganism in his kingdom is pricelessly funny—is more than enough. Shouldthe basis for the tale eventually prove to be of ancient heritage, such a findingwould simply add additional weight to its testimony and its relevance.Whether ancient or newly minted, the story is entirely built around theessentialization of the male member, in this instance, a horse phallus (hestre5r)although the pizzle is referred to by other names in the tale, such asvingull,beytill, andVo\u0001lsi.94Specifically, the story relates that when the farmer’s horsedies, the slave who is skinning the creature cuts off ‘‘that limb, which naturehas given to animals that conceive by intercourse, and which is named ‘vin-gul’ on horses, according to the ancient poets.’’95After its preservation, thepizzle is passed among all those present, who make up verses encouraging thephallus, and the others present, to act in certain, often very suggestive, ways.96The choice of an equine phallus to embody the power of the male generativeorgan is anything but random, and certainly the history of the horse in Nor-dic religious culture adds further layers of complexity to the story.97Thenotion in the runic charm that ‘‘it’’ would be bigger than a man’s penis andsmaller than a horse’s penis conforms to the typical male fantasy in whichpenis size is an index of manhood.98A further indication of the complex to which this charm belongs is nodoubt seen in the versified imprecation the witch, Busla, casts on the sleepingKing Hringr inBo ́sa saga ok Herrau5s(The Saga of Bo ́si and Herrau5r): likethe Bergen charm, it begins by calling on the forces of the supernatural worldto harass the king, and then on the natural world to do unnatural things:Trolls and elvesand sorceresses,goblins and giantsshall burn your halls;frost-giants shall fright youand stallions ride you,straws shall sting you,storms drive you mad;may you ever be damned,unless you do what I want.99"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Daily Life57The translation is here more polite than the original, which literally says,‘may stallions fuck you’ (hestar stre5i7ik). This verse is only a part of thelongerBuslubæn(Prayer of Busla) andSyrpuvers(Syrpa Verse), which, signifi-cantly, ends in an enigmatic runic cluster.100In other words, although Busla’sobjective in this curse is quite different, both the specific term used as part ofher charm and the broader image of her behavior—the structure of verbalcharming apparently leading into, and concluding with, the carving of runiccharacters—inform our understanding of the background against which thematerial residue represented by the Rannveig the Red inscription must bekeyed.If we possess clear outlines of a phallocentric tradition of ‘‘love magic,’’we have perhaps even stronger evidence for its equally gendered opposite,namely, a tradition of anaphrodisiac magic, that is, charm magic intended toprevent coitus, usually by removing the strength of the male member.101Mentioned both in literary sources and court cases, this form of magic ap-pears to have been common. The most detailed nonnarrative portrayal ofsuch magic comes, as is so often the case, from the Norwegian city of Bergen,where in1325a woman is accused of cursing her former lover by elaboratemeans (discussed in detail in Chapter5). Under questioning, she admits tohaving hidden bread and peas in the bridal bed on the first night of thewedding and a sword near the heads of the newlyweds. Having secretedherself in the room, she later uttered an incantation, calling on spirits to bitethe accursed in the back and breast and to stir up ‘‘hatred and ill-will.’’ Theprotocol continues, ‘‘and when these words are read,102[one] should spitupon the one the curse concerned.’’103Having successfully completed thisclandestine portion of her spell, the woman, Ragnhildr, might now havewaited for the results of her work. But whether through hubris or, as onesuspects, because some sort of public declaration represented a final elementin the charm, on the second day of the wedding she publicly declares, ‘‘Mymind rejoices that since [they are] bewitched, Ba ́r1r’s genitals will be no moreeffective for intercourse than this belt rolled up in my hand.’’104Several thirteenth-century Icelandic sagas—Korma ́ks saga(The Saga ofKorma ́kr) andBrennu-Nja ́ls saga(Njal’s Saga) in particular—are helpful inunderscoring the apparently widespread popularity in literature of the kindof magic for which Ragnhildr is brought before the bishop. InKorma ́ks saga,a curse placed on the saga’s eponymous hero ensures that he and his belovedcan never experience intimacy: ‘‘Tho ́rveig brought it about by her witchcraftthat Korma ́k and Steingerd should never have intercourse together.’’105Al-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58chapter 2though an attempt is made to undo the curse by another witch, this story offrustrated romance concludes with the malevolent magic successfully keepingKorma ́kr and Steinger1r apart.A similar, and far more graphic, example comes fromBrennu-Nja ́ls saga,when the Norwegian queen, Gunnhildr, curses her Icelandic lover, Hru ́tr,when he falsely denies that another woman is waiting for him in Iceland.Gunnhildr embraces Hru ́tr at their last parting, kisses him, and says, ‘‘If Ihave as much power over you as I think, the spell I now lay on you willprevent your ever enjoying the woman in Iceland on whom you have set yourheart. With other women you may have your will, but never with her.’’106The situation resembles the story of Ragnhildr tregaga ́s, but the nature of thetwo curses could not be more different: whereas Ragnhildr claims that hercharm will cause impotence in Ba ́r1r, Gunnhildr’s curse has the oppositeoperative consequences for Hru ́tr, albeit with the same goal of keeping thenewlyweds from consummating their relationship. As Unnr, Hru ́tr’s wifenow that he is back in Iceland, subsequently explains to her father,‘‘I want to divorce Hrut, and I can tell you the exact grounds I haveagainst him. He is unable to consummate our marriage and give mesatisfaction, although in every other way he is as virile as the best ofmen.’’ ‘‘What do you mean?’’ asked Mord. ‘‘Be more explicit.’’ Unnreplied, ‘‘Whenever he touches me, he [lit., ‘his penis’] is so enlargedthat he cannot have enjoyment of me, although we both passionatelydesire to reach consummation. But we have never succeeded. Andyet, before we draw apart, he proves that he is by nature as normalas other men.’’107Unnr’s reference to Hru ́tr’s ability to reach a climax, despite the couple’sinability to engage in coitus, is no gratuitous bit of salaciousness but reflectsa serious debate current among the decretists in this period.108Accusations of similar anaphrodisiac curses emerge from Sweden in thelate medieval period.109Operationally, the magic used by ‘‘Crazy Katherine’’(galna kadhrin) in Arboga in1471differs significantly from the earlier cases,even if the intent appears consistent: she will arrange things such that a manleaves his fiance ́e for another woman through a charm involving a cat’s head.But this case introduces a new element, namely, a professional witch, CrazyKatherine.110A case from Stockholm in1490suggests a similar scenario ofhostile female magic. There can be little doubt in this instance as to the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Daily Life59nature of the curse, even if it is almost impossible to infer the circumstancesof the event: here, a Margithalffstoopadmits that years earlier she had takenfrom a particular man ‘‘all the strength in his manhood etcetera’’ while hestood and urinated.111Further, she says that she learned this magic (thentrolldomen), which also includes a cat’s head, from another woman in Bjo ̈r-klinge, a village north of Uppsala.112‘‘Love magic’’ is the term by which all charms of this sort are known,but, as these cases make clear, fulfilling one’s desire can have both differentmethods and different meanings. One key lesson to be drawn from the an-aphrodisiac, or ‘‘antilove,’’ cases is the fact that it is not merely the physiologi-cal condition of impotence (or its obverse) in the man that is significant.Rather, causality is the chief issue, that is, that such a condition results fromthe manifest, informed behavior of an individual with evil intentions. Thesame, of course, might be said of aphrodisiac magic as well. And, as discussedin Chapter5, both types of ‘‘love magic’’ bring their users to the attention ofthe legal authorities.FortuneAnother theurgical area well represented in the sagas is the quest for fore-knowledge by consulting specialists. But as is the case with romance, evidenceof interest in vaticination and prognostication comes to us from many differ-ent sources, not just the Icelandic sagas. Naturally, in Christian Scandinavia,prophecy of a certain type is regarded as fully acceptable—when it comes inthe historical context of the Hebrew Scriptures or other unobjectionablechurch-sanctioned circumstances. As the thirteenth-centuryKonungsskuggsja ́(The King’s Mirror) notes, building on1Corinthians12:1–11, Saint Paul saysthat God gives men the gift of the Holy Spirit for a specific purpose, andsome ‘‘receive a spirit of prophecy.’’113The most common native terms forprophetic sorcery—spa ́,spa ́domr,spa ́saga,spa ́mæli,forspa ́—and those whopractice it—spa ́ma5r,spa ́kona—are also used in Old Norse to describe proph-ecy in its Christian context, where it can be discussed with approbation, aswell as in the context of what was regarded as superstition, where it wasroutinely condemned.114Another sanctioned presentation of prophecy camein the form of the sibylline oracles, pagan, Jewish, and early Christian proph-etesses well known from a wide variety of popular ecclesiastical texts and evenchurch murals in medieval Scandinavia, such as the presentation of the twelvesibyls in A ̊rhus cathedral (Figure1).115Prophecy is portrayed as having played an important role in the conver-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60chapter 2sion process in Scandinavia, as discussed in Chapter1, and in yet another textdepicting the confrontation of the old and new faiths,8orvalds7a ́ttr vı ́5fo\u0001rla(The Tale of Thorvald the Far-Travelled), a pagan, Ko1ra ́n, declares that theperson the Christians call their ‘‘bishop’’ is this faith’sspa ́ma5r‘prophet’.Ko1ra ́n says that he has his own prophet (spa ́ma5r,masculine gender) inwhom he trusts and who lives in a rock and helps him in various ways,warning him in advance of coming evil, as well as guarding his livestock;moreover, this prophet warns him about the Christians and their ways.116Inevitably, in the contest that follows, the bishop’s prayers and ceremoniesprove that Ko1ra ́n should ‘‘turn to the most powerful god’’ (snu ́isk til7ess insstyrkasta gu5s), with the result that the fiend (fja ́ndi) leaves, but not beforerelating to Ko1ra ́n the many things that have happened to him because ofthe bishop’s actions and saying that he has been ill rewarded by Ko1ra ́n.Here, in clearly a Christian context, thespa ́ma5rretains his prophetic func-tion but appears to have a much expanded range of activities.Prophecy in the Icelandic sagas classically portrays a female soothsayerengaging in seeing the future, sometimes through the magical practice knownassei5r. The sagas are laced with images of such events, for example,Hro ́lfssaga kraka(The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki),O\u0001rvar-Odds saga(Arrow-Odd’sSaga),Vı ́ga-Glu ́ms saga(Viga-Glum’s Saga),Vatnsdæla saga(Vatndalers’ Saga),andEirı ́ks saga rau5a(The Saga of Eirı ́kr the Red).117The simplest form intro-duces the topic, as, for example, inVı ́ga-Glu ́ms saga, by noting the ability ofa certain woman to look into the future, as well as the fact that housewivesin the district felt it important to entertain her well, as her opinions reflectedthe reception she had received.118When she has visited one home and madeher remarks, a testy exchange follows between the housewife and the woman,after which the prophetess is said to be, in typical saga fashion,o ́rso\u0001gunni‘out of the saga’.At the other extreme, there are also quite minute presentations of theprocess, none more so than the description inEirı ́ks saga rau5aof a witch(vo\u0001lva) and the practices she engages in (taken up in detail in Chapter3).Not only is the ritual noted with great care—how, for example, she is seatedon a raised dais with women surrounding her, one of whom sings what arecalledvar5lokkur, to which many spirits are drawn—but also the dress andother habits of thevo\u0001lvaare painstakingly recorded.119For present purposes,the key information in this scene is near its conclusion, where the saga relates,‘‘Then men went to the prophetess and each asked what he was most eager"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Daily Life61to know. She was free with her information and few things did not turn outas she said.’’120Whatever the value of such saga presentations in assessing the archaictraditions of the Nordic cultures—and recent studies suggest they aregreat—it would be misleading to use these texts as the sole image of suchpractices among medieval Scandinavians. By way of demonstrating both thecontrast and convergence of views represented between the two worlds, com-menting on the world of fourteenth-century Sweden, Saint Birgitta describesa Swedish knight who inquired of a prophetess (spakonu) whether or notthere would be a rebellion against the king, and things turned out as theprophetess foretold. He told the king of these events within the hearing ofBirgitta, and as soon as she left, ‘‘the bride of Christ’’ heard a voice that askedif she had heard how the knight asked for counsel of the prophetess and howshe told of the coming peace. Birgitta is instructed to tell the king that,because of the people’s superstitious nature (for folksins vantro), God allowsthe devil to know about things that will happen. The devil in turn revealsthe future to those who ask him for counsel in order to deceive those whoare faithful to him ‘‘and unfaithful to me’’ (oc mik a ̈ru otrone). Those whotraffic in such prophecies should be condemned and removed from Christiansociety, as they have given themselves to the devil and hope to become richagainst God’s will and thereby allow the devil to gain power over their hearts.To accomplish such evil temptations, the devil sends helpers like witches andother opponents (trolkonur ok andra tronne genua ̈rdhogha) through whomhumans can be fooled.121In this episode, Birgitta provides us with the basics of the ideologicalstruggle Christian thinking saw in the survival of pagan traditions: How is itthat soothsayers working outside a Christian context can sometimes be right?And what is the source of their power? The answers are both clever andtortured: the Almighty allows the devil to know about things that will cometo pass because of the superstitious nature of the people; the devil, in turn,wants to fool those who are faithful to him; the devil has emissaries in theform of witches to assist him in these deceptions; and those who have aban-doned the true faith and gone over to the devil are to be condemned anddealt with. To the extent that this story provides a window on how even atthe highest levels of fourteenth-century Nordic society prophecy was a reli-able resource for intelligence, as well as an active force to be reckoned withby church authorities, it is a remarkable testimonial, but it is not especiallyrich in details about how the prophecies were achieved."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62chapter 2More revealing in this regard is a miracle from circa1385, in which acouple consult with a man who believes in the devil and conjures him whenhe wants to know the tidings (tha han wilde nakur tidhande wita).122A child-less couple come to this man to ask whether or not the woman will bearchildren, and the man, as was his custom, casts a circle and calls his devils,many of whom immediately come to him in different forms. One of thesebears a crown on his head, and when a priest goes by with the consecratedhost, the devil falls to his knees, removes the crown, and acknowledgesChrist’s supremacy. As a result, the couple recognize and mend their evilways, and the devil fails to capture their souls. The scene sketched in thismiracle, as typical of European witchcraft norms as it is, is also uncannilylike the broad outlines of the scene inEirı ́ks saga rau5a, where again a circleto which spirits are drawn is the key feature. This is not to suggest a directrelationship between the texts but rather that these may be yet another exam-ple where institutional power has relied in one way or another on folk tradi-tions or, at the very least, seized on the opportunity to exploit the similaritiesbetween elite and nonelite images of magic.HealthMagic is sometimes held in the popular imagination to be a kind of poorman’s panacea, yet in the mid-1300s Magnus Eriksson, king of Sweden andNorway, had a stone that he believed would sweat if it came near poison.123King Magnus no doubt regarded this stone as both a superior medical discov-ery and a practical security device, but most modern observers would viewthe whole business as ‘‘mere superstition.’’124Such too must have been theattitude of church authorities, which had already put the stamp of disap-proval on such beliefs: the early laws of Iceland declare, ‘‘People are not todo things with stones or fill them with magic power with the idea of tyingthem on people or livestock. If a man puts his trust in stones for his ownhealth or that of his livestock, the penalty is lesser outlawry.’’125In fact, stones, and especially gemstones, play a very important role inmedieval thinking. So, for example, the Old Swedish poem referred to earlierand connected with the Birgittine double monastery in Vadstena, called byits modern editorDen vises sten(The Philosopher’s Stone), tells of a marvelousstone belonging to amestare‘master’, the life-giving properties of which re-store a man to health, indeed, raise him from the dead.126But the stone notonly gives him life but also endows the man with ‘‘wisdom and understand-ing,’’ as well as ‘‘strength and power.’’127Further, it cures lameness, deafness,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Daily Life63and blindness. Much of the poem is concerned with the man’s attempts tokeep the stone from falling into the hands of the enemy, and by variousmeans he ensures that it does not come into the devil’s grasp.128The hermeneutic possibilities are many: perhaps this stone is to be un-derstood against the many metaphorical and physical stone references in theBible.129Or perhaps it should be read against the significant scientific interestin gemstones exhibited in the Middle Ages (e.g.,De Lapidibusof BishopMarbode of Rennes), especially where medical applications were believed tobe a possibility,130a perspective paralleled by their popular allegorical use ina great deal of medieval literature.131Moreover, mystics such as Mechthild ofMagdeburg and Hildegard of Bingen make frequent use of stone symbolism,as does Saint Birgitta of Sweden herself. And it is also possible that alchemicalallusions are being made as well.132But whatever the key to understandingthis special stone that can cure the lame, the deaf, and the blind and has somany other virtues, it is clearly a magical stone to be desired and does notseem to comport well with the dour pronouncement in the Icelandic lawsconcerning trusting stones for one’s health.In fact, Nordic magic related to health, like that tied to romance, isanother area where the evidence is strong. One rich resource has been thelarge number of amulets, often bearing runic inscriptions, that survive.133These protective articles reflect important aspects of medieval magic in thatthey are often specific as to desired effect, and frequently in Latin as well asthe vernacular. To take one useful example, the whetstone-shaped amberamulet from Dømmestrup on Fyn in Denmark from the later Middle Agesbears a Latin inscription that twice reads ‘against all harm’ (contra omniamala).134That the amulet is shaped like a whetstone may have as-yet unfath-omed importance, and certainly the fact that its words are in Latin ratherthan the vernacular helps demonstrate the probable role of the clergy in theproduction of such magical instruments and the greater power understood tobe possessed by the language of the church.135Moreover, recontextualizingthe ‘‘performance’’ of the inscription, where the repetitions in the text maysuggest ways in which the amulet was more than just an observed object ofpower—perhaps also a script for private rituals—must be kept in mind.Another Latin text from Denmark demonstrates the broad connectionsNordic charms of this sort had with European conjurations, from its invoca-tion of the seven sisters to its employment of the ubiquitous magical formulaAGL A:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64chapter 2I invoke you, seven sisters [ . . . ] Elffrica(?)

Cer-tainly the fact that there existed specific terms to designate the products ofthis kind of magic,galdrahrı ́5‘magic storm’ andgerningave5r‘storm raisedby witchcraft’ (alsogerningahrı ́5), hints that the concept may indeed havebeen of significance. Control of the elements is important enough for itsattributes to be enumerated among O ́1inn’s ‘‘List of Chants’’ inHa ́vama ́l154:That ninth I know:if need there beto guard a ship in a gale,the wind I calm,upon the waves also,and wholly soothe the sea.140And, indeed, the image that emerges from the testimony of the Icelandicsagas suggests that weather magic was in fact regarded as very important.141Manipulating storms and other weather-related phenomena play significantroles in such sagas asBrennu-Nja ́ls saga,Gı ́sla saga Su ́rssonar(The Saga ofGı ́sli Su ́rsson),Fostbræ5ra saga(The Saga of the Sworn Brothers),Vatnsdælasaga,andVı ́glundar saga(The Saga of Vı ́glundr).Frequently the saga writers employ weather magic as a literary device toset a tone or establish an atmosphere (see also Chapter3). But it is also oftenportrayed as part of a climatic arsenal, frequently for hire, a weapon to deployagainst foes. So, for example, inEyrbyggja saga(The Saga of the People of Eyri),4o ́roddr arranges with a witch named4orgrı ́ma for her to create a magicstorm (at hon skyldi gera hrı ́5vi5ri) against a man crossing a heath.142When afamily of witches is accused of crimes inLaxdæla saga(The Saga of the Peopleof Laxdale), the father erects a ritual platform and the entire family mountsit, chanting spells, until they have raised a great storm, directed against theirenemies.143In one of the more fantastic manifestations of this idea of weatherasatool,acharacterin8orsteins saga Vı ́kingssonarsays that he owns a‘‘weather bag’’ (ve5rbelgr), which when he shakes it, causes such cold andfierce wind to blow out of it that a lake freezes.144InO ́la ́fs saga Tryggvasonar(The Saga of O ́la ́fr Tryggvason), Rau1r, a sacrificer very skilled in magic(blo ́tma5r ok mjo\u0001k fjo\u0001lkunnigr), is able, due to his magic, to get a good windfor his warship whenever he wants.145"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66chapter 2Examples of this sort could be multiplied many times over within thenarrative world of medieval Scandinavia, suggesting that such powers mayhave formed part of the NordicWeltanschauung, but identifying evidence oftheir practice is another thing altogether. It may be, of course, that Scandina-vian charms about weather were of a type that simply left no archival ormaterial footprint. One of the very few examples of charm magic connectedwith weather phenomena comes from just before the period of this book,the late eleventh century, from Sigtuna in Uppland, Sweden. Parts of thiscomplicated runic inscription appear to call on ‘‘mist’’ and ‘‘(sun)shine’’ asagents to do the magician’s bidding.146The abiding value of these abilities isreadily inferred from the fact that they are attributed to medieval Christiansaints as well. Thus, for example, it is said of the Icelandic bishop Saint4orla ́kr that he provided aid to those who prayed to him, calming winds andseas, diminishing waves, and quelling storms, sharing many of these talentsnot only with O ́1inn but also with Saint Elmo, the patron saint of sailors,underscoring the continuity of needs and functions within the Nordic area,irrespective of the dominant religion.147MaledictionThe language noted earlier of the Ribe rune stick raises an intriguing ques-tion, alluded to already several times: the question of performance. How werecharms enacted? Something very similar to the Ribe runic charm, if with avery different objective, is presented in a runic inscription from Bergen datedto the late fourteenth century.148One of the commonly addressed problemsto which magic was put was the discovery of lost property, or of the identityof the person who had stolen them, and this text was arguably part of somemore elaborate ritual whose purpose was to find the name of a thief. The textalso shows how a pagan god could continue to have vitality, but in a newsetting, as the carver invokes not Christian powers in the first instance butO ́1inn (ek sœri7ik, O ́5inn).149Conversely, the broader Christian culturalframework is apparent when the text calls the old god ‘‘greatest among devils’’(mestr fja ́nda) and invokes Christianity as part of the charm as well (fyr kris-tni).150It is surely the residue of a magical performance: although not un-problematic, the language of the text appears to provide us with a remarkablerecord of a charm actually being worked.151Romance, foreknowledge, health, and weather represent important cate-gories where medieval man could improve his or, as often as not, her lot inlife, but magic no doubt touched virtually every aspect of life, including"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Daily Life67work; thus Birgitta condemns a man for using ‘‘witchcraft and other diaboli-cal words’’ to increase his catch of fish.152The Icelandic laws implicitly recog-nize the differing uses of magic and explicitly detail two levels of witchcraft,saying,If someone uses spells or witchcraft or magic (galldra e7a gørningar.e7a fiolky ́ngi)—he uses magic (fiolkyngi) if he utters or teaches some-one else or gets someone else to utter words of magic over himselfor his property—the penalty is lesser outlawry[. . . . ] If a manpractices black sorcery (fordæs skap), the penalty for that is full out-lawry. It is black magic (fordæs skapir) if through his words or hismagic (fiolkyngi) a man brings about the sickness or death of live-stock or people.153Most of the forms of magic discussed thus far would no doubt have beenregarded as more or less venial offenses, but one final area that needs to bementioned is precisely what the Icelandic laws mean here when they desig-nate ‘‘black magic’’ (fordæ5uskapr; alt.,fordæsskapr) as the form of magic thatcalls for full outlawry.154This kind of magic causes death, illness, and mad-ness in others or in their livestock, as in the previous example, and of thissort of magic we have only a few examples.One of the last recorded events in the Norse colony on Greenland fallsinto this category and involved so-called love magic. A man is executed inGreenland in1407for sleeping with a married woman, having taken herthrough ‘‘the black arts.’’155The inferences to be drawn from this brief entryinclude the possibility that it is the affair with this man and his subsequentexecution that leave her unbalanced or perhaps rather that her mental healthis impaired by the man’s use of ‘‘the black arts,’’ an act offordæ5uskapr, whichin turn was the reason for his being consigned to such a terrible fate.In fact, most of the evidence that would seem to bear on the matter ofperformance involves a malediction. As discussed earlier, such cases as thoseostensibly involving anaphrodisiac magic—Ragnhildr tregaga ́s, Margit halffs-toop, and perhaps others—include a kind of cursing, but although we dohave some specific details, few entries in the trial documents compare withthe ways in which cursing procedures are presented in the surviving literarysources.156Indeed, the art of malediction often provides for some of the mostdramatic moments in the literature of medieval Scandinavia, and in this last"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68chapter 2section I examine several presentations in our sources detailing individualslaying down a curse, mostly, but not all, from literary sources.Thus, when in the scene discussed earlier, the witch Busla forces KingHringr to do her will inBo ́sa saga ok Herrau5s, the tripartite presentation ofthe process reflects the notion that there exist layers of impermissibility: whenthe author provides several hundred words of her first imprecation, the so-calledBuslubæn, he says that it consists of evil words that Christians do notneed to know. Following these words, the king tells her to go and threatensto have her tortured for her imprecations (forbænir), but at this point she hasalready made it impossible for him to rise from his bed. She then launchesinto what the author specifies as the second third of her curse (Busla le ́t7a ́frammi annan7ri5jung bænarinnar. . . ), about which the narrator furthernotes that it is less likely to be repeated if it is not written down and thereforehe will only provide the beginning of the text.157Following her delivery ofthe chant, the king now partially accedes to her demands, and, unsatisfied,Busla responds to the effect that she must do him one better.158She thenuttersSyrpuvers, which the author says is the most powerful sort of magicand which cannot be said after sunset. When she has finished it, includingthe runic puzzle at the end, the king agrees to do as she wants. The scenariois at one level highly stylized, yet it also hints at what the art of imprecationand its allusive performance practices may have been like in the Nordic Mid-dle Ages.A similar and, if anything, even more dramatic presentation of how oneworked magic, in the eyes of saga writers at least, is given inEgils saga Skalla-Grı ́mssonar(The Saga of Egill Skalla-Grı ́msson). Having fallen out with theking and queen of Norway, Egill kills their young son and his men, loots thevaluables from the farmstead, and then performs a powerful curse, describedin the saga in some detail.159Egill goes up on the island with a hazel pole,which he raises on a rock outcropping and on it places a horse head. He thenbegins to perform an incantation:160he declares that he has raised the insult-pole (nı ́5sto\u0001ng) and that he turns (sny ́) its imprecation on the king and queen.He then turns (sneri) the horse head toward the land and says that he turns(sny ́) the imprecation against the land-spirits who dwell in that land, thatthey should be disoriented and lost until they have driven the king and queenfrom the land. Egill then shoves the pole into a fissure in the rock and allowsit to stand there. He turns (sneri) the head toward the land, carves runes onthe pole, writing out the entire invocation, and then goes to the ship. We"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Daily Life69learn subsequently that the king and queen are, indeed, forced to leave thecountry.We have no way of knowing just how well, or how poorly, this scenematches what may really have happened in the practice of magic, either atthe time when the story’s events were supposed to have taken place in thetenth century or, for that matter, at the time they were written down in thethirteenth century, but there are aspects of the narrative that lead us to believethat it comports well with tradition, even if it the historical Egill never didwhat the story reports. Thus the use of anı ́5sto\u0001ngis treated elsewhere inNorse sources as real and as a chargeable offense, the verbsnu ́a‘turn’ (\u0002sny ́,sneri) in Nordic charm contexts appears to have a deep pedigree, and so on.Simply put, there is much about the scene of Egill’s imprecation that feelsright, both within Nordic praxis and as compared to wider European tradi-tions of cursing.161That is not to suggest that we can recontextualize a per-formance of this sort with accuracy but rather to note that the saga’s portrayalof this execration projects a worldview and a use of the tools of Nordic charmmagic in ways that seem entirely plausible.162The use of performance as a key for understanding Nordic charm magicholds great promise and is a perspective that has been heavily mined in otherareas of the Old Norse field in recent years.163Although the means and meth-ods of these writers have differed, the goal that Old Norse scholarship empha-sizing performance shares with parallel research on other cultures and epochsis to return the archaic cultural goods on which we work to the richly tex-tured contexts from which the stories have sprung; to derive from a consider-ation of performance contexts a deeper understanding of meaning; and toconsider whether their findings would be recognizable to the medieval audi-ences of the works.164Performance—at least in the sense modern scholarshipintends it—may indeed overlap partially with older arguments about oralitybut is distinct from it in that the goals and concerns of the two are oftenquite different. Focusing on performance theory allows us to shift our gazefrom a consideration of our medieval texts as determinate entities in them-selves and toward their place in a broader tradition of enactments and reen-actments.165Although the general nature of the curse inSkı ́rnisma ́lhas already beendiscussed earlier as part of Scandinavian traditions of ‘‘love magic,’’ it is wellworth considering it again in this context, and especially with regard to therich evidence the poem provides about the process of Skı ́rnir’s successfulmalediction. Thus, part of the reasonSkı ́rnisma ́lis so compelling to modern"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70chapter 2audiences depends on the central paradox that dominates it and its treatmentof the reluctant ‘‘bride’’ Ger1r.166The text is appropriately conceived of asbeing concerned mainly with sex and consuming desire, and only more ab-stractly with fertility, but the resolution of the poem’s central tension isachieved specifically by threatening Ger1r’s reproductive capacity with ananaphrodisiac imprecation.167A consideration of Skı ́rnir’s curse in its entiretymakes clear that when neither gifts nor threats to the physical well-being ofGer1r’s family accomplish his goal, Skı ́rnir turns to magic. In delivering thecurse, he punctuates, or perhaps partitions, the curse with references to themagic wand he carries, paralleling the way the sword operates in the earliersection of the dialogue when Skı ́rnir threatens the lives of Ger1r and herfamily.Using the references to the wand as markers partitioning the curse, it isapparent that the curse consists of, like Busla’s curse, three sections: first,Skı ́rnir says he will ‘‘tame’’ (temia)Ger1rtohiswillafterhehashitortouched her with it, and he then exiles Ger1r to a netherworld, telling hershe will be ugly and will know nothing but sorrow, and compares her to athistle at harvest time. Skı ́rnir now makes a second reference to the wand,and he explains how he got it by going to the forest, and then he declaresthat she has angered the gods. Calling on various races of supernatural beings,Skı ́rnir then denies her the enjoyment and use of men but says that a giantwill have her. Finally, in his third specific reference to the wand (v.36), hesays that he will write runes ‘‘for her,’’ which will give her madness, lechery,and restlessness. Alternatively, he can cancel these states by scratching awaythe runes.Skı ́rnir’s tripartite curse with its mix of oral cursing and runic writing isconsistent with other examples of Norse imprecations, at least as presentedin literary sources such asBo ́sa saga ok Herrau5sandEgils saga Skalla-Grı ́msso-nar. A performance such as that presented for Skı ́rnir also helps us understandwhat is at the heart of the historical data (e.g., the trial of Ragnhildr tregaga ́s)and some of the surviving rune sticks (e.g., N B257M). Busla’s curse mustbe understood as having been presented to the king near its conclusion in awritten runic form, one inconsistent with a purely oral presentation, just asSkı ́rnir carves runes during his charm. Egill too concludes his ritual by carv-ing in runes the words he has earlier uttered. In the fourteenth-century caseof Ragnhildr tregaga ́s, the records describing events, and particularly the per-formance of the curse around which the case turns, say at the exact momentwhere the curse is to be laid down ‘‘and when these words are read’’ (oc sidan"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Daily Life717esse ord ero lesen). Perhaps the wording of the bishop’s amanuensis at thisjuncture is to be taken literally—or perhaps not—but they seem to fit thelarger pattern of Nordic cursing.168The degree to which Skı ́rnir, Egill, and Busla are all portrayed as cursingin ways that mix speaking and writing belie the frequent treatment of thetwo communication modes as being in categorical opposition to one an-other.169This view appears to be codified in theGula7ingslo\u0001g(The Law ofGula7ing), for example: when in discussing the penalties fornı ́5‘insult’,‘libel’, ‘scorn’, the authors of the laws (dated in their current form to thethirteenth century) carefully distinguish betweentungunı ́5‘slander’ (lit.,‘tongue insult’, i.e., orally performed defamation) andtre ́nı ́5‘libel’ (lit., ‘treeinsult’, i.e., written or carved defamation).170Here the law writers are evi-dently providing the full range of expressive media, oral and written, or thatwhich is formed on the tongue and that which is formed on wood. But inthe area of Nordic charm magic, oral and written utterances do not representso much an opposition as a continuum, seemingly categorical oppositesbound together by the fact that both require actuation through performativeacts; moreover, despite the apparent oppositional nature suggested by writingand speaking, there exist numerous reticulated relationships between the twoas they were used in cursing, as may be readily inferred from our materials.It is, in fact, of no small consequence that—our embedded literary refer-ences aside, such as those inSkı ́rnisma ́l,Egils saga Skalla-Grı ́mssonar, andBo ́sasaga ok Herrau5s—the evidence for a Nordic tradition of charming consists toan unusual degree of what appear to be the realized end products of a magicalprocess, that is, the detritus of actual magical practices where the utteranceinstructions usually associated with the grimoires of Anglo-Saxon tradition,for example, have in Scandinavia actually been performed. Thus, althoughwe may lack texts comparable to the prescriptive charms of the Anglo-SaxonLacnunga(BL MS Harley585), Nordicists may take heart that, instead, wepossess such objects as the Bergen rune stick against which to measure textslikeSkı ́rnisma ́l. This object is no abstract recipe telling its user how to benda woman to one’s will, but rather a demonstration of the power of such acharm captured in flagrante delicto.Comparing, for example, these three literary portrayals of maledictionwith the one historical instance we possess from medieval Scandinavia wherethe art of malediction is drawn in some detail, the trial of Ragnhildr tregaga ́sin Bergen, provides us with an excellent sense of the ‘‘actual’’ nature of howincantation was performed. There is a lot to unpack in this story, including"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"72chapter 2that we begin to see continuities, as in the important phrasegondols onduandthe concern in the Norwegian laws for articles of witchcraft being hidden inbeds.171So, for example,Borgar7ingslo\u0001g(The Laws of Borgar7ing, datable tothe mid-twelfth century, although preserved only in later, mainly early four-teenth-century, manuscripts) state, ‘‘And if sorcery is found in bedding orbolster, the hair of a man, or nails or frog feet or other talismans which arethought wont in witchcraft, then a charge may be made.’’172Another important component in this case is the degree to which thedeclaration of the curse must be public—very public, in fact. Indeed, it isworth repeating the sequence of events here: on the first night of the wed-ding, Ragnhildr carries out the three fundamental aspects of the curse—hiding the objects in the bed, uttering the actual curse formula, and spittingon Ba ́r1r—but it is as if these action are not operational until she makes herpublic declaration of the curse. Thus Ragnhildr, the perpetrator of the charm,finds it necessary to go up to her rival at the wedding feast and declare openlythat she has made her erstwhile lover impotent—the possibility of revengefrom Ba ́r1r and his party, or of accusation from the authorities, seems not tobe a consideration for her, so critical an element to the success of the charmdoes broadcasting the news seem to be. Performance matters, and it is obvi-ous that how things are done is nowhere of greater relevance than in thecontext of highly prescribed ritualized behavior of the sort one associates withcasting a spell.173Much has been made of the fact thatgaldr, one of the most commonwords in Old Norse for ‘magic’, ‘witchcraft’, and ‘sorcery’ but also morenarrowly for ‘magic song’, ‘charm’, is historically related togala‘to crow; tochant, sing’, the same root that yields in English such words as ‘yell’, ‘yelp’,and the last element of ‘nightingale’.174In fact, the terms used for the witches’spells and charms are frequently based on words having to do with song (orthe noise and sound by which incantations are produced), nomenclature thathas subsequently attached itself both to the individuals carrying out the per-formance and the act itself. And this association extends well beyond theGermanic dialects. Thus when the Roman poet Horace describes the incanta-tions of several witches (Satires1.8.25), he says that they, Canidia and Sagana,ululantem‘cry out, shriek, yell’ (cf.ulula‘screech owl’). A whole series ofwords in Latin, often with modern resonances—carmen‘song, charm, ritualformula’,cantus‘song, incantation, spell’,cantio‘singing, incantation, spell’,cantare‘to sing, bewitch’—points to the same association.

Are they to be regarded as statements about what medieval Iceland-ers and other Scandinavians—or perhaps their forebears—actually thoughtabout magic and witchcraft, or are they tendentious documents written forthe very purpose of shaping what their readers and other audience membersshould think, or yet again, are they some other sort of mediating alternative?Impinging too in significant ways on how these documents should be under-stood are questions of patronage, authorship, intended audience, relationshipto the past, and other issues related to the social production of these texts,important but not always knowable facts.An illuminating example of this dilemma in the East Norse area is theanthology known asFornsvenska legendariet(The Old Swedish Legendary), avast compilation originally executed in the late thirteenth century, largelybuilt on theLegenda aurea(Golden Legend) of Jacobus de Voragine, showingknowledge of texts such as theChronicon pontificum et imperatorum(Chroni-cle of Popes and Emperors) of Martinus Oppsaviensis and German works suchasSa ̈chsische Weltchronik(Saxon World Chronicle).

Speculation hascentered on the Beguine population in Ska ̈nninge, or some other femalereligious community, but to date no clear answer has emerged.4Notwith-standing this lacuna in our most basic understanding of the work’s back-ground, scholars reasonably, and profitably, look to mine the collection forall sorts of information, not least reflections of church thinking about witch-craft and magic at that time.Other layers of cultural context can occasionally further cloud our abilityto understand medieval Nordic literature, especially the question of a text’srelationship to the past and the degree to which, say, a fourteenth-centurywork informs us, or can inform us, not only about the views contemporarywith its composition but also about those from earlier periods. Obviously,medieval textual culture was anything but a perfect mirror of the past, yet itwas undoubtedly capable of being informed by traditions about the past,and sometimes even of preserving with accuracy information from the past,although historicity in these instances is a hotly debated topic.5One notedscholar in the area, Pernille Hermann, reasonably argues that we regard theliterature produced in medieval Iceland as both a preservation ofthepast andthe creation ofapast.6How then are we to understand the considerable literary resources of thelater Nordic Middle Ages when looking to interpret attitudes toward magicand witchcraft in that period? In my opinion they represent an extraordinaryresearch opportunity to be neither ignored, at one extreme, nor simply ac-cepted at face value, at the other, but are rather a tool to be used with duecaution. Jenny Jochens wisely remarked some years ago that even though theyare not spotless mirrors of bygone eras, the Icelandic sagas ‘‘can tell us whatthe thirteenth-century authors wanted their audiences to believe about pastbehavior. . . .’’7It is in this sense, as mainly thirteenth-and fourteenth-centuryuses of the past to express contemporary perspectives, that we should encoun-ter the descriptions of historical sorcerers, witches, and magic.8At the sametime, however, we need to recall that these phenomena had not died out asactive forces within Scandinavian society, meaning that representations ofpast magical practices sometimes also resonate with contemporary realities.Also important to bear in mind is that although we as modern readersare naturally drawn to the brilliance of the Icelandic sagas, given their origi-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76chapter 3nality, well-told tales, and promise of shedding light on the Middle Ages(especially when set against the comparatively dim wattage of many othermedieval literatures), these texts were by no means the only, or even themain, sort of narratives known throughout late medieval Scandinavia. In-deed, many different forms of narrative materials—saints’ lives and translatedromances, of course, but also histories, moralizing tales, even sermons andprivate prayer books—also represent important, if generally less original,sources of information. These too are taken up here in order to provide amore complete impression of how magic and witchcraft were presented andshaped in the spiritual culture of medieval Scandinavia.Icelandic Poetry and SagasIn discussing magic and witchcraft in medieval Scandinavian narratives, Iseparate out for special attention the poetry and prose of Iceland. TreatingIceland in this manner, although justifiable, does run the risk of valorizingIcelandic culture in a peculiar way, suggesting, for example, that it wasuniquely conservative or culturally isolated, insular in more than simply geo-graphical terms. That, of course, would be nonsense. On the other hand,‘‘Icelandic exceptionalism,’’ as it sometimes called, is not without merit. Thenotion of medieval Icelandic narrative sensibility and memory being out ofthe ordinary can be justified initially by turning to the opinions of medievalScandinavians themselves: Saxo Grammaticus and the author ofHistoria deantiquitate regum Norwagiensum(The Ancient History of the NorwegianKings), Theodoricus, both writing in the late twelfth century, suggest thatIcelandic knowledge of Nordic traditions was extraordinary, more so than inthe other Scandinavian lands.9Moreover, the sheer volume of original mate-rials produced by Icelandic authors dwarfs the literary endeavors of the otherNordic countries. To suggest that there was not something special about themedieval Icelandic situation—or at least the quality and volume of its literaryproduction, in any event—would be equally unwarranted.Undoubtedly the single most important cultural object to come fromthe Scandinavian Middle Ages for our understanding of the pre-Christiantraditions of Scandinavia is the collection known as thePoetic Edda.10It isfrom this remarkable presentation of Norse mythology and heroic literaturethat we have many of the centerpieces about the role of magic in pre-Christian Scandinavia, such asSkı ́rnisma ́l(The Lay of Skı ́rnir) andHa ́vama ́l"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic77(The Sayings of the High One). The manuscript of this anthology dates toabout1270, but something like the current collection must have existed al-ready earlier in the century.11It is useful to consider the very fact that athirteenth-century Icelander found assembling, or copying, this manuscriptworthwhile. That is not as uncomplicated an idea as it may seem and shouldraise any number of questions about the value and function of such poetryin Christian Iceland.12What, for example, are we to conclude when the poemcalledVo\u0001luspa ́(The Seeress’ Prophecy) appears in thePoetic Edda(ca.1270), aswell as in the fourteenth-century collection known asHauksbo ́k,andis exten-sively cited in the early thirteenth-centuryars poeticaknown asSnorra edda(theYoungerorProse Edda)?13That is, the poem is recorded, copied, cited—opinions vary but, in any event, used—on three occasions over the course ofa century. May we not reasonably suppose that these facts speak not only tothe relative popularity of that particular text but also more broadly to theappeal of visionary literature in that period, especially when other kindredworks, albeit with a more Christian tone, are considered?14In other words, we need to be aware that these texts, although occasion-ally harking back to earlier periods, also had their own relevance to the thir-teenth and fourteenth centuries and were in all likelihood not merelypreserved in them. Although they may represent memories from, or represen-tations of, the past, these poems are hardly likely to have been mere culturalatavisms, recorded only through some reawakened antiquarian interest: theysurely meant something to the people who wrote them down and to thosewho in turn heard or read them. Producing manuscripts of this sort wasserious business in terms of economic and social costs, that is, the actualmanufacture of vellum, the training of a scribe, the ‘‘opportunity costs’’ (i.e.,the loss of labor that could be used in other ways), and so on. Seriousness ofpurpose lay behind the production of such manuscripts.Given that fact, how much we know about Nordic mythology is surpris-ing, for, in addition to the eddic poems, a variety of other narratives, such asSnorri’s edda, saga texts, and non-Icelandic sources, such as Saxo’sGestaDanorum(History of the Danes), provides us with the sometimes conflictingoutlines of Nordic paganism.15Witchcraft and magic as projected in themythological corpus are complex phenomena in which charms, incantations,and sacrifice play significant roles. These cultural products are heavily tied tothe worship of the pre-Christian gods, among whom the use of magic isshown—in eddic poetry in particular—to be common.The deities O ́1inn and Freyja were outlined in Chapter1. Here I revisit"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"78chapter 3them and, in particular, their connections with magic. Certainly the principalpagan deity tied to magic in the extant poetry is O ́1inn, nowhere more clearlyso than inHa ́vama ́l.16Structurally, the poem moves from the quotidian (e.g.,advice on how to comport oneself as a guest) to the arcane (e.g., claims toknowledge of various spells). Just prior to the so-calledLjo ́5atal(List ofChants, st.146–64), O ́1inn asks if the listener knows certain kinds of arcanethings, including how to sacrifice, and then enumerates in the list itself eigh-teen different charms that he claims to know, covering such areas as illness,courage on the battlefield, weather, countercharms against hostile magic, de-fense against hags (tu ́nri5or), settling discord, communicating with the dead,and seducing women.And just before this section,Ha ́vama ́lrecounts how O ́1inn sacrificeshimself to himself and in so doing acquires the runes (nam ec upp ru ́nar),‘‘nine mighty songs’’ (fimbullio ́5nı ́o), as well as fecundity and knowledge (7a ́nam ec frævaz / oc fro ́5r vera).17O ́1inn’s acquisition of runic knowledge thusallows him to manipulate fertility and wisdom, as we have seen in the case ofthe charms discussed earlier. It is O ́1inn who engages the seeress (vo\u0001lva)inthe poem calledVo\u0001luspa ́and queries her about the past and future events, asshe herself makes clear when she describes him looking into her eyes andaddresses him directly.18Arguments abound as to how the framing scenarioof the poem should be understood, but whether the seeress is awakened fromthe dead, for example, as some believe, or constrained by O ́1inn by othermeans to tell him what he wants to know, it is clearly he who is the necro-mancer.The image of O ́1inn, not only as a pagan deity, but also as a magician—indeed, the chief of magicians—is widespread. So, for example, in his earlythirteenth-century edda, Snorri Sturluson presents a catalogue of Odinic cog-nomina and other references to the god in the poetry of the ‘‘main poets’’(ho\u0001fu5ska ́ldin).19There, among the various references to O ́1inn’s connectionwith the dead, his acquisition of the poetic mead, his coming death at Rag-naro\u0001k, and other stories about him, Snorri cites Korma ́kr’s comment thatO ́1inn had worked magic on Rindr.20This story is connected with the deathof Baldr, foreshadowing the passing of the old generation of gods at the finalgreat battle between the gods and the forces of evil.21This myth complex,known from disparate sources, provides a fine illustration of O ́1inn as necro-mancer and worker of spells.According to Icelandic sources, following Baldr’s death at the hands ofhis brother, Ho\u00011r, O ́1inn begets another son, Va ́li, with Rindr. In the eddic-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic79style poemBaldrs draumar(Baldr’s Dreams), Baldr is disturbed by baddreams, causing O ́1inn, ‘‘the father of magic’’ (galdrs fo\u00015ur) to ride to Hel.22There, in a scene clearly parallel toVo\u0001luspa ́, he usesvalgaldr‘charms to raisethe dead’ to awaken a dead witch.23In response to his repeated command,‘‘Cease not, seeress, / till said thou hast,’’ she reveals that he will father achild, Va ́li, who will avenge his brother, using nearly the same words foundinVo\u0001luspa ́(st.33).24Although Snorri lists Rindr among the goddesses, littleis known of her apart from the idea that she is said to bear O ́1inn a son whoavenges his brother.In his late twelfth-centuryGesta Danorum(book3), the Danish chroni-cler Saxo Grammaticus provides a very different, albeit related, story, inwhich O ́1inn (Othinus) attempts through a variety of means, including mili-tary prowess and producing jewelry, to win the woman, now called Rinda,but to no avail. Finally, in the guise of a female physician, O ́1inn seizes hisopportunity when she falls ill and instructs that she be tied down, due to theviolent reaction the medicine will produce. Once secured, he rapes her.O ́1inn’s ‘‘success’’ in Saxo is thus the result of his guileful nature, not magic.In fact, here O ́1inn is mostly presented as an end user, not a producer, ofmagic—likewise, at the beginning of the episode, Saxo writes, ‘‘Now al-though Odin was regarded as chief of the gods, he would constantly approachseers, soothsayers and other whom he had discovered strong in the finest artsof prediction, with a view to prosecuting vengeance for his son.’’25DespiteO ́1inn’s relatively slight association with magic in Saxo’s version of the Rindastory, he does retain some magical abilities. When at one point Rinda refuseshis advances by pushing him so that he falls to the floor, O ́1inn responds bytouching her with an inscribed piece of bark, which causes her to go mad fora while, but her later sickness, which gives O ́1inn his opportunity to sireVa ́li, apparently has nothing to do with this episode.26When Snorri takes up the figure of O ́1inn inYnglingasaga(Saga of theYnglings), the opening text inHeimskringla, like Saxo, he too presents a euhe-merized O ́1inn. The chief of the gods in other sources, he is said to be ahuman ruler who migrates north with his followers. And here magic is notonly a significant feature, but one of its chief organizing principles. Perhapsone of the most intriguing comments Snorri makes is his insistence, repeatedseveral times, that O ́1inn’s magical practices continued for a long time.27Among his magical abilities, O ́1inn could make his enemies blind, deaf, orterrified in battle and dull and bend their weapons. Moreover, he possessesthe ability to change his physical shape, lying as if dead or asleep, yet moving"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80chapter 3about in different places in the shape of a bird, animal, fish, or snake.28Healso possesses the ability with words alone to put out fires, calm the seas, andturn the wind in different directions.29These skills he taught ‘‘with thoserunes and songs called incantations,’’ and it is for this reason the Æsir arecalled sorcerers (galdrasmi5ir, lit., ‘magic-smiths’).30The location of buried treasures is known to him, and he knows thosesongs by which the earth, rocks, stones, and mounds are unlocked and couldwith words alone bind those who live in them and go in and take what hewanted.31And he uses the dead, occasionally waking them up or sitting underthe hanged, for which reason he was called lord of ghosts and lord of thehanged.32The greatest power of all, however, resides in that art (7a ́ı ́7ro ́tt)which O ́1inn knew and practiced, namely,sei5r.33Through it, he could haveknowledge of the fates of men and things that had not yet happened andcould cause in people death, bad luck, or illness and transfer wisdom orstrength from one person and give it to someone else. But because this formof witchcraft (fjo\u0001lkynngi) was followed by so muchergi, that is, ‘lewdness’,‘lust’, it was thought shameful for men to practice it, and therefore it wastaught to priestesses.34O ́1inn is tied closely to magic of all sorts, and the full range of magicalactivities associated with him and, important for us, known to medieval Ice-landic Christian writers included (1)galdrarand runic magic, (2)sei5r, and(3) other magical skills where the termsfjo\u0001lkyngi,fro ́5leikr, andljo ́5would beappropriate terms.35The first group, following Price, included shape-shiftingand ethereal travel; control of fires, water, and wind; communicating withthe dead; helping spirits such as Huginn and Muninn; travel on the magicalship Skı ́1bla1nir. The second group included divination, killing, causingsickness, inflicting misfortune, decreasing or increasing the wit of people, anddecreasing or increasing the strength of people. The third included revealingwhat is hidden; opening stones, mounds, and the underground; and bindingtheir inhabitants. Whatever O ́1inn’s role within the ‘‘actual’’ practice of thepre-Christian religion of the Nordic world—a topic of considerable de-bate—he was certainly the key figure in the post-Conversion presentations ofthat mythology where magic was concerned.36It would be difficult indeed to disambiguate the use of magic from thepresentation of O ́1inn, but other figures too, especially the goddess Freyja,are also associated with enchantment.37Ynglingasagastates that Freyja teachessei5rto the Æsir, because it was a custom among her people, the Vanir.38Vo\u0001luspa ́maintains that magic (sei5r) was taught to the gods by a female figure,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic81generally believed to be Freyja.39And the argument for her special connectionto the magical world is surely strengthened, when inHyndluljo ́5(Chant ofHyndla) Freyja plays a role very like O ́1inn’s, in that the goddess stirs avo\u0001lvaawake and discovers from her what she needs to know.40In fact, one scholarhas argued that Freyja should be understood as the Nordic resonance of ‘‘thegreat goddess’’ and thus holds a special relationship to such areas as fate.41The image of magic and those who employ it—witches, prophetesses,gods—that emerges from eddic poetry tells us that these concepts were fun-damental to that mythological and heroic world. A verse fromVo\u0001luspa ́inskamma(The Shorter Vo\u0001luspa ́orSeeress’ Prophecy) lists several types of en-chanters, provided with, one suspects, an eye toward gender.42In explainingthat giants (hrı ́m7ursar,jo\u0001tnar) descend from Ymir, Snorri cites part of thepoem: all prophetesses (vo\u0001lur), it says, come from Vi1o ́lfr, all wizards (vitkar)from Vilmei1r, all practitioners of sorcery (sei5berendr) from Svartho\u0001f1i.43Itis difficult to escape the impression that exactly these terms are selected be-cause the people to whom they refer encompass users who are explicitly bothfemales and males.The most dramatic presentation of magic being used in eddic poetry is,as discussed in Chapter2, surelySkı ́rnisma ́l, but similar in many ways is theeddic-style poem calledGro ́galdr(Magic of Gro ́a).44It is one of two poems inljo ́5aha ́ttrthat make up the work known collectively asSvipdagsma ́l.45Extantin several dozens of post-Reformation manuscripts, these works too arethought to be from the mid-thirteenth century. InGro ́galdr, Svipdagr is giventhe task of searching for and winning the giantess Menglo\u00011. He seeks theadvice and help of his dead mother, Gro ́a, who provides him with ninecharms. InFjo\u0001lsvinnsma ́l, Svipdagr encounters a castle surrounded by flames.A watchman starts to send him away, but in their knowledge confrontation,the watchman makes known that Menglo\u00011is there and awaits a particularhero. When Svipdagr reveals his true name, the gates open, and he is receivedby the maiden.Gro ́galdrhighlights two aspects of magic as it is portrayed inpresentations of the pagan world—the importance of knowing charms andthe use of necromancy. In that sense, the poem is very similar to the ‘‘List ofChants’’ section ofHa ́vama ́l(albeit the number of charms is reduced to ninefrom eighteen) and shares withBaldrs draumar,Vo\u0001luspa ́, and other texts themotif of the awakened witch or seeress.A further poetic genre, peculiar to Iceland, should be mentioned in thiscontext, therı ́mur.This form of epic poetry is not in evidence before thevery late fourteenth century, quickly becoming one of the most productive"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82chapter 3types of Icelandic literature over the next half millennium.46Often based onfornaldarso\u0001gur, romances, and other texts, these popular works use highlystylized diction and elaborate metaphors and combine traditional alliterativemeters with end rhyme. Frequently reworked from sagas and other literature,therı ́muroften reflect the original text’s presentation of the magical world,one in which sorcerers and sorceresses play the role of adversaries to the hero,along with, as Ve ́steinn O ́lason notes, ‘‘cruel Vikings,’’ giants, and dwarves.47So, for example, inFri57jo ́fs rı ́mur, therı ́murform ofFri57jo ́fs saga frækna(The Saga of Fri57jo ́fr the Bold), the hero’s enemies employ two transvectingwitches (hamhleypur) who try to work their magic against Fri13jo ́fr, verymuch, but not exactly, as in the saga.48Among the originalrı ́mur, the most famous,Ski5arı ́ma(Skı ́5i’s Rı ́mur),is a parody, in this instance of both vision literature and the old gods.49In it,the hero is a tramp who has a dream in which he goes to Valho\u0001ll, where heis to help make peace. There he meets many of the figures from the mytho-logical and heroic world, including O ́1inn,4o ́rr, Baldr, Heimdall, andFreyja. But rather than quelling disturbances, Skı ́1i causes them, especiallywhen he cannot refrain from referring to the Christian God in front of theold gods (st.110–11), including making the sign of the cross (Skı ́5igo\u0001r5iskyndikross, st.123). As a result, fighting breaks out between the various figuresknown from Scandinavia’s mythological and heroic world. SharingSki5arı ́-ma’s interest in the pagan god,Lokrur, for example, recounts the story knownfrom Snorri’s edda in which4o ́rr and Loki visit U ́tgar1a-Loki.50Theserı ́mur,as well as the pagan theophanies in some of the sagas, make it apparent thatknowledge, and use, of the old gods was continuous throughout the IcelandicMiddle Ages.Magic unattached to the pre-Christian gods also plays an important rolein these texts. A typical example comes from arı ́murtied to the Europeantradition about Virgil.51The hero hopes to seduce a king’s daughter, but shesoon proves herself to be more than his equal. When they meet, the twodiscuss ‘‘book-learning and all kinds of tricks.’’52One might expect the termtranslated here as ‘‘tricks’’ (brag5) to refer to a physical ruse, but as therı ́murmakes clear, the tricks here and elsewhere are more than just sleight of hand.53In fact, Virgiles says that if she will not do as he asks, he will have to usesomelistar[sg.,list] ‘art, craft, skill’, a word often employed to refer to magic.But it is she who outsmarts him, asking him to transform himself into ahorse, which he does, at which point she rides him all over the countryside.54Magic also plays an important role in the saga literature of medieval"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic83Iceland. For the scholar approaching the topic from the point of view ofa modified cognitive realism, there is little comparable to these medievalnarratives.55As noted earlier, the relationship of the past to the present, andhow medieval Icelanders used the one to comment on the other, is of para-mount importance to our consideration of the presentation of witchcraft inthe sagas. More broadly, the historical worth of these narratives has been atthe center of scholarly activity for centuries. A complex debate evolvedaround the question of cultural realism in these medieval prose texts, formu-lated in the earliest periods by the view that the sagas might be understoodas history rather than as historical fiction and, more recently, as testimony tothe history of mentalities.56The evolution of this debate develops around thecentral question of just what sort of cultural documents we have in the sagas,with the key issue being the degree to which they can be trusted to presentin a reliable form ethnographic data.57The questionable verisimilitude ofthese works did not, for example, stop generations of early modern nationalistwriters from exploiting their contents to bolster competing claims to territoryand prestige, especially in the context of seventeenth-century Dano-Swedishantagonisms.58That is not to say that these early modern polemicists did nothave reasons to see the sagas and other medieval texts as rich resources hold-ing out the possibility for recovering the past. After all, some of the best-known legendary cycles of medieval Northern Europe are based on history:Icelandic sagas about Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, Theodorik, andSaint O ́la ́fr are all, at whatever remove and however thinly, informed bytraditions inspired by actual events.59Moreover, the fact that the very wordsagaitself meant ‘story’, ‘history’, and ‘account’, as well as the specific literarygenre its use conjures nowadays in almost all modern languages, addedweight to the view that the events contained in them were based on realityreasonably well preserved.60But as those early uses of medieval literature, and the charged politicaland nationalist debates to which they were tied, receded into the past, thehistorical accuracy of the medieval sagas took on new meaning. The softskepticism of earlier historians working to promote their respective home-lands’ claims to political and cultural hegemony in Northern Europe gaveway in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to a new literalist phase, styledFreeprose-Bookprose by one of the debate’s participants.61As an intellectualmatter, this discussion looked to explain the compositional techniques usedin the production of the sagas. In broad terms, Freeprose advocates believedin texts of such strong oral character that their form became memorized and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84chapter 3fixed. That fixed form, in turn, was understood to convey from generation togeneration highly accurate historical information. Bookprose partisans arguedinstead for something similar to modern authorship, often using the belief inthe sagas’ historical accuracy as a means of demonstrating the flaws in theiropponents’ views.62To the degree the sagas reflected individuals, places, andevents verifiable through other kinds of evidence, they supported the Free-prose position; to the degree that the sagas could be shown to be filled withunhistorical matter, foreign borrowings, and imagined details, on the otherhand, they could be shown to be Icelandic texts composed, mainly, in thethirteenth century.At another level, this academic debate was a proxy war of words for adifferent issue that can only be understood in the context of the Nordicworld’s long history of inter-Scandinavian colonialism, as sentiment for polit-ical independence grew in Norway and Iceland. To the degree that the sagaswere seen to be specifically Icelandic products, they bolstered Icelandic claimsto autonomy, but to the degree that these wonderful medieval texts wereunderstood to be the end products of a literary form developed and refinedalready in Norway, and brought by its emigrants to Iceland during the settle-ment era, then they helped support Norwegian claims of cultural maturityand thus a ratification of its demands for political independence.63It was thus against a complicated background that a neoliteralist positionbegan to emerge several decades ago. More subtle than that label perhapssuggests, it is a view that appreciates the arguments and concerns of previousgenerations about reading too much historicity into these manifestly literaryworks but at the same time refuses to dismiss the possibility of cautiouslymining the medieval sagas for historical data that can be used in combinationwith other cultural monuments to shed light on the medieval period.64Natu-rally, progress in this regard was not made in a vacuum. Among the mostimportant developments in refining our thinking about treating historicalsources in the years intervening between the earlier discussions and the cur-rent situation may be seen in the rise of such methodologies as ethnohistoryand microhistory,65as well as a more subtle notion of how studies of oralitycan help us understand the social production of the sagas.66Of equal impor-tance has been the consideration in recent years of different kinds of memoryin shaping the sagas.67The sheer number of sagas makes some sort of organizational scheme indiscussing them advisable. Although many attempts at establishing classifica-tory schemes have been made over the years,68one idea scholarship has widely"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic85applauded (if not always embraced), which has evident relevance to this dis-cussion, is the proposal by Sigur1ur Nordal that rather than accepting tradi-tional genre designations we adopt a system that disregards such features asthe nature of the hero and focuses instead on the very tangible element ofthe sagas’ ‘‘pastness.’’69This term is not one he uses but is easily teased outof his work and suggests a novel scheme for organizing medieval Icelandicliterature. The argument proposes dividing the sagas into three categories,based on the distance from the cultural moment they treat and the time thatgave the saga birth.70Thus he proposes categories for sagas that (1) deal withthe distant past, before the settlement of Iceland (i.e., mainly the so-calledfornaldarso\u0001gur[mythical-heroic, or legendary sagas] andriddaraso\u0001gur[chival-ric sagas], but also such works asYnglingasaga); (2) are concerned with eventsduring the first centuries of the settlement of Iceland, from the mid-ninthcentury to circa1100(i.e., manyı ́slendingaso\u0001gur[family sagas], somekonunga-so\u0001gur[kings’ sagas]); and (3) are more proximate to the thirteenth century, acategory that includes most of the various texts that make up the synoptichistory of Iceland known asSturlunga saga, as well as some kings’ and bish-ops’ sagas. Although some of these latter texts are truly contemporary, some,for example, would treat twelfth-century events but are held to be based onobservations and reports of those living at the time. He labels these groupsoldtidssager,fortidssagaer, andsamtidssagaer—that is, sagas of antiquity, sagasof the past, and contemporary sagas.This temporal, and notably past-oriented, approach is particularly help-ful here, for, as is frequently noted, there is relatively little witchcraft in thecontemporary sagas.71Indeed, it was almost always understood in relation-ship to paganism and to the problem of lingering pagan superstitions. Conti-nental views about the nature of witchcraft naturally gained acceptance overtime in the Nordic world and certainly shaped its understanding of the phe-nomenon, but the association with heathenism was rarely far away. And, aswill be discussed later, witchcraft and magic became convenient signs withwhich authors might indicate a sense of the text’s remoteness and connectionto the hoary past. With this tripartite system in mind, I take up in thefollowing the role of magic and witchcraft in selected examples of medievalIcelandic sagas.72In dealing with the earliest period, before the settlement of Iceland andthe so-called sagas of antiquity (oldtidssager), an obvious place to begin is thethirteenth-centuryYnglingasaga, both because of its relatively certain date ofcomposition and because of the famous position it occupies in discussions of"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86chapter 3Norse magic. It is situated as the first narrative in Snorri Sturluson’s compre-hensive history of the Norwegian kings,Heimskringla.73Partially based on anearlier scaldic poem,Ynglingatal, assigned by tradition to the poet4jo ́1o ́lfru ́r Hvin, whom Snorri quotes generously,Ynglingasagapresents its audiencewith the earliest traditions of the royal houses of Sweden and Norway—thearrival in the north of the ‘‘gods’’ and the descent of the Ynglings.74Once magical power is introduced among the Ynglings, it haunts them:indeed, several of the early Yngling rulers die in ways that appear to mimicthe possibilities of what the saga earlier says about O ́1inn’s dark knowledge.Thus, where O ́1inn can calm the seas with his magic, King Fjo\u0001lnir drownsin a beer-brewing vat; where O ́1inn knows the charms by which the rocksand stones are unlocked, King Sveg1ir enters a stone, never to return; andwhere O ́1inn can send his spirit out in the shape of various animals as he liesin a sleeplike state, King Vanlandi is ‘‘ridden’’ to death in his sleep by a night-mare, trampled in the most literal sense, as4jo ́1o ́lfr suggests, by the troll-woman.This last episode suggests another frequent theme in the sagas, the degreeto which magic is attached to the idea of ‘‘the other.’’75Thus Freyja is saidto have brought magic in the form ofsei5rto the Æsir from her people, theVanir, and the projection of magical abilities onto differing peoples has manyresonances in the Nordic materials.76King Vanlandi’s adventures illustratethis idea. He spends a winter ‘‘in Finland’’ (a ́Finnlandi), where he acquiresa wife, Drı ́fa.77He promises to return, and when, after ten years, he has not,Drı ́fa contacts a witch named Hul1, whom she instructs to make Vanlandireturn to Finland; failing that, she is to kill him. When Hul1performs hermagic, Vanlandi senses a great desire to go to Finland but is advised againstit by his friends and advisors, who say that his urge must be due to the magicof the Finns (fjo\u0001lkynngi Finna). He now falls asleep and is trampled to deathby a night-mare, that is, Hul1in the shape of a horse, or what in othercontexts would be called an incubus. As4jo ́1o ́lfr says,A vile witchcaused Vanlandito visitVili’s brother [i.e., O ́1inn in Valho\u0001ll; ‘to visit Vili’s brother’\u0002todie],when that trodthe troll-woman,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic87wicked wench,the warrior king;was he burnedon bank of Sku ́ta,noble prince, whomthe nightmare killed.78Of a very different character, although its composition is also separatedby many centuries from its cultural moment, isFri57jo ́fs saga frækna, docu-mented only in post-Reformation manuscripts and in therı ́murtradition.Although not preserved in any directly medieval manuscript, it is thought tohave been composed in the later Middle Ages, presumably in the postclassicalera.79It is perhaps the best-known saga of the non-Icelandic nineteenth cen-tury due to its rewritten and modernized form in Swedish asFritjofs saga,apoem reportedly translated into every European language.80Fri13jo ́fr is the son of4orsteinn Vı ́kingsson, himself the subject of a sagaknown from late medieval manuscripts,8orsteins saga Vı ́kingssonar(The Sagaof8orsteinn Vı ́kingr’s Son), which forms a prequel toFri57jo ́fs saga frækna.81These two sagas, which recount the adventures of three generations of he-roes—Vı ́kingr,4orsteinn, and Fri13jo ́fr—from Sognefjord in western Nor-way, are set in a period before the Viking Age, some six or seven centuriesbefore the time from which the texts derive.

Vı ́kingrand his men take Dı ́s, place a skin bag over her head and stone her to death,proclaiming that they will now go to India. They capture I ́ngjaldr and bindhim, but he manages to escape through means the saga wryly suggests werethought to be due to Ingjaldr’s witchcraft.85In a subsequent battle withVı ́kingr and his men, I ́ngjaldr suddenly disappears, and in his place appearsa boar, which attacks Vı ́kingr’s men. Vı ́kingr eventually slices the animalalong its back, and ‘‘they saw that I ́ngjaldr lay there dead, then they starteda fire and burned him to cold ashes.’’86Vı ́kingr and his sworn brothers, Ha ́lfda ́n and Njo ̈rfi, now settle down.Njo ̈rfi and Vı ́kingr each father nine sons. To4orsteinn, on whose exploits theremainder of the saga focuses, Vı ́kingr gives his magical sword, A ́ngrva1ill, aweapon that had once belonged to Kolr. Through witchcraft, Kolr hadcaused it to be the only weapon that could be his children’s bane, whereasno other iron could bite them (le ́t sei5a till7ess, at ekki vopn skyldi at banaver5ao ̈llu hans afsprengi, utan sver5it A ́ngrva5ill).87The principal conflict of the latter portion of8orsteins saga Vı ́kingssonarinvolves a blood feud between these two families. After the slaying of one ofthe sons of Njo ̈rfi, several of Vı ́kingr’s sons, including4orsteinn, take refugeon an island in Lake Va ̈nnern. Jo ̈kull, one of Njo ̈rfi’s sons, prepares an attackon them, and the aquatic defense of the natural moat behind which Vı ́kingr’ssons have ensconced themselves is undone when one of Jo ̈kull’s men volun-teers, ‘‘I have a certain bag, called a weather bag; if I shake it, then out of itstorm and wind blows with such fierceness and cold that within three nightssuch strong ice will be on the lake that horses can be ridden on it, if youwant.’’88This man, O ́gautan, is introduced earlier in the saga in a markedway when he and his brother, Gautan, arrive at Njo ̈rfi’s court in dark bluecloaks.89Although Njo ̈rfi is ill-disposed toward them, his thoroughly mali-cious son, Jo ̈kull, offers them a place among his followers, seeing them asmen with special talents (ı ́7ro ́ttirmenn nokkrir).Jo ̈kull asks O ́gautan whether he cannot through his arts discover (vissver5ame5listum7ı ́num) the whereabouts of Vı ́kingr’s sons.

They are provided with an outbuilding (skemma), and whenJo ̈kull arrives early on the third day, O ́gautan tells him where the sons ofVı ́kingr are hiding, leading to the previously mentioned cold weather remark.In the ensuing battle, only two brothers from each of the families survive,and the story follows for a while a series of largely incidental magical events(e.g., a fight with one combatant wearing a helmet with a magic stone pre-venting the wearer from falling in battle). The narrative now turns to Skati,king of the Sogn region, and his son, Beli, and daughter, I ́ngibjo ̈rg, who, thesaga helpfully explains, is not then in the kingdom, as she is under a spell.90Years before, two Vikings, Gautan and O ́gautan, had killed King Skati. O ́gau-tan becomes king and asks I ́ngibjo ̈rg to marry him, an idea she rejects, sayingthat she would rather kill herself than marry the slayer of her father andsomeone who looks more like a fiend than a human.Vengefully, O ́gautan curses her (leg ek7at a ́7ik), saying she will in size,appearance, and nature be like his sister, Skellingnefja, live in a cave, and notbe able to break the curse until he himself is dead and a man of noble birth(velborinn ma5r) promises to marry her; moreover, his sister will take on herappearance.91Remarkably, I ́ngibjo ̈rg attempts a countercurse and declaresthat O ́gautan will only enjoy his kingdom poorly and for a short while. It is,however, O ́gautan’s imprecation that comes true (a ́hrı ́nsor5um), and I ́ngibj-o ̈rg suddenly disappears.Her brother, Beli, retakes the kingdom, and the brothers, Gautan andO ́gautan, escape to King Njo ̈rfi’s court. Jo ̈kull and Beli now vie for the handof the same woman, O ́lo ̈f, and she is asked which of the two she wouldmarry. She is about to select Beli, when ‘‘at that moment, O ́gautan threw astick of wood in her lap, and it startled her such that she turned down Beliand married Jo ̈kull.’’92Hearing that4orsteinn is sailing, Jo ̈kull consults withO ́gautan, asking him to use his talents to raise a storm against4orsteinn (okba5hann reyna listir sı ́nar ok gera ve5rat8orsteini). O ́gautan then creates agreat magical tempest (kyngive5r) against4orsteinn, in which all his men aredrowned.4orsteinn is saved by a hideous woman wearing an ill-fitting leathercloak—too long in front, too short in back.93The text now returns to the homeward journey of O ́gautan and Jo ̈kullfollowing their successful trip to woo O ́lo ̈f. Suddenly, in good weather, agreat darkness envelopes the ship, together with a terrible chill, and when thedarkness lifts, the men see O ́gautan hanging dead from the masthead.4ors-teinn engages in yet another battle with Jo ̈kull and, having lost his grip onthe sword, A ́ngrva1ill, is rescued by Skellinefja, who looks, as the saga says,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90chapter 3‘‘no fairer than before’’ (o ̈ngu fegri enn fyrr). When he now promises to marryher in exchange for her help (including the further need for her to retrieveA ́ngrva1ill), she reveals that he has now helped release her from the curseO ́gautan had placed on her.94A series of more mundane battles and a fewfurther encounters with the supernatural conclude the saga.The story of the third member of this family, the eponymous hero ofFri57jo ́fs saga fræknaand the son of4orsteinn Vı ́kingr’s Son, is a tale ofparted lovers, and it too is partially shaped by the deeds of practitioners ofmagic, if not quite so thoroughly as the narratives about Fri13jo ́fr’s forebears.The basic story here is one in which Fri13jo ́fr incurs the hatred of I ́ngibjo ̈rg’sbrothers, all three of them the offspring of King Beli. In order to keep thetwo lovers away from each other, and in order to punish Fri13jo ́fr for havingviolated the sanctity of Baldr’s Pasture (Baldrshagi) in having visited I ́ngibjo ̈rgthere, the brothers send Fri13jo ́fr on a mission to collect taxes in the Ork-neys. Meanwhile, I ́ngibjo ̈rg is married off to the aging King Hrı ́ngr, and thebrothers raze Fri13jo ́fr’s home. Returned to Norway, Fri13jo ́fr is outlawedby the brothers and takes up a Viking’s life, nobly slaying only evil men andVikings and leaving farmers and merchants alone. Eventually he ends up atthe court of King Hrı ́ngr, whom he serves faithfully, so much so that whenthe old ruler is about to pass away, he declares Fri13jo ́fr king and gives himIngibjo ̈rg in marriage.Those are the barest outlines of the narrative, and magic, paganism, andwitchcraft clearly play a role but strike the modern reader as often beingmore ornamental than these same factors are, for example, in8orsteins sagaVı ́kingssonar. There are, however, two central areas where the author usesthese important themes in the saga, namely, the pagan site of worship referredto as Baldr’s Pasture and the use of witchcraft in an attempt to undo Fri13jo ́fron his errand to the Orkneys. In the case of the pagan temple at (or called)Baldr’s Pasture, we get interesting, and rare, reconnaissance: at one pointFri13jo ́fr enters the ‘‘hall of dı ́sir,’’ where the kings are said to be attendingto the ‘‘dı ́sir ritual.’’95Perhaps even more unusual than the saga’s presentationof this house of worship are the references to the activities there: the woodenidols of the gods are being warmed and oiled and wiped down by the kings’wives, a practice that also occasions the burning of the hall when Fri13jo ́frattempts with disastrous results to wrest from one of the women the ring hehad earlier given to I ́ngibjo ̈rg.96Thus it transpires that the idol of Baldr thatshe is warming and that had recently been anointed falls in the fire and inturn catches the building on fire."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic91Earlier the brothers have deposited I ́ngibjo ̈rg and eight other women inBaldr’s Pasture while they are away at war, thinking that not even Fri13jo ́frwould be so brash as to visit her there, implying a prohibition of a sexualsort, an interdiction that is indeed in evidence in other manuscript tradi-tions.97And within the text, Bjo ̈rn, I ́ngibjo ̈rg, and others, despite their ownwillingness to violate this prohibition, treat the issue with seriousness. Clearlythe author wants his audience to envision an ancient tradition of sanctity andsexual prohibitions, such as the Vestal virgins,sacerdos Vestalis,of Romanmythology, although whether this is a reflection of actual pagan practice inthe north or merely a way to present pre-Christian Scandinavia as curiousand heathen is impossible to know.As a punishment for violating the sanctity of Baldr’s Pasture, as well asan all too obvious way to get rid of him, Fri13jo ́fr is sent by the brothers tocollect overdue taxes from the Orkney Islands. To ensure that he not return,the saga says that they hire two witches (sei5konur) to send a storm againstFri13jo ́fr and his men and that ‘‘they performed their witchcraft, andmounted the scaffold with incantations and sorcery.’’98Running into the galethus produced, Fri13jo ́fr refers in a verse to ‘‘old charms’’ (galdrar gamlir)being the cause of it. As the seas and the weather grow worse and worse,Fri13jo ́fr climbs the ship’s mast and comes back with important news, ‘‘avery wondrous sight’’ (mjo ̈k undarliga sy ́n): a great whale circles the ship,which Fri13jo ́fr understands to be the cause for their dilemma and knowstoo that King Helgi is responsible for it. Moreover, on the back of the whale,he has seen two women and declares that they have caused the storm withtheir terrible witchcraft and incantations, and he plans to see which is greater,‘‘our luck or their sorcery.’’99Fri13jo ́fr manages to dispatch one of the shape-shifters (annari hamhleypunni), while his magical ship, Elli1i, takes care ofthe other. At the same time, back in Norway, ‘‘while the sisters were at theirsorcery, they tumbled down from the high sorcery-scaffold and broke boththeir backs.’’100As this outline makes clear, these sagas treating three generations of afamily from Sogn, all set at some point anterior to the settlement of Iceland,bristle with magic. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine the currentFri57jo ́fssaga fræknaor, especially,8orsteins saga Vı ́kingssonarwithout their plots’heavy reliance on magic and those who use it. They are also texts reliant onnotions about magical practice popular in courtly literature (e.g., Vı ́kingrlaying his head in the lap of Dı ́s and the magical drinking horn, capable ofboth giving and curing leprosy). It is not difficult to envision how these texts"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92chapter 3look to present their heroes in the context of what Lars Lo ̈nnroth famouslytermed ‘‘the noble heathen,’’ that is, good and moral pre-Christian pala-dins.101But as we have seen, these heroic figures are anything but cut fromthe same template, although that charge has typically been one of the com-plaints about them.102In those sagas treating the ancient pagan period, magic, witchcraft, andsorcery are critically important concepts, in that their association with pagan-ism is employed by saga writers as the key defining characteristic of thatrough-hewn heathen world, not merely a widely practiced pre-Christian formof religion, but rather a way of presenting and referring to an entirely differ-ent manner of thinking. From the perspective of the thirteenth-century sagaauthors, the heathen world is one devoid of a benevolent creator to whomprayer may be addressed and is instead a world consisting entirely of soullessmechanistic appeals to demons. Turning from the texts set in the remoteworld of ancient Scandinavia to the sagas set in the intermediate period, thesagas of the past (fortidssagaer), that is, from the time since the settlement ofIceland to just before the contemporary period, we see a different role formagic and witchcraft in the hands of Icelandic authors. These phenomenarepresent a form of pagan resistance to the inevitability of Christianity, intro-duced within the time frame of thefortidssagaer. Witchcraft and all of itsassociations are no longer a kind of backdrop on which to paint the action,but have often become a focused means for shaping the nature of the hero,where the ‘‘noble heathen’’ becomes an ever more pronounced theme and aplot device of the first water.103The treatment of magic and witches in the life of the tenth-centurymissionary king of Norway, O ́la ́fr Tryggvason, as presented in Snorri Sturlu-son’sHeimskringla, provides an excellent example of this point.104As the rulerwho oversees the introduction of the new religion to Norway and Iceland, itis unsurprising that his opposition to paganism is one way in which hischaracter is displayed. And as discussed previously, in this saga we do encoun-ter serious and positive uses of one sort of magic, the magic that derives fromGod and has a Christian purpose.Thus, while still a pagan Viking, O ́la ́fr, hears of a prophet (spa ́ma5r)inthe Scilly Islands, and after testing his wisdom, O ́la ́fr visits the hermit, whooffers him a ‘‘holy prophecy’’ (helgum spa ́do ́mi), namely, that through him,many men will be brought to the true faith and be baptized.105In fact, thisvery question of what the prophet’s source of power might be is exactly thequery O ́la ́fr puts to the holy hermit, who says that it is the god of Christian"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic93men who reveals these thing to him.106After hearing about God’s miracles,O ́la ́fr converts and spends time with the prophet learning about his new faithand leaves the islands with both priests and other learned men.Here the text presents both the superiority of Christian magic and ofO ́la ́fr’s character, especially so, as this episode contrasts so vividly with theearlier episode in the saga of the conversion of King Haraldr of Denmark. Inthis case, although Haraldr’s conversion is said, essentially en passant, tocome about through the miracle of Poppo’s bearing glowing iron, the sagaalso makes it clear that Haraldr’s decision is primarily brought about byEmperor O ́tta’s military successes. Even greater is the contrast between O ́la ́frand Earl Ha ́kon of Norway, who is forced by Haraldr to accept conversion.But he then becomes an apostate, setting ashore the missionaries meant tohelp convert Norway and subsequently offers a great sacrifice to O ́1inn.107Tergiversation of this sort must have been a very real problem for notonly the early missionaries but also for those of later centuries who could seethat magic of a type that relied not on the power of the Christian God buton invoking the old pagan gods that continued to hold a prominent placeamong nominal Nordic Christians. In contrast to the sort of behavior EarlHa ́kon displays, O ́la ́fr is shown to be not merely an ardent follower of Christbut also a passionate opponent of all who resist the new faith. And thoseopponents, at least in Snorri’s treatment of the O ́la ́fr traditions, are fre-quently presented as witches, sorcerers, and other wielders of pagan magic.Corresponding in character, if not in scale, to those villains are sagascenes set in Iceland, where virtuous heroes like Gı ́sli Su ́rsson are bedeviledthroughout their careers by infamously wicked figures such as4orgrı ́mr nef,a man ‘‘full of sorcery and witchcraft, and he was as much a wizard as couldbe.’’108Occasionally one encounters an entire nest of witches, as in the Hebri-dean family of Kotkell inLaxdœla saga.They raise a great storm against thosewho attempt to stop their thieving and witchery, drowning all their enemies:the father, mother, and two sons are all said to be great sorcerers.109Similarcharacters are to be found in many sagas, such as4o ́rdı ́sinKorma ́ks saga(TheSaga of Korma ́kr) and Geirrı ́1rinEyrbyggja saga(The Saga of the People ofEyri), some of the most memorable secondary figures we encounter in theIcelandic sagas. The case for the ‘‘noble heathen’’ in the sagas, who antici-pates the goodness of coming Christianity, is made possible exactly becausethere are those who arenotnoble.110And such ignoble foils are as often asnot drawn by saga authors by making them witches and sorcerers.The old crone whose charm magic undoes Grettir A ́smundarson is surely"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94chapter 3one of the most memorable witch figures in saga literature.Grettis saga A ́s-mundarsonar(Saga of Grettir A ́smundarson) offers a fascinating glimpse, notonly of a fourteenth-century Icelander’s view of magic and witchcraft, butalso of the later period’s perception of the Conversion era and the possibilityof paganism being reignited.111Incapable of being defeated by normal means,Grettir has survived internal exile on Iceland for years, and in desperation,his enemies look for magical assistance from4urı ́1r. When the old crone isintroduced, she is described as very old and useless; moreover, it said thatwhen she was young and men were heathens, she had been bothfjo\u0001lkunnigandmargkunnig(both terms relating to the manifold knowledge associatedwith the witchcraft), but it was generally thought she had now forgotten itall. The author further notes that although the country was by then Christian(i.e., in the early eleventh-century setting of the story), there remained never-theless many heathen sparks (margir gneistar hei5ninnar), and although it waspunishable with the so-called minor outlawry to publicly worship in the oldway, doing so in secret was still possible.112Having been introduced in this interesting fashion,4urı ́1r subsequentlydisplays cunning, temper, and power as she uses her magical skill to accom-plish what Grettir’s male adversaries have thus far been unable to do, namely,to defeat him. Despite her great age, the fact that she can hardly get out ofbed, and so on,4urı ́1r’s witchery proves potent indeed.113One scene makesthis story especially interesting: in order to effect her magic,4urı ́1r goes tothe seashore where she carves runes into a beached log, rubs her blood intothem, recites a charm, and then walks withershins around the object.114Here,I think, is a description of charm magic in performance that has the ring oftruth about it, a description that maps well onto a charm scenario O ́1innaddresses in theLjo ́5atal.115In Chapter2, a number of accounts of magical performances were re-viewed. So, for example, we saw how Egill Skalla-Grı ́msson’s ability to usemagic is exploited to give insights into his character, most famously in hisraising the ‘‘curse-pole.’’ In the same saga, Egill even corrects poorly executedrunic magic, noting that no one should attempt to write runes who does notfully understand their use.116Perhaps the single most celebrated descriptionof magic being enacted in Nordic sources is the section ofEirı ́ks saga rau5a(Saga of Eirı ́kr the Red), which describes in detail the performance ofsei5r.The saga, composed in the thirteenth century and preserved in fourteenth-century manuscripts, purports to tell of events from around the millenniumin the fledgling Greenlandic colony at the settlement on Herjo ́lfsness:117"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic95At that time there was a great famine in Greenland.

The sheer amount of detail provided in the saga has struck some assuspicious, immoderate larding of particulars, meant to mask the fact thatthe scene is indeed invented, in order to demonstrate the sanctity of Gu1rı ́1r,who, after all, is the ancestor of two bishops.120Stro ̈mba ̈ck, for example, isquite doubtful about the authenticity of the so-calledvar5lokkuror, in anyevent, of the saga writers’ understanding of this point, while others argue forthe possible correctness of this part of the episode.121Yet others have examined the scene and concluded that, although notevery component of it need be correct, the overall impression it provides ofwitchcraft, that is, ofsei5r, being performed is likely to be right, or so Iinfer.122Price expands our sense of the scene by suggesting that we regard itas a kind of ‘‘ritual reassurance,’’ to the extent that the broader intention ofthe piece may be one where thevo\u0001lvais believed to have ‘‘agenuineability tosee the future . . .’’ but is expected to adjust her vision to fit the needs of heraudience.123This functional argument is a helpful way to view the scene andperhaps one with resonances heard as loudly in the thirteenth century as inthe tenth. And the scene is one of the most dramatic confrontations wewitness in the sagas between pagan magic and Christianity, notwithstandingsuch famous episodes as those involving red hot iron being borne, slowlydrowningsei5menn, and other more violent clashes. Here the saga writer givesthe specter of a Christian woman who quite simply as a matter of consciencedoes not want to participate in a ritual she rightfully associates with the oldreligion.Finally, the so-called contemporary sagas (samtidssagaer), dealing as theymostly do with events from the thirteenth century (and the very late twelfthcentury) when they were composed, might be expected to reflect medieval"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98chapter 3man’s perceived preoccupation with diabolical agents and their uses of magi-cal power to work ill.124Yet the contemporary sagas tend to show connectionswith the magical worldview in only two regards: a deep-seated concern withseeing the future, often presented in the form of dreams and other premoni-tions, and with imprecations, in both a general and, I argue, more narrow,specific sense.But what we do not see in these texts dealing with contemporary andnear-contemporary events is any sort of decisive intrusion by sorcerers,witches, or magical practices to set the course of the narrative or turn the tideof events. How unlike the sagas treating earlier periods! No4urı ́1r helpingdispatch Grettir; no magical acts by Egill exiling the king and queen andsetting the stage for future actions; no Busla offering to teach the black arts;no magic potions of forgetfulness such as that administered to Sigur1rbyGrı ́mhildr; and so on. The world projected by thesamtı ́5arso\u0001guris largelyone of power politics, human cruelty, and human frailty, but interestingly,indeed even suspiciously, never one where witches or witchcraft play a sig-nificant role.That is not to suggest that there is no interest in the supernatural worldin these texts concerned with contemporary events, but rather that such inter-est very rarely takes the form of witchcraft. In fact, there is an explicit associa-tion with magic inSturlu saga(The Saga of Hvamm-Sturla), when a mancalled4orir ‘‘the witch’’ (8orir inn fjo\u0001lkunnugi, lit., knowledgeable in mani-fold arts) is captured by his adversaries. Subsequently, the question of hispossible release is raised. To that idea, Helgi the priest responds, saying that itwould never do to release a thief and someone thus empowered with magicalknowledge (at la ́ta lausan7jo ́f ok fjo ̈lkunnugan mann).125And that brief ex-change, for all of its approximately one quarter of a million words,126is justabout allSturlunga sagahas to say on the subject of witchcraft per se.127Sturlunga saga’s evident fascination with premonitions and the predic-tion of things to come has been the subject of much discussion. ItsHrafnssaga Sveinbjarnarsonar(The Saga of Hrafn Sveinbjarnarson),128for example,opens with a section in which there are many prophecies with the remark,‘‘In the West Fjords there were then many kinds of dreams and visions.’’129Three prophetic events follow, two of them visions that hint at Christian-ized references to O ́1inn. In the first dream, a man named4o ́r1risvisitedby a grim, black figure (svartr ok illiligr). He says inljo ́5ahattrverse that heis of an ancient lineage, a constant traitor to peace, a bringer of death andan eater (or user?) of corpses.130In naming himself inSturlunga saga, this"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic99sinister figure calls himself Faraldr, ‘epidemic, plague, pestilence,’ presum-ably playing on his subsequent comments about bringing death.131Then aman named Gu1brandr is visited in a dream by a large and grim man (mikillok illiligr)wholikewisesaysinversethathetakespleasureinterror,andthat he is traveling south with a troop, apparently early testimony to thefusion of Christian views about the devil with pagan traditions.132Athirdman is subsequently visited in a dream, and he is told by a stranger that hesees the sinful souls of men, their spirits quivering at the serpent’s mouth,presumably a reference to medieval fondness for showing the gate to Hellas the mouth of a serpentine monster into which the souls of evildoers aremarched (Figure2).133Against a scholarly tradition that has not chosen to see this passage inthis way, I find the sinister, diabolical creatures who appear in the first twodreams—dark, large, and bloodthirsty—difficult to disassociate from Chris-tianity’s interpretation of O ́1inn, a cross between the old pre-Christian godand the satanic figure of medieval Catholicism.134Frequently referred to inthe noun phrase ‘‘the devil O ́1inn’’ (e.g.,dyeffuolen Oden), the figure is nei-ther wholly Christian nor wholly pagan by the close of the Middle Ages.135In one post-Reformation Swedish source, for example, O ́1inn has retainedmany of his heathen characteristics, but in a manner also consistent withhis increasing identification with the devil of Christianity, he is everywhereassociated with the color black: he visits humans accompanied by big blackdogs and servants on black horses, riding in a coach drawn by black horses,all with eyes that burned like fire.136Underscoring this interest in the one-eyed chief of the pre-Christian godsin theSturlunga sagacompilation is a curious passage inSturlu saga,inwhicha woman, displeased with a dispute in which her husband is engaged, runs upto the leading opponent, holding a knife, and says, ‘‘Why shouldn’t I treat youmostlikethefigureyouwanttobe—andthatisO ́1in?, and attempts to gougehis eye out.’’137Theeffectofthissortofinterpretatio Christiana,themeldingof a heathen god with the Christian idea of the devil, is one means by which,despite his continued function in certain contexts, the pre-Christian deity isfashioned throughout the Middle Ages to become the greatest of demons,mestrfja ́nda, as one rune-carving sorcerer calls him (see Chapter2).Among the variousSturlunga sagatexts, it isI ́slendinga sagathat demon-strates the greatest interest in prognostication.138That this will be the case isforeshadowed early on in the saga, when one brother challenges another byasking whether he thinks he is a seer (spa ́ma5r), to which the other brother"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100chapter 3responds that he is not.139This interest in prophecy is made manifest later inthe saga, just before the decisive battle at O\u0001rlygssta1ir (chaps.132–36), atwhich point the saga is filled with portents about impending disasters, mostlyin the form of dreams. Typically, men and women appear in these dreamsand speak in verse to the dreamer, the style of these lists of future eventsoften echoing the catalogue-like effect of miracle collections (jarteinabækur).Indeed, one senses that the author is even aware of this characteristic andconditions the reader for it. Earlier in the saga, one character, after hearingof his interlocutor’s quick recovery, says, ‘‘That must seem to you like amiracle,’’ to which the other responds, ‘‘I call such a thing an event, not amiracle.’’140In a stream of vaticinations, with one prophetic moment comingafter another, the overall impact is a little mind-numbing and seems likely tohave been built on the model of the miracle collections and hence is betterunderstood in terms of its emotional rather than aesthetic effect. Sturla him-self seems to sense the tendency toward overkill, concluding the discussionby writing, ‘‘Many other dreams, although they are not all written downhere, were recounted at this time; men thought them fraught with greattidings and portents.’’141By contrast with the great pile of prophetic events that make up thissection, a much more delicately balanced treatment of similarly portentousdreams comes near the end ofI ́slendinga sagain a dream sequence by a youngwoman named Jo ́rei1r. In these phantasms, she is visited by a series of figures,including no less a character than Gu1ru ́n Gju ́kado ́ttir from the Vo\u0001lsungcycle.142It is revealed then that ‘‘they intended with their wickedness to bringheathendom to the whole country.’’143Sturlunga saga also provides insights into the use of curses and impreca-tions. Occasionally, these utterances seem little more than expressions of frus-tration and outrage. Thus, when an irritated Loftr says, ‘‘The devil take theirjokes!’’ (Djo ̈fullinn hafi7eira hro ́p), the comment will strike modern readersas mild, perhaps ambiguous at worse.144But when we see him add to thatintroductory execration, ‘‘May they never thrive, and may things turn out sothat not everybody seeks their friendship!’’ we understand, as surely the audi-ence of the saga was meant to, that something else was, quite literally, atwork.145This statement is no longer simply an angry outburst but rather adesire to affect the future, if still far short of ritualized charm magic as such.Reports that touch on this desire to control or have an impact on futureevents in this way map heavily onto the dreams sections mentioned earlier.The verses the various phantasms deliver often come in the context of what"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic101Finnur Jo ́nsson refers to as a ‘‘dream- and warning verse’’ (dro ̈mme- og varsel-svers).146Although built on a different meter, its similarity to ‘‘magicalmeter,’’ orgaldralag, such as is Skı ́rnir’s curse of Ger1r discussed earlier(Chapter2), through the repetition of phrases or whole lines, generally withmild variation, is apparent.I ́slendinga sagareports of one of the portentsbefore the battle of O\u0001rlygssta1ir:There was a man named Snæbjo\u0001rn who lived in Sandvı ́k out fromHo\u0001f1ahverfi. He went out one night before Christmas, in the winterbefore the battle at O\u0001rlygssta1. Then a woman came into the home-field; she was big and strong, dreary and red of face. She wore a darkblue kirtle, and a linked belt; she spoke this verse, turning towardhim:Slayer of men will I here become.Savage the strife throughout the land.A plague I will be now for youAs vengeance for many impels me.Death and destruction will not miss our foesBut come ever closer to all who are fighting.The voice of the dead calls out loudly;The voice of the dead calls out loudly.And this she also recited:Raging I fare awayTo savaging battles.I wing over holt, over heathin the path of black ravens.I come to the vale where all is dark.The valley of death which awaits me.Sorrow-harmed I hurry aheadTo endure the torment of famine,The torment of famine my fate.147In this passage, we perhaps see a combination of various deadly femalefigures from Norse tradition, the valkyrie, the fetch, the Norn, the ogress,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102chapter 3and something much closer to the witch image, for here is a woman whosebehavior parallels what we might expect in a scene of performed magic.148First of all, this woman, ‘‘big and strong, dreary and red of face,’’ doesnot, like the other speakers in this prophetic sequence, appear in the contextof a dream but rather walked (gekk) into the more workaday world of thehome field, albeit at night, when the man has gone outside. On the otherhand, that the incident takes place in a home field (tu ́n, originally the hedgethat defined the field) is very suggestive: one Norse term for ‘‘witch’’ istu ́n-ri5a, that is, ‘hedge rider’.149I think the parallel here is more than accidental;moreover, the narrator describes the woman as wearing two specific items, adark blue dress (do\u0001kkbla ́um kyrtli) and a ‘linked belt’ (stokkabelti). Dark-huedclothing in the sagas almost always indicates impending violence, usuallydeath, and the curious detail of a particular sort of belt brings to mind thatthe meticulous description by the author ofEirı ́ks saga rau5aof the Green-landicvo\u0001lva‘sibyl, prophetess’, also referred to in the text asspa ́kona‘seeress,soothsayer’. And, indeed, two of the items enumerated in the saga’s descrip-tion of her are her dark-hued clothing and a special belt.150Nor is it insignificant that the author does not merely say that she spokethe verses but rather that ‘‘she spoke (kva5) this verse, turning (ok snerist, lit.,‘and turned herself ’) toward him.’’ ‘Spoke’ is the normal translation ofkve5a‘speak’ (cf. archaic English ‘quoth’) but the word also encompasses ‘recite’and ‘sing’ and is the term used, for example, when in the case of the scene inEirı ́ks saga rau5a, it is said that Gu1rı ́1r sang the so-called warlock song (kva5...kvæ5it).151More to the point, if one has entered a field and gone over toa man standing in it, what is the necessity of turning toward him? In fact,the text carefully specifies such movement with a clear sense that these actionsare done in a sequence.152The use ofsnu ́a‘turn’ here is very much in keepingwith other descriptions of a charm being delivered in the Old Norse world(see Chapter2). I believe we here see a curse being performed, one that mayhave included conducting the verbal portion while facing away from theobject of the curse, or more to the point, with the curser’s anus toward tothe object of the curse.153On the one hand, medieval Christian writers in Iceland generallythought, and wanted their audiences to think, that witchcraft and magic inearlier eras, or in far-off places, was rife. On the other hand, they did notmuch see such phenomena as having the same sort of major role in the courseof events in their own day. Writing in a parallel context, about the authentic-ity of the ‘blood-eagle’ rite, Roberta Frank noted some years ago, ‘‘Medieval"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic103men of letters, like their modern counterparts, could sometimes be over-eagerto recover the colourful rites and leafy folk beliefs of their pagan ancestors.’’154It may be a strong indication that something of this sort is also true of ourarea of inquiry when texts placed to the earliest periods are filled with magicalbehavior and yet so little of it appears in the sagas set in more contemporarytimes.As reasonable as this perspective may be, it can also be overemphasized,a view that assumes, of course, a lack of agency on the part of the saga writers,and might seem to suggest something of a haphazard and naı ̈ve relationshipto the material, that is, that they simply could not help themselves. I detecta more serious pattern and purpose to how magic and witchcraft were used.If, following Victor Turner, we focus on the genealogical or intergenerationaldimension of those texts that come as a sequence, we see the same dominantpattern.155Just as the three types of sagas enumerated by Sigur1ur Nordalbecome more filled with magic and witchcraft, the greater the distance be-tween the time of composition and the setting of the saga, so too withinsmaller groupings does the same pattern occur. Thus, if we plot the threegenerations of8orsteins saga Vı ́kingssonarandFri57jo ́fs saga frækna, discussedin detail earlier, that is, Vı ́kingr-4orsteinn-Fri13jo ́fr, it is apparent that, asone moves forward in time, although magic still plays a role, that role lessens.One might argue the same, I think, with respect to the multigenerationalsaga of the men of Hrafnista,Ketils saga hængs–Grı ́ms saga lo5inkinna–O\u0001rvar-Odds saga(The Saga of Ketill ‘Trout’–The Saga of Grı ́mr Hairy-Cheeks–Arrow-Odd’s Saga). Or even, albeit to a much lesser degree, withinSturlunga saga,for example,Geirmundar7a ́ttr heljarskinns-8orgils saga ok Hafli5a-Sturlu saga(The Tale of Geirmundar Hell-skin–The Saga of8orgils and Hafli5i–The Sagaof Sturla).In other words, in all of these instances, I believe we see a learned class,wittingly or not, ascribing magic, sorcery, and witchcraft primarily to earlierperiods, using it to represent from their point of view the very essence ofwhat that world was like before the introduction of Christianity.156That is,although they acknowledge the reality of miracles, which we might, from amodern theologically neutral vantage point, regard as just one more form ofmagic, medieval saga writers intuitively understood pagan works of wonderto be a very different sort of phenomenon. That they saw and used thisdifference is not to say that there existed a rigid programmatic approachaccording to which every saga was composed, but that there was a tenden-tious approach to the idea of witchcraft that led to many, even most, of the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"104chapter 3saga authors to be willing to see pagan magic and witchcraft at every turn inthe ancient pre-Christian world but much more modestly present in theirown time. By no means do I want to suggest that we discard the evidence tobe had from the sagas, but it is obvious that their testimony must be sippedcautiously. Can the Icelandic sagas inform us about the nature of witchcraftin the Nordic Middle Ages? Most definitely, but sometimes, as in the case oftheI ́slendinga sagaverses, they may tell us most exactly when they do notknow they are doing it. And when they are aware that they are informingtheir audiences about the magical practices of bygone eras, it would be wiseto have our critical senses sharpened as much as possible, for surely we seetheir intentions on display at least as much as their knowledge.Ecclesiastical and Court LiteratureIn discussions of medieval Scandinavian literature, Old Icelandic spiritualculture understandably tends to overshadow the traditions of the other Nor-dic regions. This situation is easy to fathom but should not mask the factthat Icelandic sagas and poetry are not the only important narrative materialswe have.157Moreover, by breaking out Icelandic as a separate entity for thepurpose of these discussions, I do not mean to imply that Icelandic writerswould not have been aware of or participated in the same waves of innovationthat gave rise to the narratives taken up here, and, as we will see, there areareas of overlap. Broadly speaking, in the following I take up the materialsby types—historical writing, legendaries, sermons, moralizing texts, and soon—and incorporate where possible a chronological scheme.After discussing the Icelandic materials of medieval Scandinavia, what-ever oxygen is left in the room is generally consumed rapidly by the toweringimage of Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish cleric who wrote of the ‘‘deeds’’ orhistory of the Danes (Gesta Danorum) in sixteen imposing books.158Begunaround1190and not completed until sometime after1208, Saxo’s remarkablesynoptic history of the Danes incorporates much of ‘‘the same’’ mythologicalmaterial as that known to Snorri and other Icelandic writers, albeit with hisown attempts to work it all into an acceptable framework, and with somevery different perspectives and understandings from those in the Icelandicsources.159Fundamentally, however, he shares with other Christian writersthe need to explain why it is appropriate to discuss pagan topics, as well asthe tendency to resort to euhemerism for his explanation."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic105In order to show that he is not making up his history—so Saxo reassureshis audience early on—he reveals that there were three types of sorcerers whopracticed magic (1.5.2):160the first, giants; the second, sorcerers; and the third,a hybrid of the first two.161The first group was characterized by its size andstrength, the second by its skill in divination and the practice of magic, whichapparently allowed them to subdue the giants in their constant warring. Al-though neither as powerful in body nor as crafty in their arts as the parentgroups, the third type was misunderstood by people to be gods and wor-shipped as a false religion, a topic to which he returns repeatedly.The vision of, and attention to, sorcery presented in Saxo’sGesta Da-norumis comprehensive and includes most of the forms of magic we cantease out of the various other Nordic sources. So, for example, Saxo describesnecromancy being practiced by Harthgrepa (1.6.4); Ollerus engaging in magi-cal transvection (3.4.12); anı ́5sto\u0001ngbeing raised (5.3.7); Othinus (i.e., O ́1inn)working charm magic (3.4.4); and a witch transmogrifying into a horse andthen turning herself and her family into marine mammals (5.16.2). And hedescribes a Swedish champion whose seven sons exhibit what are clearlyber-serkrbehaviors, such as biting their shields and so on, but are also associatedby Saxo with sorcery (7.2.7). In fact, magic and those who practice it aregenerally associated with most of the ills of mankind inGesta Danorum.Magic is especially connected with the earliest period of history, whenpeople were duped by magic into falsely worshipping humans whom theybelieved to be gods, most of all Othinus (i.e., O ́1inn). To a lesser extent wealso hear of Thor (i.e.,4o ́rr), but as one scholar notes, these two deities aside,there is little attention to the other pre-Christian gods in Saxo’s work.162Very often, however, mentioning Othinus and the old gods generically comesexactly in this context of Saxo’s maintaining that it was magic that allowedthem to be understood as deities. So, for example, he writes, ‘‘At one timecertain individuals, initiated into the magical arts, namely Thor, Odin and anumber of others who were skilled at conjuring up marvellous illusions,clouded the minds of simple men and began to appropriate the exalted rankof godhead. Norway, Sweden and Denmark were ensnared in a groundlessconviction, urged to a devoted worship of these frauds and infected by theirgross imposture.’’163It has been argued thatGesta Danorumis constructed according to apattern in which the first four books cover the pagan era; the second four,the non-Danish Christian era; the third four, the conversion of the Danes;and the last four, the era of the Danish archbishops.164Magic is a recurrent"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106chapter 3topic in the history, especially the earliest parts of it, because Saxo, like theIcelandic saga writers, uses magic most often in connection with the lostbygone world of paganism. It is for Saxo one means for a Christian Scandina-vian to explain how the worship of false gods came about.165And, like theIcelandic writers, he sees far less of it in the era after Conversion.There is another pattern at work here too, and that is Saxo’s treatmentof women in his history. This question is not unconnected to the issue ofmagic in that it has been suggested that women are presented as significantactors in the heathen part of his history, but thereafter, with the Conversion,become less important.166The heathen women’s connection to power, onescholar has argued, comes from their use of magic, where ‘‘we meet compara-tively more women than men,’’ as she writes, adding that magic begins tofade after the ninth book.167Saxo’sGesta Danorumis unique in medieval Nordic literature, an ex-traordinary work that lacks, as has been said, both prototype and imitation,but it is far from the only history written in that period.168Indeed, in manyways, history writing accounts for much of medieval Scandinavian literaryactivity, including the sagas, as has been pointed out many times. Magic,witchcraft, and sorcery as a means of identifying or characterizing in such acontext that which was understood to be foreign, distant, or ‘‘other’’ appearsto be a common theme in all of them. We have seen how this tendencyfrequently attaches itself to the pagan past as one vehicle by which Christianwriters could offer an explanation for the heathenism of their ancestors: thatis, as the sleight-of-hand trickery, the magic, of the individuals later euhemer-ized and believed to be deities, those who fooled the populace into worship-ping them. But it was also a convenient tag for otherness, for the practices ofcultures that were alien.This tendency may nowhere be more pronounced than in the treatmentof the so-called Finns, or Sa ́mi.169The author of the mid-twelfth-centuryHistoria Norwegie(History of Norway), for example, comments extensively onthe perceived magical practices of the Sa ́mi,170saying, ‘‘A person will scarcelybelieve their unendurable impiety and the extent to which they practice hea-then devilry in their magical arts. There are some who are worshipped by theignorant masses as though they were prophets. . . .’’171Then follows a passageeverything about which suggests that it partially describes a shamanic se ́ance:in it, the hostess suddenly falls forward, being perceived as dead by the Chris-tian traders, but the Finns tell them that she is not dead, ‘‘merely pillaged bythe gands of her adversaries.’’172A magician then prepares himself with spells"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic107and other items and, after considerable chanting and leaping, throws himselfon the ground where he expires. Consulting with another magician, whogoes through similar preparations, the hostess subsequently arises in goodhealth and ‘‘he’’ (referring to the third sorcerer) tells them that the secondmagician’s ‘‘gand’’ had been harmed while in the shape of a whale and thatthat harm manifested itself in the real magician’s death.173When in theVetus Chronica Sialandie(Older Sealandic Chronicle), itsDanish author focuses on the supposed widespread nature of magic in Nor-way, it is surely exactly because of the large Sa ́mi population there. That is,the chronicler’s comments are more likely born of racial and cultural factorsthan those connected with political or national rivalries when he notes howmany magicians live in Norway, listing among such monsters, as he callsthem, diviners, augurers, mages, enchanters, ‘‘and other followers of the Anti-christ,’’ which he further explicitly connects with demons.174Here, of course,is something new, as this kind of magical practice is no longer typified assimply odd, frightening, or bizarre—although it may still be all of these—butnow being associated in explicitly religious terms with the enemies of thechurch.175An area where there is very little interest in this question is Old Swedishhistorical writing. Sensitivity to the question of lingering paganism no doubtcolors the way historical mythmaking in Sweden treats the Conversion, espe-cially when set against its strong tradition of historical rhymed chronicles.Medieval West Norse sources were fond of presenting the Swedes as pagansand reluctant, even backsliding, Christians; well-known examples includeHervarar saga’s epilogue concerning the deposing of the Christian King Ingi,who refuses to perform the traditional pagan sacrifices, in favor of hisbrother-in-law, ‘Sacrifice-Sveinn’ (Blo ́t-Sveinn), who commits himself tosuch rituals. And Snorri’sMagnu ́ssona saga(Saga of the Sons of Magnu ́s) pres-ents the crusade of the Norwegian king, Sigur1r the Crusader, together withthe Danish king, Nı ́kola ́s, against the heathen Sma ̊la ̈nningar and otherSwedes, who are said to be still mostly heathens or only superficially Chris-tian.176The foundational narrative about Sweden’s Christianization process is,as we saw earlier, the life of Saint Ansgar by Rimbert.Vita Ankarii(The Lifeof Saint Ansgar) details the steady if slow growth of the church in Swedenand frequently uses the dramatic confrontation between pagan and Christianmagic as a means of illustrating the story. Importantly, Rimbert’sVita Anka-riiwas translated into the vernacular by one of Ansgar’s great admirers, Nils"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108chapter 3Hermansson (1325–91), bishop of Linko ̈ping, at the end of the fourteenthcentury, providing the narrative with a broader audience.Otherwise, however, original vernacular literature in medieval Sweden,most notably the quintessentially historical genre of the ‘‘rhymed chronicle’’(rimkro ̈nika), simply does not take up the country’s shift in faith—the sig-nificance of this fact is more obvious if one compares this reluctance to treatthe subject to the valorization of the same event as found elsewhere in medie-val Nordic literature, such asKristni sagaandBrennu-Nja ́ls saga(Njal’s Saga).In fact, one of the earliest medieval Swedish-language texts to treat this themeis the so-calledVidhemspra ̈stens anteckningar(The Vidhem Priest’s Commen-tary) from about1325.177An appendix to the provincial laws of Va ̈stergo ̈tland,the text is an early example of both the kings’ and bishops’ list. Given itsplacement at the end of the West Gautish laws, these notes tend to privilegethe primacy of that region as often as possible.178This commentary tells of how the first Christian king of the Swedes andGoths was baptized in the spring at Husaby in Va ̈stergo ̈tland by the Englishbishop Sigfrid.179Here the Vidhem priest is following established local tradi-tion, as codified in theLegend of Saint Sigfrid(ca.1200), but there are alterna-tive versions (e.g., Saxo10.11.6).180One of the arguments being made by thispresentation of historical ‘‘facts’’ inVidhemspra ̈stens anteckningarwould seemto be the relatively steady, unbroken rule of Christianity in Sweden, traceableback to the baptism of Olof Sko ̈tkonung in that spring in Va ̈stergo ̈tland.181Notably there is, contra Icelandic tradition, no mention of a pagan insurrec-tion or a ‘‘Sacrifice-Sveinn.’’ Instead,Vidhemspra ̈stens anteckningardiscussesbriefly the martyrdom of the second bishop, Unni, deleting Sveinn entirelyfrom the list of Sweden’s monarchs.182Despite the relative scarcity of surviving conversion scenes in Old Swed-ish, it is hardly the case that the Swedes did not recognize that their ancestorshad been pagans, and we do occasionally see the same tendency toward view-ing the pre-Christian gods as the (often-euhemerized) figures falsely wor-shipped by pagan Swedes. So, for example,Fornsvenska legendarietreportsabout the missionary activities of Saint Philip: ‘‘Philipus preached for twentyyears i ‘sithia’ which is now called Sweden, from the eastern lands to O ̈re-sund. The heathens captured him at last and took him to the temple inUppsala and coerced him into making sacrifices to Mars, whom the Swedescall O ́1inn.’’183In a miracle vaguely reminiscent of the deeds of great Theseus-like char-acters of the Bo\u00011varr-Bjarki sort in the sagas, Philip vanquishes a dragon and"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic109saves the people from a plague, resulting in the country’s becoming Chris-tian.184This narrative, part of the great cycle of Old Swedish legendary mate-rials from circa1300, is preserved in a manuscript from a half century or solater, Codex Bureanus.185In fact, it is useful to discussFornsvenska legendarietin the context ofhistory writing, as with its organizational scheme and many references topopes, emperors, early martyrs, and Nordic saints and the work of the churchtoward the Christianization of Scandinavia, it represents an ecclesiasticalworld history, integrating Scandinavia into the chronology of the church.186In it, a kind of magic is often presented that is different from the sort ofpaganism and pre-Christian worship of false gods discussed thus far, theoccasional references to native themes in the local saints’ stories, as in thecase of Saint Philip, notwithstanding. Overwhelmingly, however, the imagesof magic that emerge from the collection are of two types. One is the storyof the learned magus in direct confrontation with the saint, so in that sensethis image is rather like the Nordic conversion contests discussed earlier inwhich magic functions as a shared form of communication between the ri-vals. The other scenario typically involves a foolish figure who makes a rashand subsequently regretted promise, often to the devil, and who is subse-quently saved through the intervention of a saint. In the first case, conversionscenes commonly employ miracles and other wonders, of course, and oftenenough as the representatives of the two camps—the Christian and the un-converted—contest the power of their respective faiths. We have seen how,in the treatments of missionary activities in Viking Age Scandinavia, thesescenes always involve the old pagan gods and their followers. InFornsvenskalegendariet, however, the representatives of this perspective tend to be learnedmagicians and Jews.So, for example, against the proselytizing miracle of the gift of tongues,two magicians (koklara), Zoroes and Arafaxat, come with murderous, fire-breathing dragons.187But when Matthew slays them and is subsequently ableby calling on Christ’s name to do what the magicians cannot—bring to lifethe king’s recently deceased son—the king thankfully falls at the missionary’sfeet. A similar scene plays out with Zambri, a Jewishmæstari‘master’, ‘learnedman’, ‘teacher’, perhaps here meant as ‘rabbi’, representing the opposition toconversion. He and Pope Sylvester compete to see who can bring a bull backto life. Sylvester wins by calling on the name of Jesus Christ, whereas Zambrifails when he intones into the bull’s ear what Sylvester characterizes as thename of the worst devil.188In an extended confrontation between Saint Jacob"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110chapter 3and the Jewish mage, Hermogenes, the power of Christian and non-Christianmagic are again set side by side. Hermogenes conjures his devils and com-mands them to bind the saint, but the curse is reversed, and instead it is themagician who is fettered. When he converts, the magician says that he knowsthe temperament of the devils and asks for protection, which Jacob gives himin the form of his staff. Hermogenes brings to him all of his grimoires withthe intention that they be burned, but Jacob, fearing the smoke would doharm, says that should be buried instead.189These few examples illustratewhat transpires in a number of the narratives inFornsvenska legendariet,inwhich the two sides, one Christian, one not, contend for moral, spiritual,and importantly, physical supremacy (e.g., raising the dead) by using oppos-ing magics.The other scenario involves the so-called diabolical pact, orpactum cumdiabolo, a belief of enormous importance for the shaping of European witch-craft mythology (see Chapter4). A concept whose consolidated form is mostclosely associated with the later Middle Ages and Reformation eras, the rootsof this idea are to be seen in church documents from very early on. And it isof no small consequence that we find them in Scandinavia already by circa1300. Thus the life of Saint Basil inFornsvenska legendariettells of how as aresult of his lust for a woman a young man dedicates himself to the devil (hangaff sik diæflenom). The devil, feeling that Christians are an untrustworthy lot,demands that he renounce God and commit himself to the devil in writing.But the saint saves him in the end, of course.190Similarly, in the legend ofSaint Cyprian and Saint Justina, lust and magic again play a heavy role, asdoes the devil’s demand that Cyprian swear him an oath.191A story set inmore contemporary surroundings is told of a knight who in order to becomerich promises himself and his wife to the devil. It is only through the inter-vention of the Virgin Mary that his wife is saved.192And, of course, the mostfamous of these tales, the story of Theophilus, lays out the idea of the writtendiabolical pact and of how Mary’s intervention saves him.193Religious literature of this kind was prevalent in all the Nordic traditionareas, of course, and it is hardly surprising that ecclesiastical texts are amongthe oldest surviving Norse texts.194Intended to inspire faith in their audiencesand to confirm its truth, such texts were, together with such contacts as camethrough the education of clerics at schools on the Continent, pilgrimages,royal marriage arrangements, and trade, including the increasingly large for-eign populations in Hanseatic communities, significant channels for import-ing continental ideas northward.195Just who would have access to the kind"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic111of writing represented inFornsvenska legendarietand other vernacular reli-gious texts, and how it would have been communicated to them, is an intri-guing question. In the case ofFornsvenska legendariet, in particular, thequestion of whether it might have been intended for a female religious com-munity has been suggested, where, one assumes, it would have been readaloud. But how did the views of the church reach broader, less privilegedaudiences?196Certainly one means by which the church’s views were broadcast wasthrough the quintessential narrative art, preaching, a phenomenon that in-creased markedly beginning in the thirteenth century with the rise of themendicant orders and their dedication to the art, a process likely to havebeen the most important channel for exchange between the church and largenumbers of nonelites, especially in urban areas.197On the other hand, as oneexpert in the field has remarked, we have no idea of how frequently sermonswere preached, only that surviving documents by bishops and other authori-ties often urge that it be done frequently.198What sorts of topics are covered in the surviving homiletic literaturefrom Scandinavia?199Certainly the topics taken up with vigor, regardless ofwhether the sermons are from the thirteenth, fourteenth, or fifteenth centu-ries, include magic and witchcraft. ‘‘Sermo ad populum,’’ inThe Old Norwe-gian Homily Bookfrom the early1200s, for example, lists as the principal sins,church theft, manslaughter, rancor, envy, and a variety of other antisocialactivities, including ‘‘belief in ‘women’s pharmacopoeia’ or witchcraft orprophecy,’’ referring to them as ‘‘diabolical.’’200Similarly, ‘‘Sermo necessaria’’from the same collection lists among those sins to avoid, pride, slander, andmurder, various types of witchcraft, and magic.201Among the sermons in the early fourteenth-centuryHauksbo ́k(Haukr’sBook), a sort of ‘‘gentleman’s library’’ belonging to an Icelandic lawman,Haukr Erlendsson (d.1334), who spent much of his career in Norway, one isof special interest here.202Derived from an Anglo-Saxon original, the text hasbeen judged to be as much an adaptation as a translation, with some of thelonger theological discussions abbreviated and with a more emphatic treat-ment of the question of witchcraft.203It condemns, for example, women whoprepare what is clearly sexual magic for their men in the form of a potion toensure that they should as a result love them well. And the text is very specificin its warnings against such diabolical activities as those that constitute witch-craft, speaking ‘‘of witches and sorcerers, those who traffic in magic or in"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112chapter 3‘pharmacopoeia’ or in prophecy, for that is a fiendish heresy [fianda villa]and Satanic service [diofuls7ionasta].’’204Fifteenth-century sermons sometimes recycle the same concerns, eventhe same language, of earlier texts, such as the idea that the sin of witchcraftis its struggle against obedience205or that witchcraft is among the principalsins to be on guard against, specifically, ‘‘belief in witchcraft and ‘pharmaco-poeia’ and sorcery and other heresies. . . .’’206Another sermon sets more orless the same phrase into a more dogmatic context: ‘‘Your wickedness willbring you reproach and your turning away from God and the proper faith towitchcraft and ‘pharmacopoeia’ and sorcery and other diabolical arts shallbring you reproach.’’207Yet lingering still in the sermons of the late MiddleAges, however, are views one is tempted to associate with paganism. Thus asermon for the second Sunday in Lent tells the story of a woman whosedaughter is possessed by the devil. The key here is that the mother prays tothe Lord for help and does not turn to magic for relief; specifically, ‘‘neithertorwnakarlanor male witches.’’208Rwnakarl(orrunokarl, as one might ex-pect) literally, if inelegantly, means a ‘rune man’, that is, a ‘male charmworker who uses runes’, and suggests a reference to the sort of activities notedin Chapter2.This growing concern in the fifteenth century about witchcraft is men-tioned more and more frequently in the sermons.209Another change is in theworks as well, for no longer do the sermons merely chide listeners abouttheir own moral and spiritual obligations; instead the concerns become moredefensive, especially where the miracle-working goods of the church itself areconcerned. Thus the fire-brand preacher of mid-fifteenth-century Ribe, PederMadsen, preaching in Latin to a different sort of audience, needing a differenttype of admonition, warns against the possibility that water from baptismalfonts might be used for witchcraft and that the consecrated host might like-wise be put to similar use.210An unusually multilayered perspective on magic and witchcraft comes tous from the fourteenth century in the various works associated with SaintBirgitta, especially her ‘‘Revelations.’’211At once very personal but also highlypublic and deeply influential in the Nordic countries and elsewhere in Eu-rope, Birgitta’s visions comment on these themes several times. Given thatshe lived the last decades of her life in Rome (except for brief pilgrimages), itis sometimes difficult to know whether the conditions reflected in her obser-vations and views are about Scandinavia, or Italy, or perhaps somewhere else.On other occasions, however, Birgitta could not be clearer. So, for exam-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic113ple, in a text directed to Archbishop Bernard of Naples, she comments exten-sively, and explicitly, on local issues, including the status and conditions ofinfidel female slaves, such as the failure to instruct them in Christianity andtheir frequent use as harlots, which Birgitta labels the first sin. Birgitta thengoes on to give a catalogue of the way she sees magic being misused: thereare those, she says, who use ‘‘malignant sorcerers and diviners and the mostevil of enchantresses’’ (malignos sortilegos et diuinatores et aliquas pessimasincantatrices / forbannadhom trolkonom ok gallirkonum) in order to conceivechildren. Others employ incantations in order to make certain men andwomen fall in love with them. Still others use them to discover the future,and some to heal sicknesses. But all those who use such witchcraft or magicare cursed by God.212In the story concerning a Swedish knight who consults a prophetess(phitonissa / spakona) about the future, Birgitta is told by the voice of theLord that the devil uses his knowledge of the future through such assistantsas witches (phitones / trollkonur) to ensnare those who are unfaithful toGod.213A similar sentiment is implicit in the tale of a fisherman who usesmagic to increase his catch.214In a different kind of tale, she prays for therelease of a priest from a witch (trollkona) who has enchanted the cleric forthe purpose of fornication.215Occasionally her comments are of the mostgeneric kind, as when she condemns Saul’s use of a medium216or equates asorcerer with the devil.217Literature intended to provide moral instruction is one of the most com-mon genres of the later Middle Ages. As an example,Si;aelinna thrøst(TheConsolation of the Soul), a Swedish translation of a German original, alsoknown in Old Danish,218is clearly intended as a moralizing work, a text thatblurs the line between standard biblical exegesis and the sort of framed narra-tive one associates with collections such asThe Thousand and One Nights.219It is, of course, not merely a translation but has been expanded by using, forexample, biblical and legendary material already in Old Swedish. With aframing device constructed around the Ten Commandments, it is both acommentary and an occasion for brief tales of the sort one encounters intexts ofThe Seven Sagestype, as well as in saints’ lives and miracle collections,Icelandic7ættir, and other short tales.220Siælinna thrøstshines a bright light on the sorts of ideas from abroadthen streaming into Northern Europe, both feeding into, and being fed by,popular traditions. In one of its most complete, if sometimes puzzling, sec-tions in which the issues of witchcraft and magic are addressed, the following"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114chapter 3excerpt comes, significantly, in the context of the first commandment, ‘‘Thoushalt have no other gods before me’’ (Exod.20:3):My dear son, if you would keep the first commandment, then youshould not enchant or work witchcraft, nor advise nor perform it.You should not allow yourself to be healed with pharmacopoeia orother [magical] herbals, [although] you may certainly accept medi-cine which does not involve heresy or superstition. You shall notprophesy or have prophecies made. You shall not have yourself mea-sured with rope [bast] or red thread or with anything else.221Yo ushall not have wax or lead poured for you.

Youshould make no incantations or exhortations whether over iron oranything else. You should not set the Psalter in motion as studentsdo or anything like it.226You should not have books in which magicis written. Some people have matted hair and are thus superstitious,for you should cut it off and guard your soul as superstition andheresy are manifold and of many types which I cannot describe inthis book.227Although the writer does not explicitly mention the devil, the fact thatthis discussion comes in the context of the first commandment makes itclear that the all-important late medieval understanding of the diabolical pactcontrols the author’s thinking, so thoroughly, it would seem, that the diaboli-cal connection can simply be taken for granted. And it needs to be under-scored that this list does not represent native thinking but rather mostlyreflects the inventory in the source text.228In fact, much of the concern inSiælinna thrøstabout magic and witch-craft comes in association with this commandment, and so it tells again thestory from the legend of Saint Basil, known already in Sweden inFornsvenskalegendariet, of the young woman whose husband has arranged their union bybargaining for his soul with the devil and who is saved through the interven-tion of Saint Basil.229But now the story has an interesting twist missing from"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Narrating Magic115the earlier version: in the Old Swedish legend from circa1300, the youngman offers himself directly to the devil. In this later multiform, it is indeedthe devil who stirs up the young man’s lust, but his reaction to this emotionis worth noting: ‘‘he searched until he found a male witch (trulkarl) and wascounseled by him. The male witch (Thrulkarlin) said, ‘Do as I say and thingswill be as you desire.’ ’’230Thus it is now the intervention of a male witchthat subverts the young man and channels his desire in such a way as to bringabout the diabolical pact. If the devil represents the opposite of God in suchtales, then the witch begins to take on the role of the opposite of the saint,interceding on behalf of evil rather than goodness.In a similar tale of seduction into the secret society of devil-worshippingusers of magic inSiælinna thrøst, a priest who ‘‘practiced the black arts [and]used witchcraft and magic’’ attempts to dupe a young man into pledginghimself to the devil in exchange for riches.231But when he is on his kneebefore this ‘‘king’’ seated on a throne of gold and told that he must abandonand foreswear the Holy Trinity, he instead recommits himself to Father, Son,and Holy Ghost, ‘‘and instantly the king and his castle and all his companysank down into Hell’s abyss, and the priest as well. So go all who practicewitchcraft and devilry.’’232Elsewhere the text urges that its audience not be-have like the heathens (som hedhnugane) by believing in fate (skepnolagh ellerødhno).233In addition to the texts associated with the clerical culture of the HighMiddle Ages in Scandinavia, court life in the Nordic kingdoms guaranteedthe development of strong interests in chivalric and other elite literatures ofthe Continent.234How quickly and to what extent the worlds reflected inthese works percolated out to those beyond the demographically small groupwho constituted the ruling elite is a vexing problem. Among the stories trans-lated into the various Nordic vernaculars were a number of tales concernedwith such heroes as, for example, Charlemagne, Arthur, and Dietrich.In one such poem,Konung Alexander(King Alexander), the history ofAlexander the Great, we see an impressive image of the medieval court wiz-ard.235Nectanabus is often calledmagus‘magician’, ‘astrologer’ andsortilegus‘diviner’, ‘witch’ in the texts of other traditions. In many respects, he repre-sents the canonical learned practitioner of high magic. Nectanabus and hisfellow Egyptian ‘‘masters’’ (ma ̈stara) are described as having a knowledge offuture events from astrology, their reading of the stars, and heavenly satel-lites.236As Nectanabus himself is introduced (ll.50–51), we are told he is fullof devilry. When King Artarexes of Persia is about to attack Egypt, Nectana-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"116chapter 3bus goes to a secret chamber in the palace, takes a bronze vat and fills it, andinto it—showing his knowledge of the diabolical arts (diæwls fund,l.63)—heeventually places wax models of two ships from which he foresees the out-come of the battle. That he knows how to do this is a result of a learnedrelationship to magic, drawn from a book that his diabolical wisdom allowshim to read (swa las haninnen sinne book / mz diæwls konst thy han war klook,ll.91–92). Understanding that he is destined to lose the battle, Nectanabusdisguises himself and prepares to flee to Ethiopia, from which he will inaccordance with a prophecy go to Macedonia. Through his magical arts,which allow him by turns to transform himself into a dragon, a man, andthen back into himself (ll.274–77), he sleeps with the queen. He thus fathersAlexander with Olympiadis and subsequently becomes his son’s teacher—until, that is, Alexander challenges his prophetic abilities through the use ofastrology (l.490), and Nectanabus becomes the victim of his offspring.As this all too brief review demonstrates, common to virtually all thenarrative materials is the inclination to see in the distant past a world wheremagic has a dominant, even defining, role.237The contemporary world of themedieval writers tends to be far more staid in its deployment of magicalactors. Narrative materials touching on witchcraft come in widely varyingpackages, native and imported, prose and poetry, themes both elevated andlow, and so on, but that consistent pattern in which the bygone world wasseen to be more magical than the writer’s own persists throughout. Magicand its practitioners were in that sense often yet another tool in the writer’skit—hence the title of this chapter, intended to underscore the reticulatedsource-resource nature of the materials. That they were useful tools is not tosay that contemporary understandings of magic and witchcraft cannot beteased out of our medieval narratives but that caution is very much in order.Taken in isolation, such presentations might skew our understanding of Scan-dinavian perceptions. Supplemented by what we can also learn from medievalpopular and legal traditions, these artfully composed presentations of magicand the magical world can indeed give us a purchase on evolving Nordicviews of magic and witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Chapter4Medieval MythologiesMost people love myths, but we may not realize that we live them in ourdaily lives. In common parlance, of course, a ‘‘myth,’’ when the word is notbeing co-opted to mean ‘lie’, is understood as being ‘a story about the gods’;in the West, that typically implies compendia of Greek and Roman—or evenNorse—sacred texts, often ‘‘retold for children.’’ But myths are much morethan that, of course. It is no coincidence that when the renowned, if contro-versial, student of mythology, Joseph Campbell, published a collection of hiswritings on the topic, he used the title,Myths to Live By.1His choice of wordswas certainly felicitous insofar as they remind us of the real nature of myths:they are often doctrinal, normative statements of belief, with currency in theculture. Myths are alive, and they resonate in the lives of the individuals whohear, tell, know, and use them. In other words, they are more than just wordson a page about the characters and tales from a society long since gone.2Early in the past century, Bronislaw Malinowski articulated the nowvirtually canonical view that myths express belief and enforce morality, con-cluding, ‘‘Myth is thus a vital ingredient of human civilization; it is not anidle tale, but a hard-worked active force; it is not an intellectual explanationor an artistic imagery, but a pragmatic charter of primitive faith and moralwisdom. . . .’’3Malinowski reached this conclusion in a world where suchdeclarations were made about others—after all, he begins his remarks bystating, ‘‘Myth fulfills inprimitiveculture an indispensable function . . .’’(emphasis added). Today we recognize more readily that his comments are astrue about our own situation as they were for the Trobriand Islanders amongwhom he lived. And we realize that they are just as true for medieval Europe-ans no less than for Pacific Islanders or modern readers.For the world of the European Middle Ages, where the church wielded"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"118chapter 4enormous power and authority, it is all too easy to imagine that a myth wouldnecessarily be a product of medieval Catholicism. As this chapter discusses, itcould be, but that was hardly a requirement, as the church itself often becamea user of such materials. In the following, I take up several important mythsabout witchcraft that had currency in the Scandinavian Middle Ages, viewsshared by many tradition areas and whose roots can often be traced back inNorthern Europe to earlier eras. By the time of our evidence, the myths havefrequently been massaged by clerical thinking. In other words, these materialsreflect neither elite nor nonelite views exclusively but rather reticulated re-workings, moving back and forth between different segments of society.For one set of myths, those treating the diabolical connections of witch-craft in the eyes of the church, a great deal of documentation exists. In theother instances, although we have visible evidence and some recoverable tex-tual data, we must mostly reconstruct the myths without the assistance ofchurch documents. Thus, for example, the milk-stealing witch, a myth com-plex that gave voice to worries about perceived injustice—about advantage,disadvantage, and envy—is mostly based on visually communicated materi-als. With that in mind, an important notion for us is ‘‘cultural competence,’’that is, parallel to the notions of linguistic or communicative competence,we must try to ‘‘learn’’ the cultural codes of medieval Northern Europe; weneed to be able to see and hear in ways that would make sense to the peoplewho inhabited that world.4The acid test for this proposition, of course, isthe degree to which we can understand the curious and unequal fragmentsof that universe that are passed on to us by random preservation. In otherwords, proof comes to the degree we can recover the mythical worlds of latemedieval Scandinavians.In the Devil’s Service: The Pact and the Journey to Bla ̊kullaAlthough it is sometimes useful to discuss the medieval Nordic world as asingle entity based on a variety of well-known political, religious, and culturalrealities, there are always important regional differences to be considered, andthese patterns become pronounced in considering the materials at hand. Inthe case of the diabolical contract or bargain, the so-calledpactum cum diab-olo, the concept took root quite differently in the various tradition areasof the northern world.5The idea of the Faustian bargain, its best-knownmanifestation, eventually became a widespread, and even canonical, aspect of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Mythologies119witchcraft ideology in much of Western Europe by the end of the MiddleAges (as expressed in, e.g.,Malleus maleficarum, pt.1, quest.2et passim).That was also true throughout most of Scandinavia, where it was often calledby a variety of terms implying a bargain with the devil (e.g.,dja ̈vulspakt,dja ̈vulsfo ̈rbund). But thedjo ̈fulssamningurorsa ́ttma ́li vi5djo ̈fulinn, althoughknown, was not a common legal accusation in the early modern era in Icelandor, some have suggested, Norway.So learned an authority as Jacob Grimm speculated about the primarysource in Northern Europe for this story—heathendom or Christianity? Asfrequently noted, the roots of the diabolical pact are both anterior to, andoutside of, Christianity (e.g., Lucan, Firdusi).6It was in the context of whatbecomes the devil’s pact that patristic writers, Jerome, in particular, interpre-ted such biblical passages as Isaiah’s warning to the rulers in Jerusalem: ‘‘Wehave made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement’’ (Isa.28:15).7Exegesis on this passage suggests to many observers an embryonicsense of thepactum cum diabolo. But it is especially in the miracle associatedwith the fourth-century Saint Basil that the concept becomes well formu-lated, as discussed in Chapter3. The connivances of the devil lead a youngservant to become enamored of a senator’s daughter, and in order to fulfillhis desires, the man agrees to renounce Christ in writing and serve the devil.Having married the servant, the girl observes her husband’s apostasy andturns to Basil for help, who is able to break the devil’s hold over the servantand destroy the incriminating document. This story was well known fromtheLegenda Aureaof Jacobus de Voragine (1260–75), the source for it inFornsvenska legendariet(The Old Swedish Legendary), but the life of Saint Basilwas already well established in the Nordic world long before this reworking ofLegenda Aurea.8The influential, explicit diabolical pact from the life of Saint Basil wasfurther supported in popular tradition by the well-known tale in the MiddleAges of the sixth-century Theophilus, a narrative whose felicitous conclusionreflected the power of the Virgin Mary. In brief, this legend concerns theoeconomusof the Church of Adana in Cilicia, who in order to regain a lostoffice makes a bargain with the devil for its recovery in exchange for his soul,but, having subsequently repented his decision, manages through the VirginMary to achieve the miraculous return of the written contract.9The legend is quite specific on the matter of the contract between Theo-philus and the devil: it is written in Theophilus’s own hand, returned to himafter much prayer and fasting through the intervention of Mary, and finally"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120chapter 4burned by Theophilus shortly before his death. Turned by Paul the Deaconinto a Latin text in the eighth century, this story of ‘‘Saint Theophilus thePenitent’’ achieved great notoriety throughout medieval Christendom. Itwas, for example, an exemplum and the subject of homilies; the object of awide variety of iconographic and artistic projects; the subject of poetry byHroswitha, Gautier de Coincy, and others and a play by Rutebeuf; and,perhaps most famously, included by Vincent de Beauvais inSpeculum Histor-aleand Jacobus de Voragine inLegenda Aurea.10Other testimonies to the popularity of the devil’s pact theme, especiallyin the thirteenth century, underscore its increased role in demonologicalthinking—the story of the prodigal youth who almost concludes his bargainwith the devil in book2, chapter12of theDialogus miraculorumof Caesariusof Heisterbach (ca.1238), and additional legends in theLegenda Aurea(i.e.,those of Justina and Cyprianus, and of the knight who is also saved by theVirgin from his bargain with the devil), for example. But at what point thedevil’s pact became a necessary aspect of ecclesiastical thinking about witch-craft is difficult to fix. It is telling that in1398the theological faculty of theUniversity of Paris declared that all superstitious observances, where the re-sults were not those one could expect of God or nature, involved an impliedpact with the devil.11This idea came to be widely accepted, as may be seenfrom the fact that, in1437, Pope Eugenius IV wrote to papal inquisitors,warning them of the successes of the prince of darkness, who is gainingadherents and worshippers of demons: ‘‘As a sign of this [they] give them awritten contract or some other sign, binding themselves to demons.’’12Bythe late fifteenth century, the diabolical compact was thoroughly incorpo-rated into the inquisitor’s manual,Malleus maleficarum(pt.1, quest. II etpassim).13This theological twist on witchcraft became the principal featuredistinguishing European witchcraft ideology from parallel belief systems else-where, and by the early modern period the idea of the devil’s pact had becomewidespread in Denmark and Sweden, but less so in Norway and Iceland.14The connections between witchcraft as a crime and such seemingly mun-dane legal matters as contracts are complex and deep.15One way to contextu-alize the importance of the diabolical pact is to envision its opposite: a writtencompact with a saint, where the contract is a positive and life-embracingphenomenon. An example of this sort can be seen in a late medieval Icelandiccompact, not with the devil, but with the Virgin Mary. The book, writtenby Jo ́n4orla ́ksson, was sponsored by a certain Bjarni and given to the cloisterat Munka3vera ́, with the stipulation that the reward that Mary would give"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Mythologies121Bjarni should be delayed and given to him in the next world when his needwould be greatest.16Crafted in the same form as thepactum cum diabolo, thebook stands implicitly, perhaps even explicitly, as a counterforce to the dia-bolical pact.Tracing the growth of such ideas in medieval Nordic writings is notdifficult and is reflected in several of the texts examined earlier in detail: thetranslation of the Middle Low GermanSeelentrost(Consolation of the Soul)into Old Swedish (and from that translation into Old Danish, ca.1425) con-tains a number of popular medieval tales touching on the matter of thepactum, often reworked versions of stories known from theLegenda Aureaand its related literature. Here, for example, are familiar narratives aboutpacts with the devil being traded for love and for riches.17An Old Swedish miracle collection of circa1385is filled with tales ofdevil worshippers and those required to renounce their baptism and pledgethemselves to Lucifer and includes such commonplaces as the story of ‘‘TheWitch of Berkeley.’’18An Icelandic collection of legendary and hagiographicmaterials, AM657a4to(ca.1350), also reports such stories: one of its legendstreats the story of a man who sells his soul to the devil.19And, of course,there are many examples fromFornsvenska legendariet, such as a story fromthe life of Saint Basil, a knight who pledges himself to a devil, the story ofTheophilus himself, an analogue to ‘‘The Witch of Berkeley,’’ and so on.20Naturally, it is possible to read the idea of the pact into a variety of texts,as illustrated earlier in the case of the book of Isaiah.Along similar lines,some readers see in the story of the Swedish king Eirı ́kr ‘‘the Victorious’’(sigrsæli), as presented in the translation of Oddr Snorrason’s late twelfth-century life of O ́la ́fr Tryggvason, indications of the Faustian bargain.21Ac-cording to the saga, the king becomes ‘‘the victorious’’ only after pledginghimself to ‘‘Oddiner’’ (i.e., O ́1inn) for ten years.22In Snorri’s version inHeimskringla(History of the Norwegian Kings), Oddr the monk’s narrativeabout the bargain is not mentioned. And in the various Icelandic reworkingsof sacred writings called collectivelyMarı ́u saga(The Saga of the Virgin Mary),we see very early testimony to the story of Theophilus in the north.23Thevariation in these Theophilus stories is extraordinary, but all of them areunified on the basics of the narrative: the clerk’s frustration with his position,the role of the Jewish magician as intermediary, the presentation of Theophi-lus at the court over which the devil reigns, Theophilus’s renunciation ofChristianity and his written bargain with the devil (e.g., ‘‘ ‘Ek nita Kristi okhans modur.’4ar med gerdi hann bref ok inzscigladi med sinu fingrgulli’’),"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122chapter 4and so on.24It may be, however, that aspects of the story had currency inIceland even earlier.25Regarding actual trial materials, especially where the devil’s pact is con-cerned, the evidence for the medieval Scandinavian region is relatively thin.Although specific contracts are not mentioned, several late fifteenth-centurytrials in Stockholm mention devil worship and apostasy and suggest exactlythe sort of environment in which accusations of such contracts no doubtflourished, such as renunciation of Christianity and the embrace of Satan(e.g., ‘‘nw affsigx jak tik [addressed to a crucifix] och tagher tienisth aff fa ̈ndda-nom’’).26There appears to be but one medieval Nordic instance of a proceed-ing involving a clearly articulated diabolical contract comparable to theimages projected in all the moralizing tracts just reviewed. And that casecomes surprisingly early, and from an unexpected location, the Icelandic con-vent at Kirkjubær in1343.27Three Icelandic annals report this incident in slightly conflicting ways,although two of them are in agreement that a written bargain with the devilis at the heart of it:A nun was burned at Kirkjubær named Kristin who had dedi-cated herself in writing to the devil. She had also defiled God’s body(i.e., consecrated host) and thrown it into the privy and had engagedin intercourse with many laymen.28A nun was burned at [Kirkjubær] who had dedicated herself inwriting to the devil.29Item [Bishop Jo ́n Sigur1arson] deprived a nun at Kirkjubær ofher orders for blaspheming the pope and then she was burned.30This case represents a startlingly early appearance of the devil’s pact inthe medieval north.31In the eyes of church leaders, apostasy, diabolism, andwitchcraft share a common denial of the authority of the church. Events suchas those at Kirkjubær do not happen in a vacuum but are often preceded bya lengthy series of troubles and then set off by some notable incendiaryevent.32Just such a sequence appears to be in evidence here as well, therehaving been astronomical signs (e.g., a solar eclipse, reports of two moons)and cataclysmic episodes (e.g., the eruption of Hekla) in the preceding dec-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Mythologies123ade.33Reports already in1336of strange incidents at the cloister—moaningfrom under the dormitory flooring—are another such indication,34as is per-haps the reputation that attached itself to the cloister at Kirkjubær and itsneighbor, the monastery at4ykkvabær, about improper relations between thenuns and monks.35Flateyjaranna ́ll(The Flatey Annal), the most detail-rich text in its descrip-tion of the offenses, reports that Bishop Jo ́n had three monks placed in ironsat4ykkvabær in the same year for having assaulted their abbot; the bishop atHo ́lar had taken some similar action at the monastery at Mo\u00011ruvellir.36Asan indication of the troubled and unruly times,Lo\u0001gmannsanna ́ll(The Law-yer’s Annal) relates these events, citing the troubles at Kirkjubær amongthem.37Relevant too are the changes in church hierarchy under way in thatyear: Agatha, the abbess of Kirkjubær, died in1343and a new abbess, Jo ́runnHauksdo ́ttir, was elected. Likewise, several new Nordic bishops were ap-pointed in1343, including Jo ́n Sigur1arson to Ska ́lholt and Ormr A ́sla ́kssonto Ho ́lar, both of whom, after being consecrated, went to Iceland, which wasthen in a political and social climate that one noted scholar has described as‘‘turbulent.’’38That the bishops apparently felt compelled to address the lax-ity and misconduct in Iceland of both the ‘‘learned and lay’’ is suggested bythe entry inLo\u0001gmannsanna ́llfor the following year.39This scenario—mysterious signs, a charged social and political atmosphere—is the templatefor accusations of witchcraft, albeit in this instance the designation is entirelyin terms of a written devil’s pact.The events of1343, and the punishment meted out at Kirkjubær in par-ticular, are unique in Scandinavia before the late medieval period—a notablecontrast is provided by the incident in Bergen touched on earlier involvingRagnhildr tregaga ́s(1324–25), which demonstrates the opposite temperamentfrom church authorities. When Bishop Au1finnr, who had trained exten-sively in France, confronts Ragnhildr over her scandalous behavior, he main-tains that she has renounced God and committed herself to the devil andconcludes that hers is a case of heresy.40Rather than the harsh judgmenthanded down at Kirkjubær, the woman is simply condemned to a lifetimeobservance of fasts and the obligation to go on a multiyear pilgrimage outsideof Norway. Despite inflammatory homilies and spiritual narratives concernedwith the devil’s pact of the sort sketched earlier, when faced with actual cases,medieval authorities appear on the whole to have behaved more in the spiritof Bishop Au1finnr than of Bishop Jo ́n. With the remarkable exception ofthe execution at Kirkjubær in1343, it is only in the early modern period that"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"124chapter 4the devil’s pact appears to have been used in trials in Scandinavia, and eventhen, as noted earlier, more so in Sweden and Denmark than in Norway andIceland.41With the evolution of thepactum cum diaboloby the end of the medievalperiod, a view whose roots are to be seen already in patristic writings, thestage was set in important ways for the witch-hunts of the early modern era.But if the diabolical pact was a central tenet of Christian myths involving thedevil, it was not the only one. One of the most widespread, and certainly theone that has received the most attention in modern treatments of witchcraft,whether scholarly or popular, is the notion of witches gathering for orgiasticrites, that is, the sabbath or sabbat. Although the church fully incorporatesthe sabbat into its witchcraft ideology by the end of the Middle Ages, it is byno means clear that the church created the story, whose popular origins arestill being explored.42It is only in the later Middle Ages that the presentation of witchcraftactivities on the Continent begins to change from accusations of relativelysimple magic to a much more complex image of organized, diabolical activi-ties by witches.43But the possibility for this construction of witchcraft hadits origins already much earlier in the church’s battle against heresies. Thus,for example, inVox in Rama,a decretal letter of1232calling for cooperationin purging heretics, Pope Gregory IX describes the activities of devil-worship-pers in northern Germany as including an initiation ceremony and a banquet,after which, the participants offer to the hindquarters of a large black cat theso-called obscene kiss. When the ceremony is over, the lights are extinguishedand a concluding orgy ensues, with the pope emphasizing especially the oftenhomosexual nature of this lascivious rite.44As Norman Cohn has shown,accusations of this type made by church authorities, including gatheringswith the worship of an animal-headed god; feasting; child sacrifice; cannibal-ism; anonymous, promiscuous sex; and incest, were themselves by no meansnew but had, in fact, already been made a millennium earlier by Romanobservers about the early Christians.45The roots of this saturnalian view and its later development as part ofthe elite understanding of witchcraft in Western Europe were generallythought to have been well understood.46This perspective, perhaps particu-larly regarding the sabbat, has been challenged, or complicated in any event,by Carlo Ginzburg’s arguments regarding shamanism and European witch-craft.47The core of his thesis is the existence of centuries, if not millennia, ofsorcery and magical tradition that continued to flourish in new, adaptive"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Mythologies125forms long after the introduction of Christianity in Europe. This hiddenculture of shamanistic ritual took many forms, he argues, but remained aconsistent factor in European popular culture until long after the Renais-sance. The pivotal location of the Nordic traditions, adjacent as they havebeen throughout recorded history to cultures that practiced shamanism,make the question of shamanism, and Ginzburg’s argument, especially rele-vant for Scandinavian beliefs, a possibility a series of studies have taken up.48Between the polar opposites of innovation and continuity, what is thehistory and nature of Nordic myths touching on the sabbat scenario? In fact,it appears that Scandinavian belief structures concerning witchcraft changemarkedly already in the years around1300, as, for example, Norwegian lawsthat once called for witches to be exiled now demand capital punishment.49In addition to thepactum cum diabolo, two prominent elite perceptions ofwitchcraft are well documented at the end of the Middle Ages, namely thatof witches flying or otherwise magically transporting themselves (i.e., trans-vection) to a place of assembly, and that of the conventicles that followed,typified as they were by stereotyped anti-Christian conduct. Both of theseelements are incorporated into the myth known in large parts of Scandinaviaas the ‘‘Journey to Bla ̊kulla’’ and figure prominently in late medieval churchmurals (Figures2,3, and4), of which there are a great many in Denmark andSweden. Images projecting these views of witchcraft and witches provided animportant visualization to parishioners about such ideas.One of the central tenets of the ‘‘Journey to Bla ̊kulla’’ is that the witchestravel—usually by flying—to a location variously called Bla ̊kulla, Blaakolden,Bloksbjerg, and so on, often conceived of as a mountain in a distant countryor an island in the south Baltic, where they engage in markedly deviantbehavior, including lascivious conduct, boast of evil deeds performed, and soon (Figures3–4).50The name itself is generally traced to German placenames, usually Brocken or Blocksberg. An early indication of this complexin Scandinavia comes from a Swedish miracle of1410, a notice concerninghow a ship was endangered and then saved in the sound between the main-land and O ̈land near ‘‘Blaakulla,’’ what becomes the traditional sabbat loca-tion for Swedish witches: ‘‘A ship [of the sort] called asnekkja, belonging toSir Ture Bengtsson [Bielke], sailed from Lu ̈beck to Stockholm, and in thesea-lanes near Bla ̊kulla was imperiled by a great tempest.’’51This event wasrecorded in the early1420s as one of the miracles associated with the altar ofthe Dominican cloister in Stockholm, especially the triptych of Christ beingtaken down from the cross.52The place of Bla ̊kulla as a site of peril is thus"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"126chapter 41.

The earliest clear evidence of this Scandinavian sabbat scenariois provided by Olaus Magnus, Sweden’s last Reformation-era Catholic arch-bishop, while living in exile in Rome. There he published in1555his greatethnological work,Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus(Description of theNorthern Peoples). He devotes much of this massive survey to questions ofthe supernatural, including what appears to be the ‘‘Journey to Bla ̊kulla,’’albeit referred to by the circumlocution Jungfrun:Moreover a tall mountain rises near the northern coast of the island,which the common sailors, in order to shun an unlucky omen andstorms at sea, call the Virgin.

They seem to think that the divinity of the mountain isnot ungrateful, for an old tale recalls what happened once: a voicecame down from above and someone who had given a present wasordered to change his anchorage to avoid running into danger; bydoing this he remained unhurt when others were wrecked.It is saidthat at certain seasons of the year a coven of northern witches assembleson this mountain to try out their spells. Any who comes at all late to thisdevil-worship undergoes a dreadful chastising;but in these matters itis better to follow one’s belief, rather than people’s assertions.53Magnus’s critical spirit notwithstanding, we are clearly dealing here witha sabbat theme, an image of massed enemies on an island that has parallels"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"3.

By the end of the sixteenth century,this image of the congregating witch begins to appear regularly in court re-cords as well, as, for example, when one accused witch in Stockholm declaresof another, Whore-Geska, that she ‘‘had often been in Bla ̊kulla, and is of thatsociety that rides [there] and have the mark in their noses . . . ,’’54andsubsequently says of yet a third accused witch, Brita, that she too ‘‘is not ofthe best kind [sla ̈chted‘family, race, species’], she was also that sort thatusually rode to Bla ̊kulla [ . . . ] and further, she said that it was not long sinceshe had had sex with the devil....’’55Did such a view have currency already a century or more earlier in Catho-lic Scandinavia? And what is the relationship of this complex to native tradi-tions about witchcraft? First, it must be said that the medieval historicalrecords, such as summaries of trials and other nonliterary documents, give fewindications of such beliefs. A number of Nordic trials from the later MiddleAges focus on sex and love, but almost always in the context of love triangles,where passions of the heart are clearly at the forefront, not on indiscriminate,lascivious, orgiastic activities of the sort that so distress Pope Gregory IX in thethirteenth century, or the threat represented by such assemblies."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130chapter 4Regarding the image of massed enemies threatening normal society, sep-arating native and foreign traditions is naturally problematic. Virtually all ofNorse mythology as we have it, for example, builds toward the moment whenthe forces of evil gather under Loki’s leadership and launch their all-outassault on the gods. Correspondingly, foreign texts too, including those wellknown in Scandinavia, frequently employ the image of assembled demons.Thus,Siælinna thrøst(The Consolation of the Soul), a Swedish translationfrom Middle Low German (ca.1430), contains an exemplum from Gregory’sDialoguesconcerning the devils’ meeting (‘‘Devils render accounts’’), whichputs on display a highly sabbat-like, diabolical scene of devils gathering toreport their deeds to Lucifer.56And, of course, a host of late medieval churchmurals in Denmark and Sweden make it apparent that this belief complexwas known, or becoming known at the very least, at the end of the MiddleAges (Figures3and4).57In native monuments treating Nordic witchcraft, particularly where itrelates to the sort of magic understood to have been used in the pagan period,practitioners are frequently presented in surviving narratives as needing assis-tants, and these texts thus also project the image of individuals gatheredtogether in groups in order to practice witchcraft. The witch (vo\u0001lva ok sei5-kona)inO\u0001rvar-Odds saga(Arrow-Odd’s Saga) provides an exceptionally pro-vocative example of this sort: ‘‘There was a woman called Heid, a witch withsecond sight [lit., a magic woman and a prophetess], so with her uncannyknowledge she knew all about things before they happened. She would go tofeasts, telling people about their destinies and forecasting the weather for thecoming winter. She used to have a band of fifteen girls and fifteen boys [lit.,She had with her30individuals, that is,15boys and15girls].’’58The older, early fourteenth-century manuscript of this saga is more elab-orate than the younger, late fourteenth-century main manuscript on twopoints concerning the assistants: it explains that Hei1r needs this companyin order to provide her with chanting (‘‘4at var raddli1mikit,3vı ́at3ar skyldivera kve1jandi mikil . . .’’) and that Hei1r goes outside with this group inorder to perform the magic rites (‘‘gekk hon3a ́u ́tme1li1isı ́nu . . . ok efldisei1’’).59The significance of the second point resides in its similarity to histor-ical materials that forbid such activity. Thus, as one example among many,Gula7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Gula7ing) mentions ‘‘[those who are killed] for[deeds of] murder or for [the practice of] witchcraft or for going abroad atnight to call forth evil spirits and to promote heathendom thereby.’’60This image of the witch surrounded by chanting assistants cannot help"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Mythologies131but bring to mind the dramatic treatment of similar material inEirı ́ks sagarau5a(The Saga of Eirı ́kr the Red) in its presentation of the activities in theGreenland colony (see Chapter3). There we are told that4orbjo\u0001rg, the seer-ess, is one of nine sisters (nı ́u systr), all of whom were seeresses. Perhaps weare to understand this comment biologically, meaning simply that there werenine female offspring in4orbjo\u0001rg’s childhood home, but one wonders, giventhe fact that ‘‘sister’’ (systir) can also refer to elective affinities (i.e., ‘nun’,‘sister of charity’), whether this comment suggested to its audience that4or-bjo\u0001rg is, in fact, one of a group of seeresses.4orbjo\u0001rg is said to travel about attending feasts in a fashion comparableto the scene inO\u0001rvar-Odds saga, except, of course, that she lacks the travelingband of assistants. The author likely omits this routine feature, as the sagawants to underscore Gu1rı ́1r’s role in the ceremony, and the lack of compan-ions makes this plot development possible.4orbjo\u0001rg must ask for such agroup to be assembled: ‘‘And the next day as it got late, she was suppliedwith what she needed to perform the witchcraft [sei5r]. She asked for the aidof women who had that knowledge which was necessary to the witchcraft[sei5r] called ‘‘warlock-songs.’’61After the heroine, Gu1rı ́1r, agrees to over-come her reluctance as a Christian and participate in this pagan rite, the sagasays that the women formed a circle round the scaffold where4orbjo\u0001rg wassitting and Gu1rı ́1r sings the ‘‘warlock-songs.’’62Whether these scenes fromO\u0001rvar-Odds saga,Eirı ́ks saga rau5a, and else-where represent empirical knowledge of pagan practice or, as some have sug-gested, romantic interpolations is uncertain, yet their testimony assures usthat the image of the congregating witch, especially of female witches, wasalready in use by the fourteenth century at least and that the fourteenthcentury’s interpretation of the past, whether accurately or not, understoodsuch conventicles to be one of the activities associated with witchcraft.Transvection and assembly are brought together too inKetils saga hængs(The Saga of Ketill ‘‘Trout’’),where the gathering is adapted to native legaltraditions of the ‘‘assembly,’’ the7ing. Perhaps composed already by circa1300, we know this text only from fifteenth-century and later manuscripts,and clearly the extant text must be read in the context of a gathering in thebroadest sense, but one that perhaps helps lay the foundation for how thesabbat, a supernatural assembly, was understood in Northern Europe:63One night he was awakened by a great crack in the woods. Hejumped up and saw a witch [sa ́tro ̈llkonu], and her mane fell to her"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132chapter 4shoulders.

Don’t detain me. I don’t like you. You’rethe one who did in [the giant] Kaldrani.’’ And then she waded outinto the water and then to the sea. There was no shortage of witch-rides [gandrei5ir] among the islands during the night, but Ketillwasn’t harmed. . . .64Moreover, in the immediately preceding episode, Ketill encounters, andapparently kills, anothertro ̈llkona‘witch’, ‘troll’, who also appears to be onthe move, having just come, ‘‘black as pitch,’’ up out of the sea, and whotries to return to it in the shape of a whale.65This idea of thegandrei5(as a verb phrase,renna gand[orgo\u0001ndum])usually implies a witch going out, often in a noncorporeal sense, to gatherinformation, as opposed to the sabbat-like association ofKetils saga hængs.When, for example, the witch4o ́rdı ́s awakens inFo ́stbrœ5ra saga(The Sagaof the Sworn Brothers) after being observed having a troubled night’s sleep,she reports on the activities and whereabouts of her enemy, saying, ‘‘Afarhave I ridden the witch-ride this night.’’66In a slightly different vein, thesighting of a witch-ride can portend great events, as when Hildiglu ́mr hasa vision before the burning-in inBrennu-Nja ́ls saga(Njal’s Saga), which isinterpreted by others as a witch-ride.67Other terms, such askveldri5a‘eve-ning-rider’ andmyrkri5a‘dark-rider’, are used for the practitioners of thisphenomenon, andtrollri5a‘witch-ridden’ for those subjected to it.68These materials suggest an evolution in the concept of the witch-ride,sinceBrennu-Nja ́ls saga,Fo ́stbræ5ra saga, and other relevant sagas are pre-served in manuscripts already from the early fourteenth century.Ketils sagahængs, with its more continental view of the witch-ride, on the other hand, isknown only from fifteenth-century manuscripts. Another fifteenth-centurymanuscript tells of4orsteinn bæjarmagn, one of King O ́la ́fr Tryggvason’sretainers, who, on a trip to Finland, sees a boy on a mound. The boy callsout: ‘‘ ‘Mother [ . . . ] hand me my crooked stick and gloves, I want to gofor a witch-ride [gandrei5]. They’re having a celebration down below in theUnderworld.’ Then a crooked stick, shaped like a poker, was thrown out of"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Mythologies133the mound. The boy put on the gloves and sat astride the stick and startedriding it, as children often do.’’694orsteinn too acquires a stick from the woman in the mound, followsthe boy to a feast in the Otherworld, and returns, after a near misadventure,with various treasures from the ‘‘world below,’’ which has been presided overby its own king and queen. There is no question here of a witches’ sabbat inthe sense it is meant in later periods, but rather of a very traditional visit tothe world of the elves and assorted otherworldly creatures often made inNordic (and Celtic) folklore.70On the other hand, this tale of transvectionon akro ́kstafr‘crooked stick’ to a great celebration in a topsy-turvy worldlike—yet unlike—our own is suggestive, an association made explicit by theauthor’s use of the termgandrei5‘witch-ride’. Importantly, then, changes areafoot: in the two later, fifteenth-century manuscripts, ‘witch-ride’ is used todesignate physical transvection to the site of an assembly or feast, whereasearlier manuscripts use the term to designate a generally less corporeal, andnoncongregating, image of the solitary witch undertaking a specific mission.Of course, there is nothing in these texts thatabsolutelydemands thatsuch concepts as thegandrei5need be understood as native in origin ratherthan imported—there rarely is. That magical arch-villain of medieval theol-ogy, Simon Magus, claims, in the early fifteenth-century SwedishSiælinnathrøst, for example, that he can fly.71The same collection of moralizing talestells the story of Saint Germanus, the interpretation of which, within thebroad scope of international witchcraft beliefs, would appear to relate to thenotion of nocturnal vectitation, although in the exemplum itself, the taleis specifically used to moralize against secret pagans and other unfaithfulmiscreants.72As the story is part of a commentary on the first commandment,that is hardly surprising.According to the tale, Bishop Germanus takes lodging overnight andsees the housewife setting the table, just as everyone is going to bed. Ger-manus asks who will eat the food, and she answers that ‘‘sprites’’ (tomptagudhane) come at night and that she must do as she does in order for herlivestock to thrive. Germanus immobilizes the creatures and ascertains thatthey come in the shape of the woman’s neighbors. When a messenger is sentand reports that he has visited the homes of these neighbors and discoveredthem asleep in their beds, the ‘‘sprites’’ admit that they are really devils sentto plague those who do not follow the right faith. Germanus sends themaway in shame, and the housewife and her household are converted from"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134chapter 4their unbelieving ways (‘‘Oc hustrun oc folkit vmwændos fran thera wantrooc diæfwlslike willo’’).The sabbat-like scene, the motif of the transvectant spirit out traveling,feasting, and stealing food from neighbors, is a common element of witch-craft beliefs, extending far outside the European orbit.73One might betempted to accept these features as simply part of the Christian ideology thatgives rise to the Saint Germanus tale. Still, these texts are relative latecomers,and there exist early indications of a Nordic belief in conveyance by unusualmeans. Perhaps the most suggestive testimony of all with respect to assemblyand transvection is the famous passage fromHa ́vama ́l155, from the thir-teenth-centuryRegiusmanuscript:That tenth I know,if night-nags sportingI scan aloft in the sky:I scare them with spellsso they scatter abroad,heedless of their hides,heedless of their haunts.74Interpretations of this passage vary, but central to all readings is the ideaof the ‘‘Wild Hunt,’’ ordie wilde Jagd(E501).75This complex is well knownfrom theCanon episcopiof Regino of Pru ̈m (ca.900), which had currency inmedieval Scandinavia:76‘‘It is said in holy books that night-riders or transvec-ting witches (kveldri5ur e5a hamleypur) are believed to travel with the goddessDiana and Herodias for a while over the great sea riding on whales or seals,birds or animals, or over the great land, and they are thought to travel in theflesh, but books affirm that this is a lie.’’77Thus does the author ofJo ́ns saga Baptista(The Saga of John the Baptist),circa1300, attempt to explain the nature of Herodias—and ultimately herdaughter, Salome—just before the beheading of John the Baptist.78Herethe writer, more or less directly influenced by Regino or one of that text’ssubsequently inspired works, such as the tenth-century penitential of Burch-ard of Worms, maintains Regino’s rationalist point of view, one that he hasin turn taken from Saint Augustine: there is no divinity other than God, andthose who believe in such things are allowing themselves to be deceived bythe devil.79The image of the night-riding hag is well known elsewhere in Nordicsources. AlreadyA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Older Law of Va ̈stergo ̈tland), fromthe early Swedish thirteenth century, describes a famous slander that can be"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Mythologies135uttered of a woman: ‘‘I saw that you rode the ‘witch-ride’ [lit., ‘the pen-gate’], with your hair loose, and in a witch’s shape, ‘caught’ between nightand day’’ (‘‘Iak sa at3u reet a quiggrindu lo ̈fharæ3. ok i trols ham3a alt variamrift nat ok daghe ́r’’).80Perhaps this picture of a supernaturally empoweredfemale figure riding an unusual object is correctly tied to the frequent, andoften quite archaic, projection of valkyries, female trolls, witches, ogresses—indeed, apparently the entire range of supernatural female figures—astridewolves, a picture referred to in many different early Norse media, runic in-scriptions, picture stones, and mythological prose and poetry.81The image of transvectant females, albeit in the much more conventionalsetting of religious pilgrims, is fused with that of assembled, Nordic femalesthreatening society in one of the legends associated with Saint Ingrid, thefounder of the Dominican convent in Ska ̈nninge, Sweden, a story we knowonly from the mid-sixteenth-centuryHistoria de gentibus septentrionalibusofOlaus Magnus (1555,217[book6, chapter19]). When Ingrid and her com-panions (virginibus comitibus) return from the Holy Land, the devil is said tohave ridden into the city in the form of a mighty lord with a troop of knightsand convinced the citizens that these women were, in fact, a group of terriblewitches (pessimarum incantatricum). When the crowd begins to cross itself,the devil and his host suddenly disappears, the truth about Ingrid and hertraveling companions is revealed, and they are welcomed into the town andpresented with gifts. No earlier evidence of this tale is known, and it has beenreasonably suggested that Olaus Magnus himself knew this tale, not from anywritten source, but rather from oral traditions in Ska ̈nninge.82The reputation of Saint Ingrid, great in the Nordic Middle Ages, haslargely been eclipsed by her vastly more famous compatriot, Saint Birgitta.83Indeed, the similarities between these two Swedish women, separated by acentury, with their shared experiences of traveling to Rome to convince thechurch to establish gynocentric religious houses in Sweden, has led somescholars to conclude that Ingrid’s and Birgitta’s biographies, and the storiesassociated with them, have on occasion been conflated. This idea is notewor-thy in the context of the present discussion, for among Birgitta’sRevelationesExtravagantes(preserved in fourteenth-century manuscripts) is the story ofthe saint’s arrival in Rome at a time when her ecstatic religious experienceswere still without official sanction or interpretation. Confronted with herextraordinary visions and even more extraordinary claims, some of the rousedpopulace of Rome assault Birgitta, saying that they want to burn her aliveand that she is a witch.84The strong parallels between these two stories make"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136chapter 4it probable that the story of Ingrid’s return from the Holy Land has beeninfluenced by—or perhaps has influenced—the story of Birgitta’s arrival inRome. The legend of Saint Ingrid further substantiates the proposition thatthe concept of assembled witches was familiar in medieval Sweden.Were transvection and assembly traditional aspects of Nordic witchcraftthen, or were they imported into Northern Europe in the later Middle Agesas part of an elite continental view of witchcraft? In all likelihood, bothimported elite traditions and native popular traditions played important partsin shaping the story. Certainly Nordic belief systems about witches and thesupernatural appear to have long included an element of vectitation and, bythe close of the Middle Ages if not earlier, of witches assembling.85Witch-rides, however, appear in the older sources to have had a differentpurpose than the one imagined in the continental view of witchcraft, a pur-pose that seems consonant with witch beliefs in their broader internationalperspective. One imagines that this native belief complex about the witch’sjourney to discover information, or to attack individuals, became an obviouscandidate for inclusion in the continental construction of the witches’ sabbatas that image made its way into Scandinavia, and was assimilated to it, espe-cially in elite paradigms of the witch.86Furthermore, the sexuality associated with native traditions ofsei5randwitchcraft in the pagan period (ergi‘unmanliness’) does not seem to mapwell onto the diabolical and orgiastic sexual debauchery described in latertestimonials concerned with the ‘‘Journey to Bla ̊kulla.’’87This idea, at least,may be best accounted for as a borrowing from the elite continental modelof sabbat activities. But as already Sahlgren understood, a further element inthe development of the complex in Northern Europe may have been thefact that there existed additional, separate concepts concerning abduction byotherworldly creatures (so-calledbergtagningar), especially where these talesinvolved elements from the Mountain of Venus motif (F131.1), that ‘‘hollowmountain otherworld where men live a life of ease and lustful pleasure incompany with beautiful women.’’88In other words, the sabbat complex thatemerges at the end of Nordic Middle Ages was likely heavily reticulated withelements from both native and foreign understandings of witchcraft.The Milk-Stealing Witch and Other MythsThese myths about the diabolical pact, assembly, and transvection are con-nected through a shared discourse about the nature of evil, the source of its"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Mythologies137effectuation (i.e., the devil), and so on to several additional tradition com-plexes. In this instance, however, we have far less textual evidence from theMiddle Ages and must instead reconstruct the myths by coordinating themedieval materials with data from later periods. That, of course, does notmake them less interesting to the medieval period, but it does affect what wecan know. And it offers us the interesting opportunity to test the concept ofcultural competence.What, for example, do we understand as we enter the antechamber,vapenhus, of a Swedish parish church and find on one side of the door animage from the later Middle Ages of a diabolical figure holding a very longpole stretched over the top of the doorframe to the other side of the door,where at the other end of the pole stands a woman? On closer inspection, itis apparent that she is receiving a pair of shoes from the pole. Or can it bethat she is giving them? Can we discover what such a medieval image meant,and, more significantly, why it would matter that parishioners should see itlast among the many images as they leave the church?In fact, thanks to the industry of several scholars, we know quite a bitabout this mural and its purpose.89With roots stretching back to at least thethirteenth century (and well into the modern era), it is a Nordic particulariza-tion of the international tale type known asThe Old Woman as Troublemaker(AT1353).90The woman is known as Sko-Ella (‘Shoe’-Ella), sometimes Titta-Gra ̊, and known as the ‘‘woman who was worse than the devil.’’ According topostmedieval traditions, the devil had long hoped to stir up trouble between amarried couple and engages Sko-Ella as this helper, implying some sort ofrelationship with him. Her reward is to be a pair of shoes. She tells the wifein the couple that her husband has been unfaithful and that the wife canprevent future philandering if she cuts off a lock of his beard at night.91Sko-Ella then tells the husband that his wife is planning to kill him at night witha knife. He is thus prepared when she approaches him at night to clip hisbeard and kills her. The devil, given that he believes Sko-Ella is actually worsethan he, fears giving her the reward and does so only at the end of the longpole.92The story of Sko-Ella is, then, a moralizing tale about the evils that comefrom slander, gossip, and loose talk, as well as, of course, from intercoursewith the devil (although it should be noted that in the story as we have it,Sko-Ella pays no price for her actions).93Most noteworthy is that the scene’sfrequent placement around the door functioned as a final warning aboutproper behavior to a parishioner, female parishioners in particular, one imag-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138chapter 4ines, before leaving the church (see Chapter6). Thus the meaning of ourmural is not only intelligible and sensible but spoke to its intended audienceabout the hierarchy of social codes in medieval Sweden: rancor and discordborn of slander, meddling, and gossip are works of the devil. Our culturalcompetence, our ability to ‘‘fill in the blanks’’ about the context of the mural,is in fact high in this instance.A more widespread myth complex involving violations of the social codesis that of the milk-stealing witch, a belief system known in several Europeantradition areas.94In his influential eleventh-centuryDecreta,BurchardofWorms, citing an earlier penitential, makes explicit reference to the complex:‘‘Have you as certain women believe they have done with the help of the devilthrough their bewitchments and spells (fascinationibus et incantationibus) andtaken from their neighbors’ overabundance of milk and honey for themselvesand their animals or for whomever they want?’’ he asks.95Something very similar, combining the understanding of a Regino and aBurchard about the devil’s power to deceive people into believing his poweris real, together with the idea of the milk-stealing witch, is found in animportant Swedish text of the fourteenth century, Magister Mathias’sHomoconditus(1330–50). A sourcebook for preachers to the laity, it was written byone of the most influential Swedish clergymen of the century.96Here Magis-ter Mathias takes up the concept of the milk-stealing witch and not onlyverifies that the myth was known to him already in the early fourteenthcentury but also ties it to the view stated explicitly in such works as theCanonepiscopi, namely, that such ideas are only deceptions of the devil, not realphenomena.97Specifically, the tradition he knows suggests that there existedwomen who made bags into which they could gather milk from their neigh-bors’ cows.98Naturally, his long residence in Paris makes entirely plausiblethe possibility that he has learned this tradition from non-Nordic sources—Jan Wall, for example, makes a credible case for the potential of British influ-ence on Magister Mathias.99Andwehaveseenininstancessuchasthefifteenth-century story about Saint Germanus fromSiælinna thrøst, the ideaof food theft by way of supernatural interventions was widespread and oftenused by the church itself toward its ends.These many references to the milk-stealing witch in the works of learnedclergymen, foreign and domestic, would appear to suggest that this beliefsystem was wholly imported from abroad, but I am by no means convincedthat such was the case.

With a heavyheart the king remained sitting, but all the others went to theirhomes. Now in order to find out what had caused this event, theking ordered a Finn to be seized who was reputed to be skilled inmany hidden things [er margfro ́5r var], to make him confess thetruth. He tortured him, yet got nothing out of him. The Finnturned to the king’s son Harald for help, and Harald asked the kingfor mercy, but in vain. Then Harald let him escape, braving theking’s anger, and accompanied him himself. They came to somechieftain’s house where a great feast was being celebrated, and theywere to all appearances welcomed there. And when they had re-mained there till the spring, one day this chieftain said to Harald,‘‘A mighty great affront your father thinks it that I took some foodfrom him, this winter; but I shall reward you with some joyful news:your father is dead now, and you must return home. Then you haveas your own all the realms he ruled, and all of Norway besides.’’100This scene, of course, distinguishes itself from the later tales of the milk-stealing witch in several ways, including the marked occasion (Yule) and thegender of the thief. Perhaps especially significant is the plot-driven purposethe theft serves in the saga, yet the fundamental similarity between tales ofthis sort and the myth of the milk-stealing witch also suggest that the historyof the complex may be more intricate than it at first appears.101Moreover,the motif in which food magically disappears and reappears is well known inmore recent Nordic folklore, although usually associated in modern tales withthe activities of thehuldrefolk‘elves’ and other supernatural creatures.102Theability of the ‘‘Finn’’ here is clearly tied to his magical abilities (margfro ́5r\u0003‘much knowing’, of magic).That Snorri appropriated popular materials incomposing sagas has been demonstrated elsewhere, and there is little reasonto doubt that something of the same sort has transpired here.103But, ofcourse, from the point of view of those who knew, believed, and used thesemyths in the Middle Ages, their precise origins would have been of little"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140chapter 45.

Figures5,6,7,9, and10).104One of the mostremarkable aspects of this myth is how well-attested it is in the mural paint-ings of late medieval and early modern churches in Northern Europe—butits distribution is not even throughout the area.105Here we begin to see strongdifferences between various Nordic areas, with this specific configuration ofthe milk-stealing witch primarily figuring into the church iconography ofDenmark and Sweden.106According to one study, there are some sixtychurches with images of this myth: forty in Sweden, four in Finland, sixteenin Denmark, and three in northern Germany.107Although all of these scenes can be reasonably connected with this com-plex, there are regional treatments of the materials. In Denmark, variousdevils typically bring the milk to churns where it will be turned into butter.On Gotland, a woman milks the cows but with assistance of, or in the com-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Mythologies141pany of, devils. In Sweden itself, a devil often holds the cow while it is suckledby another animal, whereas in Finland, a devil holds the cow while it ismilked by a woman.108A further seventy-three churches show scenes of butterchurning associated with this story, while there are thirteen with scenes ofwomen being taken to Hell with attributes suggesting they too are part ofthis complex. All told, Wall reckons that there are143scenes of this myth invarious churches, reflecting strong testimony to the popularity of the myth,as well as the importance pictorial communication channels played in themedieval period.This evidence suggests an impression of the myth’s age and distributionand if our only source of information were the murals, we might be temptedto believe that this complex properly belonged only to the very late medievaland Reformation eras. But there are a number of indications that this mythhad currency already much earlier and was being influenced by Church doc-trine, developing a view of witchcraft that, on the one hand, drew on localtraditions, while, on the other, was also informed by elite views importedfrom the Continent. It is not difficult to imagine how the church might pushback against such ‘‘local’’ beliefs, as in their appearances in the penitentialssuggests, yet at the same time appropriate them for their own larger purposeas a warning about trafficking with the demons and falling into the power ofthe devil.Very sensibly, the myth of the milk-stealing witch is explained, or per-haps even explained away, by noting how such a tale addresses such basichuman emotions as envy and jealousy: Why does that person have more thanI do? And do they have more because they have taken something away fromme? These materialist explanations appear to motivate everything from someof the best-known witch-hunts, such as Salem in1692, to modern politicaldebates.109Exploring this psychological dimension edges us closer to theinner meaning of these myths, I believe, but in emphasizing the implicitconcern with ‘‘lack’’ in the story, we should not discount either the outragethat the idea of theft itself must have engendered or the fear the possibilityof supernatural powers being active in the community must have created.Myths of this sort—not only that of the milk-stealing witch but theother narratives as well—have had strong explanatory and psychologicalpower, but at the same time we recognize this purpose, we should also realizethat members of medieval society were not as interested in brooding aboutthe nature of things, I suspect, as they were in taking effective countermea-sures, and these myths helped point the way."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"6.

Once in a greatwhile we see, I suspect, glimpses of social conflicts that bubble up in such away as to draw the attention of elite society and thus be recorded (e.g.,fifteenth-century Arboga), but for the most part, to the extent that suchthings took place, they happened in ways that did not make them celebratedenough to enter the records, or if they did, then the cases were handled bythe authorities (e.g., Ragnhildr tregaga ́s).111Either way, we know very littleabout accusations concerning what is sometimes called village-level witchcraftin the Nordic Middle Ages. Yet unless nonempowered society in that timeand in that place was very unlike any other we know or has been writtenabout, their myths were not unidirectional. In other words, although it isgenerally understood that there is a connection between belief and myth, theassumption seems to be that belief feeds myth, but not the other way around.In that view, myths are a kind of terminal dumping ground for receivedopinion, but the truth is far different.In the real world of medieval Scandinavia, one can readily imagine, thequestion often came up regarding what one should do when witchcraft isabroad in the community. In fact, there is a strong argument to be made thatmyths of the sort under consideration here do not merely reflect anxietiesand beliefs but also help set the terms for behavior. Acting out the beliefsimplicit in traditional narratives, what one folklorist describes as the dramaticextension of legend complexes into real life, is a factor frequently cited in thecontext of contemporary rumor or moral panics concerned with the sort ofscenario one can imagine must have happened on a few occasions in theScandinavian Middle Ages.112When such behaviors—such acts of osten-sion—occur, they represent reticulations between beliefs, on the one hand,and behavior that helps constitute these phenomena, on the other.113Osten-sion gives individual actors the power to control, or at least the sense thatthey can control, their lives; the chain of causation allows them to do some-thing about their situations, not merely be victims of them.In that context, I return to an idea raised in the early pages of this book,namely that what is important in defining witchcraft and magic is most of allwhat their practitioners do or were thought to do. In other words, what mat-ters is not just the static view of what witchcraft was, in the whole ‘‘eye ofnewt’’ sense, but rather how witches conduct themselves and what they do, tothe extent, for example, that theymakediabolical pacts, theystealfood, theycausediscord, theydry upcows, and so on.

Yet however unlikely theidea of justice within the court systems of medieval Northern Europe mayseem, readers of the medieval Icelandic sagas, for example, will appreciate thepossibility of ‘‘medieval justice’’ being both fair and real, if also susceptibleto manipulation.A valuable defense against accusations of witchcraft, at least in the worldbefore the witch-hunts of the early modern era, was an upstanding reputa-tion, and individuals went to some lengths to preserve their good names.Thus the laws and court records of medieval society reflect grave sensitivityabout accusations of witchcraft, as when witnesses appear before the justicesin Stockholm in1485to testify that they have heard a man call a certainwidow a witch (trullkona).2Bearing in mind this issue of reputation, as wellas the broader question of medieval legal process, it is helpful to consider thefollowing case: in Stockholm, on June23,1478,awomannamedSigridadmits that she has called the apparently troublesome Ragnhild ‘gray goose’(graagaas) a heretic (kia ̈tterska) because Ragnhild and her daughter had sleptwith the same man.3A week—and the oath of five good men as to Ragnhild’sinnocence—later, the council was on the verge of giving Sigrid a serioussentence (possibly the death penalty), when the pleas of the ‘‘better women’’(dande quinnor) convince them merely to exile her from the city.

And the case also empha-sizes the great care with which trials were undertaken in the Nordic MiddleAges, despite modern, popular perceptions of a capricious rather than carefulmedieval judiciary.Legal thinking, not just with respect to criminal cases, but also regardinginheritance, property, and most other aspects of daily life, were matters ofcareful deliberation in the Nordic Middle Ages, although opinions about thequality and usefulness of these records vary greatly.6Synthesizing many dec-ades of debate about the nature of jurisprudence in medieval Scandinavia, anoted historian asks in a recent essay whether laws were held to exist fromthe beginning and could thus only be identified rather than legislated in theNorwegian Middle Ages.7One of his conclusions is that the transformativethirteenth century witnesses the emergence of a new kind of individual, onewho understands legal principles and possesses specialized knowledge notavailable to ordinary people, a key ingredient in making possible the unified,hierarchical nations then being formed.8There are, of course, a number of questions that need to be asked of theNordic laws, as of all sources: Who created them and for what reason? Whyand by what means have they been preserved? Are they representative? Whatpower relationships gave rise to them? Do our consequent attempts to under-stand such empirical evidence—and impose meaning on it—shed usefullight? Most significantly, do our readings result in views that would be recog-nized by the producers and consumers of our evidence?Most researchers would agree on the value of these and related questionsbut probably not find themselves in agreement about the answers. The earlylaws raise many irresoluble puzzles, but certain facts emerge: all of the medie-val Nordic law texts we possess demonstrably spring from the Christian era,meaning that in their extant forms they are all overtly Christian in tone andattitude.

Curative functions of thissort largely depend on the ‘‘magical worldview.’’10Witchcraft in this sense,as a logical cultural construct meant to deal effectively with the world, wasclassically formulated through the study of African witchcraft, in a consciousrefutation of a view that regarded magic as unintelligible to logical thought.In addition to the conclusion that the living world of magic and witchcraftis anything but illogical, this approach has helped us recognize importantsocial functions of witchcraft and helped develop better, more dynamic, inci-dent-specific interpretive frameworks for assessing witchcraft trials, as thefollowing sections describe.Regulating Magic and WitchcraftSecular LawsA remarkable resource for the study of medieval Nordic life is its secular legalsystem, not only the national law codes from medieval Denmark, Norway,Sweden, and Iceland, but also earlier collections of regional laws. Togetherthese texts provide fascinating insights into how witches and witchcraft wereperceived in the centuries after the conversion to Christianity. Commentingon the central problem of exploiting such normative sources, whether secularor ecclesiastical, one noted scholar in this field neatly summarizes the keyconundrum as ‘‘whether any of the early medieval written laws and eventhe penitentials and theindiculi superstitionumdeal with activities that werecontemporary with the texts that describe and denounce them or simplyconventionally repeat earlier material.’’11The source value of the Nordic lawshas been clouded somewhat by several interlocking scholarly debates con-cerned with nativist and antinativist arguments about the origins and contextof these laws.12Early commentators, such as Montesquieu, Hegel, andGrimm, believed they were able to find in the earliest Germanic law codespristine reflections of pre-Roman (and thusecht)Teutonicsocialregula-tions.13"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Law149Influenced by this perspective, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Nor-dic philology and historiography developed a particular view about the pre-sumed oral nature of the laws before they were written down, a process thatbegins in earnest in the twelfth century in Scandinavia: for example, theAnnales Ryenses(Annals of Ryd) state for the year1170that ‘‘the laws of theDanes are published.’’14Even earlier,I ́slendingabo ́k(The Book of the Iceland-ers) says that the Icelanders decide in1117that their laws would thenceforthbe written down and not merely ‘‘declaimed.’’15Before the written laws,medieval testimony suggests that they were recited orally (sag5ilo\u0001g uppandso on) at the various assemblies. This image is most vividly presented in theIcelandic sagas, which are filled with scenes at the Al3ingi where the readerwitnesses the vital role the ‘‘law speaker’’ (lo\u0001gso\u0001guma5r) has as the preliteratekeeper of the culture’s legal codes.16Other testimony—such as the references in some of the Old Swedishlaws to a custom of ‘‘law recitation’’ (laghsagha, a term that over time cameto define the law’s geographical application)—strengthens the established im-pression of a tradition of oral law recitation being supplemented by private,desultory notes on the oral laws—what have been famously called ‘‘folk lawbooks’’ (folkelovbøker)—which in turn gives way over time to organized, sys-tematic, and written codifications of the laws, which were officially sanc-tioned and approved by the monarchy.17Although this view, and itsassumptions, has not been without critics,18it has certainly been the domi-nant perception of the early medieval secular laws in the Nordic countries, atwelfth- and thirteenth-century world seen as existing at the moment of tran-sition from a predominantly oral to a predominantly written elite culture.19Against this nativist view, some scholars have argued for the significantinfluence of non-Nordic legal models, such as Mosaic law and other legaltraditions.20There have even been disputes about the degree to which onecan reasonably take an essentially Durkheimian view about the fundamentalrelationship between cultural institutions and the culture that gives rise to thelaws.21Connected to this issue is the question of age: given the overarchingimportance of the law codes for understanding developments in the medievalNordic world, one might expect a carefully worked out chronology, but sucha scheme has proved elusive. There is broad consensus, for example, that theoldest of the Norwegian laws may have been written down as early as thetwelfth century, but most manuscripts derive from the thirteenth and latercenturies.22Thus the oldest fragment fromGula7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Gula7-ing), for example, is sometimes dated to the twelfth century, but the oldest"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150chapter 5complete manuscript is roughly a century younger.23Moreover, it is in theirnature that as legal codes were updated, different sections reflect differentperiods: some passages might be conservatively preserved, others cut fromwhole cloth, and still others based on older materials but modified here andthere in order to bring them up-to-date.24In general, the secular and ecclesi-astical law materials discussed in this chapter are arranged according to abroad typology that examines laws (a) composed before the late thirteenthcentury, (b) those from the late thirteenth century, and (c) those after circa1300.25Mindful of the important part played by reputation in witch trials inlater periods, it is perhaps not so surprising that the laws’ concerns aboutwitchcraft frequently arise in the context of slander; indeed, accusations ofwitchcraft and witchlike behavior are so tied to this concept that these charac-teristics are regularly mentioned in the section of the early secular laws thatdeal with actionable insults, so much so that one wonders whether imputa-tions involving such activity were not a steady source of friction in the com-munities.26In the Gula3ing laws of western Norway, for example,27witchcraft is explicitly mentioned among the words of gross insult for whichcompensation could be sought (fullre ́tti).28Similar provisions appearthroughout the Norwegian laws.29The defense for those who bring such acharge raises interesting questions: if through judicial torture—bearing hotiron for a man, plunging her hands into a boiling kettle for a woman—aperson accused of witchcraft is found innocent, then the accuser should beconsidered a slanderer. This judgment, however, can be averted if the accusercan defend himself with the fact that ‘‘this view is commonly held’’ (lit.,‘home verdict’).30Reputation clearly matters in this early period as much asit does in the later periods.The image of witchcraft in the Nordic world that precipitates out ofsuch laws is not always so clear-cut as this statute fromGula7ingslo\u0001g, however,and can sometimes be bewildering. Or how else do we approach a passagesuch as the following famous linesA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Older Law ofVa ̈stergo ̈tland) from the early thirteenth century?§5.

All these sins should first be discussed with thepriest and not flare up in rancorousness or rage. . . .31This passage comes from a part of the code that deals with various sortsof lawlessness and is immediately preceded by a parallel discussion of slandersagainst men, namely insults of various kinds and accusations of cowardice,homosexuality, bestiality, and incest.32Clearly these segments conjure in gen-dered terms the most despised and serious vices the medieval Nordic mindcould imagine, one of which, scholarship has inferred, says a great deal aboutwitchcraft in western Sweden in the thirteenth century.But what exactly is it saying? First of all, in discussing this form ofslander, the text provides a hypothetical case in which a person maligns awoman by claiming to have actually witnessed her engaged in a particularactivity.33There is no question here of the implied association with witchcraftbeing based on untestable evidence, such as secret pacts with the devil or thelike; rather, the claim rests on the affirmative assertion of having literallyseen the individual corporeally participating in conduct with certain culturalassociations. Second, the woman’s appearance and behavior are marked inthe extreme: she has been seen riding (reet‘rode’) a gate in the form of a‘‘troll’’ (i trols ham).34Both the time and place of her conduct are carefullyspecified, and both have important cultural connections: she is said to haveridden the gate at a liminal point in time, ‘‘when all was even [between]night and day’’ (7a alt var iamrift nat ok daghe ́r), either at the equinox or attwilight or at some combination of the two times.35Liminality is also the hallmark of the location where she engaged in thisapparently odious behavior: by its very nature and purpose, a gate representsa boundary between areas and therefore also a threshold from one domaininto the other. Gates and pen fences underscore the fact that the act hastaken place in the shadowlands between two areas, metaphorically perhapsalso two different worlds; in any event, that she is said to have been specifi-cally on a pen gate (a quiggrindu\u0003qui,f. ‘pen, fold’) would appear tosuggest, and recognize, other dichotomies familiar to modern audiences, suchas nature-culture and so on.36The most alluring phrase to our eyes is the one that says the woman hasbeen in the shape of a ‘‘troll.’’ As discussed earlier,troll‘a monstrous, evil-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152chapter 5disposed being, not belonging to the human race; a human being having thenature of a troll’ is a very productive element in compounds for practitionersof witchcraft—in Old Swedish,trolkarl,trolkona, andtrolka ̈rling, for exam-ple. Does this phrase then mean that the woman has an appearance theslanderer associates with witches or, more literally, that she has taken on amonstrous form?37Comparanda from throughout the Nordic world, as wellas later developments in it, all suggest that this scene is part of a nativetradition according to which witches were able to fly (see Chapter4).38Exam-ination of the later redaction of these laws,Yngre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen(The YoungerLaw of Va ̈stergo ̈tland;composition1281–1300, manuscripts from the four-teenth century) sheds further light on what is meant. Philological detailsaside, the utterance is, with one exception, the same. To the unkempt coiffureof the woman has now been added a further sign of her unwillingness toaccept social norms: she is not only loose-haired but alsolo ̈sgiur7‘loose-girdled’.39Taken together, the image of a ‘loose-haired’ and ‘loose-girdled’woman was one intended to portray a female willful and impertinent, per-haps sensuous as well.40Everything about the description, which, after all,comes by way of providing an example of an actionable slander, suggests thatwe are hearing how some thirteenth-century Swedes thought witches behaved(and how decent women did not), and very likely the accusation that followsabout being able to destroy a woman or cow is also part of the total witchcraftpackage.The bundling of slanders in the Old Swedish provincial laws offers in-valuable insights into how witchcraft was perceived:Gutalagen(The Law ofGotland) places witchcraft (forde7sciepr) together with such deeds as theft,murder, and whoredom.41The Bja ̈rko ̈Laws (Old Swedishbiærko ̈arætter; OldDanishbiærkeræt; Old Icelandic/Norwegianbiarkeyarre ́ttr), or municipallaws, known in Sweden from Lo ̈do ̈se in the west from circa1345, althoughbelieved to have originated in Stockholm in the previous century, are evenmore cosmopolitan in their treatment of accusations of witchcraft.42As withA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen, these laws begin by discussing actionable slanders againstmen—thief, murderer, liar, arsonist, ‘‘son of a bitch’’ (hwnzæmæ son), or theson of a thrall if he is a freeman’s son. The list of male insults also includesherriæns son, ‘son of Herjann’, it has been suggested, one of the many cog-nomina for the pagan god O ́1inn.43The law then continues with the slandersfor which a good woman, as this law specifies, may bring charges: whore,harlot, witch, or sorceress.44Although the earliest Icelandic law texts possess interesting information"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Law153on witchcraft, these passages fall in the church law section. What the secularIcelandic laws do not say is of equal interest.

Although we cannot be certain that we possess pre-cisely these resulting laws, it has generally been believed that the diversematerials that make up the Icelandic laws from the period of the common-wealth (which ends1262–64) are probably close to them.47These laws frombefore the unification with Norway were never codified in any normal senseand have been preserved in a variety of manuscripts, sometimes closely resem-bling one another, sometimes quite different. Collectively, the laws havecome to be known asGra ́ga ́s(lit., ‘Gray Goose’).48As we have seen, in the early Norwegian and Swedish secular laws, witch-craft typically comes up amid enumerations of slanders and the cases that canbe brought against rumormongers. Surprisingly then, especially given the linkbetween theGra ́ga ́smaterials and the Norwegian legal tradition, is the factthat in the sections on slander, witchcraft is not raised at all. Indeed, one canreadGra ́ga ́sand come away with the impression that women were neverslandered in early medieval Iceland—or if they were, it was of no great con-cern, for the lists of slanders is highly phallocentric. This apparent inatten-tiveness might be taken for just that and little more, but it plays into animportant point about the possible regional differences in conceptions ofwitchcraft and magic in medieval and early modern Scandinavia. In Iceland,as one important author notes, words are the tactile realization of magicalability, but the source of that power is knowledge, a relationship that helpsexplain why the typical early modern Icelandic witch was male: ‘‘Knowledgeor wisdom (fræ5i,fro ́5leikur) was associated with men, at least after the intro-duction of Christianity and the emergence of a new kind of literati orkenni-menn.’’49On the other hand, after the end of the Icelandic Commonwealth, theIcelandic legal system is consciously brought more in line with the Norwe-gian legal system, first with the much disliked laws calledJa ́rnsi5a(1271–81)and later with the long-lastingJo ́nsbo ́k(1281).50The writers ofJo ́nsbo ́kusedthe national laws of King Magnu ́s as their model, although the two codes areby no means identical everywhere. One senses this similarity immediately,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154chapter 5when lists of offenses drawing on the magical world are enumerated—witchcraft, soothsaying journeys, and sitting out to awaken trolls, by whichheathenism is promoted.51And the slander provisions in the two countriesnow closely resemble one another. In most of the several hundred manu-scripts ofJo ́nsbo ́k, no mention of magic or witchcraft is made in the sectionon slander; however, witchcraft is specified in four manuscripts, which list asactionable insults being called a traitor, a thief, a pilferer, a whore’s son, andso on, and being called afordæ5a‘witch’.52Perhaps more in keeping with thetradition ofGra ́ga ́sis the way slander is brought up obliquely inJo ́nsbo ́kinthe section on poetic composition, when the laws note the possibility ofbringing suit if one is said to be guilty of larceny or witchcraft (fordæ5uskap).53Especially noteworthy is the wording of the direct slanders, which makesclear that it is an insult to men to be called by these terms. Women are simplynot mentioned.54In a similar vein, the early secular laws from Denmark are relatively quieton questions of witchcraft:55surprisingly, the laws of Jutland of1241do nottake up the topic at all, although a century and a half later they will addressthe question in detail.56Conversely, the Scanian Municipal Laws of1328specify that if a man destroys (forgiør) a woman, or a woman a man, or awoman a woman through witchcraft or other sorcery, so that the person dies,a man should be sent to the wheel, a woman burned.57The termsfirigæra,fyrirgera,forgo ̈ra, and so on—‘destroying’ or ‘killing’—are generally associ-ated, as here, with witchcraft, a correlation frequently made in the Old Swed-ish provincial laws as well. ThusA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagenstates that if a womandoes in (firigær) a man, she can be declared an outlaw and killed.58The samelaw maintains that a woman may not be killed for any crime other thanwitchcraft (utæn firi trolskap).59One suspects that poisoning may be the spe-cific kind of witchcraft the law has in mind, as has been argued in detailby at least one scholar.60The interpretation generally fits well, especially asintoxicatores‘poisoners’ are sometimes collocated with witchcraft in sugges-tive ways in later texts.61Moreover, the possibility of poisoning is treated asa very real threat in the West Gautish tradition: a later addendum to the lawstells of King Ingi, who was killed by an evil drink in O ̈stergo ̈tland and diedfrom it, although there is no overt suggestion in this instance that witchcraftis involved.62It is also telling that in a late medieval Latin translation of the OldSwedish phraseme7trulldom ællæ andrum forgerningum‘by witchcraft orother means’,63a canon in Uppsala, Ragvald Ingemundsson, uses the phrase"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Law155veneno aut arte magica‘poisoning or magical arts’.64Undoubtedly, verbs suchasfirigæraand so on, as one famous scholar has said, are used to designate allsorts of injury that cannot be explained by obvious violence; witchcraft is oneof its forms, poisoning another.65Yngre Va ̈stgo ̈talagenimplies malice of justthis sort when it states that a woman taken in the act of ‘‘destroying cow orcattle, woman or man’’ forfeits her life.66This sense is strengthened by lawspredicated on constructions that specify, as in the case ofUpplandslagen(TheLaw of Uppland,1296), that if a woman gives a man something destructive,she should be placed in fetters and taken to the assembly, and with her thesame destructive articles, presumably witchcraft paraphernalia, clearly so thatthey can be used as evidence in the case.67What should not be overshadowed by the details of these early secularlaws, however, is the tendency for them, like the old Roman tradition, tosingle out for capital punishment only witchcraft that produced actual physi-cal harm.68By contrast, women who were merely guilty of superstitions, forexample, were fined inYngre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen.69That is not to say that thesecular laws were entirely practical about misfortune: obviously they too wereinfluenced by the ideology that shapes the church law sections concernedwith the maintenance of Christian probity and sometimes mimic the themesand language of the ecclesiastical laws.Just who controlled the writing of the laws was a matter of gravity: when,for example, in Norway the revisions of the individual provincial laws began,a process that eventually led to a national law, King Magnu ́s and ArchbishopJo ́n met in1269at the Fro\u0001stu3ing where the issue was resolved.70The deci-sion, ratified by the assembly, declared that the king might address all secularissues and those connected with the monarchy, but the clear implication isthat the Christian laws should be the under the archbishop’s jurisdiction.71Even so, among the criminals condemned to outlawry in the miscellaneousprovisions ofFro\u0001stu7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Fro\u0001stu7ing) are listed those who areguilty of murder, witchcraft, soothsaying-journeys, and sitting out at nightin order to awaken trolls and thereby promote heathendom, language thatwould be adopted in the IcelandicJa ́rnsi5aandJo ́nsbo ́k.72Much the samelanguage is found in the Norwegian municipal laws, which join to the crimesof soothsaying and sorcery the offense of sacrificing to heathen spirits (a ́hei5nar vættir) and say that all these acts are worthy of outlawry.73As the laws were amended, changes in the attitude toward witchcraftbecame apparent, all the more so as they were eventually worked into na-tional codes—first in Norway and then, after the end of the commonwealth,"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156chapter 5in Iceland, followed by Sweden.74The relatively benevolent tone calling foroutlawry for the practice of witchcraft, for example, began to shift. Anamended text of theGula7ingslo\u0001glists the familiar collocation of thosewomen charged with ‘‘using magic and witchcraft’’ (fara me5golldrum. e5ame5gerningum), who are still, as in previous codes, to be outlawed and driveninto exile if found guilty.75But the text goes on to say that if a woman isimputed with being a ‘troll-[woman]’ (i.e., witch) and a man-eater (En ef7ater cono kennt at hon se troll. oc manneta) and found guilty, she should betaken to the sea and hewn in the back (7a scal fo\u0001ra hana a sæ ut oc hoggua arygg). Several key points arise from this passage: first of all, if the editors’dating of the manuscript fragment to the late twelfth century is correct, thisphrase would be early testimony indeed to the idea of the anthropophagicwitch in the Nordic region. As a comparable phrase (Enn ef7æt er kent konoat hon se trolkona e5a manæta) is used in one of the later church laws,76onemight be tempted to dismiss the image of the ‘‘man-eater’’ as the result ofimported continental views, where the association of cannibalism and witch-craft had a long tradition (e.g., the sixth-century Salic laws; the penitentialsof Burchard of Worms).77Yet the Icelandic sagas know of the anthropophagicwitch,78and in native tradition there exist a wide array of ogreish Other-worldly creatures eager to eat humans.79Foreign and indigenous views onanthropophagic witches may have found in each other mutually supportiveparallels. But what is certainly the case—whether themannætais of foreignorigin or an indigenous character, or some combination of the two—is thatthe laws here envision both a special kind of crime and a different kind ofpunishment than had been the case in earlier codes.80Similarly, the secular portions of the earliest Swedish provincial law,A ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen, bring up witchcraft in the section dealing with bodilyinjury (7a ̈tta ̈a ̈r bardagha ̈) and again list the accusation of witchcraft amongother slanders that in toto comprise an overview of the society’s cardinalsins.81But still, that leaves the secular treatment of witchcraft inA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈ta-lagenas one that positions the topic among accidental ax blows, defaultedloans, and escaped slaves. How differently the topic appears to be handled acentury or so later in the national law code of circa1350,Magnus ErikssonsLandslag(Magnus Eriksson’s National Law). Witchcraft is taken up twice inthe section that deals with the most serious of crimes (Ho ̈ghma ̈lisbalker, lit.,‘high case section’): murder, infanticide, bigamy, poisoning stepchildren (forthe purpose of denying them their inheritance), rebellion, treason, arson.82"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Law157Clearly the attitude toward witchcraft, and the sort of threat it represents tosociety, was changing, as was the penalty: women found guilty of witchcraftare to be burned at the stake (some manuscripts call for them to be stoned),and men tortured and executed (stegla).An addendum to the Danish Jutlandic law from the later Middle Ages,usually dated circa1400, ‘‘Concerning Witchcraft,’’ rather blandly commentsthat if someone is charged with having killed an individual through witch-craft and denies the charge, certain rights of defense are available to him.83Of course, given the loss of so much material, including many medievaladministrative texts, during the great Copenhagen fire of1728, it is difficultto gauge how representative the extant legal codes are for the Danish MiddleAges, but it is often noted how infrequently witchcraft is mentioned in themedieval Danish laws, and when it is, the context often seems to be anenumeration of the rights of defense. In many ways, the projection of witch-craft and its legal situation in medieval Denmark stands apart from the sce-nario projected by the law codes of the other three Nordic polities. Theexplanation may be, as has been suggested, that Denmark was simply furtheralong in working out the relationship between secular law and canon law,and there was thus no reason to address witchcraft from an additional per-spective.84Magnus Erikssons Landslagwas reworked under King Kristoffer and con-firmed in1442and suggests further shifting attitudes in the late medievalperiod. For the most part, they reflect the attitudes toward, and even thewording about, witchcraft as found inMagnus Erikssons Landslag. They dis-cuss witchcraft in the context of homicide (VI.\u0003Forgo ̈r nokor androm methtrull doom) with the same penalties: burning at the stake for women andtorture and execution for men.85Of note, however, are the regulations aboutslander, whether involving a man or a woman, which have been alteredslightly in that the list of accusations has been expanded to include not onlythe usual array of thieves, whores, and whore’s sons but also a male witch(trulkarl) or a female witch (trulkonna) and equally, and explicitly, gender-inclusive murderers and heretics: thief, murderer, robber, heretic, whore’sson,86male witch, whore, female murderer, female heretic, or female witch(tiufuer,mordare,ro ̈fuare,kettare,horenszon,trulkarl,horkonna,moordherska,ketterska eller trulkonna).87Always condemned, the perception of witchcraftchanges palpably over time in the laws, increasingly in the later Middle Agesplaced in the various laws among the most serious and damning offenses."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158chapter 5Ecclesiastical RegulationsThe image of Nordic witchcraft that emerges from the normative documentslargely produced by and for the church is more suggestive, and more colorful,than the somewhat spare visage offered by the secular laws.88As we haveseen, the secular laws were primarily, although not exclusively, interested inwitchcraft and related topics in connection with homicide and the loss ofsocial harmony brought about by slanderous, and provably false, accusations.Medieval Christian ordinances in Scandinavia add to these practical concernstheir own deep suspicion of lingering pagan practice among the populace,fear of heretical beliefs of all sorts that might undermine the church’s author-ity, and, more fatefully, a suspended critical spirit with regard to the characterand effects of witchcraft.89A cautionary corrective may be in order at this juncture: the apparitionof a monolithic Roman Church dominates contemporary perceptions ofmedieval Christianity in the West, but realistically, no such phenomenonexisted in the Middle Ages. Considerable diversity existed within the churchitself, and especially in its various regional entities and bishoprics, and intheir relationships both with the larger church and with local authorities. Thetendency toward uniformity throughout an archbishopric and the regulariza-tion of national church statutes with canon law is one of the chief guidingprinciples one witnesses in the Nordic world.90Already by the mid-twelfth century, a metropolitan see was establishedin the Norwegian city of Ni1aro ́ss, and church laws with broad nationalapplication were developed, eventually leading to the volume calledGullfjo\u00015r(Gold Feather), which sought to bring Norwegian church rules in line withthe canon laws of Gratian’sDecretum.91With regard to governance, churchleaders found it necessary to negotiate with secular authorities over the extentof their influence, and while there are some general trends, it is important torecall that the situation differed from area to area, and from period to period.Thus, under the Norwegian king Magnu ́s Erlingsson, for example, thechurch achieved a degree of success concerning authority over the jurisdictionof church property and its clergy and the appointment of bishops. Thesechanges were denied to the church by King Sverrir Sigur1arson (1177–1202),who caused a stir by arguing for a return to the king’s leadership in importantchurch matters.

Indeed, one history of themedieval Nordic world consists of the intense power struggles that took placeover questions of ecclesiastical immunities and privileges, all the many wide-ranging negotiations necessary between the secular government, on the onehand, and a religion that saw in itself an institution both distinct from, andindependent of, that government, on the other.93And in medieval Scandina-via this potential for ecclesiastical particularism is apparent in the differingtreatments of witchcraft in the early church laws.Most of the provincial and national legal codes of Iceland, Norway, andSweden begin with so-called Christian or church laws (e.g.,kirkiu balker);the Danish situation stands apart, although they too have church laws, ofcourse.94The treatment of witchcraft in these statutes is highly variegated: inthe West Norse area—that is, in Iceland and Norway, whose legal systemswere historically intertwined by heritage and politics—witchcraft, sorcery,and magic play a major role in the Christian laws. By contrast, in East Scandi-navia, witchcraft and related topics have only a minor part in the Danishchurch laws, and none to speak of in the church laws of the earliest Swedishprovincial laws, appearing only after circa1300. Typical of the early churchlaws in the West Norse area is the passage fromGra ́ga ́sthat calls on citizensto trust in God and his saints and not to worship heathen spirits. It goes onto state that if one employs witchcraft, sorcery, or magic (galldra e7agørningar. e7a fiolky ́ngi), lesser outlawry is the sentence.95The law then care-fully specifies what it means by this sort of witchcraft (fiolkyngi): ‘‘if he saysit, or teaches it, or causes it to be said for himself or his property (alt.,livestock).’’ From the wording, the reference is apparently to a form of apo-tropaic charm magic, and thus the censure associated with it, motivated bybelief in superstition. The law further defines the typology in effect: if, bycontrast, one uses a harmful form of witchcraft (fordæs skap), then full out-lawry is called for. It is this kind of witchcraft, the law specifies, if throughone’s words or magic illness or death is visited on people or livestock. In bothcases, prosecution requires a twelve-man jury.96Following this discussion, thelaws spell out several forms of magic—for example, endowing stones with"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"160chapter 5power—the practice of which, because of the ‘‘superstition’’ (hindr vitni)involved, calls for the penalty of lesser outlawry. Set against the general aus-terity of the secular laws, with their emphasis on the tangible act of murderand on accusations of witchery that could be demonstrated to be false, it isnot difficult to see that there are fundamental differences between the ap-proaches the two different kinds of laws take to the subject of witchcraft, aperception that only increases the more one examines Icelandic, Norwegian,and, later, Swedish texts.Thus the church laws of theGula7ingslo\u0001gdedicate an entire section toquestions of witchcraft and soothsaying:The next is this, that we must pay no heed to soothsaying, incanta-tion, or wicked sorcery. And if a man is accused and convicted ofhaving practiced soothsaying or having told fortunes, he shall be anoutlaw and shorn of all personal rights; and all his chattels to thelast penny shall go, one-half to the king and one-half to the bishop.And if any man gives heed to soothsaying and the charge is proven,he shall owe a fine of forty marks, one-half to go to the king andone-half to the bishop. And if a man practices sorcery and witch-craft, and he is accused and convicted of it, he shall depart from theking’s dominions, for men must give no heed to such doings. Butwhosoever does pay heed [to such things] has forfeited his chattelsto the last penny; and his [only] choice shall be to go to confessionand do pennance. If the bishop or his deputy accuses a man ofpracticing soothsaying or sorcery or witchcraft and he denies thecharge, a method of defense has been provided.

And her heir shall convey her out of the king’sdominion.97The sections that immediately follow this one—addressing heathen sacri-fice and bestiality—underscore the moral outrage with which the churchregarded these depraved errors. And in this passage, the enumerated penaltiesmake clear that to engage in any act of witchcraft, whether as the performer,or even as the beneficiary, was regarded as sinful behavior. For consumers ofthis kind of magic, the penalties are severe: fines for listening to propheciesand the loss of property and penance for anyone paying heed to the otherforms of witchcraft mentioned.But agency carries a much higher penalty: outlawry and the loss of rightsand property for fortune-telling and exile for the one who practices witchcraftand sorcery (sa annarr er ferr me5galldra oc gerningar). Of particular note toois the slight but significant gendered difference in the nature of proving one’sinnocence: if a man is accused of engaging in soothsaying (er7at kent at hannfare me5spa ́r), he must prove he has not done it by a sixfold oath, whereas ifwomen are imputed with practicing witchcraft and sorcery (En ef7at erkonom kent at7ær fare me5golldrum oc gerningum), she must prove by herexisting reputation among good women that sheknowsno witchcraft or sor-cery (7ær scolo vitni bera at hon kann eigi galldra ne gerningar). In other words,unlike an accused male, the threshold of innocence for a woman is not merelythat she is not responsible for a specific deed, but rather that her reputationis such that she is regarded by her peers as being incapable of doing it. Per-haps the same reliance on reputation is envisioned in the case of a mancharged with witchcraft, but the language of the law suggests there is a differ-ence based on gender in the way the cases are adjudicated.98Borgar7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Borgar7ing) the early laws from the Oslofjordarea, offer impressive insights into the nature of witchcraft practices in thecenturies following the conversion to Christianity—or at least what churchauthorities thought these practices were.99The felonies (ubota værklit., ‘deedswhich cannot be atoned for with money’) it cites provide a veritable catalogueof the forms witchcraft-related crimes could take. First, the law declared it afelony to ‘‘sit out,’’ a ritual connected with the practice of witchcraft.100Thenthe law forbade prophecy in the specific form of making ‘‘Finn-trips,’’ orjourneys to Finnmark, in order to consult with the Sa ́mi about the future.101It assessed a three-mark fine for a woman who might bite off a finger or toefrom her child in order to secure longevity.102The same fine was to be leveled"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162chapter 5for rearing a child as a heathen.103It then stated that ‘‘the worst (female)witch’’ is the one who destroys ‘‘cow or calf, woman or child’’ (‘‘Su erfordæ1a uærst er firer gerer ku e1a kalve kono e1a barne’’).104And it notedthat it is witchcraft (fordæ5o skapr) if human hair or nails or frog’s feet orother things usually reckoned as sorcery (till gærninga) are discovered in bedor bolster.105Significantly, the law goes on to discuss a woman who is chargedwith ‘‘witchery’’ (trylzka)—she should have six women testify on her behalfthat she is not a witch. Again, it is a communal judgment about a woman’sreputation rendered by other women that counts, not a defense of her specificbehavior at a particular time and place.106The section closes by noting thatmen ought to believe in God, not in imprecations and idolatry (æigi a boluane5a a blot skapp), but if someone engages in heathen sacrifice, as is forbiddenin canon law, then he should pay a fine of three marks.107This entire section of the law is also found in various places in subse-quent iterations of theBorgar7ingslo\u0001gas well as in theFro\u0001stu7ingslo\u0001g.108Mod-est modifications aside—for example, instead of the ‘‘worst witch’’ being shewho destroys cows or calves, women orchildren, the other laws generallyhave the somewhat less frightening (and more gender- and generationallyequitable) phrase ‘‘woman orman’’—the key difference is that each of theother versions amplifies the expression ‘‘sit out’’ by noting that one sits outand thereby ‘‘awakens (the) troll(s).’’109Indeed, the concatenation of ele-ments witnessed here—sitting out to awaken troll(s), sorcery, prophecy, thepromotion of paganism, and so on—are often found bundled in the Norwe-gian laws, whether secular or church laws.110And as noted earlier, eventhough most of our direct evidence comes from the thirteenth century andlater, the laws themselves suggest that they are older. In line with many ofthe rules we have seen thus far, for example, theFro\u0001stu7ingslo\u0001g. mandate theuse of ordeals for charges connected to paganism, prophecy, and witchcraft:If a man sacrifices to heathen gods or practices sooth-saying or sor-cery, or if a man gives credence to such a one or harbors him forsuch purposes, he shall be outlawed like a banesman and the bishopshall have his property to the last penny. If he denies [the guilt], lethim carry the hot iron, or, [if a woman], let her go to the hot kettles.And the one who accuses any man of this [and the man is cleared],shall be rated a slanderer, if witnesses are called to take note of it,unless he can produce witnesses to common rumor.111"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Law163Despite the relatively late date of the manuscript, judicial torture (Latinordalium; Old Norseskı ́rsl) was abolished in Norway, as in the other Nordiccountries, with the visit of the papal legate, Cardinal William of Sabina, in1247, so this passage is widely held to be traceable back much further thanthe earliest manuscript fragments.A similar situation obtains for many of the Norwegian church laws: theorigins of theEi5siva7ingslo\u0001gfrom the Oppland area are confidently placedby some to the twelfth century but are known only in manuscripts from thelater centuries.112These laws display deep concern with the realm of magic,as they forbid anyone from having in their home a wand or heathen altar,charm materials or poppet, or anything considered part of pagan practices.113Similar prohibitions are repeated later in the same church laws, but to theseproscriptions against belief in witchcraft, charms, idolatry, and other heathencustoms is added belief in ‘‘Finns’’ and traveling to the ‘‘Finns,’’ that is, thecommon notion of seeking soothsaying among the Sa ́mi.114And, thesechurch laws from the Ei1siva3ing say that a woman charged with ‘‘riding’’ aman or one of his servants may defend herself by swearing an oath.115According to the Icelandic annals, in the year1267the revisions of theGula3ing laws undertaken at the behest of King Magnu ́sHa ́konarson, knownas ‘‘law mender’’ (lagabætir), were accepted, although the extant manuscriptsdate from the early1300s.116If anything, the allusions to witchcraft and magicappear to grow both more frequent and more lurid in this modernized text.The law explains that people are obliged to believe in ‘‘that faith we havepledged to God’’ and that the king and the bishop must with great careensure that people are not engaging in a powerful heresy or in heathen be-liefs.117These falsehoods include such things as charms (galdrar), witchcraft(gerningar), transvection (trollri5u), prophecy (spadomar), and belief in spiritsinhabiting the land, howes, and waterfalls.118Also included in the enumera-tion of these false ways is the practice of sitting out in order to be informedabout the future and searching for treasure or otherwise becoming knowl-edgeable, as well as attempting to awaken ghosts (draugha) or cairn-dwellers(haughbua).119Shortly after the revision of the Gula3ing Christian laws, probably in theyears1269–73, a Norwegian church law meant to have national authority wascomposed, described by its early editors as essentially a compilation of thechurch laws of the Gula3ing and the Fro\u0001stu3ing.120Through a misreadingof the first item in the main manuscript—a codex attributed to4orgeirrHa ́konarson, a scribe from the reign of King Eirı ́kr Magnu ́sson (1280–99)—"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164chapter 5these church laws have mistakenly come to be connected with the name ofKing Sverrir, hence the titleKong Sverrers Christenret(King Sverrir’s ChristianLaw).121It carries over much fromGula7ingslo\u0001gconcerning witchcraft andsoothsaying,122as well as the Gula3ing reference to the anthropophagicwitch.123It also forbids, as does one of the later supplemental laws toGu-la7ingslo\u0001g, the raising of a special pole for charm purposes.124Specifically, itforbids idolatry and sacrifice to heathen spirits, to heathen gods, to cairns,and to mounds. Following this impressively complete list, the law demandsthe loss of property, the obligation to confess and atone with Christ (orfailing that, exile) for anyone who ‘‘raises a pole and calls it a scald-pole’’(ræisir stong oc kallar skaldzstong).125For their part, the Iceland law codes offer intriguing insights into howwitchcraft was understood and treated. One text of much-debated age lists inone section several powerful items connected with witchcraft, such as a manor a woman performingsei5ror ‘‘raising’’ trolls to ride men or livestock.126In another section, it provides an augmented list of such activities, includingpursuing prophecy through witchcraft or sorcery, awakening trolls or spirits,or committing any other sort of heresy that is opposed to God and theChristian faith.127Whereas this part of the law declares the evildoer a hereticand sentences him to be outlawed, the first section cited calls for the con-demned to be taken out to sea and drowned.128After such evocative glimpses into the world of witchcraft in the WestNorse region, the church materials from the East Norse area in the earlyperiods seem thin gruel by comparison. The Danish church laws, presumablyamong the oldest we have, are more like the secular laws in the early periods,as they tend to raise matters of witchcraft mainly in the context of homicide.Both the Sealandic Church Law and the Scanian Church Law mention, moreor less in passing, the possibility of a man or a woman acquiring a reputationfor witchcraft or sorcery (trulldom æller fordæ7er), but even there the refer-ences seem like afterthoughts on the heels of discussing homicide and arecited in order to provide examples of defense through oaths and ordeal.129With a few exceptions from the late medieval period, these brief glimpses areabout all that comes from the medieval church laws in Denmark, whichstand apart from the trend in the rest of Scandinavia.Perhaps surprisingly, in the earliest periods the Swedish church laws arelargely silent as well: the Christian sections ofA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagenandYngreVa ̈stgo ̈talagenaddress witchcraft not at all. WhenUpplandslagenwas ratifiedin1296, it became a model for a number of subsequent legal codes in Sweden."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Law165Its church section,kirkiu balker, is again relatively quiet with regard to witch-craft, commenting only on individuals who believe in superstitions (ællr mæ7wi7ær skipi farit).130Passing references of this sort are typical, as when thekirkiu balkerofO ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Law of O ̈stergo ̈tland; manuscript from themid-1300s), lists witchcraft among a series of crimes for which a certain typeof oath may be used in defense.131More revealing is the paragraph in the church section ofDalalagen(TheLaw of Dalarna) devoted to female witches—significantly, tucked betweenpassages on bestiality and infanticide.132Like the NorwegianBorgar7ingslo\u0001g,the Dala church laws enumerate some of the materials a witch might beexpected to have in her possession, although it is unclear whether the lawenvisions a witch caught in the act of using these items or simply has inher possession ‘‘horn and hair, quick and dead, that may well be termedwitchcraft....’’133The phrases used here—horn oc haar quict oc do ̈t—correspond to, and presumably help elucidate, the parallel passages in otherOld Swedish laws that call for incriminating witchcraft materials to accom-pany an accused witch to the assembly (e.g., ‘‘ok3e samu forgiærningærmæ3hænni’’).134Given the context of the phrase and the wide, nearly univer-sal, use of both hair and nail clippings in sympathetic or, more narrowly,contagious magic,hornhas generally been understood as referring to nailclippings. The idea that the charm ingredients consist of both living and deadis again best understood against the backdrop of magic beliefs documentedelsewhere.Charm magic demands all sorts of materials—and here the ‘‘Eye of newtand toe of frog, / Wool of bat and tongue of dog’’ aspect of witchcraft ishighly relevant—and, as discussed earlier, Nordic evidence suggests that ev-erything from peas to cat brains to human effluvia could figure into theformulae. For the practitioner, the omnibus character of the ingredientsmeant that they were easily available, but the same thing was true for thoseinterested in proving witchcraft: almost anything found in the average house-hold could be fitted to such a scheme, living or dead, whether wildlife, do-mestic animal, herbs, virtually any article. The sentence for a womanconvicted of witchcraft and unable to pay a heavy fine—wari stens mattit ocstranda‘let her be meat for stones and strand’—has occasioned much debate,although the sense of it would seem to be that she should be taken to theshore and stoned to death.135Both the manner of execution and the apparentdereliction of the corpse are intended to underscore the severity of the crime(for poor women, at any rate)."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166chapter 5What is generally referred to asSma ̊landslagen(The Law of Sma ̊land), ofwhich only the church law section has been preserved, has language similartoDalalagen.136Among the principal moral outrages that it claims should beadjudicated by the bishop are the murder of an unbaptized child, incest, andwitchcraft. This rule is to apply to witchcraft (trolldomber), the law continues,whether the individual is taken ‘‘within yard and gate, with horn and hair,’’terms that naturally bring to mind the corresponding nail and hair phrase ofDalalagen.137In addition, of course, the use here ofgrind‘gate’, perhaps alsogar7er, in the context of witchcraft reminds one ofA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagenandits peculiar image of the gate-mounted witch.138Under the auspices of the metropolitan see in Ni1aro ́ss, which, in addi-tion to the bishoprics in Bergen, Stavanger, Oslo, and Hamar had authorityover suffragan bishops in various locations throughout Norway’s Atlanticempire, including Gar1ar in Greenland, Ska ́lholt and Ho ́lar in Iceland, Kirk-jubøur in the Faroe Islands, and Kirkwall for the Orkneys and Shetland, anumber of statutes were declared by the provincial councils, which met onan irregular basis.

Now, however, the collocation acquires formal legalstatus, when in about1347a new statute is promulgated under Pa ́ll’s succes-sor, Archbishop A ́rni Einarsson; it now includes runes among the many sinsassociated with witchcraft and magic. Indeed, its list of activities to avoidhas expanded to include not only runes, but witchcraft and sorcery, herbs,superstitions, and any other creed not taught by the church.145To do other-wise is to be a cursed heretic.146Synodal statutes in the East Norse area are, at about this same point (i.e.,mid-fourteenth century), relatively silent on this issue but in time also expandthe range of witchcraft associations, albeit not in exactly the same directionas the West Norse area. On the other hand, the oldest Swedish penitentialmaterials, from Skara in Va ̈stergo ̈tland (manuscript from ca.1335), do noteven raise the topic of witchcraft, a situation that might be explained, as oneexpert has suggested, by the fact that the provincial laws were believed tohave already adequately provided for it.147A document from the diocese ofStra ̈ngna ̈s from the mid-1300s, however, now listsveneficia‘poisoning; magic,sorcery’ andsortilegia‘soothsaying, prophecy’ among such great sins as homi-cide and sacrilege.148Indeed, exclusion from communion for witchcraft-related peccancies becomes routine in Swedish church law, as ever moredetailed lists of such sinners indicate what late medieval church authoritiesin Sweden deemed constituted witchcraft and associated crimes.A number of these items are attributed to Nils Hermansson (also knownas Nicolaus Hermani), canon of Uppsala cathedral from1350, archdeacon inLinko ̈ping from1360and bishop of Linko ̈ping from1374to his death in1391,although probably best known to posterity for his important connections toSaint Birgitta.149Before these appointments, he had studied theology in Parisand canon law in Orle ́ans. In what is apparently the earliest of the ordinancespromulgated by him, he condemns poisoners, murderers, church thieves,witches (incantatrices), and anyone who summons demons.150In another listof those forbidden to take communion, usurers are classed together with‘workers of magic’, enchanters, and enchantresses.151Building on this view of witchcraft are passages from a number of fif-teenth-century Swedish penitentials: some reflect the combination of pre-viously mentioned magic and demon-invocation, sometimes augmenting thelist with a reference to the use of auguries. Like the West Norse codes, thesepenitentials also forbid belief in the efficacy of such methods: a penance ofseven years is called for in all these cases.152Often these texts, as already theearlier Swedish materials suggest, touch on concerns more akin to a learned"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"168chapter 5court’s view of the magical world than the charmingly homey, if all too brief,mentions of herbs and runes in the Norwegian statutes. Despite possiblebroad prototypes, there are no known direct foreign antecedents and thuslittle reason to believe other than that the information reflects Swedish condi-tions, as Bengt Ankarloo has noted.153The central concerns of these texts, which date from a church meetingin Arboga in1412, are prophecy; incantations; soothsaying; the interpretationof dreams; writing with characters and words not found in sacred texts, whichsome superstitious people believe to be potent against fire, water, sword,disease, and other threats; all writing on lead meant as a defense againsttoothache, fevers, and all manner of diseases of men and beast; all meansused to discover stolen goods that have been hidden; and the observationof so-called Egyptian Days (a calendric system for divining fortunate andunfortunate days).154The late fifteenth century also provides several very interesting itemsfrom Denmark: in a statute titled simply ‘‘Concerning Magic,’’ priests andother clerics are forbidden from engaging in any sort of magic, since suchthings are always part of the devil’s secret administration.155And from thesame period, parish priests are warned to keep the Eucharist and holy oilunderproperlocksbecauseofthepotentialharmfrombothmagicand‘‘threatening dangers.’’156The latter decree apparently has older roots: verysimilar rules were articulated in a statute from Stra ̈ngna ̈s in Sweden, datedby one authority to the mid-1300s, cautioning priests to protect the holywater fonts against magic and impurities.157In the cases calling for protectionof holy water, holy oil, and the Eucharist, priests are surely being warned toensure that the articles are not stolen in order to be used in various charms,as this was a common concern.Prosecuting Witchcraft and Related CrimesProscriptive cultural monuments such as legal statutes are inherently hypo-thetical and how much we can learn from them suspect—unless, of course,there exist actual cases from which to form judgments. And what do we knowabout those brought to trial for witchcraft or related activities in the Nordicworld in the centuries before the Reformation?158Given the data set, even ifevery case can be successfully identified, it is difficult to imagine, due to thesmall number of trials, anything like the subtle and meaningful statistical"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Law169readings a number of scholars have managed to tease out of the early modernperiod for the various national situations.159After all, it might be argued thatour data consists entirely of what statisticians would regard as ‘‘outliers,’’cases that fall outside the norm and thus skew our impressions.Conversely, however representative—or not—the cases are, they canprovide important profiles of witchcraft-related crimes in the Nordic world.Looking at the incidents as a group, several parallel and telling patterns areclear. On the one hand, the precipitating crisis in cases where a female ischarged tends to involve sexuality; when the women are charged, the accusa-tion generally includes witchcraft and its associated activities, especially aph-rodisiac and anaphrodisiac charms; and the women are nearly always eitheracquitted or lightly sentenced. In the cases involving male defendants, on theother hand, the charge is routinely apostasy and devil worship, with addi-tional accusations of theft (often from churches) being commonplace, andin every case where we know the court’s disposition the sentence is capitalpunishment.160Strictly speaking, these two groups have little in common, asthe specific charges tend to differ. Despite this distinction, indeed, largelybecause of it, the comparison of these two groups creates the chance to under-stand the question of gender in Nordic witchcraft cases.In addition to the relatively well-documented cases discussed in detaillater, there are indications of other trials and persecutions as well. In1080,for example, Pope Gregory VII urges the king of Denmark not to hold cer-tain women accountable for life’s misfortunes; there can be little doubt thatthe pope is referring to female witches.161And a famous European case in-volving a key Nordic figure shows that in elite circles accusations of witchcraftcould be a potent political tool as well: the history of the marriage in1193ofIngeborg of Denmark to King Philipp II Augustus of France is well docu-mented, suggestive, and, to say the least, bizarre.162In brief, King Philippclaims that he has been bewitched by his new Danish queen on their weddingnight, a story repeated by some contemporary chroniclers.163Despite thevolume of material relating to this case, whether the cause is personal distresson the king’s part (brought about by impotence, as many have believed),or is part of some political stratagem (as has also been suggested), or somecombination of the two (as seems plausible) remains unresolved.So, although we can suppose there were other instances, the first docu-mented case of witchcraft to take place in the Nordic world comes from theNorwegian city of Bergen in the winter of1325, when Bishop Au1finnr re-ports having a problem.164How was he to respond to growing rumors about"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"170chapter 5the behavior of a certain Ragnhildr, who, it was reliably and widely reported,had renounced God, fallen into heretical beliefs, and used magic in an at-tempt to preserve her adulterous and incestuous relationship with her cousinBa ́r1r?

Bishop Au1finnrconcludes that Ragnhildr’s crimes center on her use of a charm and the heresythereby involved, as well as on her attempts to destroy Ba ́r1r’s marriage toBergljo ́t.

Due to thesefactors, he will soften his judgment, as his fellow clerics have urged, citingthe admonition from Ezekiel18:23. Assured by her oath that she will abandonsuch activities, the bishop orders her to observe a set of fasts (several a week)for the rest of her life and to go on a seven-year pilgrimage to visit holy sitesoutside of Norway. If Ragnhildr fails in any respect, she is to be regarded ashaving relapsed in heresy and turned over to the secular courts.As explored earlier in relation to the myth of the diabolical pact, theburning of a nun from Kirkjubær in Iceland in1343, although largely unno-ticed in witchcraft literature, is of particular significance. According to threeof the Icelandic annal traditions, all belonging to what Gustav Storm andothers have viewed as the middle group, that is, those written at the end ofthe1300s, a nun at Kirkjubær was burned to death by order of the bishop,Jo ́n Sigur1arson.165The three entries differ slightly as to the nature of hercrime. According toLo\u0001gmannsanna ́ll(The Lawyer’s Annal), she was guilty ofdefaming the pope.Ska ́lholtsanna ́ll(The Ska ́lholt Annal) claims that she hadin writing given herself to the devil (er gefiz haf5i pukanum me5brefi), andFlateyjaranna ́ll(The Flatey Annal) enumerates three interrelated sins: the nunhad given herself in writing to the devil, she had mistreated the body ofChrist by throwing it into the privy, and she had had intercourse with manylaymen.Also preserved in the Icelandic annals, and as grim as the previous in-stance, is a sentence meted out in the Norse colony in Greenland in the earlyfifteenth century. According toLo\u0001gmannsanna ́ll: ‘‘In this same year [1407]aman in Greenland named Kolgrı ́mr was burned because he had lain with acertain man’s woman named Steinunn, the daughter of Hrafn the Lawman,who died in the avalanche north in Lo\u0001nguhli1. At that time,4orgrı ́mr So\u0001lva-son had her to wife. That man got her will with the black arts, and was laterburned after the judgement. The woman was never the same again and dieda little later.’’166One scholar has suggested that in addition to a finding implying the useof witchcraft, the sentence ‘‘probably was a face-saving device for a high-bornIcelander whose wife had succumbed to the charms of a social inferior.’’167Steinunn’s demise, and Kolgrı ́mr’s execution, have been much discussed overthe years, but with respect to understanding Nordic witchcraft, the key issuesin this curious case are threefold: the proposition that Kolgrı ́mr used somesort of ‘‘love magic’’ to bend Steinunn to his will; the fact that a number of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"172chapter 5people appear to accept its efficacy, even if the reason is to save face; and theuse of the term ‘‘black arts’’ to describe the charms Kolgrı ́mr presumablyemploys. This fixed phrase might be explained by the secret nature of itspractice or the widespread image of the devil as a black man, but it was bythis time well-attested in religious literature in the Nordic world.168Thewording of the passage invites speculation: for example, a reading of ‘‘pursu-ant to the sentence’’ (i.e.,eptir do ́mi, with the dative) might be more sensible,and even expected, here, but the phrase ‘‘eptirdom’’ (i.e., with the accusative)demands ‘following the judgment’. This temporal sense may strike a readeras oddly out of place unless, as one might reasonably suspect, the point beingmade is that Kolgrı ́mr was spared vigilante justice—after all, his ‘‘victim’’ isthe daughter of a lawman and the wife of a prominent man—and given aproper trial.169In1471, a Danish case combining church theft and the hording of thecommunion host, presumably for use in witchcraft just as the ecclesiasticalregulations warn against, takes place. Not only is the man said to have beenburned alive, but his hands are cut off in advance of this horrible death.170Inthat same year, a familiar instance of witchcraft takes place in the Swedishtown of Arboga involving a woman who seems to be the stereotypical village‘‘wise woman’’ or witch. On November18of that year, Birgitta Andersdotterappears before the court and says that a woman she calls ‘‘Crazy Katherine’’(galna kadhrin) had suggested using a cat’s head and an ox horn filled withwater as part of a complicated charm in which a certain man would abandonone woman and love Birgitta instead. Birgitta provides these materials and isadvised to take the horn and throw it and its contents against the man’s door.Several men (one of whom is presumably her father) step forward and prom-ise on her behalf that she will never again be found in possession of anywitchcraft (forgerningha) and that she will never disturb the marriage withany witchcraft (medh nokra forgerningha).171Although Crazy Katherine wassupposed to appear before the court as well, she did not.172Of great interestis an earlier case in August, in which a ‘‘Wise Katherine’’ is brought to thecourts for the theft of a silver spoon.173Importantly, the November entry forgalna kadhrinwas originally written as ‘‘Wise Katherine’’ (visa kadhrin), butthe word has been struck through and ‘‘crazy’’ written in above it. Either weare dealing with two Katherines with opposite cognomina as a means ofkeeping the two apart, or perhaps we witness here an ongoing reevaluationof just what kind of person Katherine represented to the community overtime.174"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Law173Another Swedish trial, also concerned with sex, takes place in1490inStockholm. A woman named Margit is accused of having made a man impo-tent years earlier. She is further charged with having learned this witchcraft(then trolldomen) from a woman variously referred to as ‘‘Anna the singer’’(Anna singerska) and ‘‘Anna the Finn’’ (Anna finszka).175It is supposedly thisAnna who had administered, as we must assume it to be meant, to HansMille in some fashion cat brain, apparently, as in the case of Crazy Katherine,part of the charm. Margit admits that she not been shriven in five years, therelevance of which may largely have to do with assessments of her char-acter.176Against these images of so-called love magic in action, the late fifteenth-century records also reveal more tenebrific cases, such as that of a certain Jensin Stockholm in1478, who, according to a witness, addressed an image ofthe crucifix (presumably hanging upside down), saying, ‘‘I have long servedyou; now I renounce you and serve the devil.’’177Other cases from the late1400s in Stockholm are laced with the familiar sound of apostasy. In1484–85,two men are accused of having stolen from various churches on numerousoccasions, but one of them—to whom the cognomen ‘‘O ́1inn’s man’’ (Odin-skarl) is attached—confesses that ‘‘he has served O ́1inn for seven years.’’178In1492, a servant named Erik Claueson is sentenced to death for apostasyand other crimes. He is said to have recanted his confession of renouncingGod and all his holy company, traveling withershins on nine Thursday nightsin the churchyard and accepting the devil O ́1inn for the sake of money.179He is also guilty of having stolen both money and silver, for which crime heis sentenced ‘‘to the fire,’’ but because of his apostasy, Erik is to undergotorture, the wheel, and the rope.180ConclusionLaws are the ultimate normative documents, in that they dictate the parame-ters outside of which people will be prosecuted in real-world social experi-ences, while at the same time they are also philosophical statements aboutthe nature of society. Paradoxically, the actual cases history has bequeathed usare typically fragmentary and frustratingly incomplete, jagged, with curiousdetails, yet generally lacking larger social contexts.

Given the predominance of women among the accused, it issurprising that generations of talented scholars generally ignored the gen-dered character of the early modern witch-hunts.1In fact, Scandinavianscholars were among the very first to ask the obvious: Why women?2Inrecent decades, the early modern witch-hunts as a war on women has becomea standard component of scholarly discussions, and a series of analyses hasshown how fruitful a fundamentally gendered approach to the topic can be.3Certainly, these gender-focused strategies have transformed our understand-ing of the past, not merely by recognizing the place of women in it, but byappreciating the significance of the construction of male and female roles andthe processes societies use to perpetuate their perceptions of these relations.The question of gender and witchcraft in the pre-Reformation north,especially for the period up to the Conversion, has attracted considerableattention in recent years.4Thus, for example, in her careful examination ofthe various Norse literary sources (e.g., heroic poetry, sagas), Jenny Jochenstraces the development of the witch figure as one of four conventional femalestereotypes among the Germanic peoples. In line with the earlier work ofFogelklou Norlind, Jochens interprets the seeresses and sorceresses of Icelan-dic literature as reflecting a social reality, one in which there was a gradualdisplacement under Christianity of female practitioners by males: ‘‘Womenwere the original and remained the most powerful magicians, whereas mengained access only later and never attained parity with women, either in"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"176chapter 6numbers or power.’’5Indeed, Jochens argues that the entire range of activitiesassociated with wisdom—ritual magic, divination, and so on—had once beendominated by women.The conclusions reached by a number of scholars about women’s rolesin magic often rely on their confidence in Iceland as a repository of pre-Christian views.6Understandably, they hope to push our knowledge fromthe period of saga writing into the Viking Age (ca.800–1100). Against thisview, one might set the recent conclusions of archaeologists who, althoughdiffering from each other on many points, consider the role of gender (asopposed to biological sex) in the magico-religious, and martial, worlds of theViking Age and reach different conclusions.7The cultural moment of thisstudy, of course, differs in that it explores witchcraft in the centuries after theconversion of Scandinavia to Christianity; moreover, it examines witchcraftin a pan-Nordic context, one that certainly includes the important informa-tion to be gleaned from the Icelandic sagas, but also looks for answers innon-Icelandic and nonnarrative resources. What, then, can we say about latemedieval Nordic magic, witchcraft, and sorcery in the context of gender?Saints, Sinners, and the ‘‘Evil Woman’’A proverb well attested in late medieval Denmark and Sweden runs, ‘‘An evilwoman is the devil’s door nail’’ (ondh quinna ær diæwlsins dura naghil).8Oneof the many questions that curious expression brings to mind is just whatwould have been meant by the expression ‘‘an evil woman’’, a phrase fraughtwith meaning for how we understand ‘‘witch’’ and other gender-related ques-tions in medieval Scandinavia. Although the place of women in the NordicMiddle Ages has been the subject of much attention in recent years,9scholarlyfocus has tended to center on literary images, with their sometimes real,sometimes stereotyped roles (e.g., mothers, valkyries, ‘‘inciters’’).10To under-stand the mentality that gave rise to how the ‘‘evil woman’’ was conceived,we need to look at the entire spectrum of possibilities and recognize that thetheme of evil women, especially evil women whose behavior corrupts menand challenges male society, features prominently in that world.11To be sure, saga literature provides us with more than a few examples ofsuch women. One need only think in passing of such strong and difficultfemale types as Freydı ́sinEirı ́ks saga rau5a(The Saga of Eirı ́kr the Red),"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Gender177Hallger1rinBrennu-Nja ́ls saga(Njal’s saga), and Queen Gunnhildr in a vari-ety of texts to envision such characters.12So malevolent is Gunnhildr’s behav-ior that she has been labeled by one scholar as the prototypical ‘‘DestructivePrima Donna.’’13But these are, after all, ‘‘only’’ figures from Icelandic literarysources, and the extent to which late medieval nonelites elsewhere in Scandi-navia would have known about them is uncertain. In addition to such stereo-types and other literary cutouts, occasional historical figures emerge from ourmaterials who might likewise be considered—especially by male observers—‘‘evil women,’’ in particular women who subvert dominant power relation-ships.Ragnhildr tregaga ́s from fourteenth-century Bergen springs to mind asan example of a woman accused of using charms to work her will and who isin any event our best historical image of someone using magic in medievalScandinavia.14We only learn about her when her activities become notoriousin town, and if there is one constant in modern witchcraft research, it mustsurely be that judicial action tends to be the culmination of a lifetime ofhaving been a troublesome presence, an evil woman in the community, ratherthan because of some unique event.15Reliable, nonliterary evidence is obvi-ously hard to come by, but we are occasionally allowed the furtive glimpseinto such lives in the late medieval period.The records of the Swedish town of Arboga provide one such possibility,where one witnesses activities of the following sort as they unfold over aperiod of years. In June1466, witnesses testify that they heard Ælseby, PerHaraldsson’s wife, call Laurits Ha ̊konsson a wretch (skalk), the son of a whore(een horinson), and a ‘‘pillory-bird’’ (kaakslagere, i.e., someone subjected topunishment in the pillory).16Three years later, a witness swears that he hasheard Ingeborg of Helle say to Ælseby that she is a tramp (landløpirska) whowishes her husband dead.17On March5,1470, a witness testifies that thesame Ingeborg came running into the home of Per Haraldsson and beggedhim to control his wife, Ælseby, who was going to hit her mother. At thatpoint, Ælseby arrives and confronts the other woman in the doorway. Shebegins to hit Ingeborg, who responds by knocking Ælseby down.18Althougha more complete knowledge of Ælseby’s situation than that which can beinferred from these documents might exonerate her in our eyes, as seen byher contemporaries at least, what precipitates out of officialdom’s logs clearlysays that she represents a disruptive force in the Arboga community.

In this context,we might consider a related set of artworks from the Swedish fourteenthcentury. Both are pieces of decorative ironwork from churches in Go ̈taland,widely attributed to the same artisan (or his school) and to a period in thelate1300s.22In one instance, that of a large chest from Rydaholm church, hasa scene of Eve in the Garden of Eden being tempted by the serpent to eatthe fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The serpent ispresented in a monstrous, even dragonlike form, and Adam is notably ab-sent—the scene clearly represents the temptation of Eve, leading to the Fallof Man. Although Nordic representations of the Fall often include bothAdam and rather less demonic images of the serpent (e.g., Tingsted church),the meaning of these images, as in so many others in the Middle Ages, isabundantly clear: it is, as Tertullian wrote already in the third century,through a woman that humanity experienced the Fall—the absence of Adamin this work inevitably focuses the onlooker’s gaze on Eve’s culpability. Andit is worth noting too, that this same insubordinate act—in which a femaleplays the central role—leads God not only to cast Adam and Eve out of theGarden and to command that henceforth the serpent should crawl on itsbelly but also to ordain that women should suffer in childbirth, be subordi-nate to their husbands, and experience—as a gender—wantonness and sexual-ity. This is the real meaning of original sin.God says explicitly to Eve that, as a result of her behavior, ‘‘You shall beeager for your husband.’’23According to this myth, it is thus through Eve’stransgressive behavior that woman validates society’s patriarchal structure andcalls upon herself a deistic proclamation of lasciviousness. The misogyny in-herent in this foundational myth nowhere bears more bitter fruit than in theMalleus maleficarum; indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that much of thatwitch-hunting handbook, including the whole of part1, question6, rests onthis biblical image, as in the following passage:It is also clear in connection with the first woman that they have lessfaith by nature, since in response to the serpent’s question as to whythey did not eat of the tree of paradise, she said, ‘‘From every . . .lest we may die’’ [Gen.3:2–3]. In this she shows that she is doubtfuland does not have faith in the words of God. All this is demon-strated by the etymology of the noun.

She also denies the Faith more quickly, thisbeing the basis for acts of sorcery.24TheMalleuslater summarizes this view, saying that everything is gov-erned by carnal lust, which is insatiable in women.25The extreme attitudesprojected in theMalleusare a good reflection of late medieval elite mentalit-ies, as the line between witchcraft and the general, biblically validated viewof woman as the weaker vessel grew thinner and thinner throughout the laterMiddle Ages.26These oft-quoted examples of medieval misogyny help us understand theother piece of artwork, decorative ironwork from the door of Rogslo ̈sachurch. Here too one sees the images of the Tree of the Knowledge of Goodand Evil, of Eve in her sinful act, and of the serpent. Adam is again missing,and now the consequences of the Fall are lavishly illustrated. Illustrated not,however, as we in the modern world are used to imagining that scene of thecasting out of mankind from the Garden, with its inevitable use of ‘‘thecherubim and a sword whirling and flashing to guard the way to the tree oflife’’ (Gen.3:24), but rather by showing a cocklike demon, complete withspurs and comb, torturing a woman with a spurred instrument that wouldappear to match what is referred to in discussions of torture as aja ́rnkambr‘iron-comb’ or aja ́rnkro ́kr‘iron-hook’, both having as their function to rendthe flesh.27This scene is often associated with witchcraft by way of the pre-sumed inferiority and culpability of women and ties in with such widelyrepeated views as Bernhard of Clairvaux’s position that the main sin of witch-craft is the desire to struggle against obedience, a view repeated by the authorsof theMalleus. Within this scene on the door of Rogslo ̈sa church is containedthe entire complex of misogynistic ideas that shape the connection betweenwomen, evil women, and witchcraft in the Nordic world by the end of theMiddle Ages. Witches were surely not the only sort of evil women medievalScandinavians knew, but they perhaps became the prototypical evil womenof that world.Eve’s role in the Fall is also cited in Genesis as the reason for the existenceof patriarchy—because of her behavior, Eve’s husband will rule over her.

This idea manifested itself in various ways in the later"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Gender181Middle Ages and became the stuff of parish church murals. An extreme exam-ple comes from Villberga church in Uppland, Sweden, circa1450, whichpresents two instances of inverted social order: one, with the wife holding theshovel and the man stirring the kettle; the other, with the wife shown beatingthe husband.28These ideas are fundamental to the story of the ‘‘Battle over the Pants’’in its various manifestations.29In fact, such secular images of transgressivewomen are relatively common in church murals, especially the woman-devildyad (e.g., Mørkøv; Figure8in the present volume). Indeed, few sources cancompete with what we see, quite literally, in church murals and other plasticrepresentations of woman and witchcraft from this same world. They provideus with a special opportunity to understand the emerging mentalities of theMiddle Ages with respect to evil women and witchcraft.30The argument isgenerally made that the walls of medieval parish churches were intended as akind ofbiblia pauperum, the poor man’s opportunity to see what he couldnot read, ‘‘pages’’ in full public view on which worshippers could contem-plate images of the flight to Egypt, the Virgin Mary, the nativity of Christ,Cain slaying Abel, the slaughter of the innocents, Jesus in the temple, thestory of Samson and Delilah, and myriad other tales drawn from the scrip-tures.31Yet not every theme surrounding worshippers was drawn from theBible, and depictions of women and demonic figures are commonplace.Scenes showing a devil being ridden by a woman, his tail being pulled andhis buttocks apparently being thrashed by the woman are well documented(e.g., A ̊strup church), as are corresponding scenes showing the same themethe other way around, that is, a naked woman being ridden by a devil, whois pulling her hair and whipping her buttocks with a vicious-looking lash(e.g., Mørkøv church, Figure8in the present volume).It seems probable that these images are intended as admonishments,observations on witches interacting with the invisible world of demons. Anassociation of just this sort can be seen from the paintings in Va ̈stra Vemmer-lo ̈v church, where the figure of a woman holds the tail of a devil and beatsits arse with what appears to be a branch. The right-hand part of the paintingshows a milk-stealing witch.32That females beating devils, as in this scene,should be associated with witchcraft can be confirmed when we look broadlyat the paintings of Nordic church murals in this late medieval period. Vejlbychurch (Figure9) on Jutland also displays the milk-stealing witch but withimportant differences: it shows a central female figure churning butter; to herleft two devils advance bearing what is likely to be milk stolen from the cows"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"9.

It is she who captures the attention of the viewer, as bothof her breasts are exposed, and it is on them the little devil’s gaze appears tobe focused; moreover, she holds in her hands two whips, one resembling abranchlike instrument, the other, presumably a whip. This figure is thuscentral to holding together the well-developed complex of the milk-stealingwitch with the other images of women and devils with whips: there is everyreason to interpret the women in these images as witches.Frequent as the occurrence of the demon-witch-whip triptych is, themilk- and beer-stealing witch scenes are both more numerous and more wide-spread (e.g., Tuse, So ̈derby-Karl). In these paintings, we see various imps,demons, and devils attending and assisting the witches in the theft and prepa-ration of food. But there is sometimes much more than that in these pictures:in the case from Tuse church (Figure10), one sees that two devils assist thewoman, one of whom clearly leers at her; moreover, the same winged demonis pressing from behind a tube of some sort (a spigot?) into the woman’sgenitals, perhaps to be interpreted in a straightforwardly sexual way, perhaps"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"184chapter 611.

As a bird pecks at her eye, she spews into a glass held by a hermaphro-ditic and multi-specied demon holding a cudgel of some sort, while anotherdevil (with a gallows on his head) penetrates her anus or vagina with a burn-ing brand and licks his fingers; finally, a cat, perhaps representing the devil,looks on while preening itself and licking its own rear. At least one interpreta-tion holds that we see here a witch who has had sexual relations with thedevil and is now at the Final Judgment.33If ever we are presented with an image of what late medieval Scandinavia"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Gender185must have regarded as an ‘‘evil woman’’ (ondh quinna), certainly this one isit. And yet these often lurid murals surely had more purpose than merely toprovide variously titillating and terrifying images to the unwashed peasantryattending mass. In the context of his discussion of art as a cultural system,anthropologist Clifford Geertz notes, ‘‘To be of effective use in the study ofart, semiotics must move beyond the consideration of signs as a means ofcommunication, code to be deciphered, to a consideration of them as modesof thought, idiom to be interpreted.’’34In that vein, the discussion turns nowto the larger meaning of such paintings and the notion of social space in aneffort to discover what ‘‘mode of thought’’ is at work here.One way to approach the problem is to envision what these churchimages meant in the lives of medieval women and men. Among the quintes-sentially Nordic aspects of church architecture is the so-calledvapenhus,avestibule that functioned as a cold-trapping antechamber and a place whereweapons were to be left. But it also represents the transitional or liminal spacebetween the outside secular world and the marked holy area of worship.Indeed, one can easily envision a whole series of oppositions mediated by theliminal space of thevapenhus, such as exterior-interior, armed-disarmed,dark-light, secular-holy, and so on. Important in that context, whereas themurals of the church interior—of the choir, the nave, and the chancel—tendoverwhelmingly to be covered with scenes drawn directly from the Bible, thewalls of thevapenhusfrequently sport secular scenes as well as religious im-ages. But, of course, even these secular images appear to bear religious pur-pose.Our modern archival systems are necessarily atomizing and tend to ob-scure the continuity of images that the arrangements themselves sometimesexhibit. Seen in situ, however, a subtle interweaving of themes among thetopics suggests a pedagogical and didactic intentionality at work, even insmall parish churches.35The scenes do not always relate directly to one an-other, but they do display an important, meaningful pattern at work in theselection of topics. One scholar finds that murals containing devils are amongthe three most common types in the Uppland churches.36Indeed, the verylarge number of murals dealing with devils and witchcraft themes in Swedishand Danish churches is striking: here are scenes from the journey to thesabbat; of the milk-stealing witch making her butter; of the story of Sko-Ella;of the Final Judgment as witches approach the gates of hell; of the devilriding a woman; of a woman riding a devil, sometimes whipping him; andso on (Figures2–12).

In the fifteenth-century church at Vamlingbo on the island of Gotland, for example, thefollowing four scenes are placed in such a way as to suggest a nearly chrono-logical, narrative quality to the tableau, using familiar witchcraft iconogra-phy: milk-theft, churning butter with the stolen milk, devils conveying awoman to hell, and a presentation of hell itself.In a similar manner, standing inside thevapenhusof Dannemora churchin northern Uppland in Sweden, and facing its massive exterior door, as oneis about to leave the building, a worshipper would have seen the followingmurals facing him—or, of more than simply politically correct inclusiveness,her, pronominal attentiveness of genuine importance here: to the left, thewheel of fortune; a devil and a witch churning butter; two devils driving tohell a naked witch holding a butter mound (Figure7); and to her right, twowomen fighting over a kettle.38Seen together, it is impossible not to believe"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Gender187that one is indeed viewing the equivalent of a large open book concernedwith social conduct for women—a didactic message to the female congre-gants about how they should behave or, more accurately, how they shouldnot behave.39Nudity, querulous shrews, milk-stealing witches, lewd behav-ior, envy of the well-provisioned by those poor in foodstuffs, women traffick-ing with demons—certainly the themes of these pictures would haveconjured images of the most feared and unwelcome aspects of human societywhere women played a role.In the context of the proverb cited earlier, ‘‘an evil woman is the devil’sdoor nail,’’ surely such figures were the very evil women it envisions; that thedevil’s assistants should be presented in such transitional space as thevapen-hususefully reminds us of the remainder of the proverb. The passagewayworshippers necessarily took out of the church thus provided a regular oppor-tunity to see, inspect, and recall this visual conduct literature for women asthey transitioned from the site of worship to the mundane world outside. Wemoderns tend to examine these pictures as evidence of the church’s fears andits construction of a diabolical witchcraft belief system, as well we should, butit is useful to recall that, seen from the village level, these pictures representa powerful, and from the parishoners’ perspective, hopefully prophylactic,reminder of how women should, and should not, behave, in particular howthey might avoid being evil women.Collectively, these murals suggest the antithesis of the presentations offemale behavior to be found in the church itself, often dominated by femalesaints and images drawn from the tradition of Marian piety (e.g., the resplen-dent Virgin Mary in the nave of Dannemora church). These two polar oppo-sites, the Virgin of the nave and the diabolical witch of thevapenhus, were,of course, the alpha and omega of how late medieval society viewed womenand how it thought they might conduct themselves. Much has been made inrecent years of the ‘‘male gaze’’ in the Middle Ages, but we have perhapsgiven too little attention to the idea of the female gaze, especially where itwas a reflexive one, whether the standard of perfection was imposed by malesociety or not.40After all, one of the great engines of social control of womenwas, in fact, other women (cf. the role of women as accusers in the post-Reformation witch-hunts). In this context, it is useful to recall the sectionfromA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Older Law of Va ̈stergo ̈tland, ca.1225) in whicha Swedish version of the night-riding witch is described, and especially thatthis important monument to Norse witchcraft comes to us in the context of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"188chapter 6an enumeration of actionable slanders that can be said of women, includingaccusations of whoredom, infanticide, incest, and abortion.At the end of this list of social horrors—inversions of acceptable, normalsociety, defining what was meant by an ‘‘evil woman’’—the statute notes ina significant comment rarely included in discussions of the passage, ‘‘All thesesins should first be discussed with the priest and not flare up in rancorousnessor rage. . . .’’41The purpose of such a phrase might generously be said toavoid gossip and the administration of unsanctioned local justice, but onecannot easily avoid the conclusion that the passage is also meant to exertcontrol by promoting spying on others and reporting suspected misdeeds tochurch authorities.One is reminded here of how in his influential treatment of spectacleand control, Michel Foucault exploits the metaphor of Jeremy Bentham’sEnlightenment Age prison design, the Panopticon.42Bentham’s twin meansof control—isolation and surveillance—were seized upon by Foucault as avivid metaphor for social control and the less corporeal, but no less dreadpossibilities for oppression in the information age, but at its root, panopti-cism is largely concerned with employing social space as a means of socialcontrol. This understanding has obvious application to our materials, withthe intersection in the later Middle Ages of social control, women, women’sconduct, and witchcraft. At Dannemora and a few other parishes, at least,within the liminal space of thevapenhus, between the ‘‘wonder,’’ ormira,ofwhat occurs in the celebration of the Eucharist within the church and the‘‘evil,’’ ormalum(exemplified by the idea ofmaleficia‘witchcraft’), of theoutside world, female congregants were in plain text reminded of the dichot-omy they were literally and metaphorically transgressing. As they passedthrough the door of the narthex to the outer door of thevapenhus, the realityof the belief that ‘‘an evil woman is the devil’s door nail’’ reverberated allabout them.Because of its extreme views on the subject of witchcraft, especially itsexploration of the ‘‘fact’’ that these enemies of God and man are so frequentlywomen,Malleus maleficarum(1486) is usually cited in this regard. But assuggested earlier, the rush to vilify theMalleusrisks misunderstanding thedegree to which it principally echoes rather than forms common late medie-val thinking about women. Thus, for example, in1483, three years before thepublication of this notorious codification of gynophobic thinking, the firstbook printed in Sweden appeared: Maynus de Mayneriis’sDyalogus creatura-rum optime moralizatus. One is immediately struck by what this text suggests"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Gender189about prevailing elite views of women at the close of the Middle Ages, notionseasily transferred to ideas about magic and witchcraft. According toDyaloguscreaturarum(citing other authorities), man is a soul incarnate, a silhouette ofhis time, an explorer in life, a slave of death, a wayfarer in transit, a guest anda stranger, a dejected soul, and a temporary habitation; woman, by contrast,is the bewilderment of man, an insatiable creature, a constant concern, anincessant strife, the slave of man, and a pitfall for the abstinent man.43Gender and PowerHow does this reading of medieval attitudes about the nature of the sexes,and women in particular, affect how witchcraft was constructed? Is this viewstatic, or does the relationship between gender and witchcraft in the Nordicregion in the four centuries before the Reformation evolve? The previouschapters examined the various resources available for answering those ques-tions, that is, narrative sources, such as the sagas and court literature; norma-tive texts, especially secular and ecclesiastical law codes, such as the provinciallaws and synodal statutes; folk beliefs and popular mythology; and documen-tary sources, particularly the transcripts, protocols, and other testimony ofactual trials. I return here briefly to each of these areas with the specificquestion of gender in mind.All of these types of source materials are useful in assessing perceptionsof male and female roles in witchcraft, but they are not equal. Narrative texts,for example, are more likely than other types of evidence to reflect a singleindividual’s idiosyncratic views (albeit drawing on broader cultural norms).And even if occasionally ‘‘clouded’’ by these individual points of view, suchrepresentations can nevertheless provide a much more fleshed-out picture ofwitchcraft than the sort of enigmatic entry one often finds in an annal orother record. The testimony of legal thinking implicit in law codes and trials,on the other hand, is more likely to express the prevailing normative views ofthe empowered elite sector of society that had the principal hand, and aninterest, in crafting them. Trial records and other documentary notices, fortheir part, yield shadowy information in this period and are sometimes socryptic as to forgo any reasonable attempt at interpretation. The attempt torescue popular traditions from obscurity, the belief systems that gave meaningto the images on the church walls, for example, perhaps brings us closest towhat ‘‘everyman’’ understood about witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"190chapter 6Literary presentations of witches, witchcraft, and magic differ from theother sources in another very important way—it is only there that one occa-sionally finds positive representations of these phenomena, especially whenthey can be used in the service of the hero. Thus, for example, inBo ́sa sagaok Herrau5s(Saga of Bo ́si and Herrau5r), it is through magic that the witchBusla manages to secure the release from prison of her foster son, and thesaga’s hero, Bo ́si.44The attitude toward magic and witchcraft inBo ́sa saga okHerrau5sis, however, anything but uniform: when Busla utters her charm,the author goes to some length to make his disapproval apparent.45And atan earlier point in the saga, he writes, ‘‘There was an old woman namedBusla, who had been Thvari’s concubine, and fostered his sons for him. Buslawas highly skilled in magic. She found Smid more amenable than his brothersand taught him a great deal. She offered to tutor Bosi in magic as well, buthe said he didn’t want it written in his saga that he’d carried anythingthrough by trickery instead of relying on his own manhood.’’46That anyone in Western Europe in the early fourteenth century could beso ambiguous—even directly playful—about the topic of witchcraft is sur-prising but reflects one aspect of ‘‘Icelandic exceptionalism,’’ namely, its spe-cial relationship to the Nordic past.47Yet in this apparently lighthearteddismissal of magic as a would-be weapon in the hero’s arsenal, one also sensesan important and meaningful opposition between that which is ‘‘manly’’ orvirtuous (karlmenska‘manhood, valor’\u0003karl‘man (male)’ plusmenska‘human nature’), on the one hand, and magic, on the other (sleitum, lit.,‘through subterfuge’, in Bo ́si’s rejection buttaufr‘sorcery, charms’ in Busla’soffer).48That this distinction was operative appears to be borne out by thefact that, among the many male practitioners of magic to be found in medie-val Icelandic literature, male witches are overwhelmingly portrayed as villain-ous characters set in opposition to the hero, generally a Christianizing kingor a dowdy native son, rather than as dabblers in love magic and so on.Thus, in Snorri Sturluson’s early thirteenth-centuryO ́la ́fs saga Tryggvaso-nar(The Saga of O ́la ́fr Trggvason), King O ́la ́fr is said to have had all thesorcerers—all those ‘‘who were known to be guilty of practicing magic andsorcery or who weresei5r-men’’—in Norway rounded up and to have at-tempted to execute them.49Then follows the king’s conflict with one of themost powerful sorcerers in Norway, Eyvindr Kelda, who engages in activitiesthat project a highly militaristic image, including mustering a ‘‘levy’’ (lei5-angr), a term freighted with martial associations, and closing in on the king’s"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Gender191army, in ‘‘a warship fully manned with warlocks only and other kinds ofsorcerers.’’50Tales of this sort in the saga portray obstinate and studied resistance tothe king and his new religion, with the military-like use of magic to preventthe Christianizing king from advancing his hold on Norway. The pictureSnorri paints lumps pagan practices together with witchcraft in order to por-tray an organized, pagan-led resistance to the conversion of Norway.51Andagain, it is noteworthy that those who champion witchcraft and paganism inopposition to the heroes of the kings’ sagas are exclusively males—massedsupernatural females were part of Nordic tradition, yet Christianizing kingsin the sagas do not face bands of female sorcerers and witches in their at-tempts to convert the country to Christianity.52In the family sagas, virtuous heroes like the eponymous Gı ́sli Su ́rsson ofGı ́sla saga Su ́rssonar(The Saga of Gı ́sli Su ́rsson) are bedeviled by male witchessuch as4orgrı ́mr nef. According to several scholars, there is a slight prepon-derance of female witches in the sagas: of sixty-two identified witches andsorcerers, twenty-nine are men, thirty-three are women.53Among them is, tobe sure, the occasional female witch like4urı ́1rinGrettis saga A ́smundarsonar(Saga of Grettir A ́smundarson) who stands in direct and life-threatening oppo-sition to the hero, but many female witches, such as4o ́rdı ́sinKorma ́ks saga(The Saga of Korma ́kr) and Geirrı ́1rinEyrbyggja saga(The Saga of the Peopleof Eyri), are linked to the hero through such issues as sexuality and romance.Male witches, by contrast, tend to intersect with the heroes in more martialterms.Magic wielded by females has a special function in these sagas, where,conceived of as a literary device rather than an atavism, it arms saga womenwho otherwise have no direct conduit to institutional puissance within aphallocentric system. The careful use of magic thus fulfills plot-and character-driven purposes in the narratives. As Jo ́hanna Katrı ́n Fri1riksdo ́ttir writes,through magic ‘‘a female desire for power, autonomy and subjectivity oper-ates in a patriarchal world dominated by male violence and a legal system towhich women had no formal access.’’54She regards this magical empower-ment as being used by saga women principally to maintain or restore honor,keep peace, and gain financial advantage. The image that emerges from therepresentation of magically empowered figures in medieval Nordic narrativesources is then anything but uniform. Magic was not necessarily an impedi-ment to being a virtuous, or at least beneficial, character in either native orimported literature (e.g., Busla, Merlı ́nu ́s), but was generally treated as an"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"192chapter 6evil attribute to be shunned, and such exceptions that exist are few and farbetween. Solitary witches and sorcerers, male and female, are often presentedas significant or even insurmountable obstacles for otherwise undefeatablesaga heroes, but when witches and sorcerers are shown in massed, armylikescenarios in opposition to Christianizing kings, they are male.If we turn to the treatment of gender in legal and ecclesiastical codes, asubstantially different image emerges, changes that are somewhat surprising.Charges of witchcraft were widely held to be slanderous if unproven, and thisprinciple is occasionally phrased in the law codes to suggest a gendered real-ity. So, for example,A ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen(The Older Law of Va ̈stergo ̈tland)begins its remarkable commentary on witches with the statement, ‘‘These arethe slanderous words about a woman. . . .’’55Two centuries later,KristoffersLandslag(Sweden’sNational Law of King Kristoffer, ca.1442), at the otherextreme, appears to go out of its way to give parallel masculine and femininesets of charges for slander, marked morphologically and semantically, sayingthat a man or woman is guilty who calls anothertiufuer,mordare,ro ̈fuare,kettare,horenszon,trulkarl . . .‘thief, murderer, bandit, heretic, whore’s son,male witch,’ orhorkonna,moordherska,ketterska eller trulkonna . . .‘whore,murderer, heretic, or female witch. . . .’56The gender complexity of the legal texts is notable in some of the provin-cial and national law codes. For their parts, the Danish and native Icelandiclaws are relatively disinterested in the problem of witchcraft, compared to thedetail and the frequency with which it is treated in the corresponding Norwe-gian and Swedish documents. The Danish laws consistently present witch-craft as a phenomenon of which both men and women are capable: textsfrom the twelfth-century Scanian Church law through the famous fifteenth-century addendum to the Jutlandic Secular law display this gender-neutralview, although no text seems to be more painfully aware of the dyadic possi-bilities than the fourteenth-century Scanian secular law:57‘‘If a man poisonsa woman, or a woman a man, or a woman a woman through witchcraft orother poison, so that he or she dies of it, then [if it is] a man, he shall bedrawn and quartered, and [if it is] a woman, she shall be burned, if thereare adequate witnesses.’’58Icelandic law from the era of the commonwealthgenerally reflects an ungendered character, expressed through the unmarkedmasculine pronoun used: ‘‘If one [ma5r, i.e., ‘man’ or, as here, ‘a person’]uses magic or witchcraft . . .’’59Although some of the laws from the Scandinavian peninsula itself assertthe same sort of gender-blind condemnation of witchcraft found in the Dan-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Gender193ish and Icelandic codes, things are of a very different order on closer examina-tion. For example, the portion ofEi5siva7ingslo\u0001g(The Law of Ei5siva7ing)concerned with witchcraft draws a picture of evenhanded justice that makesclear that witchcraft was something of which both men and women werecapable.60Yet this apparently fair-minded and impartial section on witchcraftis in the same law code (and in the same manuscript tradition) only a fewsections later undermined by the declaration, ‘‘If it is known of a womanthat she has ridden a man or his household . . .’’61Indeed, there is an entiresubstrate in the Norwegian laws which appear to assume that, althoughwitches can be males, witchcraft is principally something women engage in;thus,Kong Sverrers Christenret(Norway’sKing Sverre’s Christian Law) re-marks, ‘‘ ‘But if it becomes known of a woman that she is a witch or a man-eater . . .’’62The Swedish laws exhibit a great deal of concern with one of the oldestarenas of witchcraft, poisoning, and for the most part, this attention comesin an entirely gendered fashion.63Typically, the laws read as in this examplefromUpplandslagen(The Law of Uppland): ‘‘If a woman poisons a man andshe is taken in the act, then she shall be fettered and taken to the thing(court) and the (articles of ) poison with her [ . . . ] if she is found guilty,then she shall be burned on the pyre.’’64With the codification of the various Swedish provincial laws under Mag-nus Eriksson in the mid-fourteenth century, however, this section is carefullyreworded so as to make clear that if a man or a woman engages in suchactivities, it will lead to capital punishment.65And while the mid-fourteenth-century national authorities place witchcraft in the realm of human, and notjust female, activities, the various earlier provincial laws are quite unambigu-ous about how the concept was viewed.Dalalagen (The Law of Dalarna), forexample, baldly states, ‘‘If a woman is taken (in an act of ) witchcraft, withhorn and hair, alive and dead, that may well be called witchcraft.’’66Perhaps surprisingly, especially against the background of increasinglymisogynistic writings on the Continent, there is scant evidence in such localecclesiastical texts as penitentials and synodal statutes to suggest that Nordicchurch leaders pushed for an a priori association of witchcraft with women,despite an ever more detailed and ever more lurid sense of the crime.67Onthe other hand, nonjuridical ecclesiastical writings in Scandinavia—that is tosay, texts that reveal the attitudes of church leaders but lack the power oflaw—are quite outspoken in their association of women with witchcraft.Among the most important testimonies in this regard are the writings of"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"194chapter 6Saint Birgitta, who devotes an entire vision to the topic of witchcraft, whichshe condemns (in particular, its efforts to control love, fertility, and healthand to see into the future), decrying the fact that men and women turn to it.Birgitta specifically says that it is wrong for them to follow the counsel ofthese deplorablefemalepractitioners of witchcraft.68And although Birgittaelsewhere mentions males who use magic (both as practitioners and custom-ers), she mainly casts females in the role of active witches.69In this context, where gender, power, and the image of women are allcentral, it is useful in the Nordic context to reflect on the role of SaintBirgitta. Known for her prophetic visions, she established a female religiouscommunity, the Ordo Sanctissimi Salvatoris. The monasteries of the Orderof Saint Bridget (as it is known in the Anglophone world) were to consistof two locally separate, but proximate and institutionally unified conventscomposed respectively of sixty nuns and twenty-five monks, deacons, and laybrothers that would on secular issues be under the leadership of an abbessjointly selected by the two groups. Birgitta envisioned this monastery as aninstitution principally for nuns, and the supremacy of the abbess in worldlymatters extended even to the head of the monks’ section, the confessor gen-eral.Birgitta was under no illusion as to the difficulties the order would en-counter: women, she opined in a visionary discussion with the Virgin Mary,would have no trouble submitting to the order, ‘‘but it will be difficult to findmen willing to submit themselves to the rule of a woman.’’70Her concern wasin one sense well founded, for although there were many men who becamedevoted and active members of her order, there was also consistent, and vocal,opposition, especially noticeable at the church councils of the early1400s.The growth of her order in Scandinavia, England, Estonia, the Netherlands,Italy, and elsewhere in the later Middle Ages is striking. And in the contextof shifting Nordic perceptions of women, power, and witchcraft, it is usefulto recall the issue that inevitably, and properly, attaches itself to the study ofwitchcraft, well framed by Christine Larner’s rhetorical question, ‘‘To whatextent, then, was the European witch-hunt [ . . . ] a response to a perceivedthreat to the social order through some change in the status or power ofwomen?’’71The church had always had a place for women, but as it experiencedthem not only in the context of Marian piety, of noble female converts suchas Clotilda and of suffering female martyrs such as Saint Lucy, but also ascapable women administrators, as ecstasy-experiencing Christians, and as"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Gender195members of a thriving female-led cult with fast-growing possessions and in-fluence, and particularly in the context of women’s governing not merelyother women but also men, troubles seem to have developed. A dynamic andfast-growing institution such as the Order of Saint Bridget may at some levelhave reinforced fears of a gynococracy, of an organized society of women. Inthis connection, it is worth noting that the opposition faced by the BirgittineOrder at the Council of Constance (1414–18)—and to a lesser degree againat the Council of Basel (1431–49)—was due not only to the interpretation ofBirgitta’s visions by many as heretical but also to a very high degree to theorder’s apparent status as a ‘‘double monastery.’’72Proof of subsequent struc-tural conflicts of the sort that worried many church leaders can be seen inthe problems that arose at Vadstena and other Birgittine monasteries in theearly fifteenth century, at least partially to be accounted for by the genders ofthe participants.73Beyond tensions of this sort, more striking still is the fact that the some-times feverishly negative responses to Birgitta—both by nonelites and byelites—tended to rely on constructions of the witch image: when she firstarrived in the Eternal City at midcentury, the Roman crowds reportedlywanted to kill her, condemning her as a witch, and she likewise enduredaccusations of witchcraft by the aristocracy.74The whole issue of female spiri-tuality, and thus the religious authority of such women, was put to the testat the Council of Constance when Jean Gerson considered the gift of theHoly Spirit and female mysticism, with a focus on Birgitta’s recent canoniza-tion.75As one scholar succinctly summarized these developments, ‘‘Birgitta’sboldness and controversial prophecies aroused suspicions, and her detractorsaccused her of heresy and witchcraft.’’76TheMalleus maleficarumremarksthat among the three qualities that typify those women especially subject towitchcraft is ambition; it also applauds the view that a man who would allowa gynococracy within his own house, who would permit his wife to governhim or impose laws on him, is the vilest of slaves; moreover, it approvesheartily the view that the root of all women’s vices is greed.77One cannothelp but wonder what the author(s) of theMalleusthought of women mysticslike Birgitta and female-run monasteries like those of the Ordo SanctissimiSalvatoris.Gerson’s treatise was far from the first indication of such inquiry: in arecent study, Dyan Elliott painstakingly outlines the gradual criminalizationof women’s religiosity in the later Middle Ages, a process whose beginningsshe traces to the time of the Fourth Lateran Council in1215.78That the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"196chapter 6general character of women (as well as Elliott’s argument about ‘‘proof ’’ and‘‘proving’’) found fertile ground in the Nordic world as well can be seen in aDanish text about the bad character of women. It is from the same fifteenth-century collection of materials (AM76,8to) discussed earlier and character-ized by its editors as a teaching manual, presumably for a cathedral school.After describing how a woman can with her false arts bring a man to grief,the writer declares that her words should be tested (prøue) and concludes thepiece by noting that Solomon, despite his cunning and wisdom (Salomonwar bode viss och klog), was deceived by a woman.79Translated religious litera-ture in the northern world shows many examples of males who have soldthemselves to the devil for material gain or sexual gratification but generallyassumes that witches are women.80This is a widely held view and can betraced from at least the late thirteenth-century Icelandic interpretation andpresentation of theCanon episcopi’s views, mirrored in the Old Icelandic lifeof John the Baptist.81How, then, do such considerations play out if we turn to the issue ofthose people who were actually brought to trial before the Reformation?82Given the character of the records, even if every case is successfully pluckedfrom the archives, it is difficult to imagine, based on the small size of the dataset, anything like the subtle and meaningful statistical readings some scholarshave managed to tease out of the early modern period for the various nationalsituations. Conversely, and with due appreciation for the fact that there ex-isted individual circumstances that have led to each of these cases, interestingprofiles do begin to emerge from the pre-Reformation data.Such evidence as we have, clustered largely in the late fifteenth centurysuggests several parallel and telling patterns, the outlines of which can betraced all the way back to the late twelfth century. Witchcraft charges againstwomen most often arise from cases involving sexuality and the women seemto be judged lightly. From Ragnhildr tregaga ́s in the fourteenth century tothe various women who appear in the Swedishta ̈nkebo ̈ckerat the close of theMiddle Ages, the pattern is the same. Although theoretically eligible for thecharge of witchcraft, men rarely stand accused of this crime but rather ofrelated offenses, such as apostasy and devil worship. And in each of thesecases, the men suffer the ultimate penalty, execution by such grim methodsas being burned alive.From a strict point of view, these two groups have nothing to do witheach other because the charges are different. But despite this distinction—indeed, perhaps better still,becauseof it—the comparison of these two groups"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Gender197is of great interest if we are to understand the question of gender in latemedieval Nordic witchcraft cases. Clearly, women are more likely to havebeen charged with witchcraft in pre-Reformation Scandinavia, but at thesame time they seem to have been treated with relative leniency, especially tothe extent that there is no evidence of capital punishment among womencharged. The impression also emerges that the courts were quite scrupulousabout the charges being brought. In the case of Ragnvald Odenskarl, who isaccused of having stolen from four different churches and of having servedO ́1inn for seven years, he has an accomplice in the thefts, Jon Land. Yet Landis never charged with anything other than the thefts themselves, a fact that isstriking, given the promiscuous use of the charge of the ‘‘Journey to Bla ̊kulla’’in post-Reformation trials.83The one exception to the trend for males to beaccused of apostasy and so on is the case of Ko ́lgrı ́mr, who is found guilty ofhaving used the ‘‘black arts’’ in seducing a woman and is burned for thecrime.What image emerges when we lay these pictures of gender and latemedieval witchcraft one on top of the other? Is it consistent, or is therenothing but chaos and irrationality? In fact, there is a great deal of unity inthe way witchcraft is treated in our sources: the normative materials suggestthe theoretical possibility of witches being either male or female, yet thesecular laws seem to suggest that in the early period women were more likelyto have been suspected and accused. With respect to the documentary materi-als, we might be content to say that every accusation that actually mentionswitchcraft involves a woman, but if we open the lens just a little wider andnot only include the cases where the specific termsmaleficium,trolldom,galdr,and so on are used but also look at related trials where devil worship andother acts that threatened church and civil stability were adjudicated, wecome much closer to understanding the core reality of late medieval Nordicwitchcraft, especially the essentially gendered way in which the northern legalauthorities approached the topic. Women were generally tried for magicalacts that had to do with the manipulation of sexuality, and only the case ofKo ́lgrı ́mr has a similar nature among the men.In the cases involving males, the men were tried for more openly rebel-lious acts against the church—heresy, devil worship, apostasy, and churchtheft. And recalling Snorri’s thirteenth-century presentation of witches andsorcerers at the time of the conversion to Christianity, we see this archetypereflected already, namely, in the image of massed sorcerers wielding not onlymagical power but also military might in opposition to the church and the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198chapter 6state. In fact, overall in the narrative materials, while witches may again beeither male or female, their roles differ, and it is the male witches who tendto be cast as the direct opponents of the missionary kings and the nativeheroes, whereas the female witches generally govern the realm of romanceand sexuality.In line with Jochens’s view that the roles of witch and sorcerer becomedecreasingly female andincreasingly male over time in the north, as notedearlier (Chapter5), conceptions of witchcraft—as reflected in the organiza-tion of the laws about it—evolve throughout the Middle Ages. In the earlyprovincial codes, such as those for Gula3ing, witchcraft statutes are locatedjust before such topics as heathenism, incest, and bestiality.84There is littledoubt but that witchcraft is conceived of here as being a perversion, and itsrelation to sexuality is hardly to be doubted. By the mid-fourteenth century,however, the NorwegianThird Statute of Archbishop Pa ̊l(written between1336and1346) has altered slightly its placement of witchcraft and now putsfornicators, perjurers, and heretics (villumen) together with sorcerers andwitches (spamen e5a galdrmenn).85The sexual connection is not lost, butwitchcraft is also being put on a par with those crimes that threaten socialorder—perjury and heresy.The earliest Old Swedish provincial laws (e.g.,A ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈talagen,Up-plandslagen) situate witchcraft statutes in whatever section seems sensible—those about superstition among the church laws, those about poisoningamong the criminal statutes, and so on. But by the time of the mid-four-teenth-century codification of the Swedish laws (Magnus Erikssons Landslag),witchcraft is addressed among laws of a very different sort.Ho ̈ghmala balker(The Section on High Crimes) evinces the following order: different forms ofmurder (of spouses, children, and so on), witchcraft (Forgo ̈r[...]me7trulldom ællæ andrum forgerningum), the death of stepchildren, traitors whowould raise an army against the king (Huilkin sum reser hær a mot kunungeællæ riksins hærra), those who would bring a foreign army against their home-land and rightful lord (Nu æn man le7ir a fosterland sit hær vtlænzskan, bærauoghan skiold amot sinum rættum hærra), the murder by servants of theirmasters, arson, rape, and poisoning (usually understood as a witchcraftstatute).86That witchcraft should now be thought of as having something in com-mon with such high-stakes topics as treason and armed rebellion as well aswith important civil crimes that also threaten social order such as murderand rape appears to be more than simple reorganization of the codes. The"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Gender199changes represent, it would seem, a reevaluation about just what sort of threatwitchcraft was understood to be: it is no longer simply a perversion butrepresents a serious danger to social stability.It should be remembered that Bernhard, Bonaventura, Peder Ma ̊nsson,and many other writers saw as the real problem of witchcraft its disobedienceof, and resistance to, God’s law and the church’s authority.87Similar accusa-tions of heresy and devil worship had been constructed earlier by the churchand its secular allies against the Knights Templar.88And at the very end ofthe Nordic Middle Ages, although the motivation and effects are more clearlypolitical, heresy is exactly the charge brought against the Swedish leaders inwhat has come to be called Stockholm’s Bloodbath.89That this charge wasused is often interpreted as a legal sleight of hand by Kristian II and thebishops, as heresy was not covered in the parties’ previous agreement; how-ever, we should consider the possibility that there was more meaning andtradition to the charge, and less legal maneuvering, than is sometimes sup-posed. Heresy was the logical accusation in a period that had increasinglyfound this charge to be a useful tool for continuing the domination of thechurch and state. Heresy was also one of the charges made against Birgitta.Witchcraft is sometimes defined as religion operating outside the struc-tures and strictures of the orthodox religious hierarchy. With that definitionin mind, it is not difficult to see how the legacy of Birgitta might have beenunderstood, not as witchcraft per se, but, given her claims to direct, propheticconnections to Godhead, as operating outside the orthodox religious hierar-chy.90The obverse of this same gendered concern may be seen in the nativeNordic perception of witchcraft as being fundamentally effeminate, that is,the view thatsei5r‘witchcraft’ was too womanly for men.91And here Bo ́si’sjudgment about how he wants to rely on hiskarlmenska‘manhood, valor’rather than on using magic (taufr,galdr) and trickery (sleita) may usefully berecalled. In other words, witchcraft and magic had a great deal to do withhow ‘‘maleness’’ and ‘‘femaleness’’ were constructed in late medieval northernthought. This native view was further reinforced over time by the pan-Euro-pean feminization of witchcraft, which held that only the weak-minded andweak in faith would be duped by the devil, traits long associated by learnedsociety with women.92The gendered character of witchcraft in medieval Scandinavia—the factthat when women are accused of the crime the charges have to do withsexuality, whereas men are typically charged with heresy and similar crimes,yet in theory witchcraft is something both men and women practice—is"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200chapter 6critical for our grasp of Nordic belief systems in that period.

Without a doubt, the relationship is more than a question ofpower, but power is part of the equation. It is more than a question oftheology, but theology unquestionably has a powerful role too. And it ismore than a question of attitudes and beliefs surviving from the pre-Christianperiod, yet these holdover views are also important in how such phenomenaare shaped.

A seem-ingly minor incident provides an illuminating example, in part due to its"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Epilogue203apparently uncontroversial nature. Writing at the height of the Thirty Years’War, a century after the Reformation had transformed Scandinavia, theSwedish agent in Zu ̈rich, Carl Marinus, contacted Sweden’s prime minister,Axel Oxenstierna, and expressed concern for how the contest between theProtestant and Imperial forces for Rheinfelden would end, given the fact thatone of the enemy had, under torture, informed the Protestants that fourhundred of their opponents in the Catholic stronghold had entered into apact with the devil.1That the matter is taken seriously demonstrates theextent to which this concept of the diabolical pact had by now become animportant form of shared discourse, a European-wide metaphoric languagethat happily employed images of humans as agents of the devil. This sameidea was, of course, the cornerstone of the European witchcraft belief systemthat had emerged from the Middle Ages.Here in a seventeenth-century Europe in the midst of one of its bloodiestand most destructive eras, Catholic and Protestant archenemies ‘‘talk’’through a shared, metaphoric language: the captured Imperial prisonerclaimed that his fellow soldiers had entered into a diabolical pact in order,perhaps, to intimidate the opposition or perhaps to escape further torment.The agent in turn passed the information on as a serious matter. Beyond thefact that opposing forces could apparently communicate through a sharedmetalanguage built on fear, it is also remarkable that the concept of thediabolical pact is so easily accepted as part of ‘‘lived life,’’ a fact with suchterrible consequences in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.2Some decades later, from1668to1676, Sweden experienced what wasScandinavia’s most pronounced example of witchcraft mania, as many indi-viduals, mainly women, were accused of practicing witchcraft, in large mea-sure demonstrated through their purported participation in the orgiasticconcept of the journey to Bla ̊kulla, a mythology whose roots, like the pact,had their origins in the Middle Ages.3Similar profiles can be drawn forthe other Nordic countries: Denmark experienced as many as one thousandwitchcraft executions and, in a1617ordinance defining the crime of witch-craft, officially tied it to the diabolical pact, an offense for which burning wasdeemed the appropriate penalty.4Although with far fewer incidents, Norwe-gian trials too, as recent research has demonstrated, were profoundly shapedby the concept of the diabolical pact.5Even Iceland, a famous outlier inmainly executing male witches during the post-Reformation period, couldnot entirely escape the effects of the pact ideology.6How very different this conspiratorial view of witchcraft seems when"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"204eplioguecompared to the relatively benign view of witchcraft in the Nordic MiddleAges, when such issues as lingering paganism and the occasional maleficwitch dominated church and state thinking about practitioners of magic. Bythe end of the medieval period, witches and the power of witchcraft wereseen, heard, and believed virtually everywhere in Scandinavia. A late fif-teenth-century Swedish sermon indicates what the faithful were directed tobelieve: it compares the devil with a wolf coming to harm the soul, ‘‘secretlyegging fools to sin or heresy and unbelief, fooling them with false teachings,with magic herbs, with witchcraft, and with the devil’s sorcery. . . .’’7In asimilar vein, but targeting a different audience, Peder Madsen, a mid-fif-teenth-century priest in Ribe, Denmark, rails widely against various forms ofwitchcraft in his Latin sermons, warning against the possible subversion ofChristianity’s magical kit—that is, baptismal water and the host—for use incharm magic.8Prayer books of the period likewise display serious concern about witch-craft. In a Danish prayer book from the early1500s, for example, the owner-nun prays to be protected ‘‘from all destruction and from all poison and fromwitchcraft and from all that which can do harm either in body or soul.’’9Other Danish prayer books show a similar pattern, for example, ‘‘protect(me) . . . from poisoning and from other witchcraft and from falsetongues . . .’’; ‘‘protect and hide me [ . . . ] from blows, from fire, from water,from all sorts of witchcraft, from treason . . .’’10The prayer book of BirgittaAndersdotter, a Swedish nun at Vadstena in the early1500s, amplifies theprayer considerably, listing many other possible forms of harm, includingwitchcraft. And the company witchcraft keeps in these litanies of potentialills is notable: not only witchcraft of every type but also weapons, fire, water,treason, captivity, evil of every sort, or anything that can harm her life, soul,reputation, or honor.11At the same time that we recognize how widespread the fear of witchcrafthad become by the time of the Reformation, it is important not to emphasizesuch dread to the degree that we lose perspective on the actual extent ofaccusations about this particular crime during the late medieval period. Totake as a possible example of the rate of witchcraft trials at the close of theMiddle Ages, in the Stockholm protocols for the period1471–92there areonly two capital cases of witchcraft, less than0.1percent of the total crimesrecorded.12And to return momentarily to the remarkably interior Nordicprayer books, the list of frightening potential harms by which Birgitta An-dersdotter feels threatened is so lengthy and the witchcraft entry so relatively"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Epilogue205‘‘unmarked’’ that it provokes an important question: Just how serious inreal terms was the fear of witchcraft among the populace, even among suchtheologically well-informed individuals as nuns? After all, among the manyhundreds of prayers that have been preserved from the Nordic Middle Ages,only a handful specifically mention witchcraft.Still, a growth in concern for witchcraft is noticeable, as we have seen,in the Danish laws of Jutland, which contain a famous paragraph concerningwitchcraft, indeed, its only statement on the topic. The date of the section isuncertain, with some arguing that its origins are in the thirteenth century,while others maintain that it came about roughly at the time of the manu-script, circa1400. It reads in its entirety, ‘‘Concerning Witchcraft. If oneknows of someone that he has killed one of his people through witchcraft andthe accused does not confess but rather denies it, and the accuser confirms thecharge against him, then the accused should defend himself with a committee(drawn from) the parish, face to face with the accuser as with the Bishop.’’13As scholars have long noted, whatever the date of the statute, it is clearly moreconcerned with process than with definitions or enumerations of witchcraftactivities; moreover, defense against the charge, rather than accusation ordefinition, is the critical element.By the time of Kristian II’s national Danish law of1521, on the otherhand, a very different perspective had developed.14In it, the law specifies thenature of witchcraft, tying it both to the reputation of individuals in thecommunity and to such empirical markers as their behavior on, for example,Maundy Thursday and Walpurgis Night.15As in the cases examined earlierof conversion narratives using magic as a form of communication and as away for saga writers and other medieval Nordic authors to project a sense ofantiquity, this law code uses witchcraft as a means of communication, in thiscase as a proxy or forum for debate between the church and the monarchy.Who will, in fact, define what witchcraft is and how it should be punished,the crown or the clergy?Early sixteenth-century focus on such issues was itself perhaps more anindication of the changes that had been taking place in Scandinavia over theprevious four centuries than it was a shaper of them. Ideologies worked outthroughout the Nordic Middle Ages—the consolidated myths about magicaltheft and the journey to Bla ̊kulla, together with deep belief in the diabolicalpact, especially as these ideologies became fixed in the eyes of both secularand ecclesiastical authorities—set the stage for the hunts of the early modernperiod. These myths were ostensive narratives that both explained life’s dark"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"206epliogueevents and offered solutions to them: against the threat of witchcraft stoodthe promise offered by Christian prayer—‘‘protect me [ . . . ] from all sortsof witchcraft’’—as well as the full prosecutorial weight of both church andstate.Despite the break with the Catholic Church represented by the six-teenth-century Reformation, witchcraft’s trajectory changed little in the Prot-estant era.16There were those who objected, of course: the Danish bishop,Peter Palladius, for example, complains at midcentury about the ‘‘popish-ness’’ he believes to be behind the fear of witches.17That view was not thedominant one, however, and did not stop large numbers of Danish citizensfrom being executed for the crime in the early modern era. Clearly, percep-tions of witchcraft had evolved dramatically over the previous centuries, froma time when in the early fourteenth century Bishop Au1finnr sentenced aconfessed practitioner of magic to nothing more draconian than fasts, pil-grimages, and exile, what one observer has characterized as ‘‘an enlightenedand rational cultural figure’s opposition to the superstitions of the period.’’18If modern scholarship is correct, not so many centuries before the bishop’sfinding, the practice of magic may well have been an instrument of Nordicwarfare and an integral part of Viking Age society.19Much, indeed, changesover the interim, as the presumably socially approved, and even lauded, magicof the Viking world is transformed throughout the Middle Ages into Scandi-navia’s Reformation-era vision of witchcraft. With its images of the milk-stealing witch, the participant in the diabolical and sexually charged eventsat Bla ̊kulla, and the evil woman in league with the devil this much alteredconception of witchcraft forms the necessary predicate for the formidableNordic witch-hunts that will play out in the early modern era."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Notespreface1.

While other important"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"notes to pages 3–5209changes occurred in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, no line that can be drawnaround1500seems quite as fundamental for the history of magic as that drawn around1200.’’ Bailey2008,28.17. See Cohn1975,1–32. This argument has, however, been challenged in Ginzburg1991; see also Ginzburg1993a and1993b. This phrasing perhaps masks the diversity thatexists in the scholarly literature: some would, for example, see in Russell1972a strongemphasis on folk traditions, whereas a work such as Peters1978focuses more on thescholiast view.18. Examples of this point are found in treatments concerned with the New World’smost celebrated witch-hunt, that in Salem in1692: one written on the eve of the AmericanRevolution, the other seventy years later. Both Hutchinson1870(from the1760s) andUpham1832regard, and to some extent look to explain away, the event as a ‘‘delusion.’’19. Hutchinson1718. The seismic shift in thinking is one I have explored in a casefrom the early nineteenth century. See Mitchell2000c,2004.20. Cf. Oja1999,33–34et passim.21.

Ginzburg’s findings (1985) have resulted in renewed interest, and confidence,in such a scenario.27. Trevor-Roper1967; cf. Trevor-Roper1969.28. Michelet1862; Harris1974,193.29. Thomas1971. In his review, Midelfort (1973,434) comments that ‘‘Thomas haswritten one of the most important books of recent times.’’30. Ankarloo1984. Cf. similarly fine statistical analyses, and materialist arguments,in such works as Midelfort1972; Boyer and Nissenbaum1974; and Næss1982.31. Anthropology as a ‘‘modern’’ point of comparison is misleading—already wellbefore Evans-Pritchard’s landmark study of Zande witchcraft (Evans-Pritchard1937), Kit-tredge1929,26et passim, drew on contemporary ethnographies in his exhaustive surveyof Anglo-American traditions.32. The best example of this synergy may be Macfarlane1991, the preface to whichwas written by E. E. Evans-Pritchard. The application of anthropology to history, and thestudy of witchcraft in particular, has been of such influence that some have even suggestedthat its moment may have passed (e.g., Nedkvitne2000).33. Cf. Turner1967. For a useful example of this dynamic approach, see Turner1972,148–53.34. Most prominently, Thomas1971and Macfarlane1991, but also Douglas1970b,xiii, signals this sea change: ‘‘Historians and anthropologists have a common interest in"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"210notes to pages 5–8the subject of witchcraft, but until very recently their outlooks have diverged[. . . . ] Nowthis difference is being narrowed: the historians who have contributed to this volume havesucceeded in delving into material very comparable to that used by anthropologists andthe latter are gradually improving the time-scale of their observation.’’35.

An earlier generation of scholars (e.g., Bætzmann1865; Lehmann1920; Bang1896; Gering1902; Gadelius1912–13; Linderholm1918a,1918b; O ́lafur Davi1sson1940–43)did yeoman’s work in assembling materials. These early works have largely been eclipsedby emerging new techniques and views, such as the reintegration of archaeology andphilology provided in Price2002and others, and by detailed examinations of the sagas(e.g., Dillmann2006). In a class by itself is Dag Stro ̈mba ̈ck1935, a study of (mainly)literary representations of divination and ‘‘black magic,’’ whose continued importance wasrecently reassessed by Almqvist2000and Mebius2000. Many of the relevant primarymaterials on early Nordic magic are conveniently anthologized in McKinnell, Simek, andDu ̈wel2004.41. Dillmann1986,2006.1986was also the year in which Regis Boyer’s more popu-larly orientedLe monde du double: La magie chez les anciens Scandinavesappeared. Cf.Boyer1981.42. Any attempt to distill in a few lines the nearly eight-hundred-page results ofmany decades of research will naturally fall far short of perfection. For a thorough review,see Jochens2006.43. With respect to the sagas, see my remarks below in Chapter3, as well as Mitchell2000a; however, these texts remain useful, indeed indispensible, to the study of late IronAge Scandinavia. See, e.g., the argument in Andre ́n2005.44. Raudvere2003. Many of Raudvere’s views are also available in her earlier En-glish-language discussion of witchcraft (trolldo ́mr) in Raudvere2001.45. This question, and the conflict between the heroic ethos and the idea of fate,was the subject of an earlier monograph, Wax1969.46. Solli2002.47. Several studies have taken to Viking Age witchcraft and magic the issues ofgender, social roles, and feminism, e.g., Morris1991and Jochens1996.48. Price2002.49.

See Mitchell2009a for an example.59. Cf. Jansen1959, although it should be obvious that the obverse, the esotericperspective, renders a very different judgment.60. Cf. Flint1991,33. Increasingly large numbers of clerics practiced learned formsof magic; on this point, see esp. Kieckhefer1989.61. Flint1991,3. For a valuable summary of perspectives, see Cunningham1999aswell as Styers2004, who argue for a more socially constructed understanding of magic asa category developed in the context of the colonialist expansion of the West (see esp.25–68).62.

Russell1972,18, divides the medieval demons into three groups: minor demons,major demons (e.g., Beelzebub), and ‘‘the Devil himself.’’ On the medieval conception of‘‘the devil,’’ see Russell1984and the literature cited there.64. By the end of the Middle Ages, of course, this mythology also incorporated theidea of the devil’s pact (pactum cum diabolo). On this phenomenon in medieval Europegenerally, see Russell1972,18–19,59–60,65et passim; and for medieval Scandinavia,Mitchell2008b and the discussion in Chapter4.65. ‘‘Hermogenes kallar sina diæfla: Ok biudher them binda sanctum jacobum[...]Jacobusbadh gudz ængil læta them løsa . . .’’ Stephens and Dahlgren1847–74,1:164.Biudha(biu7a) is here understood as ‘‘bjuda, befalla. med personens dat.’’ See So ̈derwalland Ljunggren1884–1973.66. ‘‘ek sœri3ik, O ́1inn, me1hei1indo ́mi, mestr fjanda; ja ́ta3vı ́; seg me ́r . . .’’ I amhere following the normalized text provided in MacLeod and Mees2006,31, as well astheir translation, with my emendations."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"212notes to pages 12–1767.

Hammond1970,1355, who concludes, ‘‘Magic isnot an entity distinct from religion but a form of ritual behavior and thus an element ofreligion.’’ The hag-oriented view (cf. Daly1978), although useful, is far from a majorityperspective; cf. Stark2001,114, who writes, ‘‘Magic differs from religion because it doesnot posit the existence of Gods, does not offer explanations either of its own domain oraddress questions of ultimate meaning, does not offer ‘otherworldly’ rewards, and is un-able to sanctify the moral order, while religion does all of these.

Still useful are Troels-Lund’s monumental portrait of sixteenth-century Scandina-via (Troels-Lund1880–1901) and Hans Hildebrand’s charming if dated review of medievalSweden (Hildebrand1983, originally published from1879to1903). More recent scholar-ship has tended to focus on the role of women in medieval Scandinavia (e.g., Skyum-Nielsen1971; Jacobsen1986,2007; Jochens1995).3. I make no pretense to completeness in this survey but intend only to provide anorientation for those not already familiar with the topic. For excellent English-languagediscussions of Nordic history in this period, see Sawyer and Sawyer1993and Helle2003.4. These inter-Nordic rivalries gave rise to a great historiographical tradition in theNorth, mostly in the form of rhymed chronicles. On the genre as a whole, and specificallyon the Swedish tradition, see Jansson1971; on the Danish rhymed chronicle, see Hermann2006and2007b.5. On the Gotlandic assertion of autonomy, see Mitchell1984.6. See Gelsinger1981, esp.181–94. So great was this international connection that,despite a supposed trade monopoly, the Icelandic fifteenth century is called ‘‘the EnglishAge’’ (Enska o ̈ldin); see Bjo ̈rn4orsteinsson1970.7. For excellent presentations, see the entires in DuBois2008.8. For English-language surveys, see the medieval chapters in the national volumesthat make upA History of Scandinavian Literature(Rossel1993–2007). With the impor-tant, and dominant, exception of the Icelandic sagas, the medieval materials have largelyremained untranslated and thus tended to remain the province of specialists.9. E.g., Brown1981; Flint1991; Gurevich1988.10. Cf. Wax and Wax1962. The elite-nonelite dyad remains a convenient intellectualtool and underscores the relationship between learned, ‘‘global’’ discourses on witchcraftand local folk belief—how, for example, the elite community appropriates local belief forits own ends. See the discussions in Birkhan1989; Mitchell, Collins, and Tangherlini2000; and Watkins2004.11. On ‘‘medieval popular culture,’’ see Rosenberg1980, who notes the proclivity toinsert into the Middle Ages our own atomistic approaches, specifically such notions as‘‘elite,’’ ‘‘popular,’’ and ‘‘folk.’’12. The possibility of discovering history’s hidden voices, ‘‘history from below,’’ hasgiven rise to such fields as subaltern studies, microhistory, and ethnohistory.13. ‘‘Overlap’’ should not obscure the fact that the Christian law sections often indi-cate a power struggle between church and state about the authority to formulate thesesections of the codes.14.

Cf. the sensible suggestion by Nielsen1983,75, who objects that ratherthan the name of the rune carver, the4ormundr is more likely to be the name of thedeceased: thus, ‘‘Make good use of the monument,4ormundr!’’24. Jungner and Sva ̈rdstro ̈m1940–70,396, normalizes the inscription as, ‘‘Gal andavi1r, gangla vi1r, ri1anda vi1(r), vi1r rinnanda, vi1r s[it]ianda, vi1r sign[and]a, vi1r f[a]ra-nda, vi1r fliughanda.

On this charm, see Jungner and Sva ̈rdstro ̈m1940–70,394–403; on its dating,402–3.25. According to Adam of Bremen, Skara was the site of a bishop’s seat already inthe eleventh century (Book2,56[Pertz1846,89–90]).26. On the role of runic inscriptions during this period, see Sawyer2000,124–45,esp. her observation that these monuments represent ‘‘a transitional stage, when manynew converts tried to bridge the gap between their, and their kin’s, pagan past and theirown—Christian—era.’’ See also Williams1996a on the absence of conflict between paganand Christian in Swedish rune stones of this period.27.

Molland1982b suggests that, for Scandina-via, archaeological evidence from Kaupang in Vestfold, Norway, fits Schmidt’sKulturmis-sion; the work of Saint Ansgar, Schmidt’sWortmission; and O ́la ́fr Tryggvason’s extremetechniques, examples of aSchwertmission.70. Waitz1977,38–39. The historical worth of this story, given its resemblance tothe Job story, an influential tale in the early Middle Ages (cf. Besserman1979,66–75), isless than its metaphorical value.71. Miracles as Christian magic has been at the core of a long debate. EvenTheCatholic Encyclopedia’s wording supports the equation: ‘‘Latinmiraculum, frommirari, ‘towonder’ [ . . . ] wonders performed by supernatural power as signs of some special missionor gift and explicitly ascribed to God.’’ See Knight2003. The proximate character ofmiracles and magic is, of course, at the heart of the legend of Simon Magus; cf. Acts8:9–24and the comments on this legend in Flint1991. For an excellent review of miraclesin saints’ lives as a form of ‘‘white magic,’’ see Loomis1948. Thomas1971,25–50, offersan assessment of the role of the church and magic in daily life in medieval England. Onthe Nordic situation, see the survey in Edsman1982b, as well as Mitchell2009b.72. This site has generated an enormous body of literature; excellent orientations areprovided in the contributions to Nielsen et al.1974and in Roesdahl1982.73. ‘‘King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father,and in memory of4orve ́, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmarkand Norway and made the Danes Christian.’’ Elmevik and Peterson1993–.

An abbreviated version of this tale is related, for example, by Theodoricus mona-chus, which reads in part, ‘‘Illuc ergo rex adveniens invitavit ad se omnes illos, qui arctiorivinculo diabolicarum falsitatum irretiti fuerant et vulgari locutione dicunturseithmen,etquia illos perspexit insansabiles, ne novellæ plantationi nocerent, collectos in domumdæmonibus dedicatam una cum simulachris igni cremari jussit; quorum fuisse feruntnumerum octoginta promiscui sexus.’’ Storm1973,18–19.

The termhuli5shja ́lmr(alsohulinshja ́lmr) is often glossed as ‘hidden helm’ (Cleasby and Vigfusson1982,292) or ‘hiding helmet’ (Zoe ̈ga1975,215); more expansively, Fritzner1973,2:90,writes, ‘‘Hjelm som gjør den usynlig, der bærer den paa sit Hoved [ . . . ] men i Alminde-lighed betegnes derved ethvert Trolddomsmiddel, som anvendtes til at gjøre en Personusynlig.’’ Cf. de Vries1961,266, who glosses it astarnhelm, noting its connection (throughhylja)tohel.86.

Tales about O ́la ́fr Tryggvason have provided rich materials formedieval Nordic authors: Oddr Snorrason, a monk of the4ingeyrar monastery, wrote aLatin life of O ́la ́fr, circa1190. His fellow monk, Gunnlaugr Leifsson, also wrote a Latinlife, probably before1200. Although now lost, Oddr’s text is known from an Old Norsetranslation from about1200. Oddr’s saga, together with the heritage about O ́la ́fr in theskaldic tradition, were probably used by Snorri in composing his saga of O ́la ́fr; Gunn-laugr’s text is thought to have been used by the author ofO ́lafs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta.See Bjarni A1albjarnarson1962, xiii-xiv, and Bjarni A1albjarnarson1936,55–135, as well asthe overview in O ́lafur Halldo ́rsson1993.OnO ́la ́fr against the ‘‘Powers of Darkness,’’ seeSimpson1973.87.

Cf. the illuminating comments situating Caro Baroja’scontributions in Clark2001,1–9.94. Readers will recognize that I am intentionally parodying one of the most famousthings Claude Le ́vi-Strauss didnotsay—or did not exactly say. It is sometimes bruitedabout that the famous French anthropologist had once written something like, ‘‘Food isnot only good to eat, but also good to think with.’’ As far as I can determine, he neverwrote those words (or their French equivalent), although he did note, ‘‘We can under-stand, too, that natural species are chosen [for totemic purposes] not because they are‘good to eat’ but because they are ‘good to think’ ’’ (Le ́vi-Strauss1963b,89), a remark thathas occasioned a variety of thoughtful responses (e.g., Tambiah1969). The pseudo-Le ́vi-Straussian remark is admittedly not the same thing as the original, but the reformulationhas taken on a life of its own in scholarship and popular culture (e.g., Bloch1998) andoffers its own interpretive possibilities.95. See, e.g., the confrontation over ‘‘real’’ and ‘‘commodified’’ magic in the case ofSimon Magus in Acts8.96. The most obvious line of inquiry on this issue—the human faculty for symbolicinterpretation—is that associated with Ferdinand de Saussure and subsequent structuralistthinking within anthropology influenced by it (the works of Claude Le ́vi-Strauss mostfamously), but it should be noted that this view also has roots in the writing of E ́mileDurkheim as well.

In one of the best-known statements about the implications of his findings,Le ́vi-Strauss1963a,61, writes that he is looking to analyze ‘‘marriage regulations andkinship systems as a kind of language, a set of processes permitting the establishment,between individuals and groups, of a certain type of communication. That the mediatingfactor, in this case, should be thewomen of the group,who arecirculatedbetween clans,lineages, or families, in place of thewords of the group,which arecirculatedbetweenindividuals. . . . ’’100.‘‘Ve ́r skulum gera elda3rja ́; skulu13e ́r hei1nir menn vı ́gja einn, en ek annan,en inn3ri1i skal o ́vı ́g1r vera.

See the many exam-ples from Icelandic literature listed under ‘‘V331.1.Conversion to Christianity through mira-cle’’ in Boberg1966. Many of the narratives dealing with the conversion of Iceland areaddressed in Sveinbjo ̈rn Rafnsson1977, while a more ethnographically situated study ofthe process is laid out in Jo ́n Hnefill A1alsteinsson1978.102. Cf. Sveinbjo ̈rn Rafnsson1977.103. Cf. Flint’s comments (1991,33) on the differences between the two as under-stood by Saint Augustine: ‘‘In these chapters of theCity of Godwe have a summary ofwhere lay, for Augustine, the dividing line between condemnable and essential magic.‘Veneficia,’ ‘maleficia,’ ‘malefici’ diminish, defraud, give pain. In league with demons,they conceal the true good from humankind. ‘Mira’ and ‘miracula,’ on the other hand,overcome fear and pain, and encourage hope and open happiness. Yet, undeniably, theycontain magic of a kind.’’104.‘‘3a ́bar4angbrandr ro ́1ukross fyrir skjo\u0001ldinn...’’Einar O ́l.

Sentiments along these lines are most famously associated with Pope Gregory’s"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"notes to pages 38–40221instructions to Saint Augustine as reported in Bede’sHistoria ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum(chap.27). On pagan survivals in the Christian calendar in the Middle Ages, see Russell1972,50–52. Largely concerned with this phenomenon of Christian interpretations ofpagan ritual and magic is Flint1991,254–328.109. English ‘‘conversion’’ ultimately derives from Latinconvertere‘to turn around’,Old Icelandicre ́ttsnu ́ningfromre ́ttr‘law, right, due’ andsnu ́a‘to turn’,si5askiptifromsi5r‘custom, habit, conduct, faith’ andskipita‘to shift, change’, and Old Swedishumva ̈ndilseand Old Danishomwendelsefromva ̈nda‘to turn’.

Other prominent contributors to this discussion includeEdward Tylor and James Frazer, whoseThe Golden Bough(Frazer1890, and many subse-quent revisions, esp. Frazer1915) was deeply influential in formulating the nontheologicalstudy of religion. The change of subtitle fromA Study in Comparative ReligiontoA Studyin Magic and Religionsuggests Frazer’s growing recognition of the important place ofmagic in such a study.2. Cf. Brown1991; Cournoyer and Malcolm2004. For a survey of earlier literature,see the review in Kearney1975.3. This phrase is widely associated with Wax and Wax1962,183, who summarize theessence of the argument by noting, ‘‘It is we who accept the possibility and logic of purechance, while for the dweller in the magical world, no event is ‘accidental’ or ‘random,’but each has its chain of causation in which Power, or its lack, was the decisive agency.’’4. Providing an adequate translation for the prefixvan- can be elusive: ‘lacking’and ‘under’ (as in Zoe ̈ga1975) are close. Cf.

On the various forms of syncretism, see Berner2001, as well as thediscussion in Chapter1.

Regarding the ‘‘herb, medicine woman,’’ severalscenes in medieval Nordic literature show women as healers (e.g.,O ́la ́fs saga helga[BjarniA1albjarnarson1979,391–93]), but typically the appellation in such instances islæknari,læknir‘physician’.Lyfsuggests both medicine and witchcraft (e.g., ‘‘kraftig Middel, derbenyttes til et eller andet Øiemed saasom Lægedom, Troldom’’ [Fritzner1973,2:575]; cf.læknislyf‘a medicine’). The term is frequently found in collocations that imply that itsassociation, or perhaps its contrast, with witchcraft was common (e.g., ecclesiastical laws[Keyser and Munch1846–95,3:285–86], sermons [Eirı ́kur Jo ́nsson and Finnur Jo ́nsson1892–94,168]). Thus one sermon describes a woman stricken with epilepsy: ‘‘okengalæcning lyfe5agalldra cva1hon se ́r at hialpum ver1a.’’ Indrebø1931,123.25. Among historical examples of such confessions: e.g., in a Norwegian case from1324–25, a woman says she has learned a curse from a man (Unger and Huitfeldt1847–,9:114); in a Swedish case from1490, a woman says she has learned a charm from anotherwoman (Carlsson1921–44,418). The Icelandic sagas brim with representations of witch-craft being learned by younger people from more seasoned practitioners: e.g., Gunnhildr’sapprenticeship with the Sa ́mi inHaralds saga ins ha ́rfagra(Bjarni A1albjarnarson1962,135), Busla’s offer to teach magic to Bo ́si inBo ́sa saga ok Herrau5s(Rafn1829–30,3:195–96);Gunnlaugr’s visits with Geirrı ́1rinEyrbyggja saga(Einar O ́l. Sveinsson and Matthias4o ́r1arson1957,28). See Mitchell2003c.26. Gummerus1902,30–31; Stephens and Dahlgren1847–74,1:165; and Unger1874,531,525. I infer a reference to grimoires (and other magical writings) from the Arbogastatue’s rejection of ‘‘quascunque litteras et scripturas cum characteribus et vocabulorumignotorum in sacra scriptura non expressorum inscripcionibus’’ (30). Although I do notmaintain the distinctions often clustered around the ideals of high and low magic, I dooccasionally, as in this instance, refer to the dichotomy—this choice is not intended togainsay the excellent work of other scholars in keeping this categorization in plain view,but on the whole, I find myself agreeing with Peters1978,166–70, with respect to thesequestions.27. Cf. the older reviews in, e.g., Lehmann1920,1:185–219, and more recent treat-ments, such as Peters1978,63–84,110–37; and Kieckhefer1997,1–21.28. Cf.

When themaster returned and read a chapter in the book of equal length, the storm ceased. [IslendskÆventyri]\u000423,’’ but this description in Tubach1969hardly gives a full impression of thisvariation of the popular ‘‘Sorcerer’s Apprentice’’ story, which is evidently a multiform ofAT325*Apprentice and Ghost(Aarne and Thompson1961). The essence of the story is atleast as old as thePhilopseudesof Lucian (ad 125–80) but is no doubt best-known tomodern audiences through Goethe’s poem,Der Zauberlehrling, which was taken up acentury later inL’apprenti sorcierby Paul Dukas. That work was in turn made famous inWalt Disney’s animated sequence inFantasia(1940)."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"notes to page 4722530. E.g., Thorkelin1781,118. This same idea is at the heart of the well-known inter-national story,Escape from the Black School(ML3000in Christiansen1958; cf. the post-medieval Icelandic text in Jo ́nA ́rnason1954–61,1:469–70), aspects of which are found inconnection with Sæmundr the Wise already in the older version ofJo ́ns saga helga(Sigur-geir Steingrı ́msson, O ́lafur Halldo ́rsson, and Foote2002,339–43). The broad outlines ofthe story are already present in the medieval text, but in the later tradition, the darkcharacter of the tale has been developed and embellished: the all-knowing astrologer asmaster has evolved into the devil himself, theSvartasko ́li‘‘Black School’’ is now fullyarticulated, and so on; at the same time, the more modern version eliminates Jo ́n’s roleand considerably reconfigures the nature of Sæmundr’s escape.

Hødnebø1982b,671, notes that there are no existing pre-Reformation grimoiresintended to help make contact with evil spirits, but of a tradition using various forms ofsympathetic magic, there are traces. The so-called Vinje book from Telemark (publishedas Garstein1993; individual charms also in Bang1901) survives from the late fifteenth orearly sixteenth century (pace Hødnebø1982b,672, who places it to ca.1520; Garstein1993calls for a decades older date). Mostly filled with medical and religious materials, oftenlearned, some items, such as the charms for discovering a thief or bending a woman’s will,reflect precisely the issues taken up here. One of the best known early modern Scandina-vian charm collections is Lindqvist1921(trans. as Flowers1989).33. See, e.g., the collections in Bang1901; Ohrt1917–21; Lindqvist1921; and Matthı ́asVi1ar Sæmundsson1996.34. On this aspect of the Old English charms, see esp.

In the Nordic context, this patternaccounts for many words for those who practice magic, male and female; typically builtonda ́5‘deed’ orgerning‘act, doing, deed’ (\u0002gerningar‘witchcraft’), these terms areamong the most negatively charged in the entire lexicon (e.g.,fordæ5uma5r,gerningakarl,gerningama5r,gerningavættr,fordæ5a,gerningakona,gerningavı ́f).

It is critical to note that ‘‘performance,’’ as it is intended here, haslittle to do with the desiccating Freeprose-Bookprose debate that long dominated OldNorse studies, on which, see my remarks in Mitchell2003d. My comments here are basedon the detailed presentation in Mitchell2007b.164. Milman Parry, the iconic figure in the field of oral poetics, phrased this centralquestion as follows: ‘‘My Homeric studies have from the beginning shown me that Hom-eric poetry, and indeed all early Greek poetry, is oral, and so can be properly understood,criticized, and edited only when we have a complete knowledge of the processes of oralpoetry; this is also true for other early poetries such as Anglo-Saxon, French, or Norse, tothe extent they are oral. This knowledge of the processes of an oral poetry can be had upto a certain point by the study of the character of a style, e.g., of the Homeric poems; buta full knowledge can be had only by the accumulation from a living poetry of a body ofexperimental texts. . . . ’’ Quoted in Mitchell and Nagy2000, ix.165. Performance theory as formulated in, e.g., Bauman1975. As one scholar hasexpressed the impact of this view, ‘‘Attention to the formal attributes of verbal art and itsessence as live performance has revivified the study of ethnographicand ancient texts,asscholars recognize poetic structuring and dramatic action in texts formerly conceived ofasonlyprose narratives.’’ Sawin1998,498(emphases added). OnSkı ́rnisma ́l, performance,and staging, see also Gunnell1995; cf. Gunnell1993.166. Reichardt regards the curse as an interpolation but views the curse itself as anauthentic example of Nordic ‘‘love magic’’: ‘‘die Liebesbeschwo ̈rung unseres Liedes einStu ̈ck magischer Poesie aus altnordischer Zeit darstellt, welches sehr wohl verwendet wor-den sein kann, um einen Liebeszauber an einer Frau realiter durchzufu ̈hren.’’ Reichardt1939,484.167. Cf. Larrington1992and Heinrichs1997.168. Verbs indicating acts connected with written texts are notoriously equivocal, asthey are in English, e.g., ‘‘Itsaysin the newspaper that . . . ’’ On such verbs aslesaandheyra(and their possible synonymy), see Bjarni Gu1nason1977.169. On this point, see Brink2005. Commenting on nonelite and elite culturalspheres, Brink notes, ‘‘For hundreds of years (c.1100–1350) the two cultures lived side byside in Scandinavia, the oral culture with runic carvings for visual messages and thethingassembly as the focus and fundamental social arena, and the literacy culture with the Latinscript for visual messages and documentation, and the church as focus and fundamentalsocial arena’’ (118).

By ‘‘literature’’ in this instance, I refer primarily to the Old Icelandic sagas andeddas, but I consider a wide range of narrative materials, not only those that map easilyonto modern literary genres.2. Remnants of pagan superstitions are, of course, found in other traditions (e.g.,Anglo-Saxon poetry), but commenting on recently converted cultures, several authoritieshave noted the relative paucity of such materials. Thus, e.g., Hen1995,206, concludes,‘‘Merovingian society, although recently converted, was clearly a Christian society afterall, and the so-called ‘pagan survivals’ and ‘superstitions’ can be acknowledged as an insig-nificant and marginal part of its culture.’’ Similarly, Filotas2005,359, after canvassing theevidence of pastoral writings fromad 500to1000, estimates that some two thousandpassages survive that relate to pagan survivals and superstitions, concluding, ‘‘This is notmuch, considering the extent of time and expanse of space covered: over500years andmost of Western Europe.’’3. For an English-language orientation toFornsvenska legendariet, see Mitchell1996,15–16; on Saint Erik, see the commentary and translation in Sands2006.4. The original work dates to between1267and1307, but the termFornsvenskalegendarietcovers a number of related texts. For recent assessments, see Carlquist1996andHaugen and Johansson2009,20–23. Still very useful, despite their age, are Schu ̈ck1884and the comprehensive examination in Jansson1934.5. See, e.g., Andersson1964. We think first and foremost of the Icelandic sagas inthis regard, but such texts as Saxo’sGesta Danorumand the Old Swedish rhymed chroni-cles also figure in the construction of postmedieval pseudohistories. On the latter, seeJansson1971and Mitchell1996.6. Hermann2009, who examines the kinds of memory available and in evidence inthe Icelandic context and how memory factors into writing. Cf. Clunies Ross1998,83–85,including her view that in medieval Icelandic literature the past and the present form a‘‘meaningful and coherent historical continuum’’ (85)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"notes to pages 75–782397.

Strictly speaking, this title refers only to the poems in a single Icelandic manu-script, the Codex Regius of the Elder Edda (Gks2365,4to). Over time, similar poems havebeen added to the canon, so that, as Gunnell2005,82, writes, ‘‘The term ‘eddic poetry’essentially covers those anonymously transmitted ‘poems’ [...]that deal with the mythsand heroic world of the Nordic countries....’’Among these additional poems, particu-larly important in the current context areBaldrs draumar(Baldr’s Dreams, also calledVegtamskvi5a[Lay of Vegtamr]) and the poems known together asSvipdagsma ́l(Words ofSvipdagr), that is, theGro ́galdr(Magic of Gro ́a), andFjo\u0001lsvinnsma ́l(Words of Fjo\u0001lsvinnr),perhaps alsoHrafnagaldur O ́5ins(O ́5inn’s Raven-magic). Based on recently acquired manu-script testimony, Lassen (forthcoming) argues (pace earlier conclusions) that the poemrepresents an antiquarian enterprise built on such well-known sources asSnorra edda,rather the fourteenth-century text for which it has sometimes been taken.11. For an orientation to the eddic materials, see Gunnell2005, as well as the detailedreviews of scholarship in Harris1985and Lindow1985. For an expansive annotated bibli-ography, see Lindow1988.12. A point famously pursued by many scholars. Thus, e.g., a poem like8rymsqvi5a(The Lay of8rymr) can be understood as Christian propaganda in which the principalprotective god of the pagan pantheon,4o ́rr, is mocked by his dressing up like a bride. Inhis comprehensive study of the poem, de Vries1928concludes that the poem was com-posed in the thirteenth century. On dating the poems, see the comprehensive review inFidjestøl1999.13. On this point, and on the reception and use of these mythological materialsthroughout the entire medieval period, see Clunies Ross1998, esp.22–43.14. So, e.g., a work such as theSo ́larljo ́5(Song of the Sun), on which, see Attwood2005,61–62, and Amory1993.15. On modern scholarship’s predilection for creating its own smooth version of thematerials bequeathed to us by capriciously uneven preservation, see the enlightening andintellectually pugnacious comments in Leach1982.16. Given its heterogeneity,Ha ́vama ́lhas occasioned much debate, ranging fromthose who, like Lindquist1956, would reassemble the ‘‘original’’ poem, to von See1981,who sees an explicitly learned background to the poem (cf. von See1972). Very useful forits attempt to placeHa ́vama ́lin the context of similar ‘‘wisdom poetry,’’ such asGro ́galdr,is de Vries1934.17. St.139–41, Neckel and Kuhn1983,40.

Cau-tious perspectives (Tolley, for one, is by no means convinced of the comparison’s fullapplicability) come from among others, Georges Dume ́zil (1970), whose thesis about theIndo-European heritage of Norse mythology is clearly at risk in such a context. Perhapsthe most assertive rejection of the shamanic comparison comes from Fleck (1971a,1971b),who, based on a formal definition of ‘‘shamanism,’’ argues that none existed in Germanictradition. The work of Jens Peter Schjødt (e.g., Schjødt2001,2008) is very helpful insorting out these conflicting views: with his source-critical perspective, he cautiously ana-lyzes the materials and, although he allows for the possibility of shamanic influence, prin-cipally sees in these instances the numinous results of initiation. Thus, e.g., regarding thewisdom features ofVo\u0001luspa ́andBaldrs draumar, he writes, ‘‘It can be seen that they areboth variants of a structure and an imaginative world that has deep roots in pagan thoughtprocesses, in a way of thinking that is fundamentally foreign to Christianity, with itsrelationship between the living and the dead, with its emphasis on the feminine as asource of knowledge and its insistence upon O ́1inn himself needing to acquire knowledgefrom dead women’’ (Schjødt2008,223–24).18.

Coming from the philological direction, Preben MeulengrachtSørensen (Meulengracht Sørensen1977,1980, trans. into English as MeulengrachtSørensen1993,1983) was among the first to take a most directly anthropological approachto the Icelandic sagas.

In considering the use of sagas as historical sources and their potential for in-forming us about the periods in which they themselves were written, Jochens (1980,378)concludes that they will be inconsistent in both regards. See her further discussions in,e.g., Jochens1990,1993, and1996,9–10. Karras1988represents another important mile-stone in the restoration of the sagas’ status as historical sources. This newly won credulityhas its limits, however, as when, e.g., Jochens’s otherwise positive review of Dillmann2006opens with evident concern: ‘‘For many of the afficionados of the Icelandic familysagas who remain nostalgic for the days when these narratives could be read at face value—that is as evidence of conditions in ancient Iceland before the arrival of Christianity—thisbook will be greeted with enthusiasm.’’ Jochens2006,488.65. Most famously, Carlo Ginzburg’s remarkable1992investigation into the world-view of a sixteenth-century peasant burned for heresy. Other key players in formulatingthis interpretation of ‘‘history from below,’’ as it is sometimes called, include CliffordGeertz’s (1973) seminal essay on ‘‘thick description,’’ and the field of ethnohistory, onwhich, see the helpful survey in Chaves2008.

In Mitchell2001, I connect this term with ‘‘women’s calling songs.’’ Cf. Stro ̈m-ba ̈ck (1935,60), who suggests that this part of the scene, at least, should be viewed ‘‘medavgjord misstro.’’ Anticipating my comments below, it should be fairly apparent that Itoo regard the scene as an important source of information, although I am wary of takingeverything in it too literally.122. However one feels about the text’s authenticity, it is impossible to ignore: thus,e.g., Stro ̈mba ̈ck (1935,49–60) treats it with considerable finesse and concludes that theauthor must have had a good understanding of what he was writing about despite histendentiousness (‘‘I det stora hela har han varit va ̈l underra ̈ttad om hitho ̈rande ting . . . ’’60). The respectful treatment given the data in this episode in Dillmann2006,131–33,369,595, et passim, suggests that he too regards this information as reliable. Perhaps themost troubled among recent scholars by the scene inEirı ́ks saga rau5aare Raudvere (2003,122–24), who takes up this case, but does so, as she writes, ‘‘med viss tveckan’’ (122), onthe sensible grounds that it is all too often used as though it were an anthropologicaldescription of a ritual involving avo\u0001lva; and Tolley (2009,1:511–12), who devotes an entiresection to ‘‘the deceptive allure of verisimilitude.’’123.

Although much mined by scholars interested in historical matters, through hismany examinations ofSturlunga sagaU ́lfar Bragason has reminded us that these texts tooare narratives and susceptible to literary analysis. On this genre, see esp. U ́lfar Bragason2005and the literature cited there.125.Gu1ni Jo ́nsson1948,1:114.126. So Hallberg1993,616.127. Several entries in Boberg1966are misleading in this regard. ‘‘Troll-woman’’ isoften ambiguous as an abstract term but not always so in situ. Thus, inPrestssaga Gu5-mundar Arasonar, an episode designated by Boberg as G271.2.2.Witch exorcised by holywaterclearly concerns, not a witch, but rather a supernatural being closer to a giant.Likewise, the case of thegry ́la‘ogre’ inI ́slendinga saga—G219.8.1.Witch with fifteen tails.See the perceptive discussion in A ́rmann Jakobsson2009and the bibliography cited thereon this point.128. An independentHrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonaralso exists, in two versions, aswell as theSturlunga sagaversion,representing roughly half of the saga.

There is a neuter wordfarald, with a basic sense of ‘journey, that which travels’, and in modern Icelandicfaraldurmeaning ‘pestilence’ is attested, cf.L[exicon] P[oeticum],Fritzner, and Blo ̈ndal, s.v. TheSt[urlunga saga] reading has consequently been taken by some to give the right form ofthe name, glossed inL[exicon] P[oeticum]as ‘som farer om, især for at stifte ulykke’. Inthat casefer ek of aldar kynin the next line plays heavily on the name’s sense and form.’’The fact that the name is masculine would seem to lend weight to its association with‘plague, epidemic, pestilence’, as does the remainder of the verse, with its heavy connec-tion to death, disease, decay, and the morbid thought of ‘using’ corpses (on which theme,see Mitchell2008a). McGrew’s gloss of the appellation as ‘Far-traveler’ is justifiable basedon the non-Sturlunga sagamanuscripts. On the other hand,faraldurin modern Icelandicis attested as epidemic (umgangsveiki), as the correspondingfaraldrwas in Old Norse (cf.Nornfar, Norwegianfarsott, Danishfarsot) and is the form in at least one of the manu-scripts. Moreover, in addition to thefaraldrentry cited earlier in Gu1ru ́n Helgado ́ttirfromLexicon Poeticum, it is to be noted that the same work lists for neuterfarald, ‘‘egl.‘hvad der farer omkring, er almindeligt, rammer mange, især om smittende sygdomme,’ ’’Finnur Jo ́nsson and Sveinbjo ̈rn Egilsson1966,123. The association with tragic and wide-spread disease thus strikes me as much the likelier meaning here.132. Historically, the connection between the ‘‘Wild Hunt’’ (E501die wilde Jagd)and O ́1inn has been problematic (e.g., Ho ̈fler1934), and often rejected (e.g., de Vries1962), but can be adduced in the context of late medieval mythology. An enduring studyof this tale type, esp. in the context of specifically Scandinavian evidence, is Celander1943.133. On this motif, one widespread in Nordic church murals, and its origins in theBritish context, see Schmidt1995, esp.41–45.134. See, e.g., Russell1984and Wolf-Knuts1991on the various permutations of thisfigure in medieval theological and modern folklore traditions. In Mitchell2009a, I arguethat O ́1inn retained essential functions in Nordic charm magic well after the Conversion.135.

The wordbla ́implied a dark hue, variously translated as ‘black’ and ‘blue’,much like the English terms used in burnishing weapons (i.e., ‘to blue a gun barrel’). Thecurious belt4orbjo\u0001rg wears has occasioned much discussion, given the relative infrequenceand marked character of thehnjo ́sku-element (cf.fnjo ́skr, as well as modern Swedishfno ̈ske,fnas), usually translated as ‘touchwood’, indicating ‘‘wood or anything of woody nature,in such a state as to catch fire readily, and which can be used as tinder,’’ and further,‘‘The soft white substance into which wood is converted by the action of certain fungi,especially ofPolyporus squamosus, and which has the property of burning for many hourswhen once ignited, and is occasionally self-luminous.’’Oxford English Dictionary,2nd ed.,s.v. ‘‘touchwood.’’ This latter characteristic of self-luminescence, and perhaps the idea ofcombustive longevity as well, surely accounts for the fact that the belt is specified as beingcomposed of this material. In order to fabricate a belt of such insubstantial stuff, a ‘‘linkedbelt,’’ that is, a series of connected small plates, seems an obvious, and practical, fashionchoice.151. Cf.

Interest in the Old Swedish area has been especially keen in recent years. Mark-ing the beginning of this modern resurgence were the research surveys published severaldecades ago (Dahlba ̈ck1987b), the response to which may be seen in such recent antholog-ies as Bampi and Ferrari2008and studies such as Bampi2007, Layher2008, and Sands2010, all of which stand in contrast to the historical tendency for the East Norse area to beof interest only within national discourses. The Old Danish area too has lately witnessedinvigorating fresh perspectives (e.g., Hermann2007b) such that we begin to have a morecomprehensive image of cultural life throughout the Nordic area.158.

Cf. the comments and literature in Friis-Jensen2005a, Johannesson1978, andDavidson1980, as well as the essays in Friis-Jensen1981.159. This point has been a matter of some debate; see, e.g., Skovgaard-Petersen1981.On the question of Saxo’s worldview, see esp. Johannesson1978. By placing quotationmarks around ‘‘the same,’’ I intend to signal here that although Snorri and Saxo maydiscuss similar materials, they are no more copies of one another than when one Bosniansinger sings ‘‘the same’’ epic as another: the hero, the basic plotline, and so on may besimilar, and modern scholarship may provide both texts with the same title for the sakeof cataloguing, but that cannot be understood to mean that the narratives duplicate oneanother. See Mitchell and Nagy2000and esp. Lord2000. And importantly, as BjarniGu1nason1981,91, emphasizes, the relationship between Saxo and Icelandic traditions isby no means unidirectional, but rather reciprocal.160. ‘‘triplex quondam mathematicorum genus inauditi generis miracula discretisexercuisse prestigiis.’’ Friis-Jensen2005b,1:104(1:5,2).

Ejdestam1975refers to the phrase, but only in its common usage, but see thediscussion in Heide2006,235–40. Presumably the connection between spinning technol-ogy and foretelling future events explains the current reference. In an eighteenth-centurycollection of Swedish superstitions (Wikman1946), several use thread for purposes of,e.g., cursing (\u00041158) and protection against theft (\u00041228), and one (\u0004294) in a way thatwould appear to tie in with the myth of the milk-stealing witch, taken up below.

One of the best-known tales of medieval Western Europe, the story of Alexan-der was translated circa1380into Old Swedish asKonung Alexanderbut known already a"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"258notes to pages 115–117century earlier in Iceland asAlexanders saga. The Old Swedish rhymed version is based onthe proseHistoria de preliis Alexandri Magni, whereas the Old Icelandic prose translationbuilds on theAlexandreis.Konung Alexanderis connected with Bo Jonsson Grip (d.1386).See Pipping1943,77–79; Sta ̊hle1967,89–93; and Ronge1957. All references here are toKlemming1862. With respect to this image of the prophetic high magic sorcerer, alreadyin the early thirteenth century, the Icelandic monk, Gunnlaugr Leifsson (d.1218or1219),of4ingeyrar monastery, translated Geoffrey of Monmouth’sProphetiæ Merliniinto verseasMerlı ́nu ́spa ́([Merlin’s Prophecy] on which, see Frank1982and Marold1993). Gunnlaugrgenerally refers to Merlin with the nativespa ́ma5r‘prophet’ (e.g.spa ́r spakligar spa ́manns‘the prophet’s wise prophecies’; Finnur Jo ́nsson1973,2:11), the term most often also usedof biblical prophets, but sometimes he employs the calquepro ́feti. But even when thepoem uses this term and takes up learned forms of ‘‘magic’’ (e.g., vv.95–96ofMerlı ́nu ́spa ́II), nothing quite like the sense of the high magic practitioner one gets of the NectanabusofKonung Alexanderemerges from the poem. Gunnlaugr even goes so far as to describehim as being held dear by Christian people (kærr vas hann kyni / kristnu7jo ́5ar,v.2)!236. On the differences between high and low magic in the Middle Ages, see Russell1972,2–14, and Kieckhefer1989. A similar figure of this sort in the northern world maybe seen in Simon Magus, mentioned earlier.The Christian context of his story and of thesin associated with his name (simony), meant that Simon Magus, the court prestidigitator,was probably better, and earlier, known to the Nordic populations than either Merlin orNectanabus; cf. Flint1991,338–44.237. An additional narrative form that no doubt played an important role in theculture of late medieval Scandinavia in fashioning and disseminating images of witchcraftand magic was the ballad. Although there is much to be said about the tremendous, withrespect to both size and quality, Nordic ballad corpus, I do not take them up in detailhere for the simple reason that we do not have so much as a single complete ballad textfrom the Nordic Middle Ages. Good evidence for their existence exists, but what specificinformation they contained is impossible to know. I do not, as I have argued elsewhere(e.g., Mitchell2002b,2007a) subscribe to the view that the ballads were fixed texts frozenin time, allowing us to access the medieval form by citing the later transcriptions. Forintroductions to the Nordic ballad in its Danish context, see Colbert1989and Dahlerup1998,1:191–210,2:113–213. On the relations between the various Nordic genres, see Jonsson1991and Mitchell1991b, and on the same topic, with particular reference to the impor-tance of the later ballad evidence, see Mitchell2003a.chapter 41. Campbell1972. Concerned with the reception of the native mythological materialsin Christian Iceland, Clunies Ross1998,22–43, employs the same locution, ‘‘Myths tolive by,’’ to capture how pagan materials were reconfigured into an acceptable worldviewfor the emerging post-Conversion society. It is precisely in this sense of invented, renewed,actualized, and ‘‘narrativized’’ dogma andWeltanschauungthat I intend the phrase here."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"notes to pages 117–1202592. Highly enlightening on this point is Leach1982, who argues convincingly thatalthough myths are often ‘‘doctrinal, normative statements of belief,’’ they are never mereaffirmations of cultural hegemony, but can also be contentious articulations of difference.3. Malinowski1954,101, from comments originally published in1926.4. By ‘‘cultural competence,’’ I mean deep knowledge of a culture’s codes. ‘‘Culturalcompetence’’ was developed as a calque on the idea of linguisitic or communicative com-petence, as in, e.g., Hymes1972, and esp. the essays in Gumperz1982. Kellogg1991,96–97, extends the term to distinguish between articulated narrative matter in perform-ance versus an underlying knowledge of the signs that give it meaning.5. This component of witchcraft ideology has a long scholarly history: for orienta-tions, see ‘‘Teufelspakt’’ in Ba ̈chtold-Sta ̈ubli and Hoffmann-Krayer1987,3: cols.1842–43,and ‘‘Abschwo ̈rung’’ in1: cols.120–21. Synoptic reviews are offered in Rudwin1973;Seiferth1952; Nuffel1966; Lazar1972; Russell1984; and Boureau2006,68–92; on theevolution of demonologists’ thinking about thepactum cum diabolo,see Clark1997.6. Grimm (1966,3:1019) wonders whether such traditions ‘‘were taken over fromchristian stories of the devil, or had their ground in heathen opinion itself.’’ Rudwin(1973,169–70) argues that the story is ‘‘of Oriental origin,’’ having come from Persiansacred writings, and suggests an evolution from these origins through Jewish traditions(e.g., the Book of Enoch) to Christian belief.7. Several patristic writers touched on this issue, none more critically for futuredevelopments than Saint Augustine, whose ‘‘On the Divination of Demons’’ was to be-come key, especially as this treatment influenced the thinking of Thomas Aquinas inSumma Theologica(pt.2, quest.95, ‘‘Superstition in Divination’’). On this point, seeFleteren1999and the literature cited there.8. RegardingBasilı ́us saga, see following discussion; the translations in AM225fol.do not include the life of Saint Basil.

Many of the Northern European texts are printed in Dasent1845.11. Indeed, so significant is this consideration that it is placed third in a list oftwenty-eight errors. See Thorndike1944,261–66.12. Quoted in Bailey2003,37.13. A century later, Jean Bodin articulates this view in detail, suggesting that thedevil’s pact encompasses nine separate offences against God. Cf. Clark1997,675.14.

In translatinga quiggrinduas ‘witch-ride’, I am following,e.g., Lide ́n1914,413–16, whose argument would equate the phrase with such Icelandicterms astu ́nri5a. See the full discussion in Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:125–26. Almostall authorities agree that the term refers in some sense to the idea of the ‘witch-ride’.81. E.g., the runic phrase from Ro ̈k (ca.800)histrkunar(\u0002Gunn’s horse\u0002avalkyrie’s horse\u0002a wolf ); the famous wolf-mounted figure with snake-bridle on theHunnestad monument, Ska ̊rby parish, Ska ̊ne; the similar figure in the thirteenth-centuryprose that accompanies the eddicHelgaqvi5a Hio\u0001rvar5zsonar; and the ogress Hyrockinriding a wolf to Baldr’s funeral inSnorra edda, also composed in the thirteenth century.See, respectively, Brate1911,239–40; Jacobsen and Moltke1941–42,1: ills.677–78; Neckeland Kuhn1983,147; and Finnur Jo ́nsson1931,65. Not every observer interprets this tradi-tion in the same way; for an earlier generation of scholars, e.g., the image of the witch ona wolf was considered certain evidence of Hellenistic influence; see Linderholm1918a,115–17.82. Magnus1996–98,2:308–9.83.

On the witch-saint relationship, see Kieckhefer1994.85. Additional examples are examined in Jo ́n Hnefill A1alsteinsson1978.86. Already Linderholm1918a,29, viewed the situation largely along these lines: ‘‘Idet svenska Bla ̊kullamo ̈tet hava skilda fo ̈rkristna och medeltideskristna traditioner flutitsamman,’’ although he specifically suggests the witches’ sabbat as a legacy of female wor-ship within a phallocentric fertility cult dedicated to Freyr.87.

Other complications, such as preservation and the costs of mural painting, alsofactor into this problem. Post-Reformation traditions in Iceland about thesnakkurortilberi, e.g., suggest that they formed an important part of Icelandic witchcraft beliefs buthave left few traces in medieval sources, although perhaps alluded to in the phraseedamiolk fra monnumin Jo ́n4orkelsson and Jo ́n Sigur1sson1857–1932,2:224.

It is useful to bear in mind that these references are tomodern national borders. Thus, e.g., semiautonomous Gotland was part of the Swedishdiocese of Linko ̈ping but, following the fall of Visby to Valdemar Atterdag in1361, re-mained in Danish hands until1645.108. Wall1977–78,1:58.109. Thus, e.g., the economic argument laid out in Boyer and Nissenbaum1974.110. See Chapter1in this volume, and esp. the comment in Wax and Wax1962,183:‘‘We think of ourselves as the believers in causal law and the primitive as dwelling in aworld of happenstance. Yet, the actuality is to the contrary. . . . ’’111. I have noted this possibility in Mitchell2000b.112. Ellis2001,41. The term ‘‘ostension’’ is borrowed by folklorists from the field ofsemiotics, notwithstanding its venerable use in other fields (e.g., ‘‘ostensive definition’’).The meaning of the word—‘the act of showing; manifestation; revealing; appearance;display; monstrance’—and its etymology (Latinostendere‘to show’) underscore its rele-vance to the sort of situation under discussion. With respect to the applicability of ‘‘osten-sion’’ and ‘‘ostensive action’’ to folkloristics, see, in addition to De ́gh and Va ́zsonyi1983and Ellis1989, its use in Fine1991; Ellis2000,204,226,236,286–87; and Ellis2001, esp.165–85, ‘‘Ostension as Folk Drama.’’ I have applied this approach specifically to a nine-teenth-century case of witchcraft assault in Mitchell2004; see also Mitchell2000c.113. As this view has famously been summarized, ‘‘not only can facts be turned intonarratives but narratives can also be turned into facts.’’ De ́gh and Va ́zsonyi1983,29.Inhis discussion of contemporary ‘‘satanic’’ incidents in the United States, Ellis (1989,218)argues, ‘‘Traditional narratives [ . . . ] are also maps for action, often violent actions.’’ Anextreme case, but with sociological parallels to this argument, is presented in Nash1967.chapter 51.

So ̈derwall and Ljunggren1884–1973.5. The cognomen ‘‘gray goose’’ suggests several associations, particularly sexual, asOld Norse (and Modern Icelandic)ga ́scan refer to the female genitalia. Cf. Fritzner1973,‘‘Kvindens Avlelem eller Kjønsdele, lat.cunnus’’; Sigfu ́s Blo ̈ndal et al.1980, ‘‘de kvindeligeKo ̈nsdele.’’ It has been noted on several occasions that geese figure into Norse charmmagic—especially ‘‘love magic’’; see Mitchell1998. The association here with witchcraftthrough an individual’s epithet, although tenuous, is not unparalleled: e.g., Elin kattahie-rne in1477(Hildebrand1917,179); Gratrollit in1489(Carlsson1921–44,363; but cf. Lide ́n1933,323, ‘‘Det kan icke bli mer a ̈n en gisning, att ‘Gra ̊trollit’ befattat sig med trolldom’’);and Tyredh, Tyreth in1492(Almquist1930,23,36,49,50; cf.

Bagge characterizes these perspectives as follows: ‘‘Two main interpretations con-front each other. According to the first one [ . . . ] legislation in the strict sense of the wordwas not possible in the Middle Ages. The law existed from time immemorial and couldonly be ‘found,’ not made; i.e. any change or addition to existing rules had to be legitimisedby reference to what was believed to be ‘the good, old law.’ The adherents of the secondinterpretation argue that legislation in the old regional laws was understood as subject tohuman decisions and consequently was open to change in the real sense. Further, theymaintain that the idea of ‘the good, old law’ from time immemorial was introduced by themonarchy and the Church in order to change existing laws.’’ Bagge2001,73.8. Bagge2001,84–85.9. Cf. Hastrup1993.10. My comments here build on the argument laid out in Mitchell2004.11. Peters2001,189. Cf.

The value of the medieval Nordic laws as testimony to life in Northern Europehas been subject to a lively discussion, on which see Norseng1991, a reworked and ex-panded version of his earlier survey (Norseng1987); also helpful is Fenger1987. Withrespect to a topic like witchcraft, where gender plays such an important role, see alsoBjarne Larsson1992.13. For a critical review of earlier scholarship’s enthusiasm for plumbing the medievallaws in pursuit of earlier Germanic traditions, especially the sort of world Tacitus describesin hisGermania, see Sjo ̈holm1988,33–49, which synthesizes many of her earlier argu-ments (e.g., Sjo ̈holm1978), including her negative view of the possibilities for discoveringtextual ‘‘layers’’ in the laws. Although deeply influential, Sjo ̈holm’s views have not beenwithout criticism (e.g., Fenger1979), nor without parallels and predecessors (e.g., Wa ̊hlin1974). One fairly consistent line of objection is encapsulated by Norseng1991,157, whenhe protests, ‘‘Her narrow approach causes her to close her eyes to alternative suggestions....’’14. ‘‘Leges Danorum edite sunt.’’ Jørgensen1920,1:85. It should be noted, however,that the manuscript ofAnnales Ryensesdates only to circa1400. In addition to the muchvilified views associated with the Germanic school, the epistemological context for thespecific question of the means by which the medieval laws were known, passed on, anddelivered to assemblies belongs to a broader debate that has focused on the Icelandic sagas(often referred to by the terms,FreiprosaandBuchprosa), on which, see the assessments inChapter3, and in, e.g., Mitchell1991b,1–7et passim; Hermann Pa ́lsson1999a; Mitchell2003d; and Gı ́sli Sigur1sson2004,1–50. A recent treatment of the medieval Nordic laws,Jo ́nVi1ar Sigur1sson, Pedersen, and Berge2008, confidently remarks, ‘‘It is clear thatmedieval Nordic law was trasmitted orally long before it was written down’’ (39).15. Jakob Benediktsson1968,23. The Icelanders may have begun the practice alreadyin the late eleventh century with the tithe laws said to have been adopted in1095; seeFoote1987,55–56.16. Cf. Gı ́sli Sigur1sson2004,53–92.17. Taranger1926. Cf. Liedgren1982,231, whose remarks I am partly paraphrasinghere. The original sense oflaghsaghawas apparently ‘law recitation’, although over time itcomes to mean something closer to ‘judicial district’ (on its medieval origins, see Hafstro ̈m1982b). Cf. Pope Innocent III’s comment in a communication with the archbishop ofUppsala and his suffragan bishops from1206(Liljegren et al.1829–,1:156–57), whichseems to strengthen this view about the function of the assemblies. Sta ̊hle (1982,51) cap-tures the immediacy of the oral delivery presented in the medieval manuscript, as well asthe pivotal role of the lawman, when he writes, ‘‘I O ̈[stgo ̈talagen] ho ̈rs tydligt lagmannensro ̈st; lagen slutarNu a ̈r laghsagha i7ur lykta7ok ut sagh7. . . ’’ The typologyRechtsbuch—Gesetzbuchis most closely associated with Konrad von Maurer, whose scholarly produc-tion in this area (e.g., Maurer and Hertzberg1878) remains the source of both admirationand controversy."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"270notes to page 14918. E.g., Wiktorsson1981; Norseng1987,57; Sjo ̈holm1988; and Sunde2005, but inaddition to these more recent criticisms, already in1934, Nystro ̈m(1974,77), attacked theGermanic school’s romantic view of the Old Swedish laws by writing, ‘‘Dessa lagar, kla ̈ddai helt annan rationalistisk dra ̈kt a ̈n bondesamha ̈llets magiskt-religio ̈sa normva ̈rld, har intetillkommit fo ̈r att bevara bondera ̈tten utan fo ̈r att uppha ̈va den.’’19. ‘‘Landskapslagarnas Sverige befinner sig i brytningen mellan muntlig och skriftligkultur,’’ as So ̈derberg and Larsson1993,121, observe in their important study of diglossiaand literacy in the medieval Nordic world. The consequences of literacy for the Icelandiclegal system, and the power struggles resulting from its introduction, are carefully detailedin Gı ́sli Sigur1sson2004,53–92, which argues that ‘‘the tradition of oral learning re-mained strong at least into the13th century and was held to be of considerable importancein the world of politicsvis-a`-visthe new technique of writing that had been gainingground since early in the12th’’ (91).20. Concerning the complex issue of possible models for, and influences on, thesecular laws, see, e.g., Sjo ̈holm1976,1988; and Foote1977,1984. I find myself unsympa-thetic to Sjo ̈holm’s perception ofnedtecknandetas boogeyman, i.e., her position that muchof the problem derives from the assertion that earlier oral versions of the texts were atsome point transcribed (see her comments, Sjo ̈holm1988,37). Integral to her argument isthe view that the laws were composed at relatively late dates and mostly under otherinfluences than oral tradition. Still, on some points, it may be possible to agree, e.g., thatthe earliest laws are constructions that no doubt represent the interests of those sufficientlyrich and sufficiently powerful to have the written codes taken seriously (cf. Mitchell1996,10–13). At the same time, the testimony of the texts themselves about the convention ofthe so-calledlaghsagha‘law recitation’, the presentations made elsewhere in Nordic sourcesabout the laws, and the consistent references to thelo\u0001gma5r,lo\u0001gso\u0001guma5r, and so on cannotsimply be ignored and should also be fitted to the scheme, if only to suggest that suchaccounts may have been meant as propaganda tools during the medieval period itself.Misguided excesses in the past—an attempted reconstruction of a fully alliterative versionofUpplandslagenstands as a prime example—need not mean that everything associatedwith that position is easily dismissed, for as Sjo ̈holm (1988,38) herself notes, ‘‘Att ra ̈ttsut-vecklingen i stort ga ̊tt fra ̊n sedvanera ̈tt till skrivna lagar a ̈r visserligen ho ̈gst sannolikt.’’Where I differ with Sjo ̈holm’s otherwise practical point of view is in believing that, evenif we cannot know what the laws recited at thing-meets in the heathen period consistedof with absolute word-for-word clarity (i.e., that those who wrote the laws were somethingother than stenographers snatching words from the air and putting them on vellum), wecan, and do, know something about the general cultural framework within which suchrecitations took place. The classic study of the language of the laws in support of the viewthat there existed a tradition of oral delivery is Sta ̊hle1958, but von See (1964,84) believesthe alliterative patterns in the laws to be accounted for by the medieval fondness for thisfeature, especially in ecclesiastical contexts.21. E.g., Sjo ̈holm (1988,26) finds it necessary to write, ‘‘Allma ̈nt ga ̈ller att normernanaturligtvis refererar till en social verklighet, annars skulle de vara meningslo ̈sa.’’ Cf."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"notes to pages 149–150271Winberg1985,19–20. The many strands of this issue, which goes directly to the questionof just what sort of document a law from this period represents, are sometimes—ratherdismissively to my outsider’s eyes—lumped together as a question of legal positivism(rettspositivisme). This perspective has been characterized by Sunde2002,117, as ‘‘thetheory of law where one tends to focus on law as tied to, produced and applied by institu-tions according to proscribed procedures, and as formally made laws with a binding char-acter both for the legal subjects in general and the courts specifically.’’22. See Jo ́nVi1ar Sigur1sson, Pedersen, and Berge2008,42, and the literature citedthere.23. See the comments and reviews of literature in Halldo ́r Hermannsson1911; Knud-sen1982c; and Rindal1993, and the more specific remarks in Hødnebø1995,9–35. Oneof the best overviews of the development of the Norwegian laws in general remains Helle1964,36–44et passim, and on the laws of the Gula3ing specifically, Helle2001. Cf. Sunde2002. Within Icelandic historiography (i.e., in Ari inn fro ́1i’sI ́slendingabo ́k, from ca.1122–33; Jakob Benediktsson1968,6–7),Gula7ingslo\u0001gis said to have been the basis for theIcelandic legal codes passed at the Al3ingi inad 930.24. So, e.g.,Gula7ingslo\u0001g; not only are the normal codicological difficulties in play,but the principal manuscript also appears to be an amalgamation of two revisions of thelaws, a so-called O ́la ́fr-text (O ́la ́fr Haraldsson, king1015–28) and a so-called Magnu ́s-text(Magnu ́s Erlingsson, king1161–84). Cf. Fenger1987.25. I have generally relied on the dating in Norseng1991, as well as judgments byspecialists in such areas as palæography (e.g., Rindal1983), keeping in mind Norseng’scautionary remark (1991,16) that such datings are based on very old research that has notbeen recently evaluated. The newly established Nordic Medieval Laws project (directedby Stefan Brink) will, one hopes, bring some much-needed clarity to this problem.26. The reality of this situation has been the subject of much discussion in thematerials from the early modern period (e.g., Briggs1996b); reputations mattered, andlegal action against accused witches often came after, and in response to, years of rumors(cf. Macfarlane1991). Tracing the development of such antagonisms within a communityis naturally much easier in the modern period (cf. Mitchell2000c,2004), but that thesame basic blueprint would have been true in the medieval period does not seem to metoo great a leap of faith.27. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, Norway was divided into four legal districts:Gula3ing in the west, Fro\u0001stu3ing in the more northerly area around modern-day Trond-heim, Ei1sifa3ing in the inland east, and Borgar3ing in Oslofjord. The laws may havebeen written down already in the late eleventh century, although the oldest completemanuscripts date only to the thirteenth century.

The meaning ofra ̈tlo ̈sa, f., has been widely discussed; despite vari-ous ingenuous suggestions, the interpretation first offered by Schlyter continues to be thestandard:ra ̈ttlo ̈shet,laglo ̈shet,ora ̈tt. See the discussion in Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:114–17. Old Swedishbalker/bolka ̈r(Modern Swedishbalk) ‘section’ is used for the vari-ous divisions in all the Old Swedish laws, e.g., the inheritance section, the section oninjuries, and so on.33. This sort of vignette is a characteristic rhetorical device in the Old Swedish laws,which delight in providing examples, often with considerable detail.34. It has been suggested by some that the phrase does not necessarily imply ridingin the sense that the gate is moving or flying but—as indicated by an intense investigationof dialect forms and regional praxis in southwestern Norway—rather perhaps that shesimply sits astride the gate. See Lide ́n1914, as well as the counterargument in Linderholm1918b,141–42. Pipping1915,68–71, arrives at the same conclusion as Lide ́n but gets thereby way of an interesting sexual image:kvi7er, m. ‘kved, moderliv’ andgrind,f.‘o ̈ppning,springa’ (cf. the verbgrina‘sta ̊isa ̈r, gapa’); thus,apertura uterina,cunnus, indicating, asthe editors delicately phrase it, ‘‘den kroppsdel, pa ̊vilken kvinnan vilade, da ̊hon redgrensle.’’ Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:126.

I have explored the issue of Nordicwitchcraft and liminal space in Mitchell2005. In folklore, liminal spaces such as gates and"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"notes to pages 152–153273other passageways are often portrayed as openings into the Otherworld (e.g., F91.Door[gate] entrance to lower world;F59.3Gate to upper world), and along the same lines, cross-roads are also often associated with magical abilities (cf. D1768.Magic power at cross-roadsand related subtypes, where a wide array of supernatural creatures—ghosts, fairies, andparticipants in the Wild Hunt—both gain and lose power), the point being that theseexplicitly ‘‘betwixt-and-between’’ areas are widely believed to be magically significant.

It should be noted, how-ever, that Icelandic,gjo ̈r5(f. pl.gjar5ar), in addition to the sense of ‘girdle’, ‘belt’, alsomeans ‘a kind of lady’s head-gear, in western Icel. a kerchief wrapped round the head’(Cleasby and Vigfusson1982); perhaps this change in the younger law does not add newinformation but rather amplifies the original ‘loose-haired’. Cf. Horace’s use in the contextof a prayer to Venus (CarminumLiber1:xxx) ofsolutis Gratiae zonis, ‘with loose-girdledGraces’. The similarity of the Latin image to the Old Swedish phrase may suggest anenduring representation across time and space of voluptuousness, promiscuity, and so onin this association. See Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:125–26and n.40in this chapter.40. There is a long tradition in Western thinking about women’s hair and sensuality.See, e.g., Stevenson2001,140: ‘‘A woman’s long hair, pinned up neatly and covered wasseen as indicative of virtue, which (literally) distinguished her from loose (haired) womenas well as from men; witches, e.g., have usually been depicted pictorially as having wildand unkempt hair. Unpinned, tumbling or dishevelled, hair is infused with sexual power.’’41. Schlyter1822–77,7:79.42. Cf. Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:xcii–xcvi.43. Cf. Falk1924. This phrase is found in other Old Swedish laws (e.g.,So ̈dermanna-lagen) and continues to be used up throughSwerikes Rijkes Stadz Laghof1613.44. ‘‘æller kallær go3æ kono horkono. skykiu. trollkono æller fordæ3u.’’ Schlyter1822–77,6:127.

Recent assessments have sounded a less unassailable note. See the detailed discus-sion in Norseng1991,141–42, which concludes, ‘‘It is uncertain to what extent the stipula-tions in the surviving laws of independent Iceland are derived fromHafli5askra ́.’’48. An old version of the Norwegian Fro\u0001stu3ing laws was referred to asGra ́ga ́s(Rindal1993,385), and the name later came to be used as a collective title for the Icelandiclaws: ‘‘Navnets oprindelse kendes ikke; det forekommer for første gang pa ̊en inventarlistefra bispestolen i Ska ́lholt i1548.’’ O ́lafur La ́russon1982a,410.49.

I make this assertion realizing that unmarked Old Norsema5r‘man; people’ andso on (cf.mannkyn‘mankind’) includes females, but as the laws often go out of their wayto specify categories of maleness and femaleness, this wording does not appear to beinclusive.55. Cf. the remark by one Danish scholar bemoaning the scant legal evidence fromactual cases, although one senses that his comments have broader application: ‘‘We areleft with the fact that, as far as Denmark is concerned, we do not know, owing to the lackof sources, how the courts dealt with the crime before the sixteenth century.’’ Johansen1993,339.56. At a recent research seminar at Aarhus Universitet, Per Andersen argued, basedon the index of the older code, that this section, or something like it, was in fact part ofthe original thirteenth-century law.57. ‘‘Forgiør mand konne eller konne mand eller konne konne med troldom ellerandre forgiøringer, saa at hun eller hand døer deraff, da schall mand steyles och konne"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"notes to pages 154–155275brendes, om schellige widne ere till.’’ Kroman1951–61,4:338. The precise measure meantbysteyle,stegla, and so on has been much debated and may not have been carried out inthe same way in every region. What it certainly meant was that the individual was torturedbefore his inevitable, and public, demise. See the discussion and bibliography in Meyer1982, as well as Merback1999,158–97.58. ‘‘Kona firigær manni. fællir hana lukt hærasznæmd.3a skal hun haua gri3tilskogs. dax ok nattær.3a skal latæ do ̈mæ hanæ. vgill. firi arva. ok eptimælændæ ok dræpæ3ær næst.’’ Schlyter1822–77,1:22.

Several attempts to forge a national law code were made in Norway under kingsMagnu ́s Erlingsson, Ha ́kon Ha ́konarson, and Magnu ́sHa ́konarson. A national law, withsome regional variations, was finally adopted by1276(see Rindal1993; cf. Keyser andMunch1846–95,2:1–178). The Icelandic Commonwealth had been ruled by a variety oflaws (e.g.,Kristinn re ́ttr forni) called in modern times by the collective titleGra ́ga ́s. Withthe loss of independence to Norway (1262–64), the Icelanders were briefly governed bythe laws calledJa ́rnsı ́5a(1271–81), and then by a long-lasting and oft-amended code calledJo ́nsbo ́k; see Fix1993. Following the writing of the numerous Swedish provincial laws, anational law (Magnus Erikssons Landslag) was written circa1350and revised in1442asKristoffers Landslag. A corresponding municipal code (Magnus Erikssons Stadslag) was alsocomposed in the mid-fourteenth century. Although among the earliest Nordic countriesto record its laws, as one expert notes, ‘‘Except for coronation charters, peace regulations,and privileges for the towns, Denmark in the late Middle Ages is deficient in laws.’’ Fenger1993,384. Not until the early sixteenth-century attempts by King Kristian II (1521–22)dowe see a comparable attempt to create a national law code.75. Keyser and Munch1846–95,2:495.76. Keyser and Munch1846–95,1:434, one of the so-called Christian laws (KongSverrers Chistenret), with which the passage has an obvious strong relationship.77. Cf. Russell1972,23,50et passim; and Morris1991,155–69.78. See the entries under G11.3.Cannibal witchin Boberg1966. Obviously, the factthat such creatures appear in the sagas need not mean that they too could not have beenborrowed from a variety of literary and encyclopedic sources (cf. my comments on‘‘Learned Lore’’ in Mitchell1991b,73–88), but given the totality of such presentations inNordic literature and lore, viewing such monsters as part of the native Northern European‘‘fiend kit’’ seems to be an excellent fit with the ‘‘law of parsimony.’’79. See the insightful remarks in Kiessling1968.80. That is, in relation to other statutes addressing witchcraft: elsewhere, the lawsuse this image of burial—or, more closely, disposal—of the bodies of executed evildoerson the seashore and so on in other special cases, such as suicide. Cf. Keyser and Munch1846–95,1:13,391–92,431;2:296,314,330. See also the cases ofDalalagenandVa ̈stmannala-gen(The Law of Va ̈stmanland) later in this volume.81. On the explanation of the seemingly truncated7a ̈tta ̈a ̈r bardagha ̈, see Holmba ̈ckand Wesse ́n1979,5:63.82. The nature of the law itself remains more or less as it had been in many of theprovincial laws: ‘‘Forgo ̈rma3er manne ællæ kunu, kona kunu ællæ manne, me3trulldomællæ andrum forgerningum, sua æt han ællæ hon faar do ̈3af, miste liif sit for3olika"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"notes to pages 157–158277gerning; man skal stæghla ok kunu stena, ok viti3etme7hæræz næmd sum fo ̈r ær sakt.’’Schlyter1822–77,10:276, and ‘‘Bær kona ællæ man forgerninga manne, var3er bar okatakin,3a skal hona take ok i fiætur sætia ok sua til3ings fo ̈ra, ok3e samu forgerningame7hænne [ . . . ] fælla3e hona,3a a hon bale brinna . . . ’’ Schlyter1822–77,10:281–82.Along the same lines, a few years later, the municipal laws are also codified asMagnusErikssons Stadslag, often mirroring the organization and language of the national law. Thisis certainly true of the witchcraft statutes in itsHo ̈ghma ̈lisbalker, which again are placedamong the same most serious threats known to society. Cf. Schlyter1822–77,11:285,323–24.83. ‘‘Um troldoom. Aff man witær annæn. at han hauær fforgørth. aff hans mæthtroldoom. oc gangær han æi with. thær sæktæth war. num dyl. oc føør hin thz hanumahand. thærsækthær. tha wæri han sik. thærsaak giuæs mæthnæfnd i kirki sokæn. bathæffor hin thær sæktær. oc swo fforæ biscop.’’ Brøndum-Nielsen, Jørgensen, and Buus1920–42,2:506. The Jutlandic materials are sometimes held to have been intended as a nationalcode, as opposed to the Scanian and Sealandic laws, which are thought to have been morefor the private use of powerful individuals, on which, see Jo ́nVi1ar Sigur1sson, Pedersen,and Berge2008.84. Personal communication with Per Ingesman, May2009. See, e.g., Fenger1983;Foote1977and1986.85. Schlyter1822–77,12:302.86. Explaining the curious appearance in this list of what is otherwise simply aninsult, Schlyter comments ‘‘ett oqva ̈dinsord som tillkommit genom misfo ̈rsta ̊nd af o. hæri-ansun,’’ tying the word back to the phraseherriæns son‘son of Herjann’ inA ̈ldre Va ̈stgo ̈tala-genand elsewhere. See n.43in this chapter.87. Schlyter1822–77,12:403. The remedy in1442for a false accusation includes afine, public confession of lying, striking oneself on the mouth, and walking backwardaround the meetinghouse (gange baaklenges af tingzstugu).88. The genre divisions among the many different types of church materials areanything but clear-cut, but by ‘‘normative,’’ I mean here principallyjus ecclesiasticum,inessence, all directives adopted by the ecclesiastical authorities. But beyond the more obvi-ous items (e.g., penitentials), I also have in mind such materials as the variouskirkiubalker,kristinsdo ́msba ́lkr, and so on, that is, the church laws, with which so many of theprovincial and national law codes open.89. It is useful to recall that despite modern regard for subtle distinctions within themagical world, the church tended not to promulgate such taxonomies, but rather theopposite, that is, to group them together as heresy. As Edsman1982b,661, rightly notes,‘‘Fo ̈r medeltida teologi a ̈r det icke na ̊gon grundla ̈ggande skillnad mellan ha ̈xeri, t[roll-dom], och magi. De tre begreppen fa ̊r tillsammans ocksa ̊karakta ̈ren av ka ̈tteri . . . ’’ Cf.Haack1939a,1939b.90.

In the Icelandic Commonwealth, two forms of outlawry were common: lesseroutlawry (fjo\u0001rbaugsgar5r), which was punishable by a three-year exile from Iceland and theconfiscation of property, and full outlawry (sko ́ggangr), punishable by permanent exile,the loss of property, the denial of inheritance rights to children, disqualification for burialin hallowed ground, and deprivation of the law’s protection, that is, he could be killedanywhere by anyone.

The disposition of manuscript B54of Kungliga Biblioteket, Stockholm, hasbecome a celebratedtvistfra ̊ga‘bone of contention’ within Swedish historiography. Thatit is a fourteenth-century legal document in Old Swedish is about all that is agreed on:there is general consensus that this document represents a law with application in a Swed-ish district somewhere broadly west of modern Stockholm, although whether that districtwas Dalsland, Dalarna, Va ̈stmanland (in which case, this law would be perhaps best un-derstood as an early version ofVa ̈stmannalagen), or, as has most recently been suggested,Va ̈rmland, has been the subject of much discussion. Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,2:xiii–xxiv, provides a thorough review of the evidence and theories (see also Hafstro ̈m1982a);Wesse ́n1964,17, lays out the argument for why, despite the age of the manuscript, thetext may, in fact, be quite old; however, these perspectives are challenged by the ingeniousargument of Sjo ̈holm1988,321–31, that B54be understood in the context of the earlyfourteenth-century semiautonomous region established by Dukes Erik and Valdemar intheir struggle against King Birger. Erik and Valdemar sought to build a (mainly) westSwedish area united with Norway, and Sjo ̈holm reasons that these historical conditions,together with some of the similarities ofDalalagento Norwegian legal tradition, accountfor B54: ‘‘Slutsatsen blir att B54a ̈renVa ̈rmlandslag.’’ Sjo ̈holm1988,329.133.‘‘War3ir kuna takin me3truldom. me3horn oc haar quict oc do ̈t3æt ma weltruldom heta . . . ’’ Schlyter1822–77,5:10.134.

A similarjudgment for witchcraft is made in one of the emended versions ofGula7ingslo\u0001gand isdeemed appropriate for other selected crimes in the Norwegian laws. Among Old Swedishlaws, this punishment appears only inDalalagenand for the theft of crops inVa ̈stmanna-lagen.136. It is also known asThe Law of Tio District, apparently referring to the ‘‘ten’’(tio) regions that made up thislaghsagha. Cf. the reference to the district in a letter of1266aslegifer decem provinciarum, Liljegren et al.1829–,1:437. On this law, see Hafstro ̈m1965; Holmba ̈ck and Wesse ́n1979,5:lxxv–lxxxiv; and Sjo ̈holm1988,90. Cf.

The semantic range of coordinating conjunctions, most famouslyen, is broad in the older Nordic dialects; translatingocin both instances as ‘or’ mightyield better sense in English.138. The alliterative phraseinnæn garz oc grindæ(alt.,innan gardz ok grindhaand soon) is widely used in Old Swedish, probably comparable in its traditionality (althoughnot in its meaning) to a fixed phrase such as ‘‘over hill and dale’’ in English.Gar7erimplies both that which encloses as well as that which is enclosed, that is, both fence andprotected space. Englishyardandgardenare related terms. In West Norse,grindsimilarlymeans that which encloses as well as that which is enclosed (in the plural), that is, bothgate and pen, although I have found no irrefutable evidence for this polysemy in OldSwedish.

Henningsen’s (1992) critique ofJohansen and the need to distinguish carefully between different kinds of magic and theirpractitioners are appropriate here as well, but there is little likelihood that the medievalmaterials will yield themselves to that level of scrutiny. Cf. Edsman1982b,661.160. There are two exceptions to this principle, the Greenlandic burning of Kol-grı ́mr in1407, insofar as the case involves sexuality, although the outcome conforms tothe pattern, and the burning of the nun at Kirkjubær in1343, where both the accusationand the punishment resembles the pattern for males.161. ‘‘Preterea in mulieres ob eadem causa simili immanitate barbari ritus damnatasquicquam impietatis faciendi uobis fas esse nolite putare. sed potius discite diuine ultionissententiam digne penitendo auertere. quam in illas insontes frustra feraliter seuiendo. iramDomini multo magis prouocare.’’ Afzelius et al.1938–, ser.1,2:43.162.

I translatekirkiagardenas ‘the churchyard’, but it also implies thechurch cemetery. The choice of adverbs invites speculation:ansylis(Modern Swedishan-syls, but also without fronting—ansols) is used here, as with Old Norseandsælis, to mean‘against the sun’, ‘withershins’, and the context of this word is almost always related towitchcraft or magic. Cf. the Swedish laws’ remedy for false accusation in1442, whichincludes ‘‘walking backward’’ (gange baaklenges) around the meetinghouse but notably notansylis‘withershins’.

Because Fogelklou Norlind tended to endorse Mar-garet Murray’s thesis of holdover pagan cults, her views do not today receive much atten-tion, but her opening sentence will give a broad impression of how forward looking herthinking and, indeed, even her vocabulary were: ‘‘Frista ̊ende kvinnor, som icke genomdet patriarkalt kyrkliga a ̈ktenskapet underordnades mannen eller genom klosterkulturensnya bildningstyp sta ̈lldes utanfo ̈r moderskapet, beho ̈llo under medeltiden na ̊got av typenpra ̈stinna eller ‘klok kvinna’, utan att i popula ̈ruppfattning degenereras till den asocialakarakta ̈r som betecknas med orden sko ̈ka och ha ̈xa.’’ Norlind1942,180[‘‘Independentwomen, who were not subjugated to men through the patriarchal church’s [institution of]marriage or who were not placed outside of motherhood through the new model of thecloister culture, retained something of the priestess or ‘wise woman’ type, without inpopular thought degenerating into the asocial character designated with the words ‘prosti-tute’ and ‘witch’ ’’].3.Daly1978;Larner1987;Labouvie1990; Clark1991;Hester1992;Oja1994;Brauner1995. With respect to gender, witchcraft in early modern Scandinavia generallyfollows the trends elsewhere. Iceland is a famous exception, where overwhelmingly menwere executed rather than women (involving, however, very small numbers, twenty menand one woman), on which, see Hastrup1993and O ́lı ́na4orvar1ardo ́ttir2000. On thesimilar Finnish situation, see Nenonen1992(with an English summary), Nenonen1993,and Heikkinen and Kervinen1993.4. E.g., Morris1991; Jochens1991and1996; cf. Dillmann2006, as well as Mitchell2000b, on which some of these comments are based. Morris1991, e.g., employs literary,linguistic, and legal iconography from throughout the Germanic world to argue for anevolution from the beneficial sorceress figure portrayed in Tacitus and other early writersto the later diabolical witch stereotype, seeing her book as ‘‘a kind of case study on howthe change in the medieval religiousWeltanschauung(from pagan to Christian) affectedthe role of women and magic’’ (7).5. Jochens1996,130–31; cf.124: ‘‘Although men were clearly active and in a few casesequal to women, their overall performance was weaker, thus suggesting that they werelatecomers and that their complete integration into the profession of magic was not yetcomplete.’’6. In addition to Morris and Jochens, Dillmann (2006) suggests a particular confi-dence in the sagas in this regard.7. E.g., Price2002; Solli2002.8. On this proverb, see Mitchell2005. The usual Danish locution wasOnth qwinneær helwedz dørs nafflæ‘‘An evil woman is Hell’s door nail’’.9.

Cf. the accusa-tion that Ælseby would like her husband dead. Ælseby’s profile elsewhere in the townrecords (Noreen and Wennstro ̈m1935–,1:243,324) makes her appear a stereotypical quar-relsome figure who would easily fit the profile of an accused witch.18.

In this vision of what was to be a new and humane prison, solidwalls between cells set in a ringlike structure would isolate and block communicationbetween prisoners, while at the same time the backlit cells would allow guards in a second,interior tower at the center of the ring of cells, that is, in the Panopticon, to observe fullyand at all times each prisoner.

Stockholm’s Bloodbath represents the apogee of the ongoing struggle by Swedento leave the Union of Kalmar. The various political, ecclesiastical, and economic factorsthat lead to the event are complex and open to interpretations, perspectives that generallylay the blame on either the Danish king and his advisors or the Swedish archbishop,GustavTrolle.Inbrief,intheautumnof1520, following an agreement between theSwedes and the Danes and the accession to the Swedish throne by Kristian II, more thaneighty individuals, mainly Swedish noblemen, clerics, and leading citizens, were executedbased on charges of heresy. This incident precipitated the revolt that finally led to aseparate Swedish kingdom by1523, under the rule of Gustav Wasa.90. Witchcraft and heresy made for a convenient accusation ‘‘kit,’’ the medievalequivalent of contemporary accusations of lesbianism and witchcraft in contested childcustody cases. Thus, e.g., Joan of Arc’s English captors charge her with a variety of mis-deeds, including dressing like a man, heresy, and minor sorcery. All of these chargescontributed to, and reflect, the view that she and her career were at cross-purposes withnature and with established order. See, e.g., Warner1981,101–4.91. Cf. Stro ̈mba ̈ck1935,194–96.92. Cf. Apps and Gow2003,118–37.epilogue1. ‘‘cum quidam captiuorum torturæ subiectus confessus esse dicatur400ex obsessispactum cum Diabolo fecisse.’’ From a letter in Riksarkivet (1634-06-01Reg. nr.4141),published in Sonde ́n et al.1888–. I have also remarked on this case in Mitchell2008b.2.Cf.Purkiss1996and her consideration of the ‘‘dialogue’’ within the torturechamber.3. On the great Swedish witch-hunt of1668–76, see esp. Ankarloo1983,1984; Lager-lo ̈f-Genetay1990; Ankarloo1993; Lennersand1997; and Tegler1997.

Knutsen2003, who, pace Næss1982, finds the incidence of the pact tobe high. Cf. Næss1983,1984, and1990.6. This anomaly has given rise to a number of theories, on which see Hastrup1993,as well as O ́lı ́na4orvar1ardo ́ttir2000,175–84, esp. the degree to which Sveinn lo ̈gma1rSo ̈lvason appears to be an exception to the general thrust of events in Iceland.7. ‘‘lo ̈nlika a ̈ggiande til synd a ̈lla ka ̈ttara oc otrona villara villande mz falsom ka ̈nne-dom. lifwom troldom oc dya ̈fwls galdrom . . . ’’ Klemming, Geete, and Ejder1879–,2:85.8.

I translatefforredelsæ/ffo ̈rra ̈dhilsein both instances as ‘treason’, but note that the terms also encompassthe less political ‘treachery’.11. ‘‘O ha ̈rra gudh ihesus christus . . .

On these trials, see Chapter5in this volume, where, aselsewhere (Mitchell2000b), I have argued that several trials that do not specifymaleficium,trolddom, and so on should nevertheless be included in the tally, a factor that, if accepted,would of course increase the percentage.13. ‘‘Um troldoom.

In asserting the broad similarities on either side of the Reformation dividing line,I do not intend to mask the real differences that also existed. Kallestrup2009closelycompares the handling of witchcraft cases in Italy and Denmark, showing, among otherthings, how relatively humane the supposedly brutal Inquisition was in comparison withthe treatment of the accused in Denmark.17.

I am equally (at the least) indebted tothe supportive and invigorating research environment of the University ofAarhus, Denmark, and especially its Nordic Institute and Centre for Vikingand Medieval Studies; colleagues there were of immeasurable help as I com-pleted this project, listening to ideas and, in return, offering advice, support,and cheerful debate.In addition, I have over the years received critical research assistancefrom Kungliga Gustav Adolfs Akademien, Uppsala; Stofnun A ́rna Magnu ́sso-nar, Reykjavı ́k; Uppsala universitetsbibliotek; Kungliga Biblioteket, Stock-holm; Det Kongelige Bibliotek, Copenhagen; Sveriges medeltidapersonnamn (Institutet fo ̈r spra ̊k och folkminnen), Uppsala; Antikvariskt-"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"368acknowledgmentstopografiska arkivet, Stockholm; Stockholms stadsarkiv; Riksantikvariea ̈mbe-tet, Stockholm; Landsarkivet i Vadstena; Svenska Akademiens Ordbok; Stats-biblioteket, A ̊rhus; the British Library, London; the Public Records Office,London; and, of course, my own home collection, Widener Library. For theirhelp, I thank all of these great and generous institutions, their archivists, andtheir librarians; moreover, a number of local historians, church warders, par-ish priests, and parishioners have good-naturedly helped me gain access totexts, traditions, and a variety of ‘‘photo ops.’’ I could not have learned muchwithout their help. I express additional thanks to Kungliga Gustav AdolfsAkademien for its assistance in subsidizing the publication of this book.In working with the diverse materials at the heart of this study, I haveoften been reminded of my debt to a number of teachers, particularly AlanDundes, Go ̈sta Holm, Lauri Honko, and Lars Lo ̈nnroth. The insightful com-ments by several anonymous readers for the University of Pennsylvania Presshave helped shape the final product in important ways, and I thank them fortheir insight, care, and courtesy, a point I would make about a number ofexperts in the field who have been gracious in their exchanges with me overthe years, especially Owen Davies, Franc ̧ois Xavier Dillman, Carlo Ginzburg,Neil Price, Catharina Raudvere, and Clive Tolley. Three very gifted youngpeople, Maria Bjo ̈rg A ́gustsdo ́ttir, Kaitlin Heller, and Casiana Ionata, assistedme as research assistants during their undergraduate years at Harvard College.And finally, among many other colleagues and friends, I am grateful to AgnesArno ́rsdo ́ttir, Stefan Brink, Ju ̈rg Glauser, Kaaren Grimstad, Terry Gunnell,Jens Peter Schjødt, and Gı ́sli Sigur1sson, and especially Pernille Hermannfor their warm encouragement, sagacious advice, and much-appreciated colle-giality—and, in some cases, for reading parts (or all) of various iterations ofthis study; needless to say, the flaws that remain are certainly mine, not theirs.But most of all, I want to thank more than a few of my closest colleagues forputting aside, if all too briefly, scholarly matters and simply being friends,making time to goı ́vei5itu ́ror on a fact-finding mission about the relativemerits of Wisby Klostero ̈l andGotlandsdricka."}]
