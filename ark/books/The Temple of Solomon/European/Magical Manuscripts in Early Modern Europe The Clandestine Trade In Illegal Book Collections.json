That is the goal of New Directions in Book History. This series will publish monographs in English that employ advanced methods and open up new frontiers in research, written by younger, mid-career, and senior scholars. Its scope is global, extending to the Western and non-Western worlds and to all historical periods from antiquity to the 21st century, includ-ing studies of script, print, and post-print cultures. New Directions in Book History, then, will be broadly inclusive but always in the van-guard. It will experiment with inventive methodologies, explore unex-plored archives, debate overlooked issues, challenge prevailing theories, study neglected subjects, and demonstrate the relevance of book history to other academic fields. Every title in this series will address the evolu-tion of the historiography of the book, and every one will point to new directions in book scholarship. New Directions in Book History will be published in three formats: single-author monographs; edited collec-tions of essays in single or multiple volumes; and shorter works produced through Palgrave’s e-book (EPUB2) ‘Pivot’ stream. Book proposals should emphasize the innovative aspects of the work, and should be sent to either of the two series editors.Editorial board: Marcia Abreu, University of Campinas, Brazil; Cynthia Brokaw, Brown University, USA; Matt Cohen, University of Texas at Austin, USA; Archie Dick, University of Pretoria, South Africa; Martyn Lyons, University of New South Wales, Australia.More information about this series at http://www.springer.com/series/14749"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Daniel Bellingradt · Bernd-Christian OttoMagical Manuscripts in Early Modern EuropeThe Clandestine Trade In Illegal Book CollectionsIncluding a critical edition of a ‘catalogus rariorum manuscriptorum’ from 1710."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Daniel BellingradtInstitut für Buchwissenschaft Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, GermanyBernd-Christian OttoMax Weber Centre for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies Universität Erfurt Erfurt, GermanyNew Directions in Book HistoryISBN 978-3-319-59524-5 ISBN 978-3-319-59525-2 (eBook)DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-59525-2Library of Congress Control Number: 2017944567© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017This work is subject to copyright.

When he heard of my interest in the study of magic, he mentioned a strange book trade cata-logue that he had encountered during his doctoral studies. He emailed me images of the four pages on the same day, and we loosely agreed to write a journal article on the catalogue. The project gathered speed about 1 year later, when I discovered that the collection advertised in the catalogue survives until this day in Leipzig University Library. We have since then worked on our ‘article’, which eventually grew into the pre-sent book.‘Interdisciplinarity’ is an often-evoked buzzword in modern academia, but only seldom brought to its full potential in the humanities. In fact, scholars in the humanities, particularly historians, tend to remain soli-taries, focused on their niche areas, and published by their lonesome. Against this backdrop, the collaboration with Daniel was rewarding and inspiring, as we both come from completely different areas, had to learn the other’s language and thinking, and also cope with all sorts of disagreements which forced us to think ‘outside of our box’ and adjust our own interpretations. In our view, interdisciplinarity only gets off the ground when one is forced to compose texts together and thereby engage in a two-angled analysis of the same material, whereby each of the two angles enriches the other. The findings presented here are the result of this form of collaboration, and neither of us would have been able to present similar findings without the aid and mind of the other."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"vi PREFACEThe order of authors given on the title page does therefore not indicate lead authorship or intellectual priority but is purely alphabetical.

OTTOGerman-speaking Europe, and moreover the earliest collection of German translations of such texts. In his ambition to sell his collection of “indexed books,” as a contemporary voice put it, Schröer initiated the publication of a printed anonymous book trade catalogue entitled “CATALOGUS RARIORUM MANUSCRIPTORUM”. The original print-run of this catalogue, comprising four pages in quarto, had been done in Augsburg by the local printer-publisher Paul Kühtze, who also acted as a shadowy selling agent of the collection. The Leipzig-Augsburg networking was successful in 1710, when both the collection and the catalogue avoided short-term censorship attention, and a buyer success-fully acquired the manuscripts.In this book we intend to: (1) enlarge this story to a case study on the practices and features of clandestine activities of the early modern European book markets; (2) identify and contextualize a unique collec-tion of (predominantly) German manuscripts of ‘learned magic,’ which is today hosted—more or less uncorrupted (with some minor losses, but also some minor amendments)—in Leipzig University Library; and (3) provide insights into the history of ‘learned magic’ in eighteenth cen-tury German-speaking Europe. In doing so, this study addresses, among other things, questions of censorship regimes and efficiency, of the textual-ritual tradition of ‘Western learned magic,’ and of the status and use of handwritten books in an alleged ‘age of print.’ Beyond these particulargoals, the book intends to provide a methodological pathway towards an interdisciplinary, integrative, and thus more comprehensive analysis of books of ‘learned magic’ in and beyond early modern times. By seeing these books as artefacts of both the longue-durée tradition of ‘Western learned magic’ and of the early modern book market, our book takes a new stance towards scribal texts that are often regarded as eccentric, peripheral, or marginal.

OTTOthe LeiPzig coLLection: Part and ParceL of ‘Western Learned Magic’The manuscript collection sold in 1710 is as exceptional as it is a tiny piece in the puzzle of a much larger textual-ritual tradition, namely, that of ‘Western learned magic’. There is no room in this study to discuss this tradition at great length, as it spans almost 2000 years and ranges from late antiquity to the twenty-first century,1 thus paralleling (and some-times merging into) numerous other elitist traditions of knowledge that have been transmitted from antiquity onwards. However, we shall none-theless provide a rough sketch of said tradition in order to facilitate the analysis of the Leipzig corpus.‘Western learned magic’ is a novel and relatively unknown object of scholarly analysis and historiography, and has mainly been explored and discussed in what has become known as the ‘Study of Western Esotericism’ over the past decades.2 Essentially, ‘Western learned magic’ is an analytical construct for gathering a corpus of texts, particularly rit-ual texts, that include an etymological derivate, linguistic equivalent, or culturally established synonym of ‘magic’ as a self-referential and thus identificatory term.3 Its conceptualization has been inspired by discourse analysis and particularly the discussion of the ‘insider/outsider’ distinc-tion in the Study of Religion.4 It is thus an attempt to cope with the problem that ‘magic’ has always been and still is a ‘floating signifier’5 that has been ascribed—usually with a pejorative or polemical impe-tus—to people, practices, or texts that would never have used the label for self-reference. In contrast, the analytical category ‘Western learned magic’ exclusively covers sources that display the ‘insider’ perspectives, performances, and theorizations of people who claim(ed) to be practis-ing ‘magic(ians)’, and attempts at analyzing these sources “as from inside the system” (Kenneth L. Pike).6 Since these ‘insider’ perspectives, per-formances, and theorizations as well as their cultural and social contexts change(d) over time, the textual-ritual tradition of ‘Western learned magic’ bears no immutable ‘essence’ but is, in contrast, characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, hybridity, and changeability.As the concept of ‘magic’ is very old—it goes back to the old Persian (self-) appellation of a Median tribe or priest caste (‘maguš’), which was adopted, initially as a polemical invective, by Greek authors around the fifth century BCE7—the textual-ritual tradition of ‘Western learned magic’ is quite extensive. The first surviving corpus of relevant texts—the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 7so-called Greek Magical Papyri (or Papyri Graecae Magicae)—were writ-ten in Koine Greek and circulated in Egypt and surrounding regions between the second and fifth centuries CE.8 From that moment on, we must think of a continuous stream—or rather of multiple trajectories or even an intercultural network—of texts that depicted and prescribed an arsenal of different ritual performances as well as theorizations of ritual efficacy or physical causation. Over the course of the Middle Ages, this textual-ritual tradition transcended a wide range of geographical, cul-tural and religious borders, thereby manifesting in, among others, surviv-ing Jewish (e.g., Hebrew or Aramaic), Islamic (e.g., Arabic or Persian), Byzantine (Middle Greek) or European (e.g., Old Castilian or Latin) texts of ‘learned magic’.9 The early modern period is characterized by several inter-related developments in the realm of ‘learned magic’, such as the adoption, reconceptualization, and advocacy of some of its texts and techniques by humanist scholars (‘magia naturalis’), as well as enhanced textual diffusion in vernacular languages and thus expanding author, reader and practitioner milieus (on this process of ‘democratiza-tion’ see further, below).‘Western learned magic’ thus refers to a longue durée inter-religious and transcultural textual-ritual tradition of elitist knowledge about prac-tices and theorizations that were conceptualized under the umbrella term ‘magic’ or related terms from an affirmative insider’s perspective. These features are reflected in the Leipzig collection in several ways. The above criterion of self-referentiality can be applied to the collection with suf-ficient plausibility.10 It hosts one of the most (in)famous and systematic early modern manuals for ‘conjuring spirits’—the Clavicula Salomonis (Key of Solomon)—in seven different versions and three different lan-guages (German, Latin, and Italian),11 thus displaying the transcul-tural nature of ‘Western learned magic’.12 The collection clearly points to conceptual heterogeneity and hybridity as core features of ‘Western learned magic’.13 What is more, most of its texts are copies or transla-tions of much older texts, going back, for example, to late ancient Jewish milieus,14 to the medieval Arabic realm,15 or to late medieval European monastery contexts16—thus attesting the above claim that we are, in fact, dealing with a coherent longue-durée textual-ritual ‘tradition’.17 Of course, there are also younger texts in the collection—some may even have been composed shortly before the sale18—but what is striking to a scholar familiar with the material is that the Leipzig corpus more or less assembles the ‘who’s who’ of the premodern (and particularly the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOpseudepigraphic) heritage of ‘Western learned magic’. Whoever has com-piled this collection or funded its numerous translations into German surely had taste.excePtionaL genre characteristicsBooks of ‘learned magic’ are among the most difficult ones to track, ana-lyze and categorize in historical research. Like other premodern (scribal or printed) publications, they were unique media that were never entirely fixed, stable, static or unified.19 Particularly manuscripts have been described as “fluid, developing entities”20 that could change their forms, layouts and contents with every new owner or producer, thus being con-tinually and/or collaboratively re-written, re-edited, re-arranged, re-annotated, criticized, updated, supplemented, revised, re-imagined, or transcribed. Accordingly, manuscripts may be seen as “liquid” or “living books” or as “processes” themselves.21 This “constant flux”22 turned manuscripts into on-going projects of individual choices. A reliance on manuscripts, then, enabled early modern authors, compilers, copyists and/or practitioners of ‘learned magic’ to adopt an extremely liberal attitude towards the idea of being ‘faithful to the original’ (or, put dif-ferently, to the idea of ‘textual authenticity’),23 which prompted some exceptional genre characteristics. As we shall see, manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ are indeed characterized by an unstable author-title-content rela-tionship and by a high degree of intertextual variability, changeability, fluidity, and heterogeneity.Let us begin with the issue of (alleged) authorship. Many manuscripts of the Leipzig collection are pseudepigraphic in the sense that they are ascribed (usually in the titles) to mythical, false or non-existent authors. For readers, users or collectors of such texts this may not have been problematic per se, as pseudepigraphs could become established and thus allow for identifying stereotypical textual or ritual contents. The most prominent pseudepigraph in the realm of ‘learned magic’ is Solomon, who is typically associated with the art of ‘conjuring spirits’ and figures in 15 manuscript titles of the Leipzig collection. Of the 140 manuscripts that were sold in 1710, over 50 are most certainly pseudepigraphic,24 whereas only 10–15 texts seem to display ‘authentic’ author names (even though even these remain debatable, as in the case of ‘Paracelsus’). All remaining texts (ca. 75) give no indication of any author; in these cases, the title usually provides a rough outline of textual or ritual contents."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 9Pseudepigraphs were certainly not binding and could easily be exchanged according to the preferences of a copyist, compiler or trans-lator, thereby adapting a text to a (new) cultural or linguistic context. This has, for example, happened with several Claviculae Salomonis in the Leipzig collection: Entry No. 7, for example (CM 2), displays an abbre-viated German version of the Clavicula Salomonis, but is here ascribed to Albertus Magnus who might have been perceived as the more adequate ‘author’ in German-speaking Europe. Entry No. 16 (CM 19) hosts a different (Latin) version of the Clavicula Salomonis, but is now ascribed to a ‘Rehencatricus’, an alleged pupil of the ancient ‘sage’ Apollonius of Tyana.25 The Leipzig corpus also hosts various versions of a text which outlines the fabrication and ritual use of seven planetary sigils and which is either assigned to Solomon (entry No. 72 = CM 38), Trithemius (No. 73 = CM 92), Paracelsus (No. 69 = CM 39), Albertus Magnus (No. 29 = CM 72), or to no author whatsoever (e.g. No. 70 & 71 = CM 93 & 94; see also CM 37). Apparently, ‘authors’ or author names are often nothing but topoi in the realm of ‘learned magic’: they have a predominantly symbolic or mythological function and indicate hidden knowledge, ritual power, or religious righteousness (note that Biblical figures such as Moses,26 Jesus,27 David,28 and Jacob29 are also used as pseudepigraphs in the Leipzig collection).The same pertains, not unexpectedly, to titles. As a general rule, the titles of early modern texts of ‘learned magic’ are as fluid and ever-changing as their alleged authors.30 The Leipzig collection attests to this fluidity to a particularly strong degree, as it mostly hosts German trans-lations of older (mostly Latin, likely some Italian, and a few Hebrew) templates. Of the 140 manuscripts of the collection sold in 1710, the majority seem to display ‘new’ titles, particularly the Germanized texts, which amount to 117 in total. For example, entry No. 3 (CM 16) hosts a lengthy treatise on the art of ‘conjuring spirits’, which had circulated under the title De nigromancia in previous Latin and English manuscript versions, here ascribed to Roger Bacon.31 The German title in CM 16 now reads “Melani monachi Processe von Beschwerung mancherley Geister” (literally “Melani Monachi’s processes of conjuring various spir-its”), thus indicating a pseudepigraphic and conceptual shift. The same happened, as already mentioned, with several versions of the Clavicula Salomonis. The title-content-relationship is confused in both directions, as different texts of ‘learned magic’ could also bear the same title, for example ‘secrets’ or ‘secret of secrets’. The latter refers to a specific text"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOthat was translated from Arabic into Latin in the early thirteenth century (as Secretum Secretorum), and soon thereafter into different European vernacular languages.32 The very title gave rise to a thriving textual genre during the early modern period,33 which covered all sorts of natural or supernatural ‘experimenta’ or ‘miracula’ and was loosely related to the concept of ‘natural magic’ (‘magia naturalis’).34 ‘Secret’, in fact, appears in no less than 26 titles of the collection (as either ‘secreta’ in Latin, ‘seg-reta’ in Italian, or ‘Geheimnüss’ in German texts).35Moving on to textual contents, early modern texts of ‘learned magic’ are usually patchwork products that de- or prescribe ritual per-formances and thus combine a vast range of different ritual techniques, recipe patterns, or ‘building blocks’ (variously based on astrology, ange-lology, demonology, numerology, evocations, fumigations, the use of material artefacts and devices, the use of special cloth, fasting and fur-ther preparations, speech acts of numerous kinds, further performative actions, or the use of a special ‘language’ of signs and symbols, to name only a few examples).36 As these ritual techniques could be combined in a thousandfold manner, Stephan Bachter—in an extensive survey of German texts of ‘learned magic’ from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries—was tempted to use the analogy of a “Baukastensystem” (“modular design”).37 Robert Mathiesen, in a survey of the early mod-ern manuscript transmission of the Clavicula Salomonis based on 122 surviving manuscript versions, has identified at least 14 different “generic types” of the text.38 The Clavicula Salomonis is, in fact, a typical text of ‘learned magic’ as it is virtually impossible to identify an ‘Ur-Version’ even by careful stemmatic analysis. In other words, the Clavicula Salomonis is rather a ‘genre’ than a ‘text’. However, as there are also on-going continuities—that is, the author-title-content-relationship is not completely arbitrary, but displays a certain degree of stability across the variations—it makes most sense to speak of a complex interplay between stasis and dynamis in texts of ‘learned magic’.Why did authors, compilers, copyists and/or practitioners adopt such an extremely liberal attitude towards the idea of being ‘faithful to the original’ or, put differently, to the idea of ‘textual authenticity’? Apart from (1) the long and entangled history of ‘Western learned magic’, which led to the accumulation of an ever greater amount of ritual texts, techniques, recipes, and modes of efficacy, and (2) the ongoing reli-ance on manuscript transmission even in an ‘age of print’ (see below), it should also be noted that (3) there never were any authorities in the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 11realm of ‘learned magic’ that would have determined any kind of ortho-doxy or -praxy (to which authors, copyists, translators, or practitioners would have been accountable). In other words, no one ever monitored the ‘Werktreue’ of a given copy or translation, which certainly fuelled diverse textual diffusion.39the excePtionaLity of the coLLectionWithin the longue-durée textual-ritual tradition of ‘Western learned magic’, the Leipzig collection holds a prominent, if not unique, spot. Certainly, there had been extensive previous collections of (both scribal and printed) texts of ‘learned magic’ in other European languages and regions. Apart from Latin collections hosted in monastery libraries ever since the late Middle Ages,40 British scholars in particular had assembled substantial private collections of ‘learned magic’ texts during the early modern period—such as John Dee (1527–1608),41 Thomas Browne (1605–1682),42 Elias Ashmole (1617–1692),43 Hans Sloane (1660–1753),44 Robert (1661–1724) and Edward Harley (1689–1741)45 or Charles A. Rainsford (1728–1809).46 In France, Marc Antoine René de Voyer d’Argenson (1722–1778) may come to mind, whose extensive manuscript collection—which included numerous texts of ‘learned magic’—formed the basis of the great French national library, the Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal.47 With regard to early modern German collections of (scribal or printed) texts of ‘learned magic’, however, historical data is scarce.48 In general, the translation or composition of German texts of ‘learned magic’ has to be interpreted against the back-drop of an overall process of ‘democratization’ of ‘learned magic’ dur-ing the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. ‘Democratization’ here refers to the increased accessibility of ‘learned magic’ texts in vernacu-lar languages and, as a consequence, to expanding author, reader and practitioner milieus.49 Whereas in previous centuries the transmission of ‘learned magic’ texts and techniques mostly relied on ecclesiastical (and foremostly monastery) milieus,50 from the late fifteenth century onwards there was enhanced textual diffusion among all kinds of scholars, astrol-ogers, medics, parish clergy, merchants and soldiers, and even illiterates (such as prostitutes).51 Said dynamics were certainly propelled by let-terpress printing, even though manuscript transmission remained cru-cial in the realm of ‘learned magic’ at least until the eighteenth century (see below)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"12 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOWhen this process—particularly the production of vernacular texts of ‘learned magic’—reached the German-speaking regions on a larger scale is hard to determine. While research in German ‘Volkskunde’ has stressed until very recently that this process properly began over the course of the eighteenth century only,52 we believe that the Leipzig collection calls for revising this perspective. As the collection sold in 1710 appears to be the end-product of a longer process of collecting, copying, vernacularizing, commenting upon, and re-arranging texts of ‘learned magic’ in early modern German-speaking Europe, we believe that this process may have been very much underway all throughout the seventeenth century, if not earlier. A few examples from the Leipzig col-lection may serve to illustrate this point.First, the Leipzig collection hosts eight versions of a subgenre of ‘learned magic’ that often comes under the name Höllenzwang and is ascribed to the illustrious figure of Johann Georg Faust (ca. 1480–1541), the man behind the ‘Faust legend’.53 The Faustian Höllenzwänge are usu-ally extensive German manuals for ‘conjuring spirits’, which provide a sophisticated set of ritual performances that aim at subordinating large quantities of intermediaries for different inner-worldly purposes.54 The systematic outline of these texts (they are often divided into two books of some twenty chapters each), as well as their sophisticated ritual setups (which include the preparation and use of richly illustrated ritual circles, cloth, and further ritual devices, as well as an array of sigils ascribed to hierarchies of intermediaries) are clearly derived from previous Clavicula Salomonis templates.55 The Höllenzwänge differ from these templates, however, in that they often address the reader from the alleged first-person perspective of Johann Faust and they also seem to be characterized by richer illustrations, including images of the to-be-conjured demons.56 German ‘Volkskundler’ such as Christoph Daxelmüller57 or Stephan Bachter58 have argued that the Höllenzwänge are products of the eight-eenth century only. Clearly, the ‘publication’ dates depicted on the title pages (such as “1407” in CM 138; “1411” in CM 6; or “1510” in CM 139)59 are false and intended to simulate great age. However, the exist-ence of so many different versions in 1710 indicates that complex pro-cesses of textual appropriation, translation, innovation, re-arrangement and transmission must have occurred all throughout the seventeenth century or even earlier. In fact, Will-Erich Peuckert has claimed that at least parts of a Höllenzwang version not hosted in Leipzig—entitled Doctor Johannes Fausts Magia naturalis et innaturalis oder Dreifacher"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 13Höllenzwang60—must have been composed between 1533 and 1563 (that is, between Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia and Johan Weiyer’s De praestigiis daemonum).61 The Leipzig collection thus calls for revis-ing the tendency of German ‘Volkskunde’ to late-date the Höllenzwang genre.62What is more, there are numerous texts in the Leipzig collection that belong to the fuzzy genre of ‘secreta’ or ‘miracula’ literature (the German umbrella term was Kunst- und Wunderbuch). These texts bear close resemblance to the genre of ‘Brauchbücher’63 or ‘Hausbücher’64 in that they provide short, complexity-reduced rituals of ‘magia natura-lis’ for a wide audience that lacks religious expertise, sophisticated lan-guage capabilities, or the timely and monetary resources for lengthy ritual performances.65 Apparently, such texts had already circulated all throughout the seventeenth century (as is now known, modes of basic reading comprehension were widespread in German-speaking Europe in the seventeenth century),66 and there may have been a particularly high demand for such practices—and the corresponding manuals—during the 30 Years’ War. The so-called ‘Passauer Kunst’, which aimed at the ‘Festmachen’ (literally, ‘making solid’, i.e. becoming invulnerable) of combatants by means of ‘learned magic’ techniques (for example, by sewing complex sigils with ‘voces magicae’ and ‘charactêres’ into one’s clothes)67 was popularized by Johannes Staricius who printed the so-called Helden-Schatz as early as 1615; the Helden-Schatz witnessed no less than 11 reprints until the end of the seventeenth century.68 The Leipzig collection reflects this popularity and provides three alterna-tive versions of ‘Festmachen’ rituals, which had apparently circulated in manuscript form (see catalogue entries No. 33 [CM 134], No. 103 [CM 119], and No. 127 [CM 125]). Many German ‘Brauchbücher’ printed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries still include similar recipes for avoiding gunshot wounds and other military purposes.69In accordance with further findings—remarks in polemical literature indicate that Germanized texts of ‘learned magic’ circulated already dur-ing the late sixteenth century70; various German manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ have indeed survived from the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-turies71; print-runs of German books of ‘learned magic’ begin as early as the second half of the seventeenth century72—the Leipzig collection indicates that the Germanization of texts and techniques of ‘learned magic’ was not in its beginning, but rather its final, stage in 1710.73 Even though many of these texts address small, elitist readership circles"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"14 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTO(which is reflected in their ritual and conceptual complexity), the Leipzig collection points to expanding reader and practitioner milieus and thus to processes of ‘democratization’ and ‘popularization’ of ‘learned magic’ in German-speaking Europe before 1710. German ‘Volkskundler’ may have focused too much on printed editions, which indeed have their peak in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to date these processes accurately.Yet, even though German texts of ‘learned magic’ may have circulated somewhat earlier than so far assumed, there is currently no evidence of the existence of a comparably large collection of—predominantly German—books of ‘learned magic’ before 1710. We are thus inclined to think that the Leipzig collection holds a prominent, if not unique posi-tion within the history of ‘Western learned magic’. Apart from being one of largest book collections of ‘learned magic’ in eighteenth century German-speaking Europe, and moreover the earliest extensive collec-tion of German translations of such texts, it is one of very few collec-tions that has actually survived more or less in its entirety until this day.74 Only after the sale of the collection, that is, over the course of the eight-eenth century, have we been able to trace comparably large German collections. For example, the research library of Gotha hosts a hand-written list of some 30 texts of ‘learned magic’ that dates to the mid-eighteenth century.75 This collection, too, was for sale—the indicated price was 20 ‘Louisdor’, a contemporary equivalent of about 6000–9000 litres of beer—but the collection was considerably smaller, and it obvi-ously does not precede the Leipzig collection. Interestingly, some of the items on this list not only relate to texts, but also to ritual devices (such as belts or pentacles),76 indicating that the ritual art outlined in these texts had actually been—or was still intended to be—put into prac-tice. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, more and more German book collections of ‘learned magic’ continued to see the light of day.77 This development seems to reflect an increased interest in ‘learned magic’ and related topics during the so-called ‘Enlightenment’ period,78 which culminated in the large German print-compilations of the nineteenth century (Georg Conrad Horst’s six-volume Zauber-Bibliothek [1821–1826] and Johann Scheible’s 12-volume Das Kloster [1848–1849]). One of the most interesting later findings, however, is attached to the name Joseph Wetzel, whose collection of 158 (scribal and printed) texts of ‘learned magic’ had been seized by the authorities of Ravensburg in 1895.79 Even though this collection is considerably"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 15later, it is nonetheless fascinating as it indicates that a comparably large collection of ‘learned magic’ texts could still host 104 manuscripts (and only 56 printed versions) in the late nineteenth century. Apparently, even though more and more texts of ‘learned magic’ were printed from the late eighteenth century onwards, two-thirds of the collection of a prac-titioner of the late nineteenth century could still comprise manuscripts.the excePtionaLity of the cataLogueThe catalogue that offered the Leipzig collection for sale in 1710 (see Appendices A and B) was as exceptional as its offered goods. Early mod-ern book catalogues came in many forms—such as inventories of private libraries, catalogues of desired books (wish-lists), lists of books written by specific authors or in a specific discipline, trade catalogues compiled by publishers (including catalogues for book auctions), or the banning lists of authorities—the ‘catalogus’ displays some unusual features: it was a rare version of a printed book catalogue for manuscripts; it was a trade catalogue without the usual trading details (such as prices, the name of the seller, etc.)80; and it was a ‘real’ list, meaning that all listed manu-scripts actually existed.81 As every niche of the book market had its own book lists, so the sales of ‘scarce’ or ‘indexed’ books had their own niche catalogues.82 When ‘scarce books’, that is, the most expensive and rare manuscripts, were offered at all at a book auction during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the auction catalogues always were in printed form (as in our case).83 Advertising the Leipzig collection may have been a potentially lucrative but also dangerous business for both seller and owner, signalled by the missing prices, contact and provenance details.The rudimentary nature of the data given had its main reason in the illegality of the collection and the elitist market the catalogue addressed. As will be discussed in greater detail in the following sections on ‘scarcity’ and ‘illegality’, advertising such a collection in elite networks of rich scholars and collectors was a shadowy business that required the conceal-ment of documented names or details on the selling process. With this in mind, it is likely that the catalogue was provided for free,84 in a face-to-face situation between a bookseller, or book agent, and a potential elitist customer. Another reason for the striking lack of relevant informa-tion in the ‘catalogus’ was the contemporary censorship situation. Selling such ‘scarce’ or ‘indexed’ books in the early eighteenth century was a hot potato even in relatively liberal Leipzig and had to be done secretly,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"16 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOas the nameless bookseller or new owner of the collection surely knew. However, later sources have at least enabled us to identify the previous owner of the collection: apparently, it was a relatively unknown “Medicus zu Leipzig” named Samuel Schröer who, at that time 41 years old, had initiated the publication of the catalogue in 1710 in order to sell parts of his private book collection.85 The book enthusiast Zacharias Konrad von Uffenbach mentions the Augsburg-based bookseller and publisher Paul Kühtze as the provider or selling agent of said collection of “libros magicos”, which was sold for “4000 Reichs-Thaler” to a nameless “admirer”.86notes 1.

See Otto (2016) for a more concise argument; elsewhere, the tradition has been referred to as ‘selbstreferentieller Magiediskurs’ (Otto 2011) or ‘discourse of inclusion’ (Otto 2013). The addendum ‘learned’ is used to point out that we are here dealing with (1) an elitist—textual!—discourse that usually requires expertise in several languages and religious traditions, and (2) prescriptions and theorizations that tend towards complex, time- and resource-consuming ritual performances. The addendum ‘learned’ thus operates as a marker of specificity of this particular corpus of sources and helps to demarcate it from other (allegedly ‘magical’) ritual traditions that were transmitted only orally and whose ritual performances thus remained rather short and simplistic.

This transculturality is also reflected in the overall language mixture of the Leipzig collection, which consists of 117 (predominantly) German, 13 (predominantly) Italian, and 10 (predominantly) Latin texts; in fact, most manuscripts display a mixture of languages in both titles and contents, including also numerous Hebrew, some Greek and even a few Arabic elements. See Appendix A (element V) for further details. Said mixture points to the origin of large parts of the collection, which is rather to be located in Southern and/or Western Europe.

Note that the meaning of ‘magia naturalis’ changed"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2 EXCEPTIONALITY 19considerably over the course of its early modern reception. Early versions of the concept (e.g., in the works of Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Theophrastus of Hohenheim, or Agrippa of Nettesheim) cov-ered concepts of physical causation—such as the use of astrological tal-ismans (‘images’) or the efficacy of special words (sometimes subsumed under ‘kabbalah’)—that were dropped by later authors, for instance by Giambattista della Porta in his influential Magia naturalis (first publ. 1558, revised ed. 1589). It is this later and indeed more ‘naturalistic’ ver-sion of ‘magia naturalis’ that influenced debates of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in Germany foremost through the translation of della Porta’s Magia naturalis (trsl. by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth as Haus-, Kunst- und Wunderbuch [...], Nürnberg 1680) and its populari-zation in Hildebrand (1610) and other German works of the seventeenth century. 35.

The argument is still made in Bachter (2005, 7–8, 29–30). The question of dating this process of ‘vernacularization’ is crucial as it relates to the on-going dispute about whether there was a ‘magische Volkskultur’ in Europe before the 18th century at all (see on this dispute Bachter 2005, 28–29), which is, in turn, relevant to inter-preting the European witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-turies. 53.

OTTOManuscriPts in an age of PrintHandwritten newsletters, manuscripts, and books were part of the nor-mal varieties of written media in early modern times, and scribal publica-tions continued to be popular (and had their markets) in Europe at least from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries.1 The decision to avoid printing thus made these texts ‘scarce’ and precarious materials, as they often circulated in a few copies only.2 However, compiling and selling a collection of 140 manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ in the early eighteenth century, many of which comprised hundreds of hand-written pages, was nonetheless extraordinary and calls for an explanation. In our view, there are at least four reasons for this kind of scribal production in an alleged ‘age of print’.First, there has always been an overweight of hand-written (and often pseud- or non-epigraphic) texts in the history of ‘Western learned magic’ at least until the late eighteenth century. Admittedly, there was also a printed discourse on ‘magia naturalis’ and related topics (such as alchemy, astrology, ‘Hermetism’, ‘Kabbalah’, or Rosicrucianism) from the late fifteenth century onwards.3 This sophisticated humanist dis-course was—compared to the pseud- or non-epigraphic manuscript corpus (which often dealt with the art of ‘conjuring spirits’)—less con-cerned with ritual, more theoretical, and also more ‘pious’, as partak-ing authors used their proper names and had a reputation to lose (if not more). In fact, some of these authors—such as Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Agrippa of Nettesheim, or Giordano Bruno—had to defend themselves against churchly accusations of having performed the ‘magi-cal arts’ or engaged in pacts with the devil. Yet, even if they claimed oth-erwise, many of these ‘author-magicians’ were familiar with, and inspired by, the pseud- or non-epigraphic manuscript corpus of ‘learned magic’,4 so that there always remained an intimate relationship between both text groups. The humanist discourse on ‘magia naturalis’ and related topics thrived roughly between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries and lost credibility and significance thereafter,5 even though some of its texts and arguments continued to prosper in certain (e.g., Rosicrucian or Freemason) milieus.6 There are a few scribal copies of previously printed works in the Leipzig collection,7 but it displays an overweight of pseud- or non-epigraphic literature and thereby demonstrates that the reproduc-tion and dissemination of such texts via manuscript transmission was still very much alive in the early eighteenth century."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"3 SCARCITY 31Second, to produce, use, or circulate scribal rather than printed ver-sions of a text certainly was a conscious decision that allowed for hiding both the texts and their collectors or users from unwanted attention by those hostile to such materials. Compared to printed editions of usually more than 100 copies, manuscripts comprised only one or, at most, a few copies. The smaller the editions, the higher the chances to avoid prob-lems with censorship authorities. No surprise, then, that the organiza-tion of large parts of clandestine communication was a scribal business in early modern Europe.8 The Leipzig corpus furthermore attests that texts of ‘learned magic’ (or parts of these texts) that had previously cir-culated in printed versions, were now hand-copied to avoid attention.9 Following Ira O. Wade, the practice of making scribal copies of a (hand-written or printed) work in order to circulate these written media among specific communities was still common in the eighteenth century,10 and people or groups sympathizing with ‘learned magic’ certainly were among those communities.Following eighteenth century polemics, there is a third reason for the reliance on manuscipts. As manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ were ‘scarce’ goods in the early modern book market that promised extraordinary profits, one can easily assume that clever entrepreneurs provided an ongoing supply of such manuscripts. Johann Christoph Adelung (1732–1806), in his polemical work Geschichte der menschlichen Narrheit, claims that a “hungry fraudster hears or notices that a wealthy fool is longing for such wisdom: quickly he sits down, writes a few pages of nonsense, and lets the other pay dearly for his lustfulness”.11 Adelung believes that through such dynamics at least some of the many variations of ‘learned magic’ texts (such as the different versions of Clavicula Salomonis)12 can be explained. He even gives an example: the lawyer Johann Ernst Philippi (1700–1757?) is, Adelung claims, one such fraudster who made his living by hand-copying books of ‘learned magic’ in the final years of his life.13 Certainly, this is a polemical remark,14 and we have outlined different reasons for the high degree of textual variability in the realm of ‘learned magic’ above. However, there are various ‘student stories’ from the latter half of the eighteenth century, which indicate that access-ing books of ‘learned magic’ was, by that time, actually fairly easy (for example, via university libraries), and hand-copying them was, apart from being a lucrative business, also a fascinating one.15 Karl Kiesewetter, in his Faust in der Geschichte der Tradition, even speaks of “an entire"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"32 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOindustry focused on the production of forged magical and alchemical scripts”.16Finally, there is the ritual issue. At least for early modern practition-ers of ‘learned magic’, particularly those devoted to the art of ‘conjuring spirits’, it was crucial to use or produce a hand-written text. In fact, some of the rituals outlined in the Leipzig collection require the personaliza-tion of the book by means of elaborate consecration techniques, whereby it acquires ‘magical’ efficacy, which can then be used during the ritual. Such techniques have been observed since the late Middle Ages, and sev-eral versions of a corresponding manual (a text bearing the title Liber consecrationum) are included in the Leipzig collection.17 A little later in the eighteenth century, we even encounter a printed work that outlines how to produce a decent parchment manuscript for ‘conjuring spirits’: “Make this booklet of parchment [...] before summoning the spirits write the characters with red ink [...] the entire booklet is to be written in the [...] time of Venus, whereby it is necessary to utilize an unused dove feather and ink with copper water. One can also use green or red color at whim, because both these colors are welcomed by our planet”.18 Apparently, early modern manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ were not only meant to transport textual information, but also to embody ritual authenticity and efficacy, and thereby remained the ‘learned magician’s’ preferred medium in an alleged ‘age of print’.hunting ‘scarce’ BooksDuring the early modern period, ‘libri prohibiti’ or ‘libri haeretici’, books banned or forbidden by the authorities of Europe, and ‘libri obscoeni’, mostly pornographic literature, were on offer in clandestine markets of the book trade from time to time, and were chased by early modern censorship regimes as well as individual collectors.19 ‘Scarce’ books were peculiar and desirous paper or parchment materials in a so-called ‘age of print’, which gave these manuscripts a special aura. This aura had its price and attracted elitist collectors of scribal publications throughout Europe. One of these collectors in early eighteenth century Germany was Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach (1683–1734). He was a Frankfurt counsellor from 1721 onwards, but also a true bibliophile and book-collector, and seems to have been rich enough to chase ‘scarce’ books, both in manuscript or printed form.20 Next to the motivation to foster science by providing big book collections for future research,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"3 SCARCITY 33his other main goal was to collect contemporary banned or forbidden books, as well as ‘libri obscoeni’.21 In fact, he admitted that his passion was to possess such “libros damnatos” as “Libri prohibiti majus desid-erium excitant” (“prohibited books evoke greater desire”).22 When trav-elling from 1709 to 1711 to various cities throughout German-speaking Europe, England and the Dutch Republic, he bought books by the dozens and hundreds, and he precisely noted which kind of rare writ-ten media one could buy at these places, where the libraries were situ-ated, and who owned these collections.23 In his ambition to collect such media, ranging from books and manuscripts to letters and prints, he also paid employees to search for him, such as the Berlin-based scholar Charles Etienne Jordan (1700–1745). Jordan was instructed to acquire and seek after rare books that Uffenbach had only heard of and could not get possession of yet.24Around 1700, manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ may not have been the regular offer of European bookshops, but at times they were nonetheless for sale in book cities like Den Haag or Leipzig. In Den Haag, for exam-ple, Uffenbach bought a manuscript version of the Clavicula Salomonis from the local bookseller Pieter Frederik Gosse.25 In this case, Uffenbach bought only the right to copy the manuscript as the original price of the scribal publication was 30 guilders—a fortune for a manuscript of 30 leaves in quarto (its contemporaneous value was about 1300–1600 litres of beer). Apparently, specialists and collectors of rare books knew the market and spent enormous sums for their desired objects.26 Daniel Jütte has coined the term ‘economies of secrets’ for such milieus that dealt with texts of assumed or real arcane knowledge.27In 1711, Uffenbach’s private book collection, including prints, handwritten books and printed books, already comprised some 12,000 volumes.28 By the time of his death in 1734, his collection had grown to an estimated 25,000 volumes, including more than 2000 manuscripts. Uffenbach was particularly interested in oriental (e.g., Hebraic) manu-scripts, even though he was not proficient in any oriental language.29 We also have proof that by 1720 Uffenbach had already collected numerous manuscripts of ‘learned magic’. As the catalogue of his manuscript col-lection reveals,30 there were numerous relevant texts listed in the sections on “Dogmatici, Polemici, Rituales” and “Kabbalistici”, and Uffenbach’s own sub-listing included a section on “physikalische, chemische, magis-che Handschriften” (Handschriften, Pars IV).31 Between 1729–1731, when Uffenbach began to sell off his books—and thereby produced"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"34 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOhis own selling catalogue,32 we find even more hints of manuscripts of ‘learned magic’, here classed under the headings “Orientalia Reliquia”, “Physica, chymica, alchymica”, and “Prohibita”.33eLitist netWorksAs the case of Uffenbach demonstrates, hunting, owning, and trading manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ had become a lucrative business activ-ity by the early eighteenth century. However, it also remained an elitist scholarly interest, which was rooted in the book and knowledge cul-ture of Renaissance and Enlightenment Europe and attracted scholarly individuals and networks alike. One such network with a fascination for ‘learned magic’ was the early modern medical world with its many forms of professional (‘scientific’) and non-professional (‘alternative’) medical practices.34 There is plenty of evidence for the circulation of German manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ around 1700 within the medi-cal world in central Germany.35 The affinity of medical networks towards ‘learned magic’ may have had two main reasons: the intimate relation-ship between medicine, alchemy, and the early modern discourse on ‘magia naturalis’ on the one hand,36 and the social status of owning such manuscripts on the other. Regarding the first issue, the medical profes-sional of Leipzig and previous owner of the collection, Samuel Schröer, certainly was attracted by astrological, alchemical and further alterna-tive ideas about healing, just like many other scholars of his time.37 For example, the theologian and medical professional Johann Conrad Dippel (1673–1734) openly argued for a direct connection between a godly ‘magia naturalis’ of “healing light” (“Lichtsmagie”) and alchemy-driven medical treatments.38 Even though Schröer’s medical networks and their affinity to alchemícal, Paracelsian and ‘learned magic’ healing practices remain obscure,39 we do know that his working place, Leipzig, pro-vided social spaces for exchanging and practising such knowledge around 1700.40 Moreover, in Leipzig and in the nearby city of Halle, academic interest in alchemical knowledge and Paracelsian traditions was wide-spread within the local universities, providing even more potential for exchange and interest on such matters.41 For example, the alchemist and publisher Friedrich Roth-Scholtz of Nuremberg (1687–1736) claimed to have access to the former Schröer collection, being a friend of the anon-ymous buyer. Roth-Scholtz was impressed by the collection, and pro-vided a printed (and revised)42 version of the book trade catalogue both"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"3 SCARCITY 35separately and as an appendix to his own publication Vetervm Sophorvm Sigilla et Imagines Magicae (1732).43 Roth-Scholtz was, next to his book business, regularly engaged in cataloguing and commenting on (al)chemical books.44 Hence, in his printed version of the ‘catalogus’, he provided further details on the provenance of some of the manuscripts, for example regarding previously printed versions or previous references to the titles in other literature.If we assume that the buyer of the Leipzig collection was part of the local medical-alchemical milieu, a plausible guess may be the pharma-cist Heinrich Linck (1638–1717), who possessed a thriving apothecary in Leipzig, and who assembled a well-known ‘cabinet of curiosities’ over the course of his life, which was one of the main attractions of the city at that time. The year of his death more or less corresponds to Uffenbach’s claim that the new owner of the collection died shortly after having acquired the corpus.45 We also have evidence that Heinrich Linck was an eager and wealthy book collector, and the family’s manuscript catalogue from 1787 indeed reveals 23 manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ of which 17 titles clearly correspond to manuscripts of the Leipzig collection.46 This is a strange finding: if Linck had bought the entire collection, why would his sons bequeath the collection to the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’ shortly after his death (see below), but produce duplicates of 17 manuscripts? As this is a rather improbable scenario, it may be more likely that Heinrich Linck and Samuel Schröer were part of the same social spaces that exchanged and practised ‘alternative’ healing methods, alchemical lore, Paracelsianism and ‘learned magic’ around 1700. We may conclude that the Lincks had either tempory access to the Leipzig collection (before 1710) or access to the same source of manuscripts that generated the Leipzig collection.Next to such alchemist and Paracelsian networks, the word reached a wider audience when a copy of the 1710 ‘catalogus’ was discovered by the Hebraist and collector of oriental books Johann Christoph Wolf (1683–1739) in Hamburg. Wolf became aware of the catalogue while acquiring parts of Uffenbach’s collection in the late 1720s,47 and pre-pared at least one new scribal copy, where he referred to the now missing collection and a printed version of the ‘catalogus’.48 Given this excep-tional after-life of the ‘catalogus’49—which was reprinted several times by different scholars in the decades after the sale—it is not surprising that German Freemason circles, too, became aware of the collection. The Freemason Heinrich Wilhelm Marschalch reported at least once to the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"36 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTObook collector Uffenbach about the collection and thereby mentioned the selling price.50 A direct relationship between the Leipzig collection and German Freemason or Rosicrucian milieus—which would have been a plausible guess in the first place—is, however, not found in the sources, even though these milieus certainly had a strong interest in alchemy, Paracelsianism, ‘magia naturalis’, and sometimes even the Solomonic art of ‘conjuring spirits’.51A second reason for the affinity of medical networks towards ‘learned magic’ may have been the accumulation of social status by owning such manuscripts. In fact, in scholarly circles scarce books were often objects of social status, and this holds true for medical and alchemist networks as well. From the sixteenth century onwards, medical professionals used books beyond their textuality as “high-end objects, not intended for use but for display”.52 Like other rich scholars, wealthy medics were organ-ized in small circles of knowledge exchange. Schröer himself certainly was a prosperous medic, as his extensive private library—which was offered for sale by his heirs in 1716 (see below)—demonstrates. In such networks of specialists, the main focus may not have been the content of the manuscripts, but rather the mere social function of owning such precious goods.53 Being the owner of rare books may even have led to opinion leadership in certain métiers.54 Thus, owning books of ‘learned magic’, or even having only temporary access to these, were attrac-tive goals for scholars and elitist networks of early eighteenth century Germany, even if the original purpose of these texts—guiding through a complex ‘ritual art’ that may (or may not) improve the owner’s, practi-tioner’s, or client’s life—may have faded into the background.55notes 1.

As we will see below, the distinction of two types of ‘magic’ (of which one—often dubbed ‘magia naturalis’—was considered more valuable and legitimate) remained a common topos in the eighteenth century and was adopted even in juridical and Enlightenment milieus. 7. For instance, entry No. 37 (CM 55) hosts a German Arbatel version derived from Andreas Luppius’ first German Arbatel printing, publ. in 1686 in Wesel (see on Luppius above, note 72); entry No. 15 (CM 79) hosts a hand-written version of the text Semiphoras und Schemhamphoras Salomonis Regis that was likewise printed by Andreas Luppius in 1686; No. 1 in the catalogum is lost, but it was most certainly a copy of Johann Baptist Großschedel’s Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum, first publ. in Frankfurt/Main 1619/20.

See on different concepts of ‘magia’ in early modern medicine also Müller-Jahncke (1984). 37. The earlier—but much better documented—case of Richard Napier (1559–1634) indicates that early modern physicians openly engaged with conjuring techniques and literature (such as Clavicula Salomonis). Some of Napier’s surviving documents attest that he performed lengthy ritual procedures which culminated in disputes with an archangel: see MacDonald (1981, e.g. 15–19). On the comparable figure of Robert Fludd see Rösche (2008). 38. See Dippel (1747, esp. 950–2). See on Dippel’s spiritualistic Protestantism and his engagement with Paracelsus Hannak (2013), Voss (1970). A contemporaneous German physician with a reputation in Paracelsian medicine (‘Chemiatry’) and medical procedures inspired by ‘learned magic’ was Eberhard Gockel (b. 1636), who published works such as Tractatus polyhistoricus magico-medicus curiosus (1717). 39. Not much is known about Schröer, who was born in the German city of Bautzen, Upper Lusatia, on June 14, 1669, died in Leipzig on March 17, 1716, and became a medical doctor in Erfurt in 1693 after defend-ing his doctoral dissertation on opium (De opii natura et usu). He had a few later publications on the same topic (e.g., Schröer 1696). His medi-cal patron, Gottfried Adolph Luja (1631–1714), however, seems to have had a rather anti-alchemical attitude as his “Leichenpredigt” from 1714 reveals (see Jenichen 1714). 40.

The collection is first interpreted against the back-drop of polemics and legislative acts against ‘magic’ in early eighteenth century Europe. The chapter then focusses on illegal book markets in and beyond Leipzig and the local censorship authorities and activities; finally, it provides a short history of the Leipzig collection.Keywords Book history · Magic · Censorship · Manuscripts · Book trade · Index librorum prohibitorum · LegislationPondering the ‘illegality’ of the Leipzig collection is more difficult than one might expect at first glance. Certainly, the European witch perse-cutions had unleashed a large number of polemical tractates and legal actions against the so-called ‘crimen magiae’ between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries.1 However, the ‘witchcraft’ delict had also been criticized by an ever larger number of people from the fifteenth century onwards,2 and by the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries—that is, by the time of the compilation and sale of the Leipzig collection—many early Enlightenment thinkers were engaged in an ongo-ing debate on the legal and ontological status of ‘magic’.3 Christian Thomasius, for example, denied basic capabilities ascribed to the devil and thereby fundamentally questioned the concept of ‘crimen magiae’ in his famous Theses inaugurales, de crimine magiae (Halle 1701).

OTTOmore, the aforementioned humanist discourse on ‘magia naturalis’ and related topics had formulated and advocated strikingly positive interpreta-tions of ‘magic’ ever since the late fifteenth century, which remained (at least partially) unaffected by authoritative repressions. The differentiation of two types of ‘magic’—of which one, ‘magia naturalis’, was considered valuable and legitimate and often praised in highest words—became, in fact, a common topos in early modern scholarly milieus and still informed German juridical debates of the eighteenth century (see below). The ‘ille-gality’ of the Leipzig collection is thus not a self-evident given, but has to be analytically construed in a nuanced way. In what follows, we will first interpret the collection in the light of polemics and legislative acts against ‘magic’ in the early eighteenth century, and thereafter focus on its situa-tive communicative setting, both with regard to illegal book markets in and beyond Leipzig and with a particular focus on the censorship authori-ties and activities in Leipzig. Finally, we will provide a rough sketch of the history of the collection after 1710.PoLeMics and LegaL action against ‘Magic’ in the earLy eighteenth centuryThere were three major accusations against ‘magic’ that propelled leg-islative acts against the so-called ‘crimen magiae’ between antiquity and late modernity: ‘magic’ was considered an anti-religious, ineffective, and/or anti-social ritual art. The first accusation relates to ‘magic’s’ alleged opposition towards ‘religion’ (thus from a Christian viewpoint ‘magic’ was often considered ‘heretical’ and/or ‘apostatic’), the second to ‘magic’s’ alleged opposition towards ‘science’ (or, in simpler terms, towards conventional assumptions about physical causation), and the third to ‘magic’s’ allegedly devastating societal impact. These three accu-sations already underlay the newly founded concept of ‘crimen magiae’ in the early Roman Empire (which was established around 50 CE),4 and the related formulations in the late antique Codex Theodosianus (9.16.3f), which in turn inspired a number of local legislative statutes against ‘magic’ during the European Middle Ages,5 as well as early mod-ern demonological and ‘witchcraft’ treatises such as the infamous Malleus Maleficarum.6 Even though the early modern ‘witch craze’ enhanced the semantic scope of the polemical discourse about ‘magic’ (for example by adding gender stereotypes, sophisticated theological motifs—such as the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"4 ILLEGALITY 49demon-pact theory—or anxiety-driven phantasies such as the ‘witch’s cult’7 or the devil’s ‘world conspiracy’),8 the aforementioned threefold accusation always remained the underlying argumentative pattern. This pattern also informed the so-called Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, which had been installed in 1532 as the first Empire-wide German crimi-nal law and which, with some minor changes and amendments, still was the valid criminal law in early eighteenth century Leipzig.9The Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (CCC) had, where it was enacted and observed, a regulative and easing impact on the perse-cution of ‘witches’, as it differentiated between malevolent and ben-eficient ‘Zauberei’ (the former goes back to the Latin category of ‘maleficium’ with its basal meaning of ‘malevolent ritual act’), aimed at a strong regulation of torture, and rejected stereotypical elements from the Malleus Maleficarum and other contemporaneous demono-logical texts (such as witch flight, witch Sabbath, or demon pact).10 However, it nonetheless continued to construe (malevolent) ‘Zauberei’ as religious heresy (or ‘Ketzerei’),11 questioned, at least partly, its effi-cacy (with regard to divinatory practices),12 and stressed its societal harmfulness.13 Crime as such was still considered an offense against God,14 and a convicted—and ‘successful’—performer of ‘Zauberei’ was to be sentenced with capital punishment (death penalty).15 No surprise, then, that a professor of the juridical faculty of Wittemberg, Johann Karl Naeve (1650–1714), who was aware of the Leipzig collection as early as 1713 (as he mentions some of its titles in his polemical work Jus Justitiariorum oder das Gerichts-Recht in den Städten), claims that delving into such literature may ultimately result in apostasy (“dadurch ein Mensch [...] zum Abfall von Gott gebracht warden kann”).16 Apparently, and in line with the CCC, juridical milieus of the early eighteenth century continued to adopt classical theological arguments against ‘magic’, and we may well believe that the relevant Saxon authori-ties concerned with censorship issues, mainly the ‘Bücherkommission’ in Leipzig, the Privy Council (‘Geheimer Rat’), and the High Consistory (‘Oberkonsistorium’) in Dresden, had argued or felt in a similar man-ner. Classifying non-Lutheran books of unwanted content, whether belonging to ‘learned magic’ or not, as ‘delicate’ and ‘harmful’ publica-tions without further ado was surely a common practice around 1700 for the Leipzig ‘Bücherkommission’, given that it was subordinated to the Lutheran High Consistory.17"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOYet, Johann Karl Naeve’s aforementioned work also reveals a strik-ing ambivalency, in that he also speaks of a different kind of ‘magic’ on the previous page, namely, of ‘magia naturalis’, which he perceives as the “schönste und lustigste Disciplin, welche insonders Gottes uner-meßliche Weißheit [...] zu erkennen veranlasset und eröffnet” (“the most beautiful and inspiring discipline, which allows for grasping God’s immeasurable wisdom”).18 Apparently, in the eighteenth century, lit-erature on ‘magia naturalis’ and Paracelsianism was still widely received and discussed in scholarly circles.19 The differentiation of legitimate and illegitimate types of ‘magic’ even made it into various encyclope-dic projects related to the political project of ‘Enlightenment’, such as Johann Heinrich Zedler’s Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon Aller Wissenschafften und Künste (1732–54) or Denis Diderot’s Encyclopedie, ou Dictionnaire raisonne des sciences, des arts et des métiers (1751–80). For example, the extensive (anonymously authored) article “Magie” in the Zedler differentiates a “weisse und schwartze Kunst”, devotes sub-stantial space to outlining and defending the concept of ‘magia natu-ralis’ (which is based on “insight into secret and hidden things, so that one thereby yields all kinds of strange and extraordinary effects”),20 and praises “göttliche Magie” as well as “wahre Magie” in lengthy sepa-rate articles,21 whereas ‘black magic’ (also entitled “magia diabolica” or “magia daemoniaca”) is rejected on the grounds of the typical arsenal of theological presuppositions and stereotypes.22In other words, strikingly different interpretations of ‘magic’ were still in vogue in scholarly as well as juridical debates of the early eighteenth century. At the same time, contemporaneous legal frameworks (such as the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina) stipulated, in an almost anachronis-tic manner, a very basal, that is, largely un-nuanced, theological condem-nation of ‘magic’. Despite this discrepancy, we assume that the Leipzig censorship authorities, too, evaluated the Leipzig collection in a rather undifferentiated manner. The greater part of the collection was devoted to the art of ‘conjuring spirits’ and most authors of the eighteenth cen-tury that differentiated between ‘magia naturalis’ and ‘magia daemonica’ counted such texts to the latter category (see, apart from Naeve, also Georg von Welling’s contemporaneous Opus mago-cabbalisticum et the-osophicum [first ed. 1719], where he considers the Clavicula Salomonis to be an abusive contamination of the “true art magia and cabala”).23 However, the ‘catalogus’ also attests that more than one third of the 1710 collection was devoted to ‘magia naturalis’ in one way or the other,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"4 ILLEGALITY 51and displays further textual sub-genres with a more pious slant (such as medical or kabbalistic texts).24 By forbidding the trade of all catalogued manuscripts, the censorship authorities of Leipzig thus failed to acknowl-edge, or consciously avoided, a more nuanced evaluation.censorshiP and Markets for iLLegaL Books in the eighteenth centuryAs has just been demonstrated, books of ‘learned magic’—such as those outlined in the ‘catalogus rariorum manuscriptorum’—were usually con-sidered ‘harmful’ or ‘delicate’ by censorship authorities in a rather undif-ferentiated way, and were thus the ‘banned’ goods of the early modern book markets. However, there was a gap between censorship regulations and the often ill-equipped censorship bureaucracy on the one side and financially driven activities within the thriving early modern European book market on the other.25 In fact, many scholars have emphasized the low impact and level of activity of early modern censoring, including the fragile authority of the censorship departments themselves.26 Especially the slowness or unwillingness of the administration to deal with book censorship around the year 1700 is striking.27 One reason for this was the fact that early modern book trade networks, particularly those devoted to ‘illegal’ written media, regularly and clandestinely crossed ter-ritorial borders.28 However, directed censoring processes and the author-ities’ potential to harshly punish people and books nonetheless needed to be taken into account in early modern Europe. As already mentioned, the censorship regimes of early eighteenth century Germany tended to categorize ‘magical’ or other ‘occult’ publications as harmful or deli-cate.29 The book collector Uffenbach even claimed that the entire collec-tion of manuscripts sold in 1710 was ‘indexed’ by the Roman Church.30 However, indexed books could become precious collector items. Due to the ongoing or increased demand for forbidden books in the eighteenth century, we find hot spots for selling these goods all over Europe. One of the hot spots for manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ was Leipzig.Leipzig was one of Europe’s most important points of production, collection, and distribution of all sorts of written media during the eight-eenth century, and in German-speaking Europe it was also the main publishing centre and book fair, only paralleled by Hamburg. Leipzig, with about 28,000 inhabitants around 1700, was thus a good place to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOacquire, organize, produce, offer, sell and re-sell all kinds of (handwrit-ten and printed) publications.31 The city’s numerous bookshops and bookstalls were full of legal and illegal written media. Accordingly, any kind of distribution control of forbidden books was a fruitless business in early eighteenth century Leipzig.32 Due to the political and territo-rial pluralism of the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, the censorship regime of the Electorate of Saxony was far from being effective. In fact, effective censorship campaigns (at either the Imperial or state level) were almost impossible.33 The difficult situation of the Saxon censor-ship regime is best understood against the backdrop of the growing local book trade as well as the thriving print and publishing industries during the seventeenth century.34 Due to the Saxon policy of protecting rele-vant industries and promoting their supreme position within the German and European book markets, censorship was not given the highest pri-ority compared to other territories of Europe. The Bücherkommission in Leipzig, set up at the end of the sixteenth century to supervise the Leipzig book trade and to provide a body for both censorship and the regulation of reprinting within the entire Electorate, has been described as a rather generous board of authority.35 Most of the time, the censor-ship activities on the ongoing illegal flows of the local and regional book market were either not effective or not pursued at all. Around 1700, the Bücherkommission was well known for its administrative sluggishness and aversion to dealing with book censorship.36 However, now and then the Saxon authorities were keen to censor topics that might stir up con-troversial debate about religious or political issues in the Electorate.37 In these rare moments, the Saxon authorities initiated censorship activities towards delicate publications, usually by questioning printers and book-sellers followed by inspections of bookshops and, if needed, confisca-tions. As we shall see, this is precisely what happened in the case of the Leipzig collection.censoring the LeiPzig coLLectionIn late 1714, 4 years after the publication of the printed ‘catalogus’ and the sale of the manuscripts, the Leipzig Bücherkommission began its investigations. As may have happened often in these times, it took the Saxon authorities for censorship several years to detect a delicate pub-lication such as the ‘catalogus rariorum manuscriptorum’.38 According to the relevant files, it is unclear how the authorities became aware of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"4 ILLEGALITY 53the catalogue. The files only reveal that in mid-November 1714 the word—and the catalogue—had reached the administrative circles around the Elector of Saxony. Books of ‘learned magic’, or a lengthy catalogue offering such, alarmed the Lutheran (and partly Catholic) ministers, who immediately reported the case to the Leipzig Bücherkommission. The Elector ordered confiscation of all available catalogues and forbade the trade in these manuscripts (“die in beygefügtem Catalogo specificirten MSta”).39 Controls were mandated in selected Leipzig bookshops, and booksellers were questioned: it turned out that the local bookseller August Martini40 had not only received copies of the catalogue “from a good friend” (“von einem guten freunde bekommen”)—likely the sell-ing agent and contact person for the sale in 1710, Paul Kühtze—but had also arranged a reprint run of “a few copies” (“einige Exemplaria”) due to ongoing demand.41 The censorship records in Leipzig further reveal that the printer, the Leipzig-based Gottfried Rothe, produced at least 100 additional copies of the catalogue in 1712,42 and both Rothe and Martini stated in their interrogations that a previous edition of the cata-logue had been published in 1710 by a printer-publisher from Augsburg` named “Küsze”; i.e., Paul Kühtze.43 However, the investigations seem to have stopped abruptly as soon as the authorities failed to seize the cor-pus. According to Uffenbach, the new owner of the collection became aware (“bekame [...] Wind”) of the censorship activities and translocated the collection to a safe place soon thereafter.44the history of the coLLection after 1710What happened to the Leipzig collection after the censorship authori-ties failed to seize the corpus in 1714? Later sources at least allow for providing a rough outline. On the last page of the 1732 edition, Roth-Scholtz lists seven manuscript titles which had, in the meantime, been sold off from the collection for 100 guilders each.45 However, his revised catalogue now includes 142 manuscripts, indicating that the new owner must have added another nine manuscripts to the collection. According to the two most important sources on the destination of the collec-tion, Uffenbach and Roth-Scholtz, the collection went—after the death of the new owner—either to the Leipzig-based “Raths-Bibliothec” (Uffenbach)46 or to the Dresden-based “Königlich-Pohlnische und Churfürstlich-Sächsische Bibliothec” (Roth-Scholtz).47"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"54 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOAccording to the head of special collections at Leipzig University Library, Thomas Fuchs, the present collection is an amalgamation of several sources48: the major part of the collection stems from the ‘Stadtbibliothek’ Leipzig—previously the ‘Raths-Bibliothec’, which indicates that Uffenbach’s narrative is more likely. In fact, in 1838 Emil Wilhelm Robert Naumann published an annotated catalogue of all manuscript holdings of the ‘Stadtbibliothek’ (Catalogus libro-rum manuscriptorum qui in Bibliotheca Senatoria Civitatis Lipsiensis asservantur), which includes the collection. At that time, it comprised 140 manuscripts (which may indicate, again, minor losses and amend-ments).49 Naumann apparently re-arranged the collection by using the new signature “Cod. mag.”, which explains the difference between the ‘old’ numeration of the 1710 ‘catalogus’50 and the ‘new’ Cod. mag. numeration (the new order seems, however, as arbitrary as the old one).51 Due to archive losses during World War II, Leipzig University Library has no further information on the pre-history of this part of the collection. The second part of the collection, which consists of three manuscripts only, came from the private library of Christoph Wagenseil (1633–1705),52 and two other sources.53 However, as these losses and amendments are quite minor, the collection advertised in the catalogue of 1710 already comprised some 95% of the collection hosted today in Leipzig University Library.How did the collection arrive at the ‘Rhatsbibliothek Leipzig’ in the first place? According to Uffenbach’s report (published in 1753, but written before 1734), the buyer of the 1710 collection died soon after the transaction and bequeathed it to the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’.54 We do not know, however, why Schröer had actually sold his manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ (in contrast to other parts of his extensive private library: see below), and why the new owner bequeathed the collection to the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’ after his death. Regarding the latter question, the heirs of the new owner (the sons of Heinrich Linck?) may have bestowed the collection to the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’ due to its—in their eyes—obnoxious or offensive contents. The contemporaneous case of the Lossau collec-tion (Hamburg) indicates that such inter-generational dynamics could have an impact on the early modern transmission of delicate or ‘banned’ books.55What we do know, however, is that Schröer, the Leipzig medic and previous owner of the collection, had a much more extensive library"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"4 ILLEGALITY 55that was offered for sale (apparently without the 140 manuscripts out-lined in the ‘catalogus’) in 1716, shortly after his death, by his heirs.56 We know further that the rest of his extensive library, that is, those parts which were not sold in or after 1716, was bequeathed to the ‘Rhatsbibliothek Leipzig’ in 1729,57 whereby the ‘magical’ and ‘non-magical’ parts of Schröer’s collection were reunited. Note that almost all manuscripts that belong to the 1710 sale are, up to this day, bound in colored paper of the eighteenth century: this (new) binding must have been added by an employee of the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’ after having received the estate. That said, the numbering of the manuscripts (on almost all title pages), which precisely corresponds to the catalogue’s order58 must have happened either before 1710 (during the selling prep-arations) or after 1729 (after both the collection and the catalogue were archived by the ‘Rhatsbibliothek’). In 1962 the collection moved from the ‘Stadtbibliothek’ to Leipzig University Library, where it remains til this day.Interestingly, from the late eighteenth century on, the collection seems to have avoided scholarly attention until very recently. Neither Georg Conrad Horst,59 nor Johann Scheible,60 nor Johann Georg Theodor Gräße61—the three most important German editors and bibliographers of ‘learned magic’ in the nineteenth century—seem to have been aware of the Leipzig collection. The neglect by Scheible and Gräße is particularly suprising as they could have consulted the anno-tated catalogue published by Naumann in 1838. Most twentieth cen-tury scholars of German ‘Volkskunde’ seem to have overlooked the collection, too (notably Peuckert, Wunderlich, Daxelmüller). Not even Stephan Bachter, who takes into account a large number of German manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ in his Anleitung zum Aberglauben (2005), was aware of the collection (even though he consulted the nearby archives of Weimar and Gotha). The first and only scholarly edi-tion of one of the shorter texts (entry No. 59 = CM 31) saw the light of day in 2013.62 Recently, all extant manuscripts of the 1710 collec-tion and seven complementary manuscripts of the university’s stock63 have been digitized and can now be accessed via its online platform (URL: https://histbest.ub.uni-leipzig.de).

The findings of the book are interpreted from the perspectives of book history and the history of ‘Western learned magic’.Keywords Book history · Magic · Censorship · Manuscripts · Book trade · Early modern cultureAt the outset of this study we have called for an interdisciplinary, integra-tive, and thus more comprehensive analysis of books of ‘learned magic’ in and beyond early modern times. For us this meant to combine our respective expertise in book history and the history of ‘magic’, and to interpret the Leipzig collection as an artefact of both the longue-durée tradition of ‘Western learned magic’ as well as the early modern book market. Our findings may therefore be interpreted from two angles.From the perspective of book history and the early modern book trade, it has become evident that no later than the early eighteenth century, books of ‘learned magic’ had become extremely valuable trad-ing goods. Particularly manuscripts of ‘learned magic’, such as the ones assembled in the Leipzig collection, were ‘scarce’ goods of the early modern book market. They were per definitionem singletons, their CHAPTER 5Conclusions© The Author(s) 2017 D. Bellingradt and B.-C.

OTTOproduction must have been time-consuming and costly, they came with an attached aura of secrecy and underground transmission, and they often promised great age. On the other hand, our research has also revealed that ‘demand determined supply’ in the eighteenth century trade in books of ‘learned magic’, and that there may have been enough clever entrepreneurs who provided an on-going and ever greater sup-ply of such ‘scarce’ manuscripts. Contemporaneous critics have, in fact, suggested that the many variations across allegedly similar books of ‘learned magic’—such as the Clavicula Salomonis, which comes in seven very different manuscript versions in the Leipzig collection—are due to a quasi-industrial production of such manuscripts at the time. From a practitioner’s or sympathizer’s perspective, however, manuscript trans-mission (with all its difficulties, risks, and sources of error) was the only contemporaneous means to conserve and hand on ritual techniques and theorizations of ‘Western learned magic’. Even though the ‘illegality’ of this textual-ritual tradition was not self-evident, but a matter of on-going dispute, polemics and stereotypes against ‘magic’ were still widespread in the eighteenth century, thus preventing open circulation and also a more nuanced assessment of the Leipzig collection by theological, juridical or censorship authorities. Ritual mechanics provide another reason for manuscript transmission in the realm of ‘learned magic’ during an alleged ‘age of print’: at least some of its ritual disciplines (foremost the art of ‘conjuring spirits’) necessitated a personalized, consecrated and proverbially handmade ritual handbook, which, apart from transporting textual information, embodied ritual authenticity and efficacy.Most interestingly, however, our findings reveal that by the eight-eenth century, books of ‘learned magic’ at least partly travelled along the regular routines and trading procedures of the early modern book market. The Leipzig collection sold in 1710 was offered by a regular bookseller, announced by a trading catalogue, and sold from a biblio-phile to a bibliophile without further consequences for either of them. This could, of course, only happen because of the striking ineffectiveness of the Saxon censorship authorities in those days, which became aware of the collection only years after the sale and obviously failed to seize the corpus. Due to this ineffectiveness, individual, as well as circles of scholars, wealthy collectors and book traders alike played their game without risking serious consequences. This game, however, was a pricey one: the 140 manuscripts of the Leipzig collection were sold for a sum that would have built two to three new bourgeois houses in the city of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"5 CONCLUSIONS 69Leipzig. Apparently, trading such manuscripts was one of the most lucra-tive business activities of those days, not only for booksellers.The demand for such manuscripts was elitist in nature, fuelled by scholarly fascination, the collecting passion of rich elites, sometimes prac-tical interests (for example in medicine), and driven by status motiva-tions. Apparently, in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a fairly unknown medic from Leipzig, Samuel Schröer (1669–1716), who was, like many of his day, affined to Paracelsian and alchemic dis-course, had access to a sufficient degree of social spaces and monetary resources to acquire and compile this extensive collection. The excep-tionality as well as the appeal of the collection is also portrayed in the striking after-life of the 1710 selling catalogue, which was reprinted several times by different editors over the course of the eighteenth cen-tury. In fact, a few rich book collectors, such as Friedrich Roth-Scholtz or Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach, hunted such collections all over Europe. Once in their hands, however, books of ‘learned magic’ may have lost their original purpose (providing a ‘ritual art’ that may or may not improve one’s life) and instead became barter or status objects on library shelves, satisfying nothing more than the collector’s passion.From the perspective of the history of ‘Western learned magic’, the Leipzig collection once more calls for taking books of ‘learned magic’ seriously and releasing them from bibliographic remainder cat-egories such as ‘curiosa’, ‘rariorum’, or ‘superstitiosa’: categories that cannot grasp their apparent complexity and heterogeneity, nor were they ever meant to. In a nutshell, the Leipzig collection is perfectly suited for highlighting some core features of ‘Western learned magic’: it reveals the longue-durée character of this textual-ritual tradition (with numerous texts going back to the Middle Ages or even late Antiquity), its strik-ing interculturality (with, for example, seven different versions of the Clavicula Salomonis in three different languages), its highbrow com-plexity and intellectual demands (with ritual prescriptions of hundreds of pages and various language prerequisites), and its ritual and concep-tual heterogeneity and hybridity (with numerous sub-disciplines such as ‘conjuring spirits’, ‘kabbalistic’ speculations on the power of words, ‘magia naturalis’, or a vast range of divination techniques). The schol-arly investigation of this tradition is still only in its beginnings, as the almost complete scholarly unawareness of the Leipzig collection until very recently reveals, particularly with regard to exploring, comparing,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"70 D. BELLINGRADT AND B.-C. OTTOand historicizing the exuberant mass of early modern manuscripts of ‘learned magic’ which have survived til this day.1In this regard, the Leipzig collection indicates that processes of ‘democratization’, ‘popularization’, and ‘vernacularization’ of ‘learned magic’ happened significantly earlier than so far assumed in German-speaking Europe. Particularly German ‘Volkskundler’ have argued that such processes emerged and had their climax only over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Leipzig collection indicates that these scholars may have focused too much on printed editions—which do have their peak in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—while, at the same time, neglecting extant manuscripts, and thus failed in dating these processes accurately. The collection sold in 1710 (of which more than four-fifths of the manuscripts host German translations) appears to be rather the end-product of a longer process of collecting, copying, vernacularizing, and re-assembling texts of ‘learned magic’ in German-speaking Europe. Yet, as we have not been able to identify pre-vious and comparably large collections of Germanized texts of ‘learned magic’, the Leipzig corpus seems to merit a prominent, if not unique, spot in the history of ‘Western learned magic’.Large book collections of ‘learned magic’, however, pose a problem to both the historian as well as the practitioner of ‘Western learned magic’. Given that we often encounter a rigidly formalistic interpretation of rit-ual efficacy within the texts (i.e., they usually advocate the idea that every single ritual element must be enacted according to the script in order to enhance or guarantee ritual success), one wonders what to do when one comes across seven different manuscript versions of a text, which pre-scribe seven different ritual procedures. This problem may have become more severe over the course of early modernity, with more and more circulating versions and, eventually, the compilation of extensive book collections of ‘learned magic’. While we do not know how a practitioner of the eighteenth century coped with this form of cognitive dissonance (‘which script is the correct one?’), the logic might have been reversed in the contemporaneous book hunter’s mind: the more versions, the more curious the ‘magical art’, and the more complete the collection."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"5 CONCLUSIONS 71note1.

The notes (VII) will include a brief content analysis of each manuscript, and further useful or relevant information.Notes on Content analyses (Bernd-Christian Otto) The content analyses of the manuscripts (in entry VII) will focus on identifying basic textual or ritual genres and structures, including potential templates, rather than individual details or recipe patterns (only shorter texts allow for highlighting ritual details). If possible, dynamics of later transmis-sion and impact are addressed. All indicated page numbers refer to the numeration in the digitized versions of the manuscripts provided by the university library of Leipzig, abbreviated as ‘i.’ (image). Inevitably, some technical terminology is used to describe textual contents: many manu-scripts of the Leipzig collection are replete with ‘voces magicae’ (‘words of power’), character sequences that have no apparent semantic mean-ing and/or syntactic structure, but which come with an aura of a hidden signifié—they may, for instance, refer to angel or demon names—and of enhanced ritual efficacy (see on ‘voces magicae’, whose roots lie in antiq-uity, Flint 1999, 46–51 and passim). In a similar vein, ‘charactêres’ are omnipresent in the Leipzig collection: in contrast to ‘voces magicae’, these are letters or signs written in mysterious, unknown or illegible script; similar to ‘voces magicae’, they may have a hidden signifié and are believed to provide enhanced ritual efficacy (see on ‘charactêres’, whose roots again lie in antiquity, Gordon 2014). ‘Conjuring spirits’ is one of the most important sub-disciplines of ‘learned magic’ and forms the focus of more than half of the manuscripts of the Leipzig collection (on some of its texts and ritual mechanics see, exemplarily, Fanger 1998 and 2012). Two important sub-techniques of the art of ‘conjuring spirits’ are (1) the use of ‘sigils’: these are sophisticated circular or rectangular arrangements of drawings, ‘voces magicae’ and/or ‘charactêres’, which may be inscribed onto paper, parchment, amulets or rings, and sewn into one’s clothes or held in one’s hand during the conjuration procedure"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A: THE CATALOGUS RARIORUM MANUSCRIPTORUM 75(on some late medieval examples see Grévin/Véronèse 2004); and (2) the use of ‘ritual circles’ drawn on the ground, often equipped with ‘voces magicae’ (typically in Latin, Greek and/or Hebrew script) and/or ‘charactêres’ (on ‘ritual circles’ see Kieckhefer 1998, 170–86). Finally, some of the manuscripts display ‘kabbalistic’ contents: ‘kabbalah’ here refers to an early modern Christian tradition of pseudo-Jewish lore, which is characterized by angelological speculations and/or angel con-jurations, the importance and ritual use of powerful words (‘voces magi-cae’), numerological speculations, and/or the idea of God’s gradual creation of the world (usually in ten emanations called ‘Sephirot’).

Its most important com-ponents are a treatise on the 99 names of God (i. 24–50) in the first chapter which resembles medieval Islamic lore (see on the 99 names of God in Islam, e.g., Aḥmad ibn a-Būnī’s Kitāb Šams al-Maʾārif al-Kubra, ed. Coullaut Cordero 2009; prayers to these 99 names are repeated sev-eral times throughout the manuscript: see i. 75–88, 138–147); a list of angels ascribed to the seven planets in the second chapter (i. 55–65); and portions of the Sworn Book of Honorius (Liber Iuratus Honorii) in the third, fourth and fifth chapters (for a critical edition of this late medi-eval ritual text see Hedegård 2002).

A first printing of the German text was pub-lished in 1725 by Peter Hammer (Cologne), presumably based on the Wolfenbüttel manuscript; a surviving Aramaic version (Ms. Bodleian Opp. 594) seems to have been translated from a German template in the eighteenth century (see Scholem 1974, 186). Apart from a ‘biography’ of Abrahamn von Worms (first chapter), and some shorter recipes (second chapter), the text outlines a lengthy ritual performance—of some 18 months (see i. 207)—for acquiring one’s ‘guardian angel’ (third chapter). The fourth and last chapter provides 251 (5x5) letter squares for a vast range of ritual goals (i. 377–465). The text has been highly influential from the late nineteenth century onwards as in 1898 one of the leading figures of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Samuel MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918), published an English transla-tion of the text, based on a corrupted French translation of the German original (see Mathers 1898). Mathers’ version served as an inspirational source for Aleister Crowley’s Liber Samekh (see Crowley 1929, Appendix IV) and thereby remained crucial to practitioners of the 20th and 21st centuries.No. 6I.

Divided into six chapters, it provides a large variety of short recipes for all sorts of rit-ual goals, wherein the ritual focus lies on uttering or writing efficacious words (voces magicae); in the sixth chapter a variety of rectangular word squares with Hebrew letters are depicted. An extensive table of contents can be found at the end of the manuscript (i. 226–234).

There are numerous earlier (Arabic, Latin, English) texts of the ‘treasure hunting’ genre which, however, provide informa-tion on different geographical regions. The text catalogues hundreds of German treasure sites, devoid of any geographical or logical order. While the bulk of the text provides information on directions and locations, there are only a few short ritual recipes, which focus on alchemy and/or astrology (see, e.g., i. 140f). As these are mostly based on the manip-ulation of material artefacts and do not display conjuration techniques, the text deviates from most other ‘treasure hunting’ manuscripts in the Leipzig collection, where ‘conjuring spirits’ plays a pivotal role.

Due to the absence of ‘Solomonic’ narrative and ritual patterns and its rather pious charac-ter, the text seems to reflect discourses on Christian ‘kabbalah’, pre-nineteenth century ‘theosophy’, or Rosicrucianism. Ritual procedures for ascending through the heavens can already be found in late ancient Coptic manuscripts (see, exemplarily, Meyer/Smith 1994, No. 39 = pp. 66–70).

Manuscript title without reference of the catalogue numberThis text speculates on the ‘name of God’, which is in Hebrew some-times called Shemhamphorasch (Hebr. ha-Shem ha-mefôrash: ‘the com-plete / real name of God’). One of the earliest European texts that attests this motif is the late medieval ritual text Liber Iuratus Honorii (see above, entry No. 2 = CM16), where the Shemhamphorasch appears in a circular sigil as a sequence of 72 Hebrew characters (see Hedegård 2002, 131). CM 79 hosts a scribal copy of a text that was printed under the same title in 1686 by Andreas Luppius in Wesel (see VD17 32:682570C). It discusses different versions of the Shemhamphorash (here interpreted as groups of angel names—the text is replete with voces magicae), which have accumulated over the centuries; a short survey of the text can be found in Veenstra 2012, 169–70.No. 16I.

Manuscript title with reference “N. 16”This is a Latin version of the Clavicula Salomonis ascribed to ‘Behencatrus’ (or ‘Rehencatricus’), an alleged pupil of the ancient ‘sage’ Apollonius of Tyana. Parts of the manuscript may be related to a Latin template entitled Liber Behencasin, which had already been mentioned by Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) in his Antipalus Maleficiorum (com-posed around 1508, first publ. 1555; for an edition of this early mod-ern list of ‘learned magic’ books see Zambelli 2007, 101–112: the liber Behencasin is mentioned on p. 109) and which had already provided sig-ils ascribed to the seven planets (a Latin text entitled Behencatri viri sapi-entis et regis in India can be found in Ms. Gent university library 1021 A, fol. 59v–62r). Due to its focus on planetary sigils, CM 19 differs from the Clavicula Salomonis version in the above entries No. 7 and 8 (CM 2 and 3). In Mathiesen’s typologization of the Clavicula Salomonis genre (Mathiesen 2007), it thus belongs to the [OT2] text group, even though it is divided into three books entitled “De Instrumentis Invisibilibus” (i. 9f), “De Visibilibus Instrument [sic!]” (i. 42f), and “De Invocationibus Spirituum sive de praxi totius operis” (i. 103f). Apart from numerous planetary sigils, the manuscript provides drawings of the ritual circle (i. 123) and ritual devices such as knives, staffs, and swords (i. 125–26). Further manuscripts of the Leipzig collection that depict planetary sigils are entries Nos. 29 (CM 72), 54 (CM 4), 55 (CM 5), 69 (CM 39), 70 (CM 93), 71 (CM 94), 72 (CM 38), and 73 (CM 92).No. 17I.

However, the text really outlines a ritual procedure for spiritual ascension towards God, or self-deification, whereby the practitioner achieves miraculous abilities and thus the full potential of ‘magia naturalis’. After an outline of some ritual prerequisites (e.g., i. 13: ‘one shall love and trust God wholeheartedly’; i. 15: ‘know thyself ’—‘Erkenne Dich Selbst’) and an astrological table (i. 14), the text provides lengthy theological and/or the-oretical explanations of the ascension procedure, wherein particular impor-tance is ascribed to the name of Jesus Christ (i. 19–20). Only in its final part (i. 37f) do we encounter ritual prescriptions, among them lengthy pre-for-mulated prayers with voces magicae (some of them in Hebrew: i. 42, 44). Interestingly, the text identifies the Christian motif of ‘Jacob’s ladder’ (i. 41) with the ‘Gnostic’ or Neoplatonic motif of ascending through the ‘seven heavens’ (i.e., the planets: i. 38–40, 44–45). Two cryptic drawings (equipped with Hebrew letters) exemplify the procedure (i. 41, 54) and relate, it is claimed (i. 40), to John Dee’s Monas Hieroglyphica (first publ. 1564).No. 24I.

Johannes Trithemius in his Antipalus Maleficiorum (see above, entry No. 16 = CM 19) had already mentioned a number of Latin texts devoted to zodi-acal or planetary sigils ascribed to Hermes (Trismegistus), Appolonius of Tyana, Ptolemy, Geber (Jābir ibn Hayyān), or Arnaldus de Villanova. The origin of this genre is thus most likely Arabic. This Germanized version is divided into four chapters and first provides 24 neatly drawn circular sigils inscribed with charactêres, pentagrams, and voces magi-cae—two for each of the 12 zodiacal signs (i. 8–19).

A fourth and last chapter is devoted to the fabrication of two divinatory mirrors, a ‘male’ and a ‘female’ one, which are to be inscribed with two sophisticated sigils (see i. 44, 46).No. 30I.

CM 135 provides reci-pes for ‘Liebe und Freundschaft’ (‘love and friendship’: i. 5) and seems to have been translated from a Latin template. Due to its differentiation of ‘magia naturalis’, ‘magia supernaturalis’, and ‘magia diabolica’, the text is divided into three chapters. The difference between these three catego-ries is that the first set of ‘experiments’ is based on the manipulation of herbs and other material artefacts, whereas the second and the third sets are based on prayers to angels and demons, respectively (the latter include ‘Beelzebub’: i. 15).No. 31I.

It is divided into seven ‘tracts’ (the last tract on ‘different cabalistic experiments’ is sub-divided into a further six chapters), and provides different ‘natural’ and ‘supernatural’ recipes in most chapters. While the focus of the text lies on ‘Festmachen’ and also the ‘Festgemachte wieder aufzuthun’ (i.e. becoming vulnerable again: i. 14), there are also recipes for fabricating a ‘Thephrasti magical sword’ that dispels all enemies (i. 19), overcoming one’s enemies, or conquering a city. A contemporaneous German desig-nation for such practices was ‘Passauer Kunst’ since Johannes Staricius’ Helden-Schatz (first publ. 1615), a widely read collection of ritual recipes for military purposes that could be seen as a side-product of the early modern discourse on ‘magia naturalis’. Interestingly, CM 134 provides images of apotropaic sigils which are mentioned but missing in Staricius’ Helden-Schatz and which, worn on the body, provide immunity against gunshot wounds (see i. 12 and 13).

German (title and content)VII. Manuscript title with reference “Num. 38”This treatise outlines a ritual procedure for ‘enclosing’ (‘einschließen’) a spirit into a glass or a ring. It first outlines the preparation of a golden or silver ring (drawing on i. 6), and a glass or glass bottle (drawings on i. 7 and 8), each inscribed with charactêres and the names of archangels. The procedure is to take place on the evening of the third day of Pentecost in a quiet and secret location, and works by means of prayers, fumiga-tions, consecrations, a ritual circle drawn to the ground and on paper or parchment (drawing on i. 13), and, finally, a short conjuration of the ‘masters of all spirits Astharot, Beelzebub, Sathan and Lucifer’ (i. 11). Interestingly, the text here refers to stronger conjurations taken from the ‘large Clavicula Salomonis’ (i. 12) in case the spirits do not obey and appear. If they do, they will deliver another spirit which may be incarcer-ated into the glass or ring by means of the same conjuration formula. The glass or ring is to be sealed with a ‘cap’ (‘Deckel’: i. 12) and the encapsulated spirit will report ‘all past, present and future things’ (i. 13).

Manuscript title with reference “Num. 39”This is a German translation of one of the many exorcist manuals that circulated in early modern Europe. Its title ‘Teufelspeitsche’ seems to resemble the (Latin) works of the Franciscan monk Girolamo Menghi (1529–1609), foremost his Flagellum Daemonum (first publ. 1576, Bologna; also Frankfurt 1706) and his Fustis Daemonum (first publ. Bologna 1584, also Frankfurt 1708) which circulated all over Europe (see Probst 2008). Of course, Menghi’s manuals were not only used for exorcistic rituals, but also for other purposes such as treasure hunt-ing or curing impotency (Davies 2009, 59). Likely for these reasons, they were added to the papal Index in 1709, i.e. shortly before the sale of the Leipzig collection. In German speaking regions, the title ‘Teufelspeitsche’ was also used to denote amulets or leaves inscribed with Christian iconography and voces magicae, which were used for apo-tropaic or healing purposes (see Jacoby 1927/28).As expected, the ‘exorcistic’ procedures outlined in CM 7 are more or less similar to those outlined in most ‘conjuring spirits’ texts of the Leipzig collection. Both text genres correspond with respect to ritual techniques—the Teufelspeitsche makes extensive use of pre-formulated prayers replete with voces magicae, or of fumigations and prescribed timeframes—and with regard to ritual goals—consider, for instance, the last recipe for summoning a spirit whenever the ‘exorcist deems that it is time to make use of it’ (i. 159); the text also provides numerous recipes for conjuring the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire). Apparently, early modern discourses on ‘exorcism’ and ‘learned magic’ were largely intertwined and produced very similar ritual texts; the same observation is made in the recent edition of an exorcistic manuscript from Munich (Chave-Mahir/Véronèse 2015).No. 40I.

The ritual includes numerous steps, such as fasting; preparing a dagger made of steel and the horn of a ram inscribed with the names of the three patriarchs Abraham, Isac, and Jacob; and going to remote run-ning water and washing one’s body and clothes for three days in a row. Thereafter one takes a ‘dead head’ (i.e. the skull of someone ‘who has long died, and made clean of all flesh and filth’: i. 5), bathes it with holy water, inscribes—with the dagger—four voces magicae onto the skull (i. 6/7: ‘Cortornifer, Forfornifer, Angerion, Cornigerion’), draws a ritual circle of nine cubits and utters a lengthy invocation to the four above-mentioned spirits. After the third or fourth repetition, the spirit(s) will enter the skull and ‘give an answer to everything’ (i. 8). Thereafter one is to release the spirit with another formula.

During the conjuration procedure—which includes the usual ele-ments (astrological timeframes, bodily preparations, fumigations, ritual devices, invocations with voces magicae, and a ritual circle)—, a trian-gle plays a pivotal role. CM 75 provides drawings of the ritual circle (i. 48/49), and some of the prayers are written in Latin (e.g. i. 30–32).

The text was, in all likelihood, translated from Latin, given the Latin chapter headings and several untranslated prayer sections. Some of the 20 spirit names correspond to those mentioned in the above entry No. 41 (CM 76), such as ‘Aziel’ (i. 20), ‘Nestorat’ (i. 36), ‘Paymon’ (i. 38), or ‘Waran’ (i. 61).No. 44I.

This treatise begins with a peculiar drawing of a curly-haired figure in a loincloth surrounded by charactêres (i. 5), and thereafter provides a lengthy formula for conjuring ‘Baron’. Only at the end of the text we learn that this spirit will answer all questions, procure all desired things, and yield ‘harmony’ (‘Eintracht’: i. 9) between a man and a woman.No. 45I. J.

Manuscript title with reference “Num. 45”With entry No. 45 begins a series of eight German treatises of ‘conjur-ing spirits’ ascribed to Johann Georg Faust, the man behind the ‘Faust legend’, and/or his disciple Christoph Wagner. This text is divided into three parts. The first part is divided into eight chapters and outlines a lengthy conjuration procedure for treasure hunting; it provides drawings of ritual circles, sophisticated sigils (i. 18), numerous charactêres, and of the spirit ‘Mephistophiles’ who will appear ‘in the shape of a monk’ (i. 23). Similar to the entries No. 42 (CM 75) and 129 (CM 102), the treasure guarding spirits are called ‘pigmies’ (see i. 38). The second part is divided into 22 chapters and provides information on potential treas-ure sites and procedures for fabricating divinatory devices for finding such sites (such as a ‘metallic divining rod’: i. 56f; a ‘little magical bell’: i. 57f; several ‘magical mirrors’: i. 60f; several ‘cristalls’: i. 85f; and several sigils). The final part consists of four chapters, and provides astrological timeframes as well as drawings of sigils used for releasing the spirits.No. 46I. J.

Thereafter ‘Dr. Faust’ reports in first person how he became affiliated with ‘learned magic’ and outlines his first experiences of ‘conjuring spirits’ (i. 9–14). A list of six spirits follows, which pro-vides their sigils (i. 15–16) and voces magicae; the preparation of the ritual circle is outlined (double-page drawing on i. 36–37) and conju-ration formulae for each spirit are given (partly in Latin). Interestingly, the end of the text cites—with page numbers—from a Clavicula Salomonis version, thereby providing cipher abbreviations for some of the voces magicae depicted earlier in the text (compare i. 28–30 and 43–47; similar lists can be found in entries No. 46 and 52 = CM 138 and 22)No. 48I.

The first chapter outlines the preparation of the practitioner, the ritual circle (drawing on i. 9), two circular sigils, and various paper leaves inscribed with charactêres (i. 10, 12). The second part provides seven different conjuration formulae in total (including alternative ritual circles and sigils). The text advises the practitioner to browse quickly through the manuscript and try out different formulae during the procedure as the spirits are ‘indescribably’ quick and ‘will pretend to jump into the circle and to tear you apart and to devour you’ (i. 15); the chapter ends with a release formula and a conclusive prayer.

That the present ver-sion originated from Paracelsian hands is even more unlikely as the 150 ‘psalms’ outlined here are in fact short recipes for all sorts of ritual goals and often intermingled with charactêres that are to be written on paper or metal lamens, together with short prayers. The text appears to be translated from a Latin template (see, e.g., i. 10).

Further chapters focus on efficacious names of God (voces magi-cae are provided in Latin and Hebrew script: see i. 22–23), angelology (i. 38–45) and the inherent structure of the world (crucial terminology is provided in both Hebrew and German: i. 54–58). Particularly note-worthy are the beautiful foldout drawings of the kabbalistic ‘tree of life’ and the ‘pyramis lucis’ (i. 5–6), which may have been derived from the second volume of Athanasius Kircher’s Oedipus Aegyptiacus (first publ. 1652–54).No. 59I.

The 100-line poem outlines the creation of the world, the role of Jesus Christ, and some rules and prerequisites for the true Christian from a kabbalistic view-point, thus displaying Rosenroth’s idea of a genuinely ‘Christian kabba-lah’. Interestingly, the Leipzig manuscript provides an additional column next to the poem text where Latin terms and short commentaries are provided, thus adding a second and more technical level of interpreta-tion.

Interestingly, it is argued in chapter 4 (i. 14–16) that we are here deal-ing with a purely ‘Christian’ art that should not be considered ‘sorcery’ (‘zauberey’).

Manuscript title with reference “Num. 66”CM 24 is ascribed to Abraham von Franckenberg (1593–1652), a German mystic and esoteric author as well as friend and biographer of Jacob Böhme. Franckenberg published several works of ‘learned magic’ under his pseudonym Amadeus von Friedleben, the most important being Raphael oder Artzengel, a treatise devoted to the healing powers of archangel Raphael and the doctrine of signatures. CM 24 is all about numerology and richly illustrated with all sorts of tables, drawings, and diagrams. It is divided into 12 chapters; each chapter discusses various issues and numerological calculations related to the number of the respec-tive chapter. The text may have been translated from a Latin template, as the annotations in some of the tables reveal. A numerological treatise of Franckenberg is currently unheard of, thus making it likely that this is a pseudepigraphic reference.No. 67I.

The idea goes back to the fictional French story Comte de Gabalis, which was first published anonymously in 1670 but authored by Nicolas-Pierre-Henri de Montfaucon de Villars (1635–1673). The story takes place in an Rosicrucian milieu and discusses, as one of its main motifs, the possibility of receiving ‘supreme wisdom’ and ‘spiritual rebirth’ by marrying an elemental being. The fourfold distinction of salamanders (fire), nymphs (water), sylphs (air), and gnomes (earth) goes back to a (Pseudo-) Paracelsian treatise entitled Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus (first publ. Basel 1590), but the idea"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A: THE CATALOGUS RARIORUM MANUSCRIPTORUM 127of ‘marrying elements’ was popularized by de Villar’s Comte de Gabalis, which was widely read after its publication (see Hanegraaff 2012, 222–27, for further details). It is surprising that, only a few decades after the publication of Comte de Gabalis, we encounter a German manual on how one can actually put the idea into practice. Until now it has been assumed that such practices emerged in the late nineteenth century only, with the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor as one of its first recipe-holders (see for their ritual procedure Godwin/Chanel/Deveney 1995, 107–120).As this is an interesting finding, the ritual mechanics outlined in this treatise shall be summarized in greater detail: choose a new, clean room; equip it with a new bed, mattress, pillow, table, armchair or chair and fumigate frankincense and myrrh for several days. On the first Friday of a new moon fast until the ‘stars are in the sky’ (i. 5); wear a new skirt, pants, socks, shoes and hat, and go to the room at ten o’clock in the evening without telling anyone. Fumigate the room and equip the table with plates, bread, vases and glasses with fresh fountain water as well as a ‘pentaculum veneris’ (i. 6). Thereafter follows a series of prayers to be uttered while sitting on a chair in front of the door (where ‘the spirits [Geister] shall enter’: i. 7) which include several series of voces magicae written in red ink. After the last invocation one hears a ‘noise’ (‘Geräusche’: i. 9) and is to lay down on the bed, while three ‘dames’ (‘Weibsbilder’: 9) of ‘angellike beauty’ (‘englischer Schönheit’: i. 9–10) will enter the room, greet you and laugh pleasantly while sitting down on the bed. Do not say a word and they will begin playing with cards and dice. The two dames that lose the game will mournfully leave the room, whereas the winning dame will ask ‘why have you called me?’ (i. 10). You are to answer: ‘Most beautiful and noble being, I have called you to know your name, feast upon your beauty, and enjoy your wisdom’ (i. 10). A marriage proposal in the light of ‘your and my creator’ fol-lows, accompanied by an oath of faithfulness (‘touching no other earthly creature’: i. 11), further ceremonial formulations, and finally drinking the fountain water and eating the bread. The ‘dame’ reveals her name, promises to serve you, make you happy, rich, and ‘big’ (i. 13), but also threatens that you will be the most miserable human being on earth if you break your oath. As a token of the marriage, she gives you a precious piece of jewellery, her ‘virtuous love’ (i. 13), she embraces you, takes you by the hand and accompanies you to bed. You will experience ‘lust and delight’ which you may never have with any mortal being (i. 14).

One is to cut a piece out of the glass of one of the room’s windows, so that the spirit can throw a stone through the hole upon its arrival.

Said procedure is completely based on ‘logical’ and ‘rational’ principles (i. 5: ‘Haec Philosophiae [...] veniit ex principiis logicis ad normam sana rationis’); accordingly, it can be demarcated from ‘magia daemonica’ (i. 6) and other ‘artes superstitiosas’ (i. 7), but instead aligned with ‘magia naturalis’ and ‘Cabbala’. The procedure consists of fabricating two ritual devices—a rectangular mirror and a divining rod (drawings on i. 14, 18)—following metallurgic and astrological rules.

Italian (title), Italian/Latin (content)VII. Manuscript title with reference “118”CM 12 outlines a conjuration procedure for the spirit ‘Barone’ (see also entry No. 44 = CM 96). Its ritual mechanics include a ritual circle (draw-ing on i. 7), fumigations, ritual artefacts (among them a vase and the ‘brain of a cock’: i. 10), and lengthy conjurations which are partly written in Latin. As soon as ‘Barone’ appears, he will fulfil one’s wishes, answer one’s questions, and perform the tasks one commands. Interestingly, if ‘Barone’ is disobedient, one can place him in a ‘carafe’, seal it with ‘virgin wax’ and roast it while uttering another Latin prayer (i. 12–13): then ‘Barone’ will certainly obey! He may be called anytime thereafter ‘per su nome’ (i. 15).No. 119I.

Interestingly, the last recipe against ‘bad fever’ (i. 15–16), which works through uttering a short Latin prayer and writing down the vox magica ‘ABRACADABRA’ in the so-called ‘Schwindeschema’ (‘fading scheme’), goes all the way back to Roman antiquity, first attested in chapter 51 of Quintus Serenus’ Liber Medicinalis (see Önnerfors 1991, 25f., 62).No. 121I.

Once it is baked, one is to engrave a circular drawing onto a piece of wood, taken from the gallows, which includes the words ‘Pane—pizza’ (drawing on i. 5). If one inserts this piece of wood into the pizza and utters ‘Candur, Candur, Candur’, a ‘black man’ (i. 6: ‘huomo nero’) will appear and deliver the coat—but one is to make sure to give him the bread first.No. 124I.

The ritual works through placing a new table with chairs, meals and beverages at a secret location where one expects hidden treasure, e.g. in a mine (‘Bergwerk’: i. 5). Persuaded by means of animal sacrifice, fumigations, conjurations and a shared meal, the ‘princes’ will bring gold and silver, herbal remedies, ‘wild animals’ (i. 7), and answer questions: ‘Summa Summarum: they do what one demands’ (i. 7).No. 130I.

An inspirational source of CM 10 may have been Johan Baptista van Helmont’s (1580–1644) De magnetica vulnerum curatione (first publ. 1610 in Paris) that was translated into German by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth in 1683 (see Dilg/Rudolph 1993, 50).
