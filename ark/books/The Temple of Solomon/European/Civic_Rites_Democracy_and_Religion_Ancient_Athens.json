During the time that Iworked on the manuscript for this book, America faced two ongoing wars,crises in major financial and industrial institutions, and growing awarenessof changes in the earth’s global climate. We also saw the election of thefirst African American president. In the meantime, rapid developments inwhat is called information technology modified how we communicate witheach other on a daily basis, while providing a degree of access to images,videos, music, and publications of all kinds that was unimaginable onlyfifteen years ago. Americans revere progress— new and improved!— andthey approach times of volatility as rare openings for growth. What mightbe experienced as a period of anxiety is framed instead as a desirable oppor-tunity. This capacity to reimagine ourselves and our common future is one ofour better qualities as a people.A society that idolizes progress can also marginalize the study of the past— especially stories from the ancient past of a society on the other sideof the globe. Saying “That’s ancient history” is simply a way of dismissingan event and indicating a determination to move forward. “Ancient his-tory” for many people is history that has lost all relevance and no longer hasany practical connection to the present.

The ancient world itself may be long gone, but our understand-ing of it is constantly changing. Archaeologists uncover new evidence; so-phisticated new technologies help scholars retrieve additional informationfrom fragmentary physical remains; new critical approaches developed byresearchers in the social sciences and humanities encourage scholars of an-tiquity to reevaluate the ancient evidence. Like everything else in the mod-ern world, ancient history does not stand still.It was the people of ancient Athens who fashioned the first democracy,and even coined the word from their Greek words meaning “people” and“power,” but the Athenians do not provide us today with a model of the ex-emplary demo cratic state. Some decisions made by the Athenians were farfrom admirable. Athenian society was highly stratified by class, and theeconomy would not have functioned without slave labor. The lives ofwomen were severely restricted, and they had no role in the po liti cal pro- cess. The po liti cal pro cess itself was flawed, and ambitious men sometimesled the voting public astray. But at the same time Athenian phi los o phers,poets, architects, and artists created works of lasting beauty, proportion,and grace. Their ideas infuse the modern world we inhabit, and their sym-bols steal into our dreams. The intellectual leaders in ancient Athenian so-ciety were members of a rich and sometimes quirky community, and theyall lived and worked during a time of great change.In fifteen years of teaching and leading discussions in college class-rooms, I have been repeatedly reminded that the ancient world is good tothink with. Historians often say that we cannot know where we are goingwithout an awareness of where we have been. I agree, and I would add tothis that a deep and deeply practicalunderstanding of the past enables us tobetter analyze the present, better evaluate possible options for change, andbetter plan for a viable anddesirable future. The ancient Mediterranean wasa complex place inhabited by diverse peoples and nations who tackled prob-lems similar to the ones we face today. Power, ambition, and greed. Main-taining access to the material resources necessary for growing economies.Questions about the nature of justice, and appropriate ethical behavior.The changing place of religion in society. Conflicts with foreign peoplestoo frequently regarded as aggressive barbarians. Internal tensions andheated debates about whether a demo cratic state could, or even should, cre-ate and sustain an empire.Though ancient and modern demo cratic governance are topics that de-serve our reflection, the subject of religion also warrants careful reexamina-tion. Religion has always been a powerful factor in American society. But"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvprefacethe differences between ancient and modern religious practices are great,and we could easily disregard ancient religion, believing the gap between itand our belief systems to be so great that we can get little practical benefitfrom bridging it. Even so, it is a mistake to conclude that the peoples of an-tiquity were generally superstitious peasants who clung to childish myths,while an elite group of educated men rejected all traditional practices as ir-rational and primitive, thanks to their vigorous intellectual curiosity.The outlines of Athenian history are well- known to many, from the Per-sian invasions and the de cades dominated by Pericles to the PeloponnesianWar and Sparta’s defeat of Athens, but the significant impact of religiousculture on Athenian public and po liti cal life during this time is familiarmostly to specialists and scholars. In large part this ignorance is due to thecompletely alien nature of Athenian religion. I have written this book for amore general audience to show how the ancestral rituals of Athens werethoroughly intertwined with its emerging demo cratic institutions. Here Irely on the openness and intellectual curiosity of my readers to follow meinto a descriptive analysis of some traditional Greek religious rites. The fes-tival calendar of the Athenians honored many deities at scores of festivalsduring the year, which they reckoned from summer to summer, startingwith the first new moon after the summer solstice in our month of June. Inthis book I have chosen to analyze only three major divinities, namelyAthena, Demeter, and Dionysus, plus a handful of their civic festivals. I havehad to exclude some important material. But I hope that I have includedenough description and analysis to make the customs of animal sacrificeand public festival a bit more understandable to twenty- first- century readers.Students, friends, and colleagues have helped me think through thisbook since I started seriously working on it in 2003. The idea to or ga nizethe book as I have, interweaving historical chapters with chapters on cul-tural and religious context, came from classes that I taught during the ’90sand ’00s at Wheaton College and Smith College, and I learned a great dealfrom students at those institutions. I wrote the book in part with sabbaticaltravel support from the Alden and Beverly Fiertz Award at Wheaton Col-lege, which funded study at the Fondation Hardt in Geneva and a trip toAthens. Once I started actually writing I benefited from conversations andcorrespondence with many whom I would now like to thank.

A sur-prisingly strong spring sun warms the limestone buildings in the AthenianAgora, the commercial and communal center of the city. High above onthe Acropolis marble monuments and a great bronze statue of the armedgoddess Athena glint in the sunlight. In the city streets brightly colored redand yellow wild flowers spring up amid the grass growing along the edgesof the paving stones, and they barely stir in a faint morning breeze. In a large,walled courtyard in the Agora on this morning, a group of well over 500 menhave gathered. They are a sampling of the citizens of demo cratic Athens,men of all ages chosen by lot to serve on a jury. They stand clustered ingroups as they listen intently to an el der ly man who begins speaking be-fore them in a strong and unfaltering voice. He clearly is no stranger toteaching and persuasive argument. He is a confident and engaging speaker,even if some of his claims do provoke surprise and murmuring in thecourtroom.A small committee of civil magistrates seated on a dais presides over thistrial, and next to them the steady trickle of a klepsydra,or water clock,mea sures time as a thread of water slowly runs from one large terra- cottavessel into another placed on a shelf just below.

He takes his time as he defends himself. In other ways, too, thisman is an oddity to those serving on the jury. While his voice resonateswith unusual strength and clarity, his appearance raises a few eyebrows.He is shortish, and barefoot, and his old, worn cloak hangs awkwardlyaskew over a noticeable paunch. This attire, combined with his bald pateand a curious snub nose, inspires smiles of derision in some of the more el-egantly dressed jury members. Along the back edges of the courtyard behindthe jurors stand a dozen other men and a handful of heavily veiled women,the old man’s family, friends, and supporters. The expressions on theirfaces betray their worst fears, as well as their fierce devotion, their resolutepride, and their love.This somewhat unkempt el der ly man has been accused of religiousimpiety, and he is being tried by a jury of his peers in a state court. Sometoday might wonder about these facts: Did Athens, the city that first gavethe Western world the demo cratic form of government, really permit itscitizens to be tried for religious crimes? Did the leaders of this democracyactually allow religious behavior— and alleged misbehavior— to be consid-ered a legitimate concern of the state? Although our modern notions ofdemocracy endorse the separation of church and state, the historical factsabout ancient Greece point in the opposite direction: Demo cratic Athensdid concern itself with the religious lives of its citizens. Impiety was adeadly serious charge for the members of this demo cratic community. Cit-izens could be exiled or even executed if found guilty of violating the sa-cred laws governing the proper worship of the state’s many gods and god-desses. Death at the hands of the state was in fact the fate of this 70- year- old man who stood trial for impiety in 399 bce. As luck wouldhave it, we even know the name of the man who defended himself on thisday. He was the phi los o pher Socrates.Athens was Socrates’ home, and the great phi los o pher came of age dur-ing the de cades when the visionary leader Pericles was making Athens thecommercial and cultural center of the northeastern Mediterranean basin.Under Pericles Athens experienced unpre ce dented growth, prosperity, andinfluence. Athenians were proud of the radical new form of governmentthey called demokratia,democracy. In their innovative system all male cit-izens had a voice, and not just those from the wealthy, established familiesas in many neighboring cities. Although he came from an aristocratic fam-ily Pericles enthusiastically supported the democracy, and he gave new po- liti cal privileges to the laborers and working men of Athens whose abilityto participate in government had long been restricted. Pericles also guidedintroduction2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Athens into a position of international prestige, advocating the develop-ment of an Athenian naval empire that for de cades ruled the Aegean Sea,the eastern Mediterranean, and the shipping lanes into the Black Sea. Somecities allied with Athens experimented with implementing more demo -cratic forms of rule, and other cities suffered the imposition of democracyforced upon them by the Athenians.Athens was a city that Socrates deeply loved, and he lived within thecity’s walls nearly every day of his life. The only time he was away was dur-ing those few months as a mature man when he took part in military cam-paigns in the mountainous country north of Athens. Even during thosetimes when he was not living in his beloved Athens, he was still fighting asan infantryman alongside his fellow Athenian citizens. As much as Socratesloved his home city, he had even more regard for the men who madeAthens the extraordinary place it was during the second half of the fifthcentury before the common era. During this period dominated by Pericles’leadership, Athenians completed the great building projects on the Acrop-olis, and they celebrated the careers of renowned playwrights such as Sopho-cles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. Innovative natural scientists and cleverphi los o phers from throughout the known world came to teach Athenians,who could not get enough of the new ideas. Socrates earned his living as astonemason and may well have worked on Pericles’ building projects; he nodoubt attended the theater and conversed with the visiting scientists andphi los o phers. Socrates thrived in the heart of Pericles’ Athens. He was thesort of man who spoke the truth as he saw it, and his criticisms of the Athe-nians could at times be withering.But the so- called golden age of Athens ended almost as suddenly as itbegan. At the time of Socrates’ trial in 399, Athens was just emerging fromthe greatest period of po liti cal and social tumult that it had ever experi-enced. The Athenians had only recently finished fighting a war that haddragged on for nearly three full de cades. Sparta, Athens’ chief rival, wasvictorious in the end. Barely five years before the trial of Socrates, theSpartan army had occupied Athens and torn down the defensive fortifica-tions that surrounded the city. Meanwhile, the Spartan navy reduced theAthenian fleet and made the Athenians promise that they would neveragain rebuild their navy. After fifty years of commercial, financial, andmilitary leadership in Greece, the mighty Athenian naval empire was fi-nally at an end.While the Spartans achieved victory, the citizens of Athens were experienc-ing further troubles.

The de cade between 413 and 403 had seen repeated coups d’état asthe government careened wildly between an unsteady demo cratic rule ofthe people and an oppressive oligarchy headed by old, wealthy families. Amoderate oligarchy of 5,000 ruled for a short while. A noble general andpop u lar leader of the people arose in this time of crisis and won over thepeople, only to betray the Athenians to their enemies not once but twice:first to the Spartans, and later to the Persians. Twice democracy itself wasabolished in Athens, and one of these times it was the Athenians themselveswho voted to change the government. Each time that the short- lived, repres-sive regimes seized power, hit men assassinated prominent, as well as not- so- prominent, demo cratic leaders. But each time, by some miracle— includingthe remarkable intervention of Sparta in 403— the Athenian people bouncedback and regained control of the government.It was a wonder that anyone survived those years of chaos and terror.Hard feelings lingered even after the democracy was restored a secondtime in 404/3, and a general amnesty was declared in the wake of trials forthe most hated and violent leaders of the oligarchic coups. In light of theseevents, it is not wholly surprising to see Socrates on trial in Athens just fiveyears after the final restoration of democracy. Socrates was a recognizable,if eccentric, public figure in his own right, known for frequenting the pub-lic square in the city, where he questioned fellow citizens on their opinionsand assumptions concerning justice and the proper, ethical behavior ofcitizens. It was common knowledge that Socrates had ties to some of theoligarchs who led the repeated and briefly successful attempts to under-mine the demo cratic government. Some believed that Socrates had anti- democratic, aristocratic sympathies, even though he was himself only apoor stonemason who could barely support his own family. And Socrateswas widely known to be an intimate friend of that man who had twice be-trayed the Athenians to their foreign enemies during war time.The suggestion that Socrates’ trial and execution were almost entirely po- liti cally motivated is an attractive one. This idea has been put forward andpursued in recent years, most notably by I. F. Stone in his pop u lar 1988book The Trial of Socrates.But while there may be some truth to this thesis,it is at best only partially true. Looking to purely po liti cal motivations forthe death of Socrates overlooks an essential fact about Athenian society: re-ligious observance played a central role in the world’s first democracy.While some, including Stone, have come to view the “religious” nature ofthe impiety charges against Socrates as a mask for the more po liti cal mo-introduction4"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"tives of his accusers and their cronies, other scholars have continued to ex-plore the full range of life in ancient Athens, including the diversity of reli-gious behaviors and expressions. These scholars have pointed out that todaywe have a duty to take the Athenians’ religious customs quite seriously.Doing so requires that we try to reimagine and reconstruct the varieties ofhuman experience from an ancient Greek perspective and not from ourown modern one. We need to reexamine our own categories of thought,and not heedlessly apply our categories to their world— especially if ourcategories do not comfortably fit in that world.Religion is one of those concepts that cannot be easily transferred frommodern to ancient societies. When we fail to acknowledge the full impactof religion on the civic institutions of ancient Athens, we blind ourselves tothe full complexity of the world that Athenians themselves inhabited. TheGreek po liti cal world was one that was governed by civic rites. The demo -cratic government in Athens, like the regimes in every other Greek city atthat time, relied on countless religious practices in every aspect of its dailyfunctioning. Citizens stood not only in po liti cal and social relationship toeach other but also in religious and cultic relationship to each other, to theirchildren and ancestors, and to the city’s gods. It was the duty of Atheniancitizens to take part in the common civic and religious life of the city and toexpress disagreement and dissent when they saw or heard things that didnot conform to accepted practice. This book will explore some of the reli-gious aspects of demo cratic institutions in ancient Athens, and examinehow the exercise of traditional practices had a substantial impact on Athe-nian po liti cal and social history in the fifth century.The deepest roots of Athenian democracy that scholars can identify to-day lie in a distant past that was common to all Greeks. Athens was just oneof many city- states that flourished in antiquity in the northeastern cornerof the Mediterranean Sea. As is still true today, Greece was known thenamong its inhabitants as “Hellas,” and Greek culture in general was called“Hellenic.” Panhellenic shrines and customs were those that were shared byall the in de pen dent Greek city- states: the festival of Zeus called the OlympicGames was panhellenic, as was the sanctuary at Delphi, an oracular shrinesacred to the god Apollo. Another significant component of panhellenicculture in Greek antiquity was the epic poetry of Homer, and the sharedmythological traditions surrounding the city of Troy and the warriors whofought there in a distant and heroic past. Though Homer’s Iliadand Odysseycelebrate the sometimes conflicting heroic values of physical strength andmental cunning, the preeminence of honor, or time,and manly virtue, orthe city of pericles and socrates5"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"arete,is common to both poems. Both poems also embody the heroic pur-suit of undying fame: kleos.The ancient panhellenic warrior values of fame, time,and aretefeaturedin Homer’s epics remained influential many generations later in the demo -cratic Athens of Pericles and Socrates. Socrates and Pericles both knew themyths and oral traditions of Homer and the epic past, but they had only adim idea of why that warrior society faded. Scholars today know that thedestruction of the Bronze Age citadel at Troy in the thirteenth century bcemarked the end of a flourishing civilization in the eastern Mediterranean.The Trojan prince Hector and the Greek lords Agamemnon, Odysseus, andAchilles may never have existed as genuine historical personalities, but sim-ilar warriors lived during what archaeologists now call the Mycenaean pe-riod. The fall of the Mycenaean palace cultures was accompanied by wavesof immigration throughout the Mediterranean and an economic lull thatlasted for several generations. During this time there was decreased trade inthe Aegean Sea, no significant Greek cities to speak of, and relative povertythroughout Hellas. But the region recovered, and the Geometric (ninth–seventh centuries) and Archaic (sixth and early fifth centuries) periodsbrought po liti cal stability to Hellas, along with increased trade and culturalcontacts with other more developed cultures in the eastern portion of theMediterranean basin, such as Egypt and Phoenicia.The po liti cal stability and economic growth during the Geometric andArchaic periods also fostered the rise of the in de pen dent Greek city- state,or polis.There were hundreds of these city- states (poleis) throughout the Greek- speaking world, and each one maintained its own legal, po liti cal,and religious customs. The vibrant Archaic period drew to a close with theinvasions of Persian armies in 481 and 480. Some Greek poleisformed analliance, and their victory over Persian forces in 479 marks the start ofwhat scholars call the Classical period. In Athens that victory containedthe seeds of a new empire that would last several generations. Later empires— the Hellenistic empires of Alexander the Great and his succes-sors and the Roman Empire following them— severely restricted the insti-tution of the polis.But these subsequent empires would never forget whatwas accomplished in the Athens of Pericles and Socrates.We still live with and nurture public institutions that started in Greece,thanks in large part to the Romans, who preserved what they valued inGreek culture by wedding it to their own par tic u lar strengths in govern-ment, law, and engineering. After a long hiatus the Re nais sance and En-lightenment brought back democracy, theater, athletic competition, andintroduction6"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"a certain classical sensibility recognizable in the art and architecture of Eu- rope and the Americas. So much of ancient Greece has survived and beenwoven back into Western culture over the centuries that today we may feelwe already know these ancient people and the world they inhabited. But weneed to be cautious. What appears so familiar may actually be more foreignthan we first realize.Anyone who learns a foreign language can tell you that words in one’snative tongue are not necessarily congruent with the words in another.Words within each language have subtle gradations of meaning, and con-cepts in one language awkwardly overlap with “equivalent” notions in theother. At the same time, linguistic connections and associations in one cul-ture are often wholly absent from the other. The same holds true for reli-gious concepts. Like spoken languages, cultures also comprise lived frame-works of their own, and they can be analyzed as symbolic systems withtheir own order and or ga ni za tion that work to create meaning within theirown context. These lived symbolic and religious systems are in some waysrelated to spoken languages; and as we do with foreign languages, we canmake an effort to learn the symbolic language of religion and ritual in other cultures— even those in the distant past.Yet the religious systems of antiquity, including polytheism, may bemore challenging to understand than a foreign language. It is a strangeand difficult thing to comprehend or even discuss polytheistic religion in amodern, post- Enlightenment world. Christianity has been the dominanttradition in Eu rope and the West for many centuries, and Christianity de-fines religious thought and behavior with an emphasis on the centrality ofbelief. Ancient Greek religion had little to do with belief, and a great dealto do with practice and observance of common ancestral customs. Jewish,Christian, and Islamic notions of religiosity and belief are also rooted inlarge part in holy books and sacred narratives. Observant Jews and Chris-tians believe the accounts recorded in their scriptures, to greater or lesserextents; some believe the scriptures themselves to have been divinely cre-ated, or at least divinely inspired. An association that ties religion to beliefin traditional narratives still persists in the work of some modern secularhistorians of Greece and Rome. This book does not share the assumptionthat Greeks viewed religion through the lens of belief in the ways thatJews, Christians, and Muslims do today. Such an assumption about the cen-tral place of sacred narratives continues to support a common misconcep-tion that Greek and Roman religiosity were both based on explicit beliefin the manifold myths of the gods.the city of pericles and socrates7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"This book will mention famous myths only incidentally, and will ratherbe concerned with what modern students of religion and anthropologyterm cult practices. The meaning of “cult” here is closely linked to the Latincultus,from the verb colomeaning “tend, cultivate; take care of; nourish.”Cult practices in this sense do not describe the secret rituals of disreputablereligious communities that brainwash well- intentioned but weak and sug-gestible devotees. Rather, cult practices were traditional customs that en-abled the Greeks (and Romans) to tend to the gods— or better, to nourishsocial and po liti cal relationships in the present by maintaining long- standing relationships with ancestors and ancestral gods. The place of cultpractices in antiquity was quite unlike the role of religion in the modernworld. Indeed, the governments of all Greek poleis were responsible formaintaining certain religious customs; current scholarship calls this modeof public worship “civic religion” or “civic cult.” Demo cratic Athens wasfamous even among other neighboring ancient Greek poleisfor the expenseof its civic cult. The bloody ritual killing of animal victims at the city’s al-tars, called thysia(described in detail in chapter 2), occupied a central posi-tion in Athenian civic religion.The chapters that follow look to the beginning of Western democracy,and they explore the thoroughly intertwined relationship of politics andreligion in ancient Athens. The structure of the book mirrors this inter-twining; odd- numbered chapters provide historical narrative and analysis,while even- numbered chapters pause the flow of time to examine certainreligious festivals and customs that shed light on significant historicalevents. Chapters 1 and 2 reveal the religious roots of Athenian democracyand the cultic aspects of its po liti cal institutions. After providing a histori-cal narrative for the origins of democracy, including the military and cul-tural conflicts surrounding the Persian Wars, chapters 3 and 5 describe thepush toward imperialism that resulted in a long and destructive war thatvery nearly put an end to all earlier demo cratic impulses. Since the grow-ing pains of Athenian democracy were not evident just in the po liti cal andmilitary history of the fifth century, chapters 4 and 6 explore Athenian re-ligious institutions that were rooted in the surrounding landscape and thatencouraged criticism of ruling structures and powerful individuals. Athe-nians participated in their city’s customs of theater and in the “mysteries”;both of these religious traditions allowed for po liti cal dissent and gave avoice to those who had no recognized po liti cal role in the citizen body.

Each chapter narrates material centeredon a historical personality or a deity. Students and general readers can un-cover the city of Athens, its history and culture, and by the end they willhave before them a portrait of an ancient city that was complex, powerful,at times self- contradictory, and beguiling. More advanced students andscholars can skim the material they know well, and trace the larger argu-ment that ties together two distinct subfields in classical studies that havenormally been kept apart— namely, po liti cal history and religion. For thesereaders chapters 2, 4, 6, and 7 may be the most engaging. I have suppliedreferences to the most important primary sources in the text and appendix,and readers looking for extensive quotations and close analysis of the ancienttexts may consult the suggested readings.Studying ancient Greece is at best an exercise in creative reconstructionand the articulation of persuasive argument, tempered with strict attentionto the details of available evidence. The remaining extant sources are neveras plentiful as scholars wish they were, and often they are simply fragmen-tary and incomplete. Sources for fifth- and fourth- century Athens are moreplentiful than for any other city from this period. Thankfully, some Greekliterary sources have survived to modern times in a reasonably whole state.We can study these works much as they existed in the Athens of Socratesand Pericles, a city where the traditional epic poetry of Homer was heardalongside the dramatic works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristo-phanes. The histories of Herodotus and Thucydides emerged from thesame Athenian community that produced the philosophic dialogues ofPlato. Taken as a whole, the literary output of fifth- and early fourth- centuryAthens is second to none. In addition, later authors such as Plutarch andPausanias writing during the Roman period in the second century cehadstrong antiquarian interests, and they preserved many details of Greek his-tory and culture that otherwise would have been lost.Those scholars who study the societies and cultures of the ancientMediterranean world can supplement literary evidence with physical re-mains: all the major artwork and archaeological materials from areas thathave been excavated.

Modern academic disciplines can alsohelp an ancient historian interpret the remaining evidence. Various formsof literary and critical theory can open up ancient texts to deeper under-standing, and insights from the social sciences (po liti cal science, sociology,anthropology, religious studies, and women’s studies) can play a part in il-luminating the social dynamics at work in an ancient city.Spelling and transliteration of Athenian proper names and Greek termscan be confusing, because some names bear the marks of having been Lat-inized before entering into En glish (e.g., the Latinized Pericles vs. the di-rect transliteration Perikles). Wherever possible I have used the spellingsof proper names and Greek terms found in the third edition of the OxfordClassical Dictionary,the standard En glish reference book for all thingshaving to do with ancient Greece and Rome.

Since the Athenian year started at mid-summer, some dates provided have slashes: for example, the year 480/79denotes that year that began in the summer of 480 bceand ended twelvemonths later in 479. A glossary of transliterated Greek terms and techni-cal En glish words that appear throughout the text with some frequency isprovided in an appendix.Specialized and rather esoteric debates among classical scholars and an-cient historians are still simmering about nearly every topic covered in thisstudy. I have therefore included a bibliographic appendix that lists themost important ancient sources, along with discussions keyed to eachchapter that provide current bibliography on both sides of debates.

The breakthrough to what we would rec-ognize today as a demo cratic form of government had come around theyear 507, when an Athenian aristocrat named Cleisthenes suddenly emergedas a leader and guided the Athenians through a series of reforms. But Cleis-thenes was not the first demo cratic reformer; he was building upon foun-dations laid by generations of Greeks before him.As is the case with most figures in Greek history, especially Greek his-tory before the wars with Persia in the first half of the fifth century, wecan know very little about Cleisthenes as an individual, just as we knowlittle about how he persuaded the Athenians to implement the changes heproposed. The limited knowledge we do have about Cleisthenes stems fromwhat is probably best considered an oral tradition of Athenian history thatencompasses both fact and fiction.

Cleisthenes and his family— the Alcmaeonidae— lived under a shadow of suspicion because of an act ofimpiety committed by a distant ancestor. The tradition related how, at apivotal moment in the history of Athens, two opposing po liti cal groupscame face to face at a shrine sacred to the city’s gods. In the ensuing clash,members of one faction killed some men who had taken refuge at a publicaltar. The egregious act of impiety had serious po liti cal repercussions, andit resulted in what came to be known as the “curse of the Alcmaeonidae”(Herodotus 5.70–72; Thucydides 1.126).The details of this episode as reported by Herodotus and Thucydidesmay not be entirely trustworthy, and we will never know for certain whatexactly happened in the middle of the seventh century, the traditional datefor when the curse was initially called down. But the larger story behind thiscurse and the way the curse reportedly came about does reveal a good dealabout the world the Greeks inhabited, and their assumptions about thisworld. An analysis of these assumptions can then uncover the very humanhopes and fears of the Athenians who over time fashioned what later gen-erations would come to know as democracy. This chapter provides a firstglimpse into that ancient world.the lay of the landThe Athens that we are familiar with today is the sprawling, sunny Mediter-ranean metropolis near the Aegean. It spreads itself out below the remainsof temples perched high atop the Acropolis. The city recently remade itselfinto a cosmopolitan international destination as it prepared for the twenty- eighth modern Olympic games in 2004. But this modern urban center hasa continuous history of human settlement that stretches back without breakfor at least 3,500 years, as construction projects for the new undergroundsubway revealed. The period that brought democracy to the world occurredmore than 2,500 years ago, in the fifth century. The emergence of democ-racy in Athens was not an inevitable outcome but rather the result of count-less decisions made over many generations— the responses of real people toreal and pressing situations. The all- too- human impulses of fear and some-times greed motivated them to make the decisions they did, as did the wishto enjoy life in the present while ensuring that their families and descendantswould thrive in generations yet to come.But in the changeable environment of the ancient Mediterranean itwas not easy to establish a stable government. A traveler to Athens andfamily curse behind athenian democracy13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"its neighbors in the fifth century would have seen a landscape dominatedby mountains, islands, and the sea, looking much as it does today. Iso-lated harbors and valleys sheltered small villages and encouraged the de-velopment of localized dialects and customs. Mountains made regulartravel over land difficult, or at least inefficient and time- consuming, whilethe jagged coastline of islands, gulfs, and harbors offered safe anchoragefor ships that regularly sailed the surrounding waters. The Athenians,like many other Greek- speaking peoples, relied on the sea for their liveli-hood. As much as the po liti cal and social circumstances changed duringthe course of the fifth century, the connection to the sea remained essen-tial for Athenians.Patterns of settlement and land use on the mainland and the islands ofGreece were dictated by the landscape and its relationship to climate.Mainland Greece and the islands received little rainfall, and Attica, thename for the countryside surrounding the city of Athens, was among thedriest areas, with as little annual rain as falls in some of the drier regions ofthe U.S. desert Southwest. The prevailing Mediterranean wind came in fromthe west, and Attica, being on the east side of a mountain range, receivedeven less rainfall than some of its immediate neighbors. The arable land inthe plains of Attica stretched between the mountains and the sea, and it washighly valued for the cultivation of grains— primarily barley, but wheatand rye were also grown. Wheat was the preferred cereal because it was afiner grain when milled, but barley was the preferred crop because it wasmore drought tolerant. When the rains did arrive, they came in Novemberor December and fell until early March. During these wet winter monthsfarmers planted and cultivated the grain crops, and sailors stayed off thestormy seas. During the long, windy, and dry summers the sailors, traders,and itinerant craftsmen turned to their ships, while farmers tended theirprincipal warm weather crops: figs, olives, and grapes.Because the availability of good, arable land was so limited, the plains were not used for pasture. Consequently, there were precious few herds ofcattle, an important fact with implications for both diet and religious lifethat will be discussed in more detail in chapter 2. Only the richest aristo-crats kept and bred horses. Sheep and goats were much more common,and these herds were pastured above the plains in the uplands, and evenfurther up in the mountains during the warm summer months. Herd ani-mals were bred and maintained primarily for the goods they produced year- round—wool and milk— and only secondarily for their meat. Thedemands of animal sacrifice were stipulated in the traditional civic calen-cleisthenes14"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"dar of religious festivals, and they were based on the implicit recognitionthat resources were scarce.The deities in the polytheistic system of the ancient Greeks ranged fromthe most powerful and widely recognized gods to lesser known, local spir-its. The gods and goddesses of ancient Greece mirrored both the naturalenvironment that the people relied on to make their living and the socialworld that governed the daily lives of real men and women. Some weregods whose power over the natural world lay in those agricultural resourcesthat the Greek diet so heavily depended on— for example, Demeter, thegoddess of cereal crops; Athena, who oversaw the cultivation of the olive;and Dionysus, the god of the vine and the production of wine. There werealso lesser deities like Pan, who oversaw the work of shepherds, and the in-numerable nymphs who imbued the springs that streamed from the hillsand snowy mountaintops.While the gods that the Greeks worshipped can reveal to us the re-sources that they valued, at the same time we can today discern a gooddeal about human social relations in ancient Greece by analyzing the inter-actions among these gods. A whole panoply of deities was arranged into anelaborate and interconnected family headed by the supreme patriarch Zeus,“father of gods and men” as he was called by the traditional poets Homerand Hesiod. Zeus the divine patriarch had authority over all the immortals(with the notable exception of three ancient goddesses called the Fates)and over all the earthly mortals. Zeus ruled the other deities not becausehe was the oldest, or the wisest, and not because he had a special connec-tion to the land and the natural environment of Greece. Zeus ruled becausehe had successfully wrenched power from his father, Cronus. Cronus hadonce done the very same thing when he became ruler over his father, Uranus.This mythic pattern of an intergenerational power struggle between maledeities and their fathers occurs in neighboring eastern Mediterranean cul-tures; contemporary scholars call it the Succession Myth. As heir to theSuccession Myth, which required the son to dethrone his father (often withthe duplicitous assistance of his mother), Zeus modeled a pattern of behav-ior that was unconsciously and consciously imitated by generations of Greekmen. Certainly mortals did not kill their fathers (or even wish to), but inthe natural order of things the son grows up and takes the father’s place inthe world and thus symbolically defeats him.This mythic social order that Zeus modeled placed power in the handsof a few who needed the obedience and labor of many others to maintainthe status quo and keep the world from returning to a primeval state offamily curse behind athenian democracy15"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"chaos. Viewed within the economies of archaic and classical Athens, thepattern manifested itself in the small fraction of men— those of a heredi-tary, aristocratic class— who governed everybody else. The category “every-body else” embraced many different subcategories, including less well- to- do ordinary citizens, some of whom were small landholders and in de pen dentfarmers, while others worked as sharecroppers in a semifeudal system, cul-tivating land belonging to a wealthier class. The most unfortunate becamedebt bondsmen, who lost their liberty and citizen privileges until theycould repay their debt. “Everybody else” also meant noncitizen but freeresident aliens called metics, many of whom were specialized and profes-sional craftsmen who worked in Athens or its port. Finally, all the slaves,regardless of where they labored, all the women, and all children countedas “everybody else,” too. There were far more people in this category of“everybody else” than there were actual citizens. At best only 25 percent ofthe total population of classical Athens were citizens with full po liti calprivileges.Because running farms was labor- intensive, many people lived in thecountryside villages of Attica; but by the end of the sixth century, Athenswas a small urban center that existed in a mutually dependent and benefi-cial relationship with the outlying rural districts, called demes. Athens wasthe recognized name for the larger autonomous civic entity called the polis(city- state), and it was a large town that contained the seat of centralizedgovernment for that polis.The surrounding countryside of Attica encom-passed hills and mountains as well as the broad plains with their scattereddistricts, villages, and towns extending from the Aegean Sea in the southand east to the mountains in the north and west. When scholars speak ofAthenian democracy, Athenian citizens, or the Athenian empire, they arereferring both to the urban center of Athens and to the rural districts ofAttica. Neither could exist without the other.Athens as a city looked like many other cities in archaic and classicalGreece. It lay in a broad plain between two ranges of hills. The plain wasno more than 10 miles wide, and in the middle of the plain stood a smallcluster of hills. An outcropping of bedrock, the Acropolis, towered abovethe hills and the plain (figure 1). An acropolis, literally the “peak of thecity,” had the obvious advantage of being an easily defensible height anda natural fortress; acropolises were sites of palace complexes as far back asMycenaean times, before the thirteenth century. Other major urban cen-ters in Greece had this same topographical feature— cities such as Corinthto the south of Athens, and Thebes to the north.

These walls would play an important rolein the course of the Peloponnesian War later in the fifth century.The overall picture, then, might well resemble a walled city in medievalEu rope. Classical Athens was a well- fortified but small (by our standards)urban center with temples, markets, and the seat of the demo cratic insti-tutions alongside urban neighborhoods with their homes, businesses, andworkshops. Further suburban neighborhoods and businesses developedoutside the fortifications. Cemeteries and other sacred precincts were alsotraditionally found outside the city walls.

This relationship between onecity and the surrounding countryside created a type of centripetal energythat moved toward Athens. Such an arrangement was unusual amongGreek cities, which more often or ga nized themselves along an axis withtwo or more public centers— one center for cultic activity and another forcommercial and po liti cal activity.resources, colonies, and cultural contactsFor all the natural advantages enjoyed by Athens, life in the archaic andclassical city still entailed hard work. More often than not the majority ofresidents were familiar with poverty, privation, and the ever- present threatof hunger. Starting with Hesiod’s seventh- century poem Works and Days,Greek literature explored the themes of man’s never- ceasing labor and thesuffering that accompanies human existence. Alongside the toil Hesiodalso presented traditional tales of the Olympian gods and goddesses, andthe very different sort of existence that they led. Hesiod remained a fa-vorite poet of the Athenians throughout the fifth century; along withHomer, Hesiod was often quoted by Socrates.But the Greeks were well aware that human life need not always be sotough. While the farmers throughout Attica maintained their rough, tradi-tional way of life for many generations, by the late sixth century the com-mercial center of Athens had developed a thriving import and exporteconomy, and a merchant class became acquainted with new prosperity.Athens’ chief export products were wine, the finest olive oil, and exquis-itely rendered ceramic ware, the famous black- figure and red- figure vasesthat were so prized during antiquity throughout the Mediterranean basin.Athens was also fully exploiting natural resources from its silver mines atLaurium, in the southern hills in the direction of Cape Sounion. Withthis silver the polisminted hard currency (a relatively recent innovation)and used that money in foreign trade.Even with all the wealth generated by these various resources, famineremained a continual threat. Although the plains of Attica were fertileenough when the rains fell, some years brought drought, and there simplywas not enough consistently arable acreage to feed a burgeoning popula-tion. The Athenians were faced with constant pressure to import grain, andto export residents to colonies around the Mediterranean basin. The needto colonize and expand had been a factor in the larger Greek world since atleast the tenth century. At that time Greeks began to settle other landscleisthenes18"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"around the Mediterranean, founding cities such as Corcyra (modernCorfu), Cyrene on the North Africa coast (today’s Libya), Syracuse inSicily, and Naples in Italy. Even a city as far west as Marseilles on the coastof France started out as a Greek colony. To the east, Greek settlementsspanned the entire coast of Asia Minor (now Turkey) around to Byzan-tium (Istanbul), famously situated along the trade route to the Black Sea.Athens was not prominent among the colonizers of the Archaic period;Corinth and the Euboean cities of Chalcis and Eretria took that honor.But colonization of a new sort would become an Athenian focus later inthe fifth century.When centuries of colonization did not fully alleviate the pressure of thegrowing population of Attica, the Athenians started importing considerableamounts of grain. The importation of this staple had unforeseen economicand social repercussions. The continual need to import grain kept pressureon the silver mines at Laurium, which made possible the hard currency thatcould be used to purchase foreign cereals. Mining at Laurium in turn main-tained the demand for expendable slave labor— the mines at Laurium werenotorious for their cruel conditions. The institution of slavery itself dependedon vigorous foreign trade, and slave dealers exploited foreigners from over-seas markets. But the need to import so much grain had important implica-tions for Athenian foreign policy as well. Some grain came from Greekcolonies in Sicily and southern Italy, which were considerably less arid thanmainland Greece and far more fertile. But most imported grain came fromwhat the Greeks considered the breadbasket of their world: the expansiveand fertile plains north of the Black Sea in the area that today constitutesUkraine. Grain was shipped from Black Sea ports, through the straits ofthe Bosporus and the Hellespont, and then across the Aegean Sea. The con-stant need to import grain encouraged the growth of an energetic maritimeindustry, and it also meant that Athens felt a compelling interest to preserveopen trade routes.Wherever the Greeks went as colonists and traders, they carried withthem their institutions and their distinct culture. This meant first of all theGreek language and the oral traditions that stretched back generations intothe heroic past of the Homeric warriors who had fought at Troy. Hand inhand with this mythology went the ancestral customs of religion and cultpractice, the regular and obligatory rituals through which Greeks main-tained contact with their ancestral gods. Finally, tightly interwoven withreligious customs were the po liti cal and legal structures. In fact, the sameword, nomos,designates religious custom as well as civil law. Although thesefamily curse behind athenian democracy19"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"two concepts are considered quite different in today’s Western democracies,throughout ancient Greece the customs, or nomoi,of civic governance andritual observance reinforced each other. This complete interdependence ofreligious and po liti cal institutions is perhaps for us today the most strangeand unexpected feature of demo cratic Athens. Accustomed as we are to a post- Enlightenment form of democracy with its separation of church andstate, we take for granted that the daily functions of government stand wellapart from the priestly functions of ritual and prayer. Yet for any Greekpolis,from the most traditional monarchy to the most radical democracy,such a separation was simply inconceivable. This interdependence was asstrong in the later centuries of Mediterranean antiquity as in the earliest,and many famous episodes in Greek history bear witness to it.Polisis a Greek word most often translated as “city- state.” Polisis theancestor of such En glish words as “politics,” “po liti cal,” and “politician.”A poliswas, quite simply, an in de pen dent and autonomous body of citi-zens, or politeis.Some poleis(plural) were ruled by hereditary kings ortyrants, some were oligarchies ruled by an ancestral aristocracy, and by theearly fifth century a very few were self- ruling democracies. In the fifthcentury there were literally hundreds of poleisin the Greek world. Most were small municipalities, indeed more like large market towns than nation- states. Athens was exceptional for its large size: 930 square miles,nearly the size of the state of Rhode Island (1,045 square miles). Athens’principal rival, Sparta, was likewise an unusually large polisin terms ofland area, though nowhere near as large as Athens in its combined citizen/resident population.The po liti cal boundaries of Athens developed in slow stages from theeighth to the sixth centuries. Like much of Hellas after the fall of the Myce-naean palace culture in the twelfth century, Attica before the eighth cen-tury was a collection of insignificant and impoverished villages that werebeginning to come together and establish a distinct identity. The continualscarcity of resources over the generations created a polarized society thatwas composed of a small class of elite nobles and a much larger class of less well- to- do citizens who competed with the aristocracy for po liti cal power.The aristocracy drew its strength from lands in the outlying rural districtsin Attica while ruling from the chief urban center of Athens. Border dis-putes with neighboring poleis were common.Establishing and maintaining conspicuous religious sites throughout At-tica became a way for Athenians to mark the frontiers of the polis.Ruralvillages often contained sanctuaries— land, altars, temples, and sometimescleisthenes20"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"entire building complexes set aside for the traditional worship of the gods.Long before Athenian power in the Mediterranean reached its peak in thefifth century, Athens took control of sanctuaries near other poleisin therural countryside of Attica. Examples of significant border sanctuaries inAttica include the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron on the eastern coast,the sanctuaries of Athena and Poseidon at Cape Sounion on the southerntip of the Attica peninsula, the sanctuary of Demeter at Eleusis on thewestern border with Megara, and the much- contested sanctuary of Am-phiaraus on the northern border between Attica and Boeotia. Chapter 4will examine one of these sites, the sanctuary of Demeter at Eleusis, infuller detail, and chapter 6 will describe the complex interaction of reli-gion and politics surrounding a religious tradition that was associated witha “foreign” god, Dionysus, who reportedly entered Athens from the bor-derlands to the north and east.In earlier times these sites on the frontiers of Attica had housed localcults that were po liti cally in de pen dent of Athens; but as Athenian terri-tory grew and its borders became better defined, both po liti cal and reli-gious power became centralized in Athens. While rites continued to be cel-ebrated at border sanctuaries as they had always been, the official homesof these cults were transferred to new civic sanctuaries constructed in thecivic center of Athens. One conspicuous example is the city’s Eleusinion,an urban sanctuary sacred to the goddess Demeter, whose main cult sitewas located on the western border of Attica in the town of Eleusis. The re-or ga ni za tion of these border sanctuaries during the Archaic period enabledpo liti cal and religious authority to radiate out from the center to the mar-gins of the polis.The polis’s po liti cal boundaries were sharpened and de-fined by Athens’ official religious and po liti cal connections to ancient ruralcults.the reforms of solon and their po liti cal aftermathAlthough the po liti cal boundaries of Athens probably had stabilized byaround 700, Athenian democracy did not emerge whole and fully formed;Athenian democracy was not the inevitable outcome of what scholars callthe synoecism of Attica, or the union of its separate communities to forma single, larger sovereign community.

In someways the stress of these slow changes left indelible marks that even themost radical expressions of democracy could not erase. The most visible ofthese marks points to the gap between the various economic classes ofAthenians. The distinctions between the elite aristocrats and the commonpeople were preserved in the rituals, offices, and hierarchies of the polis.For the generations leading up to the Classical period, the main distinc-tions recognized among the male inhabitants of Attica highlighted thelinks between civic, military, and economic status. A typical citizen in thepolisof archaic Athens was an adult freeborn male who owned land in At-tica and was not a debt bondsman working on someone else’s land. Someof these citizens were quite successful, while others might live more pre-cariously, subject to changeable weather and the unpredictable success ofcrops, but they at least maintained enough wealth to own the weapons andarmor of a warrior. Their limited resources enabled them to serve as ho-plites, or armed infantrymen. A small number of poor citizens owned noland at all and could not afford even the most basic armor; these men,called thetes,worked purely as hired laborers and their civic roles in thepolis were the most restricted. There were also citizens with considerablymore wealth. A small number of elite families owned enough land to raise horses, and these nobles served in the citizen army as “horse men,” hippeis,or knights. This three- tiered citizen body made up the foundation of mostpoleisin archaic Greece, not just Athens.Where Athens began to diverge from the other Greek poleisin the Ar-chaic period was in its slow development of governing procedures thatgradually gave po liti cal power, kratos,to the common citizens, called thedemos,in En glish “the people.” Combining these two words producesdemokratia,hence our word “democracy”— the “power of the people.” Thefirst round of significant pre- democratic changes came during the rule ofSolon early in the sixth century. Solon was a traditional aristocrat, but dur-ing his year of elected rule as archon or chief executive magistrate (tradi-tionally dated to 594/3) he initiated the passage of a series of laws that hada profound and lasting impact on Athenian society. While many details ofthe changes remain lost to us today, we know their broad outlines: theSolonian laws encompassed fundamental changes to the life of all inhabi-tants of Attica, changes that affected areas ranging from religious rites tohom i cide laws to a new definition of citizen status. Recognizing the corro-sive effects that debt had wrought on the common citizens— particularlysince debt was so easily incurred by farmers trying to cultivate crops in thecleisthenes22"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"unpredictable climate of Attica— Solon banned debt slavery and freed anyexisting debt slaves. Solon then banned all agricultural exports, with thenotable exception of olive oil, thereby encouraging better use of the avail-able arable land.Religious reforms were central to the Solonian reform program. Solonpushed through sumptuary legislation that limited the extravagance of fu-nerals, which had become elaborate public events designed to display powerand were potentially disruptive, especially when a member of the aristoc-racy was buried and the streets were full of grieving crowds and wailingwomen. Solon then revised and published a new, standardized civic calen-dar of religious festivals for the residents of Attica, and he redefined thedistribution of ritual privileges among the economic classes. Again, the in-clusion of this sort of religious reform runs counter to our notion of therole of government in public life, and we are reminded that nomosin Athensencompassed both of the modern categories “church” and “state.” Publiclife in the Greek polisdemanded citizen participation in ritual, and eligibil-ity for religious offices was the first step to power and po liti cal authority inthe polis.Solon brought about great social and po liti cal change when hereformed laws relating to worship of the gods.By far, the most influential changes Solon instituted involved the cre-ation of four citizen property classes that defined four distinct, graduateddegrees of po liti cal and ritual rights. The wealthiest aristocrats still had thesole access to the most powerful civic offices, but now the mass of non- aristocratic people, newly freed from the threat of slavery and debt bondage,had a limited voice in the Assembly, the ekklesia.Balanced against this As-sembly was the boule,the Council of 400 citizens (perhaps from the upperclasses) who deliberated the laws. He may have given limited citizen priv-ileges to craftsmen and hired laborers, some of whom were foreign born.Though these craftsmen owned no land at all, they worked in growingnumbers in the urban center of Athens. This evidence suggests that Solon’sreforms tied po liti cal privileges to economic class rather than to birth.While the richer citizens continued to have more po liti cal opportunities,the lower classes for the first time had some voice in how the city was to begoverned.Solon was also responsible for innovations in the judicial system: he in-stituted a new appeal pro cess, and he invented what in Athenian parlancewas called a “public” action to supplement the more customary “private”forms of legal recourse. This reform allowed any citizen, not just the in-jured party or his family, to prosecute certain kinds of injury. Moreover,family curse behind athenian democracy23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Solon reviewed the oldest written Athenian laws, the law code of Draco,which had been published just a few de cades before his own archonship(perhaps in 621). Solon abolished much of the harsh Draconian code withits reliance on capital punishment, and retained only those laws that ad-dressed hom i cide. But one aspect of Draco’s tradition that Solon did keepwas the commitment to making the nomoivisible to all. Solon had his newlaws, including the laws regulating cult practices and the worship of thegods, inscribed on big wooden tablets and publicly mounted in the Agora,where citizens of all property classes could refer to them. The beginningof public accountability is evident in the publication of the Solonian re-forms. Even if basic literacy was not yet widespread among all classes ofAthenians, this action marked the beginnings of the notion that the lawremained the same regardless of who was in power and implied that theeducated nobles were now being held accountable by those who could notnecessarily read the laws as published.Athenian tradition relates that Solon went into a self- imposed ten- yearexile once he had completed his full program of reforms— but only aftermaking the Athenians promise that they would not tinker with the reformsduring his absence. Solon declined any offers to stay in power; he insistedthat the Athenians live with the reforms and give them a chance to work.Solon’s reforms broke the monopoly on po liti cal power long held by thenoblest and wealthiest families, but at the same time his laws failed toplease any single group completely. His new po liti cal compromise betweenthe privileged aristocrats and the more humble working poor did not bridgethe structural gap that Athenian society was based upon, and no type ofpo liti cal reform could change the arid climate of Attica and the unpre-dictable environment that helped maintain the economic gaps. But Solon’sreforms did give a boost to those who had less wealth than the landedaristocracy.Po liti cal tensions between the classes remained and even increased in theyears after Solon stepped down, eventually resulting in a period of aristo-cratic “tyranny” when the noble- born Pisistratus first seized power around560. Pisistratus’s initial bid to become sole ruler, or tyrannos,in Athens didnot go smoothly. Despite alliances with po liti cal factions and other noblefamilies, Pisistratus was forced out of Attica twice before he actually suc-ceeded in establishing a stable tyranny in 546. “Tyranny” in today’s senseof a harsh and oppressive despotic rule overstates the situation as it existedin archaic Greece. Tyranny at that time was a common form of extra- constitutional monarchical rule, based perhaps on po liti cal models foundcleisthenes24"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"to the east in Lydia, located in modern- day Turkey. Indeed, the Greekword tyrannosis not native to the Greek language but is a loan word fromAsia Minor. In the ancient model of tyranny an aristocrat became tyrantwhen he seized power in a coup, or inherited power that had been soseized. In sixth- century Greek usage, tyrannoscame to mean somethingclose to our word “king”— Oedipus was tyrannosin the city of Thebes inSophocles’ famous tragedy Oedipus the King,whose Greek title is OedipousTyrannos.In sixth- century Athens, Pisistratus the tyrannosruled mildly. He en-joyed the support of certain aristocratic families and gained pop u lar ap-proval through his sponsorship of major civic and religious festivals. Dur-ing his reign Athens became an important Greek city with grand publicsanctuaries and civic festivals for the goddesses Athena and Demeter. Pisis-tratus constructed new buildings and commissioned artwork for sanctuar-ies on the Acropolis, and he built an altar to the twelve gods in the Agora.Dramatic festivals for the god Dionysus probably became pop u lar duringthe rule of Pisistratus and his sons. Pisistratus used traditional cult practicesto consolidate his power and advance a sense of cohesion and civic identityamong the Athenians. An anecdote in Herodotus illustrates how Pisistra-tus’s sense of po liti cal theater eased his first return from exile: he found anunusually tall and beautiful woman, and dressed and armed her likeAthena. This image of the goddess rode into Athens on a chariot announc-ing that she was bringing Pisistratus back to rule. When a rumor of Athena’sappearance reached the rural villages of Attica, townspeople rushed toAthens to see the per for mance and welcome Pisistratus back (Herodotus1.60). The earliest theater produced in Athens in the sixth century likewiserelied on a dramatic conceit in which costumed actors impersonated thegods; Pisistratus simply played off this traditional cultural pattern, and letthe demosparticipate alongside him in the civic drama.Pisistratus apparently intended to establish a hereditary aristocratic dy-nasty, and rule passed to his son Hippias at his death in 527. The case of Pi-sistratus and his sons shows us how demo cratic impulses in Athens devel-oped slowly and unevenly. The innovative reforms of Solon gave way to therenewed energies of the elites, led by the Pisistratid family for more thanfifty years. After the death of Pisistratus, public sanctuaries and civic festi-vals continued to play a crucial role in the history of Athens. When an up-rising against the Pisistratid tyranny did finally occur, it unfolded during apolis- wide annual festival honoring Athena. The celebration called thePanathenaea was famous for its elaborate and lengthy religious pro cessionfamily curse behind athenian democracy25"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"through the Agora and up the Acropolis; priests, civic magistrates, andarmed warriors accompanied the sacrificial animals to the altar of Athena.Hippias, like his father, used such civic festivals as a public stage to displayhis civic power. Visibly leading the worship of Athena, the divine guardianof Athens, provided Hippias with a good opportunity to connect with thedemos,display his largesse, and demonstrate his piety.Behind the scenes, elite resentment was growing against Hippias and hisyounger brother Hipparchus, and a small conspiracy was hatched amongsome aristocratic families. A group of Athenian men attending the Pana-thenaea armed themselves as though they were part of the pro cession, butin fact their target was Hippias. The attempted coup was unsuccessful. Inthe confusion before the pro cession started, Hippias dodged the assassin’sknife, but the weapon found its mark in his brother Hipparchus (Herodotus5.55; Thucydides 6.54–59; cf. Thucydides 1.20). The public murder ofHipparchus in 514 provided Hippias with the impetus to live up to themodern meaning of the title tyrant and he instituted a far more repressiveregime. This new regime would be short- lived. Two conspirators, Harmod-ius and Aristogeiton, lost their lives at the Panathenaea that day, but thetwo “tyrant slayers,” as they later came to be known, would be honored bycoming generations as the liberators of Athens. Statues of the two were setup in the Agora, where the demoswent about its daily business of honoringthe gods and governing the polis.the career and demo cratic reforms of cleisthenesLike the tyrants Hippias and Pisistratus, the demo cratic reformer Cleis-thenes came from an aristocratic family, indeed one of the most famousfamilies in archaic Greece. His father’s family had a long tradition of po- liti cal ser vice to Athens, and had funded public building projects in Del-phi. His maternal grandfather, also named Cleisthenes, had been tyrannosin the nearby polisof Sicyon in the Peloponnese, and members of his fam-ily had married into the ruling family of Pisistratus. In Athens it seemsthat the aristocratic Cleisthenes distinguished himself as leader in a differ-ent way. He gave real po liti cal power to the ordinary citizens, the demos,while creating a po liti cal advantage for his own family. Cleisthenes wentabout preparing for po liti cal reforms in a particularly militaristic fashion.As an aristocrat with close family and po liti cal ties to poleisbeyond Athens,Cleisthenes used his influence to enlist the aid of Cleomenes, king ofSparta. The Spartans were known to resist tyrants in their own polisand tocleisthenes26"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"dislike them in neighboring poleis.Cleomenes marched to Athens with asmall contingent of Spartan infantry and overthrew the tyranny of Hip-pias. Following the coup, Cleisthenes struggled with another Athenianleader for power, and he came out on top.While Solon had paved the way for a fairer distribution of wealth sev-eral generations earlier, it is Cleisthenes who is perhaps best credited withinstituting the reforms that mark the beginning of a true, recognizableAthenian democracy. Like Solon before him, Cleisthenes realized thatdemo cratic power was closely tied to the rural villages of Attica, even if thedemo cratic institutions— the assembly places, council houses, and law courts— were housed in the urban center of Athens. Keeping in mind theAthenians’ ties to the traditional rural way of life, Cleisthenes gave powerto the ordinary citizens in Attica by distributing power throughout the vil-lages or demes of the polis.More importantly, he redefined the very notionof what constituted a deme. Originally “deme” simply was the word forany of the towns, villages, and rural districts in the countryside of Attica.But after Cleisthenes a deme became the smallest po liti cal unit in the polis.The deme became the building block for clustering citizens into manage-able units that could function easily in a preindustrial society that lackedthe Internet, telephones, or newspapers. Demes were grouped to form twolarger po liti cal units— namely, the thirty sections (trittyes) and the ten newtribes (phylai) into which the trittyes were then folded.Traditionally, every male citizen born and living in Attica was a memberof a phratria,an ancient word that designated social groups that followedlines of male descent and had control over who was and was not recog-nized as a legitimate member of the Athenian citizen body. “Phratry” iscognate to the En glish word “brother” (compare the words “phratry” and“brother” to the Latin fraterand German Bruder), and as hereditary broth-erhoods the phratries had worked for generations to maintain blood tiesand po liti cal power among the aristocrats. Phratry members worshippedthe gods together at state- sponsored festivals, and they dined together oncertain civic and religious holidays. Active phratry membership was essen-tial for enjoying po liti cal privileges in the archaic polis.Cleisthenes’ reforms kept the institution of the phratries, and then clev-erly supplemented them by transforming the deme into the smallest con-stitutional unit that shared with them some of the same po liti cal, social,and religious functions. Rather than designating a mere rural or suburbanvillage as it had always done, the deme became the foundation supportingthe whole demo cratic apparatus. Cleisthenes’ reforms officially recognizedfamily curse behind athenian democracy27"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"139 demes, and deme membership became a component necessary for Athe-nian citizenship, in addition to traditional phratry membership. Member-ship in one of the demes, like that in a phratry, was inherited through thepaternal line. But the new Cleisthenic deme no longer simply designated aphysical place. The deme name was not necessarily an indication of thevillage where a citizen resided; it suggested which village his ancestorscame from. After Cleisthenes, the deme was a po liti cal unit, and Athenianmale citizens came to be identified by their deme name in addition to theirfather’s name— for example, Socrates’ full Athenian name was “Socrates,son of Sophroniscus, from the deme of Alopece.”One strength in Cleisthenes’ plan was that demes and phratries rein-forced each other. They remained separate social groups, but they sharedimportant social, ritual, and po liti cal functions. Since official written recordkeeping did not yet exist, citizens relied on each other and on their com-munal groups to determine citizenship in the polis.The polissponsored life- cycle rituals that celebrated the birth, po liti cal maturation, and marriage ofphratry and deme members. Deme and phratry members worshipped thegods together on a regular and predictable schedule of civic festivals. Mem-bership in a phratry and deme thus meant that peers in a citizen’s commu-nities witnessed him taking part in civic festivals and public feasts. In thisway demes and phratries shared a common purpose: both were social andpo liti cal groups that defined membership through active participation incivic rituals that also fulfilled a religious function.As a consequence of the new civic and religious roles of the deme envi-sioned by Cleisthenes, every citizen had multiple and overlapping peergroups that both established and continually validated his civic status. Thecomplex and interdependent bonds of civic identity in Athens were revealedeven more starkly in the combinations of demes to form the larger socialnetworks of citizens, namely the thirty sections and the ten tribes. Cleis-thenes grouped each village (deme) with neighboring villages to constitute asection, or a trittys;he defined thirty sections in all, roughly equal in popula-tion. Three sections were then grouped to constitute one of the ten tribes(the word for section, trittys,literally means “a third”). The ten tribes were inpart a holdover from more ancient times, but Cleisthenes also reworked thearchaic notion of “tribe.” Before him there had been four tribes, the so- called Ionian tribes that had performed certain ritual functions, and he leftthem intact for some cultic purposes; he handed over other religious ritesand nearly all the po liti cal functions to ten newly created tribes, each namedafter a different semi- mythical hero, such as Cecrops or Aegeus.cleisthenes28"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The great innovation in Cleisthenes’ plan was in the composition ofeach of the ten tribes. The politics of Attica had been growing increasinglycomplicated because of local tensions that were arising between three geo -graph i cally identifiable interest groups: the people of the coastal region,the inland agrarian residents, and the growing number of urban dwellersin and around Athens. To combat the potentially crippling effects of frac-tures along geo graph i cal lines, each of the ten tribes was composed ofthree sections, drawn equally from each of the three regions of Attica. Inthis way the ten Cleisthenic tribes had a geo graph i cally scattered member-ship, and regional special interests could not rule the day.If the demes are viewed as the building blocks for the foundation ofAthenian democracy, then these ten new tribes are what provided a work-ing structure for the Cleisthenic system. Public offices of every imaginablesort were filled either by direct election or, more commonly, by a lotterysystem within each tribe. A combined pro cess of election and lottery wasused to select the important officers known as archons (archontes,“lead-ers”). The archonship was an ancient office that predated the Solonian andCleisthenic reforms. After Cleisthenes’ reforms, nine archons and a secre-tary were selected annually, one official from each tribe, for one- year termsas magistrates with religious and judicial duties. The pro cess of selectingthe archons in the new system involved first direct election of a pool ofcandidates, and then a lottery. This procedure apparently layered the olderaristocratic method beneath the newer Cleisthenic idea. Upon leavingoffice all ex- archons were eligible to serve on an ancient advisory boardcalled the Council of the Areopagus, which retained judicial powers forcertain legal proceedings including hom i cide and some religious cases.This council was one of the oldest institutions in Athens— it existed longbefore the reforms of Solon and Cleisthenes— and though its duties weregradually reduced over time, its core responsibilities illustrate a deep- seated assumption that the religious and po liti cal aspects of the stateoverlapped.After the reforms of Cleisthenes, decision making and legislative powers were located in two demo cratic bodies. The body called the ekklesia,orAssembly, was open to all citizens, and it met about every ten days on ahillside in Athens called the Pnyx (figure 2). Athens probably had tens ofthousands of citizens, but judging from the size of the Pnyx a maximumof 6,000 to 8,000 attended the meetings. In some instances the Assemblyalso functioned as a large jury.

Each tribe’s committee of fifty was given the responsibility of presidingover the bouleand ekklesiafor a portion of each year called a prytany. Dur-ing that time the citizens were known as the fifty prytaneis,or presidents,and for one- tenth of the year (a little longer than a lunar month) they per-formed the executive functions and daily governance of the polis.The fiftypresidents were required to live in the city, and they dined at public expensein a public building called the Tholos. The office of the fifty prytaneisro-tated by lot through the ten tribes established by Cleisthenes, and even thedaily chairmanship of the fifty presidents, the office of the epistates,wasselected by lottery each day.The ten Cleisthenic tribes fulfilled other duties for the polis.Quotas ofhoplites for the infantry were determined on an equal basis for each of thecleisthenes30Figure 2.

Each tribe annually elected one of the ten generals, the strategoi,who made the military decisions for that year. The office of general wasone of the few in demo cratic Athens that was elected directly and not se-lected by lottery. Boards of magistrates were also selected equally from theten tribes. Each tribe even sent competing teams of athletes, singers, anddancers to represent it at polis- sponsored festivals.The direct democracy of Cleisthenic Athens described here is more rad-ical than the modified forms of repre sen ta tional democracy in place today.Athenian demo cratic institutions as they existed after Cleisthenes and intothe age of Pericles in the fifth century ensured that every citizen could reg-ularly participate in communal decision making. The only impediments toparticipation were practical: a combination of time, distance from the city,and money. If a citizen could afford to take a day off from work, then hecould go to Athens and exercise his po liti cal privileges by serving on a jury,attending the Assembly, or participating in a civic religious rite.According to one tradition Cleisthenes also implemented the institutionof ostracism (another theory dates it a few de cades later). Every year thedemosas a body was given the opportunity to send away one citizen deemedto be potentially too powerful or dangerous for the good of the polis.Firstthe Athenians determined whether they wished to hold an ostracism vote;if an ostracism was held, citizens met in the Agora two months later andvoted by scratching the name of a candidate onto an ostrakon,or brokenpiece of pottery— the ancient equivalent of a piece of scrap paper. Whoeverreceived a plurality of the votes was banished from the polisfor a period often years. In this way the democracy placed a check on the po liti cal influ-ence of powerful leaders. Before the institution of ostracism, Athenianshad relied on the wisdom of their leaders to limit their own po liti cal powerby voluntarily going into exile, as Solon had done at the end of his periodof rule. Even after ostracism became official, few men actually receivedenough votes to be ostracized, but it did occasionally happen. BecauseCleisthenes abruptly falls out of the historical record following the year ofhis reforms, some scholars have proposed that Cleisthenes himself was im-mediately ostracized upon leaving office; others suggest that he left Athenson his own, in the tradition of Solon.The demo cratic reforms of Cleisthenes instituted in the last de cade of thesixth century were put into place against a backdrop of broader changes that were occurring all throughout the Greek- speaking poleisof the easternMediterranean. Greek cities continued to experience economic growth astrade expanded, and this growth led to the increasing importance of portfamily curse behind athenian democracy31"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"cities that took full advantage of their excellent natural harbors. Athens isonly one of the cities that followed this pattern; others included Corinth,which lay at the strategic isthmus between mainland Greece and the Pelo-ponnese, and Miletus in Asia Minor. The mounting influence of port citiesalso renewed tensions between residents of urban centers and rural areas— between those men whose wealth depended on the aristocratic connectionsto land and those who could build wealth despite being landless. Oftenthese tensions were played out in the development of religious practiceswithin cities. While the response to these changes took a demo cratic form inAthens, democracy was not the only possible outcome. Indeed, Athens wasconsidered unusual by its peers, and the governments of most other poleisei-ther continued with the traditional forms of kingship and aristocratic rule orexperienced tyranny, the extra- constitutional form of monarchy.The polisthat Cleisthenes left to the Athenians was far different fromthe other Greek city- states in the year 500. In Athens even men of modestmeans were free to speak out and disagree with the wealthy and powerful.The demostook an active role in helping to make decisions that would bein the interest of everyone, not just of the wealthy aristocrats. Commoncitizens ruled their peers, and in turn were ruled by them. Ancestral tribalforms of community and worship continued as always and were even aug-mented and elaborated on. The brilliance of Cleisthenes was that he usedthe traditional po liti cal and cultic communities and religious customs toreinforce new institutions that gave more power to the demos.His reformscreated an ever greater degree of accountability among all citizens. Politicsand civic religious practices both played an important role in the systemsof accountability.Cleisthenes himself had perhaps a curious familiarity with a brand ofcivic accountability that looked to both the man and to the communityfrom which the man came. He was a member of an old and well- establishednoble clan called the Alcmaeonidae, or the heirs of Alcmaeon. According toAthenian oral tradition, the Alcmaeonidae family had long been tainted bya curse. In the days of Cleisthenes’ great- grandfather Megacles in the mid- seventh century, an Athenian aristocrat named Cylon, flush with a recentvictory at the Olympian games, gathered a group of friends and allies and at-tempted a coup d’état. According to the historian Herodotus, Cylon hadmarried into the powerful ruling family in the neighboring polisof Megara,where the aristocrat Theagenes was then tyrannos.This was well before therises of Pisistratus, and Cylon had his eye on establishing the first tyranny inAthens. With his supporters Cylon seized the Acropolis.

When a group of Cylon’s allies tookrefuge at an altar on top of the Acropolis, Megacles and his supporters prom-ised to let them go if they would hand over their weapons. Cylon’s men did so— but Megacles and his followers did not live up to their part of the agree-ment, and in their outrage and fury they murdered some followers of Cylon.Cylon, the man who wanted to be the first tyrant in Athens, managed toescape the carnage.Violating the sanctity of an altar of the gods was deadly serious busi-ness. Murder was a capital crime, but spilling human blood on groundholy to the deathless gods was doubly intolerable and could taint a familyand a whole city for generations to come. For this crime Megacles and hisentire family were found guilty of impiety and expelled from Attica. Butit was not only Megacles and his sons who were forced into exile. TheAthenians were so offended by Megacles’ impious actions against the polisand its religious traditions that at a later time they expelled even the bonesof Megacles’ ancestors, and cursed all of Megacles’ descendants. WhenMegacles’ son Alcmaeon and his sons (the Alcmaeonidae) later returnedto Attica and to public life, they too were haunted by the curse and theloss of their ancestral ties to the land, symbolized in the exiled bones ofthe ancestors (Herodotus 5.71–73; Thucydides 1.126; Aristotle AthenianConstitution1).Alcmaeon’s son Megacles felt the effects of the curse when trying tomarry off one of his daughters. The tyrant Pisistratus agreed to marry her,but because of the curse on the family he reportedly would not run therisk of having children by her, and they apparently never had intercourse.When Megacles learned of this he became enraged. It was left to his sonCleisthenes to finally escape the taint of the “curse of the Alcmaeonidae.”As a grandson of Alcmaeon and one of the family of the Alcmaeonidae,Cleisthenes also lacked the ancestral ties to Attica common among Athe-nian citizens. Cleisthenes’ early career shows him serving as one of the ar-chons under the tyrant Hippias, perhaps in an effort to fit in and cooper-ate with Athenian aristocrats who supported the tyranny, but later he wentinto exile and encouraged the Spartans to overthrow the tyranny of Hip-pias. When the Spartan general Cleomenes forced Hippias from power, hefeared the rise of another tyrannos,namely Cleisthenes. So the Spartansagain reminded the Athenians of the curse that dogged the Alcmaeonidae.But here Cleisthenes outsmarted the Spartans: he counteracted the curseon his family’s ancestors by symbolically aligning himself with the Athenianfamily curse behind athenian democracy33"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"demos,and against tyrants and aristocratic governments that would use anymeans available to restrict the opportunities and power of the common citi-zens.

The same institutionsthat made and enforced laws also demanded that citizens actively partici-pate in festivals that honored the city’s gods. Religious customs permeatedthe fabric of Athenian society and politics. This fundamental differencebetween Athenian democracy and democracy in modern states, especiallyin the West, cannot be underestimated. For Athenians there was no sepa-ration between what we today consider church and state.cult and democracy from a polytheistic perspectiveThe polisof Athens emerged from the sixth century with a new form of gov-ernment: demokratia.During the fifth century, Athens also found itself inother new roles. Athens formed an alliance with some neighboring Greekpoleisand overcame a foreign invasion. Later in the fifth century, Athenswould even for a time pursue the dream of empire. But regardless of the poli-cies that the Athenian government pursued during these de cades of rapidchange, demo cratic governance in Athens would never be separated from theinstitutions and officials that maintained traditional cult practices and wor-ship of the gods. In this regard, the demo cratic reforms of Cleisthenes didnot produce a regime that differed from other poleis.In Athens a commonassumption was passed down through the generations: the bedrock of theAthenians’ shared experience was the mutual reinforcement of religion andpolitics, which expressed a common goal. A prosperous city demonstrated itsprosperity in the celebration of public rituals, and this city ensured its futureprosperity by keeping to the old ways of the fathers: ta patria.Scholars who study ancient Greece have described fifth- century Athensas a direct democracy. Policies were determined by direct vote of the citi-zens, and almost every state office was filled with citizens who were directlyselected by lot. Athenians developed elaborate lottery systems to select thecitizens who would serve their turn in a par tic u lar office for a fixed period.The most significant reforms to the governance of the polis were made un-der the leadership of Solon and Cleisthenes, who redefined property classes,religion and the demo cratic polis37"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"established the demes, and made the decision- making bodies more egali-tarian by opening up additional public offices to citizens of modest means.Most public offices were held a relatively short time, often for one monthor even one day, and rarely ever for more than one year. After Cleisthenes,the only major offices not filled by lottery at some level were the ten gener-als or strategoi,directly elected from each tribe, who led the army and navyand determined military strategy during times of war. During the periodof the Athenian empire, the officials in charge of the trea sury were likelyalso chosen by direct election. These Athenian practices stand in contrastto familiar, modern forms of demo cratic bureaucracy. Many of the higheroffices in the United States are held by elected officials who rely on profes-sional civil servants and private consulting firms to carry out the mundanetasks of governing the nation and implementing policy. Even the U.S.military has been made up entirely of professionals since the eliminationof the draft at the end of the Vietnam War, and today much of the workthat supports the U.S. armed forces is performed by private contractors.But there was no professional class of civil servants in ancient Athens.Athens also became a cultic democracy after the reforms of Cleisthenes,in the sense that all public offices in the polis were committed to uphold-ing the ancestral practices of polytheistic worship. Altars of the gods werelocated in or near the places where citizens met to debate and discuss af-fairs of state, and formal relations between poleislikewise included the wor-ship of the gods. These ancestral polytheistic practices, called ta patriaandta nomizomena,themselves were a visible expression of the social and po lit-i cal values in which Athenians in the fifth century took great pride.It is well- known today that the Greeks were polytheistic. Even childrenwho watch Disney’s animated cartoon of Hercules can say that the an-cient Greeks believed in many gods and told stories about these gods andheroes. The ancient world of multiple deities differs starkly from that ofthe single, mono the istic God who stands behind the contemporary West-ern traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. But ancient polytheismcannot be reduced to a Technicolor cartoon world of exaggerated godsand colorful heroes. Polytheism is not an intermediate stop on the roadfrom primitive pantheistic chaos to rational and unitary mono the ism, aswas once argued by historians of religion who worked within the same nineteenth- century intellectual frameworks that produced Darwin’s the-ory of evolution. For these earlier scholars, ancient polytheism was labeled“paganism,” and today some— especially those whose main point of refer-ence is largely Christian or monotheistic— still call it that.athena38"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The eigh teenth and nineteenth centuries also produced secular human-ists who set aside the personal God of traditional Christianity and valuedvirtuous knowledge and an impersonal deity above all else. Enlightenmentfigures in the seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries looked to the Greeksand Romans for sources of secular, humanistic wisdom. Phi los o phers andliterary scholars read such Greek authors as Homer, Plato, and Sophocles;they culled passages and quotations from the ancient texts that reinforcedtheir own beliefs in a rational and comprehensible cosmos. While the ef-forts of secular humanists did yield some valuable insights, their methodlargely ignored the details of Greek religious behaviors, and in the endtheir understanding of ancient cultures was limiting. Secular humaniststended to skip over the gory details of cult practice, perhaps because itseemed too “primitive” for their taste. But twentieth- century sociologistsand anthropologists learned how to read the grammar of ritual and makesense of it. The ancient civic custom of polytheistic worship required allcitizens to regularly participate in traditional rites. A religious system likethat of the Greeks and Athenians valued human actions and demandedinteraction with the recognized divine powers. Modern scholarship hassuggested that questions of individual belief and personal faith were oflittle consequence in an ancient polytheistic worldview.What we recognize as Mediterranean polytheism emerged relatively re-cently in the span of human history— probably during the past ten thou-sand years, when nomadic societies were learning to domesticate herdanimals and cultivate cereal crops. Polytheism, a coherent system for or ga -niz ing a divine world, was articulated in response to networks of humansocial and economic relationships. As men and women began to live inmore permanent settlements, their early urban societies developed socialhierarchies that had the task of controlling and distributing food sur-pluses. The people living in or ga nized towns worshipped deities who con-trolled the natural environment and determined the fertility of crops andherds. Greeks, like their neighbors around the eastern Mediterraneanbasin, reckoned that there were as many powerful deities as there wereskills necessary to maintain human communal life. Polytheism, then, inpart delineates an ancient landscape of practices and stories that projectedthe human physical and social world onto a parallel cosmos of divine per-sonalities.The gods that the Greeks worshipped and told stories about were both fa-miliar to them and at the same time undeniably foreign. Like humans, thegods had a recognizable human form and individual personal traits— eachreligion and the demo cratic polis39"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"god possessed distinct strengths and weaknesses. Taken collectively, the godsand goddesses formed a social network of complex familial relationships notunlike human family groups. But the gods were also fundamentally differentfrom mortal humans, because their divine lives were not dictated by wantand loss. The gods’ well- being and very existence did not depend on therhythm of the seasons or the physical labor involved in food production.The gods did not carefully watch the weather, cultivate the land, tend theflocks, or plan for future shortages by setting aside current surpluses.Nor could the gods be touched by the finality of death, thanatos.TheGreeks recognized blood as the warm stuff of life that courses throughthe veins of humans and animals alike, and that causes almost certain deathwhen it flows too freely from the body. But blood was absent from the di-vine circulatory system. Instead, the gods’ veins were imagined to be filledwith a special liquid called ichfrthat did not share the same mortal prop-erties as blood. “The deathless ones” was one name for the gods in the Greeklanguage, the athanatoi(the prefix a- negates thanatos). Their divine food,ambrosia,likewise means “immortal stuff.” The opposite of immortal isbrotos,mortal, and a brotosis a mortal man who toils upon the earth for hislivelihood.These links between work, food, blood, and death are deeply embeddedin the language, myths, and rituals of the Greeks and other peoples wholived around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The archaic Greekpoet Hesiod tells of how mortal men once lived and dined in ease amongthe gods. Mortals lived in this work- free and pain- free utopia until they were punished for a mistake involving the preparation and distribution offood at a feast. As a consequence, mortals were forever separated from theimmortals, and mortal men were required to live with women and toil everafterward (Hesiod Theogony 507–616 and Works and Days 53–105). We knowthis story as the Greek myth of the god Prometheus, who gave the gift offire to mortal men and was responsible for the creation of the first mortalwoman, Pandora. The themes and narrative pattern of this myth resonatewith another familiar story in the Western tradition— the story of the gar-den of Eden in Genesis. Here again an immortal god banishes the mortalfrom paradise, and sentences him and his wife to a harsh life of toilingupon the earth until they succumb to old age and inevitable death.In both the Greek and Israelite stories, mortal women are singled out forspecial punishments that draw attention to their sexual and reproductivestatus in society. Other similarities between West Asian myth and themyths of the Greeks made pop u lar by Homer and Hesiod in the seventhathena40"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"century have led some scholars to reconstruct likely avenues of influenceand cultural exchange in the eastern Mediterranean. In fact, some of whatwe think of as Greek mythology may have originated further east andsouth in Asia and Africa, and then traveled by word of mouth along traderoutes to the Greek- speaking peoples of modern- day Turkey. In time theeastern motifs and patterns were adapted and assimilated into preexistingstories, many of which had entered Greece in the second millennium bcewith the invasions of nomadic tribes from the north. The cultural inter-changes that took place from the ninth through the sixth centuries are acomplex phenomenon that scholars continue to explore and document.After some generations of influence from technologically more advancedcultures to the east and south, Greek myth took on a recognizable form inthe art and poetry of the Geometric and Archaic periods in the eighththrough the sixth centuries. The gods of Homer remain familiar today: Zeus,Aphrodite, Athena, and Apollo. Yet our common supposition that there ex-isted a fixed pantheon of Greek divinities may well be too neat. The canon-ical number is twelve— those deities depicted on the east pediment of theParthenon in Athens, over the main entrance to the great temple built at theheight of imperial Athenian power. But the nature of polytheism in antiq-uity is far too fluid for precise categories. Gods and heroes were constantlybeing added to the great family of deities, including foreign gods that theGreeks encountered in such far- flung places as Egypt, Syria, and Persia. Thecosmopolitan world of classical and Hellenistic Greece welcomed all godsinto the city. The word “polytheism” itself was not even needed in PericleanAthens; the concept was unimaginable until the Greeks encountered mono -the ism in the Roman world of the first century ce. At that time Philo, a Pla-tonic phi los o pher and native Greek- speaking Jew living in Roman- ruledEgypt, coined the word “mono the ism” when he wrote Greek philosophicalcommentaries on the traditional Hebrew scriptures. Like the modern world,antiquity was a time of intense intermingling of cultures and peoples of di-verse ethnic backgrounds.As is the case with the word “polytheism,” there is no separate, uniqueword in the Greek language that scholars can translate as “religion.” In-stead, Greeks spoke of acts and behaviors when they talked about what wethink of as religion. In place of “religion” and “polytheism” they usedcommon words denoting pious and impious actions. Eusebeia(commonlytranslated as “piety”) and its opposite asebeia(impiety) meant the properand improper observance of ancestral customs of worshipping (seb-) theappropriate gods at the proper times in the proper ways. Worshipping thereligion and the demo cratic polis41"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"gods properly required being aware of the natural rhythms of the seasonsand of the agricultural year, and celebrating the social institutions thatcharacterize human community. Eusebeiain ancient Athens encompassedall three realms: the natural environment, the human social world, and thedivine cosmos of the gods. The sequence of festivals observed by Atheni-ans demonstrates how the natural, the human, and the divine are constantlyoverlapping and working in response to one another. Since life in theGreek cities depended on the successful cycles of cultivation and agricul-tural labor, there were major public festivals scattered throughout the yeardedicated to the gods who oversaw the fertility of the land. Both the pro-duction and storage of cereal crops and the manufacture and storage ofwine were essential for life in Attica, and festivals of Demeter and Diony-sus became major public events; these deities and their festivals will be dis-cussed in more detail in chapters 4 and 6 below. For Athenians the ancestralcustoms that honored the city’s patroness Athena also defined them po liti -cally, and these civic rites came to express feelings of Athenian pride and,sometimes, superiority over neighboring poleis.Beyond meeting the physical demands of the environment, daily life inAttica and the mechanisms of Athenian democracy were or ga nized aroundsmaller social groups of citizens, namely deme and tribe. Regularly sched-uled civic rites brought these smaller communities together and enabled cit-izens to honor the gods at the same time that they marked membership intheir human society. For example, civic festivals in each of the 139 demesmarked the official coming- of- age for youths, called ephebes, and civic festi-vals incorporated new wives and new babies into the ten tribes establishedby Cleisthenes. At the same time, Athenians marked the unity of the largerpolisby celebrating Athena and Theseus, the mythical hero who long agotook the members of the ten tribes and combined them into a single po liti -cal unity. Today many know Theseus as the hero who traveled to Crete toslay the Minotaur, but the Athenians knew him as their founding hero whowas credited with uniting the scattered villages of Attica. During the fifthcentury Theseus gained in popularity as a figure in art and in the Athenianpo liti cal imagination. Some contemporary scholars have linked his increas-ing presence in Athenian art and myth to the late sixth- century po liti cal re-forms of Cleisthenes. It was only after Cleisthenes’ reforms that the com-mon polis- wide festival in honor of Theseus came to celebrate the po liti calunification of the state, just as the festival called the Synoikia celebratedAthena and the unification of Attica.athena42"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"In the generations after the unification of Attica, Athenians fixed an offi-cial calendar for their state- sponsored civic feasts. The complex civic andpolytheistic systems of the ancient Mediterranean resulted in the completeabsence of a commonly accepted Greek calendar, a situation that seemsstrange and awkward today. It was not uncommon to refer to historicalevents by the season of year, the phase of the moon, or even some other un-usual celestial event such as a lunar or solar eclipse. Athens itself functionedwith several overlapping calendars; the archon’s calendar was lunar, but theboule’s was solar. In Athens inscriptions could refer to the eponymous ar-chon (i.e., the archon for whom the year was named) or the secretary of thebouleto date events, but this method had little meaning for people outsideof Athens. The four- year cycle of the panhellenic Olympiad was common toall Greeks, and numbering the Olympiads also became a shared referencepoint. But beyond this there was no standard Greek way of reckoning time.While a handful of panhellenic festivals were celebrated by all Greeks(e.g., festivals at Olympia and Delphi), few holidays were shared by every city- state. A par tic u lar festival in Attica was probably not celebrated inneighboring Corinth or Sparta at the same time. Two recognized ethnic/linguistic groups among Greek poleis,the Dorians and Ionians, did ob-serve many of the same festivals, but differences remained in the detailsof each calendar. The different civic calendars of the Greek poleisdid noteven recognize the same New Year’s celebration. In Athens the new yearbegan in summer, but in other cities like Delphi the new year began inthe spring. Regardless of when the year started, the Greeks commonlydid divide the solar year to into twelve lunar months, and each monthbegan with the new moon. But there was no seven- day week in the Greekworld, and no weekend or day of rest. These innovations came with theRoman Empire almost a thousand years later, and were based on the ritesof a Persian god named Mithras and on the Jewish calendar as inheritedby early Christians.Without any weekly structure to make up the month, each month hadits own unique rhythm of work days and festival days. The name of eachmonth was drawn from a major festival par tic u lar to that month, and sinceeach polisdesignated its own festivals, even the names for the months var-ied from polisto polis.For instance, Thucydides reports that when thepeace of 421 took effect, it was “the fourth day from the end of the monthof Artemision” for the Spartans, but for the Athenians it was “the sixthday from the end of the month of Elaphebolion” (Thucydides 5.19). Inreligion and the demo cratic polis43"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Attica the Athenian Assembly legislated the official calendar of monthlycivic festivals celebrated by all. Then each deme was responsible for or ga -niz ing its own community festivals that supplemented those at the largerpolis- wide level. In fifth- century Athens this meant that each of the nearly140 demes followed its own separate deme calendar, in addition to follow-ing the civic calendar common to all Athenians. Three good examples ofthese deme calendars have been preserved. Like many Athenian laws, thefestival calendars were inscribed on stone and placed in public where citi-zens could refer to them.The Athenian calendar also preserved festivals that existed before Cleis-thenes’ reforms and the institution of the demes. The Apatouria, a three- dayIonian festival in the fall, was set aside to celebrate the phratries and theirnew members, including any new wives who married into the tribe. The Ap-atouria celebration appears to be a very ancient one that predates the periodof Ionian colonization; it was celebrated in Athens and in related Ioniancities of Asia Minor (cities such as Ephesos and Miletus). The Cleisthenicsystem allowed for overlapping po liti cal and cultic communities, and thedemes played a similar role in welcoming and enrolling new members.Males were enrolled in their deme at the age of 18 in a ritual not entirely un-like the Apatouria. Each of the ten Cleisthenic tribes also or ga nized an an-nual festival honoring the hero who gave his name to that tribe.Two par tic u lar deities were prominent in the Athenian civic calendar.The extended family headed by a patriarch was the cornerstone of Greeksociety, and this pattern of human social interaction was mirrored in thefestivals sacred to Zeus, the patriarch of the Olympian family of deities.Zeus, the acknowledged father of gods and men, was honored at countlessaltars in the city and throughout the countryside. Pisistratus began workon a massive temple for Zeus during his reign in the mid- sixth century.Construction of the Olympeium, situated to the southeast below the Acrop-olis, came to a halt at the death of Pisistratus, and the temple was not fullycompleted until the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian more than 600years later. In the meantime Athenians worshipped Zeus at his other altars,as when they honored Zeus Polieus, the god in his role as protector of thepolis,at a festival called the Dipolieia held in the sanctuary of Zeus on theAcropolis in early summer.Even more important to the Athenians as a civic group was the goddessAthena. Because Athens had been since prehistoric times a city sacred tothe virginal daughter of Zeus, festivals for Athena were prominent, espe-cially during the summer months when farmers enjoyed a bit of leisureathena44"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"time before the harvests. The goddess was worshipped in her differentmanifestations experienced by mortals: for example, Athena Parthenos(the unmarried daughter of father Zeus), Athena Nike (the goddess ofvictory in battle), and Athena Polias (the goddess of the civic poliscomple-mentary to Zeus Polieus). First among the festivals of Athena was thePanathenaea, an annual civic celebration of Athena Polias that every fouryears became a grand international event called the Great Panathenaea.The Panathenaea featured pro cessions that wound through the city andascended the Acropolis, where the sanctuary of the goddess crowned thehighest point in the city. It was at this festival that the tyrant Hipparchuswas assassinated in 514 shortly before the Cleisthenic demo cratic reforms.Zeus and Athena may have been worshipped at the city’s most prominentaltars and sanctuaries, but throughout the urban center of Athens the polisbuilt and maintained many other major temples and shrines, places that were sacred to other gods and heroes who helped the city function properly.Those honored in the city included figures such as the god Dionysus and thehero Theseus. Many more shrines lay scattered throughout the countrysideof Attica, where Athenians could pay homage both to major deities such asPoseidon, Artemis, and Demeter and to the minor divinities of the rivers,woods, and pastures that helped nourish the polis.Worship of ancestral deities was not visible in the public realm alone,however. Every house hold possessed small shrines and altars. The hearth ofeach house hold was sacred to the goddess Hestia, and the symbolic civichearth of the city that guarded an eternal flame was located in a buildingcalled the Tholos, which also functioned as a public dining room for the cit-izens who served their terms as prytaneis.Private observances among familiesin individual house holds mirrored what happened in the shared social worldof the city. A citizen man raised up prayers both at home among his familyand in the polisamid his fellow citizens. Figure 4 depicts an intimate domes-tic moment as a warrior heads off to war, the husband pouring a libationwhile his wife and perhaps his father (on the far left) look on. Private indi-viduals dedicated thank offerings to the same gods that public magistratesand state ambassadors honored on behalf of the city.The full range of personal and house hold traditions even included“magical” practices: curses and incantations were aimed at rivals in busi-ness, love, and sports. Ancient Greek society was highly competitive, andresorting to these traditional practices was not uncommon. Although thepractices of so- called magic may seem today more like primitive supersti-tion than solemn worship of great heavenly powers, evidence suggests thatreligion and the demo cratic polis45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"these customs were widespread. An example of a clay doll, complete withpins and attached curses stuck into it, has been excavated from a wellabandoned in fourth- century Athens.

Perse-phone and Hades had recognizable authority precisely because of the inti-macy of their relationships to Zeus— Persephone was his daughter, andHades his brother. Hecate’s powers were even more ancient than the patri-arch’s, but still inferior, since Zeus had earlier defeated her generation ofgods in battle.

Zeus remained the recognized pa-triarch who called the gods to assembly, mea sured out impartial justice,and oversaw the legitimacy of human oaths. He could not be easily con-nected to curses and sinister incantations; such activity was not appropri-ate to him. But some of Zeus’s closest relatives were given dominion overthese darker powers. The divine division of labor in this family networkreveals another specialized skill that was considered necessary for the polisto function as it should— the skill of malevolent cursing that was betterpracticed far from the light of day.The responsibility of managing the complex patterns of traditional wor-ship in the polisfell to the people themselves, the collective demos.As theAthenian constitution changed during the sixth and fifth centuries andthe polisbecame more demo cratic, so did the religious and social customs.The ten magistrates called archons exercised religious authority along withother civic duties for one- year terms; after reforms in the early fifth century,archons were chosen by lot from a list of candidates approved by the demos.Young men were socialized into the customs of Athens. Upon reaching theage of 18 boys became ephebes, and most probably left home at this time toundergo a period of intense training. Much of the instruction was aimed athoning physical and military skills, but there is evidence that the ephebesfulfilled ritual duties for the polisat sacrifices, pro cessions, and certain festi-vals, including the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Dionysia, and the Plynteria.Additional civic priests and officials present at festivals and sacrifices weremale citizens who were also selected by lot. But the offices of priesthood re-vealed vestiges of the pre- democratic past, and they were not always dis-tributed so openly. Although guidelines were changed so that some priest-hoods could be filled by citizens other than the wealthy aristocrats, otherpriestly offices— far more ancient than the new demo cratic institutions— continued to be held for life. These hereditary priesthoods were handeddown through the paternal line and stayed within ancient tribal lineages.Yet other priesthoods were direct appointments held for a fixed time. Somepriestly offices were even put up for sale, a practice that made them avail-able only to the aristocracy, and the polisused the monies to help financethe festivals and purchase the necessary sacrificial animals.Regardless of the par tic u lar type of priestly office, being a priest was notnormally an activity that required specialized knowledge or training be-yond that with which any male citizen would be familiar. While the ances-tral customs of the polisdid require religious specialists who read entrails,religion and the demo cratic polis47"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"divined omens, and butchered carcasses, every adult male citizen was con-sidered qualified to perform the ancestral customs of ta patriaand couldtherefore officiate as one of the priests at a sacrifice. This ability to functionas a priest was one of the privileges of being a male citizen in Athenian so-ciety. Foreigners and noncitizens could not be priests, and female priestessesgenerally required a male butcher and civil magistrate to complete a sacri-ficial slaying. Any individual male citizen could serve as priest in his demeor in his own house hold at a family feast, and he could butcher the meat (ifhe knew how) and distribute it to the invited guests. What all the priestlyfunctions have in common, though, is that they enabled ordinary men toexercise a powerful type of authority within the human social sphere. Citi-zens could assume the authority of communicating directly with the godson behalf of the po liti cal community.‘thysia’: civic sacrifice and the ‘polis’A public festival in ancient Athens filled what today we consider separatecivic, religious, social, and nutritional human needs. Politics and religionin the ancient world had social functions and meanings that fully inter-twined; the modern categories “church” and “state” had no place in anyGreek polis.Concern for the proper worship of the gods was deeply embed-ded in all levels of society, and the giving of gifts was laden with symbolicimportance. Ancestral customs demanded specific offerings for certaingods at certain festivals. Acceptable offerings varied. Personal items suchas clothing, locks of hair, toys, or house hold items could be given as votivegifts. Terra- cotta votive plaques and miniature vases were manufacturedexpressly to be given as offerings at sanctuaries. Even the consumption offood was invested with religious meaning, and perhaps the most commongifts to the gods were foodstuffs: wine, milk, or honey could be poureddirectly into the earth, while grains, cakes, vegetable offerings, and animalofferings could be deposited or burned at an altar.As alien as it may seem for citizens in modern Western democracies, per-haps the most important Greek po liti cal custom was the complex of ritualsthat surrounded the custom of thysia,or animal sacrifice. This practice ofthysiastood at the very heart of ta patria,the ancestral customs. Greek cus-tom and myth both maintained that thysiawas meant to please the gods— although not every sacrifice always went according to plan. When some-thing did go awry during the ritual, the sacrifice was considered not pleasingand it was rejected. At the same time, the practice of thysiaoffered the in-athena48"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"habitants of the ancient city one of their only opportunities for the con-sumption of red meat. Meat was a precious commodity in the ancient econ-omy, especially as cities expanded and urban populations grew. The land ofAttica could not support herds large enough to feed all the city’s inhabitantswith a regular diet of daily— or even weekly— meat protein. Red meat wasnot commonly for sale in large quantities in the markets where seafood andagricultural products were sold. Commercial refrigeration did not exist, ofcourse, and there were no ways available to preserve meat and keep it fit forhuman consumption. In place of red meat as a source of protein, Atheniansrelied more on fowl and fish. Seafood was a central part of the Atheniandiet, particularly fish, which could be readily salted and preserved. But ac-cording to ancestral custom, the gods did not require humans to sacrificefish blood and make it holy at an altar. While those who lived in the coun-tryside may have enjoyed red meat more often than their city- dwelling peers(only after sacrificing at an altar in a village, or at a house hold shrine), itis clear that ancient technological and economic conditions did not allow formeat eating in the manner familiar to us today.The customs of thysiacombined civic and religious meanings with thebiological necessity for protein in the healthy human diet. Because Greekpoleisor ga nized the distribution of meat only after po liti cal officials dedi-cated part of the animal to the gods, meat eating became explicitly linkedin this society to po liti cal identity. Elected civil magistrates stood side byside with the citizen priests at the altar, and saw to it that the sacrificewas done in accordance with law and custom. The priest exercised the au-thority to lead the complex proceedings and carry them out as always hadbeen done; this was the very essence of ta patriaand ta nomizomena.Afterprophets and seers with specialized training examined the lobes of theliver and looked for signs from the gods, the mageiros,another civic officialpresent, worked as butcher, cook, and religious specialist all rolled intoone. The entire inner circle of citizens who actually performed the variouscomponents of the thysiaceremony were considered the closest to thegods. These men made sure that the gods received their portion first, andthen they were honored by consuming what were considered the choicestbits of the animal’s flesh: the splanchna,which consisted largely of organmeat. Once these morsels were roasted and eaten by the priests and civicofficials, the mageirossupervised the butchering and cooking of the ani-mal’s carcass, and the equal distribution of the meat to the other citizenswho were in attendance.

Female goddessessuch as Athena and Artemis tended to get female victims (sometimes evena pregnant one), but not always. Sheep and goats were common offerings.Zeus liked bulls, and the pig was especially beloved by the earth goddessDemeter. Some rites even excluded the blood of animal sacrifice and in-stead demanded food offerings of fruit, vegetables, or grains. The price formaking the wrong sort of offering could be very high: one fourth- centurypriest, charged with dedicating a bloody animal offering to Demeter whena vegetable one was required, appeared before his peers in court to defendhimself on charges of impiety, asebeia.His fellow Athenians voted to puthim to death. Violations of the traditional sacred laws were taken very se-riously by Athenian citizens— not because they were superstitious aboutfuture outcomes, but because they were committed to their civic duty ofupholding the customs of their ancestors.the panathenaeaPerhaps the best way to get inside the Athenian experience of civic religionand cultic democracy is to look closely at one festival that was particularlysacred to Athenians. The Panathenaea was an Athenian festival that hon-ored Athena Polias, the patron goddess of the city. The role of thysiaat thePanathenaea was essentially similar to its role at other civic festivals in At-tica. Analyzing the rituals and their urban and social settings can bring uscloser to the Athenians, whose worldview embraced ancestral gods and cus-toms related to these gods, and who worked hard to maintain connectionsbetween what was considered the overlapping worlds of gods and mortals.Athena had long been the patron goddess of Athens. Physical evidencefor her worship stretches further back than the literary record. The princi-pal site for observing her cult was the summit of the Acropolis, which showstraces of having been a fortified palace complex in the Mycenaean period.The archaeological remains do not at present precisely indicate whenAthena’s shrines and altars were first built, but her most ancient shrinemay well have been on the site of the fifth- century building called theErechtheum, and by the mid- sixth century Athenians were building mon-umental stone temples for their goddess. The origins of the Panathenaeaathena50"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"festival itself likewise appear to date from the Archaic period; Pisistratusmay have had a hand in popularizing the festival. Athena was an unmarrieddaughter of Zeus and a perpetual virgin who fiercely defended her chastity.With her warrior skills and uncommon wisdom she was in many ways morelike her father than were some of his well- known sons, gods such as Hermesand Dionysus. As a virginal parthenoswho remained unmarried, Athenawas never required to join the house hold of another man. Athena residedforever within the house hold of Zeus, under the influence and authorityof her father, the greatest patriarch of all. The Athenians respected suchloyalty in their patron goddess, and both Athena and Zeus were worshippedon the Acropolis, though first honors seem to have gone to Athena.The main feature of the early Panathenaea festival may have involved pre-senting the goddess with a gift. For the Athenians the most appropriate giftfor this goddess was a dress, peplos,that celebrated her victories in past battles.Famous scenes from the exploits of the virginal warrior goddess were perhapswoven into the peplos,especially a scene that featured Athena’s role alongsideZeus in the gods’ victory over the monstrous Giants. This scene would laterbe depicted in the artwork that adorned her temple complex on the fifth- century Acropolis. When she was not battling monsters and beasts, the un-married Athena was also well- known for her skill at the loom. In a similarway Athenian korai,the unmarried daughters of citizen families, were raisedto become skilled textile workers who prepared wool and wove at looms setup in homes alongside the hearth. For the festival of the Panathenaea, girlsof varying ages from the best aristocratic families were chosen to practiceand perfect their wool- working skills in ser vice to the goddess of the loom.For nearly a year these girls worked together to weave the goddess’s intri-cately decorated new peplos.At some point (we do not know exactly when)the festival was imagined as the birthday of Athena, and the peploswas thegift that the polisgave their protectress. Athena’s birthday was celebrated inthe midsummer month of Hekatombaion, the first month of the Attic cal-endar; by starting their civic year with their goddess’s birthday the Atheni-ans showed honor to their powerful patron.The sixth century was a time of significant changes in the fortunes ofAttica: Athens became a major economic center and a thriving city that at-tracted artisans from all over the Aegean region. In perhaps the middle ofthe sixth century, Athens took the important step of reor ga niz ing thebirthday celebration of their goddess, opening it up to other Greeks andmaking it a panhellenic event. Tradition has it that the tyrant Pisistratuswas ruling over Athens when these changes took place; scholars are unsurereligion and the demo cratic polis51"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"whether he personally pushed for these changes to the civic rites or the de-sire for change arose elsewhere within the polisand he just facilitated thereor ga ni za tion.The Athenians chose the panhellenic athletic festival as their modelwhen they refashioned the Panathenaea. For two centuries already, Greeksfrom different autonomous poleishad been gathering to honor the godswith athletic games celebrated at a sanctuary in Olympia— a small, cen-trally located village in the rural Peloponnesian peninsula. Homer sang ofsimilar athletic games in the Iliad:these are the funeral games that showedrespect for the gods while honoring the fallen warriors who died on theplains surrounding Troy. The games for Patroclus in Iliad23 highlightedthe arete,or manly virtue, of the best warriors. The games the men playedand the skills they honed were the skills needed on the Homeric battle-fields: footracing, boxing, javelin throwing, chariot racing. These wereprecisely the same games and contests held at the panhellenic athletic festi-val. But another essential aspect of the funeral games and the athletic fes-tival was the celebration of thysia.The gods were honored with animalsacrifice, while the athletes celebrated human community with the sharedsacrificial meal.The Olympian games celebrated in the rural sanctuary sacred to Zeus were actually the oldest of four sets of panhellenic games celebratedamong the Greeks. The Olympian games were probably established in theeighth century, and by 150 years later three other athletic festivals had beenadded to the panhellenic calendar: the Nemean games (also sacred to Zeus),the Isthmian (sacred to Poseidon), and the Delphic (sacred to Apollo).Each festival was held in a different region of Greece, and the games werecelebrated in either a two- or a four- year cycle. Because each festival wascelebrated in a different year of the cycle, at least one athletic festival wascelebrated each year. Sacred truces were in place for the duration of thefestivals, putting any military hostilities on hold for as long as the Greeks were united in honoring the gods and celebrating human community andmanly arete.Using these panhellenic festivals as their model, the Atheni-ans reor ga nized the Panathenaea in the sixth century: they celebratedAthena with an athletic festival every four years at the Great Panathenaea.For each of the other three years they honored the goddess’s birthday withthe more modest, traditional poliscelebration.The festival of the Great Panathenaea lasted at least four days. The firstdays were devoted to the panhellenic competitions. Male athletes fromthree age classes (boys, ephebes, and men) competed in the traditional ath-athena52"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"letic and equestrian events. First- and second- place winners were awardedjars of fine olive oil— the olive being a fruit associated with Athena andwidely cultivated throughout Attica. The olive oil was presented in costlyand beautifully painted vases known as Panathenaic amphorae. Theseunique vases depicted the warrior Athena on one side and the par tic u larathletic event on the other.Alongside the better- known athletic competitions of the pentathlon, thefootrace, and the four- horse chariot race, participants from all over Greececompeted in other traditional events that did not remain a part of the mod-ern Olympics when the games were revived in the late nineteenth century.Oral recitations of poetry, as well as musical and dance competitions, at-tracted men with more artistic talents. Solo musicians who played the harpand flute competed against each other, and performers of lyric poetry triedto win over the judges. Rhapsodes, the itinerant professional singers whomemorized and recited epic verse, also performed. Some scholars believethat it was the poetic competitions at the Great Panathenaic celebrationsunder the Pisistratid tyrants in the sixth century that helped rhapsodes fixthe canonical forms of Homer’s epics, the Iliadand Odyssey.Another op-portunity for song and dance came on the night after the last of the ath-letic competitions. This special eve ning, called the pannychis,featuredchoirs of Athenian youths and maidens who sang sacred songs in honor ofAthena. The event lasted late into the night and ushered in the day of thegreat pro cession up the Acropolis.Team sports of various kinds were also played at the Great Panathenaea,though these events were not panhellenic. Rather, these group events werereserved for the citizens of Attica. Each of the ten Cleisthenic tribes wererequired to supply teams for the events, and the ten tribes would thencompete against each other. There were sailing contests and ship regattas,and competitions of an old- fashioned war dance performed in full body armor— the pyrrhic dance. Torch races were also run by competing teamsfrom the ten tribes. Prizes for these Athenian- only events were not vasesof olive oil but oxen and money. The clear purpose of such prizes was toallow the winning tribal team another opportunity to sacrifice and feasttogether.Special festivals called for special offerings, and the highlight of theGreat Panathenaea was the pro cession on the final day. It was then thatthe Athenians presented the goddess with her animal sacrifices and herbirthday gift.

Visitors today to the BritishMuseum in London can see among the Elgin Marbles the sculpted friezethat ran about the interior portico of the fifth- century Athenian Parthenon.This frieze is thought by some to depict the Panathenaic pro cession itself,and the preparations for the great ritual of thysia.Men, youths, maidens, horses, sheep, and cows all make their way to the summit of the Acropolis,carry ing the items necessary for the ceremonial slaughter of the sacrificialanimals and the feast afterward.The grand pompeor pro cession of the Panathenaea started near the citygates in the Kerameikos quarter, where participants gathered along withthe animals. In the early fourth century, Athenians would build a monu-mental civic building for this very purpose, the Pompeion. The pompefirstfollowed the Panathenaic Way through the residential and commercialquarter of the Kerameikos, and from there into the city center and theAgora before finally ascending the slopes of the Acropolis to the altars andthe temple that housed the image of the goddess. A few women and girlsmarched alongside the men in the pro cession, and the peplosof Athena,the handiwork of Athenian maidens and women, was displayed on a cartfor all to see. When the Acropolis was rebuilt after the devastations of thePersian Wars and Athenians again pro cessed through the city to honortheir goddess, the peploswas displayed as a sail on the mast of a wheeledcart styled like a ship. Such a dress was a fitting gift for the patron goddessof a naval empire.At the foot of the steep Acropolis the pro cession halted. The peploswasremoved for the final ascent, and the decorated cart was left at the base ofthe hill. Since cows do not climb steps with ease, Athenians constructed apaved ramp parallel to the monumental stairs that ascended the Acropolis— a sort of ceremonial track for the animals to climb. When the pompereachedthe sanctuary at the top of the Acropolis, sacrifices were performed at amonumental altar near the main entrance to Athena’s temple. The interiorof any Greek temple was not a meeting place or a house of prayer; rather,it housed an image of the deity and contained storerooms for trea sure andvotive offerings, and for the tools and implements needed during the sacri-ficial rituals.The proper sacrifice of whole herds of cows required or ga ni za tion, ex-pertise, and precision.

The statue of the goddess was notdressed in its new robe at the Panathenaea; that ritual act was apparentlyreserved for a festival called the Plynteria ten months later, when womenfrom that same aristocratic family removed the adornments from the statueand washed it— probably in the sea. There were many images of Athenaon the Acropolis, especially after the artistic program put into place byPericles, and scholars are not sure which image was presented with the newpeplos.Several new statues were executed in the mid- fifth century, andthere was an old wooden statue of the armed Pallas Athena, but equallyimportant to the Athenians was an ancient wooden image said to be a crudeand a nearly featureless plank of wood, which was nonetheless venerated.Athena had many altars on the Acropolis in addition to the great altar.Judging from inscriptional sources, each celebration of the Panathenaeadevoted a great deal of time to sacrifices at the altars. Offerings were madeto all aspects of the patron goddess present in the shrines on the Acropo-lis: Athena Polias, Athena Nike, Athena Parthenos, and Athena Hygieia(Athena of the City, Athena of Victory, Athena the Maiden, and AthenaWho Preserves Health). The distribution of the sacrificial meats varied:portions from the offerings for Athena Hygieia were distributed mainly toimportant civic officials.

TheAthenians were proud of their customs. The frequency of their purchaseand distribution of meat set them apart from Greeks in other poleis;whilethe practice of thysiawas common to all Greeks, the Athenians were saidto finance more festivals and public banquets than any other polis.Somescholars have reckoned that as many as one- third of the days in the Athe-nian calendar included some sort of civic animal sacrifice, though surelyevery Athenian did not observe every festival. But as one aristocratic com-mentator noted in the late fifth century, Athens had an unusually largeathena58"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"number of festival days when the official business of the polisconductedin the ekklesiaand the law courts could not be held. In the fourth centurybefore the rise of Alexander, when Athenian democracy was still function-ing as it largely had during the fifth, corrupt demagogues occasionallycame to power and misused the funds set aside for sacrifice, celebratingpublic holidays and feasts with an extravagance that some aristocrats viewedas excessive.Of course the common citizens may have enjoyed the public banquetswith more relish than aristocrats who still recalled old- fashioned ways. Atan earlier time banquets for citizens had meant dining at a symposium inthe intimate company of a few of one’s social equals. The symposium wasan elite institution from an earlier, pre- democratic age; it was a customthat had transmitted traditional warrior values at a time when the aristoc-racy had little obligation to share power. The civic festivals of PericleanAthens distributed meat more equally among the masses of citizens, regard-less of birth, class, and social status. The poliseven built public dining roomsin common areas. A building called the South Stoa was completed in theAgora during the last quarter of the fifth century. This long porticoedstructure, which contained fifteen dining rooms with couches for as manyas 105 men, was built by the state to serve Athenian citizens who were spend-ing the day in the Agora. The Pompeion in the Kerameikos, constructed afew de cades later, also contained dining rooms with spaces for at least sixty- six men. On festival days men could use these spaces to dine together onsacrificial meat, and on business days they could use the rooms for meetings.Not every festival with sacrifices was a major holiday and a day off frompublic business; some festivals were certainly minor affairs, attended byonly a small fraction of the citizen body. Some demes held sacrificial ban-quets on days that were workdays for other demes. But even on businessdays when the courts and the assembly met, thysiawas still a visible part ofthe public proceedings. Stone altars where thysiawas performed were anecessary component in the design and construction of any public space,from the council building (Bouleuterion) and the law courts to theatersand athletic stadiums. Every polismeeting opened with offerings andprayers to the gods, with libations of wine and the sacrifice of an animal atan altar. Priests performed the bloody sacrifice of an animal on the battle-field before battle in a rite known as sphagia,and seers carefully inspectedthe entrails.

Here words ofprayer accompanied a stream of wine that spilled to the ground as the par-ties involved called upon the gods to witness their intentions. Athenianlaws published on wood and stone stelaiand placed in the Agora or else-where opened with formulaic phrases stating that the gods sanctioned thedeliberations of the assembly and the ordinances passed. Hundreds ofthese Athenian laws inscribed on stelaiare extant, and a surprisingly largenumber of them record the minutiae of how the Athenians publicly fi-nanced the banquets and festival that constituted the civic calendar.Public dining rooms were a standard feature in the landscape of fifth- century Athens, but civic festivals and the public banquets that followed were not the only occasion for publicly financed meals. One civic buildingdeserves par tic u lar notice: the Tholos, located near the Agora. Regulardining at public expense in the Tholos had a po liti cal function in Athensat least since the reforms of Cleisthenes. During its tribe’s turn at polisad-ministration, each group of fifty citizen prytaneiswas fed at public expensefor a month in the Tholos. We do not know the precise menu that wasserved in the public dining rooms, but meat from the civic sacrifices per-formed daily could well have turned up there when it was available. Otherpublic officials and guests of the polisalso ate either in the Tholos or an-other public dining hall called the Prytaneion; these diners included thehandful of citizens who were honored by the poliswith the privilege ofpermanent maintenance at public expense, or sitesis.One of the reasonsSocrates so angered the jury of fellow Athenians at his trial in 399 is thathe apparently asked not only to be found innocent of the charges filedagainst him but even to be granted this unusual honor of public mainte-nance in the Prytaneion for the remainder of his life.Participating in thysiaand in the public banqueting that took place af-terward was one of the central ways in which male citizens formed andvalidated their identity as citizens. A citizen in this democracy was some-one with whom other citizens sacrificed and dined. Although public recordkeeping was a regular part of Athenian civic life by the mid- fifth century,no central bureau yet existed where citizens could go to register themselveswhen they came of age. There is some evidence that lists of citizens toserve in the military were drawn up, but we know of no written rec ords forbirth or marriage, no voter lists, and no death certificates beyond the epi-taphs in the Kerameikos cemetery. Instead of centralized written rec ordsAthenians relied on their memories of who attended polisfestivals andpublic banquets— who worshipped the gods of the city alongside otherathena60"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"citizens. Eusebeiawas tied to active participation in civic groups. Anyonewho did not participate was an idiftes,a completely isolated private indi-vidual (hence our word “idiot”).Citizens in Athenian cultic democracy came of age and were socializedinto their demes and phratries, where each man was known by familymembers and peers. Not only were fellow demesmen well acquainted witheach other and often related through blood and marriage, but they alsoknew the networks of families and could name each other’s grandparentsand grandsons. When a citizen needed to prove his identity in court,should his citizen status come into question, he called witnesses from hisdeme and phratry to vouch for his presence at civic sacrifices and ban-quets. When a defendant wanted to establish in a court of law who hisblood kin were, he called witnesses from his family who swore that overthe years the defendant had sacrificed to the gods in the presence of otherfamily members at both major and minor civic festivals. An Athenian juryconsidered such testimony adequate proof of identity and citizen status.Even Plato and Aristotle, in their theorizing about how to form and man-age the ideal state, included thysiaand the subsequent public banquetingas the backbone of their societies. Both phi los o phers claimed that the cus-toms surrounding thysiaprovided occasions for fellowship, and for courtshipleading to marriage. These ancestral customs surrounding festivals andpublic banquets, ta patria,provided the foundation for important bonds andnetworks of families. Thysiaand the communal meals were not simplybeneficial to the polis,nor were they excuses for merriment. They were, infact, completely necessary for Athens to function.And yet the custom of thysiawas not fully egalitarian in this demo craticsociety, because significant portions of the population were excluded. Themale citizen body constituted perhaps one- quarter of the residential popu-lation of Attica. Respectable wives reclined on couches only at their wed-ding, and they never dined in the public dining rooms. Women had no placein the governing demo cratic institutions, and although citizen women ofall ages did perform significant cultic functions in the polisit is unclearwhether they took part in the civic banquets alongside men. There is someevidence that women, even women of the upper classes, suffered frommalnutrition. Slaves were not citizens at all, even after they gained theirfreedom, and in fifth- century Athens there was an additional group ofnoncitizens who were excluded from the civic functions of cultic democ-racy.

Phi los o phers such as Xenophanes and Heraclitus criticizedtraditional customs common to all Greeks that recognized the power ofblood pollution and the necessity of sacrifice to please the gods. Traditionhas it that Pythagoras’s theory of the transmigration of souls kept him andothers from eating meat. But true vegetarianism was rare, because reject-ing meat necessarily meant rejecting the polisand the cult of animal sacri-fice that bound citizens together.

Since they did not dine withtheir peers and exhibit recognizably pious civic behaviors, they were con-sidered po liti cally and socially suspect.Eusebeia,or public piety, in the cities of ancient Greece was not a mat-ter of belief or superstition. A pious citizen in Athens was not a meek andhumble man who submitted to the will of the gods; nor was he a cautiousand superstitious one who observed every festival and every ritual down tothe last detail. Ritual practice was so thoroughly integrated into po liti caland social life that a pious citizen was a man who took his civic responsi-bilities seriously. He participated in public life and civic rites alongside hiscitizen peers.

While Pericles was only one of many who advanced theempire, he was the acknowledged leader of those Athenians who voted tosupport the changes in the city’s communal and religious life.west meets east in a fiery templeThe roots of the Athenian empire stretch back into the Archaic period,well before Pericles and Cleisthenes. This first empire in classical Hellasunfolded in response both to internal pressures within the polisof Athensand to the changing po liti cal circumstances of those poleisthat Athens feltspecial cultural and po liti cal connections to. Since at least the eighth cen-tury, the Greeks living alongside the sea had been on the move, leaving themainland of Greece and sailing east and south across the Aegean Sea. Asthey explored they established trading posts and settlements in the Aegeanislands and along the east coast of the Mediterranean. Greek cities couldbe found as far south as the modern- day border between Turkey andSyria. Greeks also sailed west and expanded into Sicily and southern Italy.One of the waves of settlers were the Ionians, an extended group whospoke a common dialect, or ga nized their communities around the fourrecognized ancient tribes, and celebrated a common set of annual religiousfestivals. The Athenians were traditionally understood to be the commonancestor of the Ionians; this supposition is probably not entirely accurate,but over the years a shared religious and cultural heritage reinforced theconviction.

Ionians were not the only ones settling across the Aegean: DorianGreeks from the southern parts of Hellas also settled in the islands andalong the eastern edge of the Mediterranean coast. Dorians spoke a differ-ent dialect of the Greek language, and celebrated a calendar of festivalsdistinct from the Ionians’. Newly founded Dorian and Ionian communi-ties brought Greek customs and language to non- Greek lands, and theymaintained close po liti cal and religious ties with their relatives across thesea in Hellas.Cultural transmission is a two- way street, and throughout Ionia and theeastern Mediterranean Greek settlers and traders mixed with many differ-ent ethnic peoples who shared their own knowledge and customs. These non- Greek peoples became known as “barbarians,” or barbaroi,a Greekword coined to describe all those who did not speak Greek but utteredsome combination of indecipherable sounds that struck the Greek ear as nonsense—“bar... bar... bar.” The most consequential of these barbar-ians lay to the east and south of Hellas: the Lydians and Carians, both Indo- European peoples who inhabited coastal Asia Minor; the Phoeniciansand other Semitic- speaking peoples along the Mediterranean coast to thesouth of Caria in present- day Lebanon, Syria, and Israel; and the Egyptiansalong the Nile River and its delta in North Africa. One ancient text fromthis region relates how Ionian Greeks were known to a certain Semiticpeople who dwelled in the inland regions east of the coastal Phoenicians.The ancient Israelites in the book of Genesis called the Greeks the Javan, or Iawan— the Hebraicized spelling of “Ionian.”One of the benefits of trade in the Mediterranean basin was the robustexchange of cultures. Ancient Greece and the subsequent Western traditioncould not have developed as they did without the influence of the easternpeoples called barbarians. Indeed, the Greeks in the eighth and seventhcenturies borrowed the alphabet of the Phoenicians, the coastal cousins ofthe more nomadic and pastoral Israelites. Early Semitic scripts containedaround twenty- two symbols representing the sounds of consonants. Thissystem contained no vowels, which were filled in by the reader as he wentalong. When Greeks adapted the Phoenicians’ alphabet for their owntongue, they introduced written vowels into the script by assigning vowelsounds to the Semitic consonantal symbols that the Greek language did notneed.

Hepatoscopy, or interpreting the lobes of asheep’s liver, was one of the most common prophetic customs practiced byseers in the east, and it played a role as well in the civic rituals of thysiainarchaic and classical Athens.Much further inland and east of the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Lydianslived the Persians, who inhabited what to the ancient Greeks constituted Asiaproper. The heart of the region known then as ancient Persia is today calledIran. While Athens was experiencing shifts between aristocratic regimes,tyrannies, and emerging democracy, the Persians were amassing one of thelargest empires the world had yet seen, one that straddled three continentsand stretched from the Indus River through Mesopotamia and all the way tothe eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. As Persia loomed in the east,Greek poleis were constantly struggling to maintain stability both at homeand abroad. Border wars and struggles for influence within Hellas broughtabout shifting alliances that often came into conflict with each other. The re-sult for fifth- century Greece was two periods of protracted warfare: the Per-sian Wars and the Peloponnesian War. During these two conflicts Greeks be-came sensitive to perceived differences in ethnic background as manifest indialect and religious custom, especially those identified by the ethnic labels“Ionian” and “Dorian.” In Athens traditional Ionian festivals that honoredApollo and Athena took on new social and po liti cal meanings, and civic ritesthemselves changed over time.These po liti cal conflicts and cultic changes had their roots in earlier genera-tions, when the mainland Greeks kept close contact with their cousins in theAegean and along the Ionian coast. The po liti cal fortunes of Ionian Greeks de-pended on developments in the kingdoms immediately surrounding them. Asa result, some Ionian Greek poleisin the sixth century came to be governed byforeign kings. Not all these kings were oppressive— indeed, some broughtabout positive changes for their subjects. The Lydian king Croesus is the firstruler known to have adopted a monetary system that minted coins for use intrade. The institution of coinage in the early sixth century helped bring greatwealth to Lydia and Ionia, and it facilitated the development of an interna-tional trade economy in the eastern Mediterranean. The Athenian tyrant Pisi-stratus is credited with introducing the first metal coinage in Athens around550 (not long after the Lydians’ innovation among the Ionians).In the mid- sixth century the Lydian kingdom of Croesus was overpow-ered by the growing Persian Empire, and Ionian Greeks became subjectspericles66"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"of the Persian king Cyrus the Great. The Persian mode of imperial ad-ministration relied on regional governors called satraps who oversaw themanagement of local cities and kingdoms, which were themselves gov-erned by client- kings and tyrants. In this way most of the Greek poleisinIonia came to be governed by native tyrants who answered to satraps andthe Great King of Persia. In time Greeks began to chafe under foreign rule.Ionian Greek re sis tance increased as the ambitions of the Persian Empireexpanded; stiffer taxes were levied against the Ionian cities and greaternumbers of ethnic Greeks were conscripted into the Persian army. TheAegean island of Naxos resisted Persia from the start, and Miletus, the mostprosperous of the Ionian cities along the Asia Minor coast, found Persianrule especially oppressive. In 499 some Ionian cities followed the lead ofMiletus and revolted against the Persian Empire. When they did rise upagainst the barbarian Great King, the Ionians of Miletus asked their rela-tions on the Greek mainland for assistance. The Athenians willingly pro-vided twenty ships and a moderate- sized force. It was not yet ten yearssince the reforms of Cleisthenes.This revolt in Ionia marks the first official meeting of Athens and Persia,and it was a memorable one that brought together religion and interna-tional politics. In 498 an Athenian contingent of soldiers fought alongsideIonians at Sardis, the capital of the Persian province of Lydia. In the midstof battle the Athenians sacked and burned the city. A temple of the nativegoddess Cybele went up in flames in the conflagration, a temple that wassacred to the resident Lydians and protected by the ruling Persians. De-stroying the enemy’s sanctuaries was an accepted tactic to demonstratemilitary and cultural superiority, and Athenians did not shrink from it.The Persian king Darius was so enraged at the act of impiety that he re-portedly assigned a slave the task of reminding him of the sacrilege. Threetimes a day— whenever the Great King sat down to eat a meal— the slaverepeated, “Master, remember the Athenians.” The victory in Sardis led tofurther campaigns in Asia Minor, but in the end the Persians put down therevolt once and for all with the destruction of Miletus in 494.This anecdote about Darius and his slave was recorded by the historianHerodotus (5.105), himself a Greek from Halicarnassus, a Greek city locatedin Caria on the southern coast of Asia Minor. Herodotus’s history of thePersian Wars stands as the oldest surviving example of Greek narrative his-tory. Considered the father of history, Herodotus is the first author knownto use the word historia,which means in Greek something close to “re-searches,” or “reports of eyewitness accounts.” His nine- book account of theempire and war in the city of athena67"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Persian Wars was published in the last quarter of the fifth century, and itreaches back to the sixth- century background of the conflict between Persiaand Greece. It also includes countless interesting ethnographic details fromhis inquiries and travels throughout the then- known world. Herodotus’s his-tory maintains throughout a strong moral perspective that warns his audi-ence of the dangers of unchecked pride, or hubris:in his worldview, divineretribution, or nemesis,is inevitable if man reaches beyond the limits that theimmortal gods have set. Some of this moralizing is conveyed in anecdotesabout Persian rulers from the more distant past, but the message aboutnemesiswas perhaps also addressed to the Greeks of the late fifth century— especially Athenians— who were similarly faced with the issues that accom-pany building and maintaining an empire.Herodotus directed his research toward the origins of empire in the past,and he related how the Persian Empire began in the sixth century in the gen-erations leading up to Darius I. This empire was centered in the capital citiesof Persepolis and Susa, and as it grew it reached as far as the Indus valley ofPakistan and India, while to the west and south it encompassed modern- dayIraq, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. To the north the PersianEmpire stretched up and around the Black Sea— though here nomadicScythians stubbornly eluded its grasp. The far western frontier from the Per-sians’ perspective comprised Ionia, the islands of the Aegean Sea, and main-land Greece. These Greeks in the sixth century were not particularly wealthyor powerful. The Persians may well have considered them less- developed,poor inhabitants of a remote backwater of the Mediterranean basin. Afterquelling the Ionian revolt with the destruction of Miletus in 494, Persia mayhave assumed that Hellas would be easily absorbed into its empire. And yetthat initial encounter between the Persians and the Athenians— the Athe-nian destruction of a temple at Sardis that proved so memorable for theGreat King— resulted in the greatest of surprises for the Persians.

The lattersoon became pressing with the reappearance of the former Athenian tyrantHippias.

Clearly the Great King intended tomake Athens subject to Persia just as the poleisin Ionia were subject totyrants and satraps. Perhaps Darius hoped Athenians would welcome Hip-pias back to power as tyrant rather than suffer the loss of Athenian lives onthe battlefield and the possible destruction of their homeland. The Atheni-ans were willing to face the risk. When the Persians were defeated in Atticaat the plain of Marathon, it was an army of Athenians and Plataeans thatbeat them back to their ships in retreat. The Athenians, fighting on theirhome territory, bore the brunt of the casualties.Darius died before he could launch a second invasion, but his successor tothe throne had an equally good memory of the Athenians’ impiety at Cy-bele’s temple in Sardis. Darius’s son Xerxes came to power in 486, and as thenew Great King of the Persian Empire Xerxes started planning a secondattack against Hellas. Meanwhile, with the memory of the Persians atMarathon still fresh among the Athenians, one Athenian general saw an op-portunity to shape the direction of Athens’ future. When the silver mines atLaurium produced a sizable surplus for the state coffers, the Athenian demosfound itself confronting significant financial decisions. The typical proce-dure was to share the wealth equally among all citizens, but in 483/2 a gen-eral named Themistocles persuaded the Athenian demosto move in a newdirection. Themistocles urged the demosto build some 200 triremes and be-come a naval power. The Athenians in the ekklesiafound Themistocles’ in-novative ideas persuasive, and they voted to follow his proposal.The Athenians’ decision to apply the funds from the silver mines to theconstruction of a navy stands in contrast to the Great King’s attitudetoward the natural world. When Xerxes launched an invasion that includedboth land and naval forces, he was faced with engineering challenges un-known to his father. The inclusion of major land forces required the Per-sians to build a bridge across the Hellespont, the narrow straits that sepa-rate Asia from Eu rope where the Black Sea empties into the Mediterranean.Throughout antiquity this floating bridge was remembered as a miracu-lous feat of human engineering and, in a famous story recorded byHerodotus, it also revealed the Great King’s tendency for hubris.Whenthe first attempt to bridge the Hellespont failed in a storm, Xerxes insistedon his mastery of the passage between Eu rope and Asia: he declared thatempire and war in the city of athena69"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"the straits were his slave.

Herodotus reports that Xerxeseven ordered his men to curse the straits, and instruct the waters that sinceno man worshipped them they would bend to the Great King’s will(Herodotus 7.33–35). Though the anecdote may well be a fabrication, itdoes reveal to us the Greek imagination: the words and actions of an arro-gant barbarian tyrant run counter to accepted Greek mores surroundingthe gods, the natural world, and the po liti cal world of humans. WhileXerxes cursed the waters and asserted his dominance, the Athenians usedthe resources of Attica to defend themselves and their gods.Xerxes’ assertion of his will at the Hellespont soon brought foreigndomination and Persian religious customs to the doorstep of mainlandGreece. After another structure was engineered (a floating bridge thatused cables to lash together boats and pontoons), Xerxes led the Persianarmy into Eu rope, entering Hellas from the north in the spring of 480.Reports spread that massive Persian land forces had crossed the Hellespontand were marching south into Greece through Thrace and Macedonia.Polisafter polisin the north immediately capitulated in the face of theoverwhelming foreign army; these Greek cities negotiated treaties with thePersians, offering up earth and water to the invaders in a sign of subservienceto the Great King. The treatment of this Persian rite in Herodotus clearlylinks international politics and the public cult of the gods: with a singleritual action, Greek civic leaders admitted the foreign army and foreigngods into their poleis.The voluntary collaboration became known as“medizing,” a word derived from the Medes, a northern Persian tribe.Spartans and Athenians watched with anxiety as more poleismedized andit became increasingly apparent that they would soon be battling the Per-sians somewhere on their home territory.

Located in the territory of Phocis just northwest of Attica,Delphi was one of the most important of the panhellenic shrines. Everyfour years the Pythian games were held there, but the most significant ac-tivities at Delphi centered on the prophetic powers associated with Apollo.Since at least the sixth century it had been a custom for Greek poleistosend ambassadors to Delphi to ask questions of Apollo’s oracle in the remote,rural shrine on a steep mountainside. Delphi actually lies at the intersec-tion of several geologic faults, and abundant seismic activity in the area(earthquakes, vapors escaping from the earth) may have given rise to a tra-dition that Delphi was connected to unseen powers below the earth’s sur-face. In myth Delphi was considered the center of the world— a specialrock called the omphalos,or navel, stood there. A temple of Apollo wasconstructed at Delphi in the seventh century, but evidence for shrines anddedications in this location stretch back to at least the ninth century.The Delphic oracle gave thousands of responses over the centuries toboth states and individuals— for example, directing poleiswhen theywished to establish foreign colonies or go to war, and helping individualsin matters of cultic observance and ritual purity. The shrine was also aplace where Greeks, whether individual citizens offering thanks for per-sonal good fortune or cities celebrating victory in war, came to give thanksto the gods and make commemorative offerings. Whoever consulted theoracle left gifts for the god— often quite lavish ones— and poleisbuilt elab-orate trea suries to store the dedications. Just as individual athletes com-peted for glory on the field every four years, so each polisvied with othersin the splendor of their building projects at this panhellenic shrine. Promi-nent wealthy families served as sponsors; in the sixth century the Alcmaeonidfamily had a history of financing building projects at Delphi. A commit-tee composed of members from all over Hellas called the Amphictionyoversaw the running of the sanctuary, and the Amphictiony had the au-thority to punish a polisfor offending Apollo: it could either fine the cityor declare a “sacred war.” When disciplining a polis,the Amphictiony usedthe language of religious offense and cultic impurity. These religious con-cepts indicated something much more complex than simple superstition:language of offense and impiety expressed whether a poliswas treating itscitizens and its neighbors with all due respect in accordance with ancestralnorms and nomoi.This ability to oversee and comment on how poleistreatedeach other gave Delphi an unusually powerful panhellenic voice, and onethat was not necessarily free from bias or corruption.empire and war in the city of athena71"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"In fifth- century practice the inquirer making a pilgrimage to Delphi pu-rified himself with holy water before entering the temple of Apollo.

He could then proceed from the sacrificial altar into the in-ner recesses, where he consulted with male priests and attendants of Apollowho framed the question put forward to the female ritual specialist calledthe Pythia. The Pythia was Apollo’s instrument— a priestess who tradition-ally sat on a special seat in a hidden corner of the sanctuary. She possessedthe unusual ability to communicate directly with the god, and some schol-ars think that she fell into some sort of a trance state, perhaps after chewingspecial leaves or inhaling fumes that emanated from cracks in the earth.The Pythia was believed to be possessed by the god, and her utterances were understood to be the response of Apollo himself, relayed perhaps firstin gibberish and then in a highly stylized, versified form of poetic speechthat was often quite ambiguous. The male attendants recorded the Pythia’sutterances, and the pilgrim’s task was to consult with Apollo’s officials,male and female alike, who helped him make sense of the images and po-etic figures in the god’s response.

The am-bassadors took hope in these words, and they returned home. Back in Athensthe Athenians debated the meaning of the curious wooden wall. Some menbelieved they should defend the Acropolis behind strengthened woodenfortification walls. But at this key moment, Themistocles stepped in. The tra-ditional civic rites of the Athenians granted all male citizens the right to offi-ciate at sacrificial procedures and interpret oracles and omens from the gods;Herodotus relates how Themistocles, contrary to the professional oracle in-terpreters, argued that the “wooden walls” were the sides of the ships inAthens’ brand- new navy, and “divine Salamis” was the place where the deci-sive naval battle should take place.

And so the city of Athens fell to theGreat King of Persia. In this way Darius’s son Xerxes finally rememberedthe Athenians and got revenge for the Athenians’ burning of Sardis almosttwenty years earlier. Yet Xerxes’ first official order as ruler of Athens revealsan uneasy conscience attuned to the vicissitudes of civic impiety. A smallgroup of Athenian exiles were advising him on this campaign, and Xerxesordered these exiles to ascend the Acropolis and offer sacrifices according toAthenian nomoi(Herodotus 8.49–55). Even under the rule of Persian occu-piers, Athenian citizens observed the civic rites of their city.Although they had followed Delphi’s advice by abandoning the city, re-moving all the city’s residents, and placing all hope in the wooden walls oftheir navy, the Athenians’ chances for victory over the Persians were stillnot good. The Persian fleet far outnumbered the Greek. The Athenians puttheir new ships under command of the best and most experienced generals,including ostracized men recalled from exile. A Spartan general com-manded the whole contingent. The Greek allies hesitated at this moment,unable to decide where to fight the Persians— in the open sea near Corinthor in the narrow passage between the island of Salamis and the mainland ofAttica. While the allied Greeks vacillated, Persian commanders broughttheir ships down near Athens. Xerxes was so sure of his impending victorythat, tradition has it, he pitched a camp on the slope of an adjoining moun-tainside that could provide the best view of the naval battle as it unfolded.But his hopes were dashed at Salamis when the Greeks were able to outma-neuver the Persians by relying on their familiarity with the narrow watersand unseen currents. The Persian naval forces were soundly defeated. Xerxeswithdrew to Asia Minor, leaving his cousin and brother- in- law Mardoniusin command of the Persian forces now stationed in Thebes, northwest ofAthens. The Athenians returned to their devastated city and prepared forthe land engagement they knew would come.The final outcome of the war was decided the following year in a contestat Plataea, a plain just northwest of Athens. Under Mardonius the Persianshad negotiated favorable terms with some Greek cities, offering protectionin return for collaboration. Those cities in Boeotia that medized and ac-cepted the Persian offer were spared destruction at the hands of the rampag-ing Persian forces. But Boeotia’s neighbor to the south, Attica, again did notaccept any Persian offer to cooperate, and as a result the villages and farmsof Attica were invaded by the foreign army for a second time.

For the second time the Athenians abandoned their homes in the cityand fled to neighboring islands while their leaders prepared for a final, deci-sive land battle. Mardonius and the Persians continued their march throughAttica and they utterly destroyed Athens again (Herodotus 9.3). But al-though the Persians may have won another battle at Athens, in the end theystill lost the war. When the Persian army finally engaged the combinedGreek forces at Plataea in 479, they were defeated. The renowned Persiangeneral Mardonius fell in this battle along with many of his men.At the end of the war the urban center of Athens was largely destroyed.One historian rec ords that the only houses that remained standing wereones that Persian commanders had lived in during the occupation. Only asmall portion of the great Persian army was left to retreat from Greece af-ter the battle of Plataea. Thereafter the Greeks lived with the knowledgethat the Persians could regroup and again invade their homeland in orderto impose a Persian imperial structure upon the autonomous poleisof Hel-las. Perhaps the Greeks feared this. The Athenians may have felt an anxi-ety sharpened by experience— after all, they had seen their city destroyedtwice, while the Spartans and their Peloponnesian allies remained rela-tively safe behind the Isthmus of Corinth. In retrospect we can see thatsuch fear of a third Persian invasion was ungrounded, but for the fifth- century Greeks it must have been very real.At the same time the Greek peoples felt a new confidence that was rein-forced by their common ritual background. The Greek poleishad alwaysbeen divided to some degree by geography, customs, and dialect. Before thearrival of the Persians, there had been little common understanding of whatit meant to be Greek. There had been no Greek po liti cal identity, eventhough the Greeks all shared cultural, religious and literary traditions. Butafter a few small, autonomous Greek poleisunited to defeat a mighty barbar-ian empire from the east, suddenly a different self- awareness came to thefore. Later traditions report that the allied Greeks took a common oathbefore the crucial battle of Plataea, and swore they would not rebuildshrines and holy places destroyed by the invading Persians (Lycurgus AgainstLeocrates81). Overall the Greeks became more conscious of their desire forfreedom and autonomy, and of their commitment to their nomoi— bothcivil laws and religious customs. Despite regional differences in traditionalrituals, there was agreement about one thing: Greek nomoidid not allow forservile obedience to a mortal king. Persian custom demanded proskynesis,empire and war in the city of athena75"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"full prostration on one’s knees before the Great King. Following the lead ofAthens and Sparta, the poleisof Hellas declared that they would serve onlytheir ancestral gods in accordance with their nomoi.This new self- awareness convinced the Greeks that their way of life hadto be defended in the face of a barbarian empire. They accordingly main-tained an alliance after the victory at Plataea, and the Spartans were placedat the head of this confederation. The avowed goal was retribution for therecent war, but some on the mainland wished to regain territory and poleisthat had fallen under Persian domination, especially cities across theAegean Sea in Ionia. There may have been some hope that a continuing al-liance would create a deterrent; if a confederation of poleiscould unite andbeat back the Persian Empire, then perhaps in the future the Great Kingwould let them all be free and treat them as po liti cal and cultural equals.The Greek confederation pursued the Persians into Asia Minor to supportpoleisthere that were still under Persian rule.Although the city of Athens lay shattered, Athenian citizens showedgreat resilience and they immediately busied themselves rebuilding theircity. Themistocles, whose vision of the city as a naval power had proven sosuccessful, persuaded the Athenians in 479 to rebuild the walls and fortifythe city center and harbor even before rebuilding their homes and temples.This activity made the Spartans suspicious, especially when viewed in thecontext of the Athenians’ commitment to their new navy and the continu-ing alliance. Following naval campaigns in the Aegean and Ionia in 478,Sparta handed the leadership of the confederation over to Athens. Mod-ern historians call this naval alliance under Athenian leadership the DelianLeague. The name reflects the establishment of an administrative centerfor the alliance on Delos, an island sanctuary in the middle of the AegeanSea that was sacred to the god Apollo. Meanwhile Sparta did its best topersuade Themistocles and the Athenians to take down the walls and relyon the promise of Spartan military strength in the event of another for-eign invasion. But the Athenians looked at their city that lay in ruins anddecided otherwise.

Afterpericles76"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"all, Darius’s defeat at Marathon in 490 did not stop the second invasionundertaken by his son Xerxes in 480. The Athenians had no way of know-ing that in fact the Persians would not invade again. As the Greeks poleisanticipated another invasion from the east and deepened their commit-ment to their Hellenic alliance, other unforeseen issues emerged. The Hel-lenic allies soon found themselves facing not a continuation of the strugglewith barbarians from the east but a more protracted and painful series ofregional tensions and open conflicts among the Greek poleisthemselves.At first these struggles manifested themselves in leadership issues amongthe members of the alliance that had fought off Persia. After Athens as-sumed a leadership role the Delian League met with success, especially inIonia and the Aegean. And while the alliance was initially formed in re-sponse to a perceived Persian threat, the new Delian League soon took aninterest in policing the shipping lanes around the Hellespont that broughtgrain and timber to Athens’ main port of Piraeus. Grain and timber im-ports were needed to rebuild the Athenian economy— timber for shipbuild-ing, and grain to feed the growing population of urban workers. Athenswas also eager to control other natural resources that its allies could supply,like the precious metals mined on Thasos, a wealthy island in the northernAegean along the trade routes leading to the Black Sea.The island of Delos became a focal point for the cities that followedAthens. For several centuries Delos had been recognized as an importantcult site for the Ionian Greeks, whether they lived on the mainland, in theAegean islands, or on the Ionian coastline of Asia Minor. Whole familieswent to Delos together— women and children along with the men. An an-nual festival to Apollo was celebrated there, complete with feasting,singing, dancing, and musical and athletic competitions. Even women andgirls competed for prizes in traditional dances, and singers came from allover the Aegean to vie with each other in the recitation of traditional oralverse. But Sparta was a Dorian community and not an Ionian one, and thedecision to or ga nize the league around an Ionian festival site on Delos un-derscored a new orientation for the alliance that quite consciously margin-alized Sparta and other poleisthat did not observe Ionian rites and reli-gious festivals. Because leadership was transferred from a Dorian to anIonian polis,Sparta withdrew from the league’s naval interests.The creation of a Delian League under Athenian leadership and the dis-solution of the Spartan- led alliance eventually prompted the re- formationof an earlier confederation of Hellenic states, many from the Pelopon-nesian Peninsula. Historians today sometimes call this alliance headed byempire and war in the city of athena77"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Sparta the Peloponnesian League. The coexistence of two competing al-liances headed by the two most powerful Greek poleisled in turn to thepolarization of many other Greek states. Over time it became nearly im-possible for in de pen dent poleisto maintain neutrality, and every state wasforced to choose sides: an alliance headed by Athens or an alliance headedby Sparta. The choice was not always clear.Unlike previous co ali tions the Delian League was primarily a naval al-liance that required major capital investments of ships and money. Thetraditional Greek army was made up of self- supporting hoplites who pro-vided their own armor and sometimes even their own food. The reestab-lished Peloponnesian League continued to operate this way. But the newnaval alliance headed by Athens required ships, men to power the ships,and resources to provision and support the men aboard the ships. TheDelian League required each member polisto supply either a complementof fully manned and seaworthy ships, in proportion to its size and wealth,or an annual contribution to the trea sury that maintained the allied navy.Athens had the most ships by far, and only a small fraction of the alliance members— Samos, Lesbos, and Chios— had the wealth and manpower tosupply numerous ships and men, so most members came to Delos withcash. This annual tax was called tribute or phoros,and the trea sur ers whoadministered the tributary funds for the league at the trea sury on Delos were always Athenian.The naval league centered on Delos was conceived as an alliance thatwould confront the Persians, and members may have considered their trib-ute an investment that would soon bring them greater returns when thePersians were pushed out of Ionia and alliance members brought home thespoils of war. The Persian Empire was wealthy, and the potential spoilswould have been almost beyond reckoning from a Greek’s perspective. Asthe Delian League pursued this policy, some commanders in fact did ac-quire great wealth during these years— above all the Athenian statesmanand naval commander Cimon. It was Cimon who led the allied Ionianpoleisto a double victory over Persian land and naval forces in 466 at Eu-rymedon, on the southern coast of Asia Minor. This engagement momen-tarily put a stop to the Persians’ designs on the Ionian cities of the Aegeanand Asia Minor.Even with the Persian threat suppressed, the Delian League remainedunder the compulsion of Athenian leadership. Athens managed the al-liance’s finances, and Athens became rather exacting in its demands and inthe unity it forced on the allies.

Subject- allies could be compelled to remain in the em-pire and contribute their phoros— even against their will.

In 465 the citizens of Thasosresisted Athens’ takeover of their metal and timber resources, and theytried to back out from the Delian League and renounce their annual con-tribution of phoros.The Athenian response to this re sis tance was immedi-ate. The navy, under the leadership of Cimon, laid siege to the city ofThasos. More than two years later, the Thasians were finally subdued andforcibly brought back into the league. Such costly expenditures of time,resources, and manpower did not hamper the Athenians in maintainingtheir authority. The revolt at Thasos in 465 and the Athenian response toit would be repeated many times over the course of the next five de cadesas members of the Delian League had to be coerced into remaining in— oreven joining— the imperial alliance. Any re sis tance, much less open revolt,brought on penalties that grew ever harsher over time.The aristocratic general Cimon led the Athenians and the Delian Leagueduring 470s and 460s, and it was Cimon as much as anyone else who laidthe foundations for an Athenian empire. The son of another famous general— Miltiades, an Athenian commander at Marathon— Cimon hadfirst achieved fame as a young man for his courage at the battle of Salamis.After this battle the Athenian demosoften elected him strategos;he com-manded most of the major operations for the Delian League between 476and 463, and brought back to Athens great wealth from the spoils of war inthe Aegean and Ionia. During his career he opposed policies that gave newpowers to the demos,while supporting the interests of the Athenian nobil-ity through his family connections with Sparta. At the same time Cimonproved to be a friend of the Athenian people: he sponsored costly state feastsfor them. He was an aristocrat who understood the value of civic rites thatbenefited the polis.Cimon made a significant contribution to Athenian cult practice at thevery start of his career: around 475 he helped institute the civic worship ofTheseus in Athens. The Athenians were at a bit of a loss after consultingApollo at Delphi and learning they should recover the bones of Theseus, themythical hero credited with the unification of Attica. How could they pos-sibly rediscover bones of a long- lost king mysteriously murdered while inexile, hundreds of years before?

While on the island of Scyros he was inspired to fol-low the lead of an ea gle who led him directly to the grave of Theseus, andwhen Cimon returned home from his first naval campaign in triumph hebrought with him Theseus’s remains. Cimon reportedly paraded into thecity with great pomp and ceremony, and the Athenians feasted and cele-brated at the foot of the Acropolis, where they dedicated a new sanctuary tothe hero who would in time be viewed as the paradigmatic Athenian leaderwhose success in uniting Attica and defending it from invading barbariansprepared the way for later Athenian democracy.Indeed, images of Theseus proliferated in Athens during the fifth cen-tury, and sometimes these images were linked to the family of Cimon.When the Athenians built an expensive new portico in the Agora early inthe 460s— the Stoa Poikile, or Painted Stoa— two of the main panels de-picted the Athenians’ victory over invading barbarians. The first showedTheseus leading the fight against the Amazons, and the second showed theAthenians battling the Persians at Marathon in 490. Cimon’s father Milti-ades had served as general in this famous engagement, and a traditionarose that Theseus returned from the underworld and appeared on thebattlefield to lead Miltiades and the Athenians in their fight for freedom.It is entirely possible that this stoa was built using funds brought back toAthens by Cimon after his campaigns in Asia Minor. When Cimon re-turned the bones of Theseus to Athens and instituted new festivals andcivic rites for the hero, he did not let the Athenian demosforget that anaristocrat like him was pursuing a policy of empire in an effort to keepAthenians free.

Pericles, a young adult at this time, would later becomea talented general in his own right. If this anecdote from Herodotus aboutXanthippus and the cables from Xerxes’ bridge at the Hellespont is at allaccurate, it would appear that Pericles at an early age learned about thecomplex and invaluable ties between the polis,its navy, and public expres-sions of civic piety in Athens.Pericles the son of Xanthippus came from two old and noble Athenianfamilies. It was his mother, Agariste, who was born into the family of theAlcmaeonidae. Agariste’s father, Hippocrates, was the brother of Cleis-thenes, thus making Cleisthenes the great- uncle of Pericles. Althoughfamily lines of descent in ancient Athens were not typically traced throughthe maternal line, sources consistently show that Pericles was still consid-ered one of the Alcmaeonidae tainted by that family’s curse. In momentsof civic doubt the language of civic piety and impiety, benefit and curse,clearly articulated the citizens’ awareness of po liti cal forces that linked thepresent to the past. As the symbolic heir to Cleisthenes, Pericles would intime carry on the tradition of po liti cal reforms that gave increasing po liti -cal voice to the Athenian demos,even at the expense of traditional aristo-cratic institutions. He and the Athenians would also be reminded of thecurse.We don’t know exactly how long Pericles’ father Xanthippus lived afterthe Persian Wars, but he was no longer active in 472 when Pericles madehis first appearance in Athenian public life. Then in his early 20s, Pericleshad the wealth, authority and confidence to take on the responsibility offunding a civic religious celebration for his fellow citizens. This type ofpublic ser vice was called a liturgy— from the Greek leitourgia,“work forthe people.” It was the custom in Athens for wealthy nobles to vie witheach other in sponsoring civic rites and religious festivals for the gods. Inthis case Pericles dipped into his own family’s wealth and produced a tril-ogy of plays by Aeschylus at one of Athens’ annual festivals of Dionysus.One of the plays Pericles produced was a tragedy about Xerxes’ upset atSalamis called the Persians— told from the point of view of the defeatedPersians themselves. This play is one of the few Aeschylean tragedies ex-tant, and it is the single example from the thirty- three remaining Atheniantragedies that actually treats a historical subject— the rest all center oncharacters and episodes from the Greek mythological tradition.The successful production of Aeschylus’s Persiansdemonstrates theAthenians’ continued deep interest in Persia. When a young Pericles pro-duced this tragedy in 472 the people of Athens were still reflecting on theirempire and war in the city of athena81"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"victory over the Persian Empire. After this first foray into Athenian publiclife, Pericles disappears from the extant rec ords for a time. When hereemerged into a position of leadership some ten years later, he enteredonto a po liti cal scene where the allied navy and its policy of Aegean dom-inance had a hold on many Athenians, most notably the wealthy and pow-erful Cimon. It was the practice in many Greek poleisfor a board of mag-istrates to review the accounts and activities of public officials when theyleft office; in 463 Pericles was appointed to be the public examiner forCimon, who as outgoing general had been accused of enriching himselfby accepting bribes while in Macedonia. Although Pericles’ prosecution ofCimon resulted in Cimon’s acquittal (and later reelection to the office ofstrategos), managing the trial of a prominent Athenian public figure didplace Pericles in the public eye, and he remained at the center of civic lifeuntil his death thirty- four years later.Under Pericles’ leadership the nomoiof Athens continued to change; thecity grew in wealth, power, and prestige while the demosseized economicopportunities in the markets and sought access to decision making withinthe polisitself. Among the most important reforms that would be put for-ward by Pericles during his long career was a controversial policy that paidcitizen jurors for their ser vice in the Athenian law courts, thereby makingparticipation in the judicial system more attractive to men of modestmeans. Equally significant were the citizenship laws of 451 that redefinedand limited who was eligible to claim the privileges of Athenian citizenship.Civic rites would change under Pericles, too, as Athenian citizens publiclycelebrated their patron goddess Athena and displayed their wealth andpower at major festivals.The first steps toward new status for the demoscame when Pericles be-came associated with a reform- minded civic leader named Ephialtes. Weknow little about this Ephialtes, but what we do know attaches him, andpossibly Pericles, to a reor ga ni za tion of the Athenian court system— reformsthat brought new power to the Athenian demos.Traditionally the councilof the Areopagus held a good deal of power: as a body of ex- archons who were granted lifetime membership upon leaving office, the Areopagus hadduties that probably ranged from advising current archons to maintaininglegislative and administrative oversight to wielding judicial authority incertain cases with cultic implications, especially hom i cide. The Areopagus’scustom of trying cases and considering their religious impact on the po liti -cal community provides further evidence for the Athenians’ custom of inter-twining matters of civil law and religious practice. After Ephialtes’ reformspericles82"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"in 462, the council of the Areopagus was left mainly with the task of try-ing cases involving religious offenses, while the demosexercised expandedpowers in the assembly, the council, and the law courts. Responsibility foroversight (e.g., examining outgoing officeholders, as Pericles had tried Ci-mon) was moved from the Areopagus and given to the demosat large.These changes to the governance of the polis were highly charged: shortlyafter the passage of these reforms to the Areopagus, Cimon (who opposedthe reforms) was ostracized, and Ephialtes himself mysteriously murdered.But Pericles survived and learned how to harness the new power investedin the Athenian demos.The members of the demoswho benefited from Ephialtes’ reforms wereinhabiting a social and economic landscape that was changing rapidly af-ter two de cades of Cimon’s guidance. During the de cades before thePersian Wars, Athens had fundamentally resembled other Greek poleis.Theeconomy of Attica had been essentially an agricultural one, and its armywas traditionally composed of ordinary citizen farmers who served as in-fantrymen in the hoplite phalanx. While Athens’ prosperity had always re-lied to some extent on sea trade, the key decision under Themistocles toexpand the Athenian navy, combined with its ensuing success at sea in thebattle of Salamis, persuaded Athenians to develop their sea power furtherwhile also maintaining their army of hoplites. Consequently, during theheyday of Cimon’s career in the 470s and 460s— well before Pericles’ en-try into civic life— the economies of Athens and its port city of Piraeushad turned to trade, banking, ship building, and weapons manufacturing.These two urban centers of Attica grew faster than ever as Athenians re-paired the damage done by the occupying Persian army and prepared foranother war with the barbarians whom they expected would eventually re-turn. All sectors of the Athenian demosgrew quickly in response to deci-sions to continue funding the navy and building ships, but the lowest classof landless citizens, called thetes,benefited in a new way as they laboredalongside slaves in the shipyards and workshops in urban Piraeus andAthens. Economic opportunities opened up not just for Athenians of thelower classes but for foreigners, too. Entrepreneurs from all over Hellascame to Athens to trade and start businesses related to the navy and defenseindustries. These foreigners were called metics, and although they werenot citizens many of them became quite wealthy and powerful.The continuing interest in naval development also prompted Atheniansto design new ships and develop new strategies for battle at sea. The prin-cipal vessel at their disposal was the trireme, a long, slender, and unusuallyempire and war in the city of athena83"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"fast ship that was powered by banks of oarsmen. The typical Atheniantrireme had 200 men on board— about 170 men at the oars, plus thesailors navigating the ship and armed marines who fought in hand- to- hand combat. Most of the oarsmen were recruited from the poorer thetes,but occasionally foreigners and much more rarely slaves served. While thetraditional Greek army of hoplites relied on the limited wealth and re-sources of landholding citizen farmers, the Athenian navy embraced theselower classes. Training the men to work together to power ships and movethem about in tight quarters was a long, arduous, and expensive task, butone at which the Athenians came to excel. Overall the shift in military focusfrom hoplite to naval warfare first put forward by Themistocles in the 480s,and continued under Cimon in the 470s and ’60s, helped urban citizensand landless thetestake on additional and significant roles in the polisre-formed by Ephialtes.The new powers that Ephialtes granted to the demosreflected these so-cial and economic changes. By 462 Athens was an empire that had twiceused the navy to put down revolts within the Delian League; the demos,both the landowning hoplites and the urban thetes,apparently wantedmore of a voice in decision making. Ephialtes gave them this voice withthe reforms of the Areopagus. One of the first decisions the demosthenmade involved the city’s defenses. In 478 the Athenians had shored up theirfortifications first before rebuilding their homes and temples. But then be-tween 461 and 456 they extended the city walls all the way to the harborsat Phaleron and Piraeus. By 445 a third wall built alongside the Piraeuswall connected Athens and its harbor with a 4- mile- long fortified corridorthat was 200 yards wide. These walls, known as the Long Walls, encloseda highway that could carry food and supplies from the harbor to the urbancenter of Athens. The increased fortification of Piraeus and the construc-tion of the Long Walls now enabled Athenians to withstand any tradi-tional siege for as long as the poliscould afford to import necessities.Athens became, in effect, an island.While making these changes at home Athens also renegotiated relationswith its immediate neighbors, Megara and Thebes. As regional tensionswaxed and waned the Corinthians and Spartans became ner vous, andeventually the situation escalated into what scholars call the First Pelopon-nesian War. Victories in a few small regional conflicts after 460 allowedthe Delian League to grow even more and gain some Dorian territory, in-cluding the island of Aegina, which lies immediately off the coast of At-tica to the south. Aegina, like an increasing number of subject- allies, waspericles84"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"forced to join the league in 458 only after prolonged pressure. As theDelian League was gaining strength under Athenian direction, allianceleaders in 459 made a crucial decision to extend their policy toward Persiain a slightly new direction. After successes in the Aegean and Ionia, theAthenians and their allies came to the aid of Egyptians who were trying toshake off the Persian yoke. The five years spent fighting in Egypt turnedout to be very costly for the league, and entirely unsuccessful.The expansion of Athenian rule, combined with completion of the for-tified walls between Athens and Piraeus, created anxiety in the poleisof thePeloponnese, and even Athens’ allies had second thoughts about Athenianmanagement of the Delian League following the pivotal defeat in Egypt.The Peloponnesians’ fears would be temporarily allayed when a peace wasbrokered between Athens and Sparta (446 ) and the two powers agreed toa thirty- year truce, but a major development in the Athenian empire— which used traditional religious practices to express Athens’ power— tookplace before that truce was negotiated. In 454 decimated Delian Leagueforces left Egypt in defeat, and the Athenians moved the alliance trea suryfrom its home at the Apollo sanctuary on the island of Delos to a newhome in Athens. Allies’ suspicions about the Athenians’ intention to usethe league as a means to dominate other member states were thereby fullyrealized.The shift made in 454 from Delos to Athens marks a key moment inAthenian self- definition, as traditional cult practices were used to expressAthens’ new economic status and the Athenians’ changing identity. Apollohad long been worshipped by the Ionians at the sanctuary on Delos. Ioni-ans from the mainland, the Aegean islands, and Ionia alike celebratednomoiand commonly held customs that embraced sacrifice, prophecy, andathletic and poetic competitions. The goddess Athena was recognized by allIonian poleis,but it was clear that she was a goddess especially connectedto the people of Athens. While alliance monies had customarily beencontrolled by Athenian trea sur ers only, the transfer of the Delian League’strea sury to Athens showed the Athenians openly embracing their role asimperial leader of other nominally in de pen dent poleis.The Athenians firstritualized this transformation, and then they memorialized it: starting in454 they recorded and publicly displayed lists of the aparchai,or first fruitsofferings, separated out from the tribute payments annually presented bythe subject- allies. The dedication of aparchaito the gods was one of themost ancient and widespread traditional practices in the Mediterranean,common among Romans, Greeks, and Semitic peoples.

At an animal sacrifice a smallportion of the victim was consecrated in the fire before humans enjoyedthe rest. Aparchai were symbolically presented to the gods first; aparchailit-erally means “things from the start.” Beginning in 454 the goddess Athenaannually received her due portion of aparchaiat a civic festival in Athenswhen the Athenians designated a portion of the tribute paid by poleisin theDelian League. Instead of giving a portion of an animal victim or agricul-tural produce to the goddess, the Athenians dedicated money: specifically, one- sixtieth of the allies’ phoros.Never before had membership in the Delian League combined withAthenian citizenship promised so much power and prestige to Athena andthe demosof Athens. Demo cratic institutions and practices continued toopen up for all sectors of the demos,as the po liti cal reforms to the courtsthat Ephialtes advanced in 462/1 were followed by another policy changein the late 450s. Whereas ser vice in the law courts had in the past been avoluntary ser vice that citizens offered the polis,under Pericles the demosin-stituted pay for jurors. The daily salary of 2 obols (later raised to 3) wasnot great, but it was roughly equivalent to a day’s wage for laborers like thecitizen theteswho toiled in the workshops and factories of Athens andPiraeus. Providing pay for citizens to serve in the law courts proved to be acontroversial move, one that the aristocracy especially loathed. But by sup-porting this change to Athenian nomoiPericles showed his continuingcommitment to sharing power among all members of the demos,not justthose with sufficient wealth. Such a radical change in the city’s customscould not have been anticipated in the reforms of Pericles’ ancestorCleisthenes.The reforms of Ephialtes and the institution of pay for jury ser vice pro-vide the po liti cal background for some key citizenship laws that were thenpassed in Athens in 451. These laws, often credited to Pericles, limited therights of Athenian citizenship to those whose parents— father and mother alike— were both Athenian. The passage of this law implies that the nomoisurrounding citizenship in the past had been more fluid, perhaps allowingmetics, former slaves, and their children to achieve citizen status. Earliercustoms had also acknowledged the citizenship of children of Athenianmen married to non- Athenian but ethnically Greek wives from neighbor-ing poleis— a custom that was especially common among old aristocraticfamilies of Hellas.

Democracy and empire were mingling powers in ways never be-fore imagined.the panathenaea remadeUnder Pericles’ three de cades of leadership, the Athenian demosinstitutedcontroversial demo cratic reforms while consolidating an empire that wasgrowing in wealth and power. Monumental changes in civic festivals ac-companied these po liti cal developments, and the changes in Atheniancivic rites were grounded in the citizens’ changing understanding of theirown economic and po liti cal power. The transferal of the Delian League’strea sury to Athens in 454 ushered in the final stage in the development ofan Athenian empire. During this stage the financial, po liti cal, and religiousaspects of empire wove together and their synergistic interlocking pro-pelled Athenians toward new relationships with each other, while it trans-formed the relationships between Athens and other cities in the empire. Inthe Athenians’ eyes the new relationships had divine sanction, and the cit-izens of Athens visibly expressed their cultural dominance with religiousrituals and cult practices that celebrated their city’s patron deity, Athena.Once the trea sury of the Delian League was transferred to Athens andthe demoshad new powers, Athenian customs of governance and decisionmaking took off in a new direction. While precise details of the Athenianbud get during these years of Pericles’ leadership are lost, historical sourcesrecord that heated discussions arose about how to use the money— Periclesrepresenting the interests of the demosand aristocrats like Thucydides sonof Melesias representing the old guard that opposed many of the demo -cratic reforms. Athenians took out loans from trea suries sacred to Athenaand to the other gods to finance military operations. Extant financial rec -ords and decrees indicate how Delian League funds were used for projectsnot related to the navy. Access to this revenue enabled Athenians to fundnew programs and finance public works. Direct access to the Delian Leaguetrea sury may even be the very thing that persuaded the demosthat it couldafford to fund the ser vice of jurors. Even if league funds were not directlyused to pay the jurors, access to the funds relieved other areas of the bud -get and freed up monies for such pay.

A later (fourth century and highly controversial) inscriptional sourcerec ords that Athenian soldiers took a vow to this effect at Plataea immedi-ately following the second fall of Athens in 479. Right after the war Atheni-ans cleared the Acropolis and dug a trench in which they deposited sculp-tures and ceremonial objects that had been damaged beyond repair whenthe Persians overran the sanctuary. This artwork from the Archaic periodwas uncovered by archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and now isdisplayed in the museums of modern Athens. Pieces of buildings and tem-ples destroyed by the Persians were reused as building stones in repairing theramparts of the Acropolis; even today, column drums and other architec-tural elements are visible in the north face of the Acropolis walls. The Acrop-olis itself remained a sacred temenos,or precinct, and a place where civic sac-rifices was performed at public altars; there must have been a simple templeof some sort to house the ancient wooden image of Athena. Meanwhile thedemosvoted to spend its money for other public works projects, especiallythose related to the defense of the city.But sometime shortly following the transfer of the Delian League trea suryfrom Delos to Athens the Athenians moved in a different direction, choos-ing to use Athena’s share of the tributary funds to rebuild the Acropolismore gloriously than ever. Perhaps the demosjustified the decision to fundthe rebuilding with Delian League funds by saying that Athens had beensingled out for destruction over other poleisduring the struggle with Persia;perhaps the threat of Persia had receded and the Athenians argued that theother poleisowed it to them for saving Greece from barbarian overlords.However they justified it, the Propylaea, Parthenon, and Erechtheum— architectural masterpieces sacred to Athena that artists, poets, and touristshave marveled at and that are being preserved on the Acropolis today— werebuilt not only with monies paid by Athenian citizens but also with tributemoney collected from Athens’ subject- allies in the Athenian empire. Muchof this building program was funded and begun during the mid- 440s, andalthough there was opposition, the leadership skills of men like Pericles per-suaded Athenians that the demoswould be best served at that moment bypericles88"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"reinvigorating the worship of the patron goddess Athena, now that the cityand the harbor had been rebuilt and fortified.The traditional Athenian celebration of the Panathenaea was subtlychanged during these de cades following the transfer of the Delian Leaguetrea sury to Athens, and the changes reflected the status of the Delian League’srecognized leader. All segments of Athenian society were visible in the pro- cession, and eventually this meant that the pro cession made room for vis-iting foreigners and for resident metics, their wives, and their daughters.While metics and foreigners did not share the same status as citizens, espe-cially after the citizenship laws of 451, they did play an integral role in thepolisand the empire. Starting in the late 450s, allied member poleisin theDelian League were required to send ambassadors to take part in the greatpro cession that began at the city’s gates and wound through the Agora andup the Acropolis. Subject- allies were also required to supply a cow for thepro cession and the sacrifice afterward, as well as a full set of armor called apanoply. During the fifth century, some wagons in the pro cession were dec-orated and transformed into ships on wheels, and the great birthday robe ofAthena that was the centerpiece of the festival was displayed as a sail on aship that glided through the city to the foot of the Acropolis. The sail re-called the Athenians’ critical naval victory over the Persians at Salamis: thetransformed civic rites of Athens demonstrated the links between Athens’navy, its empire, and its goddess.The pro cession with ship- carts started at the Dipylon gate in the Ker-ameikos neighborhood and passed by the most important major civic mon-uments: the altar of the twelve gods; the Royal Stoa, which had displayedthe law tablets of Solon since at least the time of Ephialtes; the heroic bronzeimages of the Tyrannicides; and the new Painted Stoa, with its patrioticpaintings of Theseus leading the Athenians to victory at Marathon. Atheni-ans pro cessed past these monuments that celebrated the legacy and trajec-tory of Athenian democracy as they wished to portray it to themselves andto the others in attendance. During the festival subject- allies learned fromAthenian civic magistrates what their assessed phoroswould be for thecoming year, and the tribute list detailing each member’s aparchaioffer-ings for Athena was published.

An earlier con-struction phase for a new temple sacred to Athena had been interrupted in480 when occupying Persian forces knocked down what ever partially com-pleted structure had been standing. The design and construction of an en-tirely new temple then resumed under Pericles in 447 as the Athenian em-pire was reaching its peak of wealth and influence. The Parthenon wascompleted in two phases— the structure itself was finished in 438 and thefull program of artwork in 432. When the Parthenon and all its artworkand sculptural friezes were dedicated in 432, the Athenians could finally seethe completed images they were presenting to the Greek world. The art onthe Acropolis celebrated Athena’s victories over chaos and foreigners: theAmazons, the Giants, the Centaurs. A long, continuous frieze in honor ofAthens’ patroness that ran along the top of the interior porch of the templewas finished last. It may have been an afterthought, but the frieze brokenew artistic ground: instead of depicting the gods, the great frieze picturedthe Athenians themselves in their orderly Panathenaic pro cession, leadinganimal victims destined for the goddess’s altar. Today a part of this frieze is housed among the Elgin Marbles in London’s British Museum.The overall architectural design for the Acropolis included rebuildingother sacred structures destroyed by the Persians. Following the comple-tion of the Parthenon the Athenians built the Propylaea (436–432), themonumental gateway at the top of the stairs leading up the Acropolis.This complex structure that symbolically marked the entrance to the sanc-tuary was built in a great hurry and, because of the war, never fully com-pleted. The gallery on its north side is believed to have been used as a din-ing room for honored guests and civic magistrates who officiated atsacrificial rites. The location of the great altar remained where it had beenbefore the Persian invasion, namely in front of the east entrance of the ar-chaic temple of Athena, even though this placement meant that the altarwas out of line with the new Parthenon. Finally, work on the Erechtheum,the Acropolis’s most complex sacred structure, was begun in 421 and com-pleted, after a lapse in construction, in 407. This unusual building prob-ably stood on the foundations of an older structure that contained shrinesto many gods and heroes sacred to the Athenians— not just Athena butalso Zeus, Hephaestus, Poseidon, and Erechtheus, a mythical king whogave his life serving the demosin the struggle for the unification of Attica.Under Pericles the glory of Athena and the polisof Athens reached anapex of influence and grandeur.

Famed phi los o phers and natural scientists came to Athensto teach new ideas, and Pericles was known to welcome these figures andfinancially support them during their visits to the city. One Ionian for-eigner who reportedly came to Athens during these years was a womanwho would acquire great fame in the city, Aspasia of Miletus. In the Athe-nian public milieu— in the gossip of the Agora and in plays produced onthe stage— Aspasia acquired a wildly varied reputation, credited with be-ing a great beauty and intellect who taught rhetoric, a madam who kept an up- scale brothel and whose influence on public figures was more intimate,and everything in between. Ancient biographical traditions are notoriouslyunreliable and most if not all of these ancient reports may be false specu-lation and rumor. Still, some facts about Aspasia are certain: when Pericles’first marriage ended in failure, Aspasia became Pericles’ life partner; to-gether they had at least one child, a son also named Pericles. Ironically, theterms of the Periclean citizenship laws of 451 ensured that this son of anAthenian father and Ionian Greek mother could not be considered a citi-zen, though a special decree was later passed in the Assembly recognizingthe full citizen status of the younger Pericles.empire and war in the city of athena91"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Pericles also befriended a number of other foreigners who found Athensto be a favorable place to pursue their careers. Anaxagoras, a phi los o pherand scientist from Ionia, settled in Athens in perhaps the 450s. Indeed, heis the first phi los o pher known to have made Athens his home, and he taughtthere for at least twenty years. Anaxagoras was one of the teachers knownin antiquity as the physiologoior the physikoi— those who teach about thenatural world. The subtlety and innovation of his teaching made a greatstir among Athenians, and many eagerly became his pupils. They tookgreat plea sure in discussing his scientific theories about eclipses and hisradical new idea that the sun was actually a great rotating, fiery rock. Suchrevolutionary views were not welcomed by all Athenians; some religiousconservatives deemed it impious for mortal men to construct scientific the-ories about the sun and the heavens, entities considered divine in more tra-ditional Greek cosmologies. While the conservatives did not stop Periclesfrom studying with the Ionian phi los o pher, they did punish both men.One later source reports that Anaxagoras was successfully prosecuted forimpiety in the courts of Athens, and the scientist was compelled to live outthe remainder of his life back in Ionia. Pericles’ support for Anaxagorasand his new scientific ideas came at a dear price.Pericles’ love for innovation did not end with scientific inquiry— he alsoappreciated pioneers in art, architecture, and design. One of Pericles’ con-fidants was the artist Phidias, a fellow Athenian. His reputation through-out antiquity was of the first order, and he was acknowledged as the artistresponsible for much of the art on the rebuilt Acropolis, including a colos-sal bronze image of Athena that was visible from the sea as ships ap-proached Athens and the Piraeus. He likewise fashioned a gold and ivorycult image of Athena that stood within the Parthenon itself. The engi-neering and art design for the buildings that Phidias oversaw suggest thatsculptors and architects were applying new mathematical concepts aboutproportion and harmony. But Phidias may have suffered the same fate asAnaxagoras: he too was reportedly charged with impiety just as the templeof Athena Parthenos was nearing completion. The charge centered on theclaim that Phidias had sculpted his own image and that of Pericles in de-tails on the base of the cult statue of Athena. Another tradition reportsthat the artist embezzled some of the gold and ivory intended for thestatue of the goddess. Whether or not he was put on trial, the fact remainsthat by the end of the 430s Phidias had left Athens and was working in thePeloponnese, fashioning the great cult image of Zeus that would domi-nate a new temple in the panhellenic sanctuary at Olympia.pericles92"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The historical tradition surrounding the impiety trials of Anaxagorasand Phidias during the late 440s and ’30s was the subject of much debateamong scholars in the twentieth century. Adding to the uncertainty werefurther reports alleging that Pericles’ common- law wife Aspasia, too, wascharged with impiety in the 430s. While later sources from the Hellenisticand Roman periods are nearly unanimous in assigning these three impietytrials to this de cade, there is no evidence from the fifth century that anysuch trials ever occurred. Perhaps the safest thing to conclude is that dur-ing these years of his leadership Pericles had his critics in Athens, andGreek writers a century later found it compelling to imagine these criticsattacking Pericles through his friends. The attacks as described involvecharges of civic impiety— behaviors that run counter to the prevailingmodes and customs of worshipping the gods. Yet Pericles’ visible commit-ment to Athena spoke in his favor: he apparently saw no contradiction be-tween the new ideas being advanced and the traditional civic cult of theOlympian gods as practiced in Athens. Thysiaremained one of the foun-dations of civic life. For Pericles, worshipping Athena in a restored sacredprecinct that embodied the new mathematics was a celebration of tradi-tional civic rites.

Corinth, situated on the strategic bridge ofland between Sparta and Attica, felt the pressure keenly. Although Athensand Sparta arbitrated their differences and negotiated a thirty- year peacetreaty in 446/5, this peace in fact barely lasted fourteen years. By the late430s the tension between Attica and the Peloponnesian League had focusedon Corinth in two separate incidents. One related to Athenian involvementwith Corinth and two colonies in northwest Hellas, the Corinthian colonyCorcyra and Corcyra’s colony Epidamnus. There Athenian and Corinthianships engaged directly in a minor naval skirmish. Around the same timeanother conflict arose between Athens and Corinth over the Corinthiancolony of Potidaea, a well- fortified port city in the northern Aegean.

Its strategic locationmade it an attractive ally for the Athenians, who had earlier forced it intothe Delian League. But by 432 the Potidaeans grew dissatisfied with the in-creasing demands for tribute from the alliance with Athens; when they de-sired to pull out of the Delian League the Corinthians gladly offered help.After a two- year siege of the colony (432–430), with Athens facing com-bined Potidaean and Peloponnesian forces, the Athenians achieved victory.They established their own colonists in Potidaea and compelled the city toremain in the Delian League.When the Corinthians confronted the Athenian navy late in the 430s atCorcyra and Potidaea, they did so on the northern and the western edgesof Hellas. In one sense these were minor conflicts in marginal places, andthe po liti cal differences could have been easily negotiated. But some mem-bers of the Peloponnesian League felt they saw a pattern emerging. Al-though Sparta had so far stayed outside the center of action, it still fearedthe growing dominance of Athenian rule. Pericles remained a steadfastproponent of the Athenian empire, and the demosfollowed him. Mean-while Corinth and Sparta suspected that the two minor disputes at Cor-cyra and Potidaea had less to do with relations between the Delian Leagueand the Peloponnesian League than with the ability of any Greek polistogovern itself and manage relations with its colonies and neighbors. Con-tinued Corinthian appeals to the Spartan leaders of the PeloponnesianLeague prompted Sparta to issue a series of three ultimatums to the Athe-nians. Their final demand was simple: let the Greeks be free. Pericles advisedthe Athenians to make no concessions to the Peloponnesians (Thucydides 1.139–44).Much of our understanding of the causes of the war and the motiva-tions of the Athenians and Spartans has come to us through the writingsof one par tic u lar historian: Thucydides. A capable Athenian general whoexercised command over a naval vessel until 424/3, Thucydides exhibitedan acute awareness of himself as a historian. Like Herodotus, who recordedwhat he saw as the epic confrontation of Hellas with a major imperialAsian power in the past, Thucydides early on recognized the larger signifi-cance of the current war between Athens and Sparta. But while Herodotus’smoral compass warned of an inevitable divine response (nemesis) to hu-mans’ denial of their mortal limitations (hubris), Thucydides largely dis-counted the role played by the gods’ justice in human affairs.

Athens’ allies had been liberated by the PeloponnesianLeague and the empire was broken. Some of Athens’ enemies even calledfor the death of all its citizens and the enslavement of Athenian womenand children, a tactic the Athenians had come to use on especially resistant subject- allies during the course of the war. The Spartans, recalling the sac-rifices of the Athenians and Athens’ total destruction during the PersianWars seventy- five years earlier, exercised mercy. They opted for terms ofpeace stipulating that Athens never again be allowed to build a navy. Butthey did allow the civic monuments and the po liti cal and religious nomoiof Athens to remain unchanged. Even in defeat, the civic rites of the Athe-nians persisted.This outcome— that the Spartans would be such clear winners— couldnever have been predicted from the ebb and flow of the early phases of thewar. The first de cade of fighting, from 431 to 421, cost a great deal, both inlives lost and resources spent, and yet it ended in a stalemate. This firstphase of the conflict, known as the Archidamian War, was a calculated face- off between two entirely mismatched forces. From the start of thewar, with their first invasion of Attica in the spring of 431, the Spartans re-lied on their famous and formidable hoplite infantry. The army of Pelo-ponnesian hoplites was trained as Greek armies had always been trained,and they planned to wage a traditional war against the Athenians, invad-ing the countryside of Attica during the early summer and laying waste toagricultural lands before retreating back to Sparta. The Spartan strategyassumed that no community of Greek citizens would tolerate this sort ofdevastation for very long.The Athenians, on the other hand, under the leadership of Pericles con-tinued to develop their navy as they had been doing since the days ofThemistocles and the second Persian invasion in 480. Athenian offensivetactics entailed sailing to the Peloponnese and landing armed forces thatmade incursions into Spartan territory and wreaked havoc before retreat-ing back to their ships. But the defense of Attica was far more innovative.Pericles had long supported the strategy that made the city of Athens intoa virtual island, and he urged the Athenians to abandon the countryside ofAttica and move their families within the city walls. The demosfollowedhis recommendations— even though doing so entailed great hardship andempire and war in the city of athena95"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"economic loss. With the reinforced city fortifications of Athens and thePiraeus, and with newer walls linking the two, Athenians could withstandany siege the Spartans might lay.Pericles’ plan relied on defensive fortifications that had been rebuilt andsubstantially enlarged in the de cades following the Persian Wars. As longas the citizens were inside the city and as long as the Long Walls held, thenavy could bring provisions to Piraeus and feed the people enclosed withinthe urban centers. Subject- allies would continue to bring their annualtribute and the seat of empire would remain intact. The Spartans werestunned that the Athenians, or any Greek people for that matter, couldadopt a policy that forced them to abandon their farms and sacrifice thecountryside in order to maintain a naval empire. But the Athenians didprecisely this during the early phases of the conflict, surprising the Spartansand creating the conditions for stalemate. Even after changes made to thedefenses of Attica in the war’s later phases, the fortifications held until thecapitulation of Athens in 404.There were, however, unforeseeable and immediate consequences to thisAthenian defensive strategy: a plague broke out. The devastating epidemichit Athens not once but twice during the opening years of the war, a majoroutbreak from 430 to 428 and a smaller one in 427. No one was quite surewhere the disease came from. Perhaps it traveled to Piraeus from Ethiopiaor Egypt, as Thucydides proposed, carried on infected rodents that in-fested shipments of imported grain, or possibly it was an outbreak of epi-demic typhus or smallpox. Regardless of its origins, the illness was deadlyand killed thousands of victims. Thucydides himself survived a bout withthis plague, and his famous account of the disease described the gruesomeand fatal symptoms that did not discriminate among victims. Rich and poor,men and women died alike, as did citizens, slaves, and resident foreigners(Thucydides 2.47–54).Some historians have estimated the number of dead at 50,000— an as-tounding number, given that the total population of Attica at the start ofthe war was perhaps 250,000, of whom 40,000 were citizens. Since theovercrowded walled city was sheltering refugees from the countryside ofAttica, living conditions deteriorated and even aggravated the disease rateand death toll. At the height of the outbreak Thucydides described a com-plete social and moral breakdown not unlike what was later reported dur-ing plague outbreaks in fourteenth- century Eu rope. All nomoithat heldtogether civic society were forgotten in the panic of disease: the sick wentuncared for and corpses lay rotting in homes, streets, and public areas.pericles96"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"When they did bury the dead, residents did not have the time or resourcesto conduct burials according to nomos.The sanctuaries of the gods wereoverrun with refugees from the countryside who had put up tents andtemporary huts there, and soon even temples were polluted with corpses.In the face of indiscriminate suffering and death, citizens behaved withoutany consideration for law, whether divine or human.Among the victims of the plague was the Athenian leader Pericles. Hewas about 65 when he fell ill alongside thousands of his fellow citizensand died the same excruciating death. We do not know who mourned thepassing of Pericles. Even though most scholars consider Thucydides tohave been a strong supporter of Pericles and his policies, his history barelymentions the death of Pericles. Instead of narrating this dark moment inAthenian history at the start of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydidestwice shows Pericles at his proudest. The two passages that surround thedescription of the plague reveal the Athenians’ feelings of confidence andsuperiority at the start of the conflict, and they also showcase Pericles’powers as a public speaker whose brilliance so inspired the Atheniandemos.A speech following the description of the plague gives Pericles’ fi-nal words of encouragement after Attica was invaded for the second timein the summer of 430, just as the plague was first breaking out and theresidents of Athens were really starting to suffer (Thucydides 2.59–64).Pericles reminds Athenians of the greatness of their naval empire, andhe cautions them against becoming lesser men than their fathers: theymust fight for freedom, and fight to uphold the honor that empire bringsto the city.In the passage immediately before he mentions the plague, Thucydidespresents Pericles giving his famous funeral oration for those who fell fight-ing for Athens (Thucydides 2.34–46). In this passage we see Pericles inthe winter of 431/0. It is the end of the first year of the war, and Pericles thestrategosmemorializes the fallen dead with an epitaphios,a eulogy for thosewho have fallen in battle. In accordance with demo cratic tradition theAthenians held a great civic funeral to honor the dead. Public funerals wereoccasionally depicted in literary sources; for example, in Homer’s Iliadfallen warriors were honored with funerary rites that included libations,sacrifices, a communal meal, and athletic games. In the historical period,funerary customs varied by polis.Cemeteries were generally located along-side major roads outside a city’s walls, as the graves in Athens’ Kerameikosdistrict lined both sides of the Sacred Way just north of the Themisto-clean fortification walls built following the Persian Wars.empire and war in the city of athena97"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The state funeral, with its epitaphiosspeech and the Epitaphia festivalthat followed, appears to be a uniquely Athenian custom that dates per-haps from the 460s and the period of Athenian ascendancy. All membersof the community, citizens and foreigners alike, pro cessed to the statecemetery in the Kerameikos, where a leading citizen spoke in praise of thefallen dead and compared these men to those who had died defendingAthens in the past. Athletic and poetic competitions followed the burial.The civic funeral was also one of the few occasions when Athenian womenparticipated in the shared public ceremonies. As the Athenian custom un-folded over time it diverged notably from the practice described in Homer:in the Iliadonly aristocrats received a magnificent burial, but in Athensevery man who died in battle received the same honors. The bones of thelowly thetesand oarsmen on the ships were gathered and buried togetherwith those of the richest aristocrats. In this civic rite awareness of humanmortality was placed in a larger context that included both the ancestorsand the immortal gods; the community gathered to reflect on its past vic-tory over the Persian Empire and to reaffirm its current commitments.Just as Pericles’ final speech given later in book 2 (2.59–64) recalls theglorious accomplishments of the Athenians’ forefathers and urges citizensto look to the honor of their empire, so Pericles’ funeral oration links therecent deaths of soldiers with the deaths of honorable men from priorgenerations, and it celebrates their contributions to the continuing gloryand ultimate victory of Athens. Thucydides’ placement of the funeral ora-tion right before the plague narrative underscores the tragedy not only ofthe lives lost in that first year of fighting but also of those who would soonperish on the home front— including Pericles himself. The surviving fam-ily members and friends that Pericles addressed in the state cemetery in theKerameikos in 430 were the very Athenians who were about to succumb tothe plague and suffer needless, horrific deaths.Thucydides’ report of Pericles’ funeral oration illustrates one of the ma-jor themes in his history: how humans are motivated by power and honor.A close reading of the passage also shows how religious rituals play a rolein the unfolding of that power. Thucydides clearly indicates the po liti calcontext of the funeral ceremony, and pointedly refers to the foundationalAthenian demo cratic institution of the ten Cleisthenic tribes. Underneatha tent, the ashes and bones of those who had fallen in battle were arrangedaccording to the tribe the dead belonged to.

When Pericles delivered his words of praise, he spoke facingthe Athenian people and alongside the ten tribal coffins of the dead.The bones of the ancestors had long carried a powerful po liti cal mean-ing for all the Greeks. Two hundred years had passed since the Athenianshad cursed Megacles and his descendants the Alcmaeonidae, and it hadbeen perhaps a hundred years since Athenians (with Spartan encourage-ment) had expelled bones of the accursed Alcmaeonidae from Attica. Al-though the Alcmaeonids did return to Athens and two descendants (Cleis-thenes and Pericles) even succeeded in bringing demo cratic reforms to thepolis,the memory of the curse was not forgotten. Following the episodes atCorcyra and Potidaea in 432/1, when Sparta and its allies were consideringhow to respond to the overwhelming power of the Athenian empire, theSpartans had tried to force the Athenians to exile Pericles, the leader whowas most energetically urging the Athenian demostoward war. The Spar-tans sent negotiators to Athens who called down the curse of the goddess:they reminded the Athenians that Athena herself had been wronged longago when men were impiously killed in her sanctuary (Thucydides 1.126).The taint of the curse that rested on Pericles, a descendant of the impiousmurderers, could bring harm to Athens, the Spartans claimed. Thucydides’report of this diplomatic move explicitly states that the Spartans did notexpect that the Athenians would actually expel Pericles— they hoped onlythat the reminder of the curse would implicate Pericles, and then the cursewould come to be considered a cause for the conflict. There is some evidencethat Athenians viewed the curse similarly, and in the coming years noone would doubt that Athens suffered under the accursed plague of war. empire and war in the city of athena99"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"athens was sacred to athena,goddess of the olive, of handcrafts, andof wisdom, but Athenians were of course polytheistic, and for many gen-erations they had also worshipped Demeter, the goddess whose power wasmanifest in abundant sheaves of wheat. The plains of Attica could provideonly a limited supply of wheat, barley, and rye— certainly not enough tofeed all the citizens and residents of the polis;over time Athens became de-pendent on imported grain to feed the population in the main city and thePiraeus. The Athenian navy ensured the empire’s continuing access to for-eign markets by protecting merchant ships and trade routes. The devasta-tion of the plague that hit Athens at the start of the Peloponnesian Waronly served to remind Athenians of the importance of a reliable and safefood supply. After 428, Athens needed the blessings of Demeter more thanever to maintain its empire.It was Demeter’s great power over the fertility of the land that connectedher to the cultivation of crops. She was worshipped all over the Greek world,and indeed throughout much of the Mediterranean basin. Demeter had im-portant cult centers in Attica, Asia Minor, and Sicily; later on, the Romansin Italy called her Ceres, the goddess of cereal crops. The worship of an-other agricultural god was likewise ancient and deeply rooted throughoutthe wider Greek world. Dionysus, too, held a position of power in ancientHellenic societies. Greeks considered Dionysus the god of the grapevine and100fourDemeterCivic Worship, Women’s Rites, and the Eleusinian Mysteries"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"its cultivation, and therefore also the god of wine. With bread and wine atthe very heart of the most rudimentary Mediterranean diet, Demeter andDionysus were present in the daily lives of all Hellenic peoples in antiquity.Both Dionysus and Demeter occupied prominent places in the civic cal-endars and mythologies of Greek poleis.Many cities had their own par tic -u lar story of how Demeter once visited and taught their ancestors to culti-vate grain. In Attica Demeter was said to have given the gift of agricultureto all humankind when she once lived near Athens in the town of Eleusis;likewise Dionysus chose to give his unique gifts to Athenians in the long- ago mythological past. To commemorate these divine gifts Athenians cel-ebrated Demeter festivals such as the Eleusinian Mysteries and the Thes-mophoria in the late summer and fall, and Dionysian festivals such as theLenaea, the Anthesteria, and the Dionysia in the winter and spring. Thesecivic festivals with their sacrifices and feasts were publicly financed andwidely attended by both citizens and other residents of Attica. The Thes-mophoria was open only to citizen wives; other festivals attracted foreign-ers as well as citizens and residents.In ancient Athens, social activities not recognized today as religious weredeeply connected to the gods and to the state: publicly funded worship ofthe gods provided the demoswith opportunities for feasting and drinking,and these civic rites linked humans and the gods as collaborators in theAthenian polis.In fundamental ways the worship of Demeter and Dionysuswas no different than the customs of war as it was waged in Greece. Warfaretoo involved the gods at every step, from battlefield sacrifices performed be-fore fighting commenced to peace treaties as it ended. The gods were in-voked when Persian invaded Attica in 490 and 480, and when an alliancewas forged at Apollo’s sanctuary on Delos. Whenever any alliance or treatywas negotiated, spondaisealed the agreement: libations of wine dedicated tothe gods were poured directly onto the ground. The terms of treaties re-quired Olympian gods such as Zeus, Athena, or Apollo to witness their an-nual renewal at local festivals where prayers, civic sacrifices and communalfeasting would follow the libations that soaked into the soil.While the earth and soil were not considered holy per se, traditional cus-toms did link certain immortals to the earth and its powers that supportedlife and protected the dead. Public libations were made to Zeus, who over-saw oaths and protected the stranger who traveled far from his homeland;to Hades the Lord of the Dead, who lived under the earth with his queen;and to the ancient female deities Gaia and Demeter, whose influence ex-tended over the fertility of the land.

Some practicessacred to Demeter and Dionysus were among this latter class of rites, prac-tices frequently called “the mysteries.”This chapter will explore the worship of Demeter in Periclean Athens— the civic festivals, the women’s rites, and the Eleusinian mystery cult;chapter 6 will examine the related phenomena of Dionysian civic festivalsand mystery rites. Unlike Athena, whose monumental temples and publicaltars crowned the height of the Acropolis, Demeter was not always wor-shipped in the open. At her most important festivals, worshippers gatheredbehind closed doors or in exclusive groups far from the prying eyes of theunsympathetic and ill- informed.

The full account of this episode and itsaftermath will be discussed in chapters 5 and 7 below.Studying the worship of Demeter offers yet another route for tracing thegrowth of power in Athens. Traditional ancestral cults that started out asagrarian festivals grew in cultural and po liti cal importance over the genera-tions. Annual rites celebrated by citizen wives and sacred to the female god-dess of fertility were transformed to include all residents of the polis;eventu-ally anyone could attend regardless of their origins. Changing patterns ofworship in Demeter’s cults first reflected the synoecism of Attica; later, herrites marked the development of the Athenian empire. The revenue that theDelian League and the Athenian empire brought to the citizens of Athenstransformed many civic rites in the fifth century; as democracy and empiremingled together the demoscame to worship Athena in new ways at thePanathenaea, and the same holds true for festivals of Demeter as well.olympian myths and human familiesUnderstanding Athenian democracy and civic rites starts from a familiaritywith traditional tales of families and power. Myths about the Olympiandemeter102"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"gods in some ways reflected social relationships among humans and helpedoutline familiar gender roles and power dynamics. The Succession Mythpoints to one pattern, while stories of Demeter reveal another pattern ofpossible interaction. But the images reflected in the mythological traditiondid not provide consistent models for human society, and viewed togetherancestral tales can indicate the rough seams and internal contradictionswithin Greek culture. Athenian women were po liti cally powerless, but inother ways surprisingly powerful. This ambiguity was preserved in both themyths and the civic cults of the divine grain mother Demeter.Fatherhood occupied an elevated position in these tales about the com-plex divine family on Mount Olympus. There could be only one “fatherof gods and men,” the just and forceful heavenly patriarch who ruled overall, and this was Zeus. Divine motherhood was constructed in a differentand somewhat fragmented way. While Zeus was depicted as the principaldivine male consort with multiple wives and lovers who bore him count-less progeny, there were numerous goddesses who symbolically embodiedthe culturally defined feminine functions of sexuality, fertility, reproduc-tion, and motherhood. The archaic poet Hesiod wrote about the primor-dial goddess Earth, called Gaia or Ge, and how her authority was handedover to Rhea when Cronus defeated Uranus in the first episode of the Suc-cession Myth. In the third generation of immortals, ruled by Zeus, thegoddess of sexuality, Aphrodite, was completely separate from Hera andEileithyia, the goddesses of marriage and birth respectively. The goddesswho protected infants and young children, Artemis, was yet again separatefrom these, and moreover she was an eternal maiden, at home in the wildbut ever ignorant of erotic love. And all four of these goddesses were quitedistinct from the principal Olympian goddess of female fertility, Demeter.There was no single “mother of gods and men” who corresponded to Zeus,the divine father figure.While Zeus the father of gods and men was imagined as married, histwo most commonly recognized marriages were not particularly happyones. He annihilated his first consort, Metis (Cunning), when he learnedof a prophecy foretelling that she would give birth to Athena and then toa son destined to be greater than his father. Wise Zeus outwitted theprophecy by swallowing the pregnant Metis. Metis’s presence within Zeusprompted him to give birth to only one child— the favored daughterAthena, who burst forth from the head of her father fully grown and fullyarmed. Athena combined the cunning power of both her parents, and shecleverly remained unmarried and thus unable to betray her loyalty to thewomen and the eleusinian mysteries103"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"father of gods by pledging herself to another male and leaving her father’s house hold.Zeus’s more permanent consort, Hera, embodied the culturally definedqualities of the demanding and jealous wife. Given his countless affairswith numerous divine, semi- divine, and human partners (both male andfemale), Zeus gave Hera plenty of opportunities to express her jealous rage.Many of the more youthful Olympian deities, including Apollo, Artemis,and Dionysus, were the result of Zeus’s liaisons with especially beautifulmortal women. Hera the jealous wife was no model mother. She was onlyrarely celebrated and honored for her maternal qualities. In Homer she wasknown to ridicule her son Hephaestus, but the poets Homer and Hesiod were at odds as to whether Zeus was Hephaestus’s biological father. Theonly uniformly recognized male offspring of Zeus and Hera was Ares. It isperhaps not surprising that the famed god of war was the only certain le-gitimate son of the troubled marriage of Zeus and Hera. Ares was harshand fierce to the point of being considered nearly barbarian. He was thor-oughly hated by the other Olympians, and posed no threat to his father’sauthority.While Hera needed her husband Zeus to receive honors as divine con-sort, Demeter apparently had no need for a lawful husband to receive herworship as the divine and maternal giver of fertility. The very name Deme-ter appears to combine the Indo- European roots for “give” (df-) and“mother” (mater-), the latter related to the Greek meterand Latin mater.Some linguists have also suggested associating de-with the word for earth,ge,making Demeter literally mean “Earth Mother.” Demeter was in factthe prototype of the protective, selfless, and self- reliant single mother.Though she did share a child with Zeus, Zeus played only a marginal rolein his daughter’s upbringing. This daughter was named Persephone, ormore often simply Kore: the Maiden. The divine mother and maiden wereso closely associated with each other that in Athenian inscriptions and legaldecrees they were referred to as “the Two Goddesses” or, even more briefly,“the Two.” Likewise, in their plays tragic poets referred to Demeter andKore together as “the Two.”Long before the fifth century and the decrees of demo cratic Athens, theGreeks told myths that credited Demeter with teaching humans the civi-lizing gift of tilling the earth. Knowing how to cultivate cereal crops— barley, rye, and wheat— set humans apart from other animals and allowedmen and women to live together in settled communities. Human societyin the or ga nized towns and small cities of Greek antiquity relied on thedemeter104"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"gifts of Demeter, made visible through the fertility of the land and theabundance of the grain crops. Human society would decline and fall apartif the cereal crops were not harvested and stored so that they could sustainthe population at a later time.The most famous myth about Demeter, goddess of grain, was told in theHomeric Hymn to Demeter.Nearly as old as the Iliadand Odysseyand writ-ten in the same style and meter as the famous epics, this shorter poem de-scribes how the divine mother went into mourning when her young daugh-ter Kore was abducted by Hades, the god of the dead. Hades intended totake Kore as his wife with the full knowledge and consent of his brotherZeus, who was also Kore’s father. Demeter was left in the dark about theseplans for her daughter’s future, and in the poem Kore herself was entirelyunwilling to be separated from her young playmates and her mother.Neither Demeter nor Kore could die— they were after all deathlessOlympian deities— but after this betrayal at the hands of Zeus, each god-dess experienced a different sort of social, symbolic death. While Kore lan-guished in the underworld alongside Hades and refused to eat, Demeter castaside her identity as an immortal, and along with it all the proper honors andsacrificial gifts that belonged to Olympian gods and goddesses. Demetermourned her loss by taking on the identity of a homeless old woman namedDoso. Doso wandered into the town of Eleusis and sat down next to thetown well, where she found the only employment available to someone ofher social status and position in life. She became a nurse— in this case thenurse of the king’s infant son Demophoön. At night in secret the nurseDoso/Demeter placed the royal baby in a sacred fire, knowing that this ac-tion over time could transform the human child into an ageless and immor-tal god. Then she would have another child to replace her lost daughter. Thebaby flourished in the care of his new divine nurse.Metanira, the queen of Eleusis and the child’s mother, soon wonderedwhat the new nurse Doso was doing to make her child so healthy, so shespied on them one eve ning. Metanira caught the old woman placing theinfant Demophoön in the flames. In her alarm and anxiety the mortalmother rushed in and withdrew her son from the hearth. Demeter’s plansto make the human child immortal were thus thwarted, and she becameenraged. She revealed her awesome divinity to Metanira and the people ofEleusis, and commanded them to build her a temple and worship her for-ever. The anger and frustration of the mother Demeter now reached theirfull expression, and the goddess of fertility withheld her gifts from every-body she could, even from the deathless gods. Plants and fruits withered,women and the eleusinian mysteries105"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"famine fell upon the land, humans no longer honored the immortals withofferings at temples and altars. Man and beast both perished, and theOlympian gods grew concerned about their own future and the future ofthe earth.Zeus took action only when he realized how desperate the situation wasgrowing. He agreed to negotiate with Demeter, who demanded the returnof her daughter, even though he had already reached an agreement withHades. Zeus eventually brokered a new compromise between Hades andDemeter: Kore would spend part of the year with her mother, and the re-maining part with her husband in the underworld. Finally Demeter re-lented. The return of Kore and the reunion of the divine mother anddaughter at the temple in Eleusis brought fertility back to the earth andjoy back to the gods. Demeter celebrated in Eleusis by giving gifts to theEleusinian people, who had suffered alongside her during her time of greatloss. Demeter taught the young nobleman Triptolemus and other Eleusin-ian leaders how to celebrate her rites and mysteries, rites that would makeall initiates blessed and favored in the afterlife (figure 9). Demeter’s mys-teries would instruct mortals, taking the terror out of death by guarantee-ing initiates their share of good things in the underworld after they died.This myth demonstrates Demeter’s great power over the earth and indeedthe whole cosmos; the immortal gods depended on her continuing goodgraces to bestow fertility and abundance upon them, too. When droughtand famine fell upon the earth in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter,humansno longer had the resources to worship the Olympian deities. The lack ofsacrificial offerings made by humans threatened the very existence of thegods. Zeus and the other immortals could thrive only when humans regu-larly offered them sacrifices and honors at public altars. As the myth ofDemeter and Kore showed, the civic rites of thysiarelied on the gifts ofDemeter: humans fed surpluses of grain to their domesticated cows, whichthen were sacrificed at altars. Zeus may have been the father of gods andmen, but his position of heavenly leadership required the full cooperationand blessings of Demeter.In this traditional tale of the divine grain mother mourning her maidendaughter, the goddess set aside her true form and put on a social identitymirroring that of real, mortal women. According to normal Athenian so-cial customs, citizen women were expected to remain at home under theprotection and care of a male guardian, usually their father or husband.

Women kept the house hold runningsmoothly, while the men met together and managed the public realm ofthe polis.The daily life of most citizen women in Greece revealed a contradictionat the heart of this ancient society: although women possessed great powerwomen and the eleusinian mysteries107Figure 9.

On the one hand, Athenian women were expected to be largely invisible in public and po liti cal life; they re-mained at home while male citizens managed the polis.They were not cit-izens with voting rights in the ekklesiaand the courtrooms. On the otherhand, women were necessary to bear and nurture the next generation oflegitimate citizens, as Metanira bore the prince Demophoön. The integrityof family lineage and the rightful transfer of wealth and resources alongmale lines of descent depended on women, and on husbands’ confidencein their wives’ sexual fidelity.This circumstance gave women a kind of hidden power in the struc-tured society of classical Athens, and that power became even more sig-nificant during the fifth century. The Periclean citizenship laws passed in451/0 required of all Athenian citizens that both their father and motherbe recognized Athenian citizens. This law gave Athenian women a newstatus in the polis,and presented male citizens with new incentives formarrying well. The stability of Athenian society rested on the security of thefamily and the trustworthiness of its female citizens— unmarried maidendaughters as well as lawful, childbearing wives. Women were consideredfull citizens when it came to civic rites celebrating fertility, motherhood,and the family, and in this way women had a share in the common life ofthe polis.Even women past their childbearing years continued to shoulderthe responsibility of keeping Athens stable by helping to raise the nextgeneration of Athenian citizens, as the nurse Doso nurtured the child inthe myth.But the elevated status of citizen women in Athens after 451/0 high-lighted deeper divisions embedded in the practices of civic cult. When malecitizens of the polisgathered together for public occasions such as assem-blies, meetings, civic sacrifices, and feasts, women may not have been pres-ent in significant numbers, if at all. The ancestral traditions of thysiaandcivic feasts were intended to cement male bonds of citizenship, helping tocreate the male world of po liti cal community and social continuity. Eventoday scholars cannot agree at all on how often women appeared in publicin ancient Athens— the evidence goes both ways. When the pro cession atthe annual Panathenaea celebrated the public self- image of the Atheniandemos,citizens, foreigners, and animals filed through the heart of the cityand ascended the steps of the Acropolis. There male priests and magistratesperformed the central public rituals and dedicated gifts from the polisat thealtar of Athena next to the Parthenon, and there male magistrates slaugh-demeter108"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"tered bulls for the civic banquet. Meat was distributed in their demesamong male citizens, who then shared their portions with their house holds.Though images on Attic vases and the Parthenon frieze do depict youngwomen in the pro cession carry ing the sacred basket, women are not visu-ally represented as often as men, and our literary sources do not clearly andconsistently indicate whether women were present at public civic feasts inlarge numbers. Analysis of skeletal bones found in graves provides evidencethat females suffered from malnutrition more frequently than men. A fewselect girls and young women at the Panathenaea may have manufacturedthe peplosof Athena and presented it to her, but the story commemoratedby the peplositself recalled the subordinate position of women in Atheniansociety. The images woven into Athena’s robe celebrated the Olympians’decisive victory over the forces of chaos— a victory led by the paradigmaticmale and paternal figure, Zeus. Even when the commanding female figureAthena was at the center of attention, as she was at the Panathenaea, herpower served to support the male patriarch. Athena’s festival enshrined thestandard social order of Athens.Some festivals of Demeter did not fit this model. Like the Panathenaea,the chief civic festivals of Demeter were or ga nized and funded by the po-lis,but their celebrations completely suspended the normal social orderand the po liti cal and social hierarchies that defined typical Athenian soci-ety. Athenian women mirrored Demeter and Metanira in the myth whenthey celebrated the Demeter festival called the Thesmophoria. Womensuddenly became more than simply visible in the public sphere; they exer-cised considerable power in the polis.At the Eleusinian Mysteries, Athe-nian wives, together with foreigners and slaves of both sexes, were treatedmuch the same as Athenian- born citizen males.

There on the open grassy slope be-neath the Acropolis, Athenian women set up camp for themselves and con-ducted their own civic rites of the Thesmophoria.

All evidence indicatesthat the official proceedings of the women gathered together in the autumnnear the Agora were much tamer than the men supposed.This same scene of women leaving home and congregating at all- femalefestival sites was repeated in demes all over Attica, and indeed in cities andtowns all over the Greek world. The civic festival called the Thesmophoriacelebrated the goddess Demeter and her gift to humankind: the knowl-edge of how to cultivate the earth and sow grain. The Thesmophoria wasin fact the single most widespread of all Greek festivals, and probably oneof the oldest. Among the common threads for the ancestral communalrites was the uniform exclusion of men. The heart of this civic festivaltook place in caves and alongside crevices and holes dug deep into theearth. These pits called megaraare today still found in many of the Deme-ter sanctuaries in the eastern Mediterranean basin. Throughout Hellaspriestesses of Demeter stood at the edge of the pits, and as other womenlooked on they lowered terra- cotta pots down into them to scoop out theholy contents: fertile soil mixed with plant matter and bloody, decompos-ing piglets. After the sacred compost was combined with seed and depositedon two altars, one for Demeter and the other for her daughter Persephone,the women sat down to a great state- funded feast.The ancient customs of the Thesmophoria provide further evidence forhow activities that in today’s world are typically labeled religious lay at theheart of civic life in Socrates’ and Pericles’ Athens. Some today might evencall the civic rituals involving seed, soil, and pig’s blood “primitive” or“magical,” but those terms do not adequately capture the social dynamicsthat created real meaning for those who honored and maintained the age- old rites of Demeter. The official Athenian calendar noted at least a dozencivic festivals in honor of Demeter every year. One cluster of these festi-vals, attested especially in the calendars of rural demes, revolved aroundthe cultivation of the grain crops: the Chloia, the Antheia, the Kalamaia,the Proerosia, and the Procharisteria. These five relatively minor festivals were spread throughout the agricultural year, from autumn pre- plowingdemeter110"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"rites (the Proerosia) to festivals that marked the gradual maturing of thecrops in the spring (the Chloia, the Antheia, the Procharisteria, and theKalamaia). The cultivation of the fields from sowing to reaping occupiedthe men of rural Attica, and male priests appear to have played a big rolein these festivals for Demeter in her role as corn mother.But the worship of Demeter the fertility goddess carried further mean-ing for women throughout the Greek world. While men participated inthose festivals that corresponded to their labor in the fields, ancestralnomoiexplicitly excluded male citizens from attending other civic rites sa-cred to Demeter, including the Haloa, the Scira, the Stenia, and the Thes-mophoria. At the Haloa in midwinter, women and men were pointedlysegregated for their great feasts: the women celebrated all night long insidea temple, and the men celebrated in a courtyard outdoors. The Scira inearly summer and Stenia in the autumn likewise required citizen womento offer sacrifices to Demeter and Kore in rites that excluded the maledemos.In Attica the women’s festival of the Thesmophoria was celebratedin Pyanopsion, roughly corresponding to October; other poleisnearby ob-served the festival a few weeks earlier, in Boedromion. During this part ofthe autumn the weather was still warm and fine, and the seasonal tasks inthe rural countryside were not too demanding for either women or men.In Athens the Thesmophoria was the most important of the civic festi-vals for Demeter that excluded the male demos.Because it was an officialstate holiday all the regular assemblies and courts of male citizens werecanceled, and all official state business was suspended until the end of thethird day. Archaeologists have not yet unearthed a par tic u lar Atheniansanctuary called the Thesmophorion; in the city, citizen wives could havemet near the Eleusinion, a hillside sanctuary along the Sacred Way be-tween the Agora and the Acropolis. Another theory holds that the Thes-mophorion was located on the slopes of the hill called the Pnyx, a promi-nent landmark in the southwest quarter of the city that normally served asthe outdoor meeting place for the regular Assembly of male citizens, theekklesia.For three days the women met together and camped outdoors, wor-shipping the goddess of fertility and enjoying each other’s company. Fromall accounts it was an occasion that the citizen women looked forward toall year.The myth of the Two Goddesses played a central role in the rituals of theThesmophoria. The main narrative that rec ords the rape and marriage ofKore, the grief of Demeter, and the eventual reunion of mother and daugh-ter corresponded to the final two days of the three- day Thesmophoria, whilewomen and the eleusinian mysteries111"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the opening day had a strong po liti cal and civic meaning. The first day ofrites was called the Anodos, or the Path Up, presumably because on this daythe women of Athens left their homes and took a path up to the hillsidesanctuary where the civic rites would take place. They brought along withthem any equipment they would need for the next few days— food, cookingutensils, and bedding. They slept in huts or shelters that they built them-selves, so we can imagine them also toting along what ever materials theywould need to construct their camps. Because the weather was still warmand dry at that time of year, there would have been no great need for sturdyor waterproof shelter. The whole pro cess of encampment required a gooddeal of or ga ni za tion, and two women from each deme were elected “lead-ers,” archousai,to manage the complex three- day festival. The rare feminineform of this title imitates the more common masculine word archontes,themale magistrates and leaders of the Athenian demos.The designation ar-chousaiin effect made the annual all- female Thesmophoria an alternative assembly— an officially sanctioned gathering that mirrored the activities ofthe normal male po liti cal gatherings.The second day was a day of mourning and fasting, the Nesteia. Someof the more significant rituals apparently took place on this day. Keepingin mind the story of the Two Goddesses, the women in essence imitatedthe mourning of Demeter, who according to myth came to live in Atticaafter learning that her maiden daughter Kore had been abducted by Hades.In the Homeric Hymn,as noted above, Demeter disguised herself and tookon the form of Doso, the older mortal woman who came to Eleusis andfound employment as a servant in the house of a local noble. Since even inher mortal disguise the goddess Demeter was still privately mourning theloss of her immortal daughter, she observed the human customs ofmourning; in the HymnDemeter wore shabby clothing, fasted, and sat ona simple stool low to the ground that indicated her inferior status in the house hold of her new human masters. The Athenian women at the Thes-mophoria likewise mourned and fasted, sitting directly on the earth. Somesources indicate that worshippers sat on woven mats made of plantsthought to dampen the female sexual drive and restrict a woman’s fertility.These ritual actions were done in a spirit of gloom and sadness, like thatof Demeter mourning the loss of her daughter at Eleusis.In the myth Demeter was eventually re united with her daughter and shethen joyfully restored fertility to the earth. The restoration of the relation-ship between Mother and Daughter was commemorated on the third dayof the Thesmophoria— the Kalligeneia, the day of Beautiful Birth. Ondemeter112"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"this final day of the festival, Athenian women broke their fast and madespecial offerings to the goddess at altars in her sanctuary. Pigs and piglets were Demeter’s favorite animal votive, and piglet offerings played an es-sential role here. Earlier in the summer the city’s priestesses of Demeterhad prepared for the Thesmophoria by placing offerings in a nearby cavesacred to the goddesses. Whole piglets were sacrificed and deposited inmegaranear the cave well in advance of the Thesmophoria, along withplant matter from pine trees. Special cakes formed in the shape of phal-luses and snakes were thrown into the pits along with the piglets, and the whole mixture was left to rot. Snakes and phalluses had clear connotationsof male fertility; by adding them to the bloody piglets, the priestesses sym-bolically restored the fertility of the soil after Demeter’s loss, mourning,and withdrawal from life. On the day of Kalligeneia, women designated as“bailers” returned to the megarachambers and bailed out the decomposedbut fertile goop from the pits. The mixture was then placed on the altarsof Demeter and Kore in the sanctuary and dedicated to them. The powerof the goddess of fertility made the muck extra fertile, and later in the fallthe sanctified compost was mixed with seed, then sown with the winterwheat in a separate civic ritual.The association between female reproductive sexuality and the fertility ofthe soil was celebrated almost concretely in Athens at the Thesmophoria.Demeter was a female goddess, the goddess of grain and the fertility of theearth; the Western tradition still speaks of the earth as feminine and moth-erly rather than paternal and protective (i.e., culturally identifiable as mas-culine). To this day the earth is anthropomorphized as Mother Earth andMother Nature, as though it were a human mother common to us all. Thecultivation of the earth had additional associations that were consideredculturally feminine among the peoples living in Greece and the ancientMediterranean basin, who were not long removed from the great shift inhuman history from nomadic subsistence to settled communities. AncientMediterranean mythologies and rituals often reflected the effects of thischange on their societies, and the dynamics captured in myth used gender toexpress larger social changes in familiar and concrete terms. The more do-mestic pursuits of agriculture became culturally feminine, while the rougherlifestyle of the nomadic hunter who ranged over a wild and untamed wilder-ness was considered culturally masculine; thus as unmarried goddess of thehunt, Artemis had power that was culturally defined as masculine.Some memory of these transitions to settled farming persisted symboli-cally in the worship of Demeter among the Athenians and other Greekwomen and the eleusinian mysteries113"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"peoples. The Greeks looked to their own experience of the human life cy-cle, and mapped their experiences of cultivating the soil onto their under-standing of human fertility. The earth was thought to be like a woman’swomb: it nurtured the seed necessary for life. Ancient peoples saw farmersbroadcasting seed—sperma—over the rich soil of ancestral lands just as aman cast his seed in the productive womb of his lawful wife. In both in-stances the farmer expected a return that would support him in the future.Harvested grain could either be ground immediately for bread or be stored— even for many years— and used later to support the communityduring a famine. Likewise children would grow up to shoulder the re-sponsibility of caring for aging parents. As the seed absorbed a culturallydefined masculine resonance, the soil cultivated for growing grain came tohave explicit feminine, sexual meanings. Oedipus in Sophocles’ Oedipusthe Kingfamously lamented that he had plowed the same furrows that hisfather had, and one formula attested for betrothals in Athens explicitlymade the connection between soil and women: “I give you her (my daugh-ter) for the plowing of legitimate children” (Menander Perikeiromene1013and Dyskolos842).Working from these hints in the mythic tradition and drawing fromother fragmentary evidence, scholars speculate about what happened at theThesmophoria. But their guesses can only go so far, and the fact remainsthat most aspects of the women’s worship of Demeter at the Thesmopho-ria remained secret from the men of Athens. Men in antiquity were alwayssuspicious of any meeting that excluded them, and their ideas about whathappened at the Thesmophoria illustrate this suspicion. Some of Aristo-phanes’ comedies produced in Athens in the late fifth century mention thealleged wild drunkenness and sexual promiscuity of female citizens intheir worship of Demeter during the three- day festival of the Thesmopho-ria. Such a prurient image may simply reflect the overactive imaginationsof Athenian men. One of the more plausible and reliable historical ac-counts of women’s behavior at this festival relates that the citizen wives satwith their genitals directly in contact with the earth. In such a sympatheticrite, Athenian women were apparently hoping to absorb into their ownbodies the fertility of Demeter and the earth itself. Or perhaps their hu-man fertility helped restore Demeter when she was in mourning.The per sis tent suspicions of Athenian men point to one of the more cu-rious aspects of the Thesmophoria: Athenian residents probably viewedand experienced the festival very differently, depending on their own sexand social location. The three- day autumn festival may well have consti-demeter114"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"tuted a hardship for the adult men of Athens. Without their mothers,wives, and daughters to run the house hold, men were left home alone tolook after the children and slaves and keep things running smoothly. Per-haps this is another reason why all public state business, including thecourts and the Assembly of male citizens, was suspended for the durationof the festival. Men, who were quite accustomed to living, working, andsocializing with their citizen peers in the public realm of the polis,had ataste of their wives’ more restricted domestic existence for a few days.Meanwhile, Athenian wives had a break from the routines of house workand enjoyed each other’s company at state expense. They probably returnedhome from the day of Beautiful Birth relaxed and cheerful. It is little wonder,then, that the men, unable to pursue their normal occupations and per-haps cooped up in the house for three days, imagined their wives drinkingand otherwise living it up.The celebration of the Thesmophoria throughout Greece existed long be-fore the reforms of Cleisthenes and well before the unification of Attica, andover time it achieved an esteemed place in the poliscalendar of fifth- centuryAthenian festivals. These ancient rites honoring the fertility of the earth de-manded the complete separation of male and female, and they privileged theknowledge that women carried in this culture. Although the Thesmophoriawas not a mystery rite, it did share something important with the mysteryreligion at Eleusis: namely, the par tic u lar focus on being female in ancientHellas. The Eleusinian Mysteries also acknowledged the deep connectionsto the earth’s resources maintained by females— divine and human— inGreek culture. Ritual customs recognized the renewal of life in the culti-vated fields of grain and in the family. Ancestral traditions constructed a ho-mology between the land and the human body, and then extended it to thefate of the individual. The Greek idea of the soul differed significantly fromwhat it would become following the development of Christianity. The after-life of the soul was not tied to an individual’s moral behavior, but there wasinterest in the fate of the person in the underworld. From its humble begin-nings in the rural landscape of Greece, the powerful rites of Demeter wouldsoon attract worshippers from throughout the Mediterranean.the eleusinian mysteriesThe rituals of polissacrifice and thysiadescribed in chapter 2 nourished thecitizen body, but the mystery rites of Demeter articulated other more hiddenaspects of lived human experience.

Citizens and foreigners alike were expected to take part incivic festivals that featured prominent rituals of animal sacrifice and the sub-sequent feasting at public expense, as in Athens everyone attended the Pana-thenaea during the summer and Athenian women attended the Thesmopho-ria in the fall. While the civic rites of thysiaand cultic democracy celebratedthose relationships that sustained the polisand its citizens as a collectivegroup, the polytheistic traditions of ancient Greece also included anothertype of civic rite that supported worshippers as individuals who can experi-ence fear, awe, wonder, and joy. These sorts of rites were voluntary: men andwomen chose to become initiates. Such elective rites illustrated one way thatancestral nomoimade room for the interests of the person within the largerpoliscommunity. Even when the institution of the classical polislater gaveway to the Hellenistic and Roman empires, initiatory cults remained a pow-erful force in ancient Mediterranean societies.Fifth- century Athenians worshipped Demeter in both ways: at publiccivic festivals and with rites of initiates. The voluntary rites sacred toDemeter were celebrated out of the public eye— behind closed doors andunder the cover of night. In modern times these forms of elective worshiphave come to be grouped together into what scholars often misleadinglycall “the mystery religions.” The mystery religions of Greco- Roman an-tiquity were not obscure, strange, or puzzling, and their rituals were hardlydistinct from those associated with other civic rites and festivals. Mysteryrites were actually quite common and pop u lar forms of voluntary religiouspractice in the ancient world. Attendance at public feasts was required forcitizens in any ancient Greek polis,for participating in thysiasignaledmembership in the body politic. But a citizen or indeed any resident of apoliscould make the deeply personal decision to undergo an initiation cere-mony and join a voluntary group dedicated to the worship of Demeter orDionysus. These mystery rites, called orgia,supplemented the obligatorytraditions of civic sacrifice to the Olympian gods; choosing to participatein the mystery cults of Demeter and Dionysus sent a different social andpo liti cal message.In the cultural context of fifth- century Athens, the term “mysteries”very often referred to one par tic u lar group of elective rites sacred to Deme-ter in Attica: the ancient mysteriaof Eleusis. Those who chose to partici-pate in this worship were initiated into the mysteries; an initiate intoDemeter’s elective rites was called a mystes.Our sources make it clear thatdemeter116"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"throughout the centuries, countless Greeks and foreigners came to Atticato be initiated into the mysteries of Demeter at Eleusis. By the time ofPericles and Socrates, anyone who spoke the Greek language and was nota murderer was allowed to participate in the annual mystic rites—“mystic”fr o m mystikos,related to Demeter’s mysteria.Although the Eleusinian rites were the most famous in Greek and Roman antiquity, Attica was not theonly poliswith mysteries sacred to Demeter, and voluntary associations sa-cred to other deities also inducted initiates into their ranks of worshippers.Mystic rites holy to Dionysus were celebrated throughout Hellas, andmysteries sacred to all the Olympians were also observed on the island ofSamothrace.The rites of Demeter and Dionysus remained influential throughoutantiquity, far outliving Athens and its fifth- century empire. The popular-ity of the Greek- style mystery cults continued to grow steadily during theHellenistic and Roman periods. At the height of Roman imperial domi-nance of the Mediterranean in the first and second centuries ce,mysteries were celebrated for other gods, too: non- Greek deities such as the Egypt-ian goddess Isis, the Anatolian goddess Cybele, and the semi- Persian godMithras. Most instances of Greco- Roman “mystery religions” at their coreresembled the famous Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter, and the later Hel-lenistic and Roman mystery rites were loosely patterned after the tradi-tional Athenian rites of Demeter and Dionysus as celebrated in Attica inthe fifth century. Personal experiences of mystery rites were so commonin the first and second centuries cethat the earliest Greek- speaking au-thors of the Christian Gospels and New Testament letters chose to writeabout the “mysteries” of their own new movement when they addressedtheir audience of potential converts—Greek- speaking inhabitants in theeastern end of the Mediterranean basin.The actual town of Eleusis lay 14 miles to the northwest of Athens. TodayEleusis is situated near oil refineries, industrial depots, and a concreteplant, but in the fifth century Eleusis was a small coastal town on the bayof Salamis near Attica’s border with Megara, midway between the com-mercial centers of Athens and Corinth. The town had a small defensiblehill or acropolis called the Akris, and in antiquity the town was built upalong an elevated ridge just west of it. The fertile plain below the ridge andacropolis had been under cultivation for many centuries. The settlementof Eleusis had been walled, possibly in the Mycenaean period, and cer-tainly it was well fortified after it became an Attic border town. Fortifica-tions continued to be enlarged throughout antiquity.

By the seventh cen-tury, Attica had or ga nized itself under the leadership of Athens and thetown of Eleusis was absorbed into the larger polis.The Mysteries ofDemeter were already taking place at this time in the small hillside sanctu-ary. The earliest secure archaeological record for a sanctuary at the sitedates perhaps to the Geometric period of the eighth century; althoughsome scholars maintain that the cult of Demeter was celebrated as early asthe twelfth century, we have no clear evidence that any of the Mycenaeanremains are related to the worship of Demeter. In the seventh and earlysixth centuries the Mysteries were a largely local celebration of Demeteror ga nized by two local priestly families, the Kerykes and the Eumolpidae.The earliest known temple was modest, to say the least: a walled shrine en-closing a courtyard and a small roofed temple building with an open por-tico across the front.Once the town of Eleusis was absorbed into the polisof Attica, theAthenians strengthened the town’s defenses and took control of the localcults, too. Although the details are not clear to modern scholars, Athenianleaders made the local Eleusinian rites of Demeter an official part of thecivic calendar while keeping the local priesthoods intact in Eleusis. Theearliest Athenian law code, the code of Solon from the early sixth century,mentions the role of the boulein the oversight of the official civic cult ofEleusinian Demeter. Following the synoecism of Attica, the Athenianschose not to move the temple and the entire annual festival to Athens itself— after all, the myth recounted how Demeter had once visited thetown of Eleusis and instructed the locals to build her temple there on thehillside. The residents of Athens instead did the next best thing: they es-tablished a sanctuary in Athens called the Eleusinion, and appointed Athe-nian priests and magistrates in the main city while Eleusinian priests re-mained in control at the shrine in Eleusis. Like the original precinct inEleusis, the Athenian sanctuary of the Eleusinion was situated on a hillside— on the north shoulder of the Athenian Acropolis, between theAcropolis and the Agora.After the Mysteries of Demeter became an official festival in the Athe-nian civic calendar, the Athenians needed to enlarge the temple and sanc-tuary in Eleusis to accommodate the increasing number of worshippers.demeter118"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Starting in the seventh century we can trace the steady development of thesanctuary and the main temple, which came to be called the Telesterion,or Hall of Initiation. Their size was increased once in the seventh century,and twice in the sixth century. The tyrant Pisistratus took a strong interestin the cult, and he was responsible for a significant expansion of theTelesterion that required further enlargements of the man- made terrace,as well as the construction of new walls that surrounded the Telesterion,courtyards, and other buildings that came to be included in the sanctuary.Pisistratus also re oriented the main gate of the sanctuary, moving it fromsoutheast (facing the sea) to the northeast, where it joined the Sacred Way— the road to Athens.Twice more in the fifth century the polisundertook improvements atEleusis; the first of these fifth- century renovations was never completed,though, since construction coincided with the Persian Wars and the Per-sian army broke through a section of the walls in 480. Once the Persians were defeated and had retreated from Attica, the Athenians returned toEleusis to repair the walls and make them even taller and thicker. Theyalso took this opportunity to move some of the defensive walls and extendthe terraces in front of the ruined Telesterion. The financial pressures ofrebuilding the city of Athens after the Persian invasions caused a delay inthe reconstruction of the Telesterion, but the renovations were eventuallycompleted. The final restoration was accomplished around 435 under theleadership of Pericles, at the very height of Athens’ imperial aspirations.The archaeological record indicates that in every period, the heart of theEleusinian sanctuary remained a small building called the Anaktoron,probably the original roofed building in the earliest walled sanctuary. TheAnaktoron was contained within the temple: each successive enlargementof the temple kept this one small room as its focal point. By the time thepolishad finished the renovations under Pericles, the Eleusinian Teleste-rion was the largest roofed building in the Greek world. It was a squarebuilding (about 165 by 165 feet) with a modest exterior and a simple por-tico across the front looking out over a large courtyard to the east. The in-side of the Telesterion was most unusual: at the very center in a wide andopen space stood the smaller Anaktoron. Along all four interior walls ofthe Telesterion ascending rows of benches were built parallel to the walls,like bleachers in a gymnasium or rows of seats in a theater- in- the- round.The whole Telesterion was covered with a high roof; since Greek engi-neers had not yet figured out how to design structures using an arch ordome, the roof had to be supported by rows of pillars—forty- two in all.women and the eleusinian mysteries119"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Archaeologists who study this building have estimated that upwards of8,000 people could have fit inside it.

Because Eleusinian initiates were forbidden to talk about what they did, saw, or heard during the cele-bration of the mysteries, precisely what they experienced and learnedwhile inside the Telesterion and the Anaktoron remains secret. Somescholars have linked the nouns myesis(initiation) and mysteria(the myster-ies) with the verb myein,“to close” the mouth or eyes. Initiates who didn’tkeep their mouths properly shut might disclose the secrets of the holyrites. Those who did disclose the secrets could be charged with impiety,asebeia,and prosecuted in court. Some ancient sources record that famousfigures from the fifth century, among them the phi los o pher Diagorasof Melos and the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, defended themselves onimpiety charges after being accused of revealing the mysteries to theuninitiated.Although the written rec ords from ancient Athens do not document theproceedings at Eleusis, scholars can establish some facts about the fifth- century Eleusinian Mysteries by analyzing the archaeological record: theplan of the sanctuary, inscriptions, and iconographic evidence from sculp-ture and vase painting. We know, for instance, that the festival was held inthe early autumn, in the middle of the month of Boedromion about amonth before the Thesmophoria was celebrated in Athens. The Mysterieslasted an unusually long time for a Greek festival: a full seven days, fromthe 15th to the 21st of Boedromion. We also know that men, women,slaves, and foreigners were initiated together in the Telesterion, makingthe cult’s tradition unusually egalitarian.Before the seven- day festival of the Mysteries began in Boedromion,other preliminary rituals prepared initiates for the festival. Individualswho intended to be initiated at the Eleusinian Telesterion in the fall wererequired to take part in rites called the Lesser Mysteries in the late spring.The Lesser Mysteries seem to have involved some sort of ritual of purifi-cation, but we know little about them. At the collective level there werealso important civic preparations in Athens and abroad: spondophoroi,rep-resentatives from the priestly Eleusinian families of the Eumolpidae andthe Kerykes, traveled as diplomats to Greek cities throughout the Mediter-ranean to invite all people to take part in the rites and to announce thedemeter120"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"sacred truce (spondai) that went into effect for the festival. This sacredtruce lasted nearly two months— enough time for men and women fromall over Hellas to safely travel to Eleusis and back home again. By traditionthe sacred truce also marked the cessation of any ongoing military cam-paigns.The number of people who chose to attend the Eleusinian Mysteries inany given year was substantial. Herodotus, for instance, reports 30,000, buthis numbers are often grossly inflated. According to ancestral tradition, aperson had to attend the Eleusinian Mysteries only once during his or herlifetime to receive the full benefit of Demeter’s blessing. But we know thatsome people did go more than once. Each initiate or mysteswas escorted onthe journey to Eleusis by an experienced guide called a mystagfgos,or mysta-gogue. A mystagogue was someone who had already been initiated at leastonce before, and she or he would remain with the new initiate to explain andguide him or her through all the rituals. Also taking part in the Mysteries were initiates who had attended at least once before and were going again asepoptai,or “watchers,” who would be initiated into the higher level of theMysteries. The crowd had to have been quite large, composed as it was of first- time initiates, their mystagogue escorts, and finally the epoptaiand anyothers who chose for their own personal reasons to attend again.Because Athens and Eleusis were located at a distance from each otherand because the priests involved were in both towns, the Athenian civicfestival of the Eleusinian Mysteries entailed a certain amount of travelingback and forth across the countryside of Attica. Before the official start ofthe festival, a civic pro cession wended its way from Eleusis to Athens onthe 14th of Boedromion. A group of ephebes, the Athenian young mentraining in the military, was selected to ride on horse back alongside awagon that brought the priests and priestesses of Demeter to Athens. Sa-cred cult objects that normally resided in Eleusis, presumably in the Anak-toron, had to be transferred to Athens for the start of the festival, and itwas the responsibility of Eleusinian priestesses to carry special basketscalled kistaithat contained the sacred objects to the Eleusinion in the cen-ter of Athens. The ephebes kept everyone and everything safe. Once thepro cession reached the walls of the Eleusinion in Athens, the officials fromEleusis were welcomed by the local Athenian civic- religious officials. A sa-cred messenger was dispatched from the Eleusinion to the Acropolis, wherehe informed the priestess of Athena that the priests and priestesses ofDemeter had arrived. In this way Eleusinian Demeter was welcomed intothe city of Athena.women and the eleusinian mysteries121"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The festival officially began on the 15th of Boedromion, the day of themonth that marked the full moon (every month in the Athenian calendarbegan with the new moon).

This day when all the participants convened in Athens wascalled the day of Gathering. The archfn basileus,the Athenian civic officialresponsible for all matters of cult and worship, accompanied the Eleusin-ian officials to the Painted Stoa in the Agora. There the Eleusinian sacredherald made the official proclamation inviting people to take part in theMysteries. Eligibility was taken seriously, but the criteria were not de-manding: to take part in the initiations you had to be able to understandGreek, and you had to have pure hands— that is, be free from the taint ofmurder. Perhaps initiates registered on this day, and paid the required feethat went to the various priests and covered the purchase of sacrificial ani-mals. In the fifth century the fee was 15 drachmas, which amounted toabout fifteen days’ wages for the average laborer or craftsman. This fee washigh in comparison to other civic festivals, but the Eleusinian initiationwas a voluntary association and not a festival required of all citizens. And,as noted above, initiates needed to go only once during their lifetime toachieve the desired benefit.Because being initiated into Demeter’s Mysteries was considered an un-usually sacred event, initiates were required to undergo special rituals ofpurification, and they took care of these on the next several days of thefestival. The 16th was called Elasis, the day of the “drive” or the “ride.”Each initiate was given a piglet, and together the initiates took their pigletson a ritual outing to the ocean. Ancestral tradition required initiates to pu-rify themselves and their sacrificial victims in the sea. Athens was ofcourse not far from the Aegean, and initiates walked or rode in carriagesand wagons to one of several beaches located near Athens— usually to theBay of Phaleron, south of the city. This had to have been a day of fun andmerrymaking as thousands of men and women purified themselves andtheir piglets at the ocean. Special officials were assigned the task of direct-ing traffic, which on this day would fill the roads between Athens and thecoast beyond capacity. After the purification rituals the initiates and theirescorts returned to the city, where they sacrificed their piglets and dinedon a meal of tender roast pork.The 17th was likewise a day of purification and preparation, but on thecollective rather than the individual level.

This myth of the tardy Asclepius actually masks a more com-plicated po liti cal situation that emerged during the Peloponnesian War. In420/19, immediately after Nicias had negotiated a truce with Sparta, Athensstrengthened its po liti cal and religious relationship with Epidaurus by of-ficially importing the cult of the healing god Asclepius. The god’s arrivalin the city happened in Boedromion just as the celebrations of the Mys-teries were starting in Athens. The tragic poet Sophocles was said to haveplayed a public role in welcoming the new god to Athens, and Asclepius’scult was temporarily housed in the city Eleusinion until a more permanentsanctuary could be built. By connecting the new god from Epidaurus withthe Demeter festival that was being observed, Athenians could assign toDemeter the same sort of protective role that Athens imagined for itself asit managed its empire and alliances.Finally, on the 19th of Boedromion there was the grand pompe,the reli-gious pro cession of all the participants with their wagons and pack ani-mals. The entire body of priests, magistrates, foreign delegations, ephebes,epoptai, first- time initiates, and their mystagogue escorts assembled inAthens at the Sacred Gate in the Kerameikos district. Hundreds and hun-dreds of initiates, many of them crowned with myrtle or carry ing branchesand staffs bound with myrtle, walked and rode along the Sacred Way outof the city and into the countryside of Attica. Again the ephebes protectedthe Athenian and Eleusinian officials as they rode along; priestesses againaccompanied the sacred cult objects borne in the kistaibaskets. The 14- mile journey took them through rolling farmlands, along the foot of thelocal mountains, and finally along the sea to Eleusis. The entire pro cessionmoved slowly uphill over the first half of the journey to the pass where themonastery of Daphni stands today, and from there down onto the fertileThriasian plain. It reached Eleusis in the eve ning, and stopped at a publicwomen and the eleusinian mysteries123"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"courtyard outside the sanctuary walls at the end of the Sacred Way. In thisbroad open area stood civic altars sacred to all the gods of Athens, and awell said to be the one by which Demeter sat when she first reached Eleu-sis disguised as the old women Doso.A gate in the walls of the Eleusinian sanctuary separated the public spacewith the civic altars and a well on the outside from the space sacred toDemeter on the inside. Only initiates were allowed through the gates andinto the interior courtyards and spaces that surrounded the Telesterion. Af-ter the pro cession arrived in the eve ning the party atmosphere continued,with singing and dancing by torchlight under the moon. Those who hadprocured lodging in the area settled in, while the rest of the crowd pitchedcamps in the area outside the walls of the sanctuary. The party undoubt-edly lasted long into the night under the bright waning moon.During the day of the 20th of Boedromion, participants rested aftertheir long walk and their arrival celebrations, and they may well have fastedor observed at least a partial fast. The initiates undoubtedly took it easy, ifrest was possible in their state of excitement and anticipation, for the maininitiation happened after sunset and the revelation of the Mysteries of Deme-ter went late into the night. Come eve ning, when the torches had been lit,the mystagogues led the way and escorted the initiates through the gates ofthe sanctuary and into the Telesterion. The epoptai(watchers) entered, too,and once inside the great Telesterion the Mysteries unfolded.What exactly happened during the night of the Mysteries has remainedfor centuries precisely that: one of the great mysteries of antiquity. Scholarscan glean hints here and there from the sources, but for much they mustrely on conjecture and speculation. For instance, we know that the contentof the Mysteries was imparted in three different ways: there were “thingsdone,” “things said,” and “things shown.” The head priest from the familyof the Eumolpidae was called the hierophant, or “the one who reveals thesacred things.” He was perhaps seated on a throne situated next to the doorto the Anaktoron, where the most sacred objects were likely stored. Somescholars have even proposed that the hierophant was seated on top of theAnaktoron, which could have served as a sort of stage. Other priests andpriestesses must have helped him during the course of the eve ning. Onechild initiate was honored each year as the “child at the hearth,” perhaps asymbolic substitute for Demophoön at Eleusis, or perhaps a representativeof the rite that took place at the public hearth in the Prytaneion in Athens.The Telesterion itself is a unique building, and it certainly was designed(and enlarged over the years) to allow all worshippers to watch what wasdemeter124"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"happening at the center of the massive room. At the very climax of theMysteries there was said to have been a great flash of blinding light.Another known bit of information about the rites in the Telesterion isthat early in the eve ning worshippers drank a special drink called the kykefn,a thick concoction made of water, meal, mint, and other herbs. A few schol-ars have speculated that the meal used in the drink might have been taintedwith ergot, a fungus that grows naturally on stored cereal products that be-come damp. Ergot can be fatal when ingested in large doses, but in smalldoses it can facilitate mild hallucinogenic experiences. No direct evidenceproves that epoptaiand initiates did consume ergot or other drugs, but schol-ars have not entirely ruled out that possibility.Scholars can be sure of other facts, too, when they study the EleusinianMysteries. The Mysteries were first and foremost sacred to Demeter. Per-haps the initiates felt that they experienced the same things that Demeterwent through when she first lost and then was re united with her daughter.If we assume that some motifs present in the myth and the Homeric Hymnto Demetersomehow corresponded to the initiation rite, then myth andmystery together reveal an ancient Greek foundational narrative for a hu-man being’s experience of the divine. Demeter was at one time livingamong the other divinities, but then separated herself from them afterDeath, or the god Hades, forcibly took her daughter Kore away to live withhim in the underworld. She nursed the child Demophoön, perhaps repre-sented in cult by the child initiate “at the hearth.” The divine mother becameenraged, and then she mourned, but in the end she rejoined her beloveddaughter. Kore accepted her dual role as the maiden daughter of Demeterand the wife of Hades. Some have speculated that the Mysteries includeda ritual of sacred marriage (hieros gamos) between Kore and the god ofdeath. The myth, the Hymn,and the rites all illustrate a human journey ofseparation from and eventual reunion with the divine, as Demeter andKore are re united with each other and with the deities on Mount Olympusafter Persephone’s return from the underworld. To commemorate the re-union with her daughter, Demeter taught Triptolemus and the humans atEleusis how to sow crops, as well as how to celebrate her Mysteries. Knowl-edge of these mystic rites could give solace to humans as they worshippedthe Two, gave thanks for the gifts of Demeter, and accepted their ownmortality and eventual union with Hades and the divine. Completing theMysteries made initiates blessed.A broad range of the female experience was represented in the mythol-ogy surrounding Demeter and Kore: girls, young brides, spirited mothers,women and the eleusinian mysteries125"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"and older nurses all figured prominently in the narrative. The full spec-trum of social status was also present in the myth, from the lowest (home-less slave and foreign servant) to the highest (queen and goddess). Gen-dered power relationships are evident, and clearly inverted: the femaletakes the leading role both in the house hold and in the cosmos. Aristotlewrote that initiates went to Eleusis not in order to learn something, as ifmemorizing facts or the words to a song, but to experience something per-sonally (Aristotle fr. 15). His observation suggests that the Mysteries ofDemeter were akin to drama; initiates witnessed the story of the motherDemeter and experienced the suffering of Demeter and Kore within thewalled sanctuary and the Telesterion. And what ever the sequence of thingsthey witnessed, suffered, and experienced, testimony from the ancientworld documents the feeling of joy and happiness of the initiates as theyleft Eleusis. For centuries the Greeks and Romans were forbidden to revealthe actual content of the Mysteries themselves, but they did write aboutthe personal effect that the celebration of the Mysteries had on them. Theyuniformly reported that the Eleusinian Mysteries taught them somethingthat removed their dread of death.The festival of the Mysteries officially ended the day after the revelationin the Telesterion, and the final celebrations returned to the public court-yard outside the gates of the sanctuary. There were civic sacrifices of bulls,as well as general celebratory feasting, drinking, and dancing. Special vesselscalled plemochoai were used to make libations and offerings for the dead.Initiates repeated a ritual formula while spilling the contents of the plemo-choaito the earth, first facing east and then facing west. After these lastcelebrations ended there was no or ga nized pro cession back to Athens; theinitiates simply disbanded their temporary community, and each went heror his own way. The sacred objects remained safe for another year in theAnaktoron, Eleusinian officials remained in Eleusis, and Athenian officialswent back to Athens. The 24th of Boedromion was reserved in Athens foran official report made by a ritual oversight committee which reportedback to the bouleon the conduct of that year’s civic festival of EleusinianDemeter. This final report was issued in accordance with an ancient law ofSolon.demeter in the empire: the first fruits offeringThe myth found in the Homeric Hymn to Demeterand likely celebrated atEleusis was common to all Greeks, but during the late sixth and early fifthdemeter126"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"century Athenians refashioned the tradition about the Eleusinian noble-man Triptolemus to emphasize the cultural importance of Athens andEleusis. The myth about Demeter at Eleusis came to fill significant po liti -cal functions; in the new telling, Demeter not only taught the Eleusiniansher mystery rites but also taught Triptolemus the basics about the cultiva-tion of grain. Triptolemus then set off from Eleusis in a winged carriage tovisit all the cities of Hellas, teaching Demeter’s art of cultivation as hetraveled. In Attic art from the mid- sixth century onward, Triptolemus isoften depicted in this flying carriage. The new Athenian variant of themyth created in Triptolemus humankind’s first cereal farmer; he becameone of the principal heroes of Greek culture, and he was from Eleusis.Since Eleusis by the sixth century been had absorbed into the polisofAthens, Athens could be seen as the seat of all human civilization. It wasan ancestor of the Athenians who had bestowed upon all Greeks this es-sential knowledge. Under the Pisistratid tyrants in the sixth century, theAthenians even built a small temple for Triptolemus in the city Eleusinionon the north slope of the Acropolis.During the period of the Athenian empire in the fifth century, theAthenian demosexploited the details of the refashioned myth, and thenused the myth to shape rituals that suited its ideological position as theleader of a Hellenic empire. A decree passed by the Athenian demosprob-ably in the late 420s (Fornara 140) and preserved in an inscription knownas the First Fruits Decree mandated that all cities subject to the Athenianempire bring annual tribute in honor of Demeter. The tribute of grainwas to be presented at a festival in Eleusis— possibly at the Proerosia, a pre- plowing festival celebrated shortly after the Eleusinian Mysteries.Cities not subject to the empire were likewise strongly urged to bring theirportions in honor of the goddess who provided the gift of grain to hu-mankind. Just as the Athenians annually dedicated to Athena a portion ofthe tribute that their subject- allies had paid them, so too we have evidencethat allies paid an annual tribute to Demeter at Eleusis. The annual taxcame in the form of a tithe of barley and wheat.When the Eleusinian religious officials called spondophoroitraveled aroundGreece to announce the sacred truce, they also asked each city to send adelegation of officials to celebrate Demeter with their own first fruits, oraparchai.Offering the initial portion of an agricultural harvest or animal sacrifice— an aparche— was among the most ancient of ancestral customscommonly observed throughout Greece. With this gift humans honoredthe gods first before they enjoyed the harvest themselves.

But the reality of empirechanged the ritual practice, and what had been proper for demes now be-came required for subject- allies. This same inscription also stipulated theprecise type of animal sacrifice that should accompany the annual firstfruits offerings in Eleusis: after the pelanosoffering (a cake made from thechoicest wheat and barley), the priests of Eleusis were to offer three bullswith gilt horns to the Eleusinian trio of Demeter, Kore, and Triptolemus;Athena too, the patroness of the empire, received a bull. With so many ani-mals sacrificed, those present must have dined on a grand feast.The sum of money that Athens realized from Demeter’s aparchaiatEleusis could not have been trivial. The inscription required the polistoconstruct great storage pits at Eleusis to receive the grain contributions,which, once collected, were sent by Eleusinian priestly officials to Athens,where it was sold. Funds from the sale were stored in Demeter’s trea sury inAthens. It appears that Eleusinian civic officials maintained control overthese funds, and kept trea suries both in Eleusis and in Athens. Related in-scriptions concerning the finances of Eleusis and Athens that are dated tolater in the fifth century show how the polistook out loans from Demeter’strea sury in an effort to finance the Peloponnesian War. These loans drewdirectly from the wealth of the subject- allies. The First Fruits Decree re-veals how Athens justified its hegemony over its allies, and even tried to ex-tend it over other states. While the Athenians claimed that they had self-lessly passed on the gifts of the goddess Demeter to the rest of humankind,the allies knew that it was their tribute that helped fund the war and keptthe Athenian empire strong.demeter’s power in athenian religionThe Eleusinian Mysteries, with their complex history as a local celebrationincorporated into the official poliscalendar of Athens, present illuminat-ing contrasts to the obligatory practices of Athenian civic cult as observedin the Agora and on the Acropolis. Priests and public officials performedcivic sacrificial rites at Eleusis, just as they did at the civic festivals that reg-ularly took place in the urban center in Athens. But contrary to the cus-toms of polisanimal sacrifice, at the Mysteries it was not priests and mag-istrates alone who communicated with the divine at the altar on behalf ofdemeter128"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the group. Animal sacrifices officiated by priests were part of this festivalof Demeter, but apparently played no role in the central ritual in theTelesterion that revealed Demeter’s mysteries. In fact the altars wherepublic sacrifice took place were located in courtyards outside the sacredprecinct at Eleusis. In place of the communal rituals of civic sacrificestood a different experience of the gods inside the Telesterion. Each indi-vidual among the initiates— female and male, foreign and Greek, slaveand free— dedicated piglets to Demeter, watched the sacred drama, andobtained knowledge of the divine directly through the power of his or herown senses. While admission to the Eleusinian Mysteries came at somecost, ancient sources show over and over again that women and slaves reg-ularly attended alongside citizen men. Its breadth of participants makesthe Mysteries the most inclusive and egalitarian of Athenian religious in-stitutions. The Eleusinian Mysteries, a traditional ritual practice existingalongside other polissacrifices and rites, allowed men and women alike toexperience a type of communication between divinity and humanity thatthe traditional civic cult of thysiacould not match.The Eleusinian rites were also unusual in the full system of Athenianpolytheism because their focus remained fixed on the experience of the fe-male, in this case a divine mother and her daughter as the young womancomes of age and marries, maintaining a relationship with her mother allthe while. Unlike the civic festivals of the powerful duo of Zeus andAthena, which ensured social stability and the fixed po liti cal hierarchywithin the polis,the mystery rites of Demeter had the ability to balancetensions in Athenian society that were not easily reconciled. The symbolicpower of Demeter emerged at the intersection of the very categories whosecreation was deemed necessary for the proper functioning of a stable civicsociety: the socially defined norms that separated male from female, citi-zen from noncitizen, and Greek from foreigner. The worship of Demeterlooked beyond the importance of conventional hierarchical po liti cal valuesto celebrate native and foreign elements, free and slave members of soci-ety, male and female experiences. The privileged social status of the adultcitizen male so evident in the Greek rites of thysiamattered little in the an-cestral practices sacred to Demeter and her daughter.In this way the Eleusinian Mysteries resembled the female- only rites ofthe Thesmophoria. Some scholars have suggested that the mystery rites atEleusis started off as a local Thesmophoria ritual. At a time when Eleusiswas still an in de pen dent entity, the men of Eleusis were apparently wel-comed at the rites that their wives celebrated, and they too learned thewomen and the eleusinian mysteries129"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"lesson taught by Demeter and Persephone. Following the synoecism ofAttica the rites of Eleusinian Demeter were made available to all residentsof Attica. With the unification of Athens the festival grew bigger thanever. In the sixth century the Pisistratids enlarged the Eleusinian sanctu-ary and oriented it toward Athens, and in Athens they constructed thefirst temple in the city Eleusinion. The Eleusinion in Athens linked thecity to the border town by requiring priests and rites in both places, andrituals reinforced the connections between the two locales. The construc-tion of a truly monumental building under Pericles opened up the Mys-teries to Greeks from far beyond Athens. At the same time, Athenians re-quired subject- allies in the empire to contribute first fruits to the goddessof Eleusis, and with their contributions acknowledge the self- proclaimedcultural superiority of Athens.Yet while Demeter’s festivals in Attica reflected the po liti cal changes indemocracy and empire in the fifth century, the people who actually wor-shipped Demeter perhaps felt less concern for the polisthan for their ownpersonal well- being. The citizen wives at the Thesmophoria celebrated thefertility of the earth that nurtured everyone, and the people from all walksof life who traveled to Eleusis in the autumn stood side by side to receiveblessings from the goddess who could change their understanding ofdeath. In the fourth century, Plato used Eleusinian language and imageryin some of his dialogues as a meta phor to describe the soul’s experience oftranscendent reality. There was something uniquely powerful about Deme-ter’s secret, nocturnal rites. Although the Mysteries developed alongsidethe civic religion of the polisin the seventh, sixth, and fifth centuries, theyactually survived the decline of the polisin the fourth century. The sanctu-ary at Eleusis remained a center of cult activity for more than 800 years af-ter the fall of Athens in 404. It even endured the rapid growth of Christi-anity in the eastern half of the Roman Empire until its destruction byrampaging Visigoths in 396 ce. The rites themselves remain a mystery, butthe power that Demeter offered her worshippers left many traces in history.In the late fifth century the lure of this power even altered the course of thePeloponnesian War, when politics and the observance of ancestral cultagain captured the attention of the Athenians.demeter130"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"thucydides’ last reported speech ofPericles in book 2 depicts thedynamic Athenian leader encouraging the people of Athens to be patientand maintain their naval empire.

The large islandof Lesbos off the coast of Ionia contained several poleisthat had long de-sired to combine forces and free themselves from the Athenian arche.Mytilene, the main city of Lesbos and leader of the uprising, was negoti-ating for aid from Sparta and Boeotia. The revolt that unfolded shows justhow relentless the Athenians’ response could be, and it anticipated some ofthe uglier chapters of the war soon to come.Thucydides’ narrative of the Mytilene episode reveals how poleisotherthan Athens also worked within civic calendars of religious festivals to sup-port residents and plan for a city’s defense. The Athenians realized thatMytilene was determined to revolt, and so they sent forty ships. When thecitizens of Mytilene realized that they were not fully prepared for a revoltthey canceled their annual festival to Apollo in the Apple Country (ApolloMalea) so that they could complete repairs to the city’s fortifications(Thucydides 3.3). Soon afterward the Mytileneans were invited to send am-bassadors along with athletes to the Olympic games in the Peloponnese. Therenowned panhellenic festival that celebrated the physical strength and skillof young athletes also set aside time for the leaders of Hellenic poleisto con-sider po liti cal affairs. During this festival of Zeus in 428, Sparta and its alliesheard the Mytileneans’ case for war— ironically, while they met together un-der a truce. The negotiations between Lesbos and Sparta at the festival ofZeus were initially successful: the Spartans agreed to gather their allies andinvade Attica directly by land and sea. This action would force the Atheni-ans to fight major campaigns on two fronts: both at home in Attica and onLesbos.As hard- pressed as the Athenians were after the plague, they still put to-gether a firm response to the Spartan plans and manned 100 additional shipsby calling on available citizens and metics. These ships and men sailedsouth to the Peloponnese and plundered the countryside near Sparta whilethe navy handled the situation on Lesbos as it did most revolts: it laid siegeto Mytilene. This unexpected show of Athenian strength surprised theSpartans, who then abandoned their campaign in Attica to defend thePeloponnese. They did send a few token ships to Lesbos in belated supportof the uprising. Meanwhile the heavy expenditures of the war’s first yearsand the cost of besieging Mytilene forced Athens to levy a stiff new prop-erty tax on its own citizens. It was the first time the previously tribute- richAthenians had been compelled to take such mea sures.With Mytilene blockaded and with the promised Spartan aid arriving toolate, the revolt on Lesbos soon faltered. Now the demosback in Athens dis-alcibiades132"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"cussed how best to respond to the revolt. Many Athenians grew alarmed tosee once- trusted allies turning to Sparta for aid, and their thoughts turned topunishment. Though the course of the war had pushed Greeks to treat eachother inhumanely and even brutally, harsh treatment was usually reservedfor opponents on the battlefield. But now in lengthy and impassioned meet-ings of the Assembly the demosdid something it had never done before: itvoted to punish its rebellious allies in Mytilene by putting to death all thecitizens and enslaving all the women and children. A trireme was dispatchedto Lesbos with the grim news.The very next morning the Athenian demoshad second thoughts, andpublic debate was resumed. It was the rising politician Cleon who continuedto support the harsh mea sures, arguing that a uniformly severe punishmentwould deter other subject- allies from revolting and leaving the empire. In aclose vote it was decided that the sweeping destruction of an entire city wastoo cruel: the demosvoted to rescind the initial order. A second trireme car-ry ing the new decree was sent off a full day and a half after the first, and therowers were offered rich rewards if they arrived in time. Thucydides reportsthat the men ate while rowing and took turns sleeping; they managed toreach Mytilene just as the fatal decree was being read— but before it hadbeen enacted. In this way the people of Lesbos were spared such a harshfate, although 1,000 men said to be responsible for the revolt were executed.Thereafter the autonomy of Mytilene was severely limited: the Athenianstore down the city’s walls, disbanded its navy, and redistributed the land onLesbos. Ten percent of the land was set aside for the gods, and the remain-der allotted to Athenian citizens who served as landlords charged with leas-ing the land back to the natives. In the future, other allies who revolted fromthe Athenian archewould not be so fortunate.Beyond the crisis with Mytilene and Sparta, the devastation of the plaguehad another immediate effect on the fortunes of the Athenians. The unex-pected death of Pericles, the main architect of the war’s strategy, leftAthens without its accustomed general and trusted counselor. The leader-ship vacuum in Athens produced no immediate heir to Pericles, and dur-ing the next eight years the demosfollowed several men. Among these werethe impulsive Cleon— the speaker who had advocated the harshest penaltyfor the Mytileneans— and an older and more cautious aristocrat by thename of Nicias.No two Athenian politicians could have been more dissimilar: Cleonwas a rash and energetic man whose family had apparently achieved newwealth in the boom years of manufacturing in Athens and Piraeus.

Hewas among the first of a new generation of leaders sometimes called dem-agogues, literally “leaders of the demos.” His unwavering support for theempire led to increases in tribute paid by the allies, while his domestic ini-tiatives appealed to many in the demos,especially after he successfully ad-vocated for an increase in the daily pay for jury ser vice. Nicias, on theother hand, had less interest in expanding the empire than in reaching fa-vorable terms for a viable peace between Athens and Sparta. His militaryexperience and cautious competence on the battlefield resulted in numer-ous elections to the office of strategos.An extremely wealthy and moderatearistocrat, Nicias was widely respected for living by the highest standardsof public ser vice and old- fashioned arete(virtue), and for his observanceof traditional ritual practices. But Nicias shared with Cimon one impor-tant trait: both used their considerable wealth to sponsor civic feasts, dra-matic and athletic festivals, and other forms of public ser vice for the Athe-nian demos.Nicias’s leadership following the crisis with Mytilene and Sparta high-lights the place that observing traditional cult practices played in his pub-lic career. The winter of 427/6 saw a second resurgence of the plague,when rampant death and illness again tore through Athens. Perhaps takinga cue from the opening of Homer’s Iliad(where Greek military leaders ap-peased Apollo after he let loose a plague to punish them for insulting oneof his priests), or perhaps following the advice of an oracle, the Atheniansdetermined that they had inadvertently offended Apollo at his sanctuaryon the island of Delos, the original seat of their naval alliance. If the godwas angered, there was only one remedy: purification of the sanctuary(Thucydides 3.104). Athens had a history of involvement at the sanctuaryof Delos in de pen dent of the Delian League. During a period of buildingand development at the Ionian festival spot in the sixth century, Pisistratushad purified the sanctuary by moving any graves that were within sight ofApollo’s temple on Delos. Now the Athenians purified the island again,this time by transferring all the graves they could find on Delos to theneighboring island of Rheneia. They then decreed that no one might pol-lute the island sacred to the god of prophecy by either dying or givingbirth there. Our sources do not indicate precisely who it was who oversawand administered the repurification of Delos, but certainly Nicias repre-sented the kind of pious citizen leader who would have supported a policylike this.alcibiades134"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"What lay behind this plan to repurify Delos is less a theology of beliefgrounded in empty superstition than a common commitment to maintain-ing the powerful separateness of certain places. Sites historically fre-quented by Greeks from different poleishad deep connections to a sharedpast and shared patrioi nomoi.By sacrificing and celebrating in these jointsanctuaries, Greeks maintained that connection to the past. Piety andproper worship of the gods required collaboration and communicationamong human communities in the present; maintaining these patterns ofcooperation that culminated in a shared feast afterward ensured the com-mon good for the future.One ancient idea shared by all Greeks was the notion of miasma,or rit-ual pollution. The repurification of Delos illustrates the workings of mi-asmain two separate but related areas. First, traditional rites of thysiain-cluded commonly observed rituals aimed at containing the blood spilledin animal sacrifice: blood properly handled by priests according to ances-tral custom facilitated worship and communication between human andthe divine, but improperly handled blood became polluted— a source ofmiasmaand contagion for all who came in contact with it.But there were additional sources of miasmabeyond the blood of sacri-fice, and these included the natural and very human phenomena of birthand death. These essential life- cycle events changed and indeed definedhuman society in powerful and fundamental ways. Death especially, theloss that immortal gods by definition could not experience, created disrup-tion and temporary disorder in society. Sexual activity did so too, thoughto a lesser extent, and therefore the customary precautions against miasmacreated by sexual activity were not as strict. The psychological anxiety thatarose in critical moments of birth and death were translated into action,namely the rituals surrounding miasmathat required humans to controlblood, the stuff of life. Since the gods represented order in the cosmos,human society had the responsibility to contain what ever might poten-tially disturb that order; from this emerged rituals of avoiding pollution,clearly illustrated by birth and death rituals, as well as by rituals of thysia.At the shared sanctuary on Delos, Ionians worshipped the immortal godApollo by performing rites of thysiaand celebrating feasts afterward. TheIonians’ tradition of worshipping Apollo at the common festival site artic-ulated the group’s commitment to respect each other and their commonpast; repurifying the island of Delos and the sanctuary of Apollo consti-tuted an action that again demonstrated the Delian League’s respect forthe pan- Ionian deity Apollo, and by extension for shared ancestral nomoi.politics, religion, and personality cult135"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Although we don’t know the exact role Nicias played in the repurificationof Delos in 426, one source does describe him leading a grand sacrificialpro cession to Apollo’s shrine there at the dedication of a new temple a fewyears later in 417. This traditional— and perhaps even unspoken— notionthat a polisand its leaders were responsible for maintaining the properalignment of divine and human was the sort of thing that many Atheni-ans probably respected in Nicias.Nicias’s respect for the nomoiand the Athenians’ decision to purify Delosrepresent one response of the Athenians to the stress and devastation ofplague. The leadership of Cleon during the debate over Mytilene showsanother, very different reaction. While the actions of Nicias confirmedcommon Ionian worship and the foundational traditions of the polis,bothof which channeled anxiety through civic rituals that controlled miasma,Cleon’s rhetoric of empire and superiority pushed for the harsh treatmentof subject- allies. This extreme stance had some historical pre ce dent withinthe Delian League, and, as Thucydides tells us, both Spartans and Atheni-ans would regularly continue to abuse their enemies during war time.Thucydides’ account of the war and the compelling personalities behindit is famous for its subtle understanding of human motives and psychol-ogy. In extreme circumstances men can make horrific decisions: tortureof prisoners, wholesale extermination of entire communities, and evencannibalism all make their appearance in Thucydides’ account of theconflict between Athens and Sparta. For him human nature was constantand predictable: when circumstances allow for it, mortal men will try toexercise power over others, and then increase this power when they can.At the same time the pursuit of power can become oppressive, and whenthis happens the driving need to maintain power leads to collapse.

Another example of the grad-ual departure from traditional nomoiof conventional warfare became evidentin 424 with the Athenian invasion of Boeotia, immediately to the north ofAttica and now an important Spartan ally. There was factional strife withinBoeotia itself— some citizens supported Athens and others Sparta— andAthens formed a complex plan that took advantage of the Boeotian civil con-flict. As part of the strategy to compel Boeotian cities to adopt Athenian- styledemocracies and join the Delian League, a significant contingent of Athenianhoplites and metics occupied and fortified a Boeotian temple of Apollo lo-cated at Delion. The Athenians adopted this strategy even though forciblytaking possession of a god’s sanctuary and transforming it into a military fortviolated shared Greek nomoiabout activities appropriate on sacred groundwithin any polis(Thucydides 4.92). In the end the Athenians botched the co-ordinated timing of the offensive. Boeotian and Theban forces allied withSparta dealt the Athenian hoplites a crushing blow at Delion, and this battlelived on vividly in Greek historical consciousness— not least of all becauseSocrates fought there and would later speak of the desperate struggle thatalmost cost him his life as he fled Apollo’s sanctuary (Thucydides 4.76–77, 89–101; Plato Symposium220b, Apology28e, Laches181b).At the same time that the Athenians were struggling at Delion, they were also fighting important battles further to the north in coastal Mace-donia and Thrace. The Spartan army under the commander Brasidasadopted a policy of supporting cities in that region that wished to revoltfrom the Athenian arche.In 424 Brasidas took control of Amphipolis, animportant city in the Delian League that commanded access to trade, tim-ber, and mines (Thucydides 4.102–7). Over the next few years the Atheni-ans fought hard to regain the strategic city. While they never succeeded,the extended campaign on the northern edges of the Athenian empire didsee a good deal of dramatic action. For failing to save the city when Brasi-das and the Spartans attacked it, one respected Athenian naval generalwho served at Amphipolis was sentenced to twenty years of exile— namely,Thucydides the historian (Thucydides 4.104, 5.26).

The Athenian demos,urged on by Cleon, voted torecapture the city— and kill all the adult male citizens and enslave thewomen and children. It took more than a year for a naval blockade to fullyreduce Scione, but this time the Athenians had no second thoughts. They were successful. The men were killed, and the women and children enslaved.The land was turned over to settlers from Plataea (Thucydides 4.121–12,5.32). At the same time a second protracted and bloody conflict was takingplace near Amphipolis, as the Athenian navy attempted to win back thestrategic port. The final battle at Amphipolis in 422 brought the deaths ofBrasidas and Cleon, the principal generals leading the Spartan and Athenianforces (Thucydides 5.8–10). Chance accomplished what generals and strate-gies could not: with Cleon dead, Nicias and the Athenians eager for peacewith Sparta could pursue policies aimed at bringing the conflict to a close.Meanwhile the residents of Amphipolis buried Brasidas with everyhonor in their city’s Agora (Thucydides 5.10). In time they came to viewhim not only as their liberator but even as their found er. Although Atheni-ans had colonized the city just a few de cades earlier, the citizens of Am-phipolis transferred their allegiance from Athens to Sparta with the deathof Brasidas. In death Brasidas became a hero whose accomplishments werememorialized with annual athletic competitions. Citizens worshipped himat public feasts with animal sacrifices performed at an altar by his grave.

Without a clear winner in a struggle thatnow engulfed much of Hellas, the Athenians and the Spartans seized themoment and negotiated a fifty- year truce, sometimes called the Peace ofNicias, in 421.Under Nicias’s leadership, during the next year Athens and Sparta ac-tually struck two separate agreements: the peace treaty in 421, and a mu-tual defense pact a little later (Thucydides 5.18, 23). Nicias believed thata negotiated truce offered the best course for the future of the Athenianempire. Like all peace treaties in ancient Greece, this agreement calledupon the gods.

Athenian and Spartan leaders agreedto the terms and swore vows to each other while pouring libations, spondai,of wine onto the ground.

Above all, the treaty of 421 explicitly allowedthe Greeks to continue making pilgrimages to shrines commonly recog-nized by all Hellenes (e.g., Delphi, Eleusis, Olympia), where they couldall worship the gods and offer sacrifices without fear of harm. The mu-tual importance of these panhellenic shrines was underscored by a clausestipulating that the Athenians and Spartans both set up public inscrip-tions that recorded the oaths at Delphi and Olympia, as well as in Athens(presumably in the temple of Athena) and in a temple of Apollo in Sparta.For the later alliance the gods themselves, in addition to the citizens ofAthens and Sparta, would bear witness to the promises each side madewhen the agreements were annually renewed at civic festivals in Athensand Sparta.politics, religion, and personality cult139"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"As well- intentioned as the treaties may have been on both sides, they didnot last.

TheElians forbade the Spartans from entering the temple and sacrificing toZeus; their actions effectively blocked the Spartans from competing in theathletic games and attending any scheduled negotiations. One Spartancompetitor who entered his chariot team under the Boeotian flag waswhipped by Olympian officials when he tried to claim his prize.

Nicias proved to be ineffectual when another man arose whoplaced power before peace. A remarkable Athenian aristocrat emerged tofill the gap created by the deaths of Pericles and Cleon; he led the Atheni-ans back to war, and persuaded them to further develop their naval arche.The name of this aristocrat was Alcibiades.Alcibiades was the product of two well- connected and aristocratic Athe-nian families. He was also Pericles’ relative and legal ward. Alcibiades’ fa-ther Cleinias was born into the noble clan of the Salaminioi, while hismother Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles and first cousin of Pericles,was born into the Alcmaeonid line. Cleinias, a longtime personal friend ofPericles and a supporter of the Athenian empire, may have fought on aship that he personally funded as a liturgy during the Persian Wars. Cleiniasshowed his loyalty to the Athenian empire under Pericles when Athenscame into conflict with neighboring states in the First Peloponnesian Warof the 440s. When tense hostilities led to outright battles in 447, Cleiniaswas killed in combat at the battle of Coronea.Alcibiades was then a small child and Pericles became the legal guardianfor him and his brother, also named Cleinias. According to tradition Alcib-iades was actually raised in Pericles’ house hold and was a favorite of theAthenian leader. He received the best education, was a fine athlete, and be-came a gifted speaker. Alcibiades was reported to be unusually good- looking,and though he spoke with a noticeable lisp he managed to find a way tomake that lisp a charming and persuasive asset.

Taking advantage of his high socialstanding and some old family ties to Sparta, he secretly met with two sep-arate groups of foreign envoys: the Spartans and a co ali tion of Sparta’sneighbors from the Peloponnese, among them Argos (Thucydides 5.43).Athens had great interest in both groups, and Nicias was committed tomaintaining good diplomatic relations in an effort to reinforce the peaceof 421. But the young Alcibiades proved to be a daring opportunist whoworked the diplomatic situation to his advantage. In a meeting of theAthenian Assembly he tricked the Spartan ambassadors into publicly mis-representing their position, thereby betraying the Spartans and Nicias atthe same time. Alcibiades spoke so convincingly that the demosagreed toform a new co ali tion with other Peloponnesian poleis;Argos welcomed thismove, as its strong demo cratic faction was not eager to renew an old al-liance with Sparta. Alcibiades argued that since this handful of Sparta’simmediate neighbors (Mantinea, Elis, and Argos) no longer had confidencein Spartan leadership, it was the right moment for Athens to propose thatthey all band together and create a new partnership that excluded Sparta(Thucydides 5.47).Even in this, Alcibiades’ first entrance into Athenian public life, we cansee a strong rivalry developing between Alcibiades and Nicias. Althoughhis diplomatic strategy of rebuffing Sparta clearly violated the spirit if notthe terms of the Peace of Nicias, and although Nicias opposed the pro-posed co ali tion, Alcibiades’ eloquence and powers of persuasion swayedthe Athenian demos.The Athenians made new allies— not subject- allies likethose in the arche,but allies in the Peloponnese who, Alcibiades claimed,could help keep Spartan ambition in check. Alcibiades was then electedgeneral and given command over a small expedition into the Peloponnese.But while he had the charisma to connect with the demosin the Assemblyat home, his per for mance as a military leader in the field was poor. Some-times he led his men to victory, but more often he arrived too late to help.His plans to help fortify cities in the new alliance were shrewd— but theprojects were not always completed.

Nicias undertook a civic liturgy at his own ex-pense, and in a remarkably grand style he built a temporary floating bridgebetween Delos and the neighboring island of Rheneia; he then led a mag-nificent sacrificial pro cession across the bridge and to the altar in theApollo sanctuary (Plutarch Nicias3). Not to be outdone, Alcibiades coun-tered by undertaking at great private expense a public project of his ownby sponsoring not one but seven Athenian chariot teams at the Olympicfestival of 416 (Plutarch Alcibiades11; cf. Thucydides 6.16). No private in-dividual had ever before attempted such a thing. Of these seven teams,three placed in the top five, and in the sanctuary of Zeus Alcibiades wasable to suggest to the Hellenic world that the Athenians were mightier thanever.Even in the rites performed for these festivals the Athenians could ap-preciate the different temperaments of the two men. Both the athletic fes-tival at Olympia and the dedication of the temple on Delos showcased theAthenians’ wealth and power, but to different audiences and throughdifferent means. While Nicias’s display highlighted the public piety of theAthenian people and their renewed commitment to Apollo and the leagueof Ionian cities, Alcibiades intuited that not just the Ionians but all theGreeks would feel renewed respect for Athenian greatness when they wit-nessed the per for mance of his chariot teams. The grace and power of seventhundering four- horse chariots at a panhellenic festival brought unpre ce -dented Olympic glory to Athens.At the same time that Nicias and Alcibiades were at religious festivalsvying for the love and support of the demos,the demosbrazenly pursuedthe harshest of its imperial policies. With a series of decisions reminiscentof those involving Mytilene in 428 and Scione in 423, in 416 the Atheniansmoved against Melos, an island settled by Spartan colonists and one of theonly islands in the Cyclades that remained neutral and outside the Athenianarche.The citizens of this polisin the southern Aegean had long resistedjoining the Delian League, insisting on their autonomy when Athens hadearlier tried to force them to join the alliance in 426/5.

Given what had al-most happened at Mytilene, and what had actually happened at Scione,the Melians must have been aware of what the Athenians were capable of.Yet the Melian leaders refused all offers, and their city was besieged. At theend of the siege the surviving men of Melos were killed, and the womenand children sold into slavery.Thucydides rec ords the events on Melos at the end of book 5 of his his-tory, and his detailed account of a private dialogue between Melian lead-ers and Athenian ambassadors has become famous for its clear articulationof a specific view of power: those who have power use it, while the weakare compelled to make compromises (Thucydides 5.84–116). Both sides in-voked the gods in their arguments. When the Melians claimed they wouldnot be defeated by the unjust Athenians because they were protected bythe gods, the Athenians turned right around and claimed that their actions were in line with both human nature and the affairs of the gods. Whenlooked at from the point of view of traditional Greek religious practice,both claims are accurate. The Melian position relied on a view of Zeus asthe god who metes out justice among gods and men and who punishesthose who transgress the laws of xenia;the Athenian position assumes thatmortals worship this king of the gods who came to power by defeating thosewho were weaker and older (Cronus and the former generation of Titansfrom the Succession Myth), and then dominating the other Olympiangods in his own generation. Athenian insistence on the overwhelmingcompulsion of power was grounded in their par tic u lar understanding ofrelationships among the Olympian gods; the Melian commitment to ob-serving traditional nomoigave them confidence that the justice of Zeuswould prevail in the end. Ritual practices of the Greek polisand ancestraltraditions surrounding the gods helped fuel the drama of this episode onMelos.The harsh imperial diplomacy of Cleon and his followers evident in theaffairs at Mytilene and Scione was again realized at Melos, and Thucydidesreports no hesitation on the part of the Athenian ambassadors and gener-als to exercise overpowering and brutal force against the Melians whomthe Athenians had hoped to force into their alliance. After killing or en-slaving any Melians who resisted, Athens repopulated the island by estab-lishing a colony of Athenian citizens.

The election of the two men,one older and cautious and the other younger and ambitious, reflected theincreasingly polarized divisions within the citizen body itself as Athenianscontemplated how best to manage their empire while maintaining the trucewith Sparta. Nicias urged the Athenians to keep the peace and strengthenthe existing empire by turning their attention north again, where alliedcities continued to threaten rebellion from the arche.This region was sig-nificant for the security of Athens since the poleisthere supplied tribute toAthena and timber for ships in the empire’s navy. In addition, the Athe-nians considered it essential to control these cities because they lay alongthe route to the Hellespont, the main shipping channel for much- neededsupplies of grain.But Alcibiades undercut Nicias’s advice with his own idea. Alcibiades’real desire was to increase the reach of the Athenian arche,and he cast hisgaze further west toward Sicily. The coasts of Sicily and southern Italy hadlong been home to Greek colonies. The fertile countryside of Sicily pro-duced a good deal of grain; if it could offer an additional source of foodfor Athens then perhaps control of the northern Aegean and Hellespontwould not be so crucial after all. In 416 ambassadors from the city ofSegesta visited Athens and reported on a troubling situation in Sicily: Syra-cuse, a Dorian city with strong connections to Corinth and Sparta, wasgrowing stronger and would soon control the entire island unless someoneintervened. Already the Syracusans were aiding the city of Selinus in aborder dispute with Segesta. The Segestans’ dire predictions of the risingpower of Syracuse raised the anxiety of the Athenians, who feared that theDorian city of Syracuse could come to the aid of the Dorian Spartans andjoin in dismantling Athenian authority. As a first step, the Athenians senta delegation to Sicily. Envoys returned to Athens with favorable reportsabout resources for war available from public temple funds and privatesources in Sicily. This information encouraged the Assembly to do some-thing that Pericles had cautioned the Athenians against at the start of thewar with Sparta in 431: the demosvoted to expand the conflict beyond thescope of the existing empire.

The youthful and handsome Alcibiades, now about 35 years old,embodied Athenian feelings of confidence, and he projected a kind ofdynamic strength that the older and pious Nicias lacked (Thucydides 6.15–18). While some Athenians did express confidence in Alcibiades’plans, others expressed reservations about an ambitious, expensive expe-dition to Sicily. In the Assembly Nicias articulated the position of themission’s opponents. He simply felt the Athenians were not thinkingstraight. He pointed out that it would be foolish to attack and subdue apeople who would be hard to control once conquered; the resourcesneeded for such a foreign campaign would be much better spent at homeon the Athenians, who were still recovering from the plague and enjoy-ing a respite from the war with Sparta (Thucydides 6.9–14, 20–23). Butthe demoswas too much under the spell of the charming Alcibiades andhis dreams for their empire, and the Athenians voted to prepare an expe-ditionary force with Alcibiades and Nicias serving as generals, along witha third man named Lamachus. Nicias was appointed against his will andagainst his better judgment (Thucydides 6.25–26).The preparations for the expedition were fraught and complicated, andanother public debate that soon followed only made matters more com-plex. Thucydides reports the speeches of Nicias and Alcibiades, detailingdisagreements over how many ships would be needed, and how manyheavily armed hoplites and lighter armed soldiers should be marshaled. Al-cibiades anticipated a quick and easy victory in Sicily that would require amodest expenditure of resources. In his view conquering Sicily would nat-urally propel the Athenians even further into the central Mediterraneanand lead them to make new alliances— for example, with the Phoeniciancity of Carthage, an important trading center in North Africa.

He argued that vic-tory in Sicily could be achieved only with great effort and careful plan-ning. Nicias cautioned that the expeditionary force would require far moremen, more ships, more resources, and much more luck than Alcibiadeswas making allowances for.

Andthey remained steadfast in their decision to give command jointly to twomen of such opposite bent, relying on Lamachus to temper the two conflict-ing personalities. The decision to invade Sicily on such a grand scale marks amajor shift in Athenian strategy, and its significance cannot be overstated.Thucydides asserts that the Athenian- led armada bound for Sicily was themost magnificent— and most expensive— ever launched by a single Greekcity (Thucydides 6.31). But it was also to have one of the most miserableendings of the war: in a matter of a few years the entire fleet and nearly allthe men would be lost— killed or sold into slavery.

One morning early in the summer of 415, in thevery last days before the armada’s spectacular departure to Sicily, the res-idents of Athens awoke to discover that in the night religious images andstatues in the city had been knocked about (Thucydides 6.27). It hadlong been customary throughout Athens to set up statues called herms.These pillarlike images were considered sacred to the god Hermes, a de-ity whose authority extended over merchants and commerce and ensuredthe safety of all travelers. The squared- off pillars typically stood some 5feet high, and they featured a sculpted bust of the bearded god Hermesat the top, knobs or handles on the side, and a large, erect phallus abouthalfway down. There were no other recognizable human or divine fea-tures. In figure 10 an Athenian workman places a herm in front of an altar.Herms were understood to protect the city; they stood at the frontier ofthe polis,alongside public highways, and at the crossroads of city streets;they were visible on the Acropolis, in the agora, and at the entrance to anysanctuary; they marked public boundaries and were set up outside ofprivate homes.

By the mid- fifth century, herms were a stan-dard feature in the Athenian cityscape. They were sometimes objects ofworship, and they also performed an important apotropaic function in thecity as they aggressively warned travelers and foreigners that the Athenianshad power and were willing to exercise it.When the Athenians woke up that morning they discovered that the facesof virtually every herm had been damaged and the phalluses knocked off.Striking these images of Hermes was an act of impiety, asebeia,that consti-tuted civic sacrilege. Given that Hermes was the god of travelers, and thatthe Athenian navy was about to embark on a major expedition across thesea, some interpreted the mutilation of the herms as a dark and ominousmessage. Even more shocking was the extent of the damage. It was not lim-ited to just a few herms in one quarter of the city— hundreds of pillarsthroughout the urban center of Athens were destroyed.These acts of public impiety at such a critical moment unnerved theAthenian demos.While some dismissed the vandalism as a youthful prankcarried out by drunken youths, others feared that the destruction of theherms carried a message for the polis.The more pious understood the sacri-lege against the images of Hermes to be an ill omen for the Athenian fleetas it set out on a major offensive carry ing men to faraway Sicily. Some ofthe more po liti cally minded in Athens felt a different anxiety, though. Theybelieved that such wanton destruction was not the random work of a fewdrunken young men but an or ga nized effort that foreboded revolution:they feared that the sacrilege had been committed by aristocrats who werethreatening to overthrow the government and replace it with an oligarchy.The fears of an aristocratic conspiracy were not entirely unfounded. Ithad long been an Athenian custom for groups of aristocratic citizens tomeet in social groups called hetaireiai— voluntary private associations ofcomrades, hetairoi.Members in these clubs sacrificed and dined together,and perhaps also worshipped new gods or heroes not yet incorporated intothe official state calendar of civic rites. Often hetaireiaiincluded informalpo liti cal activities that backed the civic ambitions of group members andoffered assistance and support for members in the Athenian Assembly andlaw courts. The sacrilege against the herms on this night in June 415 sug-gested to some among the demosthat aristocrats were conspiring in theirclubs and sending a message to the Athenian people that the polisand itsdemocracy were no longer safe.

Athenian customs so thoroughly infused religious activityinto the arena of politics that an affront to the ancestral gods implied anaffront to the polisitself.Although no one came forward initially with information about the mu-tilation of the herms, allegations about other recent acts of asebeiadid soonsurface (Thucydides 6.28). In a last- minute meeting of the Assembly andnaval commanders to discuss the Sicilian expedition, a citizen namedPythonicus rose up to denounce one of the three generals: Alcibiades.Pythonicus said he could produce a witness who would attest to serious actsof impiety involving Alcibiades and the Mysteries of Demeter. The witnesswho was brought forward, a slave named Andromachus, was given leave toaddress the Assembly— normally slaves gave testimony in Athenian courtsonly under torture, but in this case the Assembly bent the rules. The infor-mation that Andromachus had concerning the secret meetings was so sensi-tive that the demoswas forced to reconvene after dismissing all those presentwho had not yet been initiated at Eleusis. Only citizens who had experi-enced the Eleusinian Mysteries were allowed to attend the meeting. Andro-machus reported that he had attended his master at a gathering in a privatehome, and although he was not personally an Eleusinian initiate he was ableto disclose the content of the Mysteries. He identified three citizens he hadseen performing the sacred rites of Demeter at the home of Poulytion whileothers watched. Seven other citizens were present that night, plus four slaves.The three men Andromachus named as the leaders were Niciades, Meletus,and Alcibiades (Andocides On the Mysteries 11–14).Alcibiades found himself cornered: he was directly implicated in onecharge of impiety, and his po liti cal rivals took this new charge about theprofanation of the Mysteries and linked it to the mutilation of the hermsand the threat of an oligarchic revolution.

Any public act of civicimpiety was a punishable offense with serious consequences for the perpe-trator. Psychologically, these charges about the destruction of the hermsand the desecration of the Mysteries took a great toll on the Athenians,who now were faced with two impious acts that they interpreted as badomens for the imminent expedition to Sicily. The gods would punish thepolisand its citizens if they did not bring to justice those responsible.Before Alcibiades departed for Sicily he spoke before the Assembly anddenied all the charges. He offered to stand trial immediately. He pointed outthat it was in the interest of the Athenians to try him before the expeditiondeparted: leaving the whole question of his alleged impiety unresolvedmight compromise the success of the mission. He even encouraged thepeople to kill him at once if they found him guilty of any wrong. However,Alcibiades’ enemies wished to delay the trial. They knew that he would callupon his friends to give testimony on his behalf, and they feared that thearmy and the people would be moved to support him rather than to criticizehis behavior. Alcibiades’ detractors wanted time to conduct a thorough in-vestigation, and they would do anything possible— even fabricate charges— to strengthen their case. The Assembly voted that the expedition headed byAlcibiades and Nicias should set sail immediately (Thucydides 6.28–30).In midsummer the expedition was finally ready. The entire population ofthe city, citizens and foreigners alike, went down to see the launching andthe ceremonies before the magnificent armada set sail. A flourish of trum-pets quieted the crowds, and civic officials made the customary prayers. Inevery ship officers mixed wine and water and poured libations from cupsmade of gold and silver. All the ancestral civic rites were scrupulously ob-served for the departure of the fleet to Sicily (Thucydides 6.30–32).Once Nicias, Alcibiades, and the armada had set sail the Athenians con-tinued their investigations. Three in for mants came forward in rapid suc-cession. First a metic named Teukros was given leave to speak in the As-sembly and granted immunity from subsequent prosecution. In hisdamning testimony he admitted that he had himself celebrated the Mys-teries in private homes alongside Athenian citizens. He denounced twelvealcibiades150"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"by name, including a brother of Nicias. Teukros the metic was evidentlyso well- placed in Athenian society that he knew of other acts of asebeia:not only did his testimony denounce men who profaned the Mysteries, buthe could also name eigh teen citizens involved in the mutilation of the herms(Andocides On the Mysteries15, 34–35).Next a citizen wife named Agariste supplied information about anotherinstance of citizens celebrating the sacred rites of Demeter in a privatehome, this time the home of Charmides. Although a woman could notgive sworn testimony in the Athenian Assembly or courts, her citizen hus-band could speak for her. Agariste again named three who officiated inthese rites, and again one of those named was Alcibiades (Andocides Onthe Mysteries16). Then another slave named Lydus identified even morecitizens who had been present at his master’s (Pherekles’) house on an oc-casion when the Mysteries were celebrated (Andocides On the Mysteries 17–18).Finally an Athenian citizen spoke out. Diocleides reported that he hadaccidentally stumbled across the men who mutilated the herms (Ando-cides On the Mysteries 37–42). Diocleides described how he had set out ona journey one night to take care of some morning business 20 miles away.Walking by the light the full moon he passed the theater of Dionysus,where he said he saw more than 300 men gathering down in the orchestra.Of these 300 men he recognized many and was able to positively identify42, and he denounced these men before the boule.Some of the men Dio-cleides identified were themselves members of the Council, and others were aristocrats well known in public life, including another of the broth-ers of the general Nicias. Alcibiades was not named. But even this numberwas only a fraction of the 300 men Diocleides testified he had seen in themoonlight that night.With the report of Diocleides the fears of the Athenians were magnifiedagain, and they voted to suspend a previously existing law that forbade thetorture of citizens (Andocides On the Mysteries 43–44). They were so afraidof revolution and tyranny that they would go to any lengths to obtain testi-mony that could resolve the issue, even if that testimony was clearly co-erced and possibly falsified. In the meantime distinguished citizenscharged with impiety by Diocleides were imprisoned. The level of fear inthe city at this time was so high that innocent citizens fled the Agora interror whenever the signal was given that announced the convening of theboule(Andocides On the Mysteries36). Many simply went into exile to avoidtrial.politics, religion, and personality cult151"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"One prominent aristocrat named Andocides, identified by Diocleides andimplicated in the herms affair, was taken from prison and granted immunityin exchange for his testimony. While carefully pointing out that a collarboneinjury had kept him at home on the precise night in question, Andocides didtestify that it was his own hetaireiaof young noblemen that had plannedand implemented the mutilation of the herms. Because the account of An-docides did not fully agree with Diocleides’ first account, Diocleides wasbrought in again for further questioning. When faced with torture Dioclei-des now admitted that his earlier testimony had been entirely false, and thatit was Alcibiades’ cousin who had instructed him to give an unfaithful ac-count. Diocleides was summarily executed, but only after the men he had slandered— including Andocides and his family members— were cleared ofall charges (Andocides On the Mysteries 60–67).Andocides’ account confirmed the Athenians’ fears of an oligarchic plot,and Diocleides’ social connections to the aristocratic family of Alcibiadesraised the anxiety of the Athenians even further. They recalled Alcibiadesto Athens to stand trial and face the inquiries of the people. A fast shipwas dispatched to fetch Alcibiades and other soldiers who were chargedwith mutilating the herms or profaning the Mysteries (Thucydides 6.53).The Athenians now felt confident that religious crises were jeopardiz-ing the expedition to Sicily, and one of the principal leaders of the navalforces was responsible for creating the danger. While Nicias remainedwidely respected for his public expressions of piety and his conservativereligious stance, Alcibiades attracted even more attention for his outra-geous, impious behavior. The most passionate reservations about the Si-cilian expedition were now expressed in the demos’s official and unofficialresponses to the unusual flouting of religious norms. In the witch hunt ofthe summer of 415, scores of Athenian citizens were denounced, impris-oned, tortured, and executed; friends and family members betrayed oneanother. The city was filled with suspicion, and citizens dreaded having tostand trial, especially since trials were not always conducted with com-plete fairness and citizens took to perjuring themselves to avoid beingnamed by others. Those who were named in the affairs of the Mysteriesand herms that summer either fled the city before they could be tried or were executed after standing trial and being found guilty. Those who were not present at their trials were tried in absentia; when found guiltythey were condemned to death and their estates confiscated by the state.And at the center of the greatest civic and religious crisis perhaps ever inthe history of Athens stood Alcibiades.alcibiades152"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Today most scholars conclude that Alcibiades was probably guilty ofprofaning the Mysteries, but not necessarily involved in mutilating theherms. While none of the remaining historical accounts can clarify whathappened when Alcibiades and his friends celebrated the rites of Demeterin the homes of Poulytion, Charmides, and Pherekles, there are some in-teresting similarities in the reports. The unlawful rites took place in pri-vate homes and among relatively small groups of friends— never more thana dozen were named. Two of the accounts specifically name three individ-uals (citizen men) who “did” the Mysteries while the others looked on.Two accounts note that slaves were present, and at least two identify met-ics. All these details square with what we know about the official Mysteriesas celebrated annually in Eleusis. In the official civic rites inside the sanc-tuary at Eleusis, a handful of officials performed the Mysteries while initi-ates watched from their seats in the Telesterion. Women, slaves, and met-ics sat alongside Athenian citizens when the mystic rites were performed.And significantly, three special Eleusinian priests performed the nocturnalrites: the hierophant (revealer of sacred things), the dadouchos(torch-bearer), and the herald. Each time a witness testified in the summer of 415to the presence of three ritual leaders, Alcibiades was named as one of thethree.Plutarch’s report of Alcibiades’ impious profanation of the Mysteriesactually names Alcibiades as the hierophant and states that he wore the spe-cial robes of the Eleusinian priest, while others served with him as torch-bearer and herald (Plutarch Alcibiades22). All three of these roles in theofficial poliscult were traditionally held by hereditary priests and magis-trates who came from the old noble families of the Eumolpidae and theKerykes. When Alcibiades and his friends took on these cultic roles forthemselves, they assumed religious and civic authority not rightfully theirs.The Athenians understood the profanation of the Mysteries of Demeterto be a civic crime that simultaneously had serious religious and po liti calimplications; what ever happened was likely not drunken revelry or a sillyparody, as some have claimed in the past. The patterns of the profanationsinstead disclosed a secret desire to subvert the authority of the polisand itscivic priesthoods. Whether an oligarchic revolution lay behind the privateand unlawful celebration of Demeter’s civic rites is another matter.In their desperate desire to get to the bottom of these acts of civic impi-ety, the Athenians took mea sures that were highly unusual for them. Theynot only suspended laws that prohibited the torture of citizens, they evenaccepted public testimony in the Assembly from slaves, women, metics,politics, religion, and personality cult153"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"and foreigners. While some citizens did give testimony in the trials of thesummer of 415, the witnesses who gave the most valuable information hadthe lowest po liti cal standing in the polis.The importance of the testimonyof the disenfranchised— the slaves Andromachus and Lydus, the meticTeukros, and the citizen wife Agariste— provides further evidence for ustoday that the civic rites of Demeter did not privilege those worshipperswho had high social status, namely citizen men.As the difficult summer of 415 came to a close, the Athenians tried hardto set their city to rights. At the annual celebration of the Panathenaea thatyear the demosmade good on its promises to award money from the publictrea sury to anyone who could identify the perpetrators of the civic impiety.On the Acropolis before the entire city the Athenians gave the meticTeukros 1,000 drachmas; to the slave Andromachus, the first to speak up,they presented 10,000— a very considerable sum (Andocides On the Mys-teries28). The citizens of Athens did all they could to safeguard their an-cestral nomoi.They even gave sizable rewards to those of low status.the many sides of alcibiadesThe testimony of citizens and noncitizens alike implicated Alcibiades inacts of religious impiety, and these accusations severely limited his abilityto perform on the Athenian po liti cal stage for several years to come. Asthe religious crisis continued to unfold in Athens and the fast ship racedfrom the Piraeus, Nicias, Lamachus, and Alcibiades were nearing Sicilywith the armada. After landing in the south of Italy, where they hoped toestablish a base of operations, they met with unexpected re sis tance. Thethree generals regrouped to discuss possible next steps and strategies. Niciaswished to help settle affairs between the cities at conflict (Segesta andSelinus) and then go home, Lamachus proposed immediately attackingSyracuse (the city most coveted by Athens and currently allied with Seli-nus), and Alcibiades wanted to attack Syracuse only after forging allianceswith neighboring cities. With Lamachus’s support, Alcibiades’ plan wonout (Thucydides 6.47–50). When the fast ship found the Athenian navalcommanders later in the summer of 415, they were off the east coast ofSicily, trying (unsuccessfully) to build alliances against Syracuse. Alcibi-ades was officially recalled to Athens to stand trial. While accompanyingAlcibiades and his ship back to Athens, the convoy stopped in the south-ern Italian city of Thurii. There Alcibiades escaped and fled in the night.When he next resurfaced he was in the heart of the Greek Peloponnese,alcibiades154"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"where he presented himself to the Spartans (Thucydides 6.61, 88). Alcib-iades turned traitor.The Athenians were aghast. The enemies of Alcibiades who had beenwarning others about his treacherous nature and secret wishes for an oli-garchy believed they now had real proof. These enemies led the charge inthe Athenian Assembly, and Alcibiades was found guilty in absentia ofprofaning the Mysteries of Demeter (Thucydides 6.61). The punishmentlevied was the harshest possible. Alcibiades was condemned to death, anda reward was placed on his head. His family property was confiscated, andhis name, along with the names of others found guilty of asebeia,was in-scribed on a special plaque erected on the Acropolis (Fornara 147). Alcibi-ades became an official enemy of the polisand of the city’s gods. TheAthenian demoseven passed an additional decree that called upon thepriests and priestesses of the Eleusinian cult of Demeter to publicly cursehis name along with the names of all others found guilty of profaningDemeter and her rites celebrated at Eleusis (Plutarch Alcibiades22; cf.Thucydides 8.53, 61).Officially banned from Athens, Alcibiades worked closely for the nextfew years with the Spartan leadership, advising them and slowly earningtheir trust. He encouraged the Spartans to send an officer to serve as com-mander alongside the Syracusans, and this commander was instrumentalin helping to put together a strategy that brought defeat to Athens inSicily. Most significantly for Athens, Alcibiades advised the Spartans to es-tablish a permanent military presence in rural Attica by building a fort inthe outlying deme of Decelea (Thucydides 6.91–93, 7.18). In effect thischanged how the Spartans waged war against Athens. In the early years ofthe war, Spartan incursions into Attic territory had been only seasonalevents: in the early summer when the grain was high the Spartans marchednorth across the Isthmus of Corinth and into Attica, where they laid wasteto the crops before retreating back to their home base in the Peloponnese.Most of these invasions were temporary and short- lived—lasting any-where from two to six weeks. But with a permanent fort in northern Atticathe Spartans could menace year- round. Alcibiades knew the Athenians’weaknesses well, and completing the fort at Decelea in the spring of 413had tremendous long- term consequences. The Spartan presence in this re-gion disrupted commerce between Euboea and Athens. For the remainderof the war Athens was forced to spend resources in Decelea, sending outcavalry to skirmish with the Spartans throughout the year. The construc-tion of the fort at Decelea marks a turning point in the course of the war.politics, religion, and personality cult155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Following their betrayal by Alcibiades in 415, ill fortune dogged theAthenians. After the two remaining generals, Nicias and Lamachus, hadalmost reduced Syracuse during a siege in 414, there was a severe crisis inleadership among the Athenians. Lamachus was killed during this siege,and Nicias fell seriously ill. Athenian forces faltered. The renowned pietyof Nicias then became a stumbling block: a lunar eclipse that occurredjust as they were about to withdraw from Syracuse made the Athenian sol-diers and marines uneasy (Thucydides 7.50). Greek scientists and intellec-tuals largely understood the phenomena of lunar and solar eclipses, butthe strange darkness cast by an eclipse was considered ominous by the pious.On this occasion, shortly after the Spartan commander Gylippus arrivedto help the Syracusans, Nicias chose to follow the advice of a seer. Eventhough the Athenians still had time to sail away before another Syracusanattack, Nicias had the soldiers and sailors encamp nearby; they did notmove for nearly a month following the eclipse.A month later the Athenian navy found itself blockaded and defeated atSyracuse. When the men refused to go back on board their ships and in-stead tried to escape overland, they ran short of supplies and were eventu-ally captured. Without ships or any hope of help Nicias felt that the onlything they could do was surrender to the Spartan commander Gylippus.The Athenian soldiers who had survived the betrayal of Alcibiades, thenaval battles, and the shortages of food and other supplies in the confusedland retreat were then thrown into an abandoned quarry outside Syracuse.The Syracusans— acting over the objection of Gylippus— executed Niciasand the other Athenian commander by publicly slitting their throats(Thucydides 7.86). Thucydides reports that for two months, more than7,000 men starved, suffered, and died in their own filth in the quarry be-fore some non- Athenian survivors were sold into slavery. The Atheniansand their allies were deliberately left behind in the quarry to rot. And sothe Sicilian Expedition ended in complete failure for the Athenians(Thucydides 7.87).In the fall of 413, just as the Athenians were coming to grips with theSpartan occupation of a fort in Decelea, they received the news that thegreat Sicilian expedition had ended in total disaster. At first the Atheniansrefused to believe that so great an undertaking could meet with such de-struction. But as more reports arrived the truth became undeniable, andcitizens grew angry at the oracle readers and seers who had prophesied theconquest of Sicily when the armada set sail from the Piraeus two years ear-lier (Thucydides 8.1).

He could see the Athenians’ empire declining, and he encouraged theSpartans to devise plans that would take further advantage of Athenianweaknesses. The Spartans developed a new navy and established diplomaticties with Persia. Cities in the Athenian archethat wished to revolt petitionedthe Spartans for military and financial assistance. As more Greek poleisinAsia Minor called upon the Spartans for aid, representatives from the neigh-boring Greek cities under Persian rule accompanied the diplomatic missionsto Sparta. The Persians, too, promised aid to Sparta. Both Tissaphernes,who governed the Persian provinces on the coast of Ionia, and Pharnabazus,the satrap who administered the area around the Hellespont, sought al-liances with Sparta. Alcibiades had by now earned the trust of the Spartanleadership, and he persuaded the Spartans to support a revolt and accept analliance with Tissaphernes (Thucydides 8.17–19; cf. 8.37). The substantialPersian resources— money, men, and ships— could give Sparta the edge itneeded to defeat the Athenians. In return for Persian support, the Spartanspromised to hand over to the Persian Empire at the end of the war all Greekcities in Ionia that Persia had lost in conflicts with Greek poleisseveral gen-erations earlier in the 470s and 460s, thereby allowing the Great King ofPersia to collect his tribute.Persia’s entrance into the conflict between Athens and Sparta marks an-other significant shift in the course of the war, and indicates a new direc-tion for Alcibiades as he maneuvered within the limitations that the Athe-nians’ curse had placed upon him. Spartan support for the ongoing revoltsin eastern cities of the Athenian empire also sets the stage for the finalphase of the conflict between Athens and Sparta: from this time on, mostof the action would occur in the eastern Aegean along the Ionian coast ofAsia Minor. In the naval war that followed, Sparta kept pressure onAthens while maintaining its alliance with Persia, and Athens maintainedits navy while working to keep allies in the empire. To fund the war in Ioniathe Athenian demosvoted to draw on reserve funds in the trea sury on theAcropolis that Pericles had set aside at the beginning of the war as a precau-tion, including sacred funds intended for gods (Thucydides 8.15; cf. 2.24).Meanwhile the Athenian navy was actively supporting a revolt against theruling oligarchic faction on the island of Samos off the coast of Ionia.

Apparently the Spartans became aware of his questionableprivate behavior, and the Spartan general Agis reportedly grew to hate him.Plutarch (Alcibiades23) rec ords that Alcibiades had carried on an illicit af-fair with Agis’s wife (who bore him a child), and Thucydides simply statesthat the Spartans wanted him dead. In fear for his life among the Spartansand unable to return to Athens because of the curses and death sentenceagainst him, Alcibiades turned to the only potential friends he had left: Tis-saphernes and the Persians. The man who had betrayed the Athenians andgone over to the Spartan side in 415 now betrayed the Spartans, too (Thucy-dides 8.45).Once established in the court of Tissaphernes, Alcibiades assumed an ad-visory role, and took his first steps toward rapprochement with the Atheni-ans who had found him guilty of asebeia.He counseled Tissaphernes to playAthens and Sparta off one another while stringing along the Spartans with(mostly empty) promises of ships and abundant money. Perhaps Alcibiadessubtly undermined Sparta and articulated to Tissaphernes the advantages ofan eventual alliance with Athens. Such would appear to be the case, becausehe quickly made contact with aristocratic friends among the Athenians sta-tioned on nearby Samos. Alcibiades expressed his desire to return to Athens,but since he had been found guilty of religious charges he first needed po lit-i cal allies to arrange a pardon for him. He brokered a deal with some Athe-nian leaders on Samos. If they would clear his name in Athens he would dotwo things for them in return: he would help them establish an oligarchy inAthens, and he would bring Persia and Persian money over to the Athenianside. With Persian assistance Athens could defeat Sparta, and with Alcibi-ades’ help the aristocracy could be the ones to lead the Athenians to victory.The only thing standing in Alcibiades’ way was his civic impiety and guilt inprofaning the Mysteries of Demeter.Alcibiades’ friendship with Tissaphernes and the Great King held out thepossibility of great wealth for the demos,and Alcibiades and his supporterson Samos relied on the greed of soldiers and sailors to win them over. Butany potential Persian financial support would come at a high price: relin-quishing demo cratic rule in Athens. Although the rank- and- file soldiersagreed, Alcibiades’ plan did not bring about his immediate restoration. Atleast one general, named Phrynicus, could see the raw ambition behindalcibiades158"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Alcibiades’ plan. There followed a series of secret messages, betrayals, andreprisals as the Athenian and Spartan leaders and Tissaphernes all jockeyedfor position. Back in Athens circumstances were ripe for revolution. Whenan Athenian officer named Pisander arrived in Athens with a delegation toreport on the situation on Samos, Alcibiades’ offers to establish an alliancewith Persia and a “different” form of democracy in Athens met with re sis -tance. Some were opposed to the change in government, and those who were still angered by Alcibiades’ past lawlessness and impiety were espe-cially outraged. The priests of Demeter took a hard position in the Assem-bly and they called upon the gods in their efforts to block Alcibiades’ return(Thucydides 8.53).In the end Demeter’s priests lost that debate: Pisander persuaded thedemosthat Alcibiades was the only man who could save Athens and theempire, and he traveled back to Samos with the news. But when he andAlcibiades sat down to negotiate with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades inexplica-bly changed course: as he negotiated between Tissaphernes and Pisanderhe made the Persian demands on Athens so great that the talks had to fail.When Pisander and the Athenians realized they could not rely on Alcibi-ades, they abandoned the talks and pursued an oligarchic revolution with-out him. Even the Athenian naval leaders on Samos gave up on Alcibiadeswhen they saw he could not deliver on his promises (Thucydides 8.56).After the talks between Alcibiades, Pisander, and Tissaphernes failed, acoup unfolded in Athens even without Alcibiades leading it (Thucydides 8.63–70). Pisander’s first reports had stirred up aristocratic hetaireiaiinAthens, and some elites quietly prepared to overthrow the democracy. Bythe time Pisander returned to Athens in 411, several demo cratic leaders hadbeen mysteriously murdered. While the ekklesiaand bouledid continue tomeet, a group of aristocrats (eventually called the Four Hundred) was sys-tematically placing itself in power. On the advice of the Four Hundredthe Athenian demosvoted to suspend the old constitution and ruled thatcitizens would no longer receive pay for public ser vice. Their provisionsfor a less selective body called the Five Thousand were a sham, at least ini-tially, since the Four Hundred never convened it.The duty of the demosto maintain po liti cal relationships by practicingcivic cult remained in place. At first the Four Hundred were careful abouttheir use of ancestral religious customs and symbols. They initially choseto assume civic authority not in the heart of the city but a little outsidethe city walls in a sanctuary of Poseidon, a fitting place, since this god,whose authority extended over the sea— and hence a naval empire— had apolitics, religion, and personality cult159"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"tradition of conflict with Athena on the Acropolis. Later, when the FourHundred moved into the council chamber in the Agora they used tradi-tional religious rites to normalize their seizure of power. Thucydides reportsthat they spoke all the ancestral prayers and made all the customary sacri-fices that accompanied taking office (Thucydides 8.67). But for all the ap-pearance of normality at the cultic level, the administration they put intoplace was far from normal, and expressing po liti cal dissent became danger-ous. A handful of citizens who exhibited demo cratic tendencies were killed,a few mysteriously disappeared, and many were imprisoned or banished.Alcibiades had not yet given up his hopes of overturning the curse andreturning to Athens, and he maintained his connections with the soldiersand sailors on Samos who had helped ignite the revolution in the firstplace. The sailors soon resisted the new oligarchy in Athens, especially af-ter hearing reports of how harshly the Four Hundred were ruling. Oncethe sailors realized their latent power, they determined to restore democ-racy in Athens and return the city to the rule of the ancestral laws that hadbeen undone. After deposing their generals and electing new ones withmore demo cratic inclinations, the army looked for a spokesman who couldbest represent their cause. They turned to Alcibiades. They voted to par-don him of all charges, even the religious ones; they brought him backfrom exile and immediately made him general. Alcibiades— adviser for thedemos,the Spartans, the Persians, and the Athenian aristocracy— was backto being a favorite of the people (Thucydides 8.76–82).Although the sailors pardoned Alcibiades on Samos, the guilty verdictand the curses still hung over his head in Athens, where the reign of theFour Hundred continued and grew even more ruthless. One of their ob-jectives appears to have been peace; they repeatedly sent envoys to theSpartans, but none of their attempts met with success. As the Four Hun-dred received reports from Samos they began disagreeing among them-selves on key issues: on how to defend the city and its port, how to re-spond to Alcibiades, and whether to make peace with Sparta. Even thestatus of the Four Hundred itself came into question. While some inpower wished to maintain an extreme oligarchy, men who claimed to bemore moderate among the Four Hundred wanted to empower the FiveThousand in earnest.Infighting among the Four Hundred reached a peak when they startedto kill each other and to pervert established social and ritual customs. Re-gardless of the type of regime, oligarchic or demo cratic, Athenian citizensdefined themselves by their relationships to their sacrificial communitiesalcibiades160"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"among the living, and by their obligations to their dead ancestors. Main-taining a burial monument by performing tomb cult at the proper timeswas a responsibility upheld by every male citizen. It served such an impor-tant function that men without adult sons would adopt in order to ensurethe continuity of rites performed at ancestral tombs. Tomb cult, like thecivic rituals discussed in chapter 2, was an area where democracy and reli-gion were thoroughly implicated in one another. The absence of tomb cultcould have devastating effects on both the individual and the community.Such effects were felt by one of the principal leaders of the Four Hun-dred, Phrynicus, who was assassinated in the Agora after returning from afailed peace mission to Sparta. His assassin slipped away. But then Phryn-icus was put on trial and found guilty of treason afterhis death. Critias, ademagogue with considerable rhetorical expertise, led the motion to ex-hume his body (Lycurgus 112–15). Although exhuming a grave and revok-ing the privileges of citizenship from a corpse sounds grisly if not bizarreto us, in the context of fifth- century Athens the punishment carried realmeaning. Because they lost all possibility for tomb cult on Attic soil, Phryn-icus and his entire family had their family cult rites and many po liti calrights stripped away: Phrynicus’s descendants were forbidden from takingpart in po liti cal and cultic activities that involved him and his ancestralburial monument. The ability to memorialize the dead through ancestralrites could become highly politicized in this society, especially during war -time. Pericles’ funeral oration at the start of the war demonstrated thepower that these civic rites held for the living, and the fate of fallen warriorsin a battle a few years later would come to haunt the Athenians in moreways than one.Critias’s role in this episode is noteworthy both for his past and his per-sonal connections: he was related to Andocides, he was known to be a closeassociate of Alcibiades, and he had been imprisoned after being named byDiocleides in the mutilation of the herms in 415. He was released after An-docides gave his testimony. Although the mutilation of the herms and theprofanation of the Mysteries had happened four years earlier, the bitter-ness surrounding the accusations of religious impiety made in the summerof 415 continued to have an impact on Athenian po liti cal life. Critiaswould later take a leading role in the second oligarchic government of 404,where he would stand out as an extremist.As the situation grew increasingly dire in Athens, counterrevolution andcivil war erupted. The navy on Samos had effectively mutinied, and somearmed hoplites in Athens and the Piraeus supported the moderates and thepolitics, religion, and personality cult161"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Five Thousand. As in the earlier rise of the Four Hundred, the significanceof religious sanctuaries in Athenian po liti cal life again became evident.The hoplites who supported the moderates met in an alternative assembly,and when they did so they convened in a sanctuary of Dionysus in thePiraeus. They used the theater space in a sacred precinct as a meeting placeto discuss their response to the Four Hundred back in Athens, just asthose oligarchs had met in the temple of Poseidon at Colonus (Thucy-dides 8.93). Dionysus was a god whose rites encouraged the demosto ques-tion the ruling power structures (see chapter 6), and when the moderatedemo crats met in this god’s urban sanctuary at Athens’ harbor they con-tinued that tradition of internal po liti cal criticism.Alcibiades’ maneuvering among Athenian forces stationed on Samossoon paid off: the demo cratic faction in Athens got the upper hand. ASpartan naval incursion into Euboea helped bring about the end of theFour Hundred, whose hurried response failed to keep the large island justnorth of Attica in the empire. With the Four Hundred in disarray, theAthenian demostook again to assembling at the Pnyx. Only a few monthsafter they had seized power the Four Hundred were deposed, and democ-racy was partially restored with the government of the Five Thousand,who were by definition armed hoplites capable of supplying their ownweapons. Before long the assembled citizens voted to officially rescind theexile of Alcibiades. They sent messengers to Samos to urge him to acceptthe new government, and the man who helped instigate an oligarchic coupin 412 became a supporter of the new regime of 411/0. Soon thereafterdemocracy was fully restored (Thucydides 8.97–98).But Alcibiades did not yet return home to Athens to resolve the issuessurrounding his impious behavior. As general of the fleet in Samos heturned his attention north to the Hellespont. Late in 411 he won an impor-tant victory at Cyzicus over the Spartans, who continued to benefit fromtheir alliance with the Persians. Alcibiades remained in this region as gen-eral of the Athenian fleet until 407. When he did arrive back in Athensearly in the summer of 407, Alcibiades defended himself before the As-sembly against what he claimed were unjust charges associated with pro-faning the Mysteries of Demeter (Xenophon Hellenica1.4). Although hestill had some po liti cal enemies, Alcibiades now had many more support-ers, who voted to clear him of all charges of impiety. The inscriptions onthe Acropolis recording his crimes against Demeter were thrown into thesea (Diodorus 13.69), and his confiscated property was restored (Plutarch Alcibiades33). The Athenian demosplaced all its hope in him, and theyalcibiades162"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"passed a decree ordering the city’s priests of Demeter to revoke their ear-lier curses. It is impossible to know the priests’ personal opinions aboutthis order, but it was their official pardon that fully restored Alcibiades toAthenian public life as a civic leader in the tradition of Pericles. Many con-sidered Alcibiades the only man capable of returning Athens to its earlierglory, and they voted to make him supreme commander of the Athenianforces.Once cleared of the charges associated with profaning the Mysteries,Alcibiades’ first public act underscored the close ties between Athenianpo liti cal life and civic worship at ancestral festivals. It was now autumn,the month of Boedromion and time to celebrate the Mysteries of Demeter.Because of the Spartan fort in Decelea the Athenians had suspended thecustomary march through the countryside of Attica, and instead initiatesapproached Eleusis by sea every fall. That year Alcibiades reinstated themarch of the initiates, and he was the one who led the pro cession fromAthens to Eleusis (Xenophon Hellenica1.4; Plutarch Alcibiades34). Withthe army and ephebes in tow, Alcibiades accompanied the civic priests andpriestesses of Demeter and the sacred cult objects in the baskets and carts.The civic rites of Demeter were unusually grand that year. Alcibiades, aman found guilty of profaning Demeter’s mystic rites, sentenced to deathand publicly cursed by Demeter’s priests, and later publicly pardoned bythese same civic priests, gloriously demonstrated his outward civic piety tothe Athenian demosand their ancestral nomoi.ancestral practices and the end of an empireThe war in the Aegean continued, even as Alcibiades led the celebration ofthe Mysteries in Athens and Eleusis. Ionia in 406 was the scene of the nextpivotal confrontation between Sparta and Athens. Any renewed confi-dence the Athenians felt after the return of Alcibiades was immediatelydashed: at Notium Lysander led the Spartans to victory against the Athe-nian fleet. Alcibiades had left command of the fleet to his lieutenant andwas not present at this battle. Athenian disappointment with their generalwas proportionate to the heady welcome he had received just a year earlier.They deposed Alcibiades and voted in ten entirely new generals. One ofthese new generals was Pericles the son of Pericles and Aspasia.

Meanwhile Alcibiades retreatedto a private fort he owned on the Hellespont and withdrew from activeduty.Lysander commanded a Spartan naval force that now had the full sup-port of the Persian prince Cyrus, who had recently taken control of the Per-sian fleet from Tissaphernes. The next naval engagement between Athensand Sparta resulted in victory for the Athenians. Further north of Notiumnear Mytilene lay the Arginusae islands, a chain that stretched between themainland and the island of Lesbos. The battle there was fought in tightquarters and both sides lost many men and ships, but the tactics of theAthenian fleet brought defeat to the Spartans and their allies. The Atheni-ans captured seventy Spartan ships. As the Spartans fled to neighboringChios some of the Athenians pursued them, and others patrolled the wa-ters to pick up the dead and wounded from disabled and wrecked ships. Asudden storm that blew up cut short their efforts (Xenophon Hellenica1.6).Despite the victory, news of the failure to recover all the survivors anddead bodies after the naval victory at Arginusae drew an immediate andnegative response back in Athens, and the generals were called home. Ofthose who commanded at Arginusae, two simply fled rather than face theAthenian demos.When the remaining six generals appeared before the As-sembly to give an account of the battle and the sudden violence of thestorm that followed, they found themselves, in effect, put on trial. Manyissues came into play here— accountability, decision making, custom, andthe rule of law. Theramenes, who had served at Arginusae as a naval offi-cer, led those who insisted that the blame for failing to rescue survivorsand gather the dead should fall on the generals and not the ship com-manders like himself. But Xenophon also reports that bribes changedhands, and that the Athenian people were deliberately deceived (Hellenica1.7). The irregular “trial” held before the Assembly was plagued with pro-cedural problems; emotions were running extremely high, and at onepoint members of the prytany, the executive committee presiding over theAssembly meeting, were so intimidated that they permitted the people toundermine their own established laws. Only one member of that commit-tee stood up and refused to act contrary to ancestral laws of the polis.Through an odd quirk of fate, we happen to know the identity of thatlone dissenting prytany member: Socrates. In an irrational and deludedrush to justice, the Assembly then tried the generals not as individuals, asrequired by law, but as an entire group. All six were found guilty and exe-cuted by the state— including Pericles’ son (Xenophon Hellenica1.7).alcibiades164"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Arginusae turned out to be the bitterest of victories. The intense andconflicted atmosphere of the generals’ trial in Athens created a social andpo liti cal storm that was ultimately far more destructive than the storm atsea that thwarted the rescue mission. Many issues that came into play here, but they evidently included civic piety, impiety, and tomb cult. Thesame concern for the proper observance of ancestral burial customs thatwas apparent in the curious post mortem condemnation of Phrynicus in410 became politicized again in the trial of the generals in 406. Survivorsfrom ships that had been crippled in naval engagements were normallyrescued following a battle, and it was likewise customary to collect the deadand give them a solemn state burial. While the type of ancestral tomb cultpracticed by families in Attica could not be exactly followed at a massgrave overseas, nonetheless a publicly marked grave did allow survivors torespect traditional funerary rites for fallen warriors. When the suddenstorm blew up, commanders were faced with a tough decision: when didthe safety and well- being of the surviving men on sound ships take pre ce -dence over the rights of the men who died at sea or the wounded whoseships were wrecked? What is the responsibility of the living in regard tothe men who died serving the polis?The relationship between the individual and po liti cal/religious groupswas on every Athenian’s mind at this time. In the midst of the trial of thegenerals Athenians were celebrating an annual three- day civic festivalcalled the Apatouria, ancient Ionian rites held in the fall among the vener-able religious groups of citizens called phratries. Each phratry held its owncelebration. During the festival phratry members met to sacrifice togetherand to welcome new members into the group— ceremonies were desig-nated to welcome babies, ephebes, and wives. The Apatouria was a timewhen extended families and networks of friends gathered together tofeast, socialize, and worship the gods. But this year some families who hadrecently lost men at Arginusae were in mourning, and the Apatouria be-came a stage for po liti cal maneuvering. Theramenes reportedly instructedsome of his friends attending the festivals to pretend they were in mourn-ing; they came to the Assembly dressed in mourning clothes and with theirhair ritually shorn, and they raised the emotional intensity among every-one gathered at the Pnyx (Xenophon Hellenica1.7).The issues as defined by the speakers and citizens in the Assembly thatday focused on burial rites for citizens, above all the civic funerary rites formen who died serving the demosand the naval empire. Yet at a deeper levelthe trial of the generals was also motivated by some citizens’ desire to exertpolitics, religion, and personality cult165"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"their influence over the demosas the military conflict with Sparta and Per-sia grew more desperate. The need for patient consideration and thought-ful decision making gave way to po liti cal infighting. Contrary to all customand law, the six generals on trial were denied the right to defend themselvesas individuals when it was moved that they be tried as a group. The prytanypresiding over the Assembly that day initially resisted the motion to abro-gate the standard trial procedures for individual citizens. But the frantic en-ergy of the demospersuaded all but one of the sitting prytany members tochange their minds. Only by deciding to change traditional judicial proce-dures could the demo cratic Assembly vote to execute all six generals. Thewill of the people stood fast, even when the demoscontradicted itself andits own acknowledged customs. Some in the Assembly, like Theramenes,contended that the generals’ act of disregarding civic burial rites for fallensoldiers deserved a guilty verdict, but that claim may have been only a pre-text for simple self- interest. By evoking the authority of ancestral funeraryrites Theramenes saved his own skin.The final and decisive naval engagement of the war happened not muchlater, to the east in the critical waterway of the Hellespont. Given the loss ofeight experienced and victorious Athenian generals after Arginusae (six exe-cuted and two in exile), the Athenian navy was demoralized, and it was alsorunning low on funds. When the Spartan naval commander Lysander at-tacked undefended Athenian ships beached on the shore near Aegospotamiin the Hellespont he virtually wiped out the fleet— only 9 of 180 ships es-caped. Lysander then ruthlessly executed the several thousand Atheniansailors taken prisoner (Xenophon Hellenica2.1). The loss of so many shipsand men compromised the security of Athens and its harbors, and aftergathering reinforcements in the Aegean Lysander sailed for the coast of At-tica and blockaded the Piraeus. In the meantime Spartan land forces underthe commander Pausanias marched on Athens and laid siege to the city. TheAthenians held out for a few months. With the grain trade interrupted afterthe loss at Aegospotami and facing starvation during the stormy winter, theyfinally capitulated in the spring of 404. Tradition has it that the Spartanstore down the Long Walls between Athens and Piraeus to the sound of flutesplaying and with festive dancing (Xenophon Hellenica2.2).Some of Athens’ enemies were now urging the Spartans to mete out tothe Athenians the same sort of harsh justice that Athens had dealt to up-start allies in their arche:kill or enslave the citizens, demolish the defeatedcity, and transform Athena’s land into pastureland sacred to Apollo. Butthe Spartans looked beyond any impulse for vengeance. They recalled thealcibiades166"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"losses Athens had suffered in the Persian Wars two generations earlierwhen the Athenians united with the Spartans, abandoned Athens, and al-lowed the Persian army to destroy their city twice. Instead of razing Athensthe Spartans generously permitted the city to remain standing— minus itsdefensive walls. Sparta’s terms for peace further required Athens to relin-quish the naval empire that had for many de cades shaped Athenian do-mestic and foreign policy. Finally, Spartan terms required the Athenians torecall po liti cal exiles and reinstate their ancestral constitution and nomoi— all the customs that ordered po liti cal life and directed the civic rites that were sacred to the gods.The victorious Spartan Lysander had never been overly fond of democ-racies, and to help the Athenians implement their ancestral laws he sus-pended the demo cratic institutions that Athens was famous far. Lysanderor ga nized an interim oligarchic government of thirty commissioners who were charged with reinstating the ancestral constitution, the patrios politeia.The oligarchic faction within the Athenian populace had long expressedaristocratic tendencies that favored Sparta. These tendencies were appar-ent in everything from pro- Spartan policies during the war itself to fash-ion statements. Young aristocratic men wore their hair long in an old- fashioned style that was associated with Spartan warrior culture, and theydressed more austerely. Pro- Spartan, oligarchic tendencies had enduredafter the restoration of the democracy in 410, and some aristocrats contin-ued to meet together in their private associations called hetaireiai.When the oligarchs came into power with the help of Lysander in 404,they ruled reasonably at first. The Thirty won the support of the demoswith a handful of sensible judicial reforms, and the Spartans fully sup-ported their oligarchic regime. But this committee proved to be far harsherthan the Four Hundred who had ruled in 411–410 and their rule soon grewtyrannical. Among the members of the Thirty were men from the familyof Plato: Critias, the uncle of Plato’s mother, and Charmides, Critias’sadopted son and Plato’s cousin. Critias was reputed to be among the mostharsh of the Thirty. Theramenes, a moderate oligarch who had aban-doned the Four Hundred when their methods became overbearing in 410,was also appointed to this commission, and again his voice was among themore temperate.Initially the Thirty empowered their po liti cal allies, establishing tensympathetic administrators in the Piraeus and appointing eleven commis-sioners in charge of prisons. The Thirty then went to work removingtheir opponents from office or disfranchising them. Only those whompolitics, religion, and personality cult167"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"they approved had full citizen rights. Prisons were soon filled with citizenprisoners who opposed the Thirty’s policies. As their rule grew moreruthless, the Thirty maintained authority by employing 300 attendantsarmed with whips who patrolled the public areas. In short order, morethan 1,500 Athenian citizens had been assassinated and countless othersunlawfully detained. Metics suffered too; even though they were notamong the demossome metics had accumulated considerable propertyand the Thirty were keen to imprison or secretly kill them so they couldconfiscate their wealth (Aristotle Athenian Constitution35).Critias and the more extreme among the Thirty met with oppositionfrom the committee’s moderate members, as well as from courageous citi-zens. When Theramenes stuck to his moderate position and protested thatthe Thirty’s methods were becoming too extreme, Critias had his namestruck from the roll of select aristocratic citizens who enjoyed the full pro-tection of the law. Theramenes was publicly executed at once (AristotleAthenian Constitution37). Another famous instance of re sis tance to theThirty’s terror involved a rich metic named Leon of Salamis and the Thirty’spractice of covert po liti cal assassination. Plato and Xenophon describe indetail how the Thirty killed so many Athenians so quickly: they called insmall groups of citizens who were not among the Thirty’s leadership andcommanded them to go out and assassinate certain other citizens or riskbeing killed themselves. In this way, the Thirty implicated as many as pos-sible in their oligarchic violence. On one occasion they summoned fivemen and commanded them to kill Leon of Salamis. One of the five citi-zens flatly refused to participate in the hit squad, and this citizen wasSocrates (Plato Apolog y32d; cf. Xenophon Memorabilia1.2.32).In response to the Thirty’s reign of terror, citizens and metics with dem-o cratic sympathies fled Athens and or ga nized themselves under Thrasybu-lus on the border of Attica and Boeotia. When the demo crats in exile hadsufficient forces they sailed into the Piraeus and engaged the Thirty’sarmy. A civil war in Athens raged in the summer of 403, and Critias diedin a battle waged alongside the remnants of the Long Walls near the har-bor. The Spartan governor Lysander supported the Thirty’s rule, but theirauthoritarian control became so brutal that the two Spartan commandersLysander and Pausanias could not agree on a course of action. In the endPausanias undermined Lysander by marching to Athens with Spartanforces and ultimately compelling the two sides to reconcile. A full amnestywas proclaimed for everyone on both sides— everyone except for theThirty and their immediate subordinates.

And so the fifth century, which began with the destruction ofAthens in a foreign war, ended with the fall of Athens at the hands of for-mer allies and a civil war among Athenians.The ultimate fate of Alcibiades was also decided at this time, and it wasjust as grim as what was happening in Athens. Before the Athenians capitu-lated to Lysander, Alcibiades turned traitor one last time. His offer of helpand advice at Aegospotami was rejected in 405 (Xenophon Hellenica2.1),and shortly thereafter he sought refuge under the Persian satrap Pharn-abazus, who provided him with a haven in Phrygia. In the end Alcibiadeswas assassinated in 404, perhaps by orders of Lysander and the Persians. Ac-cording to Plutarch, agents ambushed his house and set fire to it. They thenstabbed him as he ran out of the burning building (Plutarch Alcibiades39).He could never return to Athens again.When Xenophon in his Hellenica(1.4) recalled the fateful return of Al-cibiades to Athens in the summer of 407, he related the claim of someAthenians that even then they recognized a bad omen. Plutarch too pre-serves a similar account (Alcibiades34). On the day that Alcibiades de-cided to sail into the Piraeus the Athenians were celebrating the Plynteria,an annual festival of Athena held in the early summer. Athenian women,maidens, and ephebes took an ancient seated statue of the goddess fromthe Acropolis, stripped it of its usual robes and adornments, veiled it, andpro cessed down to the sea at Phaleron, where maidens washed the woodencult image in the sea. It was thought to be an unlucky day; many temples were closed and public business was suspended. Because the image wascovered when it arrived at the sea where Alcibiades was disembarking,some thought that Athens’ patron goddess was not willing to welcome himhome. Alcibiades returned anyway. These accounts of Alcibiades’ returnand Athena’s rejection were composed well after the fall of Athens and thedeath of Alcibiades, and they bear witness to the ways in which Athenianscame to later understand how their city’s ancient rituals anticipated Alcib-iades’ fate.politics, religion, and personality cult169"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"all things are in flux.Plato famously attributed this aphorism to theIonian phi los o pher Heraclitus (Cratylus402a). Alcibiades’ twists and turns,from Athens to Sparta to Persia to Athens, certainly illustrated the flux ofpower and personality, and Athenians who during one de cade suffered twocoups, two counterrevolutions, and a general amnesty could speak directlyto the often painful pro cess of po liti cal transformation. But long beforeAlcibiades, Heraclitus, or Plato there was Dionysus, the god with the greatpower to transform. Grapes yielded wine, the youth matured to adult-hood, the domestic wife could become wild with Dionysian madness, andthe masks of drama revealed truth. Whereas life led to death in the natu-ral order of things, death itself yielded to renewed life with the regenera-tive energy of Dionysus.Dionysus today beckons as one of the most recognizable of the Olympiangods. His close association with wine leads many modern readers to identifyhim as the god of intoxication, but the Greeks generally drank their wine di-luted with water— only barbarians drank it neat— and in fifth- century artand literature Dionysus is seldom depicted actually drinking wine or intoxi-cated. Viewing Dionysus mainly as a drunken god limits our potential forunderstanding Athenian religious life.

Dionysus inspired not simple intoxication but rathertransformation at the natural, the individual, and the collective levels.Like Demeter, the Greek god called Dionysus began as a deity with par- tic u lar connections to agriculture and fertility, and only later developedadditional cultural resonances for men and women who lived in markettowns and small cities. By the fifth century the civic face of Dionysus inAthens looked in two directions: toward the rural countryside and towardthe city with the Agora and its po liti cal institutions. The state festivals thatAthenians celebrated reflected both aspects of Dionysus’s identity. As thegod of the grapevine, Dionysus was the agricultural deity whose beneficialpowers extended over an important product in the economy of Attica.According to ancestral tradition he watched over the cultivation of thegrapevine and the wine made from grapes. Nurturing the vines requiredcareful attention across generations, and invoking the protective presenceof this god at the right times of the year kept grapevines under his protec-tion. But Dionysus also became a god who brought new forms of cultureto people dwelling in the city, and Dionysian dramatic festivals were gen-erally celebrated in or very near the Agora in the fifth century. Just as theworship of Demeter changed over time, so the festivals of Dionysus werealso adjusted to reflect the interests of a unified and autonomous polis,andlater the Athenian empire.Familiar images that depict Dionysus with wine cups and masks onlypartially reflect the state of extant evidence. Inscriptional and archaeologi-cal sources augment our knowledge of the god of the vine and madness,and illustrate for us further complexities of religious life in the polytheisticpolisof classical Athens. Athenian civic calendars document how Dionysusshared festivals with Apollo as well as with Hermes and Athena. Publicfestivals celebrated in the demes and in the center of Athens featured dra-matic per for mances; these tragic festivals offered perhaps the most visibleway to take part in and experience the power of Dionysus, but other civicholidays for this god were celebrated in the private homes of Athenians,among extended families and groups of intimate friends. Unlike the civicworship of Athena that generally took place on the prominent height ofthe Acropolis, not all fifth- century civic traditions that honored Dionysusat home or in the countryside required grand building programs. Theatersduring the lifetimes of Pericles and Socrates were temporary woodenstructures disassembled when the festivals were over, and Dionysus’s sanc-tuary on the south slope of the Acropolis contained a simple and modestwine, theater, and transformation171"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"temple. Historians find it difficult if not impossible to fully document allthe Dionysian festivals, but sources do consistently confirm that the festi-val system in Athens encompassed the entire po liti cal community in thecity and countryside to create a whole, coherent system.The details of Dionysus’s exploits preserved in archaic and classical poetryhint further at the flexibility of the Greek religious mentality. Dionysus wasa god of life as embodied in the grapevine, a god of the dead, and a god ofthe potential to overcome death. Dionysus was celebrated for simply havingarrived long ago among the Athenians. His initial arrival happened by sea inone account, and by land in another. He could appear in animal or human form— as a beardless youth, a bearded mature man, or a young woman. Inone tragedy produced on the Athenian stage in the late fifth century, trueDionysian madness is reserved not for the god but for those mortals who donot have the sense to worship Dionysus at his civic festivals and thus to ex-perience his presence alongside other residents of the polis.The walled imperial Athens of Pericles’ and Socrates’ lifetimes grew intoa densely populated urban center, many of whose citizens were probablymore concerned with current events, the administration of the polis,andthe status of the archethan with the condition of vineyards and the out-look for the year’s grape harvest. The civic festivals of Dionysus activelyreminded all Athenian residents of their close historic ties to traditionallife in the Attic countryside. Of the five major Dionysian festivals cele-brated in the fifth century, two drew attention to viticulture and the pro-duction of wine, while three placed emphasis on wine and its place in dra-matic per for mance and competition. Some of the themes that emergedfrom Dionysian worship also resurfaced in different forms in the god’smore secretive mysteriaand orgia.Athenian traditions surrounding Diony-sus provide another glimpse into how civic worship extended throughoutthe polisand helped transform po liti cal life in the classical city. The vari-eties of expression found in Dionysus’s civic rites reveal a good deal aboutthe continuities of Athenian social and po liti cal life, continuities that tran-scended the traumatic po liti cal changes that wracked Athens as the empirecame to an end.anthesteria: dionysus and hermesThe rhythm of Dionysian worship in the civic calendar of Athens focusedon the winter months, from the time in the late autumn when harvestedgrapes were pressed into new wine to the spring when the new wine was firstdionysus172"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"opened and tasted. Within these six months were situated at least five pub-licly financed festivals for the god: the Oschophoria, the Rural Dionysia, theLenaea, the Anthesteria, and the City Dionysia. Four of these festivals lastedthree or more days; this totals more than two weeks of public Dionysian cel-ebration during the cool winter when the demands of the agricultural econ-omy were less compelling. Like the civic festivals discussed in earlier chapters,public rituals for Dionysus required dedications: offerings of grain, libationsof wine, and animal sacrifices with the festive communal meals that fol-lowed thysia.State festivals offered the residents of Athens a respite fromwork, whether they labored in the markets and industries of the city and itsharbor, or on the farms in the outlying rural demes and villages.In the spring of the year the Anthesteria celebrated the civilizing power ofDionysus experienced in the transformation of the harvested grape intowine, the essential beverage of Greek ritual practice and human social inter-action. Grapes can grow even in the wild, but it takes human culture to cre-ate wine. New wine that had been stored in the fall was for the first timeopened in the spring at a three- day festival that ran from the 11th to the 13thof Anthesterion, approximately late February or early March. The Antheste-ria was one of the oldest of Athenian festivals, widely observed among poleisthat claimed an Ionian heritage, and so probably dated back to at least theninth century. Though each day of the Anthesteria had its own par tic u larmood and festivities, all three days alike brought to mind the god who helpedcivilize humans with the gift of the vine and the knowledge of how to turnthe grape into wine. Anthesterion, the month of antheaor flowers, was atime for new life and new beginnings, both for poliscommunities as a wholeand for the individual residents. The new wine symbolized the annual re-newal, and rituals celebrated during the festival showed how the wine ofDionysus had the ability to invigorate the civic community when residents were allowed to reexperience the city from a different perspective. At thesame time that residents experienced new beginnings, the spirits of the deadalso returned for the Anthesteria. The god of transformation required Athe-nians to dissolve their normal social order and change the way they typicallyexperienced their communities.Each day of the Anthesteria had its own name— Pithoigia, Choes, and Chytroi— and these names concretely recalled the god of the grape by re-ferring to customs of storing and serving wine. Storing new wine when itwas first pressed required skills beyond those of a farmer in the country-side, namely the skills of the potters who produced the vessels needed tostore and transport the liquid and then serve and consume it. Ceramicwine, theater, and transformation173"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"skills were another mark of men who live in a civilized community, andAthenian craftsmen excelled in the production and decoration of pottery,especially after the sixth century. The En glish word “ceramic” comes fromthe neighborhood in Athens where skilled potters plied their craft: theKerameikos (also spelled Ceramicus). The Anthesteria festival celebratedDionysus by evoking the skills that enabled an ancient Mediterranean so-ciety to capture the power of the grapevine: each of the three days wasnamed for a different type of vessel used for wine.The first day, Pithoigia, celebrated the opening of large storage jars calledpithoi.New wine had been stored and sealed in pithoiafter the initial winepressing in the fall, and vessels were ceremoniously brought to Athens,where civic priests opened the jars and dedicated the wine to Dionysus.When first opened the new wine dedicated at the Anthesteria constitutedan aparche— a first fruits offering to the god. This initial opening tookplace in the sanctuary of Dionysus in the Marshes, a sanctuary that has yetto be identified. The Pithoigia filled an important function for the polisduring this time of year, since it required the citizen farmers of Attica togather as a community at a common location in the city. Plenty of priestsand civic officials must have been present to receive offerings on behalf ofthe god, as well as to direct traffic.Local farmers brought their great pithoito the sanctuary individually, butit was as a civic community that the jars were opened. Wine was an essen-tial ingredient used in prayers directed to all the gods of the Olympian pan-theon; when a worshipper invoked any god or goddess, he or she poured asmall stream of wine onto the ground— the spondeor libation— to accom-pany the words addressed to the deity. Wine was equally important to the whole community since wine, diluted to greater or lesser degrees with wa-ter, was the principal beverage in the daily diet of every Athenian, regard-less of age, gender, or civic status. All those who had a place in the polis,hu-man and divine alike, had a stake in the new wine being presented to thegod and officially recognized by the ritual institutions of the polis.Once the pithoiof wine were opened on the first day and civic priests hadreceived Dionysus’s share, the civic community could then get on with thesocial activity of consuming wine together. This was one of the main activ-ities of the Anthesteria’s second day called the Choes— the day of jugs. Achous,the singular of the plural choes,generally held about three- quarters ofa gallon of liquid. On the Choes new wine was poured from the large pithoistorage jars into these more manageable ceramic serving pieces. Thousandsof choesof various sizes have been excavated in Athens over the years, anddionysus174"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"we know from later sources that a special ceramic market was held inAthens in preparation for this festival.

A variety of domestic and mythical scenes decoratedthe jugs, and one of the more charming characteristics of these choesis thatsomewhere on the vessel the artist often depicted a chous— either in thehands of a worshipper or in the background of the scene.On either the first or second day of the festival, Athenians also cele-brated Dionysus by or ga niz ing a great pro cession through the city thatcommemorated the god’s initial arrival in Athens in the distant past. Im-ages of this pompeare preserved on a number of vases; in these strikingscenes the god is shown coming into the city on a wagon fashioned to looklike a ship. Dionysus was always depicted in Athenian art and literature asbeing from somewhere else— from Thebes, or Thrace, or even Lydia; hewas a foreigner, and a potentially disruptive one, too. At the Athenian An-thesteria, Dionysus entered the city after a journey over the sea. SinceDionysus was never imagined as being a native of Attica, it was the job ofthe Athenians to welcome him into their civic community. While Diony-sus was always identified as a foreigner in Athenian myth and cult, carefulscholarship in the twentieth century showed that the deity Dionysus didoriginally arise in Greece in the second millennium bce. Some scholarshave therefore concluded that the energy of Dionysus was so potent thatGreeks and Athenians hesitated to claim him as one of their own. It waspsychologically more comfortable for residents to consider him an alienand allow him a place in the polisonly when everyone had gathered to-gether as a larger community to welcome him.The community at large observed the Choes by gathering both as a civicgroup in the Agora and afterward in individual homes. In public and pri-vate celebrations alike, the customs of wine drinking were turned on theirhead. Normally citizen men drank together among their peers at a mealcalled a symposium in a citizen’s home, or they shared a meal in the Tho-los, the Prytaneion, or one of the other common dining rooms found inthe Agora. Formal dining in this culture did not involve chairs set arounda common table; rather, sofas were lined up along the walls of a diningroom, with small trays of food set before each diner. Reclining on couchesin a dining room, citizens were typically served from a common mixingbowl of wine (krater) supplied by the host. The host was also responsiblefor diluting the wine with water in what ever proportion he thought best.At smaller domestic symposia and in the larger public dining facilities,wine, theater, and transformation175"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"male citizens segregated themselves from women and slaves, drinkingtheir wine among po liti cal peers while enjoying lively conversation and argument.Contrary to the normal customs, at the Choes Athenians watched a tra-ditional drinking ritual in which prominent public figures competedagainst each other. A trumpet call signaled the start of this unusual raceand the priest of Dionysus oversaw that the proper nomoi were followed.Each person participating in the drinking contest brought his own wine al-ready mixed in his chousas well as his own wine cup; he sat upright at hisown table, and drank the new wine in complete and solemn silence. Thefirst person to finish his jug of wine was declared the winner, and sourceslist a variety of items as prizes: perhaps a goatskin full of wine, or a cakespecially baked for the occasion. Similar drinking rituals were probablycelebrated elsewhere in Athens and in the outlying village districts.On the second day of the Anthesteria the typical Dionysian shift in nor-mal behaviors played a part not only in the heart of the polisbut also athome in the oikos,or individual house hold. This domestic side to the fes-tival of the Anthesteria is noteworthy since most civic cults were not cele-brated in the home. But on the day of Choes the festival used house holdrituals to reposition the power of male citizens: worshipping Dionysusmeant new roles for slaves as well as children in the oikos.The inclusion ofslaves in domestic festivities again inverted normal customs for drinkingand dining. This day was one of the few in the Athenian calendar whenslaves were allowed to drink and dine alongside their masters— the otherpossible occasion was at the Rural Dionysia later in the winter. Normallydomestic slaves labored to complete the countless menial tasks required torun a house hold, such as cooking meals and serving citizen men in thedining room, but on this day slaves could enjoy the license that the wor-ship of Dionysus offered and become the social and ritual equals of theirmasters. Dionysus the god of transformation functioned as a social leveler.The inclusion of children in the Choes marked not so much an inver-sion of social roles as a shift in boundaries that marked a social transition.Physical evidence fills in what is missing from the literary and historicalrecord. While archaeological excavations in Athens have unearthed thou-sands of full- sized choes,hundreds of miniature choeshave also beenfound. These smaller versions of the wine jug belonged to the children ofAthenian citizens— boys mostly but girls too sometimes, judging from theimages of children painted on the vessels. The toy jugs apparently markeda social coming- of- age for small children who had made the transition outdionysus176"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"wine, theater, and transformation177of infancy and dependence on milk and into the larger community ofAthenians who drank wine. To celebrate the occasion family membersgave children miniature jugs— a smaller- scale toy replica of the three- quarter- gallon jug that their parents used. What may be most curiousfrom our point of view is the age of the children in this rite of passage thatled the child into the company of wine drinkers in Athens: the children onthe miniature jugs are barely more than toddlers, and certainly no olderthan 4 or 5. The little choesjugs depict children at play, amusing them-selves with dice, tops, and hoops. As they did on adult- sized jugs, artistspainted in the scene’s background an image of the small chousthat was apart of every Athenian child’s life, as can be seen in figure 11.One Athenian inscription listed the celebration of the Choes alongsidebirth, the Ephebia (an adolescent coming- of- age celebration), and mar-riage. These four important rituals marked the development of an Athe-nian citizen as he reached full adulthood and assumed a po liti cal identityamong his peers. Burial customs also underscored the ritual importance ofthe Choes for Athenians: some toy jugs have been found in the graves ofsmall children. Archaeologists speculate that choes were buried in thegraves of infants who died before they could reach their first celebration ofthe Anthesteria, much as older Athenian girls who died before marriage were buried with loutrophoroi,the par tic u lar water vessel that was part of abride’s preparation for marriage. Burial customs in both cases ensured thatthose who died before their time could still enjoy the rituals, and the ritualvessels, in the afterlife.According to the Greek custom of reckoning time from sunset one dayto sunset the next, the final day of the festival called Chytroi began on theeve ning of the Choes with an unusual ritual celebrated in the Agora. Thetraditional custom on this final night of the Anthesteria cemented the wel-coming of Dionysus into the city with the public celebration of a sacredmarriage, or hieros gamos.The Athenian basilinna,the wife of the archfnbasileus,took center stage on this eve ning as she symbolically wedded thegod in a temple located near the public dining rooms of the Prytaneion inthe Agora. While the mythological tradition recounted other sacred mar-riages among the Olympian gods, above all that of Zeus and Hera, andwhile the union of Hades and Kore was perhaps acknowledged at theEleusinian Mysteries, this ritual at the Anthesteria is the only instance weknow of in which a mortal was symbolically united with a god in Athens.How it was done remains uncertain: did the basilinnago to a place sacredto Dionysus to couple with her husband, or with a priest of Dionysus?"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"dionysus178Did her husband the archfn basileusactually become a priest of Dionysusfor this one eve ning?

Athenians sought contact with the long- ago inhabitants of Attica byinviting them to a public meal on this day, Chytroi. It was named for thetype of simple vessel that was used either for cooking or for storing waterin the kitchen— water that could be mixed with the wine of Dionysus.Families at home cooked a dish of mixed seeds and grains and dedicated itto Hermes Chthonios, the manifestation of Hermes that tied him to theearth (chthonos) and to the departed souls that he accompanied below theearth. Dionysus thus shared the Anthesteria with another Olympian god:Hermes, the god in constant contact with both the upper and lower worlds.Honoring Hermes on this day brought the departed dead a bit closer andallowed Dionysus to oversee yet another kind of transformation. At thesame time, however, the Athenians didn’t want ghosts too near. They can-celed any official business that would require them to swear oaths, andthey closed off all civic sanctuaries and temples so that no spirits wouldpollute the public holy spaces. At home, Athenian house holders also markedtheir doors with an apotropaic sign, and started the day by chewing on aspecial leaf that protected them from the dead.The transformative power of Dionysus linked the city back to the vine-yard and civilized all the residents of Athens regardless of where theylived. Citizens drank with slaves and children, and a mortal queen marriedthe god. The dead momentarily crossed the boundary that normally sepa-rated them from the living. The ancient rites of the Anthesteria broughtthe entire community together, and everybody celebrated the god of thevineyard who was also the quintessential god in the city.oschophoria and pyanopsia: dionysus, theseus, and apolloDionysus may have started out as a vegetation deity who nourished thegrapevines of Hellas and Attica, but in Athens the god also came to signalthe transformative power of po liti cal unification. Much as Athenians cele-brated the Anthesteria wine festival in the spring, in the fall of the yearwhen the grapes were being harvested in the countryside Athenians hon-ored the god of the vine at an urban festival called the Oschophoria. Fschoiare clusters of grapes, and at the Oschophoria youths brought a tokensample of the grape harvest and presented it to the god of the vine.

Visual evidence fromvases and sculptural friezes suggests that grapes were brought while still onthe vines— young men carried branches heavy with the fruit, led a merryparade throughout the city, and dedicated the branches at one of Diony-sus’s temples.Dionysus shared the harvest season with his divine half- brother Apollo,who was worshipped with similar rituals at his own festival called thePyanopsia. Inscriptional sources are not completely clear as to whether thefestivals were held the very same or nearly the same day. Either way, the Athe-nians honored Dionysus and Apollo more or less simultaneously not be-cause they were culturally opposed to each other but because the two godsshared important functions in polytheistic Greece. Tradition held that thesesons of Zeus had more in common than the same father: they also sharedthe sanctuary at Delphi. Although it is often forgotten today, the famousoracle in the mountains of Phocis was sacred to Dionysus as well as Apollo.One account attests that the omphaloswas the tomb of Dionysus, a refer-ence to the mythical death and rebirth of the vegetation god. For fourmonths every year, starting in the late fall, Dionysus had jurisdiction overthe seat of prophecy at Delphi. Apollo returned in the spring, and exercisedauthority until the following autumn.As the annual transition from Apollo to Dionysus was being made atDelphi, the Athenians celebrated the Pyanopsia and the Oschophoria nearthe beginning of Pyanopsion, a month named after the Apollo festival.Those leading the pro cession at the Pyanopsia appear in Athenian art to beboys just barely entering adolescence. Pyanopsia itself means “bean boil-ing,” a reference to a stew that was prepared and eaten on this day. Thestew was composed of a variety of available produce, beans, and grains— but no meat. Because the Pyanopsia was another of a handful of festivalscelebrated by poleisthat claimed Ionian ancestry, scholars suspect that it isamong the more ancient of Athenian festivals, reaching back to at least theninth century and the Ionian migrations from the mainland into theAegean Sea. In perhaps the sixth century, Athenian rituals of the Pyanop-sia became linked with the island of Delos and stories about the Athenianhero Theseus. Traditional oral accounts held that when Theseus landed atDelos after slaying the Minotaur on Crete, he made a vow to Apollo thathe would dedicate a special offering to the god if he arrived home toAthens safely. When he finally landed on the shores of Attica, Theseus andhis companions took what was left over from their provisions on the ship,dionysus180"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"concocted a stew of beans, grains, and vegetables, and dedicated it to Apollobefore sharing it among themselves. These ritual connections betweenAthens and Delos took on an added dimension following the Persian Warswhen Delos served as the seat of the Delian League.As chapter 2 showed, the po liti cal community typically defined itselfthrough the rituals of thysiaand the distribution of meat among citizens. Eventhough ancestral nomoiprecluded rites of civic sacrifice at the Pyanopsia,other traditions associated with the festival still point to the Athenian po liti -cal community and its mythical origins in the heroic past. The tale recount-ing how Theseus dedicated his leftover food to Apollo may reflect the risingpopularity of the Theseus cycle of myths that emerged in Athens during thelast quarter of the sixth and early fifth centuries. Modern studies of changingiconography in Attic vase painting have shown that interest in Theseus sud-denly intensified during the rule of the Pisistratids and Cleisthenes. The herohad long been credited with many feats: myths famously related Theseus’sdefeat of the monstrous Minotaur in the labyrinth of Minos on Crete. Butequally impressive to Athenians in the early fifth century were accounts ofhow Theseus was the first Athenian leader to unite all of Attica into a singlepo liti cal community— what the Athenians referred to as the “synoecism” ofAttica. A second surge of interest in Theseus occurred shortly after the Per-sian Wars, when the Athenian leader Cimon, following the instructions of anoracle, reportedly brought home to Athens the bones of Theseus and placedthem in a new shrine. It seems likely that during these de cades under Cleis-thenes and Cimon traditional stories about Theseus’s adventures wereadapted and attached to older Ionian festivals in the Attic calendar, includingthis festival for Apollo. Unified Athens gained power and prestige during thelate sixth and early fifth centuries, and Theseus became an iconic figure whosymbolized its new prominence. At traditional annual celebrations, Atheni-ans continued to observe a common and ancient Ionian festival while they si-multaneously called attention to a native heroic figure who long ago solidifiedtheir own larger po liti cal community in Attica.Another important feature of the Pyanopsia was the bearing of a sacredolive bough, the eiresifne,to Apollo. Wool was woven through the branchesand food items— figs, other fruits, breads, and pastries— were tied on. Theboys carried the decorated branches throughout the city and sang songs,stopping at houses every so often to beg for gifts. The boughs, symbols offruitfulness and abundance, were seen as a blessing, and Athenians hungthem above the doors to their homes. When the pro cession ended the youthspresented at least one eiresifnein the temple of Apollo. Literary sources,wine, theater, and transformation181"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"especially comedy, record that the festive activities of the youths at thePyanopsia held a special appeal for the residents of fifth- century Athens.Although Apollo is not often considered a deity overly concerned withthe fertility of the land, practices on this festival day clearly suggest that inAttica he came to have associations with the agricultural rhythms of theyear. The beans and grains that made up Theseus’s stew were the very sameproducts that would soon be sown as winter crops. At the Pyanopsia Athe-nians looked both forward and backward as they worshipped Apollo:looking back at the abundance of the current harvest symbolized with thevegetables and the eiresifne,and looking forward toward the fertility of thecrops to be sown— the grains in the Pyanopsion stew. By dedicating portions of produce, beans, and grains to Apollo, they affirmed their con-tinuing relationship with a god who had once helped the young hero cred-ited in myth with the unification of Attica and foundation of their poliscommunity.Similar energies also motivated the Oschophoria, the Dionysian festivalthat took place at about the same time in Athens. Two ephebes headed theOschophoria celebrations and, just like the younger boys at Apollo’sPyanopsia, carried branches. The young fschophoroicame from a groupcalled the Salaminioi, an ancient Athenian family that traced their com-mon descent through the male line and fulfilled specific ritual obligations.The two young men leading the pro cession through the streets of Athens were followed by a chorus of youths, singing traditional songs to Dionysusthat were said to blend together both joy and sadness. A group of youngwomen were included in the party. The pro cession started in the heart ofthe city at a sanctuary of Dionysus and then went south, stopping some dis-tance outside the city in the sanctuary of Athena Skiras in the deme ofPhaleron. Within this precinct of Athena stood a smaller shrine for Diony-sus, the Oschophorion, where the remainder of the festival was held.While some earlier scholars classified the Oschophoria as a festival pri-marily honoring the goddess Athena and not Dionysus, a closer analysis ofthe Oschophoria reveals significant Dionysian elements. Named after thefschophoroi,the aristocratic young men who led the pro cession and carriedthe fschoito the shrine in Phaleron, the Oschophoria celebrated wine andfertility at multiple levels. Fschoiwas an uncommon word, but it probablyreferred to bunches of grapes as they hung on the vine. The pro cessionwith the branches of fschoimirrored the pro cession with the eiresifneatApollo’s Pyanopsia: in both cases young males carried branches laden withfruit and produce— branches with grapes for Dionysus, branches withdionysus182"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"other fruits for Apollo. These boys and youths, who represented the futureof the community, dedicated the branches as an aparcheand thank offer-ings to the gods at precisely the time of year when the annual produce wasbeing harvested. Visual evidence for the Oschophoria from vases andfriezes supports this understanding. We see depictions of young men along-side Dionysus carry ing the branches with bunches of round, ripe grapeshanging from them.Dionysus was a god who encouraged his worshippers to take on a newidentity, and Dionysian role reversal was celebrated at the Oschophoria inways not evident at Apollo’s Pyanopsia. The ephebes bringing the fschoitoDionysus did not lead the pro cession dressed as youths; rather their publicappearance deliberately mimicked that of adolescent Athenian girls. TheOschophoria ritual called for the two chosen ephebes to be transvestites. Cross- dressed in what appears to be an Ionic chiton, an obsolete fashionfor men in the fifth century though still sometimes worn by women, thetwo ephebes approached Dionysus with the grapes that would create anew vintage of wine. They came to Dionysus as boyish young women— oras girlish young men. Such striking androgyny and gender reversal were ahallmark of Dionysian worship.The leadership of the two fschophoroirecalled the myth of Theseus andthe synoecism of Attica. Ancient sources explain the ritual transvestismat the Oschophoria through the same myth of Theseus celebrated at thePyanopsia. When Theseus was sent to Crete to battle the Minotaur in thelabyrinth of Minos, he was one member of a cohort of fourteen young Athenians— seven ephebes and seven maidens. But one version of the mythincluded a curious detail: Theseus substituted two fresh- faced youths fortwo of the maidens. He dressed them in women’s clothing, and hoped thatthe advantage of two additional young men would help him overcome theMinotaur. In the end, victory over the monster was accomplished notthrough physical might but through cunning and the power of erotic lovefelt by the Cretan princess Ariadne for Theseus. Still, the Athenians pre-served the memory of Theseus’s ruse by annually choosing two ephebesfrom an ancient family and reenacting this particularly Dionysian aspect ofhis adventure.Other worshippers of Dionysus took on new social roles at the Oschopho-ria: in addition to these two symbolic maidens who led the pro cession carry -ing grape vines to Phaleron, a group of real females, adolescent daughtersof noblemen, pro cessed behind the cross- dressed fschophoroiand chorusof youths. These women carried food for them all. An oral traditionwine, theater, and transformation183"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"maintained that they represented the Athenian maidens who accompa-nied Theseus to Crete. These deipnophoroi,or “supper carriers,” were notsimply female servants waiting on the young men and priests of Dionysus;they became the ritual equals of the ephebes. Once the maidens with thedinner, the chorus, and the ephebes carry ing the vines arrived in Phaleron,sacrifices were made at the altar of Dionysus. On this occasion the youngwomen shared in the feast as social equals alongside the young men— contrary to the normal customs of thysiaand segregated ritual dining. Inthis moment of ritual inversion, the maidens and the ephebes drew atten-tion to Dionysus’s ability to promote fertility and transformation in thecommunity. The young people, all on the verge of adulthood, clearly heldthe promise of future generations of citizens, and at the same time theypaid honor to the heroic deeds of Theseus and his companions— deeds theAthenians believed had culminated in the unification of Attica. Followingthe festival meal the young men continued to commemorate the adven-tures of Theseus by competing in athletic events: ephebes competed inhotly contested footraces or ga nized by tribe. In this ritual play, young menon the verge of adulthood prepared for the competitive field of Athenianpolitics they would soon be entering.But the Oschophoria’s embrace of fruit, fertility, and the future extendedbeyond the feast and the games. Perhaps the most curious and cryptic ofdetails about this festival has to do with its name. Ancient literary sourcesare inconsistent in their spelling of fschoiand Oschophoria. The ancientGreek alphabet contained two different repre sen ta tions of the vowel “o”:a short o, omicron, and a long f, omega. Spelled with omega, fschoimean“bunches of grapes,” and the Oschophoria was the festival when ephebesbrought harvested grapes to the sanctuary in Phaleron and dedicated themto the god. But spelled with an initial omicron, Oschophoria refers to car-ry ing not a bunch of grapes but scrota, from osche,a term found in ancientmedical texts.The visual likeness between a cluster of ripe grapes and the male testesis clear. Even if scholarship has not yet confirmed that Greeks themselvesmade a direct and conscious link between the grapes the youths carriedand a word for the male genitals, at the very least a Greek pun is at work here. The difference between the two spoken words is a fraction of a sec-ond. In the celebration of a festival, with the music, noise, and or ga nizedchaos that accompanies a pro cession, how could you be sure whether the“o” you were hearing was long or short? Possibly both meanings registered,the grapes sacred to the god (long f) and the latent fertility of ephebes ondionysus184"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the cusp of becoming adult citizen men (short o). Each form could easilysymbolize the other.In the end, the Oschophoria was a wild and joyous Dionysian festival,and a pop u lar one too. Young men dressed as girls carried branches bear-ing symbols of male fertility while other youths sang seasonal folk songs,with young women accompanying them and in the end sharing in thegod’s feast as equals. In ritual all celebrated and enacted the traditionalnarratives of civic identity. While some normal social customs were ignored(women normally ate separately from men), other roles were inverted(men disguised themselves as women). New grapes were grapes, the gift ofthe god to humans, and at the same time they were the symbols of humanfecundity. In both senses the grapes indicated the abundance of life, and itwas this abundance that was celebrated publicly in the late autumn inhonor of the god Dionysus.The rituals of the Pyanopsia and Oschophoria reveal deep connectionsbetween the gods Apollo and Dionysus. Recent scholarship is coming to seethe god Apollo in new ways: not only was he the god of rationality, prophecy,and healing, he was also a deity who protected the civic community in theassembly and watched over young men as they made the transition fromchildhood and adolescence to full citizen adulthood. Likewise the worship ofDionysus honored the life force of the grapevine in the rural vineyards, andalso the vibrant social energy that wine brought to civic gatherings. Both fes-tivals worked to bring citizens together in harmony, and the civic communityneeded both gods. Some scholars see traces of ancient male initiation rites inthe two fall festivals of Dionysus and Apollo. Boys and ephebes graduallymade the transition to adult citizenship in the context of the larger body ofcitizens. When the Oschophoria festival culminated in athletic contests atPhaleron, the young men who competed in their tribes honored a deity and ahero whose shared concern for the po liti cal future of the community spannedthe boundary of the generations.As Dionysus shared the harvest season with Apollo, so too he shared itwith Athena and to a certain extent even with Demeter, goddess of grain;the sanctuary of Athena Skiras in Phaleron where the Oschophoria was cel-ebrated was also the site for the celebration of Demeter’s Skira in June. Lifein an urban community relied on the rural areas where crops were har-vested and new wine pressed; but equally important for the poliswas the so-cialization of young people of both sexes. The civic rites of autumn thathonored multiple gods and included boys, maidens, and ephebes linked thesocial world of the poliswith the natural world that supported life in thewine, theater, and transformation185"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"polis.Attaching traditional tales of Theseus to older Ionian festivals ofDionysus and Apollo allowed the residents of Athena’s city to commemo-rate the synoecism of Attica at the same time that they reaffirmed their so-cial and military ties to allied Ionian poleisin the Delian League. When theAthenians created a naval empire following the Persian Wars, they reliedmore than ever on the idea of shared Ionian interests and customs. In thesetwo festivals we can see how polytheism in classical Athens was no simplematter; the functions of different gods complemented each other to main-tain stability and continuity in the polis.Civic festivals implicitly acknowl-edged the interdependence of the Olympian gods in their support of hu-man communal activity. Po liti cal life in the city relied on the structures andstories of ancestral polytheistic practice, and over time civic rites reflectedchanges in the polisitself.While rooted in the ancient rhythms of viticulture and winemaking, theautumn Oschophoria and the Anthesteria in the spring also served the needsof residents in the urban center of Athens. Like all Dionysian celebrations,these two civic festivals allowed worshippers to break free from some of thenormal social barriers that kept citizens and residents highly stratified andsegregated within the polis:on these days women, slaves, and children couldjoin with male citizens in the worship of the god of wine. Dionysus alsowas a god who helped young men find their po liti cal identity in the com-munity of adult citizens. The civic rites of this god were both ancient andinnovative, responding to the needs of the poliscommunity as they changed.This same ability to adapt will play a role in the other Dionysian festivals inAthens, the dramatic festivals.dionysus and the dramatic festivalsOnce the grape harvest was celebrated in the fall, grapes pressed, and thenew wine sealed in storage jars, the Athenian ritual calendar focused onentertainment, relaxation, and creative expression found in the worshipof Dionysus. Dionysus was the god of theater, and theater had deeplyreligious roots. Athenians worshipped Dionysus with theatrical per for -mances three times a year: the Rural Dionysia and the Lenaea were cele-brated during the dead of winter, and the season of dramatic festivalsculminated with the City Dionysia in the spring. The three festivals were evenly spaced over four consecutive months, and at all three festi-vals worshippers directly experienced Dionysian transformation throughthe rituals of dramatic production. Like Athena’s Panathenaea in thedionysus186"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"summer, these festivals and sacrifices for Dionysus were publicly fi-nanced and or ga nized. The same Athenians who celebrated solemn civicrites for a virginal goddess of victory under the summer sun then en-gaged in public drinking and voiced ritual obscenities at official, state- financed religious holidays.The dramatic rituals that honored Dionysus went beyond simple role- playing to enable worshippers to examine themselves and their commu-nity. Fifth- century theater could directly comment on what it meant tobe a citizen of a democracy at war. Under Pericles the annual dramaticfestivals of Dionysus became religious occasions that celebrated the Athe-nian empire itself. At the same time the worship of Dionysus celebratedpo liti cal dissent, and allowed for critiques of po liti cal leaders. The dra-matic festivals of the Athenians underwent a rich and complex develop-ment in the de cades following the Persian Wars. The discussion that followspresents an overview of these three Dionysian holidays, analyzing themas though they were static and unchanging. This is far from the truth:the po liti cal realities of the Athenian empire, the ongoing war with Sparta,and factional fighting among Athenians themselves all had an impact onhow citizens, residents, and visitors in Attica encountered the god of thevine and theater in the polis.The worship of Dionysus changed as Athensitself changed.Rural DionysiaThe Rural Dionysia comprised numerous local festivals throughout Atticaheld over the course of many days in the midwinter month of Posideon, ap-proximately December. These festivals did not focus on the seat of powerand urban life in Athens, but rather reflected the deep agricultural roots ofthe polisin the rural districts of Attica. In demes and villages townspeoplecelebrated Dionysus with pro cessions, old- fashioned fun and games, anddeeply traditional symbols. At its most minimal, the Rural Dionysia fea-tured a pro cession and ribald, abusive (but nevertheless ancestral) songs.The central symbol of the god in the festive pompewas an oversize phallusmade of wood and leather. On Attic vases that depict the pro cession, youngmen are dwarfed by the phallus pole they support together on their shoul-ders. The pro cession ended with sacrifice and a communal feast. After thepompeand sacrificial feast, men played traditional games and sang the cus-tomary phallic songs of humor and abuse. Scholiasts and late antique com-mentators who discussed the games played at the Rural Dionysia made spe-cial mention of jumping and balancing games— hopping up and down onwine, theater, and transformation187"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"one leg, and trying to stay balanced atop a greased goatskin that was filledwith wine. Doubtless the goatskin of wine did not stay full for long.A comic version of the pro cession and song is preserved in the Achar-nians,a play written by the Athenian comic poet Aristophanes in 425. Inthis comedy the hero’s daughter serving as basket bearer, or kanephoros,led the pompe;the slave who pro cessed behind her carried the phallus ona pole, while the hero Dicaeopolis sang a song of abuse that harshly crit-icized the current politicians in the city (Acharnians 241–83). Scholars arenot sure what to conclude from Dicaeopolis’s inclusion of his slave Xan-thias in this comic depiction of the Rural Dionysia. Does the presenceof the slave reflect the idiosyncratic nature of Dicaeopolis’s private cele-bration, or were slaves included at home on this occasion as they were atthe Anthesteria? Is it a comic touch, or is this another Dionysian festivalthat overturned normal social boundaries? We need more evidence.Plutarch’s first- century description of a traditional Dionysian festival in-cluded the vine and a jar of wine in the pro cession alongside the goatand the phallus, and he noted that this was a day when slaves and mas-ters dined together— but this later evidence cannot confirm what hap-pened in classical Athens (Plutarch Moralia527d).There is evidence for traditions of rudimentary dramatic per for mancesat some, but probably not all, celebrations of the Rural Dionysia in Attica.Inscriptional rec ords of fifth- century decrees detail the rites, sacrifices,and proceedings at local festivals, and sometimes these details include dra-matic productions. In at least three outlying rural demes, archaeologistshave unearthed remains of small stone theaters that can be dated to theclassical period. Such theaters may have been built for the Rural Dionysia;the oblong theater in Thoricus is the best preserved of these. Literary evi-dence also provides insight into the festivals and theaters outside the cen-ter of Athens. When Thucydides narrated the struggle in 411 between theoligarchs and the demo crats, he noted in passing how the demo cratic ho-plites laid down their arms before entering the theater of Dionysus in thePiraeus. They used the large sacred precinct as a meeting place to discusstheir response to the Four Hundred back in Athens (Thucydides 8.93).While the hoplites’ meeting had little to do with the worship of Dionysus,it does demonstrate that the physical space occupied by Dionysus in thepolisfacilitated civic life in Athens.Since the Rural Dionysia were celebrated on a rolling basis throughoutthe demes of Attica, it seems reasonable to speculate that traveling compa-nies of actors made the rounds during this month of local festivals, alongdionysus188"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"with citizens who took special plea sure in watching drama. An anecdotefrom Plato’s Republicprovides us with perhaps the clearest picture of howAthenians celebrated the Rural Dionysia in the late fifth century. The dia-logue describes how men “eager to see new things” traveled from village tovillage at this time of year to attend as many Dionysian festivals as theycould (Plato Republic5.475d). Given that work obligations were not terri-bly demanding during the winter months, it is easy to imagine men takinga break and crisscrossing the countryside of Attica for a few weeks. Ob-serving this festival entailed visiting relatives and friends and sharing infree meals among the demes, all the while imbibing wine in the worship ofthe god. The social nature of the Rural Dionysia promoted communica-tion between Athens and the rural districts of Attica, thereby helping tomaintain a common civic identity. Worshipping Dionysus meant partici-pating in the shared activities of the entire polis.The LenaeaThe festival of Dionysus known as the Lenaea was also celebrated in thedead of winter, but in the month called Gamelion, roughly January. Themonth of Gamelion honored marriage (gamos), above all the divine unionof Hera and Zeus, which was celebrated at a festival called the Gamelia.Marriage in the human community was also the focus of ritual attentionat this time of year: in ancient Athens, Gamelion was the most pop u larmonth for weddings.Like the Anthesteria and the Pyanopsia, the Lenaea was one of the festi-vals common to all Ionian poleis;in most other Ionian calendars this mid-winter month was actually called not Gamelion but Lenaion, after theDionysian festival. On the 12th of Gamelion, in Athens the Lenaea wascelebrated at an urban sanctuary called the Lenaion, probably located some-where near the Agora. The archfn basileusheaded a pro cession that endedin the Lenaion, and high officials from the civic cult of Eleusinian Deme-ter also took leading roles in the pompeand the sacrifices. Later in the fifthcentury the pro cession included wagons and carts; as participants rodepast onlookers they were said to have shouted the sort of abusive jokes andinsults that were pop u lar at the Rural Dionysia. The pro cession endedwith sacrifices for Dionysus and a great civic feast.Current scholarly consensus concerning the name of the festival connectsthe Lenaea with lenai,another term for maenads, the women who tradition-ally worshipped Dionysus with ecstatic rites in the mountains of Thebes.Some Athenian women traveled to take part in these biennial rites; perhapswine, theater, and transformation189"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"citizen women danced for Dionysus in Athens, but no evidence for suchdances remains. It is in fact a challenge for scholars to connect this ecstaticform of Dionysian worship with the other civic rite we have evidence forat the Lenaea— the dramatic per for mances. Starting perhaps in the 440sduring the height of Pericles’ influence, dramatic competitions were in-cluded in this midwinter festival. Polisofficials or ga nized and managed thecompetitions. Most of the plays produced at the Lenaea seem to have beencomedies; in fact many of Aristophanes’ extant comedies were producedfor the Lenaea. Some tragedies were produced as well, though it appears tohave been a less prestigious forum for that type of drama.With few foreigners able to travel the Aegean during stormy wintermonths, audiences for plays produced at the Lenaea were composedlargely of resident Athenians. This meant that comic poets like Aristo-phanes could write topical insider jokes that abused Athenian public fig-ures and criticized Athenian policy, much the same way that late- night co-medians and spoofs of newscasts comment on the American po liti cal scenetoday. The ridicule of fellow citizens, especially men holding positions ofauthority, reversed the normal social order. Aristophanes’ relentless abuseof Cleon in the Knights,which won first prize at the Lenaea in 424, typi-fies the reversal, with its portrayals of slaves and common workers who re-place those in positions of po liti cal power. Its invective was similar to theritual abuse evident in the traditional songs sung at the Rural Dionysia,and in the jokes from the wagons in the Lenaea pro cession. When Atheni-ans wrote and staged comedies for the Lenaea they exercised the sameDionysian spirit of abusive ridicule, parody, exaggeration, and criticism.At times the criticism must have been harsh: an Athenian decree passed in440 tried to limit the abusive speech and ridicule common in comediesproduced at any dramatic festival, but the decree apparently proved un-pop u lar and was repealed three years later (Fornara 111).Plato gives us an interesting window into the worship of Dionysus atthe Lenaea in his famous dialogue called the Symposium.Plato probablywrote the dialogue in the 380s, well after the execution of Socrates, but thedramatic date for the Symposiumis set very specifically during the Lenaeaof 416 bce, just a few months before the mutilation of the herms and des-ecration of the Mysteries discussed in chapter 5. In fact some of the menpresent at the drinking party depicted in this dialogue would be impli-cated in one or both of these affairs during the trials that gripped Atheni-ans in the following summer and fall. Alcibiades plays a central role in thesecond half of the dialogue.dionysus190"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The occasion for this semi- fictional dinner and drinking party in 416 wasthe very first victory at a civic competition for the tragic poet Agathon (Sym-posium173a). Although Agathon’s plays exist today only in fragments, in an-tiquity he was ranked among the top tier of Athenian tragic poets— right be-hind the canonical Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In the SymposiumPlato pointedly reminds the reader of Agathon’s youth— he was competingfor the first time in a festival that had lower stakes than the City Dionysia.This symposium was the celebratory dinner party hosted by the victoriousAgathon on the eve ning following the Lenaea; he gathered with a few closefriends in his home in Athens, where they drank together and exchangedspeeches in honor of Eros, the god of Love. The afternoon of public sacri-fice was over; the meat had been distributed to deme members, the playscompleted. Now Plato reveals how Athenian citizens in a private home con-tinue their worship of Dionysus and gather around a big krater, or mixingbowl of wine. Groups of revelers come and go all night, Alcibiades arrivesdrunk and unannounced, and eventually most of the men fall asleep ontheir couches. When the sun rises the next morning over Agathon’s house inAthens, the dialogue reports that Socrates is one of only three men leftawake. He is still talking. He is not at all drunk; rather he, the tragic poetAgathon, and the comic poet Aristophanes are debating the merits of com-edy and tragedy. Socrates concludes that the true writer of tragedy is simul-taneously a writer of comedy (Symposium223c).The Lenaea offered citizens of Athens an opportunity to come togetherduring the quiet winter months and enjoy a civic feast followed by publiclyfunded entertainment. Tragedy and especially comedy supplied the framefor communal reflection, criticism of public officials, and the free exchangeof ideas. As Plato shows, the experience of Dionysus did not stop whenthe last play ended. Even during a time of war, a group of friends and po- liti cal equals gathered on a cold winter night to drink and enjoy eachother’s company at a symposium. When Alcibiades burst into Agathon’sparty that night in 416, he gave a vivid description of Socrates as a soldierfighting on behalf of the Athenian empire at Delion and Potidaea. TheLenaea, like many civic rites in Athens, encouraged citizens to take a hon-est look at themselves, even as the normal social order was inverted andthe wine flowed freely.The City DionysiaWinter was the season of Dionysus: the Oschophoria, the Rural Dionysia,and the Lenaea (October, December, and January) were followed by thewine, theater, and transformation191"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Anthesteria (late February). The five winter celebrations of the gods ofwine and theater culminated in the biggest Dionysus festival of all: theCity Dionysia, held in the following month of Elaphebolion— roughlyMarch, as winter ended and spring began. The festival of the Elapheboliagave its name to this month of Elaphebolion, but by Pericles’ time the sac-rifices at the Elaphebolia in honor of Artemis slayer- of- the- deer (elaphebo-los) had become somewhat obscure. The City Dionysia started a few daysafter the Artemis festival, and then ran for nearly a week. This festival ofDionysus completely dominated the month. During the fifth century theCity Dionysia was celebrated on a grand civic scale in the center of Athens;it emerged as one of most important Athenian festivals of the entire year,second only to the Panathenaea in midsummer. Like that festival ofAthena, the civic rites of the City Dionysia placed the polisof Athens itselffront and center in a festival of cultural pride and self- presentation. Spring-time marked the return of travel throughout the Aegean, and the city wasfull of visitors.The precise order of all the rites observed at the City Dionysia remainsuncertain, but scholars have put together a general picture. The festivalran for five or six days, at least three of which were given over to per for -mance and dramatic competition. The Athenians— like all Greeks— lovedto compete, especially against members of other tribes. As one Cleisthenictribe competed against another in athletics at civic festivals like the Pana-thenaea and the Oschophoria, so they competed by tribe at the City Dionysia— but at this festival, the competitions took place on the stage. Poetvied against poet, actor against actor, chorus against chorus, and produceragainst producer.Preparations for the competition were begun long before the actual per- for mances were staged, and these preparations depended on the men whotrained the choruses and produced the plays. Of all the varieties of lei-tourgiaor public ser vice that wealthy Athenians could fulfill for the polis,being a choregosor a producer of plays (literally, “leader of a chorus”)brought perhaps the most fame and glory. The annual City Dionysia of-fered abundant opportunities for wealthy citizens to display their largesseto their fellow citizens. Archons were responsible for recruiting choregoiduring the fifth century; it took almost thirty producers to put on the CityDionysia. Twenty of the appointments were made according to the tentribes created by Cleisthenes. Every tribe prepared two choruses for thefestival, one chorus of fifty men and one of fifty boys, and each chorusperformed a traditional cult song called a dithyramb. Every dithyrambicdionysus192"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"chorus had its own choregos,each of whom was charged with recruiting thechoral members from his tribe, training them, and providing them withany costumes required.The most prestigious dramatic offices were reserved for the wealthiestmen who put on the tragedies and comedies. Each choregoswas assigned apoet to work with; poets had been chosen earlier in the year after audi-tioning before the archons. Comic poets each wrote one play, while tragicpoets wrote four: three tragedies plus one play called a satyr play. Like thecitizens who produced the dithyrambs, the choregoirecruited, trained, andprovided costumes for their actors and choruses. Archons also designateda pool of citizen judges who would judge the dramatic per for mances at thefestival. To reduce the potential for bribery, hundreds of names wereplaced in jars ahead of time, and when the festival began only ten names were pulled out. These citizen judges performed their civic duty by watch-ing the plays and voting for the best poet and actor. A simple majority wasneeded to win. Civic officials kept careful accounts of the winners, or ga -niz ing them according to the name of the eponymous archon. Names ofthe victorious choregoi,tribes, poets, and actors were inscribed on stonetablets and placed in public; our earliest list of victors goes back to 473bce, but clearly the Athenians had been recording the winners’ nameslong before this.Once the choruses were trained, a public meeting prepared the Atheniansfor the coming competitions. A proagfnor preliminary ceremony was heldin Athens just before the opening day of the City Dionysia; at this meetingall the men involved— the producers, poets, actors, and chorus members— appeared out of costume and presented themselves as fellow citizens be-fore the Athenian public. A torchlight pro cession introduced the god intothe city. An ancient wooden image of Dionysus was brought in from thesuburban neighborhood called the Academy northwest of the city; this pre-liminary festivity commemorated the god’s initial arrival in Athens fromBoeotia. The pro cession ended at Dionysus’s sanctuary and temple justsouth of the Acropolis. The festival proper began the next day with an offi-cial pompethat was one of the most grand and colorful pro cessions of theAthenian year. Ephebes led bulls for thysia,while a pro cession of metics inbright red cloaks carried trays with nonbloody offerings. Citizens boreleather bottles of wine, great phalluses, and long sticks of bread slung overtheir shoulders, and an aristocratic young woman carried the basket with thesacrificial knife. The goal of the pompewas the civic altar in the sanctuary ofDionysus, where polisofficials sacrificed the bulls and hosted a great feast atwine, theater, and transformation193"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"public expense for all those attending. We don’t know how large the feastwas in Pericles’ or Socrates’ time, but one fourth- century inscription statesthat 240 bulls were sacrificed for the City Dionysia that year— enough meatto feed thousands of people. Wine flowed freely, and the eve ning followingthe pro cession was known for its torchlight revelry throughout the city, a rit-ual known as a kfmos.Whereas a pompewas a formal pro cession that endedwith thysiaat the altar, the kfmoswas a diffuse and informal party that spreaditself throughout the city.Dawn on the following morning saw the start of the dramatic competi-tions. For the next few days, residents returned to the south slope of theAcropolis and the sanctuary of Dionysus. Athenian citizens, metics, andforeigners all attended the per for mances. The presence of women at the dra-matic festivals is still debated among scholars; comments in Aristophanes’comedies imply that at least some women attended, especially women of theupper classes. In the fifth century there was no permanent stone theater forthe audience— the Athenian statesman Lycurgus built that structure a cen-tury later. Instead the city constructed temporary wooden benches calledikriaon the hillside overlooking Dionysus’s altar and the orchestra,a smoothflat surface around the altar where the actors and choruses performed. Thebest seats in the front rows were reserved for visiting dignitaries and highcivic officials; behind the benches on the hillside others lounged on theground. Audience members brought their own pillows, cushions, and rugs tomake themselves comfortable through the per for mances. Tragedies werestaged in the morning, and comedies in the afternoon. We are not sure whenthe dithyrambic choruses competed— perhaps interspersed between theother events. Theatergoers brought wine and snacks along with them as well,and spent the day drinking wine and munching on dried fruit, nuts, andother finger food. Athenians were said to be an active audience that ap-plauded when pleased, and hissed, hooted, or beat on their wooden seatswhen they saw or heard something they didn’t like. Tickets to the per for -mances cost about a day’s wage (2 obols); this price effectively excludedsome of the poorer working residents. In response, the Athenian ekklesia— probably in the early fourth century— instituted the theoric fund, which dis-bursed state money to citizens who otherwise could not afford to attend thefestival.The worship of Dionysus was widespread throughout all of Greece, andevidence for the earliest forms of drama is not unique to Attica. Early ex-amples of both comedy and tragedy have been found in communities inthe Peloponnese. Scholars and theorists have long discussed the origins ofdionysus194"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"drama, and research into the development of theater has occupied some ofthe very best scholars. Even Aristotle in the fourth century bcefound the-ater to be a compelling topic for his scientific investigations. His Poeticsre-mains one of our most important sources for the study of all ancient liter-ary forms, including tragedy and comedy. The current scholarly consensusfor the origins of theater follows Aristotle but also supplements the Poeticswith other evidence, including archaeological remains, inscriptions, vasepaintings, and literary evidence from other ancient authors.It is clear that drama emerged from ancient Dionysian rites that weresimilar to rituals celebrated at the rural Dionysia and the Lenaea, but cer-tainly older than those two festivals as the Athenians observed them in thefifth century. One feature of Dionysian worship called the revel, or kfmos,emerged from rural festivities that celebrated the gift of grapevine andwine. Early comedy is thought to be connected with this mode of wor-ship. But Dionysus also had strong associations with areas beyond the vil-lages found in cultivated areas: he was at home in the untamed wilderness,and he could at times inspire behaviors that were considered not fully civ-ilized. Rituals of parody, exaggeration, and verbal abuse were an integralpart of traditional Dionysian festivities, and some men who participatedin the ritual abuse dressed up as satyrs, mythical wild- man figures who were part human, part animal— either horse or goat. Satyrs were knownfor aggressive public behaviors, and for their unquenchable appetites forwine and sex; they arguably represented a type of ancient masculinity out-side the polis— or at least what Greeks thought mythical masculinitylooked like before the civilizing power of the polis.Still, the classical polismade room for these symbolic wild men in its civic rituals: men dressedas satyrs accompanied Dionysus in the ship- cart at the pro cession of theAthenian Anthesteria, and men dressed as satyrs entertained the public atDionysian festivals with traditional per fo r mances called satyr dramas. Ex-amples of early satyr dramas are lost (indeed they were probably neverrecorded), but some elements of these ancient plays were preserved inwhat was to become Greek tragedy and comedy.In addition to the satyr drama, the poetic form called the dithyrambplayed a significant role in the development of fifth- century drama. Thedithyramb was a form of cult song sacred to Dionysus with Dionysiancontent, and the earliest dithyrambs were probably composed even beforeGreek became a written language. It is thought that a group of citizensgathered in a sanctuary of Dionysus and sang a dithyramb celebrating thegod; perhaps one of them took on a leading role and sang a solo part, orwine, theater, and transformation195"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"even acted out the song in a rudimentary way with gestures and dancesteps accompanied by music. It was during the first part of the fifth cen-tury that what we today recognize as tragic drama emerged from dithyra-mbic cult poetry and took on its now familiar form. The singer with thesolo part soon became an actor who engaged in an ongoing conversationwith the chorus, while the chorus listened to the actor’s speeches and re-sponded to the actor’s emotions as the play’s tragic situation emerged.Around the time of the Persian Wars the tragic poet Aeschylus increasedthe number of actors from one to two, and not much later Sophocles in-creased it again from two to three. Sophocles also introduced the use ofscene painting to give the unfolding drama a more vivid sense of place.The role of the chorus slowly evolved, too, as plots became more complexand the per for mances of the actors became more dynamic.Euripides, the youn gest of the three canonical Greek tragedians, beganhis career as a tragic poet in the 450s, by which time the traditional satyrdrama and the dithyrambic chorus had fully evolved and combined to cre-ate Attic drama. As the program for dramas produced at the City Dionysiabecame more fixed, comic poets each contributed one play, while tragicpoets submitted a satyr play in addition to three tragedies. Civic officialsevidently started to require the satyr play once tragic plots and charactersmoved away from those found in the more traditional Dionysian ritualdramas. The fifth- century Athenians themselves observed that drama wasa ritual associated with publicly financed civic festivals such as the CityDionysia, the Lenaea, and the Rural Dionysia. But at the same time some,including Aristotle, held that drama “had nothing to do with Dionysus,” apossible reference to trends that were moving it further away from the rec-ognizable customs found in older forms of Dionysus worship.Scores of poets wrote hundreds of plays for the tragic festivals duringthe fifth century. Today we are left with only thirty- three complete tragediesby the three major tragedians: Aeschylus (seven), Sophocles (seven), andEuripides (nineteen). Of the comedies written at this time we possess onlyeleven complete plays by Aristophanes. All the plays by other poets havebeen lost over the ages or exist only in fragments and quotations in laterwriters. We do know the names of some poets (e.g., Agathon and Phryni-cus) as well as the titles of some plays. Tragic poets in Athens during thetime of Pericles and Socrates held a place of honor and respect. There iseven an ancient tradition reporting that the phi los o pher Plato began hiscareer as a young man wanting to be tragic poet; he shifted his attention todionysus196"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"writing philosophical dialogues only after his teacher and friend Socrateswas executed by the Athenian state.Early on poets wrote tragedies about current events as well as mytholog-ical tales and characters, but the historical plays sometimes hit too close tohome. In the 490s, during the thick of the Greeks’ conflict with Persia, thetragic poet Phrynicus wrote of the sack of Miletus, the Ionian city andAthenian ally that had instigated the Ionian Revolt in 499 and persuadedthe Greeks to come their aid against the Persian Empire. Miletus was be-sieged and destroyed by the advancing Persian army in 494, and Phryni-cus’s dramatization of the city’s tragic fall was staged at a Dionysian festi-val not long afterward. Herodotus reports that seeing the destructionportrayed on the stage so upset the Athenians that they levied a large fineon the poet for “reminding them of their troubles” (Herodotus 6.21). Po-ets continued to engage with contemporary subjects: Phrynicus wrote atleast one other play with a historical subject, and other poets followed him.We are fortunate to possess one complete tragedy that handles currentevents: the Persiansof Aeschylus, produced shortly after the end of thePersian Wars. Aeschylus set this play in Persia itself. The king Xerxescomes home to the capital of Susa after the naval defeat at Salamis in 480.The outcome of the battle is portrayed entirely from the Persian point ofview: there is not a single Greek— not even a general or naval officer— named in the tragedy. The choregosfor this daring portrayal of a defeatedenemy was the young aristocrat Pericles, who in 472 was just starting hiscareer in public ser vice to Athens.Sometime after this production of the Persians,Athenian poets made adeliberate move away from historical subject matter, focusing instead onmythical events from the heroic past. Characters such as Odysseus,Agamemnon, and Achilles from the Trojan War were certainly favorites,as were mythological personalities from neighboring Thebes— Oedipus,Antigone, Tiresias, and Pentheus. The conventions of myth- based tragicdrama enabled Athenians to peer inside the experience of peoples who hadlittle po liti cal power in the workings of a Greek polis.Foreigners, slaves,the very old and the young, and above all women were placed in criticalcircumstances where their abilities to act and react were severely limited.Poets explored how characters with such circumscribed choices negotiatedwith the men who held power. All the characters in dramatic productions— even those with no power in the polis— were played by citizen male actorswho were masked and robed in costume; the dramatic characters werewine, theater, and transformation197"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"then viewed by thousands of onlookers who experienced this Dionysian role- playing produced on the stage at the civic festival.Although most characters from Athenian tragedy were heroic figuresfrom the long- ago past, the themes and issues they addressed on the stageoften touched upon current topics of public debate in Athens: issues sur-rounding justice, punishment, and the role of the courts (Aeschylus’sOresteia); the rightful exercise of knowledge and authority by men in posi-tions of power and the response to those who exercise their authoritywrongfully (Sophocles’ Theban plays Oedipusand Antigone); and the treat-ment of powerless people and the abuse or murder of defeated captives(some of Euripides’ later plays). At the same time, comedy was uniformlyset in the present. Here the commentary on current politics was absolutelyexplicit, but the situations of comedy were full of fantasy and impossibility:for example, citizen wives calling a sex strike and negotiating a peace treatyfor the war with Sparta (Lysistrata), women taking over the ekklesia(Ecclesi-azusae), a god and a slave journeying to the underworld to talk to tragic po-ets now dead (Frogs). Even a phi los o pher named Socrates was a major char-acter in Aristophanes’ Clouds,as will be discussed in chapter 7.In the modern world the Greeks are perhaps best remembered for de-picting the gods on stage interacting with mortals in dramatized retellingsof traditional myths. The gods could appear in the prologue of a play tointroduce characters and set up the action, and they could also resolve theaction in the final scenes, as Athena does at the end of Aeschylus’s Oresteiatrilogy. It was the tragic poet Euripides who perfected the deus ex machina,a sort of crane that suspended the actor portraying a god or hero over thestage. The deus ex machinawould typically arrive on the scene once thetragic plot had unfolded and the dead body (or bodies) had been broughtforward on a wheeled, turning platform called the ekkyklema.Dramatizedmurder and suicide in Athenian drama always happened behind the scenesbut within easy earshot of the audience. The god or hero ex machinacouldlook down on the scene and pronounce the final judgment about the right-ful relationship between gods and humans.The Olympian deities on the dramatic stage in Athens were capable ofgreat cruelty in their dealings with mortals. They did not look kindly uponany impious human behavior; they demanded worship, and they wouldundertake punishment and revenge with little hesitation. The myths retoldon the stage were not sacred narratives that reflected Athenians’ beliefsabout how the gods interacted with humans. The relentless demands andcold detachment displayed by the gods onstage also stand in contrast todionysus198"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"the propitiating prayers of real Athenian men and women who relied onancestral customs to secure the protection of their ancestors’ gods. Civicrites generally ensured the stability of the community, but within the pro-tected confines of the polis- funded dramatic festivals, Athenians could ex-plore what happened when mythic characters walked away from ancestralpractices and rejected one of the gods.One of the most memorable depictions of the god Dionysus on the stagewas presented in Euripides’ Bacchae,produced in Athens at the CityDionysia in 406, shortly before Athens fell to Sparta. Euripides raisedprovocative questions about human impiety and the nature of the godswith this play. Pentheus, a youthful royal prince in neighboring Thebes, ut-terly rejects the worship of the newly arrived god called Dionysus, and heeven denies the god’s divinity. Pentheus claims that Dionysus is a foreigner,a fraud, and an effeminate fool set on luring the wives of upstanding citi-zens away from their homes. The women seek Dionysus in the mountains,where they allegedly engage in sexual acts with the mysterious foreignerwho claims to be a god. Pentheus is dismayed to see that Dionysus’s riteshave even infected old, respected citizen men. But Dionysus demands thathe be worshipped, even if that worship overturns social norms. What is ayoung citizen to do when faced with this choice? What kind of ancestralcustom would require the reversal of all traditionally held values?While Pentheus’s mother leads the Theban women up the mountain tocelebrate Dionysus’s rites, the god takes on a disguise and approachesPentheus, promising to reveal to him the women’s licentious behavior.After dressing Pentheus in women’s clothing, Dionysus leads the youngman to see the women of Thebes, many of whom have lost their senses.Pentheus experiences the extreme madness that Dionysus can inspire, andhe dies at the hands of his own mother when she mistakes him for a wildanimal. Only then is Dionysus satisfied that his worship has been properlyrecognized by the Thebans. A play like the Bacchaeprovides us today witha view of Dionysian consciousness at its most vivid. The civic ritual of thedramatic festivals brought Athenians together as a group in order to shifttheir awareness by exploring different identities and implausible possibili-ties. Poets and actors embodied the transformative power of Dionysus; atthe same time, the thousands of citizens and noncitizens in the theaterexperienced the god of wine as the patron of Athenian civic rites in thetheater. The indifferent nature of divinity and the hard divine justice thatEuripides depicts in this play may reflect the Athenians’ mentality as theyfound themselves at the end of a long and devastating war with Sparta.

Bywatching a play about one man’s arrogance and impiety toward Dionysus,the Athenians were themselves worshipping that same god. Such was theparadoxical logic of Dionysus. He was a god that could not be denied.politics, empire, and the dramatic festivalsFestivals of Dionysus were celebrated in poleisthroughout Greece, and notjust in Athens; for centuries these annual rituals preserved ancestral cus-toms that brought a rural god of agricultural fertility into the communallife of an urban polis.But however traditional Dionysian rites may havebeen, they nevertheless did change over time: at certain moments par tic u -lar rulers or regimes could expand a civic festival or even institute a newone. The historian Thucydides provides us with evidence for this sort ofinnovation when he refers to the Anthesteria in the early spring by an alter-native name, the Older Dionysia (Thucydides 2.15). The “newer” Dionysia,which remained unnamed but was implicitly acknowledged and familiarto Thucydides’ original audience, was the City Dionysia held later in thespring. Although literary and inscriptional evidence is scarce, some classi-cal scholars today follow Thucydides and suggest that the City Dionysiawas indeed a new festival, modeled in the sixth century on other pop u larDionysian celebrations. The City Dionysia may have been instituted dur-ing the reign of Pisistratus, and the po liti cal reforms of Cleisthenesbrought further changes to the festival, evident in the dithyrambic compe-titions that required two choregoifrom each of the ten Cleisthenic tribes totrain and put forward tribal choruses of men and boys each year.The season for sailing in the Aegean got under way in the spring as thewinter storms ceased, and this change in the Athenian festival calendartook advantage of the change in weather. Celebrating the new CityDionysia in the spring month of Elaphebolion, rather than in the depth ofthe winter when dramatic festivals of Dionysus normally fell, allowed vis-itors from beyond Attica to attend the civic holiday. During the Pelopon-nesian War foreign embassies and diplomats were compelled to travel toAthens to attend the City Dionysia, where they renewed alliances with theAthenians. When Thucydides outlined the terms of the peace negotiatedbetween Athens and Sparta in 421, the terms stipulated that both parties were to renew the treaty annually with the pouring of libations at publicfestivals: Athenians were to attend a Spartan festival sacred to Apollodionysus200"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"called the Hyacinthia, while Spartans would pour spondaiwith the Athe-nians at the City Dionysia every spring in Athens.During the latter half of the fifth century, celebrations of the otherDionysian festivals in Attica changed in response to this new festival ofDionysus. As the choral and dramatic productions at the City Dionysia de-veloped under the influence of the great tragic poets, other festivals re-flected the innovations. Competitive dramatic per for mances were added tothe Athenian Lenaea around 440, when smaller rural towns were also be-ginning to emulate the popularity of the urban theatrical per for mances byadopting elements from the City Dionysia for the celebrations of the RuralDionysia. The ancient rural festivals in Attica took on a new importanceduring the mid- fifth century as residents of the rural demes began buildingtheaters in their outlying villages. Per fo r mance and public entertainmenthad always been an essential aspect of the Rural Dionysia, but the adventof theaters might suggest that per for mances were somehow becoming moreformalized. Previously organizers of the deme festivals must have built tem-porary theaters and stages, but setting aside space and resources for perma-nent stone structures, however small, demonstrated the commitment of thedemes to the god whose worshippers traveled throughout Attica every year.Indeed, our earliest archaeological evidence for permanent stone theaterscomes from Attic demes like Thoricus, and not from Athens itself; the mon-umental theater of Dionysus that still stands on the south slope of Acropo-lis dates to the fourth century. During the time of Pericles and SocratesAthenians were still sitting on ikria,the temporary wooden seats rising intiers up the lower slope of the Acropolis, or else lying on blankets on theground above the wooden seats.Whereas the wintertime Lenaea and the Rural Dionysia were frequentedalmost entirely by citizens and residents of Attica, the Athenians came toconsider the City Dionysia a festival where they could present themselvesand their polisto foreign visitors. New customs and ceremonies wereadded as the Athenian empire grew and the war continued, and at discretepoints in the civic festival Athenian citizens used the occasion of Dionysianritual to articulate their commonly held civic and imperial values. Just asSpartan diplomats annually renewed the peace with Athens by pouringspondaiat the City Dionysia (for a few years, at least, after 421), so thedemo cratically elected strategoiwho waged war also made libations in thesanctuary of Dionysus at the start of the festival (Thucydides 5.23). Thesedirectly elected generals were honored with this civic rite, and others whocontributed significantly to the well- being of the poliscommunity werewine, theater, and transformation201"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"also recognized. Not all of these honorees were Athenian citizens— some were foreigners or metics. In the fourth century (and possibly also thefifth), city benefactors received honorary crowns and garlands on stage inthe sanctuary of Dionysus.As the war with Sparta dragged on and Athenian men continued dying,more and more children lost their fathers. When Athenians gathered to-gether in the theater at the City Dionysia, they set aside time to honor thefatherless sons who were coming of age and making the transition fromephebe to adult citizen. The pro cession of ephebes entered the theater infull armor, ready to pick up where their fathers had left off in ser vice tothe polisand its empire. Other Dionysian festivals— like the Oschophoria,which celebrated the peaceful gifts of Dionysus— focused on young menat this critical time of life; during war time the City Dionysia allowed citi-zens to welcome the orphaned ephebes on the stage. The public transitionof the young men was witnessed by the citizen body, who stood in placeof fathers who had fallen in battle.The City Dionysia during the fifth century had to constantly respond tochanging circumstances as the Athenians’ pursuit of empire kept them inconflict with Sparta. During periods of intense fighting in the Pelopon-nesian War, Athenians reduced the total number of plays staged for the fes-tival, perhaps as a cost- cutting mea sure; in war time plays were staged forthree consecutive days, but in peacetime four. But regardless of the numberof days given over to per fo r mance, one thing did remain the same: the civicrituals of the City Dionysia reminded Athens’ subject- allies of their subor-dinate status in the larger Athenian arche.Members of the Delian League were required to attend the annual springtime festival and participate in thepro cession of Dionysus, which came to a halt in the god’s sanctuary southof the Acropolis. In a visible display of imperial power Athens reservedplaces in the pro cession for subject- allies. Some cities were required to carrya phallus honoring Dionysus in the pompe.But all subject- allies sent diplo-mats to march in the pro cession in which Athenians exhibited the empire’stribute. In this way the greatest honor was reserved for the Athenian arche,which used this religious festival to receive the annual phorosor tributefrom its subject- allies. One source states that the tribute was displayed inthe theater for all to see (Isocrates de Pace82). Some of these funds fromthe allies in the Delian League were dedicated to Athena, and some tributeeventually rested in Athena’s trea sury on the Acropolis. The first day of thecivic festival saw Dionysus cooperating with Athena. The glory and powerdionysus202"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"of Athens, visible in the display of tribute, itself became an annual per for -mance in the sanctuary and theater of Dionysus.Theater, both comedy and tragedy, may well be one of the most impor-tant cultural gifts that Greece bestowed upon the West. Dionysus was agod who demanded shifts in awareness, and his capacity to coax worship-pers out of their habitual modes of thought and behavior arguably liber-ated the Athenians by allowing them to express potentially dangerous ideasthat they normally repressed. Drama was a good framework for thinking:tragedy and comedy both provided the Athenians with a ritual structureand a language they could use to safely explore contemporary social andpo liti cal issues. The civic rites of theater enabled the Athenians to criticizethemselves and their government, and voice dissent. The one attempt weknow of to limit that dissent was unpop u lar and short- lived. At the sametime, Athenians also used the City Dionysia to celebrate their empire andglory in their rule over subject- allies. The god Dionysus, with his manyand sometimes contradictory faces, was uniquely equipped to express thisparadox in fifth- century Athenian public life.toward the dionysian mysteriesWriting in the 1960s, the cultural anthropologist Victor Turner observedhow ritual behaviors that temporarily invert normal relationships in theend serve only to reinforce established social structures. The same could besaid of civic festivals for Dionysus. The adolescent boys and young menwho dressed as women at Dionysian festivals— both dramatic festivals suchas the Lenaea and Dionysia and the wine festival of the Oschophoria— would in time become voting citizens in the Athenian Assembly and mem-bers of the demos.Those ritualized moments of gender- bending and in-verted identity in the state calendar reminded all in Athens that throughtransformation and transcendence Dionysus could empower not just wor-shippers but the whole polisitself.In art and myth Dionysus also had a close association with Hades, thegod of the underworld, who also had the power to transform human ex-perience. This tradition was reflected in a dramatic role played by thecharacter Dionysus in the Frogs,a comedy by Aristophanes produced atthe Lenaea in 405. In this play a slave named Xanthias accompanies Diony-sus to the underworld. Dionysus is still trying to understand the Argi-nusae disaster, and he is looking for some good tragic poets to write newwine, theater, and transformation203"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"plays for the Athenian stage. In the house of Hades they meet up withboth Euripides, who had only recently died, and Aeschylus. The two de-bate the merits of their tragic styles. In the end Dionysus decides to bringAeschylus back to Athens so he can save the city. A play like the Frogs,with its irreverent humor (often at the god’s expense) and frank assessmentof the po liti cal situation, shows how anyone who took part in a dramaticproduction or simply attended the theater participated in the civic rites ofthis god.The transformative power found in Dionysian festivals of wine anddrama was also experienced in the god’s famed ability to possess his wor-shippers. The mysteries and orgiaof Dionysus celebrated the ecstasy of thegod and the new life that accompanied death. Unfortunately, physical andliterary evidence for this aspect of Dionysian worship in Athens is largelylacking for the fifth century. Some scholars look to the maenads depictedon stage in Euripides’ Bacchae,but their behavior may actually have beenthe inspiration for some cult activities known to have existed in the fourthcentury and later. The Derveni papyrus, a mid- fourth- century fragmentarytext with philosophical commentary, offers scholars tantalizing clues aboutDionysian mysteries. Found half- charred in a grave in Macedonia in 1962,the papyrus was published in full only in 2006. The poem quoted in thepapyrus is concerned with the origins of the gods, and the attached com-mentary reveals insights about those initiated in Dionysus’s mysteries. Theserites may perhaps be related to late fifth- century practices in Athens, andthe ideas appear to be those pop u lar ized by traveling scholars like Anaxago-ras; even today, scholars are studying these connections.However the Dionysian mysteries were celebrated in the time of Periclesand Socrates, they did not require the sort of monumental infrastructurethat Demeter’s Eleusinian Mysteries acquired in the fifth century. Diony-sus’s orgia were experienced at home. A detailed outline of initiation ritesfrom fourth- century Athens is preserved in the corpus of speeches be-longing to Demosthenes. Demosthenes sneeringly described a nighttimeDionysian ritual celebrated by a mixed group of men and women. Theyoung son Aeschines assisted his mother in the orgiaand read from a sacredbook; initiates dressed in fawn- skins sat in the dark around a krater ofwine. After a frightening priestess lurched out of the dark, the initiates roseup screaming and announced, “I escaped the evil, I found the better.” Byday the boy then led a small pro cession through the public streets of thecity; now the initiates wore garlands, and the boy brandished a snake(Demosthenes On the Crown 18.258–61). Demosthenes clearly was a hostiledionysus204"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"witness to such Dionysian rites in Athens, and no evidence for such initia-tions exists for the Periclean city, but small- scale celebrations of the god were probably common.One type of Dionysian celebration was represented on vases commonlyproduced throughout the fifth century. The vases depict women in variouspostures of ecstatic dance. Maenads play music and dance around the altaras they worship the god in total abandon. Often Dionysus himself is pres-ent on the vases in the form of a pillar or column that is draped or clothedin a rudimentary way, and topped with the bearded mask of the god. Largecontainers of wine stand at the ready. Vases made in the mid- fifth centurydepict women who are more composed; they stand at tables ladling winefrom a larger container into a smaller cup, as in figure 12. The column withthe mask representing Dionysus remains constant as he oversees the wor-ship of the Athenian women. It is thought that these images depict ritesfrom the Lenaea or possibly the Anthesteria; inarguably, they show womenworshipping the god in their own way. Another type of vase similarly showshow intimate groups of men sometimes worshipped Dionysus. These so- called Anacreontic vases depict men in women’s dress— wearing long, ef-feminate tunics and earrings, dressing their hair like a woman’s, and some-times carry ing a lady’s parasol. The men dance while a flute girl playsmusic. Such ritual transvestism seen elsewhere in the worship of Dionysusrecalls the god’s ability to cross the gender boundary, as he combined bothmale and female physical characteristics in the Bacchae.Archaic and classical vase paintings depicting the god of wine and his in-spired worshippers are still recognizable to many modern viewers. Picturesof the bearded god and his ecstatic female followers encircled by ivy vinesand clusters of grapes suggest that Dionysus’s worshippers experienced asense of freedom and license. Museums throughout the world are full ofpots and vases that document the cultural reality of drinking in ancientGreece, and tourists throughout the Mediterranean visit amphitheaters,some of the best preserved and most visible of ancient Greek architecturalruins. Today the Hellenistic theater at Epidaurus in the Peloponnese isagain hosting productions of classical drama on warm summer eve nings.For Socrates in Plato’s Symposium,the custom of worshipping Diony-sus through drama enabled Athenians to experience the full and some-times contradictory complexities of human life: Socrates argued thatcomedy and tragedy were so closely bound up together that a true poetcould not master one without the other.

For the nextfew years, themes that had been performed on the stage in ritualizeddrama were played out again in the shared life of the city. During this timeAthenians could not stop returning in their public debates to the episodesof 415, 411, 406 and 404. They understood themselves and their recentpast in a different light after they restored the democracy in 403 and puttheir ancestral laws back into place. This reinterpretation of traditionalcultic nomoiitself provided another way for citizens to reflect on the pastand debate what they wanted for the future of their polis.In the four years leading up to Socrates’ trial, Athenians were returningto the business of running the polisand worshipping the gods according totheir ancestral customs. With the Thirty deposed and democracy restored,Athenians again debated what they called the patrios politeia,their ancestralconstitution. Disagreements soon arose about the content of their actuallaws and customs. Some nomoihad been abolished during the reign of theThirty, and before that some had perhaps never been written down in full.In part, disagreements that arose reflected long- standing differences be-tween average citizens and wealthy aristocrats, and in public debates eachside called upon its memory of ta patriato support its own interests and pointof view. In the absence of any universally held understanding of the past, itproved challenging to move forward. In the end Athenians settled on a newconcept for nomos,one that placed the sovereignty of written law over thesometimes fractious outcomes that had been produced by pop u lar votes inthe assembly during the last de cades of the war. It was the complex pro cessof restoring the democracy after 403 and setting religious and civic customsback in place that brought Athenians to their new understanding of lawand nomos.New practices confirming the sovereignty of law were implemented,and while this was happening three significant trials took place, each ofwhich addressed asebeiaand the place of public piety in Athenian com-munal life. These were the trials of Andocides, of Nicomachus, and, in399, of Socrates. In times of social tension Athenians were inclined to re-spond to po liti cal crises by evoking ritual norms and cultic behaviors. Inthe affairs of the Herms and the Mysteries in 415, reports of secret impi-ous acts had raised fears that aristocratic hetaireiai were fomenting an oli-garchic revolution, and the trial and execution of the Arginusae generalsin 406 reminded Athenians of the centrality of ancestors and funerals inthe communal life of the polis.The trials of Andocides, Nicomachus, andSocrates suggest that after the restoration of the democracy Atheniansimpiety trials in a restored democracy209"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"still considered po liti cal and cultic issues completely interwoven. To workout tough issues as a community, the demosrelied on civic rites.The trial of Socrates, today the best known of the three, exemplifiedAthenian legal procedures that involved cult practices in the restored de-mocracy after 403. Socrates’ accusers officially presented their claims of ase-beiabefore the archfn basileus,who had oversight over cases involving reli-gious matters and hom i cide. After reviewing the evidence against Socrates,this magistrate determined that the case required a trial. In a matter of afew weeks Socrates was brought before a jury of Athenian citizens, foundguilty, and sentenced to death. The means of execution was a potion poi-soned with hemlock. Although the Athenians had witnessed emotionalpublic trials for asebeiain the past, they perhaps could not have predictedthe final outcomes of this par tic u lar trial in 399. Even after Socrates’death, public debate continued as speakers and writers replayed the trialby publishing examples of prosecution and defense speeches that were, orcould have been, delivered in the courtroom that day. Plato’s Apologybe-came the most famous of the published defense speeches for Socrates, butother men wrote on both sides of the issues that surrounded the indict-ment, trial, and execution of Socrates.According to one biographer of the ancient phi los o phers working inthe third century ce,the Athenians experienced a change of heart soonafter Socrates’ execution: they regretted that they had convicted the phi -los o pher and put him to death. Diogenes Laertius reports that the Athe-nians passed a motion to honor Socrates by commissioning a bronzestatue of him to be set up in the Pompeion, a new public building goingup in the Kerameikos district (Diogenes Laertius 2.43). The Pompeionwas intended to serve as a gathering place for civic religious pro cessions,pompai,that marched through the city. Diogenes also reports that somemen who had prosecuted Socrates were subsequently put on trial them-selves and banished, with one accuser given a death sentence for takingthe leading role in Socrates’ prosecution. Diogenes had access to documentsand materials now lost, but these materials were not always accurate. Thetradition that he recorded may or may not be true, but even if it is notwholly reliable Diogenes’ biography of Socrates does give us a glimpseinto what historians in the ancient world believed the impetuous Atheni-ans were capable of at this moment in their history.

The surrender of Athens in 404 did not bring an end toall civic and social strife within the city. On the contrary, a continuing Spar-tan military presence only heightened factional tensions. With the supportof Sparta the temporary committee of citizens leading the transitional gov-ernment launched a coup d’état. Although they were charged with simplyrestoring the patrioi nomoi,these thirty Athenians turned Athens upsidedown (Xenophon Hellenica2.3). Among the first acts of the Thirty was thesuspension of the polis’s most ancient laws: the laws of Solon and Ephialteson public view at the Areopagus were removed (Aristotle Athenian Constitu-tion35). Following this action, other laws that allowed for disagreement andpublic debate were annulled. Little discretionary power was left to the As-sembly, the Council, or the juries in the law courts. It became impossible toamend the Thirty’s authority by passing new decrees.Even the physical spaces of Athens changed under the rule of theThirty. The Pnyx, the outdoor area where the Assembly met to debate andvote on issues, was physically reconfigured by the Thirty. Since the latesixth and early fifth centuries the Athenian demoshad met on a hillsidejust west of the Agora and Acropolis. The gentle grade of the hill near theridge provided a natural theater: the speaker’s platform stood on the down-ward slope and the demosranged on the hillside above. From that positionAthenians could look northeast over the Agora, or southeast across to therecently completed Propylaea on the Acropolis above; to the south theycould see the Aegean Sea. Aristophanes’ comedies joke about how dis-tractible the demoswas when attending the Assembly on the Pnyx— they were mesmerized by the sight of their public monuments and the sea thatgave power to the naval empire (Aristophanes Archarnians 27–33 andWasps 31–42). But tradition has it that under the Thirty the Pnyx was re-modeled; a long retaining wall was built along the northeast edge, the sideof the hill was carved away and regraded, and the orientation of the demosand the speaker’s platform reversed (see figure 2). Subsequently, Athenianassemblymen could no longer enjoy the inspiring views of their city andits navy; instead they looked upon an inland plain, the source of wealthfor the aristocrats of Attica (Plutarch Themistocles19).Meanwhile a Spartan garrison occupied the most sacred spot in Athens,the Acropolis, and the Thirty governed from the Tholos: the building thatimpiety trials in a restored democracy211"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"formerly housed the committee that ran the Council was now the source ofterror and threats of terror. Citizens mysteriously disappeared in the night,and by day 300 men armed with whips patrolled the public streets. Critiasbecame the regime’s most feared leader. What had started as a temporarygovernment brought on open civil war between an oligarchic faction inAthens headed by the Thirty and demo crats who in time or ga nized a re sis -tance and made their base in the port city of the Piraeus. Eventually theSpartan general Pausanias stepped in to put down the demo cratic faction,and only then did he forcibly depose the bloody regime of the Thirty.As soon as Athenians had restored the democracy a second time, theystarted work on normalizing the routine operation of the demo craticconstitution that had been suspended during the Thirty’s reign. They were determined to renew the polis,and the best way to accomplish thiswas by reinvigorating the constitution, or patrios politeia,and returningto the customs of their ancestors. The demoselected a new interim govern-ing council of twenty that had an equal number of demo crats and oligarchs;each of the ten Cleisthenic tribes probably elected two men. Workingfrom within their traditional structure of demes and tribes, the Atheni-ans strove to reestablish the traditional foundations of their polis.Evenstripped of the empire they still had plenty of issues to debate, and plentyof decisions to discuss together.The interim committee of twenty arranged elections for magistrateswho would oversee the reinstatement of the Assembly, the Council, and theprytaneis.At the same time the temporary committee also needed to reviveanother underpinning that was essential to maintain civic life in Athens:the law courts, and thus the rule of law. During the last quarter of the fifthcentury the Assembly and the law courts had turned into public forumswhere civil strife and social tensions played themselves out. Individualsfrequently exercised their right to publicly accuse others of crimes againstthe state through a procedure called the eisangelia.The eisangeliawasprobably employed in 415 when Pythonicus stood up at a meeting and ac-cused Alcibiades and others of profaning the Mysteries, and again whenthe Assembly condemned Alcibiades to death in absentia and instructedthe priest of Demeter to curse him. This procedure enabled private citi-zens to lodge damaging information against others at a meeting of theCouncil or Assembly by bringing forward information about alleged mis-conduct, subversion, or treason. If the demoswished to pursue the matter,the case was referred to law courts; the most egregious cases were tried be-fore the entire Assembly.

Asebeiawas nowhere defined as a legal term— it was just an aspect of Athenian law that the demosassumed everyone un-derstood, and the final judgment for such cases was left in the hands ofcitizens.The restoration of the Athenian constitution included some proceduralchanges in the judicial system. The eisangeliaprocedure was apparentlymodified, and some attempt was made to define sacred laws more pre-cisely; as a result, piety and impiety were no longer interpreted accordingto the oral transmission of nomos.Another of the essential foundationsfor the restoration was an act that modern scholars call the Amnesty of403. The precise terms of the amnesty are not known today; what is clearis that this reconciliation agreement set guidelines for the trials of thosecitizens who had been intimately involved in the two coups during the lastde cade of the war. The reign of the Thirty received especially close scrutiny.The interim leadership drew up ground rules, and agreed that only citi-zens with taxable property would be eligible to sit on the trials for theThirty. An oligarchic property qualification for jurors diverged from thestandard practices of the demo cratic law courts, which not only hadlacked any wealth requirement but even went so far as to offer daily payfor jurors. But only social and economic peers would be qualified to sit injudgment of the leaders of the short- lived but heavy- handed oligarchiesof 411 and 404.Significantly, the amnesty agreement also limited the scope of the pros-ecutions: only the top leadership of the oligarchic governments could betried in court. Although thousands had supported the cause of the oligarchicrevolutions of 411 and 404, or been somehow associated with oligarchicfactions and hetaireiai,the amnesty stipulated that ordinary citizens couldnot be indicted for crimes against the state that had occurred prior to therestoration of the democracy in 403. Hom i cide was the single exception tothis guideline. Only the Thirty themselves could be put on trial, plus ahandful of their underlings: a committee of officials known as the Elevenwho ran the po liti cal prisons and supervised torture, and the Thirty’s sub-ordinates in the Piraeus. Once any ringleaders who had survived the civilwar were tried and sentenced, no one else could be charged with commit-ting crimes against the state during the period of po liti cal uncertainty andinstability that followed the fall of Athens.

Xenophon reports that in accordance with the Amnestyof 403, an additional oath was required of all jurors when they took theirdaily oath of office at the start of the day in the law courts: “We will re-member past offences no more” (Xenophon Hellenica2.4).The Amnesty of 403 sought to address several important needs of the re-habilitated democracy. First of all, it explicitly stated that past offensesshould remain in the past. This helped create an environment for healingthe city’s wounds. The Thirty’s reign of betrayal and murder had been trau-matic and the danger was great that factional strife would continue. Bybringing to trial only surviving members of the oligarchic leadership, Athe-nians were able to maintain some degree of public accountability for civicwrongdoing without branding everyone involved— especially those withlittle authority who got caught up in any atrocities. Establishing a wealth re-quirement for the citizens sitting on these juries demonstrated an effort tolimit the severity of the punishments: poorer citizens who had supported thedemo crats and suffered greatly in the civil war could not use the court pro-ceedings to exact revenge, though they could be called to give evidenceagainst the Thirty.Equally important, the amnesty also freed up the courts to handle themore mundane tasks of governing the polisin the way that ancestral civiccustoms had traditionally governed the city of Athens. For several genera-tions citizens had been chosen by lot from all classes to serve on the lawcourts, and they were given the task of sitting in judgment over their peers.Jurors were considered experts in judging their peers’ adherence to nomoi— the ancestral laws and religious customs that governed cases involving theft,inheritance and citizenship disputes, impiety, subversion, misconduct inoffice, and corruption of elected and appointed officials. Athenian law al-lowed for the prosecution of two types of cases: private cases of personal in-jury and public cases of wrong committed against the state. The latter cate-gory could be prosecuted by any citizen. Most murder and hom i cide cases were handled separately by the Areopagus. The law courts and citizen juries were never intended, nor were they equipped, to handle cases of high trea-son, po liti cal assassination, and insurrection on such a grand scale as wouldbe needed following the final restoration of the democracy. During the fewshort months of the Thirty’s reign more than 1,500 citizens had been assas-sinated, and thousands of others fled the city after they had been wronged orunlawfully disfranchised.

The accusers cited Andocides’ allegedrecent impious actions (probably dated to the fall of 401), and they also re-ferred back to acts committed in the summer of 415, when Andocides hadbeen imprisoned during the affairs of the Mysteries and the Herms. Infact much of our information about the profanation of the Mysteries andthe mutilation of the Herms in 415 comes from the defense speech Ando-cides gave in 399. Just as he had managed to do in 415, Andocides againsuccessfully defended himself in 399— in this case, against a group of atleast four prosecutors who were seeking the death penalty against him.In a highly unusual coincidence, two written accounts that were com-posed for this case have survived: a speech for the prosecution and the speechfor the defense.

Thespeech delivered by the prosecution in the trial of Andocides is an exampleof this latter sort. It is preserved today among the speeches of a successfulspeechwriter named Lysias, who was well known for composing persuasivespeeches that effectively captured the attention of the Athenian citizen ju-rors. When scholars study the speeches of Lysias, including this one, theycan reconstruct the kinds of assumptions held by the average citizen.Lysias was a metic, and he was well- attuned to attitudes common amongthe citizen population. He was also a master at using this familiarity to hisfull advantage.Andocides, about 40 years old at the time of this asebeiatrial in 399,composed his own defense speech. Though it lacks some of the rhetoricalflair and sophistication of the speech preserved in the corpus of Lysias, ittoo reveals how an elite Athenian citizen judged it best to present himselfto his fellow citizens, many of whom did not share his wealth and high so-cial standing. In his defense, known as On the Mysteries,Andocides namesfour of his most active and vocal prosecutors: Agyrrhios, Epichares, Kephi-sios, and Meletus. Callias son of Hipponicus, an aristocrat with par tic u larinterests in religious matters who also had ties to the oligarchs, may wellhave been the moving force behind the indictment. Callias was apparentlyembroiled in a quarrel with Andocides over the estate of a mutual kins-man, and he was also a civic religious official with priestly responsibilitiesas dadouchosat the Eleusinian Mysteries. Andocides delivered On the Mys-teriesin his own defense. Nothing from either speech indicates which ofthe four named men delivered the prosecution speech that is preserved inLysias. Some scholars feel that all four men spoke at the trial, with Kephi-sios acting as main prosecutor; the speech preserved in the Lysianic corpusmay well have been delivered by the man named Meletus.It is clear from both speeches that while the accusers were charging An-docides with an act of impiety performed in the immediate past— namely,taking part in the Eleusinian Mysteries and in other Athenian civic ritessacred to Demeter around the year 401— they also had in mind earlier in-stances of Andocides’ admitted acts of impiety. Andocides’ troubles withproper civic behavior and the norms of Athenian public piety had first sur-faced back in 415 at the height of Athenian imperial power, when he wasperhaps about 25 years old. As discussed in chapter 4, Andocides, who be-longed to a leading and wealthy Athenian family, had been imprisonedwhen Diocleides accused him and others of meeting in private and pro-faning public shrines and civic rites.

The accusers appealed to the Athenians’ still- raw emotions about the course of the war and the fall of the city and em-pire. Athenians also continued to suffer the grief and regret associatedwith the earlier losses of the Sicilian expedition. In the minds of the Athe-nians in 399, the two crises that took place in the early summer of 415— the mutilation of the Herms and the desecration of the Mysteries— werebound up with the betrayals of Alcibiades and the subsequent loss of theAthenian navy at Syracuse. Such blatant disrespect for the laws and customsof the ancestors in 415 had been widely interpreted at that time as an illomen for the upcoming expedition to Sicily. It was Alcibiades’ treason thathelped bring on the devastating defeat in Sicily in 413, not to mention theescalation of the war on Attic soil at Decelea after 413. Some Athenians feltthat open acts of impiety exhibited by bands of aristocratic young men in415 overstepped the norms of ta patria;some reportedly even believed thatthe military losses were the direct result of the gods punishing Athens forallowing such impious behaviors in the polis.The prosecution speech delivered in 399 took advantage of such sharedmemories, and the jury members were forced to recall that these two reli-gious and social crises from 415 had also sparked the major impiety trialsthat took place during the Peloponnesian War. In the initial wave of trialsconducted in the summer of 415, acts associated with religious and civicimpiety were for the first time openly connected with oligarchic treasonagainst the state. Extensive investigations were launched, wrongdoersidentified, and those judged guilty punished. Andocides had gained noto-riety in the trials of 415 as a prime witness for the state’s investigation. Onthe basis of earlier information provided by Diocleides, Andocides hadbeen arrested and imprisoned for sacrilegious behavior: mutilating theHerms. In return for immunity Andocides then testified as an eyewitnessto the impious activities that took place shortly before the launch of thenaval expedition. Andocides was willing— and able— to name names. Al-though Diocleides had claimed that more than 300 men took part in themutilation of the Herms, Andocides testified that Diocleides was really apaid informer giving false witness and maintained that a smaller number were involved.

Moreover, in the defense speech given fifteen years afterthe fact Andocides offered a credible account of the alleged profanation ofthe Mysteries of Demeter that also had taken place in the spring of 415.The Athenians had readily believed his account in 415, and they had grantedhim immunity in exchange for the names provided in his testimony. An-docides in 399 had every reason to hope that the jury would believe him asecond time.After his testimony in 415 Andocides was found guilty of impiety, but hewas not exiled because he had been granted immunity. Nor were his citizenrights taken away. But those Andocides had named did not fare so well.They were found guilty of impiety and ordered into exile; many had theirproperty confiscated by the state. Diocleides was executed. Although Ando-cides was not officially exiled in 415, he did become the target of a significantamount of po liti cal ill- will. Shortly after he testified a decree was passed inthe Assembly aimed specifically at him: it forbade those who had openlyconfessed to acts of civic impiety from entering any of sanctuaries or templesin the polis— even the Athenian Agora. Since the Agora— with its altars,public monuments, state institutions, and shady stoas— was the civic, cultic,and financial center of the city, this decree successfully brought forward byIsotimides effectively blocked Andocides from every aspect of public lifein Athens. In response to this form of civic and ritual exclusion, Andocides,a young man of wealth, connection, and promise, willingly chose to go intoexile. He became a prosperous merchant and trader, traveled all over theAegean, and reported in his defense speech in 399 that he had undertakenbusiness activities in Sicily and Italy that supported the Athenian navy.Doubtless the continuing hostilities between the Athenian empire and thealliance headed by Sparta afforded him many business opportunities.In 399 Andocides claimed that he had always remained loyal to Athens,even while in exile. Shortly before the first oligarchic revolution in 411 heshowed his goodwill to the demo cratic leaders of the polisby reportedlyselling the Athenian navy a shipment of oars at cost. Andocides then triedto return to Athens, but by the time he actually arrived in the city the oli-garchy of the Four Hundred had seized power and the demo cratic leadershad fled. Among those new leaders of the oligarchs in 411 were men whomhe had named in the investigation of 415. Those in power imprisoned andtortured him for a second time and then released him. Andocides returnedto his self- imposed exile.socrates218"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"More than ten years later all of this ostensibly lay in the past, and ac-cording to the amnesty agreement of 403 Andocides was not liable forcrimes against the state committed prior to the reign of the Thirty in 404.Indeed, Andocides considered the second restoration of the democracyand the amnesty another opportunity to return home to Athens. But hispo liti cal foes persisted, and they found a way to prosecute him even in atime of forgiveness and reconciliation. In the impiety case brought forwardin 399, Andocides was charged with violating the decree of Isotimides.The prosecution argued that Andocides had broken this law twice sincehis return from self- imposed exile: first by attending the Mysteries ofDemeter held in Eleusis in the fall of 401 and a second time when he re-portedly entered the Eleusinion, the sanctuary sacred to Demeter on thenorth slope of the Acropolis, where he placed a suppliant’s olive branch atthe altar of the goddess.It is significant that Meletus and the accusers at Andocides’ trial in 399repeatedly reminded the jury of the crimes from 415. Both the earlierprofanation of the Mysteries and the mutilation of the Herms were citedas evidence for Andocides’ admitted membership in a hetaireiathat com-mitted acts of impiety. At the trial in 399 Andocides did not deny havingparticipated in some acts of civic impiety in 415, associating himself withthose who had mutilated the Herms; but he went to great lengths to dis-tance himself from those who had profaned the Mysteries. Furthermore,once he returned from exile around 403 he began spending his hard- earned wealth on the city of Athens. For the next three years he consis-tently demonstrated a willingness to perform liturgies for the demos,suchas underwriting the Attic festival of the Hephaestia and serving as theAthenian representative in panhellenic embassies to the Olympian andIsthmian athletic festivals.Though the complete truthfulness of Andocides’ first account given in415 cannot be ascertained, the repetition of his testimony in 399 reflects whata jury of Athenians after the restoration of the democracy believed aristo-cratic citizens had been capable of before the coups of 411 and 404. In 415some citizens had feared that the democracy was in danger; they suspectedthat aristocrats like Andocides were fomenting a revolution and using pri-vate religious associations as venues for or ga niz ing themselves. In the mem-ories of the citizens in 399, opportunities in the past for oligarchs to meetand plan insurrection became equated with “impious” cultic worship. By 399Athens had indeed suffered two oligarchic coups, and some citizens mayhave felt (after the fact) that their earlier suspicions had been justified. Yetimpiety trials in a restored democracy219"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Andocides, who never denied his aristocratic connections or even his guilt,was able to align himself with the demo cratic side in the revolutions of 411and 404. This position, so cleverly captured in his speech, reveals the Athe-nians’ concern for their own actions, especially during the rule of theThirty. Citizens who had been absent from Athens during the Thirty’sreign could use their absence as proof of their demo cratic leanings. Thisstrategy would also come into play in the other two trials of 399.the trial of nicomachus: ‘asebeia’ and public ‘nomoi’Soon after the trial of Andocides there was another important trial inAthens that centered on a par tic u lar citizen and the correct public worshipof the ancestral gods. This was the trial of Nicomachus. Of the three impi-ety cases known from 400/399, the one involving Nicomachus remains themost unclear. Still, the basics of the case against Nicomachus are reason-ably secure. Nicomachus was an ordinary citizen who was employed bythe state. He spent a long time— possibly as many as ten years— researching,or ga niz ing, and republishing the laws of Athens. Although this work wasbegun after the first oligarchic revolution was suppressed in 410, it wasn’tcompleted until after the second restoration of the democracy in 403.Shortly thereafter, Nicomachus was brought to trial on charges that he wasa lawbreaker, paranomos,who had deliberately and repeatedly pervertedthe laws of the ancestors.Back in 410 the demoshad determined that reinstating the ancestral cus-toms and constitution was the right thing to do once the Four Hundred were removed from power. Since tensions still remained between the oli-garchs and the demo crats about the particulars of the patrios politeia,itwas agreed that a committee of citizens called the anagrapheis,those who“write up,” would go through available written rec ords and codify thelaws. Nicomachus was one of those assigned the responsibility of oversee-ing the research and the transcription of laws onto stone tables that wouldbe publicly displayed in civic buildings in the Agora. The earliest laws, in-cluding the hom i cide laws of Draco, were quickly republished, but it tookthe codification committee a longer time to review and or ga nize the lawsand decrees passed in the time of Solon and afterward. Sometime between410 and 405 the Athenians showed their continuing support for the codifi-cation project by approving the creation of a new and central public archivelocated in the Agora.socrates220"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The work of the anagrapheiswas interrupted by the second oligarchicrevolution in 404; with the resumption of the democracy in 403 anothercommittee of law experts was formed, this time known as the nomothetai,the men who “place laws.” Nicomachus was apparently one of their num-ber, too. As he was finishing the work of the nomothetai,he was indictedfor using his office to secretly change and manipulate the ancestral nomoi.The speech Nicomachus gave in his own defense has not survived, but theprosecution speech, like the prosecution speech for Andocides’ trial, is pre-served in the corpus of Lysias. The precise charge is not stated in Lysias,but the accusers do repeatedly argue that Nicomachus was not preservingthe worship of the city’s gods in the way that ta patriademanded. The pro -secutors argued that Nicomachus was not publishing the nomoicorrectly,especially the nomoiconcerning civic sacrifice and the public worship ofthe gods.In a world without books, newspapers, or the printing press, makingwritten information available for public access involved different technolo-gies than it does today. For fifth- and fourth- century Athenians and theirancestors, “publishing” meant posting information in a public place, oftenby inscribing the words on stone or wood. Since the Re nais sance, inscrip-tions have been incorporated into buildings and monuments in the Westas decorative architectural elements. Inscriptions in block capital lettersevoke Greco- Roman antiquity in a stylized and highly recognizable way.Inscriptions on neoclassical American structures generally provide basicinformation; for instance, the lettering over an entrance to a public build-ing may distinguish the county court house from a U.S. post office. But assimple descriptive titles, these modern- day inscriptions do not serve a sig-nificant function for citizens as they pursue their civic responsibilities.For classical Athenians, inscribed boards, stones, and plaques were ubiq-uitous in public places, and they served a purpose absolutely essential toAthenian democracy. Since bound books had not yet come into use, muchof the Athenian law code was inscribed onto stone tablets known as stelaiand then erected in public, often in or near the Agora. Wooden planks andplastered walls and other vertical surfaces were also used for publishingcivic documents and laws. The words of decrees and laws were inscribed orpainted in uniform block letters, without any punctuation or even spacesbetween the words. Official inscriptions often used abbreviations for com-monly used phrases, and many Athenian laws began with an abbreviatedevocation of the city’s gods. Since some Athenians were not literate enoughto read the complex inscriptions, those citizens who were unable to readimpiety trials in a restored democracy221"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"relied on their family and friends to read the published laws and decreesout loud for them.Inscribing law codes for public display was a nearly universal customamong all the Greek poleis,regardless of the form of their constitutions.The inscribed law code from the polisof Gortyn on the island of Crete isanother important and early example that is today much studied by schol-ars. Indeed, other peoples in the eastern Mediterranean basin and WestAsia also published their law codes on hard surfaces and placed them inpublic. Examples of this common practice are evident in the Egyptianhieroglyphs inscribed on stone pillars or painted on walls, the ancientMesopotamian law code of Hammurabi inscribed on stone, and the stonetablet of laws said to have been presented to the Israelites by Moses at Sinai.The Athenians prided themselves in their demo cratic constitution andits customs of equal participation for all citizens. Public access to the lawsin their published form was a high priority. The base of the monument forthe eponymous heroes in the Agora (constructed in the fourth century)served as a public forum for publishing information relating to the demes,and it has been suggested that the vertical surfaces on the sides and theback of herms also served as notice boards. Decrees and acts passed by theAssembly were published on wooden planks and stone stelai,and laws andregulations related to public temples and sacred shrines were published onstone blocks and placed at the entrance to the holy areas. Inscribed bound-ary stones marked the limits or temenoiof public sacred areas; archaeolo-gists have unearthed boundary stones for many Athenian public spaces,including the Agora and the Pnyx. Nomoiregulating cultic behavior stipu-lated who was and was not permitted to enter a sanctuary, and under whatconditions entrance was permitted. Stone stelaialso listed the types of sac-rifices and votive gifts allowed and not allowed. Official calendars of polisand deme festivals and sacrifices were published on these stone blocks anddisplayed, and public proclamations of ac know ledg ment and thanks wereinscribed and dedicated to the gods in their sanctuaries, as inscriptions andother inscribed objects at panhellenic sanctuaries such as Delphi, Eleusis,and Olympia bear witness.The most ancient laws of Athens, those of Draco and Solon, were in-scribed on wooden pillars and stone blocks and placed on display in theRoyal Stoa in the Agora. These wooden pillars, called axones,appear to havebeen inscribed on all sides and mounted on a vertical axis so that they couldbe rotated as they were read. There is also evidence for a late fifth- centurymethod of publishing laws provisionally and temporarily by inscribing orsocrates222"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"painting the text on wooden boards, which would be displayed in publicbefore a copy of the document was stored, possibly on papyrus in thepublic archives. It is indeed highly likely that laws were stored on papyrus,but papyrus, like wood, does not last in the Mediterranean climate andonly a few examples have survived to be excavated by modern archaeolo-gists. Finally, not all laws were written. There is evidence from the fifthcentury for “unwritten laws,” agraptoi nomoi.As a part of the body of in-herited ancestral custom, these unpublished laws were so basic that theAthenian demosassumed they were universally known and upheld.Clearly this profusion of public legal rec ords, stone stelai,and paintedwooden boards constituted thousands of inscriptions and documents, andeventually created a serious storage problem. Volumes of books can take upconsiderable shelf space in modern libraries, but imagine how much morespace wooden boards and stone tablets required. While some of the morecurrent laws, decrees, and proclamations would be on display in the openfor all to see and read, a backlog of older inscriptions needed to be tran-scribed to a different material and stored in a public place where citizenscould still have access to them. In the waning days of its empire in the fifthcentury, while still a democracy, Athens created a central archive for thestorage of public rec ords in an older, sacred public building. This archivecalled the Metroön was, like most public buildings in Athens, located inthe Agora, in the old Council house immediately next to the new Council house (built sometime between 410 and 405). The Metroön combinedcivic, legal, and cultic functions; it served as a shrine to the Mother of thegods at the same time that it stored the rec ords of the Athenian demos— the official nomoias published on papyrus, wood, and stone stelai.Some stelai were stored and the texts from other stone blocks werecopied onto papyrus, but the remaining stones were not permanently lostor destroyed. Fortunately, large cut limestone blocks had another impor-tant function in Athens for many centuries: they were used for buildingmaterials. The Athenians simply recycled obsolete inscriptions by literallymaking them the building blocks of the city. The inscribed surfaces of ste-laicould be turned away from view or smoothed away, if need be. Recy-cled stelai were sometimes used in the construction of public and privatebuildings; the city’s fortifications from all periods and the Long Walls con-necting Athens and the Piraeus also contained recycled stone stelaithat hadonce displayed official polisrec ords. In fact, much of what is known todayabout Athenian law is the result of archaeological excavations of Athenianbuildings and defensive walls, whose building stones and foundations wereimpiety trials in a restored democracy223"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"discovered to be actually stelairecording decrees and laws of the Atheniandemos.This ancient publishing industry was part of the backbone of the Athe-nian democracy, and it must have employed a fair number of skilledcraftsmen and unskilled laborers. Workers toiled to quarry and transportthe stone; they prepared the blocks and carved the stone stelaifor publica-tion; they transcribed texts; and finally they cata logued and stored the lawsin the public archives. One tradition rec ords that Socrates was astoneworker in Athens. As noted above, Nicomachus, the man accused ofdistorting the laws in 399, was employed in the state- supported publishingindustry.Like Andocides’ trial on asebeiacharges, Nicomachus’s trial had a back-ground that stretched ten years into the past. Nicomachus’s first appoint-ment as one of the anagrapheisdated to 410. During the de cade whenNicomachus and the other magistrates were busy researching and publish-ing Athenian nomoi,Athens fell to Sparta, suffered a second oligarchiccoup, and enjoyed a second restoration of the democracy. During thereign of the Thirty, Nicomachus apparently joined other Athenian demo -crats in fleeing the city to avoid torture and assassination. When the re-stored democracy appointed a second committee, now called the nomo-thetai,Nicomachus returned from exile; he and the other nomothetaifulfilled their responsibility by returning to the state archives in theMetroön. They finished researching, or ga niz ing, and transcribing all therelevant laws. After they completed this task, wooden boards were perhapsplaced on display in the Athenian Agora for review before being inscribedon stone. As the provisional texts of the laws were approved by the people,the nomothetaisupervised the transcription of the final drafts, and the of-ficial texts were displayed in public or filed in the Metroön.Once they began reading and reviewing the newly drafted laws, someAthenian citizens became disgruntled. The laws as published did not al-ways accord with their memories of what the sacred laws had been beforethe first oligarchic coup of 411. A group of these dissatisfied individualsbanded together and accused Nicomachus of manipulating and pervertingthe ancestral laws. From an Athenian’s point of view, to deliberatelychange a law amounted to a type of impiety: asebeia.The accusers claimedthat rather than simply republishing the laws as they had always existed,Nicomachus had done some significant editing of the nomoiwithout theapproval of the demos.These Athenians charged Nicomachus with selec-tively transcribing the original decrees, leaving out some laws entirely andsocrates224"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"inserting others that the Assembly had never passed. In one instance theaccusers alleged that Nicomachus had made changes to the poliscalendar,adding some festivals to the official calendar of civic sacrifices. Increasingthe occasions for thysiawould place a greater financial burden on the polisand the wealthiest aristocrats, who by tradition were expected to performliturgies and help finance state- sponsored festivals for the gods.The prosecution argued that Nicomachus’s actions resulted in injury tothe state and to the demosas a whole. They claimed that Nicomachus con-sistently avoided the customary annual audit procedures in place, that heremained in his magistracy long after the initial appointed term, and thathe willfully and secretly altered the very laws he was supposed to be pre-serving. An additional assertion was that he was the illegitimate offspringof an Athenian woman and a male slave; if true, Nicomachus would noteven have been a citizen, and therefore would have been unqualified to in-terpret the ancestral laws of the Athenian people.As the nomothetaifinished restoring the ancestral laws and religious cus-toms, the Athenians themselves were reflecting on the mutual relationshipbetween the polisand expressions of public piety. They apparently felt thatprivate actions of individuals had the potential to do great harm to thestate, a belief reflected in the writings of the metic Lysias. The argumentsthat Lysias constructed for the trial of Nicomachus were based on an as-sumption that ancestral Athenian nomoilinked the individual citizen andthe po liti cal community. Nicomachus, some felt, had behaved impiouslywhile serving as one of the nomothetai.Recognizing the full scope of Nico-machus’s responsibilities to the demoscan also illumine some of the under-lying issues in the case of Andocides. Nicomachus and the other nomothetai were researching and transcribing the ancestral sacred laws concerning thepublic worship of the gods—ta patria— for the benefit of the demosin therestored Athenian democracy. Likewise Andocides made an effort to ob-serve ancestral nomoiconcerning the worship of Athena and Demeter afterhe returned from exile and started reintegrating himself into Athenian civicand cultic life.The allegations of impiety raised by the accusers in both cases rest inpart on the understanding that observing nomoienabled Athenians to main-tain the ancestral traditions of worshipping the gods, traditions that sup-ported the polisand its institutions. By charging Nicomachus with alteringancestral customs, ta patriaand patrioi nomoi,his opponents were claim-ing that he privately conspired with an anti- democratic faction to selec-tively edit some laws and elsewhere add laws and customs where none hadimpiety trials in a restored democracy225"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"existed before. They alleged that Nicomachus was acting in a subversiveand dangerous manner that was harmful to the whole demos.Similarly,Andocides had allegedly harmed the people through private religiousbehaviors that some of his fellow citizens interpreted as impious. Yet bothdefendants evidently demonstrated that they had been absent from Athensduring the reign of the oligarchs, which proved to the jury their loyaltyto the democracy. This was a strategy that Socrates could not employ inhis trial.the trial of socrates: ‘asebeia’ and inquiryFor centuries the trial and execution of Socrates have been consideredamong antiquity’s most infamous examples of injustice. Socrates was in-dicted and brought before a jury of his peers on a charge of impiety, justas Andocides and Nicomachus were accused of breaking laws and subvert-ing customs that lay at the heart of Athenian civic religion. When seen inthe context of these two other contemporary cases, Socrates’ trial becomesa piece of a larger puzzle; it can be viewed as one event in the larger patternof civic life immediately following the fall of Athens and the restoration ofdemocracy. Although the war with Sparta was over, the empire dissolved,and democracy restored, the Athenian demoscontinued to examine andreinterpret its recent collective experiences. The Athenians’ ongoing com-mitment to weave together civic rites and democracy, evident in the trialsof Andocides and Nicomachus, played out again with Socrates.Ancient sources unanimously report that Socrates was charged withthree counts of asebeia.The charges of corrupting the youth and intro-ducing new gods in Athens remain the most familiar today. The thirdcount of the impiety charge leveled against Socrates, metheous nomizein,is difficult to translate and understand from a twenty- first- century per-spective. There are several accepted ways of rendering this phrase intoEn glish, including “not believing in the gods,” “not recognizing (or hon-oring, acknowledging) the gods recognized (honored, acknowledged) bythe city.” The most common translation, “not believing in the gods,” tothe modern ear sounds like full- blown atheism, and some scholars in thenineteenth and twentieth centuries saw in Socrates a precursor to the ra-tional humanists of the Eu ro pe an Enlightenment. But personal faithhad little if any role in ancient Mediterranean religious systems prior toChristianity, and Socrates was no atheist— at least not in our modernsense of the word. After the war Athens rededicated itself to its ancestralsocrates226"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"customs, and Socrates was no stranger to ta patria,according to the re-ports of his contemporaries.The main obstacle to understanding and interpreting this phrase hingeson how to translate the verb nomizein.While it may be translated as “think,consider” or “believe,” nomizeinat its core is connected to the concept ofnomos,the Greek noun that covers the En glish words “law, legal decree,”and “custom, tradition.” The direct association with religious customs andritual conventions allows nomizeinto be rendered “practice, customarilyuse; observe custom.” Since nomizeincan mean adhering to the ancestralpractices of worshipping the gods, the positive formulation theous nomizeinwould describe the proper, publicly sanctioned practices that maintainedthe traditional worship of ancestral deities that supported the polis.Perhapsa better way for readers today to understand the third charge of impietyhinges on the shades of meaning that connect nomos/nomizeinto ancestrallaw and religious custom, so metheous nomizeincan be translated “not ob-serving the city’s laws and customs concerning the gods”—“not doing thecustomary things for the gods.”Ta patria, patrios politeia, nomoi,ancestral customs and laws— all wereupheld by the Athenian demosin the fifth and fourth centuries, and at thesame time these laws supported the polisand ensured the well- being of itscitizen residents. As evidenced in the trials of Nicomachus and Andocides,the Athenians were acutely sensitive to the demands of piety and the polisinthe years immediately following the restoration of democracy in 403. Athe-nian democracy was built on a foundation of reciprocal relationships be-tween law, civic life, and ancestral religious practices in the public sphere.The trial of Socrates is part of this pattern, and viewing his trial in the lightof the other two trials can reveal the Athenians’ priorities at this time.Our knowledge of Socrates, including the tradition of his trial and execu-tion, comes primarily from three contemporary sources: Aristophanes, Plato,and Xenophon. Aristophanes was a comic playwright who some twentyyears before the trial authored the Clouds,a comedy renowned for its par-ody of a phi los o pher named Socrates. Plato, the most famous of Socrates’followers, composed accounts of Socrates conversing with friends and acquaintances— these are the dialogues of Plato. In a similar vein Xenophon,an aristocratic career military man who was a friend of Socrates, wrote a fewSocratic dialogues and essays that have no pretensions to philosophy, con-taining instead more personal anecdotes and historical background.Plato probably wrote his Apolog yof Socrates in the mid- or late 390s, pos-sibly a few years after the actual defense in court, and Xenophon apparentlyimpiety trials in a restored democracy227"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"wrote his own Apolog yabout the same time. The title can sometimes mislead English- speaking readers; the Greek word apologiadoes not mean thatSocrates appeared before the jury to “apologize” for harms done in the pastand acknowledge accountability for his actions. Rather, an apologiais simplya defense speech delivered in court. Literary rec ords from antiquity recordthe names of additional early fourth- century authors who wrote about thistrial, but these accounts have not survived. Some of the works were report-edly full of praise for Socrates, but it is also clear that Socrates continued tohave detractors after his death. These detractors published highly criticalpamphlets and speeches about the phi los o pher and the potential dangersof his teachings. Polycrates’ Kategoria,or Accusation,was among the morefamous of these speeches critical of Socrates. One twentieth- century scholarcalled the Kategoriathe “literary sensation” of its day; Polycrates’ speech apparently reinforced a commonly held belief that Socrates was haughty, anti- democratic, and a slick rhetorician. It is even possible that this harsh Ac-cusationprompted the flurry of Apology writers— maybe even Plato himself.Unfortunately Polycrates’ speech is lost, and the best that scholars can do istentatively outline a reconstruction of the argument based on common fea-tures in the two defense speeches that have survived. What exactly Atheni-ans were discussing in the aftermath of Socrates’ trial and execution cannever be known, but for a certain time Athenian intellectuals did have a keeninterest in writing about Socrates, his teachings, and his trial.Socrates himself wrote nothing during his lifetime, and in importantways the accounts of Plato and Xenophon are at odds with each other.Taken together these facts have led to the so- called Socratic problem. Whowas Socrates, really, and what did he teach? Xenophon’s Memorabilia,acollection of anecdotes about Socrates— his life, his teachings, and his trial— offers significant background for scholars trying to reconstruct theprosecution’s frame of reference when addressing the jury in Socrates’case. But Socrates does not express the same penetrating philosophical in-sights in Xenophon that he does in Plato. Most of Plato’s twenty- eightphilosophical dialogues have survived intact, and Socrates is the centralcharacter in all but one of these dialogues. Yet even in that dialogue, theLaws,written at the end of a career that stretched over several de cades,Socrates’ presence is still palpable. The main speaker is called the Athe-nian Stranger, and the arguments and conversational style of this strangerbear a marked resemblance to Socrates’ arguments and style of discoursefound elsewhere in Plato. Did Plato throughout his lengthy career faith-fully represent the ideas of the historical Socrates, or did the character ofsocrates228"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Socrates over time become a mouthpiece for Plato’s own evolving views?Modern scholars are far from agreement, and classicists and phi los o phersstill debate the consistency and accuracy of Plato’s portrayal of Socrates.But even if Plato’s fictionalized dialogues do not always accurately recordSocrates’ own ideas, a real historical figure named Socrates did spend agood deal of his life talking with fellow Athenians in the public spaces ofthe city, and he was executed by the state for religious offences in 399.Four Platonic dialogues record the trial and execution of Socrates: theEuthyphro,the Apology,the Crito,and the Phaedo.The Apologyreads asthough it were a transcript of the actual defense speech Socrates gave inthe courtroom. The Critoand the Phaedoare both dialogues named afterAthenian men who, together with a few intimate friends, conversed withSocrates during his last days, when he was in prison awaiting execution.The Athenian state was at that time observing the Delia, an annual reli-gious festival for the hero Theseus. By custom all public executions werestayed until the festival’s completion. Polisofficials were expecting the re-turn of the ship with the Athenian embassy from Delos so that they couldarrange the final sacred pro cession to the Acropolis; a full month of unfore-seen weather delays and adverse winds forced the postponement of Socrates’execution until the embassy’s return (Crito43d, Phaedo58b; XenophonMemorabilia4.8.2). Even while awaiting death Socrates continued to talkwith Crito and other friends. Together they inquired into the concept ofthe laws in Athens, and what it meant to abide by the laws in a demo craticstate. The Phaedodepicts the execution itself, and it includes the movingfinal scene of Socrates’ courage and dignity when drinking the fatal cup ofhemlock.Plato set another Socratic dialogue, the Euthyphro,around the time ofSocrates’ trial. The Euthyphrodepicts the meeting between Socrates and anacquaintance, a fellow citizen named Euthyphro, at the Royal Stoa in theAgora. Euthyphro and Socrates were both to appear before the archfnbasileus,the magistrate who had jurisdiction in the Athenian judicial systemover cases involving serious religious infractions, including impiety andmurder. Euthyphro was going to the archfn basileusto charge his own fatherwith murder, while Socrates was going to take part in a pretrial hearing todetermine whether the indictment for asebeiaactually merited a full publictrial. When Euthyphro told Socrates the details of the impiety case againsthis father, who had killed a laborer, Socrates was prompted to engage Eu-thyphro in a long discussion about the very nature of piety and impiety. TheEuthyphrothus presents Socrates in public at the very start of a legal pro cessimpiety trials in a restored democracy229"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"engaging in critical inquiry about the worship of the gods. Questions aboutpious and impious actions clearly were on Socrates’ mind when he was onhis way to talk with the archon about his own indictment— or at least this iswhat Plato wished his readers to believe about his teacher. We do not knowwhat Socrates and the archfn basileussaid to each other that day. But we doknow the magistrate decided that Socrates’ impiety case should be broughtbefore a jury of 500 Athenians.As was true of the trials of Andocides and Nicomachus, the particulars ofthe asebeiacharge against Socrates implicitly referred to events from earlierde cades, events that continued to stir the Athenians’ passions even after thewar had ended. In Socrates’ defense speech, as reported by Plato, the olderman distanced himself from po liti cal life in Athens. But a close readingof available sources shows that Socrates had been visible in some arenas ofAthenian public life for many years. In fact some of Socrates’ students,friends, and acquaintances were the very men who shaped Athenian policythroughout the war, and Socrates himself was deeply engaged in the intel-lectual currents of the day. Although Plato’s Socrates did not boast about hisrole in politics and public life, he did acknowledge a predilection for cease-lessly inquiring into civic virtues that were valued in fifth- century Athens.Together with his discussions of power, knowledge, and rhetoric in the polis,Socrates also spoke openly about how he honored the gods, attended statefestivals, and participated in Athenian civic religion.Plato’s Apolog yshows Socrates making every effort to remove himselffrom the Greek intelligentsia. Indeed, Socrates opens the Apolog ywith arefutation of the accusers’ allegations that he was a clever speaker who in-vestigated the latest scientific theories. For an Athenian juror these claimsmay not have rung completely true. Socrates was publicly known to besomeone who had long enjoyed discussing new ideas, and in Athenianpop u lar culture he was associated with the foreign teacher Anaxagoras andothers like him. In Aristophanes’ Cloudsthe character named Socrates wasa phi los o pher who ran a school that taught young men newfangled ideasabout the sun and stars. This comedic, semi- fictional Socrates also trainedyouths in the latest slick techniques for making the weaker argument ap-pear the stronger. The Cloudswas performed at the City Dionysia in 423,almost twenty- five years before the trial.

These teachers cameto mainland Greece from Italy and Asia Minor. In the 440s, well before thePeloponnesian War broke out, Pericles personally supported foreign teacherswho visited Athens. Commonly known as “sophists,” these professionals vis-ited the major cities of the Greek- speaking world, where they taught fora fee. Being a sophist was virtually synonymous with travel in the ancientMediterranean. Traveling phi los o phers would settle for a few years in a city,lecture, take on new students, and in time go on to another cultural center.In one sense a sophist was a “sage,” and some of the traveling teacherssimply lectured on natural history, science, and mathematics. Some ofthem were also known by the Greek terms physiologoior physikoi,menwho studied natural phenomena. New astronomical theories proposingthat the sun was really not a god but a fiery rock in the heavens had beenintroduced into Athens by the Ionian phi los o pher Anaxagoras in the 440sand 430s. Anaxagoras was one of several teachers who originally camefrom the cosmopolitan Ionian Greek cities in the eastern Mediterranean.In the cities of Ephesos and Miletus, Greeks may well have been exposedto more advanced scientific knowledge from eastern centers of learning— Memphis in Egypt, Babylon and Persepolis in Persia. These Ionian naturalphi los o phers traveled around the Mediterranean, teaching as they went;Athens was one of many ports of call they would have frequented.Pericles was said to have befriended and supported Anaxagoras when hevisited Athens during the late 440s and 430s. But this support came at aprice for Pericles, whether his traditional- minded po liti cal rivals felt gen-uinely threatened by the new ideas or simply attacked him where they be-lieved he was weak. They charged Anaxagoras and others like him withimpiety. The details are scanty, but it seems that in the mid- 430s the Athe-nian Assembly passed a decree put forward by a citizen named Diopeithes.This decree may have provided the legal foundation for the eisangeliaim-peachment procedure for individuals who did not observe the city’s lawsand customs concerning the gods: tous ta theia menomizontas(PlutarchPericles32). Pericles’ foreign friend Anaxagoras was perhaps not the onlytarget of Diopeithes’ decree; later sources indicate that another travelingphi los o pher named Protagoras was allegedly tried in the 420s and hadhis books burned in public, and another tradition holds that Pericles’impiety trials in a restored democracy231"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" common- law wife Aspasia, who actively supported new ideas, was also indicted for asebeia.Nothing bad seems to have happened to Aspasia;Anaxagoras may have been found guilty but Pericles helped him leaveAthens safely, and Plato reports that Protagoras died with his reputationuntouched. Still, these are the first examples in the historical record of in-dividuals being charged with impiety and put on trial.We cannot be sure what Socrates did or did not believe about naturalphenomena. Xenophon’s Memorabiliadepicts Socrates suggesting that theinvestigation of the ultimate origins of cosmic phenomena was not a gooduse of a man’s time, especially when there were other more pressing moralquestions that needed to be explored (Xenophon Memorabilia4.7.5). Fol-lowing both Plato and Xenophon, scholars today surmise that most ofSocrates’ teaching was aimed at ethical issues, especially those sorts of eth-ical questions that would have had immediate and practical application forthe citizens of late fifth- century Athens. In Plato’s ApologySocrates spoketo the jury and reminded them that he was not connected with any of thenatural phi los o phers, despite what the character that had his name inAristophanes’ pop u lar play might have led them to believe about him.But the term “sophist” itself was not without controversy; over time itcame to mean “wise guy.” Such sophists were itinerant professionals withlittle interest in teaching ethics, scientific knowledge, or a method for appre-hending the truth. Rather, these experts excelled in the arts of speech mak-ing and rhetoric: they constructed arguments that would unfailingly per-suade an audience to follow the will of the speaker. Some sophists taughtways to make a weak argument appear stronger; others advocated the posi-tion “might is right.” There were sophists who became infamous for teach-ing impressionable and brash young men in Athens, many of whom camefrom the ranks of the Athenian aristocracy. Some of the leading public fig-ures in the law courts and assemblies of Athens had been trained by thesetraveling teachers in their youth, or were at least influenced by their meth-ods. Lysias, the metic who became a famous speechwriter, had connectionsto philosophical schools and sophists in southern Italy. Critias, the harshleader of the Thirty, wrote plays and other poems that reveal a genuine in-terest in late fifth- century intellectual movements connected with the newrhetoric; he is often counted as one of the sophists in Athens.Aristophanes’ Cloudsconflated the two kinds of sophists that Athenians were familiar with in the 420s, and Socrates had a hard time later dissociat-ing himself from the parody. The comedy depicted a character namedSocrates teaching young men both natural science and rhetoric. Thissocrates232"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Socrates instructed students to argue in such as way as to make the weakerargument appear the stronger. The comic Socrates ran a school of philoso-phy with the silly name “the Thinkaterium” (the Phrontisterion), and he ac-cepted as his student Pheidippides, the youthful son of a nearly bankruptAthenian citizen named Strepsiades. Strepsiades had lost much of hismoney in the war, suffering from its economic blockades and high prices,and had recently gone further into debt: he complained that his worthless,lazy son Pheidippides spent far too much time at the racetrack betting on horses and losing. Strepsiades hoped that at the Thinkaterium Pheidippideswould learn a new method of argument that would enable them to evadethe claims of creditors and debt collectors. Instead, the young Pheidippidesproved to be an impetuous student who concluded that Socrates was actu-ally teaching him to disrespect his father and all paternal authority figures.After attending Socrates’ lessons, Pheidippides beat up his father and thenfurther exercised his new intellectual freedom by burning down Socrates’Thinkaterium. The eccentric phi los o pher was still inside the school, and asthe play ended the audience could hear his screams offstage.Even when distorted through the lens of Dionysian satire, the Clouds’dark humor cannot entirely obscure what scholars assume was the typicalAthenian’s opinion of Socrates. Some Athenians apparently did believethat Socrates had a school— or that he was the sort of person who wouldlikely attract students. In fact there had been and still were several such in-formal “schools” in Athens. While some learned men taught natural phi-losophy, others claimed to teach virtue, or arete.These teachers assertedthey could— for a fee— train young men to become persuasive publicspeakers. The skills required to conduct oneself according to recognizedstandards of virtue and to persuade peers in law courts and the Assembly were highly valued in the ancient polis;consequently, these itinerant teach-ers maintained that they could teach men to be good citizens. Both groupsof men, those who taught science and those who taught arete, were com-monly called “sophists” in the fifth century.Although Socrates investigated the nature of aretewith his friends andacquaintances, he was keen to distance himself from sophists who taughtrhetoric. He asserted in the Apologythat he was not a clever speaker, anddid not take students or accept fees. He simply spent all his spare timein the public spaces of the city and talked one- on- one with anyone whohad the time and interest. He called himself a gadfly who had attachedhimself to the city and was constantly disturbing it (Apology30e). He didnot seek the attention or praise of the citizen body in the Assembly, and heimpiety trials in a restored democracy233"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"did not seek to persuade his peers to follow one par tic u lar policy over an-other. The Socrates shown in the dialogues of Plato did not usually discusscurrent events, but rather investigated the more abstract ethical principlesthat underlie all actions, whether in the public sphere or in private life.Indeed, the Platonic Socrates was known for his disavowal of public life.Several times in the Apolog ySocrates stated that he had never had any in-terest in pursuing politics. Assuming that he was at or near 70 at the timeof his trial in 399, Socrates was a mature man in his 40s at the start ofthe Peloponnesian War— the prime age for an articulate and ambitiousAthenian to take on leadership roles in the Assembly. He was near 40 atthe time of the great plague and the death of Pericles, and in his late 40sin 423, when Aristophanes lampooned him in the Clouds.Looking backeven further Socrates was born around 470, shortly after the Persian Wars— born to parents native to an Athens that had twice been evacuatedand sacked by the Persians. Tradition has it that Socrates was trained inthe craft of stonecutting; with Athens undergoing its most intense phasesof rebuilding and reconstruction in the 450s and 440s, he had many yearsto hone his skills. As a younger man Socrates witnessed the rise of Athensunder the leadership of Cimon and Pericles, and the prime of his life over-lapped with the entirety of the twenty- seven- year war with Sparta. He ex-perienced the brutal years of the second coup of 404 as an elder.In a coincidence of historical timing, the span of Socrates’ life corre-sponded with the rebuilding of the city, rise and fall of the Athenian em-pire, and the entire course of the Peloponnesian War. His complete ab-sence from Athenian public life would have been remarkable. And yet,according to Plato, Socrates maintained that he deliberately chose toavoid public life. In the Apolog ySocrates attributed this decision to thepresence of his daimonion,a personal, divine entity that he described asakin to a small voice that communicated to him privately (Apolog y31d).The daimoniondid not tell him explicitly what to do in a given situation.Rather, it somehow inhibited him from a planned course of action andquestioned him about his intentions— or better, the daimonionled Socrateshimself to examine his own intentions. It was the voice of this daimonionthat consistently guided him away from pursuing a life of public activity inAthenian politics. Instead of taking on a leadership role in the Assemblyand urging his fellow citizens to take one course of action over another,Socrates chose to engage citizens in conversation individually. In Plato’sdialogues Socrates was not pictured questioning his peers about recentvotes in the Assembly, the current course of the war, or the position ofsocrates234"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"demo crats and oligarchs. Rather, Plato depicted Socrates exploring moreabstract ethical issues such as justice, piety, love, and what constitutes agood life in the polis.While Socrates may have chosen not to assume a leading role in Athe-nian politics— he did not make himself Pericles’ heir, or model himself af-ter Cleon or Nicias or any of the other leaders of the Assembly and the military— it would be a mistake to think of him purely as a private citizenwho consistently shunned all involvement in the life of the city. The fact isthat Socrates was personally involved in the war, the polis,and the empirefrom the late 420s steadily through to the fall of Athens and the tyrannyof the Thirty. In many ways Socrates was an ideal demo cratic citizen. Heserved in the infantry; he took his turn on the Council, and in leading theAssembly while serving as one of the prytaneis— at a crucial time, as dis-cussed below. This is not to say that Socrates unfailingly supported empireand war, only that he was more involved in Athens than he initially ad-mitted in the defense speech preserved in Plato’s Apolog y.Three Platonic dialogues give accounts of Socrates’ ser vice in the in-fantry, where he served as a hoplite (Apolog y28e, Symposium 219c–221c,and Laches181b). The backbone of the Athenian army during the Pelo-ponnesian War was the heavily armed hoplite soldier. Adult citizens whocould afford to supply their own helmet, spear, shield, and greaves regis-tered for ser vice by deme and tribe; regular training was compulsory. InPlato’s dialogues Socrates mentioned that he had served in three separatecampaigns during the first de cade of the Peloponnesian War: at Potidaea,Amphipolis, and Delion. The Potidaea action in the northern Aegean an-ticipated the war (430–432); there Athenians besieged a city that had re-volted from the empire. The Amphipolis campaign was waged eight yearslater in the same region. The Athenian retreat and loss at Delion in 424happened closer to home, in a sanctuary of Apollo in nearby Boeotia. In allbattles Socrates acquired a reputation for steadfast courage and endurance.He rescued companions when they were wounded, and even the heavy win-ter snows in Potidaea did not bother him (Symposium220b).As a responsive and responsible citizen, Socrates later served on theCouncil. Ideally, every man in the demo cratic system would be selected bylot within his tribe to serve on the bouleat least once, and no more thantwice. Socrates served in this position when he was in his 60s, during 406/5.Each of the ten Cleisthenic tribes contributed fifty men to serve on theCouncil for the entire year, and each tribal committee of fifty was assigneda prytany (one- tenth of the year) during which they presided as executiveimpiety trials in a restored democracy235"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"officers over all polisbusiness. Socrates’ prytany happened to fall in the au-tumn that year— at the very time when the generals were on trial in the As-sembly following the naval victory at Arginusae (Apolog y32b; XenophonMemorabilia1.1.18). In fact, Socrates himself was presiding over the entireAthenian demosin the Assembly on the very day that Pericles (son of Peri-cles) and the other generals were tried and found guilty. While the Atheni-ans debated whether to try the generals as a group instead of individually asrequired by law, Socrates felt it was his duty to observe the established laws.In his role as epistates(chief of the prytaneis), he opposed the men whomade the motion, and he urged the demosnot to vote in support of it. Feel-ings were running so high, he reported in the Apolog y,that orators threat-ened to have him arrested right there at the Pnyx. He did not flinch, and al-though he feared imprisonment and death in that moment, he chose justiceand the rule of law over the passions of the people. The Assembly voted totry the generals as a group despite Socrates’ objections. That was, Socratessays in Plato’s Apolog y,his only experience with holding public office, but itwas a fateful day.But that was not the end of his experience with injustice and groups ofpowerful men. Just a few years later, he and four others were summonedby Thirty to the Tholos to take care of some state business. The Tholos,which had served as the headquarters for the prytaneiswhen Athens wasstill a democracy, had been taken over by the Thirty when they disbandedthe Council and the prytaneis.At the Tholos the Thirty ordered Socratesand the four others to go to the home of Leon of Salamis, and fetch himso that he could be executed. Leon had done nothing wrong, nor had hehad a trial; he was simply a wealthy and influential man who stood inthe way of the Thirty’s power. He was one of hundreds whom the Thirtyillegally arrested, and then either detained or killed. As Socrates put it inthe Apolog y,the Thirty wanted to implicate as many citizens as they couldin their illegal actions, so they drafted ordinary citizens like Socrates tocarry out their illicit commands. On this occasion Socrates refused to fol-low the Thirty’s orders. Socrates’ actions and words made clear that hewould not take part, and he walked out of the Tholos (Apolog y32c). Thefour others obeyed, and they departed for Salamis without Socrates.Socrates speculated in the Apolog ythat this act of defiance would havesoon cost him his life if the Thirty had not been removed from power.This situation in which Socrates and the four nameless men foundthemselves that night was precisely the type of thing the Amnesty of 403was aimed at. Those who remained in the city did not necessarily supportsocrates236"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"the reign of the Thirty, or any other oligarchy. Countless Athenians whodid not leave the city got caught up in the Thirty’s authoritarian regime,and not every citizen had the backbone and the commitment to justice exhibited by Socrates. The restoration of the democracy in 403 made al-lowances for these men, and unless it could be proven that they had per-sonally killed someone, they were not put on trial alongside the remainingmembers of the Thirty who survived the civil war.For many who were involved in Socrates’ trial, perhaps the most damn-ing, though indirect, evidence concerned his friends and associates overthe years. Although Socrates was not a wealthy man himself, or even thetype of person who sought social status, many aristocrats counted himas their friend and teacher. He dined with these men in their homes, andtalked with them in the Agora. Everyone in Athens knew who had beenassociated with Socrates over the years, and the list was long. Most no-tably, he counted among his friends men who had played a part in bothcoups, especially Critias and Charmides, both of whom were relatives ofPlato. Critias had a long history of being involved in powerful oligarchicfactions. He had been named by Diocleides in the Herms affair in 415 andimprisoned; the testimony of Andocides brought his release. Critias ea-gerly followed the visiting sophists in Athens, and wrote tragedies; he wasa close friend of Alcibiades and may have suggested Alcibiades’ recall in408. After a period of exile in Thessaly he returned to Athens. Critias’open admiration for Sparta may have helped him gain an appointment asone of the Thirty initially empowered by the Spartans. Charmides wasCritias’ nephew; he had also been named in the profanation of the Mys-teries in 415, and was later closely associated with the Thirty. Both menhad associated with Socrates, both were mentioned by Plato, and indeedPlato named two of his Socratic dialogues Charmidesand Critias.Bothmen were also killed in a battle in the Piraeus during the civil war of 403.Some of Socrates’ other friends had connections to oligarchic factions andthe hetaireiaithat were so influential in Athenian politics. Phaedrus, one ofthe men present at the drinking party at Agathon’s in 416 depicted in Plato’sSymposium,went into exile after being implicated in the profanation of theMysteries. A certain Adeimantus, a name known from Plato’s Republic,wasalso involved in profaning the Mysteries, and Eryximachus, another charac-ter in the Symposium,was named as a person involved in the mutilation ofthe Herms. But the most infamous of all of Socrates’ friends was Alcibiades.He had been an intimate friend of Socrates since he was a young man andfought alongside the older man at Plataea. Plato named a Socratic dialogueimpiety trials in a restored democracy237"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"after him, too, and he was also mentioned among those present in the Sym-posiumas well as the Protagoras.Socrates never openly criticized Alcibiadesin Plato’s dialogues, even after all of Alcibiades’ treasonous betrayals and allthe harm he did to Athens. In the SymposiumAlcibiades confessed to havingbeen in love with Socrates at one time. Although on one occasion theyshared the same couch and slept under the same cloak, Socrates showed nointerest in Alcibiades’ charms. A few months after the dramatic date for theparty at Agathon’s, Alcibiades left for Sicily; affairs in Athens then rapidlyunraveled, with Alcibiades at the very center of the turmoil. Socrates mayhave considered Alcibiades his most brilliant student, but in the end this didlittle good for the city of Athens.Each of the three trials in 399 in some way encapsulated the tensionsand conflicts of the past. Andocides’ trial bore witness to the demo crats’uneasiness with aristocrats and their informal hetaireiai;Nicomachus’strial recalled the struggles to reestablish the laws and the patrios politeia.Socrates’ defense speech dredged up everything for the Athenians, fromrevolting subject allies in the empire (Potidaea) to the most egregiousatrocities overseen by Critias. Socrates personally participated in the war -time desecration of Apollo’s sanctuary at Delion, and his friends profanedDemeter and mutilated the Herms. Socrates himself admired foreignteachers like Anaxagoras who understood the forces of nature in a radicalnew way, and at the same he time obeyed a private daimonionthat did notresemble any god of the pantheon recognized by all Athenians. Prosecu-tors at all three trials evoked the civic norms of eusebeiawhen they accusedthese three men of asebeia.If some jurors particularly despised Socratesbecause of his past connections to Alcibiades and Critias, they could masktheir hatred by decrying Socrates’ impiety.The fact that Socrates never left the city to join the demo crats in Boeotiaor the Piraeus during the Thirty’s reign did not help matters, either. If anyAthenians sought evidence for his anti- democratic stance they could look here. The terms of the reconciliation agreement did not work in Socrates’favor when he defended himself in court. The final blow came in the penaltyphase of his trial. Socrates was given one more chance to speak after thejury found him guilty— he could plead before the jurors and ask that he begiven a more lenient penalty than the one requested by the prosecutor. Butthat is not what he did. Instead of requesting a mitigation of the deathpenalty that Meletus had initially called for, he asked the assembled Athe-nians to grant him the honor that he truly deserved. He asked that he begiven free meals by the polisat the Prytaneion, as they did for Olympicsocrates238"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" victors, respected generals, and the descendants of the tyrant slayers Har-modius and Aristogeiton. Socrates spent his lifetime urging Athenians toinquire into what constituted the greatest good, and he claimed that he wasa great benefactor for the city, as great as any of the others who receivedhonors for their efforts to advance the public good. In a city where civicpiety and animal sacrifice brought po liti cal interests and the affairs of thegods into public dining rooms, there might be an ironic logic to Socrates’request.The request inspired outrage among many jurors and they voted for ex-ecution. In fact, it was reported that more voted to enforce the deathpenalty than had voted to find him guilty in the first place. After their de-cision Socrates was imprisoned while he awaited the return of the shipfrom Delos. When it finally did arrive he bravely drank the poisonoushemlock. With his last words, as recorded in the Phaedo’s death scene,Socrates instructed his friend Crito to make a sacrifice to the god Ascle-pius (118a). This god was a relative newcomer in Athens, having arrived inthe city from Epidaurus in 420 during a lull in the war following the Peaceof Nicias. As the son of Apollo, Asclepius was a healing god. Wishing tohonor this god was the last recorded act of an old man found guilty of civicimpiety.‘asebeia’ as po liti cal and religious actionThe year 399 turned out to be something quite extraordinary in Athens. Itwas a time for collective introspection among citizens who looked backover the past thirty years and examined the whole push for empire that thedemoshad supported. In their law courts Athenians become painfullyaware of all the poor decisions they had made and the civic conflicts theyhad become embroiled in— whether the affairs of the Herms and theMysteries, the first coup in 411/0, the total disregard for justice and estab-lished legal procedures in the trial of the Arginusae generals (406), or thefinal, disastrous reign of the Thirty in 404. All three trials in 399 recalledthese past events and the role of civic rites in Athenian public life, but thepresence of Socrates, more than Nicomachus or even Andocides, mayhave evoked the most intense feelings among the Athenians.By 399 Athenians could see what the push for empire had broughtthem. They had lost a war and thus lost their navy, their empire, and theirauthority in the Aegean; broken their own laws; ignored ancestral religiouscustom; and witnessed the unjust torture and the deaths of thousands ofimpiety trials in a restored democracy239"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"innocent citizens and foreign residents.

The fourthcentury was a time of relative stability for the demo cratic institutions thathad been put in place by Ephialtes and Pericles following the Persian Warsand then revived in 403. The Athenian demosduring the fourth centurycould take full advantage of the sanctuaries built during the period of empireunder Pericles: Athena’s monumental Acropolis and Demeter’s Eleusiniansanctuary. In the 330s Lycurgus added to Athens’ splendor by constructing apermanent stone theater in the urban sanctuary of Dionysus.

Athenians keptto their civic calendar of annual state- sponsored festivals. The Athenianyear started off in July with the Panathenaea and festivals for Zeus andAthena. Autumn was the season of Demeter, with the women’s Thes-mophoria and the celebration of the more egalitarian Eleusinian Mysteries,while autumn through spring was reserved for Dionysus— the Oschopho-ria and Anthesteria wine festivals in the late fall and spring, and the dra-matic festivals (the Lenaea and the Rural and the City Dionysia) in winterand spring. At each of these festivals, Athenians worshipped their ancestralgods and experienced themselves as a complex po liti cal community that in-cluded male citizens, foreigners, women, and slaves. Politics and religion were interdependent in the classical polis.In this respect Athenian democ-racy is quite alien from its modern form.Plato’s teacher Socrates was executed by the state in 399. Several de cadeslater, Plato’s student Aristotle stated that the human being is a po liti cal animal— a politikon zfon— a creature of the polis(Aristotle Politics1.2). TheGreek poliswas an autonomous entity composed of politeis(citizens) andother residents of both sexes and of varying status— female, slave, free, for-eign. While the poliswas autonomous, the people who lived in it were not,or at least not completely so. The citizens and residents of Athens were allsocial beings who needed community to live fully. As Aristotle put it, theyneeded the polis.But human beings were also creatures— the zfonof Aris-totle’s “po liti cal animal”— and as such they also needed the natural worldand its abundant resources to live full lives.Po liti cal life and religious life were fully integrated in fifth- centuryAthens. Traditional practices, nomoi,set up a complex set of interfacesthat facilitated communication in three separate but related areas: betweenthe individual and his or her ancestors, between the individual and the on-going social and po liti cal world of the polis,and between the individualand the natural environment that every human being inhabited. Atheni-ans did not worship the forces of nature or the agricultural produce thatthe land provided. They worshipped by means of that natural world. Thefertility of the countryside generated the meat, olives, grains, grapes, andother products dedicated to the gods and consumed by humans at civicfestivals. The yearly agricultural rhythms placed a predictable structure onthe collective experience of those who lived in Attica and Athens.

The gods were present when all the parts inthe complex set of interfaces functioned as they should.Athenians did not have the financial resources after 399 to build the sortof grand public buildings that they had constructed in the past. In the mid- fifth century Cimon had access to funds from the spoils of a war he wagedin the eastern Aegean, and Pericles’ building program had relied on thetribute of subject- allies in the Athenian empire. Those sources of wealth were gone forever, once Sparta defeated Athens and ordered the Atheniansto tear down their defensive walls and relinquish their naval empire. Butone notable building project was carried out soon after the restoration ofthe democracy in 403: the construction of the Pompeion in the Kerameikosdistrict.Just beyond the Agora to the northwest were two of Athens’ most im-portant gates in the city walls: the Sacred Gates and the Dipylon Gates.Today you can visit the small park in the Kerameikos and see the Themis-toclean walls constructed in the first half of the fifth century. The wallstake a somewhat irregular course in that stretch, and in the odd- shapedspace between the two gates the Athenians built the Pompeion. The build-ing stood just inside the walls; outside was the Kerameikos cemetery,where fallen soldiers and the ancestors of Athenians were memorializedwith tombs and elegantly sculpted grave stelai.Outside the walls two roadsran through the cemetery and into the countryside: one road led north tothe Academy, the suburb where Plato would set up his school later in thefourth century, and the other, called the Sacred Way, was the road traveledby Demeter’s initiates on their way to Eleusis every fall.When Athenians voted to construct a public building called a Pompeionaround the year 399, they were once again committing themselves to theirpatrios politeiaand ancestral civic rites. This area in the Kerameikos had always been used on the days of major festivals— the Panathenaea, theEleusinian Mysteries, the Anthesteria, and the City Dionysia. This place atthe gates was where the city met the countryside; it was the physical andsymbolic point of contact between the citizens and their natural environ-ment. Here civic magistrates marshaled those marching in the pompai(pro -cessions). Participants young and old gathered together, expressed their piety(eusebeia) in the presence of the ancestors buried in the Kerameikos, and"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"lined up at the Pompeion. The area around the Pompeion was also the meet-ing place where city dwellers mingled with herders who arrived from ruralpastures leading the cows, sheep, and goats that would join in the pro cessionand be sacrificed at the city’s altars. A long portico fronted the building, andinside a large courtyard was surrounded by dining rooms where citizenscould recline later in the day and feast on the sacrificial meat distributed inthe Kerameikos.The Pompeion’s façade was obviously asymmetrical, a design a little un-usual for an Athenian public building constructed at this time: from theperspective of someone facing the building, the main doorway was offsettoward the right. Archaeologists note that by placing the door so far off- center, ancient architects were guiding the steps of Athenians directly ontothe Panathenaic Way and toward the Agora.

Thucydides, books 1 and 2, narrates the period between the PersianWars and the Peloponnesian War and the first two years of fighting. Plutarch Per-iclespreserves some important anecdotes on this period. A fourth- century Atticinscription recording the Oath of Plataea is found in Fornara 57. The sources forthe Oath of Plataea are late, preserved by this inscription and the fourth- centuryorator Lycurgus. Some modern historians doubt its authenticity and believe itmay be a fourth- century Athenian invention.secondaryThis narrative of the Persian Wars, the rise of the Athenian empire, and the run- up to the Peloponnesian War is intended only to highlight episodes thathave notable connections to religious practices. For more comprehensive ac-counts see Kagan 2003. Bury and Meiggs 1975 is still the standard handbook;Samons 2007, with Lendon’s contribution, is more engaging and thoughtful.Osborne 2000, with Kallet’s essay, also offers a straightforward and accessiblenarrative of the war and its causes. For a thoughtful modern study of Thucy-dides, see Connor 1984. Kagan 1991, a readable and informative biography ofPericles, includes background on Athenian history and culture. This chapter’saccount of the role of the Pythia relies most on Maurizio 1995. Fornara and Samons 1991 remains the most critical treatment of the sources and the scholar-ship. Patterson’s groundbreaking 1981 study on the Periclean citizenship lawsis still worth reading, and Blok 2005 takes her arguments about women and cit-izenship even further. Henry 1995 is the most current study of the traditionssurrounding Pericles’ companion, Aspasia. Hansen 1991 clearly outlines the mech-anisms of democracy under Pericles. Ober 1996, 1998, and 2005 contain interest-ing essays on Athens and politics, while Rhodes 2003a offers an sharp contrastto Ober’s perspective.

Nuss-baum 1986 remains essential for considering Socrates, his philosophy, and hisrelationship to Plato. Vlastos 1994 (a revision of a paper originally published in1983) also offers valuable insights into the historical Socrates and how he mayhave differed from the Socrates written about by subsequent generations ofGreek writers, but Vlastos does not give due consideration to cultic norms.McPherran 1996 is a detailed, though somewhat limited, study of religion andSocrates; Parker 1996, chapter 10, is stronger on this score.
