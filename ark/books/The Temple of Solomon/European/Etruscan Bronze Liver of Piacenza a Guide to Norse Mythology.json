Land inhabited by deities is on the left, that of giants on the right. On the left, Freyja with golden hair occupies the hub of a six-spoked wheel, labeled ' Honey ' s family'. On the right, the face staring at the viewer is that ofthe giant Yrnir, whose body parts were assembled to make Island Earth. Compare the shape ofthe liver with the real Island Earth in southwest Finland, when relative sea level was 45m higher. (below, rotated 45° to orient Alfheim east and Vanheim west). The total island is the world tree Y ggdrasil, whose trunk at the lower right connects to the mainland. Through the center of the island snakes S-shaped Elivagar that separated Asgard from Jotunheim, the land of giants. The island resembles the rooster Gullinkambi, with head, eye, feet, wings and feathers . The southem part of the island comprises the upper jaw of Fenrir the wolf, protector of Helgard, with the hand of Tyr caught in his throat.

Based on the form ofletter M, the liver dates to the second century Be. How it got lost in this field remains a mystery.

On the lid of a funerary um in Volterra from the first century BC, now in the Guamacci Museum, the deceased Aule Lecu, son of Laris, holds a similar liver in his left hand, whose signs he interprets. The sculptor tumed the liver around so the viewer could read it. Although it resembles a sheep's liver and gall bladder, the front side adds two geometrie protrusions sUITOlmded by geometrie compartrnents, each with an inscription. The Midgard Serpent, drawn as a ribbon around the perimeter, divides into 16 unequal regions, each labeled with an inscription. The overall design resembles a Baby lonian liver circa 1900 BC in the British Museum, but which lacks the ribbon around the outside. Drawing of the inscriptions Patrick Hunt of Stanford University Liver Clinic published an accurate drawing of the front side inscriptions (likely drawn by Adriano Maggiani in 2005).

Honey was a kenning of Freyja, based on the color of her hair. Her people would incIude all those living on Island Earth. The shape of the liver resembles Island Earth, separated into two halves by a shallow channel named Elivagar, with Asgard on the left and Frost Giants on the right. Freyja not only led the assembly at Asgard, but was the foremost astronomer of her day. She devised a calendar that most of the world still uses: 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, 4 weeks in a month, 13 months in a year. She named each day of the week after her farnily, with herself as Sunday (see below). With Mimir and others from the assembly at Asgard, Freyja revised the Old European alphabet to make each letter look like a recognizable object whose name begins with the sound of the letter. Her revised alphabet survives as Linear A in Minoan Crete. Once others understood the concept, they created new alphabets throughout the world. Freyj a was a famous Vala, a prophetess or seer. Parents might hire her to foretell the future of their newbom child. When she arrived in Asgard she taught Oöin the magic of seither, the practice of divination, by entering a trance state. This liver combines her skills in astronomy, divination and writing. Its language and imagery is so original that Bragi the bard likely partici pated. Perimeter inscriptions of the bronze liver Around the perimieter in houses 1 through 16, the inscriptions have a certain commonality: Each inscription is a complete sentence. Reading proceeds cIockwise, shown by House 8..that borrows its subject from the last letter of House 7. Also, a cIockwise sequence fits an implied seasonality: 13 freeze - winter 1 plough -early spring 5 marriage - early summer 7 prepare honey - mid summer Each sentence contains kennings oftwo or more people. The same person often appears in adjacent houses. Every name corresponds to Norse mythology, whose deeds are preserved in the sagas ofIceland. What follows is a quick review of some principal characters of the bronze liv er, followed by a table of characters. Principal people from Norse mythology ME, from me'en meaning 'honey', is Freyja, who like her brother Frey had golden hair. Her name may come from vir 'e yjae meaning ' speak noble verse'. Friday, her day in the calendar, Page 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Stuart Harris was originally Sunday. Freyja outlived her companions and became the mother goddess of Europe. An exceptionally talented astronomer, she created the model for our present calendar of twenty-four hours in a day, seven days in a week, four weeks in a month, thirteen months in a year. Each day of the week was named after her farnily, with herself as Sunday. With Mimir and others, she modified the Old European alphabet to make it easier to leam by shaping each letter into a recogrUzable object, a script called Minoan Linear A. With her spear maidens, Freyja collected half the souls of those fallen in battle, the other half going to Ooin. Freyja married Svipdag-Oor, the sword hero, and their son Asmundur became ruler ofthe Northern Kingdom. PU, from puu meaning 'tree', is Njöro, Freyja's father, pronounced north, who figures prominently in houses eight through fourteen. Line 5 refers to North Pole. His name may come from nuorta meaning 'youth'. The Norse name for the pole ofEarth was Yggdrasil, the revolving a\"is tree. 1 The strange name Y ggdrasil is a composite from Iku Uro Ask Yli meaning'Eternal ash above Uro', where Uro is pronounced earth2 Yggdrasil's symbol is a verticalline (a\"is) crossed by three horizontallines (planes). The names ofthe three planes are Heaven, Earth and Hell. In Norse these four are written Yggdrasil, Hifmn, Uro, Hellä, whose abbreviation YHUH = YHVH = the Tetragammon of Biblical fame. Thus Hebrew preserves a sirnilar cosmology. PO, frompo meaning 'son', is Ooin, who figures prominently in houses one through seven. Po I Votan I Ooin headed the clan of Aesir on Island Earth. After erecting a palisade around the city, its name changed to Asgard, from Ahjs Kartano meaning 'Metal Manor'. Ooin may be a title that means 'master of the assembly', from asian meaning 'assembly, thing'. Ooin was the son of Bor, from Pori meaning 'domesticated reindeer', and Besla, from Pe 'e sula meaning 'friendly farnily'. Ooin had two brothers: LöOur-Ve, headed the clan ofVanir Hönir-Vili, headed the clan of Alfar Ooin had three principal wives: Jöro (pronounced earth), mother ofThor; Frigg, mother ofBalder and Höder, who raised Thor GunnlöO, mother ofBragi. ., VE, Ve'e, from ve 'en meaning 'water', is Ve-Vei-Loour, Ooin's brother, from lohtu meaning 'cornfort'. Ve headed the clan of Vanir and the corrununity of Vanheim., from van heimo meaning 'water farnily '. During the revolt of the gods, Ve-L60ur took corrunand away from his other brother Vili-Hoenir, who was sympathetic to Ooin. A-RA, from aura meaning ' plough', was Jöro (pronounced earth), first ruler ofthe assembly at Aesir, who gave her name to Island Earth. She was the first ruler of the assembly at Asgard, and figures prominently in houses one to three. I Spanisb preserves the same double meaning, palo = pole, tree. 2 Völuspa describes Y ggdrasil. Translation Jean I. Young, 1954 I know an asb-tree known as Y ggdrasil, tall tree and sacred besprent witb white clay, thence come the dews that fall in the dales; it stands ever green over Urö's spring.

Frisian history records that Freyja designed the yearly calendar that most of the world still employs: 24 hours in a day, seven days in a week, four weeks in a month, thirteen months in a year. '. The seven days of the week carried names from Freyja's immediate family, preserved in the design of Middelburg in Friesland, as names of seven streets that radiate from the center3 In 2000 BC, Middelburg was a palisaded fortress called Valhallagara, where women trained to become burgmaids.4 Many ofthe radiating street names end with -paart meaning 'gate' because each street went through one of seven gates around the city, a gate for each day of the week. The names are Norse. Sunday = Sint Joris < Syn Njöro Dis 'Fair Njöro Maid', Freyja Monday = Suiker < Sviker 'Swede', Freyja's husband Svipdag Tuesday = Nieuw < Niu 'Nine' , Freyja' s nine Valkyren Wednesday = Stroo < Star ' High [One]', Freyja's uncle 60in 3 Oera Linda Boek states that the gates of Valhallagara were named after the seven days of tbe week, an observation that proves its authenticity. 4 So many artifacts from far older times have been found in the vicinity that the city might weil date to about 5300 Be.

Crenellated moats and stone walls were constructed in the Middle Ages. Five of the original seven palisaded walls remain as straight streets of equal length. At the junction of each of seven palisaded walls was an eight-sided tower that guarded a gate and road through the palisade, whose locations survive as seven small lots. Upon leaving the palisade, all seven roads took a bent shape called ' running legs' that means time moving forward. Within the palisade a two­story octagonal building surrounded a central market. Each side housed one shift of guards, for a total of eight shifts of three hours each that made a day. At the very center, three roads with running legs intersect beside a surveying stone. Thus the city plan is that of a weekly calendar! The concept is so original that few other than Freyja could have conceived it. ~.......,.........
