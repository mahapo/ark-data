In August 1992Paul Mirecki and Marvin Meyer invited a series of colleagues from avariety of disciplines to an international conference, held at the Uni-versity of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, on “Magic in the AncientWorld.” The scholars in attendance all addressed the phenomena ofancient magic and ritual power from the perspectives of their owndisciplines, but they did so with a particular concern for the generalissues of definition and taxonomy. From that conference thereemerged a volume, edited by Meyer and Mirecki and published in1995 by Brill, entitled Ancient Magic and Ritual Power. As noted in theintroduction to the volume, “An understanding of ‘magic’ as ‘ritualpower’ ... permeates many of the essays in this volume” (4).The present volume comes from a similar scholarly conference. InAugust 1998 Meyer and Mirecki assembled the magoi once again—many of them the usual suspects—at a second international confer-ence, held at Chapman University in Orange, California, and theInstitute for Antiquity and Christianity of Claremont Graduate Uni-versity in Claremont, California, on “Magic in the Ancient World.”(This conference was made possible through the generous support ofthe Griset Lectureship Fund and the Wang-Fradkin Professorship ofChapman University and the Coptic Magical Texts Project of theInstitute for Antiquity and Christianity.) As at the Kansas conference,Jonathan Z. Smith delivered a plenary lecture, and the scholars at theCalifornia conference similarly employed the methods and perspec-tives of their disciplines to discuss ancient magic and ritual power.And as at the Kansas conference, the volume emerging from theconference, Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World, seeks to contribute tothe continuing discussion of magic and ritual power in the ancientNear East, Judaism, Greco-Roman antiquity, and early Christianity,with an additional contribution on the world of Coptic and IslamicEgypt.The strength of the present volume, we suggest, lies in the breadthof scholarship represented. While, as in the previous volume, issues ofdescription and classification are everywhere apparent or assumed inthese essays (and especially in Part 2), and the understanding of magic"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"as ritual power runs as a scholarly thread through the book, the essaysthemselves are remarkably wide-ranging in their approaches and con-cerns. Taken together, the essays thus provide an excellent glimpse ofthe status quaestionis of the study of magic and ritual power in Mediter-ranean and Near Eastern antiquity and late antiquity.* * *The essays in this volume are organized into six sections: 1) “NewTexts of Magic and Ritual Power,” 2) “Definitions and Theory,” 3)“The Ancient Near East,” 4) “Judaism,” 5) “Greek and Roman An-tiquity,” and 6) “Early Christianity and Islam.”Part 1 presents four essays in which new magical texts and newinterpretations are made available. In an essay entitled “A NewMagical Formulary,” William Brashear and Roy Kotansky presentthe editio princeps of P. Berol. 17202. This fourth-century papyrus sheetfrom a magical handbook preserves six recipes in Greek: a Christianliturgical exorcism with historiolae focusing on Jesus’ miracles, a paganinvocation to silence opponents, a hymnic invocation, an adjurationwith ritual procedures, a spell to achieve an erection, and a sacredstele termed the “second.” In “Two Papyri with Formulae for Divina-tion,” David Jordan improves upon two previously published papyriwith formulae for divination (PGM XXIVa and LXXVII). The firstinvolves a ritual with 29 palm leaves, each with the name of a godwritten upon it, and the other involves instructions for receiving anoracle through an invocation. In “An Early Christian Gold Lamellafor Headache,” Roy Kotansky presents the editio princeps of a Greektext from a private collection in London. This second-century lamellamay derive from a Hellenistic Jewish milieu that appropriated Jesus’name for its magical purposes, or from an early type of Jewish-Chris-tianity. The text apparently dates from a time when magical texts hadnot yet been “commercialized” to the extent that can be observedwhen later formulaic language replaced the more independent styleof amulet composition. In “A Seventh-Century Coptic Limestone inthe Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Bodl. Coptic inscr. 426),” PaulMirecki presents the editio princeps of a series of short texts written ona large Coptic limestone. The titles and incipits of the four gospelsand a list of the apostles’ names often occur together in Christianmagical texts, suggesting a context of ritual power for these texts andeven for the limestone itself. The wide-ranging possibilities for thestone’s function suggest either that it was a scribe’s display copy forschool texts or for the writing of amulets, or else that it was a monas-tic boundary stone with inspirational or apotropaic words of power."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Part 2 presents five essays that address explicitly theoretical mat-ters of definition and description. In “Great Scott! Thought and Ac-tion One More Time,” Jonathan Z. Smith opens his essay with adiscussion of the origin and meaning of the popular thaumatic ejacu-lation “Great Scott!,” which serves as an entree into the scholarlydebate on the definition of magic as a phenomenon that is eitherprimarily “thought (belief)” or “action (ritual).” Smith concludes witha plea for a theoretical resolution to this question of duality. In“Theories of Magic in Antiquity,” Fritz Graf responds to R. A.Markus’ study on pre-Augustinian theories about magic and Augus-tine’s own neglected semiotic theory. Graf demonstrates that therewere several different pre-Augustinian theories of magic in bothGreek and Roman thinking, and that Augustine’s theory was not asneglected as Markus supposes. Graf offers suggestions on how theresults of his study are useful for the further history of theoreticalreflections on magic. In “The Poetics of the Magical Charm: AnEssay on the Power of Words,” Henk Versnel addresses poetics in thedouble sense of “the art of making poetry and the art of creation.”Through a careful exegesis of several texts, Versnel demonstrates thatthe magical charm is the product of a happy alliance between theexpectancy of a marvelous potential in an “other world,” beyond theboundaries of space and time, and oral utterance, which can belongto common communication or can even transcend speech and helpcreate the “other world.” In “Dynamics of Ritual Expertise in Antiq-uity and Beyond: Towards a New Taxonomy of ‘Magicians,’” DavidFrankfurter offers a cross-cultural analysis of what he calls “the dy-namics of ritual expertise,” in the service of constructing a spatial(center/periphery) model for understanding indigenous conceptionsof ritual expertise. This model, which allows for a certain fluidityamong types, engages current discussions of taxonomy in the historyof religions (definitions of “magic” and “magicians”) beyond the staticclassifications of M. Weber and G. Van der Leeuw. In “Fiat Magia,”Christopher A. Hoffman begins with E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s observa-tion that all labels (such as the term “magic”) are essentially arbitrary,and proceeds to survey some of the major approaches andtaxonomies in the modern history of the study of magic. Hoffmanends by noting that the approaches he surveys have been valuable inhelping scholars move away from the essentially negative evaluationof magic that once dominated the field.Part 3 presents four essays on magic and ritual among ancientMesopotamians, Hittites, Canaanites, and Israelites. In “Dividing aGod,” Richard H. Beal examines Hittite terms and rituals used inpriestly instructions for “dividing a deity.” Hittite ritual specialists"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"were able to create two separate cult centers for the same deity byperforming specific rituals that caused the deity to divide itself. Then,through a pattern of rituals of considerable interest to scholars ofmagic and ritual power, the allomorph was coaxed into moving to thenew cult center. In “Translating Transfers in Ancient Mesopotamia,”JoAnn Scurlock applies to ancient Mesopotamian studies the classicanalysis of modern Moroccan ritual and belief by E. Westermarck.Scurlock identifies and analyzes Mesopotamian rituals and beliefsconcerning “transferal,” in which a concrete or abstract quality, suchas a disease, is transferred out of an afflicted person, animal, or objectinto another person, animal, or object. She identifies a striking con-gruence between ritual and belief in ancient and modern religions. In“Necromancy, Fertility and the Dark Earth: The Use of Ritual Pits inHittite Cult,” Billie Jean Collins analyzes Hittite texts concerningritual pits and the sacrifice of pigs to the supreme underworld deity.Collins shows that previously separate porcine associations of fertilityand purification/offering were combined to generate a ritual koine inwhich fertility became chthonian by virtue of its symbolic associationwith the pig and the ambiguity inherent in the term “earth” (fertilesoil and underworld). In “Canaanite Magic Versus Israelite Religion:Deuteronomy 18 and the Taxonomy of Taboo,” Brian B. Schmidtproposes that the prevailing interpretive mode, which avers that an-cient Israel syncretistically adopted Canaanite magic, finds only par-tial justification in isolated biblical traditions. Schmidt argues that theHebrew Bible, taken as a whole, hardly yields a unified portrayal ofwhat constitutes magic over against religion, let alone how one is todistinguish ancient Canaanites from ancient Israelites.Part 4 presents three essays on aspects of magic within Judaism. In“Secrecy and Magic, Publicity and Torah: Unpacking a TalmudicTale,” S. Daniel Breslauer investigates the rejection of magic in theTalmudic tractate Sanhedrin and seeks to understand the type ofJudaism contrasted with magic. Breslauer focuses on the ideas ofRabbi Aqiva and the story of his martyrdom, and the approach tomagic by Aqiva that later dominates the Talmudic approach.Breslauer suggests that the Talmud, through its narrative of Aqiva’sdeath, teaches that magic is a process and an attitude, not a particularaction, that the difference between magic and liturgy lies not in whatit accomplishes but in its public display, and that magic is antitheticalto Judaism because the Jewish mission is one of public proclamationrather than secretive ritual. In “Shamanic Initiatory Death and Res-urrection in the Hekhalot Literature,” James R. Davila explores anaspect of the Hekhalot tradition of the shamanic vocation of the“descenders to the chariot”: an experience of initiatory disintegration"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"and reintegration that establishes the shaman’s supernatural power.Those who “descend to the chariot” in their quest to gaze directly atGod face great dangers, specifically personal disintegration that burnsand rends its victims; but worthy mortals like Enoch and Rabbi Aqiva(Akiva) are transformed rather than destroyed. This is an experiencestrikingly similar to that of shamans who undergo a personal destruc-tion and resurrection in order to function in the supernatural world.In “Sacrificial Themes in Jewish Magic,” Michael D. Swartz discusseshow the image of the ancient sacrificial cult influenced the literatureof Jewish magic. Both magic and sacrifice deal with physical aspectsof religion, and each is concerned with dispelling the demonic andattracting the divine. The two elements that make a ritual specificallymagical in its appropriation of the Temple ritual are the power of thedivine name and the means by which the ritual makes an exclusivecult available to all who possess its secrets. Both elements entail a shiftin focus from the collective concerns of the Temple cult to the con-cerns of the individual.Part 5 presents five essays on magical texts and practices in Greco-Roman antiquity. In “The Ethnic Origins of a Roman-EraPhiltrokatadesmos (PGM IV 296-434),” Christopher A. Faraone recon-siders arguments for the Egyptian origin of a Roman-eraphiltrokatadesmos found in a PGM text (with five other attestations).Faraone argues, primarily against Robert Ritner’s analysis, that thisphiltrokatadesmos in fact derived not from Egyptian models and tradi-tions, but rather is an amalgam of two originally separate Greek andSemitic practices that entered Roman Egypt, when it accommodatedlocal practices by acquiring Egyptian features. In “Sacrifice in theGreek Magical Papyri,” Sarah Iles Johnston examines a neglectedarea of research, the roles that sacrifice played in magical rituals.Focusing on three spells found in PGM IV, Johnston argues that thepractitioner of sacrifice innovated within standard patterns, neitherignoring traditional rituals nor reversing or corrupting them. Such apractitioner was a “creative conservator” of traditional rituals, whoused expert knowledge to extend sacrificial rituals while preservingtheir underlying ideologies. In “Beans, Fleawort, and the Blood of aHamadryas Baboon: Recipe Ingredients in Greco-Roman MagicalMaterials,” Lynn R. LiDonnici examines the four types of substancesused in recipes within the PGM and focuses on the fourth type, whichconsists of exotic substances with no ordinary roles in temple life ordomestic shrines, and which may or may not have any actual phar-macological effects. A primary concern of scholars has been the iden-tification of these substances. LiDonnici suggests that synonyms anddescriptions of these substances in the PGM are not a license for"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"substitution with other more normal materials, and that commonplants cannot be assumed to lie behind rare and unusual substancesrequired in the PGM handbooks. In “The Witches’ Thessaly,” OliverPhillips focuses on the ancient Greek reputation for sorcery in thegeographical region of Thessaly. Phillips investigates primary textsindicating this reputation for sorcery and, at the end of his analysis,suggests that the popular legend of Medea is the primary source,associating her with the Thessalian port of Iolcus. In “Speech Actsand the Stakes of Hellenism in Late Antiquity,” Peter T. Struck ar-gues that in order to understand Iamblichus’ work de Mysteriis, whichadvocates the practice of mysterious sacred rites to achieve spiritualascent in contrast to the strategies of pure contemplation extendingfrom Plato to Plotinus, scholars must be attentive to two entangledvisions: magic and Eastern foreigners. Struck analyzes the debatebetween Iamblichus (irrational, magic, foreign languages) and Por-phyry (rational, contemplation, Greek language), and demonstratesthat both thinkers agreed on the terms of the dichotomy, though theyvalued them in different ways.Part 6 presents three essays on magic and ritual power in earlyChristianity and Islam. In “The Prayer of Mary Who DissolvesChains in Coptic Magic and Religion,” Marvin Meyer discusses sev-eral texts, especially P. Heid. Inv. Kopt. 685, featuring the VirginMary offering a prayer of power in order to provide release frombondage. Meyer provides an overview of the larger setting of theprayer of Mary, and illustrates how the prayer of Mary and rituals ofliberation from bondage also function within the context of theCoptic church. This raises the question of whether the magical Maryof texts of ritual power may be distinguished from the miraculousMary of the Coptic church. Or, as Meyer puts it, “Mary still is incontrol of the chains, but the question remains, who is in control ofMary?” In “The Magician and the Heretic: The Case of SimonMagus,” Ayse Tuzlak studies the figure of Simon Magus in the lightof differing early Christian portrayals of him as a heretic and as amagician, with a view to understanding the way some early Chris-tians understood the terms “magic” and “magician.” In “AncientExecration Magic in Coptic and Islamic Egypt,” Nicole B. Hanseninvestigates the extent to which the folklore of modern Egypt can betraced back to pharaonic times. Taking as a point of departureRitner’s observation that ancient Egyptian execration praxis re-mained virtually unchanged for 4000 years, Hansen demonstrates thecontinuity of the mechanics of execration practice in Egypt in latertimes. In this way she shows that the ancient religious beliefs andpractices have been recast by practitioners of magic in terms of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"two religions dominant in Egypt in later times: Coptic Christianityand Islam.The Index of Primary Sources at the conclusion of the volume hasbeen prepared by Linden Youngquist.* * *Among the essays in Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World is thepapyrological presentation of the Greek text from Berlin, P. Berol.17202. Our late colleague William M. Brashear presented the text atthe California magic conference, and Roy Kotansky completed thework on the essay after Bill’s untimely death. This essay is placed atthe beginning of the volume in order to give prominence to this studyin particular and to Bill’s papyrological work in general. Bill Brashearwas educated at Oberlin College, the Freie Universität in Berlin, andthe University of Michigan, from which institution he received hisPh.D. in Classics. Bill was a long-term staff member of the Ägypti-sches Museum in Berlin where he was keeper of Greek Papyri from1979 until his untimely death, and he lectured throughout Europe,North America, and the People’s Republic of China. His brilliantpapyrological contributions are well known. We need only recall hisbibliographical essay, “The Greek Magical Papyri: an Introductionand Survey; Annotated Bibliography (1928-1994) [Indices in vol. II18.6],” his edition of A Mithraic Catechism from Egypt, and his mostrecent book, Wednesday’s Child is Full of Woe, in order to appreciate hisknowledge, his control of scholarly information, and his papyrologicalexactness and creativity. In February 2000 Bill died, after battlingillness for a period of time. We miss him very much, both personallyand professionally. With sadness at his passing and appreciation forhis life and thought, we dedicate this volume to Bill."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Selected BibliographyAnkarloo, Bengt, and Stuart Clark, eds.

Side Amay indeed precede side B, as B appears to end in line 36 in a list ofmagical letters (xarakt∞rew). Although such characters often concludemagical texts, barring any further evidence this alone cannot serve toestablish the priority of one side over the other. The loss of text atboth the top and bottom margins (see below) further confounds theissue.The papyrus leaflet is constructed of two smaller sheets which hadbeen glued together and presummably formed part of a blank scroll,or an uninscribed portion of a used scroll. The kollesis, or glueingbetween the sheets, is clearly visible and measures ca. 2.3 cm. wide.The overlapping edges of the two sheets are visible on side A betweenlines 7 and 8, and on side B between lines 27 and 28. The uppersheet measures ca. 19.0 x 7.0 cm., and the lower sheet, ca. 19.0 x19.4 cm. The kollesis, a naturally stronger portion of the sheet, hascaused enough stress on the weaker portions outside of the kollesis toresult in some damage at the bottom edge of the kollesis: there onefinds a long horizontal lacuna between lines 7 and 8 of side A (= lines28 and 29 of side B).Where the papyrus is intact, strips of fiber once inscribed haveloosened and fallen away from the sheet. This type of damage isclearly evident on side A, where vertical strips have fallen away result-ing in a loss of letters from the same sections of lines 1 through 12,and on side B, where horizontal strips have fallen away resulting inthe loss of text below line 36. Other inscribed portions have lost inkthrough abrasion (side B, lines 25-29).The scribe has drawn several horizontal lines across both sides ofthe sheet as text separators (following the lines 12, 19, 30 [two parallellines], 33, and 38). There appears to be only one scribal hand whichvaries greatly in both style and size. This variation suggests that therecipes were occasionally copied by a single individual over an inde-terminable period from either another sourcebook (or sourcebooks),or from amulets randomly acquired. The scribe might also have usedmore than one pen and certainly more than one solution of ink. He(or she) writes large square letters with a slant to the upper right inthe first four recipes but in recipes five and six changes style. Therethe writing becomes more hurried and cursive, and the ink lighterthrough dilution. Overall, the scribe writes in a practiced but hurriedstyle typical of documentary hands of the fourth century CE.The text shows typical late features in spelling, including the intru-sive final -n in 3rd declension accusatives (monogenÆn for monogen∞ inlines 3f.; pe'dan [viz. pa›dan] for pa›da in line 4; l°ontan for l°onta inline 16). A number of minor corrections are supplied above the line"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"   (7, 8, 12, 21, 30, 31); the first recipe shows phrases added, in some-what smaller letters, interlinearly.The text itself also presents a number of morphological and syn-tactical anomalies. In line 1 there may be an apparent use of theactive voice for the passive, although the reading is questionable.Several of these difficulties in the text can only be explained from thethesis that the scribe was working with from a cursive model that had,at some time, been formerly misunderstood in transcription. Thus»xleukÒtvn, if correct, would presuppose an original Ùxloum°nvn (1);oem[Ònvn an original dem[Ònvn (leg. dai[mÒnvn [1]); ı nÊs[aw an origi-nal ı lÊs[aw (2); pod«n an original pÒdaw; klÒuda (sic) an originalklãsma (23); and énallabã (sic) an original énalab≈n (31). In anyevent, the text in these places is unusually corrupt. Elsewhere, thesyntax and sense has gone awry, especially with spell IV (lines 23-30),where little more than disjointed, meaningless phrases seem to bepreserved. Two of the extant titles (rubrics) use the genitive (of advan-tage?) without any preposition to introduce the spell: t≥[«]n»xl≥euk≥Ò≥t≥vn (1) and c≥v≥l∞w (31); another is a simple title in the nomi-native, eflerå s≥thlØ deu≥[t°ra] (34), indented in the text (34). An earlierphrase, tÚn kl°ptont≥a≥ pnig›n{e} (28), also seems to be in eisthesi, andthus begins a rubric, as well.P.

The text begins with an apparent exor-cism (see Commentary below, ad loc.). A similar liturgical exorcismusing Biblically based historiolae is preserved in P. Cairo 10263 (=PGM 13), a 4th or 5th cent. papyrus that had been buried with amummy. Preisendanz-Henrichs II, p. 220 gives references to ear-lier literature that provides good parallels to the Christian elementsin the text. One may also compare Suppl. Mag. I. 31 ( = P. Turner49) “with extracts from the Christian credo,” and PGM 18 (5th /6th cent.), a text that lists the account of the raising of Lazarus andthe healing of Peter’s mother-in-law, along with a kind of genericsummary. PGM 23, as well, contains a free reading of Matt 14:18-31 (the Stilling of the Storm) for use as an amulet. For specificGreek parallels from liturgical exorcisms see, e.g. A. Strittmatter,“Ein griechisches Exorzismusbüchlein: Ms. Car. 143 b derZentralbibliothek in Zürich,” Orientalia Christiana (De Orientedocumenta, studia et libri) XXVI-2 (1932), no. 78: 127-144 (Text), p.131, 5-20, and the literature cited in the Commentary below. On“Greek Liturgical Exorcisms” see in general the literature in R.Kotansky, “Remnants of a Liturgical Exorcism on a Gem,” LeMuséon 108 (1995), 143-156, esp. 147-149.Our text also seems to include credal language along with anapparent liturgical response, sometimes interpolated as interlinearphrases set into the main body of the text (lines 1a, 5a). In lines 5-7 and 10-12, these “responses” must have been previously copiedinto the main body of the text, since they are not an interlinearaddendum, per se, but read as a natural continuation of the previ-ous credal material. They must have begun life as responsiveverses some time before the present edition of our text. Further-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"   more, the first interlinear response (line 1a) is probably out ofplace. Accepting the alternating scheme presented below, this ini-tial kyrie-type address is better suited if reconstructed to follow line2 rather than to precede it. All this suggests that our text hasenjoyed a number of prior generations, of which this, the latest,shows the most recent “responses” added in as our lines 1a and 5a(see reconstruction below).All of the “responsory” lines, whether interlinear additions orcontiguous text, display the same general character: the subjects ofthe verses invoke Jesus directly (in abbreviated form: kÊrie, 1a, 11;kÊrie ÉIhsoËw Xr¤ste, 7); use the 2nd person pronoun “you(r)” intheir invocation (t“ s“ , 1a; sou, 7; toË soË, 11; ±y°lhsaw, 4a); andpresent themselves antithetically as a kind of group whose humancondition (én≥[yr≈poiw, 1a; t∆ g°now ény≈pvn≥, 5; pãnta, 11) stands inobedience (§p[Æ]kousan, 11) to a divine command (prostãgmati,1a, 11). These lines are characteristic of antiphonal replies by aliturgical group of some kind, perhaps a laity. For the featured useof “you” in similar contexts, one may compare A. D. Nock’s re-marks in “Liturgical Notes,” JTS 30 (1929), 381-395, esp. p. 384(on so¤ gãr as an “aside” in the Anaphora of Serapion). The con-trasting “verse” material, on the other hand, uses only the 3rdperson in its description of various divine acts (Christian historiolae)related to the kerygmatic life of Jesus (lines 2-5; 7-10). These arefeatures that are not in themselves typical of personalized charmsand amulets, even Christian ones, which routinely quote Biblicalverses and Psalms verbatim and do not make reference to moretheological allusions and responses of a liturgical sort. Only in line12 does our text seem to revert back to a concept of an individualto be protected in its use of the singular (“me, the sinner”). This,too, however, probably has its origin in credal and liturgical mate-rial, not in magical and amuletic texts, even if exorcism seems tobe in question. The exorcism here seems to be based on Christianliturgy and may indeed have been baptismal or eucharistic in func-tion.The use of similar liturgical “antiphonies” is echoed, albeit inan abbreviated form, in P. Louvre E 7332 bis (7th c.), ed. WilliamM. Brashear, Magica Varia (Papyrologica Bruxellensia 25; Bruxelles:Fondation Égyptologique Reine Élisabeth, 1991), no. 2: A Chris-tian Prayer Amulet. There the phrase, “For all are obedient to youwith fear,” in a manner similar to the apparent antiphonal readingof the Berlin papyrus here, occurs with but a single miracle-historiola. PGM 6d also preserves a fragment of a kindred text (cf.Brashear, Magica Varia, p. 66, for a corrected reading). The follow-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"  ‒       ing reconstruction illustrates how one might arrange such credaltexts to highlight the antiphonal character of their purported litur-gies. In the case of the Berlin papyrus, it is clear that some of theresponses fall slightly out of sequence, for which see the Commen-tary below.Liturgical ReconstructionsP.

Cairo 10263 (= PGM 13) the long list ofkerygmatic items at the beginning of the prayer is capped by theformula, “Come, Mercy, the God of Eternity” in line 9 (for text, seeCommentary below). This, in turn, is followed by the liturgical re-sponse, “Jesus, the voice that appeases sinners, as many as we who callupon Your Name” (line 14). This use of the communal “we” stands incontrast to the singular “I call upon you” that occurs at the beginningof that papyrus.The original context of these liturgical texts with refrain seems tobe eucharistic. Each ends with an appeal to the Lord to “come”(§ly°), with mercy, to the sinner (or the sufferer). Although in eachcontext both the recounting of miracles and the unison-like responsesof the group, described collectively as “men” (“people”) or “all”, maybe part of a pre-existent eucharistic text, they have been adapted forexorcistic and other kinds of healings. Even this therapeutic function,however, may have been original to the eucharistic setting itself. Theridding of demons and illness was a common prerequisite for bothbaptism and Eucharist in post-Apostolic Christianity; see R.Kotansky, “Excursus: Liturgical Exorcism, Solomon, and Magic La-mellae,” in Greek Magical Amulets I (Opladen, 1994), pp. 174-180 (=GMA), and literature there cited. In instructions for the Mass given inCyril of Jerusalem (see Alfred Adam, Liturgische Texte I. Zur Geschichteder orientalischen Taufe und Messe im II. und IV. Jahrhundert [3. Auflage.Kleine Texte 5; Berlin: deGruyter, 1960), Cyril von Jerusalem,Messe, V.2 (p. 15-17)], responses between priest and laity are given inthe form of antiphonal readings.1t≥[«]n v≥xl≥e≥u≥k≥o≥[.]vn: inevitably t«n »xleukÒtvn (Brashear). But thepresence of ÍpÒ (“by”) and the general sense suggest the passivenot active voice (»≥xl≥e≥u≥m≥°≥[n]vn, for Ùxloum°nvn). Although thereading »≥xl≥e≥u≥k≥Ò≥[t]vn seems secure, it is possible that this repre-sents the misidentification of certain cursive letters in a previousmodel that a scribe drew upon. Also, the cursive kappa here iswholly unlike those of the rest of the papyrus and looks almostidentical, for example, to the mu of monoge/nÆn in 3f. Further-more, although the -o≥t≥vn in -k≥o≥t≥vn is also the favored reading, thistoo may have derived from an originally cursive -envn. See furtherthe comments below, and those on line 23.That »xl≥e≥u≥k≥Ò≥t≥vn is perhaps an articial reading of sorts, is sug-gested at first blush by the unusual form of this verb.

Were it not for the presence of certain poetic forms else-where in the Berlin text (e.g., ¶rdv and proskul¤v in 35; oÈrãnh in28), this form here would not otherwise be expected.On Ùxl°v used in demonological contexts, cf. esp.

The omicron, which is clearly written on thepapyrus, is almost certainly an error for delta, albeit an error thatoriginated in an earlier exemplar. Several readings in the text, asnoted above, presuppose an earlier, corrupted model whose mis-spellings probably arose out of the misidentification of cursive writ-ing.On spells against demons, cf. the formulary in Suppl.

This interlinear line reads like a collective response tothe programmatic “liturgy” of the rest of the text, of which re-sponse there are several in our text. In this sense, what we haveimbedded here is a liturgical reading (versicle) to which is added acongregational response (responsory), as noted above. PrÒstagmadoes not occur in the New Testament, per se, but is used by post-Apostolic writers, mostly in the plural: Diognetus 12:5 (sg.); 1Clem. 2:8; 3:4; 20:5; 37:1; 40:5; 50:5; 58:2; 2 Clem. 19:3; cf. theverb pros°tajen of the angel’s command to Joseph in Matt. 1:24.For a similar use of t“ prostãgmati in a liturgical exorcistic con-text, see André Jacob, “Un exorcisme inédit du Vat. gr. 1572,”Orientalia Christiana Periodica 37 (1971), 244-249, p. 246 §4; F.

The phrase probably refers to some initial redemptive actof God the Father in reference to the entire Christ-event that theexorcistic text is meant to catalogue, even though there is nothingfrom the New Testament narratives from which this might bederived (see § to follow). The subject of the main participial verb,ı lÊsaw, appears to be God, as is that of the two that follow,§japost(e)¤law and §noikÆsaw. With the liturgical vocative thatcomes next, “O Lord Jesus Christ” (line 7), the main verbs in theform of participles switch to Jesus as subject. It should also bepointed out that the nu may be a lambda with an extra verticalstroke, l≥i≥, or, there may be a phonetic confusion between the twoliquids l and n.The liturgical ‘exorcism’ in Pradel, Gebete, p. 260, line 18f.begins with a more ‘standardized’ version of this kerygmatic ele-ment: YeÚw ı afi≈niow ı lutrvsãmenow §k t∞w afixmalvs¤aw toËdiabÒlou tÚ g°now t«n ényr≈pvn; see also Louis Delatte, Un Officebyzantin d’Exorcisme (Académie royale de Belqique, Mémoires, 52;Bruxelles, 1957), p. 38, 27f.; p. 74, 6f.: ...

The aorist participle, ı §japos-t(e)¤law, continues a historiolae-sequence of a liturgical nature thatbegins with Christ’s Pre-existence and mostly enumerates his mira-cles: Redemption of Humankind (?), Sending (into the World), Virgin Birth,Walking on Water, Feeding of 5000. The example from PGM 13,above, has a similar participial sequence, but is based on a chrono-logical, rather than a miracle-based kerygmatic scheme: Entranceinto the World, Virgin Birth, Youth in Nazareth, Crucifixion, Rending ofTemple Veil, Resurrection, Appearance, Ascension, and so on.In Pradel, Gebete (Comm. supra), p. 260, 1f. a similar formulaicverse comes at the very beginning of a related “catalogue” which,as here, is typified by the use of a set of participial phrases: ıp°mcaw tÚn monogen∞ uflÚn tÚn kÊrion Ím«n, ktl. The order suggeststhat the two elements in the Berlin liturgical text should perhapsbe reversed. In the Didache 9.3 a eucharistic formula similarly usespa›w of Jesus (see Commentary. below, line 23).4-5The Virgin Birth. As with the rest of this text, the couplet ka‹ §nlagÒs≥i pary[°]/no≥u §noikÆsaw finds no exact New Testament par-allel. This element, however, does not narrate the Virgin Birth, perse, as much as the Divine Indwelling, as alluded to in the BiblicalAnnunciation (cf. Luke 1: 26-38). In Luke 1:30 Mary is said thatshe will “conceive in her womb”, sullÆmc ̇ tª gastr¤ (cf. howeverMatt. 1:23, the Christi nativitas, proper). The notion of the Virginbeing “indwelled” (§noikÆsaw) by God may be a distant echo ofLuke 1:35, where, however, it is said that the Holy Spirit will“come upon” (§peleÊsetai) Mary, and the power of the Highestwill “overshadow” (§piskiãsei) her. In the Berlin papyrus the sub-ject of the verb “having indwelled” is God himself, the same asthat of “having sent.” Sensu stricto, the formula §noike›n + §n means“to live in (the womb).” God the Father “lived in” the womb ofMary in the form of Jesus. Lag≈n (“hollow”; “flanks”) in the pluralin late Greek means “womb”. The word does not appear in theBiblical versions. Our text preserves an entirely independent tex-tual witness, probably oral in derivation. Once again with theBerlin papyrus we have non-Biblical recollection of traditionalChristian themes.

Instead of §p‹ t«n Ídãtvn, theGospel parallels have §p‹ t∞w yalãsshw. In the Pradel exorcism(Gebete), p. 265, line 9f., we read ÉIhsoË XristoË, ̆w §p°bh efiw tØnyãlassan peripat«n, ktl.; cf.

The reference in the Berlin papyrus toJesus not “defiling” his feet is not in the Bible. The genitive of“feet” here following the verb is peculiar; the sense—if this is not asimple error for pÒdaw (see above)—must be that of “having defiled(himself) in respect of his feet.” It is also possible, however, thatpod«n has been influenced by Ídãtvn in the line above.9-10The Feeding of the 5000.

The apparent reapplication of the formulas in the Louvreand Wien texts to healings—and in the Berlin text to exorcism—may be original to the liturgies themselves: ritual healing and exor-cism were standard prerequisites for both baptism and Eucharist;see H.

The invocation, then, may be part of anaÎtoptow or sÊstasiw, as we have in PGM IV. 930-1114—spellsthat invoke the very presence of powerful stellar, or light-bearing,deities (see Comm. below).20-21 t≥r°xousa tÚn é°ra ... éstrodoËxe ÙreodrÅÒÄ[me] (the last syllableof this word may, indeed, be part of the lacuna in the next line): cf.PGM III. 255/257: oÈrodrÒme ... §ly¢ ... éerodrÒme PÊyie Paiãn (=Hymn 12, in dactylic hexameters, Preisendanz-Henrichs, II, p.247).

The formulary of Suppl. Mag. II. 86( = P. Oxy. LVI. 3835) is concerned exclusively with this genre, towhich the editors compare PGM V. 70-95, 172-212 (see below);III. 479-494; GriffithThompson, Demotic Magical Papyrus, III.29 (translation in Betz, GMPT, p. 200); Bell-Nock-Thompson,“Magical Texts from a Bilingual Papyrus,” 244, col. vi ( = Betz,GMPT. p. 288f.). All the examples in Suppl. Mag. II. 86 deal withmethods to detect a thief (ı kl°caw / tÚn kl°pthn).23-24 KLOUDA ı lab∆n mØ katape›n: see the Commentary below online 29. The syntax of this phrase and several of the others in thelines below make no sense; they may be corrupt, or the fault mayrest in our own readings which must, at best, remain tentative.Assuming a cursive Vorlage, KLOUDA would appear to be a corrup-tion of KLASMA. Eucharistic overtones in this text are unmistak-able; cf. Mark 6:43; 8:8, 19f. (and Synoptic parallels), where,however, this noun is reserved for the Feeding Miracles. In theDidache 7.3 (19), the rubric Per‹ d¢ toË klãsmat≥ow describes ritualsof the Eucharist, in which context Jesus is addressed toË paidÒw sou(see line 4, above).24 ̃ti ırk¤zv Ímçw, ktl.: On the use of the adjuration, see Kotansky,“Remnants of a Liturgical Exorcism,” pp. 145-147; Kotansky,“Greek Exorcistic Amulets,” in Marvin Meyer & Paul Mirecki,edd.

If the following phrase in line28 begins a new spell, however, then tã≥dÉ ßto≥i≥ma will end with line27, despite the fact that there is no dividing line. Even if this isrelated to the preceding épotr≈gon, the context is uncertain. Aritual to detect a thief, like that of PGM V. 172-212 (esp. 181 +211), seems to underlie the context as a whole (see discussion tofollow).28tÚn kl°ptonta≥ pnig›n{e} (leg. pnige›n). The modest indentation sug-gests a title, “To choke a thief.” The topos of “throttling” or grab-bing the thief by the throat occurs in the thief formula of PGM V.172-212 (vide infra), esp. lines 192-196: “I call upon Hermes, finderof thieves, (etc .) ... to grab the thief’s throat (§pikrat∞sai tØn toËfvrÚw katãposin), and make him manifest this very day, this veryhour!” The reading of pnige›n looks rather like a case of the scribehaving first written pnig›n, to which an epsilon was added in anattempt to emend the text as pnigÅeÄ›n (viz. pnige›n). What occurredinstead was that the epsilon got copied at the end of the word,creating the distortion * pniginÅeÄ (which eventually corrupted tothe simple pnigine of our MS).tØn »rãnhn (leg. oÈrãnhn): This rare term for “chamberpot” (=ém¤w)is unexpected.

Eustathius, Od. 2.156.11, 13), of the “foul-smellingchamber pot” (tØn kãkosmon oÈrãnhn).

Clearly some detail has been omitted. One may suggest,possibly, mØ kataf≥ã≥g{r} ̇, contrasting katapine›n in 23f., but this isfar from certain. Remarkably, the only other apparent reference inancient literature to this “bread and cheese” foodstuff occurs inanother formula, also to apprehend a thief (PGM V. 172-212), esp.line 181 (lÒgow toË értotÊrou). In this “bread / cheese” formula,the thief is to be pointed out (tÚn kl°pthn §mfan∞ poi∞sai, l. 185f.and “handed over” (parãdow f«rÉ, ̆n zht«, l. 210; cf. also lines192-196, cited above). This is eventually enacted by means of aritual involving the bread-cheese: “If any one of them does not eat(mØ katap¤ ̇ tÚ doy°n) what is given him, this one is the thief (ıkl°caw).” This suggests a context of diners, probably slaves, whowould have been familiar to the victimized owner rather thanunknown housebreakers who have run far away with the stolengoods. It is probable then that mØ kataf≥ã≥g{r} ̇ (?) tÚn értãturon, ina manner similar to the spell of PGM V, identifies the thief whodoes not eat the bread-and-cheese. In line 23f. of this spell, thephrase klãsma (?!) ı lab∆n, mØ katape›n might, somehow, refer tothe same method of detection. On the whole “bread/cheese”ritual, cf.

The reading would tend to confirm a spell for an erec-tion, although the mention of a house is odd (see below, line 31).The same sort of brief sexual recipes (part of the genre of Pa¤gnia,“Jocular Recipes”) are preserved in PGM VII. 167-185; Suppl.

The papyrus seems to read mikrãnrather clearly, but “little house” (euphemism for penis?) is not at-tested (this would necessitate the emendation tØn ofik¤an <tØn>mikrãn). Assuming that “a little (mikrÒn) place” is to be read, it isstill one’s house that is to be sprinkled. (The former referencewould assume a reference to the “dribbling” or dripping of theliquid onto the penis itself, here called a “little house”, an interpre-tation difficult, at best). Then, presumably, an area on the peniswould to be left unsprinkled by the mixture. More likely, however,is that mikrãn / -Òn goes with tÒpon: “and having sprinkled yourhouse, leave a little place not sprinkled ...” (making a restoration,e.g., ¢≥p≥[‹ c]v≥[l]ª≥ unlikely).

Milligan cited as a parallel “a stock phrase of Artemis-worship”at Acts 19.28, megãlh ≤ (om. ≤ D*pc) ÖArtemiw ÉEfes¤vn, and Preisen-danz referred to this phrase and to a discussion by Peterson, who,after several not particularly relevant examples of acclamations of thetype EÈtux«w to›w numf¤oiw, states, without argumentation, that “wenndas Zauberbüchlein P. Oxyrh. VI 886 ... also anhebt: megãlh âIsiw ≤kur¤a, so haben wir hier eine akklamatorische ... Eingangsformel voruns.” In the majority text of the New Testament, however, we maynote that the position of megãlh is predicative position, while in thepapyrus it is attributive; the New Testament phrase is not a perfectlyuseful parallel. One should understand the line as Hopfner does:“Great Isis the Lady.” The papyrus phrase occurs elsewhere, though,in a graffito on the Monte della Giustizia in Rome (Brizio, Anon.1873:36), eÂw ZeÁw Sãrapiw / megãlh âIsiw ≤ kur¤a. Its “One ZeusSarapis” does seem to be an acclamation: at the end of an invocationof the Sun at PGM IV 1596-715, the operant, if successful, is to utterthe phrase (cf. the obscure Poublikian°, eÂw ZeÁw Sãrapiw, §l°hson, IGXIV 2413.3, on a gold amulet from Rome). Whether or not, properlyspeaking, the second line of the graffito is also an acclamation, “GreatIsis the Lady,” at least in the papyrus, is certainly the title of therecipe: it is set off from the rest of the text by a blank area, and itstands in ecthesis. It may be compared with the title GraËw ÉApollvn¤ouTuan°vw Íphret¤w of the spell that makes up PGM XIa: like the oldassistant of Apollonios of Tyana, Isis was a magician, and below inthe Oxyrhynchos papyrus (7-10) we learn that the magical operationis one from which she actually benefitted."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"     5.-6.

In Egypt—and I have found the word nowhereelse—it was a place for the village kvmasta¤ to welcome the coming ofan Egyptian god. In three passages in the magical papyri, we find thatthe Almighty has an “eternal dancing-floor” (é°nnaon k.: PGM XII 252,XIII 774, XXI 10), and, in three other passages, that “heaven becamehis dancing-floor (⁄ oÈranÚw §g°neto k.: IV 1628, XII 183, an unpub-lished formulary), but our text is, so far, unique in placing the dancing-floor simply in the “air.” Something has obviously gone wrong. InXII, as part of the invocation that includes mention of the “eternaldancing-floor,” we find, among the attributes of the Almighty,oÈranÚw m¢n kefalÆ, afiyØr d¢ s«ma, g∞ pÒdew. This phrase, I wouldhazard, may be the source of the mistake; presumably the composeror the copyist of the model of our text began with the quotation fromIsaiah and then, under the influence of the phrase “heaven the head,air the body,” etc., inserted a word for air (his a‡yra); may he havethen realized that “body” (s«ma) has no natural place between“throne” and “footstool,” and supplied a word that begins with asimilar sound (kvmastÆrion), familiar from celestial imagery?For the voces magicae that immediately follow the reference to God’sfootstool I have no parallels that would allow restorations,2 but the2We may wonder whether the syllables yomara/arabrv may have some connec-tion with the frequentie found yvbarrabau, which R.D.

At LXX Isaiah 6.1-3 we read: “... and I saw theLord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and the house was full ofhis glory. And the seraphim stood around him.... And they cried outone to another and said “Holy holy holy, lord of hosts, all the earth isfull of thy glory (ëgiow ëgiow ëgiow kÊriow Sabavy, plÆrhw pçsa ≤ g∞ t∞wdÒjhw sou).” As a restoration êgie, [ëgie, ëgie] is virtually inevitable,3and there is room in the lacuna for the expected full triad, ép°rate, /ép°rat[e, ép°rate], even though, as far as I know, no religious ormagical text is yet quotable with this latter phrase.Almost equally rare is the éstroy°ta of 18, the noun being foundelsewhere only in an Orphic hymn (64.2). As for 19-20, the little thatis preserved of Preisendanz’ p[ur¤]p[noe in 19 invites agnosticism, thephotograph shows that there is no room for the restoration [vr,xruso] later in the line, and the preserved traces rule out the p°di[leye°] of 20. Having rejected Powell’s ke]xrhmãtis≥/mai in favor of hisown xrhmãtis[on.’] / ka¤ in 20-21, Preisendanz, in his app.crit., won-ders how to fit eÎdhlon into the construction. The invocation runs infact from 5 until the long punctuating mark at the end of 23; itincludes the claim that “I have requested” (reading ke]xrhmãtis≥/maiwith Powell), “without fear or trembling, a clear oracle” (eÎdhlonxrhsmÒn rather than the editors’ e. xrhmatie›). In this he can takesome pride, for he has calmly addressed the Almighty, “before whomthe demons tremble, whom the mountains fear.” The silent speaker isto add, as part of the invocation, the subject of his inquiry (per‹ toËd∞na proãgmatow for de›na prãgm.); we find other silent or whisperedincantations at PGM IV 475, 1271-73 (see Kapsomenakis 1938:58),LXX 23 (see Jordan, forthcoming), and LXXVII 3-4.The gravity or gloom of the silent speaker is, however, a ghost.The papyrus has a misspelling that I have not seen before,proãgmatow for prãgmatow, but the transcription is unavoidable: thereis no ég°lastow.

The tiny leaf of precious metal (H. 6.35 cm.; W.2.50 cm.) offered here is said to have come from Asia Minor or Syria,although its exact provenance is not known. Palaeographically, it canbe assigned to the early 2nd century CE. Formerly in the hands of aBelgrade dealer, the piece now belongs in a private collection inLondon, whose owner has cordially allowed me to present it here.The transcript produced below represents results from an autopsia ofthe original made on several separate occasions. An earlier, provi-sional reading of the piece was also presented at the 1989 XIX Inter-national Congress of Papyrology in Ain-Shams University Cairo,Egypt.I would also like to take the occasion to thank the participants inthe Orange magical conference for an abundance of helpful com-ments and fruitful dialogue in the course of explicating this short butdifficult text (see Fig. 1 and photo).TranslationTurn away, O Jesus, the Grim-Faced One, and on behalf of your maidservant,her headache, to (the) glory of your name, IAÒ ADÒNAI SABAÒTH, III ***,OURIÈL ***, {OURIÈL}, GABRIÈL.The text is largely intact, although there is a slashing tear in theupper right side that is probably ancient since it does not directlyinterfere with the written text; however, the readings at the ends oflines 2-3, in the general environment of this tear, are not at all cer-tain.

Atiny, final alpha seems visible, but this is difficult to read as a letter.The form pãnta is adverbial (see LSJ s.v. pçw D.II.4, for pãntvw,BAGD, s.v. 2ad); cf. pãnt ̇ (“on every side”; “altogether”).It is also difficult to discern enough of a trace after the finalvertical of THI≥ to form THN≥ (tØn≥ gorgvpa _. ́), even under magnifi-cation, but tÆn seems to be what was intended (a iota-adscript, t∞iis unlikely here). Still, we have to admit the possibility that t∞iGorg≈p& might have preserved a feminine name to which the fol-lowing ka‹ tª paid¤sk ̇ sou was appended in direct apposition:“Turn aside, O Jesus, for Gorgopa (who is) also your maidservant,(her) headache.” A masculine name, Gorg≈paw (gen. Gorg≈pa) doesexist (as in the famous Spartan general, Gorgopas), but this is notan option here, since the subsequent moniker in line 4f. below, tªpaid¤sk ̇, also identifies the bearer as feminine. Even given thereading THI, it would still be difficult to read in lines 2f. a dativename (t∞i Gorg≈p&), for here we would have to admit the adscriptbut nowhere else. Furthermore, on stylistic grounds the use of aka¤ at the beginning of line 4 seems to separate the two phrases oflines 2f. and 4f., as if independent elements. To read here asentence such as “turn aside for Gorgopa (?) and for your maid-servant the headache” would appear to introduce two, not one,bearer. This is only possible if we assume that the writer has repro-duced a faulty model, a possibility suggested by other factors. Syn-tactically, the idiosyncratic nature of the text, with the affliction(tØn kefalarg¤an) in the accusative preceded by the reference tothe client in the dative (tª paid¤sk ̇) all but ensures that tØn≥Gorg«pa will also decribe an afflicting demon complementary totØn kefalarg¤an. Standardized texts of a later period would havewritten épÒstrecon tØn kefalarg¤an épÚ t∞w paid¤skhw sou, (tØnde›na).Gorg«pa, then, must refer to a menacing demon to be avertedin Jesus’ name; she is evidently a mythological figure representa-tive of the Headache identified directly with the cause of the“maidservant’s” complaint. The closest headache-analogy comesin the famous “Antaura” amulet, a spell against the migrainedemoness, Antaura, written on a silver lamella from Carnuntum(see Kotansky, GMA I.13, pp. 58-71, with numerous late Christianadaptations).

GorgoËw), or ≤ Gorg≈n (gen. GorgÒnow,acc. GorgÒna; along with the plural forms, GorgÒnew, acc. GorgÒnaw,etc.). A feminine and masculine form, ı / ≤ gorg≈c (gen. gorg«pow,acc. gorg«pa), which seems to be what we have here, is defined inLSJ s.v. as “grim-eyed”; “fierce-eyed.” It occurs only twice, bothtimes in Euripides. In the first passage, it is an adjective actuallydescribing Pallas Athena’s Gorgoneion shield that, when heldoverhead (gorg«fÉ Íperte¤nousã sou kãr& kÊklon, Electra 1257),serves as a kind of protective device warding off the “terrible dog-faced goddesses, the Kères” (deina‹ d¢ K∞r°w sÉ afl kun≈pidew yea¤,Electra 1251) . In the second instance, it is used as a plural noun todescribe the Erinyes themselves, “dog-faced dreaded goddessess”(Œ FoibÉ, époktenoËs¤ mÉ afl kun≈pidew / gorg«pew §n°rvn fler¤ai,deina‹ yea¤, Orestes 260-1).In the magical papyri, a “Gorgonian head” (tÚ gorgÒneion kãra)is to be depicted on an engraved iron fetter (PGM IV. 3137f.), andin PGM IV.1404 a netherworld three-headed goddess is addressedas the “dreaded, grim-faced (gorg«pi) Persephone-Kore.” The un-published index to Preisendanz also refers to the demon GorgopiÒwin A.

On our lamella, ÉIhsoËw may wellhave supplanted the mythological figure of PerseÊw, as slayer ofthe Gorgon, par excellence; on the Perseus myth in general, seeTimothy Gantz, Early Greek Myth.

It would not therefore have served as a model for the usageon this amulet. The High Priest’s paid¤skh in the story of Peter’sdenial is a virtual Herodian slave (Mark 14:69 par.—in John 18:17she is a doorkeeper-maiden, ≤ paid¤skh ≤ yurvrÒw), as is the door-keeper Rhoda in the house of Mary, mother of John-Mark (Acts12:13). The slave-girl who possessed a kind of divinatory spirit(paid¤skhn tinå ¶xousan pneËma pÊyvna) in the remarkable episodeoutside of Philippi (Acts 16:16) has masters (ofl kur¤oi) who areRoman (Acts 16:21). In Gal 4:22-30, paid¤skh (drawn from LXXGen. 21:10 hm;a;) designates Hagar from whom Abraham has fa-thered Ishmael. And although both Philo and Josephus use theterm (the former especially in connection with the Hagar story),there is no indication that “slave woman” had ever come to desig-nate a Jewish (or Christian) “servant” of God. The relatively earlyEpistle of Barnabas 19.7 c.1. (= Didache 4.10) also refers to paid¤skhand doËlow as literal slaves. Therefore, on the basis of this evi-dence, we can only conclude that the term “your female servant”must reflect an independent but invaluable witness to an earlydesignation for female converts to Christianity in the environs ofSyria or Asia Minor. In this case, we possess a valuable, autono-mous record of an early Christian counterpart to the Pauline useof doÊlh (viz. doËlow).5-7tØn / kefalarl/g¤an: see GMA I. 57.17 (commentary, p. 329);Suppl.

The expression, in view ofthe divine names that follow, reflects a simple Christian or early‘Jewish-Christian’ piety. The sou immediately preceding the tri-adic names (“... to the glory of your name, Iaò Adònai Sabaòth”)would appear to stand in opposition to the sou in reference toJesus in the phrase “your slave-woman” of 4f. But it is entirelypossible that the sou also refers to the ÉIhsoË of line 2. In this case,however, ÉIãv ÉAdvna‹ Saba≈y would have to be preceded by aperiod and show no syntactical relationship with the rest of thetext (“... to the glory of your name. Iaò Adònai Sabaòth,” etc.). Herethe divine names, as well as the angel-names, would represent aloose appendage of invoked powers. For efiw dÒjan in reference toGod (but not the Name), cf.

At the end of the line, following a series of strokes—representing either iota’s or vertical bars—appears an elaboratescribbly mark, terminating in a series of looping waves to the up-per right of the line. This is intended to represent ligatures of somekind, highly cursive writing, or additional erasures, as mentioned.The writing of this very common divine triad as ÉIãv ÉAdvna‹Saba≈y (instead of ÉIãv Saba≈y ÉAdvna‹) may have arisen from aninterlinear correction that had ÉAdvna¤ subsequently copied backinto the text in front of Saba≈y rather than after it.12-14The erased and dittographic text is doubtful here. No lettersof 12 and 14 can be read with certainty. Furthermore, the OÈriÆlof 13 looks like the impossible name Y≥uriÆl, but this may be dueto an underlying erasure or a crease in the foil. On the popularetymology of Ouriel and Gabriel, see R. Kotansky, “Two In-scribed Jewish Aramaic Amulets from Syria,” IEJ 41 (1991), 267-281, esp. 276, 278, with numerous parallels. As mentioned earlier,one expects three angels here, or even four (viz. MixaÆl, GabriÆl,ÉRafaÆl, OÈriÆl).Although the text is ostensibly Christian, several features require spe-cial attention. Particularly noteworthy is the lack of any liturgical orcredal language typical of later Christian magic. The Christian aspectis restricted to the simple use of Jesus’ name in the vocative (ÉIhsoË).There is no formulaic use of “in the name of ...” (e.g., in Suppl.Mag. I.20; cf.

No elementsreflective of later post-Constantinian Christian magic characterizethis text at all (see Suppl. Mag.

Ancient Christian Magic, esp. 27-57). The gold lamella’ssimple apotropaic prayer to Jesus—along with a handful of divineand angelic names—is conspicuous for its absence of stereotypicallanguage characteristic of late Christian magical texts.Given the relatively early date of the lamella, the text may wellderive from a Hellenistic Jewish milieu that has simply appropriatedJesus’ name for its magical properties (cf. Acts 19:13; PGM IV. 3019,on which see R. Kotansky, “Greek Exorcistic Amulets,” in MarvinMeyer & Paul Mirecki, edd. Ancient Magic & Ritual Power [Religions inthe Graeco-Roman World, 129; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1995], 243-277).Or, the wearer may have been an adherent to some form of Jewish-Christianity at a time when Christianity was not yet sharply demar-cated from its Jewish roots (cf. Stephen G. Wilson, art. “JewishChristian Relations 70-170 C.E.,” ABD 3 [1992], 835-839, with lit.).That our text, however, is surely Christian, is recommended from theuse of the pronominal phrase ≤ paid¤skh sou (4f.), which stands indirect affiliation with ÉIhsoË (2). “Your servant” can only refer toJesus, not to the Jewish God of lines 9-11, where the same pronounof ÙnÒmatÒw sou seems more easily attached to “Iaò Adònai Sabaòth”(see commentary supra).

I am indebted to Dr. HelenWhitehouse of the Ashmolean Museum for allowing me access to the Ashmolean’sBodleian collection in August 1993, for quality photographs and for her kind permis-sion to publish the artifact; the stone, actually part of the Bodleian collection, hasbeen stored in the Ashmolean Museum since 1939.2The present writer was fortunate to work under William Brashear in thePapyrussammlung of the Ägyptisches Museum in Berlin for four long summers in thelate 1980s and the early 1990s. The many months of discussion of problematic Greekand Coptic texts, and the endless hours we spent analyzing and conserving numerousdamaged papyri, made clear to me that Bill’s reputation for scholarly excellence wascombined with a generous willingness to share the vast treasures of the Berlin papy-rus collection under his expert care.3Davies, a one time Congregational clergyman and a most promising dilettanteEgyptologist under F. Ll. Griffith, quickly became a master epigrapher as his highquality work throughout Egypt demonstrates.

The other edges are sharp, jagged andbrittle, having suffered damage after inscribing, resulting in severallacunae5.Another unusual feature of the stone, crucial to an understandingof its function, is that it cannot stand upright by itself, as it is “topheavy” with a pointed and irregular bottom edge. The fact that theinscribed areas conform to the present shape of the stone indicatesthat the stone was essentially in its present shape when it was in-scribed, despite some later minor damage. There is a small hole (ca.3.5 mm diameter) which had been drilled through the stone near itsbottom edge. The hole appears to have been drilled before the stonewas inscribed, as the inscribed area on both sides is written aroundthe hole, but one cannot be certain that the hole was or was notrelated to a previous function of the stone. Crum suggests that a cordwas passed through the hole and the stone was “sans doute” sus-pended or mounted on a wall, or suspended from a piece of furni-ture.6 The basic problem with Crum’s suggestion is that the inscribedtext would be “up-side down” on the suspended stone, and he offersno parallels for such stones suspended from walls or furniture,epigrapher and artist in her own right), see Excavating in Egypt: The Egypt ExplorationSociety 1882-1982.

Uphill,Who Was Who in Egyptology (London: Egypt Exploration Society, n.d.) 2nd rev. ed., 77-78.4Crum gives the following dimensions: 24 x 26 cm. I cannot account for thedifferences in our measurements, except to say that my measurements in the summerof 1993 were made with these differences in mind. I find the greatest height to be24.2 cm, and the greatest breadth to be (coincidentally) 24.2 cm. I suppose thatCrum’s measurements were meant to be approximates, and this is further suggestedby the cursory, though insightful nature of his discussion.5The greatest damage is to the right side of side A (= left side of side B), givingone the impression that the stone was dropped onto this edge after it was inscribed,causing the lacunae especially evident on side B. This raises at least the possibility ofdeliberate damage due to a context of persecution.6“En effet, un trou qui la transperce, du côté où son épaisseur est la moindre, aservi sans doute à la faire suspendre, au moyen d’une corde, soit à un mur, soit àquelque meuble; ce qui nous permet de reconnaître le mode d’emploi de cette sortede phylactères.

See, for just afew examples, R. Cribiore, “A School Tablet: A List of Names and Numbers,”Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists 35 (1998) 145-51 with bibliography; and C.Préaux, “Une amulette chrétienne aux Musées Royaux d’Art et d’Historie deBruxelles, “Chronique d’Égypte 19 (1935) 361-70, and R. G. Warga, “A ChristianAmulet on Wood,” Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists 25 (1988) 149-52. Inthese two examples described by their editors as amulets, the rationale for the use ofthe term appears to be that the tablets were understood to have had an apotropaicfunction due to their use of sacred texts.8On the concept of “magic and ritual power,” see the discussions in MarvinMeyer and Richard Smith, “Introduction,” in Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts ofRitual Power (HarperSanFrancisco, 1994 [reprinted by Princeton University Press,1999]) 1-6; and Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki, “Introduction,” in Marvin Meyerand Paul Mirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (RGRW 129; Leiden: Brill, 1995)3-5.9There are some examples in the Greek magical papyri, see Papyri Graecae Magi-cae, ed. K. Preisendanz; zweite, verbesserte Auflage von A. Henrichs, 2 vols. (Stutt-gart: Teubner, 1973-74) (hence, PGM) II. 45-50; XXXVI.236-40 and CXXIV.10-40; cf. H. D. Betz, The Greek Magical papyri in Translation including the Demotic Spells, ed.H. D. Betz (University of Chicago, 1986) 13-14, 275 and 321. It is noteworthy thatall such suspended and/or inverted objects are valued negatively in these rituals, anissue that is difficult to reconcile with our limestone inscribed with sacred texts.Enemies and the damned are often represented in an “up-side down” position Inpre-Coptic Egyptian texts and art (cf. R. Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient EgyptianMagical Practice [SAOC 54; Chicago: Oriental Institute, 1993] 168-71). The apostlePeter, mentioned in the limestone’s text (side B, line 1), is said in some early Christiantraditions to have been crucified up-side down, cf. Acts of Peter 37(8) - 38(9), inWilhelm Schneemelcher & R. McL. Wilson, eds., New Testament Apocrypha: VolumeTwo: Writings Related to the Apostles, Apocalypses and Related Subjects, rev. ed. (Louisville:Westminster/John Knox Press, 1992) 315, and in Eusebius, The Ecclesiastical Historyvol. I with an English translation by Kirsopp Lake (LCL #153; Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1926/1998) 191 (= book 3.1.2-3). It seems unlikely, atleast to the present writer, that this large limestone was suspended up-side down, andthat it was, instead, meant for some sort of public or private display within a ritualcontext.10Cf.

Other suggestions are that the stone ispossibly a “stone deposit amulet” set into the foundation of a Chris-tian building,12 a display copy of texts for writing practice, a scribe’sexemplar text for copying,13 or a display copy for inspirational orother ritual use in a monk’s cell or a chapel.14 Whatever the stone’sfunction might have been, parallels to its texts indicate that we arehere in the world of ancient Christian ritual power, specificallyfocussing on the power of the word with, perhaps, a historiolic func-tion generally related to the gospels, Jesus and the twelve apostles.15Crum describes the stone as a sort of “phylactery,” apparently basinghis judgment on the texts, rather than on the unusual form of thestone.1611Suggestion by William Brashear in a personal conversation at the ÄgyptischesMuseum, Berlin, in August 1993.12Suggestion by Helen Whitehouse in a personal conversation at the AshmoleanMuseum, Oxford, in August 1993.13Although a much earlier example (from the 19th-Dynasty), see the large lime-stone covered in hieroglyphs, most probably a scribe’s exemplar copy of the famousStory of Sinuhe in J. W. B. Barns, The Ashmolean Ostracon of Sinuhe (London: OxfordUniversity Press, 1952), coincidentally in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.14Similar texts, such as gospel and psalm incipits and name lists, were written inGreek on the inner walls of a grotto chapel in the Thebaid, in which they wereprobably used for both inspiration and apotropaic protection; on the dating of thetexts and paintings, the editor Lefebvre notes, “Cette chapelle est évidemmentpostérieure à la Paix de l’Église.

Themost notable features are the variant spellings involving both vowelsand consonants, as discussed below (see textual commentary for A.03;B.02, 04-05, 07-08). These variant spellings do not indicate any con-sistent morphological variations departing from what can be expectedin such Sahidic documents. The simple graphemic/phonemic varia-tions here are not significant for any meaningful discussion of outsidedialectal influence.19 Except for the case of jwme (see textual com-mentary for A.01), the unusual spellings here are only found in Greekwords (or, Semitic names which entered Coptic in their Greek forms).17Throughout this study, the words author, scribe and ritualist are used inter-changeably, unless noted in the discussions.18The following identifications and citations are from Maria Cramer, KoptischePaläographie (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1964). Notable hands are in the followingmanuscripts: (1) Tafel 56, Nr. 25: “Pierpont Morgan Bibliothek MS 603, fol 2r ...Anno 903,” and (2) Tafel 63, Nr. 32: “British Museum MS Or. 1320, fol 51r ... Anno1006.”19Note the concise summary comment by Wolf-Peter Funk, “The Coptic dialectscomprise not just different pronunciations and spellings ... but, in fact different nor-mative systems of written communication reflecting ... some of the locally, regionally,or even sometimes nationally balanced spoken idioms” in W.-P. Funk, “Dialects,Morphology of Coptic” in The Coptic Encyclopedia, ed. Aziz S. Atiya (New York:Macmillan,1991) 8:101-108. One gets the impression from both Crum and Kahle(whom I reference when discussing the variants in the limestone), and even fromrecent Coptic editions, that every graphemic/phonemic variant is due to an outsidedialectal influence. Although this may be true in individual cases (e.g., common shiftsof r to l in Fayyumic; e to a in Subakhmimic), many simple graphemic/phonemicvariants are due to localized or individualized idiosyncracies or preferences in pro-nunciation or writing which are attested across dialectal boundaries, rather than todifferences between broader morphological structures defining those dialects."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"   ‒       Apart from eÈagg°lion, the variants all occur in names of persons(ÉIãkvbow, Baryoloma›ow) or a political group (zhlvtÆw). The variantsare either widely attested elsewhere, or can be expected due to estab-lished shifts among vowels and among consonants, but they cannotbe credited to dialectal influence, and may instead indicate theidiolect of an insufficiently trained scribe who does not adhere to oneestablished orthography.20The scribe also deviates from Horner’s eclectic text by once writ-ing the initial epsilon of a prefix (relative form of the first perfect, 3rdperson plural) as a supralinear stroke (n=tautwt [cf. Horner:entautwt]).21When the scribe writes the supralinear stroke over some conso-nants and the two-dot trema over iota, they are sometimes extremelythin and barely visible, suggesting that their occasional absence overletters may be due to abrasion or fading from the stone’s smoothsurface, rather than scribal omission, although the latter cannot beruled out. In the transcription which follows, the stroke and the tremaare not supplied where they are not visible.1.e.PunctuationConcerning punctuation, the scribe employs a full colon (: [cf. A. 01,03-06, 09-10, 13-16; B.04-08, 11, 13, 15]) and a raised dot (≥ [cf.A.07, 18]), although the latter, in both cases, is quite likely the upperremains of a partly abraded full colon. The scribe once writes a dash(—) at the end of a line (B.09) to indicate the end of a text unit, andfurther emphasizes this by drawing a broken horizontal line, func-tioning as a text separator, across the entire surface of the stone(between lines B.09-10). In the transcription which follows, punctua-tion is not supplied where it is not visible.1.f.The texts and their history-of-religions contextThe collection of texts found on the stone are usually employed inCoptic and Greek Christian manuscripts used in contexts of magicand ritual power. Specifically, the texts have been found insourcebooks from which amulets were written and on such amulets20See discussions in the textual commentary for A.03 and B.01-09 §§b.i-iii; cf. R.Kasser, “Idiolect” in Coptic Encyclopedia 8:143-45.21Horner’s critical apparatus obscurely indicates more than one manuscript hasthis reading “en(n= 50 &c)tautwt”."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" -  themselves. Assuming we are correct that this stone finds its primaryfunction in Christian ritual, the basic issue regarding the interpreta-tion of the stone is, of course, whether it is a sort of sourcetext for thewriting of amulets, or is an amulet itself. I know of no boundary orfoundation stones with these texts, and the texts nearly always appearon the media of papyrus, vellum, or early paper.22 Due to the unusualnature of this artifact, I find it nearly impossible to determine whetherthe stone functions as a sourcebook (display copy) or an amulet.23The suggestion that the stone has a ritual function is strengthened bythe observation that Christian crosses were written by the scribe onthe last line of each side, a standard feature of so-called magical texts.The unusual shape of the stone and the drilled hole near its loweredge suggest to me that the scribe must have had a specific functionfor the stone itself as a stone, leading me to suggest that this artifact wasused in a context in which a less durable material would not havebeen appropriate for the needs of the scribe. For example, the stonemight have been deliberately exposed to the weather, which wouldhave deteriorated a more fragile material. Beyond this theoreticalreconstruction of the stone’s original social context, I do not think it ispossible more precisely to determine its original function with anydegree of certainty.24The following list is a short guide to the texts included:Side A:Incipits of the four gospels in canonical order.Titles of the four gospels in canonical order.Short creedal statement concerning Mary and Jesus.Short creedal statement concerning Jesus.Three tau-rho crosses.22The inscribed Thebaid grotto walls are the exception, see n 14.23There are only two amulets, not sourcebooks or fragments thereof, which con-tain only gospel incipits, and both are Coptic; see P. Mich. 1559, a vellum strip withthe incipits of the gospels in canonical order, in Gerald Browne, Michigan Coptic Texts(Barcelona: Papyrologica Castroctaviana, 1979) 43-45 (#12; no photo); and P.

The laterlists of apostles’ names were already popularized by the end of thefirst century in gospels and other texts, though they are rare inmagic.36 I suggest that the lists of apostles’ names in magical textsoriginated as replacements for the lists of names in non-Christianritual texts from which these latter ritualists derived the genre. Thetwelve apostles were understood to be guarantors of the teaching anddivine power transmitted from Jesus to the current Coptic Christiancommunities.37 The ritualist’s logic here probably relates to the con-cept of historiola, that simply listing or speaking the apostles’ nameshas the same ritual effect as narrating stories about them, that is, thatsuch a list can introduce into a contemporary and problematic hu-man situation the same liberating divine power once active in thelives of the apostles as described in the narratives about them.38 Suchwas the fame of the apostles and the divine power at their disposal,that the writers of Christian magical texts simply refered to them inpassing as “the twelve apostles” without actually listing the names.3936Cf.

Jas. 2,1-15a; Epist. Apost. chap. 2; and thequotes from Papias who sought oral teaching directly from the students of the apostles(Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History. 3.39.4).38The so-called Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles were major contributors to thesebeliefs about the divine power inherent in the words and actions of the apostles. Themost important of these were the Acts of Andrew, Acts of John, Acts of Paul, Acts of Peterand Acts of Thomas. See the discussions and texts in Wilhelm Schneemelcher andKnut Schäferdiek, “Second and Third-Century Acts of Apostles,” in New TestamentApocrypha, 2:75-411.39This abbreviated form of accessing the divine power once accessible to thetwelve apostles, is found in at least two early Christian magical texts.

Horner’s Bohairic text of Acts 1:13a lists one manu-script (N) that also reads Iakwbws.(b.ii) Use of e for y: This vowel shift occurs once: selwtys forzylwtys (B.07). Crum notes the shift is common in Greek words(Crum, 50a [§f], with examples), though in Greek texts its converse (yfor e) is rare (Crum, 66a §b, with examples); Kahle lists other Greekwords evidencing the same shift (Kahle, 75 §34; cf. the converse, 70-71 §22).(b.iii) Use of s for z: This consonantal shift from the voiced to thevoiceless fricative occurs once in the limestone: selwtys forzylwtys (B.07). Kahle notes that the shift “is sometimes found inGreek words and names” (Kahle, 95 §69; cf. 127 §104; 127-28 §106);Crum notes that s “varies with z ... and initial q” (Crum, 313a),though the converse z for s is rare (Crum, 65a, with examples).Loprieno states that the phoneme /z/ is “present only in Greek bor-rowings” with “rare exceptions” (41 [§3.6.1]). As early as classicalMiddle Egyptian, the glyphs representing the phonemes /s/ and /z/were often interchangeable, depending on the preference of thescribe.(b.iv) Use of mn= and auw: Coptic Luke consistently uses mn= be-tween all names, while the limestone text omits it three times, buttwice with no replacement (B.04, 05) and once replacing it with auw(B.09).41(b.v) Editing: At the list’s end, the author has deleted the full nameof Judas Isacriot and the phrase regarding his actions: mn= ioudaspiskariwtys pai entafqwpe m+prodotys.

The influence of Luke’s twobooks is evident throughout this name list, as the author or his sourcenow edits Luke 6:14-16 in the light of Acts 1:23. There appears inline 09 to have been an erased letter, or more probably a dark andrough surface which could not be inscribed, between a and v. Thesmall horizontal stroke at the end of the line and the long horizontalline between lines 09 and 10 signal the end of a text unit, i.e., the listof apostles’ names.B.10-11: pnoute nabrah[am] / mn iÚsak: mn iÚakw[bThe original quote is in the form: ÉEg≈ efimi ı YeÚw toË patrÒw sou, YeÚwÉAbraåm ka‹ YeÚw ÉIsaåk ka‹ YeÚw ÉIak≈b (LXX/Exo 3:6). The quote,with variations, is widespread in diverse early Christian writings in-cluding magical texts.44 This standard quote is then extended in lines42The word occurs in early Christian vice lists (e.g., Acts 7:52; 2 Tim 3:4: Sheph.Herm. Sim. 19.3).43This avoidance of Judas’ name is paralleled by its necessary inclusion in at leasttwo aggressive Coptic curse amulets. The first example (P. Louvre E.14.250) isshaped in the form of a knife blade employed to destroy social relationships, andwhich even speaks, saying, “I am that which raised Judas against ...

The second example(London Or.

A similar phrase is found in a Greek Christian magical text(PGM 2P.5b = P. Oxy. 1151) which, after naming four saints, cuts tothe quick by simply stating ka‹ pãntvn t«n èg¤vn. Unlike the namelists of apostles and prophets, name lists of righteous persons (usually45Note a similar logic for the original readers of Heb 11:17-12:1.46Luke exhibits an editorial tendency by twice expanding this LXX quote withsuch phrases: mn= neproFytys tyrou (Luke 13:28) and pnoute n=neneiote (Acts3:13).47The previously discussed inscribed and painted walls of the grotto chapel in theThebaid (see n 14) also contain both gospel incipits and a partially damaged list ofprophets names: Jeremiah, Isaiah, Nahum (?), Zachariah and Malachi. The grotto is,of course, not “magical” in the outmoded Frazerian sense, so here we see that the oldcategories of analysis do not conform well to the evidence. Clearly the grotto’s in-scribed walls with gospel incipits and name lists were all part of the larger ritualcontext in which that sacred space of the grotto was empowered through the paint-ings, sacred words and names which surrounded the ritual participant.48This tendency toward abbreviation can also be seen in the scribe of a Copticamulet (P. Berol. 8324) who, instead of actually writing the 14 names, simply writesa reference to them “the seven names of Mary, seven of the archangels,” in WalterBeltz, “Die koptischen Zauberpapyri der Papyrus-Sammlung der StaatlichenMuseen zu Berlin,” Archiv für Payrusforschung und verwandte Gebiete 29 (1983) 74; Kropp,Ausgewählte koptische Zaubertexte, 2.215-16."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" -  saints or martyrs) are much more commonly found in magical texts,perhaps due to the fact that they were considered intercessors.49Again, the absence of an actual list of the names of righteous personsdoes not hinder access to the divine power which was evident in thelives of the righteous, since the ritualist accesses that power simply bywriting or speaking the simple phrase “and all the righteous.”B.14b-15a: qa[/eneh]The liturgical word actually concludes the phrases begun in line 10.Alternate reconstructions could be qa[e/neh] or qa[en/eh].B.15: hYam[(vacat)]ynThis “Amen,” which occurs only here on the limestone, indicates thatthe texts on both sides are to be read beginning with what I call sideA, across to what I call side B, where the texts end with an appropri-ate concluding “Amen.” This is further indicated by the observationthat side A provides a cleaner, broader and smoother writing surfacethan side B, suggesting that the scribe apparently selected side A asthe initial writing surface.B.16: ] R R [There were probably three crosses inscribed here, as on side A, andone has been lost to abrasion or a lacuna.

I should like to propose the addi-tion of one other magical name to that repertoire, one that appears inthe thaumatic ejaculation, “Great Scott!” I reject out of hand theunimaginative lexicographical suggestion that the phrase refers to thefabled fussiness of the American General Winfield Scott,1 a hero ofthe War of 1812 and the 1846-48 Mexican campaign, unsuccessfulWhig Party presidential candidate in 1852, and the author of a dull,two-volume set of dutiful memoirs of a decidedly non-magical cast.2I doubt that even a Philo or a Heidegger, in their most etymo-logically extreme moments, would attempt to derive the name Scot[t]from that archaic Indo-European root *skot, meaning ‘dark,’ yieldingthe English ‘shade,’ or ‘shadow.’3 It is a semantic field with promisingmagical connotations, as, for example, in the group of skotos-wordsdeployed some thirty times in the Papyri Graecae Magicae4 including fivenominal uses (PGM IV.1114, 2564, 2855; XIII.268; XXXVI.138);but, while tempting, such an association is clearly a ‘false friend.’Also, I must concede that ‘Scot[t]’ is merely an ethnic designationfor uncertain derivation, employed in later Latin.

If actions are noted, they occur within his sources andare rarely taken up by Scott for discussion. The central issues are theorigins of, and the reasons for the persistence of this mass of ‘supersti-tious’ lore. He finds the “credulity of our ancestors” (2) to be matchedby the contemporary “popular credulity” (13), the whole constitutinga “dark chapter in human nature” (2), testifying to the “infectiouscharacter of superstition” (13). Given this agendum, Scott’s Lettersfinds its place on a trajectory reaching from the British tradition ofclerical folklorists concerned with identifying and repressing ‘heathen’practices (whether ancient, or Roman Catholic), best represented bythe complex publishing history of Henry Bourne’s, Antiquitates Vul-gares; or, the Antiquities of the Common People, first published in 1725,17 tothe more ‘scientific’ and global work of E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture(1871) with its focus on the documentary character of “survivals,” a 16 Dorson, The British Folklorists 115. 17 H. Bourne, Antiquitates Vulgares: or, the Antiquities of the Common People, Giving anAccount of their Opinions and Ceremonies. With Proper Reflections upon each of them; Shewingwhich may be Retain’d, and which ought to be Laid Aside (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1725).Bourne was the curate of the All Hallows Church and, as the final clause of thesubtitle indicates, was interested, above all, in purifying practice, especially that asso-ciated with holidays, from both “popish” and “heathen” influence. (See further, J. Z.Smith, Drudgery Divine [Chicago, 1990] 21-22 and n. 36). Bourne’s work was laterrevised and supplemented by John Brand, rector of St. Mary-at-Hill and St. MaryHubbard (London), Observation on Popular Antiquities: including the whole of Mr. Bourne’sAntiquitates Vulgares (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1777; reprinted London, 1810). In 1813,the work achieved its most frequently reprinted form. It was revised, supplementedand reordered by a trained antiquarian, Sir Henry Ellis, Fellow of St. John’s College,Oxford; Principal Librarian of the British Museum, and a Director and Joint-Secre-tary of the Society of Antiquaries. Ellis employed, among other sources, the large,unpublished manuscript of John Aubrey’s, Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme, on de-posit at the British Museum since 1698—subsequently edited and annotated by J.Britten (London, 1881) in the series, Publications of the Folk-lore Society, 4. Ellis’srevision was published under the title, Observations on Popular Antiquities Chiefly Illustrat-ing the Origin of our Vulgar Customs, Ceremonies, and Superstitions, by John Brand with theAdditions of Sir Henry Ellis (London, 1813, and frequently reprinted, including Londoneditions of 1840, 1841, 1847, 1849, 1888, 1913). A less successful fourth version(London, 1870; reprinted 1905) was reedited and reorganized by the man of lettersand bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt (not to be confused with his more famousgrandfather, William Hazlitt)). The use of Bourne-Brand-Ellis as the foundationdocument in English folklore manuals continued. For example, it was thoroughlyransacked in a late example of the genre, William S. Walsh, Curiosities of PopularCustoms and of Rites, Ceremonies, Observances, and Miscellaneous Antiquities (Philadelphia andLondon, 1900)."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"       text which serves as one of the foundation documents of anthropol-ogy.18Indeed, in his first Letter, Scott anticipates Tylor’s theory of animism.The belief in a human spirit comes from dreams, “somnambulismand other nocturnal deceptions” (8). But Scott goes further, offering amedical etiology for apparitions (15-48) as resulting from a sensory“disorder” which “is not properly insanity, although it is somewhatallied to that most horrible of maladies” (15). He notes as well thepossible influence of “intoxicating drugs” (20-21). In a manner typicalof Tylor’s and Frazer’s later explanation of magic, for Scott, a mis-taken subjective experience is here erroneously taken as an objectiveoccurrence (48).The second Letter begins with biblical materials. Scott argues thatthe “witches of Scripture had probably some resemblance to those ofancient Europe” and that neither were involved with Satanism. Ifthere was theological error, it was that of idolatry (53-36). It is fromthese two ancient bases that magic was transmitted to Christianity,especially by “more ignorant converts to the Christian faith” (86).Magic in Christendom is thus a result of “borrowing,” it is a “sur-vival” from the “ruins of paganism” and the “wreck of classical my-thology” (86). This explanation will be insisted upon throughout thework (91-92, 99-120, 178 et passim).It is only, Scott argues, in the Middle Ages that a “regular systemof demonology” evolved (86). From what sources? Letters threethrough five are devoted to this topic. While he notes Zoroastriandualism (87-88) and Celtic traditions (88-90), it is Norse religion (96-117), and most especially European “fairy superstition” (118-172)which have most hold on his attention. With respect to the former, heconcludes, “there were originals enough in the mythology of theGoths as well as Celts, to furnish the modern attributes ascribed toSatan in later times” (116). The matter of fairies is more complex,representing a long-standing preoccupation of Scott19 as well as the 18 E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture (London, 1871) vols. 1-2. See further, M. T.Hodgen, The Doctrine of Survivals: A Chapter in the History of Scientific Method in the Study ofMan (London, 1936). 19 In Letters. 120, note Scott refers to his essay, “On the Fairies of Popular Super-stition,” developed, in part, with the assistance of the philologist John Leyden (see, H.J. C. Grierson, The Letters of Sir Walter Scott [London, 1932-37] 9:485).

Fairies are under-stood to dispense gifts of supernatural power, especially charms andknowledge of the future. This was useful to practitioners of “the pettyarts of deception,” who could reassure their “credulous” clients of theharmlessness of their “impostures” by claiming either to have re-ceived the gift as a boon from fairies or, in its more hostile form, as aresult of having been kidnapped and “transported to fairyland” (142-44). When witchcraft and satanism were outlawed, the same“pretense of communication with Elfland” allowed the “imposters” to“avoid [the] consequences of witchcraft” (144), this being the originof the distinction between ‘white’ (fairy) and ‘black’ (satanic) magic(143-44). Thus “the fairy superstition which ... was much the older ofthe two, came to bear upon, and have connexion with that horridbelief in witchcraft” (172).Letters six through nine deal explicitly with witchcraft and witch-craft trials, offering a series of explanations for the phenomenon.First, it was the all but intended result of Christian suppression ofpopular beliefs, a process which precipitated out the more vulnerableand benign “fairy superstition” while leaving ‘black magic’ in place.Second, science, undeveloped at the time, could accomodate magicas an explanatory and experimental system—he adduces the exampleof Agrippa—but found “fairy land” childish (173-92). Third, witch-craft became a crime because it was linked by various sorts of Chris-tians to heresy; fourth, because it afforded the state an opportunity toprosecute individuals “whom it might not have been possible to con-vict of any other crime;” and fifth, because, in other cases, personalvengeance played a role in bringing accusations (195-201).Scott spend a good bit of time reviewing the various witch trials incontinental Europe (211-222), England (223-82), and Scotland (283-343), the latter two countries taking up the whole of Letters eight andnine. We need not pause over these, except to call attention to Scott’sdocumentary observation, central to later researchers, “Other super-stitions arose and decayed” leaving little trace “depending upon theinaccurate testimony of vague report and of doting tradition.” Thelegal context of witchcraft is quite different. “[W]e have before us therecorded evidence” which provides the modern scholar with “the bestchance of obtaining an accurate view of the subject” (224). 20 See, Dorson, British Folklorists 117, “This association of fairy and witch fore-shadows the point that would be made by Katherine Briggs in The Anatomy of Puck([London,] 1959), on the blending and merging of spectral and malevolent beings.”"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"       Scott concludes the final Letter, largely devoted to astrology (344-51) and apparitions (351-401), both of which he considers independ-ent of witchcraft and demonology, with a rationalist’s progressivecreed:[E]very generation of the human race must swallow a certain measure ofnonsense. There remains hope, however, that the grosser faults of ourancestors are now out of date; and that whatever follies the present racemay be guilty of, the sense of humanity is too universally spread to permitthem to think of tormenting wretches till they confess what is impossible,and then burning them for their pains. (402)I have reviewed Scott’s work of 1830 because it illustrates the sorts ofissues raised by taking the position that magic, and associated phe-nomena, are essentially matters of thought and belief. Such an ap-proach leads most scholars to an evaluation of magic’s claims withrespect to truth. While the confidence of a Frazer now seems ex-treme—“all magic is necessarily false and barren; for were it ever tobecome true and friutful, it would no longer be magic but sci-ence”21—some explicit or implicit negative evaluation is common. Forthis reason, etiological concerns predominate, and Scott has deployedthe full repertoire: genealogical histories, psychological explanations,world-view contextualizations, and socio-political understandings.While I shall return to these more general questions, let me intro-duce the second of our three Scot[t]s, an individual likewise con-cerned with witchcraft, Reginald Scot, author of The discouerie of witch-craft, first published in 1584.22 It is a work that is justly celebrated inalmost every general study of European witchcraft for its scepticism, aviewpoint better captured by one of the three versions of the title 21 J.

To quote only thefirst few lines: Scot’s Discovery of Witchcraft Proving The common opinions ofWitches contracting with Divels, Spirits, or Familiars; and their power to kill,torment, and consume the bodies of men, women, and children, or other creaturesby diseases or otherwise; their flying in the air, &c. To be but imaginaryErroneious conceptions and novelties; Wherein Also, The lewde unchristian prac-tises of Witchmongers, upon aged melancholy, ignorant, and superstitious people inextorting confessions, by inhumane terrors and tortures is notably detected .... Butthis is not the aspect of the work I should like to review. Scot breaksthe connection between heresy, satanism and the like with witchcraftby denying the presence of any doctrine or esoteric system of thought.Witchcraft and magic are entirely reducible to actions, and it is onlyignorance of their trickery that leads to the imputation ofsupernaturalism: “these are not supernaturall actions but the devisesof men” (XIII.34, 199). Hence, his favorite vocabulary for describingthe activities of witches and magicians are forms of the verb ‘cozen,’a verb first attested in English in 1561,23 only twenty-three yearsearlier than Scot’s work, carrying the sense of ‘to cheat,’ ‘to defraudby deceit.’ Thus, towards the end of his work, Scot defines witchcraftas “in truth a cousening art” (XVI.2, 274), a “cunning consist[ting]onlie in deluding and deceiving the people ... By slight and devises;without the assistance of anie divell or spirit, saving the spirit ofcousenage” (XVI.3, 275). For the same reason, Scot publishes morespells and magical texts (e.g., XI.15, 116-17; XII.7, 127 - XII.22, 161;XV.4, 226 - XV.20, 251) than most of his contemporaries in witch-craft studies.24 Words are of interest to Scot only if thoroughly em-bedded in actions (e.g., XIII.26, 187). By the same token, for Scot, anexposure of the mechanisms, of the slight-of-hand involved in magicaldeeds is, at the same time a demonstration of their theological inno-cence. Indeed, by his account, if anyone be guilty of heresy, it is mostlikely the accusers of witches who thereby deny that God and Christalone are the authors of miraculous deeds. “God onlie worketh great 23 Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. ‘cozen,’ see further, ‘cosenage,’ ‘cozening.’ TheOED does not cite Scot for any of its examples of this word-family. 24 I have not been able to obtain a copy of Isaac Rabboteau (pseudonym forPhilip van Marnix), The Bee Hive of the Romische Churche, Wherein the Author, a zealousProtestant, under the person of a superstitious Papist, doth so driely retell the gross opinions of Popery... (London, 1579), in its 2nd ed., edited by Abraham Fleming (London, 1580) whichScot appears to use as a source for many of these texts. See the marginal note on p.131, and see further the persistent maginal notes accompanying many spells,“Englished by Abraham Fleming.”"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"       wonders” (I.1, 2); the accusers “flie from trusting in God to trusting inwitches” (I.5, 7).Scot begins with witchcraft accusations, noting that “some otherthings might naturallie be the occasion and cause of such calamitiesas witches are supposed to bring” (I.6, 8; cf. II.10,19). Real poisons(or “meere poisons” [VI.6, 69]) may account for illnesses of deaths“commonlie attributed to witches charms” (VI.4, 68). The physiologi-cal effects resulting from intercourse with Incubi may, in fact, be“naturall” or “bodilie” disease (IV.11, 49). While witches are accusedof casting spells to prevent butter being churned, Scot knows, fromactual experiments, that if one puts a little soap or sugar in the churn,it will never produce butter (I.4, 6).However, he clearly is more interested in actual trickery. In thecase of an accused witch in Westwell, “the fraud was found,” “theillusion manifestlie disclosed,” to wit, “all hir diabolicall speech wasbut ventriloquie and plaine cousenage” (VII.2, 74). Ventriloquismmay likewise account for Samuel’s appearance in the biblical witch ofEndor narrative (VII.13, 84), in the same way as Boniface VIII“cousened” the papacy from Celestine V, having “counterfetted avoice through a cane as though it had come from heaven” (XV.40,270).Similarly, he spends considerable time exposing the sleight-of-hand trickery in “naturall magicke” (esp. XIII.12, 174) and“alcumysterie” (XIV.1, 204 - XIV.7, 214). But the heart of his workis a “tract of the art of juggling,” an eighteen page treatise, withillustrations, on magic in all its senses ranging from parlor tricks withballs and coins to the apparatus employed to produce grand illusionssuch as heads being cut off (XIII.21, 181 - XIII.34, 199). In each caseit is a device, a mechanism, a skill, a manual activity, a “nimbleconveiance of the hand” (XIII.22, 182)—léger de main, presti-digita-tion, in the strict sense of those terms—that accomplishes the ‘won-der,’ while, from the perspective of the duped viewers, the magicians“with words seeme to doo the fact” (XIII.26, 187). One of his sim-plest examples will suffice:To make a little ball swell in your hand till it be verie great: Take a veriegreat ball in your left hand or three different big balles, and shewing oneor three little balles, seeme to put them into your left hand, concealing (asyou may well doo) the other balles which were there in before; then usewords, and make then seeme to swell, and open your hand, &c.

He bringsthe matter under discussion down to modern times; indeed he raisesit in the first two paragraphs of the first volume of the work:The Hermetica dealt with in this book may be described as ‘those Greekand Latin writings which contain religious or philosophic teachings as-cribed to Hermes Trismegistus.’ It does not much matter whether we say‘religious’ or ‘philosophic’ .... There is, besides these, another class ofdocuments, the contents of which are ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus;namely, writings concerning astrology, magic, alchemy, and kindredforms of pseudo-science. [These things might be grouped together underthe vague but convenient term ‘occult arts and sciences.’] But in thecharacter of their contents these latter differ fundamentally from theformer ....[T]hey were of a very different mental calibre; and it is in mostcases easy to decide at a glance whether a given document is to beassigned to the one class or to the other. We are therefore justified intreating the ‘religious’ or ‘philosophic’ Hermetica as a class apart, and,for our present purpose, ignoring the masses of rubbish which fall underthe other head. (1:1 and n. 2)Thus, the authors of the Corpus Hermetica were “men who hadreceived some instruction in Greek philosophy ... And sought to buildup, on a basis of Platonic doctrine, a philosophic religion that wouldbetter satisfy their needs” (1:1-2), a Platonic doctrine “modified, invarious degrees, by the infusion of a Stoic ingredient” (1:9). One ofthe two most noteworthy features of the collection, taken as a whole:is the absence of theurgia—that is, of ritualism, or sacramentalism. Thenotion of the efficacy of sacramental rites, which filled so large a placeboth in the religion of the Christians and in that of the adherents of thePagan mystery-cults, is (with quite insignificant exceptions) absentthroughout these Hermetica. (1:8; cf. 4:74).And again:the votaries of these [mystery] cults stood, for the most part, on a farlower intellectual level than the Hermetists, and their devotion to the 33 The review by Reitzenstein appeared in Gnomon 1 (1925) 249-53.

(1:11)For this reason, in his review of previous scholarship, C. F. G.Heinrici’s work (posthumously edited by E. Von Dobschutz), DieHermes-Mystic und das Neue Testament (Leipzig, 1918) comes under par-ticular attack for its employment of the category ‘mysticism.’ If theterm means “aspiration towards union with God, there is much inour Hermetica; but of the sacramentalism of the Pagan mystery-cults,and of theurgia in general, there is hardly anything.” These two areillegitimately combined by Heinrici under the vague designation“Mystik,” ignoring that the two “have in reality little or nothing incommon” (1:48). One might observe that Scott likewise combines avariety of phenomena under the single term theurgia. We have alreadyencountered as synonymous: “astrology, magic, alchemy,” “pseudo-science,” “occult arts and science,” “ritualism,” “sacramentalism,”and “quasi-magical operations.” In his longest discussion of theurgy,in the notes to Iamblichus, Abammonis ad Porphyrium Responsum, hewrites of “theurgic or sacramental rites” (4.72, 87, 95), “sacramentalinitiations” (4:79), “[theurgic] rites of initiation” (4:87, 88, 92-93).The phenomenon Scott points to, the lack of explicit magical materi-als in the collected tractates is, of course, correct, although it is amisleading observation when he extends the category to include all“ritualistic” or “sacramental” references. His explanation is inad-equate, more representative of one sort of classicist’s disdain than ofany thought out interpretative position. Theurgy, in Scott’s sense ofthe term, is simply not ‘classy.’ Therefore it can be categorized as“rubbish” produced by individuals of a “far lower intellectual cali-bre.” Where he does recognize ritual interest is largely in the LatinAsclepius, a text Scott understands as being, in parts, more influencedby Egyptian thought than by Greek (3:1-300, esp. 3:52, 112-15, 154-66, 274), a position made complicated by his involved redactionalhypotheses and his notion that, in sections, “we have to deal with atext which has been cut to pieces and shuffled like a deck of cards”(3:103).The consequences of Scott’s rejection of ritual action (i.e., in histerm theurgia) are severe. For example, for him, the word, ‘myster-ies,’ “contains no suggestion that a theurgic or sacramental operationis about to take place; it merely signifies a doctrine which is holy, andhas hitherto been known to a few. The word itself does not necessar-ily imply that the hearer is under any obligation to keep the doctrinesecret from others” (3:103). Thus, it is not surprising that he insists, in"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"  ‒   his interpretation of Tractate XIII, that ‘rebirth’ is to be understoodas a “metaphor or figure” (2:373) which was probably borrowed:the Platonists in general were not accustomed to employ the metaphor of‘rebirth’ .... The group of Hermetists to which the author of Corp. XIIIbelonged probably got this conception either from the Christians, whoheld that men are reborn by the sacrament of baptism, or from somePagan mystery-cult in which men were held to be reborn by a sacramen-tal operation. But the author of Corp. XIII rejects all theurgia, as did theHermetists in general; and, accordingly, while adopting the notion ofrebirth, he differs both from the Christians and from the adherents ofthose Pagan mystery-cults in which a rebirth was spoken of, in that hedoes not regard palingenesia as effected by any sacramental action. (2:374)In this dialogue, as in the Hermetica in general, there is no trace of anysacramental action .... (2:387)While he does invite the reader of XIII, once, to “compare” a phrasein PGM, no consequences result from this comparison (2:395), nor isthere any “need to infer” in another passage “that the writer [of XIII]adhered to the old Egyptian belief in the magical or sacramentalefficacy of verbal formulae” (2:406; cf. 3:52).Similarly, it is not at all surprising to find in Scott’s edited Greektext that he brackets, without comment, the word ‘magic’ in thecombination “philosophy and magic” in Stobaei Hermetica fragment 23(1:495; 3:556-57), which signifies that the word occurs in the manu-scripts and their presumed archetype, but one which, in Scott’s opin-ion, was “either certainly or probably not present in the text as writ-ten by the author” (1:24). The combination, “philosophy and magic,”in SH 23, is a central text in the arguments of scholars such as G.Fowden who seek a more holistic understanding of the Hermetictradition as combining both technical and philosophical enterprises,attributing the excision of technical material from the philosophicalHermetica to “Byzantine [Christian] bowdlerizing.” Fowden assertsthat “there could be nothing more characteristically late antique thanthis idea of philosophy and magic [in SH 23] as nourishers of thesoul.”34Finally, given Scott’s view of “the gibberish of the magical papyri”(3:52), it is predictable that, unlike much contemporary scholarship,he would but rarely cite materials from PGM. While the index isneither exhaustive nor accurate, it correctly lists eleven occasions onwhich Scott turns to the magical papyri. Five of these are exclusivelyphilological (2:41, 92; 3:188-89, 378; 4:74); one notes hymnic syllabicand accentual parallels (2:415); three indicate parallels of thought 34 G.

His only sustained interest in magical texts is his meticulouscomparison of PGM 3:591-609 to Asclepius 41 (1:374-76; 3:384-309)—recalling that he did not have available to him Nag Hammadi CodexVI.7, 63-65. Scott finds the magical text a later “inaccurate tran-script” of the hermetic hymn, explaining that the “sorcerers,” hispersistent term for the writers of magical texts (cf. 2:415),were accustomed to make up their incantations partly out of passagesextracted from books of religious rituals, or other religious writings, withlittle regard for the meaning of these passages in their original context(3:284). The object at which the sorcerers aimed in composing theirinvocations was not to transmit a correct text of any such hymn orprayer, but merely to produce something that would sound impressive totheir customers, who must have been mostly ignorant or stupid people.As long as that purpose was served, it mattered little to them whether thewords which they wrote down meant this or that, or had no meaning atall. They were perfectly free to alter, to omit, to add things out of theirown heads and to patch together scraps taken from different sources; andthey did so without scruple. This ought to be borne in mind in dealingwith such documents as the Mithraic Apathanatismos (Dieterich’sMithrasliturgie), for example (3:284 n. 3).Great Scott!I have used the first two Scot[t]s to illustrate the most generalconsequences of a decision to treat magical phenomena aspreeminently a matter of either thought or action, the former de-manding an explanation, the latter inviting unmasking. The Scott ofthe Hermetica allows us to record some accounting of the costs ofsuch a decision in a work of professional scholarship which, in thiscase, having chosen thought and belief, entails the deletion of wordsand the reorganization of the received Greek and Latin texts in orderto expunge or obscure any reference to magical activities, the inter-pretative consequences for the understanding of particular passages ofdenying all actual ritual elements, the limitation of the sorts of com-parative materials that might be deployed, as well as the overall fail-ure to address adequately the significant question of the familial rela-tionships of the Corpus to the wider range of Hermetic literatures andtraditions which has engaged modern scholars from Reizensteinthrough Festugière to Jean-Pierre Mahé and G. Fowden and hasresulted in interesting and diverse proposals which have served asfruitful stimuli to further research.The issue we have been contemplating under the trope of Scot[t]is, of course, endemic as an etic distinction in the study of religions ofLate Antiquity whether it be denominated under the dual terminol-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"  ‒   ogy, employed for the Hermetica of ‘philosophical-religious’ in oppo-sition to the ‘occult’ or ‘theurgic’ (Scott), the ‘philosophical’ and the‘technical’ (Fowden) or the ‘learned’ and the ‘popular” (Festugière),or as expressed in the wholesale distinctions, characteristic of Protes-tant polemic scholarship, between the ‘mysteries’ and ‘primitive’Christianities which were reviewed in Drudgery Divine.35 It also appearsas an emic distinction in some sorts of Late Antique texts, such as thatbetween ‘philosophy’ and the ‘priestly arts’ (Olympiodorus), between‘theology’ and ‘theurgy’ (attributed to Julian the Theurgist), or be-tween ‘theoretical philosophy’ and ‘theurgy’ (Iamblichus).36The same sorts of distinctions prevail in other areas of the study ofreligion, most especially in cognate fields such as Late Roman philo-sophical schools, Renaissance Hermeticism and contemporary occultmovements. For example, since the early fourteenth century, somecircles of Jewish mysticism maintain the emic distinction between‘speculative’ or ‘theoretical kabbalah’ (kabbalah iyyunit) and ‘practicalkabbalah’ (kabbalah ma’asit), the latter counterdistinguished frommodes of forbidden ‘wisdom’ (hokhmah hizonah; hokhmah benei kedem) i.e.,from ‘magic’ (kishuf). The history of scholarship in this area provides acautionary tale of the capacity for the etic replication of these divi-sions through a series of descending bifurcations. To briefly allude towhat it is, in fact, a more complex narrative, Gershom Scholem quiterightly insisted on the systemic coherence of what he termed ‘Jewishmysticism’ over against the rationalist critiques and dismissals of thesame phenomena characteristic of nineteenth century Jewishhistoriography. Although not entirely neglected, the action elements 35 Scott, Hermetica 1:1, et passim; Fowden, Egyptian Hermes 1-11, 116-20, et passim;A. J.

Moshe Idel is, perhaps, themost prominent member of the next generation of scholars who haveworked to correct Scholem’s emphases at precisely this point. (I canthink of no better illustration of the distance between Scholem’s andIdel’s approach than to compare their respective treatments of thefigure of the Golem).37 Yet, Idel reifies the same sorts of divisions. In1988, the distinction was between “theosophical-theurgic” or“Sefirotic kabbalah” and “ecstatic kabbalah.” In 1990, it was theduality between “elite magic” and “popular magic,” the former sub-divided into “Spanish” and “Italian kabbalah,” with each reflecting adifferent theory of magic. In his most sustained meditation on thetheme, in 1995, he returned to the distinction “theosophical-theurgic” and “ecstatic,” now adding a third category, counter-distinguished from the first two, that of the “talismanicmagical.”38 Ineach of these successive pairs, the first term is oriented towards beliefand thought; the second, to action and ritual.The issues as to thought and action with respect to magic raised bythe various scholars we have reviewed are surely not resolvable at thelevel of data—all have more than enough. They also entail more thanthe well-known problems attendant on the definition of ‘magic.’39The relationship of thought and action can only be confronted at thelevel of theory, in which the understanding of magic is a derivative ofa larger set of issues, especially those implicated in the construction ofan adequate theory of ritual.Catherine Bell begins her important study, Ritual Theory, RitualPractice (1992) by noting the persistent duality:Theoretical descriptions of ritual generally regard it as action and thusautomatically distinguish it from the conceptual aspects of religion, suchas beliefs, symbols, and myths. In some cases added qualifications maysoften the distinction, but rarely do such descriptions question this imme-diate differentiation or the usefulness of distinguishing what is thought 37 G.

Just as the differentiation of ritual and belief interms of thought and action is usually taken for granted so too is thepriority this differentiation accords to thought.40I suspect that the adoption of speech-act theory, and, most especially,the categories of “performative utterances” and “illocutionary force”by so many students of both ritual and magic is one attempt toovercome this duality,41 although I am not at all certain but that thegenerating distinction between constatives and performatives is not areinscription of the same duality.For myself, recognizing at the outset its genealogy from Tylor andFrazer, but recognizing as well that Frazer’s categories of “homeo-pathic” and “contagious magic” have been satisfyingly described, byRoman Jakobson, as a general theory of cognition and language,under the rubrics of “metaphor” and “metonymy.” I continue to findinteresting revisionary understandings of what has been termed, sinceEvans-Pritchard, the “intellectualist interpretation of magic,” inwhich thought is placed on both sides of the putative dichotomy.42That is to say, I have been concerned with the intellectual dimensionsof ritual, primarily in terms of structures of placement and difference,and processes of transposition. The capacity to alter common denota-tions in order to enlarge potential connotations within the boundariesof ritual is one of the features that marks off its space as ‘sacred.’Transposition is a paradigmatic process set within the largelysyntagmatic series of actions which characterize ritual. The respectsin which a “this” might, under some circumstances, and only withinthe confines of ritual space, be a “that” give rise to thought whichplays across the gap of like and unlike. Here it is “this,” there it is“that.” Seen from this perpsective, ritual transposition is a primarymode of thoughtfully exploring the systematics of difference. Themost famous ethnographic example of transposition is surely theNuer sacrifice as reported by Evans-Pritchard: 40 C.

In what follows, I intend to take up Markus’ point ofdeparture and show that there were several different pre-Augustiniantheories of magic already present in Greek and Roman thinking.There were more ancient theories of magic than those which Markustook into account, and Augustine’s own theory was not as neglectedas Markus supposes.1IThe enquiry best begins with Apuleius who, in his Apology, gives noless than three definitions of what is a magus: First, he is a priest in thelanguage of the Persians, secondly, he is a specialist involved in theeducation of a Persian prince to whom he teaches the correct ways ofcult and of royal behavior (for which Apuleius cites Plato as hissource2); and, finally, in what Apuleius calls the vulgar definition (morevulgari), “a magus is someone who, through the community of speechwith the immortal gods, possesses an incredible power of spells foreverything he wishes to do.”3 While the first two definitions are virtu- 1 Robert A.

The thirddefinition deserves more attention since it is similar to a theory ofhow magic works. The basis of magic is the community of speechbetween human and superhuman beings, “immortal gods”, and itsspecific agents are the spells, cantamina. Again, there does not seem tobe an indication of exactly what makes magic work as magic, sincecommunity of speech between humans and gods is also indispensablefor the function of prayer. The only specificity lies in the words,cantamina instead of preces, and the designation of an incredible power,vis incredibilis.But Apuleius is not really interested in this definition—or he isinterested only insofar as it shows the inconsistencies in the behaviorof his opponents, who accuse him of that which they should be afraid:a single spell of Apuleius could stop the entire trial. Somewhat later,though, he comes back to a variation of this same definition, relyingagain on the opinion of the many, the laymen (imperiti), in their mis-representation of philosophers: they distinguish between the philoso-phers who are irreligious and interested only in natural causes (likeAnaxagoras or the atomists), and those who are overly interested inthe workings of divine providence, those whom the people perceive asmagi, sorcerers (like Orpheus, Pythagoras or Empedocles4). What con-stitutes a magician, again, is his unusual closeness to the divinesphere. This definition reflects current Greco-Roman thinking: magichas its foundation in the possibility of contact between humans andsuperhuman beings, and its main vehicle is speech, the powerful word(and not ritual, the powerful act). Even Iamblichus, who insists on theimportance of theurgic ritual acts, emphasizes the central role ofprayer in what he calls “the theurgic communion of the gods withmen.”5 Prayer, he says, belongs to any ritual, since prayers “producean indissoluble and sacred communion with the gods”—they initiatecontact with them, bind humans and gods in “concordant commun-ion” (koinvn¤a ımonohtikÆ), and seal the “ineffable unity” (êrrhtowßnvsiw) with them.6 In short, the speech acts are viewed as the mainmeans for creating the theurgic communion.7 At the same time, 4 Ibid. 27,1-3. 5 Iambl. myst. 1,8 (28,6) t∞w yeourgik∞w koinvn¤aw ye«n prÚw ényr≈pouw. 6 Iambl. myst. 5,26 passim (English translation by Thomas Taylor). 7 See also Sarah Iles Johnston, “Rising to the Occasion.

Since in his system there canbe no dichotomy between religion and magic, Iamblichus collapsesall differences between the two. The speech acts are prayers, notspells, they are eÈxa¤, not cantamina.In his discussion, Apuleius does not follow his own definition butrather the most culturally widespread definition. He focuses on inten-tion: distinguishing between the philosophers, on the one hand, andthe professional healers—the doctors and the sorcerers—on theother, he stresses the fact that the healers heal only for monetarygain.8 This is an entirely different type of theory, but of course it is theonly theory which is likely to be effective for Apuleius. He did notinvent this theory: the greed of sorcerers and diviners is a stock motifwhich appears as early as Attic tragedy.9 Later, Origen gives it aninteresting new twist: defending Jesus’ miracles against Celsus’ com-parison of them with the deeds of ordinary sorcerers, Origen focuseson Jesus’ intention to better the human race and make people praiseGod, to which he opposes the egotistic and fundamentally evil waysof the sorcerers (gÒhtew10). Their art relies wholly on the help of paganevil demons, and the “worship of demons is not our business.”11 Thisalso illustrates how the two theories are not mutually exclusive.IISo much for Apuleius. The two main theories of magic in antiquitywhich try to do away with magic altogether and confirm the central-ity of the concept of communion between humans and gods as theworking basis of magic—are the theory Plato sketches in the Lawsand the more elaborate and sophisticated theory Augustine presents 8 Apul.

The latter had been the main object ofMarkus’ paper.In book II of his work, which opens with a long discussion of signs,Augustine addresses pagan superstition, from idolatry via magic to allsorts of divinatory beliefs and practices. All this, he says, “results fromthe pernicious consociation of men and demons which has been insti-tuted as an untrustworthy and devious friendship.”12 These demonsare the followers of the prime fallen angel, the trickster and liar Sa-tan. This association works on the basis “of a language which iscommon to both humans and demons” and whose signs have beenchosen by the demons in order to catch the humans.”13 But the signsof language, Augustine insists, like the signs of the alphabet, arepurely conventional, having been agreed upon by the members of aspecific language community: “All these signs move the souls accord-ing to the conventions of each group, and as the conventions aredifferent, the effects upon the soul are different: people did not agreeabout the specific meanings of the signs because the signs already hadthose meanings, but they have the specific meaning because peopledid agree upon it.”14 Since this is true for every language community,it is valid also for the community which unites men and demons. Butthis semiotic approach has an important corollary: as soon as onedecides to cancel the convention, communication becomes impossi-ble; and since Christians are not supposed to consort with demons (asPaul insisted: 1 Cor 10:20), they no longer share a common languagewith them. Magic, then, is impossible for a Christian, as is divinationand all other rites which rely upon the shared language conventionswith the demons. Augustine goes on to show that the model of lan-guage is equally valid for gestures, rituals, and images.15This means that Augustine does not radically question the validityand function of magic as based on the commerce with demons. Nordoes he question the functioning of divination as being caused bydemons, as set out in his highly interesting little piece Divination throughDemons, which had been triggered by the oracles surrounding the 12 Augustine, doctr. 2,36 ex quadam pestifera societate hominum et daemonumquasi pacta infidelis et dolosae amicitiae constituta. 13 Ibid. 2,37. 14 Ibid., 2,37 ergo hae omnes significationes pro suae cuiusque societatisconsensione animos movent et, quia diversa significatio est, diverse movent, nec ideoconsenserunt in eas homines quia iam valebant ad significationem, sed ideo valentquia consenserunt in eas. 15 Ibid., 2,38."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"    destruction of the Alexandrian Serapeum.”16 Similarly, Paul does notquestion the validity of sacrifices to pagan gods; but, just as Paulpoints out that, to a Christian, those gods are actually demons, andforbids Christians to be partners with demons (1 Cor 10:20). Augus-tine shows how easily a Christian can interrupt any commerce withthem by renouncing the common language. This must mean thatAugustine speaks of more than just the ordinary language commu-nity—magic does not function because humans and demons under-stand Greek or Latin or Coptic, but because there is a special rituallanguage whose use is confined to magic, as in Apuleius’ “spells ofincredible power,” and whose efficiency relies mainly of the use ofstrange words, the voces magicae. Augustine does not present an entirelynew theory of magic (as Markus implies), but rather applies his newsemiotic theory of language to the traditional definition of magic (tocite Apuleius again) as based on communio loquendi cum dis.IIIIn his Laws, Plato too argues against magic. But unlike Augustine, atleast at first glance, he does not subsume it under the heading ofsuperstition, but under farmake¤a, “poisoning.” In the loosely struc-tured collection of laws in book XI, when Plato presents his lawagainst farmake¤a, he differentiates between two forms of the offense,the use of poisonous substances, what we might call physical poison-ing, and the use of spells.17 We might call this latter use psychologicalpoisoning, since magical spells, as Plato understands them, rely onpsychological means based on ritual action, on “enchantment andcharms and so-called bindings spells,”18 in order to persuade (pe¤yein)or, rather, to frighten: “When they [the victims of magical spells] seewaxen figures at their doors, on the crossroads or on the graves oftheir parents,” they are convinced that someone is directing a harm-ful force against them. As an enlightened philosopher, Plato wouldprefer to dispell those fears by explaining what magic really is, but(typically for the Laws) he has given up the hope that such an act ofeducation would succeed: “Of this and all which is similar to it, it isnot easy to know what its nature is, and it is difficult, when one knowsit, to convince others [...]. Since the souls of people are full of distrusttowards each other in this respect, it is not worthwhile to try to 16 Augustine, De divinatione daemonum, in: CSEL 41. 17 Plato, legg., 11,932 Eff. 18 Ibid., 11.933A maggane¤aiw tis‹n ka‹ §pvida›w ka‹ katad°sesi legom°naiw."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"  ‒   persuade them and [...] to exhort them to neglect these things, giventhat they don’t have a clear idea about them.”19 Magic, then, seemsto function only because people can be made to fear it, and they canbe frightened because they have no clear knowledge and, even worse,they are full of distrust towards each other. In a friendlier society,where people trust each other, one may suppose, it might be wellworth the effort explaining how magic functions, and as a result,magic in such a society would cease to exist altogether.In the Laws, Plato thus refrains from explaining what magic reallyis. Two additional passages, though, clarify his thinking. He dealswith religious laws (book X) and, among other things, with the ques-tion of impiety, és°beia. He distinguishes between two basic types ofnon-believers. On the one hand, there are the less harmful ones who,although having moral standards, assume that either there are nogods at all, or that they do not care for humans, or that they can bebought by lavish gifts. On the other hand, there are the dangerousnon-believers who have no independent moral standards at all anduse their erroneous beliefs about the gods for profit: “Those peoplehave become animal-like (yhri≈deiw), in addition to not recognizingthe existence of gods, or assuming that they would not care for theworld or could be bought off. They take everyone for a fool, andmany a man they delude during his life: by pretending that, after hisdeath, they could conjure up his spirit, and by promising to influencethe gods through the alleged magic powers of sacrifices and prayersand charms (yus¤aiw ka‹ eÈxa›w ka‹ §pvida›w), they try to wreck com-pletely entire homes and states for filthy lucre.”20 Not that they wouldbe able to do what they promise: given the essential goodness of thedivine, the gods cannot be misused for those practices—but people,with their muddled ideas about the divine beings, nevertheless believethat they could. The same reasoning appeared already in the Republicin the context of a discussion about whether the gods could be influ-enced by gifts, in the famous passage about the “begging priests andsoothsayers,” égÊrtai ka‹ mãnteiw, who “go to rich men’s doors andmake them believe (pe¤yousi) that by means of sacrifices and incanta-tions they have accumulated a treasure of power from the gods [...]and that, if a man wishes to harm an enemy, at slight cost he will beenabled to injure just and unjust alike, since they are masters of spellsand enchantments that constrain the gods to serve their ends.21 19 Ibid., 933AB taËtÉ oÔn ka‹ per‹ tå toiaËta sÊmpanta oÎte =ãidiÒn ̃pvw pot¢p°fuken gin≈skein, oÎtÉ e‡ tiw gno¤h pe¤yein eÈpet¢w •t°rouw. 20 Plato, legg. 10, 909 AB (translation modified after T.J. Saunders, Harmonds-worth 1970)."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"    Again, those specialists do not have any real power over the gods andtheir goodness, but they have the power of persuasion to make theirvictims believe that they really possess such gifts and powers.Plato thus is much more radical than Augustine. Magic—which, inhis time, means virtually only binding spells, the katad°seiw men-tioned particularly in the Republic and the Laws—exists and seems tohave power over the minds of its victims, but magic does so notbecause its practitioners are able to manipulate divine powers to theirevil ends but because they manipulate human minds by their decep-tive rituals and spells. Magic is a psychological and, in the last in-stance, a social problem, typical for an ailing society; the gods do notenter here. The communication between humans and gods, in whosereality both clients and victims of the sorcerers believe, does not reallytake place. While Augustine thought that telecommunication betweenmen and gods was, in fact, possible, and so he “cut the cable betweenthe telephones” in order to stop it, Plato considers that sorcerers talkinto fake phones. This, of course, makes sense—although for bothauthors magic is wrong religion, Plato unlike Augustine had only oneset of gods to which he could turn.Augustine, though, uses a second concept as well, one which wemight call sociological. In De doctrina Christiana, he brings it into hissemiotic approach, while in earlier works, especially De diversisquaestionibus (whose question 79 deals with the problem why Phar-aoh’s magicians could have been successful), he made it his maintheoretical tool.22 This theory is based on a highly idiosyncratic dis-tinction between public and private. There are “imaginary signs,” hesays in De doctrina Christiana, which induce people to worship imagesor other parts of God’s creation or to make use of specific cures. Butthese signs have not been given by God to humankind publicly; hu-mans use them in pursuit of their private interests. That is, there isthe sphere of official, public ritual and cult. It is public, as Augustinesays, because it is given and validated by God himself, which alsomeans that it is performed in public places and by the entire congre-gation, i.e. by the entire Christian society, and because there are theSacred Writings which can be used to control the correctness of thecult. There are also the numerous private rituals which no one cancontrol and which serve individual, private and egotistic goals only:“Every soul is the purer in piety the less it enjoys private things, looksupon the Universal Law and follows this law reverently and voluntar- 21 Plato, Rep., 2, 364 BC (translation after Paul Shorey, Loeb edition). 22 See also Enarr. in psalm. 103, 2, 11."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"  ‒   ily; this Universal Law is God’s Wisdom.”23 The more one gives in toprivate motives, the more one becomes the prey of demons: privaterituals, for Augustine, are exclusively pagan rituals (theoretically, theycould also be heretical rites). Since the basic text, 1 Cor. 10:20, isalways present in his mind, these rites are rites addressed to de-mons—in short, such rites are magical in the larger sense of the word.This opposition between private und public reflects the state of affairsafter the abolition of pagan sacrifice and cult through Theodosius IIin the 390s. After his edicts, pagan rites survived only in the shadowof private houses, well outside the visibility of Christian zealots.24Magic thus is understood as illegitimate and private religion, which isa view that is not Augustine’s alone, but is current in the Roman legaltradition. Commenting on Dido’s remark in Aeneid 4,492f. (“I swearthat I took up the craft of magic against my will”25 ), Servius re-marked that “the Romans, though accepting many foreign rites, al-ways rejected magic”.26 Augustine knows both the verse and its impli-cations.27IVThe third strand of theory about magic is best exemplified byPlotinus, who treats several loosely connected problems in a treatiseentitled Unsolved Questions of Psychology (Per‹ cux∞w épor¤ai; Enneads4,4). Among them is the question whether the heavenly bodies, asanimated beings, have a memory. Plotinus tackles the problem byasking himself whether the heavenly bodies, the planetary gods, re-member earlier prayers; the mechanism of prayer is central to thispart of the discussion (4,4,30-45). But since Plotinus easily glides fromprayer, eÈxÆ, to incantation, gohte¤a, magic becomes prominent inthe second part of his long discussion (40-45). Plotinus’ main thesis isthat heavenly bodies do not need a memory, and prayer is answerednot because the heavenly bodies remember earlier prayers, but, “be-cause one part is in sympathetic connection with another, just as in 23 De div. quaest. 79,1 unaquaeque anima tanto est pietate purgatior quantoprivato suo minus delectata legem universitatis intuetur eique devote ac libenterobtemperat: est enim lex universitatis divina sapientia. 24 See also Markus, op. cit.

Plotinus exploresthis with the help of two images. First, he understands the cosmos asa huge living being. In any living being, input in one place (e.g., theear) causes a reaction in another, seemingly unrelated place (e.g., atoe), which indicates an invisible force connecting the two; in a simi-lar way, two seemingly unrelated parts of the cosmos are connectedby such an invisible force. While this image is rather common andwell known, Plotinus uses the more specific image of a group ofdancers as well: in such a group, every movement is the movement ofan individual and as such subject to the will of this individual, but atthe same time it is subject to a wider, all-embracing rule which gov-erns, by an unseen power, those individual movements.29 Prayer in-serts itself into this structure, it is fulfilled by its introduction into thisinterplay of invisible powers. The stars to which prayers are ad-dressed have neither memory nor intention: “we must admit,” saysPlotinus, “that some influence comes from them with or withoutprayer insofar as they are parts, and parts of one whole”.30Magical spells, which Plotinus’ called “acts of sorcery” (gohte›ai),also function through sympathy. A sorcerer (gÒhw) is someone who haslearned to understand and to use the sympathetic powers inherent inthe cosmos, turning them against his fellow human beings. Thesesympathetic and antipathetic forces in the universe are “the primarywizard and enchanter.”31 Neither spell nor prayer needs “a will thatgrants” (4,4,40): the words attain their goal automatically, as the im-age of the string exemplifies. This also means that demons, as agentsof magic, have no role whatsoever in this system, since magic func-tions between human souls only; Plotinus explicitly discards such arole for demons.32 In the closed system of the cosmos, love works asan attraction between two souls, joining “one soul to another, as ifthey were training together plants set at intervals”; similarly, the sor-cerer is able to make use of those forces of attraction in order to makea love charm work. 28 Plotinus, Enneads, 4, 40, 41 g¤netai tÚ katå tØn eÈxØn sumpayoËw m°rouw m°reigenom°nou, Àsper §n miçi neurçi tetem°nhi (translation after A.H.

As love is an emotionand thus has nothing to do with the rational soul, charms in generalfunction by influencing the non-rational parts of the soul. In thisrespect, charms function like music, a “kind of magic which causes nosurprise; people even like being enchanted, even if this is not exactlywhat they demand from the musicians.”33 This also means that evena sage (spouda›ow) can be touched by magic in the non-intellectualparts of his soul, although he also is able to counteract a magicalattack through his intellectual soul. This explains the stories we hearabout neoplatonist philosophers who are able to counteract magicalattacks. Plotinus himself, according to Porphyry, counteracted theattacks of a jealous colleague vexing him with stomach-aches,34 andthe philosopher Maximus of Ephesus was able to defend his pupilSosipatra against an unwanted attack of erotic magic.35This theory has two consequences for our understanding of magic.The predominant one is this: magic relies on forces which are activein the closed system of the cosmos and which create bonds betweentwo different parts of it. In a certain sense, Plotinus insists, magic itselfis such a force. If specified, its limitation is that it acts only on thenon-intellectual part of the soul. For the rest, nothing in this power perse makes it magical or non-magical—Plotinus emphasizes this by call-ing magical any force which exerts an influence on the non-intellec-tual part of the soul, especially in the non-philosopher, the personwho follows practical pursuits in his life and who, driven by his non-rational soul, is a victim of magic: “In general, to be actively occupiedwith the semblance of the truth and drawn towards it in any way ischaracteristic of someone who has been deluded by the forces whichdraw one to the lower world: this is what the magic of nature does.”36The only human being who cannot be touched by magic is the abso-lutely contemplative person, the ideal and perfect philosopher: “Con-templation alone stands untouched by magic.”37 What constitutes 33 Ibid., 4, 4, 40 oÈ yaumãzetai ≤ gohte¤a ± toiaÊth: ka¤toi filoËsi khloÊmenoi, kênmØ toËto afit«ntai parå t«n t∞i mousik∞i xrvm°nvn. 34 Porphyry, vita Plotini 10, 1-9. 35 Eunapius, Vitae sophistarum 410-413; the diagnosis is arrived at through a sacri-fice, d‹a sof¤aw yutik∞w. 36 Plot.

To putit slightly differently: when one does away with the demonologicalsuperstructure of magic, magic and religion would collapse were itnot for the different intentions of the practitioners. To return to myformer imagery: in this view, the sorcerer is a specialist who is able“to tap into the phone lines” and use them for his own purpose.This theory has its consequences for the distinction betweenprayer and magic. Basically, there should be no difference of form,only of intention. But of course, a different intention of a speech actmight result in its different form as well. This seems to happen here:when Plotinus explains the specific force of spells, he says: “There is anatural drawing power in spells wrought by the tune and the particu-lar intonation and posture of the magician [...]; for it is not the powerof choice by reason which is charmed, but the irrational soul.”38 Thespecific intention of the spell, directed not at a superhuman being butat a fellow human being, gives it forms which have power over thevictim’s soul; these forms concern both the actual spell, which has aspecific melodiousness and intonation, and its specific performance(“posture”). For Plotinus, a spell thus has different levels of specificity.This view of a spell has more complexity than in those authors, an-cient and modern, who see the only difference in the addition of vocesmagicae.39This passage specifies the way a spell acts upon the human soul,affecting only its non-rational part; Plotinus compares the functioningof the spell with the functioning of music. Thus, his explanation ofmagic by sympathy turns out to be a development of a psychologicaltheory of magic: the sympathy on which magical acts rely functionsonly when the results of magic affect the non-logical, “lower” parts ofthe soul. The only comparable theory we know of is that of Plato; andit can only be Plato on whom Plotinus elaborates, although with thefundamental difference that for Plato magic is a great force of intimi-dation without a real background, while for Plotinus magic exists as aspecial cosmic force. In Plato, as in Plotinus, the demonological (or,rather, theological) superstructure is absent altogether, and magicworks solely through its influence on the victim’s soul. There, accord-ing to the Laws, it causes fear—and fear, of course, is just another 38 Ibid., 4, 4, 40 p°fuke d¢ kå §pvida›w t«i m°lei ka‹ t∞i toiçide ka‹ t«i sxÆmati toËdr«ntow [ ... ], oÈde går ≤ proa¤resiw oÈd¢ ı lÒgow ÍpÚ mousik∞w y°lgetai, éllÉ ≤ êlogowcuxÆ (translation after A.H.

In its basic assumptions, this is alsovalid for Plotinus.VThe results of this study are also useful for the further history oftheorizing on magic. In the Christian monotheist tradition there areonly two ways of dealing with magic. One is to assume that thesorcerers make use of negative superhuman beings which coexist withGod, those pagan gods who now have been unveiled as evil demonsand who either are or are not identical with the fallen angels ofJewish tradition; already in late Hellenistic Judaism, they werethought to have brought magic to their human brides, according tothe Book of Watchers in the Apocalypse of Enoch.40 This perpetuates themost popular Greco-Roman manner of understanding magic, whichwe also noticed in Origen and Augustine.The alternative view, which is represented in the actual Christianspells (which never enlist the help and intercession of demons, butrather of Christ, the Virgin or the Saints), has to rely on the conceptof intention in order to distinguish magic and religion. An invocationto the Virgin is religious when made with good intentions, but magi-cal when used with evil intentions. In the later tradition, at least inwhat has been called the intellectualist theory of magic (the Tylor/Frazer model), intention remains the key concept.41 Scholars who donot follow Frazer’s individualism and intellectualism, like MarcelMauss, have to fall back on the dichotomy between public and pri-vate taken up by Augustine from its Roman legal roots. To this day,in some quarters, especially in the study of the science of antiquity,magic tends to be conceptualized as the idiosyncratic and private ritesnot controlled by the public “religion.” 40 For a general account of the tradition, see James C. VanderKam, Enoch and theGrowth of an Apocalyptic Tradition (Catholic Biblical Quarterly. Monograph Ser. 16;Washington D.C. 1984); idem., Enoch. A Man for All Generations, (Columbia, S.

My English manuscript was, for that occasion, translatedinto German, printed and published without the author being allowed to check theresults of any of these processes. The deplorable result was that various passagesturned out to be incomprehensible due to misinterpretations, misprints or otherdisasters. I am grateful to the editors of the present volume for granting me theopportunity of publishing a new version of the paper in English and in particular toPaul Mirecki for patiently correcting my English. The paper was intended for ageneral readership of non-specialists, and I have not changed its original character.1In the survey of the contents which he added to his book, he had promised tofocus on the medical application of these carmina (for the various Latin terms for‘charm’ see: A. Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche in Texten der römischen und früh-mittelalterlichen Medizin”, in: G. Sabbah [ed.], Études de médécine romaine [St. Étienne1988] 113-56, esp. 137 n.7; cf. A.-M. Tupet, “Rites magiques dans l’antiquitéromaine”, ANRW II.16.3 [1986] 2591-2675), and to inquire “whether in the actionof healing there is a certain power in words” (an sit in medendo verborum aliqua vis).However, he soon gives up this restriction and sets out to discuss various types ofritual formulas including both ritual prayer and (magical) incantation. On this pas-sage see: Th. Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen: römische Religion bei Plinius Maior (Mu-nich 1972) 24 n.10, and passim in his first chapter. In defense of Köves-Zulauf, A.Bäumer, “Die Macht des Wortes in Religion und Magie (Plin. NH 28, 4-29)”, Hermes112 (1984) 84-99, argues that Pliny in an implicit manner betrays more coherencethan scholars tend to grant him, and that his true opinion is that indeed words dohave power. On the relationship between beneficial and harmful carmina, esp. inPliny, see: A.M. Addabbo, “Carmen magico e carmen religioso”, Civiltà classica e cristiana12 (1991) 11-28; F. Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (Cambridge Mass. 1997) 49-56,who notes that Pliny does not call Cato’s cure ‘magical’ as opposed to other artificescollected in book 30, which he does list under the notion magic, being fraudulentissimaartium: “the most fraudulent of all disciplines”."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"  ‒   lent: individually the more educated people reject belief in these prac-tices. On the whole, however, in normal life it pervades everything allthe time, though unconsciously (Sed viritim sapientissimi cuiusque respuitfides, in universum vero omnibus horis credit vita nec sentit). The ambivalenceof this phrase betrays the ambivalence of its author. For on the onehand, time and again he derides these magical formulas as supersti-tious and ridiculous (NH 30, 1ff.; 27, 267: “most people believe thathailstorms can be averted by means of a charm, the words of which Iwould not for my own part venture seriously to introduce into mybook”), on the other hand, throughout his book, he cannot resistmentioning various situations that require the serious and preciseapplication of precationes.2If we wish to have an idea what Pliny had in mind when speakingof these “powerful healing words” no example is more illuminativethan a famous passage from Cato the Censor, who lived two centuriesbefore Pliny and whose magical charm is also referred to by Pliny.3Cato was very good at powerful words, as Carthage was to experi-ence, but he had more strings to his bow. In his almanac for thegentleman farmer De agri cultura 160, he explains what to do when aperson (or an animal) suffers from a dislocation:“Take a green reed four or five feet long and split it down in the middle.And let two men hold it to the hips. Begin to chant: Moetas vaeta dariesdardaries asiadarides una petes (or: motas vaeta daries dardares astatariesdissunapiter) until they meet. Brandish an iron knife(?) over them, andwhen the reeds meet so that one touches the other, grasp with the handand cut right and left. If the pieces are applied to the dislocation or thefracture, it will heal. And nonetheless chant every day, and in the case ofdislocation in this manner, if you wish: Huat, hauat, huat ista pista sistadannabo dannaustra (or huat, haut, haut istasis tarsis ardannabou dannaustra).”This is one of the most discussed texts in the field of Roman (magical)cures and incantations.4 Indeed, the text gives rise to a number of2See for instance his curiously ambivalent phrasing in NH 28, 29: “We certainlystill have formulas to charm away hail, various diseases, and burns, some actuallytested by experience (quaedam etiam experta), but I am very shy of quoting them,because of the widely different feelings they arouse (in tanta animorum varietate). Where-fore everyone must form his own opinion about them as he pleases.” About Pliny’sambivalence see: G. Serbat, “La référence comme indice de distance dans l’énoncéde Pline l’Ancien”, Revue de Philologie 47 (1973) 38ff.; A.

First of all it is a perfect instance of the twinstrategies widely applied in this type of medical magic but also,though less commonly, in other types of magical texts, such as cursetexts or defixiones. These two strategies consist of ritual action on the onehand and ritual words on the other. In the present paper I will focusmy attention on the ritual words, but it would do no harm constantlyto keep in mind that words and deeds are often two complementaryand inseparable parts of one ritual process.With respect to the formulaic aspects, the text of Cato gives rise toseveral fundamental questions. First of all, there are two differentversions of the magical formulas, which in our text are twice intro-duced by the words: in alio s. f., which means: in alio codice sic fertur (“inanother manuscript it is thus written...”). We find this phrase alreadyin the oldest known manuscript, now lost but copied in the fifteenthcentury, which means that its author already found different versionsof the two carmina in his model. It is very well possible that bothversions were already juxtaposed in the archetype, as Wessely5 sug-gested.We are here confronted for the first time with a notorious featureof the (magical) charm: the abundance of variants of one type—parallel but different versions of one model. Instead of taking thissymptomatic variation for granted—and hence ignoring it—I will payample attention to this phenomenon since in my view it has a certainbearing on the power and efficacy of the terms under discussion. Solet us keep this in mind. However, there are other, even more basicquestions. The most obvious, also the most controversial, is the fol-lowing: did these formulas contain any retraceable meaning? Fromthe last century onwards radically opposite answers have been givento this question,6 which can be roughly classified into three catego-ries.The first answer is that these words are “purely magical” expres-sions: sounds without any intrinsic secular, that is ‘normal’, meaning.charm”, CJ 45 (1950) 171-6. See also the edition of Cato’s work by R. Goujard (Paris1975) 319 f.; A.-M. Tupet, La magie dans la poésie latine (Paris 1976) 169f.; Tupet,“Rites magiques”, 2596 f.; Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 43-47. In his forthcomingSpells of Wisdom Richard Gordon has another—and novel—interpretation, explainingthe action as a case of tautology and parallelization.5C. Wessely, “Zu Catos Schrift über das Landwesen, cap. CLX”, WS 20(1898) 135-140.6I am restricting myself to modern scholarship here. As a matter of fact, how-ever, all the answers mentioned had already been suggested in antiquity, especially inconnection with the Ephesia grammata to be discussed below. See: K. Preisendanz,“Ephesia Grammata”, RAC V (1962) 515-20."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"  ‒   The words belong to the so-called voces magicae, a term that we shalldiscuss later. They are of the type of abracadabra,7 an expressionwhich certainly has a sense (that is: a function, an objective), butwhich does not make sense: it does not carry a comprehensible, lexicalmeaning. The other two answers both argue that once upon a timethe words must have had a concrete meaning but that this meaning isnow hidden to us. For this unfortunate situation two different reasonsare proposed. One—and this is the second answer referred toabove—is that the magical phrase belongs to a language we do notknow or understand anymore. When dealing with the ancient worldwe need not be surprised that Celtic and Etruscan have both beeneagerly put forward as promising candidates. The implication of thisoption is that we are at a loss: though, originally, the words carried ameaning, this meaning cannot now be traced, since the languagesthey belonged to are not—or not sufficiently—understood by themodern reader, nor were they by the majority of the ancient Ro-mans.The third answer also assumes that the formulas once did containa meaningful message. However, this time the reason why we havenot detected this meaning so far is because we have not tried hardenough. The words belong to an archaic or a dialectical form of theLatin language and can be isolated and analysed with the help of, forinstance, etymological dictionaries, historical linguistics and a gener-ous dash of ingenuity. In this way Paul Thielscher8 managed to‘translate’ most of the terms and phrases of Cato’s charm. Some ofthem, he argues, were addressed to the displaced bone. Dissunapiter isthen a corruption of dis una petes, which means: “take care that, eachfrom your own side, you will reunite”; mota sueta “move yourself toyour accustomed place”, daries dardaries: “give, give yourself” etc.Other scholars had already explained ista pista sista as istam pestem sistat“stop that pestilence”.9I feel no temptation whatsoever to take sides in this endless discus-sion, but I do wish to take the variety of interpretations as a point ofdeparture or rather as a signpost for my own provisional and tenta-7On the origin of this most celebrated magical word see: A.

It willbecome apparent that the profusion of interpretations concerning theCato text is in fact characteristic of magical charms in general. Again,I would suggest not to disregard this but rather take it as a seriouschallenge to inquire if perhaps there is a meaning in this poly-interpretability. After all, the following questions force themselvesupon us:1 if, in origin, the formulas had been understandable—and of semi-nal importance to the magical act—why were they allowed tobecome incomprehensible in the course of time?2 if they were derived from foreign languages, what was the reasonfor borrowing these enigmatic texts at all?3 if, from the outset, the words lacked a lexical meaning, what wasthe reason for concocting these meaningless sounds?In short, I wish to ask the question: what is the meaning of the lack ofmeaning? What is the sense of nonsense? Whoever might censure thisas an anachronistic and modern biased formulation of the problemmay be reminded that the third century philosopher Porphyry askedexactly the same question in his attack on the followers of Plotinus,especially Iamblichus, whose practices of theurgia, derided as ‘magic’(goÆteia) by Porphyry, made ample use of these onomata barbara. Por-phyry wondered: “What, after all, is the sense of these meaninglesswords, and why are the foreign ones preferred to our own?” (t¤ d¢ ka‹tå êshma boÊletai ÙnÒmata, ka‹ t∆n ésÆmvn tå bãrbara prÚ t∆n•kãstƒ ofike¤vn;).1010Porphyry, in his letter to Anebo, ed. by A.R. Sodano, Porfirio, Lettera ad Anebo(Naples 1958) 22, as discussed by Peter Struck in the present volume. This calls tomind Aristotle’s description of and reservations against gl«ttai, “glosses”(Rh. 1404ff.; Poet. 457 ff.). He contrasts gl«ttai to kÊria, “current words”, which are in generaluse in a given language, while glosses are obsolete and jenikã, “foreign and anoma-lous”, though distinctive, since due to their singularity and independence of ordinarylanguage these words have a certain “dignity” (semnÒn). As their essential character-istic is not its meaning but its form they are not helpful for communication and,consequently, they are “entirely poetical” (pãntvw poihtikÒn). Hence Aristotle advisedagainst using them even if he could not foresee such extremes as reached in earlyChristian gl≈ssaiw lale›n, “speaking in tongues (i.e. strange words)”.

Next Ishall survey the various types of verbal strategies that were applied tomake the charms work.II Brief survey of the materialFor the present occasion I have selected as my main source the incan-tations and charms used in the atmosphere of remedies and recipes:medical or more generally useful prescriptions in the largest sense ofthe word. They include simple instructions to get rid of a headache, afever or an ulcer. But they can also contain advice to ward off thieves,wolves, snakes, lightning, hail or the evil eye: in sum any possibleform of misfortune. In addition to these medical and evil-avertingmotifs, they may also include techniques to receive a dream, to attractthe love or desire of another person, to harm an enemy, etcetera. Inthe latter cases we are at the very border of another class of magicaltexts: the curse texts or defixiones, mostly brief texts written on leadtablets.11 Interesting though they may be, I shall not deal with themhere, but focus on the magical incantations and more especially thecharms.12We have two comprehensive collections of these texts from an-tiquity: one is the corpus of the Greek magical papyri, published witha German translation in two volumes by Karl Preisendanz and re-viewed and republished by Albert Henrichs. An English translationhas been published by Hans Dieter Betz and his team.13 Besides11Two recent discussions: J.G. Gager, Curse Tablets and Binding Spells (New York -Oxford 1992), and D.

Ogden,Witchraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome (London 1999) 1-90. Cf. also Graf,Magic in the Ancient World, Ch. V, “Curse Tablets and Voodoo Dolls” (pp.118-174).The frequent publications of new (or new readings of) curse texts and charms by thegreatest expert in the field, David Jordan, deserve special mention.12Gordon, “The Healing Event”, 367, draws a distinction between charms (beingallusive, pregnant, not meant to be fully understood, orally composed and transmit-ted and mainly focussed on the act of healing) and incantations (being explicit,elaborated and concrete, often the creation or re-creation of a professional practi-tioner). But for the present occasion I prefer to use one comprehensive term for thetotal complex of the verbal magical spell and will as a rule speak of charms or spells.13K.

I aminterested in powerful, efficacious—or at the very least necessary—words such as they are inter alia applied in what we commonly callmagical charms, even when these charms do not essentially differfrom plain medical instructions.23More often we read the instruction to mention the name of theailment that must be cured, especially at the occasion of the gatheringof medicinal herbs.24 For instance H. 29:“When you enter a city, collect pebbles that lie on the road in front of thegate, as many as you want, while saying to yourself that you take them asa remedy for your headache. Attach one of them to your head and throwthe others behind you without looking back.”We observe that the materia medica (pebbles!) is made effective by acertain action, but when it comes to the utterance it is only its func-tion that is mentioned. This may serve as a first warning not tooeasily to assume a natural, though secret and hidden, efficacy in thenumerous plants and herbs that are used in magical treatments.However, there is a completely different category of words ornames that is most characteristic of magical carmina, albeit with fewexceptions they do not appear in classical Greek or Hellenistic textsbut only become current in the Roman period. We have already metwith a possible example in the mysterious terms handed down in theformula by Cato and we referred to them as voces magicae, strange,uncanny and apparently un-Greek and un-Latin words.25 The oldestknown example is a series of six words: éskion, kataskion, lij, tetraj,23That does not mean that attempts at working magic cannot be distinguished,also in connection with the names of patients or illnesses. For instance when thenumber of letters of the patient’s name, while being mentioned, should determine thenumber of knots that must be made in an unused thread. For the moment, however,I am trying not to get entangled in the vexed question of the relationship of magic,religion, and science. For my position in the discussion see: H.S. Versnel, “SomeReflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion”, Numen 38: 177-197.24H. 18-39, with discussion and more examples at p. 561; Ö. 29.25H. 178-242 has collected the voces magicae in the charms of late antiquity.

These very words anda great variety of different ones turn up again and again in latermagical and theological texts and are supposed to carry strong magi-cal power, especially—but not exclusively—as averters of evil. Theoldest of these ‘magical words’ thus originated in Greece, but foreigninfluences became ever more prevalent and the formulas ever moreextensive and complex in the imperial period.28It is in this period, too, that a most important and curious develop-ment took place. The strange words (sometimes referred to under thecollective name of Ephesia grammata) tended to become names (the morerestricted meaning of voces magicae). The powerful sounds acquired anadditional function as they were understood to be the secret names ofmysterious deities invoked in the spells. In other words, we perceive anew theogonia, a process of explosive creativity in which divine powersemerge from powerful words. The names of these new gods anddemons easily amalgamated with other existing names that were alsocharacteristic of magical formulas but which, from the beginning,were imagined as names of real gods or demons. Especially namesending on -el and -oth abound, which clearly go back to Hebrew/Jewish models, such as the name of god Sabaoth, or the variety of26The Ephesia grammata have exercised an enormous fascination from their earlyappearance until the present day, provoking a large number of works. I mention: K.Wessely, Ephesia Grammata aus Papyrusrollen, Inschriften, Gemmen etc. (Vienna 1886); C.C.McCown, “The Ephesia Grammata in Popular Belief”, TAPA 54 (1923) 128-40;Preisendanz, “Ephesia Grammata”. For a recent discussion and literature see: Gager,Curse Tablets, 6f. D.R. Jordan, “A Love Charm with Verses”, ZPE 72 (1988) 256-57,suggests that these Ephesia Grammata originally formed a comprehensible Greekhexameter. Cf. Daniel & Maltomini, Supplementum Magicum I no. 49. Others hadalready tried to isolate understandable elements, such as damnameneus: “the tamer”.For an extensive bibliography see: R. Kotansky, “Incantations and Prayers for Salva-tion on Inscribed Greek Amulets”, in: Faraone & Obbink, Magika Hiera, 107-137,esp. 111, with nn. 21. ff., also mentioning new findings.27Cf. L.H. Jeffrey, “Further Comments on Archaic Greek Inscriptions”, ABSA 50(1955) 75 f.28Additionally we find strange signs and figures that do not function as, butsometimes strongly remind us of letters.

Finally, they re-ceive a new function as the Names of the Seven Archangels, as forinstance in a famous inscription in the wall of the theater fromMiletus, where each of the seven characters is associated with two setsof vowels. Fortunately, in a 4/5th century papyrus we get the precise(that is in this period of time and cultural context) information whichvowel order represents which archangel, as it provides a list of thearchangels involved: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Souriel, Zaziel,Badakiel, Suliel.30But let us return to the voces magicae proper, the abracadabra-words, and repeat our question: did they have a ‘meaning’ or werethey just ‘nonsense’? The answer cannot be simple, for more than onereason. First, I must call to mind the possibility that at least part ofthese strange words may have originated as ‘normal’ words, either inthe speakers’ own language or in a foreign one. But there are otherformulas in which this is obviously not the case, for instance in such aseries, very popular in especially African curse tablets from the secondcentury onwards, as: Alimbeu, colombeu, petalimbeu, cuigeu, censeu, cinbeu,perfleu; or: cuigeu, censeu, cinbeu, perfleu, diarunco deasta. But if, accordingto some modern scholars, even their origin must be sought in ‘nor-mal’ words,31 then we can always resort to unmistakable neologismssuch as H. 189: ca ce ch ce ch ca ce (psa pse psê pse psê psa pse) to be29Full, if at present no longer exhaustive, collection in: E.

Now, there can belittle doubt that none of these series of voces magicae, whatever theirorigin, in their historical context carried any lexically semantic mean-ing usable in human communication. Although they do evoke a cer-tain atmosphere, there is no object or concept which they aresupposed to refer to. The only thing they refer to is themselves.32However, there is another side. Various authors of late antiquity,among whom the Christian Clement of Alexandria, argue that nor-mal human language was not appropriate in addressing higher beingsor god(s). Homer already knew that there was a specific language ofthe gods, and despite centuries of human prayer in normal humanlanguage, the idea of a special divine language never completely dis-appeared from human imagination. In later antiquity it was believedthat demons or gods understood the sounds of the voces magicae, evenif the human producers did not. In other words, now these terms didserve communication but a communication that could only be under-stood by one of the two partners in the communication.33Finally, in the same period, we also see voces magicae used intheurgy, ‘the compelling of a god’, for instance to make him appearor act according to the wish of the theurgist.34 Pliny NH 28, 19 (apassage which we shall discuss in more detail later), though generally32“Die geheimnisvolle Macht jener Wörter (oder Worte) liegt für den Aber-gläubigen in der Unverständlichkeit. Sie sind mit dem Zaubergerät vergleichbar, dassonst keinem sinnvollen, alltäglichen Zwecke dient” (Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”,115).33Apart from the general literature mentioned above n.25, see recently, especiallyon the voces magicae as divine names and in theurgy: J. Dillon, “The Magical Power ofNames in Origen and Later Platonism”, in: R. Hanson & H. Crouzel (eds.),Origeniana Tertia. The Third Colloquium for Origen Studies (Rome 1985) 203-16; N.Janowitz, “Theories of Divine Names in Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius”, History ofReligions 30 (1990) 359-372. On the implications of name giving and the powerinherent in knowing the correct names of gods or demons, especially in magicalcontexts, literature abounds. See: B. Gladigow, “Götternamen und Name Gottes”,in: H. von Stietencron (ed.), Der Name Gottes (Düsseldorf 1975) 13-32, esp. 19-23; idem,“Gottesnamen”, RAC 11 (1981) 1202-38, esp. 1206-8. For a sceptical re-considera-tion of the general idea that to know the name of a god is to have power over him,see: S. Pulleyn, “The Power of Names in Classical Greek Religion,” CQ 44 (1994) 17-25 (= idem, Prayer in Greek Religion [Oxford 1997] 96-115), which may just be true asfar as the title goes.

We have now made acquaint-ance with what is usually seen as one of the most characteristic fea-tures of magic: strange and incomprehensible sounds, words, phrases,originally used as autonomous instruments to add power to the magi-cal act, ‘to make it work’. We saw them developing into acclamationsor exhortations to raise (or compel) divine forces to activity, andfinally we saw them acquire a referential status as the personal namesof the gods invoked. All this, however, does not mean that ‘normalwords’ or ‘normal gods’, or ‘normal addresses’ to gods do not occur.Far from it, and one of the most alarming observations is that the twotypes of expression happily coexist through the centuries, also in com-binations of a most unexpected kind.To give an example: names of great gods, demons, or generallyholy persons are widely used in typical formulas of expulsion or pro-tection. There are a few recurrent types. In one the illness is exorcised35An illustrative series in Ö. 38-44, with discussion at pp. 120-22; cf. idem, Inmedicinam Plinii studia philologica (Lund 1956) 222 f. This type of text is commonlyfound on amulets and rings. Kotansky, “Incantations and Prayers for Salvation”, hasa full discussion with bibliography; see esp. 113 and 119 for the ‘flee’ formula. I donot find it helpful to make a rigorous distinction between them and magical charms.Both categories originated as oral enunciations, now fixed in written words, that aremeant to carry the incantations beyond the ritual, the primary performance, of aninvariably verbal rite (Kotansky, o.c. 108-110. Cf. Frankfurter, “The Magic of Writ-ing”, 195). The flee curses provoke a specific problem: if you chase away the illness,where does it remain? Of course, you can ignore the problem and just focus ongetting rid of the sickness: apopompê. But you can also specify where it must go: to adeserted place, where no mortal lives, or—more rewardingly—to the enemy country:epipompê. The classical work on the mentality involved is: O. Weinreich, “PrimitiverGebetsegoismus”, in: Gebet und Wunder. Zwei Abhandlungen zur Religions- undLiteraturgeschichte (Stuttgart 1929); idem, “Religiös-ethische Formen der Epipompe”,Ausgewählte Schriften III (Amsterdam 1979) 291-308. Cf. H. S. Versnel (ed.), Faith, Hopeand Worship (Leiden 1981) 17-21, with further literature. Significantly, this becomesone of the central tests for the distinction between magical spell and Christian‘Segen’ in the later Middle Ages. Most explicitly in the Malleus Maleficarum or‘Hexenhammer’, written in 1486 by the inquisitors Jacob Sprenger and HeinrichKrämer (German translation by J.W.R. Schmidt, Berlin 1906; English: M. Summers,London 1928)."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"  ‒   and sent away, sometimes with a simple command: “be gone” (exi),but very often in the name of a demon or god, who has the power tochase the sickness.35 Often the illness receives the order: “flee for agod chases you.” The name of the persecuting demon, god or hero36may vary, and both pagan, Jewish and Christian gods and saintsfreely intermingle, although pride of place should be given to Solo-mon. Solomon te sequitur or its Greek pendant is a top remedy againstillness, misfortune or particularly against the evil eye, as it is standardin amulets, gems and rings.37 Yet, Solomon was by no means the onlypersecutor and, most curiously, the process of associative engineeringhas even managed conversely to invoke the evil eye against an illness:Ö. 14, Ignis sacer, fuge, Livor pater te sequitur, in which ignis sacer probablyis erysipilas, a reddish eruption on the skin, while Livor pater can only be‘the evil eye’. The formula of protection, on the other hand, could beseen on many houses. Its scheme is: “sickness keep away, for herelives (or: “you are warded off by”) NN” (god, hero or saint). The mostpopular Greek defenders are Apollo and Herakles and in Christiantimes Christ took their place.38So we have ‘normal’ prayers requesting that the illness must begone together with ‘abnormal’ voces magicae with the same objective.We have ‘normal’ gods that are invoked or compelled, side by sidewith ‘abnormal’, foreign, strange divine beings who do the samething. As I said before, the alarming thing is not that they replaceeach other in the course of time, but that they are and remain inter-changeable. Indeed, this trait of exchangeability appears to be per-haps one of the most characteristic, albeit hardly noticed, features ofmagical charms. Let me clarify what I have in mind with the aid of a36Exceptionally the persecutor belongs to the natural world: H. 68, “Flee away,.... a wild wolf is chasing after your blood”.37See the discussion and literature in Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 120 ff. TheJewish author Flavius Josephus, Ant. Iud. 8, 2, 5, explains that Solomon owes hispopularity as a magician to his lauded wisdom (Cf. Kings 4: 29-34). Hence, Godgranted him also the qualities to heal or ward off illness. Another great Jewishmagician (though not prominent in spells) is Moses: J.G. Gager, Moses in Graeco-RomanPaganism (Nashville-New York 1972); cf. Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 6-7. Spellsmay also contain the—often sorely corrupted—names of four great Greek philoso-phers: Pythagoras, Demokritos, Sokrates, and Plato (H. 121), three of whom werebelieved to have been deeply interested in magic (Plin. NH. 30, 8-10).38Fundamentally: O. Weinreich, “Unheilbannung im Volkstümlichen Gebet,Segen und Zauberspruch”, in: Ausgewählte Schriften III (Amsterdam 1979) 199-223."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"     few examples. First, two spells to get information on the chastity of awoman,39 H. 216:“If you wish to know whether a woman is still chaste (literally: a virgin) orif she has been adulterous....... Another trick: cut the tongue of a live frogand let the frog go. Write on that tongue, which you have cut from thefrog, as follows: xounexv dhminoof (chounechô dêminoöph) and while thewoman is asleep lay the tongue on her breast. She will tell you everythingshe has done.”Now, immediately following this charm we read in the same text:“Another one: cut out the tongue of a live frog and let the frog go and onthe tongue write the name of the woman and while she is asleep place thetongue on her breast and thus question her, and if she has indeed beenabused, she will tell you the name of the adulteror”.A second example. In a chapter on deficiencies and illnesses of thehead we read, H. p. 556:“Against a headache of one half of the head (a kind of migraine) shut offyour breath with the right hand, spread it over your cerebrum and say:hoerbae et hooras erbaebo abraxat boetitae.”This charm again is immediately followed by another in the sametext:“Headaches you will enchant: take some earth, touch your breast three39This precarious question, by the way, seems to have been a constant concernfor ancient men. We have it in an oracular question from Dodona: H.W. Parke, TheOracles of Zeus (Oxford 1967) 266 no. 11; also in Theocr. 3, 31-3. In PGM VII, 411-6, which seems to be distantly related to our charm, the heart of a hoopoe is used forthe same purpose, whereas Plin. NH 32, 49, comes quite close to it with the tongueof a frog placed on the woman’s chest. Cf. also NH 29, 81, where it is an owl’s heartthat does the trick; in his forthcoming Spells of Wisdom, Gordon analyses these textsand notes that the frog, an amphibious animal, is the ideal ambivalent vehicle be-tween two different worlds. See also: W. Brashear, “Zauberformular”, APF 36 (1990),49-74, esp. 55-6. M.W. Dickie, “The Learned Magician and the Collection andTransmission of Magical Lore” in: D.R. Jordan et alii, The World of Ancient Magic, 163-193, esp. 183 ff., traces this type of spell back to Bolus of Mendes (3d century BC,Egypt), as a transmitter of ancient Babylonian spells concerning “the recovery ofalienated affection”. He also sketches their continued existence into the 15th centuryAD. For Jewish parallels see: P. Schäfer and Sh. Shaked, Magische Texte aus der KairoerGeniza I (Tübingen 1994), 17-28, and elsewhere: “Beschreibung von Praktiken zurPrüfung einer des Ehebruchs verdächtigten Frau, die einen Ersatz für den in Num.5,11-31 beschriebenen Brauch bilden sollen”. As to the male side, there are Greekoaths to establish fatherhood: Herodotus 6.68; Andocides 1.126."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"  ‒   times and say: My head hurts, why does it hurt? It does not hurt” (caputdolet, quare dolet? Non dolet).40Which of the two will be more efficacious? The one with the ‘normal’names and words? Or the one with the ‘abnormal’ voces magicae? HerePliny NH 28, 20, finds himself in serious trouble. For on the one handhe had already categorically rejected the abracadabra nonsense, onthe other hand he cannot but wonder:“It is not easy to say which of the two detracts more from the credibilityof a formula: foreign and unpronounceable words or Latin words whichhowever are unexpected,41 and which must appear ridiculous to ourmind, since our mind expects something immense, something adequate40Of course, there may be very good reasons for changing the formula. Forinstance we have two groups of codices from the 6th century giving parallel instruc-tions to extract the teeth of a badger for some magical trick (Ö. 32). One groupinstructs the patient to say: In nomine Omnipotentis decollo te (“In the name of theAlmighty I decapitate you”), another: Butabar torthon hydran cermalis metonbor loronamdison tha saniorden. Here, it is most probable that a Christian author has ‘corrected’the text, since one of the official distinctions between magic and religion according tothe Medieval Malleus Maleficarum (above n. 35) was whether the name of God, Christor the Saints was invoked or, on the other hand, odd names of demons. Malleus II,239: A spell may contain nothing “what comes to an explicit or implicit invocation ofDemons”; “no unknown names”. The only words permitted are “the holy wordsthemselves” (ibid. 240, cf. M. Siller, “Zauberspruch und Hexenprozess. Die Rolle desZauberspruchs in den Zauber-und Hexenprozessen Tirols”, in: W.M. Bauer, A.Masser, G.A.Plangg [eds.], Tradition und Entwicklung. Festschrift Eugen Thurner zum 60.Geburtstag [Innsbruck 1982] 127-153). Very much the same can be deduced from thespells and exorcisms as collected for instance in: Ch. Stewart, Demons and the Devil(Princeton 1991) Ch.9: “Spells: On the Boundary between Church Practice andSorcery”, 222-43. Heim 469f. lists three reasons why voces magicae in spells may beeliminated or replaced by other formulas: 1) an ancient author may refuse to quotethem as e.g. Pliny NH 17, 267; 28, 29; 2) Christian monks may do the same forobvious reasons (Kieckhefer, Magic in the Middle Ages, 5, notes that sometimes pageshave been excised from compilations for this reason); 3) sometimes voces magicae arelacking although they have been announced earlier in the same text, and as a reasonis given that this is expressly done in order not to reveal the secret text. In magicalpapyri we find the instruction not to divulge the text, e.g. PGM XII, 321-4: “For thisis the true rite, and the others such as are widely circulated, are falsified and made upof vain verbosity. So keep this in a secret place as a great mystery. Hide it, hide it!”.Comparably, a medieval text warns the person who wants to use a charm to keep thewords of the incantation secret by folding it tightly in parchment, lest some layperson acquires it (L. Olsan, “Latin Charms of Medieval England: verbal healing ina Christian oral tradition”, Oral tradition 7 [1992] 116-142, esp. 136). For a generaltreatment of Christian interventions in pagan magic, see: V. Flint, “TheDemonisation of Magic and Sorcery in Late Antiquity: Christians redefinitions ofpagan religions”, in: Ankarloo and Clark (eds.), Witchcraft and Magic in Europe 2, AncientGreece and Rome, 277-348.41I agree with Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 139 n.26, that the interpretation ‘lesétranges mots latins’ (A. Ernout in the Budé edition) cannot be correct. The contextunequivocally requires: “Latin words and for that very reason unexpected in magicalcontexts.”"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"     to move a god or rather to impose its will on his divinity” (Neque est faciledictu externa verba atque ineffabilia abrogent fidem validius an Latina et inopinata,quae inridicula videre cogit animus semper aliquid inmensum exspectans ac dignum deomovendo, immo vero quod numini imperet).This hesitation reveals at least as much about the nature of magic asit does about the weakness of Pliny’s character. He finds ‘normal’words—though meaningful—insignificant, whereas ‘abnormal’words—though meaningless—can be ‘immense’, that is sublime, ma-jestic, hence highly significant!Is it for this reason that instead of making it optional (as in our lasttwo texts), numerous other charms simply unite the ‘meaningless’ andthe ‘meaningful’? For instance Ö. 2742, where a spell against cancerin the breast confronts us with a combination of abnormal vocesmagicae, followed by a magical formula in normal language, whichagain is followed by a prayerlike invocation of the Christian god:“asca, basca, rastaia, serc, cercer, recercel. Nothing is it, nothing is it, nothing itwill do. What I, son or daughter of NN, have in my breast, I pray you,God, take care of it.” (asca, basca, rastaia, serc, cercer, recercel; nihil est, nihil est,nihil facturum erit. Quod ego ille aut illa filius Gaiae Seiae mamillis si pectus habeoa te, deus, peto, praestes.)So we observe that in the magical charms comprehensible and in-comprehensible ‘magical’ words and phrases are both exchangeableand cumulative.43 Accordingly, lists of alternative instructions for one42 Cf. Ö. 20.43Here is another splendid example: a medieval spell for advancing childbirth inwhich three different strategies are intertwined. I adopt the format used by Olsan,“Zaubersprüche”, 121, in which capitals distinguish the words containing power (themistakes in the orthography are neither hers nor mine):In nomine patris LAZARUS. Et filij VENI FORASet spiritus scantus CHRISTUS TE VOCAT  + CHRISTUS + STONAT +IESUS PREDICAT + CHRISTUS REGNAT + EREX + AREX +RYMEX + CHRISTI ELEYZON + EEEEEEEEE +Here we have first a frame of liturgical expressions to set the ceremonious atmos-phere: “In the name of the Father etc”, larded with intelligible, ‘normal’ powerwordstaken from Christian mythology, which have a bearing on the situation of childbirth:LAZARUS, because of his resurrection compared with childbirth here, COMEFORTH and CHRIST CALLS YOU. Thirdly, there is a series of nonsense words,which, however, may betray a wordplay on REX = king, triggered by the spellCHRISTUS REGNAT: “Christ rules”. Like late antique charms medieval Latincharms display a variety of linguistic forms 1) nonsensical sounds, 2) Latin verse, 3)strings of powerful names, 4) narrative themes, 5) performatives of adjuration andconjuration and prescriptives. See the analysis by Olsan, o.c. 124-139 (and anothervery complex example on p. 137) and B.K. Halpern & J.M. Foley, “The Power ofthe Word: Healing Charms as an Oral Genre”, Journal of American Folklore 91 (1978)903-24."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"  ‒   and the same illness strongly suggest that it was a common practice,if one device did not work, to resort to another. Contrary to the usualnotion of magic with its assumed automatic and mechanic effects, thisoptionality, in terms of both repetition and alternation, is indeedwidely attested: if a trick did not work one must try it another time ortry another, and again and again until it works.44In the meantime one question forces itself on the observer. If youdo not use exotic voces magicae, and yet—like Pliny—feel that normalLatin words (caput non dolet) are perhaps not sufficiently ‘immense’ ormajestic to be taken seriously as genuine magical instruments, arethere any means to add ‘immensity’ to verba latina—means, in otherwords, that can add what we might call ‘magical quality’ to the for-mula? Indeed, there are, and we are now going to pay attention tothe two most specific strategies. One of them concerns the content,the other more formal aspects of the formula.III.2 The appeal to analogy: comparison, similes, historiolaeOne of the great strategies to add efficacy to words is to appeal toexemplary models, which for some reason or other are powerful inthemselves, and if incorporated into the formula impart their power,in other words persuasive force. This is the strategy of analogy, whichincludes a great number of different techniques, such as comparison,simile, metaphor, historiolae.45 I shall give a few examples.44E.g., H. 181: first the plant millefolium must be dug out. Then it must beplanted again. “If the plant does not revive, repeat the performance with another.” Inmagical papyri repetition of magical words often with slight variations is a commonphenomenon: e.g. PGM II, 52-60. It is a well-known practice in religious ritual aswell, especially in ritual of an oracular type: Plut. Aem. Paul. 17, 6 (20 times); Xen.Anab. 6, 4, 12 (23 times). It could also be prescribed in advance to repeat a formula,as Cato did in connection with the spell discussed above or e.g. H. 112 (discussed byÖnnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 126): remediasti, si frequentius (frequenter) incantaveris (“youwill recover if you will sing this frequently”); also in PGM IV, 3089 f. In Mark 8:22-26, the repetition of the healing gesture increases its success. On different optionalwordings for the same recipes: D.G. Martinez, P. Michigan XVI: A Greek Love Charmfrom Egypt (P.Mich 757) (American Studies in Papyrology 30, 1991) 6 f.45These typical elements of magical charms have been discussed time and again.Heim, “Incantamenta magica graeca latina”, 495 ff. already has a good discussionand Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 123-129, another. In his forthcoming Spells of Wis-dom, Gordon has a fascinating section on it. For historiolae see: D. Frankfurter, “Nar-rating Power: the theory and practice of the magical historiola in ritual spells”, in: M.Meyer & P. Mirecki (eds.), Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (Leiden 1995) 457-476.

Be quiet, intestines, stand still crocodile” (quid irasceris? quidsicut canis iactas te? quid sicut lepus resilis? quiesce intestinum et sta crocodile).46More often the act of healing is compared or identified with naturaloccurrences. For instance H. 84, a spell for good digestion:“a wolf went along road, along track. Raw food he devoured, liquids hedrank” (lupus ibat per viam, per semitam, cruda vorabat, liquida bibebat).or H. 51, a spell against swollen glands (tonsils):“white glands do not hurt, do not harm, do not swell into a tumor, butbecome liquid like salt in water” (albula glandula, nec doleas, nec noceas, necpaniculas facias, sed liquescas tamquam salis in aqua).or H. 111, a spell against damage of the veins:“mountains dry up, valleys dry up, veins dry up, especially those whichare full of blood” (siccant montes, siccant valles, siccant venae, vel quae de sanguinesunt plenae).2 But you can also create yourself the (natural) circumstances thatmust serve as analogon. For instance H. p. 561 against quartan fever:“You must collect three pebbles from a quadrivium (crossroads) and hidethem in a concealed cooking pot and say: just as the sun cannot see thesepebbles so let not the quartan fever see them” (de quadrivio collecti lapilli tres,subiectos in cacabo abscondito et dicis: quomodo hos sol videre non potest, sic et illosquartanae non videant).or H. p. 563: in order to stimulate his libido a man must performvarious manipulations with a stick and then say:“just as this stick is erect, let also my ‘natura’ be erect and strong”(quemadmodum hic palus erectus est, sic et natura mea erigatur et fortis sit).We have met this construction of a ‘natural’ parallel before, namelyin the text of Cato. It is one of the common devices of the magicalact: what used to be called ‘sympathetic’ magic, but which modernscholarship prefers to see as an act of performative persuasionthrough analogy.46Though, of course, there are Egyptian spells against crocodiles (“It is Isis, whorecites: there is no crocodile”, P. mag. Harris, spell P) the word ‘crocodile’ cannotvery well have been intended here, and Heim, “Incantamenta magica graeca latina”,479, has the ingenious suggestion that it is a corruption of corcus, meaning ‘rumblingof the bowels’. If he is right, as I think he is, this is a splendid instance of the ‘drivetowards alienation’ discussed below."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"  ‒   3 However, next to these examples taken from nature, there is an-other, quite different source of powerful analoga. It consists of modelsthat are stored in the cultural legacy of a civilization. For the laterRoman period three great literary works were the most favouritesources of powerful exempla: Homer, Vergil and the Bible.47 It neednot be the power of the divine or heroic protagonists that was re-ferred or resorted to: the works themselves, so it was believed, con-tained a deep, hidden wisdom and force, as witness also the endlessallegorizations of the Homeric epics in the Hellenistic period, and theevolution of Vergil from a pagan poet to a wise magician and even aprophet of the Christian faith.48 These are exemplary instances of‘traditional referentiality’, to quote John Miles Foley, for one lineevokes “a context that is enormously larger and more echoic than thetext or work itself”.49 So if you suffer from bad eyesight you quote theHomeric verse (H. 104)“Take this mist from my eyes, that was there before” (éxlÁn d’aÔ toi ép’Ùfyalm«n ßlon, ∂ pr‹n §p∞en, Il. 5,127),47For biblical quotations in a magical context see: J. Trachtenberg, Jewish Magicand Superstition: a study in folk religion (New York 1939=1982), esp. 104-13; E. A. Judge,“The Magical Use of Scripture in the Papyri”, in: E.W. Conrad and E.G. Newing(eds.), Perspectives on Language and Text (Winona Lake 1987) 339-49. Psalm 90 is facileprinceps. See: Daniel-Maltomini, Supplementum Magicum I, p. 73, with literature. Cf.also: Frankfurter, “Narrating Power”, 465 n.25. Coptic magic for a considerable partconsists of scripture quotations written as amulets, appeals to Christian gods andangels for practical concerns, applied versions of church liturgy and formulae, asnoticed by D. Frankfurter, in: Meyer and Smith, Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts ofRitual Power, 259-62; idem, Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance (Princeton1998) 257-64; S.G Ritner, “Bemerkungen zu magischen Elementen koptischerZaubertexte”, Archiv für Papyrusforschung, Beiheft 3 (1997) 835-46. For Homer see:Kotansky, “Incantations”, 132 n. 61.48Divination and magic being closely associated, especially in the magical papyri(F. Graf, “Magic and Divination”, in: D.R. Jordan et alii, The World of Ancient Magic,283-98), it does not surprise that the very same powerful ‘sacred’ texts were equallypopular as materials for oracular practice, especially in the divination through sortes,(lot-oracles): P.W. van der Horst, “Sortes: het gebruik van heilige boeken alslotsorakels in de oudheid”, Mededelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie vanWetenschappen, Afd. Letterkunde 62 (1999). The Homer-oracles (Homeromanteia) formed aspecial category consisting of a list of 216 disconnected Homeric verses, each ofwhich was preceded by three figures, representing numbers from 1.1.1 to 6.6.6. Theinquirer cast a single dice three times, and the result indicated the verse to beconsulted. See for the most complete example: PGM VII, 1-148; cf. F. Maltomini,“P.Lond. 121 (= PGM VII) 1-221: Homeromanteion”, ZPE 106 (1995) 107-122.Generally: F. Heinevetter, Würfel- und Buchstabenorakel in Griechenland und Kleinasien(Breslau 1912).49J.M.

Ecl. 4,10 (Ö. 23):“Hail chaste Lucina (goddess of birth), your Apollo already reigns” (Castafave Lucina, tuus iam regnat Apollo),or Ö. 24:“Elisabeth gave birth to John the Baptist. Open yourself mother (hereperhaps the name of the woman in labour must be mentioned) and sendout from you the lamb born from man” (Helisabet peperit Iohannem babtistam,aperi te, mater illa eius, quia nomen facit quae parturit et emitte ex te pecudem dehomine creatum).But, of course, if a bone sticks in your throat another ‘delivery’ isrequired, which, too, can be advanced by the spell (Ö. 59):“Christ is born from the Virgin Maria” (Christus de Maria virgine natus est)And if you suffer from worms you say Ö. 60:“Job had worms and through the vision of God they died and his ulcerswere healed. Christ, let thus die the worms and ulcers of the servant ofthe Lord, that they cannot do him harm evermore. Agyos, aios, ayos,sanctus, sanctus, sanctus, fiat, fiat, fiat AMEN” (Job vermes habuerit et per visionemdomini mortui sunt et sanata fuit ulcera eius. Christe, sic moriatur vermes et ulcera50This verse is also the only Homeric verse found engraved on a magic lamella:Kotansky, “Incantations”, 118.51The repertoire of themes is limited, especially in the Christian charms. Olsan,“Latin Charms of Medieval England”, 130, gives a list of purposes and the com-monly connected narrative motifs."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"  ‒   quae habet famulus domini ut numquam ei amplius nocere possit. agyos, aios, ayos,sanctus, sanctus, sanctus, fiat, fiat, fiat AMEN).Gods or heroes may also serve as models in that various plants andherbs are specially recommended since their medicinal force hadbeen discovered or imparted by great gods such as Minerva, Apollo,Asclepios or the centaur Chiron.52 But just as in the ‘natural’ analo-gies above there is ample room for creative inventions. If you sufferfrom your tonsils sing (H. p. 557):“Neptunus had (sick) tonsils standing on (lit. over) a stone, here he stoodand had nobody to cure him. So he healed himself with his triple ‘sickle’”(Neptunus tusellas habebat supra petram, hic stabat, neminem habuit, qui curaret, ipsese curavit falce sua triplice).Unnecessary to say that though sitting or standing on or above some-thing (stone, sea), whatever may be intended, is a recurrent theme inthis type of mythological charm,53 Neptune had nothing to do withtonsils. The mighty name Neptunus itself is the effective analogon, asvariants show.So we may conclude for the moment that in formulas that resort tocomparison and simile, which often are expanded into small histories(historiolae), the analoga could be sought in exemplary natural situa-tions, situations that could also be imitated or created, on the onehand, and on the other in examples handed down by tradition (liter-ary or not), which refer to a supranatural reality. In the latter case,there may be a shift: the supernatural model can also be invoked assupernatural actor.III.2.1 ComplicationsWe must, however, complicate matters. For I wish now to focus theattention on the extreme arbitrariness and inconsistencies in thechoice and application of analogy. There appears to be an astonish-ing freedom both in the models that are selected and in the variety ofapplications of one model to different diseases and cures. Finallythere is an abundance of alterations and transformations.52Examples in H.108, 109, 124-126, and Ö. 40-45. An early instance in Plin. NH2, 176.53L. Robert, “Amulettes grecques”, Journal des Savants (1981) 9-16, presents manyinstances and traces its Jewish origin. It perseveres into medieval charms: IesusChristus super mare sedebat or Petrus iacebat super petram mormoriam : Olsan, “Latin Charmsof Medieval England”, 131 f. It seems to be conversely related with mythical figurescoming out of the sea, who bring illnesses: A.A. Barb, “Antaura: The mermaid andthe devil’s grandmother”, Journal of the Wardburg and Courtauld Institutes 29 (1966) 1-23."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"     Let us consider a very instructive charm: H. 167. A certain plant isapplied in order to stop podagra, which was believed to be caused bya flux of blood, and then the plant is conjured by the name of greatIaoth Sabaoth,“the God who has fixed the earth and fastened the sea out of streaming,overflowing rivers, the One who dried up the wife of Lot and turned herinto salt”.We observe various interesting features. First, we see that completelydifferent and mutually incoherent acts of the great God are united inone search for analoga. There seems to be only one condition: thatthey have something to do with ‘drying up’. Secondly, the analogaare not particularly self-evident or compelling. I mean: in case of aflux it seems quite appropriate to write on a paper the story of thebleeding woman who touched the garment of Jesus and was healed(as it was done), but the connection of streams of blood with thesalted wife of Lot demands a lot of our imagination and the creatorreally invested some effort in this creation. And thirdly, to our logicalmind, he did not even succeed in every respect. Admittedly, the wifeof Lot, being of salt was dry at least, but turning rivers into sea cannotvery well be characterized as drying up, whatever way you look at it.Here is a first hint that there may have been a taint of non-committal,if not relaxed, playfulness in the search for or invention of analoga.A striking illustration of this is provided by a series of variations ofa very popular medieval spell.54 One is intended to cast a spell on asnake with the words:“stand still as the water of the Jordan stood still when John baptized ourLord Jesus”.The same effect is intended by a variant charm:“stand still just as Christus Jesus stood at the Jordan”,and this same text is repeated in another spell, which however is notdirected against snakes but against fire. And there is a host of variantsboth in form and in application. It appears that people have (orclaim) a considerable liberty in adapting or changing standing similesinto sometimes essentially different ones without apparently detract-ing from their supposed effectiveness. Sometimes there is no obviousreason for the variation, on other occasions these “variations depend54Siller, “Zauberspruch und Hexenprozess”, 127-153, esp. 134 f., with manyvariants. The Jordan may yield its place to the Euphrates: F. Maltomini, “Cristo all’Eufrate”, ZPE 48 (1982) 149-170 = Daniel-Maltomini, Supplementum Magicum I, no32."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"  ‒   upon the identity of the frame, the immediate textual environment,and the performance situation”.55This ‘arbitrariness’56 becomes manifest in various other mannersas well: for instance in the application of colour analogy: whiteanemones must prevent the white complexion that is caused by heavydrinking, just as yellow flowers are good to prevent or heal jaundice.57Contrarily, using a red cloth is recommended in order to produce ahealthy red complexion. Whereas in different cases the red colour ofa plant can again be employed against red ulcers and the like. So thereis a wild variety, a multi-applicability of practically any object orexample according to the free associations of the user. In the processof association anything goes, as long as there is the tiniest shred ofsimilarity.58 If you cannot immediately think of a positive analogonyou create a negative one. The following simile (H. 101) is docu-mented in a number of variations:“A mule cannot propagate, a stone cannot make wool” (Nec mula parit, neclapis lanam fert),which is then followed by the wish that in the same way the illnessmust not exist (anymore). Now, the first adunaton, nec mula parit, is atopos:59 it is obvious, it is curious, everybody knew it and wonderedwhy this was. So you can use it as an exemplary adunaton if you needone. The second, however, is neither curious nor relevant, it is an adhoc invention, just a sudden idea, as there are many others in theseadunata stories. Here is a variant in H. 101:55Halpern & Foley, “Zauberspruch und Hexenprozess”, 909; splendid examplesin Olsan, “Latin Charms of Medieval England”, 127-8, and 131-32.56I must emphasize that the term ‘arbitrary’, which I shall use some more times,according to the dictionaries denotes two notions: “depending on or fixed through anexercise of will, or by caprice”. Although, especially in the more formal variations of rhyme-words and voces magicae the latter meaning may prevail, one can often discern an atleast subjective meaning and an immanent structure of differences, as Gordon, “TheHealing Event”, has shown. Cf. also the remark by Halpern and Foley above n.55.57Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 123.58And I know why. I have a green watering can, which I used for spreadingpesticides to eradicate the weeds in my grass. My reason to use a green can was basedon the association: poison is green, because the Dutch language has an expression“gifgroen” (green as poison). The next year I used that same can but, the originalassociation having vanished from my memory, I took it that it referred to green asthe symbol of unspoilt nature (cf. die Grünen) and used it for the opposite goal (withdeplorable results). One can either regret the multireferentiality of analogy (as I did)or one can welcome it since it provides abundant opportunity for creative association(for which see below).59Even to the extent that mulae partus was a prodigium and that the expression cummula pepererit (“at the time that a mule will bear”) meant “never”. See: Heim,“Incantamenta magica graeca latina”, 493 n.1."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"     “because a mule does not propagate, a drinking-vessel does not drink, apigeon has no teeth, so may my teeth not hurt” (quod mula non parit, neccantharus aquam bibit, nec palumba dentes habet, sic mihi dentes non doleant),where, again, there is a decrease in obviousness of the analoga, thistime going hand in hand with an increase of relevancy. Particularly inthese adunata we descry an emphatic drive towards variation.So we conclude for the moment that the choice of models in com-parative formulas is liable to a liberty that often verges on arbitrari-ness. Although there are fixed and recurrent models, either takenfrom nature or from cultural tradition, which have an authority inthemselves, the users are apparently free to vary, associate, recreate,make additions, and all this practically without restriction. In otherwords, there seems to be a remarkable tolerance or rather opennessto improvisation. In this process we often observe that the logicalrelevance of a particular comparison is not the decisive consideration.60Obviously, one of the seminal intentions is to cancel the cure’s isola-tion, to insert it into a recognizable series of comparable events orphenomena, some of which ended well. It is the mise en série thatcounts, and—so it seems—counts most. Different from, or in additionto, what is normally associated with magic and its supposed andsometimes explicitly prescribed stern tradition of fixed and inviolableformulas (“you shall not alter a jot or tittle of this formula”),61 itseems that this proliferation of new and often singular formulas is amarked trait of the magical charm.62 So we may well wonder if thisprofusion of new similes, this process of creativity, might not have60Consequently, the reverse is also true: one formula could be applied for severalcompletely different purposes as the PGM (esp. IV, 2145-76) and such instructions as...w y°lete (whatever you wish to achieve) illustrate.61Just as it was common practice to attribute charms or rituals to great authoritiesof a primeval age and to give the illusion that they had been handed down withoutalterations.62Siller, “Zauberspruch und Hexenprozess”, 140: “Der Zauberspruch ist beigleichbleibender Intention einem dauernden Wandel unterworfen. Obwohl man andem bewährten Wortlaut (“probatum est”, fügt die schriftliche Tradition oft dazu),wie an einem technischen Mittel festhält, obwohl also gerade für diese literarischeGattung die Ehrfurcht vor dem einmal geformten Wort typisch ist und das festhaltendaran verbindlich ist, befindet sich der einzelne Spruch in einem dauerndenUmformungsprozess”; Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 8: “such texts were transmittedfrom one magician to another without ever being corrected or improved by scholars,and each user was free to modify the text as he or she saw fit...”; M.W. Dickie, “TheLearned Magician”, in: D.R. Jordan et alii, The World of Ancient Magic, 184: “Magi-cians do make a pretence of observing with scrupulous care what they like to main-tain are ancient rituals. In reality, magic is innovative and dynamic.”"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"  ‒   something to do with the very nature of magic, or at least of themagical charm.III.3 From analoga to anaphora: formal applications of analogyThere is one curious application of analogy which may now lead usto our last issue, the one that was announced above as the formalpeculiarities of the formula. To stop a stream of blood you can writethe following words, H. 97: sicycuma, cucuma, ucuma, cuma, uma, ma, a. Acucuma is a cooking kettle. Perhaps the extension of this term in thepreceding sicycuma refers to siccus dry, which may be meaningful. Butthat is not my point now. What interests us here is the formal tech-nique. One word is repeated but in line after line is robbed of oneletter until nothing remains. This is a very popular device. We haveseveral of these formulas in which the gradual decrease in the lengthof the word itself is the analogon for the desired decline of the ill-ness.63 The initial term can have a meaning, for instance as a refer-ence to the illness itself: H. 96 novem glandulae sorores (“nine tonsilssisters”, note that glandulae has nine letters). Others, especially often ingemmae, just start from voces magicae, for instance the abracadabra-formula. Inherent in this technique is the principle of repetition64 andthis is one of several formal strategies to impart effectiveness to aword or a phrase. We shall now turn to these formal strategies.III.3.1Formal techniques: (asyndetic) cumulation, repetition, variation, rhyme,alliterationEven before reading the contents of a spell, a first glance often sug-gests that we have to do with an incantation. This is due to certainstereotyped and recurrent formal characteristics. The most commonare repetition, variation, various forms of rhyme or alliteration,parallelization by opposites etc. I give an example: the famous charmhanded down by Varro RR 55:65terra pestem teneto, salus hic maneto in meis pedibus (“the earth must keep thepestilence, health must remain here in my feet”).Albeit on a primitive level, there is parallelism in metrum, there is63Discussed among others by Önnerfors, “Zaubersprüche”, 116 f.64Often, especially in magical papyri, in combination with certain geometricgraphic arrangements in so-called carmina figurata. See Frankfurter, “The Magic ofWriting”, 199 ff.; Gordon, in his forthcoming Spells of Wisdom, offers a detailed analy-sis.65See: Tupet, La magie dans la poésie latine, 172-4."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"     rhyme, there is also contrast in meaning. Now, as we all know someof the formal principles applied in these charms are ubiquitous inother areas of especially folk expressions, as for instance nurseryrhymes. “Iene miene mutte, tien pond grutte, tien pond kaas, ienemiene mutte, ik ben de baas”,66 is a dipping rhyme in my own(Dutch) language. Repetition, for instance, is a fixed technique inboth religious and magical expressions, and the instruction to repeata word or formula two or especially three times is rife. No doubt,repetition or extension of a formula by variation (albula glandula)—inmore general terms: pleonasm or redundancy—confers emphasis,that is power, to the expression.67 One says hagios, hagios, hagios be-cause trishagios is thrice as much as once hagios. But, of course, not allhas been said with this truism. For even if it would explain one typeof these formal devices it does not nearly explain all of them.Though it is not my intention to go into the formal and prosodicniceties of the formulas I give here a few examples of three veryspecific devices in both comprehensible and nonsense formulas, alltaken from the collections of Heim and Önnerfors (I have latinizedthe Greek):1 gemination or trigemination by sheer repetition: lego soi lego soi—socnon, socnon—sirmio sirmio,2 repetition including variation: vigaria gasaria—lolismus lolistus,3 gradual variation from rather simple, mono- or bisyllabic forms tomore complicated terms, a particularly popular device, especialyin that the iteration or slight variation of the first two terms isfollowed by one or more words with a sudden radical change and/or extension: rica rica soro—kuria kuria kassaria sourorbi—argidammargidam sturgidam 68—crissi crasi concrasi—adam bedam alam betur alam66We also have here an instance of the happy alliance between lexically semanticand nonsense words in the formula. For this process in nursery rhymes etc. see: H.A.Winkler, “Die Aleph-Beth-Regel: Eine Beobachtung an sinnlosen Wörtern inKinderversen, Zaubersprüchen und Verwandtem”, in: R.

H. 75gives a charm that must be said to a bruise or contusion:époliy≈yhti, épojul≈yhti, épokordul≈yhti (apolithôthêti, apoxulôthêti, apokor-dulôthêti: “turn to stone (petrify), turn to wood, turn to ..... WHAT?)”For here we have a problem. The first of these three words occursregularly, the second does occur, but only rarely, the third cannot befound in any dictionary: lexically it does not ‘exist’. And this is not theonly problem; kordÊlh (kordule), the Greek word from which this verbapparently has been derived, has several meanings, two of which arerelevant to our problem. One is ‘cudgel, stick’. The second is ‘swell-ing’. In other words, the term apokordulôthêti has an ideal doublemeaning, or at least a double reference, which on the one handconnects it with the first two words of the formula and helps to extendthe sequence: “turn to stone, turn to wood, turn to cudgel”, on theother with the ailment under discussion, the swelling. There is onlyone problem for us, but apparently not a problem of the author of theformula. If taken in the latter sense apokordulôthêti would literallymean: “turn into swelling” = “become a swelling”, not: “get rid of theswelling”. But apparently the mise en série as such is far more impor-tant than lexically correct meanings. “A word... functions within anongoing context in which rhythm, sound, framework and associationsare more important than the word itself”.70 Indeed if a word does sofar not exist and a person takes the trouble of creating one, he maymean by it anything he may mean by it, he may even mean nothingat all. It is his word, he made it in an associative act which can now beclearly recognized as a process of poetics.For what I am really talking about here appears to be a genuine69A host of other instances of this trope could be collected from the defixiones andmagical papyri.70J.H.

Strangely enough, it has escaped Heim that the very samescheme of this productive process, including the problem of itssemantical coherence, returns in another charm quoted by him (H.106), a charm to prevent inflammation. The great sorceresses Circeand Medea are introduced sitting and facing the orient while search-ing for the medicine against inflammation e‡te épÚ l¤you (eite apo lithou,“either from stone”), e‡te épÚ jÊlou (eite apo xulou, “or from wood”),e‡te épÚ kunodÆktou (eite apo kunodêktou, “or from the dogbitten”). Theformer two elements refer to the same materials as in the previouscharm: they are the material from which the sorceresses hope toextract the healing power. The third word, however, appears to be afree addition, again not equivalent to the other two, and as a matterof fact in this sequence quite out of order. Perhaps not, however, inthe logic of the medical act: like kordulos of the charm just mentionedit seems rather to refer to the (cause of the) disease itself.72 The proce-dure in these two spells displays a marked structural similarity withthe so popular, purely formal sequences like argidam, margidam,sturgidam mentioned above.As it is, our texts bristle with neologisms, new, strange and un-known terms, irrelevancies, and even plain contradictions. All this ispartly due to processes of prolific cumulation, variation, rhyme, moregenerally in the creation of lists.73 Let us inspect a few striking exam-ples. H. 112: If your horse is in the following condition:71A comparable swifting between different categories in an Attic defixio (Wünsch,DTA no. 55) cursing various persons including a soldier: “These persons I do bind inthe lead (i.e. on this tablet), in the wax, in the potion, in inactivity, in invisibility, indisgrace, in defeat, in grave monuments....” The materials that must implement thecurse are followed by the intended effects, which are again followed by the placewhere the defixio is deposited (in view of the context the latter is more likely than thewish that the cursed person will end up in a grave). Interestingly, Gordon, in hisforthcoming Spells of Wisdom, shows that, conversely, ancient poetry, when imitatingor evoking incantations, may make use of the very same technique that we are herediscussing.72Note that the Greek term can indeed refer to an illness or a wound caused by adogbite: Arist.

Among the many curses against a potential grave robberin a funerary inscription from Salamis at Cyprus (SEG 6 [1932] 802) we read: prÚwKUNADAKNVN ka‹ §x¤dnhw fusÆmatow.73See on listing in different magical contexts: R. Gordon, “‘What’s in a List?’Listing in Greek and Graeco-Roman Malign Magical Texts”, in: D.R. Jordan et alii,The World of Ancient Magic, 239-277. How very conscious people were of this specifi-cally magical procedure is exemplarily illustrated by the ironic allusion made byApuleius Apol. 64.2, introducing three neologisms in the rhyme words occursacula ...formidamina ...terriculamenta in an undisguised parody of a magical malediction.

Focussing on the diminutive forms inthese pairs of related words Önnerfors comments: “Wie diedeminutiva tosillas, panuclas und strumellam zu beurteilen sind, ist nicht74Of course, some guesses are more obvious than others.

In otherwords: once more the case is not simple but complicated. Let uscomplicate matters a bit further.III.3.2 Complications: the complexity of alienationRight in the beginning of our enquiry we saw ourselves confrontedwith three different, at first sight mutually exclusive interpretations ofthe enigmatic words in the magical formula in Cato: either they con-sisted of non-semantic voces magicae, or they were derived from a for-eign language, or they were corruptions of originally good Latinwords and phrases. One problem was that we are rarely able todecide which of the three is correct, another, even more alarmingproblem is that one gets the impression that the three options mayintermingle and coincide in a sheer inextricable way. Moreover, wecannot always decide whether the corruption is the effect of a processof wear, naturally inherent in oral tradition, as an effect of deficientmemory for instance, or on the other hand is the result of conscious orunconscious strategies of the transmitter. Let us have a closer look atthese complications. H. 45 is a Greek spell against the evil eye, whichI give in translation except for the word which I am now interestedin:“Go, nemesvy (nemesôth), go out, stay off from the amulet-protected horse,who was born from his own mother, o you evil eye, as far as the earth isseparated from heaven”.There are two interesting ‘mistakes’. One is a very strange corruptionof a normal formula. “Who was born from his own mother” must bea corrruption of—perhaps rather a free variation on—the (originallyEgyptian) habit, very common in magical texts, of identifying a per-son by the name of his mother.76 But what I am now interested in is76While Graf, in the first version of his book (La magie dans l’antiquité gréco-romaine[Paris 1994] 149) still interpreted this strange habit as an exclusively magical inversion,he now argues that the origin is Egyptian, but that the application in magical texts isinspired by the general penchant to magical reversal. (Magic in the Ancient World, 128).With reference to the French edition of Graf’s book, J.B. Curbera, in an exhaustivepaper, “Maternal Lineage in Greek Magical Texts” in: D.R. Jordan et alii, The Worldof Ancient Magic, 195-203, esp. 199, once more argues that the habit is derived fromEgypt but was adopted in Graeco-Roman magic for reasons of inversion. He alsonotes that “the magical tendency towards inversion normally does not create newelements, but selects from pre-existing elements.” By way of illustration he refers to"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"  ‒   the term nemesoth. On the basis of parallel evidence, Heim assumedthat we should read nemes« sÉ (nemeso se), which means “I feel resent-ment against you”. In a letter, Chris Faraone suggests that the origi-nal word rather should be Nemesis, since most flee formulas follow thepattern of an imperative followed by the name of the affliction.77Nemesis is an alias of the Evil Eye. However this may be, we are backat the vexed question: is it an error of a late scribe as there are somany? Or was the corruption already fixed in an earlier model? If so,how did it slip into the text, and why was not it unmasked? Thequestion is justified as words ending on th do not occur in the Greeklanguage. So the word must have caused at least some uneasiness toa Greek user who knew perfectly well that such a word ‘could notexist’. On the other hand, words ending on th, especially on -oth:(representing a female plural in Hebrew), are very common in, in-deed characteristic of, voces magicae and the names of gods and demonssuch as Sabaoth in magical texts. In other words there may have beensome temptation if not to wilfully produce, then at least to tolerate thecorruption nemesoth and perhaps to take it as a divine name.78I do, of course, not deny that variation or corruption is a matter ofcourse in the tradition of voces magicae, devoid as they are of a lexicalmeaning that could succour the preservation of their original mor-phology. Far more interesting, however, is the process by which anormal meaningful word is turned into a vox magica, as we saw it inR. Münsterberg, “Zu den attischen Fluchtafeln, JÖAI 7 (1904) 141-5, who arguesthat the magical use of retrograde writing did not originate as an inversion of thenormal writing, but was a relic of older Greek writing habits only preserved in magicas a sign of otherness. Using the mother’s name, for that matter, is also well attestedin early Greek inscriptions. The curse text, that was brilliantly explained by D.R.Jordan, “CIL VIII 19525 (B) 2 QPVVLVA = q(uem) p(eperit) vulva”, Philologus 120 (1976)127-32, (cf. idem, “Notes from Carthago”, ZPE 111 [1996] 121, and ZPE 74 [1988]240, where he mentions two unpublished curse tablets from the Athenian agora withthe text: ̆n ¶teke mÆtra t∞w mhtrÚw aÈtoË) demonstrates the common use of the expres-sion as well as its applicability for puns as in our text. Cf. Daniel-Maltomini,Supplementum Magicum I p. 155.77 Cf. Daniel-Maltomini, Supplementum Magicum I p.71.78A splendid parallel of this process, which is unmistakably intended, is the ‘magi-cal’ name that Hermes adopts in one of the so-called Sethianic curse tablets:xyoniyarxvy (chthonitharchôth) in a defixio: (Audollent, Defixionum tabellae, no. 18; compa-rable terms ibid. nos. 27, 29-38, all from Cyprus), in which the terms ‘ruler’ of the‘underworld’ can be easily recognized, both, however, augmented with a ‘magical’ th.W.

Once we are prepared for this possibility, itstrikes us that there is an astonishing potential of strategies, eitherconscious or unconscious, to create ‘strange words’, that are all appliedin the magical texts. The instruction to use Greek words or letters ina Latin text or vice versa belongs to the most common strategies,79 as isthe use of words from other languages in general.80 H. 47, a Greekcharm, gives the instruction to write a formula against mice: “write§jhfore”. Another codex has §jifore. We can be sure that the userhad no idea what it meant and took it to be a vox magica. It is howevernothing but the Latin expression: exi foras (“go away”, lit. “go out-side”), but written in Greek letters. These words from other languagesor words written in foreign letters in the midst of a normal text docome as a surprise and are of course particularly prone to corruption.Here it becomes practically impossible to distinguish between vocesmagicae and corruptions of relatively normal texts, especially if bor-rowed from another language. There are several instances of heavilycorrupted Greek words in Latin texts, which after careful analysis andreconstruction turn out to be perfectly understandable metricalphrases, inter alia from Homer. Likewise, H. 528, a spell againstworms, very popular in the Middle Ages, revealed its secret only inthe 19th century. It appeared to be latinized Hebrew, namely Solo-mon’s Song 6:8:Sisim hemma mulahos usmonim pilagrim velamos einmisspar (“There are sixtyqueens and eighty concubines and virgins without number”)I do not know whom to admire more, the scholar who made thisdiscovery or the one81 who detected in the verba magica of an 8thcentury Latin spell AMICO CAPDINOPO ØIØPON DPACASIMOthe palindrome of a Greek hexameter: émÆsaw êrdhn ÙrofÆforon ¥drasas∞ma, (“having reaped I established a lofty-roofed monument”),79Instances of a variation of voces magicae written in Greek and Italic letters in Ö.21, 22, 26.80Not only in charms from late antiquity, but also, and especially, in medievalspells, where often the instruction is phrased in the vernacular, but the powerfulwords themselves in the holy language of the church: Olsan, “Latin Charms ofMedieval England”, 118; G. Storms, Anglo-Saxon Magic (The Hague 1948) counts 86Anglo-Saxon manuscripts out of which 68 contain Latin formulas. In seventeenthcentury England this could even result in the insinuation that a prayer in the Latinlanguage actually is a magical charm: K. Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic:studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century England (London 1971) 179.81L.W.

Indeed, many are the corruptions due to misunderstanding, theoriginal being so concealed that, as Heim sighed, “we need anotherOedipus to explain them”. However, at the same time he rightlywarns us not to think that all these strange formulas can be explained.For instance, for the reason—and here I return to a suggestion cau-tiously introduced above—that there is more to it than mere corrup-tion. For, first, as we already noted before, we often descry aconscious play with a word, and, second, it is not only foreign wordsthat tend to be corrupted. Take for instance Ö. 60, quoted above,where we read at the end of a carmen:agyos, aios, ayos, sanctus sanctus sanctus fiat fiat fiat amen.It is clear that in the first three words things went wrong because theyare taken from another language: Greek ëgiow. But this hardly ex-plains why three different words emerged. Clearly, the distortions are, atleast partly, caused by a process of purposive variation. A remarkableexample of this process is H. 122, apparently a spell against contu-sion:si vir est in collo, si mulier in invilico, sicut terra non tangat, ita sanguen viventaletantale vives sanguine tantale.I do not translate this, because it is untranslatable: although separatewords can be distinguished, the text as a whole presents nonsense.What we do see, however, is a marked drive to repetition, rhyme,alliteration, variation. Perhaps the original was something like:si vir est in collo, si mulier in umbilico, sicut terram non tangunt, ita sanguinem bibunttalem (?) Tantale bibes sanguinem, Tantale,in which Tantalus is asked to drink the blood (of the contusion),which, for that matter, is in sheer contradiction to his mythical inabil-ity to drink82 (or eat). But my point is that a meaningful Latin text hasbeen corrupted and rendered unintelligible by a process which can-not be attributed solely to the wear inherent in oral tradition butshould rather be viewed as a (poetic) desire—if not compulsiveness—to produce rhyme, repetition and variation.82In fact we have a spell with the words Tantale pie, pie Tantale, Tantale pie, atranscription from Greek: “Drink Tantalus”."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"     In all these cases—and there are many more83—we descry thetemptation to change a formula in order to make it more ‘magical’, aswe also noticed in the cumulation of voces magicae. This is, for instance,obviously the case in H. 66, a not completely comprehensible spellagainst a disease of the chest. In it we find the formula ut os ut os ut os.This must be a corruption and trigemination of ut hos, which nodoubt was intended to indicate the place where names of other suffer-ers should be inserted: “just like the following ...”, but which obvi-ously developed into a magical formula.84 Similar processes lie at theroot of such corruptions as that of the liturgical formula hoc est corpusmeum into hocus pocus and its extensions in a host of further formulas,in Dutch for instance: hocus pocus holle bolle bocus or hocus pocus pilatuspas/platneus, etc. etc. What we observe here is that the joy, (or theneed), of constructing “poetical” formulas takes its toll over the nor-mal requirements concerning meaning in everyday communication.A most interesting type, finally, is that a normal and meaningfulterm is followed by a variant form that does not have a lexical mean-ing but which forms the trait d’union with the world of magical terms.A good instance is H. 41:absi absa phereos (and after some manipulation): tollo te hinc totam,haemorhoida, absis paphar.Absis means “be gone” and in the second formula a magical wordpaphar is added. But in the sequence absi absa phereos, absis is firstdeconstructed into the lexically non-existent absi, the next step to-wards ‘magicalisation’ is the construction of a variant of this word:absa, which is followed by a completely different vox magica. A medi-eval spell to induce erotic desire in a woman85 has: amet lamet te misael,in which amet .. te means: “may she love you”, which however isinterrupted by a nonsense rhymeword lamet. Comparably, H. 184has: kuria kuria kassaria sourvrbi (kuria kuria kassaria sourorbi), inwhich the word kuria—if intended as a ‘normal’ word—means “mis-83Even if we take full account of simple mistakes.

Heim grants thesetwo words an accent, therewith acknowledging their lexical existence.He does not do the same88 with the words eÈprepe (euprepe) and uiou([h]uiou), although they closely resemble normal words: euprepe missesonly one letter to make it the vocative of the word of which euprepestateis the superlative. In the second formula we have in the wordeupretabene (eupretabene) an even worse ‘corruption’ of the same term.Hence, these two texts illustrate how abnormal and normal wordsmay intermingle, and in such a way that a form of address taken fromnormal communication—here and elsewhere in logoi of voces magicesvocative forms abound—continually lingers on the brink of normaland abnormal language, leaving the reader or user with the problemwhere exactly the world of the addressed person, demon or god mustbe sought. They also provide an additional illustration of how normalwords under the influence of their ‘magical’ context may graduallychange into ‘abnormal’ words. Our texts betray various different86Of course also in other types of magical texts, e.g. Daniel-Maltomini, I, no. 45,p.165: balev (at least suggesting ‘normal’ Greek) bolbev (not an existing Greekword, but not impossible in Greek) bolbevx (impossible in Greek) bolbesrv uufyv.87Note that it is not necessary to add incomprehensible words to ‘magicalize’ atext. This can also be done by lexically existing, but (to quote Pliny) “unexpectedwords” such as for instance crocodile in a text mentioned earlier or the interesting casein H. 48, §kte¤nei perikefala¤a bÊrsa, §ktÒw, §ktÒw, nÒs[ow], sugxe› p≈gvn ±¤yeow ≤m¤yeow,which perhaps means: “(the patient?) stretches out the skin of his head, (and says):out, out, illness, the beard of a young men, of a demigod, demolishes you”. I guessthat ≤m¤yeow is just a free addition to and variation of the foregoing ±¤yeow in order tomake the spell more persuasive.88As he had not done in the case of kuria in the preceding spell. Quite correctly,in his forthcoming Spells of Wisdom Gordon, while discussing the Ephesia grammataquoted above pp. 113-14, wonders whence these accents (“those satisfying marks ofphonetic orthodoxy”) were derived."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"     89Here are a few more: Ö. 33: Has preces dices: Horner laxi abcol fecesitias et iordodienlaecaon utus celi libera, in which at least et and celi (if identical to classical Latincaeli) and especially libera (“make free”)—while another codex adds virtus instead ofutus—can be recognized as normal words in the midst of the mass of nonsense words,which however at first sight would give the impression of orthodox language. Ö. 47,alotamentum sedraoton terfice isfinias nereta despone permofinet ment, hec mihi et Platoni in usumerat, of which the final part is perfectly understandable: “this was of help to both meand Plato”, but in the spell itself one continually doubts whether we have normalwords or not. Cf. also: J. Stannard, “Greco-Roman materia medica in medievalGermany”, Bulletin of the History of Medicine 46 (1972) 467. In such formulas the formalsimilarity of the magical formula and Jabberwocky becomes apparent.90In other words, the question as posed by K-Th. Zaurich, “Abrakadabra oderÄgyptisch? Versuch über einen Zauberspruch”, Enchorion 13 (1985) 119-32, is inter-esting from the perspective of origins (here: Egyptian) but not with respect to itsmeaning for later users, who had no inkling about origins or original meaning. Thesame is still true when it can be demonstrated that a seemingly ‘senseless’ string ofuntransparent voces magicae actually consists of originally Egyptian names or epithetsof gods, while, in addition, the total number of letters of that string is 24, as in amagical papyrus published by R.W. Daniel: “P.Mich.inv. 6666 Magic”, ZPE 50(1983) 147-154, and also in the latinized versions of Hebrew and Greek expressions.L.W. Daly, “A Greek Palindrome”, 95, asks just the right question: “When a scribecopies Greek in an England that understands no Greek, is there any comprehen-sion?” and gives just the right answer, namely that in this case “there would be onlythe scribe’s comprehension that he is copying magic and spells.”91Moreover, it is not necessary at all to assume that one single charm must havebeen the standard and that all variations from that text were somehow corruptions ofone kind or another. Olsan, “Latin Charms of Medieval England”, 125 n.21, makesa productive use of Lord’s concept of ‘multiformity’ (A. Lord, The Singer of Tales[Cambridge 1960] 119-20) for the understanding of so-called ‘variants’ of charms.stages of this process.89 For both these reasons these texts will be ofimmediate relevance to our final section.IV Some inferences and suggestionsWe have discussed three different strategies most typical of the magi-cal charm. Two famous lines of voces magicae in Cato served as anoverture to a survey of strange ‘magical’ words and names, and in theend our discussion of one of the central features of the charm, namelythe formal techniques, led us back again to these voces magicae. In thisrespect our most important conclusion concerns the relevance of thesearch for origins. The question whether the voces were meaninglesssounds right from the beginning, or were either relics from foreignlanguages or corruptions from perfectly normal language, has lostmost of its interest for our present issue.90 Not only have we seen thatall three processes regularly did occur, but—far more important—our texts display a propensity verging on obsession to create abnor-mal words (voces magicae), irrespective of the point of departure.91 Even if a"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"  ‒   formula originated in normal and comprehensible language, a some-times demonstrably deliberate process of deconstruction soon took itstoll. What we see, in other words, is a marked drive to alienation. In quitea different way from what philologists usually understand by it, weconclude that in the magical formula often the lectio difficilior is indeedmelior: the more difficult, aberrant, the less ‘normal’ a reading, thebetter it seemed in the eyes of the author, transmitter or user of thecharm. This means that the focus of our interest has now definitelyshifted from problems of origin towards problems of meaning. Weare back at our initial question: what is the meaning of the lack ofmeaning?If we ask Pliny, we learn from a passage quoted above that externaverba atque ineffabilia (foreign and inexpressible words) carry the expec-tation of something ‘immense’. Why? Various different but not mutu-ally exclusive answers are conceivable. Inspired by the literarytheorist Todorov,92 R. Gordon93 emphasizes the narrative aspects ofcharms, comparing them with cooking recipes. To this end they mustestablish rôles, actions and predicates. The basic rôles or participantsare the practitioner/magician, the patient/client and the object (thedisease). A mediator (spiritual power) may be the fourth rôle. Therelations between these rôles are of an authoritative nature. Throughthe act of addressing the disease the practitioner actually addressesthe patient, likewise convincing him of his authority, which is estab-lished by his command of specific, effective knowledge, among otherthings his knowledge of effective words: the peculiar words called vocesmagicae.94 Depending on the intended addressee, the utterances servetwo different goals: “The address operates on two levels. As a locutionto an inanimate object (the disease), it marks a non-standard socialevent requiring special interpretation. As an address in the secondperson with the deployment of a specific name (the client) it acts as asign of the inclusion of the named within a quasi social context”.Accordingly, Gordon pays much attention to the specifically rhe-torical and persuasive functions of words, expressions and formulas.The creation of foreign or new words, including the voces magicae, is92Especially T. Todorov, “Le discours de la magie”, L’Homme 13 (1973) 38-65 =idem, Les genres du discours (Paris 1978) 246-82.93Gordon, “The Healing Event”.94F. Graf, “Prayer in Magic and Religious Ritual”, in: Faraone & Obbink, MagikaHiera, 188-213, esp. 190-5, in some respects, concurs with this, but he focuses hisinterpretation rather on the relationship between magician and deity. One functionof the voces magicae is that of normal prayer: to express all potential names (= thesphere of the god’s activities), to ‘please’ the god.

It is“one among several means of marking the special status of the utter-ance, designating the power relation which the charm sets up be-tween practitioner and object”. By their very secrecy these words giveaccess to a wide applicability. “As utterances, in which the signifianthas almost completely if not entirely overwhelmed the signifié they aresemantic holes which can be filled by the practitioner by means ofany of a number of recuperative theories”. I must resist the tempta-tion to quote these revealing interpretations more extensively. What Iam going to suggest, then, is by no means an alternative interpreta-tion, since I generally accept Gordon’s ideas, but an additional viewof the strategies of magical formulas. In order to do so I make a fewpreliminary remarks.The theory just mentioned may be called functionalistic in so faras it focusses on the function(s) of the ritual use of voces magicae in orderto establish specific forms of social relationship including a position ofauthority for one of the participants. There are however other ap-proaches conceivable that may add their own value to the spectrumof possible interpretations. To my mind one of the real dangers thatchallenge our study is the categorical rejection and denunciation ofall former (or other) paradigms in defence of a monolithical glorifica-tion of one’s own.95 In short, our study is polyparadigmatic.Moreover, there is a more specific complication. The charms thatconstitute our primary material do not satisfy the social conditionsthat require an authoritative magician (as do for instance the incanta-tions of the extensive and very complicated magical papyri) andhence seem to resist at least this type of functionalistic interpretation.Generally, our charms do not presuppose a magician’s help. They areinstructions for domestic use “Hausmittel”,96 but nonetheless display95I have argued this in extenso in the Introduction of my Transition and Reversal inMyth and Ritual (Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion II, Leiden), 1-14, and tried tosubstantiate this argument throughout the book. In his magisterial “Aelian’s Peony:the location of magic in Graeco-Roman tradition”, Comparative Criticism 9 (1987) 59-95, though again arguing from a predominantly social point of view, Gordon hasmuch that points in the direction of my argument.96Of course, there are exceptions. The magical treatment of the luxation de-scribed by Cato was evidently a collective ritual. Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 45:“The ritual has a theatrical and also a collective aspect; it unfolds, I think, in front ofthree categories of persons, the ailing person, the healers, and the (family) commu-nity.” However, generally “charms are unique in that performance is typically pri-vate; the audience is often only one person—someone sick, injured, anxious ...”(Olsan, “Latin Charms of Medieval England”, 134). Accordingly, “we need to askwhy so many of the charms reported by Marcellus, for example, are for self-help bythe patient.” (Gordon, “The Healing Event”, 365)"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"  ‒   a broad range of voces magicae.97 And finally, even if we restrict our-selves to the voces magicae as markers of a special status of the utter-ance—expressing the specificity of the situation—, this approach,though explaining the social function of meaningless sounds, does notexplain the meaning of meaninglessness. Confronted with this problemscholars of an earlier generation used to refer to the mysteries hiddenin nonsense words, references to the uncanny, as required for evokinga magical atmosphere. Again, I am not denying this when I yet makean attempt to advance our understanding in a slightly different direc-tion.By way of aperture I would like to draw attention to a feature thatI have not mentioned so far: the very frequent instruction to write amagical spell with the left hand, or to write it reversely from right toleft, or with letters turned upside down etc.98 Though far more cur-rent in curse texts, similar devices are not lacking in other magicaltexts either. Many a spell seemed to consist of meaningless voces untilsomeone got the idea to read them from right to left and discovereda perfectly transparent text. How to explain this? Once more, varioussuggestions have been proposed: a desire for secrecy, for instance, orthe wish that the words or works of an opponent may end up asreversely as the letters of a curse. Indeed, this is sometimes explicitlyexpressed in defixiones. However, this may be true enough for cursetexts, but there is not really much need for using your left hand forwriting or acting in the context of the magical charm. So, again, whatmay be true for one type of magical text, need not be equally helpfulfor another. If we now start by simply noting what we see, the mostobvious observation is that we have here an act that is exactly thereverse of normal behaviour. It is ‘abnormal’ and belongs to a re-versed world.And let us now also consider the voces magicae from this angle. Whatsense is there in their employment? Here the ancients themselves can97They occur in about 16% of the charms collected by Heim, but there are manymore if one includes ‘unintelligible’ texts which do not give the impression of havingbeen intended as voces magicae. In the collection of Önnerfors, I count 25 incomprehen-sible texts in 60 charms, and in medieval charms voces magicae or nonsense words arevery common.98The prescription that a name should be written with inverted letters, e.g. Heimp. 556: scribe... nomen ipsius inversis litteris, or from right to left or with the left hand oralternatively with right or left hand (H. 221, 222). Cf. also the very common instruc-tion to handle the materia medica with the left hand. The latter instructions prove thatthe practices of writing from right to left or giving the mother’s name as an indicationof lineage, may be relics of older normal practice (see below), but should certainly noless be considered as expressions of the inversed world of magic."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"     put us on the right track. It appears that Pliny’s predicates externa(foreign) and ineffabilia (inexpressible) represent a common ancienttypology: the voces magicae are referred to with the following predi-cates: they are êshma (asema),99 êtopa (atopa)100 and bãrbara (bar-bara).101 And here at last we are in the centre of things. Asema means“without meaning, unintelligible”, atopa literally means “out of place”and acquires the meaning “strange, paradoxical”, and further: “un-natural”. Barbara means barbara, that is barbarous, referring to aforeign world. So, according to ancient interpreters the voces magicaehave no meaning of their own, they do not refer to particular objectsor concepts, but they do refer to a world. This, however, is not ourown world but a radically different one. There are many differentways to express this notion inherent in the voces magicae. Patricia CoxMiller102 suggests that the use of vowels and voces magicae was intendedto transcend not only writing but speech itself. Now the idea of tran-scending language is perhaps the most eloquent way of expressing thedeparture from our normality to another, ‘transcendent’, reality.With respect to the aspect of reversal, Jonathan Z. Smith has ana-lysed the late antique cultural tendency, essential to Gnosticism, totranscend this world through inverting its categories.103 Gordon ex-plains the distinctive function of using reversed script and other de-vices as an indication of the difference between communicativemodels in the two worlds, dominant and heteromorphous.104 But the99Lucian.

Frankfurter, “TheMagic of Writing”, 217 n.85.104Gordon, “Aelian’s Peony”, and also in a magnificent chapter on the ‘Subversionof Script’ in his forthcoming Spells of Wisdom. However, he does so primarily, it seems,in order to underline the special position of the magician or the special status of themagical act (“If normal orthography was the instrument of dominant, legitimateauthority, pseudo-paragraphia signified the character of the discourse of magic in theeyes of those who employed it: outsider, outcast, outlandish.”), rather than thespecificity of the potential of the other world as a source of power. Cf. his views onnew formal devices as being necessary for magical practice: “to affirm itself as adistinctive set of procedures in relation to the real world. It was thus ever on the lookout for new ways of representing and imagining its own distinctiveness.” In sum,Gordon sees these strategies of exploiting anomalies as principally intended to con-struct the self-representation of magic/magician to “represent its heteromorphouscharacter”. Cf. also Graf, Magic in the Ancient World , in the section “Magic andReversal”, 229-233. For the concept of the liminal as the stage for magical activitysee also: S.I.

Voces magicae, be-ing semantically vacant, can be applied (or interpreted) on more thanone level and in different functions. One is, I would suggest, that of‘open-ended’ performative utterances. Normally, performativeenunciations are expressions that are equivalent to action:105 the verbitself is the accomplishment of the action which it signifies. Since thevoces have no communicable meaning, however, they cannot denote oneexplicit—and consequently restricted—course of action, but givevoice to a choice of imaginable (or perhaps rather unimaginable) av-enues towards the desired effect.106In whatever way you phrase it, the conclusion is that the specificityof voces magicae and other anomalous expressions conveys them a spe-cial function of passwords that take us literally “out of our place” intoa different world, where paradox reigns, where you write with yourleft hand or from right to left, where you do not identify yourself withthe name of your father but with that of your mother: in short areversed reality, the world of abnormality, the world of otherness.107This world can be identified with foreign countries, especially thosemarked by ancient wisdom, or the land of barbarians, who evenderive their name from talking a language that sounds like rabarabar.As we saw, the voces magicae are marked by combinations of vowelsand consonants foreign to Greek or Latin languages and the word105“Jesus heals you now”, “be gone”, “I conjure you “, “I swear it”. The notion ofperformative expression was developed by J.L. Austin, How to Do Things with Words,(2nd ed. edited by J.O. Urmson & M. Sbisà, Cambridge Mass. 1975), and exploitedfor anthropological issues, especially magic, by: S.J. Tambiah: “The Magical Powerof Words”, Man 3 (1968) 175-208. Cf. idem, “Form and Meaning of Magical Acts: apoint of view”, in: R. Horton & R. Finnegan (eds.), Modes of Thought: essays on thinkingin Western and Eastern societies (London 1973) 199-229. Both in: idem, Culture, Thought,and Social Action (Cambridge Mass.-London 1985) 17-59; 60-86, where see also: “APerformative Approach to Ritual” 123-166. For the discussion of this notion andfurther literature see: Versnel, “Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Reli-gion”, 196 n.32; Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 206 ff. Cf. Gordon, “‘What’s in aList?”, 239 f.106This suggestion of ‘open-ended’ performative utterance seems to be exactly thereverse of poetry imitating the magical incantation. Analysing Sappho’s celebratedprayer to Aphrodite, Ch. Segal, “Eros and Incantation: Sappho and oral poetry”,Arethusa 7 (1974) 154, concluded: “the incantatory element is already a latent meta-phor”. More recently Th. Greene, Poésie et magie (Paris 1991), 50-2, qualifies Sappho’sincantatory poem as “pseudo-performatif: c’est un acte de langage imaginaire, où lavoix de la locutrice a priorité sur le prétendu but téléologique”.107For this interpretation vide supra nn. 76 and 98. After the completion of thepresent paper I saw that S. Greenwood, Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld (Oxford2000), argues exactly the same for modern magic as practised by contemporaryPagans in Britain. They consider communication with an otherworldly reality to bethe essence of magic, and the author argues that the otherworld forms a centraldefining characteristic of magical practice."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"     barbara in a number of variations is very popular in the magical for-mulas.Now, what do we know of the Greek and Roman concepts andconnotations of this imaginary world of ‘otherness’, be it a distantbarbarian country, or a utopian/dustopian never-never-land, or aprecultural mythical abode in the beginning, or an eschatological onein the end of time? Several things but one most of all: it is essentiallyambiguous—threatening or ridiculous on one hand, promising andimbued with abnormal power on the other. To use Pliny’s words, it isboth meaningless and immense. The flood of recent studies in‘otherness’ have greatly advanced our understanding of these oftenparadoxical traits. Otherness exists in gradations, from a completeopposition to normality in a radically reversed world to a mixture ofnormal and abnormal signs as we find them for instance inHerodotus’ largely imaginary descriptions of foreign barbarous coun-tries. Whatever their form, their lack of normal contours and theirambiguous nature make them the very places of creation.108 And—soI now suggest—it is this extraordinary creative potential to which themagical charm appeals. Though it is no doubt true that utteringsounds like borroborrobor does help to isolate the magical performancefrom normality, to emphasize its specificity, it is also true that lockingoff one side here involves an opening to another. If the magical for-mula helps to give access to the special creative potential embeddedin the world of otherness, then the magical act itself is an act ofcreation,109 evoking means that make what is normally impossiblemagically (that is abnormally) possible. Hence I propose to interpretthe drive to alienation, one of the central marks of magic, as such anappeal to creative forces not available in the normal world.So far we have been considering the first main theme, introducedin the first section of chapter III and to which we returned in thethird section, the voces magicae. However, side by side with alienationwe have also discussed another strategy. The second section of chap-108As for instance Mircea Eliade and Victor Turner have argued for the differentworlds in illo tempore and of the interstitial periods, respectively. I have investigated theambiguity of ‘otherness’, especially in its ‘pre-cultural’ and ‘interstitial’ aspectsinTransition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion II,Leiden), esp. in Ch. 2, on the myth and ritual of the god Kronos. In the same chapterthe interested reader will find references to the literature of ‘otherness’ (pp. 106-9).109In the first version of this paper I was not aware that B. Malinowski, TheLanguage of Magic and Gardening (London 1966) 238, already spoke of the “creativemetaphor of magic”. Thanks to a suggestion of Chris Faraone, I have learned thisfrom M.Z. Rosaldo, “It’s All Uphill: The creative metaphors of Ilongot magicalspells”, in: M. Sanches and B.G. Blount (eds.), Sociocultural Dimensions of Language Use(New York etc. 1975) 177-203."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"  ‒   ter III concerned the deployment of ‘normal’—by which I mean atleast lexically transparent—words and expressions that refer to analo-gies in the realm of nature or in the cultural, including the mythical,heritage. Does this, then, not contradict our earlier supposition? Thisquestion can be answered on different levels. First, magic is not amonolithic or mono-strategical art. It may appeal to a number ofdifferent instruments and resources. One of them is the general cor-pus of knowledge stored in the world of nature, culture and religion.The technique involved, especially comparison, simile, metaphor, iscalled parallelization by Todorov.110 One of its major objectives is, inthe words of Gordon,111 to serve “the insertion of a present contin-gency (the ailment or its healing) into the context of natural law orregularity (.......) The lesion or illness has destroyed an aspect of thatorder, which the healing event seeks to re-establish partly by the useof naturally powerful similes, partly by the construction of a specialkind of social situation”. Comparably, references to traditional similesfrom the great literary works or religious tradition “establish the (im-puted) past as a normative parallel to a present instance”. Together,these strategies also “assert the practitioner’s familiarity with a worldenruled”.In the context of medical prescription, this is an obvious and con-vincing explanation of the use of a certain type of simile or metaphor.The model serves as an authoritative instruction to the illness ‘how tobehave’. It is the ‘just so’ relationship between model and imitator.112And we may expect that ‘just so’ comparisons by their very naturerefer to ‘normal’, natural, or at least comprehensible models.113 Justas the wolf devours and drinks, so let my indigestion be healed. Just asthe woman with bleedings was healed by Jesus, so let my bleedingstop. However, once more, we must note that things are just a bitmore complicated. For how ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ are these references?110T. Todorov, Les genres du discours (Paris 1978).111Gordon, “The Healing Event”, 370.112On this analogical function of the simile as a ‘declarative utterance’ see: Frank-furter, “Narrating Power”.113This is the kind of “creativeness” meant by Malinowski and Rosaldo in theworks mentioned supra n.109. The magical spells of the peoples they study generallydo refer to attributes of the experienced world, which serve as models for the spell’sdesired outcome. “But the “power” of the spell as a whole depends less on theoriginality or uniqueness of these expressions than on the way in which they worktogether.” Differences in types of metaphor or similes are of course culturally deter-mined: Coptic curses excel in animal analogies of a distinctly everyday nature, whichhas been explained as a relic of the common use of animals in Egyptian folklore toarticulate human character (Meyer and Smith, Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts ofRitual Power, 149)."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"     Once having asked this question it immediately strikes the eye thateven within this category the majority of the references do not belongto the cultural centre of everyday experience, but to the realm of theextraordinary, the marginal and the exterior. This is obvious for theanimals included in the special category of the adunata, but apart fromthat category we find the following animals in the collection of Heim:spider, crocodile, sea-animals, bear, lion, dolphin, lizard, viper, andan occasional hare. For the rest (dead) dogs and (wild) wolves havepride of place. Apart from the dogs (generally associated withmagic)114 all these species belong to the world of the wild, the domainoutside the centre of culture as, of course, do the majority of themedicinal or magical plants or roots, which, as a rule are not to becollected in one’s backyard either. What I mean is this: while it is truethat some magical vehicles in our charms (especially the voces magicae)refer to the marvelous potential of a radically different ‘other world’,and others refer to nature,115 even the ones belonging to the latter114Cf. the dog sacrifice to Hekate. On the ambivalent status of the dog both insideand outside human culture, see: J.M. Redfield, Nature and Culture in the Iliad: the tragedyof Hector (Chicago-London 1975) 193-202. Wolves, on the other hand, though ofcourse belonging to the world of outer nature, have a share in men’s world as wellsince it is the animal par excellence into which men may change for a short period,especially during initiation. See: R. Buxton, “Wolves and Werewolves in GreekThought”, in: J.N. Bremmer (ed.), Interpretations in Greek Mythology (London 1987) 60-79; H.S. Versnel, Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Inconsistencies in Greek andRoman Religion II, Leiden 1993) 315 n.89; 330-2. On wolves as cultural models forhuman social processes in Longus, see: St.J. Epstein, “Longus’ Werewolves”, ClassicalPhilology 90 (1995) 58-73. On the lizard, no less popular in magic, see: A.D. Nock,“The Lizard in Magic and Religion”, in: Essays on Religion and the Classical World (ed.Z. Stewart, Oxford 1972) I, 271-6.115Of course, these two domains cannot be strictly distinguished or separated: theyare like extremes on a continuous scale. For that matter, I do not deny the existencenor underrate the importance of ‘natural’ or ‘folk’ medicine as for instance deployedby root-cutters, discussed by G.E.R. Lloyd, Science, Folklore and Ideology (Cambridge1983) 119-49. In the words of P. Brown, The Cult of the Saints (Chicago 1982) 114:“We must accept the medical pluralism of an ancient society”, illustrating this withan instance of modern Morocco where people make a distinction between illnessesfor the hospital and illnesses for the fqih and the Saint”, thus suggesting a differentia-tion between horizontal and vertical models of healing. Kieckhefer, Magic in theMiddle Ages, 1 ff. and “Erotic Magic in Medieval Europe”, 36, makes a distinctionwithin the boundaries of medieval magic between ‘natural’ and ‘demonic’ magic.This medical pluralism opens the possibility, if one does not work, to try another.The argument that a patient was given up by the doctors is standard in the recordsof ancient (and modern) miracle cures: O. Weinreich, Antike Heilungswunder (Giessen1909=Berlin 1969). But if the appeal to divine help does not yield effect you can trymagic: John Chrysostom preached against women who use magic when their chil-dren are sick rather than using the one true Christian remedy, the sign of the cross:“Christ is cast out, and a drunken and silly old woman is brought in” (Hom. 8 onColossians, quoted by Kieckhefer, Magic in the Middle Ages, 39)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"  ‒   category are not always so naturally natural either. The magical ormedical ingredients are not self-evident, should be collected in mar-ginal places (on the top of a hill), with the help of abnormal means(while uttering a spell, or using the left hand), at abnormal times (inthe middle of the night, at dawn or sunset) and often through theintermediary of eccentric persons (wise women). Even here, then,though not in the same sense as in the voces magicae, we are in (an-other) world ‘out there’,116 in the fringes of the known world, belong-ing to the category of spatial liminality.I believe this idea finds support too in the popularity of two typesof adunata in the magical charm. One refers to things that cannothappen in nature: “just as a mule does not propagate, a cock drinksbut does not urinate, an ant has no blood, so let my sickness disap-pear”. The other represents them as (for once) having happened:“Shepherds found you, collected you without hands, cooked youwithout fire, ate you without teeth”. Both, however, unequivocallyrefer to the non-normal, to the striking exception, i.e. to the‘otherness’ of the model, even if e contrario they set an example of howthe illness should behave.117Now, very much the same can be said of the historiolae that arebased on mythical models, for two reasons. First, they display an(understandable) preference for the marvelous: miracle stories havepride of place in the similes used in charms. But this is just anotherway of saying that once again there is an emphasis on the excep-tional: the narrative opens perspectives to a different world—or a116Gordon, “Aelian’s Peony”, one of the best—but strangely ignored—studies onthe position of ancient magic, has already pointed out the basic ambiguity of magic,being the vehicle between the normal world and the other. So he does in his forth-coming Spells of Wisdom, with an emphasis on the magical substance, for instance aplant, which by the ‘magical’ manipulation “enters a new register: it ceases to bewhat it actually is, a constituent of the natural world. It acquires a charged anddangerous status, entering a different system of rules, meanings and expectations.”That is exactly what I have in mind.117In Egyptian magic lists of adunata may serve to disqualify a demon or an illnessas being “not part of the ordered world and according to its principles shall not existat all”: J. Podeman Sørensen, “The Argument in Ancient Egyptian Magical Formu-lae”, 14, citing as an example: “who runs without a neck, who dances without hair,who hastens without any business, who comes to copulate without a phallus, whocomes to bite without teeth...”. (P.Geneva Rto. col. III,7-IV,1), very comparable withthe adunaton in our text. These instances and many more just contradict Gordon’sargument (“The Healing Event”, 368) that the implied purpose is to evoke the naturalrule, since anomalous behaviour or qualities in some species of animals (mules who donot propagate etc.), albeit exceptions, still belong to the order of nature. Moreover, ifso, why all the efforts of seeking or inventing striking adunata or anomalies and notdirectly refer to the obviously natural?"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"     different section of our world—, where just as in the other areasmentioned things can happen that normally are not possible. Thesecond (closely related) reason is that this mythical world is differentin another sense as well: it is the world of temporal liminality, the worldfor which Mircea Eliade coined the term in illo tempore, to whichmagical spells of many different cultures have recourse.118 Thus, wesee that, on the axes of both space and time the similes and historiolaeconverge to the same domain of liminality that was most explicitlyevoked by the voces magicae.However, not only the specific contents of the similes in our texts,but also their general function may be of relevance here. We have metmany types of similes, metaphors and comparisons in the magicalcharms, for instance parallelisms created by the patients or practition-ers themselves or analogies which have some relationship with theissue of the cure but in such vague terms of synecdoche or metonymyor even so paradoxical and illogical that in these cases at least thenotion of ‘authoritative model’ is not the first that comes to mind.Last but not least we have detected a most astonishing freedom if notarbitrariness in choice, adaptation, exchange and new creation ofanalogies and comparisons. Moreover, we observed that the logicalrelevance of a particular comparison is not always the most importantconsideration. What is seminal is the desire to insert the illness or thecure into a series, the mise en série. All in all it has become evident thatthe proliferation of new and often singular formulas is an essentialtrait of the magical charm. This gave us occasion to wonder if thisproliferation of new similes, being a process of creativity, might nothave something to do with the very nature of the magical charm.Recently, magical formulas have often been analysed for their lin-guistic and stylistic techniques and it was especially the anthropologistTambiah who has investigated the rhetoric of persuasion of the magi-cal act. I now suggest that besides rhetoric another concept (or animportant sub-division of rhetoric) is at least as relevant. I mean thepoetics of magical formulas. For, in fact, what we have seen is poetics118See above all: M. Eliade, “Magic and the Prestige of Origins”, in: idem, Myth andReality (New York 1963) 21-38. Important in this respect, especially on Egyptian andCoptic historiolae and their meaning: Frankfurter, “Narrating Power”, who summa-rizes Van der Leeuw’s and Eliade’s interpretations as “the performative transmissionof power from a mythic realm articulated in narrative to the human present ......Mythic episodes are continually powerful.” However, he qualifies their functions,partly in Malinowski’s track, as that of ‘precedence’ or ‘paradigm’, qualifying its goalas ‘active analogizing’, partly in the wake of Tambiah and others, viewing thehistoriola as a performative utterance."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"  ‒   in action. Free association, the use of similes, metaphors, analogies,metonymy, synecdoche, they are all basic poetical strategies, in fact,they are the stuff poetry is made of.119 If this is so, it may be relevantto ask what functions are performed by such tropes as metaphor andsimile in poetry. Here we need, of course, the help of specialists inliterary theory, rhetoric and stylistic, which I am not. But I do feelthat when Hector, on his appearance in the battlefield, is comparedwith “a raving forest fire in the mountains”, let alone “a snowymountaintop”, this analogon is not primarily intended as an authori-tative model “to put a present contingency into the context of naturallaw or regularity”. Many are the functions of simile, metaphor andmetonymy but one of the most obvious is not to include Hector in anatural regularity, but—exactly the reverse—to exlude him from hisnatural (social) world, to stage him in the spotlight and to say some-thing about him in a plastic, expressive and evocative way whichraises him from the ordinary to the extraordinary.120Furthermore, metaphors and similes offer the attraction ofpolysemy:121 Hector may be as raving as the fire, but also as threaten-ing, as tempestuous or everything together.122 So one of the simile’s119On the functions of these tropes (often referred to as “the play of tropes” or“polytropy”) as providers of imaginative potentialities in poetic language, see forinstance: P. Friedrich, Language, Context, and the Imagination: Essays by Paul Friedman(edited by A. S. Dil, Stanford 1979). Metaphor and simile are of course closelyrelated. N. Goodman, Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis1968) 77-8: “Instead of metaphor reducing to simile, simile reduces to metaphor, orrather the difference between simile and metaphor is negligeable”, quoted by L.Muellner, “The Simile of the Cranes and Pygmies: A study of Homeric metaphor”,HSCP 93 (1990) 59-101. A. Seppili, Poesia e magia (Turin 1971) 316, in a discussion of“la metafora e la similitudine” calls them the “più importanti figure poetiche.”120Which, of course, does not imply that the similes themselves need to refer tounnatural or irregular events. G.E.R. Lloyd, Polarity and Analogy (Cambridge 1966)189, stresses the constancy of the world in the similes (as for instance in the consist-ency of animal behaviour) as against its accessibility to experience. Long before him,H. Fränkel, Die homerischen Gleichnisse (Göttingen 1921) 72-3, had argued the same.Nor does it deny that similes are often traditional. Like historiolae in magical spellsthey may have a long history. See for both: L. Muellner, o.c. preceding note.121I. L. Pfeijfer, Three Aeginetan Odes of Pindar (Diss. Leiden 1996), 23-4, singles outmetaphor as one special instance of the notion of ‘implicitness’, which “grants thehearer the pleasure of finding out himself how things cohere”, but may also “result inpolyinterpretability (...) leaving the door open for multiple relevance.” A.B. Weiner,“From Words to Objects to Magic: hard words and the boundaries of social interac-tion”, Man 18 (1983) 690-709, esp. 698: “the use of metaphors widens the range ofpossible associations”. Cf. Tambiah, “The Magical Power of Words”.122Olsan, “Latin Charms of Medieval England”, 131, makes just this point inconnection with the polyreferentiability of Christain charms, speaking of a “constel-lation of associations such as: Job [who is always invoked against worms], sufferedthis way, loved God, was loved of God; Job, as a Holy Man, has power from Godand as a Holy Man dispenses that power to those in need....”"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"     contributions to the locution is polysemy, its wealth of potential refer-ences. It opens perspectives which had not been available before thecomparison, and by revealing a choice of different new aspects itentails a change in the quality of the subject, in the context of charmseither that of the patient or that of the illness. The comparison makesthe patient’s perspective different from what it was before because itinvests it with a new potential of unexpected qualities. Recent theo-ries even claim that metaphors mould a radically new entity from thecombination of the two components in the comparison.123This, then, is by and large what I had in mind when speaking ofthe creative potential of the magical charm. It is as if the inventive-ness of each user and transmitter, his personal capacity to add, trans-form, adapt and create similes and their applications, is a reflection ofthe small margins of—and the desire to expand—his power to influ-ence things. His personal manipulation of expressive language has aresonance in the expected effects of the healing event. Both are crea-tional processes, one within the power of man—of each individualman provided he is in possession of the necessary instruments—andone beyond his power, but perhaps liable to influences through magi-cal charms. Seen in this light, both frames of reference that we dis-cussed: the world of abnormality—to which the voces magicae refer—,and the domain of nature, culture and religion, are put into action insuch a way that new qualities become available.124 These qualities lie inthe domain of and are produced by genuine acts of creation. And one123C. Bicchieri, “Should a Scientist Abstain from Metaphor?”, in: A. Klamer et alii(eds.), The Consequences of Economic Rhetoric (Cambridge 1988), developing ideas intro-duced by I.A. Richards and Max Black. Cf. T.Turner, “We are Parrots”, “Twins areBirds”: Play of Tropes as Operational Structure”, in: J.W. Fernandez (ed.), BeyondMetaphor: The theory of tropes in anthropology (Stanford 1991) 121-58, esp. 123-130. In thefield of Egyptology similar views of the function of simile and metaphor have beenexplored with remarkable success. P. Sørensen, “The Argument in Ancient EgyptianMagical Formulae”, Acta Orientalia 45 (1984) 9-13, discusses five links between theEgyptian historiolae and the ritual contexts. Several of them imply a collapse of theboundaries between the human situation and the mythical dimension even to theextent that the affliction itself may acquire a mythical status or parts of the body maybe ‘mythically re-defined’. This is precisely what I had in mind, when speaking of thesimile’s function as “raising the subject from the ordinary to the extraordinary”.124In a different context (the re-interpretation and novel combination of existingrituals in defixiones), Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, 134, expresses the same idea:“This permanent search for new combinations of meaning seems characteristic of thesorcerer’s world. (....) What is at stake is not a mystical, “sympathetic” harmonybetween objects and people, but rather the construction of a universe in which thingsand acts carry a new and completely unusual meaning, entirely different from every-day life.”"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"  ‒   of their main vehicles is the word. “Words, both tropes and ‘hardwords’, are the formal elements that create the potential power to enablespeech to shift or recreate perceived realities”, as Annette B. Weiner says in afascinating article125 on the magical application of ‘hard words’.Finally, it is not difficult to see that this is also the very implicationof our observations concerning the third theme we have discussed:the use of formal techniques such as repetition, variation, anaphora,rhyme etcetera. There, too, we observed an extreme individual free-dom to devise new creations, by way of gradual or abrupt transfor-mation. While forming the technical traît d’union between the twoworlds explored in the magical charm, these formal strategies are alsoexpressions of the same creational process126 and they pre-eminentlybelong to the realm of poetics. Surely, many of these devices alsobelong in the domain of rhetoric. Yet, although certainly being arhetorical art, magic is both more than and, in many respects, differ-ent from ‘normal rhetoric’. For, as we have seen time and again, inthe magical spell rhetoric often runs wild in explosions of repetition,variation and transformation of such hyperbolic dimensions as couldnever be tolerated in normal communication, since they would entailits ruin. Cato, as we already noted, was very good in powerful words.He was an expert in both the formulas which belong to normal com-munication and those that refer to another world. His famous dictumCeterum censeo Carthaginem delendam esse is an instance of pure rhetoric,deriving its power from its reiteration as a peroration attached to anyspeech he gave. Now, precisely this fact, the aprosdoketon effect, lends ita certain circumstantial magical quality as well. Being pronouncedafter every speech on whatever topic, it more often than not wascompletely out of (logical) order, which is at least one of the charac-teristics of certain components of the magical charm. It was the com-bination of reiteration and unexpectedness that made it ‘work’. Huat,hauat, huat ista pista sista dannabo dannaustra, on the other hand, thoughbeing rhetorical too, is intrinsically ‘magical’ by nature in that it is aperversion of normal language and does not communicate a semanticmessage.125A.B. Weiner, “From Words to Objects to Magic: hard words and the bounda-ries of social interaction”, Man 18 (1983) 690-709, esp.705. The italics in the quota-tion are mine.126This is even more conspicuous in the case of the characteres, which form a largestructure of creations out of nothing, though created on the model of orthodox script,and which gave every magician ample opportunity to give rein to his own creativeimagination."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"     Summarizing we can say that the magical charm, from the perspec-tive taken in this essay, is the product of a (happy?) alliance: one of itsconstituents is the expectancy of a marvelous potential in anotherworld outside the cultural centre of everyday life, be it in the spatialfringes of the natural world or in the margins of time, or, on the otherhand, in a completely ‘other world’ beyond the boundaries of placeand time. The other is language or at least oral utterance, which caneither belong to common communication and take its resort to ahyperbolic deployment of rhetorics, or transcend speech and moredirectly refer to—or, as I would tend to say now, help create—theworld of ‘otherness’.In both these functions, and especially in the combination of both,the language of the magical formula forms a trait d’union between thenormal and the other world. Apart from the direct and explicit refer-ences to different marginal worlds that we have amply discussed, wediscovered the following strategies to achieve this:– the alternation and above all the combination of expressions innormal language and voces magicae (“asca, basca, rastaia, serc, cercer,recercel. Nothing is it, nothing is it, nothing it will do”),– references to various kinds of adunata (“mula non parit”),– the very characteristic technique to repeat a vox magica once ortwice, either without or with slight alterations, after which there isa sudden radical change in the following element(s) (“argidammargidam sturgidam”),– the sudden ‘alienation’ in the third term of a series of three ‘nor-mal’ words (“apolithôthêti, apoxulôthêti, apokordulôthêti”),– the ‘corruption’ of words belonging to normal formulas into un-common or illogical words (“sta crocodile”),– the corruption (‘magicalization’) of normal words into voces magicae(“Go, nemesoth, go out ...”).– the gradual ‘magicalization’ in formulas such as: “absi absa phereos”and “kuria kuria kassaria”,– the interjection of normal words, especially, in the vocative form,into series of voces magicae (“sakmadan euprepestate dapnounê”),All of these strategies, each in its own way, are most eloquent illustra-tions of our previous inferences. They are miniatures, as it were,partial but minutely detailed representations of magic’s references toanother reality, thus once more demonstrating that the relationship oftext and reality is one of synecdoche. But they are more than repre-sentations, they function as keys that open the door, or sometimesrather crowbars that raze the walls, between two worlds, eitherthrough amalgamating their two languages or by the (gradual or"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"  ‒   abrupt) alienation of orthodox language into a heteromorphous one.Nor is this all: by these very techniques they contribute to the creation ofthat other world with its marvelous potential.127 They do so by an act ofpoetics. Poetics in the double sense implied in my argument: the artof making poetry and the art of creation. For the word poetics comesfrom Greek po¤hsiw (poiesis), which has a double meaning: ‘creation’and ‘poetical composition’.128 Hence the title of this essay: the poeticsof the magical charm.127Hence, in its own specific way magical language satisfies one (though certainlynot all) of the characteristics of ritual language as expounded by W.T. Wheelock,“The Problem of Ritual Language: From Information to Situation”, The Journal of theAmerican Academy of Religion 50 (1982) 49-71, esp.58: “In general, then, ritual utter-ances serve both to engender a particular state of affairs, and at the same timeexpress recognition of its reality. Text and context become manifest simultaneously.”128The ancients themselves were convinced of and much reflected on the enchant-ing effects of language in general and rhetorics and poetry in particular. The termy°lgein and cognates are central to this issue. In a wider context, too, the connectionbetween incantation and poetry has been often and profitably studied. I mentiononly a few important titles. For the enchanting effects of rhetorics see: J. de Romilly,Magic and Rhetoric in Ancient Greece (Cambridge Mass.-London 1975); for poetry asincantation: Ch. Segal, “Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry”, Arethusa 7(1974) 139-60; H. Parry, Thelxis: Magic and Imagination in Greek Myth and Poetry(Lanham MD 1992). Gordon has an excellent discussion in his forthcoming Spells ofWisdom. In the early phases of many languages song/poetry and charm/incantationwere covered by one word: A. Seppili, Poesia e magia, 188 ff.; Th. Greene, Poésie etmagie (Paris 1991) 14-6. While Parry, 198, emphasizes the difference between magicand poetry: “Magic remains a conservative, formulaic, rote-bound exercise, whilepoetry is by its very nature inventive, free to choose its meter, content, tone andintention”, I prefer Greene’s view that magic shares with poetry the element ofcreativity: “ce fiat (...) est la source de son énergie créatrice,” but that they differ intheir capacities to realise that fiat. Comparably, Seppili 347: “La poesia comepoiesis—come azione magica che esprime ed evoca alla presenza una (super)realitàcreativa.”"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"     BAudollent, A., Defixionum tabellae (Paris 1904)Ankarloo, B. and S.

The benefits of this approach are obvious: on the onehand, an earnest attempt to dislodge the weighty legacy of JamesFrazer’s “magical worldview”; on the other hand, the acknowledg-ment that people in their own cultural systems use such descriptivelabels for political, sectarian, or simply taxonomic reasons, even withlittle reality behind the labels. Practically any practice, that is, mightbe labelled “magical” or “sorcery” under certain conditions.1However, throughout this social-construction-of-religious-catego-ries approach, there has been little advance in the understanding andclassification of the historical figures who really practiced out therebeyond this labelling, regardless of the pressures and dangers suchlabelling brought with it. Scholars have consistently reached back toan ideal “magician” type such as Weber, Van der Leeuw, or indeedWalt Disney might concoct. And yet this ideal type has been largelyshattered by voluminous ethnographic and historical evidence for thelocation and shape of ritual expertise in local cultures. The GreekMagical Papyri, for example, are now more accurately locatedamong innovative members of the Egyptian priesthood during thethird-/fourth-century decline of the Egyptian temple infrastructurethan among some putative class of magoi, for which we have no docu-1See esp.

Descriptive categories and idealtypes are not bad in themselves, then, for they allow the historian ofreligions to study the relationships between various characteristics orfacts that cluster together in apparent patterns: “magic” and socialmarginality, perhaps, or literacy and spell-composition, or urban en-vironments and charismatic competition, or (to draw from anothercontext) masculinized gods and mountains. Are these characteristicsrelated intrinsically or historically—transiently? One discovers thenature of these patterns through comparison of specific cases in theirhistorical and social context; one constructs descriptive categories todenote those patterns (“magician,”“priest,”“prophet”); but then thosecategories themselves must be “rectified”—that is, modified accord-ing to the nuances we discover through further comparison and test-ing.3 This is what I propose to do here with the phenomenon I willgenerally label “ritual expertise,” using examples somewhat arbitrar-ily from Africa and the African diaspora, medieval and early modernEurope, and, for the sake of this volume’s focus (and my own exper-tise), the ancient Mediterranean world. (The few examples from be-yond these cultural parameters should be taken to suggest that themodels proposed are universally applicable).By “ritual expertise” I mean, at the very least and in the mostgeneral sense, the making of amulets and remedies, the performanceof small-scale rituals for explicit ends (like healing), and the oral ormanual synthesis of local materials and “official” symbols to rendersacred power. Certainly everyone in every culture knows some of thislore—or at least has the ability to construct ritual and amulet out ofavailable materials. But some individuals gain this knowledge asmembers of families that maintain sizeable ritual traditions, handeddown along male or female lines.4 And some individuals, whether byvirtue of this inheritance, their skill at ritual synthesis, their professed2David Frankfurter, “Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of theCategory ‘Magician’,” Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium, ed. by PeterSchäfer and Hans G.

It is atype of charisma, in the sense of a supernatural prestige with whichsomeone is endowed in the eyes of others: a social status.5The variety of concerns that ritual experts address extends fromhealing and protection to the finding of lost things and the retentionof husbands and lovers. Indeed, local cultures invariably have a diver-sity of ritual experts in various forms of healing and divination; andmuch as some cultures “map” their regional saint-shrines accordingto specialty, so also do people perceive and map the diversity of ritualexperts according to such features as their specialties, their talents,their means of power, their relative proximity or marginality, theiradherence to an official religion or tradition, and their relative nov-elty.6While acknowledging this diversity of ritual expertise, this paperavoids the multiplication of ever more sub-types of ritual experts—diviner, clairvoyant, healer, shaman—since more ideal types do not fithistorical and cross-cultural actualities any better than the few oldones.7 To proceed in the historical and ethnographic understandingof ritual expertise we need not a reformulation of static patterns butrather the framing of a limited series of patterns or clusters of charac-teristics of ritual experts, a series that admits overlap and aids (ratherthan resists) historical nuance.I Community Ritual Experts: Local and PeripheralThe first realm of ritual expertise I want to address consists of thatextensive domain of healers, diviners, wise women, and holy peoplefound in virtually every society: conjure-doctors, houngans and mambos,5See, e.g., Barbara Kerewsky Halpern and John Miles Foley, “The Power of theWord: Healing Charms as an Oral Genre,” Journal of American Folklore 91 (1978): 903-9; Hans Sebald, “Shaman, Healer, Witch: Comparing Shamanism with FranconianFolk Magic,” Ethnologia Europaea 14, 2 (1984): 125-42, esp. 128.6On the mapping of saint shrines: William A.

The implications of relative location ofritual experts echoes roughly those that Victor Turner observed forpilgrimage shrines.9 The local wise woman or curandero works as afamiliar member of the community, who inherited his or her powersfrom previous familiar members, whose domains of expertise andritual expand, contract, and change with changes in the immediatecommunity.10 Connaissance is the Voudou word for that special abilityin some local ritual experts to know clients’ problems and the directiontheir ritual resolution should take; and it is a social knowledge, inextri-cable from the public, performative circumstances in which the ritualexpert works.11 Local ritual expertise, then, utilizes and reflects com-8Useful studies of this area of ritual expertise include: Thomas, Religion and theDecline of Magic, 177-92, 200-204, 206-8, 212-22, 227-52; Carl-Martin Edsman, “ASwedish Female Folk Healer from the Beginning of the 18th Century,” Studies inShamanism, ed. by Carl-Martin Edsman (Stockholm: Almqvist and Wiksell, 1962),120-65; Kathryn C.

Whether itinerant or es-tablished on the periphery of settlement, such a ritual expert may becredited with powers that surpass those available in the local milieu.He may attract clients and supplicants over a much broader territory,much as do regional temples or shrines. And yet, this ritual expertmay not serve to bind disparate communities—e.g., as do peripheralpilgrimage centers that are attended and honored by numerous re-gional villages. Indeed, the peripheral ritual expert may be the objectof some suspicion, bearing as he does that symbolic outsiderness oftentaken as danger.12 Thus his amulets and ritual cures may be seen assomewhat more exotic, but the stories that circulate around him mayenvision him as sorcerer as well as healer. The appeal of such periph-eral ritual experts is well-illustrated in Africa, where regional healingcults can attract people for hundreds of miles around.13 The potentialdanger of such experts in the eyes of local people, on the other hand,is reflected in much African-American folklore, in which itinerant orregional conjurers are credited with darker forms of ritual and de-scribed as in tension with local healers. Zora Neale Hurston recordedthe story of a rivalry between a rural African-American communityritual expert, “Aunt Judy,” and a more mysterious and powerful ex-pert on the social and geographic periphery, “Uncle Monday.”Year after year this feeling kept up. Every now and then some littleincident would accentuate the rivalry. Monday was sitting on top of theheap, but Judy was not without her triumphs.Finally she began to say that she could reverse anything that he couldput down. She said she could not only reverse it, she could throw it backon him, let alone his client. Nobody talked to him about her boasts.Mediums and the Articulation of Consensus among the Zezuru of Southern Rhodesia [Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1976], 68-69, quoted in Thomas W.

Perhaps Judy feltsafe in boasting for this reason.14A business rivalry thus progressed into a ritual rivalry; and finally (thelegend concludes), Uncle Monday defeated Aunt Judy in a frighten-ing display of power. For local people, the result was an extensivebody of legends describing Uncle Monday’s mysteries and dangers.Indeed, such a folklore of the peripheral expert’s danger is commonto communities working out the relationships and differences amongritual experts.15It must be remembered that this danger is a matter of perception,not of the rituals they actually perform. Some peripheral ritual ex-perts might capitalize on these perceptions and stage exotic or hostilerites for some clients. But there is little evidence for people workingthis way—“from the left hand”—by profession. Rumors and accusa-tions to this effect seem to arise under particular social circum-stances—panics or rivalry, for example—and tend to polarize themarginally-based ritual experts as entirely evil “sorcerers.”Conversely, there are innumerable examples of cooperation and ex-change between peripheral and local ritual experts, as when local heal-ers claim the authority of or recommend visits to regional shrines, orwhen more “familiar” experts refer ambiguous matters to peripheralspecialists (like exorcists), or when local and regional experts combineforces to negotiate a community problem (e.g., in cases of witch-cleansing, as discussed below). Both local and peripheral experts cangain prestige from such cooperation: the peripheral expert by thedeference shown her from the “center,” the local expert by signifyinghis participation in a wider network of ritual expertise and shrines.1614Zora Neale Hurston, The Sanctified Church (Berkeley: Turtle Island, 1981), 38.15See, e.g., Hurston, The Sanctified Church, 31-40, and Elizabeth McAlister’s discus-sion of the Haitian bòkò: “A Sorcerer’s Bottle: The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti,”Sacred Arts of Haitian Voudou, ed. by Donald J.

Hagiographical texts refer tothe competition between holy men or saints’ shrines and local ritualexperts; but in so doing they often reflect the intimacy between theexperts and their communities, much like Aunt Judy in her secureposition of boasting. Gregory of Tours describes “the custom of therustics [in sixth-century Gaul to] obtain bandages and potions fromsortilegi and harioli”; however, Gregory avers, “a little dust of thebasilica [of St. Martin] has more power than those men with theirwitless remedies.”17 It is in a ritual domain of vital concern and tradi-tion—healing—that the St. Martin shrine seeks to compete. So alsoin sixth-century Asia Minor, a village headman cannot wait for St.Theodore of Sykeon to heal his brother through blessings, so he runs“to a woman who used enchantments” for an amulet.18 The sameVita of St. Theodore describes a man who “dwelt in the same villageas the saint and was a skilled sorcerer, versed in wickedness.” It wasthis person who provided the major ritual services—amulets, healing,protection—in the village of Sykeon, thus posing (like Aunt Judy inthe story above) immense competition to St. Theodore, athaumaturge operating from the periphery.19 In general, then, oneperceives around the Mediterranean a culture of discrete religiousworlds, based in village societies. And the ritual experts who aidedthese worlds were essential parts of those societies. It is no wonderthat the attempt to install a Christian cult laying claim to an areamuch more expansive than just the village environment required suchviolent competition at the village level.20Peripheral ritual experts existed as well in antiquity, but the pecu-liar Roman ambivalence towards marginal or exotic religious prac-tices has left us with little more than the words goès or magos, plasteredacross a diversity of ritual experts in a vain attempt to classify them or17Gregory of Tours, Miracles of St. Martin, 26-27, tr.

We note alsothat, according to our sources, Alexander and Apollonius eachearned their thaumaturgical reputations in affiliation with some well-recognized tradition of the time: the gods Asclepius and Apollo forAlexander, Pythagoreanism for Apollonius.22These affiliations do not mean that Alexander and Apolloniuswere simply “priests” of certain gods or traditions. “Priest” is anunhelpful category if it groups together figures serving within an ex-tensive cultic institution with figures who, by family tradition, initia-tion, or call, maintain or develop idiosyncratically a small local orregional shrine. Alexander and Apollonius’s “affiliations” highlightone of the crucial skills in ritual experts both local and peripheral,skills particularly well-represented among the independent shrine-professionals of West Africa and Haiti: their ability to synthesize.Whether in the form of an amulet, the staging of an altar, the weav-ing of prayers and spells, or the codification of gesture, ritual expertsthe world over bring together the old and the new, the traditional andthe exotic, the hand-made and the imported, and—if literate—theauthority of writing with the concrete efficacy of the written letter. Itmay be, indeed, by virtue of his technological expertise that a localindividual might be viewed as capable in ritual preparations: for ex-ample, local scribes and intellectuals who wrote out amulets for peo-ple who asked.2321On the use of “magos” for itinerant or otherwise exotic ritual experts see Frank-furter, “Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt,” 131-35; Fritz Graf, Magic in the AncientWorld, tr. by Franklin Philip (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997),chap. 1; and for eighth- and seventh-century (BCE) Greece, Walter Burkert, “Itiner-ant Diviners and Magicians: A Neglected Element in Cultural Contacts,” The GreekRenaissance of the Eighth Century B.C.: Tradition and Innovation, ed. by Robin Hägg (Stock-holm: Swedish Institute in Athens, 1983), 115-20.

She must be adroit enough inshrine construction, amulet manufacture, and spell composition thatclients will perceive not only her grandmother’s gifts but also her ownremarkable attention to a changing environment. Far from the inde-pendent, churchless magician imagined by the Durkheim school,ritual experts often define religious activity in their vicinities, integrat-ing society, supernatural cosmos, landscape, and an immense body oftradition through their séances. In the case of Alexander of Abo-noteichos we see an individual who incorporated quite well-knownreligious idioms in defining his powers—oracles, images, speech-forms, Asclepian allusions—much as contemporary curanderos, santeros,mambos, and houngans incorporate Catholic mythology. It is, indeed, inthe ritual experts’ activities that we can best see the deliberate inter-action of what Robert Redfield called the Little Tradition and the GreatTradition.24II Quasi-Institutional Literati: Local and PeripheralTo make use of Redfield’s ideal dichotomy it is important to recog-nize (as Redfield himself stressed) that neither “tradition” exists byitself, especially in the complicated cultural mixtures that come withChristianization and Islamization. However, it is interesting and im-portant to consider how representatives of religious institutions are viewed inthe perspective of local communities. They bear with them, either inskill or general “aura,” the authority of an idealized Great Tradition,supernaturally powerful through its global scope. Here, then, is thesecond area of ritual expertise to be addressed: those who “stand for”Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or some more inchoate, if recogniz-able and authoritative, religious ideology—and who serve ritually theneeds of local society. It is writing culture itself, Ernest Gellner hasobserved, that “engender[s this] class of literate specialists, in alliance“Astrology and Writing in Madagascar,” Literacy in Traditional Societies, ed. by JackGoody (Cambridge: Cambridge U.P., 1968), 278-96, esp. 281-83; Gordon, “Lucan’sErictho,” 236-37; David Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt, 211-13, 257-58.

But just like the latter, there are observable differences intechnique and “performance” between (a) those literate specialistswho are based locally—local priests, clerics, scribes, rabbis, monks—and thereby become part of local culture; (b) those who are itinerant;and (c) those who offer personalized ritual services at peripheral saint-shrines or temples.The local ecclesiastic, who weaves the cadences and mythology oforthodox liturgy and cosmology with the exigencies and spirits of thelocal cosmos, has been well-documented in Byzantine and medievalChristian cultures. Karen Jolly’s analysis of Anglo-Saxon elf-charmspoints over and over to the synthetic capabilities of local priests, whilethe extensive corpus of Coptic amulets and grimoires reflects localChristian priests and monks in Egypt.26 In ancient Egypt too, so tem-ple documents testify, it was the temple-priests who applied “official”mythology and ritual technique to the realities of healing, childbirth,and protection.27 Ancient Mesopotamia held two categories of literatehealing experts, roughly comparable to a healer and a pharmacist,whose cumulatively broad range of ritual activities are reflected in themanuals they used.28 And so also Buddhist monks in Thailand, rabbisof all periods and places, and Muslim clerics in various African com-munities—all these figures mediate the sacred texts, teachings, super-natural world, and authority of their Great Tradition into the localworld.

First,their literacy, particularly in the texts and scripts of the Great Tradi-tion, endows them with a unique prestige in the community, for theycan transform the rational or “informative” sense of sacred texts intoa “performative” sense, producing the numinous, empowered letter,amulet, or edible verse out of the official words, prayers, and pages ofscripture. Craftsmen of the written word, they can turn mere lettersinto gods, shapes, images, and all manner of “performative” orillocutionary arrangements.30 Secondly—and related to their controlover sacred texts—their charisma lies in their official or quasi-officialstatus as designated representatives—authorized extensions—of theGreat Tradition. In a sense, this official status sets him apart from therest of his social environment.

The Coptic “magi-cal” corpora, for example, reflect people journeying from their homesto monasteries or saints’ shrines, to get amulets, oracles, or healingfrom monks and scribes. Moroccan Muslim pilgrims to the mountainshrines of saints (walis) find there official guardians (muqaddams) whocan interpret dreams, advise, and provide amulets and prayers in thename of the saint.31 Ethiopian villagers receive the itinerant services ofthe debtera, a minor cleric responsible for both official liturgical dutiesand exorcistic healing, with multiple roles in between.32In the case of the Coptic monastery and the shrine of the Muslimsaint in North Africa, the ritual expert seems to become a relativelyimpersonal representative of what Turner called “the Center OutThere”—that is, the pilgrimage goal, the culminative sacred place.33The shrine expert is simply the person who provides pilgrims with themantic advice and concrete blessings they seek. In the case of theEthiopian debtera, however, his itinerant lifestyle and his specialty inexorcism and the manipulation of demons have created suspicion andeven stigma in the eyes of villagers.34 Thus, as the monk or shrinefunctionary provides ritual services in an air of anonymity and estab-lished sanctuary, the itinerant cleric plies his ritual crafts on the cuspof Great Tradition, local tradition, and personal innovation—and asa bearer of that alternately dangerous and alluring “charisma ofotherness” some anthropologists have described.35III ProphetsAs we scan the field of ritual experts from those “next-door,” en-sconced in local tradition, to those on the outskirts of and even aliento local tradition, we find some who are most extreme in their mar-ginality to culture—almost pitted against it.

We often apply the word“prophet” to such figures, but it is less helpful to invoke Weber herethan to follow modern anthropologists in seeing the prophet, too, as abricoleur—a combiner of immediate and distant idioms, local andbroad scopes of identity, and a sense of the radically new with therecognizability of something altogether traditional.36 As we see themin Melanesia, in Africa, in native America, in Medieval Europe, andin the deserts of Byzantium, prophet-figures articulate a new frame ofreference: a new scheme of the cosmos and of social relations. Butmore importantly, they place themselves in the middle of theseideologies as thaumaturges—miracle-workers, ritual experts, media-tors of the supernatural world. They develop new rituals, new protec-tive amulets (especially for warfare), and new healing rites.37Thaumaturgy and the ritual expertise that brings it are so central tothe roles prophets occupy because they dramatize the new ideologyand its promises.38 The emphasis on the expulsion of demons, forexample, that one so often finds among Christian prophet-figuresreflects not the native cosmos of capricious and beneficial spirits butrather the Christian ideology as it encounters and polarizes the nativecosmos. The Christian prophet-figure, then, both perceives and hasthe power to expel this new cosmic moietie of demons.This model of ritual expertise is borne out especially well amongEgyptian desert monks like Antony and Shenoute, whose writings,36Peter Worsley, The Trumpet Shall Sound: A Study of “Cargo” Cults in Melanesia (2nded.; New York: Schocken, 1968), xiv-xviii; Kenelm Burridge, New Heaven, New Earth:A Study of Millenarian Activities (Oxford: Blackwell, 1969), 30-32, 153-63.

But eventoday one sees this pattern in Christian exorcistic cults and theirspecialists. In Sri Lanka, for example, a Father Jayamanne gainedenormous regional charisma for his dramatic exorcisms at the Marianshrine of a small village. A typical pattern thus begins to emerge inthe interconnection between the promotion of a new ideology (e.g.,Christ’s power over demonic local gods), dramatic exorcistic ritual,and widespread thaumaturgical reputation. The same pattern seemsalso to explain early traditions of Jesus as a thaumaturge: both theSynoptic Sayings Source (Q) and the Gospel of Mark reflect a pecu-liar emphasis on exorcism and demonology.39But Egyptian monks did not just do exorcisms; they offered heal-ing, divination, spells, blessings, and amulets, a phenomenon re-corded in all kinds of sources. For many villages monks came tofunction as the chief ritual experts, addressing all manner of everydaymisfortune from their cells and caves with all types of ritual andgesture—even to the point of winning disapproval from some officialquarters for unorthodox practice. So, for example, the fifth-centuryCoptic abbot Shenoute complains how, in his time,... those fallen into poverty or in sickness or indeed some other trialabandon God and run after enchanters or diviners or indeed seek otheracts of deception, just as I myself have seen: the snake’s head tied onsomeone’s hand, another one with the crocodile’s tooth tied to his arm,and another with fox claws tied to his legs— especially since it was anofficial who told him that it was wise to do so! Indeed, when I demandedwhether the fox claws would heal him, he answered, “It was a greatmonk who gave them to me, saying ‘Tie them on you (and) you will findrelief’.”Moreover, this is the manner that they anoint themselves with oil or thatthey pour over themselves water while receiving (ministrations) from en-chanters or drug-makers, with every deceptive kind of relief....

Indeed, it seems as if Christian “prophet” figureswere progressively assimilated to the local environment, to fit localEgyptian needs.41 But what distinguishes these monks in early CopticEgypt—distinguishes them from other indigenous ritual experts—istheir simultaneous reflection of the Christian cosmos and the exorcisticand thaumaturgical authority that that cosmos brought with it.

We are familiar with the po-lemical, even paranoid worldviews that have led Roman governors,early Christian bishops, early modern inquisitors, and the leaders ofAfrican witch-purges to regard certain forms of ritual expertise orpractice as evil and subversive and their practitioners as types of eviland subversion. But we often forget that such terms of castigationagainst “other” ritual specialists, real or imagined, arise in popularculture itself, among local ritual experts. One repeatedly finds indig-enous dichotomies between positive ritual expertise—invariably“ours”—and negative ritual expertise—that is, intrinsically subver-sive, out of bounds, “of the left hand.” Philostratus, for example,describes a goèteia ostensibly distinct from the thaumaturgy ofApollonius of Tyana, a base sphere of ritual meant for sports orbusiness competition or love, and promulgated by charlatans(VII.39). In Heliodorus’s novel Aethiopika, the idealized Egyptianpriest Kalasiris can aid the hero and heroine with all manner of“authentic” Egyptian potions, but he still juxtaposes his own craft toanother sphere of ritual that is... of low rank and, you might say, crawls upon the earth; it waits uponghosts and skulks around dead bodies; it is addicted to magic herbs, andspells are its stock-in-trade; no good ever comes of it; no benefit everaccrues to its practitioners; generally it brings about its own downfall, andits occasional successes are paltry and mean-spirited—the unreal made toappear real, hopes brought to nothing; it devises wickedness and pandersto corrupt pleasures.43What is particularly interesting about this picture of alien or subver-sive ritual is the role of and benefit to real ritual experts in conjuringsuch an enemy. Theodore of Sykeon is hardly unique in the history ofreligions in recasting a rival ritual expert as an enemy; and indeed, itis significant that he casts this rival as the very source of the problemshe (Theodore) must resolve by the good ritual. Certainly Christianmaterials show this demonizing of the competition in most vividterms. But one finds this kind of polarizing of ritual spheres, in which“our” healer resolves the maleficium brought by “that” sorcerer, acrosscultures and religious situations. The mid-twentieth-century Nuerprophet Ngundeng “waged a consistent campaign against magicians,insisting that they bury their magic in [his specially-constructed43Heliodorus, Aethiopica 3.16, tr. J.R.

He denounced magicians in his songs and ac-cused some pretended prophets of conjuring.” The early-nineteenth-century Seneca prophet Handsome Lake railed against witches as theprimary threat to community health and welfare, who would soondefer to his revelation and confess their sins. A Melanesian shaman ofthe 1950’s, taken over by a local goddess, warned her communitiesespecially about sorcery, inspiring several purges.44 In such cases aworld of evil ritual and ritual expertise became the foil—theantitype—to the charisma of the newly established ritual expert.European historians are increasingly noting the dynamic presenceof local “witch-diviners”—“cunning folk” in English tradition—inidentifying witchcraftscourges in their very communities.45 They mayinitiate a lynching by pointing out a specific “witch,” or they mayarticulate a more amorphous witch-scourge that could only be re-solved through their own spiritual warfare. Carlo Ginzberg and oth-ers have identified fraternities of local seers who insured fertility andprotected community fortune by battling witches while in dream-states.46 So also in late second-century Anatolia a regional oracle rec-ommended that a town hold a public festival to rid itself of apestilence brought by magoi.47 In these cases, local or regional divinersarticulate cosmic misfortune in terms of witchcraft; then they recom-44Ngundeng: Johnson, Nuer Prophets, 96 (see further, 97-99); Handsome Lake:Overholt, Prophecy in Cross-Cultural Perspective 105, 112, 117; Melanesian shaman:Matthew Tamoane, “Kamoai of Darapap and the Legend of Jari,” Prophets of Mela-nesia, ed. by Garry Trompf (Port Moresby: Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies,1977), 174-211, excerpted in Overholt, ibid., 285-95, esp. 292-93,45Keith Thomas, “The Relevance of Social Anthropology to the Historical Studyof English Witchcraft,” Witchcraft Confessions and Accusations, 60-61; Tekla Dömötör,“The Cunning Folk in English and Hungarian Witch Trials,” Folklore Studies in theTwentieth Century, ed. by Venetia J.

More often than not, witch-finderstend to be ritual experts themselves, the eclectic purveyors of amulets,remedies, and divination from the center or, more often, the periph-ery.48 In African witch-cleansings, for example, the expert is often anoutsider, but conversant in the idioms and expectations of local com-munities.49 On the other hand, some witch-finders’ entire “practices”may focus exclusively on the resolution of the witchcraft and sorceryplagues they identify: they become “professionals in supernaturalevil,” much like early Christian exorcistic prophets and contemporaryinvestigators and therapists of “Satanic Ritual Abuse.”50In every case one can see a relationship between the image ofhostile magic (or sorcery or witchcraft) and the charisma of the onewho identifies the problem, articulates its scope and nature, and pro-vides effective remedies and apotropaia against it.51 Why a ritual ex-pert, independent or official, might focus her clairvoyant powers onsome poor old lady as the antitype rather than a more inchoate witch-craft, and then why witchcraft might be a more compelling diagnosisthan demons or the untimely dead, is due to immediate social, his-torical, or even psychological circumstances.52In some historical cases the image of subversive ritual experts be-comes a matter of official tradition.

Designationas a ritual expert can depend on family lineage and heritage, ac-quired skills, physical appearance, intellectual idiosyncrasy, super-natural claims, and institutional affiliation. As much as Redfieldemphasized individuals’ connections with an outside world and theprestige thus acquired, so the student of “magic” must be concernedequally with the very individuality of villagers, the natural distributionof skills and prestige in supernatural mediation that arises simply byliving alongside one another in time and space.The “dynamics of ritual expertise” covered in this paper in eachcase affect the way that local communities would understand andcredit the rites, amulets, authority, and charisma of ritual experts.Among these dynamics are a figure’s (1) proximity or marginality tothe community; (2) abilities as combiner of new and old idioms andtechnologies; (3) institutional affiliation and literate training, throughwhich the Great Tradition could be mediated with local tradition andneeds; (4) projection, as prophet, of a compelling new ideology ac-53See Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt, 233-24, on evidence from Ipuwer, Pa-pyrus Harris, Heliodorus, and PGM XII.54Tzvi Abusch, “The Demonic Image of the Witch in Standard Babylonian Lit-erature: The Reworking of Popular Conceptions by Learned Exorcists,” Religion,Science, and Magic: In Concert and In Conflict, ed. by Jacob Neusner, Ernest S.

The latter phenomenon standsoutside the taxonomy of historical ritual expertise, representing ratherthe indigenous construction of an “anti-ritualist” competitor or en-emy.In its cross-cultural survey of ritual experts this study is, to be sure,preliminary. I have offered here a spatial—center/periphery—modelfor understanding indigenous conceptions of ritual expertise, its pow-ers and dangers. But the paper should also, hopefully, advance thebasic issue of taxonomy in the history of religions—that is, the inter-pretive value and function of models and types—beyond the simple,static classifications of Weber and Van der Leeuw. The taxonomy ofpatterns of ritual expertise presented here purposely allows a certainfluidity among “types”—e.g., between community ritual experts localand peripheral, and between such experts and the quasi-institutionalliterati. This fluidity allows productive comparative analysis of thosecases that lie at the interstices of these “types,” and it best serves theunderstanding of popular spell-composition and amulet-dispensing.But one might propose further sub-categories according to differentcriteria: for example, according to an expert’s form of relationshipwith some supernatural figure (possession? communication? ritual ori-entation?), or an expert’s restriction to certain ritual forms or services(healing? spell-removal? exorcism? divination?), or the indigenous la-bels or role-distinctions held by various societies (“wise-woman,”“conjure-doctor”; the separate roles babalawo and elegun amongYoruba of West Africa).5656Cf.

To remedy the situation, then, some urge us to use theemic approach whereby we adopt the terms of the culture understudy; some would have us substitute new words in place of the old;others opine that the field is better served by specific as opposed togeneric comparisons. Far from denying the legitimacy of these ap-proaches, it will be argued here that they are merely additional toolsat the disposal of those interested in ancient magic, for they neithereliminate the need to use magic as a category nor do they fundamen-tally undermine its utility. Instead, these approaches represent shiftsin emphasis with respect to the phenomena under study; they arelargely matters of taste and as such cannot displace the school ofthought that sees in magic a useful category. After all, even magic’sgreatest enemies are incapable of functioning without it.As Evans-Pritchard noted more than fifty years ago in his seminalwork, labels are essentially arbitrary.4 There is no ontological connec-tion between the word and the phenomena under consideration, forthe object of inquiry retains its nature regardless of what we call it.This point is perhaps best illustrated in Tambiah’s critique of KeithThomas’ landmark book, Religion & the Decline of Magic:5Thomas provides no analysis of the symbolism of magic and withcraft,and is equally insensitive to the performative features of ritual acts thatare familiar to students of the linguistic philosophy of J. Austin and hisfollowers. A narrow yardstick of “rationality” misses the rhetorical andillocutionary aspects of ritual performances.6It is fortuitous that Tambiah uses the word “yardstick,” for Thomas’choices and emphases are little more than metaphorical yardsticks inthe measurement of the phenomena he evaluates. As such,Tambiah’s unease with Thomas’ failure to investigate the matterfrom Tambiah’s own perspective is surely the equivalent of arguingthe merits of the metric over the English system of measurement. Thephysical objects of measurement in such an instance remain the same,while the tools chosen for measuring necessarily yield different data.On that basis, all of us who fail to emphasize the approach esteemedby Tambiah, must fail in not producing the data that interest him.Thus, the critique is arbitrary. Rather, perhaps, the critique is per-4E. E.

Smith frankly con-fesses the political nature of his own approach:Religious studies, with its bias towards the ‘unique’ and the ‘total’, ex-pressed methodologically through its deep involvement in morphology,phenomenology and, more recently, in a morality of regard for localinterpretations, has been a discipline profoundly and not unsurprisinglyof the ‘right’. The comparative endeavour herein described is relentlesslyan affair of the ‘left’.87Indeed, Tambiah’s bombastic comments on Frazer reach such a fevered pitchthat their true value rests not in what they say about the latter, but rather in whatthey reveal about the former. Oddly enough, Wittgenstein, whom Tambiah quoteswith adulous approval, is just as histrionic in his assessment of Frazer, yet his chau-vinistic bigotry, the mere ravings of a disgruntled veteran of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Army, in no way detracts or, for that matter, taints the views he ex-presses. Rather, Tambiah merely brushes them off, while reserving criticisms of thesame nature for Frazer (Tambiah, op. cit., 51-64). In this connection, a quotationfrom Wittgenstein’s diary is of interest. Having learned that the rumor of the Germanoccupation of Paris was false, on October 25, 1914, Wittgenstein wrote, “[i]t makesme feel today more than ever the terribly sad position of our race—the German race.Because it seems to me as good as certain that we cannot get the upper hand againstEngland. The English—the best race in the world—cannot lose. We, however, canlose and shall lose, if not this year then next year. The thought that our race is goingto be beaten depresses me terribly, because I am completely German.” (emphasis inoriginal) Quoted in Martin Gilbert, The First World War (New York, 1994) 104.8Jonathan Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine (Chicago, 1994) 52-3; cf. with his salutoryand incisive comments in Map is not Territory (Leiden, 1978) 297-8 and his warningsabout the folly of evolution at p. 188. It is, therefore, something of a disappointmentthat Smith’s own approach, while decidedly moralising, suffers from a lack of self-consciousness, especially with regard to its own evolutionary outlook. In one instance,having completed his assault on early views of Christianity as another permutation ofthe vegetation god scheme asserted by the barnstormers of 19th century anthropol-ogy to have existed in the religous practices of the ancient mediterranean, he con-cludes by saying: “...we must see the development of a richer and more widely spreadnotion of the ‘dying and rising’ of the central cult figure, alongside of the develop-ment of the implications of this for the cult member, in the second to fourth centuryChristianities as well as in the other contemporary religions of Late Antiquity, asanalogous processes, responding to parallel kinds of religious situations rather thancontinuing to construct genealogical relations between them, whether it be expressedin terms of the former ‘borrowing’ from the latter, or, more recently, in an insistenceon the reverse.” (emphasis in original; Drudgery, 112-3). The underlying implicationhere, that individuals in similar circumstances respond in similar ways and developalong parallel tracks, is surely not too far from the determinism of an earlier day.Indeed, it is particularly striking that this conclusion follows on a previous conclusionwhich uses vocabulary employed by biologists of a by-gone era to describe the ideathat “the stages of an organism’s development correspond to the species’ [evolution-ary] history”: “Both the formation of the Corpus [Paulinum] and the addition toMark [of the resurrection narrative] appear to be late products of the mid-secondcentury, thus recapitulating the process that has been observed in the case of otherLate Antique cults” (Drudgery, 110-1). From this perspective, it seems that scholarly"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"  ‒   While there is nothing inherently wrong with nakedly political ap-proaches to various cultural or sociological phenomena, it is perhapstroubling that they are neither fully admitted nor always acknowl-edged. Indeed, the humanities being what they are, a field of inquiryinto culture that is simultaneously dependent on culture or cultures,viz. the culture of the observer and the culture of the observed, willalways suffer from this situation. It is, therefore, ironic, albeit perhapsinevitable, that modern critiques of magic’s tendentious past, whichreally is inter alia a colonial past, on the one hand, foreground thecognitive superiority of abandoning magic,9 and, on the other hand,leave in the background the political cum moral foundation to thosearguments without ever exposing the criteria that have framed thispolitico-moral impulse.10 At any rate, this tension between the use ofmagic and its abandonment in many ways demonstrates the arbitrarynature of labeling. Acknowledging this foremost, we can now turn toa few of the arguments advanced against the term and consider theireffectiveness in militating against its usage.Writing during the intellectually tenebrous 19th century, JamesFrazer posited a distinction between magic and religion on the basisof constraint and supplication. To be specific, Frazer says“[w]herever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulterated formit assumes that in nature one event follows another necessarily andinvariably without the intervention of any spiritual or personalagency.”11 Thus, the constraint. As to religion, Frazer: “[b]y religion,apologetics are largely ones of competing teleologies. For a clear explanation ofrecapitulation and its problems see Mark Ridley, Evolution (Cambridge, 1996) 587-9,quotation taken from p. 587. Cf. Tambiah’s summary of Tylor (op. cit., p. 44), MarvinMeyer and Richard Smith, edd., Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power(San Francisco, 1994) 2-4, and Fritz Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (Cambridge, MA,1997) 18, the latter of which states with striking assurance regarding the use of theword magic, “[t]here are only two possible attitudes: either a modern definition of theterm is created and the ancient and Frazerian notions are resolutely cast aside, or....”(italics added). Viewing Frazer as representing simply a backward stage on the roadto modern scholarship is surely no better than the evolutionarist crime of whichFrazer has been convicted.9Jonathan Z. Smith, “Trading Places,” in Meyer and Mirecki, Ancient Magic andRitual Power, 13-27.10Note how Smith uses the word “scholarship,” the positive and approving con-notation of which we cannot doubt, though its meaning and criteria remain mysteri-ously indistinct (Drudgery, 143). In broader terms, moral arguments for abandoningideas about progress in human culture offer no objective means for coping withpolitically distasteful concepts such as slavery or tyranny. After all, if there is no suchthing as progress, then having slaves or not having slaves are equivalent, and theextension of civil rights in America is hardly a progressive act.11James G. Frazer, The Golden Bough (New York, 1922/1958) 56."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" then, I understand a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior toman which are believed to direct and control the course of natureand of human life.”12 Thus, the supplication. On this basis, then,Frazer has articulated a reasonably clear basis for analyzing and clas-sifying the phenomena he intends to examine.13 It remains for himand those who adopt his criteria to apply them consistently.14 It hasbeen suggested that Frazer’s position is Christian, if not Protestant,15in outlook. Fritz Graf in his recent book on Greco-Roman magicends his summary of Frazer’s position by portentously concluding,“the ‘Christianocentric’ character of this definition of religion isclear.”16 Indeed, apparent support for this view comes from no lesstendentious a source than the Catholic Catechism which comments onmagic thus:All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occultpowers, so as to place them at one’s service and have a supernatural12Frazer, op. cit., 58.13pace Graf who refers to Frazer’s working definition as “blurry” (op. cit., 14).14Thus, Ritner’s sense that magic and religion cannot be viewed as incompatibledue to the pervasiveness of heka within Egyptian religion hints, not at any fundamen-tal problem with such a distinction, but rather at an unwillingness of the researcherto apply the categories. In the end, Ritner’s working definition of magic is essentiallyFrazer’s but in modern dress (Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice[Chicago, 1993] 28 and “Traditional Egyptian Religion,” in Meyer and MireckiAncient Magic and Ritual Power, 43-60). Needless to say, Frazer himself never saw magicand religion as two categories that never coexisted (Frazer, op. cit., 56). It is, therefore,strange that Tambiah should appear to have missed this point. Whether this is due tolack of understanding or charity is hard to tell, but it is remarkable that he appearsto contradict himself on the same page, when he summarizes Frazer’s position(Tambiah, op. cit., 53). For a clear and practical explanation for why one researchereschews Frazer’s approach, see Christopher A. Faraone, “The Agonistic Context ofEarly Greek Binding Spells,” in C. Faraone and Dirk Obbink, edd., Magika Hiera(New York, 1991) 3-32, esp. 20.15Keith Thomas, op. cit., 61: “the conventional distinction between a prayer and aspell seems to have been first hammered out, not by the nineteenth-century anthro-pologists, with whom it is usually associated, but by sixteenth-century Protestanttheologians.”16Graf, op. cit., 14. For classicists, of course, the Christian label is doubly damning,since Christianity is not merely evocative of an era in academe that many wouldprefer to forget, but Classics in particular still seeks to maintain the sharp dividebetween the enlightened paganism of antiquity and the zealous Christians who de-stroyed it as baldly stated by Gibbon in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (NewYork, n.d.) I: pp. 382-443 and esp. v. 3 pp. 863-80, where he lays out what in hisview are the four causes of Rome’s collapse. Of Christianity, having exonerated thebarbarians, he says, “the reproach may be transferred to the Catholics of Rome. Thestatues, altars, and houses of the demons were an abomination in their eyes; and inthe absolute command of the city, they might labour with zeal and perseverance toerase the idolatry of their ancestors.” p. 866."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"  ‒   power over others—even if this were for the sake of restoring theirhealth—are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion.17 (emphasis in origi-nal)Graf’s curious comment, however, which is as meaningful as “leftist”would be if applied to his own approach, calls to mind the old adage,“there’s nothing new under the sun.” Clement of Alexandria, writingbefore Protestant apologetics could burst into flame, for example,posited coercion as a distinguishing feature of magic in his Exhortationto the Greeks;18 more significantly, the fact that several hundred yearsearlier, before either Clement or any Christian for that matter, virtu-ally the same view was offered by the author of the hippocratic text,On the Sacred Disease,19 surely weakens Graf’s position just a little. Fromanother quarter, Ann Jeffers also rejects Frazer’s coercion criterion,but her objection is unconsciously, yet personally teleological. Shestates:...Frazer was quite mistaken when he explained magic as a technique ofcoercion. Not one field anthropologist has ever met a “primitive” whobelieved he could alter the world.20Obviously, this objection merely sets the stage for her argument infavor of the emic, which we shall consider shortly. More importantly,Frazer’s is decidedly the approach of an outsider; it, therefore, is of noconsequence whatsoever whether or not the texts under considerationor the individuals being interrogated attest to a belief in the ability toalter the world.21 Nevertheless, it just so happens that the texts dobear witness to such a belief. Otherwise, it is hard to make sense of17Catechism of the Catholic Church (New York, 1995) 570, §2117.18G. W. Butterworth, Clement of Alexandria (LCL 92; Cambridge, MA 1982) 135:“[magicians] have enrolled [daemons] as their own servants, having made themslaves perforce by means of their incantations.”19G. P. Goold, Hippocrates (LCL 148; Cambridge,MA, 1998) II:145-6.20Ann Jeffers, Magic & Divination in Ancient Palestine & Syria (Leiden, 1996) 7.21Of course, as Jeffers does not define “primitive,” it is hard to know whetheranything considered here would ever be primitive enough. If, however, the wordprimitive is a substitute for preliterate, then we have no way of challenging herassertion. Needless to say, not even her own endeavor, an examination of magic inancient Palestine through the investigation of vocabulary, could have any bearing onit. On that basis, her objection would have no relevance for her or for us. On adifferent level, surely a distinction is to be made between the certainty that one’sefforts to manipulate nature magically will succeed, and the optimistic hope that theywill. How this would affect Jeffers’ analysis is again unclear as her terms are notadequately defined."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" spells that purport to make the practioner invisible,22 destroy cities,23or overpower the heart of a desired lover.24 After all, if they weredesigned to fail, why bother using them at all?25 On balance, then,Jeffers’ critique is nugatory; as to the label, “christianocentric,” it ishard to see this as anything more than the result of arbitrary selec-tion.That magic works ex opere operato is both implicit in Frazer’s defini-tion and another supposedly Christian derivation. Thomas in his fas-cinating book writes, “Words and prayers ... had no power inthemselves, unless God chose to heed them; whereas the working ofcharms followed automatically upon their pronunciation.”26 Far from22See PGM I.247-62 in which the officiant is to say to the demon s/he conjures,“whatever I, NN, order you to do, /be obedient to me.” Hans Dieter Betz, The GreekMagical Papyri in Translation (Chicago, 1992) 9; Grimoirium Verum (Seattle, 1997) 18-20;Gretchen Rudy, trans., The Grand Grimoire (Seattle, 1996) 39-40; Richard Kieckhefer,Forbidden Rites (University Park, 1998) 59-61, 224-6.23David Pingree, ed., Picatrix 18, “ymago ad destruendum civitatem” which tanta-lizingly says “and when you have thus made the representation (ymaginem), bury itin the middle of the city and you will see amazing things.” In this connection, it isperhaps worthy of note that the notion of sympatheia in magical practice was acknowl-edged as well: “They say that to the extent that those who work the representation(imaginem) manipulate the same representation, to that extent the representationcauses like experiences in those objects to which it has been ascribed just as the mindof the officiant commands.” Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Phil. 2.49 cited in LouisFahz, “De poetarum Romanorum doctrina magica” in Religionsgeschichtliche Versucheund Vorarbeiten 2.3 (1904) 127-70, esp. 126 n. 1.24Examples of this genre are legion. Just a few are cited here to make the point:J. F. Bourghouts, Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts (Leiden, 1978) no. 1, according towhich the officiant shall threaten as follows: “if [the gods] fail to make her come afterme I will set <fire to> Busiris and burn up <Osiris>!”; Benjamin R.

The wordsof Gwendolyn Leick regarding love magic in Mesopotamian culture are blunt: “[Thepurpose of love magic] is ... to gain power over another person, to force him, or her,to do what one desired.” Gwendolyn Leick, Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature(London, 1994) 194. Leick cites more completely at pp. 198-9 the spell printed byFoster at p. 143. The two translations ought to be considered side by side as theyhave slight differences. Though Leick does not make the connection, the spell as shedescribes it is remarkably similar in sentiment, if not literarily evocative, ofTheocritus, Idyl 2.25While the answer can never be known, it is admirable that a few recent scholarshave asked whether or not certain magical practices, in this case, curse tablets,worked. On this, see Gager, op. cit., pp. 22-3 and R. O. Tomlin, The Temple of SulisMinerva at Bath (Oxford, 1988) 2: 110-1, the latter of which writes in reference to thematerial found at Bath, “we are never told by a successful petitioner that they did[work], but the practice of inscribing [the objects] continued for two centuries, fromthe second to the fourth, which implies that they did work.”26Thomas, ibid."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"  ‒   being the result of Protestant analysis, however, the view that wordshad power goes back very far.27 Naturally, though Christians wouldhave been loath to acknowledge it, the creative logos isparadigmatically the efficacious word. Pliny the Elder as well, paganthat he was, also pondered this question. Writing in Book 30 of hisNatural History, he says, “it is a matter of the greatest interest and everone of uncertainty as to whether words and the recitation of verseshave any power.”28 He later goes on to demonstrate the ancient (fromhis perspective) Roman belief in the power of words by citing twofragments of the Twelve Tables, Rome’s earliest collection of laws,conventionally dated to c. 450 BC.29 He cites various Roman customswhich reveal not merely a belief in the efficacy of words, but evensuggest the power to coerce the divine. Finally, he mentions literaryauthorities who attest to the power of the word: Homer,Theophrastus, Cato, Varro.30 It is opportune that Homer is men-tioned in this connection, as he tells in the Odyssey of the time thatyoung Odysseus was hunting a wild-boar with his uncles. In the en-counter, Odysseus killed the boar, but was gored in the thigh. Hisuncles jumped to heal his wound: “and with a spell (epaoide) theystopped the black blood.”31 Thus just two examples from “western”antiquity.32 In Egypt, there is the famous story of Djedi, the powerfuland legendary magician, who was fabled to be a contemporary ofKhufu. According to the story, Hardjedef tells his father, Khufu,about Djedi, a powerful magician who can join the head of a severed27E.g., J. H. M. Strubbe, “Cursed be he that moves my bones,” Magika Hiera 33-59, esp. 41-5.28Pliny, Nat. Hist., 28.2.10.29Pliny, op. cit., 28.4.17.30Pliny, op. cit., 28.4.18-21.31Homer, Odyssey 19. 456-7; Pliny refers to the spell as a carmen or song (op. cit.,28.4.21).32It is certainly problematic to continue to speak of the western tradition inGreece as if Greek culture represented an intellectual island. Her debt to the NearEast is obvious, and represents cultural continuity rather than insularity. WalterBurkert’s work is a useful antidote to continued dialogue in such terms (W. Burkert,The Orientalizing Revolution, Cambridge, MA, 1992). In the field of ancient magic,Christopher Faraone’s “The Mystodokos and the Dark-Eyed Maidens: MulticulturalInfluences on a Late-Hellenistic Incantation” is an exciting exploration of theintercultural implications (in Meyer and Mirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, 297-333); likewise, Ritner’s provocative suggestion that Greco-Roman defixiones andEgyptian letters to the dead are related, merits serious consideration (Mechanics, pp.179-80). In the world of Greek literature, Nicander’s Theriaka and Alexipharmaka cryout for analysis in light the Egyptian context, as do the Demotic Setne and Khamwasstories in light of the Greek context, see n. 32, infra."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" animal to its body and resuscitate the victim. Khufu is thrilled at theprospect of seeing such a feat for himself, and immediately sends forDjedi. Having arrived, Djedi agrees to perform, and, as promised, herejoins various decapitated animals to their severed members andcauses them to amble about the palace. These amazing displays heaccomplishes simply by uttering “his say of magic.”33 From the Bible,the magical competition between Moses, Aaron, and the Egyptianking’s magicians is suggestive. The Hebrew text vaguely reports that“Pharaoh too summoned his wise men and sorcerers, and they them-selves, the hartumim of Egypt, by means of their secrets performedaccordingly,”34 the critical word, hartumim, being on the basis of theHebrew evidence alone of uncertain etymology and doubtful mean-ing. Traditionally, the word is related to heret, meaning a chisel, andon that basis, it has been assumed that this class of magicians werescribes of some sort. Regardless of the historical linguistic facts, thequestion is what the Jews themselves thought.35 To determine that, itis possible to find assistance in the Septuagint and Vulgate. Both of thesetexts emphasize with relative consistency the relationship betweenhartumim and song, for the Septuagint renders the word as epaoidoi or“spell casters” and the Vulgate likewise refers to the use of spells bymeans of the word, incantationes. The fact that hartumim is later trans-lated in the latter by malefici, the generic Latin for warlock,36 and bythe former by pharmakoi, the generic Greek for the same, speaks, notnecessarily to a vague understanding of the translators,37 but to thepolyvalence of hartumim itself as a word which when taken in conjunc-tion with two other words for magician, hakhamim and mekhashfim, isconfined to its more precise meaning, but, when allowed to stand onits own, is given a more generic sense. At any rate, in light of this33Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature (Berkeley, 1975) I:215-22. Follow-ing Kurt Sethe, Ägyptische Lesestücke (Darmstadt, 1924/1959) 31: ‘h'-n dd-n ddi dd.t.f mhk3.(w), lit. “then Djedi said what he says as magic”. The phrase occurs several timesin P. Westcar; see explication in Kurt Sethe, Erläuterungen zu den Ägyptischen Lesestücke(Leipzig, 1927) 36. This is not to say that the totality of hk3 was speech, but to pointout that as portrayed in P. Westcar speech is the operative feature. As far as literarytexts go, P. Westcar is very circumspect about magical practice, especially comparedwith the Demotic story of Setne and Khamwas, which makes me wonder as to theinterplay between Greek and Egyptian literary tradition, for the Greeks were usuallyuninhibited in their revelations about magical practice. Ritner, op. cit., 38.34Exodus 7:11.35Jeffers offers an interesting, but inconclusive discussion (op. cit., 44-9).36As a concension to purists, it is to be observed that a true calque on warlockwould be sponsifrax vel sim.37pace Jeffers, op. cit., 48."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"  ‒   evidence, there is a hint in Exodus that magic was marked by the useof the effective word. Moreover, on balance, the idea that ex opereoperato is a Christian concept must be drawn into question, and onemight fairly ask whether or not it actually does represent the facts ofmagic.The third tack taken against magic is that of linguistic imprecision,which brings us back to the issue of labels per se. To quote a fewexamples of this critique,[t]he largest single family of theoretical, substantive definitions of“magic” [posit that] “magic” is “religion” or “science,” this or that—or,less commonly, but for an excess of this or that.... This dominant under-standing is an odd sort of definition. Not only does it break the conven-tional definitory rules..., but also because it is typically inconsistent in itsapplication of differentia.... But if one cannot specify the distinctions withprecision...the difference makes no difference at all.38 (emphasis added)Depending upon an individual’s predilection, the same text or act may beclassified as “magical,” “religious,” or (most evasively) “magico-religious.”The problem, especially for secular scholars, has been to determine justwhat factors should constitute ... the necessary and sufficient quotientwhich separates magic from religion, medicine, and science.39There seems to be no agreement among anthropologists on the use of theterms “magic” and “religion”, so that these words cannot be relied uponas technical terms.40Conceding arguendo that magic, defined as being marked by coercion,is ambiguous, there are two ways in which these critiques fail. First,they are critiques that, when taken to their logical conclusion, pre-clude the use of language, which is an unacceptable position for thoseof us who depend upon language to convey information; second, theyexpress a dissatisfaction which rightly ought to be directed at thosewho inconsistently employ the term rather than at the term which isthus misused. The humanities are first and foremost not a science;4138Smith, “Trading Places” in Meyer and Smith, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, 14-5.39Ritner, “Traditional Egyptian Magic,” in Meyer and Mirecki, Ancient Magic andRitual Power, 46.40Jeffers, op. cit., 7 n. 33.41Smith’s scientific agenda, made manifest through his use of biological vocabu-lary, implies a desire to put our discipline onto a more “objective” basis. There isnothing inherently problematic with this; it does, however, reflect a tacit faith in thesuperiority of the sciences which seems hard to maintain in light of the linguisticproblems he enjoys exploring. Cf. Drudgery Divine, passim, but especially the commentsat 36-7 and 47 n. 15; also, “Trading Places,” passim."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" although it may be desirable to classify phenomena symbolically suchthat we all cease to speak in terms of magic, but rather in terms ofphenomena d and z, the fact remains, that, when we cannot evenagree on the terms of our discussion, we are far from being able toreach any consensus on the symbols that might represent them. Atany rate, language is the primary tool of our endeavors, and it iscongenitally vague. Thus, it is hard to decide at what point we maystop removing words from our vocabulary on this basis. Are we, forexample, to exclude “epic”? The problem is that, although certainpoems are conventionally identified as epics, such as Vergil’s Aeneid orHomer’s Iliad, the question, what criteria allow them to be so classi-fied, is not easy to answer. Plot will not do, for while by this measurewe could be comfortable in classifying the Aeneid, Iliad, and Gilgameshstories as epics, it does not account for didactic poetry such asLucretius’ On the Nature of Things. Meter also cannot be satisfactory asa criterion, for on that basis, the Aeneid, Iliad, and On the Nature ofThings can be designated as epics, but Gilgamesh cannot.42 Indeed, thevery notion of what is a poem43 is also becoming more imprecise.Today, a poem may be indistinguishable from a piece of prose saveby using the criterion of page layout. Epic and poetry are merely twoexamples from many that could be produced to demonstrate that thestock and trade of the humanities consist of imprecise, ambiguous,and indefinable concepts and terms. The exploration of these prob-lems also reveals a certain hypocrisy. Apparently, on the one hand,we are to abandon magic for its ambiguities, but other words areallowed to stand. Yet the principle that ambiguous terms or inconsist-ently applied categories must be avoided demands that we consistentlyapply it everywhere. Otherwise, it is simply an arbitrary process.To cope with the problems of magic, a variety of approaches havebeen implemented. One which has proven especially attractive is thatof the emic, whereby the observer seeks to become one of the observedby culturally immersing him or herself. This technique, it is sug-gested, helps strip the scholar of his own cultural biases and allows fora more profound and sympathetic understanding of the target cul-ture. Thus writes Jeffers: “it would seem that a society must be ap-proached as ‘objectively’ as possible and that means swapping ourown world-view for that of the people whose system we study, by42Those who advocate an emic approach should shudder at the thought of describ-ing Gilgamesh or the Enuma Elish as epics, given the word’s strictly Greco-Romanapplication.43“Poem” is another word which should be shunned by partisans of the emic."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"  ‒   becoming an insider, a thoroughly ‘subjective’ observer.”44 The emicapproach is extremely valuable in that it does help one to understandwhat the individuals under consideration thought of themselves andthe acts they were performing. It does not, however, displace the eticnor is it so opposed that the etic and the emic cannot exist simultane-ously. Indeed, they necessarily must, given the fact that the researchercan never fully shed his or her native culture.45 Happily, an illustra-tion of the emic-etic question is brilliantly illustrated by a passage fromDon Quixote.46 Riding along in the company of the faithful SanchoPanza, the man from La Mancha spots some 30 or 40 windmills inthe distance. Pointing to “the impudent giants” in the distance, heannounces to Sancho his intention “to do battle and deprive them oftheir lives.” “What giants?” is Sancho’s response. This is precisely thequestion of the emic and the etic. Cervantes presents us here with acertain reality which is the 30 or 40 windmills. For Don Quixote thewindmills do not represent giants; they actually are giants. ForSancho Panza, they are windmills. The emic approach would invite usto join with Don Quixote in seeing the windmills as giants. The eticwould have us side with Sancho. This is not to place an ethical or44Jeffers, op. cit., 14 and stated differently but with equal force at pp. 3, 7, 16, 22;cf. Graf, op. cit., 18 where he argues that his emic approach will both use the wordmagic and avoid the ethnological notions of the term even though magic itself isethnic. Of course, the use of terms like magic to describe western magic always leaveone in doubt as to whether an emic or etic approach is being undertaken. An interest-ing example of the former within the European context is proposed by RichardKieckhefer, Magic in the Middle Ages (Cambridge, MA 1997) 8-17, wherein he detailshis plan to use “native” concepts of natural and demonic magic.45Consider, for example, the problem of veneficium in Latin. The wordetymologically refers to the manufacture of certain substances which, when adminis-tered to an individual, affect his or her nature. Veneficium can be the making of amedicament, a poison, or a potion. Eventually, the word refers to what we would callmagic, and it is often translated that way. A problem arises when one resolves towrite about these ritual practices that are regularly considered magic. If taking anemic approach, how can one decide whether or not Cicero’s Pro Caelio and the Apologyof Apuleius are on the same footing? They both touch upon veneficium, yet the ProCaelio is a case of poisoning and Apuleius is defending himself on a charge of witch-craft. It is not sufficient to say that the ambiguity of the word means that we shouldfollow the Romans in viewing both as species of the same thing, veneficium. After all,in French, the word histoire sometimes means history and sometimes means story, yetit does not follow that this dual-meaning of the word leads to an intellectual inabilityon the part of the French to distinguish the two. Just so, veneficium need not mean thatthe Romans saw the speeches of Cicero and Apuleius as concerned with the sameactivity. Practically speaking, in the case of ancient languages only an etic sense thatoperates above the entire emic process allows the researcher to make choices in thisregard, and those choices are necessarily made.46Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quijote de la Mancha (Barcelona, 1985) I:81-2."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" moral value on the emic approach. Rather, it is to say that the emicapproach produces data which are fundamentally different from thedata which result from an etic one. In this case, the data relate to DonQuixote’s particular worldview. On this basis, then, it is impossible tofollow Jeffers in her assessment that the emic is somehow intellectuallysuperior.47 Furthermore, and this especially pertains to those whostudy the ancient world, there is the problem of having an accurateunderstanding of the ancient culture. As it is, our command of thelanguages is tenuous at times48 and when less so, it is hard to see howwe ever escape the problem of translation, whether the process isconscious or not. Ultimately, the emic approach as it relates to theancients runs the risk of being no more than an illusion. Though nothopeless, it can be rather limited.Another way of coping with magic and its problems is to recast thecategory with different words. In its gentler form, this becomes“magico-religion;”49 in its stronger manifestation, it becomes “ritualpower” or “unsanctioned religious activity” to cite two examples.50 Insupport of “ritual power,” Meyer and Smith come dangerously closeto adopting the coercion criterion that marked Frazer’s magic:[a]lthough many, perhaps most, rituals can be discussed in terms of em-powerment or power relations, the texts in this volume are overt in theirmanipulation of power and force. Deities are summoned “by the power of” atalisman, a name, or the power of another divinity.... “Texts of ritualpower,” then, appears to be a fitting description. (emphasis added)5147In point of fact, as she has framed it, the emic has troubling implications. Tounderstand Nazism, one should, it would seem, become a Nazi, yet very small wouldbe the number of scholars willing to engage in this application of the emic. Stated lessemphatically, the emic would have us refrain from calling the work of al-Tabari, “theArab Livy,” anything but ta’arikh since the Arabs do not have history. Likewise, weshould refrain from ever speaking of medicine among the Egyptians. After all, historyand medicine both have a long western tradition behind them, and it is hard to seehow, if magic is assumed to inflict its problems on foreign cultures to which it isapplied, the use of words like medicine and history do not. Ultimately, the emic, takento its limit, is an isolationist position that denies cross-cultural comparison.48Woe to those who study Sumerian! See, for example, Marie-Louise Thomsen,The Sumerian Language (Copenhagen, 1991) 144-5 or 182-3.; likewise cf. two transla-tions of the Hymn to Nanshe, that of Wolfgang Heimpel in William W. Hallo, ed., TheContext of Scripture (Leiden, 1997) I:526-31 and that of Thorkild Jacobsen, The Harpsthat Once... (New Haven, 1987) 126-42.49This locution is a fork in the road leading either to pure euphemism or to theevaporation of magic altogether, which shall be considered shortly.50Meyer and Smith, op. cit.; Phillips, op. cit., passim. Gager’s decision to use thephrase “binding spells” is on the cusp of being but the merest euphemism. Thephrase goes unexplained in his discussion of definition, so it is difficult to see preciselythe reasoning behind it (op. cit., 24-5).51Meyer and Smith, op.cit., 5."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"  ‒   In light of this description, it seems hard not to view this as magic bya different name. When Phillips suggests that we moderns turn ourattention not towards magic as we see it, but towards unsanctionedreligious activity which, incidently, includes magic under both ancientand modern rubrics, it becomes difficult to see how this is not merelya euphemism, albeit cast rather broadly.52 Of course, the substitutionof a broader, more nebulous category for magic brings with it theproblem of being so extended as to be meaningless. Thus, whenSmith determines that the one characteristic of magic is its illegality,53it is not merely an incorrect formulation because it fails in its claim touniversality,54 but it begs the question as to what qualifies as magicwithin the culture,—an emic question—and implies a circularity thatsays the test of magic is whether or not it is illegal, thereby encourag-ing us to suspect the presence of magic in that which is deemedillegal. Ultimately, if magic as a category fails, so must its euphemisticsubstitutes because as euphemisms they repackage the same problemsthat inhere to the word they replace.The last strategy for dealing with magic is to abandon it and itssubstitutes altogether. Rather than fall victim to the problems thatcome with either trying to define the word precisely, which in anyevent is impossible, or create new phraseology that will function withgreater reliability, we are urged to avoid any attempt to define thegenus and instead focus on the species.55 Smith writes:52Phillips, op. cit., 269.53Smith, Map is Not Territory, 192.54Not only was magic not illegal in Egypt, its proscription in Athenian law isextremely doubtful, and its prohibition is very late in Roman law. In Egypt, the so-called Harem Conspiracy, which was essentially a instance of thwarted assassination, isa rare example of a legal case in which magic happened to be a factor. No law fromAthens survives in which magic is outlawed, efforts to subsume it under asebeia (impi-ety) notwithstanding (the Teian Curses are, first, an oath, and, only secondly, a rareexample of official pronouncements regarding magical practices from some Greeknomothetic tradition); at Rome, the Twleve Tables and the Lex Cornelia de sicariis etveneficis touched only upon magical practice insofar as that practice infringed uponrights of persons or property. In other words, throughout the Republic and the earlyyears of the Empire, Roman law was virtually silent about magic per se.55Alternatively, we can simply collapse religion and magic together as Smith doeswhen he defines religion thus, “[r]eligion is the quest, within the bounds of thehuman, historical condition, for the power to manipulate and negotiate ones (sic)‘situation’ so as to have ‘space’ in which to meaningfully dwell.” The phrasing runsominously close to being an amalgam of coercion and supplication (Map is Not Terri-tory, 291). This, of course, is the position demanded by the U. S. Constitution‘sSecond Amendment.

For any culture I am familiarwith, we can trade places between the corpus of materials conventionallylabeled “magical” and corpora designated by other generic terms (e.g.healing, divining, execrative) with no cognitive loss.56To follow Smith’s lead, the system proposed here is essentially taxo-nomic, which, as explored earlier, is problematic on its own. Leavingthat issue aside, one wonders why terms like “divining” and“execrative” which, like magic, have their own historical and linguis-tic reality in Western tradition, are deemed superior. More to thepoint, what is sought here is an examination of the specificsubcategories within what is traditionally referred to as magic. Inother words, in taxonomic terms, magic is potentially a genus, andwithin that genus are the species, healing, divining, execrative texts.At this stage, this process encourages us to deny any broader relationamong the species, which would be akin to studying Indo-Europeanbut conceding no broader relationship between French and Spanish,and, a fortiori, between the Slavic and Italic branches. While, as Smithargues, this is positive because it allows for comparisons betweenother healing, divining, and execrative texts from other cultures, itseems uncertain, if not doubtful, that this represents a movementaway from the problems that come with magic. In some sense, this isfunctionally equivalent to the euphemistic impulse in that it seeks todisplace the offending category with ones deemed inoffensive. Theresults too do not seem particularly promising as it is easy to see thatafter magic is out of the picture, the new categories, once regnant,will through the normal course of scholarly discussion necessarilyundergo magic’s fate. In the end, however, we shall have to askwhether or not the boundaries of these acceptable categories can besuccessfully maintained. After all, the notion of healing, which is tosay, the notion of medicine, too has its own difficulties. While the caseof the Gadarene swine, for example, is typically identified as an ex-ample exorcism, it surely can also be interpreted as healing.57 Con-versely, Varro’s remedy for foot pain, in which he addresses the56Smith, “Trading Places” in Meyer and Mirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power,16-7; this position is explicitly staked out by Gager as well, although see comment atn. 50, supra.57Matt 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-17; Luke 8:26-37."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"  ‒   disease, is typically interpreted as a case of healing,58 although onemight make a case for it as an instance of exorcism. It seems that theproblems that come with magic attend taxonomic approaches as well.But then, taxonomy is as language dependent as magic ever was.Magic is here to stay. The purpose here has not been to deny thelegitimacy of the critiques that have been leveled against it. On thecontrary, every specific case considered has been valuable in helpingscholars move away from the highly negative and evaluative use ofmagic that has held sway in our field. A. A. Barb’s “The Survival ofthe Magic Arts,” with its caustic treatment of the subject, and AdolfErman’s prejudicial remarks in Die Religion der Ägypter could neither begiven weight today nor can they be anything but evidence of how faralong the debate has come.59 The position taken here, then, is one ofoptimism. Far from being rendered useless, magic is a category thathas been the subject of serious negotiation for more or less the pastone hundred years, and as such, is gradually being worked into a toolof real utility for scholars. It is not the only tool, however. The fruitsof that debate have also placed at our disposal the emic approach andreconfigurations of materials within the category of magic. Not alltools demand use; rather, each student of magic in the ancient worldis free to make his or her choices. Each of us can now pick thosemethodologies and terms that suit our interests and provide us withthe means to analyze what we find interesting about the materials weconsider. On this basis, while there is still much collective work to do,a lot has been done, and we can all approach magic from a variety ofperspectives. Therefore, let there be magic.58Varro, Res Rusticae, 1.2.27 (Keil).

The former (“tocross, transgress”) was thought to be always accompanied by thelocative sentence particle -kan, while the latter (“to divide”) lacks the-kan.7 The “arra- that the deity is told to do to herself has the -kan andso should mean “to cross or transgress”. This clearly makes no sensein the passage in the “Goddess of the Night” ritual. With the -kan-less“arra-’s meaning equally problematical, the translators resorted to adhoc translations.8The verb “arra- in these texts has thus been translated “transfer”9and “remove, move away”10 by the main text’s editor, HeinzKronasser.

The presence of the -kan is not an insurmount-able problem. A look through the examples of the verb “arra- yieldsthe passage: “If you ever take the god’s food offering, ... and do notbring it to him, but you only give it halfway. [“Half” is literally“middle division” the latter noun being “arra-, a noun related to ourverb.] Let this business of dividing (“arruma“, verbal noun) be a capitaloffense for you. Do not divide (“arra-) it. Whoever divides (“arra-) itdies.”19 In the last two sentences the verb “arra- is accompanied by a-kan. One could translate “Do not transgress it. Whoever transgressesit dies,” with the “it” referring vaguely to the “matter”, but consider-ing that nouns derived from the verb “to divide” were found earlierin the passage, it seems better to follow the precedent of both previ-ous translations20 of this text and assume that despite the presence ofthe -kan, the verb “arra- means “divide”. Even clearer is the sentence:“Then they divide up (“arra-) wine from the temple of Maliya from(lit. of) three wine vessels,” and they carry it to five temples in differ-ent vessels.21 Here the sentence contains a -kan, but the meaningcannot be “cross, transgress”, and so must be “divide”. The exactnuance of -kan, which by this later period of the language had ab-sorbed the function of what were once five separate “locative” parti-cles, is still indistinctly understood by Hittitologists. It is entirelypossible, though not yet demonstrable that while the meaning of“arra- to cross had always required a -kan, the usage with the goddesswould, if we ever find this usage in an older phase of the language,show one of the four other sentence particles whose usage later wasabsorbed by -kan.The translation of -kan “arra- with object a deity as “to divide adeity” is supported by the fact that the Hittite introduction to theritual for the Deity of the Night specifically says that “from thattemple of the Deity of the Night he builds another temple of the deityof the Night, and then he settles the deity separately.”22 The word19KUB 13.4 i 50, 56-59 (instructions for temple personnel, pre-NH/NS).20E.

Hittite is one ofthe world’s few nonsexist languages, so we would not actually knowthis was a goddess for sure if it were not for the fact that she wears akure““ar (“shawl”), a typical piece of Hittite feminine headgear,24 andthat she is addressed with the feminine form of an Akkadogram tarâmì“you (f.sg.) love”.25 Since 1968, most other scholars have acceptedCarruba’s interpretation and the argument has shifted to whether this“Goddess of the Night” is an entirely separate deity or a form of adeity better known by some other name and if so, which one.26Lebrun27 suggests equating DINGIR GE6 with I”TAR/”au“ga a23Kronasser, Schw.

Otten, Ein hethitisches Festritual (KBo XIX 128), StBoT 13 (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz, 1971) 45f. shows that DINGIR GE6 is sometimes, at least, to be readI“panza “Night”, based on parallel lists of gods, where it follows the Moongod andthe Star. A. Archi, “Il culto del focolare presso gli ittiti,” Studi micenei ed egeo-anatolici 16(1975) 79f. notes a deity I“panza“epa “Night-spirit” who occurs in much the samecompany in some texts as I“panza does in others so that the two seem to be variantsof one another. In the Vow of Pudu¢epa (text assembled by H. Otten and Vl.

This led E. Laroche, Recueil d’onomostiquehittite (Paris, 1951) 78, Les noms des hittites (Paris, 1966) 40 s.v. Armawiya, followed byCarruba, RlA 3 (1968) 355 to equate DINGIR GE6 with the Moongod. A. Goetze,Journal of Cuneiform Studies 20 (1966) 51, casts doubt on the equation. In any case,Otten’s list, mentioned above, has DINGIR GE6 listed separately from theMoongod, so even if “god of the night” could be used as an epithet of the Moongodand even as a way of writing Moongod, at other times “god(dess) of the night” was aseparate deity. Since our ritual concerns a goddess, in this case, at least, there is noquestion of DINGIR GE6 being the Moongod, who was a male for the Hittites. A. Ünal, “The Nature and Iconographical Traits of ‘Goddess of Darkness’”,Aspects of Art and Iconography: Anatolia and its Neighbors. Studies in Honor of Nimet Özgüç(Ankara: Türk Tarih Kurumu Basımevi, 1993) 639-644, argues that “the goddess ofdarkness” (sic) is to be equated with the demoness Lama“tu. However the fragmen-tary text employed by Ünal, KUB 55.24, probably records a dream describing aLama“tu-like demoness in the temple of DINGIR GE6. Had the dreamer simply seenDINGIR GE6 there would have been no reason to describe the form of the creatureseen, but it could have simply been said that DINGIR GE6 was seen. And, therewould be no reason to throw out all the evidence associating DINGIR GE6 withnight time things, dreaming and being a respectable deity, that had been assembledby earlier scholars.27Samuha, foyer religieux de l’empire hittite, Publications de l’institut orientaliste deLouvain 11 (Louvain-la-Neuve, 1976) 28-31."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"  ‒    goddess also resident in ”amu¢a.

Besides the statue itself, the goddess has a gold sun disk calledPirinkir,32 a gold navel and a pair of gold purka (apparently a bodypart) inlaid with cast glass. These tiny objects have their own carryingcase of stone inlaid with gold and semiprecious stones. Several of thegoddesses’ broaches are made of iron inlaid with silver (no doubt inniello technique), a reminder that in the second millenium, iron wasstill a precious metal.

They go to where the waters of purifica-tion are and collect purification water.35A separate ritual for the Pirinkir, from which we may probablyreconstruct the “waters of purification” ritual, has as follows. “Thekatra-woman takes one H«ALTIKKUTU-vessel, two thin breads, onepitcher of wine and a bit of fine oil and she goes to draw the watersof purification. When she arrives at the well, she breaks up thinbreads and throws them down into the well. She libates wine down inand drips fine oil down in. Then she draws water and brings it up tothe portico and places it on wicker potstands. To the H«ALTIKKUTU-vessels she ties a linen gazarnul, one strand of blue, one strand of greenand one strand of [...] yarn and one shekel of silver.”36 Our ritual waspresumably similar, except that the yarn was red, blue and natural.The object of the offerings to the well is to pay it for the water usedin the ritual. Part of what is tied to the water vessels (perhaps, to judgefrom the “wool” determinitive which usually precedes it, just thebraided strand of wool) forms a housing for the deity, known inHittite as an uli¢i.37The purification water is taken from the new temple to the oldtemple. The water is to spend the night on the roof of the old temple,sleeping beneath the stars. They take red wool and stretch it out inseven directions, thus forming seven paths for the deity. Each path isextended using the fine oil. The deity is asked to return from themountain, from the river, from the plain, from the heavens and fromthe ground.38 Having thus pulled the deity into the uli¢i from wher-ever she happens to be hanging out, they bind this woolen uli¢i ontothe deity’s statue. The rest of the day is spent collecting the necessarymaterials for the next day’s ritual.39The following morning at dawn with the stars still standing in thesky (that is the morning of the third day) the water is brought down34The Sumerogram Ì.DÙG.GA literally means “fine oil”.

The new tem-ple’s founder goes into the presence of the goddess and bows beforeher. Since it is now daytime, the deity of the night is no longer in theheavens but in the underworld, or perhaps simply elsewhere. So, thenthe deity’s priest and the founder each pull up the deity seven timesfrom the netherworld using a ritual pit,40 called an àbi.41 The pit ispaid for its services by dropping in a shekel of silver. Also involved inthe ritual is more red, blue and undyed wool, more fine oil, a whiteshawl, a few gemstones, five more thin-breads, some thick bread, asmall cheese, and another jug of wine.42 The text does not indicatethis, but one presumes that the further stands of wool into which bitsof the goddess keep getting pulled are attached to the original tassel ofstrands (the uli¢i) attached to the statue.There follows another ritual involving red, blue and natural yarnplus oil, and the two types of bread in the deity’s storehouse. On theevening of the same day, when it is dark enough for stars to be visible,the new temple’s founder enters the old temple, but this time he doesnot bow to the deity. A blood ritual is performed with the sacrifice ofa bird and either a kid or a lamb. Also involved in the ritual are someblue, red and natural yarn, a white shawl, some blankets and plentyof bread and wine, plus cheese, butter, and honey. The ritual pit getsa further gift of a shekel of silver. Then there is a ritual of praiseaccompanied by the sacrifice of a sheep along with more bread andwine. A shekel of silver and some gangati-herb serve to purify thefounder and the deity. Last but not least, they make a holocaust of alamb. Also involved in this ritual are yet more bread and wine, butterand honey as well as barley flour—the last presumably also intendedas a burnt offering. Only now does the founder bow to the deity, andthen he goes home.43Meanwhile, the servants of the deity, armed with the usual shekelof silver, red, blue and natural yarn, fine oil, bolt of gazarnul-fabric,thin bread and wine repeat the ritual of drawing the waters of purifi-cation and bring the waters to the old temple.

Their final task is to get ready the ritual paraphernalia for thefollowing day. Part of this is taken up onto the roof for the well-beingritual for the deity Pirinkir, who, as we saw above, is a sundisk of goldweighing a shekel. The rest goes inside the temple for the well-beingritual of the Deity of the Night. The founder gets ready a gift of asilver necklace or a silver star ornament for the deity.On the fourth day in the evening, when it is dark enough for starsto be visible, the new temple’s founder comes into the temple andlooks after Pirinkir by offering her ritual of well-being on the roof.Presumably this is intended to get Pirinkir’s goodwill for the subse-quent actions. The Deity of the Night who in her aspect as theevening star has been attracted down from the heavens into the waterin the basin is brought down from the roof to participate in theoffering for wellbeing in the temple, and receives a scattering ofdough balls and fruit. The two rituals of wellbeing appear to havebeen quite similar, involving in addition to the usual red, blue andnatural yarn, fine oil, bread and wine, various types of herb and beansoup and porridge, oil cakes, dried fruit, beer, and a sheep. The Deityof the Night also gets butter, honey, and a bolt of fabric and the ritualpit gets another shekel of silver. The seventh and last triple strand tobe produced is twice the normal size—made from two strands each ofwool instead of the usual one each; altogether, we have two triplestrands for the morning star, two for the storehouse, and three for theevening star. At the end of the day the new temple’s founder pays thedeity, the priest, and the katra-women, bows and goes out.44The fifth day consists simply of offerings that appear to be a break-fast of bread, herb soup and beer for the deity. The text states thatthe ritual of the old temple is finished.45 Since the most important riteof all has yet to occur in the old temple, presumably this means thatthe ritual preparations in the old temple for this most important ritehave been completed, i.e., both aspects of the Deity of the Night havebeen drawn into her temple and all has been made well.This most important rite is called the tu¢alzi-ritual, a word of un-known meaning. Fine oil is poured into a wood tallai-vessel. Thensomeone, perhaps the new temple’s founder,46 says in front of theDeity: “You are an important deity. Take care of yourself. Divideyour divinity. Come to the aforementioned new temples. Take an44§§17-18.45§19.46The text suddenly changes from plural, which functions as the indefinite inHittite, to singular verbs, but omits a subject.

He, the founder(?), takes the uli¢i,which has been hanging on the deity’s cult statue since the secondday, and places it into the wood tallai-vessel of oil, and the vessel issealed.48 The reason for delaying this ritual so long is presumably toensure that the new temple does not end up with, say, only themorning star, and leave the old temple with only the evening star.Now, with any luck, the new temple’s fair share of the divinity isensconced in the tallai-vessel and both temples will end up with allaspects of the divinity.Meanwhile the new clothing and implements have been carriedinto the new temple.49 The tallai-vessel containing the uli¢i is carriedto the new temple and put down apart from the cult statue. Since onecannot be sure that the deity indeed has been transported in the ulihiin the tallai-vessel, another ritual of drawing the deity is performedeither on the same day or, if the founder of the temple prefers, onanother day. This time the ritual takes place at a riverbank in a ruralarea. Tents have been pitched in anticipation of the ritual. At theriver, using fine oil, a red scarf, twenty thin breads, a jug of wine andsome leavened bread and cheese they draw seven paths and coax thedeity to return from the old cult centers of Mesopotamia—fromAkkad, from Babylon, from Susa, from Elam, from ›ursagka-lamma—or from wherever else she might be—from the mountain,the river, the sea, the valley, the meadow, the sky, the ground.50Possibly the riverbank has been chosen because the river could beseen as a road connecting Hatti to the Mesopotamian cities where thegoddess is worshipped,51 and the rural setting is appropriate to theother locations from which the goddess is being lured. A new uli¢i,consisting of a single strand of red wool in its own tallai-vessel iscreated in the usual way.52 They carry the new uli¢i into a tent andplace it on a wicker table, that is, on a portable altar. An appetizer ofoil, honey, fruit, bread, cake, cheese, barley flour and wine is set out.These are intended to accompany the sacrifices of a kid for the ritualof blood and a lamb for the ritual of praise. A lamb is burned as aholocaust (as presumably is the barley flour). The rest of the meal,consisting of soup and porridge, warmed bread, beer and wine is47iii 26-28.48§§21-22 iii 23-32.49§20.50§§22-24.51This is merely a supposition.

The deity is circled with amber(?),54 which perhapscreated a magic circle intended to keep her always in some way in thehouse of the new temple’s founder. Then they move to the store-house, presumably of the temple. You will remember that one of theplaces that a ritual had been performed in the old temple was in thestorehouse. They dedicate a lamb for the holocaust ritual, which isaccompanied by bread, oil cake, oil, ghee, honey and fruit in additionto the usual barley flour. This time, there is no ritual of blood orritual of praise. Then they carry the new uli¢i to the new temple andattach it to the new cult statue.55 For the last time, the usual shekel ofsilver, red, blue and natural yarn, fine oil, bolt of fabric, bread andwine are taken for the drawing of waters of purification. The water isto spend the night on the roof of the new temple, sleeping beneaththe stars.56The next morning (presumably at dawn with the stars still standingin the sky) they open the tallai-container with the old uli¢i inside thatthey have brought from the old temple. They mix the old oil insidethe tallai-container with the water which they intend to use to washthe wall of the temple.57 Although the text does not say so, this washwater is presumably the purification water that has spent the previousnight on the roof.58 So if the deity in her aspect of morning star hasbeen drawn down from the heavens into the water, she is now mixedwith whatever essence they had brought from the old temple andwhich had seeped from the uli¢i into the surrounding oil. When thewalls are washed with this mixture, they become ritually pure and,59remembering that the deity had been drawn from the walls of the oldtemple, presumably now the deity is being absorbed into the walls ofthe new temple.

Then theyslaughter a sheep down into it. The divine image, the wall of thetemple and all the divine implements are made ritually pure with theblood. The fat, however, is burned—no one is to eat it.61 So if thedeity in her aspect of evening star has been drawn up from theNetherworld into the blood, she has now been introduced to her newtemple. This action completes the installation of the new version ofthe deity in the temple.“The ritual for settling the Goddess of the Night separately” con-tinues, but its continuation is unfortunately lost. What is missing is atthe very least a further set of rituals of well-being, to judge frominstructions to collect bread, oil cake, various types of herb and beansoup and porridge, beer, wine, and fruit.62In summary, it can be seen that with the key verb “arra- properlyunderstood, the way to have two separate cult centers for the samedeity was to have that deity divide his or her divinity and then to havethat allomorph of the original physically moved and/or coaxedthough a repeating pattern of variations of ritual actions into the newconstruction.

Westermarck’s classic studyof modern Moroccan ritual and belief1 provides valuable insightsinto the way in which the ancient participants in such rituals mayhave understood what was supposed to be happening when a healingsubstance was, as it were, infected with an ill by transferal from apatient.Westermarck’s informants spoke of an abstract quality, the bas,which was imagined as actually passing out of the patient and into thesurrogate in the course of the rite. “The death to which a person isexposed may, as it were, be transferred to an animal by slaughteringit. ... So also the accidental death of an animal is supposed to save itsowner or his family from misfortune. ... All over Morocco it is be-lieved that the accidental breaking of an object ... ‘takes away the bas’from its owner. ... It is good to lose a thing, it takes away the bas.”2“One of my informants ... expressed the opinion that the baraka ofthe prayer (said by a man not used to praying) does not directly killthe animal (which died as a result of the prayer), but that the sin ofthe owner, which is removed from him by the prayer goes into theanimal and kills it.”3Similarly, more mundane and specific ills can be extracted from apatient by appropriate rites. Rather closer to home in Merry OldeEngland, “In former days persons afflicted with fits used to ... sleepall night under the altar-table in the church, holding a live cock intheir arms. ‘In the morning they would let the cock go, when the birdtook off all the fits with him and died soon after.’”4But do these interesting testimonies lead us anywhere, or are weleft with an explanation which applies only to modern Mediterraneanfolklore? Not only did ancient Mesopotamians also speak of evil1E. Westermarck, Ritual and Belief in Morocco, 2 vols. (London, 1926).2Westermarck, Morocco, vol. 1: 607-608.3Westermarck, Morocco, vol 1: 227.4G.

One can transfer the illness to a surrogate by rub-bing the patient with it, as one might use a cloth to rub off dirt. It isnot necessary to rub the surrogate vigorously over the patient; in-stead, a simple physical, visual, or verbal contact is adequate to effecttransfer. “At Fez a person who has a sty goes to somebody else’shouse and knocks at the door. When the people inside ask who it is,he answers them, ‘It is not I who knocked at your door, the styknocked at your door, may it fly from me and stick to you’; then heruns away leaving the sty behind, as it were.”6 A similar, unfortu-nately quite fragmentary, ritual exists from ancient Mesopotamia: “Ifa man’s eyes contain floaters, he goes to the house of a stranger andcalls out to the door ... ‘Take away your floaters!’”7Neither, in Mediterranean folklore, is it necessary to rub or touchsomething against the patient for the special use of the curing ritual—anything which has been rubbed against or in contact with the pa-tient while he was sick will have picked up bits of the illness and canbe used to transfer it to a third party as in this Moroccan spell. “Inthe same tribe a man who is losing many of his animals by death goesto a shrine, taking with him some dates and the peg to which one ofthe dead animals used to be tethered. He puts the dates at the head ofthe grave, asks the saint to remove the cause of the evil, and promiseshim a sheep or goat if his request is granted. He then leaves the pegon the road, hoping that somebody will pick it up and use it andthereby unwittingly transfer the evil to his own animals.”8Particularly effective for such a purpose was the patient’s clothingas in this Italian spell: “To undo the attactura that has caused nettlerash, the afflicted person wears his clothing inside out for three days.This indicates the expulsion of the malignant power. ... The clothingof the fascinated person is then removed and placed at a crossroads,where the first passer-by absorbs the evil in which they were impreg-nated.”95For references, see CAD N/2 7-9.6Westermarck, Morocco, vol. 1: 606.7BAM 515 i 12-13.8Westermarck, Morocco, vol. 1: 173.9W.

On the same day that hecaptured it, in his bed, in the morning before he puts his foot on theground, you ru[b him] from head to foot and you (sic.) say as follows:‘Frog, you know the ‘grain’ which seized me, [but I do not know it].Frog, [you know] the li\"bu which seized me [but I do not know it].When you (try to) hop off and return to your waters, you will return[the evil to] its steppe.’ You have [the patient] say this three times[and] three times he spits into its mouth. You take it to the steppe andyou tie its foot with a band of red and white wool [and you fas]ten itto a baltu [or à“agu-thorn].”10It is obvious that dirt passes into washwater and, it is assumed, sowill evils pass into anything with which a patient washed himself. Thewashwater can simply be allowed to fall to the ground, or it can beused to effect further transfer of the evil. An ancient Mesopotamianhealing ritual instructs: “You rinse (the patient) with well water. Youpour (some of) that water out at a crossroads and he says as follows:‘I received (the evil from them, now) let them receive it from me’. Hebathes himself in the water.”11 Alternatively, the patient can bathe ina river or spring or the sea, leaving his evils behind him as he leavesthe water as in this Moroccan spell. “In Aglu a person who has beenbitten by a mad dog finishes the treatment to which he has beensubjected by going into the sea and letting seven waves pass over hisbody”.12Indirect contact between a patient and a surrogate can beachieved by passing it by him, the idea being that the possessingdemon will find the object waved past irresistable and leave the pa-tient for it as in this Moroccan spell. “An old man from Andjra toldme that when a person is troubled with le-ryah a fowl is killed andboiled without salt. The sick man does not eat of it, but it is taken,whole as it is, to a place nobody visits ... As soon as the fowl is boiledthe jnun begin to eat of it, and while eating they are carried awaywith it; but if anybody walks over it at the place where it is thrown,the jnun will enter into him.”13 An ancient Mesopotamian exampleof a similar rite is the Neo-Assyrian ritual of the goat. “An oppressivespirit which si[t]s on a person—it seizes his mouth.

They leave the staff with the cuptogether somewhere to one side.”15 (These are gifts appropriate toone about to make a journey to the Netherworld.) “They bring thebough (and) the adult male goat to the edge of the road.

When he does, hewill find himself a headless wonder, buried in a pit with his feet notonly tied together but detached and sitting on top of him.)“... He (the patient) eats this [m]eat without ... his hands ...[Th]at person will recover. The spirit which was on him will get up(and go). He will open his mouth. He will eat bread. He will drinkwater.”17 We need not doubt the efficacy of this rite if, as seemslikely, it is a case of “I won’t eat till you give me meat”. Havingconsumed an entire goat, the patient’s craving should be fully ap-peased and his “evil spirit” well exorcised. If Moroccan parallels maybe trusted, however, the meat will have been served to him unsalted.Alternatively, the recipient may stay still and the patient have topass by it, step over it, lie over it, or crawl under it as in this Moroc-can spell. “At a few miles’ distance from Demnat there is a small rockprojecting from the ground in the shape of the back and neck of acamel, with an opening underneath, just large enough for a person tocreep through.

Ancient Mesopotamians recognizedthat diseases could be contagious; the expressions they used to de-scribe this, however (mu“tahhizu; la\"àbu),19 are not related to the verbused to describe transfers (nasà¢u), which implies a complete removal,literally “extraction” of the illness.

He says this three times and reports his doings andthen prostrates himself.”22 (The evil is now in the goat hair package.)“You throw that linen cloth into the gate of a beer merchant and(after) fifteen days you remove it. The profit of the beer merchant willbe diminished but the omen will stand to one side and its evil will notapproach the man and his household.”23 (The hapless beer merchantwas probably singled out for a dry spell due to the fact that his profitscame under the purview of the goddess I“tar,24 who is otherwiseclosely associated with both goats and intercourse).Many of Westermarck’s informants described this process of trans-mission of evils not simply as a transfer but as an exchange of goodand bad qualities between patient and recipient.

This interesting text consists of acollection of three rituals for a woman who is able to get pregnant,but who is plagued by frequent miscarriages.33The first ritual begins with the production of two amulets. “At thesetting of the sun, you isolate (her). You do her shaving onto a pieceof leather and you put (it) around her neck in a new leather bag. Youthread copper beads, lapis, masculine lone-stone, magnetic hematite,and ...-stone on red (wool). You wind three burls of red-dyed wool.You put (it) on her right hand.”34The second of these amulets is perfectly conventional. The mag-netic hematite may have been designed to keep the child in thewomb35 (in which case the amulet would have been removed at thebirth itself). Other ingredients, viz the “masculine” lone-stone and thechoice of the right hand (which is used to release masculine birds inapotropaic rituals)36 may indicate that the woman’s problem in thiscase was specifically the failure to bring male children to term.The first amulet suggests something rather more interesting. Thehair which is shaved off might be presumed to contain the patient’sproblem. If so, anything which came into contact with it would be apotential recipient of the evil. Why then, are the shavings used as anamulet and not simply disposed in some appropriate manner?A hint is given in an unplaced prayer attached to this ritual whichwas probably meant to be performed at this point.37 It goes as fol-lows. “”ama“, you are the one who entirely lights the four quarters.You are the lord of (those) above and below.

If so, then the sorcerer or sorceress will have performedsome ritual to dispatch their sorcery against her. On one level, then,the hairy amulet is simply prophylactic. When the sorcery tries toreach her, it will instead be attracted harmlessly into the bag roundher neck. But there is more to it than that. As the recitation informsus, the judgement of the god ”ama“ was not intended merely to resultin the cure of the woman, but in the punishment of her persecutors.As other antiwitchcraft recitations make clear, what was envisagedwas a situation in which the very ailment inflicted by the sorcerer onthe patient was visited upon him or her or, in other words, his sorcerywas “turned over” upon him.40 In practical terms, the sun god wasexpected to reverse the spell, sending back the sorcery, now loadedwith the patient’s inability to bring children to term which it hadcontacted in the patient’s hair, to reinflict this problem on the sor-cerer who had dispatched it. It is doubtless not irrelevant in thiscontext that the Akkadian word for “hair” (“àrtu) is not dissimilar toone of the words for “sin” and “punishment” (“èrtu).As is usual with transfer rites, however, the woman’s cure is farfrom finished. Just as when one washes very dirty hands with soap,one washing is not sufficient, and even so, you often end up withsome dirt on the towel, so it is rare for a problem of any magnitude tobe completly gotten rid of in a single, unrepeated, act of transfer.“And you give her bread,41 the short (bone) of a male sheep withits meat (still on it), (and) 2 qû-measures of seed grain besides.

She goes and you place the bread,meat, and seed grain in a secluded place, at a crossroads, and she saysfive times: ‘The ones with names have given (them) to me; the oneswithout names have received (them) from me.’ When she has said(this), she takes off her garments and you bathe her with water. Shegets up (out of the water) and dresses in another garment. And shedoes not look down (lètu nadû) behind her.”42When the offerings are left at the crossroads, the woman’s problemis meant to be left with them, as is signalled by the washing andchange of garments with the specific prohibition on looking back(violation of which would result in the return of the problem). Thatthe offerings are meant to symbolize the foetus is made clear by theinclusion of the seed grain and the instruction to suspend them froma wall (as the foetus is suspended in the womb of a standing mother).The specific choice of surrogate may be dictated by the fact that theshin bone is characterized as being “short” (in size). The cut from amale animal is thus a good surrogate for a stillborn boy which is alsoflesh and bone, incomplete, and characterized by a term in the wombwhich is “short” (in time). Having this foetus surrogate spend thenight by the head of the patient serves to attract out the quality ofdifficult births from the real foetus to the surrogate for transfer to theinhabitants of the crossroads, namely ghosts (to whom bread, grainand bits of meaty bone would otherwise be appropriate offerings).43As is known from other references to ghosts, “ones with names” arefamily ghosts lucky enough to have a continuing cult, whereas the“ones without names” are the forgotten ghosts with nobody to carefor them.44 In Akkadian, however, “name” is one way of describingchildren.45 This allows for a rather nice set of puns embedded withina ritual exchange of qualities that would be quite at home inWestermarck’s Morocco. The family ghosts (who have names) are togive their names (i.e., live boys) to the patient and the forgotten ghosts(who have no names) are to take the patient’s no names (the stillbornchildren symbolized by the offerings) in return.Next Ea, god of sweet waters and healing rites is involved in theproceedings. “She goes to the river and she goes down to the river.She draws water three times in a downstream direction and you42SpTU 5 no. 248: 5-11.43See next note.44See J.

Thespell is not mine; it is the recitation of Ea and Asalluhi. It is therecitation of Damu and Gula, the recitation of Ningirim, the mistressof recitations.’ You say (this) three times.” 46The assertion at the end that the spell is a gift of the gods helps toguarantee the compliance of the river (who might be supposed to beunimpressed by a mere mortal’s pleas). The suitablity of the river isensured not merely by the presence of water for purification but alsoby the fact that the word in Akkadian which is used to describemovement in a straight line (as in the river’s flow) is the same as thatused of giving birth easily (as in the baby coming straight out of thewomb), not to mention the obvious fact that the baby itself is accom-panied by an outflow of fluid. Washing three times in a downstreamdirection while reciting the recitation transfers to the river the wom-an’s inability to give birth and in such a way that it will end upflowing straight to the marshes without accidentally reinfecting her.What interests us here in particular is that, once again, the transfer isactually described as an exchange whereby the river and its marshes“receive” the sin or whatever has caused the problem and in returnthe waters add “good things” to the patient and cause her to givebirth easily.Ea is also directly addressed in a recitation whose placement isuncertain. “[Ea], you are the one who created everything.

She goes to a potter’s oven and takes shelter in theoven and she says as follows. ‘Pure oven, eldest daughter of Anu,from whose womb fire is withdrawn; hypogastric region inside whichthe heroic fire god makes his home. You are in good condition andyour implements are in good condition. ... You become full and thenyou become empty. But I am pregnant and then I do not bring toterm what is in my womb. Please give me your things which are wellformed. Take away the things which are not well formed. ... imple-ments do not come out of your womb. May what is in my womb bein good health. May I see its ... Where I live may it be pleasing.’”50The choice of a potter’s oven is dictated by the patient’s problem;it is in some sense also a womb from which foetuses (pots) regularlyemerge, sometimes “whole” (also “well” in Akkadian) and sometimescracked or broken. In this case, the entry of the woman into the ovenis meant to transfer her problem to it—producing healthy childrenand a really badly broken batch of pots. We may presume that thepotter was paid for his oven (to compensate him for the hoped-for lossof crockery). Again, the transfer is explicitly described as an ex-change. “Please give me your things which are well formed. Takeaway the things which are not well formed.”Finally, the woman addresses her problem to a date palm whoseproverbial fertility and tendency to sway in the wind is exploited tothe patients’ advantage. “She goes down to a garden and takes shelter(under) a date palm and (says): ‘Date palm, who receives every wind,receive from me sin (etc.) and where I live, (receive from me having tosay) wah!, not sleeping, di\"u, restlessness, (and) loss of infants, slavesand slave girls as many as there may be so that I may not die in my49Ibid. 19-25.50Ibid. 26-32."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"  ‒    steppe.

You pour out a libation of mi¢¢u-beer and she (the patient) says as follows. ‘Ninkarrak, [ex]halted mis-tress, your merciful mother, may the pregnant ewe of ”akkan andDumuzi53 receive my pregnancy from me and give me her preg-nancy. May she receive from me (my) inability to give birth rightaway and give me her ability to give birth right away.’ She says (this)three times and then in the morning before ”ama“ you ignite a brushpile on top of bricks.

Take away (my) inabilityto give birth right away and give me your ability to give birth rightaway.’ She recites (this) three times each into both ears and, when sherecites (it) she comes out from below the ewe.

As with the material collected by Westermarck,the motif of exchange of good and evil qualities is made quite explicitin the accompanying legomena. “Take away (my) inability to givebirth right away and give me your ability to give birth right away.”The third ritual sees a return to sorcery and crossroads. “Sheplaces two breads each at a crossroads and she takes off her garmentin the midst of the crossroads and puts it back on again57 and saysthis spoken prayer. ‘They brought (the evil) and I received (it); Ibrought it (back) so let them receive (it) from me.’ She says thisrecitation three times and three times she puts out bread. She doesnot look down (lètu nadû) behind her.”58The removal of garments at the crossroads serves to transfer theevil to that location, as is made clear in the prohibition on lookingbehind (which would result in a retransfer of the problem). The reci-tation ties in nicely to this use of garments to make a transfer, sincethe verb used to describe bringing the problem to the crossroads (n“\")is the same as is conventionally used to describe wearing a garment.Thus, going to a crossroads “wearing” (a garment) is linguisticallyequivalent to going there “bringing” (a problem). In this ritual as inthe first one, sorcery is the suspected cause of the problem which iswhy two breads (one for a potential sorcerer and one for a potentialsorceress) are deposited at the crossroads. As usual, the idea of theritual is to reinflict the evil on the sorcerer who is imagined as havingleft something at the crossroads for the victim to pass by and pick up.The victim responds by leaving it again at the crossroads, thus com-pleting the exchange: “They brought (the evil) and I received (it); Ibrought it (back) so let them receive (it) from me.”The ritual continues with a feotus surrogate which, as in the firstritual, is to be left at the crossroads. “You kill a female mouse and youhave it grasp59 a cedar ... in its hands. You fasten ballukku to its headand you swaddle (it) with carded wool. You put (it) at a crossroads.She says this spoken prayer. ‘They brought (the evil) and I received(it); I brought it (back) so let them receive (it) from me.’ She does nottake (to get home) the road she took (to get there). You repeatedly dothis and this at dawn. You put (the bread and mouse) at a crossroads57Reading TÚG i-“ah-hat u GAR.GAR-ma58SpTU 5 no. 248 r. 26-29.59Reading DIB-si."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"  ‒    and she says this spoken prayer. ‘They brought (the evil) and I re-ceived (it); I brought it (back) so let them receive (it) from me.’ Shesays (this) and does not take (to get home) the road she took (to getthere).60The choice of a female animal swaddled like a baby would seem toindicate that, in contrast to the first ritual, where a boy is imagined asthe victim of the putative sorcery, and the second ritual which seemsto be designed for a child of either sex, this ritual was meant to dealwith the specific problem of girls not coming to term. Taking a differ-ent road home serves the same purpose as not looking back: to ensurethat the problem gets left with the offerings. As is usual, the rite isrepeated, although the number of times it is repeated seems to be leftto the patient’s discretion.The ewe of the second ritual is here replaced by a she- ass. “Youstation a pregnant she-ass and the woman holds barley in the cup ofher hand and crawls under the pregnant she-ass and she feeds theshe-ass three times and says this spoken prayer to the she-ass. ‘Maywhat is within you die (and) what is within me live.’ She crawls threetimes under the she-ass and three times she raises up barley to theshe-ass.”61Crawling under the animal accomplishes the transfer of the prob-lem to the animal. The reason that the patient uses the cup of herhand for feeding is probably that there is a visual pun between theword for “cup of the hand” up-nu and the word ár-nu (“sin”) which iswritten with the same cuneiform signs. By offering the she-ass the cupof her hand, she is thus also offering her “sin” which has resulted inher inability to give birth, an offering which the animal accepts byeating the proffered barley.One final rite completes the proceedings. “At noon(?),62 you put”igù“u-grain at the crossroads and then you hang (it) from a windowand then the pregnant woman rubs womb(?) and breast (with it). Onthe day of her labor pains, a girl grinds (it) and they make it into adough with the water of her labor pains and you make a figurine of aman and you make a figurine of a woman. You go in until midnight.At midnight, you throw (it) into the street or they throw it into a road.She ... and enters her house.”63Hanging the grain from the window serves the same purpose ashanging from the wall in the first ritual. Rubbing it against the60SpTU 5 no. 248 r. 30-34.61Ibid r. 35-37.62Reading U4.SA9.63SpTU 5 no. 248 r. 38-41."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"    woman transfers her problem to it. It is presumably ground by a girlbecause it is a female foetus which is in danger of being stillborn.Mixing in the amniotic fluid completes the transfer of evil influencesto the grain. The little figurine of the man and the woman who arethrown into the street at midnight represent the sorcerer and sorcer-ess upon whom the ills are being reinflicted.In sum, not only is the congruence between the methods of trans-fer employed in ancient Mesopotamia and early 20th century Mo-rocco striking, but the legomena of “magical” rites in both areasconfirm a similarity in the basic conceptualization of what was sup-posed to be happening during the transfer. Either a concrete, named,ill or an abstract quality (bas for Moroccans; lemuttu for Mesopota-mians) was imagined as actually passing out of the patient and intothe surrogate in the course of the rite. The modern concept of “con-tagion” should not be applied to such transfer rites. AncientMesopotamians recognized that diseases could be contagious; theexpressions which they used to describe it, however, are not related tothe verb used to describe transfers, which implies a complete re-moval, literally “extraction” of the illness. In contrast to the situationwith contagious diseases, the ill did not simply infect the recipient butwas actually drawn into it, leaving the patient free and clear (and therecipient somewhat damaged) in the process. Thus, another way oflooking at it was as an exchange of good and bad qualities betweenpatient and recipient, an exhange which is not infrequently explictlymentioned in the legomena of transfer rites in both Morocco andancient Mesopotamia."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY, FERTILITY AND THE DARK EARTH:THE USE OF RITUAL PITS IN HITTITE CULTB J CEmory University, American Schools of Oriental ResearchHittite dankui“ daganzipa“, the “dark earth,” refers to the realm of thechthonic deities, the “land beneath the Earth.”1 Thus, it may reason-ably be translated “Dark Underworld,” or simply “Underworld.”Ruling this realm was the Sun Goddess of the Earth, identified inlater periods with Mesopotamian Ere“kigal and Hurrian Allani (Haas1994, 132). She is a solar deity by virtue of representing the sun’scycle at night, after it dips below the horizon in the evening andbefore it rises again in the morning. Thus, rituals performed in orderto communicate with her tend to occur at night, in the early morning,or the late evening.The Sun Goddess of the Earth is also the psychopomp who trans-ports the souls of the deceased to their new abode in the Underworld.A mythological text composed in the period of the Old Kingdomdescribes the voyage of the human soul to this place: “The soul isgreat. The soul is great. Whose soul is great? The mortal soul is great.And what road does it travel? It travels the Great Road. It travels theInvisible Road. ... A holy thing is the soul of the Sun Goddess, thesoul of the Mother” (after Hoffner 1998, 34). A Hittite Death Ritualdescribes how the “Mother,” i.e., the Sun Goddess of the Earth,2comes for the soul of the deceased:A patili-priest who stands on the roof of a building calls down to thehouse. Who(ever) the deceased (is), he keeps calling his name to thosegods among whom he (the deceased) finds himself, (saying) “Where has[he] gone?” The gods answer (from) below and above, “he has gone intothe “inap“i-building.” ... He (the patili-priest) calls down from the roof sixtimes. Six times [he] calls upward. The seventh time when he calls down“where has he gone?,” they answer him from above and below, “theMother [came(?)] to him [and] took him by the hand and led himaway.”3 1Oettinger has argued that this phrase is not in fact original to Hittite, nor indeedto Greek, where it also appears, but is a loan translation from Hurrian (1989/1990,83-98).2For this identification see Otten in Bittel (1958, 84), Beckman (1983, 236).3KUB 30.28 rev. 1-12 is edited by Otten (1958, 96-97), and Beckman (1983,236), whose translation is provided here."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":",     Also dwelling in the Underworld were the Primordial Deities (Archi1990, 114–29), called either by the Hittite karuile“ “iune“, or by theAkkadian Anunnaki.

Their names vary, but in the Ritual to the Underworld Deitiesfor Purifying a House (2), they are named as follows: Aduntarri thediviner, Zulki the dream interpretess, Irpitiga Lord of the Earth,4Narà, Nam“arà, Minki, Amunki, and Àpi. Their connection withmagic is apparent in the titles they bear. Elsewhere, for example, theRitual of Drawing Paths (1), the inhabitants of the Underworld ap-pear to be the goddesses of birth and fate (DINGIR.MAH«.ME” andthe Gul“e“). Still elsewhere (4) the companions to the Sun Goddess ofthe Earth are referred to as the “Male Deities.” In all cases citedbelow, however, their total number, when determinable, is nine.5There was no established cult for these deities. Instead, ritualsdirected toward them were reactive, that is, carried out in response toa specific problem. Their rituals were performed out of doors andcommunication achieved by means of pits dug into the ground. Anumber of words are used in the texts to refer to these pits: H«atte““arand patte““ar are Hittite, in fact the same word except for the inter-change of the initial consonant. Hitt. wappu- is used specifically of claypits dug along the river banks. The other frequently attested term isàpi-, for which Hoffner attempted to demonstrate a connection withHebrew \"ô∫ (1967, 385–401). The Sumerogram ARÀH« “storage pit”also appears.Semantically, these terms are for the most part interchangeable(with the possible exception of ARÀH«), however close examinationconfirms what Hoffner suspected based on the absence of cognates inHittite, that àpi is a Hurrian terminus technicus and appears only inrituals that can be shown to have absorbed many Hurrian elements.The inclusion of the Pit (dÀpi) among the gods of Underworld (as in[2]) is not so much a testimony to its divine status in the proper senseas it is a recognition of its extra-human power to connect the realm ofthe gods with that of man. How we understand Hitt. dÀpi affects theinterpretation of the necromantic episodes in Isa 8:19–23 and 1Sam28:3–25. Hoffner’s consideration of the Hittite term in connectionwith Hebrew \"ô∫ has been criticized on linguistic grounds (see4Or “Lord of Justice”; for this understanding see Otten (1961, 146), and Archi(1990, 118 n. 14).5But see Archi (1990, 120) who refers to the canonical list of twelve found inmost Hittite treaties."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"  ‒    Schmidt 1994, 151–54 for arguments). Moreover, Schmidt interpretsthe Hebrew term as referring to the deceased who returns rather thanthe pit by which he returns, further weakening the equation. How-ever, while Schmidt correctly points out that there are no examples ofnecromancy per se in Hittite texts (1994, 208 n. 331), not even mytho-logical references to such (cf. Enkidu in Mesopotamian literature), thecalling-up of the chthonic deities for the purposes of purification andof offering was practiced in Anatolia as an acceptable, if not alto-gether common, form of magic. The dead who dwell beneath theearth are never actively solicited in surviving documents, but theUnderworld deities are.The vision of the Underworld and of the Sun Goddess of theEarth’s role within it were a part of Hittite ideology at least as early asthe period of the Old Kingdom (1650 BC). However, the ninechthonic gods (Archi 1990) and even the term “dark earth”(Oettinger 1989/90) may be Hurrian influences. Indeed, the majorityof the rituals that use pits stem from the Hurrian milieu. However, afew rituals using pits seem to be free of Hurrian influence eitherbecause they are too early or because geographically they fall outsidethe range of direct Hurrian influence (see [12], [13] and [14] below).Thus, it cannot be claimed that the use of pits in Hittite ritual isentirely of Hurrian derivation.Pits served a number of functions in Hittite ritual: as a channel forthe chthonic deities, both to ease their passage between worlds and asa door through which to receive offerings ([1]–[6]); in combinationwith a pig as a way of ensuring the fertility of the earth and ofhumans ([7]–[9]); as a means of disposing of impurities by consigningthem to the earth as an offering, the impurities either having beenabsorbed into the body of a piglet ([10], [11], [13]), or not (12).In texts (1), (2), and (3) the purpose of the pits is the same (toattract the Underworld deities), although the reason for pulling themup from the earth varies. In (1), the reason is not explained althoughwe may surmise it is to solicit their favor for some endeavor; in (2) thedeities are being sought out as instigators of a house’s impurity andare being asked to cleanse it; in (3) the deity is being attracted to hernew home.

It does not include, although this has beensuggested, the literal removel or lifting of the suppliant from theearth. These rituals might begin, as in (4), with the incipit: “Thus saysTunawiya, Old Woman of H«attu“a: When I take the king and queenoff/from the earth, then I take these things ...”.10 The procedure thatfollows is thus:4 Tunnawiya of Hattu“a’s Ritual of “Taking Off the Earth.”11At the same time as they prepare (all) these (things) in front of the oldwoman, at daybreak, they dig out two storage pits (ARÀH«) (into theearth); they dig one storage pit of the Sun Goddess of the Earth andanother storage pit of the Male Deities. While they begin digging out thestorage pits they drive up a sheep. The old woman consecrates it to theSun Goddess of the Earth. They slit its throat downward into the storagepit and let its blood flow downward.And then they drive up a billy-goat. The old woman consecrates it tothe Sun Goddess of the Earth and to the Male Deities. They slit its throatdownward into the (second) storage pit, releasing the blood downward.Then they butcher (the animals) with respect to the heads and feet.While the fat cooks, soldiers dig out a storage pit.

Texts (7) and (8) both concern fertility.The former describes a ritual in which a female suppliant stands overa pit and recounts the story of the creation of man as part of a rite toregain or ensure her own ability to conceive. Although no pit isexpressly mentioned, the location at a riverbank resembles both (2)and (9), where pits are dug. Moreover, the myth of the creation ofman is echoed in text (2). Thus, we are perhaps on solid ground insuggesting that a pit was utilized in (7) as well.7 The Creation of Man by the Fate Deities.15Let her give [bi]rth often like the pig.

While the pit is open, note that bread andwine are placed in the hole as well, presumably as offerings to theUnderworld gods who otherwise do not figure in this ritual at all.

Alli’s Ritual (12), stemming fromArzawa in western Anatolia, does not utilize a pig for fertility orpurification, nor is it necromantic in nature. It does confirm, how-ever, what we already know, that sorcery and other evils may bedisposed of in the earth, and is included here for the sake of com-pleteness:12 Ritual of Àlli, a Woman of Arzawa.21The old woman takes up five loaves of bread, one vessel of beer, and apeg of kar“ani-wood. She goes outside, and nearby digs (a hole) in theground, and puts the ritual materials in it. She scatters earth over andlevels (it).

If it was a bird (portending) evil, you change it, OSun Goddess of the Earth. Make it (a) favorable (omen) nine times over.‘The tongue (is) a bridge!’”This may explain the offering made to her in response to the omen in(13). The offering of a piglet to this goddess, rather than a sheep (aspossibly in [1]), has a precedent in Hantita““u’s Ritual (11). Thechoice of animal requires some explanation, since the pig is consid-ered ritually unclean and inappropriate as an offering for the gods(Collins 1996). The explanation may lie in the pig’s purificatory roleand the fact that, where the chthonic deities are concerned, purifica-tion and offering are inseparable, as demonstrated in (10) and (11).22KUB 17.28 i 1-24, see Hauptman (1975, 66-67).23The bones are perhaps sold as fertilizer.24KBo 11.10 ii 21'-27' with duplicate KBo 11.72 ii 26'-30' (my translation); iii 14-17, translation is that of Beckman (1986, 25)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":",     The Sun Goddess of the Earth receives another piglet offering in anOld Hittite incantation that employs sympathetic magic to ensure thefertility of the vineyard (15). Several lines after the incantation invok-ing the pig for fertility, the text goes on to list offerings of sheep andgoat to various male gods. The sole female deity, the Sun Goddess ofthe Earth, is listed last, and, rather than a sheep, is provided with“one piglet to the fertile earth.”15 Benedictions for Labarna.25Just as a single pig gives birth to many piglets, let every single branch ofthis vineyard, like the pig, bear many grape clusters. ... One piglet to thefertile earth for the Sun Goddess of the Earth.Corroboration for these rituals with pits and pig(let)s comes from thearchaeology. A piglet burial was found within the Hittite rock sanctu-ary at Yazılıkaya (Hauptmann 1975, 65). Here a pig fetus was foundburied in a pit. Among the bones were found four bronze pins, threeof which were still stuck into the earth. Over the bones a terra-cottalid had been nailed down.26 Although none of the texts specificallyreports nailing a piglet down in a ritual pit, as we have seen, anumber testify to the placement of a piglet in such a pit. It is likelythat the piglet was nailed down in order to render it harmless afterhaving absorbed impurities from an offerant in a purification ritual,but it may at the same time have served as an offering to the chthonicpowers.Although particularly at home in the Luwian-Kizzuwatneansoutheast, where Hurrian influence was greatest, ritual pits in Hittitemagical rites were probably geographically widespread. Althoughmany elements of the Hurrian-influenced rituals are of Hurrian orMesopotamian origin, the presence of pigs is common to bothHurrian and Anatolian ritual, but appear earliest in the Anatolianexamples. It is possible then that their use is an Anatolian feature thatsurvived, and adapted itself to, the adoption of Hurrian ideas andpractices. In any case, for the pig(let) and its connection with the SunGoddess of the Earth, there is yet another comparison to be made.The Thesmophoria is described by Burkert as the principal formof the Demeter cult in Greece, whose distinctive feature is the pigsacrifice. It is a festival to honor the goddess of agriculture, in whichthe women of the community celebrate among themselves in the25KUB 43.23 rev. 19'-22', 57'-58'. “Labarna” is a title of the Hittite king.26The date of the lid could not be determined accurately because it was a typepopular at Boghazköy from the Old Assyrian period onward."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"  ‒    sanctuary of the goddess (Burkert 1985, 242). Detienne, followingBruneau, distinguishes between two Thesmophorian ways of usingpigs as sacrificial victims (1989, 134). In the first, occurring on thefirst day of the three day festival, piglets are hurled into a pit or chasm(megara), where they are left to rot. In the second, as part of the feastof the third day, the victims, adult animals (pregnant sows?, seeClinton, in press), are prepared in the manner of regular sacrificialofferings.It is the first of these types of sacrifice that is of most interest here.The rotted remains of the piglets are retrieved by “Bailers” who placeit on the altar of the goddess where it is mixed with seed. It wasbelieved, according to the scholiast, that anyone fertilizing his fieldwith this substance would have a good harvest. According to Burkert,“the manipulation of the decomposed remains of piglets to achieve agood harvest is the clearest example in Greek religion of agrarianmagic” (1985, 244).The sacrifice has a mythological explanation, which is the rapeand death of Kore at the hands of the god of the Underworld, Hades.When Kore sank into the earth, the pigs of the swineherd Eubouleuswere swallowed up as well. It is in memory of this that the pigs aresacrificed. Chandor (1976, 78) notes that this aetiology is missingfrom the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and surmises therefrom that itwas not a part of the earliest tradition. In other words, there is noneed to seek a similar aetiology in the Hittite material.The separation from male society and the reclining of the women,during the festival, on litters made of a special wood with anaphro-disiac qualities to encourage mensus, serve to reaffirm the fecundityof the female participants in the festival (Detienne 1989, 147). Inaddition, the association of the pig with female sexuality and fertilityis confirmed by Greek literature (Burkert 1983, 259).The connection between fertility, the Underworld, and the sacri-fice of piglets to a goddess connected with both, is compelling, how-ever, a brief summary of the similarities and differences between theGreek and Anatolian phenomena is in order.One difference lies in the slitting of the piglets’ throats in theHittite practice. This was typicial for animals sacrificed to thechthonic gods. In the Greek ritual, however, the piglets are castdown. No blood is allowed to flow—the animal is not an offering inthat sense. In the cult of Demeter, the pits that receive the pigletsseem to be permanant features in the sanctuaries, and numerousexamples have been excavated with piglet bone remains still in them(for example, Priene, Acrocorinth [Stroud 1965], Cnidos,Agrigentum and Bitalemi [Kron 1992]).

In fact,there are no examples of domestic pigs in Hittite art at all. In addi-tion, the Hittite references are to single piglets sacrificed to the God-dess, whereas the Greek cult involved multiple suppliants andmultiple piglets.At the same time, some tantalizing parallels present themselves. Atthe Thesmophoria, pine cones and cakes are placed in the pits withthe piglets, also as symbols of fertility. Although text (5) does notinvolve a piglet, a pine cone is placed in the pit with other offerings.Also, sweet and fat breads that serve as offerings to the chthonic godsin almost every instance are varieties of cakes and almost certainlydenote fertility, as in text (8). The breads are placed into the pit withthe piglets, and (14) even refers to the kara“-grain of a pig beingmingled with the blood of the slain piglet in the pit. There is nosuggestion, however, of the remains being extracted and used in afield. Rather it is likely, as suggested by (13) that the piglet was sacri-ficed directly in the field whose fertility was sought.As part of the initiation into the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter,initiates had to supply a pig for sacrifice.27 The animal was a substi-tute for the initiate, “life was exchanged for life” (Burkert 1983, 258).Although having little do to with initiation, the animals sacrificed inthe Hittite rituals described here are almost invariably substitutionsfor the patient or suppliant. This is particularly evident in the Ritualof “Taking Off the Earth” (4). In one royal substitution ritual, theking, addressing the Sun Goddess of the Earth, incants, “take these(substitutes). Set me free!

Hannahanna’s sacred animal is27For a complete discussion of pig sacrifice in Greece, see Clinton (in press). ForGreek animal sacrifice in general, see Jameson (1988). Clinton comments that “whatis especially interesting about the pig is its use in such a great variety of ritual—(1)normal, so called “Olympian” sacrifice, (2) holocaustic sacrifice, (3) purifications, (4)bathing of the “mystic piglets” in Phaleron by the Eleusinian initiates, (5) and depo-sition of the piglets in pits at the Thesmophoria.” In Anatolia, the variety of attestedpig sacrifices is limited to purifications and deposition in pits, which may be purifica-tion, offering, or fertility, or some combination thereof.28KUB 24.5 rev. 7-8, edited by Kümmel (1967, 12-13), translated by Goetze(1969, 355)."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"  ‒    the bee, and she, like the Sun Goddess of the Earth, is attested on onefestival occasion receiving a piglet as an offering.29Somehow, the separate porcine associations of fertility and purifi-cation/offering to the supreme deity of the Underworld combined togenerate a ritual koiné of Anatolian derivation30 involving both ele-ments and in which fertility itself becomes chthonian by virtue bothof its symbolic association with the pig and of the ambiguity inherentin the term “earth” (as both cultivated/fertile soil and underworld).The Greeks shared both these associations for the pig(let). Clinton (inpress), discussing pig sacrifice in Greece, similarly concludes that “inthe Thesmophoria the deposition of piglets in the pits and the sacri-fice of pregnant sows may be called ‘chthonian,’ for each action cel-ebrates, in its own way, the fertility of the earth.”29“[They dedicate(?)] one piglet to ›anna¢anna [and] they cook that same[pig]let in a pot.” KBo 20.89 obv.(?) 9'-10'.In this connection, note also the comparison that has been made between theHomeric Hymn to Demeter (Burkert 1979, 123-25) and the Anatolian series of mythsabout a deity who goes missing and must be coaxed back to his/her place in thecosmos. In one version of the Anatolian myth, the divine protagonist is Hannahanna(Hoffner 1998, no. 8), whose sacred bee is instrumental in nearly every version of themyth in restoring the deity. Closing this circle of connections, the Sun Goddess ofthe Earth is also associated with the bee, which she sends as an evil omen in (14).30Alternatively, should we see in the ritual for Demeter a descendent of Hittitepractices and in the goddess herself a Greek cooption of the Anatolian Sun Goddessof the Earth?"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":",     RArchi, A.1990 The Names of the Primeval Gods.

SUniversity of MichiganThrough the centuries, interpreters have typically attributed the ritualperformances reported, listed, or alluded to in the Hebrew Bible toone of two distinct communities of antiquity: those peoples character-ized as Canaanites performed rituals of magic, while those identifiedas Israelites were to engage in the rites of religion. As the most com-prehensive catalogue of so-called magic and divination preserved inthe Hebrew Bible, Deuteronomy 18:9-11 has served as a major da-tum for most studies concerned with the topic of ancient Canaanitemagic.1 However, the following analysis of Deuteronomy 18 suggeststhat, while such a prevailing interpretive mode might find some basisin isolated biblical traditions, the Hebrew Bible hardly affords aunanimous voice on what distinguishes the domains of magic andreligion, let alone how one is to recognize a Canaanite over againstan Israelite.An Analysis of Deuteronomy 18:9-11Literarily speaking, Deuteronomy 18 forms part of the transitionseparating the final stages of the wilderness wanderings from thecommencement of the conquest of Canaan. The more immediatecontext of Deuteronomy 18 is Moses’ farewell speech on Mt. Nebo,and it is from this vantage point, overlooking the promised land ofCanaan, that Moses contrasts several ritual professions with the rolesof the king, levitical priest, and true prophet. In the end, he censuresthe former on the basis of their origins in Canaanite culture.1Cf. e.g., William Robertson Smith’s lengthy article spanning two fascicles of the1885 issue of the Journal of Philology, “On the Forms of Divination and Magic Enu-merated in Deuteronomy 18.10,1, Part 1,” and , “...Part 2,” pp. 273-87 and pp. 113-28 respectively (in volumes 13/26 and 14/27).

Lohfink“Die Sicherung,” 152-53 viewed 17:9-11 as an older text dealing with inquiry di-rected to God that was applied to Torah. This reapplication in turn has resulted ininternal tensions within the pericope.7The generally accepted position that 2 Kgs. 23:4-20 deliberately presents Josiahas in conformity with the demands of the law of Moses is presupposed here, cf. alsoA. D. H. Mayes, The Story of Israel between Settlement and Exile: A Redactional Study of theDeuteronomistic History (London, 1983), 131. While any comparison of these two pas-sages runs into the difficulty of explaining the relationship between the priests andLevites, Emerton has argued with regard to the phrase, kòhanîm hal(6)wiyyim* kòl` “èbe†lèwî, “the priests, the Levites, the whole tribe of Levi,” in Deut. 18:1, that asyndetonis rare while apposition is very common ( J. A. Emerton, “Priests and Levites inDeuteronomy,” VT 12 [1962]: 129-38; cf. P. Joüon, A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew, 2vols., trans. and rev. T. Muraoka. [Rome, 1991], 477-81, 649-53).8H.-D. Hoffmann, Reform und Reformen: Untersuchungen zu einem Grundthema derdeuteronomistischen Geschichtsschreibung (Zürich, 1980), 208-226 is more skeptical aboutthe existence of a law book per se forming the basis of Josiah’s reform. Accordingly,the account of the law book’s discovery is fictitious. 2 Kgs. 23:4-20 depends uponsome vague historical traditions about a reform in Josiah’s time and is a collection inone place of all references to the reform.9Lohfink “Die Sicherung,” 149.

Rather, it is the the accom-panying theory of numerous dtr redactions and the propensity toatomize the pericope and to assign half and quarter verses to as manyas four redactional strata for vv. 9-14.12The language of Deut. 18:9-14 supports the notion that a dtr handis at work, for it has clear links with dtr and other late texts. This isthe case for v. 9b: hgwym hhm, “those nations.”13 The same applies forv. 9bα: (t)lmd l'≤wt, “learn to imitate.”14 Finally, v. 9bβ: ktw'bt hgwym,“detestable ways of the nations” reflects the same associations.15Verse 9b cannot be separated from v. 9a as the latter, beginning as itdoes with a kî clause, demands an apodosis for the protasis and it canno longer be presumed that vv. 10-12a formed the original apodosisof a hypothetically older v. 9a, for as we shall argue shortly, therelative antiquity of these verses is in doubt. Moreover, the stereotypi-cal opening to the law in 18:9a, ky + bw\" + \"r.ß, is found in 7:1; 8:7;17:14; and 23:21 (ET 20) [sic?], all of which have been identified asforming part of the parenesis of the book.16 Based on the fact that theform yr“ shows up in each of these texts and that this form nevershows up in the pre-dtr laws of Deuteronomy, Lohfink assigned all ofthese parenetic verses to a dtr hand.17 He also argued for the dtrorigins of the terms ntn and \"rß in 18:9a.18The dtr character of 18:9-12 gains further support from the de-tailed analysis of García López, in spite of his propensity to atomize11García López, “Un profeta como Moisés,” 290-308. The author left the statusof v.13 undecided. G. Seitz, Redaktionsgeschichtliche Studien zum Deuteronomium (Stuttgart:1971), 235-43 offered the following reconstruction: (1) a pre-deuteronomic text, vv.10-12a; (2) a deuteronomic collection, vv.9, 12b, 14-15; (3) a deuteronomic elabora-tion, vv. 16-18; and (4) a dtr elaboration, vv. 19-22. He viewed v. 13 as simply late.Cf. also the redactional levels identified by Mayes, Deuteronomy 279-80: (1) the oldeststage, vv. 10-12a; (2) a deuteronomic legislation, vv.9, 12b; (3) a post-dtr addition tothe law, vv. 15-18 (v. 14 is a connecting link); and (4) a still later addition, vv. 19-22.Verse 13 is an isolated later addition.12See Th.

Nevertheless, some critics assign 18:11 to a pre-exiliccompositional stratum. The early compositional date for 18:11 isfounded upon the (often unstated) premise that the verse preserves anold law banning necromancy reflected in Isa. 8:19; 19:3; 29:4; and 1Sam. 28:3, 7-9.23 But the argument for the early attestation of \"ôbôtand yidd^'ònîm in v.11 rests on shaky ground.

As for itsoriginal legitimacy in the Yahwistic cult, Isa. 30:33 clearly connectsYahweh and the Tophet, and if no such connection was intended inthis allusion to Assyria’s destruction, then one would have expectedsome disclaimer to that effect. In any case, the sacrifice of the firstborn to Yahweh and the Molek sacrifice were possibly related, if notone and the same cult.30 Although the former required that first bornsons be sacrificed to Yahweh, while the latter listed children gener-ally, and of both sexes, as sacrifices to Molek, the fact that daughterscould legally substitute for sons as first born heirs, as Num. 27:1-8and the texts from Emar and Nuzi demonstrate, favors theircommonality.31 In other words, the two traditions might reflect thesame or similar cult but from complementary perspectives, the onemore narrowly construed and the other more broadly based. There-fore, texts that refer to the sacrifice of the first born to Yahweh, suchas Gen. 22:1-14; Exod. 13:2, 12-13, 15; 22:28-29 (ET 29-30); 34:19-20; Micah 6:6-7; and Ezek. 20:25-26, 31 can be related to the Molekcult. Moreover, Molek’s connections with Baal (cf. Jer. 2:23; 3:24;19:5; 32:35) are more likely part of the inventive dtr rhetorical po-29Cf. Preuss, Deuteronomium, 138.

Passages like Jer. 7:31; 19:5; 32:35; Ezek. 23:38-39;Lev. 20:3; Zeph. 1:5 in any case, indicate that the Molek cult wasconsidered by some sectors of Israelite society as part of the Yahwehcult. Furthermore, the location of the Molek cult in the HinnomValley might only allude to its controversial role within the Yahwehcult. That is to say, sacrifices to Molek may have been observed in thetemple precinct in the days of Ahaz (and Hezekiah) and Manasseh,but moved to the Valley in the initial stages of Josiah’s reign andagain thereafter as Jer. 7:31-32; 19:5; and 32:35 would suggest.33 Itshould be noted that the two references in 2 Kgs. 16:3 and 21:6—notto mention its observance in the north mentioned in 17:17—do notlocate the Molek cult at Tophet, and Josiah’s defilement of Tophet in2 Kings 23:10 does not explicitly attribute its observance there toeither Ahaz or Manasseh. In other words, the Molek cult as por-trayed in dtr and related traditions was probably not restricted toTophet. In fact, texts like 2 Kgs. 21:3-6 and 23:11-12 assume theworship of several deities such as Baal, Asherah, the host of heaven,and the solar deity as having taken place in the Jerusalem templeprecinct. Alternatively, the author in 2 Kgs. 23:10 might only behighlighting the Tophet as the major cultic location dedicated towhat the writer perceived to be the Molek cult. In other words, it wasnot the only Molek shrine.Even if one were to grant for the sake of argument that Molek wasYahweh’s chthonic aspect or an independent netherworld deity of theYahwistic cult in late pre-exilic Judah, one would hardly expect thedtr or related traditions to acknowledge openly such a reality. 2 Kgs.21:3-6 depicts the worship of several deities in the Jerusalem templeprecinct as “syncretistic” and “Canaanite” in origin. Such a perspec-tive is clearly the invention of a dtr rhetorical polemic in the case ofAsherah, for other data favor her earlier status as the consort ofYahweh in non-dtr forms of Yahwism. Thus, the association of thegod Molek with the practice of human sacrifice might also be thepurposeful invention of the dtr and related traditions. Convincing32In fact, the unqualified form of the law of the first born in Exod. 22:28-29 (ET29-30) might have its echo in Ezek. 20:26, as neither presuppose the option ofredeeming the first born found in the parallel and, we would suggest, late legislativetexts, Exod. 13:2, 12-13, 15 (P) and 34:19-20 (P, not J).33The DtrH does not depict Hezekiah as purging the Molek cult, cf. 2 Kgs. 18:1-4."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"  ‒    extra-biblical evidence for Molek’s (= Malik’s) chthonic associations,let alone his patronage of the cult of child sacrifice, has yet to berecovered from Syria-Palestine.34 In fact, the texts from Ugarit castdoubt even on his more general chthonic associations.35 In otherwords, the dtr traditions attempted to distance (artificially) humansacrifice from Yahweh and the Yahwistic cult by making Molek thepatron deity of the cult, whereas the non-dtr traditions did not.A similar rhetorical strategy was implemented in the case of thesecond practitioner listed in Deut. 18:10, qòsèm q^sàmîm, “the augur.”Both Isa. 3:2 and Micah 3:6-7, 11 establish the legitimacy of thispractice in pre-exilic Yahwistic religion, but it too is condemned inlater dtr circles (1 Sam. 15:23; 28:8; 2 Kgs. 17:17) and dependenttexts.36 A possible reference to augury in the redacted text, Isa. 2:6,not only supports the dtr concern to condemn such a practice, but italso offers a possible clue to its perceived origin.

In spite ofits earlier legitimacy (cf. Isa 3:2, Micah 3:6-7), augury’s foreign paral-lels were cited as the rationale for its proscription.41So H. Rouillard, La pericope de Balaam (Nombres 22-24): La prose et les “oracles”(Paris, 1985) whose work is not mentioned in M. S. Moore, The Balaam Traditions:Their Character and Development (Atlanta, 1990). Note that the episode of Agag is men-tioned in 24:7, a story attributed to Saul’s day in what is recognized as a late text, 1Samuel 15. Moreover, vv. 17-18 speak of the wars of David against Edom andMoab. Rouillard proposed four redactional stages for the Balaam story; (N1) 22:2-21;22:36-23:26 [650-40 B.C.E.], (N2) 22:22-35 [after Josiah’s reform], (N3) 23:27-24:6[exilic], and (N4) 24:7-24 [soon after the exile]. Having compared the Balaam storyand Second Isaiah, J. Van Seters, review of La péricope de Balaam (Nombres 22-24), byH. Rouillard, JSS 31 (1986): 245-47 dates Rouillard’s N1, N3, and N4 to the exilicperiod, while N2 constitutes a secondary addition. In his second installment to hiscommentary on Numbers, B. Levine, Numbers 21-26, The Anchor Bible 4A (NewYork, 2000), 232-37 dates the original composition of the Balaam poems to the firsthalf of the 9th century, the narratives to the late 7th century or shortly thereafter,and the story of Balaam’s ass to the post-exilic period.42Following the RSV.43Some commentators take 22:5 as indicative of Balaam’s Syrian origins where heis identified as the son of Beor at Pethor, by the River in the land of Amaw, but seenow Levine, Numbers 21-36, 147-49 who, following the Samaritan and Vulgatetraditions, emends the phrase to read “the land of the Ammonites.” 23:7 placesBalaam in Aram. P. J. Budd, Numbers Word Biblical Commentary (Waco, 1984), 254(n. 5b) noted both the Syrian and northern Mesopotaman locations of Amaw pro-posed by scholars, but preferred to identify Balaam as a Mesopotamian seer (cf. p.272).44This verse is found in Rouillard’s N1 stratum and is Josianic in date accordingto the author.45Rouillard’s N2.46Cf.

The soothsayer showsup otherwise only in (dtr) passages of the DtrH (2 Kgs. 21:6), in lateprophetic passages (Jer. 27:9; Isa. 57:3), in the HC (Lev. 19:26), andin the Chronicler (2 Chr. 33:6 = 2 Kgs. 21:6).The sorcerer too is attested in a (dtr) text of the DtrH (2 Kgs.9:22), in late prophetic texts (Jer. 27:9; Isa. 47:9,12; Nahum 3:4; Mal.3:5; Dan. 2:2) and in the Chronicler (2 Chr. 33:6 = 2 Kgs. 21:6).52 Inexilic and post-exilic prophetic traditions, this profession is connectedwith Mesopotamian influences, particularly Babylonian (Isa. 47:9,12)and Assyrian (Nahum 3:4).53 In sum, soothsayers and sorcerers aredepicted as relative late comers to Yahwistic religion, as foreign,namely, Mesopotamian imports, and are therefore condemned.The next practitioner, the “diviner,” or m^na ̇è“, is never men-tioned in pre-exilic or exilic prophetic texts.

Like the practiceof augury, it is also found in the late story of Balaam, Numbers 22-24.54 Balaam is described as one well versed in the foreign arts ofdivining (23:23, cf. also 24:1) and augury (23:23, cf. also 22:7). Asnoted above, it is indeed surprising that there is no condemnation ofBalaam as diviner and augur except in the secondary addition ofNum. 22:22-35.55 In 23:23, possibly part of the earliest section of thestory, there is no denunciation.56 Finally, the “charmer,” or ̇òbèr ̇àber is likewise never mentionedin pre-exilic prophetic texts, but like the sorcerer, the charmer isdepicted in Isa. 47:9,12 as having Babylonian connections (cf. vv. 1, 5and Dan. 2:2). Having concluded that Hebrew ̇-b-r was cognate withAkkadian ubbùru, “bind magically,” Held has suggested that Isa. 47:9,12 comprises a satire on Neo-Babylonian magic.57In sum, none of the practices listed in Deuteronomy 18 were con-demned in pre-exilic prophetic traditions. Neither Hosea nor Amosnor, for that matter, the Elijah-Elisha school stood in opposition tothem. Two of the practices, human sacrifice and augury, were com-patible with earlier Yahwistic religion and only later condemned indtr circles. The remaining four, soothsaying, sorcery, divining, andcharming, were not attested in pre-exilic texts. This might indicatethat while these professions were compatible with earlier forms ofYahwism (admittedly the texts are silent on this point), they came topose a threat to dtr ideology only by the exilic perod or thereafter.When they do show up in later dtr texts or texts influenced by dtrideology, they are depicted as illicit practices and outlawed.The prophetic traditions connect the forbidden status of thesepractices to their foreign attachments.

Nevertheless, the“foreign origins” tradition as a basis for proscription was, in the caseof augury, a clear case of rhetorical polemic, for augury is depicted inother biblical traditions as compatible with pre-exilic Yahwistic reli-gion. As we pointed out previously, such purposeful distortion is char-acteristic of the dtr ideology. The same rhetorical strategy is evidentin the dtr polemics against Manasseh, the alleged bull cult of Jero-boam, the cult of Asherah, and, perhaps, the cult of Molek or humansacrifice. Admittedly, in the case of sorcery, divining, and charming—all possible late comers to Israelite tradition—the stated Assyrian andBabylonian influences might reflect genuine instances of foreign, im-perial “syncretism” of what constituted a local polytheistic cult. Alter-natively, perhaps their similarity with already extant Israelite formsgave rise to the ban on their observance. In any case, whether theseattachments are real or contrived, as in the case of augury, a foreignorigins scenario played a central role in the dtr polemic against thesepractices.Another observation alluded to earlier lends confirmation to theexilic or post-exilic compositional setting for at least vv. 10-11 ofDeuteronomy 18. Of the various lists of illicit practices which includethe \"ôbôt and yidd'ònîm, Deut. 18:10-11 is clearly the most expansivewith its list of seven or eight ritual practices.58 A comparison of therelated lists in 2 Kgs. 21:6 and 2 Chr. 33:6 indicates that the inven-tory tended to expand over time. The addition in 2 Chr. 33:6 to thefive item list in 2 Kgs. 21:6 involves a profession attested only in lateprophetic texts, namely, the sorcerer (cf. dtr Micah 5:11 [ET 12]; Jer.27:9; and Isa. 47:9,12). In Deut. 18:10-11, the sorcerer and threeother professions, the augur, charmer, and consulter of the dead,were added to what probably comprised an earlier inventory of out-lawed ritual professions. These items are otherwise condemned onlyin late texts (Isa. 47:9, 12 and dtr Isa. 2:6 and 8:19). Thus,Deut.18:10-11 might comprise a later stage in an ever expandinginventory of illicit ritual professions.58Cf. the following passages for lists of three or more: Lev. 20:2-6; 1 Sam. 28:3, 7-9; 2 Kgs. 17:17; 21:6; Isa. 8:19; Jer. 27:9; 2 Chr. 33:6. The practitioner “ò\"èl \"ôbw^yidd^'ònî, “he who inquires of the One-who-returns and the Knower,” is one whoinvokes ghosts. For the identity of the \"ôb and the yidd^'ònî as ghosts, it should benoted that the phrase, in Deut. 18 “ò\"èl \"ôb w^yidd^'ònî stands in apposition to “thenecromancer” dòrè“ \"el-hammètîm, “He who consults the dead ones.” Likewise, thephrase, dir^“û \"el-hà\"òbôt w^\"el-hayyidd^'ònîm, in Isa. 8:19 is semantically paralleled byyirò“... \"el-hammètîm.

In 1 Kgs. 20:33, the Syrians aredepicted as diviners, while in 2 Kgs. 9:22 sorcery appears inPhoenician dress. Moreover, the augur and the soothsayer are foundamong the Philistines in 1 Sam. 6:2 and Isa. 2:6 in spite of the factthat the augur was compatible with pre-exilic Yahwistic religion. Thediviner and sorcerer are depicted in Egyptian dress in Gen. 30:27;44:5, 15 and Exod. 7:11 (cf. also Exod. 22:18 [ET 19]). As the pre-ceding analysis demonstrates, however, the preponderance of refer-ences assume Mesopotamian influence. In other words, easternmagical traditions were negatively influential in the formation of thebiblical traditions’ idealized world, and the passages depicting for-eign, but non-Mesopotamian, connections point to a subsequent rhe-torical expansion on that dtr perspective. In these instances, the“ethnic” boundaries were widened so as to include (and condemn.)other foreign, but now local, non-Israelite peoples (Egypt being thelone exception). The compositional histories of those texts that identify foreign, butnon-Mesopotamian, origins for the professions listed in Deuteronomy18 confirm the secundary association of these ritual practices with thelocal populations. 1 Kgs. 20:33 and 2 Kgs. 9:22 probably constitutelater additions to DtrH.59 Isa. 2:6 is a dtr addition and 1 Samuel 1-7might be the product of an exilic dtr hand.60 Exod. 7:11 and22:18(ET 19) might be part of a P or dtr redaction, and the Genesistexts might be modeled on passages in the DtrH.61 In sum, contraryto the impression one might gain by reading only Deuteronomy 18 inisolation, none of the practices therein can claim a distinctively“Canaanite” cultural origin.6259So G.

The list in Deuteronomy 18 comprisesa conflation of late, but pre-existing, inventories of illicit ritual. Nev-ertheless, some of these rites are portrayed in earlier traditions of theHebrew Bible as legitimate religion in Israelite society. This is so inspite of the fact that the same rites are depicted as those observed inneighboring cultures. The dtr “Canaanizing” of the various rituals orperformers listed is clearly a rhetorical strategy designed topolemicize against formerly acceptable cults now competing with thecontemporary dtr brand of Yahwism.Deuteronomy 18’s taxonomy of taboo has its parallel in the inother classification systems of control such as professions lists,demonological catalogues, and pollution inventories.63 Indicationsare that within the socio-historical realities of Near Eastern cultures—including that of ancient Israel—, ritual specialists, like other workers,were often classified according to skills and services performed. Spe-cialists of the regular cults and annual festivals and those of problem-oriented or crisis rituals were differentiated. By problem solvingritualists, I refer to those who performed such techniques as exorcismor the frightening away of a demon, propitiation or the buying off ademon, and the transfer or the sending of a demon elsewhere.Despite these functional distinctions and labels, the comparativeevidence demonstrates that those specialists overseeing both the crisisoriented rituals and the regular ritual complexes shared the samebelief systems, served the same gods, received the same education,and regarded each other as legitimate practitioners. The writer ofDeuteronomy 18 might have utilized such a professions list when helocated the ritual specialists of 18:9-14 in close proximity to otherpractitioners such as the king (17:14-20), the levitical priest (18:1-8),and the prophet (18:15-22). However, a demarcation at this level cannot adequately account for the ideological polemic uniquely aimed atthe ritual specialists listed in 18:9-14.

But here the deciding criterion for the distinctionbetween harmful and defensive magic is the concern for social cohe-sion, not one’s professional skill or service. A similar categorizationscheme is found in demonological catalogues. In these, numina areclassified according to whether or not they acted malevolently orbenevolently toward the living, whether they strengthened the statusquo social structures or they eroded them. These catalogues couldfunction as pollution inventories.Zoological, polymorphic, meteorological, astrological, anatomical,topological, and behavioral criteria were used in classifying the de-monic. Wiggerman has identified a dominate strategy in first millen-nium Mesopotamian demonology that entails a combinatory logicresulting in a polymorphic scheme. A given quality represented by ananimal was abstracted, creating an awe-inspiring exemplary memberof that animal group. This in turn was combined with various humanattributes in order to make that force or power an imaginary one.This served to distinguish that animal-human member from the indi-vidual ordinary member. In other words, zoological and anthropo-morphic elements were combined to create a demon. Eventuallythose demons who were defeated in cosmic battle by the anthropo-morphic gods of the pantheon in Assyro-Babylonian theology becamebeneficent protective spirits.64 A corresponding differentiation among numina based on theirperceived powers to affect the living might ultimately underlie the dtr64Cf.

Green, “Beneficent Spirits and MalevolentDemons: The Iconography of Good and Evil in Ancient Assyria and Babylonia,”Visible Religion 3 (1984): 80-105 added that the difference between demons and mon-sters or protective spirits depended more upon their function in a given period thanon any essential character trait attached to them, cf. also L.

Perhaps itwas along such a dividing line that dtr writers categorized rituals aslegitimate or illegitimate, the crucial issue being the deity or numenwho participated. In other words, a concern for social cohesion asinvisioned by the biblical writers might have informed their tax-onomy of taboo. It should be pointed out, however, that dtr and, forthat matter, other biblical traditions generally avoided the mention ofthe numen underlying a specific ritual that was classified as an abomi-nation. The identity of the specific numen was not made the explicitbasis for deciding the question of a ritual’s legitimacy. The classifica-tion was decided instead on the basis of whether a ritual was compat-ible with a specific brand of Yahwism. If a ritual was acceptable, thenit was classified as an Israelite religious rite. If not, then it was charac-terized or categorized as having Canaanite origins. This is clearly thecase with the legal traditions, and only rarely do the narrative orprophetic contexts offer exceptions. When a ritual complex was ex-plicitly associated with a supernatural power, it is typically a generic(and somewhat artificially construed) “foreign” deity like Baal orAsherah that is mentioned.Its more likely the case that the dtr traditions opted for a variationon the demonological taxonomy. The location of the various ritualpractices in Deuteronomy 18 in the land of Canaan more closelyapproximates the kind of demonological topology attested, for exam-ple, in Egypt of the Late Period. In Egypt, all things associated withthe liminal world of the frontier or periphery were demonized.65 Asmentioned above, the dtr rhetorical strategy entailed a secondaryalteration of the distant foreign attachments of the practices listed soas to include in Deut. 18:10b-12a the local, non-Israelite,populations. These peoples, labelled the Canaanites, in turn came tosymbolize pre-exilic antagonisms in the land. But in line with thebiblical Tendenz to avoid the explicit mention of demons by name, ourauthor implemented a rhetorical strategy in which those competingsupernatural forces typically organized in other traditions by the clas-sification of their personification as demons have been organized in-stead according to the corresponding ritual practitioner.66At this juncture it might be relevant to point out that in Mesopo-tamia some monsters—and we would add demons—might have de-65For Late Period Egypt, cf. e.g., D.

The fact that the ghosts of thedead are explicitly mentioned in 18:11 and are not other demons andmonsters might suggest that the concurrent classification systems ofdemons and monsters—assuming that such existed in ancient Israel-ite society—did not include the ghosts of the dead. This in turnsupports the notion that the eventual transformation of the Israelitedead from frail shades into supernaturally powerful beneficent ghostsunder late Mesopotanian influence, was in no way an indicator oftheir potential to do harm or the even later re-characterization of thedead as demons.68 In the final analysis, the construction of such a list exposes the re-contextualized nature of Canaanite magic and divination in the He-brew Bible. Biblical writers rhetorically categorized non-conformingrites as foreign—usually, “Canaanite”—in origin and then had themcondemned by such culture heroes of the past as prophets, priests,and kings, but especially, the nation’s founding leader, Moses. By“Canaanizing” rival ritual complexes from the indigenous culture, byprojecting them back into hoary antiquity, and by having Moses, theprophet par excellence, condemn them as foreign abominations, thebiblical rhetoric of self-identity marginalized competing ideologies.Thus, unlike the magic of artifact and inscription, magic in the He-brew Bible has far less to say about the phenomenology of magic inancient Israelite society and far more to tell about its function as acategory of control in matters of purity and pollution. Nevertheless,when the results of a study like this on the subject of magic as arhetorical or ideological tool in the Hebrew Bible is brought alongsidean investigation of magic as ritual in ancient Levantine archaeologyand inscription, an evaluation of the evidence as a whole indicatesthat magic and divination were fundamental religious elements ofancient Israelite society, not marginalized syncretistic rituals.67Cf.

Scholars since Tambiah, such as Catherine Bell,have carefully delineated the variety of ways in which ritual works asmagic. They suggest that the definitive differentiation between magicand religion, long associated with the “Judaic legacy” is far moreambivalent than might be expected. The distinction between magicand other types of ritual appears “a hindrance to objective analysis”and “closely tied to historical biases.” Worship and magic do notseem separate entities, but rather parts of a single whole.2 They worktogether within a social setting, sometimes supporting the status quo,sometimes challenging it, but coordinated in their attitudes, ap-proaches, and concerns. Witchcraft and sorcery are not as far re-moved from traditional religious actions as might be expected.3Magic and liturgy overlap so closely that many religious traditionsfind it necessary to create a distinction between them.

Learning what a group considers dangerous aboutmagic, uncovering the perversion it attributes to magic, also revealsthe positive self-image a group seeks to create. This study seeks tofollow that insight. It looks at a rejection of magic discussed in theTalmudic tractate Sanhedrin and then seeks to evoke the type ofJudaism contrasted with magic. It focuses in particular on the ideas ofRabbi Aqiva ben Yosef (whose dates are approximately 50-132 c.e.)whose approach to magic dominates the Talmudic approach andwhose close association with magic in Judaism needs investigation.That investigation takes on special meaning when applied to oneversion of the story of Aqiva’s martyrdom.This study has particular relevance because that “early Judaiclegacy” of which Tambiah speaks is no less ambiguous about magicthan any other tradition. The early practitioners of Judaism, the rab-binic leaders, employed a type of ritualism that itself was thought tobe automatic and effective. Use of divine names, for example, ena-bled a skilled religious leader to control angelic forces and powers.4Rabbis created living entities out of clay, cursed their enemies,blessed their supporters, and manifested supernatural powers. Yetwhile they did so, they tried to resolve the ambiguity by stressing thatwhat they were doing could not fall under the proscribed practice of“magic.” As Michael D. Swartz points out, the rabbis needed tojustify their practices both to themselves and others. Since the He-brew Bible forbids magic and since the Roman government regardedsuch rituals as potentially subversive and revolutionary, the rabbisrequired a way of claiming that their actions did not qualify as“magic.” Swartz remarks that they “are in continual need to validatetheir practices by showing that their power derives from God and issanctioned by those most in communication with him.”5Swartz, in a more extended discussion, notes that magic is ambigu-ous in many ways. Not only is its nature unclear, but its relationshipto the historical and social context is also variable. The twin claims ofexclusive knowledge and the availability of that knowledge, the dou-ble-edged power of magic both to support and to undermine thesocial structure, and the interplay of purity and impurity in the rituals4See Rebecca Lesses, “The Adjuration of the Prince of the Presence: Performa-tive Utterance in a Jewish Ritual,” in Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, Marvin Meyerand Paul Mirecki, eds.

Swartz uncovers “a deep ambivalence to-ward rabbinic notions of Torah, tradition and purity” that whileclearly present in “mystical” ritual also penetrates into the “official”practice of Jewish leaders.6 This internal struggle within Jewishsources makes the discovery of the criteria used an important effort.That discovery will not reveal what magic “really” is. The presentstudy looks at rabbinic self-presentation. It does not ask whether theway the rabbis justify and validate their practices “actually” succeedsin its intent. What is undeniable, however, is that rabbinic sources doacknowledge the difficulty and problem of differentiating their prac-tice from magical activity. The talmudic discussion of Deuteronomy18 in Babylonian Talmud Tractate Sanhedrin 65aff. discusses theseissues. The Mishnah codifies the biblical laws in Deuteronomy 18and the penalties associated with them. Talmudic rabbis do not dis-pute the effectiveness of magic. There is much they debate about theintricacies of magical procedure but they do not doubt either itspower or its association with Jewish religion. Rabbi Aqiva ben Yosefis in debate with Tinneius Rufus concerning the sanctity of the Sab-bath; he proves his case by three examples—the River Sambatonwhich ceases churning on the Sabbath, the way a skull used for con-juring behaves on the Sabbath, and by the fact that Tinneius Rufus’father’s grave does not smoke with the fires of Hell on that day(Sanhedrin 65b). All three proofs are equally valid—from Jewish tra-dition, from prohibited magic, and from Jewish folk lore about Hell.The rabbinic magic derived from observing the Torah is justified byan appeal to the River Sambaton. Yet that appeal is bolstered byreference of conjuring and to consulting the dead. These last twopractices were eschewed by the rabbis, but they still needed to showthat their powers not only equaled but surpassed those of paganconjurers and necromancers. The rabbis had two very different tasksbefore them—they needed to prove their prowess in magic whilenonetheless justifying their claims to be normative and “orthodox.”Aqiva and MagicThroughout this discussion, Rabbi Aqiva seems to take pride of place.He notes the various techniques magicians have to use and wondersthat one would go through all this just to consult an impure spirit.How much more, he thinks, would people go through to have re-6Michael D.

Examples of the power from that sourcefollow—rabbis can create an artificial human life, they create a calf toeat, they can conjure wild animals. Yet other examples follow as well,examples from magicians. Practitioners of the forbidden magic per-form similar supernatural actions. The proximity of examples of for-bidden magic and the capability of the rabbis underlines the commonpower that both share. While, of course, the rabbis understand them-selves as guardians of the tradition, and therefore cannot, by defini-tion, be magicians, their self-justification is meant to convince theskeptical, not just to convince themselves. The rabbis are in dialoguewith non-Jewish Roman leaders and with Hellenized Jews. Self-serv-ing as their discussion of magic might be, it is not self-evident. Howthey choose to justify their practices reflects their own self-image.Rabbinic discussions do not settle on any single line of defense. Alater discussion (Sanhedrin 67a-68a) seeks to define exactly what con-stitutes witchcraft and magic and what does not. A distinction is madebetween those who merely provide the illusion of sorcery and thosewho actually perform it. Again, Rabbi Aqiva provides a striking ex-ample of this. He raises the case of two men both of whom appear tobe gathering cucumbers by magic. He then claims that the one whoreally gathers them is guilty. The one who makes an illusion and onlyappears to be gathering them is exempt from the penalties. Thatexample seems to imply that “magic” works while “illusion” is per-missible. In fact, other scholars also augment this argument. They tellof how rabbis punished Jews who treated them with disrespect bychanging their appearance. One woman, for example, was forced tobear the shape of a donkey until the rabbinic spell wore off. Yet otherexamples suggest that even a ritual that “works” need not be consid-ered “magic” if it is carried out for the right reasons. The Talmudadvances the argument of the fourth century Babylonian sage Abayewho compared the laws of sorcery to those of the Sabbath. Just assome sabbatical prohibitions come with specific punishments assignedto them and others while forbidden are not punished, and still othersare not even forbidden, so it is with magic. Some types of magic, heclaims, are clearly proscribed. Others, however, are just as clearlypermitted.. As an example of sorcery that is not forbidden, Abayerefers to a case in which two rabbis created a calf so they could havea Sabbath feast. Here there is no question that the magic was onlyillusion. The rabbis enjoyed the products of their magical perform-ance to enhance the holiday observance. What is at stake in makingthe act forbidden or permitted seems to be not whether actual resultsoccur, but whether the intention is for the sake of a divine command-ment or not. Pursuing what might appear to be magic as a means to"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"  ,   fulfilling God’s injunction to honor the Sabbath falls under thoseactivities which are not proscribed.That case suggests three important points. The first is that magicderives from a true knowledge, a knowledge that is not merely super-stition and illusion. The second is that the knowledge is not alien toJudaism. It is close to Jewish teachings and related to them. Finally, itsuggests that what is at stake in magic is a misuse of an appropriatepower. The intention of the act rather than the act itself is whatcounts. Rabbi Aqiva alludes to these two points when he justifiesgiving the death penalty for the practice of magic. Aqiva is wellknown for opposing capital punishment. When the rabbis discussedwhat constituted a “blood thirsty” court with some saying one thatissues an execution once in seven years and another saying one thatissues one once in seventy years, he joined Rabbi Tarfon in claimingthat “If we were members of the Sanhedrin no man would ever beexecuted” (Makkot 7a). Yet, in this case he supports the use of thedeath penalty. Why should he?Aqiva supports his contention by means of a biblical verse, Exodus19:12-13: “Any who touch the mountain shall be put to death. Nohand shall touch them, but they shall be stoned or shot with arrows.”According to Aqiva the penalty for touching the mountain is thesame as the penalty for practicing magic. In both cases a personunprepared for the influx of divine power takes hold of somethingthat ultimately destroys him. Magic, on this reading, entails an asser-tion of power without the preliminary restraints required to neutralizeits destructive force. Of course magic has power, of course Jews haveaccess to that power, but to intend to wrest that power from itsprotective limits, to overstep the boundaries separating it from dailylife, shows a lack of understanding of the very nature of human weak-ness. Death flows from the misappropriation of power not becausethe rabbis impose a death-penalty, but because the power itself isdangerous.Emannuel Levinas discusses this argument and suggests that Aqivais making another point about magic as well as about its inherentlydestructive power. Levinas suggests that what Aqiva has in mind is acomparison between the lack of preparation which would have leftthe Israelites dead at Sinai to the lack of intellectual probity in themagician which leaves him as good as dead. The death-penalty is notjust for the use of magic. It is for the use of magic by someone whoshould know better! Levinas comments that this is to show that sor-cery is not “a pagan perversion. It is a perversion of the holy peopleitself.” Magic is the misuse of that knowledge which is distinctivelyJudaic and “which tempts from the very depths of the truth, a Jewish"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"  ‒ perversion...”7 Aqiva does not believe that magic lies outside of theJudaic framework. It has its origin within Judaism itself. It representsa particular distortion of what is truly and most distinctively Judaic.Studying how Aqiva understands the distinctiveness of Judaic magicalso reveals his view of the distinctiveness of Jewish prayer.His view is not merely that magic is effective and illusion is not. Heoften concedes, with Abaye, that an effective incantation may, in fact,be acceptable. When Aqiva speaks of magic he often emphasizes itssecrecy rather than its efficacy. Use of supernatural powers, if carriedout for the public purpose of learning and studying is not “magic.”His example of someone who gathers cucumbers illustrates this point.One might think that any occasion on which anyone practices such aspell would constitute performing a forbidden activity. Creating anddestroying cucumbers is a far cry from effecting an illusion of makinga woman look like a donkey! Aqiva, himself, however, actually par-ticipated in such an event. The Talmud tells how he learned thetechnique of creating and destroying cucumbers as part of his studieswith Rabbi Eliezer the Great. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus com-plained that none of his disciples learned everything he could teach.He attests, in this complaint, that only Aqiva was able to learn fromhim the magical words for creating and destroying cucumbers. Aqivais said to have been passing through a field with Rabbi Eliezer andasked him about the incantation. The rabbi taught him the power ofcausing cucumbers to sprout up in a field. Aqiva then demanded thespell to cause them to wither and die and proceeded to learn it.Aqiva’s actions, cannot, by definition, be considered “magic,”since he is an established hero of the tradition. How can the tradition,however, explain his actions? Several possible reasons present them-selves, but the simplest one focuses on Aqiva’s intention. He learnedthe skill so as to be able to teach it to others. He learned this magic asa form of knowledge. To learn it as part of a public curriculum ofeducation is permitted; to use it as part of a secret and exclusivehorde of special talent is forbidden. Aqiva is indeed possessed of theknowledge of sorcery and witchcraft. He does, indeed, surrender tothe temptation for knowledge of which he speaks. Yet his knowledgeis of the “pure” spirit rather than the “impure” because he shares it,because it is broadcast abroad for all to learn. Does this mean thatAqiva “really” would never whisper an incantation, that no magicianever performed actions by the light of day, that the distinction be-7Emmanuel Levinas, “Desacralization and Disenchantment,” in his Nine Tal-mudic Readings.

Probably not. The text introduces this theme to point toa general lesson. It celebrates the public practice of supernatural skillsas a way of emphasizing the civil importance, the social location, ofthe rabbinic leader. This emphasis on civil visibility, however, is animportant value that reveals a significant aspect of rabbinic self-un-derstanding.This principle of public dissemination of knowledge runs like acentral theme in Aqiva’s teachings. He claims that among those ex-cluded from the World to Come are those who whisper Exodus 15:16(God’s promise that Jews will not suffer the diseases of Egypt) over awound (Sanhedrin 10.1). Again, Aqiva himself may well have quietlychanted this incantation. The point is not so much whether “magi-cians” really whisper and non-magicians really speak aloud. Thepoint of the story is whether a leader seeks to keep skills within aselect circle of adapts or rather works to make it common knowledge.No one disputes that Exodus 15:16 has the power to heal wounds.That this powerful incantation should be kept as part of a secretknowledge is something that the tradition contends Aqiva sought toend. This commitment to making the secret public manifests itself inother stories about Aqiva. He objects to those who would keep knowl-edge covered. Several stories tell of him revealing things that theTorah sees fit to hide—that Zelophad was the sinner in the wilder-ness, that Aaron was another unnamed sinner, and the Bilaam isnone oher than the Elihu of Job (Shabbat 97a and Jerusalem TalmudSota 5). In these cases, Aqiva is clearly a champion of the publicdeclaration of knowledge. That seems to be the contrast he drawsbetween magic and normative Jewish practice. Whereas magic iswhispered and clandestine, Judaism reveals the hidden and unmasksthe concealed. Aqiva distinguishes magic and religion by emphasizingthe public nature of the latter.Evidence From Aqiva’s MartyrdomThe centrality of Aqiva in this discussion of magic is no mere coinci-dence. He gives his name to the entire period in which he lived.Judah Nadich’s study of Tinneius Rufus and the Jews under Romanrule is not unusual to take as its title “Rabbi Akiva and His Contem-poraries,” and to give the story of Aqiva pride of place in his investi-gation.8 In rabbinic and medieval documents, Aqiva dominates8See as representative studies in English and Judah Nadich, Rabbi Akiba and HisContemporaries (Northvale: Jason Aronson, 1998), 1-111."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"  ‒ Jewish thinking. Louis Finkelstein, whose monograph on Aqiva haslong been a classic, places the sage in company of Moses, Isaiah,Maimonides, and Spinoza. He argues that Aqiva “dominates thewhole scene of Jewish history for eighteen centuries” and continues tohave enduring relevance.9 Not only the story of his death (in 132, andmost probably connected with the Bar Kochba rebellion that eruptedin that year ), but legends of miracles after it augment Aqiva’s stature.After his death, according to Midrash Proverbs 9, Elijah the prophetannounced his death to Rabbi Joshua ha-Garsi. He conducted therabbi to Aqiva’s prison cell, lifted up the body and gave it to therabbi. Rabbi Joshua was skeptical. Elijah, as a priest, would become“unclean” by touching such a body. He voiced his concerns to Elijahwho replied “there is no ritual impurity attached to the righteous.”Aqiva’s sanctity overrides the general prohibitions given for priestlypurity. His story provides an ideal of holiness for all who follow. EvenElijah cannot be polluted by the dead body of Aqiva. Thus Aqiva’sprestige lends an important legitimation to any Judaic endeavor. Notsurprisingly, then, many early mystical texts portray themselves aswritten by Aqiva. He speaks in the first person singular in this texts,performs wonders, and reveals secrets of magical import.10 Aqiva themagician legitimates later Jewish magic users by the stature of hisreputation.This special status of Aqiva draws strength from, but also rein-forces, his importance as a hero in Jewish martyrology. Aqiva, ac-cording to tradition, came to a terrible end at the hands of TinneiusRufus during a time when the Romans proscribed the study of theTorah and its commentaries (as noted above, many scholars see aconnection between Aqiva’s death, Rufus’ actions, and the BarKochba rebellion against Hadrian). The tale of this martyrdom hasbeen reported in several variants. Most versions attribute to him aprotest against the Romans and portray a final confrontation with histormentors. Yet these versions, despite containing similar elements,differ dramatically in their portrait of Aqiva as a rabbi and as amagician. The various themes about Aqiva’s approach to magic andto Judaism as public knowledge combine in these stories about hisdeath at the hands of the Romans.Many scholars note that this story in its different variations repre-sents an attempt to grapple with theodicy, with the suffering that9Louis Finkelstein, Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr (Philadelphia: Jewish Publica-tion Society of America, 1936) , 1.10.

Aqiva’sexchange with Rufus represents a “plausible sequence of events andmotivations” as a “flagrant act of resistance to the pagan authorities.”Viewing the different versions from this perspective, Fishbane canargue that those variants emphasizing a devotion and cleaving toGod as an act of “theurgical” perfection are only of a later deriva-tion.12 Whether or not this judgment of the history of the textualtradition holds true, the different variants deserve to be read togetheras a complex whole. Certainly the version of Aqiva’s death in theJerusalem Talmud has striking elements that do not occur in otherversions (including what is crucial here, a reference to Aqiva as amagician). Yet the rabbinic claim that Aqiva is not a magician re-quires a study of all the variants and their inner connection to oneanother. This analysis does not seek to show what Aqiva really said orif he actually practiced “magic.” Instead, it looks at the picture pro-vided by the rabbis through a variety of versions of Aqiva’s martyr-dom and elicits from them a rabbinic judgment on what constitutesand does not constitute magic.The story given in the Jerusalem Talmud raises several significantissues. It provides an important insight into the place of magic in thetales about Aqiva, weaving together the strands already noted. Threethemes predominate: the public setting of the event, the charge thatAqiva is a magician, and the psychological response Aqiva providesjustifying his actions. Each of these illuminates Aqiva’s view aboutmagic The setting for the discussion of Aqiva the magician in theJerusalem Talmud is a dialogue between the Jewish leader and theRoman who persecutes him. Aqiva, condemned as a Jewish rebel, an11See the discussions in Herbert Basser, In the Margins of the Midrash: Sifre Ha’azinuTexts, Commentaries, and Reflections (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990), 52; Daniel Boyarin,Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990),117-129; Michael Fishbane, The Kiss of God: Spiritual and Mystical Death in Judaism, TheSamuel and Althea Stroum Lectures in Jewish Studies.

Baer Jubilee Volume on theOccasion of His Seventieth Birthday ( Jerusalem: The Israeli Historical Society, 1960), 48-68. Strangely enough, Steven D. Fraade relegates this discussion to a footnote con-cerning “Israel’s Sufferings” and does not introduce either Aqiva’s interpretation ofthe ema even when presenting the Sifre’s interpretation of Deuteronomy 6:4-7. Seehis From Tradition to Commentary: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuter-onomy (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991), 91, 213, 240, 241, 242.12Fishbane, Kiss of God, 68 82."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"  ‒ adversary of Roman rule in Judea, is taken before Rufus who watcheshim being tortured to death. The time for the recitation of the emaarrives and Aqiva recites the prayer and smiles. Rufus looks at him inwonder and asks, “Are you a magician or are you insensitive to painthat you smile during this torture?” The context of the dialogue isthat of a public discourse, of a debate between two thinkers in anopen spirit of inquiry.A second significant, but usually obscured aspect of the story, is theaccusation that Aqiva is a magician. Not only did Jewish traditionreject magic, but the Romans as well delegated “theurgy” to danger-ous and forbidden cults. Historically, Rufus might well have sus-pected something subversive in the rituals of the Jews. Rome oftenfound much to worry about in cultic behavior that it could not con-trol. Perhaps the messianic claims raised about Bar Kochba and hissupernatural abilities led the Roman leader to suspect magical arts atplay. Fishbane may be right that the charge of magical practice rep-resents a historically plausible basis for Rufus’ persecution of Aqiva.The Jerusalem Talmud, however, does not see its purpose as that ofrefuting the Roman charge concerning Jewish messianic magic. In-stead, the passage seems focused on demystifying liturgical claimsconcerning the power and effect of Jewish worship. The narrativewants to justify those claims while proving that they are not “magic”even though the effects they promise may appear “magical.” TheTalmud does not deny that Jews in general and rabbis in particulardo practice occult arts. Are these really magical acts? Can Jews per-form them without abandoning their commitment to the God whomthey profess? The author may well have used the charge againstAqiva as an opportunity to explore the difference between the occultpowers achieved through the study of Torah and those gainedthrough some other means. The tale of martyrdom becomes an ob-ject lesson on how Judaic magic may be used for licit purposes andthus go beyond the prohibition against the employment of magic.The final striking element in the Jerusalem Talmud’s tale lies inAqiva’s response. He provides a naturalistic explanation for his joy.According to the text, after Rufus’ query, Aqiva points to himself andsays “this person is granted a special pleasure,” and explains thatwhenever he had previously read the verse requiring self-sacrifice forthe sake of God, he had been saddened at the thought that he couldnot fulfil it. Now that the time for self-sacrifice and the time forreciting that verse coincided, he no longer felt the disturbance he hadbefore. That explanation concludes the debate. Aqiva has provided apsychological justification for his act. He is not a magician but rather"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"  ,   he is a human being who has sublimated his physical needs to hisspiritual ones. The act associated with the occult arts is, rather, anormal Jewish liturgical practice which indicates loyalty to the tradi-tion rather than some special occult ability.The text then concludes by noting that as soon as Aqiva finishedmaking his statement he gave up his soul in death.13 That phraseechoes stories about the death of Moses, also seen to have voluntarilygiven up life at God’s command. That note suggests that Aqiva’sdeath was as special as his life. Although apparently martyred by theRomans, he in fact, offers his life of his own free will to God. For suchan act he receives a supernal reward, dying by a kiss of God. WhileAqiva’s mundane happiness comes out of liturgical obedience, thereward for the happiness is eternal bliss. This conjunction of liturgicalpleasure and ultimate heavenly felicity suggests a reciprocal relation-ship between the two. The earthly joy of fulfilling the commandmentsprovides a foretaste of the sublime and eternal joy of paradise.The Charge that Aqiva is a MagicianAqiva’s association with magic cannot be denied. Several later magi-cal texts claim to derive from him, the most famous being “TheAlphabet of Rabbi Aqiva,” and the magical “Havdalah of RabbiAqiva,” mentioned by Gershom Scholem. Scholem also notes themagical elements included in “The Lesser Hekhalot,” texts reportingtravels in paradise but also associating several magical formulae withRabbi Aqiva.14 The contention that Aqiva practices supernatural artsmust be taken seriously. Even in its choice of words, the JerusalemTalmud’s account makes the charge a serious one. The word used formagician in most printed texts is the normal Hebrew word found, forexample, in Deuteronomy 18.10 (No one shall be found among you...who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a magi-cian), mekhaef. This is a central text for the discussion of magic in laterrabbinic writing. It is, for example, in connection with this verse thatthe Sifre that Aqiva’s tale about gathering cucumbers is originally told.It is also in conjunction with this verse that Aqiva’s stance concerningillusions not being proscribed is challenged by the sages (a term usuallyreferring to the consensus of rabbinic leaders) who identify the illu-13Jerusalem Talmud Berachot 9:14b14Scholem, Gnosticism, 68, 77."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"  ‒ sionist with the “soothsayer.”15 What does this term mean?Sanhedrin 67b reports in the name of Rabbi Yohanan that it means“one who reduces the power of the divine.” Commentators have triedto figure out how Rabbi Yohanan came to this conclusion. Theyargue that the magician seeks to control God. By so doing they areclaiming that human beings have power over the divine. They arethus reducing the amount of sovereignty attributed to the divinity. Ifthis is the meaning of the charge, then it hardly applies to Aqiva sincehis declaration of faith in the divine is precisely an affirmation ofGod’s power.In the earliest manuscripts of the Jerusalem Talmud, however, theword used by Rufus is a rarer term ̇eres<, found in Onkelos, theAramaic translation, for Deuteronomy 18.10 (who practices divina-tion, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a user of secret spells) andapparently also related to Isaiah 3:3 where among the leaders uponwhom all depend are “the wisest of the ̇aras<im and the cunningwhisperers (magicians?).” The usual interpretation is that of someonewho offers incantations secretly. Aqiva in the eyes of the rabbinicauthor might not have fallen into the trap of reducing divine power,but might have fallen prey to the temptation to retain an elitist holdon his knowledge. The term used ostensibly by Rufus indicates a typeof secret knowledge, a whispered truth that is not available to every-one. The contrast between magic which is secretive and Judaismwhich is open explains the choice of a word which, while used inAramaic for magician, also has a Hebrew association with mumbledincantations. Aqiva is charged not with violating Jewish theologicalvalues but with contradicting his own principle—that of public dis-semination of knowledge. The danger that Aqiva poses to Judaism isnot that of attempting to coerce the deity or to pretend that humanbeings can influence the divine plan. Rather the problem of magic forthe Jews is just the one that Aqiva proposed as most pernicious, thatof keeping certain information secret as a source of private power.15. Sifre Deuteronomy, Pisqa171; see in English, Reuven Hammer, Sifre: A TannaiticCommentary on the Book of Deuteronomy (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), 199-200, and Jacob Neusner, Sifre to Deuteronomy: An Analytic Translation. Volume 2 (At-lanta, BA: Scholars Press, 1987), 46-48. Neusner’s presentation raises an interestingpoint. He separates the first and last part of the statement so that Aqiva only claimsthat “Two may collect cucumbers, one of whom is liable and the other of whom isexempt.” The statement that the difference is that one creates an illusion and theother doesn’t appears as a later expansion. Tempting as that separation might be, thefact that Aqiva disputes the other sages about the status of the illusionist as “sooth-sayer” leads me to think that the second part of the claim also belongs to him."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"  ,   The text answers this charge by emphasizing the public, liturgicalnature of what was performed. Aqiva does not whisper some secretformula. Instead he declares the most public proclamation in theJewish liturgy, the s<ema. The liturgical nature of his utterance hascrucial importance. Aqiva is reported as saying that one knowswhether someone for whom you pray will improve or not by whetherthe words come easily or only with difficulty. Liturgy does have aneffect on the world. One can indeed determine the course of eventsby the way the liturgy proceeds. But it is precisely the use of predeter-mined and public utterances that make this ability to forecast thefuture possible (Tosefta Berakhot 3:3). He makes a similar case in hisargument with Rabbi Ishmael on the significance of the priestly ben-ediction, the blessing described in Numbers 6:22-27, in which thepriests place God’s name on the people after which God blesses them.Aqiva insisted that the priests make the blessing, and that the divinityis forced to agree (Óullin 49a). Again human speech influences divineaction. Liturgical pronouncements do indeed seem to change thestate of things in the world. For Aqiva the question, however, is notthat of forcing the divine hand. It is rather whether or not the act ispublic or secret. Because his action in the martydom scene involvesthe recitation of a liturgical pronouncement it cannot be confusedwith the whispered secrets of magic.The Public Nature of Aqiva’s PronouncementsA second contributing aspect of the story in the Jerusalem Talmudlies in its public, civil setting of the event. Several talmudic storiesrecount the interaction of Rufus and Aqiva.16 In fact, several of thesealso occur in the context of the tractate Sanhedrin in which thediscussion of magic appears. To understand why Rufus is the pro-tagonist here requires more than knowing his association with theRoman domination of Judea. Aqiva is doing more than just flagrantlyinterrupting a Roman judicial proceeding. He is carrying on a dia-logue with the Roman official. The significance of this fact, of Aqiva’sposition as instructor to the Gentiles, becomes clear only when takenin relationship to the other stories about similar dialogues. Whatpoint does the author make about both martyrdom and the universalimplication of Judaic teachings by evoking Aqiva’s relationship withthis Roman leader?16See, for example, the stories reported in Nadich, Rabbi Akiba, 39-41, 100-104."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"  ‒ Rufus is continually portrayed as having a knowledge of Jewishtexts combined with a skepticism about their value. These questionsmay, as Richard Rubenstein has pointed out, reflect religious ques-tions that the rabbis themselves felt. Rubenstein suggests that “Be-cause of the perilous condition of the Jewish community after itsdefeat by Rome in 132-35, it was impossible for responsible leadersopenly to express religious reservations in their own name.” He con-tinues, however, that they could express them “by placing them in themouths of sinners.”17 Aqiva replies in such a way that Jews can recon-cile themselves to doubts that they might never voice aloud. In onecase (Baba Batra 10a), Rufus wonders if God can really “love thepoor.” If that is so, why should the poor suffer? Aqiva explains thatthe conditions of the poor provide an opportunity for Jews to escapethe punishments of Hell. By aiding the impoverished, Jews earnthemselves credit with God. Rufus objects, contending that since Godimposed suffering on these people they must deserve it. If they de-serve it, then it must anger God that others have ameliorated thiscondition. Aqiva replies that God’s love of humanity is like a king’slove for his children and that a king will reward those who help aprince, even if he is in disgrace. Rufus reacts by claiming that, “Whenyou do God’s will you are God’s children but if not you are God’sservants.” That idea is one found not only on the lips of this Romanbut from rabbinic masters as well. Aqiva’s final remark both confirmsand rejects Rufus’ view: Yes, Jews are not now doing God’s will, butthat will is precisely to help the poor and needy. Here Aqiva turns theargument against helping the poor into its opposite—an injunction tohelp them.A similar debate focuses on the Jewish practice of circumcision(Tanhuma Tazria 4-5). Rufus wonders whether human or divine ac-tions are more attractive. Aqiva sagely answers that human deeds are.Bread, for example, is more attractive and edible than wheat as itgrows in the field. Nature needs human improvement to be useful. Inthis way, Aqiva can claim that circumcision is a necessary improve-ment on nature. The illustration continues, however, with Aqiva not-ing that everyone agrees that a newborn’s umbilical cord must be cutupon birth. Not only circumcision, but ordinary birthing transformsnature for the sake of human existence. Aqiva concludes by suggest-ing that circumcision, which after all is one step beyond that of cut-ting the umbilical cord, is given for the special refinement of the17Richard L. Rubenstein, The Religious Imagination: A Study in Psychoanalysis andJewish Theology (Boston: Beacon, 1968), 30-31."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"  ,   Jewish people. Here again a doubt that could grow within Jewishminds appears as a statement from the “wicked” Rufus. Again Aqivagives a response that is not really aimed at non-Jews but at the Jewsthemselves.This public context of Aqiva’s debate on martyrdom reflects atransition occurring within Jewish practice. The stories reflect a timewhen the idea of sanctifying God’s name had changed from being ageneral exaltation of the divine through following Jewish laws to be-ing a specific act of self-sacrifice for the sake of those laws. The idealof martyrdom is found in several early texts, but the model of theHasmonean period sought to circumscribe that ideal. For theHasmoneans, martyrs refuse to violate their religious commitments,defy the oppressors, and then are put to death. Martyrdom is theconsequence of an activist stance against what is perceived as abusivepolitical power. The period in which the Aqiva stories developed sawan active seeking of martyrdom as a type of spiritual fulfillment. Tobecome a martyr was to realize a religious ideal.18 Many who stillretained the older paradigm would question such an exaltation ofmartyrdom. The use of liturgy to induce a state of transcendent ec-stasy seemed magical and illegitimate. Rufus once again articulates adoubt that many Jews could share. He wonders whether these heroicmartyrs are really exponents of an authentic Judaism or whether theypractice some alien type of sorcery. Aqiva’s emphasis on the liturgicalformula which legitimates active martyrdom answers that doubt. Notonly political or historical necessity create the conditions under whichone becomes a martyr. Twice each day this ideal of dying for the sakeof God takes shape in Jewish prayer. Martyrdom, despite the doubtsplaced in the mouth of the sinner Rufus, has a legitimate and authen-tic place within Jewish life and thought by virtue of its presence as analways possible alternative in liturgical recitations.The significance of this liturgical lesson within the context of pub-lic debate needs comment. In other versions of the Aqiva lesson hisstudents ask him why he smiles, and his exegesis is meant for a smallbody of elite initiates. The Jerusalem Talmud’s version, however,suggests that Aqiva’s liturgical lesson is meant for all human beings.The psychology involved applies not just to Jews but to all people. Tolove God fully with one’s heart, and mind, and life enables any per-son to rise above the trials and torments of human suffering. Againand again in the dialogues with Rufus, Aqiva resorts to universalexamples, to analogies that anyone can understand. The difference18See Boyarin, Intertextuality, 126 and Fishbane, Kiss of God, 60."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"  ‒ between magic and liturgy is nowhere clearer than in Aqiva’s confi-dence that Rufus can comprehend the explanation that he gives. Anyperson who recognizes the relationship between loyalty to an obliga-tion and the joy of fulfilling it can understand the power that gaveAqiva the ability to laugh in the face of torture. The s<ema may be aparticularistic Jewish prayer. Its liturgical power to lead people to atranscendence of ordinary and even extraordinary disaster and suffer-ing is universal. Jewish practice of this liturgy points the way forothers, for non-Jews, to understand the significance of ritual, of loy-alty, and of the benefits that come from fulfilling one’s obligations.Aqiva and the Rewards of Martyrdom and Liturgical RecitationsThe mention of benefits from liturgical performance suggests an im-portant dimension lacking in this version of the Aqiva myth. Otherversions include either a heavenly voice or the divine itself declaringthat through his suffering Aqiva becomes worthy of everlasting life, ofentrance into the world to come. In contrast to this other-worldlyemphasis, the Jerusalem Talmud stresses the joy that Aqiva experi-ences here and now. He gladly gives up his life because by so doinghe experiences an intense pleasure; he does not deny himself earthlyjoy but rather heightens his enjoyment through engendering an ec-static feeling. This attribution of mundane happiness to Aqiva repre-sents a significant variation on the usual ways rabbinic literaturepresents him. One only needs to look at other stories about Aqiva torealize how extraordinary this attribution is. Aqiva is traditionallyassociated with rabbinic narratives of ascent to heaven. In one of themost widely cited passages, four sages ascend into the divine palacesand only Aqiva enters and leaves in peace (Hagiga 14b). That anec-dote won for Aqiva a high place in Jewish mystical thinking, espe-cially concerning ascent to heaven. Several texts claim to describerabbinic heroes who visit the heavenly palaces. These heroes negoti-ate difficult passage through the upper realms of God’s chambers.Joseph Dan suggests that the original hero in all such tales was Aqiva.Only later were the names of other rabbis added to the illustrious listof those who could ascend.19 Yet despite this association with heav-enly ascent, entrance into the divine realm plays no role in the Jeru-salem Talmud’s version of Aqiva’s death. The reluctance to mentionsuch ascent may have to do with the esoteric liturgical knowledge19Joseph Dan, On Sanctity: Religion, Ethics and Mysticism in Judaism and Other Religions[Hebrew] ( Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1997), 191."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"  ,   associated with the literature concerning visits to the heavenly realms.Gershom Scholem points out that an important aspect of such visitsincluded listening to the liturgy of the angels. Prayers very similar tothose used in the traditional liturgy are revealed as the special prop-erty of the divine court. In some of the accounts the mysterioushymns are placed in the mouth of none other than Aqiva. He be-comes the vehicle by which a secret ritual is transmitted from theheavenly realm to the earthly realm.20That is what this text from the Jerusalem Talmud denies. Aqiva isgiving an object lesson on how ascent to God comes through thepublic performance of a generally human act—the act of love. Notonly were heavenly ascents associated with Aqiva, but also an exalta-tion of the biblical book Song of Songs. That book is an explicitcelebration of sexual eros. It portrays male and female sexuality viv-idly and positively. Naturally, some authorities sought to repress itand control its erotic power. It is said that when Song of Songs wasabout to be excluded from the biblical canon, Aqiva defended it. Hisallegorical interpretation of it linked his name with its sanctity inJewish thought.21 Aqiva honored and respected love. Even sexualitywas honored. It is told that he inherited a teaching whispered to himby his teacher, Nahum of Gamzu, that one who has had a seminalemission and had only nine kabs of water sprinkled on him is consid-ered purified. Why was this transmitted in a whisper? Different rea-sons are suggested. One is that Aqiva wanted to respect both the idealof procreation and that of Torah study. The point, however, is notthe whisper but the transmission of the teaching. Sexual activity is notas seriously polluting as some might think. Aqiva seeks to elevate erosand love, to give it an exalted place in human affairs. Thus he sup-ports the canonization of the Song of Songs.Yet for Aqiva the Song of Songs is more than just a public celebra-tion of sexuality. He interprets the work allegorically as a dialoguebetween the Nations of the World and Israel. Israel teaches all theworld how to love God through the lessons conveyed in this work. AsJudah Goldin says, “Face to face with the Nations of the World,Aqiba teaches Israel what he knows about love, and insists that to beunited with the God of Israel, the Nations must love Him as Israel20Scholem, Gnosticism, 28.21Ibid., 83ff.; see also Judah Goldin, “Toward a Profile of the Tanna, Aqiba benJoseph,” in his Studies in Midrash and Related Literature, Barry L. Eichler and Jeffrey H.Tigay, eds. (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1988), 299-323."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"  ‒ loves Him, Him only.”22 The task of the Jew is to convince the entireworld of the meaning of true love. That is the superlative purpose ofJewish existence. If that is the case, what greater lesson can there bethan that the reward of loving God comes in the here and now. Aqivain the Jerusalem Talmud’s version does not escape from this worldinto the next because such escapism is not love but only evasion.According to Judah Goldin, Aqiva’s view derives from his convictionthat true love must be steadfast, loyal, and never changing. Such alove is tried and tested in the experiences of life, not in a spiritualrealm of perfection.23 The public witness of Aqiva’s death shows whatsuch love means when applied to a divine being. No human situationcan dissuade Aqiva from obedience to God because his love is unwa-vering. Again the public situation is important, but this time as alesson about what love of God entails—not a hope for some delayedreward but a passion that makes everything else in life irrelevant andunimportant.Aqiva’s loving surrender of his life becomes one more liturgicalalternative to magic. While magic seeks to evade and escape theconditions of existence, liturgy, in this view, accepts and affirms them.Magic, some say, arises because people are continually confrontedwith sickness, death, and suffering. They turn to magic as a solutionto the insoluble perplexities of life.24 They seek a secret remedy whena legitimate public means fail them. Aqiva’s death narrative rejectssuch evasive maneuvers as unnecessary. Even death may be a rewardfor love; pain and suffering need not be countered but rather ac-cepted as the means to an even greater pleasure and happiness. Love,Aqiva would claim, recognizes the higher pleasures that ordinarydisappointments and failures may bring in their wake. In the case ofmartyrdom, death is characterized as one received by a kiss fromGod; it brings with it an ecstasy that makes all other pleasures pale incomparison. This metaphor of death by a divine kiss becomes thedominant image that expresses entering into the divine kingdomthrough God’s kiss. This motif, central to Michael Fishbane’s book onthe subject, is linked in this story with his recitation of the Jewishproclamation of God’s oneness, the s<ema. The linking of Aqiva withboth ascents into the heavenly realm and with the liturgies associatedwith that realm is an important one in Jewish literature. The story22Goldin, “Aqiba ben Joseph,” 323.23Ibid., 309-318.24See Judah Goldin, “The Magic of Magic and Superstition,”in his Studies inMidrash and Related Literature, 337-357."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"  ,   about the s<ema and its relationship to Aqiva’s translation from lifeinto the divine kingdom represents a significant variation on thetheme of visiting God’s palaces. Yet this version of Aqiva’s storytransforms the motif of ascent into an illustration of a this-worldlylove, as the culmination of a dialogue with the Nations that teachesthem how to love God truly.ConclusionsWhat does the Jerusalem Talmud teach about magic through its nar-rative of the death of Aqiva? First, it teaches that magic is a processand attitude, not any particular action. What Aqiva achieves resem-bles indeed what any magician could attain—or at least what anyGod-fearing Jewish magician could perform. Withstanding pain andtranscending unbearable circumstances might well be the result ofmagic as well as of liturgy. Secondly, however, it claims that thedifference between magic and liturgy lies not in what it accomplishesbut in its public display. If something is done so all can hear and seeit, then it cannot, by definition, be magic. Finally, it claims that magicis antithetical to Judaism, not because it seeks to coerce the divine norbecause it impairs monotheism in some theoretical way, but becausethe Jewish mission is precisely that of public proclamation.William James wrote that the function of reason is to “redeemreligion from unwholesome privacy,” and such indeed seems to bethe stance of the Jerusalem Talmud in its telling of the story ofAqiva’s death.25 The redemption, however, is not of religion by rea-son, but rather the redemption of “magic” by the public display ofreligion. Religion and magic share many of the same aims and con-cerns. They seek to show a similar transcendence to the pain andsuffering of life. They do so, however, in contrasting ways. Magicoffers a private, secret knowledge, a whispered spell that only theinitiates can know. Religion in contrast stands open to the light ofday. It speaks its liturgy out loud so all can hear. If the public is aredemption of the private, then religion in this context is understoodas a redemption of magic.Whether or not the rabbis were correct in their implication thatAqiva’s magic contrasted with that of other magicians, their positionis an important one. Rabbinic self-understanding emphasized thevalue of public accessibility. Rabbis, like any other elite leadership25William James, The Variety of Religious Experience (New York: Longmans, Green,and Company, 1914), 423"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"  ‒ group, inevitably formed a small, tightly guarded fraternity. The idealof public dissemination of skills and rituals remained honored more inthe breach than in the practice. The fact of this elitism, however,should not distract from the significance of this position as an ideo-logical one. To choose publicity as the key to distinguishing ritualfrom magic means to make an explicit decision concerning the natureof leadership and its authority. By pointing up that decision, thediscussion of Rabbi Aqiva as a putative magician reveals a distin-guishing characteristic of rabbinic ideology."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"SHAMANIC INITIATORY DEATH ANDRESURRECTION IN THE HEKHALOT LITERATUREJames R. Davila1. Shamanic Initiatory TransformationsI have argued elsewhere that the most useful paradigm for under-standing the strange collection of visionary and revelatory textsknown as the hekhalot literature is an anthropological one.1 The “de-scenders to the chariot,” as they sometimes called themselves, can beunderstood as a type of shaman, that is, “a social functionary who,with the help of guardian spirits, attains ecstasy in order to create arapport with the supernatural world on behalf of his group mem-bers,” to quote Åke Hultkrantz’s definition.2 This paper explores oneaspect of the shamanic vocation of the descenders to the chariot: theinitiatory disintegration and reintegration that establishes the sha-man’s supernatural power.The shaman has a direct link with the supernatural world, but thislink is not forged without difficulty or pain; the shamanic vocationoften brings great suffering into the lives of those who pursue it. It ischaracteristic of the Arctic shaman (although not unknown in othertraditions) that the initiation into the otherworld is experienced as aviolent upheaval that involves the destruction of the whole person bythe spirits, followed by a kind of resurrection as a new being who is athome both in the mundane and the spiritual world. The initiantseems to endure being eaten alive or otherwise consumed—often thevictim sees the process as though it were happening to someoneelse—until nothing is left but a skeleton. Consciousness is frequentlylost at this point (understandably), but the initiant may watch his or1James R.

In any case,the new shaman will discover that the terrifying personal disintegra-tion has been followed by a reintegration that brings with it powersover the spiritual world.The experience of Autdaruta, a Greenland Inuit shaman who toldhis story to Knud Rassmussen, is fairly typical. In his childhood oryouth, after the death of his father, he received a call from the spiritsand “began to be a magician, but did not speak to any one about it.”The following year, after moving south, he apprenticed himself to avery old master shaman. Autdaruta told Rassmussen:One day he [Autdaruta’s teacher] came and said to me —“Travel east with me, and I will teach you something; you may needhelp yet, you poor fatherless boy.”So we travelled together, and he told me on the way that he was goingto make a great magician of me. We went ashore up a fjord, close to acave, and the old man took off his clothes and crept inside. And he toldme to watch carefully what happened next. I lay hidden a little way offand waited. It was not long before I saw a great bear come swimmingalong, crawl ashore, and approach the magician. It flung itself upon him,crunched him up, limb for limb, and ate him.Then it vomited him out again and swam away.When I went up to the cave, the old man lay groaning. He was verymuch exhausted, but was able to row home himself. On the way back hetold me that every time he allowed himself to be devoured alive by thebear he acquired greater power over his helping spirits.Some time afterwards, he took me on a journey again, and this time itwas so that I myself might be eaten by the bear; this was necessary if Iwished to attain to any good. We rowed off and came to the cave; the oldman told me to take my clothes off, and I do not deny that I was some-what uncomfortable at the thought of being devoured alive.I had not been lying there long before I heard the bear coming. Itattacked me and crunched me up, limb by limb, joint by joint, butstrangely enough it did not hurt at all; it was only when it bit me in theheart that it did hurt frightfully.From that day forth I felt that I ruled my helping-spirits. After that Iacquired many fresh helping-spirits and no danger could any longerthreaten me, as I was always protected.33Joan Halifax, Shamanic Voices: A Survey of Visionary Narratives (New York/London:Arkana/Penguin, 1979) 108-109.

An example from the latter is found in the nar-rative of the Great Vision experienced by the Sioux shaman NickBlack Elk (as told to John G. Neihardt). This experience occurredwhen he was a nine-year-old boy in 1873 or 1874. The details of thevision cannot detain us here, but toward its end Nick was given amagic herb by a black-horned man who underwent various transfor-mations, including one into a skeleton. (Nick had been destined to usethis herb to wreak great destruction on his enemies when he wasthirty-seven years old, but out of compassion for the women andchildren who would suffer, he gave up his vocation instead and con-verted to Catholicism.) At the end of this episode he informs us:During this whole time I did not notice how I was dressed. But now Inoticed that I was painted red and all my joints were black. There was awhite stripe between the joints all over my body. And whenever I wouldbreath (sic), I would be breathing lightning. My bay horse had lightningstripes on it. The horse’s mane was like clouds.54Merkur suggests that this experience of disintegration and reintegration is aform of anxiety attack generated by sensory deprivation (e.g., “kayak-angst” amongthe Inuit), and that perhaps the natural environment in the Arctic and Australia maybe more conducive to sensory deprivation than that normally experienced by NativeAmericans (see Becoming Half Hidden 250-56).Carmen Blacker, following Ichiro Hori, attributes the rareness of this initiatoryexperience in Japan to differences between Arctic hunting culture and Japaneseagricultural society: “The dismemberment and skeleton motifs suggest a hunting,pastoral people. The contrasting elements found in the Japanese tales of the cave, thepassage through a hole down to a subterranean world, betoken a return to the wombof the earth mother goddess characteristic of an agricultural people” (The CatalpaBow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan [2nd ed.; London: Unwin Hyman, 1986]346 n. 13). One difficulty with this thesis is that this experience is also rare amongNative American hunting cultures.If Merkur’s analysis is correct, the descriptions of initiatory disintegration andreintegration associated with the descenders to the chariot may be due to the empha-sis in their ascetic practices on prolonged isolation in surroundings conducive tosensory deprivation.5Raymond J.

I can see thatthere is a special duty for him to do. Just as he came in I could see thepower of lightning all through his body.”6Lakota tradition also suggests a connection between the sweatlodge ceremony and an initiatory death and resurrection. During hisfirst sweat lodge, in preparation for his first vision quest, LeonardCrow Dog, a Native American Sioux shaman, was told, “This steamis the holy breath of the universe. Hokshila, boy, you are in yourmother’s womb again. You are going to be reborn.”7 The myth of theStone Boy, as told to James Walker by two native informants, con-tains a number of episodes in which the dead are raised by beingsubjected to the sweat lodge ceremony.82. Dangerous Encounters with the Divine in the Judaic TraditionIn the Hebrew Bible, as well as in many ancient mythologies, there isa persistent tradition that it is deadly dangerous to have a directencounter with the divine. A typical expression of this sentiment isfound in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, which took place in Solo-mon’s Temple in Jerusalem in the year 742 ... (Isaiah 6). This fearfor one’s life in the presence of God is a well-established theme inbiblical literature.96DeMallie (ed.), The Sixth Grandfather 150; compare Neihardt, Black Elk Speaks 49.Note that Neihardt’s rendition weakens the direct connection between WhirlwindChaser’s statement and Nick’s vision, since it reads “a power like a light” instead of“the power of lightning.”7Halifax, Shamanic Voices 81.8James R.

The instinctive reaction ofSamson’s father, after he and his wife experienced a theophany of the angel ofYHWH heralding the birth of their mighty son, was “We shall surely die, for we haveseen God” ( Judg 13:22). There is also the strange story about Moses, to the effectthat when he came down from Mount Sinai after receiving the second set of tabletsinscribed with the ten commandments, something about the appearance of the skinof his face so terrified the Israelites that he found it necessary to wear a veil (Exod34:29-35). The traditional interpretation of v. 29 is that Moses’ face glowed with anecho of the divine glory. However, William H. Propp has shown that it isphilologically and contextually more likely that the meaning of the verse is thatMoses’ face was scorched, and thus horribly disfigured by the divine radiation (“TheSkin of Moses’ Face—Transfigured or Disfigured?” CBQ 49 (1987) 375-86). Notethat the angels who serve before the throne of God suffer a similar fate (see below)."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"    The fiery, and even radioactive nature of the heavenly world isalso a commonplace in the hekhalot literature. The angels, like Isaiah’sseraphim (“burning ones”), are by nature aflame. The heavenly realmitself is pictured as burning with fire throughout (see, e.g., HekhalotRabbati §101; 3 Enoch 25:1-3 [§39]; Ma'aseh Merkavah §§554-55). Evengiven the flaming nature of the angels, however, they in turn cannotwithstand the direct sight of God. In Isaiah’s vision the seraphimmust cover their faces so as not to look God in the eye. This theme isalso picked up in the hekhalot literature. The attending angels, includ-ing the inconceivably mighty living creatures who form the legs of thethrone of God, must cover their faces to protect themselves from thedivine radiance. Only then is it safe for God to uncover his face(Hekhalot Rabbati §§183-84, 189). Nevertheless, even these precautionsare not always enough. The following passage from the HekhalotRabbati describes the divine glory and the effect it has on those beingsfortunate or unfortunate enough to be exposed to it too directly or fortoo long.(§159) The fine Presence, adorned Presence, Presence of beauty, Presenceof flame, the Presence of YHWH, God of Israel, when He sits enthronedon His throne of glory and His dignity is perfected in the seat of Hisadornment. His beauty is finer than the beauty of the mighty acts of Hisadornment, made to ascend higher than the adornments of bridegroomsand brides in their bridal chamber. He who gazes on Him shall be tornapart at once; the one who peers at His beauty is poured out at once likea ladle. Those who attend on Him today do not attend on Him againtomorrow, and those who attend on Him tomorrow do not attend again,for their strength has grown weak and their faces have turned black, theirmind wanders and their eyes have darkened after [seeing] the adornmentof the splendor of the beauty of their King. As it is written, “Holy, holy,holy” (Isa 6:3).10This text seems to allude to two distinct groups. The second, which“attends on” God, is clearly made up of the angelic beings who servenear the throne of glory. By the end of the first day of their existencethe scorching heat of the divine presence has afflicted them withThere are other accounts in the Bible of dangerous encounters with God or divinebeings (e.g., Exod 4:24-26; Num 22:21-35). For an example from extrabiblical myth,see the Greek story of Semele, the mortal mother of the god Dionysus. Zeus, dis-guised as a mortal man, became her lover, but Hera persuaded her to demand ofZeus that he appear to her in his true form. She was burned to death by his radiance,but the quick action of Hermes saved her unborn child, Dionysus. (See RobertGraves, The Greek Myths, vol. 1 [rev. ed.; London/New York: Penguin, 1960] 56.)10Cf. 3 Enoch 22B:7 (P.

They “gaze” and “peer” at God and as a result are“torn apart at once” and are “poured out at once like a ladle.” Whoare they? The description of their actions makes the answer clear.The verb “to gaze” (lktsm) is frequently used in the hekhalot literatureto describe the visionary gazing of the descenders to the chariot at thethrone of God.12 Likewise, in the hekhalot texts the verb “to peer”(≈yxm) is used mainly of the four who entered the garden. Each ofthem “peered” into the garden (presumed to be “paradise” or theheavenly realm in these texts) and went to his appropriate fate.13 Thisis our first indication that the descenders to the chariot, who literallyrush in where angels fear to tread, are regarded as facing significantdanger in obtaining their goal of a direct vision of God.Two rather difficult passages in the Hekhalot Zutarti seem to tie thevision of God to the dangers of the descent. The opening paragraphreads:(§335) If you want to be unique in the world, to have the mysteries of theworld and the secrets of wisdom revealed to you, repeat this teaching andbe careful with it until the day of your separation. Do not seek under-standing of what is behind you and do not search out the words of yourlips. You will understand what is in your heart when you merit thebeauty of the chariot. Be careful with the glory of your Creator, and donot descend to it. And if you descend to it, do not enjoy it. And if youenjoy it, your end is to be banished from the world. “It is the glory ofGod to conceal a matter” (Prov 25:2), lest you be banished from theworld.This section promises the practitioner both special knowledge, pre-sumably Sar Torah revelations, and “the beauty of the chariot,” mean-ing the experience of the otherworldly journey and the vision of God.However, the warnings in the last part of the paragraph are obscure.11This idea is based on a midrash of Lamentations 3:23 which is found in therabbinic literature (see David J. Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot: Early Jewish Responsesto Ezekiel’s Vision [Tübingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1988] 267, 270).12E.g., 3 Enoch 1:1 (§1; Alexander, “3 [Hebrew Apocalypse of] Enoch,” OTP vol.1, 255-56); Hekhalot Rabbati §§81, 200; Hekhalot Zutarti §§337/347, 349/361, 412; G82a.46.13Hekhalot Zutarti §§338/344, 339/345; Merkavah Rabba §§671-72. The verb is alsoused in other passages to describe the descenders to the chariot looking at the visionof the throne of God: Hekhalot Rabbati §§102 (discussed below) 225; G8 2a.25. Curi-ously, every other use of this verb in the hekhalot literature has God or angels as itssubject: §331; Sar Panim §636; §791."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"    They seem to say that it is preferable not to descend to the chariot,but if one does so, he should certainly not “enjoy” the experience, onpain, apparently, of death. Perhaps “enjoying” the glory of God is atechnical term for some sort of magical praxis that was disapprovedof by the writer. Whatever the exact meaning, the association of thevision of God with deadly danger is clear.14The next paragraph (§336) gives an incantation revealed to Moseswhen he ascended to God. Next come variant versions of the story ofthe four who entered the garden, along with accounts of ascents ofMoses and R. Akiva (§§337-48). Then comes a passage that describesthe powers of the descenders to the chariot (§349 and the first sen-tence of §350). Then we read:(§350) First, this is written: “For a human being shall not see Me and live”(Exod 33:20). Second, it is written “that God speaks with a human beingand he lives” (Deut 5:24 [21]). Third, it is written: “And I saw YHWHseated on a throne” (cf. Isa 6:1b).(§351) And what is His name?

Ezek 1:14).The prophets say: “‘In a dream’ we see a vision like a man who sees‘a vision of the night’”( Job 33:15).The kings who are on the earth15 say: “'LWQ\" KTR GHYM.”But R. Akiva16 says: “He is, as it were,17 like us, and He is greater thanall. And this is His glory, which is made secret from us.”1814Peter Schäfer reads the whole paragraph as a “purposeful revision” of theprohibition of esoteric practice in m Óagiga 2:1, “taken up in a quite playful manner”(The Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism [Albany: StateUniversity of New York Press, 1992] 70-71; the quotation is on p. 70.) His interpre-tation is surely correct, as far as it goes, but it does not elucidate the warning againstenjoying the glory of God.15Var. “Those who walk on the earth.”16The name Akiva is missing in all but one manuscript.17See Peter Schäfer, et al., Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur III §§ 335-597(Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1989) 20 n. 1 for a discussion of this term.18Or “And this is His glory, that He is made secret from us.”"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"  ‒ Moses says to all of them: “Do not inquire into your own words; rather,let Him be blessed in His place.” Therefore it is written: “Blessed be theglory of YHWH from His place” (Ezek 3:12).The issue in the quoted passage seems to be the contradictory state-ments in the Bible about whether a human being can see God andlive. The first passage quoted, Exod 33:20, denies the possibility alto-gether. The second, Deut 5:24, asserts that the Israelites did just thiswhen they experienced the revelation of God at Sinai. Finally, Isa 6:1introduces Isaiah’s vision of God. The implied question is, Who isright? If it is fatal to see God, how was it accomplished by Israel atSinai and Isaiah in the temple? Peter Schäfer believes that the para-graph contains its own answer. The prophet Isaiah is taken to be oneof the descenders to the chariot (since he too saw the vision of God’sthrone), and the fact that he returned unscathed establishes that thereis indeed a way for human beings to survive the sight of God.19Schäfer may be right here, although it is not clear to me how theIsraelites’ vision of God on Mount Sinai is to be integrated into thisinterpretation. Be that as it may, the question is addressed further inthe rest of this section.The meaning of the second paragraph, especially in its context, isfar from transparent. Pointing to the initial question, “And what isHis name?” Schäfer suggests that “this entails that the name of Godis the crucial revelation for the merkavah mystic. . . . The ‘vision’ ofGod consists, so to speak, of the communication of his names.”20 C.R. A. Morray-Jones focuses on the use of the term “glory” (kabod):“[This paragraph] establishes a link between the kabod in thepreexistent celestial sanctuary and the earthly temple.”21 Both pointsseem to apply. The paragraph seeks to present theurgical knowledgeof God’s name and presence (glory) which is relevant for making thedescent to the chariot.The final section addresses how various kinds of beings experiencethe sight of God. The holy ones (angels) describe an element fromEzekiel’s merkavah vision. The prophets see visions in dreams. Thestatement of the kings of the earth (or mortals in general?) is incom-prehensible and probably corrupt. R. Akiva alludes to the vision ofGod in the Shi'ur Qomah: God looks like us, but is of enormous dimen-sions, and his true nature remains hidden from us. Moses gets the last19Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God 5820Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God 58.21C. R. A.

He seems to command a shift from speaking about God toblessing (i.e., praising) him. Again, the general sense is clear, althoughthe details are not. Angels have a direct view of the chariot. Prophetssee obscurely in dreams. The descenders to the chariot see God in thevision of the Shi'ur Qomah, although their human limitations prevent acomplete understanding of what they see. Schäfer takes the statementof Moses to be an anticlimax. Moses simply repeats the traditionalbelief that the job of both human beings and angels is “to praise Godduring the daily liturgy.”22 This much is certainly true, but it seems tome that Moses may also be affirming Akiva’s position by encouragingthe “blessing” of God in the sense of the ecstatic praise described inthe hekhalot literature as one of the means used by the descenders tothe chariot to induce their trances.In any case, once again, the vision of God is treated as a poten-tially fatal enterprise. But some hope is offered as well. The Israelitesat Sinai and the prophet Isaiah in his vision in Solomon’s Templelooked at God and lived. R. Akiva (presumably representing the de-scenders to the chariot) refers to the vision of the Shi'ur Qomah, whichis especially associated with his group. This successful perception ofthe beatific vision is associated with knowledge of the divine namesand the proper praise of God, both elements that belong to the as-cetic practices attributed to the descenders to the chariot.Vivid descriptions of this danger are found in both the HekhalotRabbati and the Hekhalot Zutarti. In the continuation of the text men-tioned above, which described the fiery nature of the angels aroundthe chariot (§101), we read:(§102) A condition of holiness, a condition of might, a fearsome condi-tion, a confounding condition, a condition of quivering, a condition ofcold sweat, a condition of confoundedness, a condition of shuddering isthe condition of the shirt of ZHRRY\"L YHWH, God of Israel, who isgarlanded and who comes onto His throne of glory.

The subject“gazes at” and “peers at” the divine vision. As a result he is torn apartand “poured out like a ladle.” But what is the cause and purpose ofthis horrifying ordeal? The most obvious answer is that this is pre-sented as the fate of unworthy human beings who somehow manageto pass the preliminary tests of the descent (such as the water test) andwho then stand before the throne of God. They are consumed by theradiant glory of God’s holiness. This seems to be the position of IraChernus, who argues that the best way to read this section “is toassume that in fact this text is describing dangers—very dreadfuldangers—facing the mystic who wants to see God. . . . I think, then,that the text is saying that no creature can see God under ordinarycircumstances, but if an individual is willing to accept these terrifyingdangers then he may in fact see God.”24 Although Chernus does notmake it explicit, his assumption seems to be that the person destroyedin this violent way must be an unworthy practitioner whose deathillustrates the dangers of the descent to the chariot. Presumably aworthy candidate would escape harm. Some support for this interpre-tation is found in the Merkavah Rabba in a warning given to R. Ishmaelby R. Akiva:(§681) R. Ishmael said:R. Akiva said to me:Son of the proud, go, return to the presence of R. Nehuniah benHaQanah and ask your master, that he may tell you and explain to youdiscernment regarding this praxis: how one makes use of it and howpeople adjure with it, lest you err and use it in a way contrary to the24Ira Chernus, “Visions of God in Merkabah Mysticism,” JSJ 13 (1982) 123-46;the quotation is on pp. 129-30."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"    halakhah and you act inappropriately and they (the angels) attack you as inthe case of so-and-sos whom they (the angels) attacked and whose gallwas dissolved inside them (the victims) to become like water. For theylistened to what was contrary to the halakhah and they acted inappropri-ately.25R. Nehuniah tells Ishmael that he has been protected thus far onlybecause of his priestly status, and then R. Nehuniah gives him in-structions for adjuring angels that are nearly identical to those hegives his disciples in the Hekhalot Rabbati (§203b-5).26 This paragraphuses the image of dissolution in a way similar to §§104 and 159, but itpertains to an attack, presumably by the angels, rather than a self-immolation caused by seeing God face to face. Thus it is a closerparallel to §204 than to §§102-104 and 159, although all three pas-sages deal with the dangers of the celestial descent for mortals.Instructions in the Hekhalot Rabbati on what the descender to thechariot should expect in the seventh palace also focus on dangersfrom angels during the descent.(§246) Greatest of all, there are the five hundred and twelve eyes in thefour living creatures opposite the gate of the seventh palace. All the formsof their faces are faces of sixteen by sixteen faces which belong to everysingle living creature, opposite the gate of the seventh palace.(§247) When a man seeks to descend to the chariot, 'Anaphi\"el opensthe doors of the gate of the seventh palace for him.

When the angel SNWNY\"L, the Prince of the Presence, revealed to R. Ishmaelthe punishments to be meted out to Israel, Ishmael exclaimed “As soon as I heardthis strong voice I was poured out and struck dumb, and I fell backward” (§124).Here the expression “to be poured out” is used metaphorically.26The passage in the Hekhalot Rabbati reads:(§203b) We came and sat before him, and the associates were a whole crowdstanding on their feet, because they were seeing to the globes of fire and thetorches of light that they had set as a barrier between us and them. And R.Nehuniah ben HaQanah sat and set out in order all the matters of the chariot:descent and ascent; how one who descends, descends, and how one who as-cends, ascends:(§204) When someone seeks to descend into the chariot, he calls on Suriah,Prince of the Presence, and adjures him one hundred and twelve times byˇWˇRWSY\"Y YWY who is called ˇWˇRWSY\"Y ÍWRˇQ ˇWˇRBY\"LˇWPGR ‘”RWYLY\"Y ZBWDY\"L and ZHRRY\"L ˇND\"L and ”QDHWZY\"YDHYBYRWN and 'DYRYRWN YWY God of Israel.(§205) And he must be careful not to add to the one hundred and twelvetimes, nor to subtract from them.

And everysingle eye of the holy living creatures is split open like a great winnow-ers’27 sieve. And the appearance of their eyes is as if “they dart likelightning” (Nah 2:5). Besides, there are the eyes of the mighty cherubimand the ophannim of the Shekhinah, which resemble torches of light andof flames of glowing juniper coals.(§248) And this man is in a cold sweat, and he shrinks back andshakes. He is confounded, confused, and overcome, and he falls back-ward. But 'Anaphi’el the prince supports him, he and the sixty-threeguardians of the gates of the seven palaces. All of them help him and sayto him, “Do not fear, son of the beloved seed! Enter and see ‘the King inhis beauty’ (Isa 33:17). You shall not be destroyed, nor shall you beburned.(§249 is a merkavah hymn.)(§250) And they give him strength. At once (God?) blows the horn“from above the firmament over their heads” (Ezek 1:26), and the holyliving creatures cover their faces, and the cherubim and the ophannimturn their faces, and he enters and stands before the throne of glory.Here the descender to the chariot is promised by the angels that hewill be spared both destruction and burning. Good as their word,they avert their faces in order to let him pass into the celestial throneroom, where he proceeds to recite the hymns of the throne.Two other passages in the hekhalot literature deal with how to avoidangelic immolation. The first is a prayer that appears at differentpoints in the MSS:(§§393//470//730) May You have goodwill, YHWH our God, whosemercy presses down in the hour when we invoke Your great and fear-some name, so that we are not drowned in fire. For all Your attendantsare flaming fire. May You have goodwill, O merciful and good Father,for in that hour we are saved from the harmful (spirits).The second is one of a group of adjurations of the Prince of thePresence found in the Sar Panim. It is to be recited after carrying outa set of ascetic exercises that are typical for these texts.28(§626) In this (forty-two letter) name, with this language, I call to you,‘WZHY’, Prince of the Presence, Youth, attendant before the King of theworld. And he is a prince and a master over the whole host on high.27This word is incomprehensible in the manuscripts. I translate according toDavid J. Halperin’s emendation (“A Sexual Image in Hekhalot Rabbati and Its Impli-cations,” Proceedings of the First International Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism:Early Jewish Mysticism, ed. Joseph Dan [Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought VI, 1-2;Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1987] 117-32, esp. 118, 126-27 n. 7).28These ascetic exercises are described in Sar Panim §623."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"    (§627) I adjure you and I decree upon you that you should augmentme so as to be bound to my will.

Specifically, it is possible to neutralize the threatfrom the guardian angels by reciting the proper hymns, presentingthe proper seals, and passing tests along the way. But this explanationdoes not suffice for §§102-104 and 159, which deal not with angelicencounters but with the experience of seeing God face to face. Anumber of points speak against this interpretation for these passages.First, given the horrendous trials that must be overcome on the wayto the chariot, it is hard to imagine that anyone unworthy of thevision could get as far as the throne of God in the innermost palace.But even if we grant the possibility, there is nothing in either §§102-104 or §159 that even hints that the descender to the chariot whosuffers this violence is sinful or wanting in merit or instruction.Rather, the indication is that simply gazing or peering at God has thismost unpleasant side effect. Third, a text in the Hekhalot Zutarti re-counts another such immolation, but this time the victim is named.He is R. Ishmael, the narrator and hero of much of the hekhalotliterature. Speaking of the obscure angel MGH(Y)”H or MNÓ”H,he reports:(§420) And he stands at the first gate and ministers at the great gate.When I saw him, my hands and feet were burned, and I was standingwithout hands and feet until PNYYWN the prince from among the heav-enly attendants appeared to me before the throne of glory opposite theinner room of the seraphim, whose name is like His name, and it is onename. And he stands before the throne of glory and tends the throne,and he clothes (God) with the shirt and adorns the Óashmal and opens29The text and meaning of this sentence are unclear (see Peter Schäfer et al.,Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur IV §§ 598-985 [Tübingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1991] 23)."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"  ‒ the gates of salvation to show grace and lovingkindness and mercies inthe eyes of all who see him.30Here R. Ishmael began to be consumed by the same fiery dissolutionthat overtook the nameless victims in §§102-104 and 159. But surelyin this case the process is not one of punishment for sinfulness orunworthiness. Rather, the common factor is that R. Ishmael “saw”the inhabitants of the heavenly throne room, apparently while he wasin front of the throne of glory (note the specific mention of God’sshirt).31One more example of this visionary disintegration and reintegra-tion is found in the hekhalot literature. It is perhaps the most illuminat-ing case, but I have delayed introducing it because it is in one of thelatest strata of these texts. It is the description of the transformation ofthe mortal Enoch into the angel Metatron in 3 Enoch 3-15 (§§4-19).But before we look at this passage it is worthwhile to examine thebiblical and postbiblical narratives about the antediluvian patriarchEnoch.3. The Enoch TraditionThe earliest mention of Enoch is found in Genesis 5:18-24. Thisintriguing fragment is the only reference to Enoch in the HebrewBible.32 It reads like a summary of a much longer story and raisesmore questions than it answers. Why did he have such a (compara-tively!) short life? What does it mean to say that “Enoch walked withGod”? And most intriguing of all, what should we make of the state-ment “and he was not, for God took him”?These questions were not lost on ancient Jewish writers, and theirinterest in Enoch is shown by the compendium of literature known30A variant version of this episode is found in G8 2b.36-44.31On this celestial garment see Gershom G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, MerkabahMysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (2nd ed.; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary ofAmerica, 1965) 56-64.32Another Enoch, a son of Cain, is listed in the Yahwistic genealogy in Gen 4:17-18. It is likely that this genealogy and the Priestly one share a common archetype inthe form of a list of names. Such “genealogical stocks” are known elsewhere in theWest Semitic world. But by the time of the final redaction of Genesis, the twogenealogies had developed independently into very different forms. It is clear that theeditor of Genesis considered the Enoch mentioned in chapter 4 to be a differentperson from the Enoch in chapter 5. As far as I can tell, no subsequent text in thelater literature about Enoch identified the two figures. For Genesis 4-5 see my article“The Flood Hero as King and Priest,” JNES 54 (1995) 199-214, esp. 207-10."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"    today as the book of 1 Enoch. Written originally in Aramaic andperhaps Hebrew it is fully preserved only in an Ethiopic translationbased on a Greek translation. Fragments of the original Aramaicwere discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls and were published byJ. T. Milik.33 The book of 1 Enoch is actually a library of texts aboutEnoch. No less than five works, written over a period of centuries, areincluded in this collection. In 1 Enoch the adventures of Enoch arerecounted in much more detail than in the Bible. Whether thesemore detailed legends are postbiblical exegetical expansion of thebiblical passage, survivals of a preexilic Enoch tradition that waspurged from the Bible, or both, does not concern us here.34 Ourinterest is in how these ancient traditions can illuminate our under-standing of the figure of Enoch in 3 Enoch.The Book of the Watchers tells the story of the lust of the angelsfor mortal women and the subsequent fall of these angels. This storyalso appears in very abbreviated form in Gen 6:1-4. In 1 Enoch 14-16,Enoch interceded for these angels (the “watchers”) and as a result wascaught up by God into heaven, where he saw a vision of the celestialthrone room with God himself seated on the throne. (This visionobviously has a great deal in common with the descriptions of theheavenly realm in the hekhalot literature.) In this text, too, the dangerof looking directly at God is emphasized. God then rejected Enoch’sintercession for the watchers. The phrase “and he was not, for Godtook him” is interpreted to mean that Enoch was taken up to heavenbodily while still alive. In the remainder of the Book of the Watchers(chs. 17-36) we are told how he was given a tour of the heavenlyrealm by the angel Uriel. Presumably he remained in heaven perma-nently.33J. T. Milik and Matthew Black, The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments from QumrânCave 4 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1976).34Milik argues that the verses on Enoch in Genesis 5 are dependent on theAstronomical Book (Books of Enoch 8). He also believes that part of the Book of theWatchers (chs. 6-19) served as a source for the story of the Nephilim in Gen 6:1-4(Books of Enoch 22-31). His position on these dates has not been widely accepted (see,for example, the review of this volume by James C. VanderKam in Maarav 3.1[1982] 85-97). Margaret Barker is inclined, at minimum, to find a core of preexilictraditions from the Judean royal cult in the literature of 1 Enoch. She also seems toallow for the possibility that some of the extant Enoch literature was composedduring the monarchy (see The Older Testament: The Survival of Themes from the AncientRoyal Cult in Sectarian Judaism and Early Christianity [London: SPCK, 1987], especiallych. 1; idem., The Lost Prophet: The Book of Enoch and Its Influence on Christianity [London:SPCK, 1988])."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"  ‒ Whether or not such a translation to heaven is envisioned in thebiblical text, this interpretation of Gen 5:24 is widely accepted in theEnoch literature written after the Book of the Watchers. The secondsection of 1 Enoch (chs. 37-71), the Similitudes of Enoch, is a case inpoint. This document, which is missing from the Qumran fragments,is dated by Milik as late as the third century C.E., although manyother scholars are inclined to put it sometime in the first centuryC.E.35 It consists of three cycles of visions revealed to Enoch whichdeal with the coming apocalyptic judgment and the mysterious heav-enly redeemer figure called the “Son of Man.” The last two chapters,which may be a secondary addition to the main work, describe howEnoch ascended to heaven, where he, in defiance of all narrativelogic, was himself transformed into the Son of Man.The book of 2 Enoch, which seems originally to have been writtenin Greek, survives only in a translation into Old Church Slavonic.Much of the material in it probably goes back to the early centuries.., although its final forms (two recensions are preserved) appear tobe the result of a long process of transmission.36 According to thiswork also, Enoch ascended to heaven and was given a tour of thecelestial realm. He was likewise transformed into an angelic beingwhen he came before the throne of God.374. Enoch and MetatronThis, then, is the mythic background of the story in 3 Enoch 3-15 (§§4-19). I have digressed concerning this tradition because it has beenshown by David Suter that there are striking parallels between the35Milik, Books of Enoch 89-98. For a summary of scholarship on the Similitudes seeJohn J. Collins, The Apocalyptic Imagination: An Introduction to the Jewish Matrix of Christi-anity (New York: Crossroad, 1984) 142-54.Jub 4:16-26 also tells a legend of Enoch that seems to be dependent on the Bookof the Watchers. Jubilees is fully preserved only in an Ethiopic translation and isgenerally agreed to have been written in the second century .. (see O. S.Wintermute, “Jubilees,” OTP vol. 2, 35-50 and 62-63; Collins, Apocalyptic Imagination63-67).36For discussions of date and provenance see F. I.

Elements of this legend are prob-ably also related to the translation of Enoch in 3 Enoch and the initiatory transforma-tion elsewhere in the hekhalot texts. For the rabbinic material see Ira Chernus, Mysti-cism in Rabbinic Judaism: Studies in the History of Midrash (Berlin/New York: de Gruyter,1982) 33-73."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"    Similitudes and 3 Enoch.38 The latter clearly flows out of the traditionthat produced the former, whether the connection is oral tradition,literary transmission, or both. With this in mind, let us now turn tothe account of Enoch’s apotheosis in 3 Enoch.The story begins with the ascent of R. Ishmael to the seventhpalace and his encounter with God and the angels. The angelMetatron reveals that he was once the man Enoch, but he was takenup to heaven in a fiery chariot as a witness to the generation of theFlood. Although he was challenged by the angels, who believed thata mortal had no place in heaven, God overruled them and revealedcelestial secrets to Enoch, enlarged him to enormous size, and en-throned him in what sounds very like a royal investiture. After receiv-ing the homage of the other angels, he underwent a fierytransformation into the highest angel in heaven:(3 Enoch 15:1b-2; [§19]) As soon as the Holy One, blessed be He, took meto serve the throne of glory, the wheels of the chariot, and all the needs ofthe Shekhinah, at once my flesh was changed into flame, my tendons intoa fire of glowing heat, my bones to glowing juniper coals, my eyelids toradiance of lightning-bolts, my eyeballs to torches of fire, the hair of myhead to glowing heat and flame, all my limbs to wings of burning fire,and my bodily frame to scorching fire. On my right were hewers of fieryflames, on my left torches were burning. There blew around me wind,storm, and tempest, and the noise of earthquake upon earthquake was infront of me and behind me.The apotheosis of Enoch in this passage is clearly a literary event, notnecessarily meant to describe the actual or potential experience of adescender to the chariot. Nevertheless, it provides an important con-text for the very difficult texts in the earlier strata of the hekhalotliterature which we have been examining. Gershom G. Scholemrightly uses this passage to interpret §§102-104. He writes that thevision of the “cosmic raiment” (the shirt of God)induces in some way the mystical experience which, according to 3Enoch 15:1, transformed the human Enoch into the angel Metatron. Inboth cases it is said that the eyeballs are transformed into torches of fire.This is not, it is to be noted, a description of dangers confronting themystic, but of a mystical transfiguration taking place within him. What is38David Winston Suter, Tradition and Composition in the Parables of Enoch (SBLDS 47;Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1979) 14-23. These parallels include the use ofsimilar terminology (such as twjwr, “spirits,” for angels; μyryjb, “elect ones,” for therighteous; the phrase “the throne of His glory”; and the Trisagion [Isa 6:3b]), acosmological oath that reveals the secrets of creation, and the transformation ofEnoch into an angelic being."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"  ‒ a permanent transfiguration in the case of Enoch, however, is only atemporary experience in the case of the Merkabah mystic . . .”39Morray-Jones, in response to Scholem’s comment, writes:Chernus disputes this interpretation, arguing that the passage refers tothe danger of the vision of the Glory, but both are surely right in whatthey affirm and wrong in what they deny. The meaning must be that thevision of the garment of the Glory, which embodies the Name of God,involves a transformation of the mystic’s body into fire, a process which isterrifyingly dangerous, even fatal should he prove unworthy.40Morray-Jones also notes two other passages that support the thesisthat this immolating transformation was experienced by worthy aswell as unworthy descenders to the chariot. In the Hekhalot Zutarti§349 (= §361), R. Akiva asserts that the descender to the chariot isable “to walk in rivers of fire and to know the lightning.” Later in theHekhalot Zutarti we read:(§366) R. Akiva said:I had a vision of and I observed the whole inhabited world and I saw itas it is. I ascended in a wagon of fire and I gazed on the palaces of hailand I found GRWSQ\" GRWSQ\" that sits on the burning sea.41Both walking in fire and riding in a wagon of fire “would hardly bepossible in an ordinary body.”4239Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism 60.40Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism in the Apocalyptic-Merkabah Tra-dition,” JJS 43 (1992) 1-31; the quotation is on p. 25.41A similar passage appears in the Magic Book (§496) which reads:R Akiva said:I saw (and) you (pl.) shall see those who tread on the inhabited land of theearth. And what is it? I ascended <<in the world>> in a wagon of fire. What did Isee? I saw GRWSQ\" that sits on the burning sea . . .”The word GRWSQ\" (with variants) is incomprehensible and appears to becorrupt in both passages. In §496 the word aml[b, “in the world,” is a corruptdittography of alg[b, “in a wagon.” The word wzjt, “you shall see,” may also be adittography of the previous word ytyzj, “I saw.” In §366 I have emended the mean-ingless word akzylqm (with variants) to the reading ylq amy, “the burning sea,” whichis found in §496.42Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism,” 24. Morray-Jones also mentions§420, in which R. Ishmael’s hands and feet were burned away. One more text, thistime in the Ma'aseh Merkavah, describes the transformation of a human being whoascends through the seven palaces. The speaker is R. Ishmael:(§558) When I ascended to the first palace, I became pious. In the second palaceI became pure. In the third palace I became upright. In the fourth palace I becamefaultless. In the fifth palace I brought holiness before the King of kings of kings,blessed be He.

The descenders to the chariot are chosen by shaman’smarks found on their bodies; they gain supernatural powers througha personal disintegration and reintegration; by means of rigorous as-cetic practices they generate ecstatic experiences (includingotherworldly journeys) and gain control over the spirits; and they usetheir powers as leaders in their communities.The focus in the present paper is the experience of personal disin-tegration and reintegration. We have explored passages in the hekhalotliterature which describe the dangers facing the descenders to thechariot. They focus on the radioactive glory that emanates from be-ings in the celestial realm, most especially God. Mortals who wish toenter the heavenly throne room risk attack and immolation by theangels, but careful adepts can avoid harm through knowledge of theproper magical techniques. Nevertheless, the achievement of theirmain goal, to gaze directly at God, brings a danger to the descendersto the chariot that cannot be avoided. Even the righteous R. Ishmaelfound himself literally consumed by the experience. The sight of thefigure of God on his throne brings about a personal disintegrationthat burns and rends its victim. But worthy mortals are transformedrather than destroyed by the ordeal. R. Akiva could walk in theheavenly rivers of fire and ride in a fiery chariot like the one that tookElijah into heaven. At least temporarily, he gained a divine naturesomething like that of Enoch, whose transformation into an angel wasnarrated as far back as the Second Temple period.This disintegration and reintegration is strikingly similar to thatexperienced by shamans. They are eaten alive and regurgitated,stripped down to skeletons and rebuilt, or transformed into lightning,or starved and revived. They return from these ordeals as new per-sons with great magical abilities. Thus, the descender to the chariot,like the shaman, undergoes a personal destruction and resurrection asshook and shrank back in all my limbs, and I said . . .

Space forbidsa lengthy digression on this problem, but a couple of possibilities are worth noting.First, the Second Temple descriptions of Enoch’s apotheosis could be purely fictionalliterature whose later reflexes served as a foundation myth of sorts in the hekhalotliterature. That is, the visionary experiences attributed to the descenders to thechariot were interpreted in terms of the Enoch legend, even though historically thereis no connection between the groups that produced the two bodies of literature.Alternatively, it is not impossible that shamanistic groups in the Second Temple eradrew on their own religious experiences in describing Enoch’s ascent, and that thehekhalot literature was written in circles that developed more or less directly fromthese apocalyptic groups. Much work remains to be done on this problem, and it willnot be solved soon, if ever. In Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses,Himmelfarb argues that both the Second Temple apocalypses and the hekhalot litera-ture are pure fiction, without any basis in visionary experience; whereas Morray-Jones, in “Transformational Mysticism,” seeks to establish a line of descent fromSecond Temple apocalyptic to the hekhalot literature.

But the relevance of thisfinding extends beyond Greco-Roman polytheism. For, as we shallsee, the histories of magic and sacrifice are intertwined.For evidence, one need only walk the streets of contemporaryJerusalem, where the ancient Jewish sacrificial cult infuses the iconog-raphy of popular religion, divination and magic. Objects depictingthe ancient Temple and its accouterments flourish in shops sellingreligious objects. Not only do messianically oriented religious move-ments sell pop-up paper models of the Second Temple for children toassemble, but objects related to the Temple and its cult are sold asagents of good fortune. One striking example is a shadowbox, meantto hang in a house or a shop, displaying a model of the breastplate ofthe High Priest in the Jerusalem Temple as depicted in Exodus 28-29. The model of the breastplate is inlaid with semi-precious stonesaccording to the manufacturer’s interpretation of biblical terms. Theshadowbox acts both as a reminder of the potency of the ancientpriesthood as a symbol of redemption, and as a talisman.

At the same time, one also notices the proliferation of icons ofcharismatic Rabbis—posters and even trading cards depicting RabbiYitzhak Kaduri, a popular practitioner of “practical Kabbalah,” theLubavitcher Bebbe and others. To put these two phenomena in termsof the current debate about the nature of Late Antiquity, sacred placeand sacred person both possess power.3In fact, the connections between sacrifice and magic extend tointellectual history as well. The two phenomena have suffered similarfates in the history of scholarship. From the Reformation on, magicand sacrifice became battlegrounds on which the lines of demarcationbetween “true” and “false” religion were drawn.4 As Jonathan Z.Smith has shown in his book Drudgery Divine, generations of historiansof religion seeking to distinguish ancient Christianity from itsneighbor religions have relied on Protestant polemics against Catho-lic conceptions of Eucharistic sacrifice—said to operate under theprincipal ex opere operato. In such polemics sacrifice and magic areidentical—and both are bad.5be’En Kol: Seder ha-’Avodah ha-’Ereß-Yisra’eli ha Qadum le-Yom ha-Qippurim ( Jerusalem:Magnes, 1996) 127-33, lines 583-634.Cf also Ba ̇ya b.

Early biblical scholars such as Yehezkiel Kaufman triedmightily to contrast biblical sacrifice with “pagan” sacrifice, whichwas said to operate under magical principles.6 But reversing thistrend, Baruch A. Levine, in his ground-breaking study In the Presence ofthe Lord, sought to show that magical concepts informed the rituals ofthe priestly authors of the Torah no less than their neighbors.7For this reason, it is significant that contemporary scholars ofGreco-Roman magic, including those represented in this volume, areinclined to see the rituals of the Greek magical papyri and relatedsources as expressions of a domestic or individualized sacrificial cult.8This insight has recently led to some fine and subtle analyses of sac-rifices in magical texts.9 In Judaism of late antiquity and the earlymiddle ages as well, the connections between sacrifice and magic aresubstantial. This discussion will focus on how the image of the ancientsacrificial cult influences the literature of Jewish magic.101. The TempleSacrifice in the Jerusalem Temple was not only at the heart ofJudaism from its beginnings to 70 CE, but it served a multitude ofpurposes.11 The sacrifices served, in the priestly conception, to enablethe palpable presence of God to come down to earth and bestow theblessings of an agricultural society on the land of Israel.12 But what6For a concise version of Kaufman’s argument, see Yehezkiel Kaufman, TheReligion of Israel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960).

As Hannah’sprayer in 1 Samuel 1-2 demonstrates, people took their personalproblems to the cultic sites. The Temple was the place where oracleswere inquired, where women gave sacrifices after birth, and where ajealous husband could submit his wife to trial by ordeal.13When the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE, a new class of leaderssought to redraw the terms of Jewish life, now bereft of its ritualcenter. The Rabbis argued that prayer, study, and performance ofthe commandments were effective substitutes for the Temple, andsubsumed cultic wisdom into their broader scholastic system.14 Butthe memory of the cult lived on—in synagogue iconography andpoetry, in interpretations of Leviticus and related scriptures, and inthe esoteric traditions. As Johann Maier, Martha Himmelfarb,Rachel Elior, and others have pointed out, concerns and motifs com-mon to the Temple cult permeate the early Jewish mystical tradi-tion.15 So too, as we shall see, elements of the cult and its artifactsfound their way into the magical tradition. This discussion will focuson two main topics: the place of the cult in the rhetoric of magicalbooks and incantations, and the use of purity and cult in magicalrituals.It is worth noting that these two themes are literary motifs and notsimply matters of ideology or praxis. We now know how important itis to pay attention to the literary features of magical texts. They cantell us how the authors used literary patterns, historiolae, promisesand warnings, and ritual instructions for specific rhetorical pur-poses.16 Rhetoric in magical texts is directed both at the entity to be13For a survey of these functions of the cult, see de Vaux, Ancient Israel, 2:457-67.14On the attitude of the early Rabbis to the cult, see Jacob Neusner, “MapWithout Territory: Mishnah’s System of Sacrifice and Sanctuary,” in Method andMeaning in Ancient Judaism (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1979) 133-53; for Rabbinicstatements on sacrifice and its replacements, cf.

Onthe one hand, the deity (or angel or demon) must be convinced thatit is in his or her interest to answer the practitioner’s request ordemand. On the other hand, those taking part in the ritual must beconvinced in the value and effectiveness of the ritual action and thepower of the one performing it.2. Substitutes for the CultWe can see this dynamic in operation in the first motif under discus-sion: the notion found in Jewish magical texts that a particular ritualaction can serve as a substitute for a corresponding ritual of the fallencult. This idea finds explicit expression in two genres of magical texts:instructions preserved in magical manuals from the Cairo Genizahfor an esoteric form of the biblical Sotah ritual, that is, a trial byordeal of a woman suspected of adultery; and in introductory prayersthat appear in Jewish divination texts.2.a. ‘Inyan SotahWe begin with a curious text from the Cairo Genizah entitled ‘InyanSotah, or “Concerning the Accused Woman.” The text provides in-structions for a contemporary equivalent to the ritual described inNumbers 5:12-31 for testing the so-called “wayward woman” (sotah),who is suspected by her husband of committing adultery. This textwas published most recently by Peter Schäfer and Shaul Shaked, andhas been discussed by Moshe Idel and Guiseppe Veltri.17 The text,16On the value of literary and rhetorical analysis of magical texts, see Swartz,“Scribal Magic and its Rhetoric.” Cf. also David Frankfurter, “Narrating Power:The Theory and Practice of the Magical Historiola in Ritual Spells,” in Meyer andMirecki, Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, 458-76, and idem, “The Magic of Writing andthe Writing of Magic: The Power of the Word in Egyptian and Greek Traditions,”Helios 21 (1994) 189-221.17The text first appeared in A.

If she is guilty, the “water willturn bitter, her belly will swell and her thigh sag.”18 If she is innocent,she will not be harmed—indeed, she will carry her baby to term. Thisunusual ritual is the subject of a lengthy talmudic tractate; however,according to the Mishnah, the ritual fell out of practice at the end ofthe second-temple period.19Our text provides a latter-day substitute for that ritual. The textbegins with the kind of pedigree that can be called a magical chain oftradition.20 This introduction concerns the divine names used for theSotah ritual. According to the text, the names were written down bythe legendary second-century sage Rabbi Ishmael as dictated byMetatron. This pseudepigraphic attribution is very common in mysti-cal and esoteric Jewish texts of late antiquity and the middle ages.21The text then claims that:some of (the names) were revealed to Moses at Sinai at the (burning) bushand some were revealed to Elijah on Mt. Carmel and some were revealedto every prophet by Mesamriyah22 who stands before the divine curtain,until the time of the Sanhedrins of Israel, who knew the seventy names[of God] and the name of purity and the name of impurity. They alsoknew every precept of ritual action.(MS. JTSL ENA 3635.17 fol. 17a lines 13-17)The introduction therefore focuses on powerful divine names grantedby an angel to the prophets and later sages. These are indentifiedwith the Explicit Name (ha-shem ha-meforash) and the seventy names of18Num 5:27. This phrase may be an expression for abortion, implying that thehusband suspected the wife because she was pregnant and believes that the childcould not be his. See the discussion in Baruch A.

Thetext goes on:Know and understand that of these secret names, which are the ExplicitName, they would give the water to the Sotah to drink, and because ofthese names her belly would swell and her thighs would fall. These arethe words with these names, which they would write for her: they are theExplicit Name, which the High Priest would recite in holiness and purity.(fol. 17a line 18 - fol. 17b line 3)This passage is interesting both for its historiographic implicationsand its conception of the role of the divine name. The author intro-duces into his chain of tradition the Sanhedrin, the ruling council ofJudea in the second-temple period. As Veltri points out, this inclusionhas both a historiographic and a political meaning.24 The most fa-mous chain of tradition is that of the opening of the Mishnah tractateAvot, in which Torah is handed down from God to Moses, then to theprophets and second-temple Pharisaic sages, and finally to the Rab-bis. In that chain of tradition the priests as a caste are notably ab-sent.25 In our text as well, the author wishes to include in his list ofideal figures the pre-Rabbinic sages, the forbears of the Rabbis of hisday. But at the same time, he needs to do so precisely because of thepriestly nature of the text. The Sotah ritual was one that required apriest and therefore reinforced priestly authority and power. By in-cluding the sages, the author balances that priestly authority with thatof the sages. But more than this, he ascribes to those sages access toone of the same sources of holiness held by the priests: the sages, likethe priests, knew the powerful magical names. As we will see, thesenames hold the key to freeing the Sotah ritual from the constraints ofthe Temple cult.At this point the text lists those names, which were included in thetext of the biblical imprecation that is mixed with the waters. Indeed,the author tells us, neither the water itself nor the earth from the23On the seventy names, see Joseph Dan, “The Seventy Names of Metatron,” inProceedings of the Eighth World Congress of Jewish Studies Division C (1982) 19-23.

Fraade, From Tradition to Commentary: Torah and its Interpretation inthe Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991) 70-71; Louis Finkelstein,Mavo’ le-Massekhtot ‘Avot ve-’Avot de-Rabbi Natan (New York: Jewish Theological Semi-nary, 1950) xxix."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"  ‒ Temple mixed into it contain bitterness. Rather, it is the text of theimprecation, with its divine names, which afflicts the guilty woman.Turning to the present day, the author acknowledges that “wehave no priest nor holy water nor sanctuary.” Nonetheless, he in-forms us that there is:a way of performing [the ritual] that we do today. Know and understandthat if a man fears heaven in this age, and cleanses his soul of sin andiniquity, and walks in the way of purity in his flesh, and attends to thesenames, and perfects his soul in these ways, he becomes like an angel anda high priest. He will not go forth empty-handed in anything he does.(fol.17d lines 1-8)At this point the text gives the details of the ritual. The text alludes tothe idea that the high priest is like an angel, an idea that goes back toMalachi 2:7 and continues throughout the second-temple andtalmudic periods.26 This idea has several ramifications. As the angelsattend God on high, so the priests attend him in the sanctuary.27 Butas the human priest, unlike the angels, is made of flesh and blood, hemust purify himself in preparation for encounter with the divine pres-ence.Now we see why it is necessary for the Sanhedrin to be in posses-sion of the divine names. Two elements of the ritual, the earth fromthe Temple Mount and the holy water, are unavailable after thedestruction of the sanctuary. But if the magical names are the potentingredient of the ritual, and if they were held by a ruling body otherthan the priesthood, then they are available to the post-exilic magi-cian who can perform them outside of the Temple.But what of the holy water and the earth from the Temple? Thetext instructs:At the beginning of the procedure, instead of what the text says—“holywater” (Num 5:17)—you should take water flowing from a spring in aceramic vessel. And instead of the earth from the Tabernacle, you should26See, for example, the Qumran Rule of Benedictions (1Q28b), 4/25-26 andMidrash Leviticus Rabbah 21:2; on the idea, see Joseph Yahalom, Az be-’En Kol: Sederha-’Avodah ha-Ereß-Yisraeli ha-Qadum le-Yom ha-Kippurim ( Jerusalem: Magnes, 1996) 17,123.27This idea is dramatically illustrated in such texts as the Qumran Songs for theSabbath Sacrifice, which depict arrays of angels performing heavenly sacrifices, aswell as many Rabbinic tales of a heavenly temple and Michael, its high priest. On theQumran Sabbath Songs, see Carol Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice: A CriticalEdition (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1985); on the idea of a heavenly Temple in Rabbinicliterature, see Avigdor Aptowitzer, “Bet ha-Miqdash shel Ma’alah ‘al Pi ha-’Aggadah”Tarbis 2 (1931) 137-53, 257-87; and Samuel Safrai, “The Heavenly Jerusalem,” Ariel23 (1969) 11-16."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"    go to the synagogue and take earth from the four corners of the ark of theTorah.(fol. 17d lines10-15)As Moshe Idel documents, there are several sources that ascribe crea-tive power to the earth from the Temple.28 That earth, called “virginsoil,” was a key ingredient according to some medieval mystical textsfor creating an artificial creature known as the Golem. Indeed, ac-cording to the early Rabbis, because Adam was created from the dustof the earth, soil has the power to bring a son to term in the biblicalSotah ritual.29 Moreover, some related ritual texts concerning thesubstitute term “house of study” (bet midrashekha) for the Temple (betmiqdashekha). So too, the magical Sotah ritual substitutes the earthfrom the synagogue for the earth from the sanctuary. Our text thusrepresents the magician—that is, the reader who will follow theseinstructions—as the modern-day equivalent of the biblical priest. Thesynagogue also becomes the modern-day equivalent of the Temple;here it is the physical sanctity of the Torah scrolls contained in theark that allow for this unusual substitution.30 More importantly, theritual itself fulfills what the author apparently saw as a vital missingpart of the cultic system, the Sotah ritual.2.b. Divination TextsThe idea that the magical ritual can serve as a substitute for a par-ticular element of the Temple cult also appears in divination booksfound among magical documents from the Genizah and in printededitions.31 These books usually include a prayer to be recited by the28Idel, Golem, 61-63. For Rabbinic legends linking the Temple to the creation ofthe world, see Raphael Patai, Man and Temple in Ancient Jewish Myth and Ritual (Lon-don: Thomas Nelson, 1947) 54-104.29Idel, Golem, 62.30On the development of the idea that the Torah scrolls make for the holiness ofthe synagogue as a sacred space, see Steven Fine, This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of theSynagogue during the Greco-Roman Period (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre DamePress, 1997). On the synagogue and its relationship to the sanctity of the Temple, seeJoan Branham, “Vicarious Sacrality: Temple Space in Ancient Synagogues,” in DanUrman and Paul V. M. Flesher, eds., Ancient Synagogues: Historical Analysis and Archaeo-logical Discovery (Leiden: Brill, 1995) 2:319-45.31The literature of Jewish divination remains largely unstudied, although dreams,astrology and certain individual divination procedures have received some attention.See, for example, Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 208-29; Moritz Steinschneider, JewishLiterature from the Eighth to the Eighteenth Century (Hildesheim: Olms, 1967) 202-03; J. C.Greenfield and M.

In the prayerspreceding the oracles, the practitioner asks that God receive his re-quest favorably. The following example is from one Genizah frag-ment, MS. TS K1.131.32 This fragment is similar to the book GoralotA ̇itofel, “The Oracles of Ahitophel,” which appears in several ver-sions in manuscripts and printed editions.33The prayer emphasizes that the petitioner will not use the oraclesin order to “transgress the Torah and what is written in it,” andexpresses the hope that the community will be among those who holdfast to the Torah. Among other things, the petitioner asks to use theoracle becausewe have neither prophet nor priest to inquire of the Urim and Thumim.Therefore, I approach you and rely on your abundant mercy in inquiringof these oracles for every matter, to inform humanity of your ways; they34will thank you for all your works, whether good or bad, whether healingof sickness, whether deprivation or abundance, as it is written: “I shallraise the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord; I shall findtrouble and agony, and call out the name of the Lord.”35Here the author explicitly states that the text’s divination system cansubstitute for the Urim and Thumim in the Temple.2.c. Cult in Magical RitualFor the most part, this discussion has emphasized how the rhetoric ofa magical text recommends a practice as a replacement for a Templeritual. But we have also seen how the ‘Inyan Sotah ritual imitates thebiblical ritual, substituting post-exilic elements for those of the Tem-Babylonian Oil Magic in the Talmud and in the later Jewish Literature (London: Jews College,1913); Joseph Dan, “Sare Kos ve-Sare Bohen,” Tarbis 32 (1963) 359-69; GershomSholem, “Hakarat Panim ve-Sidre Sir†u†av,” in M.

We turn now to a consideration of rituals themselves which echothe cult.One common type of magical ritual recalls the cult in its relation-ship to specific elements of biblical ritual. These are preparatory pro-cedures in which the practitioner is to purify himself by fasting,immersion, and avoidance of certain foods and of various types ofsexual contamination. These rituals of purification appear in magicalhandbooks, especially in the introductions, in which the practitioneris instructed to prepare himself before using the entire book. Theforms of purity in these texts can be seen as hyperextensions of thebiblical purity system, in which the ritual actor must purify himself toan angelic degree.36Occasionally, one of these rituals appropriates an element of theTemple cult itself. One Genizah fragment is apparently from amanual for reciting magical names according to times of the year.This text is apparently an instruction for a ritual in which the practi-tioner clothes himself, as it were, with the name of God. This idea iswell attested in medieval Jewish magic.37The text warns the reader not to incur the wrath of God, nor touse the magic for his own glory. The manual then instructs:You shall perform all of these (procedures) in the fear of God. Protectyourself well from any bad thing. And when you perform all of these(procedures) you should go out to the trough and say many prayers andsupplications, and ask that you not fail again. Then speak this gloriousname in fear and trembling. If you see the image of a lion of fire in thetrough, know that you have succeeded wearing this holy name.

This figure reminds us of the lions’ headsthat appeared on the Cherubim in Ezekiel’s vision.39The key ingredient in this ritual is an object called a ßiß—a goldplate on which the divine name is engraved. In the Bible, the termrefers to the gold frontlet, a strip of gold engraved with the divinename that the High Priest wore on his forehead when he served inthe Temple.40 In the Talmud, that frontlet is said to be an agent ofexpiation which affects atonement for sacrificial transgressions.41 Inmagical texts, the term refers to a metal amulet or lamella.42 Thus, asthe priest’s frontlet was considered to be an agent of ritual effective-ness in the Temple sacrifice, the gold plate in our ritual carries with itits own potency. While the magician cannot become the High Priest,he takes on some of the priest’s power, vested in him by virtue of thename of God engraved on gold and worn on his person. As in themagical Sotah ritual, the divine name is what allows the magician totransfer sanctity from the realm of the Temple to the realm of post-exilic ritual.One of the most striking types of sacrificial ritual found in Jewishmagical texts remains to be explored: rituals in which an animal isactually killed. For example, in Sefer ha-Razim, a white rooster isslaughtered, its blood is mixed with flour for cakes, and its blood isalso used for ink;43 the blood of a fowl is used elsewhere in Jewishmagical texts for writing incantations.44 Even more dramatic is theslaughter of a lion cub, also in Sefer ha-Razim.45These prodecures resemble similar rituals in the Greek magicalpapyri.46 But whereas there the ritual can be placed on a continuumwith the Greco-Roman domestic cult, there was no such cult to speak39Cf. Mordecai Margoliot, Sefer Ha-Razim: Hu’ Sefer Keshafim mi-Tequfat ha-Talmud( Jerusalem: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1966) 6:32, in which the imageof a lion is to be engraved on a ring; and chapter 1, lines 136-40, in which the bloodof a lion recalls the terror to be felt by the inhabitants of a city whom the practitionerwishes to intimidate; cf. below, on the sacrifice of a lion.40Exo 28:36; 39:30; Lev 8:9.41B.

Sefer ha-Razim chapter 1, line 135, in which a ßiß is to be inscribed with theblood of a lion and buried; and chapter 6, line 30 (cf. n. 39, above), in which a goldlamella is inscribed and placed in a ring to ensure safety in war or escape.43Sefer ha-Razim chapter 1, lines 160-69.44See, for example, MS TS K1.117 (Geniza 16) page 7, line 2, published by J.Naveh and S.

ConclusionsWhat can we learn from this material? First of all, we see more clearlysome of the territory that magic and sacrifice share. For example,each deals with the most physical aspects of religion; each is con-cerned with dispelling demonic forces and attracting divine beings.Yet, there are at least two elements that make each ritual a specifi-cally magical appropriation of the Temple ritual. One is the power ofthe magical divine name, an indispensable feature of Jewish magic.The other is how the magical ritual, by virtue of that name, makes anexclusive cult—limited to only a few acres on earth and performed bya small aristocracy—available to all who are in possession of its se-crets.49 Moreover, in affecting the transition from Temple to magicalritual, the practitioner also shifts his focus from the collective con-cerns of the Temple cult to the concerns of the individual.Returning for a moment to the streets of present-day Jerusalem,we can take account both of the pop-up model of the Temple and theRabbi trading cards. Sacrificial elements in Jewish magic serve thesetwo conceptions of holiness—sacred place and sacred person. By pre-serving the memory of the Temple, the magicians recall sacred place.But at the same time they transfer its sanctity to anyone who holdsthe magic, thus allowing all who practice it to become powerful per-sons.47Compare, however, the ritual for kapparot, a ceremony for the expiation of sinsbefore Yom Kippur in which a rooster is slaughtered by a householder. On thispopular practice, see Jacob Z. Lauterbach, “The Ritual for the Kapparot Cer-emony,” in Studies in Jewish Law, Custom and Folklore (New York: Ktav, 1970) 133-42.48On these rituals, see further Michael D. Swartz, “Understanding Ritual inJewish Magic” (forthcoming).49That is, it is available, at least, to all Jewish males. Many of the rituals describedhere are accompanied by instructions that the practitioner is to avoid contact withwomen; cf. Swartz, Scholastic Magic, 162-65. However, the kapparot ritual was some-times practiced by women who would use a hen, rather than a rooster, for expiation."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"PART FIVEGREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITY"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE ETHNIC ORIGINS OF A ROMAN-ERAPHILTROKATADESMOS (PGM IV 296-434)C A.

There are,moreover, even greater variations in the text of the incantationwhich, in addition to the long version found in the handbook, ap-pears on no less than five other lead tablets, all dating between thesecond or third century CE and all probably found in Egypt.3 Al-though two somewhat shorter texts closely parallel (as far as they go)the logos preserved in PGM IV,4 two other tablets of very similar dateshow considerable variations (e.g. one has unique metrical additions)and were found sealed together (but without any effigies) inside a claypot that was inscribed with a shorter, altogether different kind of lovecharm.5 A fifth version of the text, now at the Kelsey Museum inMichigan, uniquely preserves the latter part of the logos found in thehandbook (PGM IV 406-33), although it exhibits considerable varia-tion as well.6 We have, in short, evidence for a popular and veryelaborate magical ritual that was performed repeatedly in RomanEgypt in a tradition that allowed great freedom of execution.Although all of these texts clearly bear witness to the same tradi-tional spell, I emphasize the differences between them, since previousscholarship has repeatedly privileged the Louvre ensemble and thePGM recipe as the most important witnesses for this tradition, andhas in some cases treated them as the lynch pin in arguments about2Brashear (n. 1) 3417 n. 152.3D.G.

Pierre du Bourguet,for example, when he first published the Louvre ensemble, acknowl-edged the obvious Egyptian influence on the bound and pierced figu-rine sealed in the pot, but suggested in the end that the wholeapparatus was best understood as a development within the Greektradition of binding spells (defixiones).7 Other scholars confirmed thatcertain aspects of the treatment of Louvre figurine were very reminis-cent of native Egyptian rites of the Ptolemaic period, but ventured noopinion on the origins of the ritual itself.8 Most recently, however,Ritner—again assuming that the Louvre figurine and the PGM recipeare the best witnesses to the original rite—has strongly argued for apurely Egyptian background for it:9Despite the Greek language of the text [i.e. the PGM recipe quotedabove], the intrusive appearance of Ares, and the Roman date (third tofourth centuries) of both papyrus and figurine, the rite here described isnot of Greek origin, but instead represents the culmination of an indig-enous Egyptian tradition whose origins are contemporary with the crea-tion of Egyptian civilization itself. The posture and material of the femalefigurine, and even the detailed attitude of the missing Ares figure, attestto a millennia old tradition from which they derive. To trace the develop-ment of this tradition, and the position of the Louvre figurine within it,one must first examine the techniques not of private but of royal magic,attested from the earliest remains of ancient Egypt.Ritner assumes, of course, that the Ares figure is inadvertently missingfrom the Louvre apparatus and then goes on to trace the history ofpaired figures of Pharaoh smiting a bound prisoner in the royal magicof Egypt. Later on in the same study, moreover, he notes that thelead tablet found with the Louvre figurine addresses a corpse-demonby the name Antinoos and he concludes that the entire logos andindeed the whole Greek tradition of binding spells is “not Greek, butEgyptian, deriving from the ancient native custom of private ‘lettersto the dead’.”10 Finally, after discussing private Egyptian curses that7du Bourguet (n. 1) 234.8M.J.

The first is the alacritywith which Ritner moves from a perceptive insight about a singleritual detail to the more global assertions quoted above, without care-fully considering the relationship of such details to the overall frame-work of the rite. The second methodological problem with his workin this area seems to stem, ironically enough, from his desire to cor-rect similar errors by Preisendanz and other classicists who accordingto Ritner pushed for an untenable “pan-Greek” theory of origins.12Indeed, with regard to this philtrokatadesmos ritual he frames the prob-lem of cultural origins oversimplistically as a choice between only twopossibilities; for example, he is emphatic that the practice is not Greekbut Egyptian or that it is purely Egyptian (my emphases). In taking sucha limited and polarized view of cultural interactions in Roman Egypt,Ritner replicates the same, methodological flaw of the scholars heseeks to correct and similarly turns a blind eye to important and welldocumented influence from Semitic and especially Jewish sources.In this essay I examine each of Ritner’s specific arguments aboutthe philtrokatadesmos spell, namely that: (i) the logos of this spell can betraced back to the Egyptian “letters to the dead”, in which the peti-tioner addresses a ghost by name and asks it to take action against his11Ritner (n. 9) 183, where he mentions du Bourguet in n. 852.12Ritner argues that Preisendanz and others repeatedly ignored the Demoticspells and the obviously Egyptian character of many of the PGM spells and assumedthat the PGM were “inherently Greek cultural material, marred by intrusive ‘barba-risms’ typical of a syncretistic age”—see R.K. Ritner, “Egyptian Magical Practiceunder the Roman Empire: The Demotic Spells and their Religious Context” ANRW2.18.5 (1995) 3359-62 (esp. p. 3360 for the quote above and the phrase “pan-Greekattitude”), where, unfortunately, he errs in the opposite direction in pushing anequally implausible “pan-Egyptian” origin for all of the Greek magical papyri.

In what follows, Iargue to the contrary that the spell under discussion is most likely arich and very interesting amalgam of two originally separate Greekand Semitic practices, that made its way into Egypt sometime duringthe Roman era, at which point it was altered in some very minor, butinteresting ways to accommodate local Egyptian practices and beliefs.Indeed, we shall discover that the two details that Ritner fastensupon, the address of the ghost by name (a feature of the “letters to thedead”) and the act of sealing a single image in a jar (a commonEgyptian practice) are actually non-standard practices within thefamily of texts and artifacts found in Roman Egypt itself. In otherwords, he is absolutely correct to see purely Egyptian sources forthese two ad hoc details, but he errs in his wider conclusions that theentire ritual is completely Egyptian in origin.The Logos:In an appendix to his learned commentary on the Michigan leadtablet, David Martinez prints a hypothetical archetype for the logos ofthe philtrokatadesmos spell, which he creates by carefully collating thefamily of six texts described above and discovering which parts of thetext all or nearly all of them share.13 This archetype provides the beststarting point for a discussion of the origin of the logos, as it gives us amuch better idea about what earlier versions of the spell looked like.Indeed, we can begin to parse some of the ethnic contributions to thisbasic version of the spell by noting that the first section of the arche-type shows very strong and obvious signs of Greek influence:I deposit (parakatatithemai) this binding charm (katadesmos) with you,chthonic gods, Pluto uesemigadôn and Kore Persephone Ereschigal andAdonis also called barbaritha, and Hermes Katachthonios Thothphôkensepseu arektathou misonktaik and mighty Anubis psêriphtha, who holdsthe keys of the gates to Hades, and chthonic daimones, gods, men andwomen who suffered untimely death, youths and maidens, year afteryear, month after month, day after day, night after night, hour afterhour.13Martinez (n. 3) 113-117.

It is not, however, native to Egypt and does not appearto be popular in pre-Hellenistic Egyptian magic. There are importantdetails of language as well. The Greek verb parakatatithemai, for exam-ple, and other related terms of deposit are familiar in Greek defixionesfrom the late classical period onwards, as are invocations to Hermesin his role as Katachthonios.15 The archtype of our philtrokatadesmos,moreover, openly calls itself a katadesmos, a term that Plato uses in thefourth-century BCE to describe the binding spells popular in Athensduring his lifetime.16 A recently discovered lead tablet of late fourth-or early third-century BCE date shows, moreover, that the earlyGreek use of this term is not limited to Athens: “Pausanias puts abinding spell (katadesmos) on Sime, daughter of Amphitritos....”17 Thuswe can see from the outset that the lead medium on which the logos isinscribed, its self-referential designation as a katadesmos, its other vo-cabulary, and its content are all attested as a coordinated assemblagein Greece prior to Hellenistic times.The peculiar order and organization of the names of the variouschthonic gods invoked on this tablet confirms the Greek origin of this14See C.A. Faraone “The Agonistic Context of Early Greek Binding Spells” inC.A. Faraone and D. Obbink edd. Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (NewYork. 1991) 3-32, for the early date and diffusion of defixiones. D.R.

Johnston (n. 10) 71-80 discusses theimportance of deposit in graves and shows persuasively that as early as the classicalperiod the ghosts of the restless dead are used as agents for Greek binding spells. Onpp. 77-78 she quotes and discusses part of the logos under discussion to illustrate howit is a descendent of this Greek tradition.15See: H.S.

There are five groups separated by the connective kai (“and”)which can be illustrated as follows: ... Pluto uesemigadôn,and Kore Persephone Ereschigal,and Adonis also called barbarithaand Hermes Katachthonios Thoth phôkensepseu arektathou misonktaik,and mighty Anubis psêriphtha, who holds the keys of the gates to Hades ...The division and the sequence of these names is highly important, forit seems that in the first three cases, a Semitic name or a Semitic-sounding vox magica has been added after the Greek name without anyconnective at all just as if it were a gloss on it or a translation of it.18In the fourth case, the name Thoth and phôkensepseu arektathoumisonktaik, an Egyptian-sounding series of magical words,19 has simi-larly been added after the name of the Greek god HermesKatachthonios, all of which suggests to me, at least, that this spelloriginally named a roster of four Greek chthonic deities: Pluto, Kore,Adonis and Hermes, and that at some later time the names of non-Greek gods were added, as a kind of foreign equivalent or translationof the original Greek names.20 Note, too, that in the fifth position,Anubis stands alone, with an Egyptian sounding vox magica and men-tion of his possession of the keys of the underworld, another tradi-tional Egyptian motif.21 His name is not, like the others, placed thereas an Egyptian equivalent of a Greek god, but rather as a completelynew addition at the end of the Greek sequence, a strategy of accul-18According to the very helpful “Glossary of Voces Magicae” in Brashear (n. 1)3576-3603, the word uesemigadôn is Hebrew for “That is: his name is great”,Ereschigal is the Babylonian goddess of the underworld, and barbaritha is possiblyAramaic for “Arba has come”; or Hebrew: “Art thou Arba”.19The same three words appear, e.g. at PGM III (in a heavily Egyptian-influencedspell) and at LXVII 11-12 (as an epithet of Hermes Thoth; see Koenen, ZPE 8[1971] 205). A variation of the first word (phôkenseps) has been explained as Egyptianfor “der mit dem Schwert Geschmückte.” See Martinez (n. 3) 43.20Adonis may, however, be a special case. His worship was borrowed by theGreeks from the Levant in the early archaic period (Sappho mentions him) and hisname derives from Semitic Adôn, “Lord”. The Aramaic word that follows his name isnot, moreover, simply placed after Adonis’s name, as in the other cases in thispassage, but rather it is linked with the Greek words ho kai, which is a regular Greekformula for adding a supernomen to the god’s name, as Martinez (n. 3) 41 shows. Weshall see below, moreover, that there is evidence that the original Greek list ofunderworld deities in this charm may have been limited to Pluto, Hermes andPersephone.21According to Brashear (n. 18) psêriphtha may be Egyptian for “son of Re-Ptah.”See Martinez (n. 3) 41-45, for all of the Egyptian motifs here."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"  ‒    turation that is observable in other cases where classical Greek textsare brought into Roman Egypt and then extended to make themrelevant to their new cultural setting.22It is interesting to note, in fact, that the invocation in the shorterOxyrhynchus version of the logos is devoid of all of the Semitic andEgyptian material that we find in Martinez’ archetype: “I deposit thisbinding charm with you, chthonic gods, Pluto and Kore andPersephone and the chthonic daimones ....” It looks, in short, verymuch like the Greek forerunner for the invocation that I have beensuggesting. Here we might be tempted to ignore the puzzling separa-tion of Kore and Persephone, were it not for the fact that we get thesame division in an invocation of similar date and style on lead tabletfrom Alexandria:23 “Hermes Chthonios archedama phôchensepseusarertathou misonkaitk and Pluton uesemmigadôn maarchama and KoreEreschigal zabarbathouch and Persephone zaudachthoumar.” Here we seewhat is probably another early version with four Greek gods, eachagain glossed with a foreign name of Semitic or Egyptian origin.24Note that neither this lead tablet nor the Oxyrhynchus one mentionsAnubis and his keys to the underworld or Adonis. Close analysis ofthe first section of the logos suggests, then, that this invocation with its22The most famous example is the case of a traditional fifth-century hymn (the so-called Erythraean Paean) that shows up in Roman Egypt, with an additional fifthstanza that explicitly mentions the Nile River and Egypt.

See the prefatory remarks in SM. The invocation quotedhere is followed by an adjuration of the Jewish type addressed below in note 25: “Iadjure you by the name of Gê Chthonia (= Chthonic Earth) meuri môritharcoth.” Herethe Greek divine name Gê Chthonia is similarly glossed with a following vox magica,the first part of which seems to be an epithet of Hathor which connects her with “theprimal flood” (see the commentary in SM ad loc.)24In each case the new voces magicae follow the same pattern of “ethnic glossing”that we see in the philtrokatadesmos.

The recently discovered25In this paragraph, I closely follow D.G. Martinez, “May she neither eat nordrink ...: Love Magic and Vows of Abstinence” in M. Meyer and P. Mirecki (edd.)Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (Leiden 1995) 335-360, esp. 344-45, who carefullydistinguishes “vows of abstinence” (in which someone places themselves under acurse until they do something) from “self-curses” (in which someone places themselvesunder a curse after they do something). Both are in fact conditional curses, the formerdesigned to force a desired action while the latter aims at preventing an unwantedaction. In his exhaustive study Martinez makes no mention of any pre-HellenisticEgyptian parallels for such vows of abstinence.26Iliad 9.209-10 and Acts of the Apostles 23:12."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"   ‒    lead tablet from Acanthus (mentioned earlier), proves—as had longbeen suspected—that defixiones employing this form of the “vow ofabstinence” (“let Ms. X not do Y until she comes to Mr. Z”) wereused for erotic purposes at a much earlier date than had previouslybeen attested: “Pausanias puts a binding spell (katadesmos) on Sime,daughter of Amphitritos... and neither let her be able to touch avictim sacrificed to Athena nor let Aphrodite go sweetly for her, untilSime embraces Pausanias.”27The third and final section of the logos continues on to adjure thecorpse-demon, but in a different manner (by the name of an allpowerful deity) designed to ensure the swift compliance of thenekudaimon:Because I adjure (exorkizô) you corpse-demon, by the dreadful and fright-ful name of the one at the sound of whose name the earth will open, atthe sound of whose name the daimones tremble fearfully, at the sound ofwhose name the rivers and the seas are thrown into disorder, at thesound of whose name the rocks are split.

In the latter case,however, as Daniel and Maltomini have stressed, Kamês, the nameof the nekydaimôn, has been squeezed in above the line as an after-29Compare, e.g., an early Egyptian parallel to these types of threats quoted byMartinez (n. 3) 71: “If his name is pronounced on the border of the river, then it willdry up.” This is the translation of J.F.

I see a verydifferent historical process at work, for it seems much more likely thatin the Roman period native Egyptian magicians probably came intocontact with this Greco-Semitic spell, saw it as something novel andadded it to their own repertoire, customizing it by adding the namesof the Egyptian gods as glosses to the names of the Greek chthonicdeities and in two cases (at least) adding the name of the deceasedperson perhaps to draw this foreign spell into a closer analogy withthe local Egyptian tradition of “letters to the dead.” The lesson to belearned here, of course, is that single, isolated details are less reliableindicators of primary cultural influence than parallels between largerassemblages or sequences of details, since it is very easy for a laterredactor or copyist insert a single detail—indeed in the Oxyrhynchustext Kamês, the name of the corpse, was literally squeezed into thetext above the line—than it is to reconfigure long stretches of text.The Praxis:Let us now turn to the praxis of this spell as narrated by the PGMrecipe and as can be reconstructed from the scant archaeologicalevidence that accompanies the few lead texts found in situ. As wehave seen, Ritner makes two claims about the ritual apparatus usedwith the logos discussed above: (i) that the ritual described in the PGMrecipe—the creation of a bound and kneeling female abused by astanding male—is purely Egyptian and very ancient in origin, goingback to dynastic sculptures of Pharaoh striking a bound enemy; and(ii) that the burial of the Louvre effigy alone in a jug reflects later andmore private Egyptian execration rites. Du Bourguet and others hadalready acknowledged the debt that the Louvre figurine owes to31See the editors comments on SM 37, where they cite other examples of namingthe nekydaimon, but concede that it was not the usual practice. In the Oxyrhynchustext (SM 50, line 12) the scribe did not even bother to alter the standard text whichstresses the anonymity of the nekydaimon: “... whoever you are, Kamês.” The scribe whoinscribed the text that accompanies the Louvre effigy, however, was more sophisti-cated: he deleted the phrase “whoever you are” when he added the name ofAntinoos the nekydaimon."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"     -Egyptian cursing rites, and this has indeed never been a controversialpoint (see notes 7 and 8). Ritner’s assessment of the original Egyptianinfluence of the iconography of Pharaoh smiting his enemy on thePGM spell is equally uncontroversial, but here once again the widerconclusions that he draws seem unwarranted. I shall show below thatthe Greeks, beginning in the late archaic period, did indeed copythese paired images, but that they altered them in two very significantways: they frequently made one or both of the paired effigies female,something that does not occur in Egypt, and they begin to connectthis practice with specific mythological narratives about Ares andAphrodite that show up in the Roman-period on a series of magicalgemstones which depict Ares in full armor leading away a bound andnaked Aphrodite. These gemstones, moreover, seem to have beenused for precisely the same purpose as the philtrokatadesmos ritual un-der discussion (i.e. the erotic subjucgation of a woman), and theysuggest that although such two-figured scenes may eventually betraced back to the royal magic of dynastic Egypt, in their peculiarform in the PGM handbook—Ares threatening a naked female—theyhave a chronologically nearer and thematically more significant ori-gin in the Greek tradition of erotic magic.I begin my exposition, as Ritner does, with the familiar scene ofthe Egyptian pharaoh smiting a foreign prince (figure 1). The figureof the pharaoh is larger than his enemy and stands over him graspinghis hair with one hand and an uplifted mace or club with the other.The enemy, in stark contrast, kneels in a humbled position, trying toward off the blow or perhaps supplicating the smiting pharaoh withhis hand. Although the actual details of these traditional pharaonicscenes do not match the description in the PGM recipe of Ares “hold-ing a sword in his left hand and threatening to plunge it into the rightside of her neck,” I think that Ritner is probably correct to trace themagical use of the paired images in the PGM spell to this well knownEgyptian scene. His further claims, however, for a pure and directline of Egyptian influence on these images cannot be sustained.32 Inthe first place, there is clear evidence that this type of two-figuredscene arrives in the Greek world in the form of Egyptian andPhoenician artifacts as early as the 8th century BCE and begins toshow up in the iconography of Greek art as early as the sixth century.In his apparently eye-witness description of the famous Chest ofCypselus, for example, Pausanias describes the scene of “a good-looking woman punishing (kolazousa) an ugly one, choking her withone hand and with the other smiting her with a rod (rhabdos). It is32See note 9."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"  ‒    Dike who does this to Adikia.” His explicit identification of the twofigures as Dike (“Justice”) and Adikia (“Injustice”) probably isprompted by inscriptions on the chest itself to which he refers else-where.33 Nearly a century ago it was recognized that a small amphorain Vienna portrays a nearly identical scene in which the figures areagain clearly labeled as Dike and Adik[i]a.34 Since the surface of thevase is worn and does not reproduce well, I provide in figure 2 a copyof a nineteenth-century drawing of the painting. The iconography ofthe vase painting—especially the posture of Adikia—is plainly deriva-tive from the Egyptian tradition, although in the Greek painting thereis no difference in the size of the figures and Dike grabs her victim bythe throat not the hair.Scholars often assume that this vase painting, which dates stylisti-cally to about 520 BCE, is simply a copy of the scene that Pausaniasdescribes on the famous Chest. There are, however, minor differ-ences which urge caution: the figure of Dike in the extant vase paint-ing holds an ax or a mallet not a rod, and her victim’s skin is coveredwith dotted circles, which as Frel points out, recall the tattoos on thebodies of Thracian women depicted elsewhere on Attic vase paint-ings.35 I should note that since Herodotus reports that only Thraciansof the highest birth tattooed their bodies (5.6), we might read thisimage even more specifically as follows: a Greek aristocratic ladyjustly punishing an upper-class Thracian one. This is, on the onehand, very close to the ideological stance of the Egyptian images ofPharaoh preparing to strike a foreign prince, whose ethnic origin issometimes denoted by a distinctive headdress or by stereotyped racialfeatures. On the other hand, the use of females instead of malesindicates that already in the late archaic period Greek artists havemade a decisive departure from their Egyptian model. Whatever itsideological origin,36 this allegorical scene of Dike striking Adikia33Pausanias (5.18.2). See H. Stuart Jones, “The Chest of Cypselus” JHS 14 (1894)69 n. 67.34For bibliography, see J.

The inscription is nolonger visible on the vase.35Frel (n. 34) 95 n. 4.36The precise nationalistic ideology lying behind the Greek image (if in fact thereis one) is not as obvious as in the Egyptian, especially since some Athenian aristocratshad long and very profitable relations with the Thracians and their silver mines. In"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"     -seems to have been very popular in the Greek world, for within acentury paired figures in similar poses show up again and again inAttic vase paintings, especially in scenes where the just action or re-venge of a character seems to be stressed, for example in images (suchas that in figure 3) of Theseus justly killing the villain Procrustes withhis own mallet, where the grasping of the hair and the turning andsupplicating figure of Procrustes seems to reflect the Egyptian scenesclosely.Ritner has rightly and quite eloquently stressed how the Egyptiantradition of the smiting Pharaoh bridged the boundaries of magic andideology, since it both publicly advertises the superiority of Egyptianmilitary might over its neighbors and at the same time magicallyensures that such dominance will continue.37 Although the putativelyThracian tattoos on the figure of Adikia suggest some political orideological vector in the Greek tradition of such images, we do notget any inkling of this second performative or magical aspect. We do,however, find it in an extraordinary inscription, which suggests thatthe Greeks were also capable of blending propaganda and magic in apaired set of images of this sort. The text dates to the first-centuryBCE and contains a hexametrical oracle that had in all likelihoodbeen issued by the pan-Hellenic sanctuary of Apollo at Clarus on thewestern coast of Turkey. In this oracle, Apollo gives advice to thepeople of Syedra, who were apparently plagued by the incessant at-tacks of pirates or brigands:38his article on the vase Frel (n. 34)—followed by Shapiro (n. 34)—argued that thescene was an allegory that dramatized the longings of an Athenian painter during thedifficult final days of the Pisistratid tyranny. If Frel is correct, then we might suspectthat the painter has taken the image from an earlier monument that contrastedGreeks and barbarians and cleverly reused it to equate some party at Athens with theThracians. According to this interpretation, the painting was an essay in wishfulthinking: “If only Dike would triumph and punish the wicked tyrant”.37Ritner (n. 9) 113-36, especially p. 115: “Rendered tangible and permanent instone, the image was designed not simply to reflect, but to create reality, guarantee-ing by “sympathetic magic” the victory of the state and the gods.” I completelyagree, but see note 41 below for my preference for Tambiah’s term “persuasiveanalogy” over the traditional Frazerian formulation of “sympathetic magic.”38G.E.

On theother side let Justice (Dike) giving sentence judge him, while he himself islike to one pleading. For thus, after he has marched his unholy mob farfrom your native land, he will be peacefully disposed to you and will raiseup much-prayed-for prosperity.In this oracle, Apollo advises the Syedrans to erect in their town astatue of Ares bound and probably kneeling as the reference to sup-plication suggests.39 The triumphant image is again of the femaleDike who stands in judgment over him, most probably in a threaten-ing pose.40Regardless of the precise iconography of the figure of Dike, it isquite clear that this scene is very similar to the tradition of pairedimages under discussion and that it is expected to restrain and hum-ble the hostile force of the pirates in some “persuasively” magicalway.41 It is, in short—as every commentator has agreed—a case ofthe magical use of images to influence the behavior of an enemy.Ares’ relationship to the pirates is a bit unclear, but we do find evi-dence for a popular Greek belief that brigands and highwaymen in39The expression in the Syedran inscription (“while restraining him with the ironbonds of Hermes”) need not mean that the god Hermes was actually depicted, butonly that he was believed to have invented the shackles or that they were within histraditional sphere of activity (cf. the Veneris vincula in line 78 of Vergil’s Eclogue 8;surely we need not suppose that Venus made an epiphany during the spell). For theinterpretation followed here, see Faraone (n. 8) 168-70.40The inscription describes Dike’s pose with the verb dikazein, which usuallymeans “giving judgment”. The verb dikaioun (very similar in meaning to dikazein) can,however, in an Ionian writer like Herodotus (e.g. 1.100) mean “to punish”, raisingthe possibility that Dike is to be envisaged as somehow physically punishing thebound Ares. If this is correct, we should probably imagine that Dike is to be depictedhere in a menacing way with a sword or rod, as she, Nemesis and other avengingdeities appear in some Hellenistic Greek paintings and later Roman imitations, suchas the winged figure in one of the wall paintings at the Pompeian “Villa of theMysteries.” for an excellent discussion with illustrations and bibliography, see M.P.Nilsson, The Dionysiac Mysteries of the Hellenistic and Roman Age, Skrifter utgivna avSvenska Institutet i Athen 8.5 (Lund 1957) 124-25.41I use “persuasively” instead of the more traditional term “sympathetically”. S. J.Tambiah, “Form and Meaning of Magical Acts: A Point of View” in Modes of ThoughtR. Horton and R. Finnegan edd.

He distinguishes instead between the operation of “empirical analogies” (used inmodern scientific discourse to predict future actions) and “persuasive analogies” usedin rituals in traditional societies to encourage future action). For application of this ideato Greek rituals, see G. E. R.

This suggests that there are two ways to “read”the statue group prescribed by the oracle: foregrounded by the Egyp-tian parallels, it would seem that the images were designed to restrainforeign enemies to the north, whereas if we compare it with theGreek scenes of Dike throttling Adikia or Theseus smiting the notori-ous highwayman Procrustes, the Syedran monument seems to be castmore as a solution to a local problem of law-and-order, an aspect thatis not, in fact, absent from the traditional Egyptian reliefs. Indeed, thepharaoh was for the Egyptians the embodiment of justice, so wemight say that the Greek adaptation of the scene preserves this idea,while separating the personified Dike from the body of the divinemonarch, a figure that was never very popular in pre-HellenisticGreece.One might argue, of course, that the Syedran scene was borrowedby the Greeks directly from the Egyptians in the Hellenistic period—a period when, of course, the Ptolemies had great influence in theEastern Mediterranean. Indeed, this use of a tableau of two figures inan ideological and magical monument designed to prevent the attacksof hostile enemies is very close in both content and purpose to theEgyptian figures of Pharaoh striking his enemies. There are not, how-ever, any overt signs that it has been recently borrowed from the Egyp-tians. It is odd, for example, that Justice (Dike) is the triumphantfigure here, not some figure directly representing the city of Syedrajust as the Pharaoh represents Egypt. In fact I would argue that thisstatue group is tied much more closely to the earlier Greek appropria-tion of the Egyptian tradition in which the idea of Justice herselfpunishing criminals is above all stressed.42In the novel of Xenophon of Ephesus, for instance, Hippothoos and his band ofrobbers (lêistai) garland a wooden statue or Ares and prepare a peculiar form ofsacrifice, which involves tossing a javelin at a hanging victim (13.1). G. Palmeyda,Xénophon d’Ephese: Les Ephésiaques (Paris 1962) 32 n. 2, suggests that the motivation forthis type of worship here lies in Hippothoos’ Thracian origins (2.1). In Apuleus’Golden Ass, the Thessalian bandits pour a libation and sing hymns in honor of Mars(4.22) and sacrifice an old male goat to him on an altar of green turf (7.5), a scene inwhich they are addressed as deo Marti clientes.43Faraone (n. 8) 168-70."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"   ‒    These figures of Dike and Ares can also be connected in someinteresting ways to a series of Greek rituals that at first glance mayseem quite inappropriate for comparison: the use of pairs of images inprivate erotic love spells. Horace, a Roman poet roughly contempo-rary with the Syedran inscription, describes a pair of effigies used bythe witch Canidia in a magical spell that apparently has an eroticconquest in mind: “There was a wax doll and a larger woolen one,which restrained the smaller with punishments (poenis), while it (i.e.the smaller, wax figure) lay there groveling, like a slave about todie.”44 Most commentators build upon the suggestion of a scholiastthat the dominant, woolen doll represents the female practitioner(Canidia), while the smaller, wax figurine depicts some unfortunatemale victim—a reading that seems to be corroborated by the use ofwoolen material to make the larger doll.45 Scholars have, of course,adduced Canidia’s effigies in connection with the PGM spell underdiscussion, pointing out how the goal of both spells—and the statuegroup described in the inscription from Syedra for that matter—is toequate the practitioners with the dominant figures and their victimswith the subservient ones. Note, moreover, that in all three cases thegender of the triumphant figure is different from that of the victim,but that gender is not tied to the dominant or subservient role: afemale figure dominates the scene at Syedra and in Canidia’s spell,whereas a male figure is in the superior position in the PGM recipe.The identification in the PGM handbook of the dominating maleas “Ares fully armed” suggests, moreover, some connection to a par-ticular Greek mythological narrative. Since Ares and Seth are ofteninterchangeable in Roman-era texts from Egypt, one might arguethat the name and traditional iconography of Ares here is simply asuperficial Greek translation of an original Egyptian spell in whichSeth, plays the role of the attacker. This line of argument is plausible,but it runs counter to centuries of Egyptian religious rituals in whichthe pharaoh is equated with Re, Osiris or Horus, while his enemiesare assimilated to Seth, who along with Apophis, is regularly depictedin effigy and then ritually bound, cut up, pierced and otherwiseabused.46 In short: if the PGM rite develops (as Ritner supposes) di-rectly from the Egyptian images of Pharaoh smiting his adversaries, we44Satire 1.8.30-33.

I would argue,in fact, that the name and iconography of Ares in the PGM spell are,in fact, important clues for understanding the more proximate originsof the scene, and that most Greeks when presented with a tableau ofan armed and helmeted Ares threatening a bound and naked womanwould have assumed that the female was Aphrodite, since the twoappear together in similar antagonistic fashion on a series of Roman-era gemstones from various parts of the eastern Mediterranean out-side of Egypt (see figure 4).47 These gemstones, moreover, exhibit thesame flexibility in the gendering of the dominant role that we haveseen in the Greek and Roman texts discussed above: some depict afully armed Ares leading a naked Aphrodite whose hands are boundbehind her back, while others show the reverse—a fully clothedAphrodite leading and whipping Ares, who is naked (except for hishelmet), while Eros stands to the side holding Ares’ sword and shield.Since examples of each of these carved gemstones carry an inscrip-tion of voces magicae or vowels that are typical of other magical texts,scholars are correct in their assumption that such scenes are notsimply mimetic of some lost mythic narrative about these two divini-ties, but rather they were used as part of a persuasively magical ritualdesigned to bring about the power relationships depicted in thesescenes.48 There are, moreover, indications of a specific affinity ofthese images to the PGM spell under discussion: one of the gemstoneswith Ares triumphant bears a magic word, which also shows up at the47See M. Blanchet, “Venus et Mars sur les intailles magiques et autres” CRAI(1923) 220-34 and A. Delatte and P. Derchain, Les intailles magiques gréco-égyptiennes(Paris 1964) 239-44. For the connection between the iconography of these gemstonesand our philtrokatadesmos ritual see Martinez (n. 49). It was made independently by Dr.Simone Michel, in a lecture given at the same symposium in London where I pre-sented my own conclusions on the PGM spell (note 51 below). I was delighted to hearthat she came to the conclusion that “the gem represents a radically simplified ver-sion of the essential elements of the philtrokatadesmos spell.” Her findings will appear inan essay entitled “(Re)interpreting Magical Gems (Ancient and Modern)” in theconference proceedings to be edited by Mark Geller.48See note 41 for “persuasive images” in Greek magic.

Martinez (n. 3) 105-108, esp. 107-108, and Michel (n. 48) both discuss the importance of this link between the PGMrecipe and the gemstones.50 Scholars postulate a similar use for the set of thematically opposed magical gem-stones that either show Eros torturing a bound Psyche (used by men against women)or Psyche torturing him (vice versa). One of the striking things about these gem-stones—especially in light of the important role that Dike plays in the Greek traditionof these two figured scenes—is their emphasis on the just nature of the binding orpunishment, indicated by the inscription of the word dikaiôs (“justly so!”) or thepresence of the goddess Nemesis or her symbols.

Ritner argues, of course, that the canonical scenes from royalEgyptian magic are the direct source for the philtrokatadesmos ritual. Thechart above suggests, however, that the PGM tableau is much morelikely the result of a rather complicated process whereby the standardEgyptian scene is hellenized in the late archaic period in Greece andthen develops independently in different directions. In the first in-stance, the dominant figure of the heroic god king is replaced by theGreek goddess Dike (Justice) who attacks and subdues Adikia (Injus-tice) or Ares (who represents the violence and mayhem of brigands).About a century later the pose is taken up by young male heroes likeTheseus, who justly attack and subdue notorious evildoers and brig-ands like Procrustes. We have seen, however, that despite the moral-izing stance of these earlier Greek adaptations (i.e. good triumphingover evil), we still find traces of the nationalistic themes in the Egyp-tian original: Adikia, for instance, is marked by tattoos as a Thracianand the bound Ares described in the Clarian oracle should mostprobably be connected with barbarian raiders from the Anatolianhinterland. There is, however, a second wave of Greek innovation,first attested in an Horatian satire, that pushes the Greek traditioneven farther from its Egyptian roots: taken up into the field of eroticmagic these two-figured scenes begin to emphasize the different gen-ders of the figures and connects them for the first time with thepopular Greek narrative of the stormy relationship betweenAphrodite and Ares. In the light of this later Greek tradition, thename and iconography of Ares in the PGM recipe cannot be dis-missed as a superficial and late replacement of an originally Sethianfigure. Rather it is, by the fourth century CE, a central and importantpart of the Greek tradition of using pairs of figures, one male and theother female, to bind and attract erotically a member of the oppositesex."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"  ‒    ConclusionLet me conclude by drawing together some general reflections aboutthe very complicated ethnic backgrounds to this fascinating recipe inPGM IV. Ritner in his general analysis of both the logos and the praxisof this spell implicitly assumes that the pierced effigy in the Louvreand the text found with it were the most important evidence for thismagical rite, and since there are some obvious signs of Egyptianinfluence on this apparatus, he assumed that this was true for thewhole tradition of these spells and most especially the PGM IV recipe.My close analysis of the entire family of texts associated with theserituals reveals to the contrary that the names of Egyptian gods Thothand Anubis and thier Egyptianizing voces magicae were most probablyintroduced secondarily into the amalgamation of this multi-ethnicspell and that the naming of the ghost in the text in the Louvre—Ritner’s strongest argument for connecting the spell to the Egyptian“letters to the dead”—was probably an ad hoc invention that occursonly twice among the 5 extant spells and is absent in the PGM recipeitself. We have seen, moreover, that a similar distortion occurs inRitner’s treatment of the Louvre effigy, which was found sealed alonein a pot in a necropolis, without the figure of Ares stipulated in therecipe. He notes quite rightly that this treatment of a single magicaleffigy is a common form of private cursing ritual in Egypt, but thenby extrapolating from this idiosyncratic variation of thephiltrokatadesmos ritual, he ends up arguing wrongly that the entireseries is wholly dependent on Egyptian models. On the other hand,he is probably correct to see the traditional Egyptian images of Phar-aoh striking his enemy as the aboriginal source for the postures of thetwo figures in the PGM recipe, but a similar distortion creeps inbecause he seems to dismiss or ignore the important difference ingender between the two figures and the peculiarly Greek mythologi-cal narrative about Ares and Aphrodite. We have seen, however, thatas early as the classical period, Greeks adopted this type of Egyptianiconography and hellenized it in three distinctive ways: (i) in theClassical period the dominating figure became associated with justaction or the punishing of criminals and was often rendered as thefemale character Dike; (ii) in the late Hellenistic and Roman periodsthis use of paired figures was adapted for erotic spells such as inCanidia’s ritual with the wool and wax effigies, with the crucial differ-ence that the genders must be different; and (iii) around the same timethese paired figures are connected with an important Greek narrativeof erotic subjugation that was very oddly reversible: the armed andarmored Ares leading a bound and naked Aphrodite or the reverse."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"     -I should close by reiterating the caveat that I started with: each ofthese texts and images needs to be treated carefully in its own histori-cal and social milieu, and when we attempt to trace out the variousethnic sources for and influences on a particular ritual we shouldabandon at the very start any notions of a “pure” or “single” ethnicpedigree for any magical spell in a collection as heterodox as thePGM. To paraphrase Jonathan Z. Smith, my colleague at the Univer-sity of Chicago: the goal of an historian is not to simplify the facts butto examine and present them in all their wonderful complexity. Wehave known for some time now that the eastern Mediterranean basinfrom the Bronze Age down to the Roman period was the site ofcontinual and very complicated cultural exchanges; therefore, if weare trying to explain the history of a series of magical rituals inscribedin the Greek language and buried in Egyptian soil during the Romanperiod, we need to eschew overly simplistic arguments of pure ethnicinfluence and try to imagine a much more complex historical processin which Greek, Semitic and Egyptian features have been combined,adapted and then recombined.5151 Earlier versions of this paper were read at conferences at Claremont University(organized by Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki) in August 1998 and at the WarburgInstitute in London in June 1999 (organized by Mark Geller).

Sacrifice was a sine qua non ofestablishing communication between mortals and greater powers,and thereby also vital to other interactions that relied on such com-munication. Sacrifice and its symbolic codes, moreover, helped todefine religious acts and the parties who participated in them. “Nor-mal” sacrifice helped to mark occasions and their participants as be-ing “normal” themselves and conversely, “abnormal” situations orgroups were marked by “abnormal” sacrificial procedures: the an-cient Greek allegations that distant peoples such as the Taurians andColchians practiced human sacrifice are well-known examples of thisidea.My second axiom is that magic and religion are difficult to distin-guish from one another—if indeed they can be distinguished at all.Numerous attempts have been made both to establish and to rejecttheir distinctiveness, using a variety of criteria. For the readers of thisvolume I need scarcely provide a list, but I would note that thecriteria are almost always the same as those that, in the opinion of thescholar who has selected them, are definitive of religion or its role insociety. Most famously, this is exemplified by Sir James Frazer’s pro-posal that the religious individual piously worships the gods and themagician coerces them.1*I am grateful for the comments made in response to oral versions of this essay,particularly those of Philippe Borgeaud, David Frankfurter, Fritz Graf, AlbertHenrichs, André Lardinois, Lisa Maurizio, Jean Rudhardt, Youri Volokhine, andVictoria Wohl.1J.G.

Here I will begin to do that by lookingat three examples of sacrifice from PGM IV, the Great Paris MagicalPapyrus. First, however, I would like to lay down some guidelineswith which I approach any study of rituals in the PGM.To begin with, we should remember that each of the papyri in thePGM represents a collection of spells, brought together by a scribe toserve his own interests, in much the same way that one of us mightcollect recipes into a recipe file, borrowing them from cookbooks andfriends as they strike our fancy.3 The sources of the spells within anysingle papyrus may vary considerably, therefore, as may their culturalbackgrounds. We should also remember that the rituals in these spellswere more liable to adaptation than the rituals of traditional cult:because the practitioners who used the spells were independent con-tractors who worked outside of civically controlled cults and theirrules (even if they were affiliated in some cases with local temples),4 aguish magic and religion—as well as their underlying assumption that the two canever be distinguished fully—the underlying approach itself has some virtues: if we areto understand a relationship between two phenomena, we must compare them, andif we are to compare them, we must identify their salient features and ask to whatdegree those features are shared.2F.

Meyer and R. Smith, Ancient Christian Magic.Coptic Texts of Ritual Power (San Francisco: Harper, 1994) 259-62.4Smith, “Trading,” esp. 22-27, who emphasizes the fact that many details in thespells indicate the expectation that they will be performed in a domestic setting—thehouse of the client or of the practitioner himself as needed—and Frankfurter, “Ex-pertise,” who argues that in many cases the practitioners were priests of local Egyp-tian temples who, as their traditional roles as priests became eroded under Romanrule, increasingly functioned as local ritual experts, hired by individuals to solvequotidian problems. The willingness of the practitioners to adapt spells is demon-strated as well by the instances in the papyri where two different versions of a singlepraxis or logos are recorded side-by-side, sometimes with the advice that the user"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"  ‒    practitioner who heard about, or developed, a better technique foraccomplishing a particular aim could amend a spell just as we mightamend a recipe after discovering that a different spice improves itsflavor.5 I do not mean to imply that a such a practitioner would haveignored the basic guidelines of established rituals, but rather that hewould have felt freer to reinterpret them, and thereby to adapt therituals he was using, than did the priests of long-standing, civicallycontrolled cults. A good analogy for what I am driving at is the wayin which the rhapsode of archaic Greece used myth. Each rhapsodedrew on the same body of traditional myths when constructing hispoems, but each adapted those myths freely to suit particular occa-sions or themes. A rhapsode who changed a story too significantlywould surely have been censured (Achilles cannot be allowed to sur-vive the Trojan War) but skillful changes within the proper limitsenhanced his story and its ability to convey meaning.6These observations have a further implication: unlike, say, scenesof sacrifice in individual books of the Iliad, the rituals within indi-vidual spells of the PGM can be used as comparanda for each other onlyto a limited extent. We must analyze each ritual largely in isolation,attempting to discern the possibly unique way in which it responds totraditional sacrificial ideology and structure in pursuing its particulargoals. This is the reason that I will interpret just a few spells in detailadopt whichever works best for him or whichever includes readily available ingredi-ents, e.g., PGM II.1-64, towards the end of which the scribe offers two variations ofthe final compulsive procedure; PGM IV.26-51, which gives two recipes for the eyeointment to be applied at the end (see further on this spell below, pp. 353-57); PGMIV.296-466, where an alternative name for the demon to be invoked is given at theend with the notation that the scribe found it in another spell; PGM IV.1275-1322: “Icall upon you, the greatest power in heaven (others say “in the Bear”)...”; PGMIV.2073-74, which refers to a variant praxis that the scribe did not choose to copydown; PGM VII.374-76 and 376-84, two different spells to induce insomnia, offeredside-by-side; the numerous, slightly different methods of vessel divination offered inPDM xiv; and most famously, the three different versions of the “Book of Moses” inPGM XIII.1-734. Notable, too, is the tendency of scribes to aver that the procedurethey are copying down has been tested and proven valid, which implies an atmos-phere of experiment and comparison (e.g., PGM I.42-195, PGM XII.270-73, PDMxiv.117 and 424).5See examples listed in the previous note.6For example, as Homer’s Achilles tells the story at Il. 24.602-17, Niobe assuagesher grief with food before being petrified. Within the immediate story as narrated byAchilles the point of the change is to convince Priam to eat despite his grief; withinthe larger span of Homer’s poem, the change serves to accentuate the theme thatdeath is an inevitable part of human life and must be taken in stride (cf. S.L. Schein,The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer’s Iliad [Berkeley and Los Angeles 1984] 161).I owe the rhapsode analogy to Victoria Wohl."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"     here, rather than offering generalizations about sacrifice in the PGMas a whole.My second guideline is that we must remember that anyone grow-ing up in an ancient Mediterranean culture would have had an in-stinctive awareness and understanding of ritual patterns. Although noone would have articulated these patterns in anything like the man-ner that we do as scholars, a lifetime of participation would have ledthe average man or woman to expect that, however much the detailschanged, proper rituals would follow certain lines. Thus, when westudy the spells of the PGM, we should expect to find patterns that arefamiliar to us from our study of ancient religion, even if certain detailsseem odd for the reasons I mentioned just above. Finding those pat-terns is essential to understanding how, if at all, these “magical” ritu-als differ from religious rituals.Corollary to this is my assumption that the practitioners of thePGM did not intentionally reverse normal ritual patterns or practicessimply for the sake of reversal itself. It is true that as scholars lookingat these rituals from the outside, we sometimes notice what look likereversals—the killing of animals not found in sacrifices to Olympiangods, for example, or the performance of sacrifices at night, or theconsumption of sacrificial food alone rather than in a community—but I shall argue that the appearance of reversal or distortion is justan incidental effect, and that when a practitioner innovated upon anestablished ritual, he understood himself not to be reversing or dis-torting it but rather to be enhancing aspects of it that were particu-larly important, or extending what he understood to be its underlyingideology in a new direction.7 To my mind, intentional reversal ordistortion of rituals typically occurs in only three types of situations,none of which fit the circumstances under which the rituals of the7Contra Graf, Magic, esp. 229-32 (e.g., “In the course of this analysis, we havecome across a number of those reversals that characterize magic and especiallymagical ritual—intentional inversions of everyday practices or ordinary ritual...themagician’s isolation in the performance of the rite, the specific form taken by theserites and the role played by the infernal divinities...can be seen as so many revers-als.”) and idem, “The Magician’s Initiation,” Helios 21.1 (1994) 161-78 (hereaftercited as Graf, “Initiation,”), specifically 169-70. Cf. however, Graf’s earliest publica-tion on magic, “Prayer in Magic and Religious Ritual,” in Faraone and Obbink ascited in n. 1, 188-213, esp. 195-97, where he also presents the magician as one whopurposefully reverses or opposes ordinary (civic) religion, but at one point adds (p.196) an important phrase (italics are mine): “...the magician who performs this ritualputs himself in opposition to the more frequent way of Greek ritual practice—but notit should be underlined, to religion as such.”"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"   ‒    PGM were developed and performed. The first is a carnivalesquesetting, which usually is associated with a period during which normalrules are rescinded. It is important to note that carnivalesque revers-als and distortions almost always happen within a public context. Thereversal or distortion is enacted in front of an audience—sometimesthat audience is the actors themselves, sometimes it is the society atlarge. The practitioner of the PGM works alone or occasionally witha single person who acts as his assistant or apprentice:8 his only audi-ence is the gods and the demons upon whom he calls. Similar to thecarnivalesque use of reversal and distortion are their somewhat moreserious use as means of mocking or criticizing the status quo9—but hereagain, an audience or at least an expanded circle of participants isusually the case—otherwise, what is the point of the mockery?Finally, reversals and distortions occur when a practitioner wishesto secure the help of an entity who opposes the god towards whomthe rites are normally directed—it is the mark of the Satanist ofpopular imagination, for example, who believes that he pleases hismaster by mocking God with an inverted version of the Christianmass. Even here we might talk of audiences, in fact, since Satan, andperhaps also God, are expected to take note of what the Satanistdoes. Outside of a dualistic religious system, this third type of reversalor distortion is very uncommon precisely because there is no other“god” to whom a worshipper can turn—everyone in the society hasto deal with the same pantheon of gods and demons and the only waythat one can gain greater power, therefore, is by figuring out betterways to please, persuade or compel them. In a system that is notdualistic—as is the case in most ancient Mediterranean religions—itwould be surprising to find a practitioner who profoundly changedwhat generations of his society had found to be successful methods of8Isolation of the magician: e.g., PGM I.130-32 and 192-94; III.616 and 693;IV.57, 734-50 and 850-56. The phenomenon is discussed by Graf, “Initiation,” 166-67, but cf. also idem, “How to Cope with a Difficult Life,” in P. Schäfer and H.Kippenberg as cited in note 3, 93-114, p. 103, where he changes his opinion.9One instance of this from ancient Greece—the only one that I am aware of—was brought to my attention by F. Graf, who notes that Lys. fr. 5.2 mentions a groupof Athenian young men who called themselves the “kakodaimonistai,” or “devoteesof the evil daimon(es),” and met once a month at the time of the new moon tomock (katagelô) the gods and their laws. The new moon was traditionally the time atwhich Athenians took pains to appease and avert evil daimones (see S.I. Johnston,Restless Dead: Encounters between the living and the dead in ancient Greece [Berkeley and LosAngeles: University of California Press: 1999)] [hereafter cited as Johnston, Restless]60-61), thus these young men seem to have mocked society and its values by invert-ing them."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"     approaching the gods.10 The slander spells of the PGM indirectlyconfirm this: the practitioner tries to defame another person and puthim in the bad graces of the gods precisely by alleging that the personhas reversed or distorted rituals.11The first sacrifice that I will examine is from PGM IV.2891-2942.It is rather easy to interpret and offers a good, simple demonstrationof the thesis that I want to test here. The first offering in the spell,which is made to the Star of Aphrodite, consists of pellets (kollouria)made of white dove’s blood and fat, untreated myrrh and parchedartemisia. One or more of these pellets are to be burnt on vinewood(lines 2891-95).The ingredients of the pellets are meant to be pleasing. The doveis Aphrodite’s favorite animal; myrrh smells good. Judging from itsother uses in the PGM, artemisia also has positive connotations.12 Theoffering aligns with standard practice therefore: to win a god’s coop-eration, one burns something nice. The spell varies from traditionalsacrifice, however, in offering pellets that incorporate animal matter—the blood and fat of a dove—instead of offering that animal itself.This might well be a matter of efficiency: once he had manufacturedthem, the practitioner could store these pellets away until a clientasked him to perform a love spell—to return to my cooking meta-phor, it would be a bit like making a large batch of spaghetti sauce allat once and freezing individual portions for later use. The pelletswould be economical, too: one could reap the benefits of sacrificing adove for the cost of a pellet or two.1310European magicians of later times did deliberately reverse and distort Christianritual in order to win the support of Satan and his demons—at least so far as we canjudge from some of the documents they left behind (for example, Acta et DiplomataGraeca Medii Aevi Sacra and Profana, ed.

In some other cases artemisia seems tofunction merely as a binding agent, for instance, in inks: I.245, II.17 and 35;IV.2143, 2237, 3200; 438 and 417. The single case where artemisia has a negativeconnotation is IV.2688, where it is an ingredient in a coercive offering.13The making of pellets like these is is also found at PGM IV.1316 and 2682 andat PDM xiv. 93-114 (see esp. lines 98-100).

This is a familiar trick:elsewhere in the PGM, the brains of other animals are similarly usedin compulsive procedures.14 We cannot be sure why animal brains areused in these procedures15 (nor, in this specific case, can we be surewhy it is the brain of a vulture16 rather than any other animal). Evenso, the general outlines of the compulsive offering are clear: if pleas-ing things delight the gods when burnt, unpleasant things such asbrains will make them uncomfortable and perhaps, therefore, willmake them willing to cooperate with the practitioner lest he makethem more uncomfortable yet. The ideology that underlies the proce-dure is traditional, and simply has been extended along logical lines:all materials can be burnt in order to send messages to the gods—unpleasant as well as pleasant.17 The practitioner of our spell does not14PGM II.1-64 (brains of a black ram and an ibis), IV.1275-1322, VII.528-39(brain of a black ram in both cases).15We might begin to interpret the use of brains in compulsive spells by remember-ing that during the highest-quality method of mummification in the New Kingdom,according to Herodotus (2.86) as much as possible of the brain was pulled out of theskull through the nostrils peicemeal and any residue was rinsed out with drugs.Herodotus’ description of the process has been confirmed by inspection of survivingmummies. As far as I can establish, neither Herodotus nor any other ancient source,Greek or Egyptian, mentions any process of treating or preserving fragments ofbrain, nor has any brain or brain material been found preserved in canopic jars.(Before the New Kingdom, the brain was simply allowed to dry up inside the skull ofthe mummy.) In short, the brain seems to have been considered superfluous mate-rial—something worthless or even undesirable, like the dung that the practitioneraccuses others of burning in slander spells (e.g., PGM IV.2586 and 2651). AncientEgyptian medical texts attach no importance to the brain and focus instead on theheart as the director of bodily functions. See S. Ikram and A. Dodson, The Mummy inAncient Egypt: Equipping the Dead for Eternity (London 1998) 118; B. Brier, EgyptianMummies: Unraveling the Secrets of an Ancient Art (New York 1994) 59-63, 91, 154, 262; C.Andrews, Egyptian Mummies (London 1984) 15-16; S.J.

White rams are standard sacrifices to the Sun; by usingthe most offensive part of the inverse of the sacrifice that pleases the Sun, perhaps thepractitioner tries to make things as unpleasant for the god as he can. By analogy, wemight guess that vultures or the goddess with whom they were most often associ-ated—Nekhbet—stood in some opposition to either Aphrodite or the Egyptian god-dess with whom she most often was equated, Hathor, although I have not been ableto confirm this.17This point about compulsive fumigations was made also by Graf, Magic 230-31."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"     deliberately reject traditional practices, then; rather, he creativelyextends them.My second example, PGM IV.1390-1495 is entitled “Spell of at-traction performed in the presence of [i.e., “with the help of”] heroesor gladiators or those who have died a violent death.” The practi-tioner is supposed to save bread from his own meal, divide it intoseven pieces and throw it out at a place where people have diedviolently, as an offering to their ghosts (lines 1390-95). Later in thespell, we learn that he also wishes to invoke the untimely dead whenhe throws the bread; the untimely were another type of restless dead,and thus like the violently dead, they would be particularly likely tohelp him (lines 1402, 1420).18 While he throws the morsels of bread,the practitioner is to declare to the ghosts that he is giving them foodleftover from his client’s very own meal (line 1405)19 and then askthem to haunt and torture a woman until she falls in love with hisclient.One of two things normally happen when edible material is of-fered to non-human entities: either the mortal shares the food withthe entities to whom he offers it by eating a portion after giving aportion to them, or he abstains from the food completely, giving all ofit to them. In Greece and Rome, the latter practice is especiallycommon when the entities receiving the offering are associated withthe world of the dead. At first glance, then, our spell seems to invertnormal rules: for one thing, the practitioner eats his portion before therecipients of the offering do, and for another, the practitioner is shar-ing the offering with them despite the fact that they belong to thatgroup of recipients with whom offerings normally are not shared.The ritual, however, is actually a combination of two older, wellestablished practices. The first is that of dedicating any bits of foodthat fall on the ground to the dead. We first hear about this in frag-ments of Aristophanes’ Heroes and Euripides’ Stheneboa but it is prob-ably a much older practice; it is frequently associated with the18On the use of the restless dead in magic, see Johnston, Restless, passim but esp.pp. 71-80.19In other words, he is telling a bit of a lie, for reasons I cannot explain; it seemsas if it would have been just as easy to ask his client to save some bread from a meal.Alternatively, we may be dealing with a text that combines two different versions ofthe same spell, in one of which the practitioner was to perform the ritual on his ownbehalf and in the other of which he was assumed to be working it on behalf of aclient."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"  ‒    teachings of Pythagoras.20 The practice varies the traditional chore-ography of formal sacrifice insofar as the recipient of the offering isconsuming his portion of the food after those who are giving it haveconsumed their portions, but this is because these dedications areincidental offerings that occur by happenstance rather than formal,pre-planned sacrifices.Interpretative emphasis should be placed on the establishment ofxenia—that is, of a bond of friendship in which each party was ex-pected to help the other—that inevitably occurred between any twoparties who shared food, including the living and the dead. Ancientcomments indicate that, already in the older cases of dedicating thefallen food to the dead, the idea was to use the food to reestablish orrecall an existing bond of xenia: Athenaeus says that the morsels offood are intended for dead friends (philoi) and Euripides portraysStheneboa as dedicating the fallen food to her beloved Bellerophon,whom she believes is dead.21 In our spell, this bond is emphasizedfirst and foremost by the practitioner’s explicit declaration that themorsels come from his client’s very own meal (line 1407) but it is alsoconveyed by his suggestion that his client, like the ghosts, is suffering:“[My client] has mixed leftovers from his own food with tears and bittergroans so that you, O luckless heroes who are confined in the NN placemay bring success to him who is beset with torments. You who have leftthe light, O you unfortunate ones, bring success to him who is distressedat heart...” (lines 1405-1411)The practitioner does not want to rely on chance in obtaining hisdead accomplices, however—it wouldn’t be good enough to usewhatever ghosts might be hanging around his table when the crumbsfell. Indeed, if the ghosts were his friends, then he would want to avoidthat situation, lest he impose onerous tasks upon them.22 So the prac-20Ar. fr. 320 (ap. D.L. 8.34), Eur. fr. 664 (ap. Athen.

Rohde, Psyche (London 1925 [1898]) 202 n.114.21The presence of this bond is reflected particularly in the fragment fromEuripides cited in the previous note, where Stheneboa, believing her belovedBellerophon to be dead, decrees that any food that falls on the ground should belongto him in particular. Athenaeus, quoting the fragment, specifies that the food usuallyis dedicated to dead friends (philoi).22On the idea that the dead did not enjoy serving the living, and that one there-fore would not wish to impose service on one’s dead friends, see discussion atJohnston, Restless, 75 and n. 114, 78 and n. 128."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"     titioner chooses instead to carefully “create” leftovers that can bethrown on the ground and then take them to a place where he feelscertain of contacting the sort of ghosts he desires. This brings us tothe other age-old practice that our spell adapts: contacting the deadat their graves or at the places where they died. The deposition ofcurse tablets in graves is a well known example of this.23 The story ofhow Epimenides cured a curse that was plaguing Athens is another:after using a magical technique to locate the places were people hadonce been murdered, he ordered sacrifices and other cultic acts to beperformed at those spots to propitiate them.24 Thus, our practitionerhas combined techniques to garner the advantages of each: he wishesto obtain the help of the untimely and violently dead but wishes to doso not by coercing them, as many curse tablets do for example, butrather by winning their willing aid in a friendly manner. This isstandard operating procedure in the PGM: practitioners almost al-ways ask for the help of deities, demons and ghosts politely at first,offering them gifts in most cases, and keep rougher, coercive tech-niques only for emergencies.When we looked beneath the surface of the two spells we haveexamined so far, we discovered that the practitioner had creativelyextended the ideology of traditional sacrifice, but had by no meanscontradicted or reversed it. Things seem more complicated in someother cases, such as my next example, PGM IV.26-51, but even herewe will find that innovation within standard patterns is the rule.One of the first things we recognize in PGM IV.26-51 is a tripartitepattern that aligns with Hubert and Mauss’ paradigm for sacrifice:25the practitioner enters a space that is considered sacred and set apartfrom the normal world—in this case, land that has been recentlywashed by the Nile, where no other mortal yet has trodden (lines 27-23On graves as the favorite place of deposition, see J. Gager, Curse Tablets andBinding Spells from the Ancient World (Oxford 1992) 18-19 and Graf, Magic, 127 (note:the translator of this English version has incorrectly written: “...most of our cursetablets come from tombstones...”; the earlier French and German versions of thebook make it clear that Graf meant “...from graves,” which is correct.24Epimenides: D.L. 1.110 and see discussion at Johnston, Restless, 279-87.

But we face a problem in line 41, where the practitioner istold to drink some of the rooster’s blood as soon as it spurts from therooster’s decapitated body. Drinking blood is not part of sacrificialprocedure in any of the ancient Mediterranean cultures that influ-enced the PGM—indeed, blood-drinking is prohibited in many ofthem. To understand the practitioner’s actions simply as a sacrifice inthe usual sense of the word, therefore, we would have to assume thathe was being intentionally perverse for some reason—perhaps to ali-enate himself from the gods. This seems unlikely not only for thereasons that I mentioned earlier, but also because there is no signelsewhere in the spell that the practitioner wishes to send such amessage.The timing of some of the other actions described in the spell alsoposes problems. After leaving the sacred space, the practitionerbathes and dons new clothes (lines 43-45). If our text specified aparticular type of clothing, we might interpret this as marking a newrank or status into which the practitioner has entered, but as the textsimply says new clothes (kaina) it seems easier to interpret the act ofdonning new clothes and the bathing that precedes it as one of puri-26Although it is significant that it is the untrodden bank of the Nile that has beenchosen as the preferred place for the ritual, the underlying purpose of the choice is toprovide the practitioner with a place that is pure and unsullied by previous humancontact. Compare the technique of placing clean linen or sand or new bricks uponthe floor of a room where a ritual is to take place, e.g., PGM IV.172-73 and 1860 andPDM xiv.62-63 and 283 (where the practitioner is supposed to use clean sandbrought from the banks of the Nile and bricks).27I note here an incorrect, and misleading, translation in the GMPT, which giveslines 44-45 as “...walk backwards out of the water, and, after changing into freshgarments, depart without turning around.” As the translator, Hubert Martin, re-marks in a footnote, the two instructions seem to contradict each other: if the prac-titioner walks away backwards, he will by necessity be turned around (i.e., be lookingtowards the place where the sacrifice was performed, which is to be avoided here, asin other cases in the PGM and in sacrifices to dangerous deities in general). Butaccording to LSJ, the verb that Martin translates as “walk backwards” (anapodizô)means to “walk back,” i.e., to return whence one came or to make another personwalk back (e.g., Luc. Nec. 7, Hdt. 5.92z). This simpler translation obviates any prob-lem. The same correction should be made to E.N. O’Neil’s GMPT translations ofPGM I.37 (and also to Graf’s translation and interpretation of the spell at “Initiation”168) and PGM IV.2493. In both cases, the verb again means simply to leave theplace where a sacrifice was performed. R.F. Hock translates the verb correctly inGMPT for its single remaining use (PGM XXXVI.273)."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"     fication. This seems strange, initially: normally, acts of purificationsoccur before one enters a sacred space or sacred time, not afterwards.The solution must be that the bath and the new clothes signal thatthe practitioner not only is departing from one state or activity as heleaves the area where the rooster was killed but simultaneously isentering into another state or activity, or at least another stage of thesame state or activity. The bath and new clothes also imply that thisnew state or activity requires greater purity than the first one did.The end of the spell will help to clarify what is going on as awhole. After he has left the place where the rooster was killed and hasbathed and put on new clothes, the practitioner performs yet anotheract, the instructions for which consume a full twenty percent of thetext (lines 45-51). He rubs his eyes with an ointment made from andapplied with animal parts. This probably was intended to bring on adirect vision of some god, as similar ointments rubbed on the eyeselsewhere in the PGM explicitly are said to do this.28 If so, then thebulk of the spell as we have it constitutes preparation for its real goal:namely the seeking of a vision at the end.With this hypothesis in mind, let us look more closely at the roost-er’s death. First, we notice that the spell specifies that the practitionermust catch the blood he will drink with his own hand, as soon as itruns out of the rooster’s severed neck (line 41). The touching anddrinking of the dying animal’s blood—a striking symbol of the vitalitythat is leaving its body—can be understood as an act that brings thepractitioner into as close a contact with the essence or pneuma of theanimal as possible. That close physical contact between the practi-tioner and the animal was important is confirmed by the spell’s spe-cific instruction that the practitioner kill the rooster by himself, alone,holding it between his knees as he beheads it (lines 38-40).This emphasis on close physical contact suggests that we shouldtake the title of the spell—teletê— in the sense that teletê and its cog-nates most often are used in the PGM. GMPT translates teletê as “ini-tiation” but the essential meaning of the word is “completion,”“fulfillment” or “perfection.” When “teletê” and its cognates appear inthe magical papyri, they most often mean “perfecting” in the sense ofpreparing an object for use in a ritual.29 This is often accomplished28E.g., PGM IV.774-79, V.54-69, VII.335-47; PDM xiv.295-308, xiv.828-35,xiv.856-75, xiv.875-85, xiv.1110-29.29Graf, “Initiation,” 163-64. I am aware that even “perfection” and “perfecting”do not translate teletê and its verbal cognates completely; the sense of the Greekcannot be captured by any single English word. Nonetheless, I choose to use theclosest English word available, rather than the Greek itself, in order to make thisessay more accessible to non-classicists."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"  ‒    by bringing the object that requires perfection into contact with an-other object, frequently an animal whose life force then is caused topass into it, as in the case of a spell where a stone is perfected bybeing buried for a day within the guts of a sacrificed rooster.30 Thepractitioner’s drinking of the rooster’s blood should not lead us tointerpret the slaughter of the rooster as a corrupted sacrifice, then;rather, it is a sacrifice that has been modified in order to “perfect”something, something that, once perfected, will be used in a subse-quent procedure.31 In this case it is the practitioner himself who is per-fected, which makes sense because it will be the practitioner himself,with his own anointed eyes, who will see the god. The “tool” that thepractitioner must perfect through contact with the rooster is his ownbody.32What are we to make of the fact that the practitioner puts theremains of the rooster’s body on the burning altar after he hasbrought himself into close association with its blood (line 42)? This30PGM XII.307-316. Cf. PGM XII.201-69, where a ring is perfected by beingheld in the smoke of burning birds that have been sacrificed, and IV.2889, where aphylactery is perfected by being dipped in the blood of a person untimely dead. Cf.also IV. 2145-2240, where a magical plaque is perfected in a process that includessacrificing a white rooster (although it is not specified how the plaque and the roostercome into contact). In other cases, objects are perfected by having sacrifices per-formed in front of them (e.g., XII.14-95, perfection of a statue of Eros).31The choice of animal is significant in this respect. The setting of the spell atsunrise suggests that it was a direct vision of the Sun himself that was sought; this issupported by the fact that there are quite a few other spells for making contact withthe Sun in the PGM and by the centrality of the Sun, in either his Greek or hisEgyptian persona, to many forms of esoteric as well as public cult during the ImperialAge, particularly as a god who could reveal hidden knowledge (e.g., PGM II.64-183,III.633-731, IV.475-829 [the “Mithras Liturgy”] and 930-1114). The rooster is thefirst creature to announce the rising of the Sun each day and thus could be under-stood as the animal who sees the Sun best; white roosters are a common offering tothe Sun in other spells of the papyri (e.g., PGM II.64-183 [esp. 74-76], PGM III.633-731 [esp. 694-95] and cf. Procl. CMAG VI.150.1 and 15, where the rooster is con-nected with the Sun) and were considered sacred (hieros) to the Sun even as early asPythagoras, according to one of his symbola (see Suda s.v. Pythagora ta symbola §235.) Tobe consecrated by the essence of the rooster, then, could be interpreted as beingimbued with the power to see the Sun oneself.32Analogous sequences (i.e., elaborate preparation of the practitioner’s body and/or soul prior to the performance of a ritual that will result in the actual goal of thespell) occur elsewhere in the papyri. A particularly good example is PGM IV.154-285, where the practitioner undergoes a mock death, from which he emerges “armedwith a magical soul” (magikên psychên echôn hoplistheis, lines 210-211), changes into whiteclothing and thus has “become perfected through this encounter [with Helios] as alord of godlike nature” (isotheou physeôs kurieusas tês dia tautês tês systaseôs epiteloumenês,lines 220-21). Then the practitioner passes on to the ritual that accomplishes “directvision through lecanomancy” that is the real goal of the spell (lines 222-85)."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"     action looks like traditional sacrifice: by burning the animal, particu-larly on an altar that has been as carefully constructed as this one has(lines 30-34), the practitioner delivers the animal to the god in whosehonor the rite is being performed. But this is not really surprising fortwo reasons: first, one would need to get rid of the rest of that roosterin some way, after all, and burning it upon an altar is a means ofdisposal that has the advantage of pleasing the god. (Disposing of therooster’s head by tossing it into the Nile instead of burning it on thealtar [line 40] follows what the Greeks thought was a standard Egyp-tian procedure.33) Second, we must remember what I emphasized inmy earlier remarks. The rituals in the PGM are neither completelynew nor gratuitously odd innovations; rather, they are modifications ofestablished rituals, enacted with specific purposes in sight. If one wishesto kill an animal—either in order to perfect oneself or for some otherreasons—centuries of ideology would demand that the killing be donesacrificially.As I have portrayed him in this essay, the practitioner described inthe spells of PGM IV neither ignored traditional rituals nor reversedor corrupted them; rather, he was a “creative conservator” of tradi-tional rituals, using his expert knowledge of the sacred to extend themin ways that preserved their underlying ideologies. Notably, my por-trait aligns very nicely with attempts by ancient authors to isolate acategory of ritual specialist that approaches what we usually call amagician. Apuleius states it most directly in his Apology: the magus hasan enhanced ability to communicate with the gods, is unusually inter-ested in the workings of providence within the cosmos and worshipsthe gods excessively.34 But there are earlier instances of this idea aswell: Hippocrates says that ritual healers who rely on purificationsand incantations—what we might call “magical” healers—claim tohave an enhanced knowledge of the divine.35 The author of Dervenicommentary derides professional initiators who claim to have madespecial knowledge of the sacred their craft; as I have argued in depthelsewhere, this sort of initiator and at least one type of Greek practi-tioner we might call a magician, the goês, were often the same person.Plato tells us that wandering practitioners who specialized in cursetablets claimed to have a finely honed ability to interpret the will ofthe gods.36 Empedocles and Epimenides, too, combined reputations33Hdt. 2.39.1-2 and Plut. de Is. 31 (363b-c).34Apul.

Of these, some are also pragmatic. Theophrastus,in the Enquiry into Plants, says it is a sensible and rational precaution tocut certain roots, particularly qayiva, from downwind, and to firstanoint the body with oil, blocking the root’s caustic fumes and juicesfrom contact with the skin and nasal passages.6 But this advice isimmediately followed in Theophrastus’ text by his criticism of other,more colorful practices which he considers “irrelevant” (ejpivqeta),7some of which reappear, much later, in PGM materials.8 In thesepractices, which include the planting of ‘replacement’ seeds, buryingof cakes, and invocation to the plant,9 we see more than practicalityand safety issues at work, but rather, a second category of ingredientemployed by PGM rituals. This is the designated or consecratedplant, whose creation as an herb for a certain purpose is controlled bythe rituals performed at its “birth,” when it is picked and effectivelytransformed into something else. For example, in PGM IV 3172-3208, a spell for producing a dream oracle, the practitioner needsthree reeds (kalavmoi) which have been carefully prepared by a seriesof elevations, spinnings, repetitions of “magical names” and vowels(with different sequences for each of the three reeds), and direct ad-dress to the reeds: ai[rw se, i{na moi ojneiroqaupthvsh/\"—“I pick you toget a dream;” and ai[rw se ejpi; poia;n pra'xin—“I pick you for this5See especially John Scarborough, “The Pharmacology of Sacred Plants, Herbsand Roots,” in Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion, ed.

It is only after these prepa-rations that the reeds are “ready,” and the ritual can proceed. Thereed is a very common plant and is clearly described by Theophrastusand other ancient herbalists, who ascribe to it no medicinal purpose.But in this ritual, the reed is not consumed,11 and is therefore beingused in a way that can have nothing to do with the plant’s intrinsicqualities. Reeds are called for by several other PGM recipes, servinga variety of simple, ancillary functions: as a tool,12 as a pen,13 and asa bed.14 Although the reed itself is not one of the elaborate, rare, andpowerful substances that are associated with the stereotype “magic,”its elaborate preparation in this spell makes it into something else, notjust a reed, but a “power reed.” As such, it becomes more special andtherefore more rare than its fellow reeds that are unprepared; muchas a simple cloth or vial of water can become much more religiouslyimportant to some believers through ritual consecration or contactwith, e.g., a saint’s tomb. Like such objects, the special reeds areindistinguishable from unprepared reeds, at least until the final stageof writing upon them.15The third major category, which appears most often and mostconsistently, consists of substances that are almost always and every-where part of the worship of the gods: aromatic gums and incenses,such as frankincense, myrrh, and storax, olive oil (for burning, steep-ing and anointing), wine, honey, etc. While the aromatic gums were10Although these texts use the language of “picking,” the instructions call for thereeds to actually be picked before sunrise, with the invocations being recited “aftersunset.”11In fact, even very pharmacologically active substances can fall into this categoryif they are not consumed, or are consumed in submicroscopic doses, as in the drink-ing of water into which words have been washed—the pharmacological power of thecomponents of the ink in which the words were written is surely negligible.12PGM IV 52-85, XXXVI 231-55, as a stick from which to suspend something;VII 186-90, for cutting off a gecko’s foot.13PGM V 304-69; XXXVI 264-74—metal pens are much more common.14PDM xiv 117-49.15Other examples: PDM xiv 554-626, a large block of medical spells that uselengthy invocations to the substances themselves, especially oil, which are then ap-plied to the patient; PGM I 42-195, a spell to gain “an assistant,” the end of the textsays that the assistant will bring “wild herbs” (190). These may be supposed tosuggest weird substances, but they may just be common substances that are specialbecause they come from the assistant.

Such items therefore, though “spe-cial,” would be readily available throughout the Mediterranean, andcould be purchased openly and without great problem, except fortheir expense. Though they sometimes appear in PGM used instrange and unique ways, in general they are part of creating a pureand “religious” atmosphere for the welcoming of whatever gods orspirits the practitioner hoped to meet.The fourth major type of ingredient called for in spell recipes is therelatively exotic substance with no ordinary role in the lives of tem-ples or domestic shrines, which may or may not have any pharmaco-logical effect in itself or in the way it is used. This is an extremelyvaried category, including everything from mule hairs, lizards, dung,etc., to magical material and the burial sites of murdered gladiators,etc. Because each substance appears infrequently in the corpus over-all, most of them only once, it is very hard to get a sense of its usefrom repeated examples, as one can with, e.g., frankincense or myrrh.While some of them seem bizarre, many others are herbs, plants,animals and stones which are simply uncommon or are used in unu-sual ways. These problematic substances form the category of ingre-dients that, in both ancient literature and in modern popular imagin-ing, is most closely associated with the stereotype of “magic.”Discussion and analysis of these substances is complicated by sev-eral factors, including regional variation in names used for plants,animals and stones, and uncertainty about a shared vocabulary be-16Even though Ethiopia is technically close to Egypt, trade between the twocountries was hampered by the Nile cataracts. Goods from Ethiopia thereforereached Egypt and the rest of the Mediterranean via the same ports and way-stationsused for trade with Arabia Felix, India and the Far East. This contributes to confu-sion in ancient sources about the ultimate origin of many imported substances, whichappear to come from, e.g., Arabia or Alexandria, because those places were impor-tant transfer or processing points.

For example, PGM IV475-829 requires an herb “called kentritis.”18 The text carefully de-scribes this plant, 19 and provides a test for its authenticity.20 Othertimes, the anticipated problem seems to be linguistic. In the Demoticvisionary spell PDM xiv 117-49, a recipe for an eye ointment calls fora certain plant whose name is written in Coptic, the only phrase inthe spell to appear in Coptic other than magical names; the plant isthen described and the reader is told which merchant in the market-place would be likely to have it—the lupin or wreath seller.21 Else-where in PDM xiv a number of plants are listed with their nameswritten both in Demotic and Greek22—more on those later. Anothermotivation for this is the author or scribe’s awareness of one or morealternative manuscripts that give different names for particular sub-stances.23Recipes also sometimes specify geographical sources for the re-quired substances. For some purposes, it seems, it was important tohave not only, e.g., figs, which grow in several places around theMediterranean, but Karian figs.24 These requirements may some-times actually refer to the way a thing is made, and not necessarily itspoint of origin. For example, “Egyptian wine“25 and “Mendesianwine“26 are specified several times. This may connect to the require-17A further level of complication for the modern interpreter is introduced bycriticisms of plant identifications in our primary resource, the Greek Lexicon of Liddel,Scott, and James: Scarborough, “Pharmacology,” n. 2 on p. 163; Richard J.

The level of detail inPGM II 1-64 may be there to avert any confusion with this substance—or it mayreveal a compositional “layer” and a literal-minded scribe.40There are many other such examples, but I have chosen these because they arerelatively unambiguous—they do not appear in contexts that suggest “coded” orcolloquial plant names."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":", ,       actly these specific substances is, I think, indicated by the fact that thesame spells are capable of being vague or “loose” about other sub-stances. For example, PGM VII 186-190 calls for the severed rightfront foot of a tomb-inhabiting, blood eating gecko; a very specificdescription; but the practitioner is required to cut off the foot simplywith a reed, a moderately to vaguely specific instruction (reed, but nottype of reed). The same spell that calls for a copper nail from ashipwrecked vessel refers to magical material so vaguely that we can-not tell whether it comes from the victim or the practitioner; etc., etc.In all of these instances where the texts provide descriptive infor-mation or a variety of names for a substance, the effect is to clarifyand further specify what it is, not to code or obscure it. When a singlespell expresses itself generally about some substances, and very spe-cifically about others, the choice of one over the other is an importantindication that the author of the text (or the seller of the spell or thespell book) seriously intends the use of that particular substance, andintends to create the impression—whether he himself believes it ornot—that only that substance will bring the desired effect.Authors of these texts may have felt it important that only particu-lar substances be used, but it is not always easy for the modern readerto know whether a variety of names refer to a single item, or whetherseveral items are being denoted by the same name. The preservedmagical handbooks do not use a consistent vocabulary for the de-scription of ingredients, and this can lead to frustration and to realproblems in the interpretation of a given spell text. For example, onlytwo texts, PGM XIII 1-334 (22 and 228) and XXXVI 320-32 use asubstance called o[robo\", vetch or bean. In the first instance, the EighthBook of Moses,41 the o[robo\" is clearly not an actual bean, but a bean-sized lump or ball the practitioner is supposed to make out of theseven incenses just named. This particular text does know a variety ofmanuscripts, and here cites one of them, which apparently calls theselumps of incense a “solar bean,” (o[robo\" hJliako;\") and says it is goodfor every purpose. The main author (apparently) now returns andsays that this o[robo\" refers to “The Egyptian Bean,” kuvamo\"41This particular text presents many problems of this kind. For example PGMXIII 734-1077, the “third version of the book,” calls for “navel of crocodile”. But thetext immediately says “he means pondweed,” (potamogeivtwna\"); how then to interpretthe requirement of korkodeivlou ajfodeuvmati in XIII 245-46, the “applications” sectionof the “first version” of the same book? And how then do we interpret the otherappearance of potamogeivtwna\" (PGM IV 1275-1322)?"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"  ‒    Aijguvptio\", a term he apparently expects to be more familiar—as in-cense—than o[robo\" hJliako;\". Since both times the word o[robo\" ap-pears in PGM XIII it is specifically connected with these incenses, itsmeaning is relatively unambiguous in that text. In the second in-stance, from PGM XXXVI 320-32 (a contraceptive recipe), ojrovboiare “taken” (not made), steeped inside the genitals of a menstruatingwoman, then extracted and fed to a frog which is released alive; therest of the spell lists many other animal and botanical ingredients thatare gathered and worn in a fawnskin amulet. Are the orovboi here tobe literally understood as “vetch seeds,” or are they the same lumpsof blended incense, appearing here with no key, possibly because theauthor or scribe felt this to be obvious? In his discussion of this recipein Magika Hiera, John Scarborough takes them as literal vetch seeds,since they, along with henbane, are the only pharmaceutically activesubstances in the recipe.42 It is important to note, however, that thehenbane is only in the amulet bag, and that the orovboi, though com-ing into contact with a woman’s body through “steeping,” are notconsumed by her; moreover, since the language of the spell maysuggest a male contraceptive (“the only one in the world”) rather thana female one,43 the orovboi are removed even further from physical—or pharmaceutical—contact with the beneficiary of the spell. Theother directions in the recipe are not determinative, as these uncom-fortable procedures could be carried out with either real vetch seedsor incense balls.44 The question is one of context: whether the termshould be interpreted in terms of another PGM recipe, or simply interms of ancient botany and modern pharmacology. With these infre-quently-occurring ingredients, there is usually little to guide this deci-sion, but it has an enormous effect on the evaluation of the nature ofa text, the social world it presumes, and the kind of activity it de-scribes.Identification and interpretation of PGM substances is hinderedeven further by the small section of so-called Priestly Interpretations42Scarborough, “Pharmacology,” 158.43Seeds are required in the number of years “you” wish to remain sterile, subjectmodified by ajsuvnlhmpto\"; but you then let “her” steep them. Whether it is a male orfemale contraceptive depends on how one takes the ambiguous phrase brexavtw aujta;eij\" th'n fuvsin eJauth'\".44Although both vetch and incenses would probably ultimately be toxic for thefrog, it is not clear how much more irritating incenses would be to the woman. Itshould be noted that this spell is preceded and followed by spells clearly involvingmyrrh, one of the incenses.

PGM XII 401-44 presents itself as eJrmhneuvmata ...meqhrmhneumevna, “translated interpretations,” a key to false and mis-leading names used by holy scribes in temples to hide the real sub-stances they used in their rituals. This introduction, correctly recog-nizing that many ancient Egyptian monuments are covered in holytexts, claims that those who inscribed them have used this code tech-nique “because of the curiosity of the masses” (dia; th;n tw'n pollw'nperiergivan), who presumably might try to go home and perform therituals independently. Note that this method will not prevent anyonefrom actually “performing magic,”47 but only from getting any result,due to use of improper and ineffective ingredients.48This particular text “de-codes” only one and possibly two sub-stances that are actually called for in PGM recipes, so in itself itconfuses the issue in relatively few cases. The troubling possibility thatit introduces, however, is that there were several or many such lists orcorrespondences, and that those who collected these texts or per-formed these rituals deliberately coded the substances they used, ei-ther to protect the world in the event of the book falling into thewrong hands, or to impress and demand higher prices from anyonewho might be purchasing a spell and its required ingredients (orboth).49 People would probably be willing to pay more for a bottle45PGM XII 401-44.46PGM XIII 166-7.47GMP 167; trans. H.D.

It also seems to assume that hieroglyphicscript was legible to “the masses” at some point in history, which is not likely. Theissue of literacy in Egypt, in all of its languages and scripts, is an enormous one; seeRoger S. Bagnall, Egypt in Late Antiquity (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,1993), 230-60; J.D. Ray, “Literacy and Language in Egypt in the Late and PersianPeriods,” in Literacy and Power in the Ancient World, ed. Alan K. Bowman and GregWoolf (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 51-66.49Scarborough’s assumption, that these were simply “divine names given to ordi-nary herbs ... names taken for granted by priests, scribes, and probably the commonpeople ...” (“Pharmacology,” 159-60) is contradicted by the absence of any of thesenames from PGM materials, with the four exceptions discussed below. His analogy isto the complicated incense ku'fi, but in the case of the Priestly Interpretations, thedefinitions/recipes are clearly not to complex preparations, but to single items.Scarborough here is apparently trying to make the text work two opposite ways—asboth deliberate hiding, and as regional dialect variation."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"   ‒    labeled “navel of male crocodile” than one labeled plain old “river-side weeds;”50 but PGM XIII 1065 says that these are the same thing.If any substance called for beyond the most common ingredientsmust be suspected of hiding the name of a simple plant or herb, thenthe possibility of gleaning certain kinds of information about socialand geographical location, cultural context, expense, and the com-mercial and religious transactions represented by these texts is seri-ously undermined. It may ultimately prove impossible to derive infor-mation of this kind from PGM materials, but before the attempt isabandoned, a reconsideration and methodological analysis of thisproblematic text is in order.These Priestly Interpretations have formed part of the recent effortin scholarship to understand PGM materials in the context of the richvariety of religious attitudes and practices of Greco-Roman antiquity,rather than as freakish or “degenerated” examples of either bad sci-ence or of exploitative charlatans on the fringes of a religiously emptyworld. Many excellent studies have appeared showing the strong con-nections between elements of PGM materials and other texts andtraditions traditionally considered more “normative:” Greco-Romanmystery religions, ancient Near Eastern practices, early Jewish vision-ary literature, Christian Gnosticism, and especially, ancient Egyptianand Greco-Egyptian temple practices. These studies have surveyeddeities, ideas, and linguistic features, as well as the substances, ani-mals and objects in these texts that reflect one or another of theseother traditions. Wax,51 lamps that have not been painted red,52mice,53 lizards,54 the techniques of herb gathering, etc., have all beenrelated to the functioning and symbolism of Egyptian temple life.Through this work our understanding of these materials has so farpassed the prejudices and stereotypes of earlier scholarship that eventhe use of the term “magic” to describe them has become problem-50see above, n. 41.51Robert K.

It may be possible that in the effort toexorcise this unhelpful caricature from modern scholarship, an “over-correction” has occurred which may obscure something particularabout PGM materials, especially recipes, and may interpret it awaythrough use of a text that, on close scrutiny, itself presents hugeproblems in interpretation.The text in question begins in column 12 of the papyrus. Both thelist and the introduction are indented with relation to the previousspell, but in line with the magic names that are part of the eroticinsomnia spell 376-96, indented to accommodate a figure. The listitself continues into column 13, which it fills completely, bringing thescribe to his next exemplar, the Demotic text that begins in column14. This may indicate that the list, its introduction, or both, wereloose at the time of copying and that the scribe of PGM XII hascombined them.56 The change to a new language (Demotic) and to anew text at the top of col. 14 is an even stronger indication that atsome point in transmission, the Priestly Interpretations were eitherloose or appeared at the end of the Greek formulary that is containedin the first 13 columns of PGM XII. The ends of manuscripts are ofcourse notorious “grandmother’s attics” where all sorts of things arelikely to turn up. This text may not really pertain the to the formularythat precedes it; in fact, the introduction may not even pertain to thelist.55These studies have contributed greatly to the contextual understanding of thepapyri themselves, as well as to the scholarly repertoire of ways of thinking aboutreligion. However, methodologically we are once again skating pretty close to theboards of the “clear light that shone o’er Greece/Rome”—because Greek and Ro-man cultures are only “borrowers” of strange religious elements, which actuallyderive from, i.e., standard Egyptian temple practice or from immigrants living intheir lands.56Or, the combination of loose leaves may have occurred earlier, and the scribe ofPGM XII simply re-produces the line lengths and breaks form his exemplar exactly."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"  ‒    The introduction’s claim that the interpretations have been com-piled from “many copies” may be borne out by the chaos we find inthe list that follows, which at some level of transmission prior to itsreproduction in PGM XII may have been put together from looseleaves or fragments of varying sizes assembled in random order. Thelist itself is in two parallel columns, the left hand column for the mostpart giving bizarre and impossible-seeming substances, all body parts,fluids, or other products from humans, animals, insects and deities;and the right hand column, the supposed interpretations, listing forthe most part simple plants and herbs. There is no discernible patternto the organization of the pairs, though chunks of column B seem topreserve a very rough sort of Greek alphabetical order: 414-423 orpossibly 424; 433-440, taking kanqavrou and kavrdia as the lemmatafor lines 437 and 438; and 441-444 are the most noticeable examples.The preservation of this order at some level of copying may accountfor the complete lack of order in column A.57Column A, the “substances requiring explanation,” consists ofphysical material from both mortal and immortal beings.

Other than thevaguely alphabetic chunks in col. B, the list appears to be in random order.58The chnalwphx, which is, according to LSJ, a specifically Egyptian variety ofgoose.59coirogruvllo\" is an extremely rare word, appearing, apparently, only here and inBiblical and related texts, where it translates (in LXX Lev 11:4-6) the Hebrew“shafan,” which is itself a rare word of uncertain meaning, which became the famous“rock badger,” because the shafan is among rocks in Ps. 104:18.

Some of the ani-mals mentioned are particularly associated with some of these deities,for example, the baboon with Hermes-Thoth, etc. The Egyptianflavor of this list is very evident. But it is important to remember thatthese are the substances being explained away—their presence in thispart of the list marks them specifically as false names and un-neces-sary items.Only one of these items, ai|ma kunokefavlou, is clearly called forelsewhere in PGM materials. The kunokevfalo\" appears in variousinvocations and descriptions of gods and apparitions,61 is used severaltimes as a shape for a figure in wax,62 and provides a model languagefor the pronunciation of certain vowels and words.63 There are, how-ever, only four direct requests for it as an ingredient in recipes, and ofthese, only one is unambiguous. The dung and magical material ofthe kunokevfalo\" are required by the two related erotic slander spellsinvolving Selene, PGM IV 2441-2621 and 2622-2707; and its bloodand heart are required by PGM XIII 316 and 1067 (these two arealso related since they are variants of the same text, the Eighth Book ofMoses). The slander spells call for the dung and magical materialspecifically, but in each case, the poetic invocation selections of thespell claim that not the practitioner, but the blasphemous victim, isusing these substances in improper and evil rites. They thereforefunction as examples of something that the goddess would feel that itis horrible to use, and this is supposed to make her like the victim lessand the practitioner more. These two examples are rare in that sim-pler variations of the blasphemous, god-angering substances in theslander poems are in fact actually called for in the recipe sections thatcome later in the texts; but except for that they fall into a subcategoryof truly bizarre and actually fictional substances, such as the piercedvagina of a black sphinx,64 which appear only in incantations and notin actual recipes.6561PGM IV 1003, 1687; VII 782; VIII 10, 29; its birth as a result of sacrilege, inSelene slander spells: IV 2600; 2663; part of a vision: XIII 154f, 464f.62PGM IV 3139; VIII 53.63PGM IV 1006f; V 27; XIII 84, 596.64PGM IV 2310.65Some examples: PGM III 494-611; IV 94-153, IV 2241-2358, IV 2622-2707; V213-303; VII 222-49, 643-51; VIII 1-63, VIII 64-110; PDM xiv 554-62 (mentionsblood of black dog in prayer, but doesn’t call for it), PDM xiv 636-60 (sun is calledscarab of lapis lazuli, but actually scarab of Mars -a real bug—is used; plain wine isused, but addressed as blood of a wild boar from Syria)."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"  ‒    PGM XIII 316 clearly and specifically calls for ai|ma kunokefavlouas a recipe ingredient for one of the long series of “applications” thatfollow the first version of the Eighth Book of Moses, this one for sendingdreams. The practitioner must write the dream he wants to send onhieratic papyrus with myrrh ink and baboon’s blood, then roll up thepapyrus and use it as a wick. Myrrh and the blood are both required,but specified separately. At the end of the third version of the EighthBook of Moses, a shorter series of applications includes one for openingdoors that calls for a baboon’s heart, but here, in the same passagethat “interprets” crocodile navel as riverweeds, the heart is immedi-ately interpreted by a parenthetical phrase which makes it equivalentto myrrh or perfume of lilies, or both.66 This last reference then doesnot parallel 316, since there myrrh and baboon material are calledfor separately, and therefore are probably not the same thing.Other references in PGM materials make clear that related words,kunokefalivdion and kunokefavlion67 are in fact words for plants. Fourspells call for these plants,68 a fairly high number in this particularcategory. The words are attested as plant names in other ancientliterature, though mostly through scholia that say it is equivalent tosome other plant; the LSJ entries actually describe these other plants.The lexicographical situation for these words is incredibly compli-cated, but the main point is that there is no apparent mysterioussecret about kunokefavlion and related words representing plants. Noauthority lists a[nnhqo\", dill, as one of the correspondences as thePriestly Interpretations do. Of these testimonies, only Pliny discussesa religious role (he calls it a magical role) for the plant.69 He claims tohave heard from Apion the Grammarian, notorious resident ofEgypt, that the herb cynocephalia is known in Egypt as osiritis, and isbelieved to be a source of divination and a protection against blackmagic.70 There are no calls for any plant osiritis in PGM, and theword is not attested in other ancient literature, although the lexico-graphical situation there is also tortuous. The main point is that Pliny66PGM XIII 1066: labw;n ... wjo;n kanqavrou kai; kunokefavlou kardivan (zmuvrnan levgei,krivninon muvron) ... It is unclear whether the parenthesis refers to both items, orprovides two possible “translations” for the one item that immediately precedes it.67This form is also used for the shape of the wax figure in PGM VIII 53.68kunokefavlion (GMP trans. “calf-snout plant“): PGM III 479 (visionary); V 198(thief catching), 372 (visionary); kunokefalivdion (GMP trans. “snapdragon“): VII 620(invisibility and erotic).69Natural History xxx.18.70But if you pull it up with bare hands, you will die."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":", ,       knows the name cynocephalia as a fairly common plant name, with avariant in Egypt; again, it is not dill or like dill.There is one other substance in the “to-be-explained” categorythat may be called for in PGM materials. This is govno\" ÔHlivou in line433. Although the form is different, the word hliogonon, written inGreek, appears in the Demotic handbook PDM xiv, the London-Leiden papyrus,71 written along with some other notes in column 1 ofthe verso.72 This section of PDM xiv contains several “clumps” ofdefinitions of stones and plants,73 separated by other notes and shortprescriptions. hliogonon and selhnogonon are followed by the prettyunambiguous statement, “these are herbs.” This list is not presentedas secret, but rather simply appears to provide the Greek names ofherbs, possibly so that the practitioner can shop for them. hliogononand selhnogonon appear also in PGM III 332, where an unfortunatetext break makes it unclear whether the two terms are independentherbs, or descriptive terms modifying single-stemmed wormwood.74The introduction to the Priestly Correspondences certainly createsthe impression that the substances needing interpretation are fre-quently mentioned in holy texts that are prominently displayed, theconditions that necessitate “coding” in the first place. The point of allthis detail above is to demonstrate that the substances in column Aare not in fact called for, except for the one and possibly two excep-tion/s, which are terms already openly known to be plants. Thisagain highlights the mis-match between what the introduction claimsit will do and the list that follows it.The “de-coded” column B includes, out of a list of 37, severalsubstances that are clearly called for elsewhere in PGM as actualrecipe ingredients. Five ingredients are unambiguous: bdevlla is men-tioned several times,75 and ajrtemisiva is very common.76 gavla71Edition, transliteration, and translation: F. Ll.

PDM xiv requires the practitioner to use his ownsemen in an erotic concoction; this may be an example of ajnqrwvpougovno\", but this is a specific call for the practitioner’s magical material,not a general recipe ingredient as in the Priestly interpretations.As I mentioned, there is another sequence of identifications on theverso of PDM xiv. After the hliogonon and selhnogonon discussedearlier, this text discusses five plants,84 three of which, in differentorder and with different spellings, appear at the end of the list ofinterpretations. This may reflect a common source for these two tinyportions of text; if so, once again, the “version” in PDM xiv is notdecoding secrets, but is simply giving the Greek names of the plantsand some brief descriptions of them.As with the left-hand column, therefore, we see that the purpose ofthe introduction is not carried forward by the items in the right-handlist. The introduction claims to reveal de-coded names of substanceswhose use is meant to be secret, but what it does reveal is a list ofthings that are clearly called for any number of times quite openly,under these supposedly de-coded names. The list provides explana-tion where explanation is not needed, and provides mystification77also in PGM VII 222-49; a variation in PGM VIII 64-110.78also in PGM II 232-47.79a variation in PGM XII121-43.80also in PGM XIII 734-1077. wjo;n kanqavrou appears in the same section of PGMXIII (1066) in which navel of crocodile and heart of baboon are also interpreted.Depending on how the parenthetical phrase is taken, wjo;n kanqavrou may itself betranslated by “myrrh.”81Griffith and Thompson identified the chelkbei as trigonella foenumgraecum,which they then translated as “wild garlic.” This botanical name, though, actuallyrepresents fenugreek, which was still used for medicinal purposes in Cairo, under thename “helba,” in this century.82PGM XII 98.83PGM VII 186 (foot); 628 (whole—drowned in lily oil); LXI 40-50 (whole).There’s a strange series of connections here—baboon blood = gecko blood; geckoappears in VII 628 drowned in lily oil; lily oil may “translate” baboon heart in XIII1066.84Four, if we identify crusovspermon with krinanqemon, as John Scarborough ap-pears to do by translating both terms as “houseleek” in GMP—though he does notdiscuss the issue."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":", ,       85rJavmno\" does appear also in PGM III 512, not as a recipe ingredient, but as partof a lengthy descriptive invocation to Helios, which goes through several differenthours, each one of which associates the god with a particular tree, animal and stone.86Another possibility is that the list presents compromises used by Egyptian priestsoperating in locations outside of Egypt—in this case, it would indeed be a secret,private document!! But the fact that our copy of this list does come from Egypt tendsto undercut this idea.rather than clarity. These points may collectively suggest that theintroduction and the list do not belong together, that the list “inter-prets” substances from a formulary that is lost, or that it does notinterpret PGM-style materials at all, but belongs in a quite differentcontext, one that remains unknown.So, what is this text, who created it, what is it doing in PGM XII,and how literally should we take it in the interpretation of PGMrecipes? One approach is to focus upon what the text actually accom-plishes. If the pairs are read from left to right, in the order that itsinterpreters have usually followed, it has the effect of “de-Egyptianizing” the materials required for the performance of theserituals. While the majority of items in the left-hand column appear toreflect or require an Egyptian setting, almost none of those in theright-hand column do. Although most of the items there would prob-ably be available in Egypt, they would be equally available almostanywhere around the Mediterranean, especially as Roman rule pro-gressed. In fact, in at least one case, the “buckthorn” or rJavmno\" in line411, the substance suggests Greece, specifically Attica, much morethan Egypt.85 From this perspective, the correspondences, if takenseriously, actually would tend to dis-empower Egyptian priests, ratherthan to assert their importance. This of course is an exactly oppositeeffect than the introduction to the list intends, which is to locate theorigin of recipes and practices in Egyptian temples, and the keys toritual power in the hands of the temple priests and scribes. It is notimpossible that the list’s original context is not to be found in Egypt,and that it ended up there—and in PGM XII—through some flukeof travel or trade. It may reflect Greco-Roman appropriation ofEgyptian texts and rituals taking place outside of Egypt, with thesubstitutions of plants for the other items taking place as a way toperform rituals independent of the tradition in which they origi-nated.86 If this could be demonstrated, it would provide an interest-ing—and unusual—opportunity to study Greco-Roman input into thetradition that came to be known as “magic.” Unfortunately, becausethe list as we see it today is in a very garbled state, with both the pairs"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"  ‒    and the actual correspondences open to question, analysis of the con-ceptual relationships between the two columns cannot really progressvery far. Additionally, this view fails to explain the fact that column Amaterials are not in fact usually called for in such rituals—the substi-tutions are not needed.There is another, opposite situation in which the list would in factdo what the introduction says it will do. If the columns as we seethem are actually intended to be read from right to left, or even if bysome scribal mischance they have been accidentally reversed, thenthe effect of the text as a whole would indeed be to reveal a mystery:that the apparent plants and other simple ingredients of PGM mate-rials are in fact incredibly rare and powerful substances that the aver-age person would not be able to obtain, but that he or she mightassume to be available to Egyptian priests through their work intemples and at the necropoleis of so many of the animals named incolumn A. Such a set of correspondences would have the effect ofmaking it impossible for the un-careful masses denigrated by thetext’s introduction to achieve any result in their ritual performances,unless they were carried out through the “power-brokerage” of Egyp-tian priests, who would stand to benefit considerably, certainly inprestige and possibly financially as well, if they were involved in dis-tributing little packages that, despite their innocuous labels, were be-lieved by their purchasers to contain, e.g., Hestia’s blood. By this I donot mean to suggest that Egyptian priests actually believed that theywere using the bodily fluids of deities and sacred animals. Rather, thiscould be seen as an example of the kind of deliberate “bizarre-ification” recently discussed by David Frankfurter87 as “stereotypeappropriation:” the alteration of Egyptian temple practices to meetthe expectation of a Greco-Roman “marketplace” which wanted itsEgyptians using weird animal parts and deities’ bodily fluids, nothomely items such as dill, chamomile, and turnips.88 This possibilityis interesting, and requires further research and thought.Whichever of these directions further interpretation takes, this textdoes not provide a reliable guide to the understanding of PGM sub-stances, and should not be used as a paradigm for hypothesizing awide variety of interpretative substitutions. Although I do not doubt87David Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance (Princeton,NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998); 224-37.88This kind of exoticism is also the explanation used by Brashear for the increas-ing use of voces magicae etc. in the papyri from the 1st through the 3rd centuries;William Brashear, “The Greek Magical Papyri: An Introduction and Survey; Anno-tated Bibliography (1928-1994), ANRW II.18.5, esp. 3429-3438."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":", ,       that ritual practitioners occasionally faced emergency situations thatled to substitutions on an ad-hoc basis, in cases where such exigenciesare foreseen, the suggested substitutions are as close as possible to theoriginal ingredient,89 not a radical change from a body part to asimple plant—or the reverse. The best guides to interpretation ofPGM recipe ingredients are the numerous other instances of textsspecifying their substances carefully, by color, season, merchant; andby dialect, language or synonym. In the majority of these cases, ex-cept for the Priestly Interpretations and the two lines of PGM XIIIdiscussed above, it is clear that these synonyms and descriptions arenot a license for substitution, and that common plants cannot beassumed to lie behind the requirements for rare and unusual sub-stances in the PGM handbooks. This being the case, it should bepossible through further study to more firmly identify some of thesesubstances, and, through the evaluation of their rarity and expense,begin to locate recipes and spells more clearly in specific social andgeographical contexts.89For example, PGM V 54-69 requires water from a shipwreck, but allows thesubstitution of water from a sunken rowboat if no shipwrecks are available.

Ipropose to investigate why Thessaly acquired a reputation for sorceryand at the conclusion will offer a suggestion. As for specific detailabout drawing down the moon, D. E. Hill, Anne-Marie Tupet, andP. J. Bicknell covered this subject thoroughly, so that I shall repeattheir findings as little as possible.1Thessaly was, and is, a largely level area of northeastern Greecebounded on north, west, and south by mountains but with access tothe sea on the east. Its significance in ancient Greek history beganand petered out early. Ancient Greeks, however, rememberedThessaly for its legends and legendary characters: the Centaurs, par-ticularly Chiron, part of the career of Heracles, Jason with his Argo,and Achilles.Among the ancient Greeks and Romans from the late Classicalage on Thessalian women had the reputation of being able to drawdown the moon from the sky. The first surviving mention among theGreeks of the feat we can establish firmly–occurs in a joke in thecomedy The Clouds by the late fifth-century BCE writer Aristophanes.2In the play the central character Strepsiades, “the twister,” tries vari-ous “twists” to avoid paying the debts, or even the interest on the1La magie dans la poésie Latine: I, Des origines à la fin du règne d’Auguste.

Then I’d shut it up in to around box like a face mirror, and then I’d keep it there.Socrates, puzzled, asks his pupil what good that will do him.Strepsiades responds:If the moon doesn’t rise at all, then I wouldn’t pay the interest.When Socrates asks how that is, Strepsiades cites Athenian commer-cial code:Because debts are paid by the month (“by the moon,” literally).Both Strepsiades and Socrates would have been aware that the first ofthe month was marked by the new moon, and on that day a debt orinterest on it was due. Here an ancient scholiast comes to our aid, notwith more about interest payment dates but about Thessalians. Thetext of the note reads:5The Thessalians (masculine plural, in Greek) are slandered as being wiz-ards (go/htej), and even yet among us, Thessalians (feminine plural now!)are called farmaki/dej (“medicine women”).A curious variant in one of the manuscripts has instead of“Thessalians are called farmaki/dej” rather “they call faramaki/dej‘Thessalians.’”6 This inversion shows the first instance of somethingwe shall note increasingly, that “Thessalian” acquires the more gen-eral sense of “magical” and loses any geographical determination.The scholiast goes on to explain the origin of the materia medica ofThessalian sorcery:3Hill, p. 238, finds significance in Strepsiades’ suggesting the disappearance ofthe moon as a way to evade debt: “Verrier Elwin (Myths of Middle India, Madras,1949, p. 69) reports a number of Indian myths in which the sun or moon are said tobe held as sureties for a debt, so that it may not be coincidental that our earliestclassical reference to the Thessalian trick (Aristophanes Clouds 749-52) is also associ-ated with debt while our last classical reference (Nonnus Dionysiaca 36. 344-49) at-tributes the trick to brahmins.” I find this unlikely.4Clouds 749-56.

One scholiast asserts that theywould lose a family member. That Medieval Byzantine lexicon, TheSuda, gives us a different consequence in explaining a saying, “You’redrawing down the moon on yourself.” Says the lexicographer:8The Thessalian women who draw down the moon are said to lose theireyes and feet.A generation after Plato came the Syracusan tragedian Sosiphanes,from whom comes one substantial fragment relevant to our topic. Histragedy Meleager contained these two lines:9With magical incantations every Thessalian maiden is afraudulent bringer down of the moon from the aether.Thus Sosiphanes seems to suggest that the women do not really bringdown the moon, but only appear to. Incidentally, this use of “magi-cal,” ma/goij, in a Greek context of this period is pejorative, evoking anote of the foreign and hostile Persians, the very people with whomthe Thessalians were accused of collaborating.10In and of itself the citation from Sosiphanes adds nothing to whatwe have already learned; it only reinforces the commonness of thereputation of the Thessalian women. The source of the citation, how-ever, is more instructive. It derives from an ancient scholiast who was7Gorgias 513a8(anon.), Suidae Lexicon, ed. Ada Adler. Lexicographi Graeci 1. Leipzig: B.

Version a of thescholia explains:The myth is told that the witches draw down the moon by incantations.The Thessalian women intend to do this, but err about the eclipse. Ac-cordingly Aglaonike, since she was experienced in astronomy and know-ing the eclipse of the moon, <that is,> the time that it would occur forthem, claimed that she was drawing down the moon, and immediatelyshe fell into misfortunes, losing one of her family members.Plutarch tells much the same story, three times, in fact, though hesays nothing about the practitioner losing a family member.12While still in the Greek cultural orbit, classical and sub-classical,another problematic appearance of Thessalian sorcery deserves men-tion. The Elder Pliny, fretting about the subject of drawing down themoon, said that Menander had a comedy “The ThessalianWoman.”13 Whether the comedy was about a courtesan of that nameor about a sorceress who drew down the moon, or possibly aboutboth, remains unclear in the absence of any fragments of the workand in light of Pliny’s uncertaintyIt is in Roman literature that we find by far the most frequentmention of Thessalian sorcery. G. W. Bowersock, in writing of Ro-man Thessaly, comments:Most Romans under the principate knew Thessaly chiefly through Lit-erature, in particular as a place of magic and of demonic women. Theyhad little apprehension of the real Thessaly.14Thessalian sorcery enters extant Roman literature well before theprincipate, associated with a putative male, however, not a woman,and freed from drawing down the moon. Plautus in his comedyAmphitryon, produced probably about 201 BCE, has the heroAmphitryon, befuddled by meeting two copies of his personal slaveSosia, one of them being the god Mercury, as well as by his owndoppelgänger, the god Jupiter, exclaims, “By Pollux I’ll get even to-11Argonautica 3.533.12De defect. orac. 417a, De coniug. praecept. <48?> See also De Pyth. orac. 400b.13Nat.

As faras we know, Plautus has given us our first Thessalian sorcerer who ismale and the first who does not conjure the moon down.Most, not all, Roman literary dealings with Thessalians and theirritual talents classify as reductionist. The practitioners are women,they draw down the moon, though they have other skills in theirrepertoire, and the end of their practices is erotic. Early in this cen-tury Eugene Tavenner undertook to catalogue the Roman authorswho addressed or alluded to Thessalian lunar ritual.16 Besides Plautushe names the poets Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca,Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, Statius, Martial, Juvenal, and the prose writ-ers Pliny the Elder and Apuleius. We may add Claudian and theChristian poet Prudentius, who several times and rather insistentlyrejects the power of the Thessalians.On occasion the Roman poets simply use “Thessalian” as a syno-nym for what they might otherwise call “magical.” This is clearly thecase in the first surviving Roman reference to drawing down themoon, in Horace’s Fifth Epode. Folia, with an Italian name andexplicitly from Rimini, “<she> who brings down the enchanted starsand the moon from the sky with Thessalian voice” (45-46) is simplyusing a “magic” voice. She is, moreover, aiding her friend Canidia ina child sacrifice to compel a lover to come to her. The moon ismerely an allusive ornament. Horace, who can use commonplaceswithout slipping into clichés, works several variants of the Thessalianmotif. One who lives a moral life “laughs at dreams, magic terrors(terrores magicos), marvels, wise women(= “witches”), nocturnal ghosts,and Thessalian portents (Ep.2.2.208-09).Finally Horace inverts the cliché that presents magic as an ama-tory technique. On the contrary, love is more powerful, as he tells usin an ode:What witch, what magus with Thessalian potions, what god can set youfree?

The remainder of this study willconcern the two substantial roles of Thessaly in Latin writers, wherethe reputation of Thessaly becomes the driving force of the narrative.The first we find in the sixth book of the Pharsalia or the Civil War bythe Neronian epic poet Lucan and the other in the Metamorphoses orGolden Ass by the second-century C.E. novelist Apuleius.Lucan clearly has an agenda in his epic, to condemn the Romancivil wars that led to the ascendancy of the Julio-Claudian line, eventhough he has dedicated his epic to the last survivor of that line,Nero. That Julius Caesar’s great victory over the senatorial party ledby Pompey took place in witch-haunted Thessaly suited Lucan’s pro-gram perfectly. His run-up to the central battle of his epic is a grand-guignol scene of necromancy conducted by the most flamboyantwitch of Roman literature, Erictho (B.C. 6.507-830), whom he intro-duces with a digression on Thessaly and particularly on its reputationfor acts of sorcery, which he calls “scelerum ritus,” “rituals of crimes”(507). He begins his account with an accusative announcing histheme, “Thessaliam” (333), a dramatic emphasis facilitated by theflexible word order of Latin. First he tells us of Pompey’s decadentson Sextus, who rejects traditional, sanctioned oracles and turns tothe “Haemonides,” Haemonian, that is, Thessalian women (435). Hisrecital of their repertory ends with our familiar ritual:... bright Phoebe grew pale, beset by the dire venom of their words, andshe glowed with dark and earthly fires, no different than if the earth withits fraternal image were in the way and were inserting its shadow onto thecelestial flames; and <the moon> endures such labors until it draws nearand foams down onto the earth underneath (500-06).This “foam” may be the “virus lunare,” “moon poison,” that Erictholater uses to revive the corpse of the slain soldier on whom she per-forms her necromantic ritual. Erictho herself does not enchant themoon, however, or perform any of the other rituals employed by the“Haemonian” women. These she scorns as “crimes of excessive pi-ety,” in Lucan’s oxymoron (507-08).Ninety years after Lucan another energetic writer and stylistic in-novator took the theme of Thessaly and made it the dramatic settingof his narrative. This was Apuleius of Madaura, one of the two sur-viving Roman novelists, author of The Metamorphoses or The Golden Ass.Apuleius did not pick up the notion of a supernatural Thessaly prima-rily from Lucan, for his novel clearly was modeled after a lost Greekoriginal, represented for us by a derivative work entitled Lucius, or the"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"  ‒    Ass, attributed incorrectly to the satirist Lucian, a contemporary ofApuleius. Commentators for generations have busied themselves soexclusively with the relation of The Metamorphoses to Lucius, or the Assand its predecessor, also called The Metamorphoses, that a concern forthe novel’s relation to Lucan’s epic has fallen by the wayside.17 Asuggestion of a relationship appears in some of the wording of the twoLatin works. Apuleius begins his account of his journey with theaccusative “Thessaliam” (1.2.5), and, after a parenthetic interruption,says, “eam Thessaliam . . . ” This recalls Lucan’s introductory accu-sative “Thessaliam” (6.333) that I have mentioned earlier. In a listingof the reputed effects of sorcery he lists “lunam despumari,” “themoon to be made to drop foam” (1.3.17), using the same verb asLucan. We may concede to the lost Greek work behind Lucius, or theAss, the plot, down to details. Certainly the selection of Thessaly asthe scene of the action derived there. In Lucan, however, Apuleiushad an available model for vocabulary and style, as the two verbalsimilarities would suggest.By the middle of the second century of our era this topos may havereached its high tide, but it has not exhausted itself. At the very endof Classical Roman literature the poet Claudian, telling of the Gothicinvasion of Italy, reports that persistent eclipses of the moon frightenthe Romans, who will not believe in the astronomical explanation.Instead, they attribute them to “Thessalian camp followers (femininegender) <who> pollute the moon’s gleam with their hereditary po-tions” (XXVI, De bello Pollentino sive Gothico 236-238).Let us cautiously assemble what we know of the reputation ofancient Thessaly for witchcraft, sorting it out chronologically anddifferentiating Greek and Roman viewpoints.First, from our investigation we primarily know something aboutthe Athenians rather than the Thessalians. Indisputably some Atheni-ans and Syracusans of the late fifth and fourth centuries BCE enter-tained or were entertained by a belief that there were women inThessaly who could draw down the moon. Aristophanes, Plato,Sosiphanes, and allegedly Menander assure us of that.Next, we know that the Romans took the Athenian statements andran with them, no longer limiting Thessalian talents to lunar manipu-17Lucan escapes mention in Helmut van Thiel’s Der Eselroman: I, Untersuchungen.Zetemata: Monographien zur klassischen Altertumswissenschaft 54/I (Munich: C.H.

One specific one, I believe. Recall the story of Aglaonike,told both by a scholiast and by Plutarch, by the latter three times.18Here we have a personal name of a Thessalian, not of one whopracticed witchcraft but of one who exploited the ignorance of othersto claim credit for what Sophie Lunais called “the most characteristicact of the women magicians” and D. E. Lee, “the ThessalianTrick.”19 But Aglaonike pulled off her hoax because there were al-ready other women attempting to draw down the moon and failing.This constitutes our only contact with any specific Thessalian personor reality in our entire survey.I should conclude this hurried overview of ancient references tothe reputation of Thessaly by offering a suggestion as to its origin,namely, the legend of Medea, a figure we have met several times inour survey.20 And the question to ask is not, “What land does legendsay Medea came from?” but rather, “What land did the legend ofMedea come from?” The legend cannot come from the land ascribedto her as her homeland. Medea is in the earliest tellings from theLand of Oz, that is to say, “Aea,” “the Land,” pure and simple.21The seventh century poet Mimnermus located this never-never landat the edge of the Ocean, to an early Greek, a never-never riverencircling the earth (fr. 11). Homer (Od. 12.3 similarly locates“Aeaea,” the home of Circe, as the Theogony (956-62) does the homeof Medea. Later tellings of the legend, first by Herodotus (1.2), thenby Pindar (Pyth. 4.11), but most notably by Apollonius, responding toGreek exploration of the Black Sea, made Aea into the historicColchis on the easternmost shore of the Pontus. This is a recognizableprocess in the development and retelling of a legend. In post-Ho-meric legend Odysseus meets the Cyclops in Sicily and even Frank18Above, p. 4.19Recherches sur la lune, I.

Iamblichus, the Syrian, inserted himself into the turbu-lent spiritual debates of late antiquity by thinking within (as well aspartially manipulating) a remarkably similar set of stereotypes thatwere current in his own day. I suggest that we need to keep thesestereotypes in mind, precisely insofar as they made their presence feltin the minds of the ancients themselves. Such a strategy yields only alittle, alas, in our understanding of the manifold cultures that count asEastern in such equations (including Egypt, Syria, Babylonia, andIndia). It is, however, crucial in our understanding of the visions andverities, hopes and fears, that inhabit the thinking of the heirs to Platoand Aristotle.Contemplative and Active WaysThe Neoplatonists took a distinctively spiritual, for lack of a betterword, approach to the practice of philosophy. All of Plotinus’ (205–270) followers were deeply moved by his vision of philosophy as asoteriological pursuit. At stake was not simply a dry intellectual ap-preciation of the world, but the salvation of individual souls througha program of rigorous contemplation that could lead the devotee tonothing less than union with the utterly transcendent principle of thecosmos. Porphyry, who edited Plotinus’ work, wholeheartedly agreedwith his master’s emphasis on contemplation and not ritual. The wayto the One is by thoughts, not acts. Porphyry’s junior colleague,Iamblichus, thought just the opposite. In the de Mysteriis, Iamblichusbegan from the premise that ritual action has a useful role to play inthe individual’s discipline of enlightenment. He gave a clue as to hisreasoning in his Timaeus commentary:But if, when the best part of us [the intellect] is perfect, then the whole ofus is happy, what would prevent us all, the whole human race, frombeing happy at this moment, if the highest part of us is always enjoyingintellection, and always turned towards the gods? If the Intellect is the3Glen Bowersock’s whole corpus has thoroughly troubled any easy culturalclichés around the period.

The bitter experience of distance fromthe One convinced Iamblichus that more than thinking is required,one must actually DO something to find the divine. What one doesturns out for Iamblichus to be a program of rites, which he calledtheurgy [yeourg¤a] and which Porphyry called magic [gohte¤a].5Iamblichus, more than any single figure, thrust the theurgic rites tothe center of late classical philosophy. Most of his successors wereconvinced by his arguments. Iamblichus produced the most signifi-cant development in Neoplatonism (after Plotinus’ founding of theschool) for the next thousand years—at least down to the time ofMarsilio Ficino (1433–99). The theurgic program prominently in-cluded the animation of statues as well as the practice which willdetain me at greater length, the use of the onomata barbara, or invoca-tion of the gods by means of specially potent divine names.The Culture of ContemplationPorphyry was unconvinced by Iamblichus’ innovations. At somepoint in his career, he wrote a polemical letter to a fictitious Egyptianpriest whom he called “Anebo,” in which he made a detailed andsweeping refutation of the legitimacy of ritual practice in the pursuitof spiritual ascent. The breadth of the attack is often overlooked.Porphyry’s detailed refutations questioned whether nearly any devo-tional act in the mundane world could have a role to play in spiritualascent. He stakes out what we might call a pure contemplationistposition. From within such a position the terms “ritual” (of any kind)and “magic” will flow somewhat seamlessly together. Therefore, tounderstand Porphyry’s attack as a defense of reason against magic,already tilts the argument to Porphyry before it begins.6 It makes a4Iamblichus, Timaeus Commentary, frag. 87 (in Iamblichus, In Platonis dialogoscommentariorum fragmenta, John M.

Greek thinkers, after all, had traditionallyargued over the relevance and efficacy of human devotions towardthe divine. Cicero gives us a glimpse of this old debate in the de NaturaDeorum where he stages a debate between Epicurean detractors oftraditional religious worship and equally strong Stoic supporters (e.g.,de Nat. I.56, II.71–72).7If Porphyry’s main concern is the cultic practice of his fellowNeoplatonists, it may seem odd that he chose to attack them indi-rectly, through a fictitious Egyptian surrogate. Pseudonymity made acertain amount of sense, however, when we consider that theNeoplatonic supporters of theurgy went to some lengths to establishan Egyptian pedigree for their practices. Porphyry engaged in a rhe-torical flourish, then, challenging his peers who were inventing a newbrand of rites by attacking the history they were constructing forthemselves—more remains to be said on this point. By looking closelyat one of the theurgic practices in dispute, I hope to show that suchEastern “straw men” as Porphyry’s fictitious correspondent, Anebo,played a very real and important role in the contested formation ofNeoplatonic theurgy, in and through the categories of ritual andmagic.In his letter, Porphyry refuted the practice of invocation of a godby means of traditional names drawn from various Mediterraneanlanguages. Similar beliefs in the potency of special words are old anddiffuse in Mediterranean cultures, from the so-called Ephesian letters,whose reputation was widespread in Greece,8 to the divine names inthe Greek Magical Papyri,9 to various prohibitions on uttering or writingthe names of a god. In refuting the practice of invocation by means ofdivine names, Porphyry wondered why “we” Greeks did not just useour own names for the gods instead of importing foreign ones:Also, what do the meaningless names [tå êshma ÙnÒmata] mean? Andwhy are the foreign names for each god preferred to our own [tå7Epicureans raised objections to human worship of the divine as a form ofsuperstition. The Stoics here supported traditional worship of the gods as a means ofupholding custom and leading the individual to right living.8See Chester C.

For if one refers the utterance to thething it signifies, the conception itself [≤ aÈtØ ¶nnoia] clearly remainsindependent [aÈtãrkhw], whatever word one may assign to it.

(10a-10b)10Porphyry’s main line of argument here was that the divine could nothave a preference regarding the names used for it, since it is surelyabove ethnic distinctions and so could have no meaningful connec-tion with one particular culture’s name or another. Greek speakersshould use Greek names for the gods, the others are pretentious affec-tations, when used by Greeks. Speakers of other languages will havetheir own words which operate like the Greek ones. All these namesare conventional markers for the same underlying divine referents.The theoretical heft behind Porphyry’s position is provided by atheory of language, specifically Aristotelian, that words are conven-tionally accepted labels for a set of mental notions (Porphyry’s¶nnoiai) which presumably map onto a set of entities (in this case adivine being) out in the world.11 Whether one language group uses aparticular set of sounds for one thing and another uses another istrivial and purely arbitrated by conventional agreement among agroup of speakers. The matter that is indicated, and its mental corre-late, remain constant. Such a theory was never fully embraced byPlato. In the Cratylus, Socrates remains in tension between two posi-tions: 1) if language is to be an adequate tool for understanding theforms, it must be stable and not subject to the whims of the many, thefinal arbiters of “convention,” and 2) the sounds of words really donot match up with the ideas they indicate. The former concern isprecisely where Aristotle differed from his predecessor. He embraced10References to Porphyry, Epistula ad Anebonem, ed. A. R. Sodano (Naples: L’ArteTipografica, 1958).11In the de Interpretatione, Aristotle tells us that the word is a sign of a pãyhma[affection] of the soul, which results from the world pressing itself on us:As writing, so also is speech not the same for all races. But the mental affectionsthemselves, of which these words are primarily signs, are the same for the wholeof mankind, as are also the objects [prãgmata] of which those affections arerepresentations, or likenesses.(16a6-8)."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"  ‒    the common conceptions expressed in the collective experience andunderstanding of a group of speakers. Plato did not trust “the many”to fabricate a language that is reliable. Porphyry here sided withAristotle and treated words as conventional labels that could just aswell be one thing or another. The word, on this reading, is a dispos-able piece of cultural baggage. True reality will not care what it isnamed.If we take a closer look at Porphyry’s seemingly straightforwardposition, two poles are evident. On the one side is a universalizingspirit, which assumes and values a ground that transcends culture,nation, and language. This is also, need we say it, the side where thedivine rests. In standard post-Plotinian Neoplatonism, divine beingsdwell near the top of a hierarchy of being, well above the profusion ofdifferences (including linguistic ones) that reigns in the materialworld. The very notion of the divine, in Porphyry’s mind, might evenbe defined as that which rises above, or brings to naught, the varia-tions and differences that exist on the material plane. In Porphyry’sargument against the divine names, we find a cultural analogue tothis metaphysical principle. The divine overwhelms cultural varia-tions and renders them trivial. Exchange “Greek culture” for the“divine” and one could also label this, interestingly enough, the veryspirit of Hellenism, as it is customarily envisioned in a post-Alexandrian Greek world. Forming Porphyry’s other pole, we findsenseless language, artificiality, an intrusion of the parochial concernof ethnicity into the divine realms, and the misattribution of lowlysense-data to the immaterial divine. All these components of the sec-ond pole are clustered around a single transgression: a confusion ofthe hierarchy that separates what is material and mundane from whatis immaterial and divine. It is significant that Porphyry invoked thecategory of magic [gohte¤a] as part of his summation of this secondgroup of concerns. In fact, such a confusion is the very heart and soulof the notion of magic, in its customary classical use as a polemicalcategory. We need to add a final term to this second pole: the non-Greek. In this part of their extended debate, Porphyry andIamblichus argued specifically over a group of names derived fromnon-Greek languages. Such names were collectively known as theÙnÒmata bãrbara.12 While Porphyry’s argument, then, dwells on the12See, e.g., Galen, De simplicium medicamentorum temperamentis ac facultatibus libri, inC.G.

Such a rhetoric, inventedwell before Greek imperial aspirations, fits all too well the needs andimagination of an imperial culture, where the local is always theparochial, and the universal is simply the common good.The Culture of ActionIamblichus, writing some years later, answered Porphyry’s charges,point-by-point, in the long tract handed down to us as the de Mysteriis.In keeping with the charade of Egyptianism under which Porphyrybegan the debate, he adopted the persona of Anebo’s supposed mas-ter, Abammon. With regard to the divine names, Iamblichus an-swered in book VII that the gods have certain favorite names, notablyEgyptian and Assyrian ones, and that these have mysterious, ineffableconnections to the gods they signify. Iamblichus claimed that thenames used for the gods by the different nations are not perfectlyinterchangeable from language to language, but that some nations,due to their wisdom and antiquity, have preserved more appropriatenames for the divine. Iamblichus continued that though the meaningsof some of these names may be unknown, they are all significant[shmantikã] to the gods, though not in an articulable mode [oÈ katå=htÚn trÒpon] (de Myst. VII.4.8-9). These divine names indicate theirreferents in a different way. We must, Iamblichus counsels, put awayour pedestrian notions of the ways language works. The divine namesare beyond reason. We must remove every thought [§p¤noia] andrational account [logikØ di°jodow] from our consideration of them.Furthermore, their link to their referents is not a simple “naturalism,”such as the one Plato explored in the Cratylus. Iamblichus cautionedagainst any notion of likeness between the sound of words and thenature of the things to which they refer (de Myst.

Next, Iamblichus granted that if names were set down ac-cording to convention [katå sunyÆkhn], then it would not matter"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"  ‒    whether a person used one or another, “but if they are suspended[sunÆrthtai] from the nature of things, those names which are moreadapted to it will also be more dear to the gods.” [efi d¢ tª fÊseisunÆrthtai t«n ˆntvn, tå mçllon aÈtª proseoikÒta ka‹ to›w yeo›w ¶staidÆpou prosfil°stera (de Myst. VII.5.8-10)]. Iamblichus states that thedivine symbols are the things “most united” [tå mãlista sunhnvm°na]to the gods themselves, and that they “attach” [sunãptonta] us tothem (de Myst. VII.5).In constructing his defense of such efficacious language, which isantiquity’s most ambitious theory of a connection between word andthing, Iamblichus also created one of the ancient world’s most fullyarticulated theories of ritual language.13 With terms that suggest notrepresentation through intermediate layers of intellectual reality butactual direct linkage—sunartãv, sunãptv, and sunenÒv—Iambli-chus meant something precise and relatively straightforward (if such aword is ever appropriate within the context of Neoplatonic ontology).Iamblichus claimed that some names are final links in great andmysterious chains of being that proceed out from the very god towhich they refer. The key here is the foundational Plotinian conceptof emanation: the idea that all reality flows from a single utterlytranscendent source, called the One, and keeps a part of its highercause in itself. With the theory of emanation behind him, whichpassed for something like common sense in late antiquity, Iamblichuscould make the claim that certain names not only call to mind thegods to which they refer, but actually provide a chain of emanation tothe transcendent. They are a divine trace nestled into our dailyworld, or what Eliade might have called a “hierophany.” That in anutshell is Iamblichus’ position—an interesting one in itself, to besure, especially for those interested in the history of language theory,in which this vision (mediated through Proclus and the Christianadapter of Neoplatonic thinking, Pseudo-Dionysius) played a some-what more prominent role than is currently appreciated. But whenwe bring Iamblichus’ theory into conversation with Porphyry’s, wenote something rather conspicuous. Both Porphyry and Iamblichusheld an emanationist view of the cosmos. For manifold reasons, Por-phyry did not wish to emphasize this line of thinking, nor to extendinto the realm of language the immanence corollary that follows from13By “natural connection” as opposed to “convention” I mean the proposition,tested by Plato in the Cratylus, that a word is connected with its referent katå fÊsin asopposed to katå sunyÆkhn."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"      it. Similarly, Iamblichus was just as devoted as his rival to the notionthat the One is utterly transcendent. But, for manifold reasons,Iamblichus chose not to emphasize the transcendence position in hisrhetoric regarding the divine names, opting instead to extend theNeoplatonic views of divine emanation and immanence. Both theirviews grew out of strongly held Plotinian positions. We will not findsatisfactory or exhaustive reasons for this difference in emphasis, butwhatever the reasons behind them, their choices put cultural issuesstake, just as much as they did philosophical ones.Just as we found within Porphyry’s language a cultural rhetoricconcurrent with the ontological and theological ones, we find thesame in Iamblichus’ answer. Iamblichus, under the guise ofAbammon, couched his argument for the efficacy of divine names inan argument against the shallowness of a race of people he labeled asthe “Greeks,” “ÜEllhnew.” The Greeks, he argued, have lost touchwith the ancient and efficacious divine names because of a certainimpatience in their national character. Drawing on a line of thinkingopened by Herodotus and Plato in the Timaeus, Iamblichus claimedthat, in comparison with the Egyptians, the Greeks are by natureoverly fond of innovation, they flit about everywhere, they neitherpreserve their own cultural foundation nor that of others, they aban-don it quickly and remake everything by their unstable and sophisti-cal ingenuity (VII.5). As opposed to the Greeks and their destructivelove of innovation, Iamblichus extolled the wisdom and spiritualdepth of that great and hoary set of people known to the Greeks asthe Barbarians, or “bãrbaroi.” These other, older and more patientnations—including the Egyptians, and interestingly enough theAssyrians—are in spiritual matters everything that the Greeks arenot. They are stable in their manners, “mÒnimoi to›w ≥yesin,” and haverespect for the ancient ways. They were the first to whom the godsrevealed the secret language, which, again, is no mere human inven-tion but exists in the very sinews of the structure of the cosmos.Because of their strength and consistency of character (that is to say,their resistance to a universalizing Hellenism), they have preservedthe old names and are therefore closer to the divine than the Greeks.Iamblichus singled out two nations for their preservation of thegods’ true names: the Egyptians and the Assyrians. That he wouldclaim the Egyptians as having great antiquity and spirituality is notsurprising at all. The Greeks had thought of them as a repository ofancient wisdom for many years, as we noted. But that he included theAssyrians in this group is somewhat odd. The Assyrians, as far as Iam able to determine, were not especially marked by Neoplatonistsbefore Iamblichus as a people wise in divine matters. Iamblichus for"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"  ‒    some reason elevated their spiritual potency up to the level of theancient Egyptians.Precisely whom Iamblichus meant to indicate by the designation“Assyrian” is somewhat unclear. The term Assyria technically refersto a region in the upper Tigris which enjoyed a successful imperialpast in the Bronze Age and had a later history as a Roman provinceunder Trajan. However, in practice we find many departures fromthis technical usage. Herodotus uses the designations “Assyrian” and“Syrian” interchangeably (7.63), and both terms refer generally topeoples of the upper Near East between the Mediterranean andBabylonia, including the Phoenicians (2.12,158-9), the Cappadocians(1.72), and the Jews of Palestine (2.104). Virgil uses Assyrian as anadjective for the Phoenician city of Tyre, calling the purple dye forwhich Tyre was famous, “Assyrium venenum.” (Georgics II.465). Inprobably the second century C.E., Dionysius Periegetes (V.975) labelsas “Assyrians” the residents of Pontus, on the Black Sea, andCappadocia. Lucian, who was born in the second century inSamosata only 200 km Northeast of Iamblichus’ birthplace identifieshimself as an Assyrian. Finally, the fifth-century epic poet Nonnoscalls the Libanus mountain range in Lebanon, the “Assurios Libanos”[ÉAssur¤ow Libãnow]. (Dion. 41.19) This wide variation in usage of theterm should make us weary of trying to fix, in any precise way, thelanguage that Iamblichus wishes to promote. However, it is not toomuch to say that, whichever tongue Iamblichus has precisely in mind,he claimed for one of the languages that could be understood asbelonging to the region of his birth (perhaps Syriac) a special qualitywhich the international language of Hellenism sadly lacks. In the streetsof Rome, then, the adjective “Assyrius” would have equally well fitwhatever language Iamblichus has in mind and Iamblichus himself.Iamblichus, in this case, took a strong interest in the “local” overand above the “imperial” or the “international.” This stance is pre-cisely the opposite of Porphyry’s. Iamblichus opted away from theuniversal and toward the particular. It is there Iamblichus asserted thatone will find spiritual power and salvation—not in disembodied rea-son, but in tradition embodied in physical, palpable sounds and writ-ing, god-given and preserved by those humans who have the wisdomto resist the latest human mind-games and to recognize the divinewhen they see it.Constructing Identities and the Stakes of HellenismIn his Life of Pythagoras, Iamblichus reiterated a specific interest in theintellectual and cultural value of Syrian traditions. He repeated the"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"      standard claim that Pythagoras traveled all over the Mediterraneanto learn from the wise men of various regions. Iamblichus’ list in-cludes Babylonia, Egypt, and Syria [Sur¤a]. Interestingly, Iamblichusespecially qualified Pythagoras’ Syrian visitation by telling us that hewent there to learn their secrets not at all from any kind of supersti-tion [deisidaimon¤a], but because Pythagoras had a genuine desire forcontemplative knowledge [yevr¤a], and his Syrian hosts, apparently,had true wisdom to impart (V.P. 3.14). This seems to be a case ofspecial pleading on behalf of Iamblichus’ native people and providescorroborating evidence that he held a stake in how the wider Hellen-istic philosophical community (the audience for his writing) wouldview the region of his birth. The defensive tone is also evidence thatsome of Iamblichus’ contemporaries did indeed consider Syria to bethe kind of place where people are “superstitious.”Such cultural lines between Greeks and non-Greeks, as we saw,were also very sharp on Porphyry’s side of the issue, though he valuedthem in precisely opposite ways. As we have seen, he specificallywondered why Greeks, a group with which he clearly identifies, donot just use their own names [tå ofikei`a ÙnÒmata] for each god insteadof using foreign ones imported from the bãrbaroi. Porphyry’s desig-nation of the Greek names he prefered as ofikei`a helps us get a handleon the issues at stake. As well as being a standard designation of whatbelongs to “US” as opposed to some other “THEM,” the adjectiveofikei`ow also designated something that is proper or in line with agiven local situation, and something that is natural, that is, sanctionedby the larger natural world (or fÊsiw) and the principles that governits operation. The natural opposition (so to speak) of tå ofikei`aÙnÒmata with tå bãrbara ÙnÒmata captured nicely the kind of elisionsthat are common in cultural chauvinisms of many varieties. Itconflated what are really three separate things: the natural, theproper, and one’s own way of looking at the world. There is noquestion where Porphyry’s cultural affiliations lie.Perhaps most telling in this context, we should also note theirrespective treatment of their own names—that most intimate of iden-tity markers. Porphyry found a Greek equivalent to his Phoenicianname “Malkas,” while Iamblichus kept the name of his birth, translit-erated into Greek characters, which must have sounded strangelyEastern in Rome.14 Interestingly enough, each philosopher treats hisown name in precisely the manner he thinks appropriate for the14See Dillon, 864."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"   ‒    divine names. In Porphyry’s view, his Phoenician name “Malkas,”which means king, refers to the notion “king,” which has a universalpresence for all peoples. This notion is equally expressible in otherlanguages, and he chooses a Greek term for the royal purple as hisname. Iamblichus has refused such translation, and maintains his“home” designation, steady and consistent.To what, then, can we attribute the difference in their cultural self-identifications—Iamblichus’ chauvinistically non-Greek, Porphyry’schauvinistically Greek? The older scholarly narrative chalked up suchdifferences to Iamblichus’ Syrian origin. However, Porphyry’s back-ground, as it turns out, qualifies him as being every bit as much a“Syrian” as Iamblichus’. Porphyry was born at Tyre, a city adminis-tratively Syrian since Alexander and at Porphyry’s time the principalcity of the Roman province of “Syria Phoenice.” Iamblichus wasborn barely 200 km away in the town of Chalcis, located 50 milessouth and east of Antioch. Given the general way in which the desig-nations “Syrian” and “Assyrian” were used in Greek and Latin, boththese locations, considered geographically, could have equally wellcarried these labels. But it is also true that both thinkers had anequally strong ground to claim a “Greek” legacy for themselves. Theywere equally anchored in the traditions of Hellenism, steeped inGreek philosophy from Plato and Aristotle through the Stoics, wroteonly in Greek (so far as we know) and identified themselves as inheri-tors to the mantle of Greek philosophy. Porphyry and Iamblichuswere the most influential heirs to Plato of their respective generations,a reputation they carried in many centers of learning throughout theRoman empire, including such bookish places as Athens and Alexan-dria. They were also natives of a region which after the third centuryreceived a boost in prestige, relative to the ruling center in Rome,after “Elagabalus” from nearby Emesa—a town situated almost di-rectly between Tyre and Chalcis—ascended to the imperial throne in218. Neither of these figures then had only a “provincial” back-ground to understand for themselves and either could have claimedto be truly citizens of the broader Roman world of Greek letters.But if we can speculate for a moment, we might find some clues tohelp us sort out their differing positions. Iamblichus was born in thesmaller, inland town of Chalcis, while Porphyry hails from a provin-cial capital with a rich cultural history. Alexander conquered thewealthy city of Tyre only after a long siege of seven months. Theseverely depleted population was at that time replaced entirely byGreek colonists. Iamblichus’ Chalcis is a different story. We have veryfew references to the place. Strabo claims that the whole area East ofApamea, which would include Chalcis, is a back-country wasteland"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"      (II.1). Diodorus, however, does mention Chalcis as a city wealthyenough to have an army, but says it is on the edge of desert. Jeromechose the region near Chalcis as a place to which he could retire tolive the life of a hermit. Any communication, he tells us, had to bedone in “barbarian speech” (Ep. 5.1, 7.1-2, 15.2). Many Tyrians cer-tainly spoke Greek.Being from a more rural, less cosmopolitan city than Porphyry,perhaps Iamblichus felt a greater affiliation to his local region and lessto a cosmopolitan universalism. Equally important, Iamblichus’ col-leagues and audience would have been more likely to apply suchstereotypes to him, and Iamblichus would have then had to contendwith and negotiate them more intimately than Porphyry. Their laterlives bear out such a view. Porphyry spends nearly all of his lateryears in Rome, with relatively brief absences. By contrast Iamblichus,after his schooling in Rome, founds his own school back near histown of origin, in the suburbs of a more cosmopolitan place, theGreek city of Apamea—founded by the Seleucids. Such a view alsonicely matches the social dynamic that Peter Brown has traced fromthe 4th through the 6th centuries in the relations between Syrian citiesand villages.15 Brown suggests the deep fissure between the Hellen-ized cities and the Syriac-speaking villages. Their interactions wererare to the point of being non-existent. Brown suggests the holy manas a figure who performed a rare mediating role. Iamblichus’ largercareer fits this role, in a pagan context, though Iamblichus is notbringing city culture to the desert, but desert spiritualism to the Hel-lenistic city. Furthermore, Iamblichus’ singling out of Egypt andAssyria as having special holy names also matches the situationBrown has considered. During just Iamblichus’ period, the desertcultures of Syria and Egypt are the concurrent locations of the sameascetic movement.16 In the 4th century, the desert began to beckonmany and diverse seekers of enlightenment. Both Christian and pa-gan innovators on traditional Greek culture answer the call.Given this evidence collectively, then, it seems likely that Iambli-chus is engaged in the kind of practice that David Frankfurter haslocated among Egyptian holy men in Late Antiquity. Frankfurter hasshown that certain of these figures appropriate the stereotype of theforeign wonder-worker that Roman tourists expected of them.1715Peter Brown, “Town, Village and Holy Man: The Case of Syria,” in Society andthe Holy in Late Antiquity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), pp. 153–65.16Brown, pp. 153-54.17David Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance (Princeton,N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998), section 5.3.3."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"  ‒    Iamblichus, perhaps more readily understood as a “Syrian” than Por-phyry was, adopts this identity and lives it out, performing, to someextent, the role that a Roman audience would have expected ofsomeone from such an exotic faraway place in the Syrian desert.Porphyry on the other hand, from a place that the Romans knew wellas a Greek city with an illustrious past, inhabits the skin of aHellenized Roman citizen. It is important to remember that, giventheir backgrounds, either imagined identity, or combination, wasavailable to Porphyry or Iamblichus. Their distinct affiliations revealthe porous borders between such identities in a time of great culturalinterconnection. These identities are also part and parcel of each oftheir larger philosophical projects.The work of Michel Tardieu suggests that Iamblichus’ reorienta-tion of Neoplatonic thinking toward the desert was a success.18 Fol-lowing on Iamblichus, several Neoplatonists undertake journeys intothe Syrian desert, looking for (of all things) the remnants of classicalGreek culture—at a time when “Hellenism” was coming to mean notthe “Greek” as opposed to the “non-Greek” but “pagan” as opposedto “Christian.” Proclus, Isidore of Alexandria, Damascius, andSimplicius all make voyages into the back country of Syria in searchof a remote past. They locate, for example, the true location of theriver Styx on the Arabian plain about 30 km east of the Sea ofGalilee. One source characterizes a pilgrimage made to the site as ajourney to witness the “miracle” [yaËma] celebrated by Homer.19 InTardieu’s compelling view, the excursion is a voyage to a place whereclassical wonders are “still visible (that is to say not Christiainized) ina lost corner of the Syrian countryside in the Roman province ofArabia.” To sum up: “Pays refuge de la religion, la bordure du désertoffrait aux philosophes les seuls vestiges d’une présence encore visibledes dieux dans les prodiges de la nature.” Iamblichus’ life, Tardieuclaims, provided them with a model.20The debate between Iamblichus and Porphyry (which Iamblichusdecisively won) marks a decisive turn in the development ofPlatonism, though perhaps not the straightforward descent intomagic that Dodds had envisioned. We see here encapsulated a pivotalhistorical moment, when the fortunes of “Hellenism” took a seriousturn. No longer the dominant voice of imperial cities, Greek philoso-18Michel Tardieu, Les paysages reliques: Routes et haltes syriennes d’Isidore à Simplicius,Bibliothèque de l’École des Hautes Études, Section des Sciences Religieuses, vol.XCIV (Paris: Peeters, 1990).

From Iamblichus’ position, theattractions of the local and the parochial were plain to see. It wasthere, off in the desert, that the future lay. The language of universals,perhaps the sine qua non of Platonism, had to come to terms withnuance, in a way that it had never been forced to before. Greeklanguage was until Iamblichus’ time the cultural universal that corre-lated inconspicuously with philosophical universals. It would nowhave to contest with new universals, embodied in Constantine and anew dispensation, with which it was unfamiliar.Reason, Spiritual Ascent, and HellenismBut we can ask yet another question of these enfolded cultural andintellectual developments. We might revisit Iamblichus’ expressionsof his own cultural affiliations. Is Iamblichus’ critique of Greek cul-ture as “enamored of innovation” an argument from an insider or anoutsider? That it follows so closely on Plato’s Timaeus argues stronglythat we should consider it an insider’s critique. We should also placethis in context with the wider corpus of Iamblichus’ writings, wherehe betrays very little interest in either Syrian or Egyptian customs,languages, or beliefs. Like most of the Egyptian references in the deMysteriis, they amount to not much more than he could have gatheredfrom reading standard Greek-language sources like Manetho,Polybius, Diodorus Siculus (e.g., I.86-92), and Philostratus. Weshould also keep in mind the forest and not get lost in the trees.Iamblichus is far from trying to establish among his readers a flour-ishing cult of Isis or of Adad. Far from it. His project instead is torenew and save Greek philosophy, by uniting its various voices underthe broad outlines of Pythagoreanism and Neoplatonism. With thismore synthetic program he hoped to provide a stable tradition toattract and maintain the devotions and energies of his fellow Hellen-ists at a time when figures like Mithras and Jesus were competingstrongly for their attention. While it remains deeply ironic, it is per-haps no wonder, then, that the follower of Julian the Apostate whopenned apocryphal letters from the emperor’s hand to Iamblichus,addresses Iamblichus, and not Porphyry or Plotinus, the “savior[svtÆr] of the whole Hellenic world” and the “universal blessing [tÚkoinÚn agayÒn] of the ÜEllhnew.”The debate between Porphyry and Iamblichus highlights the factthat reason and unreason (whether we consider it the irrational or thehyper-rational), already in the early 4th century had a location. Withan eerie similarity to the stereotypes present in scholarly discussion"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"  ‒    only decades old, the argument between Iamblichus and Porphyrydissolved into an argument over the proper LOCATION for one’sspiritual devotions. Their debate boils down to a simpler one: Will wefind god here or there? Do we grant our energies to rational thinking (asPorphyry would have it) or to ritual (as Iamblichus advocates), tocontemplation or magic, to the Greek or the non-Greek. In morepurely linguistic terms, we might pose their debate in the followingway: Does spiritual power belong to Greek language, and contempla-tion in Greek language, or to foreign languages, and to ritual prac-tices that make use of them? Neither thinker, we should note, seri-ously challenges the view that Greek is the language of contemplationwhile foreign tongues are especially suited to rites (thoughIamblichus’ claim that Pythagoras learned “contemplation” in Syriais counter-evidence). Oddly enough, both for the most part seem tohave agreed on the terms of the dichotomy, though they valued themin opposite ways. They operated on the premise that Greek andforeign languages have their own special characteristics on either sideof a dichotomy of contemplation [yevr¤a] vs. magico-ritual action[yeourg¤a].Iamblichus’ granting of efficacious power exclusively to non-Greeknames bespeaks the mystified visions of an outsider—a non-non-Greek—looking in. In this reading, Syria, like Egypt, functions as aplace-holder for the exotic unknown to which one turns to find aspiritual dimension that has somehow evaporated from the culture inwhich one finds oneself living out one’s day-to-day life. If we were torecast these dichotomies in contemporary terms, we might summa-rize one side from Gayatri Spivak, and pose the question, “Can thebarbarians speak?”21 In other words, what is the position of a non-Greek language in a broadly Hellenized world? Can it carry seman-tic, that is, intellectual content, can it be written down like articulablehuman language, or does it always veer toward babble—whethertoward non-sensical screeching, or toward the more rarefied non-sense of efficacious language? Conversely, on the other side of thedichotomy, we might wonder, paraphrasing J. L. Austin, can theGreeks still “do things with words,” or has their language run out ofpower, lost the mystified moment of coinage, when meanings arestamped, and the world comes under control?22 Finally, we might21Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Can the Subaltern Speak?” in Cary Nelson andLarry Grossberg, eds.

Two of these texts contain spells forgood luck in fishing, on the one hand, and a good singing voice, onthe other. The former spell rehearses the stories, or historiolae, ofseveral fishing prodigies in biblical lore, in order that Severus mayprove successful with his net. The latter spell invokes supernaturalpower, in the form of the angel Davithea, with his golden bell and hisspiritual guitar, in order that Severus may also prove successful withhis voice: “he gives me a voice without hoarseness, which does notcrack, without roughness, which glides to the heights, as well as atongue, breathily babbling, tagging along after each instrument, giv-ing voice to music, which delights the crowd, in the middle of whomI sit.

This prayer of the Virgin Mary,in several forms, is the focus of our attention in this paper. Here Maryis presented as an exalted figure praising God and identifying herself,in prayer, as follows: “I praise [you, I glorify] you, I invoke you today,[God, who is alive] for ever and ever, who is coming upon [theclouds] of heaven, for the sake of the whole human race, Yao1Marvin Meyer and Richard Smith, eds., Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts ofRitual Power (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999), 280."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"  –    [Sabaoth] ..., [Adon]ai Eloi ....

Like Eve, Mary is themother of the living. Like Isis, Mary is the deliverer of those in need,and she can liberate those who are in bondage.3A similar presentation of the Virgin Mary and her prayer of poweris now to be found in the recently published Heidelberg Coptic text685.4 This text is a parchment codex consisting of 20 pages—that is,10 leaves or 5 sheets —, which is now part of the manuscript collec-tion of the Institut für Papyrologie in Heidelberg.

As the priest of Isis states, a person observing these wonders will say,“Look, Lucius, who is loosed from his prior bonds and rejoices in the providence ofmighty Isis, is victorious over his fate” (11.15). Similarly, as Robert Ritner remindedme, note may be taken of Isis in an Egyptian spell entitled “Another spell, forreleasing any bandage.” The spell reads as follows: “Released is someone released byIsis—Horus was released by Isis from the evil done to him by his brother Seth whenthe latter killed his father Osiris. O Isis, great of magic, may you release me, may youdeliver me from anything evil, bad or ominous, from the influence of a god, theinfluence of a goddess, (from) a male dead, a female dead, from a male opponent, afemale opponent who might oppose themselves against me—just as you were re-leased and were delivered from your son Horus” (in J.F.

Most often a formulaic abbreviation,apparently for deina deinos, “NN,” is used. Twice, however, a specificname of a client is provided: Joseph son of Paraseu.Of the spells and recipes in the codex, two dominate by theirlength: the prayer of Mary in the first half of the codex, and theadjuration of the nine guardian angels in the second half of the co-dex. The prayer of Mary is preceded by an opening that describes theoccasion and purpose of the prayer: “This is the 21st prayer (that) theVirgin Mary spoke (on) the day (of) her falling asleep. It restrains allthe powers of the adversary (and) it cures every disease and everysickness, in peace, Amen” (2,1-5). Thereafter the prayer proceedswith words reminiscent of the prayer of Mary from the British Li-brary: “Now Mary lifted up her eyes to heaven, toward God al-mighty. She said, ‘I entreat you today, who exists for ever. I praiseyou today, Yao, who is coming upon the clouds of heaven, Sabaoth,who is stronger than them all, who exists before all the aeons, beforeheaven and earth appeared. Heaven became for you a throne, andthe earth a footstool for your feet. Listen to me today, through yourgreat, blessed name. Let all things submit to me, for I am Mary, I amMariham, I am the mother of the life (of) the whole world, I myselfam NN. Let the rock split before me today, let the iron dissolvebefore me today, let the demons withdraw before me today, let thepowers of the light appear to me, let the angels and the archangelsappear to me today, let the doors that are bolted and closed <open>for me, at once and quickly, so that your name may become myhelper and life, whether in all the day or in all the night’” (2,6-3,11).The prayer of the Virgin Mary from the Heidelberg and Londoncollections belongs to a magical tradition of prayers that sometimeshave been called forms of the prayer of Mary “in Bartos.” Thoughscholars continue to debate the meaning of “Bartos,” an Ethiopicversion specifies that Mary uttered the prayer in a village of Bartos,possibly the Parthians.8 In addition to the prayer of Mary in theHeidelberg and London collections, versions of the prayer are knownfrom Coptic, Ethiopic, Syriac, and Arabic sources. Some of the clos-est parallels to the prayer of Mary in the Heidelberg and Londoncollections are to be found in an unpublished Coptic magical textfrom Cairo, Coptic Museum 4958. This Coptic text, preserved onpapyrus, is quite fragmentary, with the small papyrus fragments8Cf. Angelicus Kropp, Ausgewählte koptische Zaubertexte (Brussels: Fondationégyptologique reine Élisabeth, 1930-31), 2.134, 3.220-24; S.

The prayer, then, is said to be soefficacious that the iron fetters dissolved and the prison doors opened.As found in the Heidelberg codex and other sources, however, theprayer of Mary includes little or no narrative context describingMary’s prayer on behalf of Matthias in prison. Instead, the statementsof release recall, in a more general way, release from prison: rock issplit, iron is dissolved, locked doors are opened (reading ouòn ratherthan the ouònh of the manuscript). This more general sort of releasemay even apply to the wording of the self-predication near the begin-ning of the prayer, where the client or practitioner may identify ex-plicitly with Mary and her power: “I am Mary, I am Mariham, I amthe mother of the life (of) the whole world, I myself am NN” (2,20-22).Furthermore, it is also possible that the power to split wood anddissolve iron may have become something of a magical common-place, attributable to other powers and archons than Mary. Thus inLondon Hay 10391, a text that resembles the Heidelberg codex inother respects, the Great One, strong in his power, reveals himself asfollows: “What do you ask of me today? I shall give it to you. If youask rock of me, I shall split it; if iron, I shall break it off; ... I shalldestroy the foundations of the prison” (22-24).10 If Matthias, or any-one for that matter, needs liberation from shackles, Mary might help,but if Mary is not available, other supernatural safecrackers and rock-smackers might be adjured.During the summer of 1996, at the Sixth International Copto-logical Congress meeting in Münster, two responses to a paper Ipresented on the then unpublished “Magical Book of Mary and theAngels” proved particularly helpful in indicating the geographical9My thanks to Samiha Abd El Shaheed and the staff of the Coptic Museum forallowing me access to Coptic Museum 4958.

As a part of the exploration ofNubian Christianity at Old Dongola, which is located on the NileRiver between the third and fourth cataracts, Jakobielski and hiscolleagues discovered, within the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, acrypt dedicated to Archbishop Georgios, who died in 1113 C.E. andwhose crypt is the site of multiple burials and multiple inscriptions inGreek and Coptic.12 In its appearance the crypt recalls pharaonicpyramids covered within with funerary texts—that is, the pyramidtexts—in hieroglyphic Egyptian. The inscriptions here include refer-ences to the New Testament gospels, signs from a magical alphabet,magical names, cryptograms, lists of the 24 elders, a SATOR-square,texts describing the dormition of Mary and her reception in heaven,a homily attributed to Euodius of Rome—and a Greek version of theprayer of Mary that resembles the prayer of ritual power we havebeen surveying. The reference to the date Tobe 21 in a text in thecrypt reminds us that in some Coptic and Ethiopic traditions it ismaintained that the Virgin Mary died and her soul was assumed intoheaven on Tobe 21 (the assumption of her body was claimed to havetaken place somewhat later). This factor may explain why the prayerof Mary in the Heidelberg codex is called “the 21st prayer (that) theVirgin Mary spoke (on) the day (of) her falling asleep” (2,1-3).The second response in Münster was from a Copt, Zakaria Wahbaby name, who reported that during his childhood his family used anArabic version of a prayer of Mary that was very close to the tradi-tional prayer from the Heidelberg codex, and that he also recalled aCoptic church in Cairo that still celebrated the power of Mary whodissolves iron fetters. The reference to the Arabic prayer is not par-ticularly surprising, since Gérard Viaud, in his work Magie et coutumespopulaires chez les coptes d’Égypte, describes just such a piece, and he also11Marvin Meyer, “The Magical Book of Mary and the Angels (P.

Among the architecturalremains in the sanctuary are old pillars and capitals. On the wallalong the right aisle of the church is a modern icon, in three panels,by Yousef Girgis Ayad, executed in 1706 A.M. (= 1990 C.E.), featur-ing Mary the Theotokos freeing Matthias, who is shown striding forthfrom prison with chains melting off his body. To the left of thiscentral panel Mary is identified as the Theotokos and is shown pray-ing in front of a fortress or prison; to the right Jesus is painted floatingamong the stars, with two angels, probably Michael and Gabriel,peeking out of heaven. Finger marks all over the glass covering thepainting testify to the pious hands of the faithful, and in a Coptic noteunderneath the painting the artist asks that the Lord remember himas well as his father, mother, and two brothers. We were told that thechurch celebrates a festival on Baunah 21 (= July 28), during whichfestival the icon of Mary is paraded through the streets, in a mannersomewhat reminiscent of pharaonic temple processions, and the storyof her miracle with the chains is retold.Although we were not allowed to photograph the modern paintingin the church, we were taken upstairs to the Convent of St. Mary atHarat Zuwaila al-Khurunfish, where a sister showed us another iconof Mary who dissolves chains and frees Matthias. Actually, what wesaw was a print of an icon, the original being at the so-called HangingChurch, al-Muallaqa, the Church of St. Mary built over the Romanfortress in Old Cairo. Along the left aisle of the church is an oldpainting with scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary on the wallabove relics of Keryakous and his mother, Abu Nofer the errantmonk, and other saints. The scenes from the life of Mary form a cycle13Gérard Viaud, Magie et coutumes populaires chez les coptes d’Égypte (Saint-Vincent-sur-Jabron: Editions Présence, 1978).

Stories of ceremoniesand actions involving chains and liberation from chains are not unu-sual in Egypt.15 In a shrine within this Convent of St. George, an ironchain with shackles is displayed against a wall adjacent to an icon ofSt. George, whose tortures at the hands of the Persian King Dadianosand his 69 fellow kings involved the use of chains, supposedly thesevery chains. I observed the pious as they paused to place this chain ontheir necks and hands to kiss it, for, the accompanying legend an-nounces, “This chain is a cause of blessing because it was put on thebody of the martyr and on it his blood ran.”16 Touching the chain, itis maintained, can bring miracles and cast out evil spirits. Thesedeeds of power are accomplished, it is added, “by faith,” a theologicalclaim known from other texts of ritual power (for example, PapyrusOxyrhynchus 924).17On the basis of this brief survey of traditions pertaining to theprayer of Mary who dissolves chains, two sets of related questionsremain. (1) Given David Frankfurter’s observations on historiolae andritual power, what is the relationship between historiolae and the15Cf., for instance, Otto F. A. Meinardus, Christian Egypt, Ancient and Modern (Cairo:Cahiers d’histoire égyptienne, 1965), 195, on the Church of St. George: “Thosesuffering from mental diseases were chained for twenty-four hours to the wall in frontof the relics. They were given bread and water only, and after the experience theywere released as cured!” At the Orange conference Ernest Tune also recalled asimilar ceremony he encountered on a trip to Cairo during the 1980s. At a church inOld Cairo (Tune recalls that it may have been the Church of St. Barbara) a priestwas officiating at a ceremony with a man who was dressed in a business suit but wasalso bound with chains, which were subsequently removed from the man.16Cf. also History and the Biographies of the Great Martyrs Saint George the Roman and SaintGeorge of Alexandria (Cairo: Convent of St. George, 1995).17Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 924 asks that a woman named Aria be protected fromseveral sorts of fever, and goes on to state, “You shall do these things [graciously] andcompletely, first on account of your will and also on account of her faith, because sheis a handmaid of the living God, and that your name may be glorified continually”(7-13; cf.

Whatcontrol, if any, does the historiola exercise over the praxis of magic?What power, what narrative power, does it provide, and what redi-rection of empowerment occurs with the loss of connection with thestory?19 (2) Given several explorations of magic, ritual power, andissues of taxonomy at the Lawrence conference and in the resultantBrill volume, how do we classify and interpret the texts and acts ofpower discussed in this paper?20 I prefer to use the category of ritualpower, and to see varieties of manifestation of ritual power arrangedalong a continuum. The supposed appropriate or inappropriatemanifestations of ritual power derive, I suggest, from the perspectiveof the practitioners, and the practitioners of ritual power who are atthe center of political and social power in a group commonly deter-mine who is at the center and who is at the periphery of ritual power,that is, who performs miracles and who practices magic. Hence Maryand the chains are found in Coptic magic, in iconography, and inliturgy, both in the center and on the periphery of religious and sociallife in Egypt. But beyond these political and social considerations,how, if at all, do we distinguish the magical Mary of texts of ritualpower from the miraculous Mary of the Coptic church? Does thehistoriola, particularly in the larger context of the life of Mary, bestowlegitimacy, propriety, and centrality to Mary’s acts of power? Doesthe controlling function of the historiola in the life of the churchrender the resultant ritual power more manageable and less threaten-ing? Mary still is in control of the chains, but the question remains,who is in control of Mary?18David Frankfurter, “Narrating Power: The Theory and Practice of the MagicalHistoriola in Ritual Spells,” pp. 457-76 in Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, ed. by MarvinMeyer and Paul Mirecki (Religions in the Graeco-Roman World 129; Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1995).19At the Orange conference Fritz Graf suggested that at times the historiola mightbe implied and generally known, though not explicitly recorded.20Cf. especially the essays by Jonathan Z.

The figure ofSimon Magus has a remarkable two-facedness about it. According tothe heresiologists of the second century, he was the first heretic andthe father of Gnosticism; while the authors of apocryphal gospels andacts portray him as the charlatan, trickster, and magician par excellence.This paper will examine the relationship between the two faces ofSimon Magus with a view to understanding the way that some proto-orthodox Christians understood the terms “magic” and “magician.”We first meet Simon in the New Testament book of Acts (8.4-24).He is described as a man from Samaria “who had previouslypracticed magic in the city” (prou ph=rxen e)n t$= po/lei mageu/wn) andwho was hailed by his followers as “that power from God which iscalled Great” (h( du/namij tou= qeou= h( kaloume/nh Mega/lh).2 The reader istold that Simon was baptized and converted to Christianity by Philipwhile he was still in Samaria. After a somewhat abrupt break in thenarrative, Simon sees Peter “giving” the Holy Spirit to the people ofJerusalem through the laying on of hands, and Simon offers to payfor the secret that will allow him to do the same thing. Peter chastizeshim, and Simon responds simply by asking the Christians for prayers1a)ndria/ntaj poiei= peripatei=n kai\\ e)pi\\ pu=r kulio/menoj ou) kai/etai, e)noi/te de\\ kai\\ pe/tataikai\\ e)k li/qon aãrtouj poiei=, oãfij gi/netai, ei)j aiÕga petaporfou=tai, dipro/swpoj gi/netai(Bernhard Rehm, ed., Die Pseudoklementinen I: Homilien [Akademie-Verlag, Berlin:1969], 49).

By this point, the character hasbeen christened Simon Magus: Simon “the Magician.” He is depictedas the father of all heresies and the inventor of labyrinthine andhopelessly misguided Gnostic theologies. The reader who only knowsSimon from the New Testament might be surprised at the complexityof the “Simonian” theological systems that are described by Irenaeusand Hippolytus. After all, the role of magic is hardly primary in Acts8, and Simon’s philosophical views make no appearance there at all.Like his humble acceptance of Peter’s admonishment, and like hisinability to give the Holy Spirit to those whom he baptizes even at theend of the story, Simon’s “shady past” as a magician appears to servesimply as a way to emphasize his inferiority to the Christian apostles.Not so in the minds of the heresiologists. Simon is portrayed as thepowerful and deadly force behind every heresy at work in the au-thors’ own times. Justin writes that, during the reign of ClaudiusCaesar (i.e., 41-54 ..), Simon began to travel and preach in thecompany of a reformed prostitute named Helen. Curiously, Simon issaid to have described Helen to his followers as his “first thought,” orennoia, which is a very prominent concept in later Gnostic writings.Justin goes on to urge his audience (which ostensibly includes theemperor Antoninus Pius) to take down a statue that has been erectedon the Tiber in Simon’s honour and to which his devotees pay hom-age (First Apology, 26).4Irenaeus of Lyons, writing around the year 180, adds a few detailsto Justin’s account. He writes that Helen, the “first thought” or ennoiathat Justin mentioned, was described by Simon as “the Mother of allthings.” She was conceived by Simon (who thought of himself as3An informative discussion of this story can be found in Morton Smith, “TheAccount of Simon Magus in Acts 8,” in Harry Austryn Wolfson Jubilee Volume, vol.

Theangels, however, rebelled and began to pursue Helen, chasing herfrom body to body with the desire to violate her sexually. Eventuallyshe resigned herself to the life of the prostitute in Tyre that Simon (ina human form) had to rescue from her fate. Simon claimed that hisreunion with his ennoia would provide salvation for all of his followers(Against the Heresies, 1.23.1-4).5 Incidentally, Irenaeus is the first authorto form an explicit connection between Simon Magus and the Simonof the New Testament; although it is likely that Justin had the Simonof Acts 8 in mind when he wrote his First Apology, he appears to drawall of his details about Simon’s life from other sources.About half a century later, the bishop Hippolytus provides hisreaders with a more detailed look at Simon’s philosophy. To this end,he quotes at length from a document entitled the Great Announcement,purported to have been written by Simon himself (The Refutation of AllHeresies, 6.11.1-19).6 The cosmogony that is laid out in this text isextremely complex, and a detailed discussion of it is not necessary formy purposes.7 Suffice it to say that Simonian theories—includingthose which state that fire is the originating principle of the universe(6.9.3), and that Eden is really the womb (6.14.7), and that Simon canbe associated with the god Jupiter and his companion Helen with thegoddess Minerva (6.20.1)—might well make the orthodox Christianreader feel very far from familiar theological territory.But Justin, Irenaeus, and Hippolytus each take care to point outthat Simon, for all of his philosophizing, is still a magician. Justincomplains that Simon “did mighty works of magic, and beguiledmany people, and still keep[s] them deceived” (First Apology 56.1).85A delightful article on the development of the Helen myth is Dennis R.MacDonald’s “Intertexuality in Simon’s ‘Redemption’ of Helen the Whore: Homer,Heresiologists, and The Acts of Andrew” in The Society of Biblical Literature Seminar Papers1990 (Scholars Press, Atlanta: 1990), 336-343.6I refer to the edition prepared by Miroslav Marcovich, Hippolytus: Refutatio Om-nium Haeresium (Walter de Gruyter, New York: 1986), 216-228. Note that some ear-lier editors of the Refutation number the chapters differently; this section can be foundin 6.6-6.14 in those editions.7There is a great deal of scholarly literature which focuses on the relationshipbetween the Simon tradition and Gnosticism; the Great Announcement is usually dis-cussed in that context.

They make useof exorcisms and incantations. Philtres too, and love-charms, and so-called familiars, and dream-senders (AH, 1.23.4).9Hippolytus repeats these accusations (Refutation, 6.20.1), and then goeson to add a postcript about the end of Simon’s life. He writes thatSimon invited his own followers to dig a ditch in which to bury himalive, claiming that he would rise on the third day. “He remainedthere to this day,” Hippolytus sneers, “for he was not the Christ”(Refutation, 6.20.3).10 Blending descriptions of Simon’s heresy with ac-cusations of “magical” practices in this way is an approach that waseventually to be followed by almost all of the heresiologists who fol-low these three, and legends about Simon’s exploits continued to bewritten well into the Middle Ages.11It seems obvious that Hippolytus could not have filled thirteenchapters of his heresiology with a complicated emanationist philoso-phy that he made up out of whole cloth. One would have to be quitecynical about the sources to suggest that versions of these religioussystems were not in currency somewhere; otherwise, our authorswould have been left with very little about which to complain. Thequestion then becomes: how could these heresiologists, writing a cen-tury and a half after the events depicted in the New Testament,associate the character in Acts with the “Simonian” cults that theysaw around them?Scholars have provided a number of different possible answers tothis question.

The answers to these questions start to appear in the othersources that refer to Simon, that is to say, the sources that concernthemselves less with theology and more with miracle-working.The extant stories about Simon are quite colourful. They oftenpick up on the theme, already visible in Acts 8, of comparing his“magic” (unfavourably, of course) to the true miracles that the apos-tles perform. Hippolytus’ story about Simon’s failed attempt at aChrist-like resurrection has already been mentioned. The apocryphalActs of Peter goes on at some length describing various contests be-tween Simon and Peter, including one event where Simon kills a boythrough magic and Peter outdoes him by raising the same boy fromthe dead.16 In the fourth-century Apostolic Constitutions, Simon is said tohave died after breaking his thigh in a botched attempt to fly. 17Arnobius of Sicca, in his work entitled Against the Heathen from thesame time period, says that Simon committed suicide after breaking13Such as Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism and Early Christianity, rev. (New York,Harper and Row: 1966), 75. For an interesting theory that a magician mentioned inJosephus is actually the Simon of whom the heresiologists speak, see H. Waitz,“Simon Magus in altchristlichen Literatur” in Zeitschrift für neutestamentliche Wissenchaft(1904), 127f.14The first proponent of this view was F.C. Baur in his article “Die Christuspartiein Korinth,” in Tübinger Zeitschrift für Theologie (1831). For a discussion of the Tübingenschool and its critics, see G.N.L.

For the writers and readers of these accounts, a very sharpdistinction needed to be drawn between magic and miracle; this dis-tinction served to remind Christians that what they were doing wasnot temporary, illusory, or petty like “magic.” This point is madeexplicit in the Clementine Homilies, noted earlier, and the closely relatedset of stories known as the Clementine Recognitions. After being asked theentirely reasonable question of how to tell the “signs” of magiciansapart from true miracles, the apostle Peter is made to answer:“For tell me, I pray you, what is the use of showing statues walking, dogsof brass or stone barking, mountains leaping, flying through the air, andthe like, which you say that Simon did? The things which are of good aredirected to the welfare of men. Such are those which our Lord did, whomade the blind see and the deaf hear, raised up the feeble and the lame,drove away sicknesses and demons, raised the dead, and the like, as yousee me do too” (Recognitions 3.60).19Peter does not mention that Simon also claimed that he had “pro-duced many new sprouts from the earth, and made them bear leavesand produce fruit in a moment,” or that he could order a sickle toreap ten times more quickly than a human could;20 nor does he drawattention to the fact that Jesus walked on water and cursed a fig18Book 2, chapter 12.

Immediately before hebegins his explication of Simonian philosophy, Hippolytus tells a briefstory about a Libyan magician named Apsethus. Apsethus trainedsome parrots to announce “Apsethus is a god,” and then set themfree. People going about their daily business would then hear thebirds speaking about Apsethus, and in their astonishment, they wouldcome to the conclusion that Apsethus really was a god. However, aclever Greek, having figured out the magician’s trick, captured anumber of the parrots and trained them to say “Apsethus, havingcaged us, compelled us to say, ‘Apsethus is a god.’” When they heardthis new announcement, the people who had been duped decidedunanimously to burn Apsethus (6.7.2-6.8.4).“This is how we must think concerning Simon the magician,”Hippolytus writes. “If . . . the sorcerer was the subject of a passionsimilar to that of Apsethus, let us endeavour to re-educate Simon’sparrots: Christ was not Simon” (6.9.1).23 For Hippolytus, then,Simon’s followers were simply caged birds squawking phrases thatthey were trained to say, while Christians had developed genuinephilosophical insight about the way the universe worked. Presumably,the right thing to do at this point would be to teach Simon’s parrotsthe truth about Jesus. However, it is not clear just how far Hippolytuswould have been willing to take this metaphor: are parrots not stillparrots, no matter who trains them?21It has been pointed out that the devil challenged Jesus to make bread out ofstones in Luke 4.1-13 (parallel in Matthew 4.1-11); this might make the “usefulness”of the miracle described in Homilies 2.32 seem suspicious to orthodox readers.22C.K. Barrett maintains that the difference that Christians saw between them-selves and magicians was that magicians greedily charged money for their services(“Light on the Holy Spirit from Simon Magus” in J. Kremer, ed., Les Actes des Apôtres,[Leuven University Press: 1979], 288f). Money is certainly an important theme inActs 8, and throughout Luke’s work; however, it has less prominence in the Clemen-tine literature. I will treat Christians’ willingness to do their miracles free of charge asa subset of their general desire to be philanthropic with their “magic.”23Ouàtwj h(ghte/on <tou\\j> Si/mwna to\\n ma/gon [...] ei) [...] o( ma/goj pa/qoj ti paraplh/sion§Aye/q%, e)pixeirh/somen metadida/skein tou= Si/mwnoj tou\\j yittakou\\j oàti Xristo\\j ou)k hÕnSi/mwn.

Whether a givenevent counts as a miracle or as a magical practice can therefore onlybe answered in the context of “Who did it?” and “Whom does thedoer serve?”. However, one can only answer the second question ifone understands the theology of the person who is being investigated.Hence the heresiologists’ intense scrutiny of the Simonians’ religiousbeliefs: if Simon’s followers consider their human leader a god, thentheir actions—whatever those actions may be—quite simply do notbelong in the realm of genuine prayer or miracle.Nevertheless, it would be misleading to suggest that Simon’s theol-ogy provided the “base” target for these Christian authors’ attacks,and that the accusations about magic served merely to embellish orentertain. The Clementine documents and the apocryphal gospelsand acts are not primarily theological treatises; rather, they aremostly concerned with proving the supremacy of Christian teachingthrough rather transparent morality tales. Within the context of thosetales, Simon’s status as a magos is his primary defining characteristic,and the dangers associated with it are taken quite seriously. Yet eventhese texts emphasize the absurdities that their narrators see inSimon’s philosophies about issues such as creation or salvation.24 Thepriorities are reversed here, but the symbiotic relationship betweenmagic and heresy remains: in other words, for all of Simon’sspellcasting, he’s still a bad philosopher.It is important not to lose sight of the fact that Roman authoritiesmay well have considered Simon’s sect Christian. To some extent,the same can be said of the heresiologists as well: something must beChristian, at least to some degree, to qualify as a heresy. Simonianattitudes about the creation of the universe through fire may not seemvery Christian to the post-Nicene reader, but the holders of thosebeliefs probably considered themselves Christian, and the Emperor towhom Justin’s book was addressed almost certainly did. Justin writes:“All those who take their opinions from these people . . . are calledChristians, just as also those philosophers who do not share the sameviews are yet all called by one common name of philosophy” (First24The argument between Simon and Peter about the nature of sin, which can befound in Homilies 19.15 and Recognitions 3.21, may serve as an example."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"  ‒    Apology, 26.6).25 Justin goes on to register his frustration with the factthat “real” Christians are persecuted by Roman authorities whileSimonians are allowed to preach their heresies unmolested. Simon’sfollowers are thus portrayed as being doubly dangerous: first, becausethey can be confused with Christians, and second, because that con-fusion does not last long enough to bring persecution upon them.Of course, the irony of the whole situation is that one of the mostfrequent accusations that was levelled against Christians was that theypracticed magic. Their mysterious meals, their nighttime vigils, theirscorn for Roman gods, their “miracle-working”: these suspicious ac-tivities were among the reasons why Roman authorities outlawed thereligion in the first place.26 It is therefore no surprise that authors likeJustin Martyr were especially sensitive about accusations from thatquarter; by this point, there was already a long history of miracle-workers who wished to distance themselves from magicians andquacks, but the need to do so for these Christians must have feltparticularly urgent.* * *The subject of “magic” has been attracting a great deal of scholarlyattention during the past thirty years or so. At this conference, schol-ars from around the world are revising outdated conceptual models,and testing each revision with care. I would like to conclude my ownstudy, first by drawing attention to one important contribution to thelively debate about magic in the ancient world—namely, DavidAune’s 1980 article entitled “Magic in early Christianity”27—andthen by venturing a suggestion as to how the case of Simon Magusmay refine that model.25<Kai\\> pa/ntej oi( a)po\\ tou/twn o(rmw/menoi, w(j eàfhmen, Xristianoi\\ kalou=ntai, oán tro/ponkai\\ oi( ou) koinwnou=ntej tw=n au)tw=n dogma/twn <e)n> toi=j filoso/foij to\\ e)pikathgorou/menonoãnoma th=j filosofi/aj koino\\n eãxousin.

The fact that individual laws changefrom culture to culture does not make “law” an indefinable term, andthere are some elements that many cultures’ laws have in common.So the term “magic” may be salvageable even though it is impossibleto define any single action (withering a fig tree, for instance) as intrin-sically magical, as opposed to miraculous or something else entirely.I think that the case of Simon Magus shows how useful Aune’sformulation is, not only when considering practices that are com-pared between religions (e.g., Christians and pagans), but also forthose that are compared within a religious tradition (e.g., Simon andPeter). In spite of—or perhaps even because of—the marginalizationof their religion by Roman society at large, Christians of the secondand third centuries felt the need to draw their own religious bounda-ries carefully.Simon’s uncomfortable intimacy with his opponents was part ofthe reason why their attacks against him were particularly venomous.In their struggles to make their own religion seem legitimate andrational, Christians had to be very precise about whom they wouldconsider part of their camp. The language of heresy was developed inorder to exclude troublesome philosophies like Simon’s. Troublesomeactions, imagined or real, were then dismissed as magic, because thatwas the language with which such actions had been dismissed forcenturies.It is unfortunate that the vocabulary of action does not share thenuances that the vocabulary of belief does: while terms like “heretic”and “schismatic” and “apostate” and even “member of another reli-gion” each serve to describe the credal and institutional orientation ofan Other, the term “magician” is forced to denote all of the danger-28In a classic article entitled “Sorcery, Demons, and the Rise of Christianity fromLate Antiquity into the Middle Ages” (in Mary Douglas, ed., Witchcraft Confessions andAccusations [Tavistock Publications, New York: 1970], 17-45), Peter Brown discussesways in which this sort of deviance could be particularly alarming to inhabitants ofthe Roman Empire.

Thus it would not be unreasonable to expect that a ritualcarried out 600 years ago consulting the manuscripts to be discussedwould not vary significantly from a ritual based on consultation of thesame or a similar manuscript today. The Arabic manuscripts, in turn,were probably culled from even earlier sources.The first manuscript to be examined in this article is the Shamsal-Ma ́arif al-Kubra, attributed to one of the most famous ArabMuslim magicians, Ahmad bin Ali al-Buni, although it has beensuggested to be a pseudepigraphic work composed during the early14th century C.E.4 Whoever its compiler may have been, the bookappears to be of a composite nature from a variety of sources, some2R.

Draw theseal on it with a knife whose handle is made from it [i.e., the wax]. Strikeany part of the image desired and therefore that part will be paralyzedbecause of it immediately.18[Text 3] If you want to tie the sleep of whomever you want, then fashionhis image from wax, draw the seal on it, fasten it in the waistband of yourtrousers, and tie the legs of the trousers together. Therefore the oneagainst whom the magic is worked cannot sleep as long as the trousersremain tied.19[Text 4] If you want to harm someone or bring him sadness, grief andworry, then take a long-necked jar in the name of whomever you wantand the name of his mother, and draw the seal on it after you draw thepicture of the desired one on it.

You will seewonders, God willing.26When one compares the preceding texts and figurine with the in-structions found in ancient Egyptian and Greek papyri as well asearlier archaeological remains of execration figures, it becomes obvi-ous that the practice has changed little in 5000 years, with regards tothe substances used to make the figurines, the tortures to which theyare subjected, and the places in which they are deposited.In the Arabic texts, we see a variety of objects used to representthe victim: wax, a potsherd, a jar, paper, copper, and a frog. Themost common substance used to make the figurine is wax. Often, thefigurine is burned, as in text 1 and the figurine from Fustat, and asreported in an ethnographic account from the 1920s.27 By virtue ofthe destructive nature of burning itself, the ancient archaeologicalevidence of the use is limited,28 but is well-attested in ancient texts.29However, some of the ancient Egyptian and Greek texts indicate thatburial of wax figurines or placement in water was also possible, simi-lar to texts 6 and 8 respectively.The equation of the victim with a pot (text 4) or a potsherd (text 5)on which his picture has been drawn has precedents in ancient timesas well. In at least one case, bowls on which the names of the victimswere written took the place of figurines.30 Similarly, on ancient stelaeto protect against animal bites, the gods were petitioned to seal theirmouths and to make them like potsherds in the street.31 An oraculardecree meant to protect a child from potential causes of death in-cluded “death by potsherd,”32 while an unbaked potsherd appearstwice among the corpus of Greek magical texts from Egypt as the26Henein and Banquis, La magie par les psaumes, 72 (Arabic), 79-80 (French).27W.

The ethno-graphic literature also contains reports of the making of paper dolls,or simply pieces of paper in special geometric shapes, to harm some-one.36 There are no archaeological parallels for this from ancienttimes, because a figure made from papyrus could hardly have sur-vived the ritual described in several execration texts preserved inEgyptian papyri which called for making figures of the kings’ enemieson new papyrus (which would have been white) on which their nameswere written.37In text 6, it seems that the figure is made from copper, whileperhaps a wax figure is made simultaneously. The making of two33PGM XXXVI.189 (see H. D. Betz, ed., The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation,Including the Demotic Spells.

In the Greco-Romanperiod copper was specified as the material for making needles ornails to pierce execration figures.39Wild animals and figures of them were often closely associatedwith foreign enemies in ancient Egypt,40 and thus could be used torepresent an enemy in the execration ritual. In particular, the PGMforeshadows the role frogs play in Arabic texts. In one case, thetongue of a frog is trampled,41 while another text, which has anumber of other parallels in the Arabic texts, identified the victimwith a frog.42 Another animal that often was involved in the execra-tion ritual was the fish.43 In one ancient text, figurines were said to beplaced in fish skin.44 In another case, the name of the victim wasinscribed, using a fish bone on the chest of a wax figure representinghim.45 In a text from Esna Temple, the victims were identified withthe fish.46Blood could also be used as a component in the manufacture ofexecration figurines. In text 7, fish blood is used to write on the pieceof paper. In one ancient text, cattle blood was said to be mixed with38One ancient execration ritual text calls for drawing a figure of the victim onpapyrus as well as making his image out of wax (Faulkner, The Papyrus Bremner-Rhind[British Museum No. 10188], line 23, 6; line 26, 3; line 26, 20; and line 28, 16;Faulkner, “The Bremner-Rhind Papyrus-III” 168, 171-172, 174; Faulkner, “TheBremner-Rhind Papyrus-IV” 42).

The frog inthe Greek text mentioned previously was supposed to be hung upfrom a reed.50 In text 7, the paper was suspended in a pot by a threadin running water; a Greek text suggests a similar practice with thebad things desired being written on a lead lamella suspended by acord in a stream or bath drain. As in text 7, the effect could benegated by removing and untying it.51 The figurine excavated atFustat had a thread wrapped around its chest, while being suspendedupside down by its foot.52 Suspension by the foot means that thefigure would be placed upside down, a posture that was quite com-monly said to be inflicted upon enemies and the damned in ancientEgyptian thought and represented in art,53 and upside-down demons47Schott, “Totenbuchspruch 175 in einem Ritual zur Vernichtung von Feinden,”185-86; in another text, a tendon of a red cow is bound to the figurine (cf.

The ethno-graphic literature contains reports of attacking execration figurineswith knives, needles, pins, sharp palm leaf points, or nails.56 In thefigurine from Fustat and in text 1, rose thorns are used. The stabbingof enemies with knives played an important role in ancient Egyptianmythology,57 and similar tortures are well attested in the ancient tex-tual and archaeological record.58Ancient texts called for dismembering the figurine with a knife.59As with the figurine from Fustat, loose arms and legs were found inancient caches of execration figurines as well.60Placing the figurines in a jar is one of the most distinctive featuresof the Egyptian execration ritual. Not only were enemies and evilbeings said to be in jars in ancient Egyptian texts,61 but there alsohave been several pots excavated that contained one or more execra-tion figurines.62 Just as is called for in texts 7 and 9, the pot in oneGreek text is specified as a new one.63 All of the ancient examples ofpots used for execration that have been found were red; in text 1, thepot called for is a black one, like the one excavated at Fustat.

The ancient texts indicate that immer-sion in water or burning were other options, which would have de-stroyed the evidence for the placing of figurines in places other thanthe cemetery, and even when burned or submerged, the figurinesmay still have been conceptualized as being buried. For instance, oneancient text calls for the burial of the figurine in the place of execu-tion.67We are reliant on texts for ancient evidence of placing figurinesinto water. The fish in the text from Esna Temple mentioned earlierwere thrown in a canal at the end of the ritual.68 A Greek text calledfor placing the figurine in a pot filled with water.69 Likewise, two ofthe Egyptian Arabic texts (6 and 7) call for placing the figurine in apot and burying it in a canal running toward the east,70 Blackmanreported that placing clay figurines in water is only done in caseswhere the death of the victim is desired.Bath water is sprinkled on lime in text 1 in order to produce acaustic eye-irritating reaction. Bath water is a common element in theArabic magic texts, including this very same manuscript,71 and the64Schott, “Totenbuchspruch 175 in einem Ritual zur Vernichtung von Feinden,”185-86; Faulkner, The Papyrus Bremner-Rhind (British Museum No. 10188), 26, 3;Faulkner, “The Bremner-Rhind Papyrus-III,” 171.65Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, 172-73.66The “forgotten tomb” is said by Doutté to be common in Islamic magic; theone text he gives in support of this assertion comes from a magical manuscript fromEgypt (Doutté, Magie & religion dans l’Afrique du Nord, 225, 303).67Schott, “Totenbuchspruch 175 in einem Ritual zur Vernichtung von Feinden,”187.68Sauneron, Les fêtes religeuses d’Esna, 25; Sauneron, Le temple d’Esna, 15-16, no. 199.69Maltomini, “I Papiri Greci,” 98, 112.70Cf.

On theother hand, the original function and the religious background inwhich the ritual is couched has not remained so static.Execration did not remain solely as state-sponsored magic. Car-ried out as part of regular temple ritual, it gradually would have beenadopted by priests for private use. With one exception, the evidencefor this borrowing all dates to the Late Period and consists of templetexts copied and modified for private use.81 As a result, Greco-Romantimes witnessed a flourishing in the use of the execration ritual forprivate ends similar to those treated in the Arabic texts. Fowden hassuggested that pharaonic magic used in the Greek magical texts fromEgypt had already been “render[ed] plausible” for an audience not aswell-versed in ancient Egyptian mythology as their predecessors hadbeen by a simplification of the religious elements of the formulae,82although Ritner has pointed out that in most cases it simply entailedsubstituting the Greek equivalent for the name of an Egyptian god.83In late antiquity, as many of the new monks bore Egyptiantheophoric names, Meyer suggested that they began their careers inthe pagan temples before converting to Christianity, taking the magi-cal rituals they had learned in the temples with them to the monaster-ies.84 Although this is possible, it is not the only plausible scenario.Although I have focused in this paper on two Arabic magic texts fromIslamic and Christian traditions, and their antecedents in Egyptianand Greek texts, there are other texts that suggests a more dynamicinterchange of magical praxis between religions and languages whichcan be expanded to include Jewish traditions. In fact, an Arab authorof the 11th century C.E. stated that the magic practiced by Muslims,Christians and Jews was the same because they all used words ofunknown meaning and spirits to achieve their goals.85The Egyptian text from Esna temple I mentioned earlier whichinvolved writing the victim’s name on a piece of papyrus attached tofishes’ mouths has its closest parallel in a Jewish Egyptian magic text,in which a lead lamella inscribed with a spell was inserted into the81Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, 206 n 953.82G.

In fact, this is notthe only Syrian Christian text in existence utilizing psalms for magicpurposes.89An Arabic text collected in Algeria in the early part of this centurycalls for placing the spell (a passage from the Quran) written on a redpiece of paper in the mouth of a frog, tying its mouth shut with a redsilk thread, suspending it upside down in running water by a threadattached to its left leg, and then reading the Quranic verse over it 21times. The victim will become sick until being upon the point ofdeath, but the effect can be negated by removing the text from thefrog’s mouth.90 This text, with the exception of its Quranic verse, ismost closely paralleled by our Christian manuscript.A text from the Cairo Geniza that has been dated to the 11thcentury suggests another type of transmission. This text, meant tocause a hemorrhage in a woman bears a striking resemblance to ourtexts 6 and 7, among others. It reads, in Hebrew: “To cause someonehemorrhage. Write on the day of Mars on a blank piece of paper withink. Bind it in a red silk purse and lay it on a reed. Bury it in a canalrunning toward the east. This is what you write...”.

Anumber of texts for love magic from the Geniza collection containsimilar, or even identical techniques to those found in the execrationtexts in Egyptian, Coptic, Greek and Arabic.With the coming of Christianity, it has been suggested by Reesthat the only change was the formulae (the psalms) used and thepowers invoked.94 With the conversion of much of the population toIslam, these same elements were further modified. Quranic verses areincluded in the formula to be spoken while performing the execrationritual in al-Buni’s manual.95 Quranic verses that contain references tothe destruction of evildoers are reported to have been spoken orwritten to accompany the execration ritual in Egypt, as well as Alge-ria.96 Blackman says that the magician would utter incantations at thesame time he placed the figurine in water or fire.97 The Arab histo-rian Ibn Khaldun reported that the magician recited formulas whilespitting on the figurine, and that the saliva contained evil spirits thatwould help to carry out the procedure.98 These examples are nothingbut transformations of the ancient ritual, which involved spitting onthe figurine multiple times,99 while also invoking various gods to carryout the harm which was desired upon the figurine.100 In text 8, the92Almost identical instructions, to take a piece of new cloth, put it in a reed pipe,and bury it in the bank of a running river occurs in a solely Aramaic magic text fromthe Geniza collection, on which, see J.

In both an Islamic text (1), anda Christian one (9), the ritual is said to be effective due to the will ofGod. Thus, we see that a virtual web of borrowings between pagan,Jewish, Christian and Islamic magicians are possible routes of trans-mission. This said, it is hardly surprising that sometimes ChristianEgyptians visit Muslim magical practitioners, and vice versa,101 just asmembers of the two religions venerate each other’s saints.102The transmission of these magical practices across the ages hasproceeded in spite of the prohibitions against them. In ancient times,the execration ritual was seen as essential for maintaining the properfunctioning of the Egyptian state.103 Evidence coming from a royalperspective indicates that in ancient Egypt execration was acceptableif used by the king’s magicians against his enemies, but was not per-mitted to be used against the king.104 Both Islam and Christianityofficially disapprove of the practice of execration. In discussing aHebrew magical text from Egypt, Morgan postulated that the praxeisadopted from the Greek and Aramaic tradition were “provided witha cosmological framework intended to make them appear as legiti-mate Jewish practices.”105 They would not be considered legitimateJewish practices by Jewish theologians, however, and Muslim andChristian theologians would disagree with the suggestion thatQuranic verses, Biblical passages or even the intervention of Godhimself would have any effect in carrying out the desired effects of themagical operations. In his study of magic in North Africa, Douttésingled out execration as being considered the worst type of magic byMuslims, because it combines the practice of magic with the fashion-ing of images.106 In fact, it is considered forbidden by Islamic juris-101Al-Jawharì, Al-Diràsa al-'Illmiyya lil-'àdàt wa al-Taqàlìd al-Sha'biyya- Al-Juz’ al-Thànì min dalìl al-'Amal al-Maydànì li-Jàmi Ì al-Turàth al-Sha’bì, 73; Finbert, Le Nil: fleuvedu paradis, passim.102V.
