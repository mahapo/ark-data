There is certainly no shortage ofbooks on the subject. Several general surveys of the witch trials andnumerous regional and micro studies have been published for anEnglish-speaking readership. While the quality of publications onwitchcraft has been high, some regions and topics have received lessattention over the years. The aim of this series is to help illuminatethese lesser known or little studied aspects of the history of witchcraftand magic. It will also encourage the development of a broader corpusof work in other related areas of magic and the supernatural, such asangels, devils, spirits, ghosts, folk healing and divination. To helpfurther our understanding and interest in this wider history of beliefsand practices, the series will include research that looks beyond theusual focus on Western Europe and that also explores their relevanceand influence from the medieval to the modern period.ix9780230_507883_01_prexiv.pdf 1/11/07 10:16 AM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AbbreviationsHPHighland Papers, 4 vols.

This is notthe same question as asking why people hunted witches, since manypeople believed in witches but did not hunt them. Still, it was thewitch-hunts, which in Scotland lasted from the middle of the sixteenthcentury to the early eighteenth, which made these beliefs historicallyimportant; they were a matter of life or death. Witch-hunting alsogenerated most of the evidence for witchcraft beliefs. But witchcrafthas almost always had an important place in people’s cosmology, help-ing them to organise their ideas about neighbourliness and charity,good and evil, and indeed God and the Devil. Hence the idea for thisbook.People ‘believed’ – in what? In God and the Devil; in angels; if theywere Catholic, in saints and the Virgin Mary; in fairies; and of coursein witches. These are fields which we, today, assign to the realm of‘belief’ in the sense that they are beyond scientific proof. But in theearly modern period, ‘beliefs’ could range more widely. We can also saythat people ‘believed’ that south-running water had curative proper-ties, that field strips should be divided among the farming communityin a ‘sunwise’ (clockwise) pattern, or that gifts should be given at NewYear. The first of these ‘beliefs’ would today be assigned to the realm ofscience – it is testable empirically; the second and third would belongto cultural convention or even fashion.‘Belief’ is thus a problematic term. One problem is that it appears tobe about people’s inner thoughts, which are not themselves directlyaccessible; we have only their words, written or spoken, which we mustuse as indirect evidence for their thoughts. Another problem is that the9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"word may be value-laden. Today, ‘knowledge’ is something we approveof; ‘superstition’ is something we disapprove of; ‘belief’ tends to liesomewhere in between. Early modern folk, by contrast, mainly usedthe term ‘belief’ in the Christian sense, to refer to aspects of their religious system that were so important as to be beyond knowledge.God was held ultimately to be unknowable by mere humans, so that‘belief’ was the best that they could manage. Unlike God, witches wereperfectly knowable, but if we wrote of people’s ‘knowledge’ of witches,we would appear to endorse their ideas. Perhaps we should write aboutpeople’s ‘ideas’, ‘thoughts’, ‘modes of thought’ or even ‘modes of reasoning’. These terms, however, might be cumbersome and hard touse accurately, and the term ‘belief’ has become conventional. Wehope that its use in the following pages will be accepted once thesecaveats are acknowledged.Witchcraft beliefs were about witchcraft, but those who have studiedthem have generally assumed that they have a wider relevance: only aparticular kind of society could have held such beliefs. Such an assump-tion must take into account the monumental work of Stuart Clark, whohas argued for the essential autonomy of witchcraft belief. Clark’s argu-ments are drawn directly from the thought of an intellectual elite, but arealso applicable in principle to other strata of ‘belief’. To the extent that heis saying that witchcraft beliefs should not be made into surrogates for‘some set of circumstances (social, political, economic, biological, psychic,or whatever) that was objectively real in itself but gave rise to objectivelyfalse beliefs’, then he has our support.1As historians it is our job simply toexplain the beliefs of the past; we do not have to endorse these beliefs,nor do we have to denounce them. Nor would we wish to explain themaway as being ‘really’ about something else – misogyny, for example, orstate formation.Still, what emerges in the following pages is not a sharply-definedpicture of witchcraft as a single entity, detached from everything else. Witchcraft beliefs were articulated in a broader system of thoughtand action, and ‘witchcraft’ itself is hard to see as a single entityanyway. Owen Davies’s chapter below ranges from treasure seekingand the staunching of bleeding to learned speculation about thereading habits of the fairies. Edward J. Cowan’s chapter takes in the jew’s harp used for a witches’ dance, charms used in midwifery,and visits to a standing stone. Julian Goodare’s chapter discusses spirit-voyages to another world. All these were ‘witchcraft’, at least in a broadsense, making it a singularly diverse and indeed almost omnipresentphenomenon.2Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"IThis book is about witchcraft and belief at all levels of Scottish society,from the learned elite to the common folk. One of the many achieve-ments of Christina Larner, the greatest scholar of Scottish witchcraft,was to draw attention to the issues connected with studying the beliefsof a pre-industrial European society – neither a ‘primitive’ society inwhich it was assumed that everyone would share traditional, magicalbeliefs, nor a ‘modern’ society in which it was assumed that everyonewould share rational, scientific beliefs. Pre-industrial Scotland, Larnerpointed out, was a ‘middle-range’ society, with elements of both. Shewent on to observe that even the beliefs of allegedly ‘modern’ societieswere far from entirely rational or scientific, partly because not every-one in them was all that well educated, and partly because many areasof life were not amenable to scientific treatment. This might haveallowed her to regard pre-industrial Scotland as similar to modernsociety, but she instead argued that it should be treated as an ‘alienbelief system’. The point was that the partial continuities of beliefbetween the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries tended to distortpeople’s understanding. The seventeenth-century idea of a trinitarianGod seemed reasonable because it had survived into the twentiethcentury, but this made the seventeenth-century idea of witchcraft,which had failed to survive, seem more ‘exotic’ than it really was.2Whether the beliefs discussed in this book are ‘exotic’ may be left forthe reader to determine, but some of them will certainly seem quiteunusual.If early modern Scotland, then, was a ‘middle-range’ society, its dif-ferent levels could be categorised in different ways. The basic distinc-tion, made in many witchcraft studies, is that between elite andpopular belief. As Peter Burke has shown, the elite were not detachedfrom popular culture, but they had distinct beliefs and traditions towhich the common folk had no access.3Within the elite there weresubdivisions; we may wish to focus on the propertied elite or the intel-lectual elite. The two were not identical, and we should beware ofassuming that elite women, in particular, were necessarily well educated (a point to which we shall return). Still, all these ‘elites’moved in at least some of the same circles, and significant divergencesof belief were unlikely to pass without comment.Scotland seems to have had relatively little witchcraft in its courtlyceremonies. The ‘triumph’ of 1566 for the baptism of Prince Jamesincluded three ‘contrefait devillis’ as part of a disparate group whoJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller39780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ritually assaulted Stirling Castle. Much of the imagery for the 1566triumph was taken from the French festivals at Bayonne in 1565, but atBayonne there was more magic. There, Elizabeth of Valois broke acharm by which the classical witch Circe had metamorphosed someknights and ladies into rocks and trees, and finally an enchanted castle,defended by demons, was successfully assaulted by Charles IX. AtStirling, by contrast, the royal castle was successfully defendedagainst amotley band of attackers who included Moors and highland men as well as the ‘devillis’.4The theme of divinely-ordained royal power asthe only force able to overcome evil magic, which became increasinglycommon in European courtly festivals in the later sixteenth century,seems to have been even more strikingly absent from the festivals ofJames VI.5One of the ways in which Stuart Clark has demonstrated the embed-dedness of witchcraft in early modern society is by linking it to thedivine right of kings. When ‘political authority was thought to betheocratic’, the crime of witchcraft ‘assumed the terrible proportions ofa threat to cosmological order’; in a constitutional regime, by contrast,it became ‘little more than a particularly nasty felony’.6This is surelyrelevant to Scotland – a country which, for its size, may have con-tributed more to the divine right of kings than any other, but whichbecame a constitutional regime after two seventeenth-century revolu-tions. Scotland’s two most notable divine-right theorists, James VI andSir George Mackenzie, are also noted for their interest in witch-hunting– though James was keen on it while Mackenzie was a sceptic.7It hasbeen suggested that Mackenzie was able to articulate the divine legit-imation of monarchy in practice by persecuting the covenanters whochallenged the regime of Charles II, and so had no need also to huntwitches;8more work on this subject would be desirable.Witchcraft beliefs were closely linked with religious beliefs, at leastfor the elite, and religious commitment varied. This is linked to theissue of intellectual life, since the most prominent and public Scottishintellectuals were ministers. A charismatic minister could have a remark-able effect on his congregation.9There were also distinct movements ofcommitted Protestants, which in the complex political history of earlymodern Scotland sometimes found themselves in opposition to thegovernment. A few regions had enclaves of surviving Catholics. How-ever, witchcraft was not, on the whole, a weapon in religious contro-versy. This is in contrast to places like France, where cases of demonicpossession were exploited by the Catholic authorities. Brian Levack’schapter below shows that the Scots had hardly any cases of demonic4Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"possession until after the very late outbreak of Protestant possession atSalem.10There seems to have been considerable elite interest in necromancyin sixteenth-century Scotland. Necromancy involved summoning ofdemons; it was a learned concept, distinct from witchcraft, thoughdemonologists made use of what was known about necromancers anddemons in conceptualising the demonic pact made by witches. An‘eldritch’ comic poem from the early sixteenth century, ‘Lord Fergus’sGaist’, parodied necromancers’ activities in erudite detail.11John Knoxwas repeatedly accused of necromancy by Catholic opponents, andresponded by preaching frequently against it.12His concern may haveinfluenced the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, which condemned‘necromancie’ as well as witchcraft.13Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie’s racychronicle, written in the 1570s, mentioned the subject twice, using thevariant form ‘igramancie’. At the royal tournament of the Black Lady in1507–8, Andrew Forman, bishop of Moray, who ‘was ane Igramanciar’,arranged that ‘thair come ane clwdd out of the rwffe of the hall asappeirit to men and opnit and cleikkit vp the blak lady in presence ofthame all that scho was no more seine’.14This appears to have been aconjuring trick rather than operative magic, but indicates the concep-tual range within which the topic was discussed. Darker and more seriouswas Pitscottie’s comment on a contemporary scandal. John Kello, minis-ter of Spott, executed for murdering his wife in 1570, allegedly ‘confessitbefoir his deid that the temtatioun of the deuill causit him to committhat filthie cryme he useand the airt of Igrimancie and siclyk he confessitthat sindrie vthiris ministeris vsit that same’.15A more official account,responding defensively to such rumours, stated that Kello ‘tooke Godand his angels to witnesse that he never had anie ingresse in magick,nor was farther curious to understand, than God had manifested in HisWord’.16Then there was the case of Richard Graham, a necromancerwith a number of elite connections, caught up in the North Berwickwitchcraft panic of 1590–1.17There is probably more work to be doneon elite uses of magic.The general arbiter of questions of belief was the church. The church’srole in witch-hunting has still to be fully explored, but the generalimportance of ministers and their supporting committees, the kirk sessions, seems well established.18When it comes to witchcraft belief,however, things are less clear. Why did ministers write so much aboutother aspects of systematic theology, but so little about witchcraft?Witches, after all, entered a pact with the Devil, and this was surely acrucial part of the range of religious positions that it was possible toJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller59780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"adopt. Scotland’s theology was Calvinist, focused on the distinctionbetween the elect and the unregenerate, and one might have expectedtheologians to discuss whether making the demonic pact was an exer-cise in free will. The criminal courts and the general public regardedwitches as personally responsible for their actions, but Calvinist the-ologians tended to minimise human free will (though not of course toabolish it) and to emphasise awe-inspiring divine justice. If theologiansperceived a tension between the eternal decrees that predestined peopleto salvation or damnation, and the apparent voluntarism of the demonicpact, or if they wondered about related questions like whether a memberof the elect could make a pact, they do not seem to have done so inprint. This becomes even more surprising when the covenanting strandin Scottish theology is considered, emphasising the general or parti-cular agreements that God made with his people.19The demonic pactcould be considered as a covenant – but if it was, then theologians ofcovenanting did not usually say so.Ministers were not just theologians. They had pastoral responsibil-ities and faced the challenge of theodicy – how to explain the essentialgoodness of divine providence in a world filled with evil and suffering.This sometimes entailed their preaching and writing against aspects ofpopular witchcraft belief, in order to persuade parishioners that theirmisfortunes might come, not from witches, but directly from God inorder to punish their sins or (as with the story of Job) to test theirfaith.20Although we know less than we might of preaching and pastoral work in Scotland, there is little direct evidence of ministersexpressing such concerns.Further research may well clarify whether these apparent silences werereal. In the meantime, we may draw attention to some exceptions – to afew occasions when ministers did discuss witchcraft in such ways. Thefirst is James Anderson, minister of Collace, who wrote a long religiouspoem in c.1578–82 which included some lines classifying various typesof ungodliness. He called on the Lord to ‘purge’ the landFrom Idolater and Hypocrite,From Athist, Papist and Jesuite,And from the usurs of Sathans sprite,By Witch-craft any way.21This set out a wide range of positions that it was possible that theunregenerate could adopt. They could be ‘papists’ – Anderson was muchconcerned by the Catholic threat, and ‘idolaters’ and ‘Jesuits’ were also6Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Catholics. ‘Hypocrites’ were those outwardly professing Protestantismbut without real commitment to it (presumably lacking divine grace).The ‘Athist’ position, including not only those who disbelieved in Godbut also those who accepted Christian theology only partially, was alsoindicated. And ‘Witch-craft’ was mentioned. What Anderson meant bythe ‘usurs of Sathans sprite’ is unclear; ‘usurs’ might mean ‘usurers’ butis more likely to be a variant spelling of ‘users’, in which case hisphrase probably meant ‘users of demonic power’.Anderson’s writings come quite early in the story of Scottish witch-hunting. We next move forward a century, to a published sermon of1679 by Archibald Riddell, the former minister of Kippen who hadbecome a covenanting field preacher. He urged sinners to repent, even‘if thou had been a witch, and had made an actual portion with thedevil, and would break the bargain now with the devil, and wouldmake a new bargain with our King Christ’.22This set up an equivalencebetween the two ‘bargains’, and in passing also answered the question,sometimes raised by demonologists, of whether the demonic pact wasirrevocable. Finally we have a book of 1702 by James Clark, minister ofthe Tron Kirk, Glasgow, which stated:They are undenyably reproveable, who, instead of covenanting withGod, do covenant with Satan, we mean here, witches, those rene-gado witches, of which it is storied, that they enter into an expresscompact with the devil, formally renouncing their baptismal covenant,and all their claim to Christ, and from the crown of the head to thesole of the foot, devote themselves to him: What ever truth theremay be in this, or whatever way these enchanted miscreants take inthis diabolical transaction, I know not, neither will I dispute, butsure I am, it is a sad truth, that they who excamb, or niffer Christfor the devil, make a black bargain.23Here we have again an explicit parallel between divine and diabolical‘covenanting’. But Clark had become aware of the difficulties attachedto traditional witchcraft belief and was not prepared to commit himselfto it. His work provides an illustration of why two other ministersaround this time felt impelled to publish tracts defending witchcraftbelief.24Traditional demonological orthodoxy would later be upheldby James Erskine, Lord Grange, in his learned parliamentary speechagainst the repeal of the English and Scottish Witchcraft Acts in 1736 –only to be greeted by a ‘Titter of Laughter’ in the House of Commons.25The learned controversy over witchcraft belief is discussed in detail byJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller79780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Michael Wasser in his chapter below, and the long timespan of thecontroversy underlines the importance of his statement that ‘the dis-crediting of witch beliefs was a process, not an event, and took placeover an extended period of time’.26James Clark wrote his cautious remarks at the height of interest indemonic possession in Scotland, following the celebrated Paisley trialsof 1697. Brian Levack sets Scottish demonic possession in a wide com-parative context, from France and Geneva to Russia. He points out thatthe late seventeenth century, when Scotland produced a sudden flurryof possession cases, was a time when most such cases came from Calvinistcountries. He also points to ‘English dissenters, New England puritans,and Scottish presbyterians’ as those keenest to defend belief in a spiritworld at this time, thus making a further contribution to the emergingliterature on the demonic dimension to intellectual life in these earlyyears of the Scientific Revolution.27More thoroughgoing scepticism about Scottish witchcraft, again accom-panied by laughter, had already come from England. Richard Franck,an officer in Cromwell’s army occupying Scotland in the 1650s, wrotean account of a fishing tour during which he visited a region alleged tobe the haunt of witches. ‘Now that witches inhabit near this Lough ofPitloil, I am of opinion, provided there be any. But whether there be orbe not such mortal demons, I suspend my judgment.’ He recounted an‘adventure’ in which a local woman’s dog attacked one of Franck’s butwas then set upon by another of his dogs, whereupon ‘the hag ... washeard to express unsavory words, very diabolical, with charms andthreats; besides various antick gestures and postures, both with her headand body; that at present occasioned abundance of laughter’ amongFranck’s companions.28‘Antick’ meant grotesque, and it is clear thatFranck neither feared her anger nor took her seriously as having realpowers. He thought that witches were simply uncouth hags living inremote and uncivilised places.IIGiven the difficulty of pinning down and defining ‘belief’ in general,to attempt a working definition of popular witchcraft belief is evenharder. Nevertheless, given that we have some indication of elite ideasfrom printed demonological and theological material, it is relevantthat we consider the wider aspects of popular witchcraft belief as perpetuated by Scottish society, both elite and non-elite. As has beenmentioned, Scottish society between 1563 and 1736 was a middle-8Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"range society, neither primitive nor entirely modern. It should also bereiterated that so-called ‘popular’ beliefs and practices were not the solepreserve of the non-elite members of society; everyone, at all levels,shared many of them.Popular beliefs were, and are, an amalgamation of traditions, customsand practices that have evolved over generations. To some extent,therefore, to understand popular witchcraft belief we need to look atpopular witchcraft practice. What those accused of witchcraft claimedto do, and even practices carried out by the vast majority of the popu-lation, may help us uncover what people believed.29In many cases thepractices, or rites, rituals and ceremonies, may have come before thebelief, and demonstrated the importance of community over the indi-vidual.30Ceremonies were developed and defined as sacred and wereimportant communal acts which were performed to ensure the survivalof the group. Over time, these ceremonies and rites may have formedthe basis for religious belief and as such were reorganised and recast topromote the orthodoxy of whichever religious organisation influencedsociety. In the case of Europe and Scotland this was Christianity. Thefundamental motive for these beliefs and practices was an attempt tounderstand how things worked – or didn’t in many cases.Larner was sceptical about the relevance to witchcraft beliefs of the‘functionalist’ theory that beliefs could be explained by their socialfunction. However, she was discussing the application of the theory towitch prosecution rather than to its popular practice.31She dismissedthe theory of community tension proposed by Keith Thomas and AlanMacfarlane as having had no influence on witch prosecution in Scotlandbecause demonological motifs, rather than neighbourhood accusa-tions, featured more in Scottish trials than in English ones.32Whilestraightforward community tension may not have been the drivingforce behind witch prosecution in Scotland, it is clear from LaurenMartin and Joyce Miller’s recent work that some of Larner’s interpreta-tion can be modified. Miller argues that although the Devil did featurein Scottish witch trials it was in a more complex manifestation thanthat proposed by demonologists, and Martin demonstrates a wide regionalvariation in intensity of witch prosecution, suggesting that local factors,which may have included some examples of community or family rival-ries and tension, were just as important as international demonologicaltheories.33Popular witchcraft belief and practice in Scotland appear todemonstrate a combination of demonological and functional influences.In Scotland, the issue of regional variation comes up particularlywith the Highlands, that large and distinctive Gaelic-speaking regionJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller99780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"with its own culture and traditions that were often at odds with thevalues of the Lowland-based Scottish state. It has been conventional tosay that there was little or no witchcraft prosecution in the Highlands,but Lizanne Henderson’s pioneering chapter below demonstrates thatthis is not the whole story.34Highlanders prosecuted witches less, butcertainly believed in them just as much. Highland beliefs were broadlysimilar to Lowland ones though with rather fewer demonic elementsand rather more fairy elements. The issue of the diversity of the ‘elite’comes up here; Henderson’s chapter is largely about folk belief butseveral Highland chiefs participated in it, and even Martin Martin – agraduate and pioneer ethnographer who rubbed shoulders with Fellowsof the Royal Society – accepted the idea of second sight.It was the relative absence of the local church courts that gave rise tomuch of the apparent Highland distinctiveness concerning witchcraft.The religious authorities were worried by powers which were deemednot to derive from God, or were antagonistic to God. Popular witch-craft beliefs in early modern Scotland, as in most other areas in Europe,were more a reflection of everyday fears and anxieties than of anydesire to participate in malevolent witchcraft or demonic power. Con-cerns over having enough food or being fit enough to work – or not –seem ordinary when compared to the weighty matters of good versusevil, God versus the Devil, debated by the elite. Many rituals simplyaimed to maximise good fortune but were regarded as superstitious by the religious authorities. Thus the allocation of a piece of non-cultivated land to the ‘Guidman’ (the Devil), the sprinkling of specialwater on the ground prior to cultivation or the passing of livestockthrough the embers of a fire were all attempts to ensure an adequatefood supply.35There was no guarantee of success; any benefits couldbe, and were, attributed to correct observance of certain rituals or prac-tices but failure or bad luck could always be explained by the use ofincorrect actions – or alternatively by someone practising malevolentwitchcraft. The use of such everyday rituals did not indicate any delib-erate desire to invoke evil or demons. On the contrary, the Guidman’sCroft was a peace offering to prevent demonic power from spoiling thecrops. Most popular practices demonstrated a belief in apotropaic orprotective magic.For much of the population, it seems likely that beliefs reflected acombination of Christian and pragmatic survival needs. Christianitydid not have a monopoly on popular beliefs but, as the dominant force,could define what was sacred and acceptable, and what was profane andthus unacceptable. As Edward J. Cowan discusses in his chapter, prac-10Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"tices that were not deemed acceptable were superstitious and profane,and any practice not controlled by the church was magical.36Religionwas sacred and magic was profane, despite sharing many of the sameorigins. The rivalry between magic and religion was not straightforward;they were part of the same spectrum of belief. According to KeithThomas, ‘the distinction between magic and religion had been blurred’.37The sacerdotalism of the priest or minister offering spiritual relief forsuffering overlapped with the ‘religious’ ceremonies and motifs thatwere incorporated into the practices of the charmers or healers, orindeed seen in the many rituals which did not require the presence ofany special person. It is clear that society was, for the most part, able toreconcile participation in all forms of ritual. For many there was nodilemma of conscience in attending an official church service, evenafter the Reformation, yet at the same time collecting well water orsouth-running water to cure illness or protect their livestock.As a counterpart to Cowan’s emphasis on the attack on popularculture, Owen Davies’s chapter on cunning-folk and charmers focusesmore on the cultural role of these providers of early modern commu-nity services. He brings an explicit comparative perspective to hisanalysis, having worked on cunning-folk in England and France. Hischapter argues that Scottish cunning-folk can be better understood bymoving beyond the blanket term ‘charmers’ that has usually beenapplied to them, in order to identify their diverse nature. He alsoaddresses such pressing but neglected questions as: To what extentwere charmers and cunning-folk caught up in the witch trials? Wherewere their powers supposed to come from? How distinctive were thecharms they used? This takes us a long way from witch-hunting butsheds light on a vital aspect of popular belief.38Devil-worshipping witches were important, especially for the elite; alarge majority of witchcraft trials in the central court of justiciary haddemonic elements.39However, for many demonologists, beneficial orprotective practices were more threatening simply because they weremore popular. The beneficial or protective practices of witchcraft mostinterested the majority of society, and it was from these errors of‘superstition’ that the demonologists wanted to save their congrega-tions. These practices included many witchcraft motifs: prophecy orsecond sight, malefice or harming, healing or charming, the presence ofthe Devil or some manifestations of spirits. It is difficult to disentanglethe many strands of belief and decide what was elite and what waspopular, except that we can get an indication of what was regarded aswitchcraft or popular magic through demonological exposition andJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller119780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the condemning of certain practices.40Witchcraft was, as Clark pointsout, a ‘set of cultural practices’ rather than a fixed set of beliefs.41Perhaps we will never be able to identify precise epistemological prin-ciples behind European popular witchcraft beliefs. Or perhaps, giventhe criticisms of those who have previously attempted such a task, wemay wish to avoid taking the risk.42Nevertheless we can see that theconcept of ‘superstition’ was used to categorise as profane many every-day customs and habits. These profane acts were sometimes regardedas the result of ignorance or misunderstanding – a lack of the correctreligious knowledge – the implication being that religion was the onlyvalid set of beliefs. Yet for most, popular witchcraft belief was not aconscious attempt to follow a set of beliefs which rivalled religion, butmerely a wish to continue participating in aspects of their culturalmores whether or not they fully believed in, or understood, them.Demonic witchcraft and all its attendant demonic features, such asthe demonic pact, can be identified relatively easily by historians. Itspresence in confessions means that we can assess, to some extent, theinfluence of elite ideas about witchcraft. Or rather what we can measureis its importance to the prosecuting authorities. What it cannot tell usis how much these demonic motifs were an accurate reflection of pop-ular beliefs about witchcraft or whether they appeared because thoseprosecuting wanted to find them. Unlike elite demonological ideas,popular ideas about witchcraft did not treat it as a straightforwardantithesis to Christian belief. It seems to have had a complex and con-stantly shifting set of practices, and since our interpretation of it dependsheavily on the opinions of its opponents it may continue to elude exact definition. Clearly there are demonic strands reflected in thematerial but Joyce Miller demonstrates that Devil figures both hadvarious manifestations that were recognised by demonological theory,and also appeared in a number of other guises – angels, ghosts, dom-estic spirits – that reflected wider, popular cultural meanings of thedemonic.43Lauren Martin’s chapter is also pertinent to the question of popularattitudes to the demonic. She analyses the peak years of Scottish witch-craft prosecution from the point of view of ‘witch-accusing communities’,thus offering ‘a change in focus from witch-hunting and witch-huntersto the processes of witchcraft belief and experience’. She suggests thatthere has been too much emphasis on the ‘conspiratorial, often elite-based, aspects of demonic witchcraft’ and urges an examination of the‘more obvious and mundane aspects of witchcraft prosecution andbelief that emerged in and through local community relationships’.4412Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Before we have this kind of evidence from witchcraft trials, some ofthe best evidence of how the Devil was understood comes from fiction.Priscilla Bawcutt has discussed ‘elrich fantasyis’ in Middle Scots poetry.The word ‘elrich’ or ‘eldrich’ emerged at the beginning of the sixteenthcentury to mean something like ‘uncanny’ or ‘weird’. The poems involveinteraction with an otherworld, whether this is heaven, hell or fairy-land.45One such poem, ‘Rowll’s Cursing’, probably written about 1500,gives a detailed portrait of some demons that is only partly humorous:The forme of thir vgly devillisThay hafe lang tailis on thair heilisand rumpillis hingand on thair tailis [(part of a tail) hangingDragoun heidis & warwolf nalisWt glowrane evne as glitterand glass[glowering eyes; glitteringWt bowgillis & hornis maid of brass[bogles (i.e. ghosts)And dyverss facis repleit wt yrespowand vemmin & sparkis of fyre[spewing venomAnd sum wt teith and tegir tungisattour thair chin wt bludy dungis[besides; ‘dungis’ unclearSpottit and sprinklit vp & dounReid attry lyk a scorpioun[venomousAnd sum ar smeith & sum ar ruch[smooth; roughAnd sum ar lyk ane serpentis sluch[skinWt prik mule eiris sum ar lyk[pricked-up earsThair eiris neiss ar lyk ane midding tyk [ears (and) nose; dunghill dogWt gaipand mowth richt yaip to swelly[gaping; open; swallowThe mair the less devill in his bellyOf thair fowle fegoris na man can tell [figuresThot thay wer sevin yeiris in hell ...46The mention of werewolves is interesting since no accounts have beenfound of werewolves in Scotland. This shows an apparent internation-alism that is also part of Julian Goodare’s approach to Scottish beliefs.Perhaps the most significant point about the poem’s demons is thatthey seem basically to be animals, with horns, tails and ‘dragon heidis’– unlike the later devils described by Miller, who are much more oftenbasically humanoid. Witch-hunting may have prompted significantshifts of belief. Once people’s understanding of the Devil was organisedaround the demonic pact, this was easier to conceive like a humanrelationship, especially when (as was normal for female witches) thepact was consummated by sexual intercourse.

However, Melville contin-ued, ‘he cam down out of the pulpit, and caused all the company tocom and kiss his ers, quhilk they said was cauld lyk yce; his body washard lyk yrn, as they thocht that handled him; his faice was terrible,his noise lyk the bek of ane egle, gret bournyng eyn; his handis andlegis wer herry, with clawes vpon his handis and feit lyk the griffon,and spak with a how voice’.47Melville’s Devil, apparently human butwith numerous and prominent animal characteristics, points us towardsthe Continental Devil who often appeared to the witch as human butwho then revealed a cloven hoof or other animal feature.48Miller hasseveral such cases in Scotland, but one of the most notable findings ofher research is the diversity of descriptions of the Devil.In Scotland, Edward J. Cowan shows that witchcraft had been ofconcern from before the time of the Reformation in the sixteenthcentury. He takes a particular period – the 1590s – as a case-study ofwhere the Reformation had got to by that date. Witch-hunting, forCowan, is part of an attack on popular culture in order to promotegodliness: ‘in challenging witches, Kirk and State were tackling theculture of the subordinate classes of Scotland head on’. However, hisprimary concern is to document that culture, using the rich records of the prosecutions to uncover a quantity of fascinating folk-belief concerning a wide variety of occupations and social activities.49Thus it was that popular customs such as visiting wells and lightingbonfires came to be regarded as ‘idolatrie or superstitioun thairatexpres againis Godis law’, punishable ultimately by excommunica-tion.50But it is also clear from kirk minutes that many people did notstop their customs immediately. It has generally been accepted that theReformed Church’s clampdown on festivities and popular customs hadsome measure of success, but many superstitious rituals continued wellinto the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.51Of course, like witch-craft trial material, reports of superstitious practices and questioning ofindividuals under suspicion can never really indicate what peoplebelieved. We know that people went to wells to seek cures for ill-health. We know that people said they believed they got help fromcarrying out certain rituals such as passing a certain number of timesaround a well, washing themselves with the water, even drinking the water, and possibly leaving a thread or some other offering at thewell.52But what we cannot know is what people understood to be14Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the principles behind these rituals: in other words how they reallyworked. We can never really know what or how people felt, let alonereally believed. Thus people may have carried out popular witchcraftpractices but we will never know how much they really believed in them.We can, of course, argue that the very fact that people continued touse these customs indicates that there was something lacking in theofficial religion of the time. Perhaps the Calvinist form of Protestantismthat was on offer in post-Reformation Scotland did not provide enoughspiritual or physical comfort, particularly in the first decades after 1560.Fears about the causes of illness and misfortune were complex in earlymodern society and disease narratives were expressed by the suffererand their families, rather than outsiders such as priests, ministers oreven physicians. This meant that believing that misfortune was theresult of demonic intervention through the actions of witches, or ofdangerous spirits themselves, allowed society the means to counteractthe harm done.53In Scotland, the Protestant kirk removed this aspectof religious worship, but the alternatives of prayer and personal con-templation were not entirely adequate.54Popular magical or witchcraft beliefs continued despite the actionsand words of the authorities both theological and judicial, from thelate sixteenth century. The same is true at the end of the age of witch-craft: the eighteenth century. The opinions of the authorities changedas the fear of the reality of the practice declined amongst the elite.There were many reasons for the decriminalisation of witchcraft andMichael Wasser discusses the importance of changing scientific ideas,particularly those relating to the mechanical view of world.55However,it would seem that popular belief in witchcraft, which had survived itscriminalisation, continued throughout the age of enlightenment anddecriminalisation, and beyond. Cases of witchcraft were investigatedthroughout Scotland during the late eighteenth and into the nine-teenth century, although since they were no longer regarded as crim-inal far fewer accusations were reported.56These cases display many ofthe same motifs seen in earlier material, such as the presence of theDevil, malefice, charming and prophecy, indicating that the funda-mentals had not changed much. This implies the tenacity of popularculture and its ability to survive, and evolve, despite being attacked bythe authorities.So far we have generally approached the question of belief by sep-arating it into ‘elite belief’ and ‘popular belief’, noting that these oftenoverlapped or were complicated by regional or other divisions.

Julian Goodare’s chapter examines a number of key themes of European witch-belief, both among theelite and among the common folk, in order to place Scotland more pre-cisely within each theme. Seen within the picture of European diversity,Scotland emerges as a fairly typical Protestant country, though of courseit has its own regional distinctiveness. In the field of popular belief, thestrong fairy elements in many witchcraft cases are noteworthy. Goodarecompares Scottish fairies with other potentially malevolent non-humanbeings elsewhere in Europe. However, he pays particular attention todeep folkloric beliefs and structures, through which people enteredinto contact with other worlds and other beings; this can be seen asdistinct from the more familiar system of neighbourhood witchcraft,involving quarrels and misfortune. Goodare even suggests that somewitchcraft beliefs and practices were rooted in psychology rather thanculture – part of the shared inheritance of humanity.57IIIScotland has always been an important place for those studying witch-craft beliefs. Some of the most influential pioneering antiquaries in theearly nineteenth century worked on Scottish beliefs: Sir Walter Scott,Sir John Graham Dalyell and Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe.58Moreover,the earliest interest in the subject of witchcraft focused on the dis-covery of popular belief, often regarded as exotic and archaic. In thosedays witch-hunting was a less interesting subject – it was distressing,but easily explained by the bigotry and ignorance of past times. Whatexcited these early scholars of the Romantic era was the profusion offolk beliefs and customs which they found in the witchcraft literature.Today, although witch-hunting has become a more complex subject,folk beliefs and customs retain their scholarly interest – and can bestudied in a more systematic way.The earliest scholars to interest themselves in the history of witch-craft were ‘antiquaries’ – a broad term for those interested in the past,including not just documentary history but also what would now becalled archaeology, ethnology and even geology. Dalyell was a long-serving vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. GeorgeF. Black later worked for the Society in its Museum.59The Museum ofAntiquities, an ancestor of the present Museum of Scotland, is parti-cularly relevant to Hugh Cheape’s chapter on the Museum’s collectionof charms and amulets.60His chapter offers a rare opportunity to re-integrate some of the strands of antiquarianism that have become16Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"separated with greater specialisation. He also shows that fashions of col-lecting have changed and that understandings of the objects collectedhave changed with them. Early modern folk certainly used charms andamulets, and a few objects in the Museum have a documented prove-nance taking us back to those times and illustrating physically the otherreferences in early modern sources to such objects.61However, thesecharms and amulets have been joined in the Museum’s collections bymany others of a more questionable nature. The result is an assembly offascinating objects but one that as a whole tells us more about the historyof antiquarianism over the last two centuries than it does about the use ofreal charms and amulets in the early modern period.In the early twentieth century, Scotland was the locus classicusforMargaret Murray’s notorious theory of a surviving pagan witch-cult.Some of Murray’s most important witches were Isobel Goudie, who madea remarkable series of confessions in 1662, and the North Berwickwitches of 1590–1.62The theory is now discredited, but the enormouspopularity it used to enjoy with sections of the general public has prob-ably contributed to the high public profile that these witches currentlyenjoy.63By contrast, Scotland played little or no part in a much more fruitfulline of scholarly enquiry: the upsurge of anthropological functionalistinterpretation of witchcraft in the third quarter of the twentieth century.The most distinguished proponents of it, Alan Macfarlane and KeithThomas, wrote specifically on England. Christina Larner, by contrast,was from the neighbour discipline of sociology. In a long review ofThomas she expressed herself sceptical of the idea of witchcraft accusa-tions as a ‘gauge of social tension’ (if it was one, it was impossible toread), and argued that Thomas had not explained why witchcraft accu-sations grew in the sixteenth century. For England, and even more forScotland, she urged the study of the growth of law and litigation, andalso of changing late medieval ideas of witchcraft – the ‘intellectualsteps from medieval scepticism to the Malleus Maleficarum’.64She laterwrote of ‘the inapplicability of functional explanation to the witch-hunt as a whole’.65This is no place to review the whole of Larner’sachievement in the study of Scottish witchcraft, but her approach con-tinues to inform most of the research carried out today on the subject.66IVHistorical research on Scottish witchcraft paused for a while after Larner’sefforts but has revived dramatically in the last ten years or so.67OneJulian Goodare and Joyce Miller179780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"development particularly worth noting here is the Survey of ScottishWitchcraft, which went online in 2003. The Survey’s two-year projectcreated a database of nearly 4,000 records and over 600 different fieldsper record which can be used to search for material. Its place in the historiography of Scottish witchcraft studies is important as it reflectsboth continuity and change in both research needs and availability ofmaterial.The idea of recording Scottish witchcraft material was not a productof the twenty-first or even the twentieth century. The three monumentalvolumes of Robert Pitcairn’s Selected Criminal Trials(1833) demon-strated lively interest in the subject; Pitcairn’s work was later continuedin three Stair Society volumes entitled Selected Justiciary Cases(1954,1974).68However, these works were not comprehensive. George F. Blackcompiled what was for its time a remarkably full summary of publishedwitchcraft cases in 1938, and Larner, Lee and McLachlan took the ideaa stage further in the 1970s.69With improvements in computer tech-nology, Stuart Macdonald converted Larner, Lee and McLachlan’s workinto an electronic form which was then used to provide basic biograph-ical and bibliographical material for the Witchcraft Survey’s much morecomplex database.70For the Survey, we recorded as many cases and names as we couldfind, including some that had not been included in previous surveys ortranscriptions. Because of the amount of information and the timeavailable, the Survey could not attempt a full transcription of evidenceand documents, as was done in some of these earlier works, and insteadsummarised and noted significant features of cases. Fuller examinationof cases could then be undertaken as desired by other researchers usingprimary and other sources. The Survey has continued the work doneby earlier historians and other academics and, by attempting as full arecord as possible of people accused, has taken it several stages further.We were fortunate in being able to locate source material more quicklybecause of the work done previously. Nevertheless, the Survey was notsimply a reproduction or repetition of previous works. It had a differ-ent methodology and a very different format.71Crucial to these changeswas the development of more sophisticated and faster computers. Larnerand her team had the use of computer technology but in the 1970scomputers were slow and the programming was complicated. If theywanted some statistical analysis done by computer it took a whole dayto get the answer.72Using the database created by the information tech-nology staff at the University of Edinburgh, a simple query could takeonly a few seconds once the parameters had been set.

Martin and Miller have analysed material both for their indi-vidual chapters and a joint chapter looking at some of the general find-ings from the project.73They have incorporated statistical detail intoexaminations of cultural beliefs about witchcraft prosecution and theDevil, as well as using it to debunk some of the popular myths heldabout witches and witchcraft. Davies located some of his cases for hiscomparison of English and Scottish charmers, or cunning folk, throughthe database.74Goodare, in his wide-ranging examination of Scottishwitchcraft in its European context, cites cases from the database whichillustrate malefice directed at grain, the manifestations of spirits andthe appearance and actions of fairies.75For researchers not based inScotland, the database is an ideal way to speed up research. Researcherswith expertise in a particular place or a particular period can use it toidentify further evidence from all over Scotland at any time between1563 and 1736.One of the strengths of the database is the extensive comparativeanalysis that it facilitates, particularly in the area of cultural beliefs andpractices. Many of the elements or motifs that were recorded related tocultural beliefs, including non-natural beings of all shapes, sizes andnames, details about meetings (what was done, who was there), detailsabout fairies and fairy motifs, magic (particularly sympathetic magic),visions, details about riding with the dead, rituals carried out, diseaseand damage (including both how it was caused and how it was cured),as well as details about the Devil, devil-like figures, what they did andwhat the accused did. With this level of information comparative sta-tistical analysis can be done quite simply, for example comparing fairymotifs with demonic ones. Chronological analysis can also be done,such as comparing the appearance or disappearance of fairy elementswith increased appearance of demonic elements and the Devil. Analysiscan be made of cases which feature malefice and damage to see whattypes of damage concerned the population more.One of the notable features of the Survey’s database is that it enableseasier statistical analysis, yet that is not its only application becausestatistical analysis is of limited use in understanding how society func-tioned, what people did and what they thought.

The Survey of Scottish Witch-craft can allow us to locate instances of particular beliefs, and it isuseful to be able to see how beliefs were distributed geographically andchronologically. But the nature of a belief will only be grasped once wehave conducted close studies of individuals holding and expressing it(and sometimes, perhaps, not even then). The diverse chapters belowcontain many such studies which may add something to our under-standing of the flavour of life in early modern Scotland.We conclude this introduction with one small individual study whichreturns to a point we raised early on: the necessity, and the difficultyamounting almost to impossibility, of separating elite and popularbelief. Elite and popular belief can be seen interacting in the ‘Medita-tions’ of Anne Murray, Lady Halkett.76Halkett lived in the late seven-teenth century, a crucial period for the evolution of elite beliefs onwitchcraft. She was a courtier’s daughter and the widow of a minorlaird, who lived in Dunfermline. As a devout episcopalian, she wroteprofusely to herself on religion and allied subjects. She had some skillas a healer and offered her services publicly. She mainly employed herbsand ointments, backed up with prayers. She had a detailed understand-ing of official religious beliefs and knew that she must avoid any charmsor rituals that might be superstitious. What is interesting is that shewas clearly out of sympathy with witchcraft prosecutions. In 1688 she looked back on her notes for the year 1666:Vpon Michallmas day 7 were burnt for Witches att Toriburne Andby what hath since hapned itt may bee concluded they died inocentas to that guilt for none that condemned them hath (likely) to leaueany thing behind them to preserue there memory.77This moves beyond a belief in the innocence of the seven witches ofnearby Torryburn to a condemnation of their prosecutors; their exe-cution was not just a tragic mistake, but a scandal. However, Halkett’sreasoning was far from the anticlerical Enlightenment critique of witch-20Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_02_intro.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"hunting that would dominate eighteenth-century views. To her, theguilt of the witch-hunters appeared because God had not allowed themto prosper. This pious argument also bypassed the contemporary intel-lectual debate over witchcraft, which, as Michael Wasser’s chapter illus-trates, was dominated by questions of the existence of spirits, and byextension of the ‘mechanical’ world-view made possible by Descartes.78Halkett was a member of the elite, but she had received a non-academiceducation which debarred her from an active part in the debate. Sheread religious books and might have come across one of Wasser’s crucialtexts,Satan’s Invisible World Discoveredby George Sinclair (1685), buther ‘Meditations’ do not mention it. Her idea that God punished theunjust witch-hunters could equally well have been a popular one.Lady Halkett’s tolerant approach to witchcraft later appeared inanother way. In 1697, she heard a report that she herself was beingcalled a witch in Strathearn and Perth. One of her servants ‘told mee ofitt Laughing, as a good sport’. She herself was not amused, but took thereport as a ‘tryall of my Charity faith and Patience’, remembering howone of her friends had been said to be a witch some years earlier.79Quite possibly people talked about Halkett in 1697 because of theprominent witch-hunt in the Paisley area that year.80Such events werenow becoming rare, however. Plenty of people would be rumoured to be witches after 1697, but not many of them would have reason toworry about being prosecuted.Which brings us back to where we began. Witchcraft beliefs havebeen important at many periods in history, but it was in the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries that they were matters of life or death. Thiseven suggests one way of quantifying belief: this set of beliefs, in thisperiod, was held so intensely that people were prepared to kill eachother. Why this was so is a question that has often been discussed; thechapters below may offer some fresh insight into it.Notes1 S. Clark, Thinking with Demons: the Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe(Oxford, 1997), 4. His further argument, apparently to the effect that witch-craft beliefs were simply about the language in which they were expressedand not about the ‘external world’ at all, seems to be addressed more tophilosophers than to historians, and he points out that it applies to allstatements about the world, with no special significance attaching to state-ments about witchcraft: ibid., 6–8.2 C.

This passage, incidentally,provides the first direct confirmation that the seven witches of Torryburnwere in fact executed; Scottish witchcraft records are often reticent on exe-cutions. All that we have known hitherto is that a commission of justiciarywas issued on 8 September 1666 for the trial of Grissel Anderson, AgnesBrown, Margaret Cowie, Margaret Dobbie, Elspeth Guild, Margaret Horneand Christian May: RPC, 3rd ser., ii, 192–3.

Thischapter aims to place Scotland within the broader picture of Europeanwitchcraft. It will concentrate on the period of witch-hunting but willnot primarily be about witch-hunting itself. Instead it will examinewitchcraft and related beliefs, and what they meant to people.IIn the broad picture of European witchcraft, with which we begin, themain point that stood out was that Europeans feared it. Peasantsbelieved that witches could harm them, their families and theirfarming and other activities. Witches acted out of malice and vengeful-ness. Witchcraft was surreptitious, but witches could in principle beidentified. When peasants suspected that a misfortune was due to9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"witchcraft, they would search their memories for someone with whomthey had recently quarrelled (especially noting threats or curses). If theperson fitted a witch stereotype, that was particularly suspicious. Witchstereotypes seem to have had a life of their own, predating the witch-craft trials and enabling accusations to broaden out beyond those heldresponsible for misfortune. The main stereotype included the pointthat witches were normally women – though this was a norm ratherthan an absolute rule. They were also normally old, though again theydid not have to be.The elite believed most of this too, or versions of it. However,European elites also developed a set of distinctive views about witch-craft, sometimes collectively described as demonology. In this, witch-craft could fit into the broader scheme of Christian theology, of sinand redemption, and of the cosmic history of conflict between Godand the Devil between the Creation and the Last Judgement. Witcheswere held to be human beings who made personal pacts with theDevil, entering his service and gaining from him the power to doharm. One particular power they received was the power to fly, andthey could also inflict illness and death. Witches met in secret, in gath-erings often called witches’ sabbaths, to worship the Devil and to plantheir maleficent activities.Although much demonology was distinct from peasant belief, thetwo systems fitted well together. One point of potential conflict wasthat peasants thought of the witches’ powers as being inherent to them– sometimes learned, sometimes inherited. Intellectual demonologywas clear that witches had no inherent powers; their malefices wereimplemented by demons. But peasants and intellectuals could still co-operate in prosecuting witches; no doubt the intellectuals assumedthat they knew better than the peasants.Scotland fits squarely in the middle of this general picture. All of theabove statements about Europe are equally true for Scotland. Thismeans that Scotland is worth studying as a case-study of Europeanwitchcraft, simply because of its typicality. When Scotland is placed inits general European context, it vanishes, becoming indistinguishablefrom its surroundings. Scotland simply isEurope.Yet if we look more closely at the broad European picture, more detailsand diversity rapidly emerge. And if we look more closely at Scotland,all sorts of unusual features emerge. They may be undetectable at ageneral level, but they have their own importance. These Europeanand Scottish pictures will be investigated and compared in four mainareas. Firstly, the content of the everyday quarrels and accusations ofJulian Goodare279780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"malefice will receive brief consideration. Secondly, there will be alonger section digging deeper into popular belief, examining the folk-loric mentalities that formed the context of witchcraft beliefs and prac-tices. Thirdly, there will be a glance at psychological interpretations ofwitchcraft, which in principle are not culture-specific. For the fourthand final section, the focus will shift from the common folk to thebeliefs of the elite. Intellectual demonology has been much studiedand will not be considered in detail here, but the elite’s relationship topopular belief needs to be opened up. What follows cannot be morethan an exploration of some aspects of a very broad subject, but it mayidentify some useful patterns.IIWhat kinds of misfortune did neighbours blame on witchcraft? Askingthe question in this way permits a distinction between neighbours’beliefs and accused witches’ confessions; the latter are fascinating, buttend to contain extraneous elements derived from elite belief or fromfantasy. It is also important to distinguish magical harm from theissues that led to quarrels. Sometimes a quarrel about a particular kindof work would lead to misfortune connected with the work, but notalways.We do not yet have a full statistical analysis of this theme; in duecourse the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft may help to make one poss-ible. In the meantime here are some impressions and suggestions. Themost important misfortunes were human illness and death, and animalillness and death. These came up time and time again. Then there wasinterference with brewing, butter-making, and other household tasks,usually tasks for which women were responsible. This is part of thepattern of women’s work that Lauren Martin has recently discussed.2Men worried that witches would interfere with their work too, par-ticularly in lines of work involving regular dealings with women.Millers and craftsmen often complained about witches’ malefice. JanetMacBirnie in Crawford in 1650 caused a slater to fall off a roof andbreak his neck.3When the parishioners of Dyce complained about thecharmer Isobel Strachan alias Scudder in 1597, their complaint wasattributed to ‘the haill parochin, and in speciall brousteris, smythis,and mylwardis’. Strachan’s speciality was actually love-magic, butwhen it came to malefice it was the brewsters, smiths and mill-wardswho were unusually scared of her.4Millers were often agents of thelandlord in extracting resources from his tenants.28Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"This leads to the question of malefices directed more against land-lords and the elite generally. Some of the Alloa witches, accused in1659, ‘did sitt upon my Lord of Marr his coall workes lyk corbies anddragones and stopt the workes and drowned them’.5This comes from aconfession, not an accusation by a victim, but the elite were in a goodposition to obtain confessions if they suspected malefice against them-selves. The North Berwick witches, accused of treasonable witchcraft in1590, are a prominent example. A full study of malefices directedagainst the elite would be desirable.6Surprisingly absent so far is the production of grain. Accusations byneighbours that witches had interfered with crops in the fields werenot nearly as common as one might expect, given that all the commonfolk of Scotland depended on these crops for subsistence. If witches didattack crops, they almost always targeted particular farmers. One char-acteristic neighbour’s complaint, voiced by farmers and artisans alike,was that a witch had ‘caused their whole estate to fail’. In a farmer’scase this might imply interference with standing crops, but this wasrarely specified. The Crook of Devon witches were said to have ‘trampitdown Thomas White’s rie in the beginning of harvest, 1661’; JanetPaton ‘had broad soals and trampit down more nor any of the rest’.However, this came from a confession. White’s own statement did notmention it, but instead complained about ale not brewing and cattledying.7What would really have frightened Scottish peasants was a sugges-tion that witches might modify the weather, bringing frost, hail orstorms to destroy the crops of the whole community. This hardly everseems to have happened. Storms were raised by some witches, includ-ing Helen Clark in Leith in 1645 – but to attack a fishing fleet, notcrops.8Elspeth Gray in Dun in 1650 was accused of threatening tointerfere with some grain – but at the mill, not in the fields.9Witchesin Lorraine, by contrast, were almost always induced to confess tohaving plotted at the sabbath to destroy the community’s crops; howoften this was a specific accusation by neighbours is less clear, butwitches and neighbours obviously shared the same basic beliefs.10This prompts comparison with Wolfgang Behringer’s argument thatthe weather influenced German witchcraft panics. The late sixteenthand early seventeenth centuries, the period of heaviest prosecution ofwitches, also saw long-term climatic decline, with colder and wettersummers, and more years of harvest failure leading to famine. He pointsto correlations between famines and witchcraft panics, to peasantdemands for prosecution of witches who had damaged the harvest,Julian Goodare299780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"and to demonologists and chroniclers confirming the perception thatwitches had brought bad weather.11This argument is not the wholestory, even for Germany. A statistical survey has found several sugges-tive correlations (though nothing close enough to be statisticallysignificant): plague, warfare (an inverse correlation), wheat prices(before 1650) and climate all display some relationship with witchcraftexecutions.12In Scotland, three of the five great witchcraft panics werein times of high grain prices, but there are alternative explanations forat least two of these panics.13Why this apparent Scottish unconcern? As a pastoral country,Scotland had a higher proportion of farm animals, which had richersymbolic relationships with their owners than did grain crops, andwhich were frequently attacked by witches. German peasants may havebeen especially terrified of hail – regularly blamed on witches inCatholic countries at least – because in wine-growing regions it coulddestroy every single grape within minutes. Bad weather in a field ofScottish oats could do a lot of damage but would not reduce theharvest to zero. One sixteenth-century Scottish commentary on the weather, the Chronicle of Fortirgall, was written by a curate inHighland Perthshire who was effectively a peasant, farming himself. Heprayed for good weather and complained about bad weather, but neversuggested that bad weather might have come from God or the Devil orwas linked at all with the human morality on which he otherwise com-mented extensively.14At present the Scots seem to have been distinc-tive for treating the weather as a purely natural phenomenon.IIIBeneath the surface of neighbourhood witchcraft, there were deeperfolkloric rituals and patterns of belief. Here the obvious name to dropis that of Carlo Ginzburg. He discovered a remarkable cult in the Friuliregion of northern Italy, the benandanti, who flew out at nights inspirit, to do battle with witches for the fertility of the fields, while theirbodies remained in a trance-like state.15Historians have agreed thatthis was extraordinary, but they have not really known what to dowith it. Was the benandanticult unique and exotic, or would all pre-industrial peasants turn out to have had similar beliefs and even cults,if only we had the evidence? And what connections were there withmore familiar witchcraft beliefs? There were at any rate similar figuresin central Europe, including the Hungarian táltos, who engaged inspirit battles as well as folk healing and prophecy.1630Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Ginzburg himself went on to produce a major synthesis of the beliefshe thought were important, which supposedly explained the witches’sabbath as originating in an ecstatic journey to the realm of the dead.This archaic pattern of belief derived from the ancient Celts, and hetraced it back even further to the Scythians of Eurasia. The cast of char-acters who proved this included not just the benandantibut also Orpheus,Oedipus, Cinderella and a seventeenth-century Livonian werewolf.Other scholars have remained puzzled at best, and none have adoptedthe scheme in full.17Still, it can hardly be denied that Ginzburg was onto something. Thespecific scheme he reconstructed, the journey to the realm of the dead,may have relied on suspect and arbitrary connections across culturesand across millennia. But other scholars, more cautious, are findingmaterial of value in this type of evidence.18Deep folkloric beliefs ormythic structures mattered to the way in which the common folk con-ceptualised witchcraft. There is no need to emulate Ginzburg’s plungeinto the archaic past; early modern evidence exists and calls for expla-nation. What it indicates is that people had relationships with otherworlds and other beings that did not necessarily derive from orthodoxChristianity. This is inherently probable.And if so, it is probable for Scotland. Scottish peasants were not provin-cial; they had a cosmopolitan culture, fully accessible to this deep folk-loric material. Orpheus was important to Ginzburg, and Scottish peasantssang Orpheus ballads – in a distinct version in which Eurydice was carriedoff by fairies, and Orpheus rescued her successfully. In Scottish literaryworks, by contrast, a properly classical underworld was retained and the story always ended unhappily. Robert Henryson wrote an eruditefifteenth-century Orpheus poem of this kind. He knew the popular tra-dition, having a ‘fairy’ mentioned by a servant, but anchored his workfirmly within a classical context.19Folklore embraces both traditional beliefs and traditional stories. Inprinciple, the beliefs are literally true for the believers, while the storiesare fiction. In practice the boundary between the two was fuzzy – thoughwe should not patronise pre-industrial folk by suggesting that they didnot recognise a boundary between truth and fiction. Medieval definitionsof magic included conjuring tricks which were recognised as illusions.20Fiction was simply usedin people’s beliefs and ritual practices, as arguablyit is today. This operated at various cultural levels. Ginzburg’s werewolveswere doing something very strange, and crucial to their identity. On theother hand, there was a werewolf cult in Guernsey which was basicallythe local youths dressing up and going on a wild pub crawl.21Julian Goodare319780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"With this in mind, let us take a tour of the non-human inhabitantsof Scotland’s pre-industrial universe, and consider their possible rele-vance to witchcraft. ‘Inhabitants’ were recognisably living beings, butthe life might not be as we know it. The material world itself hadquasi-animistic properties. Objects had ritual significance. The sun,moon, stars and planets were significant in astrology. Places werespecial: churches, churchyards, wells, crossroads, wild places. Evencertain properties – numbers, colours, words, times – had power.22Sothe line between the human inhabitants and their surroundings washard to draw.The first category of non-humans comprises ex-humans. One of thepurposes of Christianity itself was to organise people’s relationship totheir dead ancestors. Some people thought they could have a relation-ship with dead souls in heaven or hell, but usually the souls had to beactive on earth. Ghosts are an under-researched topic in Scotland;23butseveral Scottish witches seem to have had relationships with them,usually as spirit-guides or advisers of some kind. Some may have beenrevenants, in which the physical body was believed to return.24Katherine Sands in Culross in 1675 simply confessed that there weredead people at some of her witches’ meetings; exactly what shethought they were she did not explain.25In confessions like this, combining ghostly and demonic material,the ghosts are probably folkloric. Demonic elements might have beenimposed by the interrogators, but ghosts could not exist in orthodoxProtestant theology; the soul went straight to heaven or hell afterdeath and could not return. However, the common folk were Christianstoo, and some adapted orthodox theology to their own purposes. JeanBrown in Penninghame in 1706 confessed to remarkable dealings withsome ‘good spirits’ to whom she was married. She described them notonly as three young pretty men, but also as the Father, Son and HolyGhost, who had shown her a vision of Judgement Day.26This is areminder that popular belief was not monolithic or unchanging overcenturies; it contained room for variety and even eccentricity.27Closely related to ghosts were the ‘Wild Hunt’ or ‘Furious Horde’,spirits of people who had died prematurely and were compelled towander until their allotted time was up.28No single Scottish caserecords an explicit ‘Wild Hunt’ in full, but its essential components arefound. Elspeth Riach in Kirkwall in 1616 had a ‘blak man’ as a spirit-guide: he ‘callit him selff ane farie man quha wes sumtyme herkinsman callit Johne Stewart quha wes slane be McKy at the doungoing of the soone, and therfor nather deid nor leiving bot wald ever32Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"go betuix the heaven and the earth’.29John Stewart, in Irvine in 1618,said that all those who died suddenly went with the king of Elfland.30Bessie Dunlop, from Lyne, who confessed in 1576, provided thenearest thing to the complete ‘Wild Hunt’. Her spirit-guide, ThomReid, had died prematurely at the battle of Pinkie in 1547. When shewas speaking to him at Restalrig Loch, ‘thair come ane cumpanye ofrydaris by, that maid sic ane dynn as heavin and erd had gane togid-der; and incontinent, thai raid in to the loch, with mony hiddousrumbill. Bot Thom tauld, It was the gude wichtis that wer rydand inMiddil-zerd.’31As with Elspeth Riach’s kinsman, it was unclear whetherBessie Dunlop’s ‘gude wichtis’ were ghosts or fairies; there seems tohave been overlap between the two.This brings us to the fairies. Current research can give the impressionthat many Scottish witches were away with the fairies. Fairies and theiranalogues – elves, trolls, brownies – were important members of thepopular universe in pre-industrial Scotland.32Many Scottish witchcraftsuspects, interrogated about their relationship with the Devil, knewlittle about the Devil and so talked about what they did know: fairies.So long as the interrogators were willing to construe the fairies asdemons, they could have a co-operative, mutually-intelligible relation-ship.33The minister interrogating Margaret Alexander in Livingston in1647 pursued a standard demonic line of questioning, but she con-fessed that she had renounced her baptism to the king of fairies.34Isobel Sinclair in Orkney in 1633 confessed to having been with thefairies; they gave her second sight to detect any ‘fey body’.35Fairies were important in Scotland, and in a European context theymay have played similar roles to other non-human figures found elsewhere. There were the feared strixof classical and Germanic antiq-uity;36the storm-riding ‘witches’ against whom church bells wererung;37the ‘witches’ fought by the benandanti;38and the Sicilian ‘ladiesfrom outside’.39The folkloric child-eating witch was not necessarilyhuman: the witch of ‘Hansel and Gretel’, with her feeble red eyes, orthe Russian ved’ma, of whom Baba Yaga was one.40These figures allplayed different cultural roles from human, neighbourhood witches.Like the fairies, they were typically forest-dwellers or inhabitants ofsome other remote region – symbolic ‘others’ rather than hiddenmembers of one’s own community. They defined symbolic boundariesbetween the pure space of the community and the powerful but dangerous space of the unknown outside it.The Devil was himself a kenspeckle folkloric figure, and some confes-sions drew on this folklore. As with fairies, folk were reluctant to nameJulian Goodare339780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"him, and he was often called the ‘Good Man’. Edinburgh presbytery’scommissioners in 1586 were to ‘inquyre the names of certane croftis orpertis of ground superstitiouslie reportit to be consecrat to the Dewillwnder the name of the gud mane or hynd king’.41The general assem-bly in 1594 denounced the ‘horrible superstitioun used in Garioch anddiverse parts of the countrey, in not labouring ane parcell of grounddedicate to the Devill, under the name of the Goodmans Craft [sc. Croft]’.42Frequent confessions referred to the Devil as a ‘black man’(apparently meaning black-haired, or sometimes perhaps clothed in black); there is no evidence that this was imposed by the interrogators.43The Devil who was hauled up out of the earth with arope by the North Berwick witches sounds folkloric.44There was arecognised Scottish way of renouncing one’s soul to him: placing onehand on one’s head and the other on the sole of one’s foot, and swear-ing everything in between to the Devil. This was demonstrably apopular belief.45The common Scottish idea that the Devil renamed hiswitches may well have been of popular origin, though we shall find itbeing forced on later witches by their interrogators.Christina Larner referred to such beliefs as the ‘new populardemonic’, on the grounds that they were probably learned during theprocess of Protestant indoctrination (reinforced by witch-huntingitself). Stuart Macdonald has disagreed, observing that elaborate folk-loric material concerning the Devil is rare in Fife, and that even thewitches’ sabbath hardly ever appears.46The problem may be method-ological, concerning how to evaluate partial evidence. If beliefs aboutthe Devil are reported only from one of Fife’s four presbyteries, weresuch beliefs absent from the other three? Robin Briggs argues that therewas a ‘coherent body of folklore’ about the witches’ sabbath inLorraine; the more elaborate accounts were probably just those in which the interrogators pressed for more detail.47If this is so forScotland, then the paucity of folkloric material in much of the Scottishevidence indicates that the interrogators did not ask for it, or did notrecord it, rather than that it did not exist. But the question of whatScottish peasants learned about the Devil from Protestant indoctrina-tion remains open.One category of non-human being seems to have been forgotten,rather than learned, in the witch-hunting period. The incubus, a maledemon who visited sleeping women and had sex with them, was arecognised concept in medieval times, along with the succubus, a rarerfemale demon who seduced men. In the thirteenth century, twoDominican friars visited the Western Isles and found a number of34Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"young women afflicted by ‘incubi’; the friars’ preaching expelled thesedemons, who fled into the air with wailing and lamentation.48Verymany Scottish witches confessed to demonic sex, and a few witches’neighbours reported nocturnal visits by a witch, yet the explicit con-cepts of ‘incubi’ and ‘succubi’ rarely if ever appear. This is noteworthybecause Continental demonologists continued to discuss them, includ-ing Martín Del Rio who was otherwise much cited by seventeenth-century Scottish lawyers.49There is scope for further research ondemonic sex, but perhaps the stereotyped nature of the demonic pactin Scotland made the idea of incubi and succubi unnecessary.Next we have a group of characters who were basically versions ofthe witches themselves, or emanations of the witches themselves.Particular care is needed here to distinguish between beliefs that theaccused witches themselves held, and stories told about them by theirneighbours. Of course they could be both, but we cannot assume thisany more than we can assume that someone thought they were awitch just because their neighbours called them one. ‘Witch’ wasalmost always what others called you, not what you called yourself.50The most obvious versions of the witch were the animal transforma-tions. These are vouched for both in neighbours’ depositions and inconfessions, and are common enough to confirm that the possibility ofsuch transformations was generally accepted in popular belief. Wehave already encountered the Alloa witches as ‘corbies and dragones’ –this was a confession. Neighbours, too, often saw a cat or some suchanimal at a significant moment and thought (at the time, or later) thatthis must be the witch. The elite regarded this as a demonic illusion,but of course they believed in demonic illusions. Werewolves were relevant here; there appear to be no folkloric werewolves in Scottishpopular material, but the elite sometimes mentioned them becausethey were respectably classical.Scotland seems to have lacked the witch’s double found in someother places – notably the Hungarian morawitch who was believed toappear to victims in dreams.51Scottish witches could appear in neigh-bours’ dreams without sending emanations that needed to beidentified as distinct entities. Closer to Scotland we have the Englishwitch’s familiar, often a cat or toad. The familiar was not straightfor-wardly a double or emanation of the witch, but it was an entity forwhich the witch could be held responsible. There are occasionalScottish cases in which something like a familiar was mentioned, andmore study of them would be useful;52however, the general picture isthat familiars were not normal in Scotland.Julian Goodare359780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern ScotlandEmma Wilby has argued that the English familiar was similar to theScottish fairy in popular belief. Both encountered the witch andoffered help; both made some kind of contract with the witch; bothneeded to be fed (the usual food of the familiar, blood, was sometimestaken by fairies too); both had ambivalent morality (familiars seemmore maleficent, but this could be an artefact of interrogation).53Thisis an insightful analysis of points of similarity, but the points of differ-ence are also marked. English familiars lived withtheir witches,whereas Scottish fairies lived elsewhere, in hills or other remote liminalspaces.54English familiars also acted on behalf of their human owners,being sent out almost as doubles of the witch or representatives oftheir malice. This was surely the crucial feature of the familiar – andthe fairy did not share it. Here the familiar seems closer to theHungarianlidérc, a small animal (typically a bird or reptile) thatfetched money for its owner or was sent out to harm neighbours.55This is still suggestive of broad transnational patterns of belief. Scottishfairies were certainly close to English familiars in the way they func-tioned in witchcraft interrogations – both for the suspects, who werebeing pressed for witchcraft material, and for the interrogators.56One point about the benandanti,táltosand others has always been seenas crucial: they entered a trance and their spirits went out to the otherworld. This worried interrogators, because theologically body and spiritwere inseparable during life. Most of the Scottish evidence shows peoplethemselves going out to the other world: as far as one can tell, body andspirit went together. This may still have originated in a trance experience,but this way of recording it fitted the orthodox theological view that theDevil could transport people bodily or give them the illusion of this. Butthere were also Scottish cases making the trance experience explicit.Isobel Elliott in 1678 confessed that ‘she left her bodie in Pencaitland,and went in the shape of a corbie, to Laswade, to see a child she hadnursed’.57Crows were distinctive as creatures for Scottish transformations;the Alloa ‘corbies’ have already been mentioned, and there were othercases including Isobel Goudie.58Elizabeth Bathgate’s defence lawyersargued in 1634 that she and others accused of sinking a ship had notbeen seen ‘fleing lyk crawis, ravens, or uther foulis, about the schip as useis with witches’.59John Fian, one of the North Berwick witches, confessedthat he was ‘strucken in great ecstasies and trances, lying by the space oftwo or three hours dead, his sprite taken, and suffered himself to becarried and transported to many mountains, as though through all theworld’.60Alison Pierson from Boarhills in 1588 had frightening dream ortrance experiences in which she visited fairyland; sometimes she did not9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"know where she would wake up in the morning.61Beatrix Leslie fromNewbattle in 1661 was often carried in her sleep to the company ofmany brave souls.62Sir George Mackenzie did not think that there was anything exoticor at least un-Scottish about animal metamorphosis or spirit-flight:We must then conclude, that these confessions of Witches, whoaffirm, that they have been transformed into beasts, is but an illusionof the fancy, wrought by the Devil upon their melancholy brains,whilst they sleep; and this we may the rather believe, because it hathebeen oft seen, that some of these confessors were seen to be lying stillin the room when they awak’d, and told where, and in what shapesthey had travell’d many miles: Nor is this illusion impossible to beeffectuated by the Devil, who can imitate nature, and corrupt thehumours, since melancholly doth ordinarily perswade men, that theyare Wolves (Licanthropi), Dogs, and other Beasts.63So the difference between dreams and trances may not always have beenclear, either to observers or to the subjects themselves. When MargaretWatson, in Carnwath in 1644, confessed that she and other members ofher group of witches had flown on a cat, a cock, a thorn tree, a bundle ofstraw, and an elder tree, she did not describe her physical or mentalstate.64James VI probably had trances in mind when he wrote:Philomathes. But how can it be then, that sundrie Witches have goneto death with that confession, that they have ben transported withthePhairieto such a hill, which opening, they went in, and theresaw a faire Queen, who being now lighter, gave them a stone thathad sundrie vertues, which at sundrie times hath bene produced injudgement?Epistemon.

Indeed she hasswept a lot of other material into her net, including almost anyreported encounter with the Devil, demons, angels or ghosts as well asfamiliars and fairies. More discrimination was required here, and in hereagerness for folkloric material she tends to read confessions literallyand to ignore the likelihood of leading questions and stereotyped ans-wers. Yet she should be commended for her refusal to shirk the difficultissue of what really lies behind reports of otherworldly encounters. Herconclusion that genuine trance experiences were involved is probablycorrect, at least in some cases.66IVA study of the European context of Scottish witchcraft might stop atthe boundaries of Europe, but it seems appropriate to discuss Euro-peans as humans. As well as shared cultural inheritances, early modernScots and Europeans had a shared biological inheritance. This goesdeeper than the folkloric material under discussion so far, because itwas not dependent on membership of a particular culture. There werepatterns of human behaviour that in principle any human might tendto follow if placed in particular situations. This is a potentially vastsubject, but a few suggestions may be made.The general assembly of the Scottish church declared in 1643 thatthe causes of witchcraft ‘are found to be these especially, extremity ofgrief, malice, passion, and desire of revenge, pinching povertie, solici-tation of other Witches and Charmers; for in such cases the devilassails them, offers aide, and much prevails’.67Most of these reasonswere dully predictable, especially ‘malice’ – which makes it all the morestriking that ‘extremity of grief’ headed the list. We should look moreclosely at the links between witchcraft and psychological trauma.These links seem obvious for Anna Tait, in Haddington, whose casehas been studied by Louise Yeoman. Tait had an awful domestic back-38Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ground, was ‘thrie several times deprehendit putting violent hands inherself at her awne hous’, and was convinced that her wickedness wasdue to the Devil, before she was accused of witchcraft in 1634.68JanetMorrison in Rothesay in 1662 heard a voice telling her to drownherself.69When contemporaries wrote of witches’ ‘melancholy’, theywere using a technical concept of classical medicine to explain theiropenness to strange visions and other experiences. But ‘melancholy’could include depression, and several witches do seem to have sufferedfrom this. Being accused of witchcraft might itself have made peopledowncast, to put it mildly, and some vulnerable people seem to havebeen pushed over the edge by it. Barbara Erskine in Alloa in 1659‘declared that when shoe was delatted [i.e. accused] for a witch theDevill came to hir and would have hir to drowne hir self’ in the Waterof Devon. She threw herself in, but was pulled out by William Miller.70Another aspect of witchcraft and trauma has also been illuminatedby Dr Yeoman: the link between demonic possession and the Calvinistconversion experience. Those seeking God’s grace could suffer fromdemonic ‘terrors’, and might even believe themselves to be possessedby the Devil. This could be blamed on witches in the same way asmore conventional misfortune.71Here we see the accusers, rather thanthe accused, as suffering from psychological disturbance. Other aspectsof this have been examined for England, New England and Germany.72If the conversion experience has been little discussed outside Scotland,this is probably because the subject has been under-researched ratherthan because of any necessary Scottish distinctiveness.73VThe elite participated in much popular belief, but also had distinctivebeliefs of their own. We may begin, as Christina Larner would havedone, with the demonic pact. To the higher authorities this was the crucial defining feature of a witch, and the further up one goes, theclearer this is. At the lowest level of authority, some kirk sessions wereunconcerned by it.74Yet in many confessions the making of thedemonic pact was paramount, and accounts of it were carefullyshaped. There were telling similarities in 1662 between Isobel Goudie’sfirst confession and Janet Braidheid’s, made the next day. One was atAuldearn, the other at Inshoch, 11/2miles away, but they shared thesame notary and many witnesses. Did Goudie and Braidheid bothindependently say that the Devil’s nature (i.e. penis) was as cold asspring-well water? Or that ‘the Devil marked me on the shoulder,Julian Goodare399780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"sucked out my blood, spouted it in his hand and sprinkled it on myhead’? And so on.75Or take the belief that the Devil renamed witcheswhen they entered his service. Janet Barker in 1643 ‘confessit that theDevill gave hir no new name quhan schoe aggreit to be his servand’ –obviously a response to a leading question.76The witches’ sabbath was important to the elite. Many confessionsincluded references to meetings of witches, sometimes used to generatenames of further suspects. The sabbath in popularimagination has beeneffectively reconstructed by Larner.77The most common reported eventswere dancing and feasting; the Devil’s presence was often noted but hisworship was rarely mentioned. Not all of this was of interest to the elite;interrogators might record it, but only on some aspects would they regu-larly press for details. The ‘&c’s in the record of Isobel Goudie’s confessionsare a notorious example. Confessions were thus a compromise betweenthe suspects’ own beliefs and what the interrogators wanted to hear.One feature of the sabbath which the Scottish elite seized on was thedigging up of corpses and using bits of them (and of winding-sheets)for magical purposes. This seems first to arise in the confession ofAgnes Sampson, one of the North Berwick witches.78King James men-tioned it in Daemonologie.79The debate about whether James intro-duced the demonic pact to Scotland has rather neglected the questionof whether he introduced the sabbath, or at least this aspect of it.80Theking’s advocate Sir Thomas Hamilton in 1611 thought that guiltywitches might typically be ‘tane in the actuall fact of witchecraft orincantation, or in any kirkyaird raising deid bodies and cutting af thairjoyntis, or dansing in any desert kirk at midnight’.81Meanwhile Scottish witches continued to confess to exhumingcorpses for magical purposes.82These were not primarily for use in sabbaths, but the practice seems to have been related. There was auniquely horrifying sabbath in Forfar in 1661 – the only recorded oneat which babies were eaten; and they were dug up from graveyardsrather than killed.83The witches’ alleged purpose in cannibalism was toprevent them confessing – something which would concern the inter-rogators and which they may even have prompted. Spells to preventconfession had been mentioned in Newes from Scotland, the NorthBerwick witchcraft pamphlet, and there was comparable material intheMalleus Maleficarumitself.84The idea of nefarious use of body partswas known throughout Europe. However, in Catholic countries it waslimited by a belief that exhumation was possible only for unbaptisedbabies: the power of baptism otherwise protected them.85The exhuma-tion of corpses, though not unknown, was not one of the regular ingre-40Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Julian Goodare41dients of the Continental sabbath. There, the more extreme sabbathsincluded naked dancing, sexual orgies, and cannibalistic infanticide,none of which occurred in Scotland; but not this.86Exhumation ofcorpses was the one new offence added to English witchcraft law in 1604, possibly influenced by James’s book.87But its prominence inScotland seems distinctive. In the idea of exhumation of corpses as a central component of the witchcraft stereotype we seem to have a distinct Scottish tradition – clearly accepted by the elite, and possiblytransmitted and encouraged by them.James wrote Daemonologieagainst witches, but in arguing for thereality of witchcraft he began with the ritual magic of the elite. Elitemagical traditions contributed to the development of some witchcraftideas – notably the demonic pact and the idea of summoning updemons. Scotland’s participation in this tradition goes back to the thir-teenth century at least. A friar in c.1263 wrote that there had been anecromancer at the court of King William the Lion (1165–1214), andthis was also the period of Michael Scot, celebrated astrologer to theEmperor Frederick II.88Courtly magicians were particularly prominentin the late middle ages, with competition for power at royal courts.89Scotland was involved in the fifteenth-century growth of RenaissanceNeoplatonism – the scholarly attempt to use magic to develop a com-prehensive cosmological understanding – as we saw with RobertHenryson’s Orpheus poem. Whether there was a critique of Neoplaton-ism in Scotland is unclear but quite possible. Witchcraft beliefs weresometimes endorsed by orthodox Aristotelians concerned that Neo-platonic ideas of magic were demonic.90Necromancy, another elite magical tradition, was prominent in sixteenth-century Scotland. The spectacular trial and execution in 1569of the Lord Lyon, Sir William Stewart of Luthrie, was a leading case.91Elements of this magical tradition, and perhaps even Neoplatonism,may have been carried into the seventeenth century by freemasonry,which originated in Scotland in the 1590s.92William Schaw, architect(in every sense) of freemasonry, was closely connected with RichardGraham, the leading magician involved in the North Berwick witch-craft panic. Graham, who ‘had ane familier spirit’, was surely a necro-mancer, though he is the last for whom we have such explicit evidenceat present.93Graham was associated with the fifth earl of Bothwell, andthere has been thought-provoking discussion of the connection ofBothwell and others with Italian magicians.94There was also popular respect for elite magicians, or people believedto have been such. David Riccio, the assassinated Italian confidant of9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Queen Mary, acquired a posthumous magical reputation. The charmerRobert Murray in Glenesk, interrogated for witchcraft in 1588, con-fessed that he had ‘falselie assurit that he wes Senyeor David’s man’.95As for Michael Scot, Scottish legends concerning his prodigious magicalfeats date from the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century.96Learnedmagic, or the idea of it, was important in Scotland.VIThis chapter began with a series of general statements about Europeanwitchcraft. In popular belief there were maleficent, vengeful witchesharming their neighbours through secret spells. There was also probablymore than one stereotype of the witch; in the main such stereotype, thewitch was an older woman, but there appear to have been other stereo-types including the ‘warlock’ (a common term for a male witch) andeven the necromancer.97Among the elite there were the demonic pactand the witches’ sabbath. Scotland, having all of this, was arguably moretypical than many European countries. There were many countrieswhere the elites did not swallow so much demonological theory –famously England, but also Italy, Spain, Portugal, and much of EasternEurope and Scandinavia. Popular belief in neighbourhood witchcraft wasmore widespread but may not have been strong everywhere – in Estonia,there were very few witchcraft prosecutions and a majority of witcheswere men.98Seen within the picture of European diversity, Scotland stillemerges as ‘fairly typical’ of Europe as a whole, but its closest affinitiesare with those Protestant states that prosecuted witches seriously.Some of Scotland’s most distinctive features related to the role of thestate and the practice of witch-hunting. Witchcraft belief must evid-ently precede witch-hunting, but some witch-hunting practices fedback into the range of beliefs that Scottish people held about witches.Scotland was notable for witch-pricking and sleep deprivation as waysto detect witches and extort confessions; witch-pricking encouragedpeople to take the witch’s mark seriously and to emphasise physicalaspects of the demonic pact, while sleep deprivation foregroundedwitches’ confessions and provided vivid details of witchcraft belief.Scotland’s centralised system of authorising trials seems to haveworked in favour of witch-hunting for longer. Centralised states tendedto restrain prosecutions, but Scotland experienced repeated witchcraftpanics from 1590 until 1662, illustrating how difficult it was for witch-obsessed authorities to adopt procedural caution. The sustained way inwhich Scottish witch-hunting underpinned a programme of godly dis-42Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"cipline was unusual – though it could be seen simply as a successfulversion of something to which other states also aspired.99Turning to popular belief, all regions had some distinctive beliefs orpractices. Genevan witches paid the Devil an annual tax. SomeSwedish witches rode sheriffs to the sabbath, propping their sheriffagainst the wall head-down until it was time to go home.100Englishwitches had their distinctive familiars. In Scotland we have fairy beliefshelping to construct the picture of the Devil. There is also the surpris-ing fact that Scottish peasants do not seem to have feared that theircommunity’s crops would be attacked by witchcraft. Other than that,neighbourhood witchcraft in Scotland was very much mainstream.What of the deeper folkloric beliefs? Peter Burke, one of those fasci-nated by the Ginzburg material, has proposed a three-tier model ofwitchcraft beliefs. At the top was the ‘demonological’ witchcraft of theelite; below, there was ‘neighbourly witchcraft’, and below that, ‘archaic,shamanistic witchcraft’.101The term ‘shamanistic’ may be over-used,but this multi-level model does seem persuasive. Following RobinBriggs one might add a fourth level below Burke’s three: biologically-determined witchcraft, inherited from our palaeolithic ancestors. Briggssuggests that human beings have an inbuilt psychological mechanismwhich might ‘predispose us to regard other people as malevolent secretenemies’; early humans might have needed to evolve a way of detect-ing witches in order to cope with misfortune.102This is suggestive, butRonald Hutton’s recent criticisms should be taken into account. Heargues that belief in maleficent witchcraft is common but not universalamong traditional societies, and that broad cultural regions can be tracedin which explanations for misfortune vary. Although many culturesidentify witches, others ascribe misfortune to non-human entities,principally angry or evil spirits.103What this survey points to, in fact, is a compromise between Briggsand Hutton. The neighbourhood witch as author of misfortune can beprosecuted: the evil spirit as author of misfortune cannot. But some ofthe non-human entities in early modern folk cosmology couldbeinvolved in witchcraft belief and prosecution. Fairies appeared in manyScottish confessions, but they were less common in neighbours’ accu-sations. If Scottish folklore had been wholly dominated by fairies, thenuncanny misfortune would have been ascribed only to them and nobodywould ever have pointed the finger at a witch. Even if the elite hadbelieved in the demonic pact and the witches’ sabbath, they could nothave hunted witches; the peasants would have closed ranks againsttheir enquiries. Witch-hunts based on pact and sabbath could spreadJulian Goodare439780230_507883_03_cha01.pdf 19/10/07 9:49 AM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"through a chain reaction, but the initial link in the chain was always awitch denounced by neighbours, and that would have been unobtain-able. Alas, what actually happened was that folklore contained a lethalcombination of fairies and witches. People blamed some misfortune onfairies, but did also sometimes point the finger at witchcraft suspects.Interrogated, those suspects often turned out to possess fairy beliefs –which the elite construed as demonic. Fairies facilitated witch-hunting.This raises a final question. Was it different before witch-huntingstarted? Could earlier fairies have tipped the scales in the other direc-tion? They could have made the medieval elite sceptical about witch-craft accusations. Perceiving that peasants believed superstitious fairynonsense, they could have dismissed witchcraft beliefs as similar delu-sions. This is relevant in a European context because of the CanonEpiscopi, the medieval law against a belief that women travelled or flewout at night with Diana or Herodias. It treated this, not as witchcraft,but as a delusion.104It was a demonic delusion, to be sure, but thepractical effect of the Canon Episcopiwas to deflect medieval elitesaway from identifying or prosecuting real, human witches. Did medievalfairies do something similar in Scotland? The thirteenth-century‘Miracles of St Margaret’ recorded at least two instances of misfortuneinflicted by fairy-like beings, who could have been alternatives towitches.105Perhaps one day we will have answers to this and otherquestions concerning the longue duréeof folk belief. Beliefs aboutwitchcraft were extraordinarily durable yet constantly varying, andquestions seem to come as fast as answers.Notes1J. G.

The datacan be viewed and studied either through online web interfaces (withsearching, graphing and mapping capabilities) or by downloading the full database.3This chapter describes the database, provides a summary of the project’s main findings and aims to correct many commonly heldmisconceptions about Scottish witchcraft that are not supported by theevidence collected for the database.IThe Survey was fortunate that two previous projects, by George F. Blackand by Christina Larner, Christopher Hyde Lee and Hugh V. McLachlan,had identified a large number of documentary sources containingwitchcraft material.4Black assembled a wide range of information fromprinted primary sources. Larner, Lee and McLachlan surveyed legalsources that were produced centrally and held in the National Archivesof Scotland, including the books of adjournal, circuit court books andprinted privy council and parliamentary records. They also looked at aselection of justiciary court process papers, unsorted legal paperworkand finally a range of other sources, which mainly included printedlocal records, local histories or personal accounts. They did not usemanuscript church records.9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"While the Survey increased the amount of searchable details fromLarneret al.’s ten fields to over 600 fields, the inclusion of differenttypes of sources had to be considered carefully. All the primary legalmaterial, including more of the unsorted process papers, as well as allthe central material, was resurveyed. It was felt, however, that it wouldbe less useful to resurvey all the printed primary and secondarysources, as these are relatively easy for other researchers to locate. Onlya selection of this material was examined, notably the records of theprivy council, acts of parliament, Pitcairn’s Trials, and several club andsociety publications including those by the Spalding Club and StairSociety.5Most importantly, since Larner’s team had not surveyedchurch material in any systematic way, a full survey of all extant pres-bytery records, and a sample of kirk session material, was conducted.6The Survey’s definition of an accused witch was ‘a person denouncedfor witchcraft, for whom we have evidence indicating that action(ecclesiastical, civil or both) was pursued’.7The research team carried out as extensive a survey as possible withinthe time available and this is reflected in the wealth of informationrecorded on the database. That said, many documents did not surviveand those that have survived do not necessarily tell us all that wewould like to know. Most of the missing documentation relates to localaspects of witchcraft accusation and prosecution; thus surviving docu-ments are heavily skewed towards centrally produced and kept records.The information contained in the surviving documentation rangesfrom simply a record of the name of a suspect and date of an accusa-tion to an extremely rich and detailed dossier from many differenttypes of sources with extensive locally and centrally produced docu-ments. Central sources (particularly the privy council minutes) showthat trials were authorised, but local trial documents themselves, orother indications that a local trial actually took place, seldom survive.The lack of consistent documentation for witchcraft accusation andprosecution creates difficulties in using the database (and the underly-ing source materials) to draw conclusions about early modern witch-craft. In order to ameliorate some of these problems we built threesearching tools into the database that allow users to create subsets ofcases.8First, we gave each witchcraft case a primary and secondarycharacterisation.9Cases with little detail were given the primary char-acterisation of ‘Not Enough Information’. By excluding these, a subsetof well-documented cases can be created and analysed. Of course,researchers using the database will need to determine whether thiswell-documented subset is indicative of the total population of cases.52Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"We believe that in many ways it is not. The well-documented casestend to be those tried in the court of justiciary in Edinburgh or thecircuit courts, whereas most witchcraft suspects were tried in the local-ity with a commission of justiciary from the central government. Thatis one reason why we created a second tool for database users to createadditional subsets of suspects based on trial process venue: central orlocal trial. Finally, suspects can be grouped by a specific source, includ-ing church and government sources.The result provides a wealth of detail about both the accused andtheir families, their neighbours and communities, their work and livesand the cultural beliefs and practices that provided not only the mate-rial for accusations but also underpinned the contemporary mentalitéor worldview. The belief system of early modern society encompassedtheories about religion and the supernatural, which included such figuresas the Devil, fairies and other spirits but also angels and ghosts.10Many ofthese figures, not just the Devil, were identified as being malevolent.11Witchcraft was used to explain misfortune, and it allowed people ameans to overcome it.IIUnderstanding the data recorded in the Survey requires some structuralexplanation of the database. The Survey database was developed torecord both quantitative and qualitative information, and was primar-ily structured around the accused witchcraft suspect, including per-sonal and family biographical material. The next level of informationrecorded for each accused person, the case material, included detailsabout people involved in the investigation process, the trial processand trial, beings and meetings, folk culture, disease and damage andany other charges. The people involved in investigation and prosecu-tion included lawyers, ministers, judges, clerks, bailies and other townofficials, kirk elders, local lairds or landowners, neighbours and witchprickers. The trial process was divided into pre-trial actions, includinginvestigative actions or commissions; the trial itself, either local orcentral; and post-trial events or outcomes. Alternatively, an individualmight have been mentioned by another person but did not appear inany investigation or trial themselves. In this case it was recorded thatthe accused had been mentioned as a witch in someone else’s trial; forsome individuals this might be the only reference to them that exists.The case material included a section entitled ‘Beings and Meetings’.This allowed the Survey to record cultural information about theLauren Martin and Joyce Miller539780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"appearance of non-natural or demonic beings: if they were identifiablymale or female, for instance, or if they took the form of an animal orinsect. Features of demonic pacts were also recorded: if the accused hadmade a pact with the Devil, renounced their baptism, been given anew name or received the Devil’s mark. Information about location ofmeetings or sabbaths, who attended, what was done, partaking of foodand drink, or collective malefice was also recorded.The section on folk culture allowed the project to record informationabout fairyland, the use of sympathetic magic, physical and verbalrituals, white magic, calendar customs, religious motifs and shapechanging. A reference to the good neighbours, or a woman in a greenkirtle, was recorded as a fairy motif. Any mention of second sight orprophecy, finding lost goods or love magic was included as whitemagic. The use of ritual objects such as thread, water, stones or herbswas noted, as were saints’ days or other calendar festivals such asBeltane (1 May), Halloween or Pasche (Easter). Religious motifs such as the Trinity or Christian prayers, crosses or holy wells were alsorecorded.As disease and damage were usually perceived as the intended out-comes of demonic witchcraft it was logical to include a section wherethis could be recorded. This meant that the Survey was able to noteoutcomes such as human illness or death, animal illness or death,infertility, impotence, transferring or laying on and taking off ofdisease, any harm, and poisoning. Damage or harm to property such asloss of milk or dairy products, failure of crops, failure of brewing or lossof ships was noted. The project also recorded how many of the accusedmight have been involved in curing or healing disease. Any mention ofhealing humans and animals was noted, as were references to mid-wifery. In this section it was also noted if the accused had given anyreason for their malice, including revenge, debt, failed business interac-tion, social slight or refusal of alms. Any information about chargesother than witchcraft that were laid against the accused was recorded.The Survey also collected detailed information about the legal processesthrough which suspected witches were accused and tried. A breakdownof trial types will be presented here, as the full scope of legal informa-tion contained in the database is beyond the scope of this chapter.12This is followed by a discussion of Survey findings on the numbers ofaccused witches and the timing, scope and distribution of accusations.The Survey identified four trial process types: central, local, circuitcourt (also referred to as mixed central/local), and suspects mentionedin the trial process of another accused witch. The Survey was able to54Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 54"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"assign multiple trial processes to those individual witchcraft suspectswho were processed, or tried, more than once. The most common trialprocess type was local. The Survey found 1,936 local trial processes. Inthe majority of these cases the only surviving evidence that a trialmight have taken place was when local authorities applied for andreceived a commission of justiciary to try witchcraft suspects in thelocal area. New documents surveyed by the Survey found that the nextmost common trial process type was the circuit court, where 293 witch-craft suspects appeared. In general, the best-documented cases are the178 central trial processes; most of the minutes of these trials have sur-vived. The Survey also included the 803 witchcraft suspects mentionedin the trial of another accused witch. Some of these suspects also hadtheir own trial processes. All accusations and trials had both local andcentral aspects; suspects were identified and evidence was collected inthe localities and trials normally required central permission.IIIOne of the most frequently asked questions about witchcraft practiceand prosecution is: how many people were accused or executed? Becausethe recorded evidence is patchy and incomplete, we can provide only aqualified answer. There have been various attempts to quantify thenumber of people accused and executed in Scotland. Larner and herteam identified what they classed as ‘cases’: any mention of a trial forwitchcraft.13This meant that some cases involved individual peoplebut others referred to multiples. Larner recorded 3,069 ‘cases’ but,although many people were listed in more than one source, they werenot collated, which meant that there were several hundred duplicates.InEnemies of God, Larner wrote that they had identified 2,208 namedand anonymous people, a figure that was somewhat lower than otherestimates.14Older accounts had given various figures: 4,500 up to30,000. Sometimes these numbers are still repeated and quoted (oftenas figures for executions), but they are outdated. Some of these olderestimates were based on figures for one year or one area that were thenextrapolated and applied throughout the country and total timeperiod. Few local areas experienced the same pattern of accusation andprosecution in the 173 years between the passing of the Witchcraft Actin 1563 and its repealing in 1736, so this method of estimating isflawed.The numerical totals that we recorded on the database should beaccurate as far as they go, but they are unlikely to be complete.15TheLauren Martin and Joyce Miller559780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Survey identified 3,837 people who were accused of witchcraft inScotland. 3,212 of those were named people. The figure of 625 unnamedpeople is a minimum estimate, as many references to suspects oftenjust noted several people or some women. It was impossible to measure,with any degree of certainty, how many people ‘several’ (or ‘many’)meant. If two people were tried this was usually stated quite clearly, so‘several’ was taken to mean more than this but it was decided to err onthe side of caution and take it as indicating just three. It is very poss-ible that on some occasions the number of unnamed accused was a lothigher than this.Not all witchcraft suspects were executed (a point that is oftenobscured in popular accounts), and the Scottish sources make execu-tion rates particularly hard to determine. Larner suggested a figure of1,337 executions, with an error of 300 either way, out of the 2,208accused that she identified. She felt, however, that this was an overesti-mation.16Larner based her figures on commissions that were issued fortrying and burning and took these to indicate definite executions. Ourfigures for known executions are even lower than this as we did notassume that an execution took place unless we found an actual deathsentence. We recorded a sentence of any kind in only 307 cases. Fromthis we know that 206 people were to be executed, 52 acquitted orreleased, 27 banished, 11 declared fugitive, 6 excommunicated and 2put to the horn (outlawed). One person was to be kept in prison buttheir eventual outcome is unknown. One person was to be brandedand another to be publicly humiliated, although this may refer to thesame thing. In cases with a known outcome, 67 per cent, or two thirds,were executed.If this percentage is extrapolated to the total number of knownaccused witchcraft suspects then it would seem that between 2,152 and2,570 people might have been executed in Scotland. However, this is not a reliable figure. The figure of 67 per cent is based on only 307known outcomes, which is less than 10 per cent of the 3,212 namedpeople and less than 8 per cent if we include the unnamed people aswell. There are at least two ways that these 307 sentences may not betypical. First, the majority of cases with known outcomes wererecorded by the central justiciary court rather than by locally convenedcourts. The justiciary court acquitted a higher percentage of accusedthan the local courts; Larner and her team estimated its acquittal rateto be at least 50 per cent higher.17Since more trials were held locallythis might mean that the total number of those executed might well behigher. On the other hand, the accused that the Survey recorded56Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"includes those who were being investigated by church authorities.Some of them may have gone on to have a trial and subsequent exe-cution. On the other hand, others may have had charges against themdropped, so the number of executions may be lower. Much moredetailed statistical analysis of the Survey data will be necessary in orderto help settle some of these thorny questions; even then, some uncer-tainties will probably remain.IVThe timing and geographical distribution of witchcraft accusations isanother much-discussed aspect of witchcraft prosecution. Here theSurvey can be very illuminating because detailed information aboutthe residence of accused witches and all known dates of proceduresand actions associated with the prosecution of each suspect were gath-ered. This information is analysed elsewhere in this volume, but ageneral overview of the Survey’s findings will be provided here.18Witchcraft was a statutory crime in Scotland from 1563 to 1736. Themajority of suspects were accused between 1589 and 1663, with a fewnotable exceptions before and after: 1568, 1577, 1678–9, 1697–1700.Some years saw a much larger number of suspects than others, particu-larly 1591, 1597, 1628–30, 1643–4, 1649–50, 1658–9 and 1661–2. Usingdata from the Survey, Figure 2.1, ‘Accused Witches in Scotland, 1561–1736’, shows the last known date associated with an accused witch.19Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller57))450400350300250200150100500Number of accused witches1561 1571 1581 1591 1601 1611 1621 1631 1641 1651 1661 1671 1681 1691 1701 1711 1721 17311591 (69)1597 (111)1628 (72)1629 (175)1630 (102)1649 (367)1650 (188)1643 (101)1644 (67)1658 (74)1659 (85)1661 (210)1662 (402)1679 (56)Figure 2.1Accused Witches in Scotland, 1561–17369780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Most cases did not unfold in only one year. Many took ten to 40 years between first accusation and final action. Figure 2.2, ‘AccusedWitches, Ten-year Trends, 1561–1736’, shows what witchcraft accusa-tion and prosecution activity might look like over time when theoverall case length is more adequately represented. In Figure 2.1, theyearly accusations look sharp and decisive. But for many suspects andtheir communities witchcraft accusations and prosecution emergedslowly over time. The overall timing of witchcraft does not look differ-ent with the ten-year moving average; rather witchcraft prosecutionactivity looks more gradual over the period of most intensive witch-craft prosecution in Scotland.Suspects were accused from every region and almost every county inScotland, but available evidence suggests that witchcraft suspects livedin only approximately one-third of Scottish parishes.20Each countyhad its own timing of accusations per year that differed from theoverall number of accusations per year. Over one-third of knownwitchcraft accusations were in the counties of the Lothians –Edinburgh, Haddington and Linlithgow. Because the Lothians con-tributed such a large proportion of suspects, it is not surprising that thetiming of accusations per year from the counties of the Lothians regionmore closely matched the overall timing of accusations per year displayed in Figure 2.1 than any other county in Scotland.2158Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland450400350300250200150100500Number of accused witches1561 1571 1581 1591 1601 1611 1621 1631 1641 1651 1661 1671 1681 1691 1701 1711 1721 1731Total10 per.

Whowere they and what were they like? The dominant image of a witch inthe early modern period was similar to the modern stereotype: an old,poor, widowed woman. But was this image reflected in the actual rangeof witchcraft suspects? The idea that they were female is generally sup-ported by Survey data. Women make up 85 per cent of all peopleaccused of witchcraft in Scotland. This is the Survey’s most reliablefigure because gender was determined for all but 49 people (1.5%).However, the other enduring aspects of witch-stereotypes held thenand now, such as age, socio-economic status and marital status, are notso well supported by data collected by the Survey. Since this data is notnearly as conclusive as the information on gender, it requires discus-sion and analysis.Table 2.1 shows the ages of accused witches for whom an age wasknown or could reasonably be estimated. Age was estimated for the‘case date’, the date of the last known legal proceeding.Thus 40 per cent of witchcraft suspects were aged 40 or under, 54 percent were between the ages of 41 and 60, and only 7 per cent were 61or above (bearing in mind that the Survey recorded the age of a suspectin only 5 per cent of cases). The most common age of an accused witchwas 50.22The average age of witchcraft suspects, however, was only 43.Table 2.1 shows that 81 per cent of witchcraft suspects were under theage of 51. The data suggests that the majority of witchcraft suspectswere between their late thirties and very early fifties. This finding canreasonably be extrapolated to suspects where age is not known, partic-ularly the missing documentation in local trial processes.23Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller59Table 2.1Age of Witchcraft Suspects (When Known)AgeNum.%20 or under117%21 to 301911%31 to 403622%41 to 506841%51 to 602113%61 to 7064%71 or over53%Total1669780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Should someone in their forties or fifties be considered old in theearly modern period? One way to think about age is in reference toaverage life expectancy. The average life expectancy at birth in earlymodern Scotland was around 31 years, suggesting that an age of 43 or50 was pretty old by early modern standards.24Life expectancy data,however, includes a very high infant mortality rate and is not necessar-ily indicative of adult survival rates. If a person survived to the age of30 they could be expected to survive at least to 56, suggesting that 40or 50 was not unusually old. It is likely, however, that althoughchronologically the women were not as old as previously thought,physically the ageing process started sooner than it does today in termsof menopause. Fertility ceased around age 40, with visible changesassociated with the menopause occurring by or around the age of 50.25The Survey data, therefore, suggests that witchcraft suspects were gen-erally middle-aged or slightly older, but not unusually old.The age of an accused witch at one moment in her trial process maybe too static a category anyway. Our findings suggest that a witchcraftaccusation often took decades to emerge, solidify in the minds ofaccusers and reach a trial. Therefore, the age of a witchcraft suspect attrial is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the age span duringwhich a woman could be suspected of witchcraft: they could be a lotyounger when their reputation first developed. More analysis mighttell us if older women were more prone to being brought to trial,perhaps because their witchcraft reputations were more solidified orbecause they were more vulnerable socially and culturally.The Survey data suggests that, contrary to stereotypes about witch-craft suspects and evidence from elsewhere in Europe,26most weremarried at the time of accusation and trial. This makes sense given theroughly middle-aged profile of most witchcraft suspects. Marital statusis known only for 23 per cent of accused witches; a large majority ofthese were married (78%), some were widowed (20%) and very fewwere single (2%).Can the proportion of married to widowed suspects reasonably beextrapolated to estimate the marital status of witchcraft suspectswithout documentation, particularly those who had local trials? Theproportion of married to widowed suspects was similar across the trialprocess venues.27This could, however, be a reflection of a systematicbias where married women were likely to be identified with their hus-bands, whereas single or widowed women would be recorded withoutmention of their marital status.28It is therefore possible that the major-ity of suspects with an unknown marital status were single or widowed.60Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"For most suspects, particularly those tried locally, unreported maritalstatus is undoubtedly due to poor documentation. The fact that somecases recorded that a suspect was unmarried or widowed mitigates tosome extent the notion that suspects with an unknown marital statuswere more likely to be widows or single.29But because of the possibilityof a systematic bias in reporting, conclusions about marital status mustremain uncertain.Another stereotype is that witchcraft suspects were in general pooreror more economically marginal than their neighbours. How true isthis? Witchcraft suspects were generally drawn neither from elite ranksof society nor from the very poor. Rather, they tended to be wives (orsometimes widows) of farmers, craftsmen or other middling people.30Table 2.2 shows a breakdown of socio-economic status.The Survey was able to ascertain socio-economic status for only 11 per cent of all witchcraft suspects. Examining the socio-economicstatus of suspects within each trial process type suggests how the datamight be extrapolated to estimate overall socio-economic trends withinthe entire population of witchcraft suspects. Middling and lower statussuspects, that is those able to make a living within their communities,predominated in all trial process types, particularly local ones.31Thenumbers of elite and very poor suspects, however, differed across trialtypes. Central trial processes had a much higher proportion of elitewitchcraft suspects (18%) than other trial process types32and local trialprocesses had a higher proportion of very poor suspects (12%).33Anelite suspect would be more likely and able to demand a trial before thehighest court in the land; a very poor person would be forced to standtrial wherever local elites demanded. As the majority of missing docu-ments are from local trial processes it is likely that the overall socio-economic status of witchcraft suspects would more closely reflectLauren Martin and Joyce Miller61Table 2.2Socio-Economic Status of Witchcraft Suspects (When Known)Socio-economic StatusNumber%Lairds/Baron51%Nobility/Chiefs41%Upper164%Middling23164%Lower7220%Landless164%Very Poor185%Total3629780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"trends in local trials: 4 per cent elite, 84 per cent middling or lowerstatus, and 12 per cent very poor and marginal. The Survey’s data,therefore, do not support the widely-held idea that witchcraft suspectswere poor, widowed, marginal women. Rather, while not conclusive,they suggest that witchcraft suspects were generally middle-aged,married women who were enmeshed in the economic and social fibreof their communities.VILike many periods and events in history, witchcraft prosecution andbelief has thrown up many myths and folk legends. Some names suchas Kate MacNiven and Maggie Wall have local legends attached tothem. In the case of the former this was associated with a ring that wasbelieved to bring good fortune to the Graham family34and the nameof the latter, despite being erased repeatedly, appears on a stone nearDunning in Perthshire commemorating her execution for witchcraft in1657. According to the documentary sources that the Survey and previ-ous surveys checked, neither of these two women appears to have beenformally accused or tried for witchcraft. The fact that their stories werenot recorded in written documents does not necessarily mean thatthey did not exist; it could mean that they were not documented orthe documentation has been lost. Stories about witches and witchcraftfeature in many local oral, or folk, narratives and they may have theirorigins in fact.On the other hand, there are other myths that have built up over theyears that are inaccurate but nevertheless have been perpetuated for avariety of reasons. These include theories that all of the people accusedof witchcraft were really midwives and healers, that they met in groupsof thirteen, or that they flew on broomsticks. It has also been claimedthat they believed they were practising witchcraft because of drug-induced hallucinations. Another myth is that the swimming test wasused in order to prove the guilt or innocence of an accused person: ifthey sank they were innocent, but if they swam they were guilty.These myths have not generally been supported by documentaryevidence. The correlation between witchcraft and midwifery or healinghas been convincingly dismantled.35Only nine Scottish individuals inthe Survey had their occupation recorded as midwife, and accusationsinvolving midwifery were recorded in only three of these cases.Midwifery was part of the accusations made against a further sevenwomen not formally identified as midwives, but the figures suggest62Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"that midwives were not specifically targeted because of their midwiferyskills.36Midwives and midwifery, mentioned in just over 0.5 per centof cases in Scotland, did not, therefore, play a major role in witchcraftaccusations.Witches were described as healing humans and animals more oftenthan as being midwives. Healing was part of the accusations madeagainst 141 people or just over 4 per cent of the total accused but, asmentioned earlier, most cases present very little detail. When thesubset of 328 detailed cases is examined, healing was part of the accu-sations made against 80 suspects. In 40, healing was the primaryelement in accusations made against them, accounting for 12 per cent.This figure is not reliable because a lot of information may not havebeen recorded in the documentation and because it is based on a smallproportion of all the cases; nevertheless it does suggest that, althoughhealing and medicine were important, they were not necessarilyregarded as unequivocal features of witchcraft practice. This is perhapssurprising, because beliefs about causation and healing of illness andinjury were so closely related. Belief in magic underpinned society’sexplanations both about how they became ill and how they could becured, and those who had the power to heal were believed to have hadthe power to harm. It is therefore quite possible that many of the otherpeople accused of witchcraft did have healing skills but this aspect oftheir practice or knowledge was not regarded as significant at the timeof their accusation; it was their practice of malefice that was moreimportant. What is clear is that people were not accused of witchcraftsimply because of their knowledge of healing. Some of those who wereinvestigated for healing using magic were accused of the lesser offenceof charming – magical healing – and were not tried for witchcraft.37Another common myth is that witches met in groups or covens ofthirteen. This theory was perpetuated by the work of MargaretMurray.38The documentary evidence surveyed by the project did notconfirm this. Much of Murray’s thesis was based on the case of IsobelGoudie from Auldearn, who was accused in 1662. A great deal ofGoudie’s confession is unusual in its content. Some other confessionsand accounts do mention meeting in groups, but these ranged in sizefrom two or three to over 100, and in one case 2,300.39Some largegroups who were prosecuted were not always included or described inconfessions.40One feature of witches’ meetings, related to elite interpretations ofwitchcraft, is that witches worshipped the Devil and engaged in acts of communal sex and malefice. Demonic involvement was mentionedLauren Martin and Joyce Miller639780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"in a total of 528 records. Although there may have been a range of reasons for the accusations, key features such as renunciation ofbaptism, having the Devil’s mark and making a covenant with theDevil were mentioned in confessions. Demonic pact, however, wasdeemed the primary characterisation of only 49 cases. This accountsfor 15 per cent of the cases that the project was able to characteriseand, although it was the second most frequent reason, it did not dom-inate as much as might have been expected.Demonic possession was another aspect of demonic involvementand interestingly, it was recorded as the primary characterisation for 55cases, or 17 per cent, the highest number. All of these demonic posses-sion cases, however, are from two well-documented groups of cases inwestern Scotland at the end of the seventeenth century just as witch-craft prosecutions were on the wane. The total number of cases thatfeatured demonic pact, demonic possession or both is 567.41Thesestatistics indicate that the Devil and his relationship with the accusedwas important to witchcraft prosecution, but it does not necessarilymean that the accused worshipped the Devil. It simply demonstratesthat it was described in confessions. Many of these confessions weremade as a result of torture and mental pressure, and the content anddetail may well not have been literally true.As for flight, there is very little evidence that Scottish witches werebelieved to fly on broomsticks. Continental witch beliefs did includeflying – on sticks, broomsticks and the backs of animals, or simplyunder their own power.42Isobel Goudie described putting a piece ofstraw between her legs and riding it like a horse but hardly anyone elsementioned this practice.43Some of the accused mentioned metamor-phosis and the ability to appear in the form of an animal. Others men-tioned flying to meetings at night. Although Alison Pierson claimedthat she was transported in a whirlwind, the means of transport tomost meetings was not mentioned.44The evidence suggests thatalthough there was some reference to witches’ flight it was not a keyfeature of witchcraft belief in Scotland.In many modern accounts of witch trials, not least film versions, theswimming test is a key feature of proof of guilt. There are many locallegends relating to witches’ pools, particularly the witches’ lake at St Andrews. An account from 1597 described accused witches havingtheir thumbs and toes tied together and then being thrown into thewater.45The panic of 1597 is the only time when there is evidence ofthe swimming test being used in Scotland.46James VI mentioned theuse of water to detect witches in Daemonologie:64Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"fleeting on the water for, as in a secret murder, if the dead carcass beat any time thereafter handled by the murderer, it will gush out ofblood ... So it appears that God hath appointed, for a supernaturalsign of the monstrous impiety of the witches, that the water shallrefuse to receive them.47The ordeal of swimming those suspected of practising witchcraft seemsto have been used elsewhere in Europe by 1600. Nevertheless it wascriticised by academics and was prohibited by the parlementof Paris in 1601, so overall its use may have been limited.48Apart from the1597 account, and James VI’s opinion, there is no other evidence forits use in Scotland. In contrast, the ‘bierricht’ test whereby the accusedwas made to touch the corpse, mentioned by James VI, was used on a number of occasions in Scotland and elsewhere.49In this test, if the body of a presumed victim bled when an accused witch touched it, it was held that the victim had been murdered by thesuspect.Another image from recent popular culture is that witches partook ofdrugs and experienced drug-induced hallucinations, voluntary or other-wise. Drugs have been used to explain both the confessions of theaccused and also the symptoms experienced by demonic possession.The theory relates to the symptoms of ergot poisoning, or ergotism,which is caused by ingesting rye that has been contaminated with theergot fungus. The condition, which is also known as St Anthony’s fire,produces burning pains, itching skin and convulsions and can eventu-ally result in gangrene. Rye was a rare crop in Scotland but large quan-tities were imported during food shortages in the 1590s.50The use ofaffected rye may have contributed to the accusations and trials in1597, particularly as it has been shown that rye was imported toAberdeen in 1596. It has been argued, however, that there are noobvious cases of ergotism in the evidence from the Aberdeen trials.51Another problem with this thesis is that there were accusations ofwitchcraft from the 1590s to the 1690s, but there does not appear to be any evidence to suggest that ergot was a factor in any other year or years.VIIWas the experience of witchcraft and witchcraft trials in Scotlanduniquely Scottish or the same as the rest of Europe? The answer to thisquestion would, of course, be yes to both parts, but a qualified yes.52Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller659780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Scotland was very much part of European culture and experiencedmany of the same problems and issues. At the same time it was inde-pendent and, because it had its own legal and ecclesiastical systems,developed its own interpretation of witchcraft and its prosecution.This chapter is by no means an exhaustive discussion of all that theSurvey of Scottish Witchcraft can tell us about witchcraft belief. Thematerial compiled by the Survey provides such a range of informationabout witchcraft belief, practice and prosecution, and its wider context,that we were only able to address a select number here. There are manyaspects of witchcraft that are still under-researched and the databaseprovides an efficient starting point and means of identifying potentialtopics and sources for more detailed analysis.Folk culture and regional variation have been examined by Edward J. Cowan, Lizanne Henderson and Joyce Miller in this book, but furtherresearch has still to be done on other elements of folk culture andbelief.53Very little has been written, for example, about shape shifting,familiars or ghosts in Scotland. Henderson usefully examines witchbelief in the Gàidhealtachd, but there is still work to be done comparingthe folk beliefs and experience of witchcraft in rural and urban com-munities. The language of witchcraft – the curses, the insults, the accu-sations, the confessions – offers a range of potential research topicsabout witchcraft and culture. For example, references to landscape andplace names of Scotland may provide us with more evidence andunderstanding about witch belief and its relationship with folk legend.What places and locations featured in witchcraft discourse? Howsignificant were specific wells, rivers, hills or meadows? This informa-tion may provide us with new ideas about the relationship betweensociety and the land.This book is about witchcraft belief and practice, but the evidencefrom witchcraft trials and prosecutions has much wider application.

At the same time while there has been adegree of reluctance thus far to consider that some of the accused mayindeed have been guilty of attempting to cause harm, analysis of accu-sations of malefice, and in particular those cases that involved murderor attempted murder, may provide useful insights into attitudestowards conflict and revenge in early modern society. Witchcraft beliefis a perfect metaphor through which to study society’s beliefs and practices.66Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_04_cha02.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Notes1 The Survey was a two-year research project, funded by the Economic andSocial Research Council and housed in the Department of Scottish Historyat the University of Edinburgh.

For suspects with a known age tried incentral trial processes the mean age was 45, for local trial processes it was43, for circuit court trial processes it was 38 and for those mentioned inother people’s trials it was 46.

Martin, ‘Witchcraft and family: what can witchcraft documents tellus about early modern Scottish family life?’, Scottish Tradition, 27 (2002),7–22.31 The category of Middling was assigned to people who had secure access tosome land or were secure craftsmen. The category includes portioners, tenantfarmers, bailies or factors, burgesses, lesser craftsmen (such as bakers, skinners,weavers, cordiners and fleshers), and ministers. The category of Lower wasassigned to people who had some access to land and at least some kind ofemployment. They were often subtenants, semiskilled artisans, colliers, gar-deners, fishermen, workmen or sailors. In a broad sense, both categories repre-sent people who were able to make a living and generally participated in theircommunities. The combined categories break down by trial type as follows:central trial process, 75 per cent; local trial process, 84 per cent; mixed trialprocess, 82 per cent; mentioned in a trial, 89 per cent.32 The category Elite includes the nobility, chiefs, lairds, barons, high statuscraftsmen, and wealthy tenants. The breakdown of Elite witchcraft suspectsacross trial types is as follows: local trial process, 4 per cent; circuit courttrial process, 14 per cent; mentioned in a trial, 8 per cent.33 The category Very Poor includes people without any access to any land orsteady work, often described as vagrants or vagabonds and cottars, servantsin small households, grassmen, shepherds, and people who did other typesof odd jobs. These were people without strong ties to their communitieswho could be expected to be more mobile. The breakdown of Very Poorwitchcraft suspects across trial process types is as follows: central process, 4 per cent; local process, 12 per cent; circuit court process, 4 per cent; mentioned in a trial, 4 per cent.34 A. Hanham, ‘“The Scottish Hecate”: a wild witch chase’, Scottish Studies,13 (1969), 59–64 mentions that she gave the Grahams a blue bead ratherthan a ring. It is possible that the stone she spat out was then turned into aring, hence the local legend. MacNiven may also be a version of ‘Nicneven’, aname for several witches; interestingly the Gaelic MacNaoimhín (MacNiven)means son (or Nic – daughter) of the holy one.35 D.

CowanThe Witchcraft Act of 1563, in citing the ‘abominabill superstitioun’employed by certain of lieges of the realm through using witchcraft,sorcery and necromancy, and the ‘credence gevin thairto in tymesbygane aganis the Law of God’, effectively identified diablerie and folkbelief with the medieval Church.1The Reformers, however, operatedwithin a well-established ecclesiastical tradition, for the authorities’suspicion of folk belief and popular culture was of very long standing.The Kirk had been concerned about witches since at least the thir-teenth century. The formulaic sentence of excommunication from thatperiod, to be pronounced four times a year, included ‘witches and allwho countenance and protect and support them in their evil doings as well as those who are parties with them in their misdeeds’. The sixteenth-century version mentioned ‘al wichis and trowaris [i.e.believers] in thaim’. The Statutes of the Scottish Church prescribedexcommunication for all fortune tellers, witches male and female,incendiaries, violators of churches, and other such offenders. The four-teenth-century St Andrews statutes had a similarly wide remit includ-ing ‘all sorcerers and those believing in them’.2After 1560, since therewas widespread opinion, not to mention fear, that superstition sus-tained the Catholic faith, all such superstition had to be eradicated. Inresearching fairy belief extensive use was made of the evidence of thewitch trials.3The question which this chapter attempts to explore iswhether those same sources can be exploited to recover aspects of folkbelief in sixteenth-century Scotland. Indeed, might the witch-hunts beseen as a kind of encapsulating metaphor for the attack on folk culturein general?9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"IIn order to pursue these issues, the chapter will concentrate on thewitch-hunts of the 1590s. The pamphlet Newes from Scotland(1591)focuses upon the remarkable affair at North Berwick, one of the mostsensational events in a truly extraordinary and incident-filled reign.4The tract would have been all that there was to read on the subject inthe 1590s, though we know little about how people actually receivedtheir information at that time; word of mouth was presumably themain medium, transmitted through the market place or the pulpit. Thelatter must have been a means of circulating some knowledge, as min-isters doubtless offered up fulsome prayers of thanksgiving for thedeliverance of their king, though others perhaps took the opportunityfor congregational seminars on the subject of witchcraft.The familiar story tells how Geillis Duncan, having recently acquiredan ability for healing, confessed, under torture, to witchcraft. One ofher accomplices, Agnes Sampson, ‘the eldest witch of all’, described theassembly at North Berwick kirk on Halloween 1590. They sailed downthe Forth in riddles and sieves, refreshing themselves with flagons ofwine, ‘making merrie and drinking by the waye’. On landing, they allsang while dancing a reel, Duncan providing hellish music on her Jew’sTrump (jew’s harp) – a tune called Gillatrypes, which rapidly entered theScottish charts of the early 1590s. It resurfaced four years later in Elginwhen three women ‘confessit thame to be in ane dance callit gillatrypesinging a foull hieland sang’.5Could there be a connection between thename of the girl, Geillis, and that of the song, tune or dance?The Devil presented his buttocks for the kiss of obeisance from thecongregation. He inveighed against James VI, ‘the greatest enemy hehath in the world’ and, after swearing oaths, they all went home.James’s initial doubts were dispelled by Sampson, who, to prove shewas no liar, repeated the very words he had exchanged with his wife,Anne, on their honeymoon night. She was the principal witchappointed to arrange the king’s death using toad venom, foul linenand charmed cats. Her reward, like her fellow witches, was to be car-nally used by the Devil, ‘albeit to their little pleasure, in respect of hiscolde nature’.6John Fian or Cunningham, schoolmaster at Prestonpans, was report-edly the Devil’s registrar or secretary, who kept the attendance bookand minutes of the meetings. He confessed to bewitching a rival inlove. The lady of their affections had a brother who was one of Fian’spupils. The dominie resorted to spells to win the girl’s love, promising72Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"to teach the boy ‘without strypes’, if he would obtain for him three‘haires of his sister’s privities’. The boy’s suspicious mother interro-gated him by means of a sound thrashing; for children corporal pun-ishment was clearly an ever-present reality. Since the mother,conveniently enough, was herself a witch she knew what to do, secur-ing three hairs from the udder of a cow, which Fian, in turn, used forhis charm. The cow then manifested its lust by leaping upon him, andfollowing him everywhere to the wonder of all. Following savagetorture his fate was sealed. At the time Newesappeared, some of thewitches still awaited trial. The tract ended with a short homily on the greatness and goodness of God, and James VI.7If the foregoing represents the tabloid version, the court report wasfurnished by James himself though probably ghosted by another. Inthe form of a Socratic dialogue, Daemonologieexplains such topics asthe scriptural authority of witchcraft and how it differs from necro-mancy. It soon emerges that such matters are of interest to learned andunlearned alike, with pejorative language for the latter, as in referenceto ‘suche kinde of charms as commonlie dafte wives uses’.8This is onetheme that is pursued throughout; another is that rituals used toconjure the Devil can be compared to a priest saying mass.9Satanappears to the vulgar as a dog, cat or ape, or else the sound of his voicesignifies his presence; from him folk seek curses, to inflict on theirenemies, and other favours, usually personal or domestic. There issome detail on what devils, ‘God’s hangmen’, get up to, and some dis-cussion of the nature of magic. Many witches are melancholics butmost of them are ‘altogether given over to the pleasures of the flesh,continual haunting of companie, and all kindis of merriness, bothlawfull and unlawfull, which are thinges directly contrary to the symp-toms of melancholia’. They are loath to confess without torture. Theypractise the inversion of Christianity. They fly through the air andconfess to distant journeyings when others observe them fast asleep.The alleged shape-shifting of witches is compared to ‘the little transub-stantiate god in the Papists’ Mass’.10Women are especially susceptible to witchcraft due to their frailty.There is a lengthy section on spells and conjuring, used to generatelove or hate, or inflict illness; detail is included on the use that can bemade of wax ‘pictours’, images of intended victims which, whenmelted, cause sickness and death.11Those of infirm or weak faith aremost likely to be corrupted. There were more ghosts and spirits seen inthe time of papistry when the Devil walked more familiarly amongstour grossly-erring fathers, a point later reinforced.12Edward J.

The reason devilish abuse is most commonin the wild parts of the world such as Lapland, Finland, Orkney andShetland, is because ‘where the devil findes greatest ignorance and bar-baritie; there assayles he grossliest, as I gave you the reason whereforethere was more witches of woman kinde nor men’.13Fairy belief wasallegedly much more widespread under the medieval Church, as wasprophecy. In this section the author does not pull his monarchicalpunches. All of the Devil’s wiles are in evidence when he ‘counterfeitsGod among the Ethnicks’.14In conclusion, echoing the Malleus Maleficarum, the two discussantsagree that God will never allow the innocent to be accused of witch-craft. The other implicit notion is that ‘certain abominations are com-mitted by the lowest orders, from which the highest orders areprecluded on account of the nobility of their natures’.15These are twoof the most pernicious statements in the entire literature of the witch-hunt. Of course some members of the Scottish nobility were to beaccused during the witch craze but this was regarded as a truly aberra-tional circumstance. Just as Newesmoves into folklore with the charm-ing of the cow, so Demonologieends in the World of Fairy among theEthnics. In other words folklore and folk belief, which harbour somuch of what is now deemed superstition, have become the legitimatetargets of those intent upon the eradication of witchcraft. The Churchbefore the Reformation had been hostile to popular culture; the post-Reformation attack sought to destroy all surviving support for thatsame Church, while concurrently reinforcing authority. Folk culturepreserved the pernicious beliefs and practices of a previous age so sustaining Catholic belief. It is thus diagnostic that the diabolical convention at North Berwick commenced with music, song, merriness,the drinking of wine, and a reel.IIIt is surely significant that the Aberdeenshire trials of 1596–7 alsoallegedly began with a dance, or rather two dances, at Halloween, onein downtown Aberdeen and the other near Lumphanan. As has beenincautiously suggested the Aberdeen event has the look of a breach ofthe peace,16when a number of so-called sorcerers and witches allegedlycongregated at the Fish Cross, the Devil being present to organise themusic. Otherwise the detail is as fascinating as it is intriguing. ThomasLeyis was the foremost and led the ring of dance; he ‘dang [i.e. hit]74Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Katherine Mitchell because she spillit [i.e. spoiled] the dance, and rannocht sa fast as the rest’ (97–8).17When Isobel Cockie thought that the Devil ‘played not so melodiouslie’ as she wished, she snatched theinstrument out of his mouth, banged him on the cheeks with it, andplayed it herself to the assembled company (115). Some of the dancerssupposedly appeared as hares or cats, and ‘sum in other similarities’(117). There is also mention of guising. On the same night anothergroup of witches was accused of dancing at a grey stone at the foot ofthe Hill of Craiglich in company with their master, the Devil, ‘heplaying melodiousliue upone ane instrument, albeit invisible’, and,having ordered each present to kiss his arse, he had carnal dealingswith all in the likeness of a beast (102, 114, 149, 151, 152).These cases have recently been discussed.18The intention in whatfollows is to extract material on folk belief and popular culture fromthe records that survive and thus, hopefully, recover something of themental world of the victims – the accused – as well as of their tormen-tors. The concern is not with whether or not the events, as described,actually happened, for the evidence, such as it is, presents a phantomhistory, a tragic and fatal conspiracy of mutual deceit betweenaccusers, victims and opinion at large, but rather with gathering some-thing of the harvest nurtured by the deep roots of tradition.While the North Berwick case may be deemed to have had someinfluence on the type of lore in circulation about other outbreaks,specifically those in Aberdeenshire in 1596–7, it should also be notedthat cases from the latter county had distracted the authorities duringthe summer of 1590, well before Fian’s trial in December. On 17 August Jonett Clark of Blalach, also known as Spaldarg, and JonettGrant of Colquhatstane, alias Gradoch, were condemned for variouscrimes which included theft and the murder and slaughter of peopleand animals. Their accomplice, the wet-nurse Bessie Roy, was acquit-ted.19It is of considerable interest that several people later accused inAberdeen in 1596–7 were specifically associated with those executed in 1590. In some cases they came from the same parish, notablyLumphanan, supposedly a dynamo of the Aberdeen hunt. ThusMargaret Bane’s dittay refers to Jonet Spaldarg, her sister, and themother of all witches, ‘maist expert in devilische socerie and inchant-mentis’; since the age of fifteen Bane had been art and part of all kindsof witchcraft committed by Spaldarg, and was privy to all her devil-lore, rivalling her in knowledge.Similarly tarnished, through association, was Isobel Richie who wasalso alleged to have been schooled by Spaldarg, to contrive the murderEdward J.

From Spaldarg, ‘who wasburnt in Edinburgh’, she received a magic belt, much coveted for allwho wore it would belong to the Devil; she employed it for witchcraftand sorcery, resulting in several other deaths. Another acquisition wasa witching stick. She also associated with Jonet Grant, ‘witch inCromar’, executed with Spaldarg, who was consulted by the gudewifeof Cloak, seeking a remedy for her bewitched daughter Elspet. Richiehad been sent to ask Grant whether Elspet would have sons, six ofwhom she later bore, but since diablerie was involved they all died atbirth. From her mentor, Spaldarg, Richie received an earthenware con-tainer known as a ‘pig’, ‘full of devylische confectionis of sorcerie’,which were to be used to benefit the forementioned Elspet. But thewitch had been forbidden by the Devil to examine the pig’s contentsand when she took it to Cloak she was worried that the witchcraftmight afflict her; instead its victim was Thomas Forbes who died of afever. Another accused witch, Margaret Bane, testified that Forbes hadappeared to her and her sister as a headless man, seemingly a goodreason for inflicting their enchantments upon him (158). So she toowas associated with the two Jonets executed in Edinburgh in 1590.Indeed Richie had taken Bane to Cloak on many occasions to be consulted by Forbes’ wife and daughter on matters diabolical. Theiractivities, however, had resulted in the deaths of several neighbours aswell as her husband and brother (140–2). What is remarkable in thiscase is that despite all the rumour, innuendo and accusation, Forbes’swidow and daughter received an exemption, stating that they had con-sulted the midwife Bane in good faith.20Such were the potentialdangers of innocently retaining wise women or specialists. The shadowof Spaldarg thus loomed large over the north east for a number ofyears. Her exploits were far from forgotten.The authorities took care to ensure a predominant representationfrom the parishes of the accused on their assizes even though all caseswere tried in Aberdeen, thus involving considerable inconvenience oftravel and time. When these men – and they were all male – are fac-tored in, a reasonable picture can be obtained of the ramifications ofwitch activity and the possibilities for the transmission of knowledgeabout witchlore, throughout a fairly extensive area.21IIIHowever there are very few echoes of distant Aberdeenshire in the dittay of John Fian, which details how the North Berwick 76Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"adventure purportedly commenced in a series of ‘ecstasies andtrances’,22a journey of the imagination to the boundless realms of thehitherto unimagined, a perverted and inverted descent to the depths ofhuman depravity, for which he suffered the horrific physicality of hissubsequent torture and execution. Much more familiar to those awareof the Aberdeenshire cases would have been some of the accusationslevelled at Agnes Sampson. Almost all of the first 32 items in her dittaywere concerned with sickness, or an ability to foretell death, or both.The Devil was dropped into articles 12 and 13, and resided in severalfrom 33 onwards.23Also, the method of incrimination, moving fromcommunal folk activities for the benefit of the commonalty at large, tothe implication of devilry and bewitchment, was almost identical inthe Haddingtonshire and Aberdeenshire cases.It is noticeable that almost 40 years after the Reformation, at whichtime all such holidays and saints days as had been invented by ‘thePapists’ were supposedly outlawed,24most cases are tied to, or datedwithin range of, a festive day, such as Halloween, Fastern’s E’en (ShroveTuesday), Whitsunday, Michaelmas, and Andresmas (St Andrews Day).Ruid Day is observed in September in Dumfries where the Rood Fair isstill held, but in the north-east it is dated to 3 May. There is also refer-ence to the first Monday of the raith, which is the First Quarter of theYear, on which day Margaret Og was seen by her minister casting waterfrom Boglicht Burn over her head and sweeping dew off the Green ofBoglicht, ‘which may be accountit plane witchcraft and devilry and isone of the chief ceremonies thereof’ (143). Neither observance – water-casting nor dew-sweeping – had ever actually been regarded as witch-like, at least not until now when these centuries-old water charms andrituals were suddenly rendered diabolical.The records preserve some of the witches’ aliases, such as Suppok,Shuddack, Scudder and Spaldarg. They were often consulted on mattersconcerning the beginning of the life cycle with reference to pregnancyand childbirth. Thomas Leyis was charged with having informed hisconcubine that unbeknown to herself she was pregnant, specifying theprecise time at which the child was conceived. He also knew that the child was female, and exactly when it would be born, a diabolicalrevelation, most unusually at this period, attributed to a male (98).Margaret Clerach told a man that none of his children would livewhen he refused to marry her (190). Margaret Bane, summoned as amidwife, knew that she was not required because the child had alreadybeen safely born (159). She is one of nine individuals in the Survey ofScottish Witchcraft who are known to have been midwives. She wasEdward J.

She was able, bywitchcraft and sorcery, to inflict, through transference, ‘the hale panes,dolouris, and tormentis’ of childbirth upon the woman’s spouse. Oneman became so furious and demented that he completely lost his witsand died. There is no suggestion here that this was a form of the cou-vadeswhereby men willingly and sympathetically shared the pain ofchildbirth in an attempt to relieve their wives. In another of her casesthe pains were visited upon a man who was not the mother’s husbandand who, ‘during all the tyme of traweling [i.e. travailing], was exceed-inglie and mervelouslie trublit, in ane furie and madness as it wer andcould nocht be haldin’, but once the child was born the pains left him(157–8).Wet-nurses were clearly a source of anxiety.25In his ScotorumHistoriaeof 1527 Hector Boece had warmly commended the practice ofmothers breast-feeding their own children. Like his friend, the greatRenaissance scholar, Erasmus, he believed that such nourishment wasas important as the nurture of the womb,26but wet-nurses remainedvery much in demand. Bessie Roy was accused of having abstractedand transferred to herself the breast-milk of a poor woman whom shedistinguished as a rival for her services. When her victim threatened toexpose her heinous deed, Roy contrived to restore the supply. Sheclearly specialised in birth and child-rearing.27When a man’s mistress found him cheating on her, she persuadedIsobel Cockie to bewitch him into madness and fury, followed by fever(113). Helen Fraser was accused of arranging a marriage, throughbewitchment, against the wishes of the groom’s parents. The bridecommissioned a spell against her disapproving mother-in-law who lostthe strength in the left side of her body before she languished and died(107); in a similar fashion she disposed of a neighbour. Fraser wasfurther accused of causing the death of an ox, just by sitting near thecattle-pen. Another utterly pernicious act was to persuade ‘MuckleChristane’, the hen-wife of Foveran, to put one hand on the crown ofher head, and the other on the sole of her foot, while bequeathing allin between to the Devil, who, in return, pledged that she would wantfor nothing. Such terminology was to become standard in testimonialsdescribing the self-surrender of witches to the Devil. When Christane’shens started to die Fraser advised her to pass the healthy birds through‘the link of the cruik’, the chain which suspended the cooking pot overthe fireplace. She was to kill the last of the birds with a fiery stick to78Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"prevent further problems with failing fowls. The folk of Newburgh, inthe parish of Foveran, greatly feared Fraser. She was accused of causinga cow to give blood instead of milk. One of her spells killed heremployer. She was also accused of bewitching a man to transfer hisaffections from his wife to his harlot, subsequently arranging for thesecret birth of their child (108–9).Isobel Strachan, or Scudder, learned her skills from an elf man (177).She was known as a common marriage-maker who would sew a pennyin a piece of cloth which was then hung around the neck of her clientwho would arrange for the object of their affections to touch it – some-thing of a euphemism since one recommendation was actually to strikethe hapless dupe with the necklace; results, apparently, were guaran-teed (179–80). When one woman rejected the talisman by throwing itin the fire, her house almost burned down. Scudder caused GeorgeBarclay to marry a poor hussy, which amazed many since he was sogoodly and rich, the son of honest parents, and she an ugly harlot ofbase degree who had now contrived his impoverishment (178).Because a woman withheld payment of a chicken, she killed herhusband, and she despatched another man who ‘dang’ (hit) her. Shecaused the death of a new-born by turning it over three times inchildbed.Helen Gray allegedly used her witchcraft to give a man a permanenterection; ‘his wand lay nevir doune’ until he died (126)! One motherrendered her own son-in-law impotent (136). In 1590 Spaldarg wasaccused of having given a secret ‘member’ to John Coutts, of removingthat of John Watt, and also of ‘giving and taking of power from sundrymen’s members’ (206). Jonet Wishart bade her terrified female com-panion to hold on to the feet of a corpse on the gallows while she‘cuttit aff a pairt of all his memberis’, after midnight (94). The MalleusMaleficarummade much of witches’ skills in emasculation, but malegenitalia were popularly believed to possess certain magical and cura-tive properties. It is fairly obvious why witches put the wind up patriar-chal Scotland. In a remarkable charge against Scudder we can almostdetect the outrage of her accusers who stated that a spell laid upon awife-beating husband was so efficacious that never again did he strikeher or find any fault with her, ‘even though she was a waster’ (177).Bessie Thom seems to have been something of a specialist in dispos-ing of husbands – her own, and that of Elspet Jack, who gave her mana ‘slaik’, a smearing substance of some kind, supplied by Thom, whichled to disease and death; she also offered to remove Isobel Irving’sspouse for forty shillings and a hunk of beef (166).Edward J.

Much witch activity was concerned with food,especially milk products such as cheese or butter, when the ‘milknes’was conjured out of them, or cows gave blood instead of milk (101,107, 111, 121, 129). One alleged witch retorted that her accuser mustbe a witch herself because she was able to produce a suspiciouslylargely number of new ‘cabakis’, or cheeses just before Lent, a period ofabstinence and self-denial dictated as much by the natural scarcity of the season as by possible religious considerations (111). A witch whofell out with a tavern-keeper spoiled her ale, jeopardising her liveli-hood. A woman fell ill immediately after consuming some roast shoul-der of lamb and languished for nine months before dying (142–3,152–3). One witch offered a woman a ‘dische of develische pottage’,which would undoubtedly have killed her had she not refused it,strengthened as she was by the spirit of God (128). Food poisoningmust have been common with poor storage and preservation tech-niques, as was starvation when animals or harvests failed. Faminestruck on several occasions throughout the sixteenth century, notablyin 1571–3 and 1585–7, as well as during 1594–8,28thus neatly coincid-ing with the Aberdeenshire witch cases.The blasting of crops was greatly feared. Isobel Cockie, for example,caused Alexander Anderson’s bumper crop of barley to rot in the field,while his neighbours enjoyed successful harvests (114). There is evid-ence also of rival tenants attempting to blight one another’s land.James Og passed through Alexander Cobain’s corn, scattering ninestones from his own rig, in turn taking nine handfuls of earth fromCobain’s holding and casting them on his own ground; on anotheroccasion he administered nine strokes with a white wand so thatnothing but weeds grew. He also tried water charms and carrying cornthree times, widdershins (against the direction of the sun), around thekiln (190–1). Thus humble men attempted to answer the ageless riddleof husbandry, while revealing the social tensions that could be causedby joint tenancies. Why was it that some rigs, on the same farm, weremore productive than others?Many accusations concerned millers and the equipment theyemployed. Thus John Elrick, servant at the Mill of Ludquharn, leavingat 11 one winter’s night to go home, met Agnes Webster, or a devil inher likeness, sitting at a stone, ‘gaping and glowering at him whilespewing fire-brands out of her mouth’, whereby he took a great sick-80Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 80"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ness and could not go home that night (129). Marjory Mutch had adispute with a man about space when both were grinding their meal.He cast some material from the hopper at her, making her determinedthat he would receive a shot in his side in return which, through devil-ment, came to pass when he acquired a sore under his armpit like ablack iron pot which daily grew bigger and bigger, accompanied by a violent fever, until he died (131) – a convincing description, as ithappens, of the symptoms of bubonic plague. Similar afflictionsaffected a woman at the same mill with whom Mutch quarrelled over asieve (133). Isobel Barron, before sunrise on Ruid Day, was seen with alarge quantity of stones in her lap, throwing some in front of her intothe burn and others behind her into the same burn. She also took threesips of water from the burn in a dish and then spewed it out again, so,by witchcraft, preventing the water from feeding into the mill-lade(168). Christian Reid told Walter Miller that he and his mill werebewitched but if he would pay her she would provide a remedy, at leastfor the mill, because she could do little for him personally. Miller pro-nounced that he was not so concerned about his own health as he wasabout the mill. Since his surname was Miller his family had presum-ably followed the craft for some generations and he was thus mindfulthat they should continue to do so in the future. Reid consulted awitch who urged her to scatter some sand upon the mill-stones andwheels in the name of God and Christsonday so that the mill wouldoperate in the old manner. And so due to the wrecking of the machin-ery, meal was ground in the old, less efficient way, presumably byhand (173–5). When a miller refused Scudder oatmeal, she broke themill-wheels by witchcraft; on another occasion she wrecked the dam atthe Mill of Fintry (180).Millers were often regarded as a necessary evil, as men whose fami-lies prospered while others starved, and who would cheat their clientsat any opportunity. Thus while some of the disputes mentioned aboveprobably arose as neighbourly disagreements about quite small-scaleoperations, witch attacks on larger mills may actually have enjoyedsome community support as a way of striking back at the miller. Agood deal of superstition surrounded the craft which millers may havebeen quite happy to foster – the notion for example that their premiseswere protected by the fairies – but in times of panic such conceitscould render the millers vulnerable.29People at all periods worry about their health and the 1590s were noexception. Out of pure malice Jonet Wishart, fresh from consultingwith the Devil, worked her cantrips on Alexander Thomson, mariner,Edward J.

His wife however threatened to expose Wishart who,for reasons of self-preservation, supplied curative drugs. When anotherman for some reason put a linen towel round her neck, suspecting noevil, she, convinced he was intending to strangle her, witched deathupon him and his wife, leaving his children to beg (85–6). Caughtthieving by some schoolboys she arranged to have them drowned. Thiswoman, who was eventually executed, would be worthy of a study inher own right. She inflicted illness and death on a string of people whocrossed her in some way or another (84–97).Helen Fraser agreed to heal John Ramsay ‘bot willit him to keipsecreit quhatsoevir sche spak or did because the warld wes evill, andspak na gude of sic medicinaris’ as herself. He was ordered to rise atdawn to consume bedewed sorrel and another dish made of kale. Hewas then to sit under the hen roost and expose his chest as hens flewby, to loosen his blocked ‘heart-pipes’ or arteries. Fraser uttered a devil-ish spell over his head. Following her instructions he recovered – andthen the rotten ingrate informed on her (165). On another occasionFraser was summoned by Janet Ingram, who was locally reputed awitch, and who had become ill, she believed, through witchcraft.Fraser pronounced that the invalid would soon be well enough but hersickness worsened, turning into a ‘horrible fury and madness’, whichcaused incessant blaspheming and a crazed determination literally toclimb the walls. Having suffered for two days she died, whereuponFraser with two or three of the deceased’s daughters carried the bodyhalfway to the churchyard. When intercepted by Ingram’s husbandand some neighbours, Fraser fled (106). If this curious episode can beinterpreted, as was perhaps the intention of whoever recorded the evidence, as the sorority looking after its own, Fraser and her cohortshad no business usurping the prerogative of the widower.Midwife Margaret Bane bewitched fever and death upon James Rossfor beating up her son, just as she damned another man and a bairn(160). There are many examples of people who were seized with greatfevers which burned them up for a time, and at other periods left themshivering with cold. The experience of the bewitched Margaret Dortieis notable for the graphic description of her symptoms, perhaps sug-gesting something novel, a disease that was unfamiliar. She was over-come with extreme trembling and shaking as if the whole house hadbeen running about with her inside it, before she was overcome with aheavy sickness which rendered her bedfast for eight weeks. For one halfof the day from the middle upwards she burned as if in a fiery furnace,82Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 82"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"roasting with an extreme thirst that no drink, however large, couldsatisfy; from the middle down she was as cold as ice, so that nothingcould warm her, with such a gnawing in her womb, legs and thighs, asif dogs were tearing the flesh from her bones or men stabbing her withknives. And so she continued until her dying day (94). Another hadsimilar symptoms as well as continual flux and vomiting, with a greatswelling. Potential healers were baffled (133). Most commonly thevictims were described, almost formulaically, as roasting in the bodyfor one half of the day, as if in an oven, suffering an extreme burningand insatiable drouth, the other half of the day shivering in an extraor-dinary cold sweat; death almost always resulted (157).Agues must have been common but we soon learn to recognise thesymptoms as those created by witches who have fashioned ‘pictours’(111, 112, 128, 131, 134, 136, 158). Some of the bewitched soughtwitches to un-witch them. Most were gripped by thirst and excessivesweating which sometimes drove them demented. One man in hismadness climbed as high as a steeple (113); in this and other casesperhaps levitation is implied, though whether imagined by witnesses,tormentors or the victim himself is not stated. Transference was ofteninvolved, as when a man’s deadly illness was transposed to a cat whichsubsequently died (120). Witches could blast people as well as crops;spells often resulted in the crippling, laming or paralysis of victims(133).There was an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1597–9. Some of theAberdeenshire cases, however, may refer to the earlier epidemic of1584–8,30since there is a lack of precision about when the witches’alleged afflictions actually took place. A common form of words is‘some nine years or sensyne’ (thereabouts) and some of the descrip-tions suggest panic in the face of unprecedented ravages. The symp-toms mentioned certainly recall those of plague, as does theinformation that sometimes the victims died after five days. Othertypes of illness were also involved though it is intriguing that thoseafflicted, or their loved ones, were less willing to attribute their misfor-tunes to the will of God than they were to the interference of theDevil.IVAndrew Man, self-proclaimed consort of the Fairy Queen, was a wan-dering healer who cured folk from Angus to Moray (117–25).

As a boy he was visited by the Devil in theshape of a woman, whom he came to know as the Queen of Elphen.She promised Man that he would ‘know all things’, would havehealing powers, and would be well looked after, but that, obscurely, hewould seek his meat, or food, before he died, as Thomas Rymour did.Later he supposedly had carnal dealings with the devilish spirit, father-ing several children upon her. She caused one of his cows to die on asmall hill named Elphillock, but promised him only good thereafter.He allegedly confessed that he could raise his master, the Devil, byuttering the expression ‘Benedicte’, and could dismiss him by tucking adog under his left armpit, placing his right hand in the animal’s mouthand enunciating the word ‘Maikpeblis’. He knew Satan by the name ofChristsonday, believing him to be an angel, clad in white clothes, andGod’s godson, even though the latter had a ‘thraw’, or quarrel, withGod, and was the lover of the elfin queen. Christsonday had markedthe third finger of Man’s right hand, presumably in proprietal fashion.Man reported that the Fairy Queen had control of the whole craftbut that Christsonday was the ‘gudeman’ who held all power underGod. Furthermore he had seen dead men in the company of thesetwo supranaturals, among them Thomas Rymour and James IV.Christsonday had appeared in the form of a horse (‘staig’) while thequeen and her attendants rode on white steeds, when she convened toreceive the obscene kiss. The accused attested that elves or fairiesadopted the shape and clothing of ordinary men, though they weremere shadows, but more vigorous than mortals, and could indulge inplaying and dancing whenever they pleased.

He cured animals such as oxenby bleeding them but when dogs lapped the discarded blood theyimmediately died. He successfully treated a man’s ‘deidlie sicknes’ bypassing him nine times forward through a loop of dry yarn, thenmoving a cat nine times backwards through the same loop, whilechanting spells, so that his illness was transferred to the unfortunatefeline, which promptly died. He relieved a woman’s ‘furiositie andmadnes’ through spells. At will he could take away a cow’s milk. Hecould blast crops by stripping the straw off a few stalks and throwing itinto the rest of the field, repeating the curse nine times: ‘The dirt tothee and the crop to me’. To ensure healthy crops he recommendedharrowing before the corn started to sprout, and keeping the crowsaway because the Devil sometimes appeared in their likeness. He wouldrecite a prayer or spell, which he had from memory, nine times, toensure a successful harvest.Man could scrutinise a man’s hand and predict who his wife wouldbe. He allegedly testified that ‘at the Day of Judgement, the fyre will burne the watter and the earth, and mak all plain, and thatChristsonday wilbe cassin in the fyre because he deceives wardlingis[i.e. worldly] men: And this yeir to cum salbe a deir yeir, and that thairsalbe [twice] seven gude yeris thereafter’, which ‘plane witchcraft anddevilrie’ he purportedly received from Christsonday. Most sensationalof all was his revelation that on Judgement Day Christsonday wouldact as notary ‘to accuse everie man, and ilk man will have his awindittay, writtin in his awin buik to accuse himself’, and also that thegodly would be separated from the wicked.Animals figure prominently. Evil spirits appeared as a magpie and ajackdaw. Dipping the plough irons in water through which a salmonhad swum prevented the oxen from bolting (121). Witches caused thedeaths of an ox, and the horse belonging to the master of the EnglishSchool at Kintore, as well as nine score sheep, cattle and other beasts(112). Simply by touching one ox, Isobel Cockie, without saying aword, caused the whole team to tremble and shake as soon as theywere yoked, until, unable to stand, they had to be released, whereuponsome died; when she crossed the path of other draught animals theybecame uncontrollable, tangling one another up (113).

Witches adopted the like-nesses of cats and dogs, and once a stallion, while the Devil alsoappeared as a cat, a horse, a flichtering hen and a lamb, ‘bleating on’his witch. He also took the form of a cripple (164) and of an aged man‘beirdit, with a white gown and a thrummit hat’, which is a woolly hatmade out of weavers’ ends, or thrums (127).33Hares sucked cow’s milk (117). Isobel Robbie was commonly seen inthe form of a hare (191). Such metamorphosis was widely believedthroughout much of Scotland long after this date. Margaret Bane, themidwife of ill repute, was summoned to treat a calf that would notsuck. She insisted on acting alone and in private; the gudeman and hiswife heard her intone a devilish cry, in a terrible voice, making thewhole building tremble. Calf and cow were instantly reconciled but thegudewife, terrified out of her wits, took to her sickbed with a diseasethat proved fatal (158). Agnes Frain was a cattle specialist, using hairsfrom her cow’s tail to increase her milk yields while blighting those ofher neighbours. She treated sick calves with tender loving care, minoroperations, and magic, as in carrying the calf three times round thecow; on one occasion she had a cow foster a horse. While the bull wasserving the cow, a knife was thrown three times over its back; MargaretOg who performed this ritual also used her own headlace or ribbon,cut into nine pieces and buried under the byre door, to bewitch cattleto death (143–4).One woman, when clipping her sheep, turned the shears three timesin the animals’ mouths; she fatally bewitched some sheep by throwingburn-water in their faces (192). A witch destroyed a man’s pet lamb,apparently because it consumed too much milk (129). Another blastedher sister’s sheep to death, along with those of a neighbour, when theyinvaded her bleachfield. For good measure she also used three feathersplucked from one of her sister’s geese to conjure a spell resulting in thedeaths of 60 others. When she moved house she killed her cockereland took him to her new place for unspecified nefarious purposes.When her cows were calving she would knot red thread into their tails,a well-known apotropaic. Bewitched animals might die instantly, orwithin five or six weeks, and even in one case, four years after theinitial enchantment (146)!The main business of witches was of course spells, charms and conju-rations; most of them, despite their alarming, exotic and potentiallyfatal consequences, firmly rooted in the mundane. Helen Fraser con-jured a spell for the salmon-fishers of Newburgh, consisting of four86Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"pieces of salmon and a penny, which was to be deposited under thestem-post of a coble, or fishing boat. So equipped, one man caught 12fish at the first attempt (106–7), though Fraser also allegedly causedthree deaths, including those of a mother and baby (108). The daugh-ter of the Reader of Kintore picked up a tangle of multi-colouredthreads in the midden. Fearing witchcraft she threw it in the fire whichgave ‘sic ane gryt crack that they believed the house sould hef fallendown and smoorit [i.e. smothered] them’. Immediately thereafter shetook to her bed and 20 days later she was dead (120). Isobel Cockie wasforced to un-witch a man when his son threatened to burn her (114).On another occasion she relieved a millwright, a victim of the Evil Eye,who was consumed with fever, but she ‘wald not grant that it waswitchcraft’. The cure consisted of three draughts of a herbal drinkmixed with butter and saffron, as well as an elaborate ritual involvingthe knotting of green threads upon which the witch blew. When thepatient inquired why she did so she replied that no one knew theanswer. She then passed the thread around the man’s body, under hisoxters, and threw it in the fire, while leaving another thread aroundhis waist for 24 hours; when it broke, he had his wife burn it. The samewife fetched water from a south-running stream, washed him with it,and returned it to the burn. For this service the witch was paid 20 shillings in silver, half a firlot of meal, plus a meal-chest for herdaughter if he recovered (115).One witch was accused, among other things, of visiting a standingstone, and of taking fire, in a time of great snow, from a cold frostydyke and carrying it to her house (129). Another, at Halloween, wasseen to remove a burning coal from her house to bury it in her yard(190). Margaret Bane took a burning peat out of William Ross’s houseto her own abode and shortly thereafter William died (159). WhenJonat Leask in the parish of Ellon moved from Deepheather, which isstill on the map, to a new dwelling at the Ford of Fortrie, she wasaccused of having taken a burning coal from her old house to the new,even though fire was available in houses one and a half miles closer toher new abode, ‘which may be esteemed and is special points of witch-craft’, an assertion which did not convince her assize (135).When arrested one accused possessed a witch’s bag or purse contain-ing coloured threads and twisted wire allegedly used for necromanticpurposes (148–9). Such materials, together with pieces of cloth and bitsof nails, were often buried to produce magic. A man died when hehandled a paper containing sorcerous writing, though he could notread (150).

She was found by a neighbour beside cairnswhich she had erected for devil-worship, casting earth and stones overher shoulder; he was bewitched to death for the intrusion (145–7).One sorceress could allegedly raise and lay the wind according toSatan’s teachings, rendering gales so fierce and vehement none couldhold their feet upon the ground. Another was told that she wasindicted ‘for practising thy witchcraft in laying on the wind, andmaking of it to becumin calme and lowdin [i.e. lulled], a speciall pointtechit thee by thy maister Satan’. She supposedly took a beetle, hung itup on a string or thread, ‘and quhispering theron thy develisch orisonsbe a certaine space, throw the quhilk thy develisch witchcraft, sa usitbe thee, the wind that blew loud, the quhilk na man, for the gretnessand vehemencie therof, cud hauld his feit upoun the ground, becamcalme and low. And this thow can nocht deny’ (151). The latter chill-ing sentence generally meant that the victim had already confessedand thus was doomed. These blusterous accusations sound more likethe attributes of legendary witches, or those at North Berwick, as dosome of the claims in the list of accusations against Marion Grant. Sheknew the Devil as Christsonday, carnally as well as socially, and hadoften danced with him and with ‘Our Ladye, a fine woman’, clad in awhite petticoat. Grant allegedly claimed that she could charm a swordto ensure that its owner would never be wounded. The swordsmanneeded to hold the naked blade in his right hand kissing the guard,and then to make three crosses on the road with the weapon, in thename of Father, Son, Holy Ghost and Christsonday, a ceremonylearned from the last-named, who also advised of a protective spellinvolving a cross made of rowan, or mountain ash, placed on aperson’s right shoulder, before he turned round three times invokingthe same foursome. The dreaded Scudder gathered a number of ‘deidfolks baines’ from the kirkyard at Dyce, washing them lightly in waterwhich she used on the sick William Symmer. She then orderedWilliam’s mother-in-law to cast the bones into the River Don, where-upon ‘the water rumbled as if all the hills had fallen therein’ (180).34Such accounts seem to fit well with the attributed locations of witches’conventions, in kirkyards, or at crossroads, mounds, hills, cairns andwaters (133). Witches were believed to haunt the timeless landscape ofAuld Scotia while the God of the reformers cleansed the causeways of Scotland’s cities and towns.There were spells involving property which sometimes resulted inillness; others were concerned with rents and the prospering or other-wise of the tenant.

Two men were bewitched to bankruptcy (126, 132).References to houses shaking in the midst of great din (148–9) are notuncommon in witch testimonials, which may suggest that some people felt far from secure in their dwellings; some of the buildings,constructed of flimsy materials, may have proved vulnerable to the elements. Such anxieties would fit with other evidence, for one of the truly terrifying aspects of witches was that they supposedlyinvaded a person’s domestic space, in her or his own home, at thefireside or in bed; nowhere was immune from their incursions. On the other hand, earthquakes were not unknown; one such was feltfrom Perth to Cromarty and Kintail on 23 July 1597.35Witch-hunting in the 1590s was not confined to Haddington andAberdeen. There is some trace of a witch infestation in Berwickshireaffecting such places as Duns, Eyemouth and Coldingham. A witchexecuted in Liddesdale was associated in some way with a ‘supersti-tious well’. Such wells, which attracted pilgrimages from folk in searchof cures, were condemned by the Kirk.36The Border witches allegedlyadmitted responsibility for a blight affecting livestock.37A witch atFala, south of Dalkeith, had a dispute with a neighbour over an acre ofland. She was acquitted of having secured the services of a notoriouswitch in Lauderdale, to visit sickness and death upon her rival.Christian Stewart of Perth, on the other hand, was convicted of havingbewitched Patrick Stewart with a black cloth.38The case which prompted the recall of commissions for witch trialsin 1597 was that of Margaret Atkin, the ‘Great Witch of Balwearie’,who allegedly reported a convention in Atholl attended by a ludicrous2,300 witches. Some of the latter were reportedly tried by swimming –‘by binding of their two thumbs and their great toes together, for,being casten in the water, they floated ay aboon’, a statement doublysuspect because it is one of the very few references to this practicebeing used in Scotland. By looking into the eyes of suspects Atkincould tell a witch by a secret mark, but when the experiment was repli-cated she failed to identify them and eventually confessed to fraud.39The last significant case of the 1590s resulted in the conviction ofthree women for witchcraft at Edinburgh in November 1597. As in the Aberdeen examples most of the charges were health-related, butwith some interesting embellishments. Thomas Guthrie, a baker inHaddington, requested the assistance of Christian Livingstone, fearinghe was bewitched, as indeed she showed by unearthing on his premisesa little black bag, containing some wheat seeds, worsted threads of different colours, hairs and fingernails.

She confided that her daughter had been taken awayby the fairies who communicated the information that Guthrie’s wifewould give birth to a son, as she did. Livingstone and one of her co-accused were consulted by Robert Baillie, mason in Haddington, aboutcuring the bewitchment of his wife; however, a special drink of wortand butter, and bathing in a mixture of woodbine and rose petals, wereto no avail. Cures for other people involved a bannock baked withcock’s blood and flour, shirts soaked in a well or south running water,invocations of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the firing of water – that is,putting a red-hot iron bar into it – and burning straw at each corner ofthe bed.A cure for wedonypha (puerperal fever) was to pass the patient threetimes through a garland of green woodbine which was then cut intonine pieces and thrown in the fire, a remedy which Bessie Aitken hadlearned from an Italian stranger named Mr John Damiet, ‘ane notor-ious knawin enchanter and sorcerer’.40Epileptics had to hang a specialstone around their necks for five nights. Livingstone allegedly claimedthat she could heal leprosy, ‘which the most expert men in medicineare not able to do’, by applying a salve made from mercury. When shegave one leper a drink containing the same element, however, he sur-vived a mere 12 hours. One woman was treated for a pain in her loinsby bathing with a mixture of red nettles and a herb called StinkingAlexander, thereafter being anointed with the latter mixed with butter;for good measure she was also passed nine times through a woodbinegarland, on three separate occasions, 12 hours apart. Another patient,taken from her sickbed and held upright by her two sisters, waswashed, in the name of St Giles, with sea-water collected in nine mea-sures or ‘sups’ from the shore at Cramond. Yet another, allegedlyinjured by one of two midwives, was treated with a burning coal and asalve of nettles and woodbine, followed by a garlanding and an appli-cation of sheep dung. The recommended cure for one man was anoint-ing with the juice and dripping of five kittens roasted in the stomachof a green goose.41Throughout the entire trial record the Devil is notso much as mentioned. Bessie Aitken avoided execution because she was pregnant and, having been confined after giving birth, shereceived a royal pardon, commuting her sentence to banishment on 15 August 1598, one partially happy outcome to this lethal affair.Otherwise the demonisation of folk culture proceeded apace.Helen Fraser of Foveran confessed that she was a common abuser ofthe people and that to sustain herself and her bairns she ‘pretended90Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_05_cha03.pdf 19/10/07 9:50 AM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"knowledge quhilk scho had not, and undertook to do things quhilkscho could nocht’; she was reported by all ‘of whatever estate or sex, tobe a common and abominable witch’ (105, 109). The condemned weregenerally led out between the hills, bound to a stake, strangled, andtheir bodies burned. By no means all were executed. Those appointedto the assize demanded proof of some kind before they wouldcondemn, and not all decisions were unanimous. A couple of witchesdamned themselves because they attempted to bribe their tormentors(161). Suppok claimed that she knew nothing about witchcraft apartfrom what she had learned from a neighbour (114). Yet Margaret Bane,Jonet Leask and Jonet Davidson were said to have been active aswitches for 30 years and Isobel Cockie for 40 (160, 176, 115); AndrewMan allegedly met the elfin queen for the first time some 60 yearsbefore his trial (119). This must imply that the communities in whichthey subsisted were complicit. Alexander Hardie later repented havingdefended Helen Fraser in the presence of her assize, knowing ‘evi-dentlie hir to be giltie of death’; appropriately, in the circumstances, hedied as a result of her witchcraft (108). In terms of the Witchcraft Actof 1563, those who sought cures for themselves or their animals, whodesired that the goodness be returned to the cow’s milk, or who hadmade requests for spells, were as guilty as the witches themselves.Admittedly no such clients are known to have been executed, but, inchallenging witches, Kirk and State were tackling the culture of thesubordinate classes of Scotland head on.VThere is ample evidence that the assault continued throughout the seventeenth century and beyond.42One might think here in terms ofclass conflict, of Thorstein Veblen’s ideas on how the aristocracy andupper middle classes during this period cultivated new sports and pas-times, often requiring special equipment, in order to distinguish them-selves and their pursuits from the vulgar pastimes of the lower orders,or of Norbert Elias’s theories on the cultivation of manners, somethingof an obsession with Scottish writers up to, and including, theEnlightenment.43The witch-hunt has been deemed symptomatic of aProtestant obsession with creating the godly society,44a goal whichremained as elusive as an interview with God himself. Pious and holyfolk believed they were living in the ‘Last Days’ when the house had tobe tidied for the most celebrated and distinguished visitor in History,who would also end that History, Jesus Christ himself.

But in secular terms the gulfbetween elite and popular was widening in terms of wealth, education,language, living conditions, occupation, recreation and outlook; thevulgar and the ethnic were increasingly despised.It is difficult to judge whether women experienced further subor-dination in this equation. Were Scottish men in the aftermath of Maryof Guise and Mary Queen of Scots, and their female cousins in Englandand the Continent, fearful of some sort of gender revolt? Were womenas tradition-bearers somehow regarded as the harbingers of supersti-tion? In the Witchcraft Survey 85 per cent of the cases were female,over half of whom were over 40 years of age. Is this evidence of gen-derism and ageism? Were women condemned as witches because someof them (the victims included) dared to raise their heads above thepatriarchal parapet? The speculation will continue.45The witch-hunt may be indeed seen as a metaphor for the attackon Scottish folk belief and popular culture, but if such was its pur-pose we can see it failing at a comparatively early stage in the scare.The witchfinders could not oppose an entire society, which may be why the witch-hunt in Scotland seems to consist of localised outbreaks rather than national panics.46It was not only the witcheswho pretended knowledge which they had not and undertook to do things they could not. The same could be said for their tormentors.Notes1 J. Goodare, ‘The Scottish witchcraft act’, Church History, 74 (2005), 39–67.2Statutes of the Scottish Church, 1225–1559, (ed.) D.

The woman, traditionally known as JanetHorne, warmed herself, thinking the fire had been lit to take the chillfrom her bones and not, as was actually intended, to burn her todeath. Or so the story goes. This case is well known as the last exampleof the barbarous practice of burning witches in Scotland. It is also infamous for some of its more unusual characteristics – such as thealleged witch ‘having ridden upon her own daughter’, whom she had‘transformed into a pony’, and of course, the memorable image of thepoor, deluded soul warming herself while the instruments of her deathwere being prepared. Impressive materials, though the most familiarparts of the story did not appear in print until at least 92 years after theevent!1Ironically, although Gaelic-speaking Scotland has been notedfor the relative absence of formal witch persecutions, it has becomememorable as the part of Scotland that punished witches later thananywhere else.Another irony is that one of the earliestScottish witch-hunts tookplace in Easter Ross, in 1577–8, when the sheriff of Cromarty autho-rised the arrest of six men and 26 women on assorted charges of witch-craft. Among them was Kenneth Ower, or Coinneach Odhar, identifiedby the late Rev. William Matheson as none other than the Brahan Seerof tradition. He was (and is) one of the best-known prophets inScottish history, and was most likely executed as a witch, ‘principal orleader of the art of magic’, in 1578, at Chanonry (Fortrose) on theBlack Isle. As Matheson demonstrated, Coinneach the seer operated ina purely Gaelic context in which he was associated with Lewis andEaster Ross. Also charged were Marjory Millar, daughter of RobertMillar, smith in Assynt, as were Thomas McKain Moir McAllane9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"McHenrik, also known as Cassindonisch (Cas an donais, Devil’s foot)and Christian Ross; the two last named suffered execution in 1577.2Another was William McGillivray who was accused of having passed to Lady Foulis, at Easter 1577, a small box ‘of witchcraft’, possibly containing spells or ointments.3Several other Gaelic speakers amongthose arrested survived to face further charges of witchcraft in the well-known trial of Katherine Ross, Lady Munro of Foulis, in 1590. Onewas Marion, or Marjory, Neane McAllester, known as Losgoloukart(Losgagh-luchairt, which apparently means ‘Burn the Castle’, thoughprecisely why is unknown).

It was further alleged that she had consulted the elffolk.4Lady Foulis and her stepson, Hector, were both acquitted bywhat look like packed assizes. Indeed Hector was chief prosecutor of hisstepmother before he was himself accused of witchcraft.5The casedepicts a weird fairy tale of internal family rivalries, but it undoubtedlyinvolved several Gaels who paid the supreme penalty.IThe areas of Scotland most affected by witch-hunting were the Lowlandand predominantly Scots-speaking parts of the country. The Highlandand Gaelic-speaking regions appear to have been largely, but notentirely, exempt from large-scale witch panics.6One explanation forthis has been that the Gaels must have been more tolerant towardswitches, though this does not sufficiently allow for the poor survival ofevidence. A more convincing argument concerns the role of theChurch. It is well known that kirk sessions played a crucial part in theprosecution of Lowland witches; sessions may have been less powerfuland slower to take hold in the Highlands.7The terrain of the Highlands may have made it difficult for witchpanics to spread out of control, keeping accusations local and specific.The sheer size of some parishes could have acted as an obstacle, at leastfrom the authorities’ point of view. There were potential financial barriers to consider since suspects were generally transported to admin-istrative centres to be held before and during trials. Applying for acommission to deal with local cases was also expensive.8What is the Gàidhealtachdexactly? This is an interesting questionwith regard to defining what is meant by Highland witch belief and96Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"witch-hunting. The term is a linguistic rather than a geographical one.Areas that we might not regard as part of the Gàidhealtachdtoday – forinstance, Perthshire, Stirlingshire, the Angus glens, Dunbartonshire,the Kintyre peninsula, and Arran – were definitely regarded as such inthe period of the witch-hunts.9In effect, this broadens the scope ofenquiry. Likewise, the adoption of a cultural, rather than a regional,definition allows for the incorporation of evidence of Highland witchbelief turning up in non-Highland contexts.IIThe Highlands and Islands have often been regarded as having moretradition, more folklore and more ‘superstition’ than the rest of thecountry. However, the most severe punishment of witches took placein the allegedly more ‘civilised’ and supposedly less ‘superstitious’ partof Scotland. The level of witch belief certainly seems to have beenshared equally between the Gaelic-speaking and Scots-speaking parts ofthe country. It has been argued that although witches were equallycommon in the Highlands as in the Lowlands, when the position ofthe ‘witch in the community’ is examined, ‘we see the considerable dif-ference in attitudes towards the function of witchcraft in the lowlandsouth’. In the Highlands, ‘where the people were closer to nature andperhaps, understood, or at least tolerated, witches with a charitable orquasi-Christian kindness, there were few instances of the mercilesshunts for witches which were so characteristic of almost the whole ofthe rest of Europe’.10In the mid-1970s, Alfred Truckell asserted that onthe witch-hunting map of Scotland the Gaelic Highlands and North-West constituted a blank. There were no executionsin the Gaelic-speaking areas proper – only a few on the borders ofGaelic territory ... and the evidence is almost all primitive magic,cursing, laying on or taking off of illness: hardly any shape-changing, no sabbats, no child-murder or cannibalism: evidencegiven by simple town or country folk in fact, and not by educatedministers in touch with international writings on the subject –whereas these figure largely in the East and Centre of Scotland.11It could, of course, be said that there is little evidence of child-murderand cannibalism in Lowland Scotland either. Christina Larner’s excel-lentEnemies of Godfocused on the main regions of witch-huntingactivity (the north, south-eastern, and south-western districts) and asLizanne Henderson979780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"such is almost useless when it comes to Highland witch-hunting. As Larner stated, ‘some areas saw very little witch-hunting. In theHighlands, especially those parts outside the Kirk sessions system andwithin the dominion of the clans there was no witch-hunting, or nonethat reached the records’. Furthermore, ‘Gaelic-speaking areas ingeneral provided very few cases although Tain in Ross-shire was anexception to this’. She pointed out that Tain had cases ranging from1590 to 1699, and that during the great hunt of 1661–2 several casesemerged in Strathglass in which the landlord was unscrupulously usingwitchcraft accusations as a way of evicting unwanted tenants. ‘On thewhole, though’, Larner observed that, ‘Gaelic patronymic names ... arerare in lists of suspects’. There were, she asserted, ‘no demonic witchesin the Highlands and Islands during the period of the hunt’.12Shenoted that in the Highlands ‘witches, like the fairies, were often anony-mous’. While I would concur with Larner about the anonymity of the fairies, I do not fully agree with her about the namelessness of Highland witches; I have come to know at least some of them byname. She also stated that if the witches were known individuals theywere ‘credited with possessing the evil eye which is regarded as distinctfrom witchcraft and can cause unintended harm’.13The association of witches with the evil eye is an interesting one,and does raise questions of the regionality of certain beliefs. However,this particular association was by no means peculiar to theHighlands.14As for its distinctiveness from witchcraft, MacLagan’sstudy of the Evil Eye in the Western Highlands(1902) asserted that ‘thereis no witchcraft necessary to the Evil Eye, but that the processes for itscure undoubtedly are witchcraft’. He also commented that ‘it is specially difficult to distinguish between the Evil Eye and witchcraft inthe case of loss of the due produce of cattle – butter, cream, &c.’15Thepower of the evil eye was discussed briefly by the physician MartinMartin from Skye, himself a Gael, who travelled throughout the Islandsin 1695. He was informed that misfortunes or even death could resultfrom this ill-fated glance, children and cattle being most at risk. Martincould name some of those believed to have ‘this unhappy faculty, thoat the same time void of any ill design’.16The idea that the evil eye isnot, in itself, witchcraft is reinforced by J. G. Campbell’s commentsthat the condition is brought on by a ‘discontented and unhappymind, full of envy (farmad), covetousness (sanntachadh), and such likemean feelings’. Cures for the evil eye (eòlas a chronachaidh) could be obtained from a neighbourhood ‘wise woman’, but could only becarried out on Thursday or Sunday.17When a woman admired a child,98Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 98"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"she would often say, Gu’m beannaich an Sealbh thu; cha ghabh mo shuilort(‘God bless you, my eye shall not punish you’).18However, othercommentators, such as J. M. McPherson who concentrated mainly, butnot exclusively, on the North-East, have stressed the connection betweenthe witch and the power of her gaze; ‘the evil eye was one of the witch’sweapons in most frequent use’ and possession of this ‘gift’ was ‘due tothe devil’s instruction’.19IIIChristina Larner concluded that the ‘impersonal and apolitical witch-beliefs of the Highlands caused less human suffering than the witch-beliefs of central and lowland Scotland’.20It would be pointless todispute the substance of this statement, for there is no doubt that thepersecution of witches in the Lowlands was, in general, more ferociousand more politically charged than it was in the Gàidhealtachd. How-ever, this would be of little comfort to those Gaels who found them-selves the victims of an accusation. For this reason alone, it is necessary to take a closer look at the impact witch-hunting had on theHighlands. For example, were there really as few cases as has been gen-erally accepted? The total number of legal accusations and executionsin the area listed in the Larner, Lee and McLachlan Source-Book ofScottish Witchcraft(1977) was 89, but revised figures are much higher.The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft (2003) lists at least 6 per cent of allcases – somewhere around 230 individual cases in the Highlands andIslands, most of those occuring in Bute, Argyll, Nairn, Inverness, Ross-shire, Sutherland, and the northern, but mainly non-Gaelic county of Caithness. These may not represent a high percentage, but it is certainly not insignificant if the numbers given for other regions areconsidered, such as the estimated 2 per cent for the Central region, 5 per cent for Caithness, Orkney and Shetland, 6 per cent for Tayside, 7 per cent for Grampian including Aberdeen, and 9 per cent for theBorders. The worst affected areas were Fife, with an estimated 12 percent, Strathclyde with 14 per cent, and a staggering 32 per cent fromthe Lothians.21The earliest reliable Scottish population data come fromWebster’s census of 1755; this gave a total of 1,265,380 persons inScotland, of which the four principal Highland counties of Argyll, Rossand Cromarty, Inverness, and Sutherland had 194,707, a figure whichrepresents 15.4 per cent of the national total.22This is likely to reflect aminimumof Gaelic speakers, since it does not include Gaels in the frontier regions mentioned above, such as Dumbarton and Perthshire.Lizanne Henderson999780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"IVThere are several questions that we could ask about the Highland-Lowland divide. Was there really a different conception of who andwhat witches were, and what powers they possessed? One somewhatself-regarding view suggests that in the Highlands, though peopleshared a belief in witches, it was of a different nature to that found in the rest of Scotland, or indeed of Europe. The ‘evidence on theHighland witches is that while they have many similar points ofcontact, conduct and attitude with their sisters in the Scottish south,there is, comparatively, very little of the repulsive element in theircharacter’. The gentler witch of the north did not, in this commenta-tor’s charitable view, embrace the demonic aspect, making no mentionof the ‘incubus, the succubus, nor of midnight meetings, Sabbats,dancing with the Devil’ and other such common abominations. Nordid Highland witches ride on broomsticks or raise the dead.23This wasallegedly due to the region’s comparative inaccessibility and ‘becauseof the different nature of the fundamental and elemental beliefs of theHighlanders who saw in nature the natural phenomenon rather thanthe miraculous’. In other words, it was the ‘proximity of the Highlandlifestyle to nature’ that created a notion of the witch as ‘more a figureof legend, mythology and folktale, rather than a reality to be feared,hated and persecuted’.24While the comparatively low demoniccontent in Highland witchcraft cases may be noteworthy, the witchfigure was not just a character from legends and fairy tales.Comparisons between the motifs and general characteristics foundin witch trial testimonials from various regions differ mainly in thelevel of such activities as entering into a demonic pact, attendance atthe witches’ sabbat, night-flying, and intercourse with the Devil. ManyHighland cases did not concern themselves with demonic interferencebut rather with the mundane problems of everyday life, particularlydisputes between neighbours, or interference with dairy and other agricultural produce. The Devil was not entirely absent from Highlandwitchcraft cases, as we shall see from the Bute trials in 1662, but rarelyplayed a significant role judging from the trial evidence. However,witch belief in many Lowland cases, when examined at village level,does not suggest that the Devil’s presence was a pre-requisite of witchcraft. The involvement of the Devil was overwhelmingly alearned intervention. From this point of view, Highland witch beliefs,as manifested in trial records, are not particularly unique or differentfrom, say, evidence from the south-west of Scotland, another area100Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"largely unconcerned with the more colourful demonic aspects ofwitchcraft.25The figure of the Devil has, of course, been much moreconspicuous within Highland folk tale and tradition in general, knownin Gaelic by a variety of different names such as An donas‘the badone’,Am fear nach abair mi‘the one whom I will not mention’, andDòmhnall Dubh‘Black Donald’.26Is there evidence to suggest that Gaelic society was more tolerant ofwitches? There appear to be no official records of witch trials in Skyeand the Outer Hebrides. However, the researches of John MacInnes,based on a vast body of fascinating information drawing upon oral tradition, indicate that unofficial persecution, punishment, and evenexecution by the community sometimes occurred. One very interestingpoint that he makes is that there is no native Gaelic word for ‘witch’;the Gaelic word for a (female) witch, Banabhuidseach, entered the lan-guage at a late stage, perhaps in the late sixteenth or early seventeenthcentury. The term now embraces healers and wise women as well as witches. The possible implications for the introduction to theHighlands and Islands of an essentially non-Gaelic word or conceptshould be considered. Does it mean that ‘at some stage a new kind of“witch” came into Gaelic society, bringing new practices’ or was it‘only that a new term came into the language, leaving belief and practice unaltered’?27If it was the former, then a new awareness of theimportance of witchcraft, or more specifically of witch-hunting, wasevolving within early modern Highland culture.One reason given for the low number of witchcraft trials in neigh-bouring Ireland was the near absence of literature on the subject.Unlike England, which had something of a ‘literary war’ on both sidesof the debate regarding the reality of witchcraft, Ireland produced onlyone pamphlet in 1699. The argument is that ‘the absence of this formof literature in Ireland seriously hindered the advance of the belief in(and consequent practice of) witchcraft’.28Furthermore, judicial torturewas not used in the few trials for witchcraft that did take place, andexecution by burning at the stake was not used to any extent.29RonaldHutton suggests that ‘Gaelic Ireland affords a classic case of a societywhich did not fear the witch-figure because it ascribed misfortune toother sources’, namely the fairies. ‘If Gaelic Scotland’, he argues, ‘hadthe same system of belief, together with all its other cultural similar-ities, then the absence of witch trials there is explained’,30a suggestionwhich is not really tenable because the belief in fairies, which was equallystrong in non-Gaelic areas of Scotland, clearly did not lessen the amountof witch persecution. Indeed the opposite could be maintained, namelyLizanne Henderson1019780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"that the demonisation of fairy belief intensified witch-hunting.31Ano-ther commentator has argued that witch-hunting was rare in Irelandbecause Catholics did not want to denounce witch suspects to Protest-ant courts. While an interesting theory, it would not be convincing ina Scottish context – for example, the Seton involvement in the NorthBerwick case.32VSome parallels with the Easter Ross cases of 1577–8 and 1590 appear in the imperfectly reported account of the Argyll witches who becameimplicated in a murderous conspiracy which threatened to tear apartthe great Clan Campbell in the early 1590s.33John Campbell of Ardking-lass, among others, was suspected of the assassination of his rival JohnCampbell of Calder in 1592 and was therefore out of favour with theearl of Argyll. He approached Margaret Campbell, widow of John OgCampbell of Cabrachan, one of the conspirators, to ask whether, throughwitchcraft, she could arrange his reconciliation with his chief.34Margaretcunningly responded that witches could do nothing for him unlessthey were fully informed of the facts. Ardkinglass then not only admit-ted his guilt but also named all his accomplices in the conspiracy.Much of what is known of the plot against John Campbell of Calderoriginated with Margaret Campbell who gave her deposition in Gaelic,rendered into Scots by three translators including the bishop of Argylland the dean of Lismore. She confessed without any kind of torture,interrogators or compulsion, in the process supplying fascinatinginsights into Highland witch belief.Ardkinglass, apparently aware that ‘all witchcraft is to be practiced inthe begining of every quharter’, and realising that the harvest quarterwas approaching, was keen for Margaret to start work. She promisedhim that she would have something to report before Lammas (1 August).35After returning home to Lismore, Margaret set aboutasking her contacts what fate would befall Ardkinglass and his men.Firstly, there was ‘Nichaicherne’, witch in Morvern, who foresaw thatthe conspirators would be held in Edinburgh but would return homesafely. However, one of their number, MacCoul (Duncan Macdougallof Dunollie), though escaping punishment for a long time, ‘at the lastwald pay for it’.36Then there was Euphrick Nikceoll, who ‘tuik uponhir to convert my Lord’s angir and to mak him to favour Ardkinglass’,37and Dougald Macaurie, who, though he enchanted Ardkinglass’s men,‘that nae wapin suld offend thame’, failed to enchant Ardkinglass102Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"himself. There was also a Lismore woman, ‘Mary voir Nicvolvoire vicCoil vic Neil, quha is not ane witch but sche will see things to cum besum second sicht’.38Margaret Campbell confessed that her late husband, John Og, theconspirator, had several times consulted witches and that she had beenpresent when these witches had promised him that they would restorehim to Argyll’s favour. She named Katherene NicClaartie andNichachlerich in ‘Blargoir’. From Lismore, Euphrick Ninicol Roy coun-selled John Og to leave the country in haste for she saw ‘an evil hourcome on him’, and Christian Nichean vic Couil vic Gillespie took itupon herself ‘to do gude to John Oig’.By September 1593, Ardkinglass had become unimpressed byMargaret Campbell’s efforts. He told her that he had found a far betterenchanter than any of her contacts: a minister, Patrick MacQueen.39Ardkinglass asked Margaret if the witches she employed had invokedGod or Jesus in their spells, to which she replied ‘that the witchesnamit God in thair words’. He then informed her that MacQueen didnot cite God in his practices, and that his witchcraft and enchant-ments were being hindered by these witches and their naming of God.He therefore commanded her to ‘discharge all the witches’ immedi-ately. MacQueen’s apparent inability to counter the influence of theGod-invoking witches seems to contradict Ardkinglass’s alleged claimthat he was so skilled in his craft that he could make up and build acastle between sundown and sunrise! A confused passage in the deposi-tion seems to suggest that MacQueen foretold that Ardkinglass andDuncan Campbell of Glenorchy would be arrested but would subse-quently escape through his own intervention. It appears that the min-ister also claimed that if he were captured he would escape by invokingseven devils who attended him. As proof of his powers he confided toArdkinglass that the countess of Argyll’s first child would be a girl andthe second a boy. He darkly predicted that Argyll would lose a battle inwhich the heir to the comital family would fall – an obscure passagewhich has been interpreted as a reference to the Battle of Glenlivet(October 1594) when Archibald Campbell of Lochnell was killed. Afurther claim attributed to MacQueen was that if he was permitted topractice his craft for seven years unchallenged, he would make Argyllrepent his actions, driving him from place to place and allowing himno rest untilhe brocht him to the end of his lyfe quhilk suld be in the Lawlandsand upon the cassay [i.e. causeway] of Edinbrught and furder thatLizanne Henderson1039780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"geif [i.e. if] he wes sufferit to perseveir in his doing he suld mak thehaill name of Campbell in Argyll to fall, the housis of Ardkinglassand Glenurqhye alone excepted, and that in the end the haill suldbe pairtit betwixt theye twa and that theye suld differ amang them-selfes extreamly for the haill leivings of the Campbells and that thesword suld end the matter amang thame.40The witches of Margaret Campbell’s acquaintance were mostly womenwho had the gift of second sight, a feature which seems to be consis-tent with Highland witch beliefs in general. Perhaps an unexpectedfeature is that while the witches invoked the power of God to enhancetheir skills, the minister, who was also second sighted, did not.VIIt would seem that wherever the Kirk spread its tentacles, witch perse-cution followed. In the Highlands, however, the situation was differentfrom the rest of Scotland. The combination of kirk sessions, presbyter-ies and synods, although it operated like a well-oiled machine in thegreater Edinburgh area, stalled as it approached the Highlands andIslands. The first meeting of the synod of Argyll at Inveraray did nottake place until 1639 and it was responsible not only for Argyll, butalso for Arran and Bute, the western mainland of Inverness as far northas Glenelg, and the Inner and Outer Hebrides.41Church business was ageographical nightmare, as many ministers could not make it to themeetings. In 1643, the synod decided that the ministers of Skye had toattend the meetings only every two years, in consideration of the longdistance, the difficulties of both sea and land travel, and the time spentaway from their flocks. The large size of parishes was also an issue. In1642 it was decided that Arran and Islay would require two ministerseach.42Despite the difficulties, the synod referred a man charged withsorcery to the presbytery of Inveraray, sent another to a civil judge forusing a divinatory charm known as ‘turning the riddle’, and demol-ished a healing well at Loch Long that was being used ‘superstitiously’to cure diseases.43In 1649 the synod appointed several brethren ‘totake tryall of all witches, sorcerers, charmers, palmisters, juglurs,second sighted divyners, soothsayers, nicromancers, consulters withspirits and such lyke’.44At the peak of its ascendancy, presbyterian-ism’s grip was reaching for the innards of Argyll and the Isles.Four suspects were rounded up by the provost of Tain in 1628, ofwhom Agnes Nein Donald in Bruach and Marion Nein Gillimichaell in104Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 104"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the parish of Edirtayne had ‘long been suspected of witchcraft’. Thewomen absconded, ‘thinking heereby to eshew thair deserved punish-ment’.45Another Ross-shire case, in 1629, generated a list of suspectsfor trial, including such women as Katharine Nein Rob Aunchtie, Marie Nein Eane Eir alias McIntoshe, Katharine Memphersoun aliasNaunnchie, and Gradoche Neinechat, ‘who have been long suspectedof witchcraft’.46The year 1662 was a particularly bad year for witch-hunting acrossScotland, and the Highlands were no exception. In May of that year, acommission was granted to Sir George MacKenzie of Tarbat to investi-gate Agnes Nein Donald Oig, Jonet Nein Donald Vic William Vic More,and Mary Nein Jon Vic Gilchrist at Scatwell in Ross-shire.47At Nairn inJune, Agnes Nic Ean Vane and Agnes McGillivorich confessed to witch-craft.48Another commission was granted in June 1662 to Hew Fraser ofBelladrum and others to try several witches, all with Gaelic names, inConveth parish, Inverness-shire.49In July, these prosecutions wereextended and a further list of suspects (including some of those alreadyaccused) was pooled from tenants living on the Chisholm lands ofStrathglass in what appears to have been a cruel scheme on behalf ofthe Chisholms to regain their lands – an early, and demonic, exampleof ‘clearance’. The suspects, who were part of a Maclean colony whohad occupied the lands for some two or 300 years, were ‘illegally andcruelly treated’ by Alexander Chisholm of Commer ‘having conceavitane inveterat hatred against the suplicants because he could not gettthem removed from their lands and possessions in the legall way’. Apetition by Sir Rory Mclean of Dowart against Chisholm was sadly toolittle, too late, for the women were ‘barbrouslie tortured ... by waking,hanging them up by the thombes, burning the soles of their feet at thefyre, drawing of others at horse taills and binding of them with widdiesabout the neck and feet and carrying them so alongst on horseback toprison, wherby and by other tortur one of them hath become dis-tracted, another by their cruelty is departed this lyfe, and all of themhave confest whatever they were pleasit to demand of them’.50Severalof the unfortunate victims allegedly died in prison and were never‘brought to confession’.51The possible overlap between Highland and Lowland witch beliefs isseen in the chance survival of what appears to be a series of precogni-tions relating to a particularly large witchcraft panic in Bute in 1662.At least twenty people were accused and, possibly, four or maybe fivewere executed on the orders of a commission granted by the privycouncil. There is a considerable amount of material so the followingLizanne Henderson1059780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 105"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"remarks will be highly selective.52Many of the suspects confessed toentering into a covenant with the Devil, who appeared to them invarious guises such as a ‘little brown dog’, a cat, a handsome youngman, a ‘black rough fierce man’, and as a ‘gross copperfaced man’; hebaptised them and gave them a new name. Many spoke of large gather-ings with the Devil and other witches, often around Halloween. Atthese ‘covens’, some of the witches told of a ‘young lasse’, calledMcillmartin, who had black hair, a broad face, and a merry disposition,who was ‘maiden’ at the meetings.53(This is reminiscent of the trial ofIsobel Goudie in Auldearn, also in 1662, who spoke of ‘the maiden’ asthe Devil’s favourite.54) The witches were blamed for different calami-ties including the death of children and horses by ‘shooting’55them,causing a cow to produce blood instead of milk, inflicting an illness ona man that simulated the pains of childbirth, and creating a storm atsea by casting a pebble into the water. One woman, who was breast-feeding, claimed that she had dreamed that one of the witches took aviolent bite out her breast; when she awoke her milk was gone and herbreast was blue where she had been nipped.56Another woman, whiledreaming, saw a suspected witch and when she awoke her child wasgravely ill. The mother implored the witch to heal her child but thewitch said that the child had been twice shot and nothing could bedone.57One of the more disturbing confessions was made by MargaretNcWilliam, who had lost her horse and cows and was in great povertywhen the Devil came to her and said, ‘be not afraid for you shall getrings enough’. However, what he wanted in return was NcWilliam’sseven-year-old son. She duly shot him with a fairy stone given her bythe Devil and the boy died instantly, ‘which grieved her most of any-thing that ever she did’. We will never know if NcWilliam actuallymurdered her own child or, in her grief, simply blamed herself for hisuntimely death. She was singled out in the records as one who ‘sincethe memory of any alive’ that knew her, ‘went under the name of awitch’. She had been accused of witchcraft, and imprisoned, in 1631,1645, 1649, and here once again in 1662. On this occasion her luck ranout for she was executed.58Some of the other women accused could cure certain illnesses withrituals, charms and herbs. Some of the rituals involved transference ofthe disease onto an animal, such as a cat. One woman had Gaeliccharms against the evil eye, as well as to heal children of the ‘Glaick’(bewitchment), which she could do, she said, ‘without suffering eithera dog or catt’.59Another woman could cure the fairy blast.60106Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 106"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The proximity of Bute to the mainland, especially the counties ofRenfrew and Ayrshire, perhaps allowed easier access to Lowland ideas.Some of the evidence from Bute could just as easily have been recordedin East Lothian, such as the high demonic content, the pact made withthe Devil, witches meeting in covens, or ‘pocks of witchcraft’ – pouchescontaining spells and charms. Can we detect a Gaelic element in theconfessions? Perhaps the stress on charming, the use of fairy and Gaelicspells, the importance of dreams, and the evil eye can be attributed tolocal belief, though much of this type of material can be found in theLowlands as well. What is perhaps of greater significance is that manyof the charms and spells were specifically stated to have been in Irish,that is, Gaelic. Jonat Mcneill allegedly used a deadly Gaelic charm againstJonat Man’s son, but Man did not understand the language, whichmade the securing of a counter-spell problematic.61Gaelic was used tocharm a calf, when applying ointment to sprains and bruises in humans,and to protect people from accidents or the evil eye. One such formulabegan ‘Obi er bhrachaadhetc’;62another was quoted as ‘er brid na bachilduinetc’.63An unusual case occurred in 1665. When Robert Douglas of Auchintul-loch,Loch Lomond, was accused of the accidental slaughter of WalterLindsay at the Boat of Bonhill, a ferry-crossing in the Vale of Leven,some highlanders alleged that he was ‘in a distraction bewitched’. Thesynod of Glasgow was merciful, accepting the witnesses’ evidence thatDouglas was ‘not in his naturall witts the tyme of the unhappieslauchter’ and it was well-known that, for several weeks beforehand, hewas ‘bewitched’.64In 1669, More Roy, More Nain Duy McIvers and Margaret NeinVayne were held at Castle Tioram in Inverness-shire on suspicion ofwitchcraft.65In the justiciary court records for Argyll is the trial of anative of the Appin region, Donald McIlmichall, in Inveraray in 1677.He was described as ‘a common vagabond’, and stood accused of steal-ing horses and cattle. He was further charged with ‘that horrid crymeof corresponding with the devill and consulting him anent stollengoods and getting informatione for discoverie thereof’.66He saw fairiesinside a hill, probably at Dalnasheen (the field of the fairy hill), and onthe island of Lismore. His case is of interest for several reasons. He wasa Gael, he was male, and he met with the fairies. It was the latterreason that would ensure a more serious charge of ‘consulting withevill spirits’ which led to his execution for witchcraft.67The impositionof ‘learned’ (and possibly Lowland) ideas upon local folkloric beliefsabout witchcraft, specifically the way fairies were demonised, is evidentLizanne Henderson1079780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"in this trial. Fairies showed up in other cases, such as that of JeanCampbell, investigated for charming by the Rothesay kirk session in1660 which reported that she ‘gangs with the faryes’.68In this instance,we can speculate that Campbell learned her charming skills from theelves.VIITravellers’ accounts are an important source of information, and oneof the best comes from Martin Martin. Although he was not parti-cularly interested in fairies or witches, he did draw a subtle, and per-haps unconscious, distinction between charming and witchcraft. Hereported that it was ‘a receiv’d opinion in these islands’ and ‘in theneighbouring part of the main land, that women by a charm ... areable to convey the increase of their neighbours cows milk to their ownuse’. The charmed milk did not produce ‘the ordinary quantity ofbutter; and the curds made of that milk are so tough, that it cannot bemade so firm as other cheese’.There is much of interest in this account. The crime is one specificallycommitted by women. And, these women are implicitly called ‘charm-ers’ as opposed to ‘witches’, a distinction not necessarily made withregard to this crime elsewhere in Scotland. The act of taking awaybreast-milk from nurses, however, was clearly recognised as an act ofwitchcraft, and not charming. Martin was present when an allegation ofthis type was made. He had seen four women who had presented them-selves as candidates for wet-nursing. After only three days of sucklingthe baby, the milk of the one who was chosen dried up. Another nursewas put in her place, but meanwhile, the first nurse’s milk returned toher, the effect, some thought, ‘of witchcraft by some of her neighbours’.If stealing milk was the preserve of women, interfering with the produc-tion of ale was apparently a male domain. Martin was told of charmerswho had the ‘art of taking away the increase of malt’ which resulted inan ale that lacked ‘life or good taste’.69Witches were apparently still rampant in Martin’s day. In 1698, thepresbytery of Tain heard complaints from their brethren in Sutherlandthat ‘the practice of witchcraft was common among their people, andthey therefore desire to know the Presbytery’s advice’. It was decidedthat in the parishes of Sutherland and Ross,where there is ground to believe that spells, charms, or any otherpractice of witchcraft are practised, the ministers of these parishes108Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"shall preach on that subject and set forth the sin of witchcraft, andall the practices relating thereto, and to take action against all suchwho are charged therewith according to the rules of the Church.70On the Black Isle, a warrant to examine the cases of three women inFortrose was granted in 1699.71Between 1699 and 1700, a commissionwas granted in Ross-shire to try 12 people for the ‘diabolical crimes andcharms of witchcraft’.72In 176, the privy council imposed the ‘extremepenalty’ upon two men for ‘witchcraft and malefice’ and they wereexecuted in Inverness.73The synod of Ross in 1737 legislated againstusing counter-charms, such as scoring the suspected witch’s forehead.74Three men appeared before the presbytery of Tain in 1750 for a seriesof attacks on women; they had dragged them from their beds and ‘castthem on the hard and cold floor, without allowing them any time toput on any of their clothes, except their shirts, using most horridcursing and imprecations, calling them witches and devils’. One of themen then ‘scored and cut their foreheads with an iron tool to the effu-sion of blood’.75All three men were rebuked before the congregationsat Rosskeen and Alness for their ‘grievous scandal’. One of the attack-ers, who blamed his consumption or tuberculosis on the witches,claimed that he was trying to recover his health.76The long persistenceof witchcraft cases in Tain might possibly be attributed to the town’ssituation on a frontier zone between Gaels and Lowlanders of the typethat Hugh Miller would later describe in Cromarty.77Many late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century travellers expectedto hear about the supernatural, since Scotland was regarded as a back-ward country preserving primitive cultures and superstitions. TheGàidhealtachdwas especially targeted in this regard. Lord Grange’sreport of 1724–5 to Viscount Townshend, secretary of state, observedthat the ‘barbarous’ Highlanders ‘are much addicted to a kind ofsorcery and charming; and it is commonly said that ... there are stillseveral among them who deall with familiar spirits’.78He may ofcourse have been feeding the preconceptions and prejudices of hispatron. Grange, after all, was the man who marooned his unfortunatewife on St Kilda.79Thomas Pennant was intrigued to discover, in 1769, that Perthshire‘still retains some of its ancient customs and superstitions’. He cameacross a variety of customs and beliefs, still very much alive, thoughwitchcraft, he thought, had died out in certain places. Of Perthshire heremarked, ‘the notion of witchcraft is quite lost: it was observed tocease almost immediately on the repeal of the witch act’.

As he progressed northwards, to Banffshire and Speyside, hediscovered that witch beliefs were not yet extinguished, ‘even in thiscultivated country’. Many were still bleeding supposed witches, forinstance. Pennant seemed puzzled to find witches more stronglyentrenched in the richer farmlands of the north-east than in thehardier landscapes of Breadalbane.80Robert Kirk, an episcopalian minister and well-respected Gaelicscholar from Balquhidder and Aberfoyle, was more interested inScotland’s fairy folk than in its witches when he wrote his The SecretCommon-Wealth(1691).81However, he did provide a couple of tantalis-ing clues regarding the nature of witch belief in late seventeenthcentury Perthshire. He commented on the ‘skilfull women’ who stolemilk, by way of a hair-tether, from their neighbours cows and ‘convey’dto their homes by secret pathes ... by art Magic’. The milk could becarried ‘as far off as a bull will be heard to roar’. The way to recover thestolen milk was ‘a bitter chyding of the suspected inchanters, chargingby a counter-charme to give them back their own, in God, or theirMasters name’.82Kirk, like Martin Martin, referred to such women notas witches but as ‘skilfull women’ or ‘inchanters’ – a subtle, yet impor-tant distinction.Kirk also referred to a woman from Colonsay, who had lived there atthe time of the Montrose wars in the 1640s. She was alleged to havesecond sight, which Kirk thought was unusual as, in his view, onlymen were so gifted. ‘Being asked who gave her such sights and warn-ings’ she revealed that ‘as soon as she sett three crosses of straw uponthe palm of her hand, a great ugly Beast sprang out of the earth, neerher and flew in the air’. If the answer to her question was positive ‘theBeast would descend calmly, and lick up the crosses’: otherwise itwould ‘furiously thurst her and the crosses over on the ground, and sovanish to his place’.83Again, Kirk did not specifically refer to thiswoman as a witch although she was seemingly involved in a diabolicalritual of some sort. Her powers were not ‘natural’; that is, she was notclaiming to be born with them, but rather acquired her secret know-ledge via the ‘beast’ who appeared during her ritual. Such claims werenot unusual in cases of witchcraft where suspects had been known toconfess that the fairies were responsible for any magical powers –including second sight – they might have had.84110Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Kirk said little about witches – he was, after all, writing on secondsight and fairy belief – but he did mention the devil’s mark and witch-pricking: the ‘damnable practise of evil angels, their sucking of bloodand spirits out of witches bodys (till they drein them, into a deformedand dry leanness) to feed their own vehicles withal, leaving what weecall the Witches mark behind’. Kirk regularly placed distinctive inter-pretations upon the evidence he gathered. It was ‘evil angels’, a moretheologically-sophisticated phrase to describe the more recognisabledemons or familiar spirits found elsewhere in Scotland, that sucked thelife-force out of witches, leaving them drained and withered. Kirk hadhimself seen the evidence: ‘a spot that I have seen as a smal molehorny and brown coloured, throw which mark, when a large brass pinwas thrust (both in buttock, nose and roof of mouth) till it bowed andbecame crooked; the witches, both men and women, neither felt apain, nor did bleed, nor knew the precise time when this was a doingto them (their eyes only being covered)’.85Unfortunately he did notsay when or where he saw this test of guilt being conducted.VIIIPeople in the rest of Scotland believed that Gaels were particularlyprone to witchcraft. Some of these Gaels, indeed, resided in theLowlands. One of the witches executed for her part in the affair atNorth Berwick kirk was known as ‘Ersche Marioun’, that is, Irish orGaelic-speaking.86Catherine MacTargett, an East Lothian witch of 1688,described her initiation into the diabolic arts but made no mention ofthe more exotic details found in some confessions.87There were no wildparties or sex with the Devil, and no flying through the air to covens.However, MacTargett maintained that she entered the service of theDevil through the instruction of a Highland woman called MargaretMcLain who bade her to renounce her baptism. That a woman fromDunbar should have claimed to have learned her art from a Highlanderis perhaps more revealing than if she had declared the Devil had taughther, for many Lowlanders would have had a poor view of Gaels at thetime. A witch in Galloway in the mid-eighteenth century was accusedof stealing butter and sucking milk from cows in the shape of a hare.She was said to have muttered her incantations in Gaelic, a languagewhich had died out in the area probably by the sixteenth century.88The incident in Paisley (1696–7) involving the bewitchment of 11-year-old Christian Shaw included Highland suspects. The episodebegan when Christian accused one of the maids in the house of stealingLizanne Henderson1119780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"milk. The thieving maid was a Highlander named Katherine Campbell,who, it is said, was ‘of a proud and revengeful temper, and muchaddicted to cursing and swearing’, and in a rage did say to Christian,‘The Devil harle [i.e. drag] your soul through hell’. Very soon after,Christian’s seizures began and she accused Campbell as one of her tormentors. During the time of Christian’s bewitchment, ‘there camean old Highland fellow to Bargarran, who, calling himself a weary traveller’, was brought into the kitchen to receive alms. In another partof the house, Christian began to exhibit the signs of demonic posses-sion and her mother brought her down to the kitchen, asking the‘Highland fellow’ to take her daughter’s hand, which he did; ‘the girlimmediately upon his touch was grievously tormented in all the partsof her body’.89This is just a small sample, but it can be seen thatHighlanders as practising witches are to be found in Lowland witchcases, thus broadening the scope of enquiry. Such accounts may wellhave reinforced the idea among Lowlanders that witches were morenumerous in the Highlands than elsewhere.IXIt is generally assumed that witch belief survived much longer in theGàidhealtachdthan elsewhere. There are indeed late references to witches,such as in Skye in 1880 where members of the Free Kirk at Uig peti-tioned against a mother and daughter who ‘by evil arts take the milkfrom the neighbours’ cows’, but some of my own research suggests sim-ilarly late evidence in Lowland Scotland, again in the south-west.90There are many wonderful stories of witches in the oral tradition.Hugh Miller of Cromarty’s account of a witch by the name of StineBheag o’ Tarbat (Sheena Veg) related to events in 1738, orally commu-nicated to Miller who published the story in 1835. Stine Bheag, whomuttered her spells in Gaelic, was ‘much consulted by seafaring men’as she could control the winds.91The English engineer Edmund Burt,based in Inverness from the late 1720s to the late 1730s, commentedupon the widespread acceptance of witchcraft that he encountered inthe Highlands. Burt had an argument with a local laird and a ministeron the topic; in an effort to persuade the sceptical Burt of the reality ofwitchcraft, the minister related a story he felt sure would convincehim. A ‘certain Highland laird’ discovered that some of his wine wasbeing stolen. The servants were cleared of any blame, and so witchcraftwas suspected. Late one night, the laird went to his cellar ‘at an hourwhen he thought it might be watering-time with the hags’, and under112Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"cloak of darkness, sprang into the room swinging his broadsword toand fro until he was sure he had hit one of the culprits. In the darknesshe could make out the eyes of several cats, but when he lit a candlethey had vanished, leaving nothing but some blood on the floor. Thelaird immediately went to the house of a reputed witch, an old womanwho lived some two miles away. Inside her hut, he found her in bed,bleeding effusively and ‘casting his eye under the bed, there lay her legin its natural form!’ Much to the puzzlement of the minister, Burt wasfar from persuaded by the story and continued to express his disbelief.His host turned to the minister and said, ‘Sir, you must no mind Mr. Burt, for he is an atheist’.92XThis brief survey suggests that the richness of traditions aboutHighland witches in folklore is matched by the survival of a surprisingamount of information in the historical record. The number of perse-cutions certainly seems larger than is often assumed, while the numberof executions, though indeterminate, is not insignificant. Evidence of Highland witches and witch beliefs surfacing in non-Highland contexts, if considered, may well boost the numbers even further.When compared with other parts of Scotland, it is hard to find any-thing particularly unique or distinctive about Gaelic witch beliefs.There was, perhaps, greater emphasis given to second sight, the sig-nificance of dreams, and the power of the evil eye, although these canalso be found in non-Gaelic contexts. J. G. Campbell’s comment thatHighland witches were less ‘repulsive’ than their ‘southern sisters’, lesslikely to engage in demonic pacts, attend sabbats or raise the dead, is tosome extent true though there are plenty of examples where Lowlandwitches were equally uninvolved or uninterested in the demonic sideof witchcraft. As elsewhere in Scotland, Gaelic witches might speakwith the fairies, transform into cats, or murder children, but they weremore often blamed for stealing milk, charming cattle, or foreseeing thefuture.Janet Horne from Sutherland may have been the last to suffer thepain, terror and ignominy of a brutal execution, but many had per-ished before her. Witch persecution in Gaelic-speaking Scotland is farfrom a blank canvas, and I, for one, think it is time to fill in at leastsome of the blanks – which in fact are less numerous than commenta-tors such as Truckell or Larner assumed – and finally give properacknowledgement to all those who lost their lives.Lizanne Henderson1139780230_507883_06_cha04.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Notes1 E.

Scholars generallyagree that early modern Scotland was gripped by five national witch-craft panics in 1590–1, 1597, 1629–30, 1649–50 and 1661–2; and thatthese ‘panics’ were part of a larger, European witch-hunt that Scotlandjoined in its second wave.1These national peaks were primarilyidentified quantitatively by counting the number of recorded witch-craft suspects accused annually in Scotland, but qualitative sourceswere also used to estimate the numbers of accusations made in the1590s.2The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, completed in 2003, confirmsthe general pattern of peaks and troughs in annual rates of witchcraftprosecution in Scotland and identifies a few additional peaks.3Thepattern is so well established that it opens and frames nearly everyrecent article about Scottish witchcraft, including my own and severalchapters in this volume.4The general chronological pattern of nationalwitchcraft prosecution in Scotland, therefore, is not in question. Butwhat does this pattern mean? Is it the most illuminating way to framewitchcraft accusation and prosecution? How is our understanding ofwitchcraft belief shaped (and possibly constrained) by this perspective?Are there other possible models for thinking about patterns of witch-craft prosecution?IIn this chapter I want to re-evaluate the common assumption that thepeaks in accusation displayed in this well-established chronologicalpattern are indicative of so-called national ‘witch-hunts’ or national‘witchcraft panics’.

I believe that a‘suspect-based’ model, described in detail below, is at the heart of ourreliance on chronological patterns of witchcraft prosecution forframing our understanding of witchcraft belief.5Instead, a focus on theexperiences of witch-accusing communities rather than on witchcraftaccusations and suspects illuminates the full breadth and scope ofwitchcraft prosecution.6In the process, the usefulness of the conceptsof ‘hunt’ and ‘panic’ for understanding witchcraft accusation and prosecution will also be assessed.This shift in model has the potential to reveal more about how,where, when and why witchcraft prosecutions affected the lives ofearly modern Scots than a suspect-based analysis. I suggest that mostpeople touched by witchcraft accusations and prosecutions – the hun-dreds of neighbours, friends, associates, victims and investigators of awitchcraft suspect diffused throughout the suspect’s social and eco-nomic life – were involved only in one or two prosecutions evenduring the so-called ‘panic’ years. From the point of view of witch-accusing communities the prosecution of large numbers of suspectswas uncommon. In some instances investigators, prosecutors andothers clearly sought and found multiple suspects and sometimes communities joined those efforts. While at least half of all witchcraftsuspects were prosecuted during years labelled as ‘panic’ years, a focuson witch-accusing communities suggests that the phenomenon oflarge-scale serial witch hunts was not the way that most people experi-enced witchcraft prosecutions. Witchcraft as seen from the perspective of witch-accusing commun-ities brings the cultural and social dimension of witchcraft prosecutionto the fore. The conceptual shift suggested here is not simply a changein the object of study from witchcraft suspects to witch-accusing com-munities; it is also a change in focus from witch-hunting and witch-hunters to the processes of witchcraft belief and experience.I want to be clear from the outset how the term ‘belief’ is used in thischapter. From my reading of witchcraft documents ‘witchcraft beliefs’were not a set of predetermined ideas or a static symbolic system fromwhich people drew meaning and oriented their actions. Belief is part ofhow people live, not just about what they think. Witchcraft beliefsemerged from specific concrete material and social contexts andactions. Rather than forming coherent, static and agreed ‘meanings’,witchcraft beliefs were formed through agreed ways in which certainwords and actions were understood as constituting the stuff of120Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"witchcraft such as malefice or demonic relationships.7Scrutiny of theconceptual models and language we use to understand witchcraft pros-ecutions gets to the heart of how we, in the twenty-first century,understand early modern witchcraft beliefs and the experiences ofwitchcraft prosecution in everyday life. This chapter is as much aboutunpacking our modern beliefs about witchcraft as it is about earlymodern beliefs and experiences of witchcraft.IIDescribing the annual rates of witchcraft prosecution in Scotland,Christina Larner wrote, ‘There were considerable fluctuations in theannual rate of prosecution. There were lulls in which there were almostno cases, there were periods in which there was a regular small supplyand there were five peaks of intensive prosecution.’8Most scholarshave gleaned from this pattern that the annual peaks in the number ofsuspects represent what have been called national ‘witch-hunts’ orwitchcraft ‘panics’, reflecting and contributing to a broad and diverseliterature on European witchcraft prosecutions that has developedsince the 1950s.9Before getting into evidence and the numbers behind the chronolog-ical patterns of witchcraft prosecution in early modern Scotland, Iwant to clarify my use of, and apprehensions about, the terms ‘hunt’and ‘panic’ as applied to witchcraft investigation and prosecution. A‘hunt’ for a witch or witches implies that people, whether prosecutors,investigators or neighbours, actively sought to find a culprit (or cul-prits) for perceived crimes whether magical harm or pact-making withthe Devil. In a search (or hunt) for accomplices to known witchcraftsuspects, in some instances the crime was constituted by the investiga-tion. This was especially true when a suspect with no previous reputa-tion for witchcraft was named, interrogated, tortured or forced toconfess.Once a suspect or suspects have been identified, I believe the terms‘investigation’ and ‘prosecution’ perhaps more accurately reflect theactivities usually involved with gathering evidence and conducting thetrial than the term ‘hunt’. This reserves the term ‘hunt’ for the initialsearch for suspects and those instances of investigation and prosecu-tion that created an ever-expanding pool of witchcraft suspects usingextraordinary measures, such as torture or sleep deprivation, until pros-ecutions were barred or available suspects were burned out. In theseinstances (though I argue below that they were less common thanLauren Martin1219780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"previously thought), the term ‘witch-hunt’ can be useful to differenti-ate between empirically different degrees in the practices of prosecu-tion. While the phrase ‘witch-hunt’ may call to mind its modern usage,implying that the crimes and culprits of witchcraft were not ‘real’, Ibelieve it is a useful historical term.‘Witchcraft panic’ is a slippery term that implies both a state of mind(panic or craze) and a set of investigative and prosecutorial practices(witch-hunting). People could panic about witches without everseeking specific suspects, they could engage in witch-hunting withoutpanicking and they could fail to find or prosecute suspects. Earlymodern people may well have panicked about witches during somelocal and regional instances of large-scale witchcraft prosecutions.While recognising the contribution of important scholarship aboutwitchcraft panics, I prefer not to use the term ‘panic’ when referring tothe practices of hunting, investigating and prosecuting witchcraft suspects. The dual connotations of the term ‘panic’ cause its meaningto be unstable and shifting. Further, the state of mind aspect of ‘panic’can put pejorative connotations of irrationality onto early modernlegal practices.10My proposed terminological shift folds the practicesassociated with many scholarly uses of term ‘panic’ into the term‘hunt’, reserving ‘panic’ for the state of mind not the practices ofwitchcraft prosecution.With terminological caveats aside, what is the evidence behind thewell-established chronological pattern of witchcraft prosecution andwhat does it mean? Christina Larner was the first scholar to establishthe numbers, chronology and geography of witchcraft prosecution inScotland.A Source-Book of Scottish Witchcraft, compiled by herself,Christopher Hyde Lee and Hugh V. McLachlan in 1977, identifiedapproximately 3,000 people accused of witchcraft, putting to an endsome of the more exaggerated claims of the numbers prosecuted forwitchcraft in Scotland. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, using addi-tional sources and more modern database technology, has identifiedjust under 4,000 witchcraft suspects.11As stated in the introduction, the chronology of witchcraft prosecu-tion in early modern Scotland is well established. Larner representedthis chronological pattern in a graph called ‘Approximate Number ofCases (Processes and Trials) 1560–1730’.12However, Larner’s graph hasa few inconsistencies. First, the peaks of 1591 and 1597 are somewhatspeculative, although Julian Goodare has filled in some of the docu-mentary gaps with qualitative and anecdotal evidence.13Second, someof the national panics identified by Larner lasted for one year while122Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 122"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"others were made up of two consecutive annual peaks. But otherwiseher graph seems quite straightforward.14A similar visual representationof witchcraft accusations and prosecutions in Scotland, created withthe more complete data collected for the Survey, has been provided inChapter 2 above, Figure 2.1, ‘Number of accused witches per year,1561–1736’.Figure 2.1 suggests that yearly peaks in accusation (which weredefined as 50+ per year) occurred 14 times, although some of these 14 years were consecutive. The ‘national panics’ identified by Larnerand others incorporated only eight years. The Survey did not make anyestimates of cases to account for possible missing sources, so the peaksin 1590–1 and 1597 look much smaller than in Larner’s graph and1590 does not even register as a peak year. But 1628, 1643, 1644, 1650,1658, 1659 and 1679 all saw more than 50 accusations. The Survey’sdata also changed the relative size of some of the peaks from Larner’soriginal graph. In Larner’s graph, accusations and prosecutions in 1661and 1662 far exceed earlier years. With the addition of church sources,the 1649 peak (with 367 accused) looks more comparable to the largepeaks in 1661 and 1662.The way of counting suspects represented in graphing the number of‘accusations per year’, both Larner’s and the Survey’s, has some flawsand complications. First, it is not always clear exactly what phenom-enon or event is being measured ‘per year’. Larner’s Source-Bookcountedaccusations of witchcraft, but some suspects were accused of witchcraftmore than once. The Survey allowed for this, and its graph displays thelast known date for each suspect. Any given person accused of witch-craft had many possible dated events potentially connected with theircase, including: the initial accusation to a local authority; interroga-tions, confessions and witness depositions; issue of a commission for alocal trial; the trial; and the execution. In most cases only a fragmentof the documents associated with these events has survived. Thus anyattempt to graph accusations per year will be based on a jumble of non-comparable dates corresponding to different moments in the possible trajectory of a witchcraft accusation. Second, ‘accusations per year’ graphs count two phenomena: people accused of witchcraftbut never tried, and people who were brought to trial for witchcraft.Third, these graphs disguise the long and deep local history of witch-craft accusations. While the last known date of a case may have beenin 1662, investigators and local victims could have been pursuing thesuspect for ten years – leaving nine years of witchcraft investigationactivity uncounted.

Fourth, it doesnot tell us whether a peak year represents a cluster of accusations inone locale or accusations that were evenly distributed across Scotland.This problem will be explored in more depth below when the evidencefor national panics is explored.The fifth and final problem with the ‘accusations per year’ graph isthat it is skewed by the huge number of witchcraft suspects from theLothians, Haddington (East Lothian) in particular.15The Lothians con-tributed one-third of all people accused of witchcraft in Scotlandalthough only 11 per cent of the Scottish population lived there (seeTables 5.1 and 5.2). Only eight out of the 34 Scottish counties had ahigher proportion of witchcraft suspects than the general population.16Haddington was by far the most extreme county, with 18 per cent of124Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern ScotlandTable 5.1Number of Suspects by Region and County*Lothian  1,028Tayside192Edinburgh371Forfar82Haddington543Perth110Linlithgow114Highland191Strathclyde438Cromarty2Argyll6Inverness45Ayr153Nairn55Bute54Ross74Dunbarton25Sutherland15Lanark77Renfrew123Far North149Caithness52Fife382Orkney71Fife375Shetland26Kinross7DumfriesEast Borders297and Galloway127Berwick126Dumfries77Peebles90Kirkcudbright35Roxburgh60Wigtown15Selkirk21Central  71Grampian211Clackmannan18Aberdeen174Stirling53Banff9Elgin26TOTAL3086Kincardine2*Data in all tables from the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft.9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Scottish witchcraft suspects and only 2 per cent of the Scottish popula-tion.

The ‘national’chronology of witchcraft accusations is virtually the same as the Lothians’regional chronology of accusations. Each of the nine other groups ofcounties displays its own unique chronological patterns of accusation. Inmany ways, the so-called ‘national’ chronological pattern of witchcraftprosecution is really the Lothians’ pattern writ large.Counting suspects necessitates the construction of a boundaryaround which witches to count. The use of boundaries may seemobvious, justified and neutral. But there is a self-fulfilling quality toboundaries – if we look for national patterns, such as in a graph dis-playing annual accusations per year in Scotland, all the patterns thatare found look ‘national’. The same is true for a regional or localboundary.18While obviously the drawing of boundaries of some kindis necessary, it is important to recognise that the boundaries we chooseare boundaries that have been chosen, not given.IIIGiven the difficulties with counting accusations per year and problemswith the term ‘panic’, where does this leave the notion that annualLauren Martin125Table 5.2Intensity of Prosecution by Region(suspect : population)Region% Suspects% PopulationIntensityLothians  33113.0Fife1271.7East Borders961.5Far North551.0Strathclyde14200.7Dumfries and Galloway460.7Central240.5Highland6110.5Grampian7160.4Tayside6150.4Population percentages calculated from a 1755 census tabulated in J.

Giventhat definition, how ‘national’ were the various peaks in annual witch-craft accusations? And were they panics?Witchcraft prosecution in Scotland broadly defined was a nationalphenomenon; witchcraft suspects were accused in every part ofScotland. But such a broad interpretation of ‘national’ does not help usassess whether the term ‘national witchcraft panic’ is accurate for theperiodic increases in witchcraft accusations in Scotland. A more mean-ingful measure of whether peaks were national witchcraft panics wouldlook at the geographical distribution of witchcraft accusations in eachpeak year.The Survey records detailed information about the residence ofwitchcraft suspects when known. The most reliable information is thecounty of residence, which is known for 96 per cent of named witch-craft suspects. Table 5.3, ‘Regional Involvement during Peak Years’,shows that most peak years were dominated by one or two regions(such as Lothian in the south-east Lowlands, in 1591, 1628, 1644,1659, 1661 and 1679; Grampian in the north-east, in 1597; and Fife inmid-east, in 1643). The cases not from the dominant region in anygiven peak year were distributed between an average of seven otherregions. Thus assessment of the regional distribution of cases suggeststhat most of the witchcraft prosecution activity in peak years wasregionalised, that is centred in one or two regions.Witchcraft prosecutions in the peak year of 1662 provide a goodexample of how a ‘national’ focus can mask a variety of regional phe-nomena.19The Survey found 402 cases whose end date was in 1662,the largest-ever number. The geographical distribution of cases in 1662was, arguably, the most national of any peak year. Witchcraft caseswere documented from eight regions in Scotland – all except Dumfriesand Galloway and the Far North. Further, as Table 5.3 shows, fourregions contributed a significant number of cases, with no one regionclearly dominating. If ever there was a national panic in Scotland,there was one in 1662.The Lothians contributed the largest number of suspects, and nearlyall of them (plus a few from neighbouring regions) can be traced backto one boy, James Welch.20That means that over one-quarter of thecases in 1662 derived from one massive serial witchcraft prosecutioncentred in East Lothian.The Highlands, Strathclyde and Tayside regions, areas usually outsidethe main witch-accusing locales, named an unusually high number ofsuspects in 1662.

The Tayside pattern of accusationswas different from the other dominant regions. There appears to havebeen a general low-level increase in prosecutions in many parishesacross the Tayside region, with only one large group from Fossowayand Tullibole (see Table 5.6, ‘Breakdown of Tayside Region Cases in1662’).The rest of the 1662 cases came from eight other counties spreadacross four regions. Table 5.7, ‘Breakdown of all other counties withcases in 1662’, shows that Berwick, Fife and to some extent Roxburghhad accusation patterns similar to Tayside – small clusters of cases frommany parishes. The remaining counties had only a handful of cases.While the 1662 peak certainly was national, it contained a wide varietyof types of prosecution, not all of them deserving the label ‘panic’.128Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern ScotlandTable 5.4Breakdown of Highland Region Cases in 1662Highland RegionCountyParish No. of SuspectsCromartyUnknown2InvernessDyke2Contin2Inverness1Kiltarlity and Convinth12Unknown17NairnAuldearn43Nairn2Elgin1Unknown5RossContin1Tain1Sutherlandnone0Total899780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The clustering of witchcraft accusations (both small-scale prosecu-tions and serial witch-hunts) in certain years, such as in 1662, suggeststhat there were aspects of witchcraft prosecution outside local inclina-tion.

On the contrary, it is a necessary first step forunderstanding witchcraft prosecutions. However, the conclusionsdrawn from counting accusations per year can be misleading. Whenwitchcraft suspects are singled out for counting they are divorced fromthe contexts and trajectories in which they were accused. The body ofthe witchcraft suspect becomes the focus of analysis rather than allthose other non-witch people who made the accusation, participatedin the investigation and prosecution or simply stood back andwatched. Further, searching for spectacular ‘hunts’ and ‘panics’ createsa distorted picture because it skews our understanding of witchcraftbelief towards the more conspiratorial, often elite-based, aspects ofdemonic witchcraft. This misses many of the more obvious and mundaneaspects of witchcraft prosecution and belief that emerged in and throughlocal community relationships that are explored below.28IV‘Accusations per year’ and national panics are not the only ways scholarshave conceptualised witchcraft within the broad outlines of a suspect-focused model; they have also looked at serial witch-hunts. Scholars havealso examined the numbers of linked suspects in specific instances ofwitchcraft prosecution as a way of measuring the intensity, quality andimpact of the experience.29In these instances witchcraft suspects wereusually intertwined through the processes of denunciation, confronta-tion, or direct suggestion and questioning by an investigator. ‘Suspect-counting’ of this kind looks for groups of accusations per year, tracesthem to their source whether it was a settlement, parish, presbytery orcounty, and identifies witch-hunters in common.It will never be possible to reconstruct all the links between cases, asmany documents have not survived. And of course some cases may havebeen linked in a more diffuse way, such as through the spread of the ideaof witchcraft prosecution or a generalised fear of witches. These types ofconnections of mentality are very difficult to document and did not nec-essarily lead directly to witchcraft prosecution. But the Witchcraft Surveyhelps to identify serial witch-hunts. The database records detailed in-formation about a suspect’s place of residence (when known) and names of investigators. Cases from the same place, or prosecuted by the samepeople, can be identified. Witch-accusing parishes can be mapped,Lauren Martin1319780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"displaying instances where witchcraft investigations were confined to ormoved over parish, presbytery or county boundaries.30And suspects fromwithin the same presbytery or linked across parishes can be counted.Identifying and counting all the serial witch-hunts that took place inScotland is well beyond the scope of this chapter. However, by count-ing the number of suspects per year per parish (when known), a roughindication of the number of suspects involved in a specific instance ofwitchcraft prosecution can be approximated. Just under 49 per cent of accused witches were accused in a group of 6 or more people fromone parish per year, 21 per cent of witchcraft suspects were accused ina group of 3–5 other people and 35 per cent were accused either aloneor with only one other person.31The largest group we know about was43 people accused of witchcraft in Auldearn in 1662. Thus if we arelooking at witchcraft prosecution from the point of view of groups ofwitchcraft suspects, 70 per cent of suspects were accused as part of agroup large enough to indicate a probable serial witch hunt. Groups ofwitchcraft suspects from the same parish and year are more prominentduring the peak years. This seemsto suggest that in Scotland the language of ‘hunts’ and ‘panics’, if restricted to a description of local orregional witchcraft prosecution activities, may be an accurate reflectionof how Scotland experienced witchcraft prosecutions.However, this perspective may be misleading. While our estimate oflinked suspects (arrived at through the shorthand of counting parish clus-ters of suspects) tells us much about the experience of accused witches, itdoes not tell us about the general experience of witchcraft prosecutionand belief in Scotland. When witchcraft prosecutions are examined fromthe perspective of the accused witch, groups of linked suspects skew thefigures. One local peak of 43 witchcraft suspects from Auldearn representsa very intense experience in one time and place. By contrast, 43 witch-craft suspects accused, one at a time, in 43 different parishes represent amore widespread and less intense experience of witchcraft prosecution for those non-witchcraft suspect people touched by the accusation andprosecution. Witchcraft prosecution affected more people than just thesuspects and the trial participants. The grounds for and substance of accu-sations intertwined throughout people’s everyday relationships and strug-gles.32Yet when we base our understanding of witchcraft prosecution oncounting accused witches, the one extreme experience in Auldearn mas-querades as representing half of how witchcraft prosecutions happened inScotland. I believe that this data skewing is a paradigm problem inherentin the idea that counting witches is the same as understanding witchcraftprosecution. This is not to suggest that large-scale prosecutions should132Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"not be studied. Rather, it suggests that large-scale prosecutions do notdefine the experience of witchcraft and its prosecution in early modernScotland.The suspect-counting model – relying on accusations per year, linkedsuspects, and the idea of national panic – draws attention towards witch-craft accusation episodes with large numbers of suspects. And it assumesthat the numbers of witchcraft suspects accurately reflects the experienceof witchcraft prosecution. What about episodes where very few peoplewere accused? The accused witch was only one of anywhere near a hun-dred people involved in the prosecution of a witch, including victims,witnesses, bystanders, investigators, prosecutors, the jury and other offi-cials. Too close a focus on witchcraft suspects elides the ways witchcraftmay have been a more diffused part of early modern daily life.Counting suspects and locating instances of serial witch-hunting is not inherently wrong or somehow incorrect. The model has offeredmany insights into early modern witchcraft. It gauges the experiences ofaccused witches, identifies years of greater interest in witchcraft prosecu-tion, and has led to some profound insights about European history. Thedifficult and painful experiences of early modern women and menaccused of witchcraft have been brought to light, as have the actions ofsome investigators and accusers. We have a greater understanding of thekinds of legal apparatus and the changes in legal regulations that openedthe way for the many judicial and prosecutorial abuses that occurredduring witchcraft prosecutions. Several micro-studies of peak years haverevealed a wealth of information about the legal, social and politicalunderpinnings of Scottish witchcraft prosecution.33But do witchcraft suspects, counted as free-floating objects detachedfrom the contexts in which they were accused, tell us the whole storyabout witchcraft prosecution or witchcraft belief in Scotland? Tounderstand the impact of witchcraft prosecution on early modernScotland and its relationship to witchcraft belief, surely we also need totake account of all the non-witchcraft suspect people who were inti-mately involved in prosecutions. This requires a shift away from theaggregate numbers of accused witches and towards a broad view of thelocal sceneof witchcraft accusation, investigation and prosecution.VWhat does witchcraft prosecution in Scotland look like if exploredfrom the perspective of witch-accusing communities, rather than fromthe experience of suspects or through counting suspects?34The SurveyLauren Martin1339780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"found that for roughly 65 per cent of the parishes in Scotland there isno evidence of formal witchcraft prosecution activity between 1563and 1736.35Thus the majority of parishes did not experience a witch-craft prosecution at first hand – although belief in and fear of witcheswas surely prevalent throughout Scotland. Witchcraft prosecutiondirectly involved only a little over one-third of Scottish parishes.In what follows I isolate and analyse the one-third of parishesinvolved in witchcraft prosecution in Scotland. Total figures for allScottish parishes are provided in the reference notes. To what degreewere the witch-accusing parishes involved in witchcraft prosecutions?Did most of them produce or participate in serial witch-hunts? Thereare two ways to measure parish witchcraft prosecution intensity: thenumber of years in which a parish made accusations, and the numberof suspects that a parish accused at a time.36Table 5.8, ‘Number of parish accusation episodes per witch-accusingparish per year’, shows that while a few parishes did repeatedly accusepeople of witchcraft, most witch-accusing parishes (75 per cent)accused a parishioner of witchcraft in only one or two years.37Only2 per cent of witch-accusing parishes accused someone of witchcraft inmore than ten years. The most frequently repeating parish was Ayr,134Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern ScotlandTable 5.8Number of Parish Accusation Episodes Per Witch-Accusing ParishPer YearNo. of YearsNo. of Parishes% of Parishes1  19854%27721%333 9%422 6%511 3%682%762%851%921%1010%1121%1221%1300%1400%1500%1610%Total3689780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"where at least one person was accused of witchcraft in 16 separateyears. Even this seems sporadic given that the witchcraft was a capitalcrime for 173 years.It is more complicated to gauge the number of suspects each ‘witch-accusing’ parish accused at a time. It is necessary, first, to categorise thesize of each witchcraft accusation episode per parish per year. Then theepisodes can be compared to determine the frequency of serial witch-hunts. Table 5.9, ‘Number of suspects accused in parish accusationepisodes per year’, shows that the proportion of witchcraft accusationepisodes involving large numbers of suspects was small.38The most common parish experience, at 75 per cent, was to accuseonly one or two people at a time. This probably includes a combina-tion of individual, neighbourhood witchcraft prosecutions and someripple effect from prosecutions elsewhere. But the point is that in mostparishes the people around a witchcraft suspect either did not seek orwere unable to find more suspects. In around 25 per cent of parish episodes three or more people wereaccused, indicating possible serial witch-hunts. Parishes that accused asmall group of three to five suspects in one year (14%) probably doesrepresent a small serial witch-hunt, involving some degree of inquisito-rial pressure that led to further denunciations. The 11 per cent ofparish episodes where six or more people were accused of witchcraft ina year are the kinds of prosecutions I think people have in mind withthe label ‘panic’. These episodes probably involved the use of extraor-dinary prosecutorial measures involved in a witch ‘hunt’ and themental state of panic; and people without previous witchcraft reputa-tions were probably denounced and prosecuted. Again, for the pur-poses of understanding the practicesof witchcraft investigation andprosecution and their effect on early modern communities I wouldadvocate use of the term ‘hunt’.While, as Larner suggested, the difference within this range is proba-bly one of degree rather than kind, further subdivision of this categoryhelps clarify the intensity of prosecution. Table 5.8 shows that only aLauren Martin135Table 5.9Number of Suspects Accused in Parish Accusation Episodes Per Year1 to 2 suspects75% of accusation episodes3 to 5 suspects14% of accusation episodes6 to 10 suspects7% of accusation episodes11 to 20 suspects3% of accusation episodes21+ suspects1% of accusation episodes9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"very small number of parishes accused more than 11 people in anygiven year. While such accusations are rare, nearly every region inScotland had at least one parish that conducted one at least oncebetween 1563 and 1736. So this phenomenon was thinly distributedacross Scotland.Witchcraft prosecution looks very different when seen from the per-spective of the witch-accusing parish rather than from the aggregatenumber of suspects. While a few parishes clearly engaged in serialwitch-hunts accusing large numbers of people at a time, most parishesdid not. What does the chronology of Scottish witchcraft prosecutionslook like when seen from the perspective of parish involvement?Interestingly, the peaks look roughly the same as the chronology of suspects. See Figure 5.1, ‘Number of Witch-accusing Parishes,1563–1736’. The largest number of parishes involved in a witchcraftprosecution in any given year was 70 out of 861 parishes in Scotland.In any given year, most parishes did not formally accuse anyone ofwitchcraft.Like Figure 2.1, showing the number of suspects per year, the peaksin Figure 5.1 display several phenomena at the same time.

Peak yearscontain increases in two types of phenomena: more parishes accusedone or two suspects; and some parishes accused three or more suspectsin that same year. A small proportion accused more than 11 suspects. The suspect-counting model suggests that panics and hunts, wherelarge numbers of witchcraft suspects were accused at the same time,was the normal or dominant pattern of witchcraft prosecution inScotland. A shift in paradigm to a model that puts the witch-accusingcommunity (represented here by the parish of residence of accusedwitches) at the centre of the analysis presents a very different picture ofthe way Scottish witchcraft suspects were prosecuted. Three-quarters of witch-accusing parishes accused only one or two people, only onceor twice, during the 173 years in which witchcraft was a capital crime.While both models count, they count different things. The commu-nity experience model, focusing on individual local episodes, countscommunities not just accused witches. A paradigm that highlights theexperiences of witchcraft suspects and witchcraft prosecutors drawsattention to large serial witch-hunts and instances of intense prosecu-tion. From this perspective, annual peaks in accusation represent witch-craft panics. However, from the perspective of community experience,witchcraft prosecutions tended to focus on only one or two suspects ata time, with serial witch trials a rarer occurrence.

I will return to the importance of this distinctionfor how we understand witchcraft belief(rather than accusation andprosecution) in a moment.The pattern of periodic annual peaks in witchcraft suspects andwitch-accusing parishes emerges within both the suspect-based andwitch-accusing community models. We still have to ask why moreparishes decided to accuse witchcraft suspects in some years but notothers. The change of model does not negate the necessity of exploringtrends. Rather it focuses our analysis on a different object, the commu-nity rather than the suspect, allowing for more targeted questions to beasked about witchcraft investigation and prosecution that incorporateall the people and processes involved. Further, it helps us avoid theassumption that witchcraft prosecution was accomplished throughpanic and that therefore the Devil-based, conspiratorial witchcraftbeliefs were somehow more important than the everyday experiencesof malefice.If we want to know why witches were prosecuted, then we need tounderstand the communities that accused them and the conditionsand contexts for those accusations. Part of this, of course, implies thenecessity of understanding the pressures surrounding and bindingcommunities. But it is not enough to look at witch-hunting or theactivities of investigators and prosecutors who were most active duringa serial witch-hunt. This only gets at a quarter of witch-accusing com-munities and presumably only a quarter of the neighbours affected byand involved in witchcraft investigation and prosecution. To under-stand the peak years we need to understand why more parishesdecided to accuse a few suspects in that year and why some decided tohunt for multiple suspects.VIWith a suspect-based model, serial witch-hunting appears to be thenorm; to focus our research efforts on hunts and panics thus seemsappropriate. With the witch-accusing community model, on the otherhand, large serial witch-hunts seem to be unusual events in the contextof witchcraft prosecution. Most accusations, even during peak years,were made one at a time in separate parishes. The Survey databasecannot identify those instances where the idea of investigating a sus-pected witch may have spread from somewhere else. But the point isthat most parishes in Scotland, once they investigated a witchcraft138Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 138"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"suspect or turned a suspect over to a higher authority, did not continueto produce more suspects. I believe that this finding shifts the premisesthrough which we pursue our understanding of early modern witch-craft belief. Most Scottish parishes – neighbours, elders, church officialsand local magistrates – were not prone to panic about witches. Thissuggests that the conspiratorial aspects of witchcraft belief prevalent inlearned treatises and used as the rationale for sleep deprivation andother forms of torture to elicit accomplices were not necessarily thedominant understanding of witchcraft in Scotland.39This does not mean that it is invalid to chart the numbers of sus-pects, that large groups of suspects were never prosecuted together, orthat there was no regional (or even national) co-ordination of witch-craft prosecutions. Rather, I want to suggest that these ideas do notnecessarily reflect the general pattern of how witches were prosecutedin early modern Scotland. An over-reliance on suspect-counting andnational panics glosses over the complicated ways that people in somecommunities came to find a witch in their midst.The pattern of accusation, with often far-flung parishes making formalaccusations in the same year, survives the shift from suspect to com-munity focus. The annual peaks in accusation were a combination ofdifferent types of community experiences of witchcraft – mostly investi-gation and prosecution of one or two neighbours. A community approachalso flags up those instances where local (or perhaps regional) serialwitch-hunts may have occurred, prosecuting people with no previousreputation for witchcraft.40Here more inquiry is needed, both into thepractices and contexts of local and regional witchcraft accusations, andinto the specific practices of local, regional and national connections.The various witchcraft accusation patterns that emerge by looking atthe community experience of witchcraft prosecution rather than theaggregate numbers of accused witches open up exciting new avenues.Most especially, it suggests the dominance of small-scale witchcraftaccusations rather than large-scale campaigns directed at hunting‘witches’ in general. This indicates the importance of community relations and the emergence of witchcraft belief out of everyday life.Notes1 The five peaks in annual rates of witchcraft prosecution in Scotland werefirst identified by C. Larner, Enemies of God: the Witch-Hunt in Scotland(London, 1981), 60. Larner called these peaks ‘national hunts’ (Enemies ofGod, 61). The consensus on chronology and geography of witchcraft prose-cution in Scotland is well described by S. Macdonald, The Witches of Fife:Witch-Hunting in a Scottish Shire, 1560–1710(East Linton, 2002), 16–29.Lauren Martin1399780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"2 See Larner, Enemies of God, 61–2; J. Goodare, ‘Witch-hunting and the Scot-tish state’, in J. Goodare (ed.), The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context(Manchester,2002), 136–9.3 The Survey’s chronological account of witchcraft prosecutions in Scotlandcan be viewed in Figure 2.1. Its findings are further discussed in L. Martinand J. Miller, ‘Some findings from the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft’,Chapter 2 above.4 Stuart Macdonald has noted that ‘What has gone largely unnoticed in thestatements made since Enemies of Godwas published, was the tentativenessand limited nature of the discussion within the book itself of the geographicaland chronological patterns of the Scottish witch-hunt’: Witches of Fife, 18.5 In addition to charting the chronological patterns of witchcraft prosecu-tion, scholars have charted the geography of accusations in Scotland; seefor example the map ‘Distribution and Intensity of Prosecutions’ in Larner,Enemies of God, 81. Although not the main subject of this chapter, themapping of Scottish witchcraft usually maps witchcraft suspects, employinga suspect-based model like the chronology of witchcraft.6 The idea of a ‘witch-accusing community’ model as described below followsfrom recent studies emphasising the neighbourhood dynamics of witchcraftaccusation, prosecution and belief: see especially R. Briggs, Witches andNeighbours: the Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft(2nd edn,London, 2002). However, following recent trends in Anthropology, I do notsee a necessary opposition between a focus on neighbourhood (or commu-nity) processes and state formation: K. Crehan, The Fractured Community:Landscapes of Power and Gender in Rural Zambia(Berkeley, Calif., 1997).Rather, they are part of the same processes. Communities participated inthe ways the Scottish state was formed and were in turn shaped by the waysstate power was exercised. See for example W. Roseberry, ‘The language ofcontention’, in G. Joseph and D. Nugent (eds), Everyday Forms of StateFormation: Revolution and the Negotiation of Rule in Modern Mexico(Durham,NC, 1994).7 For more on the concept of ‘belief’ see L. Martin, ‘The Devil and the Domestic:Witchcraft, Women’s Work and Marriage in Early Modern Scotland’ (NewSchool University PhD thesis, 2004), ch. 2.8 Larner, Enemies of God, 60.9 These terms are reflected in the titles of some books about early modernEuropean witchcraft prosecutions. See, for example, H. R. Trevor-Roper, TheEuropean Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries(Harmonds-worth, 1969); H. C. E. Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany,1562–1684(Stanford, Calif., 1972); B. P. Levack, The Witch-Hunt in EarlyModern Europe(3rd edn, London, 2006); A. L. Barstow, Witchcraze: a NewHistory of the European Witch-Hunts(San Francisco, Calif., 1994).10 The idea of a ‘witchcraft panic’ carries the possibility that witchcraft prose-cutions may have arisen from a craze or other agitated state of mind. Whileundoubtedly inspiring fear and great concern in the early modern world,witchcraft, witches and witchcraft prosecutions were also part of everydaylife and thought for early modern people and were not de factoirrational.See for example, S. Clark, Thinking with Demons: the Idea of Witchcraft inEarly Modern Europe(Oxford, 1997); Martin, ‘The Devil and the Domestic’.140Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 140"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"11 The exact number of suspects identified by the Survey, 3,837, gives tooprecise an impression because references that indicated groups of suspectswere counted as three suspects so as not to overestimate. Thus the Survey’sfinal number is most likely an underestimate. The Survey eliminated severalhundred duplicate entries in the Source-Bookin addition to identifyingmany more named witchcraft suspects. For more details see Martin andMiller, ‘Some findings’.12 Larner, Enemies of God, 61.13 The actual number of cases cannot be known before about 1610 due to a shortage of surviving evidence. Larner used impressionistic sources toestimate the size of the peaks. Julian Goodare has estimated that about 400 people may have been accused in 1597: ‘The Scottish witchcraft panicof 1597’, in Goodare (ed.), Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context, 70.14 Macdonald, Witches of Fife, 19–25, evaluates Larner’s geographical andchronological findings with his own digitised and updated version of Larneret al.,Source-book. Macdonald finds that ‘there seem to have been twowitch-hunts going on concurrently in Scotland during this period; the onedriven by village tensions (as in the case of Elspeth Thomson); the other byelite fears, which resulted in the persecution of otherwise harmless indi-viduals like Andro Man’: Witches of Fife, 25. Despite criticism of the idea ofnational witchcraft panics and his suggestion that ‘terms such as “largepanic” are not particularly helpful’ (Witches of Fife, 41), Macdonald retainsthe idea of national witchcraft panics and refers to the peak years as ‘thegreat hunts’ (Witches of Fife, 25).15 For ease of discussion and in order to assess the distribution of witchcraftcases I have grouped the 34 counties of Scotland into ten geographical‘regions’, some of which roughly correspond to the modern regions thatwere in use from the 1970s to the 1990s. I do not mean to suggest that allof these regions were historically meaningful, rather I adopted them as aconvenient way to label groups of counties.16 With percentage of suspects in parenthesis and percentage of general popu-lation following, those counties were: Berwick (4%) 2 per cent; Bute (2%) 1 per cent; Edinburgh (12%) 7 per cent; Fife (12%) 6 per cent; Haddington(18%) 2 per cent; Linlithgow (4%) 1 per cent; Peebles (3%) 1 per cent; andRenfrew (4%) 2 per cent. Data from the Witchcraft Survey, and the 1755census tabulated in J. G. Kyd (ed.), Scottish Population Statistics(SHS, 1952), 82.17 See Table 5.2.18 Macdonald, Witches of Fife, 33, argues that in Fife the presbytery was themost meaningful boundary for counting because it was ‘the local geo-graphic unit in which most witch-hunting occurred’.19 For witchcraft prosecution in 1661–1662 see B. P. Levack, ‘The greatScottish witch-hunt of 1661–1662,’ Journal of British Studies, 20 (1980),90–108.20 James Welch, a minor from Haddington parish, denounced at least 90 peopleas witches in 1662. A further 20 people were denounced, once removedfrom Welch. That makes 110 cases out of 402 that can be traced back to oneperson. This huge serial witchcraft prosecution was clearly linked to accusa-tions that had come to fruition in 1661 (i.e. those recorded in the 1661 peak),as some of those denounced by Welch were linked to an earlier group ofLauren Martin1419780230_507883_07_cha05.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 141"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"cases in East Lothian. The database tables ‘Other Named Witches’ and‘Mentioned as a witch’ in the Survey can be used to recreate chains of accu-sation. These figures were derived from counting the numbers of othernamed witches associated with Welch and those named by him.21 Of the 89 known cases from the Highland region in 1662, the parish of resi-dence is known for 67. A total of 191 suspects were named from the Highlandregion between 1563 and 1736. The next largest peak was 24 witchcraft casesin 1577. For more on witch-hunting in the Highlands see L. Henderson,‘Witch-hunting and witch belief in the Gàidhealtachd’, Chapter 4 above.22 Isobel Goudie named the 43 suspects from Auldearn.23RPC, 3rd ser., i, 233–4.

The fifteen suspects were related to theMacleans, who petitioned the privy council alleging that they were wronglyaccused of witchcraft by a rival family, the Chisholms.25 Larner, Enemies of God, Appendix 1.26 J. Goodare, ‘The framework for Scottish witch-hunting in the 1590s’, SHR, 81(2002), 240–50; M. Wasser, ‘The privy council and the witches: the curtail-ment of witchcraft prosecutions in Scotland, 1597–1628’, SHR, 82 (2003),20–46.27 A few recent local studies have shed light on the neighbourhood roots ofwitchcraft prosecution. See for example A. L. Cordey, ‘Witch-Hunting inthe Presbytery of Dalkeith, 1649 to 1662’ (University of Edinburgh MScthesis, 2003).28 See Martin, ‘The Devil and the Domestic’.29 E.g. J. Goodare, ‘The Aberdeenshire witchcraft panic of 1597’, NorthernScotland, 21 (2001), 17–37.30 Macdonald, Witches of Fife, 33; Cordey, ‘Witch-Hunting in the Presbytery ofDalkeith’. My preliminary investigation of the serial witch-hunt surround-ing Alexander Hamilton in 1629 confirms that accusations readily movedacross parishes and could spread wide distances.31 These figures count only those suspects with a known parish of residence –roughly two-thirds of all named witchcraft suspects. Unfortunately, it isbeyond the scope of this chapter to devise a method of including mentionsof witchcraft prosecution activity where no specific suspect was named.Again these figures are meant to provide an approximation. More detailedresearch into specific instances of witchcraft prosecution is needed.32 See Martin, ‘Devil and the Domestic’.33 E.g. Goodare, ‘The Scottish witchcraft panic of 1597’ and M. Wasser, ‘Thewestern witch-hunt of 1697–1700: the last major witch-hunt in Scotland’,both in Goodare (ed.), The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context; Levack, ‘GreatScottish witch-hunt’; Normand and Roberts (eds), Witchcraft; Cordey,‘Witch-Hunting in the Presbytery of Dalkeith’.34 The Survey recorded the settlement, parish, presbytery, county and burghof residence for witchcraft suspects when known. The analysis below wasproduced using the parish of residence, which is known for two-thirds of allnamed witchcraft suspects. Settlement of residence is the most unreliableresidence field, while presbytery and county are too big to capture the face-to-face accusation and investigation process.

For the purpose of this exercise, the parish is a good unit foruncovering possible serial witch-hunts because the parish minister andsecular officials with roughly parochial jurisdiction were often key figures inthe initial stages of witchcraft investigation.35 The exact figure is 63 per cent. This means that based on the surviving docu-ments there is no record of a witchcraft accusation that was seriously investi-gated by either church or secular authorities. The Survey did not include casesof witch-calling that were deemed slander. It is impossible to ascertain whether communities may have identified suspects who were not reported toauthorities. The Survey found 370 parishes that accused a suspect at least once.The exact number of parishes varied during the period. Figures were calculatedusing the number 1000 (P. G. B. McNeill and H. MacQueen (eds), Atlas ofScottish History to 1707(Edinburgh, 1996), 402).36 The second measure was calculated using the number of suspects per witch-accusing parish per year using the last known date associated with eachsuspect. Unfortunately this cannot quantify suspects accused in one parishover the course of more than one year.37 Thirty-seven per cent of all parishes in Scotland accused someone of witch-craft at least once.38 Parishes that had more than one witchcraft accusation episode could fallinto more than one category because each annual witchcraft accusationepisode is counted separately. For example, Ayr is counted 16 times becauseit had at least one witchcraft accusation episode in 16 separate years. Eachof these 16 episodes is categorised according to its intensity. This table mea-sures witchcraft accusation episodes per year per parish.39 This does not necessarily mean that the Devil was absent from everydaywitchcraft beliefs or that people disbelieved in the idea of a demonic witches’conspiracy. Rather it suggests that when confronted with a local witch, mostparishes did not act on those beliefs when pursuing prosecution.40 See Cordey, ‘Witch-Hunting in the Presbytery of Dalkeith’, and J.

During the years 1563 to 1736, how-ever, it was God’s opponent the Devil who appeared to get many of theheadlines.Using evidence from witchcraft trials, it is possible to claim, asChristina Larner did, that ultimately we know more about how Scottishpeasants saw the Devil than we do about how they saw God.1Thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries witnessed internecine strugglesbetween opposing bodies of church organisation, the fight for dom-inance over society between secular and religious authorities, as well asthe battle between God and the Devil over the souls of men andwomen. The archetypal image of a horned and cloven-footed, fiery-redmale Devil, which has become associated with the discourse of witch-craft and demonology, was perpetuated over time. Reginald Scot’sdescription of the Devil conveys a stereotypical image: ‘an ouglie divellhaving hornes on his head, fier in his mouth, and a taile in his breech,eies like a bason, fanges like a dog, clawes like a beare, a skin like aNiger, and a voice roring like a lion’.2However, the figure of the Devil that featured in much of the docu-mentary material associated with Scottish witchcraft is a much morecomplex being and indeed was rarely red-skinned or horned. Demonicfigures may well have been most frequently male and they often woreblack, but they could also wear other colours, some of which were sym-bolic of spiritual beliefs, notably that of fairies or ‘good neighbours’.The figures could be old or young, handsome or ugly, or grim or gen-tlemanly in appearance. The demon might wear a hat or bonnet, a9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"shawl or hood, or carry a staff. He could offer food, drink or someother relatively small-scale rewards. The demonic figure could appearin female form, albeit quite rarely, or take the form of an animal.Finally, he could take a more ethereal guise and appear as a spirit –sometimes as a ghost or angel.Although demonic figures of one form or another were mentioned392 times in witchcraft investigations and trials, an exact descriptionof the Devil is difficult to find. It is clear that the red-skinned, hornedone – Auld Nick, the earl of Hell, auld hornie, Mahoun3– was not onlyusually not named in person, but would also appear to have beenmostly absent from Scottish witchcraft. Demonic beliefs and figureswere crucial to witchcraft, but the whom and the what are just ascomplex and abstract as witchcraft itself. Despite the apocalyptic con-viction that many churchmen had that the Devil was ubiquitous, itseems that the Devil may have been quite an elusive figure. Possibly itwas because the Devil was so fundamental to the concept of witchcraftthat his presence did not require explicit reference. Nevertheless it issurprising that it featured in such a relatively small number of cases:226 out of 3,837 accused or around 6 per cent.4Of course this figureonly accounts for those cases which mentioned something specific thatwas then recorded in the documents. In most cases we simply do not,and cannot, know all of what was mentioned. It may be that the Devilwas mentioned much more often but, because most references aresimply a record of an application for, or issuing of, a commission wecannot know exactly how often such detail was mentioned. It wouldalso be inaccurate to assume that non-mentions indicate a lack ofbelief in, or absence of, demonic ideas.To a modern audience, the Devil that is described in witchcraft evidence may, therefore, seem to be a mysterious figure. What can bedemonstrated, however, is both interesting and paramount to thefurther understanding of witchcraft and demonic belief. Larner wascorrect: we do know a fair amount about the Devil, but on close exam-ination his image is more varied than we may have anticipated.Several questions will be addressed in this paper. How did the Devildescribed in elite demonological theory compare to the Devil thatappeared in Scottish witchcraft documents? Was there a shared culturalfoundation for elite theory and popular belief, or were there distinctdifferences? Was the Devil necessarily always a spiritual concept orcould the descriptions have a more mundane and corporeal explana-tion? Was the description of the Devil figure the result of pressure onsuspects from religious and legal authorities? How far was Devil aJoyce Miller1459780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"construct of elite theologians, whose belief in eschatology meant thatthey expected the last days of the world to be dominated by demonicpowers, rather than a reflection of popular beliefs and culture?IIAlthough documents containing evidence about witchcraft belief cangive some indication of how the Devil was conceived and perceived bysome sections of society, much of it contrasted with other elite descrip-tions of the Devil. Elite Biblical exegesis and other demonologicalsources gave some indication of who, and what, the Devil was – usuallya form of animal or beast. The Devil that appeared in confessionsabout witchcraft was, however, mostly human.There are relatively few descriptions of the physical appearance of the Devil in the Bible and most of them are in the New Testament.5In the words of Saint Peter: ‘your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour (I Peter, 5:8). InRevelation, there were descriptions of four demonic beasts – the first a lion, the second a calf, ‘the third beast had a face as man’ andthe fourth was like an eagle (4:7). Later on the Devil was described as a dragon and serpent: ‘the great dragon was cast out, that oldserpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world’(Revelation, 12:9). In the next chapter, chimera-like beasts weredescribed, one with seven heads and ten horns, that had ten crowns onits horns. This beast was like a leopard, with bear-like feet and themouth of a lion (Revelation, 13:1–2). Another beast had two horns likea lamb and spoke like a dragon, who deceived by means of miraclesand marked everyone on their right hand or forehead (Revelation,13:11–16). It would seem then that, even in the Bible, the Devil couldtake several forms, mostly animal, although one had a human face.Similarly the Biblical Devil had several names: Satan, Beelzebub andLucifer were the most common, but others included Asmodeus,Behemoth, Leviathan, Belial and the Prince of Darkness.6The Biblicalnaming of the Devil was just as varied as its description. Satan is theHebrew for adversary or plotter, and Second Corinthians had Satan‘transformed into an angel of light’ (11:14). Satan was also mentionedin First Chronicles (21:1); and in Luke, Satan was described as light-ning, which fell from the sky (10:18). An alternative name, Lucifer –bringer of light or Latin for the morning star – was said to have beenone of God’s archangels, who was cast out of heaven: ‘How art thoufallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning’ (Isiah, 14:12).

The light and lightning that are both associatedwith the biblical image of the pre-fall Devil contrast neatly with thedark and black, which are more commonly associated with his popular,or earthly, fallen image. A third epithet, Beelzebub, was from theHebrewbá’al zebûbmeaning Lord of the Flies. In Second KingsBeelzebub, or Baal-zebub, was god of Ekron or king of the Philistines(1:2), another opponent of God whose name was interpreted by theJews as meaning ‘lord of the dungheap’. In Matthew, Beelzebub wassaid to be the prince of the devils (12:24). According to Jewishdemonology, Asmodeus was another prince of demons who appearedin the book of Tobit, found in the Apocrypha. Bestial images or representations of the Devil were suggested by Behemoth, a giganticbeast – possibly a hippopotamus – described in the book of Job, andLeviathan, a sea monster (chapters 40 and 41). Belial, from the Hebrewbelî ya’almeaning ‘without worth’, was an apocalyptic demon associ-ated with Satan.7There are few visual illustrations of the Devil before the sixth centuryand even fewer of these were in popular circulation in early modernScotland. One of the earliest representations had the Devil in red, notblack, although neither colour is specified in the Bible; and as an angel,illustrating his previous incarnation as the archangel Lucifer before hisfall from grace.8Few medieval images showed the Devil in humanform; more often the Devil was portrayed as some form of beast or acombination of beasts. Woodcuts and carvings, paintings and stainedglass windows illustrated the Devil in variety of guises, with a numberof motifs: black, red, scaly-skin, horns, tails, wings and talons orhooves. The serpent and dragon in Revelation were depicted frequentlyand, in paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, the Devil was represented byinsects and beetles: the Lord of the Flies was literally a miniaturisedversion of the Devil. Although they were found more often on theContinent and England than in post-Reformation Scotland, which hadrejected religious images and iconography with the reform of thechurch in the sixteenth century, these diverse images attempted toaccommodate the confusing names, descriptions and explanations thatwere found in theological sources.Many of these ideas were later used in the demonological writings ofJames VI. In his Daemonologiethere were a number of descriptions of Satan. The Devil could transform himself into an angel of light – areference to Second Corinthians (11:14).9James claimed that the Devilcould also appear as a male goat, particularly at sabbats or witches’Joyce Miller1479780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotlandmeetings.10James repeated the standard view that Satan and otherdevils or demons were originally angels who had been expelled fromheaven.11Daemonologiealso described spirits that could take variousforms, such as Lemuresorspectra, which were horrible or monstrousspirits that haunted houses and people. Spirits could also appear in thelikeness of dead people, sometimes specifically referred to as ghosts, inwhich case they were called umbrae mortuorum.12James believed thatall these different manifestations of spirits were in fact the same, andthat ghosts were not the spirits of dead people but demons.Theologians thought that demons were not composed of flesh andblood, but were entirely spirit in form. This meant that the Devil couldtake any form he chose – as seen by the above examples – or he couldtake possession of or inhabit the body of a human being, although thislatter form appears to have been relatively rare in Scotland.13Anotherform of demonic spirit described by James was a rough man, oftencalled a brownie. Brownies and possibly gruagachorglaistig– femaleversions which helped with dairy work recorded in Gaelic folklore –were thought to attach themselves to households and help completeunpopular tasks without payment. As James VI wrote, ‘some were soblinded as to believe that their house was all the sonsier [i.e. luckier], asthey called it, that such spirits resorted there’.14IIIIf the theologians and other elite theorists thought that the devil hadsuch a varied appearance, in what form did he appear to those whoconfessed to having met or associated with him? It would seem thatthe Devil or devils found in the discourse of Scottish witchcraft trials was just as diverse as the theological or demonological one. Heappeared as a human, animal, insect, spirit (including ghosts), angeland fairy or elf. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft recorded 392 refer-ences to a Devil, or non-natural being as it was categorised for the pur-poses of the database during the research period.15Out of those 392citations, 276 took human form. Of those, 250 were male and 26 werefemale. Individually, the Devil in male form was the most common byfar; the second most frequent was in the form of an animal, which had60 references. Next were those in the form of a female, then fairies,which accounted for 18 (nine male, six female and three non-specificgender). This was followed by the category of unidentified spirits,which were mentioned 17 times, then ghosts, which had five refer-ences. There were three mentions of inanimate objects including a ruck9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"of hay and a wind, and on one occasion a whirlwind. Finally appear-ances of the Devil in the form of an insect, a baby or child were allmentioned once, and were therefore statistically not really significant.Given the gender stereotypes associated with witch belief, it was notsurprising that the male form dominated the statistics for the majorityof those women who described meeting the Devil: 216 out of 335.16The majority of demonic encounters described by men were also inmale form: 34 out of 57 mentions. Six mentioned the Devil in femaleform – around 11 per cent. This contrasts with only 20 references tothe Devil as a female out of 335 mentions that were recorded bywomen – around 6 per cent. Men also mentioned spirits, ghosts, fairiesand other unspecified demons, but did not mention babies, children,insects or inanimate objects.Confessions may have been influenced by the interrogators. Whatquestions did they ask and what preconceptions did they have about thecontent of the confessions? Unfortunately, evidence about direct ques-tioning is extremely limited and so we are left with an impression ofwhat was on the minds of the questioners. It would seem that, like theconfessions, their ideas were equally varied. In most cases the differentdescriptions of different demonic spirits appear to have been accepted, inthat that they confirmed demonic associations and proof of guilt. Theredoes not seem to have been any attempt to shape them into any oneform or another, i.e. the Devil found in demonologies and the Bible.This raises the question: were the interrogators, many of whom wereministers or elders, looking for a singular Devil or multiple demons ordevils or both? It is not possible to answer this, but since spirits ofanimal, inanimate, female and male forms were all deemed demonic bypost-Reformation Protestants, they were all equally dangerous.IVThe description of the male Devil was not uniform. The most commonwas as a black man or dressed in black, which was mentioned in 81 outof 392 occasions. It is not clear if the term black man referred to a manin black clothing, a man with black hair or one whose skin was black.Where clothing was specified, black was cited most frequently, with 51 references. Green was the next most common, with 23 mentions,followed by blue with 21. Grey accounted for nine references; whiteand brown were mentioned on five and four occasions respectively.Red was not mentioned in any description of a Devil figure (apart froma copper-faced man mentioned by Janet MacNicol).17The colour blackJoyce Miller1499780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"was associated with sin, which was clearly related to demonic activityand may explain why this featured most frequently. The black maledemonic figure was not unique to Scotland or even Britain: in SpanishCocowas the black devil and in Italian he was called l’homo negro.Typical examples of men in black are illustrated by AlexanderHamilton, executed for witchcraft in 1630, who described a black manin black clothes who did not have a cloak but had a wand.18AgnesClarkson, from Dirleton, accused of witchcraft in 1649, describedmeeting a black man with a staff.19When she initially refused to jointhe Devil, she said that the house had filled with a black wind andmist. Isobel Smith, from Bolton, tried for witchcraft in 1661, describeda black man dressed in green and, in 1662, Janet Morrison, fromRothesay, confessed to seeing the Devil as a naked man with a blackhead and another black man who was rough and fierce.20MargaretJackson, from Paisley, executed for witchcraft in 1677, described ablack man with a bluish band and white cuffs, who wore hoggers(stockings worn as gaiters), but no shoes.21It appears that even thosewho were described as men in black were not all the same.The colour green was often associated with misfortune rather thansin.22It was also frequently associated with fairy or elfin figures ofsome form, which were perceived to be demonic. In many cases it wasnot always stated categorically by the accused or recorded accurately byofficials that what was meant was an elf or fairy: some descriptionswould simply refer to ‘a man in green’. If all references to green weretaken to indicate fairy belief then this would alter the statistical ana-lysis slightly, increasing the appearance of the Devil in the form of fairiesto 40 references. Since there was often no further unequivocal refer-ence to the Devil figure as a fairy, this was not taken as an absolute orobjective indicator. In 1616, Elizabeth Riach from Orkney claimed thatshe met a male devil in green tartan. She also claimed that she metanother male, this time a male fairy who was her relative.23The malefairy in Isobel Haldane’s account from 1623 had a grey beard.24BarbaraParish, from Livingston, who was probably executed in 1647, confessedthat she met a male fairy in green clothing with a grey hat.25In 1662,Isobel Goudie described meeting a well-favoured man who was theking of fairies at the church of Auldearn.26It is undoubtedly possible tosuggest, however, as others have done, that what is indicated by theconflation of the colour green and fairies and devils in witchcraft testi-mony is that the figure of the Devil in early modern Scotland was amixture of elite demonological and other popular beliefs, rather thansimply a straightforward elite theological interpretation.27150Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Other descriptive elements of the Devil included reference to himbeing a gentleman, who could be pleasant, trim, well-favoured, prettyand gallant. He could also be grim, fearful, fierce, rough, cold or ill-favoured. Agnes Pogavie, from Liberton, who was executed in 1661,claimed that she met an ‘ill-hewed man’ – possibly an unhealthy orpale figure – and Janet MacNair, from Stirling, confessed that she met a‘grim, black man’ – a very typical description.28Positive descriptions,however, like that of Marion Lyne, from Prestonpans, who describedmeeting a gentleman, and Isobel Ramsay, from Duddingston, whoclaimed that she met a pleasant young man, somewhat surprisingly,appeared slightly more frequently than negative ones.29In terms of size the Devil was more often large, meikle or greatthan he was little. According to Agnes Naesmith from Erskine, whowas executed in 1697, the Devil had long black hair, which, perhapsto indicate a more bestial image, was described as a mane.30Not allthe figures had black hair: Janet Miller from Rerrick, who was exe-cuted in 1658, confessed that she met a man of middling height, whowas 40 years old and who had flaxen hair.31The image of the man inblack may seem obvious enough but a more general term like ‘rough’man may have equated to the popular idea of a brownie, the helpfuldomestic spirit that featured in a number of folk beliefs and folk talesthroughout Scotland.32In 1649 Thomas Shanks confessed to meetinga ‘thick little man’ and in 1680 Margaret Comb, from Bo’ness,described seeing a ‘thick, little man’, both of which might indicate abrownie.33When clothing was specified, the male Devil was reported to haveworn different types of bonnet, cravat, hat, coat, shawl and hood or,more vaguely, was very well-dressed. Janet Man, from Stenton, con-fessed that she met a figure wearing ‘grey clothes like a gentleman’.34This poses a variety of questions. The negative descriptive elementsconform to expectations of ugliness, cruelty and danger; but how couldthe Devil be pleasant, pretty and gallant? How could he be a well-dressed gentleman? Peter Maxwell-Stuart suggests that during the six-teenth century witch prosecution was part of an attack on Catholicismor pre-Reformation religious practice.35His thesis is that the figure ofthe Devil dressed in black, in a black gown and bonnet, might havebeen a pre-Reformation priest. He cites the example of Janet Stratton,who was one of those accused during the North Berwick trials in 1591.She claimed that the Devil appeared to her as a ‘blak priest with blakclaithis’.36In another case, Maxwell-Stuart cites Robert Grierson asdescribing a man wearing a black gown and a skull bonnet.37WhileJoyce Miller1519780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"these cases may be particularly indicative of pre-Reformation clerics,post-Reformation ministers also wore black gowns and bonnets, albeitprobably not skull bonnets.38It might therefore be pertinent to extendMaxwell-Stuart’s point and suggest that some of these ‘men in black’,and especially those wearing bonnets, such as that described byMargaret Alan, from Bathgate, who was banished for witchcraft in1661, may have been clerical figures of either pre-Reformation or post-Reformation churches.39Although it is unlikely that all the outdoor meetings described bypeople accused of witchcraft during the seventeenth century were con-venticles or religious meetings, it is possible that some of them were.Clandestine conventicle meetings started in 1619 during one of themany unsettled periods of the Reformed church. Later, numerous crisesof authority between royal or secular power and ecclesiastical or spir-itual power led to further splits and eventual revolution. The church inScotland was by no means a unified organisation during the seven-teenth century. After 1661 around one-third of ministers were expelledfrom their positions.40It is interesting to note that there were 95 refer-ences to the Devil in 1661 and 1662 and 75 of them were to men (60 in 1661 and 15 in 1662). In total there were 108 references to menin black and a fifth of all descriptions of men in black came from thesetwo years – 18 in 1661 and four in 1662. It is unlikely that these ‘menin black’ were individual ministers who had been expelled, as most ofthe deprivations occurred after 1662, but there may have been somecultural link. Men in black were mentioned nine times before 1600 and17 times between 1600 and 1650. Eighty-one mentions of the Devil asa man in black occurred after 1650. The Devil as a man in black wasclearly a seventeenth-century phenomenon.VAccording to biblical authority, the Devil could change his appearanceas he desired. He appeared as a lamb but could speak like a dragon(Revelation, 13:11). He could be a roaring lion who devoured all those around him (I Peter, 5:8). He was also described as a serpent(Revelation, 4:7). On the whole very little of this type of imagery wasconfessed or described during investigations for witchcraft in Scotland.There are 60 references to beasts and fewer mentions of bestial humandevils. Six references were made to male devils with cloven feet andtwo with cloven lips.41These include Janet Miller, from Kirkliston, who described meeting a man who had cloven feet like an ox.42152Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Helen Casse, from Duddingston, executed in 1661, confessed to meetinga cloven-footed man, as did Margaret Jackson, from Paisley, in 1677.43The Devil met by Janet Braidhead from Auldearn was a ‘mekle, rochman with cloven feet’; however, none of the descriptions includedhorns, tails, wings or fur.44This does rather negate the image perpetu-ated by theological or demonological works or by contemporary visualrepresentations. The figure preaching from the tree stump which illus-tratesNewes from Scotland(1591) is suggestive of some form of tailedand horned beast: perhaps a dragon. The woodcut included by Guazzoin his Compendium Maleficarum(1626) of the Devil taking the youngchild from its parents depicts a winged, cloven-footed beast standingon two legs. These were easily identifiable as the Devil. There was no mistaking either of these images of the Devil as a human, whichappeared to be something the ordinary population of most Europeancountries did. It would appear from both biblical descriptions andother testimony that the Devil was a master of disguise and found itmore efficient and threatening to appear in a more mundane disguisethan in an obvious grotesque shape. What is also interesting is that,like men in black, the references to cloven-footed devils all came fromthe second half of the seventeenth century: 1661, 1662 and 1680. Thiswould seem to be a reflection of the increased stereotyping of the Devilby elite opinion, and which appeared to influence, and increasinglydominate, the language of witchcraft that was recorded during investi-gations and trials.Janet MacNicol, from Dunoon, mentioned one form of deformeddemon in 1673. She described three forms of male Devil: one was awell-favoured young man, one a gross, copper-faced man and one aleper.45Leprosy was a common enough and well-recognised disease inthe early modern period, and lepers had restricted entry to mostburghs. They were permitted to beg but were excluded from regularsocial interaction.46This leprous devil figure would certainly suggest amore repulsive image, as the disfiguring skin lesions would immedi-ately identify an individual who was not part of regular society. Aslepers were not that uncommon at this time, however, this image mayhave seemed less frightening to an early modern community than itwould to many of us today.One question that seems obvious is: why was the Devil figure foundin popular culture not more monstrous? Even the animals that weredescribed as devils were hardly grotesque. These included dogs, cats,birds, horses and foals, deer or stags, cows and calves, lambs, rats and‘beasts’. The most common were dogs, which accounted for 25 out ofJoyce Miller1539780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"60 references, followed by cats and ‘beasts’, which had six mentionseach. Birds, including crows, ravens and magpies, and deer, were men-tioned five times. Foals, horses, calves, cows, rats and lambs accountedfor 12 in total. There were young dogs, black dogs, brown dogs, bigrough dogs, round headed cats, and white and grey stags. These every-day animals are illustrated by the magpie and jackdaw described byThomas Leys, from Aberdeen, who was executed in 1597; a horse that was recorded in the trial of James Reid, from Inveresk, who wasexecuted in 1603; a black dog described in 1649 by Isobel Murray, fromPencaitland; and the dog and cat which Katherine Walker, fromBrechin, claimed to have seen in 1650.47InDaemonologieJames VI noted that the Devil could appear in thelikeness of a dog, cat, ape or other such beast.48His claim that theDevil often appeared at witches’ meetings as a goat buck is not con-firmed by the evidence.49The most monstrous sounding descriptionsfound in the documents are those of rather unspecified ‘uncouthbeasts’, a dog with a sow’s head, described by Janet Black from Stirling,and a rough dog who could speak, recorded in Katherine Shaw’s trial inLanark in 1644.50Yet, apart from the dog with a sow’s head, none ofthese sound very chimera-like. They do not conjure up images of hip-popotamus-like Behemoth, a Leviathan-like sea-monster or the apoca-lyptic image of Belial. There were not even any references to slightlyless monstrous serpents or dragons. Virtually all of the animals cited asdemonic were domestic. Apart from perhaps deer or stags, they wouldall have been well-known, even to town dwellers. Yet again it seemsthat in popular culture the Devil was more effective disguised indomesticity than disgust.VIThere are far fewer references to the Devil as a female than as male: 26 in all, although this increases to 32 if Devil as female fairy is alsoincluded. There is less variation in the appearance of the Devil asfemale: two wore green, one wore white, one appeared like the accusedherself, another woman had a black pot, and four were recorded asQueen of Elves.51Alison Pierson, Andrew Man, Isobel Goudie and JeanWeir all mentioned meeting the Queen of Elves.52Although two ofthese references are from the sixteenth century – Pierson (1588) andMan (1598) – it is clear that the concept of the Queen of Elves did notdisappear in the seventeenth century, as the other two references camefrom 1661 and 1670.154Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 154"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Twenty-one people described the female Devil as ‘Antiochia, gentlewife of the Devil’.53The overall statistics for the Devil as female areskewed by the over-representation of this description. They all camefrom a large group of people, including Agnes Naesmith, KatherineCampbell, Margaret Fulton, Margaret Laing, John Reid, James Lindsay,Elizabeth Anderson and Mary Morrison, who were accused of bewitch-ing Christian Shaw in 1697. The consistency of the language used inthe reference indicates that there may have been a very opinionatedhand behind the acquisition, or the recording, of the information ratherthan reflecting a widespread popular idea.54Although it is almost imposs-ible to judge who or what this figure was, it is interesting to note thatshe was referred to as the ‘gentle wife’ of the Devil. Indeed apart fromthis, none of the other descriptions of the Devil in female form includeany reference to size, nature or physical features.What does this indicate about early modern society’s attitudetowards the gender of supernatural or preternatural beings? Does itconfirm the suggestion that the female figure was believed to be softerand gentler and therefore society was unable to reconcile her with any-thing demonic? Early modern Christian society perceived God as male,but in pagan religions both gods and goddesses were quite acceptable.Although in monotheistic Christian theology God, and his counter-part, were overwhelmingly perceived as male, technically God wasneither male nor female but a pure form of androgynous spirit. BothGod and the Devil were, however, described, for the most part, in maleterms. Nevertheless, the Holy Spirit was identified by ancient Semiticcults as female. Hagia Sophia(sacred wisdom) or Logoswas the secondpart of the Holy Trinity and was deemed to be female. Although therewas a female aspect to the Christian belief in the Holy Trinity, a similardegree of femininity did not extend to the Devil. What was moreacceptable for society was to have the female figure subservient to themale. The Devil could be male, or take any other form, but the femalewitch was always in an inferior position.55Two of the female demonic representations wore white. White wastraditionally associated with purity or virginity, and was also associatedwith the Magi and Druids. There is no indication, however, that eitherof these meanings was implied in these cases. Indeed both contrast quitemarkedly: one had a spiritual meaning and the other a more mundaneexplanation. In 1597 Marion Grant from Methlick described her femaleDevil as wearing a ‘white wylicoat’ (waistcoat). She claimed that thefigure was called ‘Our Ladye’, which is suggestive of the Virgin Maryrather than anything demonic.56Post-Reformation church theologyJoyce Miller1559780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"removed the figure of the mother of Christ, as well as saints, from theritual of holy worship and so perhaps this is an example of a recastingof pre-Reformation religious worship as demonic and dangerous. Incontrast, in 1658 Katherine Remy, from Alloa, said she met a femaleDevil figure in a white gown. Later, during further questioning, sheclaimed that the figure might simply have been Elizabeth Black, one ofthe other women who were investigated at the same time – a rathermore straightforward explanation.57Given the popularity of Mariancults in the sixteenth century, however, it is perhaps surprising thatthere were not more references to ‘Our Lady’ if witchcraft prosecutionwas being used as an attack on pre-Reformation religious practice andbelief.VIISince God and the Devil were both pure spirit and could take anyform, it is relevant to examine the Devil figures that were described asspirits, rather than those that took a more corporeal human or animalform. There were 17 references in total. Although some of them took aphysical form, they seem to have been regarded as distinct from theother corporeal forms. Some of the references to spirits appear to havebeen more like ghosts, although they were not always called that in thedocuments. Also, rather than being an androgynous spirit, someappeared to have a specific gender: two were stated as being female andfour of them were male. Some of the spirits were angels, including twowho were called Christsonday. Sometimes the angels were part of alarger group of non-natural beings that the accused claimed to haveseen. Alternatively, they seemed to be able to appear in different formsat different times, confirming the theory that spirits had the ability tochange shape. In 1590 Isobel Watson, from Glendevon, told the pres-bytery of Stirling that she had seen a spirit in the form of an angel.58She also told the authorities, however, that the spirit could also takethe form of a male human and called him Thomas Murray. It is notclear if she meant a ghost at this point, as the term was not used, but itis a possibility given other similar examples. Thirdly, she also claimedthat the ‘fair folk’ or fairies had visited her. Again it is not clear if shemeant that the spirits and ghosts were the same as the fairies or weredifferent in some way and, if so, how. It is therefore not really legit-imate to conflate them into one form or another. Another illustrationthat confirms that those who were describing events made some dis-tinction between the forms of spirits is seen in the case of Jean Weir156Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"from Edinburgh. Weir confessed to witchcraft and incest in 1670, 80 years after Isobel Watson.59She told the authorities that she met afemale spirit as well as the Queen of Elves. Weir claimed that the spiritwoman intervened with the Queen of Elves on her behalf so Weircould get help with her spinning.60This clearly indicates that everymention of a female spirit did not necessarily always refer to the Queenof Elves.Christine (Christian) Reid (1597) and Andrew Man (1598), both fromAberdeenshire, described meeting a spirit in the form of an angel,whom they both called Christsonday.61Man also confessed to meetinga wide range of spirits in various forms: a stag deer, the ghosts ofThomas the Rhymer and James IV, a black beast, and the Queen ofElves. Reference to angels would certainly tie in with the theologicalidea that Satan was a fallen angel, a theory that was also supported indemonological writings. Another point to note, however, is that thereferences to angels came from the sixteenth century, which wouldsuggest that this was possibly indicative of pre-Reformation religiousbelief. Like the Virgin Mary and saints, belief in the active role ofangels was excluded from reformed Christian doctrine of the seven-teenth century. Images of angels were still used to decorate post-Reformation churches but their power as intercessors was no longeracceptable.62There are two possible explanations for the presence of angels in six-teenth-century confessions and their disappearance from seventeenth-century accounts. One is that it might illustrate the demonising ofpre-Reformation ritual by the post-Reformation religious authoritiesand the use of witchcraft prosecution as a front for attacks onCatholics. While this has quite an emotive impact there are limits to itsapplication. If the numbers of confessions about angels and femalespirits who might be regarded as suggestive of the Virgin Mary arecombined, they account for a very small proportion of those who wereaccused between 1563 and 1736, and even of those just from the six-teenth century. While some of those involved in the investigation andprosecution of accused witches may have had an anti-Catholic agenda,particularly in the early years after 1560, it could not be the only expla-nation for their actions.63Another explanation for the apparent disap-pearance of angels in the seventeenth century is that the slow, butconstant, attack on pre-Reformation belief had worked, and thatsociety no longer accepted the possibility of spirits and angels in particular. This is of course not true. Like the Devil, angels did not disappear in the seventeenth century but remained very much part ofJoyce Miller1579780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotlandthe cosmology of early modern society.64Unlike the Devil, however,who was still the main rival of the church, angels were not perceived asa threat. The seventeenth-century church, in order to focus its atten-tion on the Devil, had simplified its description and instead concen-trated on apocalyptic interpretations of the rise of the Devil.65Interestin angels and other spirits by the authorities had declined and this wasreflected in the language of witchcraft investigation.As in the case of Andrew Man, a number of the spirits describedmight have been regarded as ghosts of people who were known to theaccused. Janet Boyman, executed at Ayr in 1572, claimed that the Devilappeared to her in the spirit of Maggie Dewand, a woman who wasknown to her, as well as in a whirlwind.66In 1576 Elizabeth Dunlop,from Lyne, claimed she met a number of ghosts: the ghosts of ThomasReid, said to have died at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, and the Laird ofAuchenskeith.67In 1605 Patrick Lawrie, from Dundonald, claimed thathe met the spirit of Helena MacBurnie, although he did not say whoshe was.68Janet Morrison confessed that she met the ghost of AdamKerr in 1662.69The spirits claimed to have been met by women fromCulross in 1675 were all given names – Peter Solloway, Peter Drysdaleand Laurie Moir.70It is not clear if they were thought to be the spiritsof dead men known to the individuals or just some other form ofspirits who had rather prosaic names. More categorically, in 1677Margaret Jackson claimed that she met the spirit, or ghost, of her deadhusband, Thomas Stewart.71Like others, Jackson had known the spiritin real life.Agnes Sampson, one of those involved in the North Berwick episodein 1591, claimed that a spirit called Elva or Eloa visited her. Agnesclaimed that she could call the spirit by its name and it could appear asa dog. Elohimis the Hebrew word for gods; the singular being eloreloah, and the word itself was believed to have magical properties.Sampson claimed that she uttered it when she was carrying out healingrituals, which would seem to reflect this ancient belief. This was anunusual reference and indicated some sophisticated, if rather fragmen-tary, theological knowledge, which is surprising given Sampson’s ordinary social and economic background.Another of the North Berwick group, Euphemia MacCalzean, saidthat an invisible spirit, who spoke to her, had visited her.72This spiritor Devil had no physical form at all. In another case, this time from1706, well after the main periods of prosecution, Jean Brown, fromPenninghame, also claimed that she conversed with invisible spirits.73Although she could not see them she could feel them and they lay9780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:51 AM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"with her ‘carnally as men and women do’. Unlike MacCalzean’s descrip-tions, Brown’s confession was full of religious language and convic-tions: she claimed the spirits represented her maker, and she also referredto them as her Father, Son and Holy Ghost. As this form of invisiblespirit appeared so infrequently in the confessions of those accused ofwitchcraft, it would seem that in Scotland at least, people preferredtheir devils to be more substantial.VIIIThe Devil is present in Scottish witchcraft material, in various formsand in less detail than might have been expected. The Devil was moreoften mundane and inconsequential rather than monstrous and fright-ening, and demonstrates a combination of popular ideas and elite theories. Since the concept of the Devil that was created by elite theologians and demonologists of the Judeo-Christian tradition was anattempt to recast non-orthodox ideology as superstitious, it was only tobe expected that the concept would have various forms. It was also notunexpected that the Devil was often rather understated and ordinary:if he was hard to identify then he would be far more dangerous. TheDevil was a master of disguise so could appear in any form that fittedwith the language used by those who described him. In order to enticeindividuals to join him, it was more effective to seem less terrifying.The increased presence of the man in black is, however, likely to be areflection of theological opinion. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-centurytheology and demonology reflected the apocalyptic ideas of the Bookof Revelation. James VI referred to Revelation and the end of the worldinDaemonologie:For the great wickedness of the people, on the one part, procuresthis horrible defection whereby God justly punisheth sin by a greateriniquity. And on the other part, the consummation of the world andour deliverance drawing near, makes Satan to rage the more in hisinstruments (Revelation, 12) knowing his kingdom to be so near anend.74Witches were seen as precursors to Satan’s domination of the earth andits population in advance of Christ’s Second Coming, which in turnwould indicate the beginning of the end of the world. Those who sub-scribed to an eschatological position engaged in a self-perpetuatingargument: if the end of the world was due there would be an increasedJoyce Miller1599780230_507883_08_cha06.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"presence of the Devil and therefore of witches and witchcraft. In turn,if more witches were discovered and confessed to increased involve-ment with the Devil this indicated a greater likelihood that the worldwould end. Catholics and Protestants alike subscribed to this asser-tion.75Nevertheless, as Stuart Clark points out, even eschatologicalideas were not uniform. Some claimed the appearance of theAntichrist, some the Second Coming of Christ, others the resurrectionof the dead, the end of the world and finally the Last Judgement.76In 1598 Andrew Man described visions of the Day of Judgement, when‘fyre will burne the watter and the earth’.77During the seventeenthcentury, when the Devil and his disciples were increasing their activity,apocalyptic visions did not feature among the confessions. Somewhatironically, it was not until the eighteenth century, in 1706 – after the endof the world did not happen – that Jean Brown described, in similar lan-guage, her vision of the apocalypse, when the heavens would be asthunder and fire.78In this case, rather than identifying this as straight-forward witchcraft, the church initially decided that Brown’s claims wereblasphemous and delusions. She was only accused of witchcraft after sheescaped prison, when she was issued with an order of excommunication.The Devil was a fundamental element of witchcraft belief. The increasein his presence during the seventeenth century is likely to reflect anincreased anxiety on the part of those investigating accusations and therecasting of their definition of demonic powers and activities. Perhaps wedo know more about how Scottish peasant society saw the Devil thanGod, but what is most striking is that, despite the importance of thedemonic pact as evidence of guilt, the Devil and his various guises, orassociates, appear to have been relatively ordinary.Notes1 C.

It subsequently became clear, how-ever, that this was too restrictive and did not accommodate the variety ofdemonic and/or spiritual detail contained in the documentary material. It was therefore decided to expand the categories listed in the field ‘Devil_type’to include: Baby: the Devil appearing in the form of a baby; Child Devil:the Devil appearing in the form of a child; Fairy: non-natural being appear-ing in the form of a fairy, gender not specified; Female: the Devil appearingin the form of a female; Female Fairy: non-natural being appearing in theform of a female fairy; Ghost: non-natural being appearing in the form of aghost or dead person; Inanimate Object Devil: the Devil appearing in theform of an inanimate object; Insect Devil: the Devil appearing in the formof an insect; Male: the Devil appearing in the form of a man; Male Fairy:non-natural being appearing in the form of a male fairy; Other Demon:non-natural being appearing in the form of another non-specified demon;Spirit: non-natural being appearing in the form of a non-specified spirit;Unspecified Devil: non-natural being appearing in the form of a non-specifiedDevil. This range allowed the researchers to record a wider range of mate-rial, which also meant that it could be used for comparative analysis. Thefield ‘Devil_text’ provides extra information describing what was written orquoting from the document. This field is therefore useful for more qualita-tive comparison. Another field ‘Devil notes’ also provides expanded details.Both these fields contain significant information, such as the type or colourof clothing, the physique of the being, or perhaps a name if recorded.

LevackThe early modern period of European history was not only the age ofwitch-hunting; it was also the age of demonic possession. The entranceof evil spirits into the bodies of human beings and their assumption ofcontrol of those persons’ movements and behaviour became epidemicin late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe.1The Burgundiandemonologist Henri Boguet wrote in 1602 that ‘every day [Savoy]sends us a countless number of persons possessed of demons which, onbeing exorcised, say that they have been sent by witches’.2Between1627 and 1631 the parish of Mattaincourt in Lorraine was home to nofewer than 85 possessed women and children.3At periodic intervalsduring the seventeenth century groups of nuns in French, Italian and Spanish convents went into fits; screamed, howled, vomited andfainted; spoke in foreign tongues; cursed their confessors and mothersuperiors; and performed great feats of strength. In Italy hundreds ofself-proclaimed victims of possession flocked to the priest and exorcistGiovan Battista Chieasa to expel demons from their bodies.4InGermany scores of possession narratives, detailing the assaults ofdemons on young men and women, were published.5As far east asRussia women known as shriekers howled, screamed, convulsed andtore off their clothes, leading their neighbours to claim that they werepossessed by devils.6The epidemic of possession coincided with the increase in witchcraftprosecutions, and the two developments were related. Theologiansargued that although a demonic spirit could possess the body of ahuman being on its own initiative (as long as God permitted it), thepossession could just as likely occur at the command of a witch. Inthose cases the demoniac became the victim of witchcraft, and thedemoniac’s afflictions were considered to be maleficia, the acts of9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"harmful magic that witches allegedly performed. It was quite commonfor witches to be accused of having caused demonic possession. Boguetbegan his discourse on witchcraft with a discussion of the chargesagainst Françoise Secretain for having used witchcraft to cause the possession of an eight-year-old girl.7In 1634 the parish priest UrbainGrandier was executed for causing the possession of a group ofUrsuline nuns at Loudun by means of witchcraft,8while in the Germanuniversity town of Paderborn a wave of possessions and exorcismsbetween 1656 and 1659 led to a witch-hunt that resulted in about 50executions.9In 1692 a large witch-hunt began in Salem, Massachusettswhen a group of young girls had fits and convulsions that were inter-preted as signs of possession.10However closely the phenomena of witchcraft and possession are linked, we must not conflate the two. Possession by the Devilhimself, without the agency of a witch, had been the norm in theMiddle Ages, and in many parts of Europe during the early modernperiod, especially in Germany, possession was not usually attributedto witchcraft.11Of more than 45 group possessions in European convents during the early modern period, only five French cases(including one at Aix-en Provence in 1609–1611, which was attrib-uted to the witchcraft of Father Louis Gaufridi) had anything to dowith witchcraft.12There were two main reasons why cases of possession might notleadto trials for witchcraft. The first was that the initial accusations againstwitches for causing possessions came from the demoniacs themselves,and since their words were believed to be those of the Devil, the Masterof Lies, they could not be considered reliable. The second was that toclaim for witches the power to command demons to enter anotherhuman being was to detract from the power of God himself. As theScottish jurist Sir George Mackenzie wrote in 1678, ‘It is not to beimagined that Devils would obey mortal creatures, or that God wouldleave so great a power to any of them to torment poor mortals.’13Witchcraft and possession were thus distinct phenomena that onlysometimes intersected. They both represented responses to the demon-isation of European culture that began in the fourteenth century andreached its peak towards the end of the sixteenth century.IWhen we turn our attention to possession in Scotland, we are facedwith a historical enigma. Although the Devil was certainly a prominentBrian P. Levack1679780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"part of Scottish theology and spiritual life during the early modernperiod, the record of demonic possession in Scotland is threadbare.14The narratives of possessions that appear so frequently in France,Germany, and England in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesare not found in Scotland until the 1690s. Even more striking, therecords of Scottish witchcraft prosecutions do not provide examples ofwitches sending demons into the bodies of their victims, once againuntil the 1690s.If it had not been for the widely known possession of ChristianShaw, Scotland might have avoided the European epidemic of demonicpossession entirely. In August 1696 Christian, the 11-year-old daughterof John Shaw, the laird of Bargarran, in the parish of Erskine,Renfrewshire, began to experience fits and bodily contortions; herbody became stiff and motionless, and her tongue protruded at greatlength. She experienced temporary deafness, blindness and an inabilityto speak. She regurgitated hair, straw, coal cinders the size of chestnuts,gravel, pins, feathers of wild fowl and bones of various sorts. At timesher head twisted around, as if her neck bone had been dissolved. Herstomach ‘swelled like a drum, as like a woman with child’.15At timesshe had difficulty breathing and felt as if she was being choked. Duringsome of her fits she took off all her clothes. Witnesses claimed that ona number of occasions she was carried through her house ‘with such aswift and unaccountable motion that it was not in the power of any toprevent her – her feet not touching the ground’.16She also conversedwith invisible spectres.While experiencing her fits, Christian Shaw accused KatherineCampbell, one of the maids in the house, and Agnes Nasmith,described by her neighbours as ‘an old widow woman, ignorant, and ofa malicious disposition, addicted to threatenings’, of having caused hersuffering by witchcraft.17She later added others to the list of accusedculprits. The entire affair was eventually referred to the privy council,which commissioned Lord Blantyre and eight other members of thelocal elite to interrogate and imprison persons suspected of witchcraftand to examine witnesses. The resulting precognitions, which were nottaken on oath, led to the confessions of Elizabeth Anderson (aged 17),James Lindsay (aged 14), and Thomas Lindsay (a minor), all grandchil-dren of Jean Fulton, and the naming of accomplices who had allegedlygathered with the Devil. All in all, 24 persons were indicted for witch-craft. On 5 April a commission of justiciary granted by the privycouncil authorised a trial of seven of these persons. All seven were triedand executed at Paisley in May.18168Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The possession of Christian Shaw and the witch-hunt it had inaugu-rated were not the only cases of demonic possession that led to accusa-tions of witchcraft in Scotland towards the close of the seventeenthcentury. Two years after the Paisley trial, another two demoniacs,Margaret Murdoch and Margaret Laird, who lived in the same vicinityas Shaw, accused more than 20 persons of witchcraft.19The symptomsof possession that these two young girls displayed were strikinglysimilar to those observed in Shaw. Witnesses claimed that MargaretMurdoch’s body stretched back like a bow, while her neck, legs andarms became so stiff that they could not be moved. Observers reportedthat when her legs were wrapped around a chair, they could not beseparated without breaking. She vomited up pins, straw, hair, wool,rags and feathers after her mouth had been searched to see if she hadbeen concealing the substances. Her body showed signs of having beenpinched and pricked, and one witness said that her flesh was blisteredand burnt as if it had been seared by a hot iron. Her mouth wasopened ‘beyond measure’ and her tongue drawn out ‘to the tail of herchin’. She sat naked during some of her fits, and sometimes her armswere extended and positioned in such a way that people could notdress her without breaking her bones.20Margaret Laird allegedly experienced many of the same symptoms asMurdoch and Shaw. She fell into a fainting fit and then a deaf fit, andwhen she recovered she cried out but was unable to speak. ThomasBrown, the minister at Paisley, described her torments as ‘preternat-ural’. She was so badly contorted that three or four people could nothold her using all their power, while her throat swelled so much thatattendants had to loosen her clothes. She claimed that the reason forthat swelling was that one of her tormentors was pushing a buttondown her throat. Her hand also became swollen, and her arm becameblack from the finger ends to the elbow. During some of her fits shedeclared that the Devil was beside her in a chain.21Murdoch and Laird named several tormentors, and when theseaccused witches were placed in their presence, the two girls fell intofits, in the manner of many other demoniacs. Their accusations forwitchcraft led to a request to the privy council to authorise the precog-nition of witnesses, which took place at Paisley and Glasgow in April1699. These precognitions, which came from a total of 91 witnesses,identified more than 20 witches, many of whom were accused ofcausing Murdoch’s and Laird’s fits. Some of those who were accusedhad been suspected of witchcraft before they were named as the sourceof the two girls’ afflictions. This suggests that the residents of the areaBrian P. Levack1699780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"were taking this opportunity to implicate individuals long suspected ofwitchcraft but never prosecuted. Their names might very well havebeen suggested to Murdoch and Laird while they were in their fits, sothat they might identify them as their tormentors.The similarities between the experiences of Murdoch and Laird onthe one hand and those of Christian Shaw on the other were not fortu-itous. The possession and dispossession of Christian Shaw was wellknown in the area around Paisley and Glasgow, and by 1699 narrativesof Shaw’s possession had also appeared in print, as shall be discussedbelow. Murdoch and Laird therefore modelled their behaviour on thatof Shaw, while their families and neighbours continued to search forthe witches in the region who were responsible for tormenting theseyoung demoniacs.Further connections between the events of 1697 and 1699 in thewest country derived from the fact that Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, oneof the commissioners who investigated and tried the persons accusedof causing the possession of Christian Shaw, took the lead in the pro-ceedings at Paisley and Glasgow in 1699. Maxwell, the son of a famousvictim of witchcraft in 1678, was not as successful in 1699 as he hadbeen with the Paisley witches two years before. In this case the privycouncil did not find the evidence sufficient for a trial and did not granta commission of justiciary.22The likely explanation for their inactionwas mounting scepticsm regarding the guilt of accused witches, espe-cially in cases of demonic possession.23A fourth Scottish possession took place in 1704 in the small coastalburgh of Pittenweem in Fife. Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old blacksmith,experienced bodily convulsions and ‘swooning fits’ reminiscent ofChristian Shaw. His body became distorted and stiff, his back wouldrise up suddenly, and his stomach swelled. When he fell into his fits,he could not be raised up. After complaining that people were pinch-ing him, witnesses saw the imprint of nails where he said he washurting. The resemblance of Morton’s possession to that of Shaw wasnot accidental, since the minister of Pittenweem, Patrick Cowper, hadactually read an account of Christian Shaw’s possession to Mortonwhen he starting falling into his fits.24The possession of ChristianShaw, therefore, had begun to shape the behaviour of demoniacs notonly in the west country but also in an eastern shire that had a historyof intense witch-hunting.Morton’s fits were interpreted first as ‘unusual’ and then as ‘preter-natural’. Like Shaw, Murdoch and Laird, Morton accused several peopleof causing his fits by means of witchcraft. They included Beatrix Laing,170Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 170"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"a woman of ill fame who had been barred from communion and forwhom Morton had refused to make some nails; Janet Cornfoot orCorphat, known as a charmer; Nicolas Lawson, a reputed witch; JanetHorseburgh, the wife of a mariner; and Isobel Adam. Laing, Cornfoot,Lawson, and Adam all produced confessions and named two otherpeople, Thomas Brown and Lillie Wallace, as accomplices. Anotherwoman, Margaret Jack, was also implicated but like Brown, Horseburghand Wallace did not confess.25When Morton made his accusations, the minister and bailies of theburgh imprisoned these seven persons and had them pricked withpins (technically to find the Devil’s mark) and deprived them of sleepin order to obtain their confessions.26The minister also beat them,and in this manner obtained a confession from Janet Cornfoot,including an admission that she had renounced her baptism.27Thiswitch-hunt, however, like the one in the west country in 1699, didnot result in any executions. After the kirk session of Pittenweem andthe presbytery of St Andrews had examined the witches and wit-nesses in June, the burgh of Pittenweem petitioned the privy councilfor a commission of justiciary. On 20 July the lord advocate orderedthe earl of Rothes, the sheriff of Fife, to transport the prisoners toEdinburgh to stand trial there. On 12 August friends of the fiveimprisoned women petitioned to have them released on bond,pending their transportation to Edinburgh.28The examination beforethe lord advocate apparently took place in November 1704.29Acontemporary pamphlet claimed that the witches were released whenit was determined that their confessions were false and that PatrickMorton was a cheat. This pamphlet also alleged that when theaccused witches were released, they were each forced to pay the townofficer £8 Scots for their freedom.30In the end the possession of Patrick Morton did take a human toll.One of the witches whom Morton had accused, Thomas Brown, diedfrom hunger in prison, while Janet Cornfoot was lynched by a mobin January 1705 when she returned to Pittenweem. After beingdragged by her heels through the streets and along the shore, her tormentors swung her from a rope extended from a docked ship tothe shore, threw stones at her, beat her with staves, and eventuallypressed her to death by piling stones on a door placed on her chest.Both Brown and Cornfoot were denied Christian burials.31The bailiesreported to the privy council on 15 February that several of the murderers had been imprisoned, but Cowper apparently set them at liberty.32Brian P.

The answer to this question has a great deal to do with Protestant belief, butProtestantism by itself cannot supply the answer. Protestants, no lessthan Catholics, accepted the possibility and reality of demonic posses-sion. Possession did, after all, have a firm foundation in Scripture, thetouchstone of Protestant belief. Christ had exorcised a number ofdemoniacs, and these dispossessions had given rise to charges by hisopponents that he drove them out by the power of Beelzebub, the rulerof the demons.33All the leaders of the Reformation accepted the realityof possession. At times it was uncertain whether they were consideringpossession to be spiritual rather than corporal, such as when Melanch-thon declared it ‘most certain that devils enter into the hearts of somemen and cause frenzy and torment in them’.34The same ambiguity can be found in Luther’s writings, but we do know that Luther onceattempted an exorcism himself.35Calvin rejected the rite of exorcismas a papal relic, arguing further that the age of miracles had passed, buthe did not, as the Jesuit Louis Richeome claimed, deny the reality ofpossession or the possibility of dispossession.36Protestant demonologists, no less than their Catholic counterparts,found a respectable place for possession in their treatises. CertainlyKing James VI of Scotland – a good Calvinist – had no problem with the reality of possession, which he discussed in his treatise onwitchcraft,Daemonologie.37Even Johann Weyer, the great sixteenth-century sceptic regarding witchcraft, acknowledged the reality of possession. Weyer, whose Protestantism was never in doubt, was far more credulous of reported cases of possession than of allegationsof witchcraft. He argued, for instance, that the affliction of nuns in a convent at Wertet in the Spanish Netherlands 1550 should not be attributed to the activity of witches but to direct possession by the Devil.38One must look ahead more than a century, to the publication of the Dutchman Balthasar Bekker’s sceptical The WorldBewitchedin 1691, to see how a Calvinist minister could use biblicalscholarship to undermine the belief in demonic possession as well aswitchcraft.399780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Protestant countries, no less than those that were Catholic, were caughtup in the possession mania. In the northern Lutheran territories ofGermany there were actually more reported cases of possession than inthe southern Catholic regions.40In the towns of south-eastern Franceand Switzerland, Protestant as well as Catholic communities oftenattributed demonic possession to witchcraft. In the late sixteenth andearly seventeenth centuries the staunchly Calvinist republic of Genevaprosecuted numerous witches for allegedly causing the demonicposses-sion of their victims.41And as we shall see, most possession cases in thelate seventeenth century came from Calvinist communities in NewEngland, England, the Dutch Republic and Scotland.One possible explanation for the near absence of reported cases ofdemonic possession in Scotland was a growing suspicion amongScottish ecclesiastical and secular authorities that demonic possessionswere fraudulent. This suspicion developed in the late sixteenth andearly seventeenth centuries, in response to the widely publicised exor-cisms of demoniacs in Catholic countries, especially France. Protestants,who rejected exorcism as a magical ritual and insisted that only thescriptural practice of prayer and fasting could be used to expel demonicspirits, also came to believe that the possessions which had promptedthese exorcisms were themselves staged for the purposes of religiouspropaganda. James VI regarded ‘so manie of them to be counterfitewhich whyl the clergie inuentes for confirming of their rotten religion’.42At the same time Scots learned that fraudulent possessions were notrestricted to Catholic countries. In the years before and after Jamesacceded to the English throne, English churchmen, most notablyRichard Bancroft and Samuel Harsnett, uncovered a number of fraudu-lent possessions that Puritan ministers were exploiting for purposes ofpropaganda, and in 1607 James himself helped them prove that theBerkshire demoniac, Anne Gunter, had also faked her possession.43Well might James’s councillors and churchmen in Scotland have con-cluded that noreports of possessions – Catholic or Protestant, French,English or even Scottish – could be trusted.44There is fragmentary evidence that Scottish authorities did in facttreat reports of possession in their own country with caution duringthe 1620s. The evidence comes from John Maitland, second earl ofLauderdale, during the middle decades of the seventeenth century.Corresponding with the English Presbyterian Richard Baxter in 1659regarding the possessions at Loudun, Lauderdale warned against exces-sive scepticism regarding witchcraft, demonic possession and theexistence of spirits. Lauderdale attributed this scepticism, which heBrian P.

Lauderdale’s fatherand the local minister, John Weems, were both convinced that thiswoman, unlike the nuns at Loudun, was genuinely possessed. To vali-date this claim, Lauderdale’s father and Weems, together with a knightby the name of Forbes46and an unnamed minister from the northwent to visit the woman, whom Lauderdale described as a poor, igno-rant creature. When Weems spoke to Forbes in Latin, saying, ‘Nondumaudivimus spiritum loquentem’ (Now we will hear the spirit speaking),the demoniac, identified by other sources as Margaret Lumsden, said,‘Audis loquentem’ (You hear him speaking). The minister, amazed atthis response, said ‘Miseratur Deus peccatoris’ (God have mercy onsinners), to which Lumsden responded, ‘Die peccatricis, die peccatricis’(The day of the sinner).47Lauderdale was persuaded of the genuinenessof this possession because the woman’s linguistic facility (such as it was)was not displayed during a public exorcism, as often happened in thelarge public dispossessions in France.Lauderdale complained to Baxter that Scottish authorities had givenno credence to this woman’s possession. When Weems had asked theprivy council to declare days of humiliation to relieve her of her suffer-ing, the council brought Lumsden, her mother, and her father-in-lawto Edinburgh for examination, and then denied the request.48Accord-ing to Lauderdale, who in 1659 was still a covenanter, the reason forthis refusal was that the bishops were then in power and would notallow any fasts to be kept. It is more likely that upon examination thecouncil concluded that Lumsford was faking her possession, just likeall those French nuns and English children. Either way, we might con-clude that the reason for the low incidence of demonic possession inScotland during this period was the failure of secular and ecclesiasticalauthorities to take such reports of possession seriously.49IIILauderdale’s correspondence with Baxter reveals a firm belief in thereality of demonic possession. It also served as an early contribution toa discourse regarding the existence of spirits that dominated late seven-174Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 174"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"teenth-century British demonology. I contend that this discourse pro-vides the crucial religious context for explaining the cases of Scottishpossession that appeared toward the end of the seventeenth century.50The discourse made Scottish presbyterian ministers and laymen eagerto find evidence of Satan’s activities on earth, which they found in theafflictions of Christian Shaw, Margaret Laird, Margaret Murdoch andPatrick Morton.The British discourse on the existence of spirits began in the mid-seventeenth century but it intensified in the 1680s with the pub-lication of Saducismus Triumphatusby the English cleric Joseph GlanvillandSatan’s Invisible World Discoveredby George Sinclair, the Scottishnatural philosopher from the University of Glasgow.51Both worksrecounted stories about witchcraft, apparitions, poltergeists and otherpreternatural phenomena in order to counter the claims of the so-called sadducees, the seventeenth-century name given to those whodenied the existence of spirits.52Ultimately they were designed to provethe existence of God, for if one did not believe in spirits, the belief inGod would likewise vanish. As Henry More, one of Glanvill’s allies, putit: ‘No spirit, no God’.53The battle between the sadducees and their opponents entered a newphase in 1691 when Baxter, the English Presbyterian minister who hadcorresponded with Lauderdale in 1659, published The Certainty of theWorlds of Spirits.Baxter’s entrance into the debate was significant forour purposes because he used many more instances of demonic posses-sion than either Glanvill or Sinclair to prove the existence of spirits.Glanvill and Sinclair had emphasised poltergeists, ghost stories, andespecially reports of witchcraft. Baxter, however, turned the reader’sattention to possession, including Lauderdale’s story and countlessother episodes of possession throughout Europe. These included thestory of Mary Hill, an 18-year-old girl from Beckington who vomitedup no fewer than 200 pins and whose tongue swelled out of her mouth;a woman believed to be hysterical until she vomited long crookednails, brass needles, and lumps of hair and meat; a 15-year-old girlfrom Louvain who in 1571 vomited 24 pounds of liquid a day, fol-lowed by the dung of geese and doves, hair, coal and stones; and thedemoniac reported by Sebastian Brand who in one year vomited enoughblood to fill 400 chamber pots. Baxter also mentioned Cotton Mather’srecently-published apocalyptic book, Memorable Providences Relating toWitchcrafts and Possessions (1689), which presented an account of thepossession of the Goodwin children in Boston. Mather saw this andother possessions as signs that the rule of Satan was in its final daysBrian P.

Demonic possession provided much morecertain proof of the existence of spirits than either witchcraft or polter-geists, because in possessions one could actually hear the Devil speakand witness the bodily movements he controlled. Baxter’s book alsohad the effect of giving the debate over the existence of spirits a denom-inational character. During the 1690s, as the controversy over spiritsintensified, the anti-sadducees – those who accepted the reality of pos-sessions and witchcraft – tended increasingly to be English dissenters,New England puritans, and Scottish presbyterians.During the 1690s there were plenty of new narratives that the anti-sadducees could use to bolster their position. First there was the episodeof possession at Salem, which had led to the execution of 19 personsfor witchcraft in 1692. The first narrative of the case, by Deodat Lawson,appeared in that year, and it was followed by Cotton Mather’s Wondersof the Invisible World.55Then there was the case of the ‘Surey demo-niac’, Richard Dugdale, a teenage gardener from Lancashire who beganto experience fits in 1689 and who testified to the reality of his ownpossession in 1695. Dugdale’s affliction became the subject of a majorcontroversy which peaked in 1697 with the publication of a narrativeof his possession, urged by the ‘believers of Satan’s activating men’sbodies by possession, witchcrafts, etc. ... as a very likely expedient forrooting out atheism, debauchery, sadducism, and devilishness’.56Thispamphlet elicited a sadducean rejoinder from Zachary Taylor, The SurryImpostor, taking the position that the whole thing was a hoax.57It is of crucial importance to appreciate the fact that the possessionof Christian Shaw occurred in the midst of this controversy and that itwas immediately seen as evidence of the anti-sadducean, presbyterianposition. No sooner had the Paisley witches been executed than anumber of pamphlets describing the case began to appear, includingan anonymous account, A True Narrative of the Sufferings and Relief of aYoung Girle, published in Edinburgh in 1698.This work has been attrib-uted to Francis Grant, later Lord Cullen, the lawyer who prosecuted thePaisley witches, with the assistance of John MacGilchrist, a Glasgowsolicitor who was Christian’s uncle.58The polemical purpose of A TrueNarrativewas clearly indicated in the preface, which used Shaw’s posses-sion to affirm the existence of God. Its purpose is also revealed by thetitle of the London edition of this work,Saducismus Debellatus(SadducismConquered).59176Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 176"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The publication of A True Narrativelinked Shaw’s possessions toothers that were reported in the same year, especially that of SarahFowles, an English woman from Hammersmith, who in 1698 claimedto be possessed by the Devil and was accused in print of being animpostor.60In Scotland the narrative of Christian Shaw’s possessionalso prompted the possessions of Margaret Laird and Margaret Murdochin 1699 and Patrick Morton at Pittenweem in 1704. The author of oneof the published accounts of the Pittenweem witchcraft trials not onlycompared Morton’s affliction to that of Christian Shaw but also putthe episode to the same use, ‘for proving the existence of good and evilspirits’.61Seen in this context, the sudden and belated appearance of cases ofpossession in Scotland at the end of the 1690s and the first prosecu-tions of witches for causing demonic possession in Scottish historybegin to make sense. In the late 1690s the debate over the existence ofspirits, reinforced by a growing belief in Scotland that the SecondComing was near, created a determination among Protestant ministersand pious laymen to look for evidence of Satan’s activities on earth.They found it in the demonic possession of Christian Shaw and herimitators. The recent ecclesiastical changes that had occurred in thewake of the Glorious Revolution certainly gave them unprecedentedconfidence that such possessions would not be ignored or dismissed, ashad happened with the possession of Margaret Lumsden in 1629. Thedecision by the government to proceed with the prosecution of the student Thomas Aikenhead for blasphemy and atheism in 1696, to the horror of all religious sceptics and most English observers, gave them further cause for hope that latter-day sadducees would not succeed in sapping Scottish society of its Christian vitality.62This interpretation of Scotland’s belated initiation into the age ofdemonic possession63still leaves unanswered the question how thepossession of Christian Shaw began. When scholars study cases ofdemonic possession, they often try to discover what was reallygoingon. Dismissing the possibility that these afflicted people might havebeen actually possessed by demons, they usually offer one of twoexplanations. The first is that the demoniacs were impostors, who fakedthe symptoms of possession in order to bring attention to themselves,use the excuse that they were under the Devil’s influence to violateestablished social and moral norms, or retaliate against enemies byaccusing them of witchcraft.64The other explanation is that the demo-niacs were afflicted by some kind of medical disorder, such as hysteriaor schizophrenia.Brian P.

The charge that she was the‘Bargarran impostor’, who deliberately swallowed the objects she regur-gitated, originated in the eighteenth century and is still widely heldtoday.65The medical interpretation of what was reallybotheringChristian has been just as durable; only a few years ago Christian wasposthumously diagnosed as having been afflicted by a conversion dis-order, a trance disorder, a transient psychotic disorder, or childhoodepilepsy.66Christian Shaw may have been faking some of her symptoms andshe also may have been afflicted by some sort of medical disorder. Theimportant consideration is that by behaving as a demoniac Christianwas conforming to widely acknowledged norms of demonic behav-iour.67Demoniacs in all societies act the way in which their religiousculture tells them they should act. Either consciously or unconsciouslythey learn how to act like possessed persons. Just like the French demo-niac Marthe Brossier who in 1599 modelled her behaviour on that ofNicole Obry at Laon in 1566, and just like Anne Gunter who imitatedthe convulsions of the possessed Throckmorton children in 1593,Christian Shaw was following a script encoded in seventeenth-centuryreligious life. Like them she learned this script either by reading aboutother possessions (something many demoniacs did) or through instruc-tion from her parents and ministers. Whether ill or not, whether dupli-citous or not, Christian was playing her appointed role in a religiousdrama of the utmost importance to those around her.68Part of the role assigned to Christian in her deeply Protestant culturewas to struggle against the temptation, presented by the demons whopossessed her, to become a witch herself. Demonologists often made adistinction between demoniacs and witches on the grounds that posses-sion, unlike witchcraft, was an involuntary condition and was not con-sidered sinful or criminal.69The demoniac, unlike the witch, was notheld responsible for her actions, which often included unconventional,rebellious, or immoral behaviour.70In early modern possessions this dis-tinction between demoniac and witch occasionally became blurred.71Madeleine Bavent, one of the nuns believed to have been possessed atLouviers, Normandy in the 1640s, was accused of practising sorcery,attending sabbats, and copulating with devils. In Lutheran Germanysome demoniacs were reported to have made pacts with the Devil,72while in Puritan New England a fear arose that demoniacs, if not dis-possessed, would themselves become witches.73In Sweden two femaledemoniacs were accused of blasphemy before the king’s council in9780230_507883_09_cha07.pdf 19/10/07 9:52 AM Page 178"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"1690 and 1708 respectively ‘for having let Satan take their body in possession’.74Christian Shaw withstood these temptations to fall into witchcraft;she refused to renounce her baptism and attend the Devil’s meetings.75Her edifying struggle against Satanic temptation, made possible byGod’s freely granted grace, was her own personal, Protestant version ofexorcism – a ritualised combat or spiritual warfare that resulted in herdispossession. In 1696 Christian’s personal triumph also provided con-clusive evidence to contemporaries that the sadducees were wrong –that the Devil did in fact exist, and that in Scotland, where Satan‘shows the greatest malice and where he is hated and hateth most’, thereign of Satan was nearing an end.76Notes1 These episodes were not restricted to Christian communities.

This is quite understandable. Although their activities wereconsidered by many secular and ecclesiastical officials as either implic-itly or explicitly diabolic, with some theologians asserting that theywere as much of a threat to Christian society as witches, they werenever prosecuted in significant numbers. Consequently there are fewerdetailed records regarding them and their activities. Yet they appearfairly frequently in the stories told by witnesses in witchcraft trials.Furthermore the ecclesiastical courts kept a close eye on both practi-tioners of magic and their clients.Scotland is no great exception to this general picture. Yet a comparativeperspective does highlight several distinctive areas regarding the legalposition of Scottish cunning-folk, their activities and their clients.Because of the paucity of trial pamphlets in Scotland and other relevantliterary sources, at first glance the task of researching the subject seemslimited by comparison with England. But for reasons which will becomeobvious later, Scotland has a rich body of relevant court material, whilethe vogue for ‘touring’ the Highlands during the late seventeenth andeighteenth centuries led to the recording of detailed ethnographic dataon magical practices.1The work of nineteenth-century folklorists also pro-vides valuable contextual information for understanding popular magicin the early modern period. Furthermore, the task of identifying cunning-folk in the Scottish archives has recently been made a lot easier thanks tothe online Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, while Joyce Miller’s innovativework on seventeenth-century folk healing provides an important founda-tion for future research.2The time is ripe for Scottish cunning-folk andcharmers to assume a more prominent place in the history of the witchtrials and popular culture more generally.9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"IThe terms ‘charmer’ and ‘charming’ were used in the Scottish courtrecords and other sources to denote those acts of magic that did notcause harm but were nevertheless ‘superstitious’ and sinful in the eyes ofthe authorities. As a category of offence then it was distinguishable from‘witchcraft’.3This distinction between good and bad magic undoubtedlymirrored popular perceptions, although at a popular level charming wasnot considered as ‘superstitious’. Yet in the court records the distinctionwas not always made. A number of the items of healing in ThomasGrieve’s dittay of 1623, for example, were not described as charming butin such terms as ‘cureing, by devillerie and Witchcraft’, which moreaccurately reflected the Calvinistic conception of popular magic.4As well as this complication, the label ‘charmer’ has, in the English andScottish sources and current historiography, been used as a blanket termfor all those who practised some form of beneficial magic. Work onEnglish and Welsh popular magic in both early modern and modernperiods reveals, however, that the popular usage of the term ‘charmer’applied to specific types of healer.5Was the same distinction made inScottish popular discourse as well? A full consideration of this would alsoneed to take into account the different terminology used in the GaelicHighlands. English historians have consistently conflated the termscunning-folk and charmers, which has led to misleading statementsbeing made about popular magic, and the generic use of charmer todescribe Scottish magical practitioners has similar potential to obfuscateboundaries of practice.In England and Wales ‘charmers’, also called ‘blessers’ and ‘touchers’depending on their practices, were rarely professional healers. They hadlimited and specific healing powers conferred on them either by birth-right (such as being a seventh son or daughter), by the possession of heal-ing objects, or most commonly the possession or knowledge of simplewritten or oral healing charms which were often traditionally passed oncontra-sexually, from male to female and vice versa. Their powers orknowledge were usually restricted to simple natural ailments such as scro-fula, jaundice, toothache, bleeding, sprains, snakebites and the like. Theyrarely cured supernaturally inspired illnesses, and rarely offered diagnoses,though some also prepared herbal remedies. They had only modest, sup-posedly God-given powers and generally practised according to a tra-dition of altruism. No money was accepted, though a gift in kind wasacceptable if given freely. These characteristics of the charmer also applyto the tradition in France as well.6In contrast cunning-folk, who were186Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"also known in parts of England as wise-men and wise-women, conjurorsand wizards, usually made a supplementary income from magic or livedentirely on the proceeds. They offered a comprehensive range of magicalservices including love magic, thief detection, fortune-telling, astrology,herbalism and unbewitching. As well as these two categories, which werenot always hard and fast, there were fortune-tellers, often itinerants, whoseskills were restricted to one or other of the various divinatory arts, such aspalmistry or cartomancy. Finally, there were petty healers who earned afew pence treating ailments, including witchcraft, using herbs or a healingritual, but did not offer any of the other services provided by cunning-folk.From this brief synopsis it should be obvious why the Scottish applicationof ‘charmer’ and ‘charming’ is problematic in a comparative context.An examination of early modern Scottish trial material indicates thatsimilar categories of magical practice existed both in a terminologicaland more obviously in a practical sense. Regarding the former, the term‘wise-woman’, commonly used in northern England, also appears in theScottish records. In 1597 Christian Lewinston was referred to as a ‘wyise-woman’, a ‘wyise wyffe and a woman of skill’, while Agnes Sampson,tried in 1591, was reported as being popularly known as the ‘wyse wyffof Keyth’, which suggests that a popular distinction was indeed madebetween simple charmers and multi-faceted cunning-folk.7Regarding theevidence of practice, the nineteenth-century ethnographic record con-tains a wealth of simple healing charms, some of which are common toEurope and some that are more geographically limited and demanddetailed comparative analysis. All that can be done in this short space isto pick out a few early modern examples that tend to confirm that therewas a distinct category of ‘charmer’ in the English sense.The verse against sprains used by the Orkney charmer Catherine Carriein 1616, which went: ‘bone to bone, synnew to synnew, and flesche toflesche, and bluid to bluid’,8is a classic type which usually began withChrist’s mishap when riding, as used by Janet Brown in 1643:Our Lord forth raide;His foal’s foot slade;Our Lord down lighted;His foal’s foot righted;Saying Flesh to Flesh, blood to blood,And bane to baneIn our Lord his name.9This is one of the oldest recorded healing charms, recorded acrosswestern and eastern Europe.10It was enacted through oral utteranceOwen Davies1879780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"and has also been recorded in Gaelic, where St Columba sometimestakes the place of Christ in the story.11In Scotland the charmer wouldsometimes tie a piece of thread around the injured part while murmur-ing the verse. Similar European healing formulae were also undoubt-edly in use in early modern Scotland; the casgadh folafor staunchingblood, for example. In his account of the western isles of 1695, MartinMartin wrote about the process of charming for ‘excessive bleeding,either in man or beast’, ‘which is performed by sending the name ofthe patient to the charmer, who adds some more words to it, and afterrepeating those words the cure is performed’.12Katherine Craigie, exe-cuted in 1643 for healing and bewitching, confessed to having ‘learneda charme for stemming of blood’ from her husband.13The words inboth cases may have been similar to the formula for staunchingrecorded by Mackenzie in the nineteenth century.14Just as in theEnglish tradition, it was crucial that the staunching charmer knew the name of the person or beast concerned. As well as the possessors ofsuch charms we also find seventh sons such as George Beir, broughtbefore the Haddington presbytery in 1646 for curing the King’s evil(scrofula), and the laird who owned the famed curative ‘Lee Penny’ towhom the sons of Isobel Young applied to cure their cattle of the‘rotting evil’.15On this evidence, and more particularly on that from the laterethnographic sources, several distinct healing traditions seem to haveoperated in early modern Scotland. Consequently the use of ‘charmer’should have a more restrictive usage than it has currently, and eventhough the term ‘cunning-folk’ was not used in Scotland, I still think itserves as a useful term of reference. It defines a distinctive group ofpractitioners, and from a comparative perspective it is a category usedby historians and folklorists to describe similar multifarious practition-ers of magic elsewhere in Europe.16IIThe 1563 Scottish statute against ‘using witchcraftis, sorsarie andnecromancie’ appeared in the same year as the more detailed Englishact ‘against conjurations, enchantments, and witchcrafts’, though,as Julian Goodare’s textual analysis shows, it was not inspired byit.17The Scottish statute was much briefer than the English one, andwas more directly inspired by Calvinist thinking in a country whichhad only officially become reformed three years earlier. A textual com-parison is revealing in terms of the Scottish statute’s interpretation and188Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"implementation in relation to cunning-folk and other magical practi-tioners. It was directed against ‘the heavy and abominable superstitionused by divers of the lieges of this realm’ and for ‘avoiding and away-putting of all such vain superstition in times to come’. Larner interpretedthis usage of ‘superstition’ as indicating a degree of scepticism – that itimplied witchcraft and magical practices were considered as deceits byits authors.18This would set it in contrast to the wording and thrust ofthe English Statute and laws elsewhere in Europe where the offenceslisted are obviously considered real, and not just sinful pretences. ButPeter Maxwell-Stuart and Lawrence Normand and Gareth Robertspresent a more accurate contextual reading of the use of ‘superstition’,seeing it in its Reformation context as denoting ‘pagan or idolatrousreligion’, interpretable in terms of diabolism and adherence to Catholicbeliefs and practices.19This makes much more sense. Scottish cunning-folk and charmers, just like their counterparts in other Protestantregions, were seen as being promoters of Catholic practices. There was,indeed, some justification for this. In 1657, for example, Adam Reidwas reported to the kirk session of Logierait for having ‘ane crucifixwhich people use to borrow when any thinge is stolne from them ...which makes people feare it and reverence it’. Reid was ordered tohand over the crucifix, which he did reluctantly, and it was broken inthe presence of the session.20A more common ‘Catholic’ problem forthe kirk was the continued popular resort to healing and divinatory wells,which were often dedicated to the saints.21In terms of content the English and Scottish statutes differed in twosignificant respects. First, in the Scottish statute there was no attemptto differentiate between the types of magical act that were seen as mostproblematic, whereas the Elizabethan statute clearly defined the crimesof theft detection, love magic, treasure conjuration, and the destruc-tion of people or their goods, in other words witchcraft. Laws else-where, the Carolina Code of the Holy Roman Empire in particular, alsorecognised the difference between maleficiumand someone who usedwitchcraft ‘without causing injury’, and allowed for judges to deal outpunishments based on the ‘magnitude of the crime’, often fines, ban-ishment and branding rather than death. Even when the law deter-mined equally harsh penalties for good and bad magic, as in Englandor the province of Holland, judges were not inclined to implement the full force of the law. In Western Europe beneficial magic was hardly ever punished to the same degree as witchcraft.22The Scottishstatute makes no such distinctions at all. Witchcraft and beneficialmagic were just treated as one undifferentiated capital crime, whichOwen Davies1899780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"certainly accurately reflected Calvinist theological thinking. As JulianGoodare has suggested, the Statute expressed a preoccupation with thepernicious influence of those who offered magical services rather thanwithmaleficium, for the act was primarily conceived as a Reformistweapon against Catholicism and the ‘superstitions’ it had inculcatedinto the people rather than witches.23Although in theory, then, cunning-folk and charmers in Scotlandwere equally if not more prone to secular prosecution and execution aswitches, in practice there was no large-scale persecution. They make uponly a very small percentage of the 3,837 or more people known tohave been accused of witchcraft and magic before the Scottish secularand ecclesiastical courts. It would seem that the courts interpreted thestatute according to different concerns and demands to those motivat-ing its author. Still, the secular trial records reveal a significantly moreprominent emphasis on healing magic than is discernible in England,the Dutch Republic and parts of France, for example, which may in partbe a result of the generic wording of the Scottish statute. In England,cunning-folk were very occasionally tried under the Elizabethan Act fortreasure seeking and thief detection, but never for unbewitching. Theirrole as healers and diviners was fairly frequently brought up inciden-tally in depositions, but it did not become part of the indictment. InScotland it did. The classic example of this is the case of Agnes Sampson,who was tried and executed in 1591. Of the 53 charges brought againsther over half concerned healing and divination. Item 21, for example,concerned ‘the healing of the laird of Reidshill’s son by witchcraft,whom the chirurgeons had given over’, and Item 27 for curing a childby ‘gripping him and speaking some words of charming’.24As well asbewitching the horses of Donald Ronaldson and magically breaking amiller’s wheel, Isobel Strachan was also tried in 1597 for successfullycuring Alexander Cruickshank’s sheep and other acts of healing.25Ofthe 22 items against John Burgh in 1643, five concerned maleficiumwhile the rest were cases of healing such as that conducted on a stirkbelonging to Thomas Gibson, ‘by applying of wort and walgrase [i.e.watercress] soddin together, and using of certain charms’.26Even more striking is the fact that at least a handful of Scottishcunning-folk were tried and executed solely on the basis of beneficialmagic. Across Europe cunning-folk were hardly ever executed except whenthey were charged with maleficiumor satanic pacts. In Robin Briggs’sanalysis of 380 accused witches in Lorraine only two were prosecuted forhealing alone, and only one of these was executed, primarily because hewas charged with making a tacit pact with the devil.27So the Scottish190Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"experience seems unusual. Take the case of Thomas Grieve for example.None of the 14 items in his dittay of 1623 concerned accusations ofmaleficiumor satanic relations. Instead they included a variety of harmlesssounding healing rituals.28Alexander Drummond was executed forsimilar crimes in 1629. Seventeen years later the king was petitioned toclear his name, as he was ‘ane notable Christian and did all his wondrouscures by lawfull meanes’.29John Philips was likewise tried and executed in1631. All the items in his dittay concerned beneficial magic, with his spe-ciality being the ritual ‘washing’ of those bewitched. He was convicted asa ‘sorcerar and charmare and illudare of the people ... he knew that hiswashingis and wateris he useit haid done great evill’.30Why did people like Grieve, Philips and Drummond end up beingtried and executed when all their actions were aimed at reversing witch-craft, at restoring health? Cunning-folk certainly had disgruntled clientswho paid significant sums for cures and advice that ultimately came tonothing, but would they really want to see them executed? I doubt it. Thegeneric wording of the 1563 statute has already been noted, but there aretwo further factors that help explain the Scottish experience. First, we canpoint to the importance of what Julian Goodare describes as the ‘har-monious co-operation’ between the kirk and the privy council.31It wasrarely the clients or general populace that pursued such serious prose-cutions: it was the local minister. The clergy played an important role inthe secular system of justice in Scotland for much of the early modernperiod. The decision of the privy council to instigate local commissions totry witches was often based on reports and witness testimonies gatheredby presbyteries and kirk sessions. Unlike the laity, the desire of ministersto see the back of cunning-folk is quite understandable. It is no wonderthat John Philips ‘fledd’ one parish ‘for feare of Mr William Steinsoun,minister thaire’.32The trail of documents relating to the arrest and trial ofAlexander Drummond is revealing in this respect. It would appear thatthe origins of his prosecution lay not in a complaint lodged by a clientbut in the presbytery of Muthill. It was they who wrote a supplication tothe central secular authorities in January 1629 to take action against himas a:Notorious abuser of Gods peopill in any places of this kingdome bycharmes, inchantments and uther divellish and unlaufull meanes,and by the gritt concurse of all sorts of peopill, who upon report ofhis fame (which hes lasted more nor fyftie years) did resort to him... [he] did sett up ane publict seat of abuse in dispyt both of kirkand cuntrey.33Owen Davies1919780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 191"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Subsequently the privy council sent out a warrant for the collection oftestimony against Drummond, ordering the brethren of the two localpresbyteries to find persons ‘who can give some light and informationanent the said Alexander’, and ‘to examine them and set down therdepositions formally in writing’.34Similarly the presbytery of Perthpursued the prosecution of the healer Bessie Wright. She had been cen-sured by the kirk session in 1611 and 1626 for healing, and the pres-bytery finally lost patience with her in 1628 and on 30 July wrote tothe clerk of the privy council calling for a commission to try her forbeing ‘an abuser of the people’, for ‘whatever charme is done by her allis done under the pretext and cullour of physicke’.35It would seem,then, that in Scotland both national and local authorities occasionallytook it upon themselves to hunt down and exterminate individualcunning-folk – at least until the mid-seventeenth century.The tragic history of Drummond, and others like him, is neverthelessexceptional. Throughout the period most complaints of ‘superstitious’practices levelled at petty healers, cunning-folk and charmers went nofurther than the presbytery, and some ministers and kirk sessions weremore active than others in persecuting them. In 1665, for example, thesynod of St Andrews criticised the brethren of Meigle for not actingagainst Robert Small and those who consulted him for ‘things lost orstollen’, and so appointed the brethren of Dunfermline to collect evid-ence of his healing and detection activities.36Yet the Kirk persevered in its campaign to suppress magical practitioners and practices right up to the mid-eighteenth century – many years after other ProtestantChurches had lost interest. The ecclesiastical courts had given up deal-ing with the problem by the mid-seventeenth century in England, andby the end of the century in Sweden and the Dutch Republic.The second explanation for the significant number of items regard-ing healing in dittays concerns the popular belief that the act ofremoving witchcraft entailed its transferral to another person oranimal. This is a classic example of the theory of limited good. Oneperson’s good fortune must result in someone else’s bad luck.According to this way of thinking an act of witchcraft, unless removedby the initiating witch, had to run its course. The only way of remov-ing it was to pass it on to someone else or more usually something elseof lesser value. There are numerous examples of this in the courtrecords, such as the case of John Neill, convicted and burnt in 1631.Nearly all the items in Neill’s dittay concerned healing, and a numberof his actions resulted in the transferral of the disease. One item con-cerned the ‘cureing by sorcery and witchcraft of Helene Wedderlie’ by192Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"taking away her ‘grievous sickness’ and placing it ‘upon IssobellNeische’.37Isobel Young was accused of curing Alison Paterson of a‘grievous disease’ and laying the ‘same sickness’ upon James Liddell.38One item in John Philip’s dittay states: ‘for charming of Andro Clerk inFyntray by casting the seiknes aff of him and putting it upon aneoxe’.39Within this tradition of healing, then, to unbewitch was tobewitch. As a result cunning-folk faced a real risk of being accused ofmaleficium. One way around the problem of transferral to humans orlivestock was to transfer the disease or spell to water instead, whichwould symbolically and physically wash the witchcraft away. But eventhis had its pitfalls as illustrated by the following two cases. To cure thechild of Andrew Duncan, Isobel Haldane washed its shirt in somewater in the name of the Trinity and then took both to a stream andthrew them in. On the way, however, she reproached herself for havingspilt some of the water, knowing that if anyone passed over it thedisease would be passed to them rather than being washed away in thestream.40The dangers were realised when John Philips, performing asimilar cure, dumped the water outside only for a cat to run across it.The cat went mad and immediately attacked the nearest man.Another key difference between the English and Scottish statutes hadvery serious ramifications for the ‘cunning-trade’. Under the ScottishAct those who consultedmagical practitioners, of whatever shade, wereequally guilty of a capital offence. No person should:seek any help, response, or consultation at any such users or abusersaforesaid of witchcrafts, sorceries or necromancy. Under the pain ofdeath as well to be execute against the user, abuser, as the seeker of the response or consultation.In England there were no secular laws against the consultation of suchpeople, although an attempt was made to criminalise it during theRump Parliament (1648–53).41It was left to the ecclesiastical author-ities to deal with those who committed the sinful act of consultingmagical practitioners, just as it was throughout much of Protestant andCatholic Europe. The punishments meted out were penance, fines andoccasionally excommunication.The crime of consultation was rarely prosecuted.42Cases usually onlyconcerned accusations of paying mercenary bewitchers, and normallyinvolved land-owning social groups intriguing over inheritance andproperty. Some of the early cases were similar to the claims and fears ofpolitical sorcery, murder and conspiracy that, in England, inspiredOwen Davies1939780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Henry VIII’s Conjuration Statute of 1542. These included the trial in1577 of Katherine Ross (Lady Foulis) accused of employing ‘witches’ toperform image magic, and the trial in 1596 of John Stewart, accused ofhiring Alison Balfour to use magic to murder his brother the earl of Orkney. Lower down the social scale, family squabbles and land disputes also led to similar ‘consultations’, as in the 1586 case of afarming family named the Findlaws who hired Tibbie Smart to murderby witchcraft the Reid family, with whom they had a vicious feud.43Such cases of consultation not surprisingly led to the prosecution ofthose being consulted as well, and from the trial material it is clear thatat least a few of these were cunning-folk who practised maleficiumaspart of their commercial services. This may seem surprising, and it wasobviously a dangerous trade to deal in, but it was only a small stepfrom paying cunning-folk to torment witches and thieves to askingthem to cast harmful spells on other enemies. The English evidencesuggests, however, that this was not a common request and mostcunning-folk were wisely reluctant to trade in bewitching.44There were a few trials concerning consultation for services otherthan bewitching. In 1634, for example, a farmer named George Fraserand his wife were accused of consulting two cunning-men, John Philipsand Walter Baird, to help them charm animals and to improve their oatcrop by magic.45But such cases usually remained a ‘moral’ crime reportedby ministers, dealt with by kirk sessions and presbyteries. The paucity ofsuch cases shows that in practice secular and ecclesiastical officials clearlydifferentiated between the relative heinousness of the range of crimesencompassed by the 1563 statute, and were usually disinclined to treatconsultation as an act worthy of secular attention. As with witchcraft, ofcourse, accusations of consultation were occasionally made maliciously.The case against George Fraser seems to have been so inspired. Yet, con-sidering the extent to which people resorted to cunning-folk and charm-ers, or conducted their own healing or divinatory rituals, if the letter ofthe law had been strictly adhered to the majority of the Scottish popula-tion would have been liable to execution.IIIThe detection of stolen or lost property was an important aspect of thebusiness of both cunning-folk and those who merely practised fortune-telling. The few English cases were usually handled by the quarter sessions rather than treated as capital crimes to be heard before a judgeat the assizes. Parochial authorities evidently felt uncomfortable about194Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 194"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"invoking the full force of the law. This situation would seem to have beenmirrored in Scotland as well. The cases against the ‘vagabond’ DonaldMacIlmichael, hanged in 1677 for ‘corresponding with the devil forseveral years giving himself to have skill of discoverie and finding out alllost goods by which he was guilty of cheating and abusing ignorantpeople’, initially came before the Argyll authorities only as a subsidiarycrime to that of being involved with a gang of cattle and horse thieves.46Further research is needed to see whether such diviners were more likelyto be charged under the Vagrancy Acts, such as that of 1575, whichincluded ‘knawledge in physnomie, palmestre, or utheris abused sciencis’,and carried a lesser penalty.47However, it was certainly dealt with fre-quently enough by the kirk sessions, which were not inclined to sendthem on to the privy council. In 1671 it was reported to the kirk sessionof Yester that people were in the habit of consulting a man in theCanongate of Edinburgh who charged a small fee for detecting stolengoods. The Canongate kirk session dealt with a similar or the same man, aweaver named John Turnbull, who was charged with ‘using devilish andunlawful ways for discovery of theft’.48In November 1707 the Glencairnsession rigorously questioned a renowned detector of stolen and lostproperty named Alexander Dewart, a gardener of Maxwellton. The kirksession charged him with restoring stolen goods by:Charm or enchantment or some other pretended occult quality inherbs, along with some mutterings and gestures, as makes him socommonly reputed a charmer that he is sought unto by personsfrom divers corners of the country to the great scandal of religion.49He explained that he put the herbs under his head and dreamed of thewhereabouts of the stolen property. He refused to say what the herbswere: ‘I will not tell that to any living if they should saw me asunder’. Thepopularity of thief detection and ministers’ frustration with it is evidentfrom the fact that both diviners and their clients continued to be hauledbefore the sessions for the misdemeanour into the 1730s.50The belief that the deaf and dumb were somehow compensated forby the possession of occult powers seems to have been strong inScotland. In the mid-seventeenth century the Haddington presbyterywere informed of a ‘dumb boy’ of Ormiston and a dumb woman ofPencaitland who were consulted for stolen goods.51In 1678 the minis-ter of Lasswade informed the Dalkeith presbytery that some of hisparishioners had consulted a dumb man residing in the Edinburgh cor-rection house regarding the discovery of some missing money.52TheOwen Davies1959780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"tradition was maintained into the nineteenth century. James Napier,writing in 1879, knew of an itinerant deaf and dumb fortune-tellerwho travelled around the villages of western Scotland with his slateand a piece of chalk, and commented that such people ‘were consid-ered to possess something like second-sight’.53As well as an innate giftof foresight, mechanical divinatory methods such as palmistry seem tohave been fairly common practices, and were employed by cunning-folk, fortune-tellers and the general public alike. The sieve and shearswas one such thief detection ritual recorded in much of Europe. Thesieve was either balanced on some shears or the shears were stuck intothe rind of the sieve, and then following an appeal to the Holy Trinityor St Peter and St Paul the names of those suspected were called outand the sieve would turn at the mention of the guilty party. As inEngland, people were periodically punished for employing it inScotland. In 1649 Margaret Monro was brought before the Dingwallpresbytery for ‘charming’ by ‘turning of the seive and the sheir’. Thesame year the Kingarth kirk session dealt with another case. The fol-lowing year the Dunkeld presbytery questioned a woman if she hadattended ‘a meeting for turning of the riddle for some money shewanted [i.e. had lost] and a silver spoon 15 years since’.54Love magic, again a staple of the cunning-folk’s trade, which involvedeither divining and identifying future spouses or using charms andpotions to draw someone’s love, crops up several times in the courtrecords. In his dossier on the activities of Isobel Strachan in 1597, theminister of Dyce said ‘she was a common marriage maker’. Isobel wasreported to have told one woman, ‘Thow knows what good I have donein this parish to sundrie, in causing them marry who would not other-wise have done’. When the wife of Walter Ronaldson consulted Isobelabout her husband’s habit of beating her, she took several pieces of paper,sewed them together with different coloured threads, and buried them in the barn among some corn. ‘From then on Walter did never strike hiswife or found fault with her’.55Amongst the charges against HelenIsbister, tried in Orkney in 1635, was that she magically arranged a mar-riage against a bridegroom’s will.56In 1640 Katherine Craigie was chargedwith telling Isobel Craigie that if she desired Harry Bellenden for a hus-band she would provide her with a certain grass, ‘which being usit at mydirectioun it will cause Harie Bellanden never to have ane other womanbut your self’.57With regard to healing, there were numerous ways of tacklingdisease and illness, whether inspired by witchcraft or not. As elsewhereherbs were widely used by Scottish cunning-folk and other healers.196Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 196"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Christian Lewinston prescribed that one patient be bathed with rednettles and lovage, and be rubbed with lovage and butter. For heart sick-ness she told a client to drink broom and camomile in white wine.Another healer gave a bewitched man a herbal drink mixed with butterand saffron.58The use of threads was another common feature. Thiseither involved tying thread around the affected part of the body orpassing the sick person or animal through a skein of yarn. Thomas Grievecured William Beveridge of a ‘grevous seiknes’ by making him passthrough the yarn several times and then burning it in a big fire. JohnPhilips was also accused of ‘charming’ Gilbert Leslie by putting himthrough the yarn, though he denied it.59The use of water from holy wellsand south-running streams or rivers was also a prominent feature ofScottish healing. Grieve cured David Chalmer by making him wear a shirtwashed in south-running water and making certain crosses and signs overhim. Isobel Haldane washed one child in water she had brought insilence from the Well of Ruthen.60An intriguing and highly unusualritual use of hot stones to divine and cure also appears several times inthe trial records. I have found no parallels elsewhere to the techniqueemployed by Katherine Craigie to treat the husband of Janet Craigie. Sheplaced three stones, representing a hill spirit, water spirit and a kirk spirit,in a fire. She left them there to bake for a whole day and then after sunsetplaced them under the threshold of the door overnight. Before sunriseshe took up the stones, still hot presumably, and placed them in a vesselfull of water. From examining the reaction she declared, ‘it is a kirk spiritwhich troubleth Robbie your husband’. She was then directed to washher husband with water from the vessel. James Knarston, prosecuted in1633, performed a variation of the same ritual.61Another distinctive magical practice advised by cunning-folk andwidely employed concerned the live burial of an animal, usually an ox,as a means of curing the sick. Alexander Drummond was charged with‘burieng a quick [i.e. live] ox for effectuating his sorcerie’. Churchconcern over the practice is evident from the records of the Dingwallpresbytery. In 1656 the minister of Lochcarron and Applecross declaredsome of his parishioners to be ‘superstitious, especiallie in sacrificeing atcertaine tymes at the Loche of Mourie’. A presbytery investigationconfirmed that people were ‘accustomed to sacrifice bulls’. Twenty-twoyears later Hector Mackenzie in Mellan, two of his sons and a grandsonwere summoned before the presbytery for ‘sacrificing a bull in ane hea-thenish manner, in the iland of St Ruffus ... for the recovering of healthof Cirstane Mackenzie, spouse to the said Hector Mackenzie’.62Theburial of a live cock was also employed in cases of insanity and epilepsy,Owen Davies1979780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 197"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"and by implication the witchcraft to which both conditions were oftenattributed. In 1657 Christian Lewinston apparently performed this ritual,and it was still resorted to during the nineteenth century.63As well as itsuse in curing humans, animal burial was also commonly used to counterlivestock disease. In 1650 a ‘poore woman’ named Margaret Dow wassummoned before the kirk sessions for ‘sorcerie by burieing a lamb underthe threshold’, which she justified by explaining that it was a ‘preventa-tive against the death of the rest of her bestiall’.64Six years later, four menwere disciplined by the Dunkeld presbytery for ‘using of a charm, to wit,the putting of an ox under the earth, and calling the cattle over him’.65Isobel Young, prosecuted for witchcraft in 1629, was charged with bury-ing a live ox with the help of her sons. The authorities suspected a dia-bolic sacrifice, but her sons forthrightly asserted: ‘To the fact and mannerof the cure it has been the ordinary practice of husbandmen of the bestsort who was never suspect nor delated of witchcraft in many partswithin this kingdom.’66IVLarner switched between using a generic ‘he’ and ‘she’ when talking of‘healers’.67Yet by examining more precisely the gender ratios of differentcategories of healer some interesting issues emerge. The evidence fromEngland shows clearly that around two-thirds of cunning-folk were male – a figure consistent in both early modern and modern periods, andmatched elsewhere in Europe for the period.68On the other hand mostsimple fortune-tellers were women. No significant gender bias can bedetected amongst charmers – one reason being the tradition of contra-sexual transmission.69In comparison, Joyce Miller’s analysis of ‘charm-ers’ brought before the presbyteries of Haddington and Stirling between1600 and 1688 reveals that 66 per cent were women (41 individuals).70This is a reversal of the ratio from England. However, Miller is using‘charmer’ in the generic Scottish sense and so her sample includes arange of fortune-tellers, petty healers, charmers, and cunning-folk. Myown impression of the Scottish sources, albeit not one statistically cal-culated, suggests that once broken down into different categories ofpractice there were probably significant gender variations. The genderratio for cunning-folk would seem to have been more even, whilesimple healers certainly seem have been predominantly women. As tocharmers the situation appears similar to England.Across parts of early modern Europe magical practitioners claimed to have gained their powers from relations with supernatural beings,198Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"usually fairies in some guise or another.71Scotland is no exception. In1598, for example, Andrew Man claimed that the Queen of Elves gavehis powers to him. In 1628 Steven Maltman told the Stirling presbyterythat he had his healing gift from the ‘fairye folk’.72More significantlythe Scottish trial material also confirms a phenomenon noted else-where: that women were more likely than men to claim the fairies orspirits as their source of power. In 1572 Janet Boyman explained howher healing powers derived from the ghost of a woman who hadtaught her to heal, and who came to her like a blast of wind whencalled upon. In 1597 the neighbours of Isobel Strachan claimed sheobtained her powers from her mother who had learned them from an ‘elf man’ she had slept with. The same year Christian Lewinstonexplained how her daughter had been taken by the fairies. They hadtaught her ‘witchcraft’, and her daughter had passed the knowledge onto her. In 1623 Isobel Haldane explained how her power derived fromthe fairies after having spent three days in a fairy hill. Ten years laterIsobel Sinclair said she had been with the fairies, who gave her thepower of second sight regarding whether there was any ‘fey body’ inpeople’s houses – that is if someone was about to die. In 1659 AlisonPierson told how she had made a pact with the fairies, and that shewas a blood relation of several friends who attended the court of thefairies. Cunning-women could also source their powers to ecstaticexperiences of a more religious nature. In 1643 the minister ofTibbermore reported to the Dunkeld presbytery that:There is one Jean Crie, widow, in his parish, who, through a melan-cholic disease, had fasted 17 or 18 weeks, or thereby, and twice inthat time lay in trance for certain days, but now she taketh meat,and saith that she hath been in Heaven and Hell, and hath attainedto great skill of all diseases, and of things to come, so that there is agreat resort of the people to her.The presbytery summoned Crie and ordered ministers to preach fromthe pulpit against consulting her.73I have suggested elsewhere that the strength of the fairy source tradi-tion and its relationship to gender is linked to the cultural influence ofliteracy and the spread of literature.74In considering this, the impact ofthe Reformation is central. The Protestant emphasis on the importanceof being able to read the Bible had profound consequences on popularperceptions of what constituted knowledge, how it could be accessedand by whom. The promotion of popular education and the rise Owen Davies1999780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"of popular print not only enabled more people to access knowledge ofritual magic and conjurations, but also generated a greater awarenessamongst the illiterate of the power of the written and printed word aswell as the spoken word. One consequence was that book magicincreasingly acquired greater popular respect than fairy magic. Thus inEngland cunning-men ceased to claim fairy power from the early seventeenth century onwards, and emphasised their possession of booksinstead. Some illiterate female healers, however, continued to publicisetheir fairy inspiration through to the end of the century.At first, the Scottish situation seems to be at odds with this thesis.Calvinist Scotland has long been portrayed as a beacon of popular edu-cation during the early modern period, and so we might expect theinfluence of fairy power to have attenuated earlier or around the sameperiod as in England. The First Book of Discipline(1561) declared theright of all Scottish children to be taught to read, girls as well as boys.During the seventeenth century various acts of parliament backed upthis ecclesiastical principle, ensuring that every parish had a school-master. By the eighteenth century Scotland was said to have the mosteducated peasantry in Europe. But as R. A. Houston has observed,‘Scottish literacy is legendary. It has reached the status of myth’.75Houston’s impressive revisionist study of Scottish literacy has debunkedthe notion of a predominantly literate rural population. He reckonsthat in lowland Scotland during the early eighteenth century femaleliteracy was probably as low as 20 per cent while male literacy wasaround 60 per cent. The percentages drop further for the Highlands. Incomparison with England the male rate was higher in Scotland but thefemale literacy rate was lower.76Although such figures are calculatedon the basis of signatures and the hidden figure of those able to read issignificantly higher than those able to write, the gender gap remainsstark. It needs to be remembered, furthermore, that a significant pro-portion of the people of the Western Highlands knew no English at all.Theirs was a truly oral culture. It was only in 1767, for example, thatthe New Testament was translated into Gaelic.The above at least partly helps explain why there is little evidence of Scottish cunning-folk using occult texts such as the Fourth Book ofOccult Philosophyand the Key of Solomon, compared with those inEngland, the Dutch Republic and Italy for instance. What examplesthere are tend to confirm the different gender strategies. AlexanderDrummond confessed to having a book of cures, which may simplyhave been a herbal rather than a grimoire. The documents confiscatedfrom Bartie (Bartholomew) Paterson in 1607 contained a mix of Latin200Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 200"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"and English and included occult tables, signs and symbols, presumablyderived from either a book or one of the various magical manuscripts cir-culating at the time. Bessie Wright, who was brought before the Perthpresbytery and subsequently a secular court in 1628, also claimed litera-ture as her source of power. Her skill derived from a book that hadbelonged to her father and grandfather, and which was, she said, a thousand years old. It is telling, however, that she was apparently illiter-ate and had to rely on her son to read out the relevant sections to her.77Another sign of the limited role occult literature seems to haveplayed in the activities of Scottish cunning-folk is the lack of referenceto judicial astrology. In England it was a prominent and promoted skillamongst cunning-folk and there were also numerous urban and ruralastrologers of varying degrees of erudition plying their trade in theearly modern period. Astrology was used or pretended to be used toidentify witches and thieves, to predict the outcomes of wagers andlaw suits, and was very important in herbalism as well as providinggeneral intimations of the future. This apparent absence of a vibrantastrological culture can be partly put down to the limited circulation of almanacs in early modern Scotland. It was only from the 1660s that regular almanacs were established in Edinburgh and Glasgow.Furthermore, the Scottish almanacs had little of the astrological andprophetic content of their English counterparts, containing little morethan calendars, fair dates and weather forecasts.78Of course, Englishalmanacs found their way across the border, but it was not until therise of the Scottish chapbook trade in the second half of the eighteenthcentury that printed prophetic and divinatory knowledge began to bedisseminated widely. The real boom came in the mid-nineteenthcentury with printers in Glasgow and Kilmarnock mass-producingcheap guides to divination.79Extending the thesis into another realm, it is worth noting thataccording to Robert Kirk at least, at least some of the fairies’ powersalso derived from literature. As well as ‘many pleasant toyish books’they possessed others which ‘involved abstruse Sense, much like theRosurcian [i.e. Rosicrucian] style. They have nothing of the Bible, savecollected Parcells for Charms and counter Charms’.80Kirk was writingin the late seventeenth century, and if his views on fairy reading habitsreflect wider popular belief then it only tends to confirm the growingperception that the most potent magical knowledge derived from liter-ature. Even the illiterate through their relations with the fairies couldbenefit from the occult power contained in tomes of Neoplatonicmagic and Bible-based healing charms.Owen Davies2019780230_507883_10_cha08.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 201"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The nineteenth-century folklore sources contain many references tothe continued belief in fairies, the attribution of illness to fairies and theability of certain individuals to counter the fairies, but little evidencethat cunning-folk continued to advertise that their powers derived fromthem. The Galloway cunning-woman Jean Maxwell, whose prosecutionin 1805 was printed and circulated for public consumption, is symbolicof the change.81Maxwell boasted not of her fairy relations but of hererudition. She claimed to be an ‘Oxford Scholar’ and learned her skillsfrom a tome of magic she had inherited, and which she said was worth£9. By Maxwell’s time, it would seem the book had finally ousted thefairy in the world of professional magic at least.Scotland had one of the harshest legal codes against ‘beneficial’ magic inEurope, which targeted both cunning-folk and their clients. The judicialinfluence of the kirk, furthermore, ensured a considerable degree of com-plicity and cooperation between church and state in the fight against the‘user’, ‘abuser’ and ‘seeker’ of magic. Complaints brought before the eccle-siastical courts were significantly more likely to be passed on to the secularcourts than they were in England for example. Yet only a small proportionof cunning-folk were ever prosecuted under the 1563 Act. Their continuedinfluence in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scottish society, which isevident from kirk sessions, court records, newspaper reports and folklore,provides one of the most striking proofs of the resilience of popular culturein the face of excommunication and execution. The tradition of popularmagic may have changed over the centuries but it was in response tobroad social developments and not authoritarian repression.Notes1 Most notably Martin Martin, A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland ...to which is added a brief description of the Isles of Orkney and Shetland(London,1703); Thomas Pennant, A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides, 1772(London, 1774–76).2 SSW; J.

It was raised most recently for me when I wroteabout the western witch-hunt of 1697–1700.3In that hunt largenumbers of witches were accused but only a few were executed, despite‘ideal conditions’ for a witch-hunt as judged by past Scottish experi-ence. I concluded that the relative failure of the hunt was due to perva-sive doubt on the part of the legal and political authorities concerningthe reliability of the evidence used against the accused witches. Butwhat was the source of this doubt? I intend to propose a solution here:the doubt concerning evidence was being inspired by what we call the ‘scientific revolution’, and especially – but not exclusively – themechanical world view that was associated with it.Linking science to the decline of both witch beliefs and witch-hunting is not new, but the difficulty of making a direct causal link hasmade scholars cautious.4One problem is that the chronology does notmatch. Witch-hunting (although not necessarily witch beliefs)declined in some countries such as the Netherlands in the early seven-teenth century, while the scientific revolution was still in its earlystages.5Another problem is alluded to in the quotation from Hugh9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 206"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Trevor-Roper at the opening of this chapter. There were no directattacks from any of the scientific pioneers against witch-hunts or evenwitch beliefs. On the other hand, there was an effort by some expo-nents of the new philosophy such as Robert Boyle and Joseph Glanvillto maintain beliefs in witchcraft. In addition, continuing systems ofthought built around natural magic influenced the thinking of impor-tant scientists such as Isaac Newton. Thus there does not seem to beany simple link between the new science and the end of witch beliefs.Instead, it seems likely that the idea that the new science killed oldsuperstitions is an anachronistic reading backward of the mental worldof the eighteenth-century Enlightenment into the world of the lateseventeenth century.6This conclusion is especially strong for Scotlandsince scholars are united in saying that Scotland lacked any direct published attack on witch beliefs prior to the repeal of the witchcraftact in 1736.7If science was not responsible for a seventeenth-century decline ineither witch-hunting or witch beliefs, then what was the cause of thedecline of the witch-hunt in most of seventeenth-century Europe? Theleading contender is the theory of ‘judicial scepticism’, best expressedby Brian Levack. This also provides an explanation for the doubtexpressed concerning Scottish evidence in 1697–1700.8It explains theend of witch-hunting based on procedural caution and higher stan-dards of evidence by judges and lawyers. This included a greater super-vision of local judges by elite, well-trained, central judges; a restrictionon torture; a suspicion of confessions involving demonological ele-ments; a greater willingness to attribute the harm associated withmaleficiumto natural causes; and a more critical attitude towards biasor other disqualifying features in witnesses.9Levack acknowledges thatmany of these things were already present in the early years of thecentury and then intensified towards its end. However, he treats theselegal developments as relatively autonomous. He decouples the linkbetween witch beliefs and witch-hunting. Thus he acknowledges thepossibility that the scientific revolution was undermining witch beliefs,but argues that it probably was not affecting the witch-hunt.10Nonetheless, there are a number of reasons for thinking that philo-sophical scepticism concerning the existence of witches and witchcraftwas growing out of the new science and that it was helping to endwitch-hunting. It was beginning to take hold among some Scots in the late seventeenth century and contributed to the failure of the1697–1700 witch-hunt. This can be approached on two levels, one theoretical, the other empirical.Michael Wasser2079780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 207"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The strongest objection to a causal link between the new science,witch beliefs and the end of witch-hunting is chronological. A basicprinciple of causality is that the cause must precede the effect. Thus thefact that witch-hunting was declining in nations such as England,France, Spain, and the Netherlands in the early seventeenth century,before the mechanical world view was fully developed, tells against acausal link (expressed as a temporal sequence) between it, the declineof witch beliefs, and the decline of witch-hunting. But this principleonly applies if cause and effect are distinct and separate from oneanother. What if cause and effect are not separable, but are linked, andinfluence one another? This is a normal phenomenon in a complexsystem such as human society.11It is reflected in the question ‘whatcame first, the chicken or the egg?’ What I would suggest, therefore, isthat the new scientific view of the world was evolving in conjunctionwith changes in elite witch beliefs and a decline in witch-hunting. Theprocess of change was not complete until the mid to late eighteenthcentury, when witch beliefs were wholly discredited among secular-minded European elites and witch-trials came to a full stop. However,in the two centuries before this, these variables reacted unpredictablywith each other and with other variables such as economic conditions,social changes, religion and politics, to produce widely different resultsacross Europe. To return to Scotland, the period 1597–1628 saw adecline in witch-hunting that accorded with Levack’s theory of judicialscepticism.12But it did not last. There were new, large-scale hunts in1628–30, 1649 and 1661–2.13The Restoration decline in witch-hunting, which was longer-lasting, coincided with the reception of theideas of the scientific revolution.The link that I am suggesting between the new science and thedecline in witch beliefs can also be described through a contrastbetween two metaphors. The traditional way in which the new sciencewas thought to have killed off witch beliefs can be portrayed as aknight (the new science) slaying a dragon (superstitious witch beliefs).I would replace this metaphor with one where termites (the newscience) ate away at the foundation of a house (the intellectual under-pinnings of demonological ideas) until the house suddenly collapsed.This metaphor is imperfect, in that it does not portray the complexinterdependence of cause and effect that I have suggested above, but itdoes have some advantages. First, it suggests that the discrediting ofwitch beliefs was a process, not an event, and took place over anextended period of time. Second, the relationship between cause andeffect was asymmetrical, not symmetrical. This is to say that although208Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 208"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"the termites took a long time to undermine the house, the visible effectof that process, the collapse of the house, happened quickly. The factthat termites operate in obscurity, out of sight, is also relevant, for Ibelieve that the real struggle for belief occurred not in published trea-tises but in the individual minds of men and women where we cannotusually see it. The ‘collapse of the house’ occurred when people wereable to say openly that witchcraft was ‘an absurd and incredible impu-tation’ without suffering any negative consequences in their personalor professional lives.14This had not happened in Scotland by the years1697–1700; thus the lack of open attacks on witch beliefs. As will beseen below, my argument is that by 1697 a partial and imperfectabsorption of the mechanical view of the universe was creating doubtabout the existence of witches in addition to the evidence used toprove the crime of witchcraft. I am not arguing that a fully absorbedmechanical world view was producing a complete and certain rejectionof witch beliefs.The empirical reasons for linking science, witch beliefs, and thedecline of witch-hunting are tied more particularly to late seventeenth-century Britain, where many English and Scottish scientists were afraidof a rising tide of atheism that they connected with the new mechan-ical philosophy. They regarded a lack of belief in witchcraft as a precur-sor or an indicator of atheism: ‘And those that dare not bluntly say,there is NO GOD, content themselves (for a fair step and Introduction)to deny there are SPIRITS or WITCHES.’15The main exponent of this point of view in Scotland was George Sinclair, author of Satan’sInvisible World Discovered.16The fears of these men need to be takenseriously; we should not assume that they were tilting at windmills. This chapter has also been inspired by, and builds upon, the work oftwo modern scholars, Stuart Clark and Barbara Shapiro. Clark arguesthat demonology was a rational science linked to the natural philoso-phy of a ‘Christianized Aristotelianism’. He suggests that the replace-ment of the principles of this philosophy with those of a mechanical,corpuscular universe in which God does not intervene was the truereason for the end of demonological beliefs. While Clark places thistransition in the eighteenth century, I believe that the transition waslonger and slower. It was a process that began early in the seventeenth,and was only completed in the mid to late eighteenth century.17Shapiro argues that changes in attitude towards assessing evidencewere evolving simultaneously across many different fields in late seventeenth-century England, including law, theology and the newscience.18This involved a change in the classification of knowledgeMichael Wasser2099780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 209"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"inherited from the ancient world. Instead of a sharp break betweencertain knowledge derived from logical arguments and ‘mere opinion’based upon experience, there developed a continuum of knowledgerepresenting degrees of probability which were established by both reasoning and experience. What connected the changes across the dif-ferent disciplines was ‘the reorientation of all of them in the directionof empirical inquiry to establish matters of fact’.19Her work shows howcausality in intellectual change is not simple or compartmentalised,but complex and cuts across disciplines. It suggests, on a theoreticallevel, that it is possible that philosophical doubts about witches andwitchcraft were reinforcing and strengthening judicial scepticism aboutevidence and proof.I would like to stress that this is an exploratory essay at the begin-ning of a research agenda that is far from its conclusion. I intend toproceed here by taking seriously the arguments of George Sinclair, whoattacked sceptical thinking in Scotland, linking mechanical philo-sophies to doubts about witchcraft and atheism. Future research can goin two directions. One would be to read extensively in the contem-porary scientific and demonological texts and in current writing on thephilosophy and history of science. The second would be to conduct aprosopographical study of a population of contemporary Scots – forexample, those who participated in the 1697–1700 witch-hunt. If boththese programmes could be accomplished, it would give a much richerpicture, both in theory and in detail, of what I will explore below.IIIn 1685 George Sinclair published Satan’s Invisible World Discovered, themost important and widely read Scottish book on witchcraft. Sinclairwas writing as part of a Restoration movement, centred in England butincluding Scotland. It sought to prove the reality of witches, spirits anddemons by presenting a combination of philosophical reasoning and‘evidence’ in the form of stories authenticated by trustworthy testi-mony. The main exponent of this effort was Joseph Glanvill, a memberof the Royal Society, who used his prestige as a proponent of the newphilosophy to further his arguments over spirits and witches.20Sinclairpresented his book as a simplified and cheaper version of Glanvill’sSaducismus Triumphatus.21It consisted of a preface and a body of text.The preface stated the problem that he was addressing – disbelief inspirits and witches, leading ultimately to atheism – and gave reasonswhy this problem existed and why the conclusions of the sceptics were210Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 210"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"wrong. The text provided the stories that formed the empirical evid-ence for the reality of spirits, witches and witchcraft.Sinclair was a professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow universityfrom 1654 to 1666. His book confirms many of the arguments thatStuart Clark presents in favour of treating demonology as a rationalscience. For example, like any science, demonology featured an inter-nal discussion over what was or was not possible or true.22Sinclairdemonstrated this when he agreed with critics that the transformationof witches into cats and hares and their transportation into far coun-tries was not believable and when he disagreed with Glanvill as to thenature of the effect produced by the witch of Endor.23Demonologyalso displayed an ability to cope with criticism and to co-opt othersystems of thought into itself. Clark cites Sinclair at various points as an example of how the new science could support demonologists.Sinclair stated that he was in favour of the ‘new Philosophy’ whileimplying that it had to conform to the principles of Christian theology;‘otherwise men might resolve to build Castles in the Air’.24Sinclair also conforms to Clark’s conception of the world viewespoused by demonologists. The most basic element of this conceptionwas that the universe was defined by dualist, contrary principles: good and evil, God and the Devil, forever at war with one another.25Sinclair reflected this in his analysis of the contest between Moses andPharaoh’s magicians which he saw as his strongest evidence: ‘It isevident that this conflict was between the Kingdom of light, and theKingdom of darkness, and the evil spirits thereof.’26Within this dualistworld, causality was governed by Aristotelian cosmology and physics,assimilated into the Christian world by the medieval scholasticphilosophers. Clark sees three types of causality in this universe. Theordinary realm of nature was composed of those relationships easilyobserved and understood by human beings, such as heavy objectsfalling to the ground. ‘Preternature’ featured relationships that werestill natural, but were outside this ‘ordinary’ course of nature; theiroperations were usually hidden to the sight and understanding ofhuman beings, but were understood by the Devil and his minions,who could manipulate them to work ‘wonders’. The ‘supernatural’ wasreserved for things completely outside and above the natural world.Only God the creator could operate outside nature; anything super-natural was a miracle worked by him. So strongly does Clark adhere tothis threefold division that when a demonologist uses the term ‘super-natural’ to refer to something that should be preternatural, he glosses itas an imprecise use of language.27Sinclair reflected this division whenMichael Wasser2119780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 211"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"he discussed how witchcraft worked. In discussing poisoning, for exam-ple, he wrote: ‘Not that they mischieve people ordinarly by naturalpoyson, as Arsenick, or the like, but rather by some hellish malignancyinfused into things, by the art and malice of the Devil.’28In discussinganother means whereby witches wrought harm he described howa Witch sendeth forth thorow her eyes venomous and poysonfulSpirits, as Rayes, which lighting upon a man, will kill him. TheBasiliskkilleth this way. But the Devil and the Basiliskare bothSerpents.29These were descriptions of a preternatural world where the Devil usedspirits through the medium of a witch to work harm. But Sinclair sawthat not everyone believed in this. There were those who doubted thereality of spirits and who therefore threatened this whole world view.These people were breeding atheism. They had to be fought and refuted.IIISinclair attributed the ‘disbelief of devils, witches and apparitions’ tothree things: mockery, atheism, and the belief that many innocentpeople had been executed as witches.30After offering a short, generalrefutation of these things, Sinclair identified atheism as the mostserious of the three, and gave two reasons for the growth of atheism inthe world. The first was a materialist philosophy that he associatedwith Hobbes and Spinoza. The second, discussed at much greaterlength, was ‘the absurd Principles of the CartesianPhilosophy’, whichSinclair also referred to as ‘dangerous principles’.31Sinclair cited 54tenets of Cartesian philosophy that were dangerous and tendedtowards atheism. All were given a theological ‘spin’ but touched as wellon more general philosophical matters. To deal with all 54 is wellbeyond the scope of this chapter; instead, I will look at the 29thitem,‘That there is a world in the Moon’, and use this to show the connec-tions that Sinclair was drawing between the new mechanical worldview, witches, and atheism.32The term ‘a world in the moon’ described the belief that the moonwas a ‘world’ in the same sense as the earth, composed of the samematter.33Christianised Aristotelianism, by contrast, saw the moon ascomposed of aether, part of an entirely different reality.34But whyshould a belief in a world in the moon be seen as a threat to a belief inwitches, let alone as tending to atheism? To understand this we need212Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 212"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"to briefly examine the world view of Christianised Aristotelianism,how it came to be, and the challenges to it.According to Thomas Kuhn, there were three defining stages in thecreation of this world view. The first was Aristotle’s cosmology. Thissaw the universe as a series of spheres circling around a stationary,central earth. The spheres were composed of a non-terrestrial sub-stance, aether. Within them were the stars and the planets (includingthe moon and the sun), also composed of aether. This was not simplyan astronomical scheme, but united non-astronomical elements as wellsuch as Aristotle’s physics and laws of motion. For example, the sublu-nary region was composed of earth, air, water and fire. The tendency ofsolid objects (‘earth’) to fall ‘down’ rather than ‘up’ was explained bytheir natural tendency to fall to the centre of the earth, which was thecentre of the universe. Later astronomical thought was dedicated toexplaining the wayward motion of the planets. It culminated with thewritings of Ptolemy in the second century CE, and a theory of ‘epicy-cles’. This held that the planets moved in circles within their spheres:the ‘circles within circles’ that resulted as the spheres orbited the earthaccounted for the movement of the planets. This discussion is neces-sarily simplified and skips later observations and debate, which did notmodify the essential shape of these theories. When Aristotelian andPtolemaic writings were recovered and studied in western Europe inthe twelfth and thirteenth century, these physical theories were unitedwith Christian theology by the scholastic philosophers and theolo-gians. They incorporated God, Christ and the Bible into ChristianisedAristotelianism by making God the creator of the spherical universe,and associating the centre of the earth with hell and the spheres withthe heavens. Within this universe God was the motive force of allthings and the earth was the platform for the almost dualistic conflictbetween good and evil, God and the Devil.While this world view was comprehensive and convincing, it wasnot the only one available to Europeans of the later middle ages, norwas it without internal contradictions and problems. One survivingcompetitor from antiquity was the atomist cosmology associated withEpicurean and Stoic philosophy. This envisaged the universe as aninfinite space populated by individual atoms. These atoms aggregatedwith one another to form everything in the universe, including theearth and the sun. In this universe, the earth was not at the centre butwas merely another body, as was the moon. This theory was associatedwith atheism in antiquity because by deriving all existence from theinteraction between atoms it seemed logically to deny the existence ofMichael Wasser2139780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 213"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"the Gods, or at least did away with their necessary involvement in the universe. The internal contradictions arose from attempts to link the theory of epicycles and spheres with observations of the precisemovements of the planets. It was to solve the problem of planetarymovements that Copernicus in 1543 proposed his sun-centred universein which the earth moved like one of the planets. In the resultingintellectual ferment in the seventeenth century, heliocentric astro-nomy became associated with an atomistic – also called ‘corpuscular’or ‘mechanical’ – universe. The best and most famous exponent of thisassociation was René Descartes.35Descartes was born in 1596; in 1619 he had a dream which inspiredhim to pursue a ‘project of reestablishing all human knowledge on firmfoundations’.36He spent the 1620s and 1630s in his research andbegan publishing in 1637; he died in 1650. This timespan made him achild of the Copernican age. He was also the beneficiary of the discov-eries of the telescope, which, beginning with Galileo in 1608, providedincreasing empirical support for Copernican astronomy, and shaped itsfurther development. Galileo’s discoveries also gave empirical evidencefor the ancient concept of a ‘world in the moon’.37However, by doingaway with the earth as the centre of the universe, Copernicus had logi-cally destroyed the structural integrity of the Christianised Aristoteliansynthesis of astronomy, physics and theology. Copernicus himself triedto deny this and to preserve Aristotelian ideas within a heliocentricuniverse. Subsequent thinkers had either to deny heliocentrism alto-gether, to follow in Copernicus’s footsteps by reconciling conflictingsystems of thought, or to create a new, alternative synthesis. Sinclairchose the first option;38Descartes pursued the third. His cosmologywas corpusculan and heliocentric. All motion in this world – includingthe movements of the heavenly bodies and the earth – was explainedby the mechanical contact of atom on atom, body on body. God’s rolein the physical world was confined to the creation of the universe andthe laws by which it operated. In this universe there was no logicalplace for witches or witchcraft. Sinclair’s explanation of the way in whichwitches caused their effects – through the intermediary of spirits – wouldnot be credible.Descartes encountered two problems in having his ideas generallyaccepted. The first was the opposition of the church. In 1633 Galileowas condemned by the Inquisition for his espousal of Copernican ideas.Descartes responded by not publishing early selections from one of hisworks,The World, or a Treatise on Light, which he had intended to do.39This work, which included a heliocentric view of the universe, was214Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 214"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"published posthumously in two parts in 1662 and 1664. In 1644Descartes published his Principles of Philosophy, which set out most ofhis scientific ideas. However, the shadow of self-censorship hung overall his subsequent work, and he never returned to his work on TheWorld. Hugh Trevor-Roper believed that self-censorship was the reasonwhy no major scientific thinker attacked witch beliefs, and it probablyalso accounts for the absence of any such attacks in Scotland.40The second problem was that the synthesis was not sufficiently well-developed to be universally convincing. There were two aspects to this.One was the association with atheism, despite Descartes’s claim to haveproven the existence of God.41At the very least, the reduced role for thedeity was disturbing. This was one of the main motivations behind the attempts of Boyle, Glanvill and Sinclair to prove the existence ofwitches, devils and spirits. The second was the failure of Descartes’ workto account properly for empirical observations, necessitating numerousmodifications. Despite this, the underlying theory was very powerful,especially his ‘conception of the universe as a corpuscular machine governed by a few specified corpuscular laws’.42It inspired, survived andcompeted with Newton’s challenge for several decades.Sinclair’s attack on the Cartesian belief in a ‘world in the moon’ isnow understandable. Sinclair was not just a scientist; he was also a prac-tising presbyterian who had willingly suffered dismissal from his uni-versity post for his beliefs. Scots presbyterian theology had been suffusedsince the late sixteenth century with modified Christianised Aristotelianteachings.43The idea of a world in the moon was both Copernican andatomistic; it also inspired speculative writings about its possible inhab-itants and their putative relationship with God and salvation.44It chal-lenged the world view espoused by Sinclair in various ways, not least insuggesting that witches and spirits did not exist. This is also shown by the way in which Stuart Clark treats the heliocentric universe inThinking with Demons. Clark tries to show how various systems ofthought that were outside the Christianised Aristotelian tradition, suchas neo-platonism and hermetic natural magic, could nonetheless bemade to support the world view of the demonologists. But his only ref-erence to heliocentrism says that it was seen as much more of a threatthan these other systems.45Sinclair would have agreed.IVSinclair, therefore, was justified in his suspicion of the mechanicalworld views that Continental philosophers were developing, but toMichael Wasser2159780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 215"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"what extent had these theories taken hold in Scotland? Were theysufficiently widespread to have an effect on the thinking of largenumbers of the social and educated elite? Might they be influencingpeople who were in a position to hunt or not hunt witches? There is evidence that the mechanical natural philosophy was making animpact on the thinking of educated Scots, both before and after Sinclairpublished his book. This can be seen in the education system at homeand abroad, and in the links that many Scots had with England andthe Royal Society.There is an older historiographical opinion that the Scottish univer-sities continued to teach an arid Aristotelianism into the eighteenthcentury. This has been challenged by Christine King in a study thatdraws upon student notes and graduation theses.46King has shownthat beginning in the 1660s Aristotelian subject matter was challengedby newer ideas, especially those of Descartes. This was particularly truein physics, which formed the culminating subject of the Arts curri-culum. Aristotle was not wholly displaced, especially in logic and inthe organisation and conceptualisation of the courses, but in physics,first Cartesianism and then Newtonianism came to dominate.47How-ever, this was not achieved without a struggle. Sinclair testifies to acontinued debate and resistance in describing one regent at Aberdeenwho ‘has this year in his publick Theses, confuted the chiefest points oftheCartesian Philosophy, both Judiciously, and Modestly’.48The heliocentric view of the universe gained acceptance in conjunc-tion with other aspects of Cartesian philosophy. It was known andstudied intermittently at the universities from at least the early seven-teenth century, but rejected. In the 1660s it gained acceptance atAberdeen, Glasgow and St Andrews but lagged at Edinburgh, where itbecame generally accepted only in the 1680s.49Sinclair’s implicit rejec-tion of heliocentrism in Satan’s Invisible World Discoveredin 1685 andagain in his Principles of Astronomy, published in 1688, must be seen,therefore, as an attempt to reverse an accomplished shift in thinking,as was his whole attack on Cartesianism.50The large number of students attending Scots universities in theRestoration period meant that these ideas were spreading to a significantpercentage of the educated elite. In the 1660s, the total number of stu-dents at the University of Edinburgh may have approached 500.51Thismeans that the population of Restoration Scotland contained thou-sands of men with a university education who had been exposed to theideas of the new mechanical philosophy. They were not scientists, butthey were aware of a new universe of ideas. Many of these men would216Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 216"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"be decision-makers in positions of power or influence, and thereforeable to act on these ideas.In addition to studying at home, many Scots travelled and studiedabroad during the Restoration era, particularly in the Netherlands.Between 1676 and 1700 there were 419 Scottish students at Leyden alone,of whom 235 were matriculated in the law faculty. From 1661 to 1750,275 of the 663 candidates admitted to the faculty of advocates (41%) areknown to have studied in the Netherlands. Incomplete records mean thatthe real total must be higher.52John Cairns notes that the education thatthese men were receiving was ‘one that emphasised the liberal connec-tions of law with history, philosophy and even the natural sciences’.53King also notes the importance of the Netherlands to Scots education.54Sinclair, as a former university professor, would have been aware of thistrend. Thus when he prefaced his 56 dangerous tenets of Cartesian phi-losophy by complaining that they ‘are owned and maintained publicklyabroad, especially in Holland’, he was not digressing – he was pointingout one way in which Cartesianism was entering into the minds of Scots.This shows that it was at least possible that the ‘judicial scepticism’ ofthe lawyers towards witches was being influenced by a parallel philo-sophical scepticism. It is further strengthened by the scientific knowledgedisplayed by two legal writers on witches. In his Laws and Customs ofScotland in Matters Criminal, Sir George Mackenzie devoted a chapter towitchcraft in which he occasionally alluded to scientific knowledge. Forexample: ‘I believe that in the duller Nations a Philosopher drawing Ironwith a Loadstone might have run a great risque of being burnt’.55FrancisGrant in his Sadducismus Debellatus(1698), which recorded his speech tothe jury in the Bargarran witchcraft case, went much further, makingconstant allusions to scientific phenomena in an effort to satisfy the jurythat the witchcraft charges were credible.56At one point he even used themechanical, atomistic cosmology of the Epicureans as a metaphor to helpestablish his arguments.57While Grant was not a sceptic in 1697–8, hedid mysteriously disappear from the fray after he wrote his book. Thewider point, however, is that these men were scientifically literate, andexpected their audience to be so as well.Scots intellectual life was also becoming increasingly tied to that ofEngland, and in the realm of philosophy, to the Royal Society in London.In the early years of the Restoration this was fostered by Sir Robert Moray,an expatriate Scot who was both a politician and an important founder ofthe Royal Society, and by the duke of Lauderdale, the Scottish secretarywho managed Scottish politics by shuttling back and forth betweenEdinburgh and London.58This intellectual exchange was facilitated andMichael Wasser2179780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 217"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"increased by James, duke of York’s residence in Edinburgh in the years1679–82.59Regents in the Scots universities were quick to incorporate thefindings of the Royal Society, published in its Philosophical Transactions,into their class lectures. The Scots universities were also quicker to incor-porate Newtonian ideas after the publication of the Principiain 1687 thanwere the English universities.60It was this partnership that inspired Sinclair’s Satan’s Invisible WorldDiscovered, together with other scientific investigations of preternaturalphenomena. In 1678 Robert Boyle, the most prestigious member of the Royal Society, met Sir George Mackenzie of Tarbat – a member of Lauderdale’s entourage – to discuss Tarbat’s knowledge of Highlandsecond sight. The result was a virtual research programme into thephenomenon, with the Oxford Philosophical Society, Edward Lhuyd,Samuel Pepys and John Aubrey (in England) and Dr James Garden,Robert Kirk and John Fraser (in Scotland) all interested.61While thesepeople were opposed to a pure mechanical philosophy they did showknowledge of it. Indeed, as with Sinclair, knowledge of these ideas wasthe inspiration behind the attempt to refute them or to limit theirradical implications. However, others might well have adopted thoseradical implications, or least been influenced by them.VSinclair’s fears expressed in Satan’s Invisible World Discoveredwere thuslegitimate. Many Scots had been exposed to the idea of a mechanical,heliocentric universe, and this cosmology did challenge the explana-tions for witchcraft phenomena. However, no one associated with the1697–1700 witch-hunt has been shown to have linked their doubtsabout the evidence to doubts about witch beliefs or to a belief in amechanical universe. While this may change with further research,what we have now is an intellectual climate that makes it possible thatparticipants were being influenced by these things. This amorphouslink can be strengthened by two things: first, a look at statements bythree individuals, and second, a link with a theory of intellectualchange, Thomas Kuhn’s ‘paradigm shift’.While no one in Scotland has left written statements denying theexistence of witches prior to 1736, scholars have turned up a few peo-ple who have hinted at such beliefs and at a climate of debate on thissubject. In 1678 Sir John Clerk refused to serve on a witchcraft com-mission ‘alleging, drily, that he did not feel himself warlock (that is,conjuror) sufficient to be a judge upon such an inquisition’.62While218Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 218"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"the literal sense of his words indicates only a judicial scepticism aboutdistinguishing between preternatural and natural causes, the sarcasminvolved in referring to himself as a warlock may suggest somethingmore. This was originally reported in Fountainhall’s Decisions, andFountainhall himself is another example of a judicial sceptic who mayhave harboured doubts about the existence of witches. He matriculatedat Leyden in 1666 and joined the Scottish bar in 1668.63He expresseddoubts concerning the evidence in a number of witchcraft cases, at onepoint writing that ‘thir confessions made many intelligent sober per-sons stumble much what faith was to adhibite to them’.64Fountainhallwas a lord of justiciary during the 1697–1700 witch-hunt, and wasprobably consulted about the cases.65The third and best example is a letter that the Rev. Robert Knox wroteto his colleague the Rev. William Wyllie about the Pollok witches in1677. He said that Wyllie ‘hath mightily convinced me (I say not thattheer are witches, for it is a good time that I was past doubting of yt truth)that these persones ... are really such’.66The words in brackets show thatKnox had once wrestled with a philosophical scepticism concerningwitches which led him to doubt their existence. While we cannot knowwhat caused his doubts, he did graduate from the University of Edin-burgh in 1668 and thus would have been exposed to the Cartesianphysics being taught there.67After a time this philosophical scepticismwas abandoned, but in its wake it left a gentler ‘judicial scepticism’ con-cerning whether or not particular people were actually witches. It was thisjudicial scepticism that Wyllie had to allay. This expresses the relation-ship between philosophical and judicial scepticism that I believe to bebehind the rejection of evidence in 1697–1700. Philosophical doubtsabout the existence of witches and witchcraft were strengthening judicialscepticism about evidence that had long existed in Scotland. Further-more, it is arguable that if Knox had retained his philosophical scepticismconcerning the existence of witches he would not have said so in writing.To do so would have been dangerous. People who adopted this argumentwere called ‘witch patrons’ and vilified.68In 1697 Thomas Aikenhead wasexecuted for blasphemy which tended towards atheism, the very thingthat critics believed of those who doubted the existence of witches.69VIIt is also possible to use Thomas Kuhn’s theory of ‘paradigm shift’ in thesciences to understand the process of change in elite witch beliefs inScotland and Europe, and to apply it to the state of affairs in Scotland inMichael Wasser2199780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 219"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"1697–1700.70This argument is predicated upon Stuart Clark’s identi-fication of demonology as a rational science. According to Kuhn, a bodyof ideas which he calls a ‘paradigm’ informs a scientific community’sunderstanding of its subject matter and guides its research agenda andthe questions which it asks of nature. Research within this paradigm con-stitutes ‘normal science’. But a paradigm ‘need not and in fact never does,explain all the facts with which it can be confronted’.71Therefore, one ofthe functions of a paradigm is to guide further research. If research turnsup too many findings which seem to challenge the paradigm itself, thenthe science will fall into crisis. This crisis can be resolved by the formula-tion of a new paradigm. The classic example of this is the shift from aPtolemaic (earth-centred) to a Copernican (heliocentric) solar system.Many sciences in the early modern period existed in a pre-paradig-matic state. But I would argue that demonology acquired a paradigmno later than the fifteenth century.72That paradigm featured a battlebetween good and evil, God and the Devil, situated here on earth, inwhich the Devil used witches to work preternatural evil in a war uponChristian society. However, this paradigm existed within another,more comprehensive one, that of Christianised Aristotelianism. As seenabove, this paradigm featured a fusion of Greek science – both astron-omy and physics – and Christian theology. Copernicus’s theory createda crisis in this wider paradigm, pulling apart astronomy, physics, andespecially theology. This led to a crisis in demonology as well.In Scotland, this crisis began in the 1660s as both heliocentrism andCartesian physics began to be taught and accepted. But as Kuhn insists,a paradigm cannot be vanquished unless there is another to take itsplace, and he is very sensitive to the role played by non-empiricalfactors and human psychology in achieving a paradigm shift.73InEngland and Scotland alike, the sticking point, as seen above, was thefear of atheism. In the context of ideas explored in this chapter,Sinclair expressed this fear best when he confronted head-on theCartesian claim to prove the existence of God:They do not indeed assert, there is no GOD, but rather seem toprove so much, especially by his Idea, which is Connatural to allmen. This may seem a plausible reason, but when its put to the Test,orTouchston, it, with others of that kind, are not found sufficient,nor able to convince Atheists.74It is probably because of this that men such as Boyle, who did adopt an atomistic view of matter, refused to believe that this excluded the220Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 220"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"existence of a spiritual substance. This is probably also why men likeBoyle, Glanvill and Sinclair sought to provide an empirical basis for witchbeliefs. Empiricism was becoming linked to the emerging new science.Demonology, while it was a rational science, was not an empirical one. Ifthis could be changed, if witchcraft could be shown to exist empirically,then God’s role in the world and belief in his existence would be safe.This failed in the end, but it was not clear that it would do so at the time.Therefore, in order for a new scientific paradigm to take full holdand eliminate witch beliefs, fears of atheism had to be neutralised. It isfor this reason that I believe the work of Barbara Shapiro is important.In arguing that empirical ideas were developing simultaneously andinterdependently in law, science, and other fields, especially theology,she provides an explanation for how this was achieved. In theology shefocuses on the latitudinarians, beginning in the 1650s.75Their impor-tant contribution was their attempt to show that Christianity rested onrational foundations. If people could come to accept this, then theywould no longer need to fear that the decline of witch beliefs was thefirst step on a slippery slope to atheism. In England this was achievedin conjunction with Newton’s new theories of gravity and motion,published in 1687. This reunited celestial and terrestrial mechanics –astronomy and physics – as had been the case in Christianised Aristo-telianism. Pope’s famous Essay on Man (written in 1732–4) showed thecompletion of the process, presenting a new world view in whichscience and religion were once again merged in a mutually supportingsynthesis.76What the latitudinarians did in England was echoed inScotland by the moderate party in the eighteenth-century kirk. Thetime lag between the development of the latitudinarians and the mod-erates helps to account for the time lag between the decline in witchbeliefs in England and Scotland, as shown by Ian Bostridge.77According to Kuhn, once a paradigm shift has occurred ‘Some oldproblems may be relegated to another science or declared entirely“unscientific”’.78This was to be the fate of demonology and of elitewitch beliefs in general. Diseases and mysterious accidents whichformed the staple of maleficia and had once engendered vigorousdebates over their causes – were they natural or preternatural? – werenow assigned only to the natural sphere. The more purely demonolog-ical elements were abandoned altogether as unscientific. This includedthe whole idea of a demonic conspiracy against Christian society. ButKuhn also says that while a state of crisis in a science may persist for along time, the solution in the form of a paradigm shift occurs quickly.At one point he compares it to a ‘gestalt switch’.79In Scotland in theMichael Wasser2219780230_507883_11_cha09.pdf 19/10/07 9:53 AM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"period 1697–1700, this had not yet happened. Demonology was incrisis, but it had not yet succumbed to a new paradigm. I believe thatthe state of crisis induced by the challenge of the mechanical worldview reinforced judicial scepticism of evidence and resulted in thefailure of the 1697–1700 witch-hunt.But when did the shift occur? In England, Bostridge argues that itoccurred in the years before and after the Hanoverian succession andhe links it to political debate. Witchcraft in the period leading up to1714 formed part of the factionalising discourse between Whigs andTories. In the years after this, dismissal of witch beliefs formed part ofthe new political consensus.80I do not want to dismiss the importanceof politics in this process; instead I would argue that this is a goodexample of the interdependence of cause and effect in a complexsystem which I discussed briefly at the beginning of this chapter.Politics is not an independent variable in human society; it is, to put itpoetically, the ‘art of the possible’. I would argue, therefore, that thedevelopment of a new scientific paradigm, allowing for a dismissal ofwitch beliefs without a fear of atheism, made a consensus around thisdismissal politically possible.It is not, however, clear when this happened in Scotland.81So instead,I would like to conclude this chapter with a look at what elite opinionwas like once the shift had happened. In 1797, Professor David Humepublished his Commentaries on the Law of Scotland Respecting Crimes.At the end of volume 1, he discoursed on a crime then extinct, and for which he displayed an ‘enlightened’ thinker’s disgust: witchcraft.Numerous emotional phrases showed Hume’s distress at having towrite on this ‘melancholy and humiliating article’. Although he didnot argue or attempt to prove it, his abhorrence was fuelled by his con-viction that the crime for which so many people suffered death was animaginary one, that could not actually be committed. He unhappilyconcluded that ‘it cannot surprise us if men utterly lost sight of reason,and the ordinary rules of justice, in dispensing a part of the law whichwas founded altogether upon ignorance and terror’.82How society hadchanged, so that Hume could both articulate and publish this opinion,requires further research.Notes1 H.

It is suggested that these familiar groupings also give off mes-sages which may in selected instances reveal more about the history oflatterday collecting than of witchcraft, and more about the predilec-tions and preoccupations of folklorists. This is not to deny that someof these artefacts have much to tell us at least by inference about thematerial culture and traditions of witchcraft in the early modernperiod, or to ignore the texture and colour that they lend to thewritten evidence. The museum record is here characterised as ‘magicand mischief in museum collections’ to offer a challenge to acceptedwisdom and to suggest that, without careful exercise of analysis andinterpretation, the value of these objects as historical evidence in sucha complex subject may often be low.Museum collections are built up through a process that is within itsown terms methodical and rational and will generally be presented as aprocess of planned and orderly accumulation. Parameters are set bypractical and pragmatic constraints and by scholarly fashions as well asby market and sale-room caprice, and also legacies and bequests, thelatter conditions intrinsically difficult to pre-empt. Collecting in spiteof curatorial aspirations and collecting policies may never be a precisescience and has rarely been ‘in the round’ or as all-encompassing asmight be required to capture the fullest possible range of evidence for most subjects; this however is always a problem at the heart ofnarrative history.

Such groupings for display are designed to illustrate conceptssuch as ‘folk belief’ and witchcraft (or the history of witchcraft), thegroupings reflecting the ways in which these artefacts are classified andorganised in their respective museum. There may not be interpretationor historical narrative beyond the anecdotal, partly because themuseum of today must avoid the ‘book on the wall’ treatment, andaesthetic and design sensibilities would aim to avoid losing what isalmost inevitably a small object amongst a mass of labels and print; thefashion would be to let the object speak for itself. But in the presentfashion for ‘heritage’, there is a tendency for the visitor to come awaywith a sense of folksy imagery and odd cultural attributes from a presentation which, for the historian, may have blatantly exploitedstereotypes of Scotland’s past.The provenance of what can be described as amuletic objects, some-times deduced, sometimes assumed, describes a generally held belief intheir protective and curative properties.2It is suggested here that, cer-tainly by the late nineteenth century, pieces of stone of certain charac-ter and qualities might be described (moving from the specific instanceand without further research) as a ‘curing stone’ or a protection againstwitchcraft. Hearsay flourished and the reputation of such objects grewand expanded over time. An account of a pierced stone disc wasincluded in the account of the parish of Crossmichael in 1845, sent tothe parish minister by Joseph Train (1779–1852), the Ayrshire-bornexciseman and admiring correspondent of Sir Walter Scott. Train wrote:There have been found, at different times, near the same place,several round flat stones, each of five or six inches in diameter, per-forated artificially in the centre. Even within the memory of somepersons yet alive, these perforated stones were used in Galloway tocounteract the supposed effects of witchcraft, particularly in horsesand black-cattle. ... One of these perforated stones, as black and228Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_12_cha10.pdf 19/10/07 9:54 AM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"glossy as polished ebony, is also in my possession. It was recentlyfound in the ruins of an old byre where it had evidently been placedfor the protection of the cattle.3George Fraser Black (1866–1948), Assistant Keeper of the NationalMuseum of Antiquities of Scotland in the early 1890s, published in1892 a long article which remains the only adequate or extendedaccount of the material culture of Scottish charms and amulets. Blackadded Train’s inferences to the Museum’s record with the informationthat in Kirkcudbrightshire ‘perforated stone discs of shale ... werebelieved to be capable of preserving horses and cattle from the effectsof witchcraft’. Thus a single anecdote could be translated into ananthropological near-truth. However several examples of perforatedstones evidently used as amulets were acquired for the collections ofthe National Museums and generally described as ‘witch stones’, theinference being in the Museums’ records that this was the term used todescribe them by their original owners and in their original contexts[e.g. NMS NO 12]. By the late nineteenth century, then, assumptionswere being made about perforated stones, even examples retrievedfrom the soil or from archaeological strata; they had been kept, it wassaid, to ward off nightmares, these being caused by a ‘wicked hag orogress’.4A possible source of this intriguing notion may have been the lexical curiosity included by the Secession minister, Rev. JohnJamieson (1759–1838), a cleric with a keen eye for antiquities, in hisEtymological Dictionary of the Scottish Languagewhere we find:Mare-stane– A rough river stone, resembling a hatchet in shape,which has been worn down by collision or friction so as to admit ofa cord being fixed round it, Angus. This is hung up in a stable toprevent the horses being ridden by the hag called the mare.5IITypically and as in the collections of the National Museums of Scotlandthese groups of artefacts and ‘charms against witchcraft’ are very diverse.They include gems and semi-precious stones, crystals on their own andin medieval reliquaries or reconstructed into forms of jewellery (popularstill for ‘powers’ credited to them in natural medicine and ‘alternativetherapies’), fossil material and natural ‘curiosities’, prehistoric objectsdiscovered contemporaneously, brooches, for example in circular orheart-shaped form, and written and printed texts.

From a range of sources it can beseen that these artefacts were a recognised element in medieval MateriaMedicaand that they continued to have an important social and cul-tural role through the period of development of the medical sciencesin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.6To generalise, charmsand amulets were the instruments or agents of what may now bedescribed as ‘folk medicine’. However, as talismanic, sometimes fetishistobjects such as ‘charms against witchcraft’, they were also appropriatedby discourses on folklore and folk belief and are now more likely to beclassed thus in museum collections. This too frequently results in lossof context, most frustratingly of information on other medicinal,homeopathic and sympathetic elements such as spoken formulae andsymbolic behaviour which can be located in other sources. The recordsof church courts, particularly in the seventeenth century, describe objectsof stone, metal, wood and textile being used in healing procedures andrituals and we might suggest that such objects may be exemplifiedtoday among the charms and amulets in the National Museums’ col-lection.7The growth of interest in this material, as one aspect of aninterest in witchcraft, in the course of the nineteenth century mean-while seemed to prompt too ready deduction in their assessment andinterpretation and a consequent neglect of enquiry. But the presentphase of witchcraft research offers copious evidence for a better con-textualisation and interpretation of such material. The documentationof witch trials and confessions often describes amuletic objects such asare to be seen in museum collections today.Prehistoric objects, recovered in the past as chance finds during cul-tivation or building work, have included flint arrowheads and spindlewhorls. These might deliberately be kept in a safe place by their finders(in most instances which have been acquired subsequently by theMuseums as records of provenance show) or in some cases described asbeing carried on the person to protect against dangers more sensed orassumed by collectors perhaps than real or intelligible. Depending on thecircumstances of acquisition and the source of information, an amuleticusage may be more easily inferred. Arrowheads in this order of thingswere customarily termed ‘elf-bolts’ or ‘fairy arrows’ and considered to bethe tiny missiles by which sickness and death were induced in animals.As such they were referred to at an early date, as in the responses to thequestionnaires circulated by Robert Wodrow (1679–1734) and EdwardLhuyd (1659/60?–1709), in witch trials, and by Rev.

Antiquariesand collectors in the nineteenth century were sufficiently schooled intheir art to recognise Neolithic arrowheads as ‘elf bolts’ or ‘fairy arrows’and an arrowhead presented to the National Museum of Antiquities ofScotland in 1939, which had belonged to the collector Lady John Scottof Spottiswoode, had been mounted in a gilt casing and had even beenpainted with the Gaelic phrase Saighead Sithe(for ‘Fairy Arrow’) [NMSNO 76]. Other examples, similarly mounted but without gratuitousantiquarian naming, survive such as an impressive example mountedto hang on a watch-chain of horsehair and worn by an Ayrshire farmeras a good-luck token in the early twentieth century [NMS K.2000.552](Fig. 10.1). Spindle whorls were described as ‘adder stones’ which wereused by the snakes themselves when moulting, so it was supposed, toslough off their skins. The irony in this belief was suggested by SirArthur Mitchell in his Rhind Lectures in 1876 when he pointed outthat these discovered items might still be part of the experience andmaterial culture of the region and localities in which they were found.The examples of these which he gave to the National Museums there-fore came from a context in which they were still used as charms orspecifically protective and curative devices. In his descriptions of therelict material culture of the Northern and Western Isles, he wonderedat the knowledge of the practical application of spindle whorls beinglost:Being of stone, they do not rot away like spindles, and they areoften turned up in diggings about deserted townships. By those whoso find them they are treated with superstitious respect and care,being regarded as charms, and known under the name of AdderStones... In the course of a few generations, it thus appears, notonly that all knowledge of the use of the whorl may be lost, but thatthere may grow round the object itself a religious belief in its super-natural origin and qualities.9Some items, by virtue of being pursued by a zealous antiquary, mighthave attracted more information than might have been available in thenormal course of present-day archaeological inquiry.

It is of a circular form, nearly an inch in diameter, and is com-posed of a pale-coloured glassy substance, having on the surface allround a waving stripe of yellow.

Itis a flat oblong stone, like a piece of slate, approximately 10 ×7 cm.,notched on the sides and pierced with two holes, and described as beingformerly used as a cure for diseases in Islay [NMS NO 1] (Fig. 10.2).11The provenance unfortunately is no more detailed than this althoughresearch might well throw up further contextual information. Here wehave a piece of natural material which has attracted curiosity, has beenworked and adopted into a social context where it may well have beenapplied with prayer and incantation – some formula of words – as acure. This might have been part of the stock-in-trade of a charmer, oneof those, male or female, who inevitably drew the ire and admonitionof kirk sessions throughout Scotland. Charming as an aspect of folkhealing was widespread throughout Scotland and cases examinedbefore church courts and kirk sessions in the post-Reformation periodoften give detailed accounts of the combination of ritual, objects andwords.

Sir Walter was, not surprisingly, a Fellow of the Society ofAntiquaries, having been elected in 1796 at the age of 25, but he wasnever in his lifetime a significant contributor to the collections. Not onlywas he a keen collector himself and engaged in acquiring ‘gabions’ for hisRomantic fantasy at Abbotsford, but he appears paradoxically not to havebeen particularly committed to the Society probably because of his dislikeof the Earl of Buchan, its founder and sponsor. Buchan, according toScott, was one of the supreme bores of their age, along with Sir JohnSinclair. It may be that Scott was repelled by the calf’s heart as a macabreobject and, if he shared some of the emotions of his literary creations,would have shrunk from giving a home to it under his own roof-tree.Within two years his own Letters on Demonology and Witchcrafthadappeared and the brief story of the heart was concluded:About two years since, as they were taking down the walls of a buildingformerly used as a feeding-house for cattle, in the town of Dalkeith,there was found below the threshold-stone the withered heart of someanimal stuck full of many scores of pins – a counter-charm, accordingto tradition, against the operations of witchcraft on the cattle which arekept within. Among the almost innumerable droves of bullocks whichcome down every year from the Highlands for the south, there is scarceone but has a curious knot upon his tail, which is also a precaution lestan evil eye or an evil spell may do the animal harm.13The third donation in this collection, given to the Museum in 1829, is inits own way equally sensational. This was ‘Barbreck’s Bone’, now displayedin the Museum of Scotland, a small slab of ivory which was said to cureall degrees of madness in Argyllshire [NMS NO 2]. Frustratingly, no moreinformation came with this object or from its lairdly donor, FrederickCampbell – frustrating because the appearance of ‘Barbreck’s Bone’ sug-gests, as in the case of some other charms, particularly the crystal gems, aprevious embodiment as part of a reliquary of the pre-Reformation churchin the Highlands. When these were subsequently remodelled or disman-tled or destroyed, parts of such reliquaries might pass on as saintly-inspired charms.An outstanding example of such a medieval charm is the so-called‘Glenorchy Charmstone’ consisting of a ridged or ‘hog-backed’ crystalmounted, probably in the seventeenth century, in an engraved silver236Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_12_cha10.pdf 19/10/07 9:54 AM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"setting set with pieces of coral [NMS NO 118].

An example from further north, the so-called‘Keppoch Charmstone’, taken to Australia in 1854 by a Lochaber emi-grant, was more sensitively researched by Rev. Dr Alexander Stewart whopublished the Gaelic formula used for saining water to give to sufferers.This invoked St Bride, the Twelve Apostles, the Virgin Mary and theTrinity, and ‘all the shining angels’.15An impressive selection of rockcrystal charms is held in the National Museums’ collections, each ofwhich comes with its particular tradition of curative powers. Most havebeen or still are finely mounted on a chain, exemplifying the well-documented belief that water into which the crystal was dipped bestowedhealing and protection against witchcraft for man and beast [e.g. NMSH.NO 15–16, H.NO 72, H.NO 81, H.NO 108, H.NO 112]. Such itemsmight amount to a vital element of successful cattle husbandry, such asthe ‘Stone of Ardvoirlich’ or Clach Deargwhich was held in great reputein the district as a charmstone for curing diseases of cattle (Fig. 10.7).16Collecting and making collections was now a fashion and preoccupa-tion of the first urban nation in the modern world. It inherited itsinterest and traditions however from earlier ‘museum’ collectionsamassed in the treasuries of the medieval church and in princely col-lections of jewels and art. These gave rise to the concept of the privatecollection and to cult status and new symbols of power. Power wasinvested in things. They gave rise too to the compelling attraction ofthe supernaturally miraculous and the naturally astonishing. Whocould resist a fragment of the ‘true cross’ and a unicorn’s horn – thecarved narwhal tusk seemed to have been a common denominator of‘cabinets of curiosities’. A neat judgement on these collections mightbe ‘a deft selection of daft things’, and the maritime exploration of thesixteenth century enlarged the horizons of the cult of collecting andexpanded the quotients of the natural versus the man-made. A darkside of collecting is usually evident in the Wunderkammer, the ‘cham-ber of wonder’, in, in the first place, a fascination with the occult trans-ferred from reliquaries for example, and secondly in a fearful assumptionof magical contacts between all manifestations.

It was in this context that theSociety of Antiquaries of Scotland was founded in 1780 and, althoughobjects were collected and studied essentially for private purposes, the intentions of the learned society were public and honourable. Thepurpose of collecting was to assemble a comprehensive view of thematerial culture of Scotland with objects ‘illuminating certain aspectsof the Nation’s history’.The agrarian and industrial revolutions had created a new economicorder and the past was receding rapidly and becoming a ‘foreign country’.But Scott had shown for Scotland that the past (or a past) could be under-stood and imaginatively reconstructed. Never before the nineteenthcentury had a society examined its past in such detail and with suchenthusiasm as can be seen in its art and literature. Historical novels andantiquarian research showed how the past could be discovered orinvented, Scott’s novels in particular offering models of historical under-standing. A strong vein of historicism created new narratives of the past,naturally strongly coloured by contemporary views and ultimately, in toomany cases, selling themselves more on style than on content. A per-ceived severance from the past tended to throw it into sharper relief andto make the collecting of the past more compelling and fascinating.Collecting and its presentation in museums, both private and public,served both to demonstrate the advances of Victorian society and todistance the citizens of the nineteenth century from the past. Theimpulse given to museums, collection and display by the Great Exhib-ition in 1851 introduced a new phase in which their purpose was toeducate and enlighten the new urban masses of industrialised society.At the same time literature and copious museum collections demon-strate a fascination with material artefacts. Society took great plea-sure from measuring the present against the cultural practices andproducts of the past and this form of curiosity about the past and ofself-examination or reflexivity can be best assessed in the journals ofthe emerging disciplines of archaeology, anthropology and folklife andfolklore studies.

Snuff mills were common enough butMargaret Lang was one of the Bargarran witches burnt at Paisley in1697.21The letter attached to the snuff mill offers insight into nine-teenth-century ideas, interests and attitudes, and is printed as anAppendix below. The writer, John Mitchell, was a Paisley man, co-author (with John Dickie, whom he mentions) of The Philosophy ofWitchcraft(Paisley, 1839).From time to time, witches come into sharp relief in unrelatedsources, summoned up to fulfil the needs of new narratives of the pastor to realise fears and fantasies. Some of the assumptions and conde-scensions of this era make chilling reading. An Orkney character of the1890s, Annie Harper of Rendall parish, was a well-known and generallywell-loved member of the community whose dress and ‘gyaun-aboot’way of life were her memorial. But a photograph of her was publishedin 1901 in a collection ‘Scottish Village Characters’ with the followingoutrageous and unsubstantiated caption:The Village Witch of the Orkneys. She exercises a certain power andterror over her neighbours for the islanders are still very supersti-tious ... And witchcraft is still so devoutly believed in, that love-lornmaidens come to ask the spaewife what shall betide them in thefuture, while evil happenings are freely attributed to her by others.And it was such a woman as this who, within memory of those stillliving, were ducked in ponds to test their supernatural power.22Closer to the ground, attitudes were generally more kindly althoughobjective comment is difficult to discern. G. K. Chesterton warnedagainst the uncritical and ignorant belief in anything and everythingas a corollary of a failure to believe in God, which makes the synopsisof Rev. John Gregorson Campbell (1836–1891) more useful and appeal-ing. He was minister of Tiree from 1860, collector of folktales and tra-244Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_12_cha10.pdf 19/10/07 9:54 AM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"ditional material, and author of a ‘Witchcraft’ collection publishedposthumously in 1902, in which he concluded that ‘there is littlerepulsive or horrible in their character’. What could witches do, heasked? To which he supplied a ready and informed answer, no doubtto humour his readers:What could they not do? The classes of action however ascribed tothem are not numerous. They could take the milk from their neigh-bours’ cattle, bring fish to their own coasts, make fishermen successful,go to sea for fish themselves and bring home creelfulls, raise storms,sink ships, drown those who offended them. ... It was in the name ofthe devil, and against the name of the Trinity, they set about theircantrips, but a knowledge of the necessary charms, and a courage touse them, seem to have been all that was requisite. Those having thereputation of being witches were (and are, for a few still survive)usually old women, destitute of friends and means of support, andnaturally ready to eke out a miserable livelihood by working on thefears or the simplicity of their more prosperous neighbours.23It may be no coincidence that the flow of donations of witchcraft charmsreduced as welfare legislation and provision increased in the twentiethcentury.24New classes of professional practitioners might outlaw old-fashioned ways although science and reason would not curb the imagina-tion. The art of healing continued to elude the science of definition andremained mobile on a spectrum of physiology to folk-belief.25Belief inwitches has outlasted the earlier hunting of witches and in the nine-teenth century ‘most of the essentials of witch belief were present as theyhad always been’.26The same continuity has also brought us the artefactsassociated with them but the evidence, as we have seen, is fractured.27VAs a class, therefore, these objects are as much by-products of succeed-ing eras of museum collecting and of contemporary, often narrow arte-fact study as they are of chance finds or the accident of survival. Suchobjects, collected as archaic or exotic survivals, were (and still are)exhibited with a miscellany of artefacts or within a particular group ofartefacts for comparison and contrast; thus the museum itself formsthe way in which we perceive and judge objects.

Publishers accept orconnive at this process when, for the purposes of marketing a book, theyinclude token references to material culture with an illustration or two ofcharms and amulets from museum collections; too often these appear tobe randomly selected for their curiosity value and physical form and littleattempt is made to explore the material culture otherwise in the text.These objects and their display hold a mirror to their respective ages ofcollection, more so arguably than to the history, in the strict sense, ofwitches and witchcraft. Insights provided by these objects go beyondmaterials and supposed social contexts and take us into attitudes, preoc-cupations and even fears of the finders’ own generation, backed up bysometimes spurious scholarship as well as by literature.28Museum dis-plays may be constructed with the bona fide intention of educating andentertaining but the generally artificial grouping of these charms againstwitchcraft is deceptive and by and large unfortunately misleading.Viewed under glass in a display case, frisson is more immediate thanenlightenment and myths are reinforced rather than dispelled.AppendixManuscript letter accompanying NMS A.1905.1008 & APaisley 19thJune 1854Dear SirIt is long since I should have given you an account of how I procuredMaggie Lang’s Snuff Mill. You will have it now however, and I will state toyou nothing but plain facts. While my friend Mr John Dickie and I werecanvasing for the Philosophy of Witchcraft an acquaintance of mine toldme that a descendant of Maggie Lang’sresided in the Parish of Erskine,and that he had a snuff millthat belonged to her when she was living andhad been in the possession of the family ever since her death. Next day Iwent to the parish of Erskine and called on the person who had the relicof a woman whose name is celebrated over the whole country. I told himmy errand, and he took me into the house and showed me the Snuff Mill.I was proud to see it, and after talking with him for some time about hisancestors, I told him that I was going to publish a work on Witchcraft heseemed surprised at it, and told me that if I was going to write about hisgreat grandmother that I was to take the Snuff Millhome with me; I didso with pleasure, and it has been in my possession ever since, till Ihanded it to you. My friend Mr John Dickie – now dead – who assistedme in getting up the work, took it to London with him where he resided246Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland9780230_507883_12_cha10.pdf 19/10/07 9:54 AM Page 246"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"some time, but when he came back to his native place it was handed backto me.

It is complemented byfour recent books. Stuart Macdonald, The Witches of Fife: Witch-Hunting ina Scottish Shire, 1560–1710(East Linton, 2002), looks at all aspects ofwitch-hunting within the framework of a regional study, and stresses therole of the church. P. G. Maxwell-Stuart, Satan’s Conspiracy: Magic andWitchcraft in Sixteenth-Century Scotland(East Linton, 2001), focuses onmagical practice in the period up to about 1597. Its tendency to treatwitchcraft confessions and accusations as transparent accounts of realevents has been criticised by several reviews, notably that in ScottishHistorical Review, 82 (2003), 303–7, but this book has valuable material ona number of individual cases. It is followed by P. G. Maxwell-Stuart,Abundance Of Witches: the Great Scottish Witch-Hunt(Stroud, 2005), a morecircumspect study of the period 1658–62 largely assembled from shortnarratives of individual cases. The fourth recent book is Julian Goodare(ed.),The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context(Manchester, 2002), a predecessorof the present book. This includes a bibliographical essay discussing worksthat had appeared since Larner’s classic study in 1981. There is also a moredetailed review of the revival of Scottish witchcraft studies: StuartMacdonald, ‘Enemies of Godrevisited: recent publications on Scottishwitch-hunting’,Scottish Economic and Social History, 23 (2003), 65–84. Thisincludes a full bibliography of publications from 1992 to 2002. The revivalof scholarly interest signalled by these recent works has continued, andwhat follows is a survey of work done in the field since about 2002.One significant work to appear recently is not a book but an onlineresource: Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller and Louise Yeoman,‘The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, 1563–1736’ (www.shc.ed.ac.uk/ witches/,archived Jan. 2003, updated Nov. 2003). This consists of a database ofall known witchcraft cases during the period when witchcraft was asecular criminal offence, with interactive online search forms and supporting material.There have been a few studies of elite belief. The beliefs of the earlyReformers, and their limited grasp of what went on in Scottish commu-nities at the time of the passage of the witchcraft act in 1563, are thesubject of Julian Goodare, ‘The Scottish witchcraft act’, Church History,9780230_507883_13_fr.pdf 19/10/07 9:56 AM Page 249"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"74 (2005), 39–67. This is complemented by a study of the single mostprominent Reformer, John Knox, which points out his numerous con-tacts with witchcraft and particular interest in necromancy, but alsothe influence on him of folkloric narratives that could not facilitatewitch-hunting: Julian Goodare, ‘John Knox on demonology and witch-craft’,Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte, 96 (2005), 221–45. For Scotland’smost prominent demonologist, King James, there is a new edition ofhisDaemonologie(1597) in King James VI & I, Selected Writings, (eds)Neil Rhodes, Jennifer Richards and Joseph Marshall (Aldershot, 2003).Keely Fisher, ‘Eldritch comic verse in older Scots’, in Sally Mapstone(ed.),Older Scots Literature(Edinburgh, 2005), includes a detailed studyof a sixteenth-century parody of necromancy.Recent studies of folk belief have concentrated on fairies and theirrelationship with witchcraft. Emma Wilby, ‘The witch’s familiar and the fairy in early modern England and Scotland’, Folklore, 111 (2000),283–305, notes points of similarity between English familiars and Scottishfairies; the two concepts are combined in Emma Wilby, Cunning Folk andFamiliar Spirits: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern BritishWitchcraft and Magic(Brighton, 2005). Some caveats on the concept of‘elfshot’ are offered by Alaric Hall, ‘Getting shot of elves: healing, witch-craft and fairies in the Scottish witchcraft trials’, Folklore, 116 (2005),19–36. P. G. Maxwell-Stuart, ‘Witchcraft and magic in eighteenth-centuryScotland’, in Owen Davies and Willem de Blécourt (eds), Beyond the WitchTrials: Witchcraft and Magic in Enlightenment Europe(Manchester, 2004),81–99, reviews a number of magical practices. Lizanne Henderson, ‘Thesurvival of witchcraft prosecutions and witch belief in South West Scot-land’,Scottish Historical Review, 85 (2006), 54–76, provides details from aregional study. A number of topics connected to witchcraft are discussedin Lizanne Henderson (ed.), Fantastical Imaginations: the Supernatural inScottish History and Culture(East Linton, 2006, forthcoming).Fresh light on a famous case of witchcraft and demonic possession isoffered by Hugh McLachlan (ed.), The Kirk, Satan and Salem: a History ofthe Witches of Renfrewshire(Glasgow, 2006), an edition of documents onthe Paisley witchcraft panic of 1697. On this see also Hugh McLachlanand Kim Swales, ‘The bewitchment of Christian Shaw: a reassessment ofthe famous Paisley witchcraft case of 1697’, in Yvonne G. Brown andRona Ferguson (eds), Twisted Sisters: Women, Crime and Deviance in Scot-land since 1400(East Linton, 2002), 54–83. This volume contains otherchapters of interest, notably Gordon DesBrisay, ‘Twisted by definition?Women under godly discipline in seventeenth-century Scottish towns’,137–55. Kirk sessions and their quest for godly discipline formed the250Further Reading9780230_507883_13_fr.pdf 19/10/07 9:56 AM Page 250"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"background to many witchcraft prosecutions. Godly discipline is thesubject of Margo Todd, The Culture of Protestantism in Early ModernScotland(New Haven, Conn., 2002). Although this book has littlespecifically on witchcraft it provides essential context for the subject.Another approach to contextualising witchcraft is taken by LaurenMartin, ‘Witchcraft and family: what can witchcraft documents tell usabout early modern Scottish family life?’, Scottish Tradition, 27 (2002),7–22, which moves out from the witchcraft trials themselves to thedomestic context in which beliefs were held and accusations made.There are a number of publications on witch-hunting. The much-repeated idea that special procedures were used for witch-hunting in the 1590s is criticised by Julian Goodare, ‘The framework for Scot-tish witch-hunting in the 1590s’, Scottish Historical Review, 81 (2002),240–50. Michael Wasser, ‘The privy council and the witches: the cur-tailment of witchcraft prosecutions in Scotland, 1597–1628’, ScottishHistorical Review,82 (2003), 20–46, provides an important complementto the study of witchcraft panics by showing how prosecutions wererestrained between the panics of 1597 and 1628–30. For the prosecutionsof the 1640s there is John R. Young, ‘The Scottish parliament and witch-hunting in Scotland under the covenanters’, Parliaments, Estates andRepresentation, 26 (2006), 53–66. Julian Goodare, ‘Men and the witch-hunt in Scotland’, in Alison Rowlands and Jenni Grundy (eds), Witchcraftand Masculinities in Early Modern Europe(forthcoming), argues that therewas more than one ‘witchcraft stereotype’ and that some male witcheswere conceived as having distinct roles; it also discusses men as witch-hunters. Torture is a much-discussed and complex issue: how often were witchcraft suspects tortured, and did sleep deprivation (the mostcommon form of coercion) function as torture or count legally as torture?The issue is surveyed by Stuart Macdonald, ‘Torture and the Scottishwitch-hunt: a re-examination’, Scottish Tradition, 27 (2002), 95–114. Thisis complemented by a study of judicial torture more generally: Brian P.Levack, ‘Judicial torture in Scotland during the age of Mackenzie’, StairSociety Miscellany, iv (2002), 185–98.Further procedural issues are addressed by two important editions of texts: ‘The trial of Geillis Johnstone for witchcraft, 1614’, (eds) MichaelB. Wasser and Louise A. Yeoman, and ‘Witchcraft commissions from theregister of commissions of the privy council of Scotland, 1630–1642’,(ed.) Louise A. Yeoman, both in Scottish History Society Miscellany, xiii(2004), 83–145, 223–65. These editions also range more widely, providingfascinating material on popular beliefs and ritual practices, as well as theattitudes of clerical and legal elites to witchcraft.Further Reading2519780230_507883_13_fr.pdf 19/10/07 9:56 AM Page 251"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Aberdeen, 65, 74, 154, 216;Aberdeenshire, 74–91 passim, 99Aberfoyle, 110acts,seewitchcraft actsAdam, Isobel,* 171adder stones, seespindle whorlsAikenhead, Thomas, 177, 183, 219,226Aitken, Bessie,* 90Aitken, Margaret, ‘great witch ofBalwearie’,* 89Alan, Margaret,* 152ale and brewing, 28, 29, 54, 80, 108Alexander, Margaret,* 33Alloa, 29, 35, 36, 156almanacs, 201alms, refusal of, 54amulets,seecharms and amuletsAnderson, Alexander, 80Anderson, Elizabeth,* 155, 168Anderson, Grissel,* 25Anderson, John, minister of Collace,6angels, 1, 12, 38, 111, 145, 156, 157Angus, 83, 97animals, magical use of, 197, 198;manifestations of, seeDevilanimism, 32Anne of Denmark, queen of Scots, 72Antidote against Atheism, An(1655),183Antiochia, 155, 163–4; see alsoDevilAppin, 107Applecross, 197Argyll, 194; bishop of, seeCampbell,Neil; countess of, seeDouglas,Agnes; earl of, seeCampbell,Archibald; synod of, 104Aristotelianism, 41, 209, 211, 213,214, 215, 216, 220, 221Arran, 97, 104arrowheads,seeelfshotassizes, 91, 96, 133astrology, 32, 187, 201; see alsoScot,Michaelatheism, 176, 177, 209, 210, 212, 219;see alsoblasphemyAubrey, John, 218Auld Hornie, seeDevilAuld Nick, seeDevilAuldearn, 39, 128, 132, 150, 153Ayr, 134–5, 143, 158; Ayrshire, 107,128Bain, Margaret,* 75, 76, 77–8, 82, 86,87, 91Baird, Walter,* 194Balfour, Alison,* 194Balquhidder, 110Bancroft, Richard, 173Banffshire, 110baptism, 40; renunciation of, 171; see alsodemonic pactBarbreck’s Bone, 236Barclay, George, 79Bargarran, 178, 217, 244Barker, Janet,* 40Bathgate, 152Bathgate, Elizabeth,* 36Bavent, Madeleine, 178Baxter, Richard, 173, 175, 176, 182Bayonne, 4beads: agate, 243; amber (lammerbeads),243Beelzebub,seeDevilBehemoth,seeDevilBeir, George,* 188252IndexAsterisks* denote persons accused of being witches.
