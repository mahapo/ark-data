Even in those early days, she became active in archaeology, chiefl y at Native American and colonial sites in Pennsylvania. She gradu-ated from Gwynedd-Mercy College (Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania) and received Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology and Latin from Bryn Mawr College (1974). For her dissertation project she traveled to the sites of Phoenician and Punic colonies around the Mediterranean in order to research Etruscan-Punic Relations, a project that contrasted Aristotle’s description of the treaties between Carthage and the Etruscan cities with the realities of trade goods found in Etruria and the Punic world. She has participated in excavations in the United States, United King-dom, Italy and Greece. She has taught at the University of Liverpool, University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University of Chicago, Drexel University, Saint Joseph’s University, Dickinson College, Bryn Mawr College and the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to her extended periods of residence in Italy and Greece as a graduate student, she has also been based in The Netherlands (Leiden) and in the United King-dom (Manchester) before her return to the Philadelphia area. She has been an Honorary Curator at The Manchester Museum, and worked on collections in the Liverpool Museum and the British Museum. Most recently (2003), she was Curatorial Consultant for the newly reinstalled Kyle M. Phillips Etruscan Gallery of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and her catalogue of the Etruscan collection was published in 2005. Jean MacIntosh Turfa is one of a very select number of scholars in the United States who are Foreign Members of the Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici.Scholarship and mentorshipJean Turfa’s interests are both broadly constructed and deeply probing, as anyone who knows her (or has studied with her) can attest. Working from a scholarly framework constructed on her own research into the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"way the Etruscan world interacted with its Mediterranean neighbors, she has gone on to explore questions of Etruscan religion and ritual practice, with the aim of sparking new inquiry into fundamental aspects of the Etruscan civilization.Jean Turfa usually undertakes topics that have received very little pre-vious exploration that require a truly interdisciplinary approach, which even today remains quite uncommon in Classical archaeology. Thus, her collaboration with engineer Alwin G. Steinmayer Jr. on roof con-struction and ship building has produced a series of important articles and a forthcoming book, while her work with physical anthropologist Marshall Becker is pushing the frontiers of Etruscan osteology. In her pioneering work on anatomical votives she has delved into medicine and recently wrote a review of ancient DNA investigation with which a molecular biologist would be more than satisfi ed.One element that unites her myriad work is the careful attention that is always paid to every piece of evidence—Jean Turfa’s approach is such that each individual object or issue receives full treatment, as reviewers have remarked. Francesca Serra Ridgway observed, in a review of Turfa’s catalog for the Etruscan gallery at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology,All this J. Turfa has done with truly remarkable competence and skill, both in the individual entries and in the introductory chapters (1–60), deploying the most recent international scholarship (the list of references [298–308], all relevant, is impressive) to produce the maximum of infor-mation in the most readable of styles: it is extraordinary today to fi nd a single scholar capable of such a feat (393).1Reading Turfa’s catalogue grants one as full an understanding of the collection as can be hoped for, with each object’s current state (and past history) meticulously presented.Another important aspect of Jean Turfa’s scholarly activities regards academic reviews, which she uses in a didactic way, to such an extent that her reviews of scholarship approach the threshold of being new contributions themselves. The thorough attention Jean pays to a volume she reviews both pays a compliment to the author and serves as a treat for the reader in that she generously provides copious background bib-liography and information to help contextualize the title under review. 1 F. R. Serra Ridgway. 2006. Review of The Etruscan Gallery of the University of Penn-sylvania Museum, by J. M. Turfa. JRA 19: 393–395.xxiv jean macintosh turfa—an appreciation"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"For many students of ancient Italy, her reviews of complex scholarship often provide a valuable starting point for navigating new contributions to the fi eld.This thorough approach has also become part of the experience and scholarly practice of the students Jean has mentored during her career. Her students profi t from her instructional approach throughout, using the material she presents in class to construct their own multi-faceted understanding of the Etruscan world. While trying to furiously transcribe notes Jean regaled us with about the ancient Etruscans and Phoenicians, we were both humbled by her acumen and exhilarated by the realization that there was still so much to think and write about antiquity—and Jean has never intimidated or belittled students, rather she prefers to lift them up and set them on their own trajectory of understanding.Jean Turfa is a scholar with integrity who is willing to share, collabo-rate and advise on any matter—a fact to which many of the signators of the tabula gratulatoria can testify. The generosity of her spirit is such that nothing is excluded from it: it extends to her students, former students, colleagues, peers, abandoned cats and creatures of all kind. Indeed, Jean Turfa is a singular person and scholar. This volume is a small token of appreciation, respect and admiration inspired by and intended for her. jean macintosh turfa—an appreciation xxv"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY OF JEAN MACINTOSH TURFABooks1974 Etruscan-Punic relations.

Nevertheless, the fi rst substantial general work on the subject in English, The Religion of the Etruscans edited by Nancy de Grummond and Erika Simon, appeared only in 2006. One of the most important chapters in this volume is “Votive offerings in Etruscan religion”, written by Jean MacIntosh Turfa. On her 60th birthday, we offer this volume on votives, places and rituals in Etruscan religion.While conceived as a Festschrift, the volume aims at addressing specifi c areas of Etruscan research, thereby complementing The Reli-gion of the Etruscans and the new translation of J.-R. Jannot’s Religion in Ancient Etruria (2005). It is intended mainly for scholarly audience and will be of particular interest to Etruscologists, scholars of ancient religion and culture, and also to classicists and ancient historians and archaeologists.The studies collected in this volume are written by archaeologists, historians, art historians, philologists and anthropologists, refl ecting the wide range of approaches that permeate the work of Jean MacIntosh Turfa. All of them, however, deal with various aspects of Etruscan religion, a topic that has bean at the heart of Jean Turfa’s research from the very beginning.Each essay is a separate chapter with footnotes and bibliography.

These implements were carefully folded before they were buried, provoking a number of questions pertinent to archaeologists and historians alike: how were these objects used? Why were they ritually “killed” before their deposition? How do they compare to objects at other Etruscan sites, as well as those outside Etruria, that have been folded in a similar way or altered before they were deposited? On one level, these instru-ments serve as key points of stratigraphic information to be recorded carefully. But what is important for archaeologists and historians alike not to forget is that someone, at some point in time, dedicated these objects, thus causing them to be in the spot where they were found. The axe, the shield and the lituus from Pian di Civita are all material traces of a human action defi ned as ritual.In the interpretation of artifactual evidence we often see a means to reconstruct human behaviors of the distant past, and in few contexts are those behaviors as multifaceted as in the ritual context. For, in the simple act of devotion, the dedicant makes an offering that, in its own way, is a transaction between the mortal and the divine; for those seek-ing to understand not only the action of the dedicant, but the society in which he or she lived, the object given becomes much more than a token and is in fact a powerful tool for unraveling the past.A ritual is a repeated action carried out with intention, according to a prescribed or evolved tradition that develops within a family, com-munity or society. Habitual actions such as these can be found in a variety of contexts in antiquity—both sacred and profane—whether they refer to religious rituals conducted by a priest or a worshipper, an offering made to the dead by a family member, a formal food-sharing or a banquet. The rituals developed by a society encompass some of its core religious beliefs and as such are important clues for understanding a society as a whole."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"2 hilary becker and margarita glebaFor scholars of the ancient Mediterranean world, Greek, Latin and Etruscan textual sources have offered invaluable evidence for ancient religious thought and practice and have long stood as the primary source of much religious and historical scholarship. While these sources continue to aid our understanding of ancient ritual, they do not con-vey the entire picture. They may offer prescriptions on holidays or the genealogy of a god, but they may not explain all the activities that took place at a sacred precinct or at the graveside. Ritual can best be mapped by uniting a range of disparate and often overlapping informa-tion, including not only ancient textual sources but also inscriptions, votive objects and the sites themselves.1There are different ways to investigate and reconstruct the rituals of a given population. Perhaps one of the more useful tools for study-ing ritual is to look for evidence of the material that is a by-product of ritual behavior. Rituals can be associated with a range of physical evidence, including both stationary (e.g. altars, benches, hearths) and moveable objects (e.g. lamps, bells, censers, ex-votos, etc.). Remnants of food consumption or the osteological remains of animal (or human) sacrifi ce may also provide evidence for ritual. The location of the ritual is likewise of paramount importance for reconstructing it, especially since the arrangement, and even the intentional deposition or breakage of ritual objects within the area of a given site can inform us about the physical activity of ritual and worship.Admittedly, many aspects of ancient belief systems do not fi nd expression in material culture but, on another hand, we should con-sider how we read the evidence when it does survive. In the case of votive dedications, for example, some of the objects that may come to be dedicated were originally used in daily life. Thus it is important to ask whether we can always tell the difference between the daily and the ritual use of an object. Even the role of the ritual equipment itself could change over time, for an object used as a censer could be taken out of use and dedicated to the god, as an offering.It is fortuitous when physical markers of ritual behavior are left behind, such as ritual offerings or when we have a fi gural depiction of a ritual act in the form of sculpture, painting or coroplastic art. And yet many rituals that are carried out physically, such as prayers, songs, 1 On the archaeology of ritual, see Barrett 1991; Renfrew 1994; Whitehouse 1996; Bell 1997; Insoll 2004; Kyriakidis 2007; Fogelin 2007."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"  introduction  3dances, the recitation of texts, processions, are often not discernable in the archaeological record. So while we will glean as much as possible from a myriad of different types of sources, it is important to remem-ber that we may never be able to reconstruct some aspects of physical ritual and ceremony.With these caveats in mind, archaeological evidence, iconographic, textual and epigraphic sources, along with varied methods of investi-gation offer important tools and a broader context for reconstructing ancient rituals. Even though the process of reconstructing the ritual behavior from strictly an archaeological point of view is not always easily accomplished, nevertheless, the potential benefi ts of such a study are great, as ultimately rituals can provide invaluable information about the society that participated in these rituals.Etruria offers an exceptional opportunity to probe the extent of ritual practices in the ancient world, because of the diverse range of evidence available for the study of Etruscan religion. The Etruscans enjoyed a reputation in ancient times for their religious practices and indeed Livy wrote that the Etruscans were deemed ‘the most religious of men’ (Livy 5.1). It is hardly surprising, then, that the topic of Etruscan religion has long been a subject of intense and prolifi c study.As the honoree of this volume has observed, “there is plenty of sound and cautious scholarship on Etruscan religion now available, from monographs to compendia” (Turfa 2008).2 To name the most recent ones, Jean-Rene Jannot’s Religion in Ancient Etruria (2005) and The Religion of the Etruscans edited by Nancy T. de Grummond and Erika Simon (2006) provide comprehensive overviews of Etruscan religion, based on combined literary, archaeological and artistic evidence. Our understanding of Etruscan gods and their mythologies has also been expanded by the publication of Etruscan Myth, Sacred History and Legend by Nancy T. de Grummond (2006) and Larissa Bonfante and Judith Swaddling’s Etruscan Myths (2006).

The papers explore specifi c questions about Etruscan ritual: Who were the dedicants that left inscribed votives at the temples? To what gods did they give tribute? What is the evidence for mortuary ritual? Was a priest distinguished by a special costume and what did a sacrifi cing worshipper wear? How did the ritual sphere impact its community on the social and economic level? What were some of the basic rituals, whether sacred or profane, with which an Etruscan, whether rich or poor, would have been famil-iar? Etruscan ritual is approached here through different case studies, considering mortuary customs, votive rituals and other religious and daily life practices.Mortuary ritual is one of better investigated subjects in the archae-ology of ritual, often due to the nature of the material (cf. Parker Pearson 2001; Rakita et al. 2005). In Etruria, burial archaeology has been a primary focus for a long time, but new aspects of Etruscan funerary customs are being addressed now. For example, numerous interpretations of the symbolic nature of grave goods have been put forward that actively reconstruct social order and identity (e.g. Bietti Sestieri 1992; Damgaard Andersen 1993; Riva 1999). The monumental quality of elite Etruscan burials offers the opportunity to investigate the spatial organization of the mortuary cult through the study of funerary sculpture and architecture (e.g. Steingräber 1997; Izzet 1996; Steingräber and van Kampen in this volume). Mortuary ritual can be investigated further by studying the processes of body internment, such as cremation and inhumation (Iaia 1999, 113–116; M. Becker in this volume), as well as ritual practices accompanying the interment, such as sacrifi ce and banqueting (Pontrandolfo 1995).Votive religion is another highly important aspect of Etruscan reli-gious life. Votive gifts offered a tanglible connection between mortals and the supernatural (Osborne 2004). In Etruria, votive objects included pottery, anatomical models, bronzes, terracottas, coins and aes rude 3 Reviewed by Turfa 2008."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"  introduction  5(Turfa 2006a).4 The object to be dedicated could be created for the purpose or it could be ‘converted’ to be used as an offering from daily use. The places where dedications could be made also varied: votive offerings were left in local shrines, temples at federal sanctuaries or even in far away places (Naso 2000; Gran-Aymerich in this volume). Whether humble or grandiose, gifts to gods could be marked with an inscription providing us with a glimpse of who dedicated them and to whom they were dedicated (Colonna 1990; Briquel and H. Becker in this volume).Less obvious in the archaeological record but at least partly illus-trated by the written sources are other kinds of religious and every day rituals, such as divinatory practices (augury, haruspicy, brontoscopy), curses, city or building foundation rituals and banquets. Thus, the recent re-analyses of the brontoscopic calendar of P. Nigidius Figulus, preserved in a Byzantine Greek translation (Turfa 2006b and 2007), and the Liber linteus zagrabiensis (van der Meer 2007 and in this volume) provide a means to add to our knowledge about the etrusca disciplina from Etruscan sources.While the papers brought together in the present volume are formally organized into the three categories of votives, places, and rituals, in actuality these topics represent three sides of a larger phenomenon and indeed the interests of many of the papers overlap. The fi rst section deals with a range of different votive objects. These papers explore how, by whom, and where these votives were used. Jean Gran-Aymerich con-siders Etruscan products found outside Etruria. He provides an overview of Etruscan products found in the western Mediterranean that show the presence of Etruscan commerce, and, at times, the presence of the Etruscans themselves, in different regions. After documenting the extent of the interconnections, Gran-Aymerich focuses on bucchero because this ware is clearly used as a votive material in sacred contexts. He believes that certain sets of bucchero, which were not found in known sacred contexts, might nevertheless have been prized votive objects.Dominique Briquel on the other hand focuses his investigations on a single site, examining the numerous votive inscriptions from the Portonaccio Temple at Veii. This context offers a rich and unparal-leled opportunity to understand votive practice, for the objects that 4 Corpus delle Stipi Votive in Italia series gives excellent morphological and typological account of material."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"6 hilary becker and margarita glebawere dedicated give us insight into the identities of quite a number of dedicants at this important sanctuary. Briquel’s study concentrates on 20 legible names from votive inscriptions, providing onomastic infor-mation and the clear impression that donors came from various areas of Etruria. A few donors are well-known from other inscriptions and are clearly members of the higher aristocratic levels, who practiced ceremonial gift exchange and were proud of displaying their sumptu-ous offerings. Furthermore, this epigraphic evidence demonstrates the international signifi cance of the Portonaccio sanctuary.A third approach is taken by Margarita Gleba who concentrates on a particular class of votives, textile tools, and offers an extensive survey of the different ways that these implements could be used as ex-votos by cultures all over Italy. While pottery, terracotta fi gurines, bronzes and anatomical votives from votive deposits have been subject to extensive studies, this important class of votive objects has never been consid-ered as a group. Gleba’s investigation reveals that textile implements such as loom weights, spindle whorls, and needles were not only used in votive deposits, but also in foundation deposits (in Sicily) and can also provide evidence for the presence of textile workshops within the sanctuary complex itself.The second section concerns the various places associated with Etruscan religious practices, both in the realm of the living and in connection to burial rituals. The fi rst three papers focus on Etruscan sanctuaries and dedicatory behavior.Hilary Becker investigates the Etruscan temple as an economic insti-tution, considering some of the many activities that occurred there. In particular, she focuses on the social function of the votive dedications made there, viewing the sanctuary as an important forum in which elites and indeed entire communities could advertise their social status and personal resources, while at the same time paying proper religious rever-ence. The sanctuary also fulfi lls a necessary socio-economic role within its community, in that it could act as a center of redistribution.Ingrid Edlund-Berry questions whether the Etruscan temples them-selves could have been votive offerings. While historical or epigraphical evidence can allow us to see how and why a temple was founded as a dedication in the Roman sphere, there is less comparable evidence available for Etruscan foundations. Edlund-Berry thus considers what is known about various Etruscan temples in terms of their chronology and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"  introduction  7layout. She reasons that while it may not be possible to identify named ‘founders’ of such temples and sanctuaries, in certain circumstances it is possible to connect the existence of some temples to specifi c historical events and general peaks of activity within the context of a city.Gregory Warden presents new evidence for dedicated objects from Poggio Colla thereby providing the opportunity to understand votive behavior within a specifi c context. Warden reviews a number of votive deposits that have been found in or near the sanctuary on the acropolis of this settlement. For example, one deposit contained a large amount of bronze items, some of which appeared to have been deliberately cut up and possibly burnt. This deposit and many others, which are votive in nature, attest to votive religion at Poggio Colla from the Archaic period to the site’s destruction, and they physically document destruc-tion rituals previously suspected from historical sources.The next two papers examine physical aspects of Etruscan funerary cult. Stephan Steingräber looks at the architectural evidence for a cult of the ancestors by focusing on the Cima Tumulus at San Giuliano as well as other comparable sites. His review of funerary markers such as cippi attempts to defi ne what were the focal points for funerary rituals.Iefke van Kampen concentrates on funerary sculpture found in and around the tombs and representing mortals, gods, or animals. Through the painstaking collection of evidence for the original locations of the sculptures, she demonstrates how they might have served as indicators of boundaries and focal points in the funerary context. Furthermore, the positioning of the sculpture may have been based on the Etruscan cosmological map.The last section probes the limits of what we can reconstruct when it comes to ritual in Etruscan religion. These contributions examine different types of sources for ritual behavior with their inherent biases. All of them, however, provide evidence that allows us a glimpse of specifi c religious behaviors, practices, customs and beliefs.Gilda Bartoloni presents recently excavated evidence of ritual behav-ior from Populonia during the late 8th–early 7th centuries BCE. The discovery of nearly 100 cups in a building interpreted as ‘the king’s house’ has implications for understanding the history of this area, for it seems as though a banquet took place before the building was abandoned. While the evidence seems to indicate that ritual behavior occurred, it may not have been religious ritual behavior. Bartoloni’s"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"8 hilary becker and margarita glebapaper explores what we know about how deposits can be ritually used to mark the end of a building and for what cultural reasons a ritual such as the consumption of wine might have been useful.Next, Nancy de Grummond’s paper explores the ritual breakage of mirrors, objects which are still imbued with superstition to this day. de Grummond brings together all of the extant mirrors that have been broken, inscribed with magical formula or otherwise mutilated. The number of such mirrors and their distribution across space and time is suffi cient to argue that the mutilation of mirrors was a signifi cant ritual phenomenon in Etruria. de Grummond’s paper delineates the extent of this ritualistic behavior, showing how mirrors could be inscribed (and thus dedicated for the tomb), or folded, gauged or even hammered. This paper provides insight into Etruscan beliefs about the power of refl ective surfaces as magical pathways to the afterlife.Larissa Bonfante reviews the available evidence for Etruscan religious and ritual dress. While the available sources for ritual dress (whether archaeological, iconographical or literary) can be limited and biased, it is nevertheless important to probe which costumes might have had ritual meaning among the Etruscans. In particular, Bonfante discusses the costumes and attributes of priests and priestesses, as well as the costumes that were reserved for special ceremonies and situations. Inter-estingly, some of the costumes used by offi ciants in Roman religion can be detected in Etruscan art. For example, the apex of the distinctive hat (the galerus) of the fl amines bears a similarity to the twisted hat of the Etruscan haruspex, thus showing the survival of certain features of Etruscan ritual dress over time.While Bonfante’s paper focuses on priests and priestesses, Fay Glinis-ter seeks to understand a particular element of costume, the veil, and the ways that it was used by different cultures in central Italy for rituals of sacrifi ce. In order to probe this question, Glinister studies ritual costume by looking at terracotta votives. Her paper explores the commonly-held belief that veiled terracotta votive heads can be interpreted either as proof of a Roman presence, or of Roman infl uence on religion in the sanctuaries of fourth-third century BCE Central Italy. This Romano-centric bias towards seeing the Romans as the religious innovators of using a veil during sacrifi cial rituals obscures the fact that this custom was not unique to the Romans and not even used during all ritual occasions by the Romans. Glinister questions the extent to which these votives, and indeed veiled sacrifi ce, represent uniquely Roman custom. She concludes that such terracotta votives are neither characteristically"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"  introduction  9Roman in form, nor in origin, since the epicenter of their use seems to lie in Etruria, suggesting instead that ritual behavior in Central Italy was modifi ed (but not ‘Romanized’) as a result of mutual interactions between ‘conqueror’ and ‘conquered’.Bouke van der Meer surveys the Liber linteus zagrabiensis in order to reveal the wealth of information about Etruscan ritual and deities that can be gleaned from this important text. van der Meer gives linguistic information about the origin of the text and comments on several key passages that shed light on the nature of the text. In his review of the different gods that are mentioned in the text, van der Meer considers the words Lur and Zer, both of which he believes are minor deities previously unknown to scholarship.Finally, Marshall Becker demonstrates the quantity and quality of information that can be observed from osteological remains for our understanding of cremation burial ritual. Marshall Becker surveys the use of cremation over time in Villanovan and Etruscan society, making note of class distinction in terms of burial container and the crema-tion process. He focuses on an adult female cremation that was found relatively intact in a cooking pot buried outside of a chamber tomb in Tarquinia. While so much of the history of Etruscan dead centers around the elite, this burial offers the opportunity to understand bet-ter the cremation and burial processes used for people of lower status. While osteological evidence has not often been taken into consideration in Etruscan studies, it is clear that these remains can provide invalu-able information about mortuary ritual, especially insofar as the very different ways that the elite and other classes were buried and com-memorated after death.While the papers in this volume are organized according to the overarching topics of votives, places and rituals, there is a considerable amount of overlap and interchange between them. Thus, Stephan Ste-ingräber, Iefke van Kampen and Marshall Becker all make signifi cant contributions to the understanding of ritual in the funerary realm, each using different methodologies and bodies of evidence. Their inquiries inform us further as to the ways that architecture, sculpture and burial remains can help us understand the rituals that the living performed for the dead.Many of the studies in this volume focus on votive dedications from a number of different perspectives, thus providing a range of case studies on this important topic. Some of these papers, such as those by Gran-Aymerich, Gleba and Glinister, concentrate on the votives themselves."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"10 hilary becker and margarita glebaFrom their papers it is clear that a detailed study of votive objects can offer potentially valuable information for our understanding of the beliefs and religious practices of the Etruscans. Furthermore, Hilary Becker and Edlund-Berry both consider whether the temples themselves were votive dedications, arriving at divergent conclusions. Other papers focus on the individuals who donated the votives. These studies range from the microscopic, such as Briquel’s study of the individual names, to more macroscopic views, such as the papers by Hilary Becker and Warden that consider the social function of ritual behavior.Although the papers of Warden, Bartoloni and de Grummond cover very different subjects, they all document the ritual burial of objects. These papers demonstrate that an object could intentionally be buried and removed from circulation, and that in some cases (such as those presented by Warden and de Grummond) the object was defaced, bro-ken, burned or rendered unusable before burial. The life of the object was thus ended so that the sacred function that it served could not be undone by later reuse. Thus it seems that there is increasingly ample testimony for the ritual destruction of objects in Etruria.The papers of Glinister, Bonfante and Gleba all reveal the ways that costume can be used for ritual purposes, whether to clothe a worship-per, priest or a votive statue. It can also be observed that priests and worshippers, such as those described in Bonfante’s and Glinister’s papers, would have probably utilized texts such as the Liber linteus, which van der Meer presents, so that they could perform their duties on the proper days. In turn, the ritual garments and books could have been produced in the sanctuary textile workshops discussed by Gleba.Although the studies in this volume focus on different aspects of Etruscan ritual, all make marked use of a combination of archaeologi-cal, textual, epigraphical and iconographical evidence from the Etruscan as well as the Greek and Roman worlds. Furthermore, several of the papers touch upon the differences and similarities between Etruscan, Greek and Roman attitudes towards specifi c rituals. Edlund-Berry, Gleba, Bartoloni and Glinister use their material to point out impor-tant intercultural comparisons, reminding us that even in ancient times nothing existed in isolation.Reconstructing the past is never an easy task. Reconstructing past beliefs and rituals is even more challenging. But the interdisciplinary approaches of contributors to this volume demonstrate the different pathways which lead us towards understanding ritual that was once familiar."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"  introduction  11BibliographyBarrett, J. 1991. “Towards an Archaeology of Ritual.” In Sacred and Profane: Proceedings of a Conference on Archaeology, Ritual and Religion.

La Méditerranée occidentale et l’aire du détroit de Gibraltar jusqu’à Huelva offrent un nombre considérable de gisements qui ont livré des objets étrusques, avec une remarquable concentration sur l’arc catalano-provençal. On constate pour cette distribution maritime un large éventail de produits: principalement, des vases céramiques (bucchero, céramique étrusco-corinthienne, impasto), des amphores de transport, des bronzes, ainsi que plusieurs inscriptions, des ivoi-res, des monnaies et indirectement des denrées périssables (vin et huile, mais aussi des parfums et vraisemblablement des tissus).

L’hinterland celtique et, dans une moindre mesure, l’intérieur de la péninsule Ibérique ont livré un ample répertoire d’objets métalli-ques étrusques et italiques provenant dans leur grande majorité de tombes aristocratiques. Il s’agit principalement de vases de bronze et d’ustensiles de banquet, mais aussi d’objets de parure, d’armes et, pour l’Espagne, de coffrets d’ivoire. De toute évidence, la présence de ces objets étrusques dans la péninsule Ibérique se situe dans la prolongation d’un transport maritime. Par contre, le monde celtique a connu un double système de distribution: l’un exclusivement terrestre, à partir de l’Étrurie padane et des cols des Alpes, et l’autre maritime par le Midi de la France. En effet, “l’isthme gaulois” offre des carac-téristiques remarquables, que nous avons qualifi ées “d’exception de la Gaule”, car intervient ici la conjonction du réseau exclusivement terrestre et du réseau maritime de l’arc catalano-provençal qui se prolonge vers l’intérieur, suivant des modalités et des fl uctuations chronologiques qui restent en grande partie à approfondir.53. La Méditerranée orientale et la mer Noire, ainsi que le nord des Balkans et l’Europe orientale présentent des découvertes sporadi-ques, dont on retient surtout les objets de bronze découverts dans la plupart des grands sanctuaires du monde grec, en particulier à Delphes, Olympie, Égine et Samos.6Dans le cadre de cette vision générale, nous présentons ici une série de cas, qui permettent de nuancer l’absence apparente en Occident d’objets étrusques parmi les offrandes dans les sanctuaires, ou dans les lieux à caractère sacro-institutionnel. Les cas envisagés ici se classent en quatre catégories:3 Pour les épaves avec du mobilier étrusque depuis le littoral étrusque jusqu’au Midi de la Gaule: Cristofani et Pelagatti 1985; Gori 2002; Gantès 2002; Egloff et Ramseyer 2005. Pour les épaves avec du mobilier étrusque sur le littoral ibérique: Musso et Remesal Rodríguez 1991; Vives Ferrandiz 2005 et Vives Ferrandiz (sous presse).4 Nous envisageons ici la Méditerranée occidentale en dehors du noyau de la péninsule Italique et des îles (Corse, Sardaigne et Sicile).

Les niveaux de destruction de ces espaces au Ve siècle ont livré des enduits peints et un ensemble de vaisselle et d’amphores d’une qualité tout à fait excep-tionnelle par rapport aux découvertes déjà faites dans l’habitat grec domestique. L’ensemble a été interprété comme le témoignage d’un espace de banquet public, dining room. C’est dans ce contexte qu’a été découverte une inscription tronquée étrusque (Fig. 4). Le texte a été tracé sur la partie haute d’une amphore à vin fabriquée à Marseille même, à la fi n du VIe siècle. Il s’agit d’une inscription écrite de droite à gauche, dont la fi n peut se lire . . . ve, ce groupe étant précédé d’une lettre dont il ne subsiste que deux traits obliques.18 D’autres inscriptions étrusques découvertes récemment à Marseille ou dans l’épave du Grand Ribaud F ont été interprétées comme des marques de propriété ou liées à la production et à la commercialisation de vases étrusques (Long, Gantes, Rival 2006; Colonna 2006b, 678 pl.

Tel n’est pas le cas de cette inscription apparemment longue, aux traits larges et soigneusement gravés sur la partie la plus visible d’une amphore locale, trouvée dans un espace de caractère politique et rituel. Ce texte étrusque de Marseille présente une grande similitude avec celui d’une inscription étrusque gravée sur une coupe laconienne du troisième quart du VIe siècle et trouvée dans les fouilles du sanctuaire d’Aphaia à Égine. Ce dernier texte, dont la graphie renvoie à Caeré, pourrait témoigner de la par-ticipation d’un Étrusque à un repas rituel (Cristofani 1994, 159–162. Voir aussi: Colonna 1993; Naso 2006a, 373). L’inscription du Collège Vieux-Port témoignerait aussi d’une cérémonie, au cours de laquelle un étruscophone aurait pu faire hommage à une assemblée de convives du vin contenu dans ce récipient.17 La description de ce chantier et de l’inscription sont extraites de: Briquel, Gantes, Gran-Aymerich et Mellinand 2006.18 Colonna propose de lire “. . . thve . . .” et de l’interpéter “. . . celui d’ici . . .” en réfé-rence non pas au vase mais au contenu: Colonna 2006b, 676."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" ‘gli etruschi fuori d’etruria’ 21Ampurias en Catalogne: le trépied avec inscription étrusque et les deux statuettesLe site d’Ampurias (Fig. 1, no. 4) est le premier de la péninsule ibéri-que où a été reconnue avec certitude la présence d’objets étrusques.

Considérant le caractère votif de cette statuette, le plus vraisemblable est qu’elle provienne des remblais des environs, transportés lors du comblement des citernes à l’époque tardo-romaine, remblais qui devaient inclure certains éléments d’une favissa. De telles favissae auraient été découvertes à Carthage, par exemple à la lisière du plateau de Bordj-Djedid dans le secteur de la nécropole de Sainte-Monique, secteur des Rabs.48La korè de Dar-Seniat est le plus bel exemple de bronze votif étrus-que, parmi les très rares cas de fi gurines indépendantes, et non des appliques de vases ou de trépieds, localisées loin du territoire étrusque.49 Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas, selon nous, d’une représentation de divinité mais d’une donatrice, le lien avec un culte féminin, peut-être celui d’Uni-Turan, Venus-Aphrodite ou Astarté, nous semble le plus vraisemblable (Colozier 1952, 63).

Les probables offrandes étrusques de Saint-Blaise et de MalagaUn sanctuaire intra-muros à Saint-Blaise, Bouches-du-Rhône et une probable dédicace à UniLe Midi de la France a livré dernièrement une petite mais très impor-tante série d’inscriptions étrusques, parmi lesquelles l’exceptionnelle plaque de plomb de Pech Maho près de Narbonne, datée du deuxième quart du Ve siècle; alors que l’une des faces présente un texte grec, l’autre comporte un texte long d’environ 25–30 mots étrusque sans lien avec l’autre. L’inscription étrusque fournit la première mention épigraphique de Matalia (Marseille) et offre des affi nités avec les ins-criptions d’Aleria en Corse.50 Les graffi tes de Lattes, exécutés sur des vases étrusques (bucchero tardif, impasto) aux formes utilitaires (écuelles, bols), ont permis de lire des prénoms féminins en caractères étrusques et d’identifi er ainsi la présence de femmes étrusques dans ce comptoir portuaire avec très probablement un sanctuaire, au pied du site de Substantion (Montpellier).51 Pour Marseille, nous avons déjà mentionné plusieurs graffi tes, dont celui trouvé au chantier du Collège Vieux-Port, qui correspondrait à une offrande rituelle pour un banquet. Le site de Saint-Blaise, commune de Saint-Mitre-les-Remparts, situé entre Istres et Martigues, au fond d’une série d’étangs accessibles à la navigation jusqu’à l’époque pré-romaine, a fourni la plus importante concentra-tion de céramiques étrusques du Midi et un nombre de graffi tes que la révision des vieux fonds tend à faire croître (Colonna 2001).52 La der-nière découverte épigraphique importante correspond à un document de Saint-Blaise (Fig. 1, no. 6), publié dans le recueil des céramiques 50 Cristofani 1995.

Colonna permet de reconnaître une inscription étrusque rédigée dans l’alphabet ionien utilisé à Marseille: “mi uni pi fi t[. . . .]”. Il s’agirait d’une dédicace à la déesse Uni: “l’unica testimo-nianza fuori d’Etruria di un culto, verosimilmente privato, rivolto alla grande dea etrusca, il cui maggior santuario era quello di Pyrgi”.54 Nous voudrions rappeler ici, que les derniers travaux de fouille et de prospection effectués sur ce haut-lieu de la protohistoire provençale (dans les années 1970–1980), ont révélé des éléments architecturaux remployés dans les constructions hellénistiques, qui suggèrent l’existence sur la partie haute de Saint-Blaise d’un sanctuaire indigène, compara-ble à ceux de Roquepertuse, Entremont et Glanum.55 Par ailleurs, des bassins étrusques en bronze auraient été signalés dans des sanctuaires du Midi, comme à Plérimond, Aups dans le Var, et peut-être aussi à Eyguières dans les Bouches-du-Rhône (Arcelin 2000, 95; Arcelin et Brunaux 2003, 187 fi g. 99).Le sanctuaire de l’Alcazaba de Malaga et deux probables offrandes: l’anse d’oenochoé étrusque et la plaque d’ivoire (de Carthage?)Le littoral de Malaga (Fig. 1, no. 7) offre la plus importante concen-tration d’importations étrusques de l’Andalousie méditerranéenne, dont les trois sites-clés sont Toscanos à l’embouchure du Vélez, Cerro del Villar à l’embouchure du Guadalhorce et Malaga à l’embouchure du Guadalmedina (Gran-Aymerich et al. 1991; Aubet 1994).

Cet objet a été rapproché du bronze de La Algaida, dont il a été question plus haut, et interprété lui aussi comme une probable offrande.57 La pré-sence d’un sanctuaire ou palais sur le sommet de l’Alcazaba de Malaga dès le VIe–Ve siècles est suggérée par cette précieuse pièce étrusque, mais aussi par une plaque d’ivoire non moins exceptionnelle, décorée d’une scène de culte égyptisante et que nous avons découverte sur le versant occidental de la colline, en amont du théâtre romain, lors des fouilles et des recherches effectués entre 1981 et 1987 (Gran-Aymerich 1991, 74–77, fi g. 97). La forte épaisseur de cette plaque, les marques de débitage et les deux perforations sur la tranche indiquent l’insertion de cette pièce dans un meuble important. On y voit représentée une scène d’adoration du disque solaire ailé, traitée dans le style “kouchite” et selon une technique de taille en fort relief, qui est très différente de celle des ivoires hispano-phéniciens traditionnels: par contre, on observe d’étroites similitudes avec les ivoires de Carthage du VIIe siècle consi-dérés comme de production locale.58 L’existence d’un sanctuaire sur le sommet de l’Alcazaba de Malaga est confi rmée par la représentation d’un temple à façade tétrastyle fi gurant au revers de plusieurs séries numismatiques de la Malaka punique.59D.

Si les statuettes étrusco-itali-ques de la Gaule restent problématiques, même réduits au minimum, les documents utilisables révèlent des dépôts en milieu humide évo-quant un rituel et par ailleurs ces fi gurines présentent des traits qui les distinguent radicalement des objets de prestige fonctionnels (Adam 1992, 386). Les documents les plus pertinents sont certainement ceux qui proviennent de sites du littoral méditerranéen comme Carthage, Marseille, Saint-Blaise, Ampurias, Malaga ou l’Algaida en direction de Huelva, tous lieux vraisemblablement fréquentés ou visités par des Étrusques des cités de l’Étrurie maritime (Caeré, Tarquinia et Vulci apparaissent en première ligne).

Giglioli en 1914–1916, puis Enrico Stefani en 1917–1921 et reprises par Massimo Pallotino en 1939–1940 sur le site du sanctuaire de Portonaccio à Véies1 ont donné lieu à la découverte non seulement des célèbres statues acrotériales qui font aujourd’hui l’orgueil du Musée de la Villa Giulia à Rome, mais aussi d’une série de dédicaces archaïques qui le rendent tout aussi précieux pour les spécialistes d’épigraphie étrusque que sa statuaire en terre cuite le fait pour leurs confrères spécialistes d’histoire de l’art. Ce groupe de textes, portés sur des céramiques déposées en ex-voto dans le sanctuaire lors de la première phase de son existence (environ de 600 à 540/530 av. J.-C.), lorsque le culte se déroulait encore à ciel ouvert, fut retrouvé, regroupé dans un dépôt constituant une sorte de dépôt de fondation du grand autel qui fut édifi é au cours de la deuxième phase (entre 540/530 et 510 av. J.-C.).2 Ces inscriptions furent, pour l’essentiel, publiées en deux phases. Une première série d’inscriptions, au nombre de 38 (si on exclut des documents réduits à une seule lettre), correspondant au matériel épigraphique trouvé lors des premières campagnes de fouilles, fut publiée dans les Notizie degli Scavi de 1930, par les soins d’Enrico Stefani et avec des lectures et un commen-taire linguistique de Bartolomeo Nogara.3 La seconde, correspondant 1 Sur l’histoire des fouilles sur ce site, commode présentation de Colonna dans Moretti Sgubini 2001, 37–44 (“I.

Pallottino lui-même dans la Rivista d’Epigrafi a Etrusca de 1939,4 et est désormais étudiée par D. Maras dans un appendice à la publication générale de ces fouilles parue en 2001 sous la direction de Giovanni Colonna.5 Cette nouvelle série a porté à notre connaissance dix inscriptions nouvelles et a permis de compléter par des fragments nouveaux deux des inscriptions déjà publiées. Tel quel, ce corpus épigraphique nous offre un ensemble de dédicaces absolument unique dans le monde étrusque, et constituant par ailleurs un série de documents d’une abondance sans exemple pour une époque aussi haute. Il constitue de ce fait un des témoignages les plus signifi catifs que le monde étrusque nous ait livrés sur les pratiques votives, au moins pour ce qui est de leur aspect épigraphique. À ce titre, elles offrent un aperçu exceptionnel sur la fréquentation d’un sanctuaire étrusque car, par la richesse d’éléments onomastiques qu’elles fournissent, elles rendent, au moins dans une certaine mesure, possible, l’analyse du public de fi dèles qui fréquentait ce sanctuaire—situation qu’on ne rencontre nulle part ailleurs en Étrurie.Bien sûr, toutes les inscriptions ne sont pas utilisables pour une enquête onomastique. C’est le cas de celles qui sont trop mutilées là où on s’attend à trouver une désignation onomastique. Il n’y a évidemment pas grand-chose à tirer du théta isolé qui, en Ve 3.21, suit la formule de don itan mulvanice (où, comme objet du verbe de don, le démonstratif est substitué à l’emploi habituel du pronom de première personne, selon un usage qui pourrait se retrouver dans le texte très lacunaire de Ve 3.26 si on restitue avec Rix it]an sla . . .). Il a des chances de correspondre au début d’un prénom (comme le θaniršiie qui apparaît en Ve 3.30), mais il est bien sûr hasardeux de se lancer dans la moindre proposition. Il en va de même pour les terminaisons de gentilices que sont les . . . naie de Ve 3.22 (avant le verbe de don mulvanice) et . . . niies de 3.34, qui 4 Voir Pallottino 1939. Ces inscriptions correspondent dans ET, pour les docu-ments nouveaux, à Ve 3.6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 (à regrouper avec Ve 3.40), 32, 40 (à regrouper avec Ve 3.15), 45, et à des fragments qui permettent de compléter Ve 3.13 et 31. M. Pallottino devait publier plus tard, dans StEtr 20 (1948–1949), 261, Ve 3.44. Plus récemment, G. Colonna a publié dans Colonna 2002b un nouveau fragment de Ve 3.44, qui permet d’adjoindre au texte de dédicace de coupe étrusco-corinthienne attribuée au Pittore dei Rosoni publié par M. Pallottino une formule indiquant le nom de l’artiste qui l’a réalisée.5 Voir Maras 2002, 261–273 (sans le nouveau fragment de Ve 3.44, mais avec des inscriptions nouvelles, no. 44, 45, 209, 443, mais qui n’apportent pas d’éléments onomastiques)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" les inscriptions votives du sanctuaire de portonaccio 45apparaît dans la dédicace d’un grand vase de bucchero, désigné par la séquence parlante mi θina, que ce personnage avait offert à Aritimi, Turan et Menerva, document capital pour la défi nition du culte qui était rendu en ces lieux et ne s’adressait pas à la seule Minerve, évo-quée dans plusieurs autres documents (Ve 3.10, 29, probablement 33 s’il convient de restituer men]erva[s, 45, 4.1).6 Même le eprinie, probable fi n de gentilice qui se lit—diffi cilement—sur le fragment de panse de bucchero Ve 3.41, n’appelle pas de rapprochement dans ce que nous connaissons de l’onomastique étrusque et ne peut être utilisé dans le cadre d’une enquête onomastique.Les inscriptions qui ne livrent qu’un prénom ne sont elles non plus guère utilisables pour une enquête onomastique: c’est le cas de Ve 3.16 et 17, après la formule de don, mutilée mais restituable sous la forme mini muluvanice, textes qui présentent le prénom masculin Larice, suivi seulement, dans la première de ces deux inscriptions par la première lettre du gentilice, un K (ce qui voulait dire qu’il commençait par ka . . ., mais cela ne nous avance guère); c’est le cas également pour le la qui suit, avant une cassure, mi]ni mulvanice en Ve 3.18, qui peut encore avoir été Larice, mais aussi bien Larq ou Laris, et pour le man qui débute ce qui peut, vu la position dans le texte, avoir été un prénom dans l’ins-cription mutilée mini m an[. . . tu]ruce Ve 3.31, que H. Rix pensait pouvoir lire mank[a, mais que D.

De même le tule de Ve 3.32, non nécessairement complet (ce fragment de bucchero porte mini tule que suit immédiatement une cassure), a des chances d’avoir été un élément de désignation onomastique, et plus précisément un prénom (on peut songer au prénom qui a été celui du roi de Rome Tullus Hostilius; tule est attesté comme gentilice à époque récente à Arezzo par Ar 1.1 et 94, mais il peut s’agir d’un Vornamen-gentilizium), bien que D. Maras ait préféré envisager ici un verbe tule, autrement inconnu, qui serait apparenté à tular et exprimerait une idée de délimitation.6 Pour les cultes du sanctuaire, étude fondamentale de Colonna 1987a, 425–426 = Colonna 2005, 1995–1997 pour cette inscription.

On y relève les noms suivants classés par ordre alphabétique (selon l’alphabet étrusque).Avile AcvilnasComme cela a bien été souligné entre autres par M. Cristofani et G. Colonna,7 le personnage de ce nom qui a laissé la dédicace Ve 3.7 [min]e muluvenice aville acvilnas sur un fragment de panse d’œnochoé de bucchero est par ailleurs connu par deux dédicaces, trouvées en contexte funéraire,8 à Ischia di Castro, dans la région de Vulci, au libellé comparable et portées sur des vases identiques, également des environs du milieu du VIe siècle av. J.-C., Vc 3.4 mine muluvene avile acvilnas (avec formule de don au présent)9 et Vc 3.5 mine muluvenice av[ile acviln]as. On se trouve donc en présence d’un individu, certainement de souche aris-tocratique, qui, selon la pratique d’échanges de dons dont M. Cristofani a bien dégagé l’importance dans cette société des ‘princes’ d’époque orientalisante,10 aura fait bénéfi cier de ses offrandes, orgueilleusement inscrites à son nom, aussi bien un de ses compatriotes, appartenant au même milieu social, qui les aura emportées dans sa tombe à Ischia di Castro, que le sanctuaire de Véies. On se trouve dans un cas analogue à celui du Cérite Laris Velχaina, dont on a retrouvé une offrande dans le sanctuaire de la Mater Matuta de Satricum, dans le Latium (La 3.1= CIE 8613) et une autre en contexte funéraire à Caeré (Cr 3.10), ou d’un autre dédicant du sanctuaire véien, Mamarce Apunie, dont le nom apparaît sur une grande œnochoé de bucchero, des environs de 570 av. J.-C., découverte en 1993 dans une tombe à tumulus de Lavinium (CIE 8612). Dans le cas de cet Avil(l)e Acvilnas, il est remarquable que la graphie soit exactement la même, avec recours aussi à Ischia di Castro à l’interponction syllabique et, trait plus exceptionnel, à des S en zigzag à traits multiples, selon un type qui apparaît sporadiquement dans les inscriptions de cette époque (p. ex. Cr 2.3 à Caeré), notamment dans la région falisque (outre l’épigraphie falisque, on le rencontre à Narce 7 Cristofani 1975, 142–143; Colonna 1989–1990 = Colonna 2005, 2043–2070, ici 876 = 2044. 8 Voir Colonna, l.c.: “quasi certamente da tombe”. À défaut d’indication de pro-venance précise, le fait que ces œnochoés sont intactes va dans ce sens. 9 Sur ce point, Colonna 1982.10 Outre Cristofani 1975; Cristofani 1984."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" les inscriptions votives du sanctuaire de portonaccio 47dans l’inscription étrusque Fa X.1). Étant donné cette pratique de dons et de contre-dons, parfois faits à très longue distance, la découverte des vases d’Ischia di Castro ne suffi t pas à faire du personnage un aristo-crate établi en ces lieux, ni même originaire de la région de Vulci. Une origine vulcienne a il est vrai été suggérée par C. Ampolo, mais à partir de données externes: étant donné l’équivalence du suffi xe étrusque -na et du suffi xe latin -ius, bien mise en valeur par De Simone (1989a), celui-ci a su reconnaître des Acvilnas étrusques dans les Aquilii latins, famille de l’aristocratie romaine qui a donné à la cité un des premiers consuls de la république, le consul de 487 av. J.-C. C. Aquilius, au sur-nom signifi catif de Tuscus.11 Selon C. Ampolo, l’introduction de cette famille serait à situer dans le contexte d’apports vulciens représenté par l’établissement des frères Vibenna. Une origine vulcienne, bien sûr, ne peut rester qu’hypothétique.AmanaCe mot qui se lit, précédé d’un intervalle qui montre qu’il commen-çait par la séquence ama . . ., et avait des chances de se fi nir, sans point d’interponction syllabique, par une siffl ante de forme, S, se lit sur un petit fragment d’un grand vase de bucchero (Ve 3.4: ] amanas [ ), est vraisemblablement une forme de gentilice, formé sur une base Ama, non autrement connue. Il apparaît sur le linteau d’une tombe à cham-bre de la nécropole de Crocifi sso del Tufo à Orvieto, Vs 1.92 (mi larθia amanas), ce qui peut orienter vers un individu d’origine volsinienne, mais sans garantie bien sûr.AnaeNous incluons dans cette liste cette forme, bien que la lecture ne puisse en être totalement assurée. Elle résulte d’une proposition de G. Colonna, pour l’inscription Ve 0.5, très détériorée, portée sur quatre fragments jointifs de la panse d’un vase de bucchero, qu’il envisage de lire [mi]ni rahθpi anae amavunice.12 Le dédicant aurait été un individu 11 Ampolo 1975, 414–415 pour l’hypothèse d’une origine vulcienne.12 Colonna 1987a, 434–435 = Colonna 2005, 2003–2004. Dans ce texte, G. Colonna reconnaissait une dédicace (avec un verbe amavunice), faite au dieu Rathii, sorte d’Apollon étrusque qui aurait été associé aux déesses Menerva, Turan, Aritimi dans le temple."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"48 dominique briqueldésigné par un nom unique, cas exceptionnel dans la série et qui à cette époque peut être le signe d’une position marginale dans la société, soit celle d’un subalterne, soit celle d’un étranger. G.

Colonna, des fouilles de M. Pallottino en 1939–1940 a fait connaître un nouveau fragment du canthare de bucchero portant ce texte, donnant les deux lettres man-quantes de ce que H. Rix lisait, avec raison, comme min[ i m]ulvanice laris apaiaes (Ve 3.8).13 Ce nom, dans lequel il convient de reconnaître avec Pallottino et M. Morandi Tarabella la base Apa,14 apparaît ici formé par l’adjonction du suffi xe de gentilice d’origine italique -( i)es à une forme déjà élargie qu’on retrouve à Tarquinia, pourvue d’un autre suffi xe, dans le Apaiatru du sarcophage des Amazones, du milieu du IVe siècle av. J.-C., Ta 1.50–51, provenant de la tombe des Amazones.15 La différence de suffi xe interdit de poser une relation familiale entre les deux témoignages. On attribuera donc avec une certaine plausibilité mais sans certitude absolue, avec M. Morandi Tarabella, l’Apaiaes de Portonaccio à une famille locale de ce nom (Morandi Tarabella 2004, 690).Mamarce ApunieCe nom apparaît inscrit sur le rouleau décoré de rouelles aux extré-mités et d’une tête féminine sur la face opposée à l’anse d’une attache supérieure d’anse d’une œnochoé de bucchero qui porte une dédicace à une Venai féminine, en qui G. Colonna a proposé de reconnaître, non une femme pour qui le don aurait été fait, mais une divinité mineure 13 Voir D. Maras, dans Colonna 2002a, no. 118, 264.14 Pallottino 1939, no. 4, 459, Morandi Tarabella 2004, 71.15 Le nom de Larq Apaiatru, qui fut zil eteraia, apparaît, au génitif, porté sur le sarcophage et le couvercle de sa ‘grand-mère’ ou ‘mère chérie’ (selon le sens qu’on donne à ati nancva) Ramθa Huzcnai."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" les inscriptions votives du sanctuaire de portonaccio 49du sanctuaire.16 Le texte se lit: mini muluvanice mamarce apuniie venala ( Ve 3.5) et, comme nous l’avons rappelé, le même individu avait offert à un aristocrate latin une grande amphore avec la dédicace, portée en lettres analogues et toujours avec interponction syllabique et graphie du yod par double I, mini m[uluv]anice mamarce apuniie (CIE 8612). Le gentilice, qu’on peut estimer formé sur un nom individuel Apu, apparaît sous cette forme—et donc formé par l’adjonction d’un suffi xe -n(a)ie, combinant le suffi xe étrusque -na et le suffi xe d’origine italique -ie (De Simone 1989, 271–272)—mais aussi sous la forme Apuna(s), obtenue par l’adjonction du seul suffi xe étrusque -na, à la même époque à Caeré (Cr 3.17), pour un Larθ Apunas. Il s’agit donc vraisemblablement de deux formations parallèles et on pourra estimer que la famille des Apunie est une gens véienne, tandis que celle des Apuna(s) est une gens cérite. Mais, en en toute rigueur, la présence de cette dédicace à Portonaccio, étant donné la fréquentation du sanctuaire par des fi dèles certainement non véiens, ne permet pas de garantir l’appartenance de la famille à l’aristocratie de Véies.17Laris VelkasnasCe nom apparaît sur un fragment du rebord d’une sorte de coffret en bucchero retrouvée et publiée par G. Colonna en 1985 (Colonna 1985b), dont il a montré qu’elle appartenait au même objet qu’un fragment analogue portant le nom de la déesse Menerva, au génitif de dédicace, publiée en 1930, permettant ainsi de reconstituer la formule de dédicace laris velkasna[s mini turuce] menervas (Ve 3.10). Comme l’a ingénieusement suggéré notre collègue italien, la forme singulière de l’objet serait due à la volonté d’imiter, en bucchero, une boîte de sortes, ce qui serait un indice capital du caractère oraculaire du culte de la déesse principale du sanctuaire: le dédicant aurait choisi de commémorer ainsi sa consul-tation de l’oracle, rendu par tirage de sortes oraculaires.18 Sous cette forme, le nom Velkasnas est isolé. Mais il n’est pas exclu que ce soit le même nom qui apparaît, écrit avec un chi (mais dans une position, 16 Colonna 1987a, 429–430 = Colonna 2005, 1997–1998.17 Il nous paraît diffi cile d’affi rmer avec M. Morandi Tarabella 2004, 692 que ce Mamarce Apunie appartienne à la même famille que celle qui sera connue plus tard à Tarquinia sous le nom d’Apuna.18 Outre Colonna 1987, voir Colonna 1987a, 423–424 = Colonna 2005, 1991–1993."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"50 dominique briquelaprès [ l], où l’opposition aspirée/non aspirée est susceptible de se neu-traliser), dans un graffi te portant le gentilice Velcasnas, sans prénom, inscrit auprès d’une fi gure de lutteur peinte sur une paroi de la tombe Cardarelli, à Calvario, près de Tarquinia (Morandi 1999, 384–385), remontant à la fi n du VIe siècle av. J.-C. Ce nom serait celui d’une famille aristocratique: M. Morandi considère, sans doute à juste titre, qu’il peut diffi cilement désigner le lutteur lui-même, mais doit plutôt indiquer la lignée nobiliaire qui l’employait. Cette famille peut être, mais non obligatoirement, locale: d’autres athlètes sont désignés par d’autres noms de familles, Petui et Nanisei, dont on ne peut exclure qu’elles soient venues d’autres cités. Il n’y a pas non plus d’indication certaine en faveur d’une origine véienne à tirer de Ve 3.10: étant donné que certains dédicants sont certainement venus d’autres villes, et même si il y a une probabilité générale que la plupart soient véiens, on ne peut affi rmer, dans des cas particuliers comme celui-ci, qu’on soit en présence d’un représentant d’une famille locale. Le prestige du sanctuaire et de son oracle a pu y attirer un Velkasnas établi dans une autre cité, et le cas échéant à Tarquinia si on interprète en ce sens le graffi te de la tombe Cardarelli.19Mamarce Vel[x]nsnasNous incluons dans cette série cette inscription, 0A 3.4, dont l’appar-tenance à la série reste hypothétique.20 Elle a été suggérée par Ales-sandro Morandi à partir de documents d’archives révélant que le petit cheval de bucchero portant le texte [mini m]amarce vel[x]nśnaś turuce a été découvert à Véies avant 1876: le type de formulaire, l’emploi de la ponctuation syllabique incitent à penser que cet ex-voto a pu être découvert sur le site de Portonaccio avant que des fouilles régulières ne s’y déroulent (Morandi 1989, 585–588). On ne peut donner à cette proposition un caractère plus assuré que celui qu’elle peut avoir. Mais on soulignera, dans le cadre de cette hypothèse, l’intérêt de rencontrer une inscription dont les autres traits graphiques correspondent aux 19 La graphie avec S et non siffl ante fi nale rendue par le signe en croix et l’absence de ponctuation syllabique ne sont pas des arguments suffi sants pour exclure une origine véienne. M. Morandi Tarabella (2004, 690) considère la lignée comme véienne.20 Nous laissons au gentilice (dont la graphie offre une lacune qui peut ne pas repré-senter plus d’une lettre) une forme indéterminée, aucun nom connu ne présentant des séquences vel- puis -nsna(s)."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" les inscriptions votives du sanctuaire de portonaccio 51traits les plus typiques de l’écriture de cette série d’ex-votos, mais qui témoigne d’un emploi du signe de forme M pour la siffl ante normale, caractéristique du Nord de l’Étrurie.21 On peut penser—trait sur lequel nous reviendrons—que l’auteur de cette dédicace aura voulu laisser son nom écrit avec les lettres typiques de sa région d’origine, et non celles normalement en usage à Véies. On aura affaire à un personnage issu de la partie septentrionale de la Toscane, qui aura visité le sanctuaire (si l’hypothèse de A. Morandi est fondée) et y aura offert cet objet.Larice Vestricina(s)On avait proposé de reconnaître cette désignation par prénom et genti-lice sur deux petits fragments jointifs de l’épaule d’un vase de bucchero, ]arice vest[ (Ve 3.3), avec une restitution assez sûre pour le prénom, mais plus hypothétique pour le gentilice. Elle est maintenant garantie par la présence du même nom dans la formule mine mulvanice larice vestricin[a(s)] de Ve 3.15/Ve 3.40, dont D. Maras sa montré qu’ils formaient une seule et même inscription,22 portée sur une œnochoé de bucchero.

Cependant, il n’est nullement impossible qu’à côté de la forme Pesna une forme Pesnu ait existé: nous préférons donc, avec la majorité des commentateurs, conserver la forme Pesnu.

Et pour Ve 3.2 une lecture conservant zinaie demeure tout à fait possible.Mais, si on retient une séquence pesnu zinaie, un problème d’interpré-tation se pose. Avec sa terminaison en -u, Pesnu peut apparaître comme une forme de cognomen, qui qualifi erait le personnage désigné juste auparavant, Velθur Tulumnes: il serait désigné par une formule trimem-bre, associant prénom, gentilice et surnom, Velθur Tulumnes Pesnu. On aurait alors affaire à un seul individu, pourvu d’une désignation onomastique à trois éléments. Et zinaie ne serait pas à rattacher à la sphère onomastique: le terme serait à rattacher à la base qui a donné le verbe zinace, il a fait (ou fait faire), et serait une dénomination de l’artisan, obtenue sur cette base par l’adjonction du suffi xe -aie.

Le gentilice est en effet bien attesté à Caeré, par cinq inscriptions de don au contenu identique, mi spurieisi teiθurnasi aliqu, qui se lisent sur trois coupes et deux œnochoés de bucchero du dernier quart du VIIe siècle av. J.-C.

Tous ces objets étant apparus sur le marché des antiquités dans les années 1960, la provenance de Caeré ne peut être assurée par les conditions de la trouvaille, qui restent inconnues, mais est suffi samment garantie par la typologie de ces vases pour pouvoir passer pour sûre. Comme l’a relevé G. Colonna, on se trouve certainement en présence du mobilier d’une tombe fouillée clandestinement qui a été dispersé.55 Ce Spurie(i) Teiθurna appartenait à une famille de Caeré, ce qui trouve 54 M.

Le nom d’un autre représentant de la même famille, Karcuna Tulumnes, apparaît comme celui du donateur d’une belle œnochoé de bucchero avec anse à rouelles trouvée lors des fouilles de Pallottino (Ve 3.6: mini mulvanice karcuna tulumnes). La graphie de l’inscription est du même type dans les deux cas et recourt aux traits les plus caractéristique du corpus épigraphique du sanctuaire: usage de la ponctuation syllabique et emploi du signe en croix comme signe de siffl ante. Cela est en accord avec le fait qu’on a affaire à une famille de Véies: pour une fois le nom a des résonances dans la littérature, puisque ces deux Velθur et Karcuna Tulumnes du VIe siècle av. J.-C. appartiennent à la famille qui est connue pour avoir donné l’occasion à Cornelius Cossus, en 438 av. J.-C. (à moins que ce ne fût en 426 av. J.-C.), de remporter les secondes dépouilles opimes de l’histoire de Rome, en punissant celui qui est présenté comme le roi de la Véies d’alors, Lars Tolumnius, du crime qu’il avait commis contre l’inviola-bilité des ambassadeurs en faisant mettre à mort les quatre délégués de l’Vrbs venus protester contre la défection de Fidènes.57 On se trouve en présence d’une des plus grandes familles de l’aristocratie locale, capable d’avoir donné un chef suprême à la cité dans le troisième quart du Ve siècle av. J.-C.

Tolonios, ainsi que d’une autre, offerte par le même personnage à Cérès dans le temple de Campetti de la même ville.58 On peut ajouter, selon une remarque faite par M. Pallottino lors de la publication initiale de Ve 3.6, que le choix du prénom, rare et précieux, de Karcuna refl ète bien le caractère aristocratique de cette famille,59 dont le nom apparaît formé, sur la base tulume-, par une superposition de suffi xes de formation de gentilices, celui étrusque en -na et celui, d’origine italique, en -ie.60Nous avons retenu vingt noms de familles qui nous paraissent attes-tés—parfois avec des problèmes de lecture ou d’interprétation—sur les objets déposés en ex-voto dans la première phase de la vie du sanctuaire du Portonaccio, dans la première moitié du VIe siècle av. J.-C., vases dont les restes, brisés sans doute intentionnellement, ont été déposés dans le soubassement de l’autel qui fut ensuite édifi é en ces lieux. Ils montrent clairement le rayonnement de ce lieu de culte, qui recevait les offrandes d’une famille locale de premier plan, comme celle des Tulumnes, dont la tradition romaine nous affi rme qu’un des membres régna sur la cité au siècle suivant—et dont l’importance était donc comparable, pour cette cité, à celle qu’eurent les ancêtres maternels de Mécène, les Cilnii, pour Arezzo—celle d’un condottiere aussi illustre que le Vulcien d’origine Aulus Vibenna, celles d’individus connus pour avoir répandu leurs présents ostentatoires d’un bout à l’autre du monde étrusco-latin, comme ces Avile Acvilnas et Mamarce Apunie dont des cadeaux portant le nom ont été retrouvés, pour le premier dans une tombe d’Ischia di Castro, pour le second dans une tombe de Lavinium.

Il est vrai que, dans le détail, il est le plus sou-vent diffi cile de déterminer avec certitude l’origine géographique des dédicants—et nous serions sur ce plan plus prudent que certains de nos devanciers. Mais quelques cas au moins sont sûrs, et nous mettent en présence d’individus sûrement non véiens: c’est le cas du Teiθurna de Ve 3.37 et du Vestricina de Ve 3.15/3.40 (dont un parent se retrouve peut-être en Ve 3.3), d’origine cérite, du Velkasnas de Ve 3.10, peut-être tarquinien, du Qurtiniie de Ve 3.14, dont le nom renvoie à une origine cortonéenne, des Hvuluves de Ve 3.9 et 30, au nom latin (ou falisco-latin), et bien sûr d’Avile Vipiennas, d’origine vulcienne puis fi xé à Rome.

Tout se passe comme si, le cas échéant, les dédicants avaient voulu signifi er leur origine extérieure en faisant inscrire leur nom avec des particularités qui n’étaient pas celles de l’écriture locale—et en l’occurrence en jouant sur le choix des signes de siffl antes, qui est le signe de différenciation le plus net 61 Voir en dernier lieu G.

These votive gifts could be simple and derived from daily life or more elaborate and produced specifi cally for the purpose. Their place of dedication could be a natural landmark, such as a spring, cave, or tree, or an artifi cial construction, the latter becoming more elaborate with time with a precinct clearly marked off as a dwelling place of a deity.Spinning and weaving implements have been found frequently in Italian votive deposits and sanctuaries, which range chronologically from the Early Iron Age to the fi rst centuries BCE.2 These fi nds not only add another dimension to our view of ancient religious practices but are also important for our understanding of the development of social values and traditions associated with textile production. Unfor-tunately, contexts for votive material are not always clear and it is not always easy to differentiate textile implements that served as ex voto from those used in the actual textile production process (Bouma 1996, 24–30). Nevertheless, on the basis of the published material it is pos-sible to distinguish three groups of contexts differing in both intent and composition of material: actual votive deposits, foundation deposits and sanctuary workshops.31 This article stems from my doctoral dissertation Textile production in pre-Roman Italy: Archaeological Evidence, written under supervision and guidance of Jean M. Turfa. Many a loom weight cited here has been spotted by her in publications consulted for entirely dif-ferent purposes. This humble offering is for her, my teacher, mentor, colleague and friend.2 On Etruscan votive religion, see Turfa 2006, who briefl y reviews similar practices in other regions of Italy as well as in Greece. Also see Bouma 1996 and Bartoloni, Colonna and Grottanelli 2001.3 On the problematics of votive terminology, see Hackens 1963; Bouma 1996, 43–51. In the following discussion, all assemblages of votive offerings will be referred to as ‘votive deposits’."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"70 margarita glebaVotive depositsSpindle whorls, spools and, especially, loom weights are common dedica-tions in Etrusco-Italic sanctuaries, as well as in the south of Italy and in Sicily, where the practice was probably also infl uenced by Greek votive practices. For the most part, textile implements are present in deposits that are related to real cult sites with a wide chronological range, as opposed to deposits which were created on a particular occasion.4 Table 1 summarizes information about textile tools from various votive deposits of Italy. While it is far from exhaustive, it illustrates the importance of textile implements in votive ritual. In an effort to be as comprehensive as possible, sites are listed at which textile tools have been reported, even when the precise number of tools has not been published.The examples in Table 1 illustrate that, while frequently present in votive deposits, textile tools are never very numerous. More substan-tial quantities are noted in large sanctuaries, which were frequented for many centuries or in contexts for which other explanations can be suggested, as will be discussed later.It has been often assumed that the presence of textile implements in votive deposits indicates a connection of the cult to divinities regarded as protectors of women and domestic activities (Mastrocinque 1987, 111). In the Greek world, for which we have not only archaeological but also literary evidence from early on, Athena and Hera were, of course, the two most important recipients of women’s gratitude: the fi rst as the goddess of the loom, the second as the patroness of marriage and domestic activities.5 Textile implements are also common in sanctuaries of Demeter and Kore, Aphrodite, Artemis and Herakles.6 Local divini-ties were common recipients of textile implements as well.4 See discussion on different kinds of votive complexes in Pascucci 1991, especially 469–471.5 Textile tools and clay kalathoi, special baskets for storage of wool and food, are ubiquitous offerings at the sanctuaries of Hera at Perachora, Argos; see Baumbach 2004, 34, 91.6 Herakles was venerated in connection with transhumance and pastoral activities, and hence wool production (Santillo Fritzell 2004, 82).

Gem impressions representing Herakles appear on some unprovenanced loom weights (Ferrandini Troisi 1986, 97).

Thus, 4th–3rd century BCE weights from Puglia have an owl with human hands in the act of spin-ning (Wuilleumier 1932, 47; Di Vita 1956, 43; Barber 1992, 106–107, 151).7 A Greek terracotta of Athena Ergane with a dressed distaff from Scornavacche in Sicily, dated to the 5th century BCE, also illustrates the goddess at the task of spinning.8 The depiction of Athena Ergane with spindle and distaff was typical but Pausanias (7.5.9) notes that Athena Polias of Eretria also had these attributes. Other gods, whose inscribed names or stamped attributes appear on loom weights, are Herakles, Demeter, Hera and the Fates.Italian counterparts of the Greek divinities received similar gifts. A loom weight fragment inscribed VEI was found by the western wall of Roselle; it has been dated c. 300 BCE (van der Meer 1987, 113). The excavator suggested that the object was created for the goddess Vea (Ceres/Demeter). Another inscribed loom weight of unknown prov-enance is currently in the Civic Museum at Viterbo (Emiliozzi 1974, 243 no. 527).9 It reads, in Etruscan, ATI and, according to Emiliozzi, may have been dedicated to Mater Matuta.10 Recently, loom weights with letters possibly signifying their votive purpose were excavated at Campo della Fiera, an area of Orvieto believed to have been the site of Fanum Voltumnae, a major Etruscan sanctuary and gathering place.11 Generally, however, the practice of inscribing loom weights with votive dedications is atypical in Etruria, yet common in South Italy, where it may have been imported by the Greek settlers.12In South Italy, we fi nd loom weights inscribed with the names of Greek divinities, such as Athena, Hera, Demeter and Herakles (Wuil-leumier 1932, 38–39; Orlandini 1953, 442; Ferrandini Troisi 1986, 97; Di Giuseppe 1995, 141). An unprovenanced loom weight from Sicily bears an inscription ΧΑΡΙΤΕΣ, which is interpreted as a dedication to 7 Pyramidal weights with an owl have also been found in Athens. 8 On this fi nd and on the cult of Athena Ergane in Greece, see Di Vita 1954. It should be noted that, the dating for the terracotta is based on stylistic grounds. 9 The collection also houses numerous other weights that were inscribed with single letters before fi ring.10 It could, however, be a name or mean ‘mother’. See discussion in Ambrosini 2002, 159.11 I am grateful to Simonetta Stopponi for this information.12 Only two possible cases of the same practice have been documented in Etruria. See Ambrosini 2002, 159, who justly notes that in the absence of clear context for either loom weight, it is impossible to make judgments about the destination of these objects."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"74 margarita glebathe Graces, who were also regarded as patrons of textile crafts (Pace 1946, 482).13Different views have been expressed as to the meaning of textile implements in votive and sacred contexts: they may have been attached to (matrimonial) garments given to the deity; used to close small bags, which contained food to be eaten at the sacrifi cial meal; given to ask protection over weaving; or to symbolize the work of a wedded woman (Bouma 1996, 392). It has also been suggested that this category of votive objects is connected to the rite of passage into adulthood or mar-riage (Chieco Bianchi 1988, 67; Maioli and Mastrocinque 1992, 27).It has also been argued that weights themselves were not votive gifts but instead, were attached to garments or other textiles (Mingazzini 1974, 204–206). This view, however, does not explain their presence in small votive deposits and it also does not explain the presence of other textile implements, such as spindle whorls, spools and needles in votive contexts. It is also unlikely that anyone wanting to dedicate a garment would buy it on the market: surely these were woven at home with particular care, either by the dedicant herself if she was a woman, or, if a man—by his female relative). The low intrinsic value of a loom weight or a spindle whorl is not a suffi cient reason for it being unsuitable as a votive gift, since, as in the case of the textile implements found in funerary contexts, it is the symbolic signifi cance of the object that made it an ex voto par excellence.14 This interpretation is confi rmed by numerous dedicatory epigrams in the Palatine Anthology, which record women dedicating their spinning and weaving tools to deities.15Foundation depositsLoom weights have also been found in what have been identifi ed as foundation deposits. So far, they have been excavated only in Sicily, so we are dealing here with a geographically limited set of rituals. Initially thought to be associated with sacred buildings and areas, and hence with some kind of consecration ritual, loom weights have since turned 13 Together with the Seasons (Horai), the Graces were credited with weaving Aphrodite’s robe; see Hom. Il. 5.338, and Scheid and Svenbro 1996, 57.14 See Ferrandini Troisi 1986, 97–98, for literary evidence.15 See Book VI: 39, 47, 48, 160, 174, 247, 284, 285, and 288.

The use of loom weights in the foundation deposits of sacred buildings starting in the Archaic period likely developed from the symbolic signifi cance these objects already acquired in votive contexts.16 The foundation ritual then spread to include non-sacred constructions as well.SanctuariesAlong the south and north walls of an Archaic building in Vassallaggi, six trapezoidal weights were found under the pavement (Adamesteanu 1958, 309). Three of these weights were deposited together with Late Corinthian pyxides, each systematically deposited in a small fossa carved into the bedrock. A similar series of small rock-carved fossae, dated to the late 7th to early 6th century BCE, each containing Ionic cups and a single large trapezoidal loom weight, were uncovered within the eastern room of a sacred building at Lentini (Adamesteanu 1956, 406, 413). In the sanctuary of Demeter Thesmophoros in Bitalemi (Gela), 30 weights inscribed ΘΕΟΤΙΜΟΣ and dated to the 5th century BCE were recovered on the south side of room G2 (Orlandini 1966, 20).17 In Syracuse, loom weights were deposited along with pottery in small fossae underneath the Altar of Hieron, dated to the 3rd century BCE (Adamesteanu 1956, 413). These small deposits have been referred to as θυσίαι, defi ned by Hackens as “separate depositions of the remains of each single sacrifi ce” (Adamesteanu 1956, 413; Hackens 1963, 88–89).City WallsA votive deposit found under the Hellenistic walls of the acropolis in Morgantina contained a discoid weight (Sjöqvist 1960, 126). A group of pyramidal weights without perforation have been found in the for-tifi cation walls at Terravecchia di Cuti (Militello 1960, 57).1816 See Orlandini 1953, 443, whose interpretation of a purely ritual function for loom weights is, however, incorrect. 17 Orlandini (1966, 20) interprets the inscription as meaning ‘worthy of god’, although it may simply be a personal name.18 Given that these objects are without perforations, they may have a function other than as loom weights."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"76 margarita glebaHousesIn Gela, under the foundations of the north wall of the 4th century BCE building A, 25 loom weights were found deposited systematically with a small lekythos (Orlandini 1953, 442; Orlandini 1962, 352). Orlan-dini initially hypothesized that the building was a cultic area, because of the numerous terracotta fi gurines of Demeter found inside, but he later identifi ed it as a private house. Not far from building A, under the east foundation wall of another late 4th century BCE house, 102 loom weights had been carefully deposited in direct contact with the foundation blocks (Orlandini 1962, 362). At the nearby site of Manfria, underneath the northern foundation wall of the 4th century BCE farm-house, three trapezoidal and three discoid weights were found under a large kylix (Adamesteanu 1958, 297, 308).The signifi cance of the presence of loom weights in foundation deposits has not been explained satisfactorily thus far. Mingazzini argued that loom weights in these contexts either were utilized as reinforce-ment material, or that they originally had some function other than loom weights (Mingazzini 1974, 212–213). While the fi rst function is unlikely, it is possible that the weights may have had some role in the foundation ritual that had nothing to do with textile production. Alternatively, the association of the loom with household activities and consequently with the house may have lead to the use of loom weights as a token of the loom to symbolically strengthen the physical foundations of the house.Sanctuary textile workshopsAs was noted in the introduction, it is frequently diffi cult to identify the exact nature of the contexts of materials classifi ed as votive. Just because the function of a structure from which the material was recovered had been religious does not automatically endow all objects found inside and in its immediate vicinity with a sacred signifi cance (cf. Warden in this volume). As is made clear from the examples listed above, the number of textile implements in votive contexts is relatively small, excepting a few cases of very large deposits, which were used for a considerable amount of time. When large concentrations of loom weights are found in sanctuaries, a different use for them can be postulated: they may have been utilized in the actual production of sacred garments within the sanctuary."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" textile tools in ancient italian votive contexts 77Greece: literary evidenceThe ritual weaving of garments for cult statues was a well-docu-mented phenomenon in Archaic and Classical Greece. That weaving activities took place in sanctuaries is known from the literary sources (Paus. 3.16.2; 6.24.10). Moreover, “the essential feature of this type of ritual is the weaving and dedication of the garment” (Mansfi eld 1985, 443). Examples include the cults of Athena Polias in Athens, Hera at Olympia, Argive Hera and Apollo at Amyklai.19The best known example is the peplos for the Athena Polias in Athens woven every year by young girls called Arrhephoroi who were assisted by Ergastinai.20 Together with the priestesses of Athena, the Arrhephoroi warped the loom on the day of Chalkeia, a festival of Athena Ergane and Hephaistos; then they wove the peplos (Mansfi eld 1985, 260, 262, 283).21 The Ergastinai spun the yarn for the peplos and may have assisted in its weaving (Mansfi eld 1985, 279, 285; Lefkowitz 1996, 79).22 The peplos took nine months to complete (Mansfi eld 1985, 283). During the time when the peplos was woven, the Arrhephoroi lived on the Akropolis but it is not known whether the weaving also took place there.23 It is possible that the loom was set up in the Temple of Athena Polias.24 The peplos was dedicated and placed on the statue of Athena Polias during the Panathenaic festival.2519 Although dedication of garments to gods was a regular practice, the ritual weav-ing of textiles for the statue or temple is not common.20 On literary evidence for the peplos, see Mansfi eld 1985, who has suggested that another, larger, peplos was made every four years by professional male weavers and that this was displayed like a sail on a mast during the Greater Panathenaia. On Arrhephoroi and Ergastinai, see Mansfi eld 1985, 260–297. On the peplos also see Barber 1992.21 On the number of Arrhephoroi, see Mansfi eld 1985, 270–271.22 It is possible that the two terms are synonymous, rather than titles of different groups of workers. On the other hand, because spinning takes a much longer period of time, it is easy to imagine a much more numerous group of women (such as the group of over a hundred Ergastinai mentioned in the late 2nd century BCE decrees IG II/III2 1034 and 1036b) who performed the task. The weaving, on the other hand, could easily be accomplished by two or four Arrhephoroi under the supervision of the priestess(es). 23 On the Athenian Akropolis, a small square building constructed at the end of the 5th–beginning of the 4th century BCE has been identifi ed as the House of the Arrhephoroi; see Stevens 1936, 490; Mansfi eld 1985, 275–276; Lefkowitz 1996, 79.24 On other possibilities, see Mansfi eld 1985, 283–284.25 The robe, being folded by an Arrhephoros (?) and the chief priest during the Panathenaic procession, is probably shown on the Parthenon Frieze (fi gures E 34 and E35); see Fig. 72 in Barber 1992, 113; Neils 1996, 185–186. Also see Mansfi eld 1985, 292–293."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"78 margarita glebaAt the temple of Hera at Olympia a robe was woven for the god-dess every fourth year by the Sixteen Women representing the cities of Elis (Paus. 5.16.2–3). A special house located in the agora of Elis was assigned for the task (Paus. 6.24.10). A similar tradition may have existed in Argos where a patos-robe was woven for Hera at the Argive Heraion (Mansfi eld 1985, 465–466; Scheid and Svenbro 1996, 23). Finally, in Sparta, a chiton was made for Apollo at Amyklai every year. Pausanias claims that the building in which it was made was located in the north-ern part of the city and was also called Chiton (Paus. 3.16.2).It is notable that, in all cases, special structures existed for the pro-duction of sacred cloth and in all cases such a structure was within the sacred precinct of the temple. Thus we should re-examine large accumulations of textile tools (especially loom weights) excavated in votive deposits, as they may be evidence of production rather than dedication.Italy: archaeological evidenceSeveral textile workshops have been identifi ed archaeologically in Italian sanctuaries. In the so-called Weaving Hut (edifi cio Vb) at Francavilla Marittima, dated to the 8th century BCE, a row of meander-decorated loom weights found in situ provides evidence for textile production in cult buildings as early as the Early Iron Age (Maaskant-Kleibrink 1993, 4; Attema et al. 1998, 337; Kleibrink 2001, 49; Maaskant-Kleibrink 2003, 63–76). The excavator of the site, Marianne Kleibrink, believes that “the looms associated with this house indicate special weaving activi-ties” (Kleibrink 2001, 49). Because subsequent building phases of this building are demonstrably a succession of temples, it is usually assumed that the hut, too, was a temple, dedicated, according to Kleibrink, to the ‘Lady of the Loom’.26 The 7th century BCE terracotta pinakes from the site, identifi ed as ‘Athena seated in her house’, have helped to identify the cult in the colonial period (Zancani Montuoro 1972; Maas-kant-Kleibrink 1993, 8; Weistra 2003).27 In these depictions, Athena is shown seated and is holding a folded peplos in her lap. Another, contemporary terracotta image from the site, often called ‘the Lady of 26 See Kleibrink 2001, 48–52, for the summary of different construction phases.27 Other pinakes with the ‘Ladies’ procession’, believed to stem from Francavilla Marittima, may indicate a ritual procession connected with the dedication of the peplos to the goddess, not unlike the Panathenaic procession in Athens; Maaskant-Kleibrink 1993, 11 and 12."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" textile tools in ancient italian votive contexts 79Sybaris’ and identifi ed as Athena, depicts the goddess standing, wear-ing a skirt decorated with fi gural bands (Maaskant-Kleibrink 1993, 9). Terracotta fi gurines produced at the sanctuary during the 6th century BCE depict dedicants holding cloth (Kleibrink 2001, 51, 53). The fi nds of spindle whorls and loom weights throughout the sanctuary confi rm its association with the craft of textile production, and it seems likely that a special robe may have been woven for the patron divinity of the sanctuary starting in the Early Iron Age.Later periods provide even more evocative examples. Large numbers of loom weights were found in and around the Oikos and the Rectan-gular Hall in the sanctuary of Santa Venera at Paestum. This shrine was dedicated to Aphrodite-Hera and was active during the late 5th and throughout the 4th century BCE. The Rectangular Hall yielded 93 weights, 47 of which were found in a group (Pedley 1990, 140, 148; Pedley 1993, 19, 118–120). They were identifi ed as votive offerings on the basis of the assumed sacred function of the buildings and the fact that they were not systematically arranged, as they would have been if in use on a loom. The context is, however, not primary, as far as one can judge, and none of the weights was found in accumulations consistent with a votive or foundation deposit.28 It remains a possibility that loom weights may have been utilized in the production of sacred garments within the sanctuary.29Another sanctuary in the area of Paestum, the Heraion at Foce del Sele, also produced a signifi cant number of loom weights. Specifi cally, 300 weights were found in the so-called Square Building, which has been dated to the late 4th–early 3rd centuries BCE (Zancani Montuoro 1966, 77; Greco and de La Genière 1996, 231–232). These objects, although initially published in an exemplary fashion, were erroneously interpreted as instruments for measuring weight (Zancani Montuoro 1966, 61).30 A recent reassessment of the material established that, in fact, the Square Building might have functioned as a sanctuary textile workshop, which produced sacred garments, possibly for some sort of peplophoric ritual (Greco and de La Genière 1996, 225; Greco 1997).31 28 Pedley 1993, 19, however, uses the same reasoning to claim that the weights were votive offerings.29 Greco 1997, 196, arrived at the same conclusion.30 This is an unlikely interpretation since, usually, instruments for weight measure-ment were made of stone or metal, materials that gave a precise weight. 31 A peplophoria has been suggested at the urban Heraion of Paestum on the basis of terracotta fi gurines depicting women walking to the right; Baumbach 2004, 116."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"80 margarita glebaThe number of loom weights indicates that at least three large looms could have been set up inside the workshop (Greco 1997, 194).At Halae, also in South Italy, a large number of discoid loom weights was found inside room F’ of the 4th century BCE West Building at the North Gate. The room may have been a textile workshop of the sanctu-ary of Athena (Goldman 1940, 479, 509–513; Mingazzini 1974, 208). One of the inscriptions found at the site mentions πεταμνυφάντεραι, interpreted as the weavers of the cloth, who may have been involved in offi cial capacity in weaving a robe for the Athena of Halae (Goldman 1915, 448; Goldman 1940, 401).Finally, as mentioned before, Pratica di Mare (Lavinium) yielded more than 350 loom weights from the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, of which more than 200 came from the Archaic Building to the NE of the altar complex, although a cultic function for this structure is not unequivocally accepted (Enea nel Lazio 1981, D189; Bouma 1996, 391). The number of loom weights strongly suggests a weaving activity within the sanctuary. So far this is the only non-Hellenic site providing evidence of textile activities within its sanctuary.32 However, there are other indications that ritual textile making existed in the Italic tradition.In Roman Italy, the offering of a cloak to the statue of a goddess was performed in times of crisis (Scheid and Svenbro 1996, 40). In one recorded example, in the year 125 BCE, an oracle prescribed the offering of richly decorated garments to Proserpina in order for the misfortunes to end (Paus. 5.16.5–6). Later, during the Second Punic War, Roman matrons offered a palla made with golden threads to Juno (Sil. Ital. Pun. 7.77–83). While no information on how and where these textiles were made is provided by the literary sources, archaeological evidence may provide tantalizing indications.ConclusionsTextile production had both symbolic and economic importance for the household and its women, whose role as spinners and weavers has been defi nitively shown on the basis of burial evidence and iconographic material. Starting at the end of the Bronze Age, textile craft became a symbol of the female sphere of life, and women’s contribution to the 32 Given this sanctuary’s association with matrimonial rites, however, such a state of affairs should not be surprising. For the discussion of the sanctuary, see Torelli 1984."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" textile tools in ancient italian votive contexts 81community as textile workers was expressed by the deposition of spin-ning and weaving implements in their burials (Bietti Sestieri 1992). The frequent presence of textile tools, particularly loom weights, in votive deposits of pre-Roman Italy is then hardly surprising, especially given the ‘materialistic’ aspect of Etruscan votive practices (Turfa 2006, 90). The more precise differentiation of these votive contexts is another mat-ter, as is the quantity of textile tools found in each specifi c case. Textile implements, although common in votive deposits, are rarely present in very large quantities, suggesting that when signifi cant accumulations of loom weights and other tools are found in votive and sanctuary contexts, especially concentrated in small areas, they may indicate production rather than religious activity.Literary and archaeological sources thus provide ample evidence for the existence of temple- or sanctuary-based textile workshops in South Italy. Specifi cally, such workshops are present in sanctuaries of Athena and Hera. It may be argued that ritual weaving was a practice imported to Italy by Hellenic colonists.33 However, the ‘Weaving Hut’ at Francavilla Marittima suggests a much older tradition in South Italy and evidence from Lavinium indicates that similar practices existed in Archaic Latium. Finding textile production areas near temples should come as no surprise since, after all, besides garments for gods, textiles were needed for priestly clothes (Bonfante in this volume) and, in Etru-ria at least, for the sacred libri lintei (van der Meer in this volume). It is probable that future review of material excavated in Etruscan and other Italic sanctuaries will show that textile workshops existed at non-Hellenic sanctuaries as well.BibliographyAdamesteanu, D. 1956. “Lentini.—Scavo nell’Area sacra della città di Leontini.” NSc 10: 402–414.——. 1958. “Manfria (Gela).—Scavo di una fattoria-offi cina.” NSc 12: 290–334.Adamesteanu, D., D.

In order to understand the social and economic roles of the sanctu-ary, this paper considers the ritual nature of the Etruscan sanctuary in order to look beyond the sacral purposes to glean the underlying social functions it served.Etruscan temples are not only places of ritual but also opportunities for community interaction and for the display of aristocratic status. Visitors to an Italic sanctuary would be met with a range of offerings given to the gods, ranging from terracotta votives to large bronze statues. When an elite person, or community, donates a valuable object, what is the social and economic value behind such an action? One issue of overriding importance to be considered here is to examine the different ways that the elites could participate in religious life in Etruria.The reasons for making a dedication to a god can often be effectively illustrated by the Latin phrase do ut des—‘I give something to you so that I will get some benefi t or healing in return’. Offerings were also left to the gods in thanksgiving for fulfi lled prayers or simply to honor them. There were socioeconomic dimensions to these customs as well and they merit our consideration in the context of noncommercial, social transactions.In the Greek world almost anything could be used as a votive, includ-ing agricultural produce, personal objects (e.g. fi bulae, spindle whorls), votive terracottas and large scale statues, among other items—and a similar range was dedicated in Etruria, as the papers in this volume make clear. It has been observed that a great deal of the Greek art that survives was originally intended as a votive offering (Whitley 2001, 136 and 141). The accounts of various Greek authors describe sanctuaries cluttered with offerings, to such an extent that occasionally the cult"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"88 hilary beckerimage itself was not visible.1 Jean Turfa describes a similar situation at Graviscae in Etruria, writing, “while many or most votives may have been heaped up in courtyards, stacked on tables, or buried in pits or wells, some, on the evidence of large stone bases, were kept on view for generations” (Turfa 2006, 97).Votive dedications were made in Etruria beginning in the Protovil-lanovan and Villanovan periods “and a continuity of preference for certain types of objects characterizes the earliest days to the latest” (Turfa 2006, 90). Some of the objects that were dedicated were marked with an inscription, usually recording the dedicant, and often the item dedicated or the divine recipient.2 Votive dedicatory inscriptions con-stitute one of the largest categories of extant Etruscan inscriptions. For example, an Attic kylix from Tarquinia reads, itun turuce venel atelinas tinas cliniiaras or “Venel Atelina dedicated this [vase] to the sons of Tinia”.3 An inscribed bronze base that is thought to have once held a statuette of Hercle (Herakles) records the dedication of Cae Siprisni on behalf of his son, for the god.4 Another dedication is a bucchero vase left at the Portonaccio sanctuary at Veii that reads: “Avile Vipiennas dedicated me”, an offering which is thought to have been left by the Vibennae brothers in the course of their expeditions.5Religious dedications are a parallel social activity to the gifts exchanged between elites. In each case, the object represents a rela-tionship and contract (whether perceived or actual) that has been established. Once inscribed, the text would serve to commemorate the transaction that resulted in the offering, thus commemorating the gift-giver as well. Inscribed religious dedications provide a way of advertising the dedicant’s name to all others in the social sphere of 1 Paus. 2.11.6; 3.26.1; See also Strabo 8.374; Diod. Sic. 5.63; Pl. Leg. 909–910; Ael. NA 7.13.2 Votive inscriptions are formulaic, typically using the verb mul(u)vanice, which means to give or donate, or tur(u)ce, which is thought to connote solely sacral dedications (Schirmer 1993; Bonghi Jovino 2005; Agostiniani 1982; Cristofani 1975; Colonna 1989–1990, 878–879).3 The vase dates to c. 500 BCE.

The base dates to the Hellenistic period and is now in the Manchester museum; its provenience is unknown. Note that Colonna and Wallace read the dedicant’s name as Cae Siprisnies (G.

At sixth-century BCE Veii for example, there were 30 dedications which had the dedicant’s name inscribed upon the object. And yet, just as with personal gifts, women also could participate to some extent, to which an inscription left at Veii by Venalia Slarinas testifi es.6 The inscription on the object is a testimony of the dedicant’s buying power, especially in so far as the object is economically ‘disposed of ’, as it will no longer be used by the dedicant and should end its life among the temple’s stores.Concerning the Greek sphere, James Whitley observed that items traditionally used for gift exchange could also be used for votive dedi-cations (Whitley 2001, 141). Both activities fulfi ll similar functions as far as conspicuous consumption and display. Even as gifts to the gods are conceptually related to gift exchange, it is only the religious dedica-tions that survive through all periods in Etruria. One of the reasons for the constancy of this institution is that religious dedications provided another outlet for socioeconomic transactions between elites. These dedications provided an opportunity for aristocratic competition and display, but one that was “sanctioned by and mediated through the gods” (Whitley 2001, 144).Some of the large objects that Etruscan elites would have dedicated include bronze statues. As a corollary to the Greek sphere, many famous Etruscan bronzes were used as votive objects. For example the statue of the Orator (‘l’Arringatore’) from Lago Trasimeno,7 the Mars of Todi,8 the bronze fi gurine of a ploughman and his oxen from Arezzo9 and the Arezzo Chimaera were votive objects. To focus on one of these, the Arezzo Chimaera has an inscription on its right, foreleg reading tinścvil or ‘offering belonging to Tinia’. This statue is thought to have been 6 Colonna 1989–1990, 878. For Venalia Slarinas, see TLE 40 and SE 1939 v. 13, 464 no. 12.7 The Orator, who is inscribed Avle Metele, was created in the 1st century BCE (Brendel 1995, 430–32).8 The Mars of Todi, even though found in Umbria, had an inscription in Etruscan letters and is generally thought to have been made in the Etruscan style. The inscription on this statue reads: “Ahal Trutidius offered this as a gift” ( Jannot 2005, 136).9 Turfa 2006, 92–93; Jannot 2005, 134–138."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"90 hilary beckerpart of a larger group, including Bellerophon and Pegasus.10 When the Romans conquered Volsinii in 264 BCE, they took as spoils 2,000 statues, and it is thought that these statues very probably were votive statues.11 In the Hellenistic period, monetary offerings were also made to temples. In 384 BCE a temple at Pyrgi was plundered for 1,000 silver talents, which perhaps provides evidence of monetary donations to that temple or the temple’s own reserves (Diod. Sic. 15.14.3).12 And while the evidence for elite dedications represents only a small fraction of what existed in antiquity, the scale of this practice and the expense that could potentially be involved, at once reveal that the institution of elite religious dedications should in the future be tallied along with other elite transactions.A fi nal word on the life of these dedicated objects is appropriate in so far as what happened to these objects after the dedication. Some of the votives were ritually buried within the temple complex, a practice that was common all over the Mediterranean and was a way of mak-ing room for new objects. Votives made from metals could be melted down for use as ceremonial objects in the temple, and we know that this occurred in Greece.13 It will also be suggested below that some votive objects could potentially be used by the administrators of the temple as a potential asset.10 The statue dates to the second quarter of the 4th century BCE and was found outside of the Porta S. Lorenzo of Arezzo in 1553. See Bonfante and Bonfante 2000, 147 no. 26; CSE USA 3; Brendel 1995, 327, 471 fn. 3. Also Colonna 1989–1990, 885 fn. 60; Cygielman 1990.11 Plin. HN 34.16; Jannot 2005, 136. Other evidence for the looting of the sanc-tuary at Volsinii may be found in a pair of inscribed bronze greaves (manufactured c. 525–500 BCE, inscribed c. 500–450 BCE) that are thought to have originally come from Volsinii but later traveled to Perugia, where they were later buried in a family tomb (Bonfante and Bonfante 2000, 144 no. 22). See also Colonna 1999.12 “Dionysius, in need of money, set out to make war against Tyrrhenia with sixty triremes. The excuse he offered was the suppression of the pirates, but in fact he was going to pillage a holy temple, richly provided with dedications, which was located in the seaport of the Tyrrhenian city of Agylle, the name of the port being Pyrgi . . . he over-powered the small number of guards in the place, plundered the temple, and amassed no less than a thousand talents” (trans.

An example of this practice from the Greek world includes helmets that were dedicated at Olympia, the inscriptions of which commemorate the defeat of the Etruscans at the battle of Cumae by Hieron of Syracuse. The inscription reads: “Hieron the Deinomenid and the Syracusans, to Zeus, the Etruscan [spoils] from Cumae”.14 An Etruscan city or general offered a similar dedication to Apollo at Delphi in the form of a tripod with an inscription on its base, the latter of which survives (Cristofani 1985, 256 no. 9.20). Mauro Cris-tofani suggested that this offering may have been left by a city, possibly Caere since the city was attested to have a treasury at Delphi (Strabo 5.2.3). Cristofani also suggested that, especially since the inscription is only partially extant, the name of an Etruscan person and perhaps even a general may have once been recorded on this tripod. Finally a comparable example in Etruria may be recorded on the marble slabs known as the Elogia Tarquiniensia, which may mention bronze objects (a bronze crown and possibly shields) given by Velthur Spurinna to a god following a military campaign.15Civic dedications on behalf of a town or group of citizens may be hypothesized as well. For example, Colonna has suggested that the Arezzo Chimaera and its statuary group could also have been a public dedication (Colonna 1989–1990, 878 fn. 60).16 Indeed so many votive objects wherein the dedicant is not named leave open the possibility, at the very least, that they could have been given by an individual or a town.Another important category of religious dedications are temples vowed by generals. As will be shown, temple dedications were a pious and evidently socially viable way to expend wealth and celebrate the reputation of the city and its elites.

One of the ways that a Republican elite person could promote himself was by constructing a temple. In the course of a military campaign, a general could vow a temple to a particular god to ask for help in a particular engage-ment. After a victory, the general would then fulfi ll his vow by the construction of said temple. This temple would be a useful gift to all community members as yet another outlet for worship but the political purpose of this temple must not be ignored. The temple would forever be associated with the specifi c general and campaign during which it was vowed and this association would hold true for his descendents as well. For example, Q. Lutatius Catulus, before he began the fi nal battle at Vercellae in 101 BCE, made a vow to Fortuna Huiusce Diei.17 This temple, now known as Temple B, came to be built in the Campus Martius in the area of the modern Largo Argentina.18 This temple was built next to that of his ancestor, C. Lutatius Catulus, who had vowed a temple to Juturna (now known as Temple A) during the First Punic Wa r.19 The visibility and accomplishment of the gens Lutatia would be promoted by means of these temples, a factor that could only enhance the political ambitions of future family members. While this is not the only means whereby temples originated in the Republic, temples dedicated by generals were signifi cant religious dedications that were imbued with important socio-political overtones.20The Pyrgi plaques may be our only record of such a practice at work in Etruria during the Archaic period. The plaques record the thanks of “the ruler of Caere”, Thefarie Velianas, for the support of Uni/Astarte.21 In return, the ruler pledges a temple (or shrine) to the goddess, a temple that Giovanni Colonna connects to Temple B at Pyrgi (Colonna 2006, 155). While there is otherwise very little evidence 17 Gros 1995; Plut. Mar. 26.3; Varro Rust. 3.5.12; Cic. Ve r r.

Fast. 1.463; Ziolkowski 1992, 95–96.20 It is known that 37 new temples (77% of the Republican temples for which we have evidence concerning the foundation) were vowed during military expeditions; for 26 of these temples, the name of the specifi c general that vowed the temple is preserved (Orlin 2002, 20). For a survey of the other occasions that are known to have prompted temple dedications in the Republic, see Orlin 2002, 18–33.21 Turfa 2006, 91; Bonfante and Bonfante 2002, 64–68; Turfa 1986, 76–77; Colonna 1965.

The etrusca disciplina was maintained by elite families in each territory ( Jannot 2004, 4,127 and de Grummond 2006a, 34–35). According to Tacitus, the emperor Claudius referred to elite Etruscan families maintaining ritual (Ann. 11.15). According to Cicero, Aulus Caecina, an elite man from Volterra, learned the religious teachings from his father (Fam. 6.6.3). The maintenance of this wisdom was a part of the civic obligations of elite families—and a part of their claim to political power.Further, there is an association between particular elite families and a specifi c god, much like the Pontii and Penarii families administered the cult of the Ara Maxima of Hercules at Rome. According to Livy, the statue of Juno in Veii was handled only by a priest of a certain family (certae gentis sacerdos) and this was thought to pose a potential problem for moving that statue to Rome after the fall of Veii (Livy 5.22). On the Capua tile, an Etruscan religious calendar, certain families are responsible for certain rites or sacrifi ces, such as the Velthur family for the month of June ( Jannot 2005, 81; TLE 2). Livy also provides a record of a king of Veii, who was the elected annual leader of the Fanum Voltumnae (a major Etruscan sanctuary), and who was respon-sible for providing actors for the games associated with the festival (Livy 5.1.5).An inscription on the sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas, wherein he lists his ancestors and the deeds of his life, may provide another example of a family dedicated to religious pursuits (Fig. 10). The inscription informs us that Laris Pulenas wrote a liber haruspicinus and administered the cult of Catha and Pacha (Bacchus) for the people of Tarquinia. His great-grandfather, Laris Pule the Greek, is thought also to have been a priest, because his name echoes that of the famous Greek seer Polles; Jacques Heurgon believes that they are either descended from Polles or that the name of the Etruscan priests was chosen intentionally to evoke his tradition.22 The association of the family name Polles/Pule and religious offi ce is carried further by a possible descendant, the 22 Heurgon 1964, 235–236; Bonfante and Bonfante 2000; van der Meer 1987, 129–130, 172–173; TLE 131.

Whether we think of the Pulenas or the Velthur family, we can agree with Jannot that, “in Etruria some cults that appear to serve the whole city-state were in reality dominated by a single family” ( Jannot 2005, 82).23Thus it seems that there were different ways that elites in particular could participate within the religious sphere. They could offer dona-tions, including objects that otherwise might have been suitable for gift exchange. Some elites may have been involved in the administration of a cult or temple, and could in rare circumstances have even sponsored a temple. Above, the life of votive objects once they had been dedicated has been considered. I suggest yet another post-dedication use for some of the objects. Is it possible that some of the votives were meant for use and appropriation by the elites who administered the cult? Agricultural produce with its short life could very reasonably have been used for such a purpose, especially since the dedication of produce may not have always overlapped with sacrifi cial meals. Karl Polanyi, consider-ing ancient societies in general, observed that, “the personnel of the temples consumes a large part of the payments made to the temple in kind” (Polanyi 1957, 27). When coinage becomes more standardized and comes to be used as an offering, this too could have been used to support the temple’s staff.24 And while this system is not analogous to the modern Christian tithe in the way that it could support its staff, it is hypothesized that many dedications were, in fact, potential economic resources that could be utilized when needed.Sacrifi cesEdible offerings would have been useful for religious ceremonies but were also very likely an important resource that was redistributed to the community. Not only could agricultural produce be used by the temple staff, as mentioned above, but it could also be given to worshippers as a part of a religious ceremony. A range of edible sacrifi ces could be offered in Etruria including: liquid libations, fi rst fruits, cakes, other 23 A comparable situation seems to pertain to the Ara Maxima Herculis at Rome. The cult of the Ara Maxima was originally private and administered by two elite families, the Potitii and the Penarii. In 312 BCE Appius Claudius as censor made the cult public (LTUR v. “Hercules Invictus”, “Ara Maxima”). See also RE III, Appius 32.24 For information on Etruscan coinage, see Catalli 1990."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" the economic agency of the etruscan temple 95small offerings and animals. The Etruscan liturgical calendar preserved on the wrappings of the Zagreb mummy provides an example of such rituals, instructing the priests and/or worshippers to “prepare the incense, offer with the decorated cup these breads”.25 The Etruscan god Vertumnus collected fi rst fruits and harvest offerings in Roman times. Propertius has the god explain his nature, writing, “I am called the god Vertumnus . . . because I receive the fruit of the changing seasons . . . the grafter discharges his debt with a crown of fruit, after the pear tree bore apples from a foreign branch” (Prop. 4.2.11, 4.2.17–18).26However, it is the sacrifi ces of animals and the communal meal that followed which merit consideration here, especially in so far as this practice provides an interesting way to look at both ceremony as well as the redistributive function of sanctuary. Sacrifi ces were an important part of Etruscan religion, as they were in Greece and in Rome. Servius uses a pseudoetymology in Greek to equate the Etruscans (Thusci ) with their propensity to sacrifi ce (thyein).27 The theme of sacrifi ce is also found in Etruscan art, where, in several cases, a central altar with a burning fl ame is the center of attention.28 For example, on a fi fth-century BCE relief originally made in the area of Chiusi, six people gather around the altar, about to sacrifi ce a bull ( Jannot 1984, 23–25, fi g. 105) (Fig. 11).Many animal sacrifices in Greece, Rome and Etruria are thought to have involved only burning the vital organs of the animal.29 The struc-ture of Etruscan and Roman animal sacrifi ces was such that the gods were thought to only want the entrails and other inedible parts of the beast. The rest of the animal (the most delectable portions) would in turn be used for a communal meal for the worshippers. It was indeed convenient that the gods were thought only to want the grotty bits for 25 Turfa 2006, 46. Roncalli 1985, 28–29, column 2.19.26 For more on Vertumnus, see de Grummond 2006b, 62–70. 27 Serv. ad Aen. 2.781. Similarly see Isid. Etym. 9.2.86.28 An example of a scene of sacrifi ce is a funerary base originally from Chiusi (now in Perugia), which shows a large body of people grouped around an altar, as well as a scene of prothesis ( Jannot 1984, 151–153, fi g. 520 and 524). See also a Campana plaque from Caere, now in the Louvre, depicting a man standing in front of an altar and mirror from Palestrina that depicts a sacrifi cial goat and the preparations before the altar ( Jannot 2005, 38–40).29 Theoph. ( peri Eusebeias) fr. 6.1.15 (available in W. Potscher. 1964. Theophrastus. ΠΕΡΙ ΕΥΣΕΒΕΙΑΣ ). Polyaenus Strat. 8.43 provides testimony of eating sacrifi cial meat in an inauspicious context. The complete sacrifi ce of an animal—when it was entirely burnt as an offering—in Greece was known as sphágia or thysíai ágeustoi and was used in times of crisis (van Straten 1981, 67)."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"96 hilary beckeras we know, Etruscans generally consumed a limited amount of meat, and thus such a sacrifi ce would have provided a convenient source of nourishment.30 In this way, each shrine or temple served a redistribu-tive function for the people that came to it, and thus a temple could fulfi ll a role comparable to that of the banquets hosted by elites.31 The communal meal surrounding the sacrifi ce served to emphasize the cen-trality and dependability of each sanctuary within its social ‘network’, just as elite banquets were a means of reinforcing the prominence of the banquet-giver within his network.ConclusionsA votive dedication represents both a point of contact and form of communication between an individual and a deity, albeit one-sided. A range of votive offerings, from the mundane to opulent, could be dedicated and this is a behavior that potentially everyone could engage in at some level. A farmer could dedicate some of his fi rst fruits with-out depleting his own resources. On the other hand, more elaborate dedications might advertise the personal surplus of the dedicant. With this transaction, the elite person can promote his status, resources and compete with other elites. Indeed the public environment might very well have in turn encouraged elite competition within the bounds of this socio-economic system. That is to say, the dedication of a large bronze statue to a sanctuary on the part of one family might inspire awe as well as encourage other families to make similarly elaborate dedications. Thus the religious sphere is another outlet for peer polity. 30 Meat was probably not a regular part of the Etruscan diet, especially for the lower classes whose diet consisted mostly of cereal and vegetables. Cattle were used primarily for their agricultural work and faunal studies indicate that they became a part of the diet only after their productive capacity had waned. Faunal evidence from Roselle and San Mario indicates that the majority of sheep and goats found there were mature and thus used to produce milk and wool, while the sheep and goat population at Populonia seem to have been raised primarily for their meat (Corridi 1987–1988; Motta, Camin and Terrenato 1993, 114; De Grossi Mazzorin 1985). Pigs, on the other hand, were the only animals used primarily for their meat (Ciampoltri, Redini and Wilkens 1989–1990, 283). The utility of cattle, sheep and goats for their byproducts and capacity for labor, in the case of cattle, when combined with the faunal evidence indicates that meat was not regularly consumed and thus underscores the importance of ritual sacrifi ces (Barbieri 1987, 49; Ampolo 1980, 24).31 On the aristocratic banquet see Zaccaria Ruggiu 2003; Terrenato 2004 and D’Arms 1984."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" the economic agency of the etruscan temple 97It might also be hypothesized that lateral social customs such as gifts exchanged between elites presumably had expected boundaries. The understood principle is that gifts were gestures and tokens that would be reciprocated in kind in time (Mauss 1990, 35–36, 41; Finley 1981, 237–238). On the other hand, elite votive dedications may have had different precepts, in that it was a one-way transaction wherein the sacral context may have permitted more conspicuous display.Sanctuaries offered a socially acceptable means for individuals, clans and cities to advertise their disposable income and good fortune, while mediating that message in the religious sphere. Just like the city and clan had stores of items that it collected, so too the Etruscan sanctuary collected the proceeds donated by individuals. And while many of these stores would come to be ritually buried and so removed from circula-tion, some of these offerings would have been used again.In all cases, some of the reasons that prompt a votive dedication would be shared by both rich and poor donors: to celebrate a birth, to commemorate a death, to ask for help in sickness or advancement in one’s profession (Schirmer 1993, 45). Even while these may have been some of the principal motivations for an offering, it can also be surmised that more costly dedications might be more common in times of great surplus, and thus a social custom could be fulfi lled when it was most benefi cial for the donor (Halstead and O’Shea 1982).It is important to consider the economic force of the religious sphere in Etruria, for the sanctuaries are not passive agents. The sanctuary was an important center of redistribution within its community, providing food to its worshippers. Additionally, its staff may have reasonably uti-lized some of the dedicated offerings. At the same time, sanctuaries were an economic magnet for a great number of objects—most of which, whether specifi cally purchased for dedication or used in daily life and later dedicated, would fall out of circulation after they were dedicated. The magnitude of disposable expenditure that occurred at Etruscan religious sites is not insignifi cant. Also worthy of note is that some elite families were intrinsically tied to a particular deity or religious site. It seems that the Etruscan temple provides a forum for elite consumption as well as leadership. Thus the basic social roles that are important in daily life are refl ected in the religious sphere. The economic agency of cultic practices and sanctuaries has been considered but little in Etruria and early Rome, although it was important. Clearly the combined forces of religious ceremonies and the dedicatory habit were a meaningful and constant element in Etruscan socio-economic life."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"98 hilary beckerBibliographyAgostiniani, L. 1982.

According to the narrative in Livy, the building was fi rst ‘vowed’ by Tarquinius Priscus during the Sabine war (Livy 1.38), completed by Tarquinius Superbus with the help of Etruscan engineers (Livy 1.56), and ultimately dedicated by the newly elected consul, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, in the fi rst year of the Roman Republic, 509 BCE (Livy 2.8).3Although seen through the account of later, Roman sources, the Capitoline temple exemplifi es the cultural milieu of Rome during the 6th century BCE. Its layout and decoration fall within the Etrusco-Italic framework, with parallels from Rome itself (temples at S. Omobono: Colonna 2005a and 2006, 155),4 and at neighboring communities to the north (Portonaccio temple at Veii: Colonna 2006, 156–158) and south (Satricum: De Waele 1997 and Colonna 2005b). The account 1 I am grateful to Margarita Gleba and Hilary Becker for taking the initiative of honoring Jean MacIntosh Turfa with a volume of papers by some of her many col-leagues and friends.

As a result, the long list of such votive temples erected during the Roman Republic emphasizes the Roman belief in bargaining with deities and the importance of meeting one’s obligations both in the world of politics and in matters of religion.5For Rome’s immediate neighbors to the north, the Etruscans, evi-dence of temples from different time periods and of varying size and decoration is plentiful. Due to the absence of local Etruscan historical accounts, however, written records of why these temples were built and who was responsible for their planning and execution, including the cost and manpower, are unfortunately lacking. Even to identify the Etruscan equivalents of such key Latin words as templum (temple), votum (vow), locatio (placement), and dedicatio (dedication)6 we have to reach beyond the recognized lexicographical interpretations based on dedicatory and other types of inscriptions.7While the Roman sources allow us to follow the creation of a temple from the initial vow to the selection of a site, the actual construction, and the fi nal dedication, the lack of comparable Etruscan textual documentation makes it necessary to view the creation of Etruscan temples with different criteria. In the following, we will examine some of the important Etruscan temples for which a cultual context can be suggested primarily on the basis of archaeological and general historical evidence.As gifts to a deity, both temple buildings and offerings of bronze or terracotta objects were linked to a specifi c place.8 The location of such sacred places, with or without a temple building, is critical for our understanding of the cult practiced there. While votive deposits often appear at given locations tied to the natural setting such as springs, groves, or mountains, temple buildings necessitated a more conscious decision about their placement in relation to a settlement, road, or other 5 See Aberson 1994 and Ziolkowski 1992.6 For the Latin vocabulary, see Orlin 1997.7 Following the sage advice of Jean Turfa, I will not quote some of the attempted translations and glossaries provided on a number of web pages.

Although some temples may have been erected ex novo inside or outside the settlements proper, most major sites provide evidence of continuity through the presence of previous structures, ranging from altars to huts and small enclosures. Whether at powerful centers such as Veii, Cerveteri, and Tarquinia or at smaller settlements such as Fiesole, sacred areas originated on a modest scale already in the Bronze or Iron Age and expanded gradually through the centuries of Etruscan history.9In addition to the emphasis on the location of temples, a feature common to both Rome and the Etruscan cities, Roman temples are usually associated with an individual in whose name the building was vowed. In the case of Etruscan temples, we can only seldom attach a name to a building, as with Thefarie Velianas, the ruler of Caere and temple B at Pyrgi (Colonna 2006, 145). More often, the erection of a new temple, or a rebuilding of an already existing structure, is con-nected with general historical circumstances. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the size of a temple (as at Vulci: Colonna 2006, 155–156, fi g. VIII.36) or the quality of the architectural decoration (as on the Portonaccio temple at Veii: Colonna 2006, 156–158, fi gs. VIII.37–40) coincide with a peak period in the city’s political history. In other circumstances, specifi c historical events may have caused the building of a temple. Thus Colonna suggests that temple A at Pyrgi refl ects Caere’s effort to regain its control at sea after the Etruscan defeat at Cumae in 474 BCE (Colonna 1985, 129). The Archaic temple of Ara della Regina at Tarquinia has been interpreted as an Etruscan ‘federal sanctuary’, but its 4th century BCE replacement may refl ect Tarquinia’s important political status after the fall of Veii (Bagnasco Gianni 2002, 371; Leighton 2004, 173; Colonna 2006, 160). As the result of the battle against the Gauls in 225 BCE, the temple at Talamone was remodeled and adorned with pedimental sculptures commemorating the Roman victory (Colonna 2006, 163). Although not a ‘temple’ in an architectural sense, the sanctuary at Montetosto between Caere and Pyrgi, may have been built in commemoration of the killing of Phocaean prisoners of war after the battle of Alalia in 540 BCE (Colonna 2006, 145).9 For overviews of Etruscan sanctuary sites, see Colonna 1985 and 2006. The results of continued excavations and re-evaluation of old material at sites such as Cerveteri and Veii are yielding important new information, for which see, for example, Paoletti and Camporeale 2005 (reviewed by Turfa 2006a)."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"104 ingrid edlund-berryOnce a vow had been made, and the desired outcome achieved, the appropriate Roman magistrates went to work in procuring a site to begin the construction of a temple (Ziolkowski 1992, 203–219). For the Etruscan temples, we lack information on who was actually involved in making the necessary arrangements. Likewise, the decisions about the plan of the temple and its decoration can only be deduced from the preserved remains. On the basis of the size of some of the temples (Capitoline temple in Rome, Ara della Regina at Tarquinia, main temple at Vulci), we can appreciate the building effort and the amount of manpower and funding involved in the process.10Although it can be argued that the themes of the decoration of Etruscan temples rarely coincide with the cult of the deity or deities worshipped there, the choice may suggest the purpose of erecting the temple. For example, the depiction of Herakles and Athena/Minerva in Rome and Veii has been interpreted as a symbol of regal power (Colonna 2005c, 1183–1185; Winter 2005). Likewise, the plaque from temple A at Pyrgi, depicting the battle at Thebes, may suggest the confl ict between competing individuals and the futility in such efforts for the welfare of the community (Colonna 1985, 138). Another exam-ple is the pediment from the temple at Sentinum (Civita Alba), built to commemorate the Roman victory over the Gauls in 295 BCE (Bradley 2000, 279).Once a temple had been erected, its maintenance determined its subsequent history. Many temples, such as the Ara della Regina at Tarquinia, seem to have been kept in good repair throughout the his-tory of the city (Torelli 1975, 186; Leighton 2004, 169), while others fell into neglect. Much like deposits of votive offerings, however, the decoration of temples was protected and, as needed, ritually buried as in the case of the ridgepole statues from the Portonaccio temple at Veii (Glinister 2000).In conclusion, in searching for Etruscan parallels for the steps involved in creating a Roman temple, from the ‘vow’ to the ‘dedication’, we fi nd that the concept of the ‘vow’ cannot be documented as part of the planning and execution of Etruscan temples. The reason for this may simply rest in the fact that the pertinent epigraphic or textual evidence 10 As shown by the so-called workshop at the site of Poggio Civitate, the local production of roof tiles and architectural terracottas illustrates the high-level industry involved with any major building activity in Etruria and elsewhere: Nielsen 1987; Phillips 1993."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" the historical and religious context of vows 105is missing, or that we have not yet been able to interpret the preserved Etruscan texts correctly. But, on the basis of the historical record (granted that it refl ects primarily a Roman perspective), we may also suggest that the concept of the ‘vow’ or contractual bargaining with the gods is something that applied much more to the individual efforts of ambitious politicians in the Roman Republic11 than it ever did to the Etruscan cities, including Rome during the reign of the Etruscan Tarquins. Although the Etruscans were constantly seeking to read the will of the deities through divination of different kinds, their ensuing actions usually resulted in votive offerings, with or without dedicatory inscriptions, rather than promises of even grander gifts to come.12 Evidence from the Etruscan temples suggests that these buildings were part of the sacred places within the Etruscan landscape, and, as such, subject to the continuous use and protection granted both votive deposits and monuments. Unlike the Roman temples that were instituted as the result of politically prompted ‘vows’ to the deities by individual gener-als and statesmen, the Etruscan counterparts seem to be incorporated into the sanctuaries as a whole, and, while occasionally expressing a ‘political’ statement, they were more attuned to the religious context of the sacred place than to glory of a specifi c individual donor.BibliographyAA.VV. 2001. “Primi risultati dalle indagini archeologiche in Campidoglio nell’area del Giardino Romano e del Palazzo Caffarelli.

Gregory WardenRitual is a physical manifestation of belief, but a ritual is also an action, or “a special type of action which is somehow connected to the belief system” (Bourque 2000, 20). Physical action is tantalizingly diffi cult to reconstruct through archaeological excavation. What remains is mate-rial culture, the sacred detritus that results from ritual or a series of rituals. This buried testimony is often elusive because objects are not actions, merely the result of them, but ironically ritual objects will only be understood through yet another set of actions: the rituals of the excavation, the laboratory, and the museum.The offerings that provide evidence for religion at sanctuaries like Poggio Colla are usually explained as evidence for votive religion, a rubric that is both broad and potentially misleading, for not all objects found in sanctuaries are necessarily votive in nature, and the range of votive religion is vast.1 There are countless ways for offerings to end up underground, and not just through ritual. Can we assume that dedications, after being displayed in the sanctuary, would eventually have been buried through a kind of secondary ritual? Would dedica-tions always remain sacred? Certainly not in the case of a conquered sanctuary,2 but even in other cases would offerings belong exclusively to the gods, or are there instances when dedications might be reused outside of the sacred space, thus recycled? And if so, then how would we know this archaeologically? Hoekstra has suggested that in the early Iron Age the social rhetoric of burial and bronze deposition cre-ated an economic mechanism that separated material wealth (metal) from its social (living) context, and that with time burial became the 1 For which see Turfa 2006 with current bibliography.2 As pointed out by Glinister 2000, 61: “. . . broad belief in the sacredness of such places did not assure their inviolability in wartime. . . . when a place was captured by an enemy it was no longer regarded as sacred”."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"108 p. gregory wardenprimary “arena for competitive consumption” (Hoekstra 1996, 61). This may be the case, but sanctuaries also continued to be areas for competitive consumption. In the Orientalizing and Archaic periods the ritual deposition of bronze continued in Etruria, especially in the north, but under different spatial and social structures in the context of organized sanctuaries. The economic result of massive giving to the gods is that large amounts of wealth are still taken out of circulation, but only if the contexts remain sealed, only if the dedications are not reused, recycled, or returned to a secular context. New evidence from the Etruscan sanctuary at Poggio Colla raises questions about whether such sacred contexts would always have remained closed.Votive religion in structured, public contexts is a characteristic vehicle of religious observance from the 7th century BCE onward in Etruria, but we know very little about how the masses of offerings were handled. At issue here is the reconstruction and interpretation of aggregate ritual rather than single acts. If ritual is action that connects to a belief system, then a single act cannot be ritual unless it is understood as such and reproducible by others.3 Thus single acts become collective ritual, and individual meaning becomes collective belief. A votive, say a bronze fi gure, would have had a specifi c meaning connected to the individual who bought it and dedicated it, presumably along with a prayer or vow, but the single object tells us more about the giver than the divinity. But while the gift is singular, the ritual is a repeated social construct, so that when that single bronze fi gure is found in a deposit with hundreds of other objects, as we will see is the case at Poggio Colla, secondary rituals have taken place that reveal more about the belief system than about the motives of any individual. The challenge is to move beyond the singular to the collective, for as Annamaria Comella has pointed out: “Sostanzialmente, i messaggi contenuti nelle offerte . . . mirano, in modo particolare, a dare informazioni sull’offerente o sul benefi cio richiesto e, in misura minore, a fornire indicazioni sulla divinità ciu il fedele si rivolge” (Comella 2005, 51). While the nature of a single offering can be understood, at least in the most generic and banal way, aggregate ritual evidence can also have widely diverse meanings: foundation, 3 In this sense I would argue that an action is only a ritual, for the purpose of elu-cidating belief systems, if it is perceived as such by others and if it follows established social norms."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" remains of the ritual at the sanctuary of poggio colla 109celebration, propitiation, expiation, or even obliteration (Bonghi Jovino 2005, 43). And there will certainly be other possibilities.The question is compounded by the fact that customs may have changed over time. Votive giving at Greek sanctuaries, for instance, certainly changes from the Archaic period, where it tends to be more personalized, to the Hellenistic period, where it becomes more public, or at least more concerned with the politics of display.4 It is not at all clear whether this was the case in Etruria where the enacting of ritual would have been controlled by a theocratic elite that would certainly have been interested in ritual’s communicative and performative aspects (Bourque 2000), but gifts will always have nuanced meanings. One of the most interesting aspects of Etruscan votive inscriptions is that two different verbs can be used for the action of giving. If recent interpre-tations are correct, one word (mul[u]vanice) could intimate exchange between persons of equal rank, thus connected to social structure and ‘gift exchange’, while the other (tur[u]ce) can be connected to giving in a strictly votive context.5 All these questions, the intricacies of giving in a ritual context, are pertinent to a remarkable series of ritual contexts discovered at the northern Etruscan sanctuary of Poggio Colla.The Mugello Valley Archaeological Project, a joint venture of Southern Methodist University, Franklin & Marshall College, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, has excavated since 1995 the Etruscan settlement of Poggio Colla, in the Mugello basin, some 20 miles NE of Florence. The site was a rural sanctuary and settlement of long duration that spanned most of Etruscan his-tory (7th–2nd centuries BCE). The acropolis, a fortifi ed rectangle of one and a half acres, is spectacularly sited in a dominant position at the juncture of the Mugello basin and the Sieve river valley. From this advantageous position the Etruscans overlooked one of the main arteries that leads from the foothills of the Apennines to the Arno basin, the Casentino, and major Etruscan sites like Arezzo. Poggio Colla is at the edge of Tuscany; to the north are the mountain passes, usually snow-covered in winter, that open onto the Etruria Padana. Poggio Colla must have been a liminal site, at the edge of Etruscan dominion, but it also was situated with clear site lines of other Etruscan sanctuaries: 4 For instance at the Demeter Sanctuary at Cyrene. Warden 1992, with reference to Warden et al. 1990.

These rural sanctuar-ies thus serve to both defi ne zones of infl uence and establish places of cultural interaction.Excavation at Poggio Colla has focused on three areas: the Podere Funghi, an artisan area 750 m NE of the acropolis; the north-west slope where an Orientalizing quarry was discovered; and on the acropolis proper. The latter was certainly a sanctuary, one that in recent years has produced a wealth of information about votive and ritual activity. The early history of this acropolis sanctuary is still elusive. The earliest pottery, found in two heavily carbonized strata on the northern edge of the terrace, is bucchero and buccheroid impasto that can be securely dated at least as early as the middle of the 7th century BCE. The buc-chero is found in large quantities and is of the highest quality, much of it decorated, certainly comparable to bucchero found at sites like Fiesole and Artimino. The assemblage includes elite vases like cups with fenestrated winged handles, and although conclusions will have to await proper study, preliminary evidence suggests that the preponderance of vases were drinking vessels. So far there is no certain evidence of architecture as early as this Orientalizing and early Archaic context.Subsequent to the Orientalizing-Archaic horizon there is evidence of at least three building phases. The earliest architecture6 (Phase I) consists of a stone temple that is no longer standing but whose elements, three Tuscan column bases and numerous molded podium blocks, were dispersed on the acropolis. The location of this structure is still in question, but the line of massive sandstone blocks underneath the NE corner of the later Phase II–III buildings, might constitute one fl ank, in which case the temple would have had a N/S orientation. Many of the elements of the temple were reused in later contexts that intimate destruction or post-destruction rituals; the sacred nature of the columns and podium blocks seemingly continued even after their architectonic function came to an end.After the destruction of the early temple the acropolis was reordered on a massive scale, resulting in a large courtyard (22 by 10.5 m) sur-rounding an altar (c. 1.5 by 1.5 m).7 There was also at this point a signifi cant change in orientation. While the Phase I structure had been 6 For a recent plan: Warden et al. 2005, 252, fi g. 1.7 The phase II plan is published by Warden et al. 2005, 254, fi g. 2."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" remains of the ritual at the sanctuary of poggio colla 111oriented roughly north-south, the Phase II courtyard is aligned to the natural rectangular terrace of the arx.8 A third phase of construction followed along similar lines. The Phase III building was also a large rectangular courtyard, but with foundations of stone rubble rather than ashlars. The courtyard is similar to its Phase II predecessor but deviates slightly: to the south and east the rectangle was expanded approximately one meter, and now there is clear evidence of rooms on at least three sides, to the west and south, and perhaps to the east as well. Numismatic evidence dates the Phase III structure to the 3rd century,9 and based on ceramic, historical, and numismatic evidence, we have posited that it was most likely destroyed by the Romans c. 188/187 BCE.There is clear evidence (altar and votive deposits) that the site’s religious nature continued through the second phase, but a crucial question is whether Poggio Colla continued to function as a sanctuary through the third phase. It also might be salutary to ask the question about how Etruscan the site of Poggio Colla would have been in the 3rd century BCE when this part of Etruria had been overrun by Gauls and when sites to the north, such as Monte Bibele, show clear evidence of Gallic incursion. Even if still a sanctuary, the Phase III courtyard complex and newly fortifi ed arx housed granaries and possibly hosted textile and ceramic production (Warden et al. 2005, 255).Part of the rich evidence for votive religion at Poggio Colla has already been discussed in excavation reports and the extensive contexts will have to await a full monographic publication.10 There are nine con-texts that could be included under the rubric of either votive or ritual activity at the site (Table 1), and the most important and unequivocal of these is number 4. It was excavated recently, in 2005 and 2006, and thus has not been included in previous publications, but it was this deposit that made clear the religious nature of the acropolis. Context 4 consists of a circular pit excavated in a room at the north-west corner of the Phase II and III buildings, in an area where recent excavation 8 What is unclear at this point is exactly what motivated the changes described above.

In the center of the pit was placed a large sandstone cylinder, c. 70 m in diameter, with a boss or tenon on one of its faces (Fig. 12). This stone element is most likely the top of a votive column or small circular altar, and the tenon on the underside of the cylinder would have held the element in place, perhaps on a wooden column shaft. Thus, the column or altar was dismantled, and the element was carefully placed in the center of the pit and upside-down.11To the north of the sandstone cylinder, carefully placed at right angles to one another and roughly oriented to the axes of the plateau, were two sandstone statue bases.12 The smaller is pentagonal, just under 13 cm high, and has a hole at the top for the insertion of a bronze fi gurine; it was oriented north-south.13 The larger base, an imposing 33.5 cm high, is pyramidal and is also holed at the top;14 the hole still has the lead fi tting that would have held in place a bronze fi gure of signifi cant size. One face bears an orthograde inscription that gives the name of an Etruscan male, a member of the elite, given that both the nomen and cognomen are indicated. The inscription is probably Archaic.15 Two bronze fragments were placed on the southern side of the cylinder. Also found was the handle of a vessel, seemingly purposely broken, as along with several strands of intertwined gold wire, which also appears in several other ritual contexts elsewhere at the site.Especially dramatic is further evidence excavated in 2006. To the west of the cylinder was a small bronze bowl, not yet fully restored, that was possibly used to pour a libation at the time that all these elements were interred. The careful placement of all these objects allows us to reconstruct the following sequence of events. The column or altar was dismantled and its heavy cylindrical top carefully placed upside-down in the pit. The statue bases, which might originally have been displayed on the column/altar, were tucked neatly to the north, while the gold wire and bronze were placed to the south.

While we can reconstruct the ritual, we do not know why this ceremony took place. Was it part of the normal ritual at Poggio Colla, the internment of sacred objects of an earlier age, or did it result from a violent destruction and looting? As well as the careful axial arrangement of the objects, aligned with the edges of the acropolis terrace, the seemingly fastidious handling of an elite dedication is reminiscent of Etruscan ritual practice, where in some cases the care and handling of the sacred was entrusted to, and the prerogative of, specifi c Etruscan elites. The most famous instance, recounted by Livy (V, 22, 3–8), is the statue of Juno at Veii, which was handled by the Romans “with religious awe because according to Etruscan custom, no one was allowed to touch it except a priest from a certain family”.Many of the ritual acts attested in Context 4 are also attested in Contexts 1 and 3. Context 3, probably a foundation deposit of the Phase II structure, was a pit directly east of the west wall of the Phase II courtyard. The pit was covered over with stone and tile and contained a bronze pitcher, a so-called Schnabelkanne,16 and heavy bronze ring. The pitcher was carefully placed on its side, again almost certainly after a libation, and is again oriented north-south, parallel to the west wall of the courtyard. Schnabelkannen are usually found in tombs, but their ritual signifi cance is made clear on the famous Chalchas mirror from Vulci, now in the Vatican, where a pitcher of this type is placed at the feet of the seer as he scrutinizes the entrails at the altar.17 The signifi cance of the ring is rather more ambiguous.The whole western end of the Phase II courtyard is connected to ritual and votive religion. In center of the long, east-west axis of the courtyard and exactly one third of the distance from the west wall was a stone altar. Between the west wall of the courtyard and this altar is a large fi ssure that leads to an underground chamber or favissa18 that runs underneath the west walls of the courtyard.

After the Phase I temple was destroyed or dismantled, this fi ssure was capped by a large molded block of sandstone, part of the Phase I structure (Fig. 13). The block was again neatly placed upside down, next to the fi ssure, and next to it were deposited a fi ne gold ring and long strands of gold wire. Once again, the combination of an upside-down architectural element, a ring, and gold wire document another ritual setting. This context, connected with a natural feature (the bedrock) would certainly suggest a chthonic cult, perhaps related to a female divinity. This kind of veneration of a natural fi ssure in the bedrock is not uncommon in Etruria and is paralleled most famously at Tarquinia.19The connection to the bedrock, or more properly the ritual ‘value’ of the bedrock at Poggio Colla, is demonstrated by a votive stips (Context 2) deposited to the west and south of the Phase II altar, in trench PC 23, grids F8–F9 (excavated) and grids E8–9 (unexcavated). This deposition covers a large area, part of which is still unexcavated, possibly over ten meters in length. The western edge of the votive deposit was discovered in 2001 as the result of illicit excavation at the site, and subsequent excavation has produced 439 pieces of bronze, fragments of iron, very worn and abraded fragments of tile and coarse-ware ceramics, a loom weight, a black glaze handle, and three fragments of an Attic St. Valentin’s skyphos (Warden et al. 2005, 262, fi g. 14).The hundreds of bronzes include raw bronze in the form of casting ‘runners’ and numerous lumps, possibly aes rude. There are also numer-ous fragments of what clearly had been objects: sheets of bronze, some with nails, implements and decorative pieces that formed part of larger pieces. Many of these are deformed and bear traces of burning on their surfaces; some of the pieces seem to have been deliberately cut up. In only one case, an Archaic votive fi gurine (Fig. 14),20 do we have an entire object, and in this case the fi gure is heavily worn and abraded, possibly burned. Some of these pieces are fragments of clearly valu-able, elite objects, for instance a splendid archaic lion, an attachment for a bronze tripod or large vessel (Fig. 15).21 The assemblage is clearly 19 See Bonghi Jovino and Chiaramonte Treré 1997, esp. 217–220.

But this deposit is not a typical north Etruscan set of fi gures, of, say, the Monte Gura-gazza type; it is, rather, a secondary deposit of objects that seem to have been deliberately cut up, fragmented, and possibly burned. One possibility is that they are the remnants of a violent destruction, the leftovers after the sanctuary was looted, neatly tucked away underneath the courtyard of the Phase III complex. The fi nds, however, range in date from the Archaic to the Hellenistic period. They do include objects that are probably contemporary with the Phase I temple, for instance the male head, standing fi gurine, and lion. But the assemblage also includes objects, for instance coins, datable to the end of the 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE, to the very end of the sanctuary’s long his-tory. And most important, the deposit includes raw bronze, numerous casting ‘runners’ (Fig. 16) as well as indiscriminate lumps that would seem to fall into that rather indefi nable category of aes rude. If this deposit were the result of a destruction, we would expect to fi nd larger parts of objects and fewer pieces of currency and raw bronze. If this impression is borne out in the fi nal analysis, after complete excavation, then Context 2 will provide evidence for the practice of ‘fragmentation’, a practice whose existence is controversial, as has been pointed out by Glinister (2000, 158, n. 12).There does not seem to be any depositional stratigraphy within Context 2, but the lowest part of the deposit is placed upon bedrock—here once again we have tantalizing evidence that the bedrock was sacred—into a channel that may have been cut into the bedrock before the objects were deposited. The channel, whether natural or artifi cial, is startlingly symmetrical and creates an axis aligned north-south, in other words aligned to true north rather than to the sides of the ter-race. The alignment is thus consistent with the Phase I orientation, but the stips is clearly datable to after Phase I. Either the channel is earlier 22 Inv. PC 01–002. 23 Inv. PC 95–01, published in Kane, Warden and Griffi ths 1998. This fi gure was found in the scarp of Trench PC1. The trench was reopened and expanded in 2006 revealing the southwestern edge of the stips."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"116 p. gregory wardenthan the stips, or else there was another reason to preserve an earlier axiality. One possibility is that if the line of the channel is extended to the north it leads to the fi ssure and Context 1. These two deposits, both associated with the bedrock and hence with a chthonic cult, might thus be related.It is premature to speculate too much about this deposit—it will need full excavation and exhaustive publication. The prevalence of bronze is north Etruscan, and the inclusion of much raw bronze, runners and possibly aes rude, is paralleled at the nearby sanctuary of Monte Fal-terona,24 where fi gurines and weapons were intermingled with masses of raw bronze and coins. The quality of the head found at Poggio Colla in 1995 is comparable to anything found there or at other northern sanctuaries. The treatment of the pieces, their fragmentation and burn-ing, is especially interesting in light of the nearby altar and the hearth or fi re pit immediately to the north. The possibility exists that whole objects/dedications were ritually broken and burned, with only parts of these objects interred. Are the other parts buried elsewhere on the site, or was part of the metal reused?The exact date of Context 2 remains uncertain and does not help in the interpretation of the deposit’s meaning. It certainly postdates Phase I. Its position suggests an association with the Phase II altar, but it is diffi cult to be more precise than that, especially since both Phases II and III seem to be fairly late (3rd–2nd centuries BCE). The latest material in the stips is probably too late for the deposit to mark the end of Phase I, as does the ‘fi ssure’ deposit (Context 1), or to signal the foundation of Phase II, as does the Schnabelkanne deposit (Context 3). The best guess at this point is that the deposit is possibly connected to the end of Phase II and beginning of Phase III, perhaps marking an end, a kind of ritual sealing of the Phase II sanctuary. Of special signifi cance in this regard is the placement of the coins which are found at the top of the votive stips, somewhat removed from the other bronzes. Again, conclusions will have to await full excavation, but at this point it looks as if the coins were scattered around the earth at the top of the votive stips. Their position seems indicative of a specifi c ritual action, but one that is better known from northern Europe than from classical contexts. The high number of coins from Poggio Colla must certainly indicate not accidental loss but selective deposition, and 24 Fortuna and Giovannoni 1989, with previous bibliography."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" remains of the ritual at the sanctuary of poggio colla 117while the nature of coin deposition in Italic sanctuaries has not been well studied, the topic has received a great deal of attention lately in northern Europe in the context of Iron Age settlements and sanc-tuaries. While practice seems to vary from region to region, there is evidence for instance for “the deposition of single (of small hoards of ) gold coins in special places in the landscape” (Wellington 2004, 242). Interestingly, structured deposition of coins is found in settlements as well as sacred places (Wellington 2004, 243), and coin deposition can be associated with architectural features such as foundation trenches, enclosure ditches, etc. (Curteis 2004, 218). In sanctuaries, coin deposi-tion becomes a ritual act, possibly a way of sealing and consecrating sacred spaces (Haselgrove 2005; Haselgrove and Wigg-Wolf 2005). The methodological issues raised by coin deposition analysis in Iron Age Europe apply to Poggio Colla. The way that coins may have been placed or scattered around the top of Context 2 as well as elsewhere on the site raises questions about ritual, about ethnic identity, and about the nature of other deposits at Poggio Colla and other northern Etruscan sites in the late Etruscan period, a time of social turmoil and ethnic mixing. We might also begin to suspect that the deposits of gold jewelry (Context 6) and silver coins (Context 8) that will be studied elsewhere25 are not hoards but dedicatory in nature.The discovery of this series of votive deposits has led us to reevaluate some previously excavated contexts and to examine such ambiguous events as the dismantlement/destruction of the Phase I temple. We may never know why the Phase I temple was destroyed, whether its destruc-tion was accidental or deliberate, but what we can now demonstrate is that a series of ritual actions ensued after this event. Nothing of Phase I save the foundation walls seems to have been left in situ. Podium blocks and architectural elements were reused in later foundations, almost always deliberately turned upside down. An illuminating example of this kind of reuse is a series of podium blocks placed at the bottom of the north terracing wall in Trench PC 20 (Fig. 17). These blocks are placed directly in front of a series of small upright stone slabs that seem to have marked a boundary, possibly the northern bound-ary of the sanctuary in an early phase. The sanctity of the delineated boundary is reinforced by the ritual act of the placement of elements 25 The gold jewelry will be published by Alexis Q. Castor, the hoard of Roman victoriati will be published by Michael Thomas."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"118 p. gregory wardenof the destroyed temple. The entire sanctuary seems to be a dialogue of ritual acts that reinforce the rational order of the sacred space,26 as in the placement of statue bases and other elements in Context 4, or, in other instances, ritual actions that impose human order on irrational spaces, such as the placement of a podium block upside down in front of the fi ssure (Context 1), or the carving of channels in the bedrock for Context 2. The depositional pattern is interesting. Most of the ritual deposits are at the western end of the courtyard, but more precisely they are to the west of a hypothetical north-south axis, true north-south rather than plan north-south, that intersects the Phase II altar, suggest-ing that the sacred area may have been divided into zones, based on a cardinal axis that defi nes the Phase I planning (and that is reiterated by the channel of Context 2) but that might also have continued into subsequent phases despite the reorientation of the architectural layout along different lines.Two other contexts are worthy of note, although they will be pub-lished fully elsewhere. One is a mound of stones (Context 9) at the east end of the Phase III courtyard; some of these stones are clearly architectural elements. When fi rst discovered this mound was thought to be the result of earlier excavation at the site, but careful excavation (one half of the mound was excavated) revealed that it belongs strati-graphically to the very end of the site, perhaps part of post-destruction ritual.27 More ambiguous is the series of fi ve podium blocks and Tuscan column base excavated in 1998–2000 in Trench PC 6, northeast of the Phase III courtyard structure (Warden, Thomas and Galloway 1999, 237, fi g. 5). These, along with a Phase III rubble wall to the west seem to have made up the foundations for a small room or platform whose function and placement—far to the east of the other structures—has perplexed us. In the center of the platforms was a large circular pit fi lled with ash, and now, in the context of the other ritual reuse of Phase I temple elements at the site, it seems plausible to hypothesize that this area served as an altar.There are other questions of dismantlement and deposition, of burial and reuse. Where for instance are the terracottas? One late Archaic antefi x was found in 1992 (Warden, Thomas and Galloway 1999, 240, 26 I would argue that these acts could also be a kind of social dialogue that would reinforce the hierarchies of the Etruscan social landscape in the way, as has been sug-gested by Izzet 2000, that the fi ctile decorative elements of a temple work to create spatial hierarchies that defi ne both the spatial and the religious order. 27 For mounds in this context: Edlund Berry 1994, 16."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" remains of the ritual at the sanctuary of poggio colla 119no. 36), previous to our excavations, in three pieces in the foundation of the north terracing wall. Was it tossed in there by mistake, or was it purposely placed there, as was a massive Tuscan column base that was fl ipped upside down nearby, in the same foundation. And where are the other antefi xes? Are they buried nearby? All this is somewhat reminiscent of destruction rituals documented in the late 6th century BCE at Murlo (Edlund-Berry 1994), but with a difference, for Poggio Colla is clearly a sanctuary that continued to function well after the destruction of the Phase I temple, so that many of the contexts are more concerned with reuse and renewal rather than to obliteration. A more proximate example is the burial of terracotta statues at the Portonaccio temple in Veii, clearly a ritual act as has been suggested by Bonghi Jovino,28 but one that does not necessarily mark the termination of the place, merely the removal and burial (and possible propitiation?) of items sacred to the place. In this sense the ritual burial of parts of the Phase I temple marks a transition rather than an end, although interestingly the stones of the temple are treated as sacred, much like the fi ctile revetments more commonly found in ritual deposits. We cannot be certain how much more of the temple lies interred in the extensive footings of the Phase II and III courtyard buildings at Poggio Colla. As it is, the acropolis sanctuary of Poggio Colla is beginning to reveal itself through a series of archaeological contexts that document dramatically the richness and complexity of Etruscan ritual practice.28 Bonghi Jovino 2005, 43, connected by her to the ‘re-structuring’ of the Portonac-cio sanctuary, thus analogous to the changes that take place at Poggio Colla at the end of Phase I.

As we can deduce mainly from the necropo-leis, tombs (mostly rock tombs) and burial gifts, San Giuliano had its most fl ourishing period between the later 7th century and the early 5th century BCE and a second, much later, prosperity in the Early Hellenistic period. Unfortunately San Giuliano remains a less studied and published Etruscan site of the South Etruscan rock tomb area. It is located about 3 km from the small picturesque medieval town of Barbarano Romano and since 1984 has been surrounded by the ‘Parco archeologico-naturalistico Marturanum’.The so-called Cuccumella on the plateau of Caiolo and the Cima Tumulus on the northern edge of the Chiusa Cima plateau stand out among the tumuli of the necropoleis of San Giuliano. Chronologically both tumuli go back to the later Orientalizing period but structurally they are completely different. The tomb of the Cuccumella is built in tufa blocks (a technique generally much more common in Northern Etruria), whereas the base/tambur and the chamber tombs of the Cima Tumulus are completely cut out from the local tufa rock (as was especially common in the necropoleis of Caere).1 May the recipient of this Festschrift accept this modest little alpnu from an old ‘Etruscanized’ German friend living now in the rock tomb area and return still many times to the land of our spiritual ancestors. Evviva!2 This area, at least in the Orientalizing and Archaic period, belonged to the hin-terland of the powerful coastal metropolis of Caere and is now part of the province of Viterbo."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"124 stephan steingräberThe fi rst excavations of the Cima Tumulus were undertaken by Gino Rosi in 1921 (Rosi 1925). In 1931 Augusto Gargana published his mono-graph on San Giuliano, which remains until today the basic publication and includes the Cima Tumulus too. Between 1962 and 1975 further excavations and cleaning operations took place that resulted mainly in the uncovering of the smaller later tombs and of a cippus-monument. Towards the end of the 1970’s the main tomb—partly collapsed—was restored. During the last two decades Giovanni and Elena Colonna (1978; 1986), Friedhelm Prayon (1975; 2006), Renzo Romanelli (1986), Alessandro Naso (1996), Paolo Brocato3 and the author of this article (1991; 1996; 1997) dealt with this important sepulchral complex. After the restoration in 1982 the author, together with the late photographer of the DAI in Rome, Helmut Schwanke, organized a photo campaign. The Cima Tumulus of San Giuliano has not been completely and thoroughly published to this day.The Cima Tumulus is situated on the plateau of Chiusa Cima and contains an older monumental chamber tomb orientated towards NNW and six more recent smaller chamber tombs located in the eastern (fi ve tombs) and in the northwestern sector (one tomb) of the tumulus (Fig. 18). Both the base (krepis) of the tumulus as well as the chamber tombs are almost completely cut out from the local reddish tufa rock and contain only very few built structures. This is in remarkable contrast to the other monumental aristocratic tumuli of the Orientalizing period at San Giuliano such as the so-called Cuccumella on the plateau of Caiolo with its dromos and two tomb chambers built in tufa blocks and covered by corbeled vaults (Fig. 19), as was common in Northern Etruria (i.e. at Cortona, Castellina in Chianti and Artimino as well as at Orvieto). The Tumulo Cima is about 35 m in diameter and is characterized by a cylindrical krepis with moulds (strip and torus) preserved only in a few parts (Fig. 20). There are no remains of a possible original ramp or of other added structures. The main tomb, the Tomba Cima (Figs. 21, 22), belongs to the so-called tomb type B 2 that is native in Caere according to the typology of Prayon (1975). It contains seven chambers and an open trapeziform dromos (length 12.5 m) with four arched doors (Fig. 23), which has tufa blocks only in the upper part.3 In his unpublished doctoral thesis in Etruscology at the University of Roma La Sapienza."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" the cima tumulus at san giuliano 125Of special interest is the left dromos chamber (4.7 × 2.8 m) that was clearly destined for the cult of the dead (Fig. 24). Even in more recent times it was used occasionally for ‘cult ceremonies’ (libations and recitations in Etruscan language) by local modern ‘Etruscans’ and special guests from the New World too. This chamber is divided in three different sections by two pairs of fl uted wall pillars. The frontal area is covered by a fan vaulting with a central ‘disc’, the middle one by a saddle roof with columen and crossbeams and the rear one by an almost fl at simple ceiling. Remains of red color are especially well preserved on the beams and on the wall pillars. In the center on the fl oor there is a rectangular base (1.2 × 0.8 m), which was probably an altar that was originally built in stone blocks or consisted of some ephemeral material (Fig. 24). We can fi nd architectural and typologi-cal parallels for such a characteristic funeral cult chamber especially in Caere (Tomba Campana 1) and Vulci (Tomba del Sol e della Luna) (Prayon 1975).The antichamber/vestibulum of Tomba Cima measures 2.5 × 3.6 m and has an arched entrance door and three rectangular portae doricae inside. Its coffered ceiling (Fig. 25) is still well preserved and character-ized by lacunaria or an imitation of intersecting beams, crossbeams and reed (incannucciata). One can still recognize the remains of painting in red, black and yellow, especially on the beams and door borders, show-ing vegetal motifs such as palmettes of Phoenician type and volutes (Fig. 26), as was demonstrated by A. Naso (1996). Two small chambers with slightly vaulted ceilings connect the antechamber with the left and right dromos chambers respectively. This special feature is reminiscent of the Tomba delle Cinque Sedie at Caere where the small chambers however connect the dromos chambers directly with the main tomb chamber (Prayon 1975; 2006).The main tomb chamber of the Tomba Cima with a trapeziform ground plan (6.3 × 4.3–3 m) is characterized by four pillars, a coffered ceiling, and a fl at bench zone along the walls (Fig. 27). On the left side of this tomb chamber there is a very large funeral bed built in stone slabs with round leg forms (according to the typology of the author we are dealing with here the bed/kline type 1b: Steingräber 1979, 8–9). Because of the partial collapse of the ceiling, some parts of the pillars and the ceiling have been restored in modern concrete. Several remains of red color are still recognizable.

Naso (Fig. 28). Concerning these motifs we fi nd comparable examples in the Tomba delle Pantere at Tarquinia (chronologically a bit later), in a painted tomb discovered in 1984 in Loc. Cancellara near Magliano in Toscana, and on impasto vases painted white on red and on terracotta house-shaped urns from Caere (Steingräber 2006, 60–61).The two dromos chambers on the right side are largely restored and have a saddle roof with columen. The six smaller and later one-chamber tombs cut out from the tufa rock go back to the archaic period (i.e. 6th century BCE). They are characterized by a saddle roof with columen in relief, a funeral bed on both sides and a bench in front of the rear wall. Some round cavities cut out in the stone beds were probably used for later cremation burials.As in most cases, the tombs of the Cima Tumulus were largely plundered before they were discovered by archaeologists, but some fragmentary remains of burial gifts from the earlier (Orientalizing) and the later (Archaic) period were still found: fragments of bucchero cups (calice) and an impasto lion protome (probably belonging to a dinos). Other fragments of terracotta and metal were found more recently such as Protocorinthian, Italo-Geometric, Attic black fi gure and red fi gure ceramics, bucchero, impasto vases (partly painted white on red, among them a pithos with a frieze of walking winged griffi ns), fragments of a tufa lion sculpture, fi bulae as well as black glaze and Faliscan ceramics. These materials have not yet been published.On the basis of these burial gifts, as well as the architectural typology, the Tumulus and the Tomba Cima can be dated to some point between the third and the fourth quarter of the 7th century BCE. The six later and much simpler one-chamber tombs of the 6th century demonstrate that the tumulus was used for a longer duration. Because of the lack of inscriptions we do not know the name of the aristocratic family that owned the Cima Tumulus. Strong infl uences from Caere manifest themselves in this period not only architecturally and artistically (one could quote the aristocratic orientalizing Caeretan tombs such as the Tomba degli Animali Dipinti) but also politically and economically in the South Etruscan rock tomb area.The cippus-monument east of the tumulus on the other hand is of special interest and is unique in Etruria (Fig. 29). This monument was rightly called by Colonna (1986, 420) an “area cultuale all’aperto”, that is, an open cultic/ritual area (Steingräber 1991; 1996; 1997).

Already because of their size they clearly stand out among the great amount of Etruscan cippi, which still have to be collected in a corpus and studied more thoroughly. A very striking example of this type is the rather well preserved obelisk-shaped tufa cippus from San Giuliano that for a long time was erected in the entrance hall of the town hall at Barbarano Romano before it fi nally was moved after a restoration into the small local Archaeological Museum together with other stone monuments such as sarcophagi and animal sculptures (Fig. 30). Fortunately, we know it was originally found in the Loc. Chiusa Cima in 1963. This cippus, about 4 m high, is characterized by a square projecting base with moulding that is cut out from the same tufa block as the lower part of the ‘obelisk’. The base measures 1.15 × 1.00 m at the bottom, 0.66 × 0.55 m in middle part, 0.43 × 0.35 m in upper part and 0.40 m in height. The cippus is narrowing toward the pointed top. The upper blocks were fi t together in modern times.Most probably the cippus was erected on the facade of a cube rock tomb (tomba a dado fi nto), the so-called Tomba dell’Obelisco which, together with other cube rock tombs, surrounded a large artifi cially created square on two sides. This funeral square was systematically excavated and cleaned by the Soprintendenza in March 1990. The exterior and interior architecture of these tombs as well as the modest fi nds of bucchero fragments suggest a date in the later 6th century BCE (Steingräber 1992). Therefore the cippus should date from the same period. Perhaps some of the other late archaic cube rock tombs around this square were originally topped by such obelisk-shaped cippi too, as could be indicated by some tufa pedestals with square depressions that perhaps functioned as cippus-bases. Even more comparable with the base of the cippus in the Museum of Barbarano Romano is a series of fl at, square tufa bases with depressions in the courtyard of the Museo Civico at Viterbo, which possibly belonged to obelisk-shaped cippi. The connection with large obelisk-shaped cippi of three square depressions in the tufa ground of the Caiolo plateau at San Giuliano situated just over the canyon-like valley of Caiolo and between two chamber tombs with tumuli is more problematic (Steingräber 1991; 1996).More impressive are the remains of the monumental obelisk-shaped cippi east of the Cima Tumulus (Figs. 29, 31). On a rectangular base, which is oriented approximately east-west (length 9.20 m [south side], 8.95 m [north side]; width 3.30 m [east side], 3.55 m [west side]) one can"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"128 stephan steingräbereasily recognize two rows of nine (on the northern side) and respectively eight (on the southern side) badly weathered, square stumps on which we have to imagine, most probably, obelisk-shaped cippi built in blocks just as the cippus in the museum of Barbarano. The southern row is interrupted in the center by a circular depression. Immediately south of the monument is situated a small tufa quarry of a more recent period. There is no doubt that the base with the seventeen cippi was connected with the neighboring Cima Tumulus. Perhaps even it was cut out from the tufa rock together with the tumulus in the same period.Concerning the site and orientation, the cippus-base cannot be related directly to any of the tombs of the tumulus. Presuming an origin in the same period (i.e. the later Orientalizing period) as in the case of the main tomb, one could ask why the cippi were not erected north of the tumulus immediately in front of the Tomba Cima. The answer is simple: there is not enough space, as the plateau of Chiusa Cima falls off sharply close to the tumulus. Such problems did not exist on the other sides around the tumulus.Given such an early date for the cippus-monument, one could object the obviously later date of the typologically similar ‘obelisk’ in the museum of Barbarano Romano (the second half of the 6th century BCE). Additionally there is the general fact that the phenomenon of Etruscan funeral cippi reached its fi rst real climax only in the Archaic period. Undoubtedly this monument was used by the owners of the Cima Tumulus—an aristocratic gens whose name unfortunately we do not know—for the cult of the dead and the ancestors as a kind of “area cultuale all’aperto” (Colonna 1986, 420). Even though monumental obelisk-shaped cippi are also documented or presumed in other sites of the necropoleis at San Giuliano, the great number and accumulation of cippi in the case of our monument represent a really unique case for which we do not know any other comparable example. Apparently the base with the cippi was not only a memorial monument but had a practical function for the cult of the dead as well: this is suggested by the circular depression between the cippi of the southern row on which we can suppose perhaps a round altar. The fact that ritual acts such as sacrifi ces and libations occured in the immediate neighbor-hood of the erected cippi is proven by the roof platforms with moulds of the cube rock tombs at Norchia and Castel d’Asso (dated mostly from the late 4th and the 3rd centuries BCE), which can be classifi ed both formally and functionally as a kind of altar.

In these cases we are probably dealing not with altars but with funeral monuments characterized by monumental cippi. Admittedly in reality no Etruscan monuments of this kind are documented. Typologically rather close are cube rock tombs with moulded roof platforms topped by cippi. Furthermore one should mention the legendary colossal tomb monument of Por-senna at Clusium described by Varro in Pliny (NH 36 19.91–93) that has not yet been located defi nitively. This tomb was topped by fi ve pyramid-shaped elements, whereas the so-called Tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii of the Late Republican period at Albano Romano was characterized by fi ve frustum-shaped tops of circular cross-section. This type of funeral monument should be primarily of Etruscan origin (Steingräber 1996).As is well known, the obelisk form—particularly popular among monumental cippi in the San Giuliano area—has its origins in ancient Egypt. There we fi nd obelisks, some grouped in pairs at the entrance of tombs or on the top of hills, but the majority were used as cult objects in front of temples and particularly as sun symbols in the area of temples dedicated to the sun. Beginning in the period of the emperor Augustus, many Egyptian obelisks were carried off to Rome where they could be reused for sepulchral purposes as well. Thus pairs of obelisks were erected in front of the Mausoleum of Augustus and the cenotaph of Antinous (Steingräber 1996, 96). Roncalli dated a sandstone obelisk (height 2.52 m, on a modern base) with relief decoration in the court-yard of San Francesco at Città della Pieve in Umbria to the 5th century BCE (Roncalli 1988). Most probably this obelisk—typologically rather close to the San Giuliano cippi—has to be interpreted not as a funeral sema but as a religious monument for the sun cult. Formally very similar are the small obelisks or piramidetti with moulded bases and inscriptions from San Mauro Forte near Metaponto (now in the Archaeological Museum of Naples), which originally however belonged to a sanctuary and not to a necropolis. Thus it seems that the ‘obelisk’ in pre-Roman Italy could have a symbolic signifi cance both in the sacred and in the sepulchral sphere. The use of obelisks by the Romans thus should be"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"130 stephan steingräberrooted partly in Etrusco-Italic traditions and partly in Egyptian tradi-tions (Steingräber 1996; 1997).Additionally, Etruscan cippi that had a circular cross-section could reach sometimes monumental size as is proved by an example from Vulci4 and by another one from a tomb dromos at Castro. Some examples—now lost—from Chiusi (height c. 6.5 m, diameter 2.64 m) and Volterra (height c. 4 m) were still more monumental, built in stone blocks as a kind of ‘tholoi’ and were hollow inside. One of the examples from Volterra was erected over a tomb with alabaster urns dating from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE and therefore can be considered as a cippus. The example from Chiusi seems to be older in chronology. Formally and probably also functionally comparable is the so-called Colonna Pizzuta of Eloro in Southeast Sicily—a still more colossal towerlike ‘cippus’ narrowing toward the top (height c. 10 m), which was erected over a hypogeum in a sepulchral area of the 3rd century BCE. The great tumulus of Cuccumella at Vulci must also have been topped by sepulchral ‘towers’, whose function, date and signifi cance are controversially disputed (Steingräber 1991). Column- and tower-like sepulchral monuments—partly cut out—are documented also in the Eastern Mediterranean such as in Sardis (Lydia), Marathus (Syria) and Lindos (Rhodos). Such elementary basic types as the sepulchral ‘column’ and ‘tower’ can have been created independently from each other of course. Thus we also have to presume a local indigenous tradition in Etruria, which goes back to the Orientalizing and Archaic periods.Generally the funeral cippus is interpreted by most scholars as a commemorative sign of the deceased for the bereaved family or as a symbolic ‘seat of the soul’ of the dead. These interpretations should be valid also for the great majority of Etruscan monumental cippi. Aniconic stone columns and pillars could be admittedly worshipped as baityloi (‘holy stones’) too, that is as seats of the souls or gods. This custom has roots in the megalithic cultures, especially in the Near East. In the sepulchral sphere they have to be considered as seat of the underworld gods or ancestors. In Greek sanctuaries sometimes the gods could be worshipped in the form of argoi lithoi and tetragonoi lithoi as it is shown by the many unhewn ‘cippi’ of the 7th century BCE in the Apollo sanctuary of Metaponto (Steingräber 1991).4 This cippus is now in the courtyard of the Castello/Archaeological Museum at Vulci; it is about 4 m high, built in several tufa drums and narrows towards the top."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" the cima tumulus at san giuliano 131As we already explained the cippus-monument beside the Cima Tumulus at San Giuliano is comparable formally and probably also functionally with the roof platforms topped by cippi of the later cube rock tombs—especially with those at Norchia. While there obviously exists an immediate relation between the single cippi and the burials in the chamber tomb (cut out deeply under the facade), the case of the cippus-monument at San Giuliano—clearly separated from the tumulus and worked as a unifi ed whole (perhaps in the period of the origin of the tumulus)—is different. This monument most probably should be interpreted as a large, aniconic and symbolic seat of the ancestors of the aristocratic owner family of the Cima Tumulus to whose honor and memory regular rituals and sacrifi ces were organized on particular days of the year. Thus the Cima Tumulus had originally three cult areas: a) the left dromos chamber of the Tomba Cima with the base of an altar, b) the cippus-monument east of the tumulus and c) most probably a cultic place on the top of the tumulus. These three areas—clearly distinguished spatially and typologically—were certainly destined for different kinds of rituals whose exact reconstruction and signifi cance remains unknown to us. Both a three-dimensional plastic as well as a virtual reconstruction of the Tumulo Cima with its seven tombs and the neighboring cippi-monument could certainly contribute towards a greater clarity and a deeper understanding of this unique Etruscan sepulchral complex.Finally we should point out the great importance of the architec-tural monuments and elements in Etruscan necropoleis and tombs that were used for the cult of the dead and ancestors (Steingräber 1997). In a recent publication by F. Prayon (2006), the manifold aspects of Etruscan cult of the dead and ancestors are discussed and summarized very clearly. Among the stone monuments we have to mention mainly the ramps of tumuli, the tops of tumuli with architectural structures, the upper platforms of the rock tombs, the places and ‘theaters’ for the cult (Colonna 1993), altars, stepped monuments and thrones (Prayon 1979). Ramps are especially well-documented in the necropoleis of Caere. Still more impressive is the monumental and richly decorated annex—a combination of ramp, terrace and altar—of the Tumulo del Sodo II at Camucia-Cortona, which dates from the second quarter of the 6th century BCE and was excavated and restored during the last fi fteen years. Further this colossal tumulus was topped by a small naiskos or aedicula which could be reached on a paved way up and obviously served for rituals too.

Concerning the original arrangements of the tops of tumuli, unfortunately, in most cases, no detailed investigations have been carried out. Particularly instructive is a tumulus cut out from the tufa rock in a very characteristic location of the Terrone necropolis at Blera that goes back to the fi rst half of the 6th century BCE and is topped by a ring-like construction in stone blocks including depressions (perhaps for cippi) (Ricciardi 1987; Steingräber 1996).Among the altars and ‘cult theaters’ in Etruscan necropoleis, Grotta Porcina remains the most impressive example. Close to a huge tumulus (diameter almost 30 m), a round altar (almost 2 m high) is located, which is decorated with animal-reliefs. It is approached by a small bridge-like ramp in the hollow of a valley and surrounded by steps on three sides. The tumulus and altar go back to the fi rst third of the 6th century BCE (Steingräber 1982; Colonna 1993). Other open places with steps for the spectators of funeral rituals in front of the tomb entrance are known from Tarquinia (Tumulo dell’Infernaccio of the 7th century BCE) and from Vulci (Cuccumella of the 7th century BCE). In the South Etruscan rock tomb area (San Giuliano, Blera, Norchia, Castel d’Asso), the moulded upper platforms of the cube and halfcube tombs with altar- and cippus-support function could be reached on lateral stairs. The situation is similar in the case of the logge or upper fl oors of the archaic porticus tombs at San Giuliano. In the case of the rock monument in Loc. Fontiloro near Oriolo Romano it is doubtful whether we have to deal with an auguraculum (Mirenda 1992; Steingräber 1996).BibliographyColonna di Paolo, E. 1978. Necropoli rupestri del Viterbese.

We can consider its position inside or outside the tomb, its relationship with and direct or indirect reference to the owner of the tomb and, in some fortunate cases, the relationship between the different pieces of sculpture within one funerary context. This contribution focuses mainly on the archaeo-logical evidence of South Etruria (including Narce) but also will take into consideration that of the Northern Etruria.We have data with regard to the exact fi nd context for only a small number of Etruscan funerary stone sculptures of the Orientalizing and Archaic age.1 The fi rst distinction to be made is that between sculptures found inside the tomb context, as part of the funerary domain, and out-side the tomb, visible for those who had to recognize the monument: a distinction which seems fundamental to us, but maybe was not so for the builders and relatives of the deceased of that time.The main part of the sculptures comes from outside the grave context and therefore remained visible. However, not all cases in which sculp-ture comes from outside of a tomb that had already been violated have been taken into account. Considering Jean Turfa’s relationship with 1 The present study is based on my PhD work, La scultura in pietra ad altorilievo e a tuttotondo dell’Etruria Meridionale nei periodi orientalizzante e arcaico, defended in July 2002 at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, which is currently in preparation for pub-lication in Studi Etruschi. Considering the elaborated corpus of c. 350 pieces of stone sculpture, we have context information only for some 10–20%, and only a still more limited number is useful for the present discussion.

Some pieces of sculptures come from the entrance of the dromos of a tumulus, as in the case of the Tomba della Capanna.Cerveteri, Tumulo II, Tomba della Capanna: no. 208The Tomba della Capanna or Tomba della Casa con Tetto Stramineo, excavated by Mengarelli (Mengarelli 1927, 158–159; Ricci 1955, col. 2 On Frothingham, friend of Wolfgang Helbig, see Barnabei and Delpino 1991, 451, note 12 and 463.3 Turfa 2005, 63.

By verifying the excavation notebooks it has become clear that the sculpture (now lost), a standing human fi gure with folded arms, was found in the fi rst section of the dromos of the tomb (Colonna and von Hase 1984, note 98).Similarly, in the Tomba dei Dolii e degli Alari in Cerveteri, the ter-racotta sphinx was found in the fi rst section of the dromos near the base-ment in the north of Tumulus II, and has been dated around 630 BCE (Mengarelli 1927, 159; Colonna and von Hase 1984, 50). The tomb’s classifi cation as Prayon type B2 confi rms the chronology of the tomb context in the second half of the 7th century BCE (Prayon 1975, 18).Similar situation is known in Northern Etruria in the Molinello Tumulus at Asciano, studied by Elisabetta Mangani (1987–1988; 1989–1990), where some sculptures, similar to statue no. 208, have been found in an identical position. Their interpretation as antenates, proposed by Mangani, outside the grave context seems strange. It is more likely that they functioned as psychopompoi or companions of the dead to the underworld in a way similar to that of some of other funerary creatures we know in stone sculpture, like the hippocamps.7 The xoanon fi gures from Chiusi, always found at the entrance of tombs, also have been interpreted as ancestors by Helle Damgaard Andersen (1993, 50–52), while Ingrid Krauskopf (2006, 83, note 97) prefers to see them as tomb guardians or demonic guides, “like the later fi gures of Vanth and Charun”.Veii, Tomba Campana: nos. 14, 70, 142, 143, 1448It has been demonstrated that the context of grave goods from the Tomba Campana, the discovery of which was announced by Marchese Campana at the beginning of February 1843, was actually a false one, typical for the Romantic age (Delpino 1985).

Bernardino necropolis in Orte (Roncalli 1979), carried out three years before ‘the discovery’. The proof that the tomb ‘discovered’ in 1843 was already known at least in 1825 comes from a drawing of that year by Francesco Caracciolo (Delpino 1991). The tomb has to be ascribed to Prayon type B2,9 even if some doubts have been expressed with regard to such an early dating for the entrance wall arch (Banti 1970, 41–43). The funer-ary beds of Steingräber type 5 and 6 do not contradict a chronology at the end of the 7th century BCE (Steingräber 1979, 91–92, 350 no. 783).10 The wall paintings, which are lost today, date to the period of the construction of the tomb, i.e. at the end of the 7th century BCE.11However, the grave goods, even if they are genuine pieces, did not come from the tomb; the corredo was entirely ‘composed’ by Marchese Campana, and, it has to be said, chosen with great ability and care, if we consider the fact that the deceit was discovered only almost one and a half centuries later.At this point we should consider the sculpture attributed to the Tomba Campana. In the fi rst inventory of pieces, written on February 15th, 1843 (a few days after the discovery), four lions are listed: two “outside the tomb”, i.e. immediately outside the fi rst funerary room, and two others, “worse preserved”, at the entrance of the dromos. Inside the fi rst room “two tufa stone heads” were found (Delpino 1985, 189, App. doc. 51). These lions indeed are depicted in the drawings by L. Gregori edited by Canina (Figs. 32–33),12 even if, in the notes regarding the theft of 1844, four lions are mentioned, two of which were beheaded on that occasion, and a third one thrown upside down. It seems that the heads that were taken off the bodies were put onto them again using tenons (Delpino 1985, 191–192).At the time when the Moscioni photographs were taken at the end of the nineteenth century, we see however two lions, in a different position compared to that indicated by Canina, lengthwise instead of transversally with regard to the dromos: they no longer look towards the 9 Typology to be dated 650–600 BCE in Caere.

It should be noted however that the photograph was made from a point quite close to the tomb, so that it would have been impossible to focus on the two other lions, which were possibly still present at the fi rst part of the dromos. Head no. 142 was put onto the lion on the right side probably for the picture.Today two headless lions are preserved, placed in front of the entrance to the tomb.13 The lion on the left side is the same as that in the Moscioni picture, but the other one seems to be different altogether from its counterpart in the photograph. Furthermore, head no. 142, pre-served together with the other two heads in the Villa Giulia storerooms, could not be put onto the body which is still in situ that still has its neck and the fi rst part of the head. It is possible that, at the moment when the photograph was taken, at least three lions were still preserved, of which two were used for the picture. Some time later, the lion on the right of the entrance took the place of the one depicted by Moscioni. Considering their weight and the diffi cult access to the tomb, it thus seems most probable that four lions were found together originally with the tomb and that they were part of the original sepulchre: a pair of lions at the entrance of the dromos and another pair which indicated the real entrance to the tomb.14 In fact, their position, as depicted by Gregori, seems too well situated not to refl ect the original situation. Therefore, the lions still present (nos. 14 and 15) can be dated to the end of the 7th century BCE.Concerning the heads, it has been noted that it is strange that they were said to have been found without bodies or busts inside the tomb, a tomb which itself was presumably “found intact”.15 It seems probable that they were carried in from the outside as part of the grave goods. A third head is not mentioned; probably it was found nearby and ended up in the Tomba Campana. As the tomb was the only one in the area that could be locked after the theft, it was used as a kind of depository (Cristofani and Zevi 1965, 8–9; Delpino 1985, 119).

We seem to have positive evidence for the presence of sculpture next to the door only in a few cases. However, we have this situation in the case of the Tomba Campana—if we accept the reconstruction of events as described above—and likewise in the case of the Cuccumella Tumulus (tombs A and B, Marcelliani excavations). In the latter context, the entrance of both the fi rst room and that of the vestibolo a cielo aperto was decorated by sculptures.21Other points of the circumference of the krepis around the tumulus could also be important as the presence of sculpture indicates. Concern-ing a series of sculptures, we know that they have been found “along the basement” or “near the krepis”, as in the case of the sphinx of Montetosto and that of the winged lion of the Cuccumelletta Tumulus (no. 66).2216 The three heads are listed both in the inventory composed at their arrival at Villa Giulia, and in the inventory list of three years later (Cristofani and Zevi 1965, 8, note 15).17 After the Castro discoveries we know of the existence of the wingless sphinx in Etruscan sculpture. The sculptures depicted by Canina however are clearly lions and there is no reason to doubt their existence in loco. Only the lions at the entrance of the dromos may have had heads damaged so much as to be no longer identifi able. The body of a sphinx, after all, is leonine. Probably they were well enough preserved to make their reconstruction as lions likely and probable.18 No. 197, Amsterdam, Allard Pierson Museum, inv.

The main room (Tomb II), with a male and a female burial, is dated around 675 BCE (Rizzo 1989, 161).

Prayon (1975, 71; plate 87:26) classifi es the tomb as D2, dated 575–525 BCE. The tomb is further attributed to the fi rst half of the century on the basis of the sculpture (Prayon 1975, 74, note 409). Colonna has drawn attention to the decoration with three fasce of the testata of the door gate, typical for tombs of Prayon type C, therefore dating it around 600 BCE (Colonna and Von Hase 1986, 50–51).32Blera, San Giovenale, Casale Vignale necropolis, loc.

The tumulus of Tomb 51 had a diameter of 21–21.5 m, moulded tufa stone cornices and was surrounded by a wide ditch. Two fragments of the cornice decorated with a becco di civetta show us that the tomb has to be included in the group of tombs belonging to the phase between tumulus and tomba a dado (Ricciardi 1990, 151; Ricciardi 1991, 36). A construction has been found on top of the tumulus, near the dromos, which may be interpreted as a bridge or an altar. Some fragments of pan tiles and cover tiles (found in the ditch of Tomb 50, similar overall with regard to the external structure) and in particular, a fragment of architectural terracotta of a feline protome found in the ditch of the tomb, suggest that this structure had a little temple on top.The fragments belong to at least two seated lions, found in the ditch along the tumulus, in a point diametrically opposite to the entrance of the dromos, of which no. 58 (Fig. 38)33 has been almost entirely recom-posed. These fragments are probably contemporary to the building of the tumulus and can be dated to the end of the 7th–beginning of the 6th century BCE (allowing a certain amount of time between the fi rst burial and the fi nishing of the external decoration). They were placed outside of the tumulus, maybe on top, as may be deducted from their position in the destruction layer according to the observations in the excavation notes.Stone architectural elementsAnother category of sculpture is that of the architectural elements in stone. Some animal protomes decorated the corners of funerary monuments, as in the case of the necropoleis of Cannicella (Orvieto) and Crocefi sso (Castro). At Castro, scholars do not agree regarding the interpretation of the monument, which has been seen either as a monumental altar for religious ceremonies (Colonna 1967; Colonna 1977, 204 and note 60; Steingräber 1982) or as tomba a dado (Sgubini Moretti 1980, 1981, 1986; Martelli 1988, 27, note 10).33 Tuscania, storerooms Museo Archeologico, inv. no. 112.511.

It had a rich sculptural decoration and contained the remains of the grave goods of the three funerary rooms. The tomb has been compared with the tombs in the Peschiera necropolis of Tuscania, a tomb in Blera (Ricciardi 1985, 4–8), as well as with the monumental building at Crocefi sso di Castro (Sgubini Moretti 1986; Colonna 1986, 444–445).Among the fi nds, fi ve bases for acroterial sculptures on the ridged roof were recovered, together with a series of cippi and two acroterial disks.

Most sculptures found in Castro have been attributed to a single tomb, called by the two Italian scholars Tomba dei Bronzi (Fig. 39).36 De Ruyt had advanced three hypotheses (De Ruyt 1983, 76–77): a direct connection with the important tomb nearby, two lines of statues that fl anked an access road to the necropolis (the only hypothesis advanced at fi rst), or that the sculptural decoration was a part of a construction with a quadrangular layout, as indicated by four holes on a tufa stone plateau.37 According to the most recent reconstruction, the sculpture seems to have to be connected directly to the tomb, of which two small 34 Tuscania, Museo Archeologico.

Sculptures would generally come in pairs, and the same creatures in different sizes (Sgubini Moretti and De Lucia Brolli 2003, 374–377).The reconstruction is certainly attractive, even if it seems diffi cult to see pieces so different in quality as the winged lion (inv. 81268)—in Vulcian nenfro—and some of the others, like the apterous sphinx (inv. 81263), clearly locally elaborated in the typical pink nenfro, as work of the very same workshop.

On the basis of its layout, Tomb A has been classifi ed as type Prayon A2 (Prayon 1975, 54 and footnote 268, pl. 86:17) and can be dated to the second half of the 7th century BCE.Marisa Bonamici in a fundamental study has distinguished two decorative cycles (Bonamici 1980) that are dated in the fi rst and second quarter of the 6th century BCE,40 confi rming, but also partly modifying, the reconstructions made by Hus (1961) and Brown (1960). According to her, the winged lions nos. 19, 20, 31, 34, 52, 53 and 67 belong to the fi rst phase of Tumulus decoration, while the wingless and crouching lion no. 6 and panther no. 93 have to be assigned to the second phase, dated to the second quarter of the 6th century BCE.It has to be said that already Brown attributed nos. 19, 34 and 67 to the fi rst group and nos. 6 and 93 to the second group of lions of Vulci, but he assigned them to different workshops within the same chronological period (Brown 1961, 62–70).Hus also attributed the winged sphinxes nos. 33,41 157 and 176 to this context. Bonamici’s proposal seems the most convincing, possibly with the inclusion of nos. 33, 157 and 176. The relationships between some of the pieces advanced by Hus have to be rejected, as pointed out by Bonamici.42More pieces from the Ferraguti-Mengarelli excavations of the Cuc-cumella Tumulus have become known thanks to the studies of Fran-cesco Buranelli (1994, 39–42). Numbers 63, 152 and 305 belong to the tumulus: a lion’s head, a (probably) male head and a piece of a wing (probably of a sphinx). The sculptures came from the dromos (no. 305) and from the central room of Tomb A (nos. 63 and 152).The lion’s head has to be identifi ed with the head published by Brown, who associated it with the other sculptures of the Cuccumella 40 Sgubini Moretti suggested a chronology for the tumulus still within the 7th century BCE on the basis of its architecture; this chronology seems to have been generally accepted (Sgubini Moretti 1994 31, note 114).41 According to Brown, this piece, attributed to the Cuccumella, belongs rather to a winged lion (Brown 1960, 62, n. 3).42 Cf.

The head is now lost, but was registered by Brown at the Villa Giulia, and was located in the Vulci Museum by Hus.

The head is very similar to head no. 142 of the Tomba Campana. Wing no. 30543 seems more likely to belong to a sphinx than to a lion, because of the degree of curvature and of the way in which the feathers are executed. When we compare nos. 19, 34, 20, 31 and 53, which are more or less complete, this is confi rmed and this fact contradicts its association with the isolated head no. 67. The lion’s head no. 67 is in fact very similar to the head of the standing winged lion no. 19. The wing also must have been similar, in contrast to the wing no. 305. Comparison with winged sphinxes (nos. 157 and 176), which are known from old drawings, argue in favor of reconstructing no. 305 as a sphinx. Thus, the tumulus probably was decorated by other creatures besides the already known lions, both winged and apterous.Sgubini Moretti has underlined the high quality and refi nement of this group of decorative elements, chosen and created with concern for proportions. In order to create this effect both the colossal head no. 67 and felines no. 6 and no. 93 should be imagined on top of the tumulus (Sgubini Moretti 1994, 31–32, note 115). The photographical documentation of Ferraguti provides new confi rmation of the existence of a construction on top of the tumulus, which in the most elaborate reconstructions of the tumulus has been described as one or more ‘towers’ (Buranelli 1994).A quadrangular structure, the foundations of which reached the ground level, was positioned somewhere near the second of the axial burial rooms (Buranelli 1994, 41–42; pl. L: 150). The fact that its posi-tion was not in the center of the tumulus, as proposed by Messerschmidt44 is confi rmed when we look at the context map published by Sgubini 43 The fragment is probably identical to the piece presented by Sgubini Moretti at the Convegno di Studi Etruschi e Italici of October 2001 (Sgubini Moretti 2005, pl.

During the Marcelliani excavations of the Cuccumella Tumulus (1879–1883), a series of sculptures was found that belong to Tomb A (Sgubini Moretti 1994, 30, note 109).

Only in a very few cases are sculptures mentioned that have been found inside the tomb and were certainly in situ.

The bronze bust also has been connected to an alabaster “pilaster” found in the tomb (Roncalli 1998, 23; Haynes 1991). Proof that the statue was part of the original grave context and was positioned inside the tomb can be found in the traces of fi re present both on the statue and on the other grave goods, as noted by Friederike Bubenheimer.Orvieto, Crocefi sso del Tufo necropolis: nos. 232; 233; 234Sculptures nos. 232, 233 and 234 of the Crocefi sso del Tufo Necropolis in Orvieto, which can be considered together with the more simple segna-cippi, are probably to be considered as cippi or external signs, even if some of them are found inside the tombs, presumably after the collapse of the ceiling. Recently, the sculptures of Orvieto and their fi nd contexts have been considered by Adriano Maggiani (2005) and Francesco Roncalli (2007). The Crocefi sso del Tufo necropolis, situated to the NW of the town, was discovered in 1874 and excavations were carried out by Mancini, owner of the land. The Tomb of the Double Bust (no. 232),56 excavated in December 1879 (Helbig 1879, 229–230)57 had a ceiling that had caved in, but the deceased were found in situ, apparently intact on the banchina by the rear wall. Several plain cippi were found together with the fi gural one. However, on the basis of the 54 Cf. also Buranelli 1995, 101. A study on the context is in preparation by Friederike Bubenheimer (Ph.D. study at the University of Heidelberg), who kindly discussed the context with me in January 2000.55 Luisa Banti, though, dates statue no. 212 in the third quarter of the 6th century BCE (Banti 1960, 284).56 Florence, Museo Archeologico, inv. no. 73.138, Orvieto 1 Hus.57 Cf.

Head no. 234, now in the Museo di Orvieto,58 comes from the Tomba del Guerriero (which takes its name from the sculpture)59 and was found inside the tomb, the ceiling of which has collapsed (Helbig 1881, 263–273). Some remains of the plundered grave goods have been preserved, among which twelve other non-fi gural cippi and a bronze coin of imperial age have been discovered.60 We do not seem to have precise information about the fi nd context of the Florentine head (no. 233).61Considering the fact that some simple cippi were found in association with the sculptures nos. 232 and 234 that might have had the role of grave markers, it is possible that these sculptures were originally posi-tioned inside the tomb and represented the deceased. In the case of the helmeted heads nos. 233 and 234, it seems probable that the sculpture represented the deceased. The latter interpretation is supported by the inscription on the Orvieto head, classifi ed as a warrior.62 We cannot exclude a representation of an ancestor of the deceased, but the presence of the inscription actually makes this interpretation unlikely. Placement of the sculpture outside the tomb, as already pointed out by Maggiani, seems therefore the most probable position.Outside or inside the tomb, the double bust no. 232 (two closely related deceased females?), remains enigmatic. It is almost necessary to return to the hypothesis formulated by Hus for the Pietrera sculptures that they were representations of divinities.63 Additionally, it seems useful to consider the case of Tomb 30 of the Fondo Mancini, where a non-fi gural cippus without an inscription was found “outside the ditch near the head” (Klakowicz 1972b, 185–186). This example suggests that even the simpler versions of the cippus could represent the deceased, indicating its presence outside the tomb.58 Sine inv., Orvieto 3 Hus.59 Klakowicz 1972a, 201–203 and Klakowicz 1972b, 201–204; tav. 5: 279.

As a general tendency, sculpture indicates the focal point of attention, marking a boundary between the world of the living and the world which is altro. It was placed not only in connection with the door or around the entrance of the dromos, but also in the area of the magic circle of the tumulus.The funerary character of stone sculpture, which seems to have been characteristic for this medium in Etruria, would have been clear for the visitor at fi rst glance. Additionally, the typology of the various Mischwesen, companions to the other world or symbols of death rather than mere “guardians”, would also have had signifi cant meaning in this context. It is probably not by chance or only for aesthetic reasons that some of the sculpture still in situ has been found at the cardinal points and we probably should connect its position with the disciplina etrusca, the religious interpretation of space.BibliographyAA.VV. 1980.

The necropo-leis reveal the vitality of this center right from the beginning and they defi ne the prominent position of the city, when compared to the other settlements of northern Etruria (Bartoloni 1989; 1991; 2000; 2002). Contacts with other regions are evident early on based on the archaeo-logical artifacts and architecture. Particularly interesting are the ties to people on the Tyrrhenian islands (Bartoloni 1997), which explain the choice of settlement location (Bartoloni 2002). The position of Popu-lonia is unique for northern Etruria: it is the only Etruscan settlement situated directly on the sea coast. Other Etruscan sites are located at least 5 km away from the sea, coastal lagoons or rivers, on hills, where they exploited wide arable and well-drained lands. While these sites generally had harbors to control access to the sea, the harbors never formed the primary settlement site.Thus, while other large protourban Etruscan settlements were sur-rounded by farm land, the territory of Populonia also embraced the sea that connected it to the islands of the Tuscan Archipelago. The Iron Age fi nds on Elba confi rm this bond with the coastal city. Also the legendary tradition of the origin of Populonia confi rms the city’s connection with the Tyrrhenian Sea. A well known passage of Servius (ad Aen. 10.172) gives three different versions of Populonia’s foundation: the fi rst connects the city to people of Corsica; the second indicates 1 I am glad to dedicate this toast to my friend Jean Turfa, whose courtesy and scientifi c help I have always appreciated."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"160 gilda bartolonithat is was founded as a colony by people from Volterra;2 and the third argues that the Volterrans conquered it from the Corsicans.Recently it has been suggested that the population of Populonia was concentrated on the promontory from the very beginning (Bartoloni 2005). This theory is an alternative to the hypothesis, based on the distribution of the Villanovan necropoleis—Poggio del Telegrafo to the south and Casone, Piano and Poggio delle Granate to the north—that asserted the existence of at least two contemporary villages (Pacciarelli 2001; Peroni 2002). The hypothesis of Delpino (1981), supported by Colonna (1981), suggests seeing a perhaps more ancient settlement, evidenced by the necropolis of Poggio delle Granate, with some Pro-tovillanovan precursors and a following development in the area of the hill occupied by Populonia during the historical period, as shown by the funerary occupation of Poggio della Guardiola area. A distribution of the settlements, which considers both issues of chronology and topog-raphy, would allow the identifi cation of an important moment in the history of the center, a moment of crisis and interruption, coinciding with the move of its nucleus toward the slopes and the summit of the hill (the historical Populonia).However, the recent surveys led by the University of Siena in the hills surrounding the Gulf of Baratti (Botarelli 2003) have not revealed any traces of this period, not even in Poggio San Leonardo, a site that is generally connected to the necropolis of Piano and Poggio delle Granate (Bartoloni 1989; 1991). Evidence from the beginning of the Iron Age was found in the Poggio della Guardiola. Populonia differs from other Etruscan settlements in that chamber tombs are attested early on at the necropolis of Poggio and Piano delle Granate. This is an extraordinary development in so far as it clearly refl ects the social ordering of society at the funerary level. The use of the family grave in Populonia predates by at least one century its use at other Etruscan settlements, revealing a strong sense of aristocratic continuity at Populonia from the middle of the 9th century BCE (Bartoloni 2000). It seems unlikely that the large funerary complex of Piano and Poggio delle Granate, the most important necropolis also from an architectural point of view, should be associated with a small satellite village.2 On the prominent role of Volterra within northern Etruria, which could justify the tradition related to the colonization of Populonia, see Bonamici 2003, 520."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" the earliest etruscan toast 161The variability of the data coming from surveys and the lack of stratigraphical investigations of most of the areas occupied by the city of the historical period induce us to consider each hypothesis about its earliest stages with caution. Nevertheless, at present what seems to emerge is a concentration of traces of settlement of this epoch only on the promontory; Villanovan remains have been found on the two hills of Telegrafo and of Castello, especially in the saddle between the two hills, and in the area surrounding them. The recent discovery of ceramic fragments during surveys at Punta delle Pianacce suggests that we can recognize a village on Populonia’s promontory.The excavation in progress on the slopes of Poggio del Telegrafo, organized by the Soprintendenza Archeologica per la Toscana with the participation of students of the Cattedra di Etruscologia e Archeologia Italica of the University of Rome, and coordinated by the present writer, has shown that the settlement was already organized on terraces dur-ing the earliest occupation phase, from the beginning of the Iron Age to the late Orientalizing period. The areas along the ridges of the hills were also inhabited. The necropoleis therefore delimited the settlement area (Bartoloni 2007A).Camilli (2005) has recently suggested dating the Strabonian harbor of Populonia back to the proto-historical period.3 This implies that one of the harbors of the city could have been located at least 4 km from the center. The settlement of the Populonian territory, both inland and on the coast, is dated already to the fi nal phase of the Early Iron Age and the beginning of the Orientalizing period, as shown by the fi nds of Villa Salus in S. Vincenzo, one or two rural settlements recognized in the S. Antonio area and Franciana near the stream Acquaviva, a series of productive sites in the area that separated the lagoon from the Gulf of Follonica’s sea. Also the hoard of Bambolo near Castagneto Carducci, the depositions of Riparo Biserno, the necropolis of Pitti Mountain in the Cornia basin, and other tumuli on the slopes of Mount Valerio belong to this phase. The area behind the Gulf of Follonica seems to never have been settled, probably due to the presence of large swamps in the area. Recent research (Esposito 1999) has delineated the ter-ritorial boundary with Vetulonia to the south, along the course of the Pecora. The northern boundary with Volterra was probably marked 3 Analogous suggestions have been made for the harbor of Vetulonia, which was located near Lake Prile."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"162 gilda bartoloniby a water course south of the Cecina between Bibbona and Bolgheri, while to the east, a boundary line could be traced between the islands of Capraia and Pianosa.The hoard of Falda della Guardiola, considered as evidence of a foundation rite for the fortifi cation that traced the circuit of the lower city walls, was probably buried in the middle of the 8th century BCE. At that time a reoccupation of the territory is noted, albeit of a very different nature from that of the Late Bronze Age. The presence of a fortifi cation that dates back to the 8th century BCE now fi nds com-parison in the excavations conducted by Francesca Boitani at Veii, by Mariolina Cataldi at Tarquinia and by Anna Sgubini Moretti at Vulci, where defensive structures with embankment have been identi-fi ed (Chianciano, Chiusi, In press).In my opinion, the early Iron Age forms an important step in the history of Etruscan society, evidenced both in the settlements and in the necropoleis by the emergence of the aristocracy (Bartoloni 2003). The appearance of a stable and articulated settlement hierarchy by the middle or end of the 8th century BCE represents an evident change in the history of the landscape of these areas. With the birth of these new settlements, often in areas already occupied during the Final Bronze Age, there is a reversal in the manner of occupation of the territory in comparison to the situation created by the birth of the proto-urban centers.Similar to the situation that we must imagine for the great Villanovan centers, the decision-making process that resulted in an increasingly systematic occupation of rural areas must be attributed to centralized political organizations. This phenomenon has been connected to the birth of a real aristocratic landscape. The formation of an aristocracy, a small group of people that governed through their prominent posi-tion in comparison to the rest of the population, a position that soon tended to become hereditary, appears common to all of the most important political organizations of antiquity. Every Etruscan aristocrat tried to present himself as a rex inside his own social group, whether that group was the familia or the more or less widened gens, the curia or even the populus.The aristocratic building at Poggio del TelegrafoThe rectangular building found during the excavations of Poggio del Telegrafo (Fig. 40), was an important element in the architectural land-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" the earliest etruscan toast 163scape of the early urban center, and it must have been the residence of the local king. It had a thatched roof, supported by wooden posts and it seems to have been restored at least three times before being abandoned in the fi rst quarter of the 7th century BCE. The identifi ca-tion of this structure as ‘the king’s house’ would reveal the primary use of the acropolis of the Etruscan city.In fact, during the intentional abandonment of the complex, a cut was made (0.60 × 0.40 × 0.50 m) through the southern post-holes of the third line. It had been fi lled by a large number of kyathoi, which had a surmounting handle and an umbilicate bottom (with few typological and dimensional variants). The kyathoi were generally complete, or broken after deposition (Fig. 41). The small dimensions of the pit caused a dense accumulation of the cups, some of which have been found stacked in groups of two or three. An estimate based on the complete and half-preserved vessels allowed us to identify between 77 and 84 cups, to which must be added several fragments still in restoration. The deposit was probably formed in a very short lapse of time, perhaps as a single deposition, to judge from the concentration and from the state of preservation of the material. A practice connected with the consump-tion of food or drink is suggested by the composition of the earth fi ll of the pit, characterized by a reddish color and by the strong presence of organic material,4 as well as by the shape of the vessels.Most of the cups (Fig. 42) can be attributed to a kyathos type with everted lip and rounded or fl attened rim, a more or less compressed body with separate shoulder, and a convex and umbilicate bottom; the surmounting handles are circular in section on the upper part and fl attened at the base, with rare traces of decoration consisting of groups of incised lines. The complete vessels measure between 3 and 5 cm in height to the lip. The type fi nds comparisons in quite a wide area, and appears in contexts dated between the last decades of the 8th and the fi rst decades of the 7th century BCE. The type is found at Populonia, Casale Marittimo, Vulci, Poggio Buco and Tarquinia.54 Currently being analyzed at of the Center of Restoration of the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici della Toscana.5 For Populonia, see Fedeli 1983, 222 no. 83, 308 no. 181; Romualdi 1994, 180; for Casale Marittimo, see Maggiani 2006, 436 fi g. 4; for Vulci see Mangani 1995, 396 no. 4.12, fi gs. 18.2 and 21.2, 409; Moretti Sgubini 2001, 196 nos.

Three cups have a more defi ned shoulder, a low ring foot, and a surmounting handle with shaped edges. For these, the best comparison at the moment is represented by the vases from the tumulus of Poggio Gallinaro at Tarquinia that are among the fi rst examples of the local bucchero.6In the Chiavari necropolis, in Liguria, among the so-called impasto buccheroide ware there are some umbilicate cups, similar to those of Pog-gio del Telegrafo. They are usually found together with empty ollas and connected to the ceremonial consumption of wine (Melli 1993, 105–106, 114–115; Palladino 2004, 252–253, IV.1.3.6). This evidence confi rms the vitality of the trading route that reached the coasts of Tuscany and Liguria between the last decades of the 8th century and the fi rst decades of the 7th century BCE (Maggiani 2006).Evidence of a drinking ritualThe deposit of cups at Populonia can be considered as a sign of a sym-bolic action undertaken at a specifi c moment, which marks the end of the life of the earliest phase of the rectangular structure. The number of the cups, which amounts to almost a hundred, and the recurrence of the form of the cup suggests a collective participation in the event as well as the use of a drink with strong symbolic value, probably wine.The excavations in the Etruscan inhabited areas show that rituals played a prominent role in the events that preceded or concluded struc-tural or functional changes in the use of a given area. The case of the Civita of Tarquinia is emblematic: here bloody actions and symbolic offers have been recognized (Bonghi Jovino, In press), and related to the so-called “complesso sacro-istituzionale” (Serra Ridgway 2006). Evidence of similar rituals is also emerging at smaller sites, such as 6 Petrizzi in Bonghi Jovino 1986, 213 no. 591. Note, for example, the cup made in the so-called ‘brown surface bucchero’, dated to the second quarter of the 7th century BCE."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" the earliest etruscan toast 165Campassini-Monteriggioni where, towards the end of 8th–7th century BCE, in the settlement area several pits seem to have been closed by ritual depositions of vases or animals (Bartoloni 2002, 21; Acconcia and Biagi 2002, 90–99, 118). The deposit of nearly one hundred cups at Populonia undoubtedly marks the destruction of the rectangular structure, a building of high rank.The cup with surmounting handle appears to be clearly related to wine drinking in the early and middle Orientalizing period; the cup is used both to draw liquids from craters or ollas, and as a jug (Bartoloni, Acconcia and Ten Kortenaar, In press). A sure sign of this use is its presence as an imported object in grave 168 (the grave of Nestor’s cup) in the San Montano necropolis of Pithekoussai (Nizzo 2007), which, according to Murray (1994), may document the fi rst use of the sym-posium in the central-western Mediterranean. All the vases exported from Pithekoussai to the local settlements (amphorae, cups) or imported from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Greek city (anforette, cups) are related to wine drinking (Bartoloni 2006). The most famous attestation for the function of this type of cup comes from its presence, together with a kantharos, in the metallic and in the ceramic set of the Warrior grave of Tarquinia (Kriseleit 1988).Wine consumptionIt is interesting to notice that wine is a masculine prerogative in Athenian funerary assemblages. Only neck amphorae are attributed to males, generally warriors; the rounded amphorae and the hydriae, connected with the water, are female (Belletier 2003). An example of the latter is the Greek-type hydria used as an ossuary in deposition 160 of the necropolis of Poggio Selciatello of Tarquinia (d’Agostino 2006, 338–339), which is probably attributable to a woman of Greek origin (Bartoloni 2007B).The Greek distinguishes himself from the barbarian in drinking wine mixed with the water and, during specifi c occasions, ritualizing the consumption of this drink. Already in Homer, “Alcinous spoke to the herald, and said: ‘Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve wine to all in the hall, that we may pour libation also to Zeus’” (Hom. Od. 7.179–180).7 7 All translations from Homer can be found in the Loeb Classical Library, trans. A. T. Murray."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"166 gilda bartoloniThe composure of Alcinous and the Achaeans during the banquet “è contrapposta alla disastrosa inumanità di chi ignora che bere è un atto di civiltà” (Della Bianca 2002, 29). The symposium appears therefore as a “pratica d’intrattenimento conviviale centrata sul consumo del vino” (Lombardo 1989, 311). This habit, being an important moment of socialization and aggregation, has been considered “l’espressione originale tra VIII e VII secolo a.C. di uno stile di vita aristocratico legato all’emergere di una vera e propria aristocrazia, come ceto (o ordine) sociale che tende a riconoscersi, defi nirsi e distinguersi” (Vetta 1983, XL).The location of the post-hole fi lled with cups in the center of the structure allows us to think of a ceremony that took place in the central area, used for meetings by the representatives of the whole commu-nity, such as that reconstructed by the Carandini team for the Domus Regia near the Temple of Vesta (Carandini 2006, 538–544). Thus, the deposition of the cups is the sign of a ceremony that took place on the occasion of the destruction of the ‘royal building’.Braccesi’s reference to the joyful toast that was made in an exclu-sive circle of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos to celebrate the death of a tyrant is attractive. This is the fi rst toast with a defi nite political connotation from Western literature (Braccesi 1991). Alcaeus invites the companions of eteria to an uncontrolled drinking (Voigts 1963, fr. 332).The connection of these cups with wine and their pertinence to a group of eminent people has to be considered more than likely. We lack written sources on the role of ritual drinking in Etruria, and therefore the texts created in the same period in the Eastern Mediterranean, that is the Homeric poems, can offer a helpful comparison (Ampolo 2000). Most researchers, considering the long pre-Homeric oral tradi-tion, agree about setting the economic and social background of the Homeric poems in the 8th century BCE: the customs and traditions of the contemporary dominant class had to be refl ected in the Iliad and in the Odyssey. Testimony of such a practice can be found when a Phoenician woman leads a young Eumaeus through the palace of his father, Ctesius, on the island of Syria. Homer writes: “but she took me by the hand, and led me forth from the house. Now in the forehall of the palace she found the cups and tables of the banqueters who waited upon my father. They had gone forth to the council and the people’s place of debate” (Hom. Od. 15.465– 468). Or during the meeting when it was decided to send the embassy to Achilles in the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" the earliest etruscan toast 167Iliad: “youth fi lled the bowls brimful of drink, and served out to all, pouring fi rst drops for libation into the cups” (Hom. Il. 9.96–181E). Another reference can be found when Athena remarks, in front of the palace of Alcinous: “here, father stranger, is the house which you asked me to show you, and you will fi nd the kings, fostered of Zeus, feasting at the banquet” (Hom. Od. 7.50).The above mentioned Homeric characters, called basileis, can well represent the distinguished fi gures of the different communities of pro-tohistorical Italy. These men were elite in comparison with the rest of their community not only in terms of their funerary assemblage but also for their particular type of dwelling. Elite houses differ from the simple huts owned by other community members not only in terms of the dimensions but also because of the presence of areas designed for public reunions. The interpretation of ‘the king’s house’ with a space for collective meetings, could also be applied to the oldest structure of Casalvecchio of Casale Marittimo with its large portico (Esposito 1999) or Roselle’s round house with enclosures of the middle Orientalizing period (Bartoloni and Bocci Pacini 2002).In conclusion, a libation by one hundred people at Poggio del Tele-grafo witnessed and ritualized the destruction of the house of the king (Fig. 43). This ceremony could also have been used to celebrate the assumption of power of new leadership in the area of Populonia. After all, in Rome during the Archaic period there is an association between wine and sovereign power (Coarelli 1995, 202).BibliographyAcconcia, V., and F.

Many cultures have the custom of covering over the mirrors in the house at the time of a death,1 to prevent the soul of the deceased from taking refuge in the mirror’s interior world, only to return later because that place provided no permanent rest. Our popular supersti-tion that the accidental breaking of a mirror brings seven years of bad luck is another example of how the user of a mirror may feel that a path has been broken. In this case, the force within the mirror is evi-dently regarded as something positive that can be accessed as long as the mirror is maintained. The careless person who breaks the mirror thereupon loses access to the fragile commodity of good fortune. The Etruscans had customs relating to the mutilation of mirrors, and in all cases they seem to relate to a tomb context, that is, to another world to which the mirrors might provide a pathway. In this article written as an offering to Jean Turfa,2 I propose to survey as fully as possible the published examples of ritual cancellation or damaging of Etruscan mirrors, and probe the nature of the belief that may have motivated these acts.Thus far only a small percentage of Etruscan mirrors have been identifi ed as having been intentionally mutilated so that they could 1 See Goldberg 1985, 1–3 on the relationship between refl ections and death.2 I am delighted to have this opportunity to write up the results of a study I origi-nally undertook at Jean’s invitation, when I gave a paper on this topic at a session she organized on “Etruscans in the Museum”, at the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, in Philadelphia, January 3–6, 2002. I thank her most sincerely for the many occasions on which she has stimulated, supported and responded to my efforts in research on the Etruscans."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"172 nancy t. de grummondno longer be used (de Grummond 2002, 309).3 Most obvious of these are the mirrors that have the word śuθina, ‘for the tomb’, which are surveyed in Appendix I. In most cases, the word is written on the refl ecting side of the mirror, but one mirror (no. 6) has śuθina written on both sides and another has the inscription on the engraved side of the mirror (no. 8). In effect, what the inscription does is cancel the refl ecting side, since the inscription would interfere with anyone trying to use the mirror.A mirror in the Museo Faina in Orvieto will serve as a typical exam-ple of the ‘suthinized’ mirrors (no. 18; Figs. 44–45).4 Upon its reverse is a scene with a four-fi gure group surrounded by a Spiky Garland, of a composition that occurs on numerous Etruscan mirrors, with Menrva in the middle, identifi able by her helmet, and with a naked female fi gure beside her, perhaps Turan. The two are fl anked and framed by two males who look like twins and wear a Phrygian cap, and are readily identifi able as the Tinascliniar (Dioskouroi). It is interesting that there are two other mirrors in the Faina collection, one with a Spiky Garland and the other with a guilloche border, showing slight variations on this four-fi gure group (nos. 19–20). Five more examples in other collections show the combination of Spiky Garland and four-fi gure group (nos. 2, 6, 15, 17, 18). Should we think there is some connection between this particular subject matter and decoration and the ritual of canceling the refl ecting side? In fact this can be answered immediately in the negative, since the subject matter varies considerably in mirrors with śuθina, as may be seen by a glance at their list. There are other Spiky Garland mirrors with highly innovative subjects such as the healing of Prumathe (Prometheus) by Esplace (Asklepios) and the construction of the horse Pecse by Sethlans and Etule, as well as mirrors not of the Spiky Garland category with strongly ritual depictions such as the Egg scene from Porano (no. 8), which shows a family group gathered around the egg of Elinai, or the famous mirror in the British Museum 3 The listings given in Appendices I and II to this article correct some erroneous statements that appeared in the earlier article. The total number of relevant mirrors has increased to 32 in the present count, but still remains a quite small percentage of all Etruscan mirrors known.4 Richard De Puma introduced the verb ‘to suthinize’ in his paper on “A Third-Century B.C. Tomb Group from Bolsena in the Metropolitan Museum of Art”, at the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, San Diego, January 3, 2007.

Another three in the Faina Museum in Orvieto may plausibly be connected with this territory as well (nos. 18–20). Further, it is well known that among the numerous inscriptions of śuθina known on a variety of objects—pitchers, buckets, strigils, incense burners—a very large number of them can be traced to this same geographical area. Rix lists 133 examples,6 almost all connected with the territory of Volsinii, and almost all of bronze; a few scattered examples come from Cerveteri and Campania. Two ‘suthinized’ mirrors come from the area of Chiusi (nos. 15, 21). Furthermore these objects seem to belong to a particular moment in time, around the end of the 4th and the fi rst half of the 3rd century BCE. Thus the ritual of marking something as śuθina, ‘for the tomb’, is really to be understood fi rst as a larger phenomenon, refl ecting some widespread ritual practice; within this spectrum mirrors constitute a sub-group that may nevertheless have its own rationale.In many cases the markings do not really deface, but rather decorate the objects. A collection of fi ne bronzes in the Vatican, at once superb and yet typical of ‘suthinized’ items, demonstrates this effect. From the tomb of Laris Havrenies, found at Bolsena and dating to the end of the 4th century BCE (Buranelli 1992, 134–141), come 15 bronze items forming part of a service for the banquet of eternity, including a grand krater, several situlae, two large pitchers, two strainers and a group of small jugs. The inscriptions are placed on the rims, handles and bodies of the vessels, always neatly, and looking like decoration. The beauty of śuθina can be seen even more in the splendid objects from the tomb group from Bolsena in the Metropolitan Museum of which the Prumathe mirror is a part.7 Here the inscriptions are delicately 5 Rebuffat-Emmanuel 1973, 561–565, 638.

The lettering was carefully done, and the closing of the window in the mirror was fi rm and controlled. Rather different is another ritual of canceling mirrors to which I would like to call attention. From time to time scholars have noted that some mirrors seemed to be intention-ally damaged (CSA USA 3.4; CSA USA 2.44). They are not many, but brought together they do prove, I think, that there was such a ritual. I have prepared a hand list of these as well (Appendix II), and will call attention to some of the ways in which they differ from the śuθina mirrors, and then to some of the rather important characteristics they share.The evidence for ritual mutilation of mirrors begins almost 150 years earlier than the period we have been discussing, with a late Archaic mirror attributed to Vulci, depicting the goddess Thesan (Appendix II: no. 6; Fig. 46). Unfortunately nothing is known of the fi nd spot, but it is very likely that the object was placed in a tomb and that it was dedicated to the dead by being folded up. Some force was necessary. The fold seems to have been toward the reverse, so that the image showing Thesan in fl ight would have been concealed when the act of ‘closing’ the mirror was completed. Yet another example of folding is found considerably later, in a mirror in Perugia (no. 8; Fig. 47), where the handle was bent back toward the refl ecting side, making it very dif-fi cult for someone to look into it. The subject matter on this mirror of the fi rst half of the 3rd century BCE implies a ritual, showing an altar with two males seated upon it, with an incense burner beside them. They are getting armed with the help of a female, and are probably Orestes and Pylades coming to the aid of Iphigenia.Then there are the mirrors that show gouging, most prominent of which is a stunning example at Harvard (no. 10; Fig. 48), perforated by no less than ten holes. Some kind of spike or cylindrical sharp pointed object must have been stabbed or hammered again and again into the disc. This mirror also belongs to the fi rst half of the 3rd century BCE, and in fact shows distinct affi nities with many of the mirrors in the śuθina group, having the Spiky Garland and a three-fi gured group featuring Menrva. Another connecting note is sounded by a fi ve-fi gure composition dating to the late 4th century BCE, gouged repeatedly, which comes from Viterbo in the orbit of Volsinii (no. 5). Two mirrors"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" on mutilated mirrors 175in the group have Egg themes (nos. 2 and 3), causing us to wonder again whether subject content on the mirrors can be linked in any way with the rituals involved in burying mirrors.Thus far we have seen mirrors canceled by writing, by folding and by gouging. I would like to suggest that there is yet another category to be recognized and that is mirrors that have been pounded or ham-mered. For this we can return to the mirror with which we started (Appendix I: no. 18; Fig. 44), and this time look at the cross-section drawing. It reveals a pronounced depression in the center of the mirror, which can only have been achieved in one way, by pounding it with a hammer or small mallet. The circular pattern of the cracks going around the periphery of the depression supports this conclusion. Maria Stella Pacetti describes the result as “fratture provocate dal consistente schiacciamento del recto” (CSA Italia 4.6, 21). This mirror is the most suggestive evidence that there is in fact probably a link between the two groups of mirrors surveyed here. This one, with a likely provenance of Orvieto (Volsinii) and a dating in the fi rst half of the 3rd century BCE, features the Spiky Garland, the four-fi gure group, the word śuθina, and the forcibly mutilated refl ecting surface. A mirror from Norchia (Appendix II: no. 9), of precisely this same period and not too far away from Orvieto, likewise shows a “schiacciamento” (CSE Italia 5.38).There are in fact other objects from the territory of Volsinii that show ritual mutilation. While for the lady there was the mirror, for the lord there was armor. At Bomarzo a grave of the 4th century BCE (Buranelli 1992, 96) yielded a bronze corselet with numerous holes in it; perhaps these were infl icted in battle, but other items in the burial showed clear evidence of intentional mutilation so that they would not be fi t for a living warrior. Also in the tomb were two crushed shin guards and a shield of bronze, broken and folded. Again from Bomarzo, but dating considerably earlier (6th–5th century BCE) is a shield in the Vatican (Buranelli 1992, 100), covered with cuts and gouges and folded in three and deposited in the burial.This kind of practice is regularly referred to as ‘killing’ the object, so that it can accompany the deceased to the afterlife.8 There is certainly other evidence for this kind of behavior in Etruria, beginning in the Iron Age with the well-known custom of breaking off one of the handles 8 Philpott 1991, 239; Chapman 2000, 25; CSA USA 2.44, esp. 62; Bonfante 2006, 20 and 24 (note 39). I thank William A. Parkinson for assistance with this topic."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"176 nancy t. de grummondof the ash urn, presumably to render it impossible to carry by a person in the real world.9 Of course the very act of cremating was intended to make the human body undergo a transformation, releasing the spirit to another world. Similarly, burning grave goods on a pyre meant that they were destined for another kind of existence.On the whole, I am doubtful that these were the only conditioning factors in the very particular phenomenon that we see in the treatment of mirrors in the area of Orvieto, Bolsena and their periphery in the late 4th and early 3rd centuries BCE. Given that in most cases, the mutilation of the mirrors was done to the refl ecting side, I think it is likely that the ritual behavior here is linked not only to the idea that the object must be altered for use in the afterlife, but also to beliefs about the power of the mirror to negotiate between worlds. The careful placement of śuθina across the viewing area of the disc did not mean necessarily that the mirror was killed, only that it was ready for the tomb. That is, it would no longer allow passage back and forth. No one living could see into it, and no deceased person could travel back from the other world through that pathway. In this case the motive, which was probably fear, expressed itself in a subdued and formal fashion, using the written word to control the force associated with the mirror and not attempting to break it. This restrained attitude seems contradictory to the other approach, to attack the mirror and gouge it or hammer it, and especially baffl ing is the case of the Faina mirror (Figs. 44–45) in which we seem to have both rituals used on the same mirror. Is there any way to reconcile this seemingly vicious treatment of the object with the other custom in which the mirror is kept intact, but symbolically sealed?I suggest that the two rituals actually make two necessary statements that are not contrary but complementary. The fi rst case, as stated, concerns the problems that might arise if the doorway-like mirror is left open. The other ritual may have to do with the fact that the Etruscan mirror was demonstrably an instrument of prophecy and fate (de Grum-mond 2000), and the goal of the ritual may have been to shut down 9 Such urns are found with two handles in habitation areas, but the ones for the grave were almost always one-handled, either having been made that way or having had one handle broken off. See Bartoloni 1989, 123–124, where an alternative expla-nation for the one-handled urn is offered, however; it may have been thought of as analogous with water jars, which women regularly held on the head with one hand. See also Tovoli 1989, 28."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" on mutilated mirrors 177not the passage way, but the power of the mirror to negotiate fate and fortune. It is probably no accident that the Orvieto mirror and several others seem to show blows from a hammer, or in some cases, holes made by a large spike, which would have to be driven by a hammer. This ritual of mutilating Etruscan mirrors may provide yet another example of how the hammer and nail were used as instruments of fate in Etruria.10 The picture is not completely tidy, since mirrors that are gashed or folded are not necessarily accommodated by this hypothesis. Clearly more examples are needed to test and possibly expand the theory, and it is hoped that those who are studying the mirrors close at hand will be alert to the physical conditions of the mirrors that may bring greater understanding of these rituals.BibliographyBartoloni, G. 1989.

Our interpretations must take into account the conservative aspect of religious and ritual dress, the historical context of the literary evidence, the funerary or votive context of the archaeological evidence, and the accident of preservation of the organic material of the actual garments, most of which are lost forever. Then, too, names and meanings of vari-ous garments and costumes normally change over time, and what is considered ritual dress at one moment is often seen differently at another time. In the case of iconography, we cannot always be sure that the artist was depicting a garment that really existed, that our interpretation of a particular representation of a costume is correct, or that it had a ritual meaning for the Etruscans. The very fact that certain costumes were represented, however, means that they were important, that they had some meaning. In the end, then, we can distinguish certain special costumes and attributes of priests and priestesses, as well as costumes reserved for special ceremonies and situations.The Iron Age, Villanovan PeriodThe dress worn during the Iron Age in Italy is diffi cult to identify from the monuments of this period, c. 1000–750 BCE (It is known as the Villanovan period, named for the site of Villanova, near Bologna, where it was fi rst recognized). As in the Greek Geometric style, the way the fi gures are represented provides few details, and specifi c features are rendered in a shorthand version. But costumes and attributes from 1 For Jean, whose spirit is as generous as her intellect is sharp."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"184 larissa bonfantethis period had such a strong symbolic weight that we can often work back in time, and recognize certain costumes that were used in ritual ceremonies, and that maintained their sacred power in later times.Furthermore, recent research and better excavation techniques have provided important new information about this early period of the history of the Etruscans, and of Italy. Two sites in particular have revolutionized our thinking: Tarquinia and the northern site of Ver-ucchio, near Rimini, have provided material evidence concerning the ritual practices of the inhabitants of these towns. Detailed accounts of the material from the necropolis of Verucchio have been most recently published by Patrizia von Eles (1994, 2002). Finds of surprisingly well-preserved organic material from 8th century BCE tombs include great quantities of wooden furniture, amber, and preserved textiles and garments.Most surprising was the discovery of remnants of two woolen mantles with rounded borders, the Etruscan tebennas which were the ances-tors of the Roman togas, in the grave of an important man (Stauffer 2002, 192–234). These ritual garments and other objects placed in his tomb characterize the deceased as a warrior and priest. The rounded borders indicate that already in this early period the shape of the gar-ments differed from those of the Greeks, which were always woven as square or rectangular pieces of cloth. It is particularly interesting to fi nd these rounded mantles in the north, since a rounded mantle is also found among the surviving garments found in the northern peat bogs (Gerömsberg, Sweden: Bonfante 2003, 220, fi g. 94); the form may ultimately derive from the rounded shape of animal skins. A number of remnants of textiles at Verucchio with a furry nap, imitating animal skins, seem to have been used for blankets or coverings rather than for garments, but their existence shows that there was the technical ability to produce such cloth (Stauffer 2002, 215).Also preserved at Verucchio is a remarkable, full-size wooden throne decorated with scenes of wool working carved on its back in a minia-ture style. Two women, distinguished by their long braids, are shown weaving at a splendidly decorated loom. Two others, fl anked by armed guards, are involved in a ritual scene. It is assumed that this seat of honor was made for a woman, since everywhere in Etruria, throughout this period, women’s graves are characterized by wool working equip-ment—loom weights, spindles and distaffs—while men were provided with the armor and weapons that identifi ed them as warriors. The importance of textiles for their economic and symbolic value is well"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" ritual dress 185known. Elaborate textiles were objects of great value, gifts worthy of royalty (Barber 1992, 60 and passim). Archaeology has also revealed that important ladies or ‘princesses’ of Etruria and Latium were dressed for the grave in sumptuous jewelry, and in dresses covered with thousands of amber and glass beads. These may have been their wedding dresses, which they wore after death, rather than shrouds especially made for the funerary ritual.2Male Ritual DressThus from very early times, grave goods distinguished the gender of the deceased, just as their manner of dressing identifi ed the living. These grave goods, like priestly dress, or the votive gifts given to the gods, acquired a special status: they had been transferred to another sphere of reality. In much the same way, the dress and attributes of these early aristocrats lived on in the religious rituals of their descendants. The title of the book on the fi nds at Verucchio, Guerriero e Sacerdote, ‘Warrior and Priest’, calls attention to the fact that the dress of warriors also identifi ed them as priests. And indeed a number of the features of later Roman priestly dress hark back to military costumes and symbols of the aristocratic warrior class of the early days, such as the pointed helmets, and the draping of the mantle in the cinctus Gabinus of the Roman Salii (cf. Glinister in this volume). Traditional attributes of priests, like the curved ceremonial wand or lituus, illustrated on many monuments, also go back to very early times. The discovery of a folded-up lituus-shaped trumpet in a sacred context in the late 9th century BCE level of the excavation of the Pian di Civita at Tarquinia shows that this symbol, like the axe and shield placed with it, already held a religious, ritual meaning for the Etruscans.3Etruscan priestly costume is illustrated on a number of monuments from the Archaic period and later. As in other cultures, the hat is the most distinctive costume, part of a uniform that marks out the indi-vidual who wears it as belonging to a particular group. Special garments represented in art usually have a special meaning, and this is especially 2 The evidence, published in scattered publications, has recently been collected by Negroni Catacchio 2007.3 Bonghi Jovino 1987, 66–77, pls.

The bronze group of the ploughman from Arezzo in the Villa Giulia Museum was once considered to be a genre piece, though clearly referring to the importance of the plough in Etruscan religion and ritual; the ploughman’s hat was accordingly thought to be worn as a protection against the sun. Emeline Richardson long ago pointed out, however, that the hat marked him out as a priest perform-ing a ritual action.4 Another illustration of the priestly hat occurs on an Etruscan bronze mirror of around 300 BCE, showing a scene of divination (Fig. 49). A youth labeled pavatarchies wears a characteristic priestly hat with a twisted conical top, as he reads a liver before an attentive crowd. Standing beside him is an older man wearing a similar hat; his, however, is shown hanging from a strap around his neck (de Grummond 2006a, 30, fi g. III. 4.).5 A number of bronze statuettes of priests are also shown wearing the hat.6On the Etruscan painted Boccanera plaques in the British Museum, Paris is depicted as a shepherd, wearing a similar soft pointed hat, while Hermes, bringing up the three goddesses to Paris for the contest, wears a kind of hat that becomes a traditional priestly garment, a helmet-like, wide-brimmed hat or pileus topped with a sharp spike, very like some of the early Villanovan spiked helmets.7Fourth-century BCE bronze statuettes of Etruscan haruspices or priests wearing pointed hats also wear animal skin mantles prominently fastened in front with fi bulas or pins of a type that were frequent in Villanovan times (Fig. 50).8 That this was a primitive garment, originally worn in real life, is indicated by the fact that a very similar costume—pointed hat and fringed, animal skin mantle, pinned in front—is worn by a bronze statuette of a Greek shepherd from Arcadia (Bonfante 2003, 51, fi g. 135).

On the Ara Pacis they wear the laena: this, a rounded garment like the toga, is draped with the end thrown in back so that the cloth forms a semicircle in front. This manner of draping it originates with an Etruscan fashion of wearing the rounded mantle, and is in turn the ancestor of the traditional cope of modern priests (Bonfante 1973, 594–595). According to one source the fl amines were infi bulati (Bonfante 2003, 54; Servius, ad Aen. 4, 262), that is, their garments were fastened with fi bulas, large safety pins or brooches. These are not visible on the Roman monuments. A prehistoric origin for such ritual garments and accessories of Roman priests is not surprising. In fact the priestly hat that the fl amines wear with the laena, the galerus, is a helmet-like head covering made of animal skins or leather. Its spike, or apex, which shows that they belong to the highest rank of Roman priesthoods, connects it to an early form of helmet rather than the softer, twisted shape of the hat of the haruspex.10Similar hats are worn by the fi gures of priests reclining on the lids of the small ash urns, of alabaster, stone or terracotta, made in the inland cities of Chiusi, Volterra and Perugia in the Hellenistic period (Turfa 2005, 263–265; de Grummond 2006, 36 fi g. 111.10). An espe-cially moving hand-made urn shows a family scene, with the husband, evidently a priest in his lifetime, as shown by the pointed spike on his hat, bidding farewell to his wife and baby (Haynes 2000, 342 fi g. 269). Some priests on the lids of urns are shown with their mantles pulled up over the heads, in the fashion of the later Roman ritual capite velato.At this moment of their history, Etruscans and Romans share many religious and ritual symbols. This is true of the purple, highly decorated triumphal mantle worn by Vel Saties in the François Tomb of Vulci. It is not a toga picta, because it lacks the toga’s rounded edges; it is the square himation, which may constitute a reference to his heroization after death (Bonfante 2003, 53). Roman men wore in public, and were usually portrayed in the rounded toga that was the Roman costume par excellence. They could however wear the Greek himation in private, 9 Torelli 2000, 278–279, 592–593, Cat.

In Etruscan art, the rectangular himation and rounded tebenna seem to have had quite a different meaning: on the side of a sarcophagus from Vulci in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the mantle with square corners worn by the deceased contrasts with the rounded tebenna of the (presumably live) musicians who accompany him on his journey to the underworld.An Etruscan priest did not appear naked before the divinity, nor when making a libation or taking part in a sacrifi ce. He had the choice of wearing one of several garments designed to cover the male sex: appearing in Etruscan art are fi tted short pants or perizomata, loincloths, and simple pieces of cloth draped around the body (Bonfante 2003, 19–29). Even a divinity was not exempt from covering his nakedness when taking part in a religious ritual: on a mirror showing Hercules and Minerva carrying out a sacrifi ce at an altar, Hercules has modestly draped his lion skin around his loins.11 Other images show him wear-ing a rectangular garment wrapped around his waist like an apron. This costume, clearly meant for ritual, religious occasions, is found on a number of Etruscan statuettes, and is the ancestor of the Roman apron-like limus.12 The handsomest example of a fi gure wearing such a garment is the bronze statuette from Monte Guragazza in Bologna, dating from the early 5th century BCE (Fig. 51). A cloth with fi nely decorated rounded borders is wrapped around his waist and left fore-arm, and covers his legs down to his knees. He is making a libation to the god with the patera in his right hand, while his other hand is held out in a gesture of worship (Bonfante 2003, 50 fi g. 123).Female Ritual DressA peculiarly Etruscan feature of a representation of the draped apron-like garment occurs on the handle of a 4th century BCE Praenestine cista depicting a couple carrying off the body of a dead warrior.

The man has a bare torso; the woman wears it on top of her chiton, which is provided with the tassels that mark the high rank of Etruscan women in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. This parallel way of dressing for the couple of man and woman is unique, though not surprising in the context of Etruscan society, and of the closely related Praenestine art. Just as unique is the subject of the group, in which a man and a woman carry off the corpse, rather than two men, or the two mythological male fi gures of Death and Sleep (Fig. 52).13The lid of a full-size Etruscan sarcophagus in the British Museum, dating from a somewhat later period, shows a priestess of Dionysos with the attributes of a follower of the god: an ivy-topped thyrsus, a two-handled cup or kantharos, and a fawn at her side (Fig. 53). She is barefoot, richly attired with jewelry and headdress, and from her shoulder hangs the braid or tassel worn by goddesses and elite women of a previous generation (de Grummond 2006, 38–39, fi g. III.14. For the tassel, Bonfante 2003, 39). The kantharos, a typically Etruscan shape of bucchero cup, was widely exported all over the Mediterranean in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE, and had become a standard attribute of the god Dionysos in Greek iconography.The costume of Roman priestesses, like that of the priests, preserved features of earlier fashions. The dress and hairstyle of the important Roman public priesthood of the Vestal Virgins resembled the ritual dress of brides. Both wore a special hairstyle derived from an Archaic Etruscan hairstyle, the tutulus. Although the word was sometimes used to refer to a melon-shaped hat, it is clear from the descriptions of the antiquarians that it was in fact a sort of chignon made up of braids or strands of hair. A number of Etruscan bronze statuettes of women from the Archaic period clearly illustrate this hairstyle, while others show the outline of this high hairstyle covered by a mantle.14 This tutulus style survived in Roman times as the sex crines hairstyle, worn by the women of the aristocracy in their sacred functions as priestesses and as brides on their wedding day, as a good omen and symbol of chastity.13 Bonfante 2003, fi gs. 87–88.

We have also seen that a number of features of the ritual dress of later Roman priests and priestesses—Salii, fl amines, fl aminica, Vestal Virgins and others—preserved aspects of earlier garments illustrated on artistic monuments from Etruria. This kind of evidence allows us to work back, and reconstruct the appearance and some of the history of certain Etruscan ritual costumes. Although we cannot always be sure that what was ritual dress for the Romans was equally meaningful for the Etruscans, the importance of this symbolic dress caused it to be remembered by Roman poets and antiquarians, to be illustrated in Etruscan and Roman art, and to be placed in the graves of important Etruscan priests, warriors, ‘princes’ and ‘princesses’, and in the sanctuaries of the gods their rituals celebrated.BibliographyBarber, E. 1992.

Statuettes, busts, heads and half-heads portrayed wearing a veil are assumed to symbolise the Roman custom of sacrifi cing with head covered.2 They are therefore widely considered to be proof of the infl uence of Roman religion on non-Roman ritual traditions, and of the presence of Romans, often in the context of colonisation: “proprio l’uso delle teste votive capite velato contraddistinguesse le colonie romane”.3 Elsewhere I have cautioned against the unhesitating acceptance of votive terracottas as evidence of colonisation and Romanisation (Glinister 2006a, 2006b; cf. Gentili 2006). Here, I wish to question the extent to which veiled-head votives, and indeed the veiled sacrifi ce itself, represent uniquely Roman forms of ritual, and to suggest an alternative reading.The tradition of offering heads as votives is thought to originate in the Veientine and Faliscan areas, where they are found from the 5th century BCE. Heads of the same date are also found at Teanum in Campania, and explained by close Etrusco-Campanian relations at that period. From the end of the 5th century BCE they are also attested at Lavinium in Latium, but they do not appear widely across the Etrusco-Latial-Campanian area until the mid 4th century BCE. It is from the 1 I fi rst became interested in Hellenistic votive offerings from reading Jean Turfa’s work on terracottas in healing cults, and quickly came to appreciate the sanity and clear-headedness of her approach to this material, as well as her immense store of knowledge. Subsequently, Jean has provided me with previews of her work, not to mention cat toys; I am grateful for both kindnesses. Thanks also to Robert Coates-Stephens for a crucial offprint.2 E.g. Comella 1982, 33; Söderlind 2002, 381. This is the primary interpretation of veiled-head terracottas, although Fenelli 1989–90, 498 suggested that veiled statues of females from Lavinium could be connected with marriage or matronal status.3 Pensabene 2001, 75 (discussing votives from Piazza Ungheria at Praeneste); cf.

Between the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (when their distribution peaks) veiled heads are found throughout Central Italy. Their spread is commonly attributed to the expansion of Roman power after the conquest of Veii.4The idea that the spread of veiled votive heads symbolises the Romanisation of local ritual practices originates from the observa-tion of Pensabene that veiled heads are commonest at Rome and in territory controlled by Rome, while unveiled heads predominate in southern Etruria and Campania.5 Subsequently scholars have tended to approach the material in the dogmatic belief that this distribution pat-tern points to markedly different religious traditions: a veiled-head votive indicating sacrifi ce according to the so-called Romanus ritus (‘Romanrite’), an unveiled votive indicating (within Etruria) sacrifi ce following a bare-headed Etruscan rite. There are two further assumptions. One, that most of the peoples of Italy, except for the Romans, sacrifi ced bare-headed.6 The other, that the unveiled ritual can be termed Graecus ritus (‘Greek rite’).So these are my questions: is the veiled sacrifi ce really exclusive to Rome? How do the other peoples of Italy sacrifi ce? Does the progres-sive dissemination of veiled heads demonstrate the superimposition of a Roman over an Etruscan sacrifi cial tradition? Do the Etruscans really sacrifi ce ‘Greek-style’? And do pots (or, here, votives) equal people? It will become clear, I hope, how an apparently quite trivial point—whether people covered their heads while sacrifi cing—encom-passes questions of identity, Romanisation, and acculturation.4 E.g. Pensabene 1979, 219; more recently Piraino 2003, 82; Comella 2004, 336.5 Pensabene 1979, 218–19; followed by Comella 1982, 32–33; Söderlind 2002, 369–370, etc. Pensabene and Comella are rather careful in their conclusions and aware of the fragmentary nature of the evidence: surviving votives represent a tiny fraction of what must once have existed. Many are sporadic fi nds; others come from deposits whose contexts went unrecorded, and whose contents have been largely lost or dispersed.6 Contra, however, Ampolo 1992, 340: “romani (ed italici) sacrifi cavano generalmente capite velato”. Note also Pensabene 1979, 218, who comments that the Roman rite “non era circoscritto solo a Roma, ma doveva essere una tradizione comune nel territorio latino e di essa un’eco ci è giunta nell’immagine tradizionale di Enea sacrifi cante con il capo velato”. On Aeneas, see below."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" veiled and unveiled 195I. The Literary EvidenceVeiling at RomeDespite the near-ubiquity of terracotta votives in Italy, not a single ancient author or epigraphic text informs us about the meaning these votive heads had for their dedicants, or the rituals surrounding their deposition. On the other hand, there is abundant literary evidence for the custom of veiling at Rome (see Freier 1963). Typically, sacrifi ce was performed with a fl ap of the toga pulled over the head (e.g. Plut., QR 10). We know from Varro and Festus that both men and women sacrifi ced veiled,7 but iconographic material shows that only the person sacrifi cing covered his or her head; other participants or onlookers might be crowned with a wreath, or entirely bare-headed.The veil was employed on various occasions. Cicero refers to its use in a rite for the consecration of property (Dom. 124). The fetial procedure by which Rome declared war (supposedly copied from the Aequiculi), was undertaken capite velato (Livy 1.32.5–6; cf. Dion. Hal. 2.72.2).8 The sister-killer Horatius was expiated of his bloody crime by passing under a yoke with head veiled (Livy 1.26.13). The devotio, a rare form of voluntary human sacrifi ce, was performed with head covered (Cic., Nat. 2.10, etc.), while both Pompey and Caesar, when their murderers approached, are said to have veiled their heads, an act interpreted by Perea as symbolising their self-sacrifi ce (Perea 1998). The murder of Tiberius Gracchus occurred after the Senate met at the Temple of Fides (in sacrifi ces to whom the fl amines had to veil their arms: Livy 1.21.4, Serv., Aen. 1.292); we are told that their leader, the pontifex maximus Scipio Nasica, covered his head with his toga, while the senators wrapped their togas about their left arms (Plut., Ti. Gracc. 19.3–4; Appian, BC 1.16). In the ver sacrum (sacred spring) the heads of children were veiled to mark a vow to sacrifi ce all living beings born that spring (Paul. Fest. 519.31L). If a Vestal lost her virginity, she was buried alive, completely veiled (Plut., Numa 10.7). A bride’s head was veiled in the regular form of marriage (Paul. Fest. 56.1L), while in the 7 Varro, LL 5.130, Festus 142.20L (with Paul) on the rite of Mutinus Titinus, to whom women customarily sacrifi ced while veiled and wearing the toga praetexta. Ryberg 1955 is the starting point for iconographical evidence, which is widespread.8 See e.g. Penella 1987.

Fest. 201.4L). Plautus (Amph. 1091) tells us that women going into labour invoked the gods capite aperto, for prayers were also said veiled (cf. Ovid, Fasti 3.363). In emulation of such venera-tion, the canny eques Vitellius approached Caligula veiled, fl attering the emperor’s delusions of godhead.10And, of course, priests veiled too. From Livy’s account of the inaugu-ration of Numa we know that augurs acted capite velato.11 The Comitium housed an archaic statue of the augur Attus Navius in action, head veiled, suggesting that the custom was an early one. Other evidence shows that head coverings in general were important to Roman reli-gious specialists from early on.12 State priests had particular forms of headgear, for which there were a range of technical terms. So char-acteristic was the apex (spiked skull-cap draped with a woollen fi llet) of the fl amines that grammarians even derived their name from its fi lum (Paul. Fest. 77.28L).13 The fl amen Dialis could not leave home unless wearing his albogalerus (Gell., NA 10.15.17), which meant, among other things, that he was unable to participate in Saturn’s unveiled sacrifi ce. The Vestals wore the suffi bulum when they sacrifi ced, the fl aminicae wore veils with names such as rica and ricinia. When the fl aminica Dialis put on her fl ame-coloured veil, she was described as cincta (usually meaning ‘girded’: Paul. Fest. 82.6L, 57.3L).Cinctus was also the term applied to the form of dress supposedly specifi c to Roman sacrifi ce, the cinctus Gabinus, a way of draping the toga so that part was wound round the waist and tied in front of the body (leaving the left arm free), and part covered the head.14 It was 9 Serv., Aen. 4.374. See Linderski 2005, 233, n. 19.10 Suet., Vitel. 2.5; contrast Plut., QR 10, who reports that Romans ordinarily hon-oured men by unveiling.11 Livy 1.18.6–10, 1.36.5, 10.7.10; Plut., Numa 7.2; Dion. Hal. 3.71.5; Frier 1963, 77–83. The augur from the Lapis Niger votive deposit at Rome (Antiquarium Forense, Rome, inv. 885, c. 550 BCE) is unveiled, as are Etruscan examples, but our sources make it clear that the veil is assumed only at the point of action.12 Roofed and unroofed structures also held technical importance in Roman reli-gious contexts. Some gods had to be worshipped out of doors, or, if indoors, under an opening in the roof (e.g. Terminus: Ovid, Fasti 2.671–72). Certain things could not be covered: sacella were always unroofed, according to Festus 422.15L.13 Note that Etruscan priests are also portrayed wearing an apex, suggesting the importance of headcovering in that context also. See Maggiani 1989.14 Cato, Origines 1.18aC; Serv., Aen. 7.712; Isid., Etym. 19.24.7. See Wilson 1924, 86–88.

Max. 1.1.11), and by Decius Mus when he devoted himself in order to secure a victory in 340 BCE (Livy 8.9.5, 9; 10.7.3). Dressed in this manner the consul formally declared war, while an army set for battle was described as procincta classis.15 The Roman people seem to have worn the cinctus Gabinus during purifi catory rites—on the instructions of an Etruscan vates according to Lucan (BC 1.584–638). This form of dress took its name from Gabii, a Latin town taken over by Rome during the archaic period.16 If the style of dress really could be connected to the town, it would show that Latins as well as Romans sacrifi ced veiled, but at the very least, the implication is that the Romans believed that the Gabines did so.17But it must be remembered that Romans did not always veil to sacrifi ce. In a forthcoming work, Valérie Huet shows that in some sacrifi ces by the Roman rite, notably those undertaken by soldiers, the head remained uncovered.18 Paulus Festus 4.1L may imply a female unveiled sacrifi ce when he says that armita was the word for a (Vestal?) virgin sacrifi cing, “with the fl ap of her toga fl ung back over her shoul-der” (lacinia togae in humerum erat reiecta). And, as is well known, Romans sacrifi ced unveiled on many occasions according to the so-called Graecus ritus (below).Modern scholars use Romanus ritus to mean the ‘typically Roman’ veiled sacrifi ce, but this is a rare antique term, and probably not strictly technical.19 There is almost no direct reference to the custom of veiling at sacrifi ce in which the term is used. Gellius (NA 13.23.1) merely men-tions that prayers “offered according to the Roman ritual” are recorded in ancient priestly books. Varro is the only author to connect the term with veiled sacrifi ce, noting that rica (veil) is derived from ritus, “because 15 Virgil, Aen. 7.612; Holland 1961, 64; Paul.

Not only did the Latins share Roman institutions, such as the Vestals, Salii and fl amines, but the existence of federal shrines offers a strong argument for shared sacrifi cial rites. Amongst other evidence, we also have Livy’s report of the Praenestine survivor of Hannibal’s siege of Casilinum (216 BCE) who set up a statue, head covered, with an inscription that he had paid his vow on behalf of the garrison there (23.19.18).18 See Huet (forthcoming); Prescendi 2004a, 193–94.19 Examples: Varro, LL 7.88; Cic., De Nat.

Sacrifi cing upon arrival in Italy, he glimpsed the approach of a hostis (originally meaning ‘foreigner’ rather than ‘enemy’).22 That he might complete the ritual without interruption, Aeneas drew his toga over his head, a practice followed ever after.The story was circulating widely during the fi rst centuries BCE/CE. The source for the Origo Gentis Romanae seems to be Octavius Hersennius, author of De Sacris Saliaribus Tiburtium (probably late Republican); that for Macrobius is Gavius Bassus, probably writing in the Ciceronian period (Sat. 3.6.17). Versions appear in Virgil (Aen. 3.403–409; cf. Serv., Aen. 8.288), Dionysius of Halicarnassus (a source for Plutarch), Strabo, and Festus (following Verrius Flaccus).23 A panel on the Ara Pacis may also celebrate Aeneas as auctor of the Romanus ritus (Ampolo 1992, 340).The deity and location (never Rome) vary from author to author, but in all the act of veiling remains standard, and Aeneas faces a Greek hostis. The context is Greek versus Trojan, as the earliest form of sacri-fi cial rite at Rome was thought to be ‘Greek’ (see below), but there is no hint that here ‘Greek’ implies ‘Etruscan’. No specifi c contrast is ever 20 Varro, LL 5.130: Sic rica ab ritu, quod Romano ritu sacrifi cium feminae cum faciunt, capita velant. The rica is described by Festus 342.27 and 368.3L as the headdress of the fl aminicae. Cf. Flemming 2007.21 A similar deliberate obliviousness occurs in the augural procedure: Cic., De Div. 2.71–72.22 Paul. Fest. 91.7L. In certain rites (we do not know which) the lictor proclaimed: “hostis, vinctus, mulier, virgo exesto” (“away with the hostis, prisoner, woman, girl!”), prohib-iting their presence (Paul. Fest. 72.10L). Aeneas’ hostis was either Diomedes (e.g. Plut., QR 10, Serv., Aen. 3.407) or Ulysses (Festus 430.30L, OGR 12.2); Dion. Hal. 12.22 mentions both. In 5th century BCE authors Ulysses is actually paired with Aeneas: according to Hellanicus (FGrH 4 F 84) and Demastes of Sigeion (FGrH 5 F 3) they founded Rome together, a story elaborated by other Greeks, including Lycophron (Alex. 1238ff.). Hesiod, Theog. 1011–13, makes him the father of Latinus.23 Strabo 5.3.5 describes the Latin federal shrines of Aphrodite at Lavinium and Ardea, famous for their connection with Aeneas, “and because of those rites which, it is said, have been handed down from those times”.

Livy, who does not name Aeneas as founder of the Romanus ritus, implicitly stresses its ultimately Latino-Trojan pedigree by using the rare phrase Albanus ritus for the rites established by Romulus—excluding, and specifi cally contrasted with, the Graecus ritus of Hercules.24All in all, a powerful group of sources on the origins of the Roma-nus ritus points to a strong distinction between Italian and Greek (not Etruscan) custom. Varro’s surviving fragments do not include the story of Aeneas’ sacrifi ce, but in speaking of the fl amines he too makes it clear that the practice of veiling was not narrowly Roman (LL 5.84: fl amines, quod in Latio capite velato erant semper ac caput cinctum habebant fi lo, fi lamines dicti, “. . . because in Latium the fl amines always kept their heads cov-ered . . .”). In our other sources, Aeneas is the founder of Latin rather than Roman culture, and of a rite that is Italic rather than uniquely Roman (Ampolo 1992). The veiled sacrifi ce is not seen as an autoch-thonous, indelibly Roman custom. Rather, it predates the foundation of Rome, is later than the unveiled rite, and, like so many of Rome’s religious customs, is at least notionally of foreign origin.25In Festus, sacrifi ce capite velato, and the fear of interruption it sym-bolises, are common to the Italians. His comment that “following the example of Aeneas the Italici veil their heads” (430.30L) cannot be taken to mean Romans alone, for in his lexicon Italici always refers to the peoples of Italy. It is used of the Tusculans and Faliscans (304.33L) and sometimes excludes the Romans (486.32L; cf. Cic., Phil. 8.3). As it happens, while not much is known from archaeological or icono-graphical material about how the peoples of Italy dressed or acted 24 Livy 1.7.3. The only other use of the term occurs in Livy 1.31.1–4, where, after the destruction of Alba Longa, a mysterious voice commands the Albans to celebrate neglected sacrifi ces according to their ancestral rites.25 The tradition that veiled sacrifi ce was later than the unveiled rite may tie in with the fact that many of the earliest votive heads are unveiled (Comella 2004: 337). A general trend from unveiled to veiled is exemplifi ed by heads from Veii and Praeneste (e.g. Pensabene 2001, 69, nos. 126, 127), although it is diffi cult to be precise as the absolute chronology of the votives remains problematic; stylistic criteria are still an important means of dating. The pattern is usually attributed to the spread of the Roman rite, but may indicate wider general developments in cult not directly attributable to Rome or to its colonies (although no one would deny that colonisation had a role to play, by fostering interactions and cultural change). Perhaps the veiled sacrifi ce was adopted as an assertion of Italian in opposition to Greek identity, as suggested by the Aeneas myth."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"200 fay glinisterduring sacrifi ce, the fact that they shared certain sacred practices is confi rmed by parallels in Roman and Italic ritual, such as the use of strues and ferta (offerings, probably cakes), attested at Rome (e.g. Gell., NA 10.15.14) and in the Iguvine Tables (e.g. IIa 18). Importantly, the instauratio (the restaging of rites interrupted as a result of an error or bad omen), common practice at Rome during the Republic, also occurs in the Iguvine Tables.26 If the concept of non-interruption of a ceremony was a concern of Umbrians as well as Romans, that may well point to the wider use of the veil during sacrifi ce.The Graecus ritusAs we have seen, a signifi cant and varied body of evidence confi rms the Roman custom of sacrifi cing veiled on many, but by no means all, occasions. The form of sacrifi ce contrasted with the ‘Roman rite’ is the Graecus ritus, carried out unveiled (aperto capite), as was the norm in the Greek world.27 It was customary at Rome for Saturn, Hercules, Apollo, Honos, and Ceres. Again a relatively rare term (although there are epigraphic attestations too), it fi rst appears in a fragmentary speech of Cato (Orat. 77M = 64C: Graeco ritu fi ebantur Saturnalia). The term itself may not be particularly old (perhaps not earlier than the 3rd century BCE), but the Romans certainly believed that the origins of the rite were incredibly ancient. The cult of Saturn was explained as being Graeco ritu because the god was worshipped in Italy long before Aeneas introduced the veiled sacrifi ce.28 Saturn was thought to have come from Greece to found the earliest settlement on the site of Rome, but the god we know was not Greek, but Latin; Versnel plausibly interprets the bare-headed rite as specifi c to his nature as a god of dissolution.29 26 E.g. Livy 23.30.16–17, 41.16.1–2; Iguvine Tables IIa 1–15, etc. Abaecherli Boyce 1937, 165. Cf. Bloch 1963 and Pfi ffi g 1964, 113–15 on other striking Romano-Umbrian ritual parallels.27 Greeks typically sacrifi ced bare-headed except for a wreath. However Pausanius 6.20.2–3 describes a sanctuary of Eileithyia and Sosipolis on Mount Cronios, where the only person who could enter the latter’s inner sanctum was a priestess, veiled. Llewellyn-Jones 2003 sees veiling as common for Greek women in a domestic context.28 Varro, LL 5.42; Virgil, Aen. 8.358; Ovid, Fasti 6.31; Pliny, NH 3.68; Plut., QR 11; Macrob., Sat. 1.8.2, 3.6.17; Serv., Aen. 3.407. See also Paul. Fest. 106.19L and Festus 462.29L, recording a dispute between the pontifex maximus and a man who refused a priesthood (which, as we saw, involved wearing special headgear) because of claimed family obligations to sacrifi ce unveiled to Saturn.29 Comella 1982, 33–34 (following Pensabene 1979, 218 and Latte 1960, 137) regards Saturn as Etruscan.

Varro ap. Macr., Sat. 1.8.2; Livy 1.7). Hercules’ cult at the Ara Maxima was supposedly performed unveiled because the shrine was founded by the Greek Evander long before Aeneas’ day, although Macrobius also notes that it was to prevent worshippers copying the appearance of the (veiled) cult statue.30 “Of all foreign rites, this was the only one which Romulus adopted”, according to Livy, who contrasts the Greek rite of Hercules with the ‘Alban’ rites established by Romulus for all other deities.31Honos’ unveiled worship is a puzzle to Plutarch (QR 13), but con-nections with the myth of Evander and Hercules may help explain it. Evander’s mother, the prophetess Carmenta, was one of the Camenae, spring deities identifi ed with the Muses.32 Honos must have had some-thing to do with them, for their bronze shrine was temporarily housed in his temple by the Porta Capena before being placed in the aedes of Hercules and the Muses, founded in 187 BCE (Serv., Aen. 1.8). Her-cules and Honos both appear on a denarius struck in 102 BCE by the Marian legate Cornelius Lentulus, and Marius himself built a temple of Honos and Virtus at this time.33 A few decades later, in 70 BCE, Q. Fufi us Calenus issued a denarius with Honos (wreathed) and Virtus on the obverse; on the reverse Roma, her foot resting on a globe, claps the hand of Italia, bearing a cornucopia, an attribute of Honos.

The latter seems to be the case for Apollo (worshipped by the Greek rite follow-ing a prophecy of the seer Marcius in 212 BCE: Livy 25.12.2–15; cf. Macr., Sat. 1.17.28–30) and for Ceres. In her sanctuary this goddess was worshipped Graeco ritu, on some but not all occasions, by priestesses imported from Magna Graecia (Cic., Balb. 55; Scheid 1995: 23–24).Of the many Greek deities at Rome, only Hercules and Apollo are known to have been paid cult regularly with head bare. Others, equally Greek, were worshipped ‘Roman-style’, from Castor, whose cult dates back to the archaic period, to Aesculapius, imported in response to a plague in 291 BCE (Plaut., Curc. 389). However the Sibylline books (supposedly from Magna Graecia) sometimes recommended Greek rituals, and deities could be worshipped according to the Greek rite at lectisternia and supplications. This is attested specifi cally during the ludi saeculares—to which, be it noted, an Etruscan origin is sometimes attributed.35 But as Scheid points out, apart from the fact that the priests acted aperto capite and wore the laurel wreath typical of the Greek act, sacrifi ces Graeco ritu hardly differ from those by the Roman rite. Importantly, there is no suggestion of “different reli gious feeling” in these rites (Scheid 1995, 26–28). In practice the Graecus ritus was merely a mode of performing a ceremony, little different to the Romanus ritus (note especially Dion. Hal. 7.72.14–18), and just as integral a part of Roman Republican religion.36The ritus Etruscus and Etruscan infl uence on RomeThe evidence for Etruscan sacrifi cial practices is scanty and inconclusive. Pictorial representations in Etruscan art are astonishingly few, given the enormous quantity of surviving iconographic material, as well as the reputation of the Etruscans as a people dedicated to the practice 34 Crawford 1974, no. 403, pl. 50.7; Richardson 1978, 245–46.35 The ludi saeculares are known from inscriptions of 17 BCE and 204 CE: Pighi 1965.

Indeed, the assumption that Etruscans sacrifi ced unveiled is regularly associated with the idea that this followed Greek custom. Pautasso expresses the idea forcefully: unveiled heads “rifl ettono la tra-dizione greca del sacrifi cio aperto capite, assimilata nel mondo etrusco”.39 But there is no reason to assume Greek infl uence as the basis for the unveiled sacrifi ce in Etruria, and it is certainly a step too far to label such a practice with the Roman term Graecus ritus.Varro is the only source to draw a direct contrast between the two rites, Greek and Roman, when he mentions that “the haruspex directs the making of each sacrifi ce in its own ritus, and we say that the Board of Fifteen conduct ceremonies in the Greek ritus, not the Roman one”.40 It is only in Varro, too, that we fi nd the term ritus Etruscus, and only in connection with the ritual ploughing by which cities (including Rome) were founded, part of Tages’ Etrusca disciplina.41 At fi rst sight the foun-dation ritual has nothing to do with sacrifi ce, yet the founder wore the cinctus Gabinus—that is, he was veiled. A Roman ritual, performed in a 37 Franchi 1965: 304: “nell’arte etrusca non si incontra nessuna rappresentazione di pompa sacrifi ciale o teoforica”; Livy 5.1.5. Etruscans did certainly veil on some ritual occasions, as shown by scenes of mourning (prothesis) on cippi and plaques, e.g. from Clusium, c. 490 BCE (Louvre inv. MA 3602). See D’Agostino 1989.38 Comella 1982, 33 notes a 5th century BCE Etruscan black fi gure vase (Richter 1940, 38, fi g. 111) and a late 5th–early 4th century BCE Etruscan sovradipinto volute crater (Trendall 1955, 260, Z64, pl. LXVI:a); cf. Donati and Rafanelli, ThesCRA 1 2004, 135–82; the discussion in ThesCRA of Etruscan sacrifi cial costume refers largely to Greek and Roman sacrifi cial dress, theory and terminology. Valérie Huet informs me that out of c. 150 reliefs of sacrifi cial scenes from Rome and Italy, around one third show the sacrifi cer without a veil. The earliest (on the base of Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, Louvre MA 975; Torelli 1982) dates to c. 105 BCE, by which period the custom of dedicating votive heads had largely petered out.39 Pautasso 1994, 23; cf.

At Caere the sacra were “received with the greatest reverence” (cum summa veneratione recepta: Val. Max. 1.1.10). Rituals at the heart of Roman religion were carried on uninterruptedly at Caere itself, by Roman priests, with the willing assistance of the Caeretans.46 Stories like this presuppose common Etrusco-Roman religious concep-tions and sensibilities.II. The Archaeological Material Re-examinedAs we have seen, the consensus of opinion is that veiled heads domi-nate sanctuaries in a Roman, Latin or colonial milieu; by contrast in Campania the majority of votive heads are unveiled, and in Etruria a distinctive ‘Greek’ tradition of unveiled sacrifi ce continues down to a 42 Lucan’s purifi catory procession (BC 1.584–638) also connects the sacred boundary of a city with Gabine dress and with Etruscan ritual.43 Cic., Brut. 56; Serv., Aen. 4.262; Paul. Fest. 104.18L. Note also the statue of Servius Tullius hidden beneath togas (pl.): sed superiniectis quis latet iste togis (Ovid, Fasti 6.570). The laena appears on the Ara Pietatis (Kleiner 1971) and elsewhere; see Samter 1909, 2484–92.44 Lex Col. Genet. 66; Pliny, NH 8. 195, 9.136. The lituus, a curved augural staff, was also considered of Etruscan origin, as according to some authors was the toga itself (Tert., De Pall. 1.1; Serv., Aen. 2.781)—denied by Wilson 1924.45 Beard et al. 1998, 20 question the ‘Etruscan-ness’ of haruspices at Rome, but Wood 1981, 312–13 sees the Etrusca disciplina as the “common cultural patrimony” of Etruria and Latium. ‘Street-corner’ haruspices even interpreted for lower class clients: Plaut., Curc. 483–84.

This picture, drawn from the archaeological material, can now be revised in the light of our exploration of the differing contexts for veiling.In Campania, with its Greek heritage, it is no surprise to see the unveiled sacrifi ce prevail. Even so, veiled heads do occur, in a minor-ity, in 3rd and 2nd century BCE contexts. At Capua, out of around 500 heads dated to the 4th–2nd century BCE (i.e. contemporary with the majority of examples in Latium and Etruria), just over thirty are veiled.Among the Italic peoples, both types of head are to be found, as at Trebula Mutuesca in Sabinum. This became after 290 BCE an area of viritane allotments, whose religious, and probably communal, life centred on an important pre-Roman sanctuary of Feronia. Here, interestingly, the votive heads were deposited (with other offerings) in a special pit around the time the temple was monumentalised (c. 265–240 BCE: Santoro 1987; Tron 1997). The earliest group, 4 veiled heads of the mid 4th century BCE, have far-fl ung parallels: with Teanum, Satricum, Falerii (Vignale), and Lucus Feroniae. A larger group of heads (later 4th–early 3rd century BCE), with and without the veil, can be compared with examples from Lavinium, Carsioli and Lucus Feroniae.47 All of the (early 2nd century BCE) heads from Lucus Feroniae itself are veiled, and in general the few fi nds from other Falisco-Capenate sites also point to the veiled sacrifi cial rite,48 a conclusion supported by Festus (410.6L). He records a Faliscan festival called Struppearia “because they walk around wearing wreaths (struppi)”—probably implying that on other occasions worshippers were veiled. We know these centres to have been politically closer to Etruria than to Rome before their conquest (Cornell 1995, 313), yet like Veii they do not follow the broad Etruscan pattern of unveiled dedications.In Latium some sites, such as Frascati and Ardea (Pescarello), have only veiled heads, and elsewhere, as at Satricum, veiled heads are in 47 On the site, see Reggiani 1987; Alvino 1995. It is hard to know what to make of the prodigy reported by Julius Obsequens 43 for the year 104 BCE: “at Trebula Mutusca a statue in the temple, the head of which had been bare, was found veiled” (simulacrum in templo, quod capite ad<a>perto fuit, opertum inventum). But at Rome one of the reasons given for the bare-headed worship of Hercules, was that the god’s own statue was veiled.48 Söderlind 2002, 370–71, no. 109. The very early heads from Falerii itself are unveiled."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"206 fay glinisterthe majority.49 At Lavinium, of identifi able examples, 103 are veiled and 12 unveiled (out of 232). Nevertheless, even here and in the sup-posed ‘heartland’ of the veiled sacrifi ce, Rome, we fi nd unveiled votive types: at the sanctuary of Minerva Medica, for example, 4 out of 42 are veiled (fi rst half of the 4th to 2nd century BCE). The picture is similar in colonial contexts. At Cales in Campania, where a Latin colony was founded in 334 BCE, both types of ex-voto occur in similar quantities. At Luceria (a Roman colony of 318 BCE) large numbers of veiled heads have been found, but even here unveiled heads form part of the votive repertoire. At Carsioli, established in 298 BCE to control the Aequiculi, a deposit of votive heads, veiled and unveiled, is attested in the colony itself,50 and another 3 km away in a pre-Roman sanctuary which continued to fl ourish after the conquest. The heads from the latter shrine are dated stylistically between the 5th–3rd century BCE; of identifi able examples, 144 are veiled but another 84 are unveiled, or else wear a special pointed hood (Marinucci 1976). If Romans and Latins are distinguished by sacrifi ce capite velato, why do veiled and unveiled types in whatever quantities exist together in Latin, Roman and colonial contexts? Who, are we to imagine, dedicated those heads?The situation in Etruria is perhaps not so markedly different as some-times thought. Etruscan sites with only unveiled heads, as at Ghiaccio Forte in the Albegna valley, are comparatively unusual (Del Chiaro 1976, 22–25). Elsewhere veiled heads do exist in Etruscan centres, being found at Bomarzo (predominantly veiled), S. Giuliano, Vulci, Marsiliana d’Albegna (S. Sisto), and Veii.Veii is important, because the origins of the votive head type are to be sought here, and the city’s conquest was evidently a landmark in the spread of these ex-votos (Comella 1982, 39). Both veiled and unveiled heads are found here; in fact some of the oldest, pre-colonial, female heads (late 5th-early 4th century BCE) are veiled.51 Perhaps Veii before its conquest shared with Rome the veiled sacrifi ce, as it shared 49 An unusually large terracotta female statuette has a bare head: Bouma 1996, 291 fi g. 18.b.

In the Porta Caere deposit, also 2nd century BCE, the majority of heads (24 of 27) are again veiled.53 Statuettes of Aeneas carrying Anchises found at Veii have been interpreted as evidence of colonists worshipping here, but there is no reason to assume that these or the veiled head votives were dedicated solely by Roman incomers.54 Many Veientines still inhabited the area, as well as Capenates and Faliscans, all granted land and Roman citi-zenship alongside settlers from Rome (Livy 5.30.8, 6.4.4). Most likely, then, Veii’s Hellenistic-period sanctuaries show colonists and indigenes participating in shared cults.55Another southern Etruscan city, Caere, enjoyed phases of close political co-operation with Rome, and supported Rome not Veii dur-ing the fi nal struggle between those cities. Livy refers to connections between Roman and Caeretan nobles towards the close of the 4th century BCE which involved the education of Roman boys at Caere; another anecdote implies that Caeretans were serving with the Roman army fi ghting Etruscan Rusellae in 302 BCE (9.36.2–4, 10.4.8–10). As we saw, Caere also had a close religious relationship with Rome (Cor-nell 1995: 320–22). By the mid 4th century BCE, south Etruria was pretty fi rmly under Roman domination, and a series of colonies were established here: Castrum Novum in 264 BCE, Alsium in 247 BCE, Fregenae in 245 BCE, Pyrgi c. 194 BCE, Graviscae in 181 BCE. Despite being strongly affected by Roman colonisation in its territory, at Caere the so-called Etruscan tradition of the unveiled head was “conservata tenacemente”, according to Comella (1982, 39). At Caere’s Manganello 52 See Cornell 1991, 14–15 on the “epigraphic profi le” and funerary practices of Veii, “quite unlike that of the other cities of southern Etruria . . . [but] remarkably similar to the pattern found in Rome and Latium”.53 Vagnetti 1971, Torelli and Pohl 1973, Comella and Stefani 1990.54 E.g. Villa Giulia inv. 40272 from Veii, Campetti sanctuary (one of several examples). Torelli 1973, 335–36 notes prototypes in Attic vase painting, and connects the statuettes to Roman colonists at Veii after 386 BCE, dating them on technical and stylistic grounds to the 4th century BCE (others date them to the 5th).55 Comella and Stefani 1990, 214f.

Another strong indicator that ritual rather than ethnicity was the primary factor in the choice of terracottas comes from the fact that in some deposits there is a gender bias. At the Vignaccia sanctuary, virtually all the surviv-ing heads are female (late 4th–early 3rd centuries BCE).56 Among the votives from Caere in the Museo Gregoriano (5th–4th century BCE) more female heads than male are veiled (one out of 16 male, 5 out of 22 female veiled heads: Comella 1982, 36).Although in other Etruscan centres veiled heads gradually become more common, hardly any have been found at Tarquinii, a city which seems to have held a special place in Etruscan religious life. The Ara della Regina temple was one of the largest in Etruria. Its origins encompassed a strange 9th century BCE burial of an epileptic (vision-ary?) child, possibly connected with the myth of Tages, the divine creature who imparted knowledge of divination to the Etruscans, and with Tarchon, eponymous founder of Tarquinii, and the fi rst haruspex. Early imperial inscriptions document an abiding interest in Etruscan traditions, one listing heads of the ordo LX haruspicum, beginning perhaps with Tarchon (Torelli 1975). Tarchon also seems to have been selected to personify Tarquinii on a 1st century CE Caeretan relief: holding a scroll, he veils his head with his toga (de Grummond 2006, 203).Out of 234 votive heads from the Ara della Regina temple, only 11 are veiled.57 No veiled heads at all have been found at the Porta Urbica sanctuary. New, unveiled, archetypes were produced by Tar-quinian workshops through the 2nd century BCE, and the dedication of unveiled votives continued almost until the tradition itself died out in the early 1st century BCE (Comella 1982, 39). Söderlind sees all this as evidence for “exclusively Etruscan partic ipation” in cult here, even after the Roman conquest, arguing that the shrines avoided Romanisation 56 Nagy 1988. Statuettes by contrast comprise both male and female examples. Firm conclusions depend on studies of well-excavated larger deposits. The Vignaccia deposit, some 6,000 votives, was broken up for sale. Nagy’s Lowie Museum collection comprises only around 800 items. Again, some of the earlier Caeretan heads are veiled: note Comella 2004, 337, nos 72 (mid 5th century BCE) and 74 (Vignaccia, fi rst half of the 4th century BCE).57 They come not from the temple itself, but from a nearby shrine (or storeroom), and are dated from the second half of the 4th to the beginning of the 1st century BCE. Most were produced locally (Comella 1982, 225–26), although some veiled heads were imported from Tuscania (Söderlind 2002, 377)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" veiled and unveiled 209because the city was never colonised (2002, 374, 377, 381). Even so, by the 1st century BCE Tarquinii had long been subjugated, and had a colony on its coastline at Graviscae. Rome itself was no great distance, at around 80 km away quite near enough for infl uences to percolate over the course of centuries, and for Romans to visit and worship here. And given Tarquinii’s importance as a haruspical centre, and the fact that Rome regularly called upon haruspices for advice, we might expect more ‘evidence’ of a Roman presence in its sanctuaries in the form of veiled-head votives—if the veiled head was indeed a defi ning feature of the Roman religious experience.At Tarquinii and Caere, then, veiled heads are rare. Yet these cities were relatively close to Rome, and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, the period when votive heads were so ubiquitous, southern Etruria was politically dependent on Rome. How could these cities have escaped Roman infl uence? Why do we fi nd so few examples of the ex-votos alleged to symbolise a Roman presence and a ‘typically Roman rite’, in what ought to be one of the most Romanised parts of Etruria? The explanation for the persistence of the unveiled votive types must be that those particular cults required the unveiled form of sacrifi ce of all worshippers. And, given that veiled heads do spread across other parts of Etruria, it would seem that this requirement was not necessarily in force elsewhere.A rather different scenario emerges from the thoughtful case study by Martin Söderlind of another Etruscan sanctuary, at Tessennano in the territory of Vulci.58 The votives found at this rural shrine were mostly produced at Tuscania and are dated after Vulci’s conquest (280 BCE). The majority of the heads are veiled (particularly in the 2nd century BCE), but there are signifi cant numbers of unveiled heads (45 out of 174), regarded by Söderlind as the offerings of the surviving Etruscan inhabitants according to their own unveiled rite. The veiled heads were adapted from unveiled types, the veil being added by hand.59 Assuming 58 Söderlind 2002; other fi nds from the shrine (which seems to have a pre-Roman phase also) were studied by Costantini 1995.59 Söderlind 2002, 375–77 regards this as an example of local artisans meeting “the new demand for heads with velum presented by the colonists”, supplying products for a “foreign religious practice”. But what input did consumers have in the typology of the votive? To what extent were coroplasts responding to the demands or expecta-tions of their customers, to what extent fostering them? And is the veiled head really representative of a ‘foreign’ practice, when literary (and much archaeological) evidence points to Etruscans and Romans using essentially the same forms of ritual?"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"210 fay glinisterthat the veil represents the Roman sacrifi cial rite, and noting the pres-ence of centuriation in the region, Söderlind believes their dedicants to be mostly Roman colonists rather than Romanised Etruscans.60 Even alongside evidence such as centuriation, however, the iconography of a votive cannot be used to identify ‘ethnic Roman’ worshippers. Instead, rather than proving the ethnicity of a votary, a veiled or unveiled head records the type of rite performed—by whom, we cannot tell.61III. ConclusionsAt fi rst sight, the case for the traditional argument seems compelling. Veiled-head votives represent worshippers in the act of sacrifi ce, in a manner known to be employed by Romans. They increase over the cen-turies as Roman power over Italy grows in turn, and are characteristic of Roman and colonial settings. This interpretation, however, is based on the simple premise that Romans alone sacrifi ced with head veiled.62 In fact a tradition of veiled sacrifi ce seems certain for the Latins, and can probably be extended more widely among the Italic peoples. The evidence for Etruria is inconclusive, but it is unlikely that the Etruscans exclusively sacrifi ced unveiled;63 indeed our sources believed that rites 60 Söderlind 2002, 369, 371, 380–81. The lower levels of society whom he regards as the dedicants of these votives were not “recep tive enough to rapidly absorb reli-gious traditions from their conquerors at a long distance”, but only if living alongside colonists (377)—yet these were offerings made over several centuries, only 100 km from Rome.61 There is an interesting coda in Söderlind’s history of votive heads at Tessennano. The 2nd century BCE sees growing social differentiation in the region, with small-holdings contracting in size, and more villa-estates belonging to colonists turned over to large-scale agriculture. Intensifi ed production of votive heads is accompanied by a decline in quality; they become the preserve of “marginalized smallholders”. Large landowners reject their “former colonial/plebeian identity, closely connected with the use of terracotta votives of Etrusco-Latial-Campanian type”. In other words, the very group which supposedly introduced the terracottas was no longer using them (Söderlind 2002, 91–92, 95–96, 382–83, 389–91).62 One of the great debates of early Roman history has been the degree to which Rome was infl uenced, or indeed, controlled, by Etruscans. Most scholars see Rome as under Etruscan domination during the archaic period (contra, Cornell 1995). How can we then confront, only a century after the expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus, an ethni-cally-defi ned ‘Rome’ with a pure and distinctively Roman religious culture, which can be identifi ed here there and everywhere merely by the presence of a votive head?63 Except perhaps at certain shrines such as the Ara della Regina, whose gods demanded this form of cult to the exclusion of all others."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" veiled and unveiled 211which involved veiling (augury for instance) were of Etruscan origin, and in their discussions of the origin of the Roman sacrifi cial rite, the contrast highlighted was Roman/Greek, not Roman/Etruscan.Well before Augustus’ tota Italia, in fact as far back as our evidence stretches, Rome had embraced foreign cults, brought them into the heart of the city physically and metaphorically, and celebrated their foreignness. Procedures developed to incorporate foreign deities into the Roman pantheon, via the Sybilline Books or the practice of evocatio, the luring to Rome of a deity from a besieged city. Similar procedures must have operated outside Rome, and so we should expect Romans or colonists participating in existing local cults to worship according to existing cult modalities—that is, by unveiled sacrifi ce if such was the local tradition.64 Both rites were thus probably used contemporaneously, as was the case at Rome. The signifi cance of the veil lay in the nature of the ritual required, and so the same worshipper could use a different mode of sacrifi ce—depending on the god, on a particular festival, even on a single specifi c moment of a festival.65 All this is refl ected in the surviving votive forms.Finally, let us turn the archaeological evidence on its head. Observe how many unveiled heads come from Roman or purportedly Romanised contexts (including colonies),66 and how many veiled heads are found in areas where a Greek-style rite is supposed to prevail. It immediately becomes clear that the veiled sacrifi ce is not an exclusively Roman practice, nor a clear marker of ethnic identity. And why should it be? In the ritual traditions of Central Italy we are confronted by different dialects of the same religious language. The cultural koine demonstrated for the Hellenistic period by Etrusco-Latial-Campanian votives existed 64 At Rome, ‘foreign’ cults were supposedly practised according to the custom of the people of origin: Festus 268.27L.65 Note Lucus Feroniae, where all the heads are veiled, even though this was a common shrine for Latins, Capenates, Sabines and others. Söderlind (2002, 371) expects a mixture of types, representative of the ethnicity of the individual worship-pers, but if we abandon ethnic preconceptions, the presence of veiled heads can be readily explained.66 Note also that veiled-head votives are not an invariable feature of colonies; nor were all colonists Romans, practising Roman customs. Various conquered peoples became eligible to enlist in colonies, and recent scholarship has also emphasised the inclusion of indigenes: Crawford (forthcoming); Bradley 2005; cf. on incolae Gagliardi 2006. Roman ideology itself promoted the idea that Roman culture was permeable to external infl uences, so there was no reason for colonies even to attempt to operate as hermetic entities."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"212 fay glinisterbefore the Roman conquest,67 and that conquest did not create, but reinforced, a culture that was already in many ways syncretic and hybridised.68BibliographyAbaecherli Boyce, A. 1937. “The expiatory rites of 207 BC.” TAPA 68: 157–71.Alvino, G. 1995.

Bouke van der MeerThe famous Linen Book with the longest Etruscan text (hereafter LL), also known as the Mummy Wrappings of Zagreb, was found in Egypt.1 There it was once cut into eight strips, fi ve of which have been partially preserved, as they were used for wrapping the mummy of a rich, young lady. The linen is dated between c. 425 and 375 BCE according to C14-research, but the writing has to be dated between the end of the 3rd century and c. 150 BCE.2 The textile seems to be of Etruscan, not of Egyptian manufacture.3A scribe who was active in a North Etruscan region near Umbria, probably in or near Perugia, wrote the text, as some words and names are only testifi ed there. Cortona may be excluded as the typical local, reversed letter E is absent. Judged by the many spelling variations, it seems likely that the writer fi rst worked in Southern Etruria, in Tar-quinia or its region and later in Northern Etruria. The Liber Linteus has been classifi ed as a funerary ritual book in the past but nowadays it is usually labelled as a ritual calendar, although months are men-tioned only from column 6 onwards: acale ‘in June’ in column 6, θucte ‘in August’4 and celi ‘in September’ in column 8. However, we cannot rule out that dates before June were mentioned in the lost strips of the fi rst fi ve columns. Probably the LL was a liber ritualis, in view of the frequent formula: śacnicleri cilθl śpureri meθlumeric enaś (or a similar, 1 For the LL text see H. Rix (ed.), ET II, 1–8; for colour photographs of the LL see Roncalli 1985 (with a transcription which is out of date since 1991). For technical and practical reasons I use the conventional rendering of the Etruscan letters s and ś instead of Rix’s complicated system.2 See the numerous articles dealing with many aspects of the LL in VAMZ 1986 and 1987.3 I thank Margarita Gleba for her observation that the linen of the LL does not show spinning in s-direction, which is typical for Egyptian linen.4 For thucte = ‘in August’, see Rix 1986, 17–40."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"218 l. bouke van der meershorter formula), probably meaning ‘for the sacred fraternity/priest-hood (śacnica)5 of the citadel (cilθ), for the city state (śpura) and for the city (meθlum)6 of ena (of whomsoever).’The word ena has often been interpreted as a name of an unknown city. Steinbauer translates enaś as ‘of today’ (supposed genitive of an adverb ena).7 However, thanks to a 5th century BCE inscription cut over a large niche in a tomb near Chiusi, published and translated by Enrico Benelli, reading ein θui ara enan, which means ‘not here make > lay down whomsoever’, it is almost certain that ena is an indefi nite pronoun meaning: whoever.8 Benelli suggests that the LL was made for and used by a community on the move, eventually to Egypt.It does seem likely that the LL represents more than an offer- and prayer-calendar. Signifi cant is the presence of the words trutanaśa, truθ, truθt, truθur and trut(um).9 Trut- is akin to the root of the title trutnvt in the bilingual inscription of Pesaro in Umbria (Um 1.7):[L.

III.15). As Cicero (Cic.

The presence of words like trut- implies that, apart from instructions for one or more offerings to a god or gods on a certain day, the LL text contains other elements referring to activities of soothsayers.The structure of the LL text is as follows. Column 1 (‘page 1’) must have contained the colophon, in view of the twice occurring verbal form zichri: ‘(this) has to be written’, a unique command as some inscriptions mention verbal forms such as ziχunce (‘(x) has written’) in the archaic festival calendar of the Tabula Capuana (c. 470 BCE), right at the end 5 Rix 1991b, 682–683.6 Colonna 1988, 15–36.7 Steinbauer 1999, 417.8 Benelli 1998 (2001), 221–224.

Finally, in column 12, the ‘fi nal page’, the aiser śeu are mentioned again and at the very end there is a clear topographical indication: unialti ursmnal (‘in the (sanctuary) of uni urmsnai’) that is the Etruscan Juno, in this case protective god of a gens or family Ursmna(i). The aiser śeu, fl ere in crapśti, and neθuns each have a farθan (genius, progenitor). The translation ‘genius’ is a discovery of G. Colonna (1980, 161–79). It is based on a funerary inscription Vc 1.64 reading: . . . anc farθnaχe veluis tuteis . . . (‘(and) who was generated by Vel Tute’).The lexeme farθans (genitive of farθan: ‘of/for Farthan’) is further only known from a bronze, 4th century BCE simpulum, found at the bottom of a pit in the northern sanctuary of Uni and Thesan at Pyrgi.11 Its engraved representation shows a Silenus head with clear characteristics of Medusa: snake hair and extended tongue. It seems therefore that farθan is a Dionysiac, bisexual, (re)generative force of life and death. Therefore, possibly the three farθan’s are one and the same supergod.The rites in honour of Nethuns are partly similar to those in col-umns 2–5.So the text shows a certain symmetry; the columns before column 6.14 (see below) refer to months before the 18th of June, the columns 8–12 to August and September and possibly to later months.Under the red division line under column line 6.8 (under the words iχ. śacnicla) evidently a new paragraph begins. The following lines 6.9–13 (partly quoted) read: zaθrumsne. lusaś. fl er. hamφisca. θezeri . . . . . . . . . . . . .thunsna. thuns. fl ers which can be translated as: ‘on the 20th for Lusa a sacrifi cial victim, that of hamφis (‘right’?), has to be presented/slaugh-tered . . . . . . the fi rst part (?) of the fi rst victim.’ Lusa is a goddess, twice inscribed as lvsl (genitive), in a marginal and in an inner region of the 10 Cristofani 1995, 58 (Tabula Capuana, (fi nal) line 62).11 Colonna 1970, 61–62, no. 42, tav. 20. Colonna 1971, 372 interprets this farthan as a genius loci (cf. pater Pyrgensis)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"220 l. bouke van der meerBronze Liver of Piacenza, in the latter case together with velχ(ans)/Vul-canus. Unfortunately no month is mentioned in line 6.9. It could be the 20th of June, in which case it anticipates the 18th of June in 6.14 (a similar anticipation occurs also in column 11) or 20th May, as the following passage is written between blank spaces of 2 or 3 lines (cf. 8.1–2: only two lines refer to the 13th of August, also written between blank spaces). But as Lvsa on the Liver resides in the exact east (region 4) and, diametrically, in the exact west (near region 12, together with velχ/Vulcanus),12 it is more likely that the date is the 20th of March, a date very near the vernal equinox. The offer of a fi rstling (θunsna θuns fl ers) seems to confi rm my hypothesis.As is known from Martianus Capella’s description of a—partially Etruscan—heaven,13 Lynsa silvestris, who may be identical to Lvsa, lives with Mulciber (again Vulcanus!) in region 4, near the exact east in Martianus’ 16–partite heaven. Who was Lusa/Lvsa? Martianus Capella’s characterization implies that she is a goddess of the woods (silvestris). This interpretation has been contested by Capdeville (1996, 287). According to the present author, Lvsa’s nature can be deduced from 3rd century BCE coins from Malaca (in Spain), which are imita-tions of Populonian coins, with one side showing Velch(ans)/Vulca-nus, without inscription but armed with his attributes, the other side showing a female (?) head with an aureole (Maggiani 1992, 179). This combination of two deities may indicate that Velchans’ partner is a light goddess, which is understandable in view of her position along the cardinal east-west axis.Column 6.14–17 obviously refers to activities in June. Column 6.14 reads: eslem. zaθrumiś. acale. tinś. in. śarle . . . . which can be translated as: ‘on the 18th of June (acale) for Tin who (is) in *śarla (in the 10th (place ?)) . . .’ The date is of special interest as it comes only three days before the summer solstice on the 21st of June.It becomes still more striking as column 8.3 (after a blank space under line 8.1–2: 13th August) mentions: celi. huθiś. zaθrumiś. fl erχva. neθunsl . . . which means: ‘On the 24th of September sacrifi cial victims for Nethuns . . .’ This date comes very near the autumnal equinox, on 22nd September.12 van der Meer 1987, 24, fi g. 14; 150, fi g. 69.13 De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercvrii (I. 48)."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" on the enigmatic deity lur in the LIBER LINTEUS ZAGRABIENSIS 221Finally, in column 12.10 we read: θunem. cialχuś. masn. unialti. urs-mnal . . . which can be translated as: ‘On the 29th (a) mas(a)n (an offer-ing) in the sanctuary of the Urs(i)m(i)nian Uni . . .’ In column 11.f4, just preceding the last column 12, satr (Saturnus) is mentioned. As the Roman Saturnalia took place on 17th December, part of column 11 and column 12 may relate to December. In that case the 29th is seven days later than the winter solstice on 22nd December.The dates mentioned differ respectively one, two, three and seven days from the four important seasonal moments, the beginnings of spring, summer, autumn and winter.14 The discrepancy may be due to Etruscan calendar systems. The LL text does not mention more than 29 days. A brontoscopic calendar, written by P. Nigidius Figu-lus around 50 BCE and handed down by Johannes Lydus, De ostentis 27–38 (6th century CE) mentions twelve months of 30 days, curiously starting with June and ending with May (Turfa 2006, 173–190).15 As there were 12 months each counting 29 or 30 days at most, the two calendars had respectively 348 and 360 days, so 17 to 5 days less than our year of 365 days. This may have led to incidentally adding days to the calendar.A fi nal indication for an all encompassing seasonal order of the LL text is that Nethuns, god of the waters, is not mentioned before column 8, most probably because he was associated with autumnal rains after the hot, dry summer. Apart from the main gods mentioned above, there are also minor ones, who are subordinated to them. One of them is Lur, an enigmatic deity, mentioned in column 5 and perhaps in column 6.I will fi rst cast some light on the character of column 5. After the pro quo formula śacnicleri . . . in 5.6–7, an offer has to be made to the farθan aiseraś śeuś (‘the Genius of the śeu gods’). The character of this collective can be deduced from 5.19–20:nunθen. θesan. tinś. θesan aiseraś. śeuś . . .‘invoke/offer to Thesan of Tin (and) to Thesan of the śeu gods’14 The culścva (gates-) rite on 13th August in LL 8.1–2 and the Roman Portunalia on 17th August differ four days; see Rix 1986, 17–40.15 The text looks like Mesopotamian divination texts with the well-known ‘if then’ formulas. A year beginning with June is unparalleled in Etruria and in Mesopotamia. The festival calendar of the archaic Tabula Capuana starts with March; see Cristofani 1995, 60–61."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"222 l. bouke van der meerThe goddess Thesan can be identifi ed as Eos/Aurora on iconographic grounds. Therefore Thesan Tins must mean Aurora of Tin ( Jupiter). The word tin, however, can also mean ‘day’. This implies that Thesan Tins is the goddess of light of Jupiter/day and by consequence Thesan Aiseras Seus may mean Thesan of the dark/night/underworld gods. The latter Thesan may be an evening star. We know that Etruscan divinities can have a double, opposite or even plural character. For example, a similar deity, Cath(a), is mentioned twice on the Bronze Liver of Piacenza, once in the pars familiaris and once in the pars hostilis (van der Meer 1987, 24–25, fi g. 24).16The double meaning of the word θesan is also illustrated by a 4th century BCE mirror from Orbetello, showing the male Sun god on a triga below and again in a boat above, evidently summarizing his voyage above the earth during the day and on the sea during the night (van der Meer 1987, 50, fi g. 20). The didaskalion in scriptio continua reads: caθesan, clearly meaning ‘this (is) θesan’. It cannot be the god-dess Thesan as the traveller is one and the same man, the Sun. In other words ‘this (is) sunrise/sunset’ is a better translation. Therefore I reject Colonna’s hypothesis that cathesan would be *cathe sans (‘Cathe father’). Moreover, Cathe does not exist.If the epithet śeu is akin to Latin Seja/Seia and seges (‘sowing’), the aiser śeu can be compared with Demeter and Persephone, goddesses of fertility and the underworld. These Greek deities, also mentioned as ‘the two gods’, were already known, alone or together, in the Etruscan world from the 6th century BCE onwards, according to Greek inscriptions in the sanctuaries at Gravisca and the southern sanctuary at Pyrgi. If my interpretation is correct, the double presence of Thesan can refer to the vernal equinox of the 20th of March, the beginning of spring (see above, column 6.9: zaθrumsne: ‘on the 20th’). The eiser. śic. śeuc (śi-c śeu-c) in column 5.10 and 5.14 are the śi gods and the śeu gods, in all probability dei superi and dei inferi. The double conjunction -c (cf. Lat. -que) is also present in 10.f1 θapnac θapnzac (‘both a dish and a small dish’), and Cr 5.2 apac atic (‘both father and mother’).In column 5.21–2 we read the following words: . . . cisum. θesane. uslanec mlaχe luri. zeric. . . ., which may mean: ‘. . . . . a threefold thing (probably a libation) at sunrise and at noon for nice Lur and Zer . . .’17 The lexeme 16 Martianus Capella mentions her as Celeritas solis fi lia.17 Steinbauer 1999, 438 tentatively translates luri.zeric as: “bei schönen Scheinen (der Sonne?) und bei freien/klarem (Himmel?)”, which does not make much sense."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" on the enigmatic deity lur in the LIBER LINTEUS ZAGRABIENSIS 223uslane (<*uslanai) is the locative of *uslana, possibly an adjective of usil: ‘sun; noon; midday.’ Colonna translates uslane tentatively as ‘during the rising of the sun’, but this is already expressed by θesane. The word uslanes (uncertain reading) may be present on an Etruscan mirror from Corchiano, a site near Civita Castellana (Ambrosini 1996).18Who are the enigmatic deities Lur and Zer?The lexeme mlaχe is derived from mlaχ (‘nice; beautiful’), cf. mlace farθne in a tomb inscription at Tarquinia, Ta 1.164: spitus larθ . . . arce. maniim mlace. farθne. faluθras, or ‘Larth Spitus . . . made the monument for the beautiful farθan (genius) of (the) faluθra.’ The latter word is probably a collective, cf. for example *huzrnatra (‘epheby, club of young men’).The words mlaχe luri, dative of lur, are also mentioned in an inscrip-tion in the Tomba Golini I of Settecamini, near Orvieto (c. 350–325 BCE) and in an inscription on a sarcophagus lid from Musarna in the Ager Tarquiniensis (c. 275–250 BCE):– Vs 1.179 vel: laθites . . . . zilaχnve: pulum: rumitrineθi: mlace: clel: lur[ i]– AT 1.107 larθ: aleθnas: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . luri: mlace.Judged by the parallel mlace. farθne (quoted above), it seems that Lur is an underworld god. The front of the sarcophagus chest (AT 1.107) shows a mask with a Phrygian cap between two centrifugal ketea (van der Meer 2004, 150, no. H 213). The mask may personify death or a death demon. The meaning of a mask is known from an earlier context. The name φersu, a man who threatens a blindfolded, armed man with a bloodthirsty dog (in three archaic tomb paintings at Tarquinia, Ta 7.4; 7.11), means ‘mask’ (preserved in Latin persona: ‘mask, person’).Possibly the root lur is also present in the Latin words luror and luridus, as in Horace: luridus Orcus or ‘the pale underworld god’ (Carm. 3.4.74).19 Other underworld gods also have the epithet m(a)lak-:– AV 2.3 mi malak vanθ ‘I (am) the nice/good Vanth’– AS 7.1 . . . leprnal: mlakas ‘. . . for the nice/good Leprna’20It is probably culsu leprna, mentioned in Ta 1.17, the inscription on the volumen of the famous Pulenas sarcophagus lid.

The lexemes lur, lurs, lurni and lurmita/lurmica, names of a deity, occur in the following inscriptions. On the Lead from Magliano, c. 450 BCE, we read: – AV 4.1 . . . tins. lursth . . . ‘for Tin in the area of Lur’ (Maggiani 2002, 283) – AV 4.1 . . . thun lursth sal afrs. naces . . . ‘a fi rstling? in the area of Lur dedicated to the beloved/grand- (?) parents’The origial name of the god must have been lur, as locatives ending on -th are preceded by a genitive (cf. velclthi: ‘at *Velca’ (Vulci, see Vc 4.1; 4.2)). As some other deities (Thanr, Calu) mentioned on the Lead of Magliano can be related to the underworld, Lur can, in principle, also belong to the funerary sphere, in association with an ancestral cult.The lexeme lurś in the following inscription is a nominative that developed from a genitive:– OI 0.21 lurśl lrtla vatlmi faśte‘For Lurs Larta, o Vatlmi, faśte’The inscription is on the upperside of a disk that crowns the top of a South Etruscan, bronze candelabrum, c. 400–350 BCE; the artifact was made in Vulci or more likely in Orvieto.22 As candelabra usually are found in tombs, this inscription seems to confi rm Lur’s funerary nature.A bronze arula or base from Vulci, località Poggio Olivastro, dated to the 4th or 3rd century BCE, has the following inscription:23truφun peθu/nus. v. l/av // lurmic/la. turce.

The type of artifact shows that the deity has also had an oracular function.The following text is inscribed on an early Hellenistic bronze statue of an adorant young boy from Southern Etruria:OA 3.6 vel matlnas turce lur:mitla cvera‘Vel Matlnas gave (me) to Lurmita as sacred (gift)’24Cvera is the adjective of cver. As Rix suggests the colon between lur and mitla should be deleted.Finally lurs may be mentioned on a 5th century BCE vase from a sanctuary near a bridge at San Giovenale (Colonna and Backe Fors-berg, 1999, 76 no. 35):mi l[urs l]aruniθla‘I (am) of Lurs that of Larun (*lurs laruniθa)’The epithets Larta (cf.

Laran and Maris on Etruscan mirrors are in marginal position on Etruscan mirrors, fl anking and protecting major gods (van der Meer 1987, 121–2; 1995, 229–232). The suburban context of the vase, just outside San Giovenale, confi rms my interpretation.So, in principle mlaχe luri zeric in LL may mean: ‘for the good/beauti-ful Lur and Zer’. Steinbauer translates zeri as ‘free (person)’, on the basis of a curse inscription from Monte Pitti (near Populonia): Po 4.4, line 9: . . . ceś. zeriś . . . . lautniθa (‘. . . . of zeri . . . freedwoman’).25 In Po 4.4 line 6, however, the words ceś. zeriś occur without lautniθa. The meaning of ceś is unclear.26 It may be a nominative, judged by ceśc (ces-c) aniaχ (an adjective/ethnicum referring to a place *ania in LL column 6.2).In the inscription of the famous Cippus Perusinus (Pe 8.4) line 18 we read: . . . ein. zeri una cla. θil. θunχulθl . . . . or ‘and not for zer- (an) una (vase?) of this (clal) water (θi-s) of (the) θunchulθ’, but the word zer cannot mean ‘freedman’. De Simone’s tentative translation of the substantiated adjective zersna in the Tabula Cortonensis, line A 4, as ‘masks of ancestors’ might support my hypothesis that zer is a god with a funerary character 24 Roncalli and Bonfante 1991, 289–291, no. 6.12.25 Steinbauer 1999, 310–1 and 325.26 Ces on a vase, Cr 0.8, may be the name of person. ces may be akin to Lat. * cesna > cena (meal)."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"226 l. bouke van der meer(De Simone 1998, 25, 84).

More diffi cult to reconstruct is the character of Zer. However, as he is probably mentioned in a curse inscription, he may be an underworld god too.

With fi elds fi lled with large chamber tombs fi lled with objects of gold, the best examples of Attic pottery known and wall paintings of stupendous quality, who could possibly care about searching for the burned bones buried in a used clay cooking pot. Like the bones of the upscale people for whom these tombs were built, these pots and their contents were trashed by tomb looters as well as by the proto-archaeologists of the 19th and most of the 20th century. Even as the bones within Etruscan tombs began to be somewhat systematically recovered in the 1980s, the burned bones representing cremations were largely ignored even within big tombs that were still being identifi ed. At sites such as Tarquinia, among the many inhumations in a cham-ber tomb, a number of cremations often are found. In these chamber tombs the cremations that had been placed within elaborate imported Greek vessels are commonly noted, and even saved, but those placed within simple or perishable containers generally go unnoticed or are simply disregarded.The growing awareness in Italy of the importance of studying indi-viduals buried in the simplest manners (such as in a tomba a buca; cf. Cavagnaro Vanoni 2002; Cataldi 2005) has led to increased interest in what the skeletal remains can tell us. Fortunately “the often underes-timated presence of cremation” (Rife 2006) has become a subject of particular interest to physical anthropologists. The analysis of crema-tions is vital to the interpretation of mortuary programs of all classes as well as to the understanding of gender roles among the Etruscans (Becker 2005a). The study of cremated remains is particularly important in cases where these fragments of bone constitute the entire recovered mortuary ‘assemblage’ (e.g. Cazzella and Moscoloni 1988) and represent all that we can know about the burial other than its placement. The numbers of studies of burned bones has grown particularly rapidly over the past fi fteen years as awareness of the value of this procedure has grown. Unfortunately there is more awareness of value (Borgognini Tarli, Minozzi and Masali 1998) than actual implementation of these studies. Relatively little effort has been made to decode what the con-texts and condition of the recovered burned bones can tell us about Etruscan and Italic mortuary procedures.In general cremation had become the norm throughout the Italian peninsula and much of central Europe during the Iron Age. Recent"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 231studies of the taphonomic processes relating to cremation burials within egalitarian societies (Reinhard and Fink 1994) have been useful for understanding cultural activities during the later part of the Iron Age in Italy, commonly called the Villanovan period (c. 900/850–750/700 BCE; see Small 1994). These studies of skeletons and the changes they undergo prior to excavation also provide clues to the interpretation and meaning of cremation activities during the Etruscan period. Of particular note, especially with regard to the cremation in Tomb 6322 at Tarquinia and others of the 5th–4th century BCE, is that these later urns are much smaller than the large, biconical examples used during the Villanovan period.The large biconical urns were used to inter the relatively unaltered bone that was recovered from an individual after the pyre had cooled. A brief note should be made that the term ‘ashes’ as applied to cremated remains greatly distorts our perception of what remains after most cre-mations. What is left is essentially a burned and often relatively intact skeleton, as will be discussed below. Although the Roman term ossile-gium to refer to an assemblage of burned bone cannot be documented from before the 5th century CE, I fi nd it useful as a description of the burned skeletal materials that remain after the pyre has done its work.2 Biconical urns generally have a volume of over 25,000 cc, enabling all of the burned skeletal material to be held along with a small array of grave offerings. Biconical urns differ within each cultural area in size, shape and decoration. Almost all, however, were of large size when compared with urns of the 5th century BCE and later.32 Philoxenus (440–523 CE) indicates that ossilegium derives from the Greek ƽƴƵưƭƽƥƫưƮ (Laistner 1965), suggesting that the Greek term or a Latin cognate were long used in Rome. Servius, in his 4th century CE commentaries on Vergil, also should be noted (see Stocker and Travis 1965). One colleague suggests that ossilegium is now being used by biblical scholars to refer to “a specifi c type of Jewish secondary burial practice”. Sextus Pompeius Festus uses the term ossifraga in several contexts (see in Lindsay 1965, 99 line 23, 420 line 17 and 421 line 1; also Laistner 1965, 238). In addition to the placement of an intact corpse on the pyre, there have been some suggestions that the newly defl eshed bones of the deceased may have been cremated, or that the skeletalized remains recovered from a burial may have been burned. Either of these two situations would result in pyroclastic alterations distinct from those found in most cremations, and are also distinct from ‘quenched’ cremations (cf. Becker 1982).3 Museum curation of the relatively intact burned bones, such as recovered from the Le Rose necropolis at Tarquinia (Becker Mss. A, C) and other early sites, enables extremely accurate evaluations of these sets of remains. The cultural changes through time and space that are refl ected in the use of cremation does not support Noy’s (2000b, 190) suggestion that bodies were reduced to “avoid the corpse being further defi led, by animals or enemies.” Few ethnographic accounts of the cremation process are known, but fi ctional accounts may provide useful descriptions of the various aspects of these mortuary processes (e.g. Sharma 2000, 146, 148 for modern Hindus in India)."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"232 marshall joseph beckerThe general use of a large and diffi cult-to-produce cinerary container for each member of a society argues for relatively egalitarian status. The rare use of small but interestingly shaped hut urns along with a wide variety of high status items suggests that the people interred in them may have represented a class of ‘chiefs.’ The bones from an elite individual buried in a hut urn of the Iron Age (Bartoloni et al. 1987; also Becker 1993b, 2005b) required special treatment to reduce the volume of their bones to fi t into these unusual and relatively small containers (Noy 2000a, 30, and see below). Comminution, or the delib-erate reduction of the skeletal volume through pounding or otherwise crushing the bones (Bowmer and Molleson 1986), was once widespread and common. When hut urns came into use, crushing appears to have been an elite prerogative while ordinary folk appear to have been buried in biconical urns. Eventually crushing re-emerged as a norm among many peoples, and the sizes of containers needed for these ossilegia was much reduced. When crushing was common even the bones of cremated individuals destined for larger containers such as the large Calabrese urn from Cerveteri, in which the remains of an adolescent were buried (Becker 1998a), commonly were subjected to comminution although there was no need to process the bones in that fashion. The Calabrese example suggests that this procedure became incorporated within normal mortuary rituals, although variations among cities may have existed and remain to be recognized.Cremations of later periods commonly were interred in smaller urns than were the norm during the Villanovan era. The ossilegium of some low status people could be deposited in relatively small containers. Invariably these less elaborate cremations used simple ceramic ollae of perhaps 5,000 cc volume, small wooden containers (see below), or spe-cially made ceramic vessels of similar size (generally under 10,000 cc)to hold these remains. The approximate volume of the larger ceramic cinerary chests used at Chiusi generally exceed 10,000 cc (see in Ras-trelli 2000), but most of the wheel turned cinerary urns from Chiusi have volumes of under 5,000 cc (Becker 2001, see also Becker 1996a). The use of leather bags as well as wooden or basketry containers to hold an ossilegium has been inferred from fi ndings of piles of cremated bones in loose heaps within tombs at Tarquinia (cf. below). The sizes of wooden, leather, or even basket containers may have varied greatly, but in general they were rather small. Perishable containers would have been used commonly for lower status members of a household, and the space allotted to them in the tomb would be correspondingly small."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 233Attention continues to be largely directed in Etruria to gleaning infor-mation from inhumed bones (cf. Cresta and Vecchi 1969; Borgognoni Tarli 1975; Mallegni, Fornaciari and Tarabella 1980; Fornaciari and Mallegni 1986). Cremated skeletal remains now are more likely to be recovered from Italic archaeological contexts, but the detailed analyses of these materials have only recently become the subject of detailed investigations (see Bowmer and Molleson 1986; Becker 1987; Bartoloni et al. 1987). Emphasis on the bones and any artifacts as important sources of mortuary information4 has overshadowed the discussion of other contents in cinerary containers as evidence for local funerary customs. The presence or absence of wood ash and other pyre related materials helps us to contextualize more effectively the cremated bone within the specifi c society of which the once living person was a part and enables us to infer aspects of the mortuary programs involved.Gathering the ossilegiumA great number of variations in the cremation process existed at differ-ent times and at different places throughout Italy. These even include incomplete cremation achieved by ‘quenching’ the pyre before the burning had been completed (Gualtieri 1982; Becker 1982). McKinley (1994a) conservatively noted that studies of cremated bone normally describe their post-excavation state. We can, however, examine the materials accompanying the bone to reconstruct aspects of the mortuaryritual that take us back to the end of the cremation process itself. Once the pyre has burned itself out, the gathering of the remains may begin. We infer that some special attention may have been paid by the ancients to the remains of each cremated individual (cf. Musgrave 1990, 286). Note has been made of cremation rituals that gather much if not most of the boney remains and deposit them within a container suf-fi ciently large to hold the entire skeleton. Variations on this theme are known in various locations across a wide chronological range. A brief description of the probable sequence of burning and collecting of the skeletal remains from Tarquinia Tomb 6322 enables us to understand the taphonomic processes involved in this specifi c process, and probably others of the same period and social class at Tarquinia.4 See Vanzetti 1991; Becker and Donadio 1992; Bondioli, Salvadei and Formenti 1994, fi g. 1; Becker 1995, 1997a, Ms. A."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"234 marshall joseph beckerThe post-burning cremation process includes comminution, place-ment in a protective container of some type, plus burial. This process is followed by in-ground deterioration and damage during recovery. If the bones were in a perishable container, the excavation of a pile or scatter of bones is a problematical task. If the bones are within a container, then removal plus other post-excavation disturbances, including storage of various types (see esp. Pearce 1998), may further damage the remains. All of these factors bring us to the point at which the contents of a cinerary vessel arrive for examination. There are four considerations that Musgrave (1990, 284) notes as critical to the study of cremated human remains. These may be summarized as follows:A. Do the remains of infants or children appear with the bones of adults (cf. Becker 2005c)?B. Are double or multiple individuals represented, as was common at ancient Volterra (cf. Becker 2001)?C. Have the remains been ‘pounded’ or otherwise deliberately crushed (i.e. comminution)?5D. How much care had been devoted to collecting the remains from the pyre and to separating bone from wood ash? Is all the material shoveled into a container (ossa et cineres) or is the bone removed from the wood ash, and has the bone also been washed?The last of these considerations probably should be listed fi rst. Con-temporary studies of the bones from a cremation tend to focus only on remains taken out of context. Such studies evaluate bone categories and provide specifi c weights for each region of the human skeleton represented. While this approach may provide an indication of dif-ferential survival, more likely this refl ects the random process of bone recovery from the pyre. The presence of only a few bits of bone in a cinerary vessel also may refl ect modern division of an urn’s contents by dealers in antiquities, who may have divided the ossilegium from one container into several urns to give empty examples an air of authenticity. While the bones have been divided into categories (e.g. ‘long bones’), the tabulation of absolute weights of these categories remains undone; 5 McKinley (1994a) notes the effects on bones in British examples where comminu-tion does not appear to have been part of the mortuary process. The apparent lack of comminution among the examples examined by McKinley (1994b) lead us to wonder what became of those bones that would not fi t within a small container."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 235since we expect differential weights according to gender, this data would be especially useful.Attempts at weight classifi cation of cremated bone is also complicated by problems associated with earth penetration, types and degrees of cleaning, and bone loss through deterioration in the cleaning process.Archaeologically, we need to examine the ‘context’ of the container and all that it holds. Too often physical anthropologists are treated as specialists without archaeological training, suited only for evaluation of human bone. This is not an acceptable dichotomy as the actual excavation of the cinerary container, as any other locus of an excava-tion, requires both archaeological expertise as well as the complex skills involved in the evaluation of human remains. Where remains have already been removed from context, and that data set is lost, we may separate out these areas of expertise.6 Fortunately, in the case of the small pot used as a container for the bones in Tarquinia Tomb 6322, we were able to evaluate the entire context within the olla.An interesting observation regarding disturbed bones may be useful in understanding this process. Some cremated bones in their sealed burial containers have been found to be in a remarkably clean condi-tion, suggesting that portions of the ossilegium had been picked out of the ashes and perhaps even washed before being placed into the urn. When bones are found crushed into small bits we may infer that the relatively large pieces from the ossilegium had been on a relatively clean surface for comminution. Cleaned bones are very different from those mixed with large amounts of gray ash and/or bits of carbonized wood, with the latter situation more common (Berggren 1996; Becker, Turfa and Algee, in press). Mixed urn contents suggest that the remains of the pyre were crushed on the ustrinum and the bone bits and ash were then shoveled directly into a container. An interesting point regarding possible preferences for ash-free bone is an observation from the 1st 6 Post-mortem movement of cremated remains from tomb contexts is indicated by other evidence. Quite commonly we see green or blue-green ‘bronze’ stains on burned bones in containers in which no metals are detected. This suggests that objects may have been removed from among the ossilegium, or that the bones may have been held at some point in a copper alloy container and later relocated to the context from which we know them. A notable example is the bone in a vessel at The University Museum, Philadelphia (MS 2860) on which a blue-green color appears on the cancellous interior aspect of a cremated bone fragment, but not on any surface feature of the surviving skeleton (Becker, Turfa, and Algee, in press). At some point after burning these remains were in contact with some type of copper or copper alloy, and subsequently found their way into this vessel."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"236 marshall joseph beckercentury CE indicating that clean bones may have been retrieved from the pyre by use of then new technology. Pliny notes the use of a funeral shroud woven from the long fi bers of asbestos that could be used in this task. Deposits of asbestos, a non-combustible mineral that occurs naturally in a fi brous state, are fairly common in the Mediterannean region. The long fi bers of asbestos can be fashioned into rough threads that can be woven into a fabric that will not burn.7 Placing an asbestos blanket between a body to be burned and the pyre keeps the bone separate from the ash and wood of the pyre. These osseous remains then could be gathered up simply by picking up the blanket from the burned material beneath it. Pliny the Elder writes (HN 19. 4):Also a linen has now been invented that is incombustible. It is called ‘live’ linen, and I have seen napkins made of it glowing on the hearths at banquets and burnt more brilliantly clean by the fi re than they could be by being washed in water. This linen is used for making shrouds for royalty which keep the ashes of the corpse separate from the rest of the pyre. . . . The Greek name for it is asbestinon, derived from its peculiar property.8Tarquinia Tomb 6322RecoveryThe specifi c treatment afforded the burned bones from the simple cre-mation of the person recovered from Tarquinia Tomb 6322 provides the subject of this study (cf. Becker 1998b). The basic treatment of these bones may be taken as an indication of typical processing of each cremation placed by the Etruscans and probably their Roman neighbors in a small, unspecialized container. The results of this study are presented together with insights provided by the analysis of the bone as it was ‘excavated’ from the urn. In a few recent cases intact cinerary containers have been recovered and the contents ‘excavated’ by physical anthropologists (e.g. Becker and Salvadei 1992; McKinley 1994a). This procedure offers a more clear view of the cremation pro-cess as it existed in antiquity, undistorted by damage to the container or by the search for objects within the urn other than the human 7 The British Museum has an example of Etruscan asbestos textile, Inventory G.&R.A. 52–1–12.10.

Since most of the individual cremations that have been carefully studied during removal from their small containers are Anglo-Saxon or Romano-British in origin, this single example from Tarquinia provides an important Etruscan parallel, and a basis by which we may generalize to cremations of lower status individuals at Tarquinia c. 400 BCE. In this example from Tarquinia the container is a typical cooking pot or olla. From the Iron Age into the Christian period this category of ovoid domestic vessel commonly served as an urn to hold the ossilegium. The minor variations in rim shape and body profi les used for these pots have not yet been decoded in such a way as to enable accurate dates to be assigned to them (Dyson 1976).In 1990 broad surface fl ooding of the type called ‘sheet wash,’ from unusually heavy rains, deeply scoured the surface of a section of one of the many burial areas at Tarquinia. The Soprintendenza Archeologica per Etruria Meridionale took immediate action to recover information from the many tombs exposed in this part of the Carraccio Rogani (proprietà Rogani) necropolis area. Tomb 6322, excavated on 11 June 1991, was found among many large chamber tombs as well as many other smaller varieties of chamber tombs. This tomb was a modifi ed pozzo tomb that had been dug into the bedrock (Cataldi 2005). Within the small hole was a single small Etruscan cremation urn of the period c. 425–375 BCE (Becker 2002, 694).In this example the urn is a small olla with a restricted neck. This is the typical cooking vessel of central Italy and is a type commonly used for cremation burials. Within this urn, or what the Romans called an ossuarium, were fragments of bone indicating the presence of one adult. The container of T. 6322 resembles the olla of T. 6094 as well as the urn of T. 6097 (Cavagnaro Vanoni 2002, 385, fi g. 9, no. 1; 397, fi g. 22). Note should be made that at least one other single burial of approximately the same period as T. 6322 also held a cremated female (T. 6319: see Becker 1997a) and was recovered from the same area of Tarquinia (see Cavagnaro Vanoni 2002). Slight variations in the forms of the simple urns holding these bones may help in providing even more specifi c dates for each of these burials. Most of the other cremations recovered from Tarquinia come from large chamber tombs, all appar-ently dating from after 580 BCE and before 90 BCE (Becker 1998b; but see Vargiu and Becker 2005). Most of the cremations from Tarquinia recovered between 1987 and 1995 were studied as part of M. Cataldi’s recent program of research (Cataldi 2005; Becker Ms. B)."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"238 marshall joseph beckerThe relatively intact urn provided the excavators with the opportunity to leave it in situ within this small tomb, in order to have it excavated by the on-site physical anthropologist. Although the urn in T. 6322 had fractured while buried, allowing a few fragments of bone to migrate into the surrounding soil, the contents were generally undisturbed. Those few bits dislodged from the urn were recovered during excavation of the tomb. Thus the bones could be studied as they were being removed from the urn. The goal of this excavation of the urn, or the fi rst step in the recovery of the bones, differs from the ultimate goal of provid-ing age and sex information. This ‘mini-excavation’ was intended to determine the processes used to reduce these remains after cremation and to place them within the urn before it had been interred.Method of StudyThe skeletal material was taken from the fi eld while still within the vessel. Detailed notes were taken during the removal of the material remaining in the container, especially relating to bone size and cat-egory. The recovered ossilegium was evaluated in the laboratory using methods described previously (Becker 1987, 1998a, 2005b; Becker and Salvadei 1992; Bondioli, Salvadei and Formenti 1994). The usual procedure for the disturbed contents of a cinerary container involves sifting all materials to separate earth and possibly ash from bone (cf. McKinley 1993). The fragments are then sorted by the part of the body represented, and by size, for evaluation and possible re-assembly (see also van Vark 1970).FindingsTomb 6322, a tomba a buca (Cataldi 2005) was found just outside the entry to a large chamber tomb. Unclear is whether this small tomba had been buried under the tumulus as a separate burial and predated it, was included within the fi ll of the tumulus at the time of its construction as if a grave offering (or casual disposal), or if it was later intruded through the tumulus or placed nearby. The considerable quantity of wood ash found surrounding the bones in the small vessel from Tomb 6322 suggests that the bones were not separated from the ash before being subjected to crushing. The presence of ash suggests that the burned bones remained on the ustrinum where they, along with the ash of the pyre, were crushed together, probably by a large wooden roller. The mix of crushed bone and wood ash, or a moderate portion of it,"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 239could be scooped up using a wooden shovel and deposited directly into the burial urn. The weight of the bone recovered from Tomb 6322, approximately 1.2 kg, is below the expected range produced by an adult skeleton, possibly even that of a small adult female. The small volume and weight of the surviving bone, the absence of many fragments of tooth roots, and the very small number of cranial elements all suggest that only a portion of the surviving material was gathered into the small container provided for them. The remainder, crushed into frag-ments perhaps recognizable only by a specialist or possibly too small to permit visual identifi cation, may have been swept away in clearing the ustrinum for the next customer.The only person in this simple burial of the period 425–375 BCE was a female who died at age c. 50 years (Becker 1997a, 2002, 694). The actual excavation of the ossilegium, or collected ‘bones’ placed within this urn provides interesting evidence that enables us to reconstruct some of the details involved in the cremation process. An understanding of this aspect of mortuary programs provides us with greater insights into the daily lives of these people, and in particular into gender and status differences within Etruscan society.Evaluation of these bones and the accompanying ash also found within the urn indicated clearly that the skeletal material was not separated from the remains of the wood used for the pyre. The burned human remains were not picked out from the ashes to form a sepa-rate ossilegium, but rather were processed while still lying together with thoroughly combusted wood ash on the ustrinum. These burned bones had been subjected to considerable comminution by a process required, or selected, whenever a small urn was provided to the operators as the container for the recovered remains. Since these vessels are small, relative to a complete adult human ossilegium, the skeletal mass must be reduced in volume (or selectively recovered) in order that the pieces are small enough to be scooped up and poured into within the small urn. The bones within this vessel weigh less than 1.2 kg and are heavily impregnated and coated with ash and earth. The surrounding materials have considerably distorted (increased) the weight of the surviving ‘dry bone’ of this cremation. From the degree to which these bones have been vitrifi ed and retain their form, and from their uniform light color, it is evident that the temperature of the pyre had been in the range of 950 degrees Centigrade.In Tarquinia Tomb 6322, except for two fragments of long bone, each c. 4 cm in length, the largest pieces of bone recovered measure"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"240 marshall joseph beckerabout 3 cm. Most measure less than 1 cm in length. All of the surviving bone appears to have been carefully crushed to allow the remains to be shoveled into the assigned container. The comminution process must have been very effi cient, and obviously took place on the ustrinum since the bone fragments are completely covered by the gray ash indicating a high temperature fi re. Despite crushing, many of these small bits easily can be identifi ed. Of importance in understanding this crema-tion process is the observation that the broken bones were not further damaged while in the urn, nor by activities involved in their recovery or post-recovery storage.Critical to the determination of the sex of the person in T. 6322 is the evaluation of age at death. The delicate bones of adolescents of either sex may be confused with small adult females.9 In T. 6322 the dozen identifi ed pieces of the calotte include three with evidence for cranial sutures. All are open to some degree on the exterior surface, but completely fused on the inner table. Visual inspection confi rms that the fractures follow the lines of the sutures, suggesting that closure had not reached the exterior of the skull. This suggests an age at death of approximately 50 years. The generally gracile appearance of most of the bone fragments from T. 6322 suggests that these are the remains of a female. The most diagnostic single skeletal element is a portion of right tibia shaft at the point of the nutrient foramen, where two pieces of this skeleton were joined to form a 70 mm long piece of this bone. The overall size appears to be in the range of a small female. This observation is supported by examination of most of the other frag-ments where the cortex is generally quite thin. The gracile cranial bits, small size of the tooth sockets in the two pieces with alveolar margins (both mandibular and maxillary), and the small size of the fi ve actual fragments of tooth roots all indicate that this person most probably is female. Some of the long bone shaft fragments are suffi ciently robust 9 Aside from the few studies of cremated children associated with tophets, very little has been done to evaluate the remains of children from the more than 60 infant or perinatal cemeteries known on the Italian peninsula (cf. Becker 1997bc, 2005c). Cre-mations from Pithekoussai provide us with insights into Greek colonial activities, and the extent to which subadults are found among these remains. How these relate to the sub-fl oor infant ‘cremations’ known from the area of the Athenian agora of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE remains to be investigated (see Jordan and Rotroff 1999, 152; also Becker 2007). Pontecagnano Tomb 1057 represents a child age 5.5 years (600–575 BCE, Becker 1995b), but subadult burials are not commonly known from necropolis at that site. Recent studies demonstrate that in Etruria children who died below age 5.5 years were buried in specialized cemeteries (Becker 2005c)."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 241to fall within the male range. A single section of rib is quite robust (diameters 16.1 by 6.8 mm), but within the female range. No other sections of rib survive, although a few slivers can be recognized. We conclude that these remains are of a female of middle age.The two bits of surviving jaw also provide some insights into the dental health. A small piece of mandible has portions of the alveolar margins of the sockets intact, indicating that two teeth, probably both left incisors, were present at death. A maxillary fragment indicates that the right canine also was in place. The root fragments noted also demonstrate that at least two molars were present, so that at least fi ve teeth were in situ when this person died. There is no evidence in the alveolar area to suggest that any teeth had been lost before death. This single individual, therefore, may be considered to have enjoyed good dental health.10Cremation Process Reconstructed for Tomb 6322Cremation rituals vary through time and space, and particularly relevant to the status of the deceased. As early as the Iron Age, elite members of society were afforded rites distinct from others. The single individual buried in Tarquinia Tomb 6322, dated to the period at the end of the 5th or early in the 4th century BCE, refl ects a low status individual in every aspect of her burial. The small urn, apparently a used cooking pot, and placement in a small pit on the surface in the area of large, high status tombs suggest a very humble grave indeed. The proximity to large tombs could refl ect interment within the earthen mound cov-ering one of the large, bedrock tombs. However, centuries of looting 10 No os resectum (terminal fi nger bone) was found among the bone fragments from T. 6322 (cf. Becker 1988). However, two extremely small fragments of unburned and demineralized bone were found adjacent to the urn in which the cremation was held. These could not be determined to be either human or animal (cf. Whyte 2001). The possibility must be considered that an earlier inhumation may have been present in this area, and that it was disturbed by the excavators. More likely these bones represent a grave offering made in the area, or simply random pieces of bone, either human or animal, such as are common in cemetery areas.A small, twisted bit of bronze was found among the bones, approximately one-third the distance down from the top of the upper level of the bones while in the urn.

However, we do have some analogous information in the Roman context. John Bodel’s (1994) excellent overview of the social and economic aspects of funerary activities, based on his useful interpretation of Bove’s (1966) publication of a set of funerary laws from Pozzuoli, tells us much about pyre-burners and other practitioners engaged in the business of death. The locations of these business enter-prises, the residences of funeral workers, roles played by fl ute players, and other participants also are discussed in detail by Bodel (1994, 50), as are their relationship to Libitina, the Roman goddess of funerals.Interpretation of the Cremated Remains from Tomb 6322: Votive-like OfferingsThe complex psychological interactions affecting the survivors of a death are much discussed in modern psychiatric literature. The desire for self-aggression, a manifestation of both grief and survivor guilt, often takes the form of ‘self sacrifi ce’, in the giving of tomb offerings, the sacrifi ce of animals, or even the ‘mild’ self mutilation represented by the cutting off of hair (Sourvinou-Inwood 1983, 41). Numerous other forms of self aggression connected with modern Greek mourning rituals, such as scratching or tearing of “breasts, neck, face and hair” also are discussed by Souvinou-Inwood (1983, 37), who notes how these activities refl ect social attitudes toward death (see also Burkert 1972, 64–66). More extreme cases of self aggression noted from other mod-ern cultures involve the offering of a fi nger joint from the living (see Becker 1986, 1996b), and of blood letting as practiced by the ancient Maya of Central America. On the basis of my research with crema-tions, the os resectum noted in several Roman texts can be identifi ed as a fi nger joint removed from a person about to be cremated (Becker 1988, note 5). While removal of a terminal fi nger joint from a corpse may be signifi cantly different than a live donation such as known in a number of ethnographic situations, the concepts are strongly linked. The sacrifi ce of humans to accompany the dead, strongly associated with ancient chiefdoms, also has been detected through the analysis of cremated skeletal remains (Becker 1993a)."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 243Etruscan funerary behaviors can be compared with Homeric descrip-tions of the process and with data from archaeological fi ndings of the 8th century BCE. Sourvinou-Inwood (1983, 38) provides a useful ref-erence enabling us to understand how mourners achieve a “symbolic, partial identifi cation with the deceased . . .” Certainly Etruscan tombs, with their offerings and reuse, refl ect a direct and continuing connection between the living and the dead, beginning with complex interment rituals and continuing with commemorative banquets, etc.The wide variations in wealth and/or status at Tarquinia that had developed by the end of the 5th century BCE can be seen in the many different types of tombs from that period. Tomb 6322 is among the simplest of that period. Comparing the later range of burial forms with the relatively small variation in size among most of the cinerary urns used in the Villanovan period enables us to infer a considerable shift in socio-political structure. By the 5th century the chiefdoms of the Early Iron Age had developed, perhaps through contacts with Greek mercantile peoples and other infl uences from beyond the Etruscan homeland, into incipient city-states. The transition to incipient political states in Etruria is now being revealed through multiple lines of evi-dence (cf. Wason 1994). Etruscan material culture commonly mimicked imported goods, and monumental architecture incorporated elements from abroad. Perhaps most telling are the varied uses of written forms of the language. The magical aspects of the written word dominated the use of texts for communication at a distance, or as means by which ‘political statements’ could be made. Written claims to kingship and royal lineage, commonly associated with public monuments, are critical diagnostic elements in the recognition of emerging states. Identifying these features in Etruria may reveal that the individual Etruscan polities retained traditional forms of socio-political structure.The evidence from Tarquinia suggests that after 500 BCE adolescent and young adult males of the elite, and perhaps of all social classes, were being cremated. This fi nding should be considered in light of the unusual evidence from the people buried in Iron Age hut urns from the area of Castelgandolfo, now verifi ed as being the remains of ado-lescent and young adult males (Cassoli and Tagliacozzo 1987; Bowmer and Molleson 1987; Becker 2005b). Hut urns from other areas appear to hold the remains of older and presumably high status males. The localized variation in the area of Castelgandolfo in the use of hut urns (cf. Becker 1992) during the Iron Age may relate to the pattern that re-emerges at Tarquinia after 500 BCE, or at least should be considered in our attempts to infer meaning from these patterns."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"244 marshall joseph beckerAt one end of the scale there are the simple pozzo burials containing low status women. Low status adolescents and children may not have been buried in the vicinity of the large chamber tombs near Etruscan cities. Tomb 6322 from Tarquinia may be typical of disposal practices used for the many laboring women within a large household. These people probably were cremated wearing whatever garments or tatters worn in life, with the bones then deposited within pots that in life they may have stirred with wooden spoons. These simple interments may represent life at the low end of the range in an elite household, and are far from representing life at its most harsh in any traditional urban situation. The variations in mortuary programs at the major Etruscan site of Tarquinia at the end of the 5th century BCE refl ect the growing complexity of status variables within each household (Becker 2000). The variations in the size of the large tombs at Tarquinia remain diffi cult to quantify, but may not indicate the hierarchical differences that might indicate the development of a simple state. The ‘princely’ tombs found could be described as those of ‘Big Men’ or ‘chiefs’ as a means of more accurately refl ecting the organization of these early towns as centers of complex chiefdoms (Becker 1990). The kinds of social dynamics that characterize chiefdoms suggest that all people were cared for on some level. Status differences within an incipient Tarquinian state may be refl ected, at the low end, by T. 6322, revealing that even the most humble person might be buried among or in the vicinity of elite tombs. The street people of later urban Rome, beggars and thieves alike, lived in a far more precarious state. Clearing the corpses of the destitute from the streets resulted in their being treated little different from the bodies of the dogs and horses that were cleared by ‘sanitation workers,’ who held a status not much higher than that of the beggars.The social changes generated by economic expansion in Etruria created an ambiguity among these peoples as to where their best inter-ests would be found. The power of the rapidly expanding Rome may have been less a factor in the absorption of the Etruscan towns than the attraction of the material and organizational benefi ts that became available to the Etruscan people. For the women serving even the most affl uent households, or sustaining independent but impoverished families, life and death rituals were conducted at an economic level far removed from the elite whose tombs and trappings of wealth have for so long been the sole focus of scholarly attention."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" cremation and comminution at etruscan tarquinia 245BibliographyBartoloni, G., F.
