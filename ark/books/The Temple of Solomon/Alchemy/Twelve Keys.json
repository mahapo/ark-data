Then I saw that there was no hope ofrepentance for mankind, that they were getting worse day by day, and that for their impenitence God'severlasting punishment was hanging over them; and I made haste to withdraw myself from the evil world, tobid farewell to it, and to devote myself to the service of God.When I had spent some years at the monastery, I found that after I had performed my work and my dailydevotions I still had some time on my hands. This I did not wish to pass in idleness, lest my evil thoughtsshould lead me into new sins; and so I determined to use it for the study and investigation of those naturalsecrets by which God has shadowed out eternal things. So I read a great many books in our monastery writtenin olden times by philosophers who had pursued the same study, and was thereby stimulated to a more ardentdesire of knowing that which they also knew. Though I did not make much progress at first, yet at last Godgranted my earnest prayer, and opened my eyes that I might see what others had seen before me.Twelve Keys1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In the convent there was a brother, who was afflicted with a severe disease of the kidneys, and to whom noneof the many physicians he had consulted had been able to give even momentary relief. So he had committedhimself to the hand of God, and despaired of all human aid.As I loved him, I gathered all manner of herbs, extracted their salts, and distilled various medicines. But noneof them seemed to do him the slightest good, and after six years I found that I had tried every possiblevegetable substance, without any beneficial effect.At last I determined to devote myself to the study of the powers and virtues which God has laid into metalsand minerals and the more I searched the more I found. One discovery led to another, and, after God hadpermitted unto me many experiments, I understood clearly the nature and properties, and the secret potency,imparted by God to minerals and metals.Among the mineral substances I found one which exhibited many colours, and proved to be of the greatestefficacy in art. The spiritual essence of this substance I extracted, and therewith restored our sick brother, in afew days, to perfect health. For the strength of this spirit was so great as to quicken the prostrate spirit of mydiseased brother, who, from that day to the day of his death, remembered me in his hourly prayers. And hisprayers, together with my own diligence, so prevailed with God, that there was revealed to me that greatsecret which God ever conceals from those who are wise in their own conceits.Thus have I been wishing to reveal to you in this treatise, as far as may be lawful to me, the Stone of theAncients, that you, too, might possess the knowledge of this highest of earthly treasures for your health andcomfort in this valley of sorrow. I write about it, not for my own good, but for that of posterity, and thoughmy words be few and simple, that which they import is of immeasurable magnitude. Ponder them well, thatyou also may find the Rock which is the foundation Stone of truth, the temporal blessing, and the eternalreward. The Tract of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine,Concerning the Great Stone of the Ancient Sages.In the preface, gentle Reader, and zealous Student of this Art, I promised to communicate to you a knowledgeof our Corner Stone, or Rock, of the process by which it is prepared, and of the substance from which it wasalready derived by those ancient Sages, to whom the secret of our Art was first revealed by God for the healthand happiness of earthly life.Let me assure you that I fully intend to fulfil my promise, and to be as plain with you as the rules of our Artpermit, not misleading you by sophistical deceptions, but opening up to you the spring of all blessings evenunto the fountain head. I propose to set forth what I have to say in a few simple, straightforward words, for Iam no adept in the art of multiplying words; nor do I think that exuberance of language tends to clearness; onthe contrary, I am convinced that it is many words that darken council. Let me tell you, then, that althoughmany are engaged in the search after this Stone, it is nevertheless found but by very few. For God neverintended that it should become generally known. It is rather to be regarded as a gift which He reserves forthose favoured few, who love the truth, and hate falsehood, who study our Art earnestly by day and by night,and whose hearts are set upon God with an unfeigned affection. Hence, if you would prepare our great and ancient Stone, I testify unto you in all truth that you must givediligent heed to my teaching, and before all things implore the gracious blessing of the Creator of all things.You must also truly repent you of all your sins, confessing the same, and firmly resolve to lead a good andholy life. It is also necessary that you should determine to shew your gratitude to God for His unspeakableGift, by succouring the poor and the distressed, and by opening your hand and your heart to the needy. Then Twelve KeysThe Tract of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine,2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"God will bless your labour, and reward your search with success, and yourself with a seat in Heaven as thefruit of your faith.Do not despise the truthful writings of those who possessed the Stone before us. For, after the enlighteninggrace of God, it is from them that I received my knowledge. Let your study of them be increased and repeatedoften, lest you lose the thread of insight, and the lamp of understanding be extinguished.Give yourself wholly to study, and be not flighty or doubleminded. Let your mind be like a firm Rock, inwhich all the various sayings of the Sages are reduced to the unity of their common meaning. For a man whois easily influenced in different directions is not likely to find the right path.As our most ancient Stone is not derived from combustible things, you should cease to seek it in substanceswhich cannot stand the test of fire. For this reason it is absurd to suppose that we can make any use ofvegetable substances, though the Stone, too, is endowed 'with a principle of growth.If our Stone were a vegetable substance, it would, like other vegetables, be consumed by fire, leaving only acertain salt. Ancient writers have, indeed, described our Stone as the vegetable Stone. But that name wassuggested to them by the fact that it grows and increases in size, like a plant.Know also that animals only multiply after their kind, and within their own species. Hence our Stone canonly be prepared out of its own seed, from which it was taken in the beginning; and hence also you willperceive that the soul of an animal must not be the subject of this investigation. Animals are a class bythemselves; nor can anything ever be obtained from them that is not animal in its nature. But our Stone, as ithas been bequeathed to me by the Ancients, is derived from two things, and one thing, in which is concealeda third thing. This is the purest truth, and a most faithful saying. For male and female have from of old beenregarded as one body, not from any external or visible consideration, but on account of the ardour of thatmutual love which naturally draws them together into one; and as the male and female seed jointly representthe principle of propagation, so also the sperm of the matter out of which our Stone is made can be sown andincreased. There are in our substance two supplementary kinds of seed, from which our Stone may beprepared and multiplied.If you are a true lover of our Art, you will carefully weigh and ponder these words, lest, with othersophisticators, you fall into the dangerous pit prepared by the common enemy of man. But whence are you toobtain this seed? This question you may most easily answer by asking yourself another question. What doyou want to develop from this seed, and what use do you wish to make of it? There can be no doubt, then thatit must be the root, or first substance, of metals, from which all metals derive their origin. It is, therefore,necessary that we should now proceed to speak of the generation of the metals.In the beginning, when the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, and as yet all was involved indarkness, Almighty and Eternal God, Whose beginning and wisdom are from everlasting, by His inscrutablecounsel created heaven and earth, and all that in them is, both visible and invisible, out of nothing. How theact of creation was accomplished I will not attempt to explain. This is a matter which is set forth to us in HolyScripture, and must be apprehended by faith.To each creature God gave its own seed, wherewith to propagate its kind, that in this way there might alwaysbe an increase of men and animals, plants and metals. Man was not to be able to produce new seed: he wasonly permitted to educe new forms of life out of that which already existed. The creating of seed Godreserved to Himself For if man could create seed he would be equal to the Creator.Know that our seed is produced in the following way. A celestial influence descends from above, by thedecree and ordinance of God, and mingles with the astral proper ties. When this union has taken place, the Twelve KeysThe Tract of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine,3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"two bring forth a third namely, an earth−like substance, which is the principle of our seed, of its first source,so that it can shew an ancestry, and from which three the elements, such as water, air, and earth, take theirorigin. These elements work underground in the form of fire, and there produce what Hermes, and all whohave preceded me, call the three first principles, viz., the internal soul, the impalpable spirit, and visiblebodies, beyond which we can find no earlier beginning of our Magistery.In the course of time these three unite, and are changed through the action of fire into a palpable substance,viz., quicksilver, sulphur, and salt. If these three substances be mixed, they are hardened and coagulated intoa perfect body, which represents the seed chosen and appointed by the Creator. This is a most important andcertain truth. If the metallic soul, the metallic spirit, and the metallic form of body be present, there will alsobe metallic quicksilver, metallic sulphur, and metallic salt, which together make up the perfect metallic body.If you cannot perceive what you ought to understand herein, you should not devote yourself to the study ofphilosophy.Moreover, I tell you in few words, that you cannot obtain a metallic body except by perfectly joining thesethree principles into one. Know, also, that all animals are, like man, composed of flesh and blood, and alsopossess a vitalizing spirit, but are destitute of the rational soul which the Creator gave to man alone.Therefore, when animals die, they perish for ever. But when man yields up his mortal life into the hands ofhis Creator, his soul does not die. It returns, and is united to the glorified body, in which, after theResurrection, soul and spirit dwell together once more in eternal glory, never to be separated againthroughout all eternity.Hence the rational soul of man makes him an abiding creature, and, though his body may seem to die, yet weknow that he will live for ever. For to him death is only a process of purification, by means of which he isfreed from his sins, and translated to another and better place. But there is no resurrection for the brute beasts,because they have no rational soul, for which alone our Lord and Saviour shed His blood.For though a body may be vitalized by a spirit, yet it need not, therefore, be fixed, unless, indeed, it possess arational soul, that strong bond between body and spirit, which represents their union, and resists all efforts toseparate them. Where there is no soul, there is no hope of redemption. Nothing can be perfect or lastingwithout a soul. This is a profound and most important truth, which I feel in conscience bound to make knownto my readers. Now, the spirits of metals have this property of fixedness in a greater or less degree; they aremore or less volatile in proportion to the mutual fitness of their bodies and souls. A metal that has the threeconditions of fixedness is not affected by fire or overcome by any other outward agent. But there is only onemetal that fulfils these conditions, namely, gold. Silver also contains fixed mercury, and is not so quicklyvolatilised as the imperfect metals, but stands the trial of fire, and yields no food to voracious Saturn.Amatory Venus is clothed with abundant colour, and her whole body is one pure tincture, not unlike the redcolour which is found in the most precious of metals. But though her spirit is of good quality, her body isleprous, and affords no permanent substratum to the fixed tincture. Hence the soul has to share the fate of theimperfect body, and when the body dies the soul has to leave it. For its dwelling has been destroyed by fire,and it is without a house wherein to abide.Fixed salt has imparted to warlike Mars a hard, firm, and durable body, which is evidence of the generosity ofhis soul; nor can fire be said to have much power over it. And if its strength be united to the beauty of Venus,I do not say but that a precious and harmonious result may be obtained. For the phlegmatic or humid qualityof the Moon may be heated with the ardent blood of Venus, and the blackness of Venus removed with thestrong salt of Mars. Twelve KeysThe Tract of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine,4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"You need not look for our metallic seed among the elements. It need not be sought so far back. If you canonly rectify the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt (understand, those of the Sages) until the metallic spirit and bodyare inseparably joined together by means of the metallic soul, you thereby firmly rivet the chain of love, andprepare the palace for the coronation.These things represent a liquid key, comparable to the celestial influence, and a dry water joined to theterrestrial substance: all which are one thing, derived from three, and two, and one. If you understand this,you have already attained our Magistery. Then you must join the husband and wife together that each mayfeed upon the other's flesh and blood, and that so they may propagate their species a thousandfold.Though I would fain reveal this matter to you more plainly and openly, I am prohibited from doing so by thelaw of God, and by the fear of His wrath, and of eternal lest the gift of the Most High should be abused.If, however, you do not understand the theoretical part of my work, perhaps the practical part will serve toenlighten you more fully. I will therefore proceed to shew how, by the help of God, I was enabled to preparethe Stone of the Ancients, and, for your further instruction, I will add twelve keys, in which I give a figurativeaccount of our Art.Take a quantity of the best and finest gold, and separate it into its component parts by those media whichNature vouchsafes to those who are lovers of Art, as an anatomist dissects the human body. Thus change yourgold back into what it was before it became gold; and thou shalt find the seed, the beginning, the middle, andthe end−that from which our gold and its female principle are derived, viz., the pure and subtle spirit, thespotless soul, and the astral salt and balsam. When these three are united, we may call them the mercurialliquid: a water which was examined by Mercury, found by him to be pure and spotless, and thereforeespoused by him as his wife. Of the two was born an incombustible oil; for Mercury became so proud that hehardly knew himself. He put forth eagle feathers, and devoured the slippery tail, of the Dragon, andchallenged Mars to battle.Then Mars summoned his horsemen, and bade them enclose Mercury in prison under the ward of Vulcan,until he should be liberated by one of the female sex. When this became known, the other Planets assembledand held a deliberation on the question, what would be the best and wisest course to adopt. When they weremet together, Saturn first came forward, and delivered himself as follows:\" I, Saturn, the greatest of the planets in the firmament, declare here before you all, that I am the meanest andmost unprofitable of all that are here present, that my body is weak, corruptible, and of a swarthy hue, butthat, nevertheless, it is I that try you all. For having nothing that is fixed about me, I carry away with me allthat is of a kindred nature. My wretchedness is entirely caused by that fickle and inconstant Mercury, by hiscareless and neglectful conduct. Therefore, I pray you, let us be avenged on him, shut him up in prison, andkeep him there till he dies and is decomposed, nay, until not a drop of his blood is to be seen.\"Then yellow Jupiter stepped forward, bent his knees, inclined his sceptre, and with great authority bade themcarry out the demand of Saturn. He added that he would punish everyone who did not aid the execution ofthis sentence.Then Mars presented himself, with sword drawn −− a sword that shone with many colours, and gave out abeautiful and unwonted splendour. This sword he gave to the warder Vulcan, and bade him slay Mercury, andburn him, together with his bones, to ashes. This Vulcan consented to do.While he was executing his office, there appeared a beautiful lady in a long, silver robe, intertissued withmany waters, who was immediately recognised as the Moon, the wife of the Sun. She fell on her knees, andwith outspread hands, and flowing tears, besought them to liberate her husband −− the Sun −− from the Twelve KeysThe Tract of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine,5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"prison in which, through the crafty wiles of Mercury, he was being detained by the Planets. But Vulcanrefused to listen to her request; nor was he softened by the moving prayers of Lady Venus, who appeared in acrimson robe, intertissued with threads of green, and charmed all by the beauty of her countenance and thefragrance of the flowers which she bore in her hand. She interceded with Vulcan, the Judge, in the Chaldeetongue, and reminded him that a woman was to effect the deliverance of the prisoner. But even to herpleading he turned a deaf ear.While they were still speaking the heaven was opened, and there came forth a mighty animal, with manythousands of young ones, which drove the warder before it, and opening its mouth wide, swallowed Venus,its fair helper, at the same time exclaiming with a loud voice: \" I am born of woman, woman has propagatedmy seed, and therewith filled the earth Her soul is devoted to mine, and therefore I must be nourished withher blood.\" When the animal had said these words with a loud voice, it hastened into a certain chamber, andshut the door behind it; whither its voracious brood followed, drinking of the aforesaid incombustible oil,which they digested with the greatest ease, and thereby became even more numerous than they had beenbefore. This they continued to do until they filled the whole world. Then the learned men of that country were gathered together, and strove to discover the true interpretation ofall they had seen. But they were unable to agree until there came forward a man of venerable age, with snowylocks and silvery beard, and arrayed in a flowing purple robe On his head he wore a crown set with brilliantcarbuncles. His loins were girded with the girdle of life. His feet were bare, and his words penetrated to thedepth of the human soul. He mounted the tribune, and bade the assembly listen to him in silence, since hewas sent from above to explain to them the significance of what they had seen. When perfect silence prevailed, he delivered himself as follows: \"Awake, O man, and behold the light, lest the darkness deceive thee! The Gods revealed to me this matter ina profound sleep. Happy is the man who knows the great works of the Divine power. Blessed is he whoseeyes are opened to behold light where before they saw darkness. \"Two Stars are given by the Gods to man to lead him to great wisdom. Gaze steadily upon them, follow theirlights, and you will find in them the secret of knowledge. \"The bird Phoenix, from the south, plucks out the heart of the mighty beast from the east. Give the animalfrom the east wings, that it may be on an equality with the bird from the south. For the animal from the eastmust be deprived of its lion's skin, and lose its wings. Then it must plunge in the salt water of the vast ocean,and emerge thence in renovated beauty. Plunge thy volatile spirits in a deep spring whose waters never fail,that they may become like their mother, who is hidden therein, and born of three. \"Hungary is my native land, the sky and the stars are my habitation, the earth is my spouse. Though I mustdie and be buried, yet Vulcan causes me to be born anew. Therefore, Hungary is my native land, and mymother encloses the whole world.\" When all that were present had received these his sayings, he thus continued:\"Cause that which is above to be below; that which is visible, to be invisible; and that which is palpable, tobecome impalpable. Again, let that which is below become that which is above; let the invisible becomevisible, and the impalpable, palpable. Here you see the perfection of our Art, without any defect, ordiminution. But that in which death and life, destruction and resurrection dwell, is a round sphere, with whichthe goddess of fortune drives her chariot, and imparts the gift of wisdom to men of God. Its proper name hereupon earth, and for the human understanding, is 'All−in−All.'

Then singe its wings with fierce heat, and make it fall into the RedSea, and there be drowned. Then dry up the water with fire and air till the earth reappears, and you will have'All−in−All.'\"If you cannot find it in this way, look around upon the things that are in the world. Then you will find the 'All−in−All,' which is the attracting force of all metals and minerals derived from salt and sulphur, and twiceborn of Mercury. More I may not say about ' All−in−All,' since all is comprehended in all.\"My friends, blessed are ye if, by listening to the words of the wise, ye can find this great Stone, which haspower to cure leprous and imperfect metallic bodies and to regenerate them; to preserve men in health, andprocure for them a long life −− as it has hitherto kept the vital fire burning within me so long that I am wearyof life, and yearn to die. \"For His wisdom and mercy, and for the gracious Gift which He has bestowed upon me so long ago, I ambound to render God thanks, now and evermore. Amen.\"When the old man had thus spoken, he vanished from their sight.But all who had heard him went each man to his house, and meditated on his words by day and by night. Here follow the Twelve Keys of Basilius Valentinus, the Benedictine, with which we may open the doors of the knowledge of the Most Ancient Stone and unseal the Most Secret Fountain of Health. FIRST KEYLet my friend know that no impure or spotted things are useful for our purpose. For there is nothing in theirleprous nature capable of advancing the interests of our Art There is much more likelihood of that which is initself good being spoiled by that which is impure. Everything that is obtained from the mines has its value,unless, indeed, it is adulterated. Adulteration, however, spoils its goodness and its efficacy. As the physician purges and cleanses the inward parts of the body, and removes all unhealthy matter bymeans of his medicines, so our metallic substances must be purified and refined of all foreign matter, in orderto ensure the success of our task. Therefore, our Masters require a pure, immaculate body, that is untaintedwith any foreign admixture, which admixture is the leprosy of our metals.Let the diadem of the King be of pure gold, and let the Queen that is united to him in wedlock be chaste andimmaculate.If you would operate by means of our bodies, take a fierce grey wolf, which, though on account of its name itbe subject to the sway of warlike Mars, is by birth the offspring of ancient Saturn, and is found in the valleysand mountains of the world, where he roams about savage with hunger. Cast to him the body of the King, andwhen he has devoured it, burn him entirely to ashes in a great fire. By this process the King will be liberated;and when it has been performed thrice the Lion has overcome the wolf, and will find nothing more to devour Twelve KeysFIRST KEY7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"in him. Thus our Body has been rendered fit for the first stage of our work.Know that this is the only right and legitimate way of purifying our substance: for the Lion purifies himselfwith the blood of the wolf, and the tincture of its blood agrees most wonderfully with the tincture of the Lion,seeing that the two liquids are closely akin to each other. When the Lion's hunger is appeased, his spiritbecomes more powerful than before, and his eyes glitter like the Sun. His internal essence is now ofinestimable value for the removing of all defects, and the healing of all diseases. He is pursued by the tenlepers, who desire to drink his blood; and all that are tormented with any kind of sickness are refreshed withthis blood.For whoever drinks of this golden fountain, experiences a renovation of his whole nature, a vanishing of allunhealthy matter, a fresh supply of blood, a strengthening of the heart and of all the vitals, and a permanentbracing of every limb. For it opens all the pores, and through them bears away all that prevents the perfecthealth of the body, but allows all that is beneficial to remain therein unmolested.But let my friend be scrupulously careful to preserve the fountain of life limpid and clear. If any strangewater be mixed with it, it is spoiled, and becomes positively injurious. If it still retain any of the solventwhich has been used for its dissolution, you must carefully purge it off. For no corrosive can be of the leastuse for the prevention of internal diseases.When a tree is found to bear sour and unwholesome fruit, its branches must be cut off, and scions of bettertrees grafted upon it. The new branches thereupon become organically united to the trunk; but thoughnourished with its sap, they thence forward produce good and pleasant fruit.The King travels through six regions in the heavenly firmament, and in the seventh he fixes his abode. Therethe royal palace is adorned with golden tapestry. If you understand my meaning, this Key will open the firstlock, and push back the first bolt; but if you do not, no spectacles or natural eyesight will enable you tounderstand what follows. But Lucius Papirius has instructed me not to say any more about this Key. SECOND KEYIn the houses of the great are found various kinds of drink, of which scarcely two are exactly like each otherin odour, colour, or taste. For they are prepared in a great variety of different ways. Nevertheless they are alldrunk, and each is designed for its own special use. When the Sun gives out his rays, and sheds them abroadupon the clouds, it is commonly said that he is attracting water, and if he do it frequently, and thereby causerain, it is called a fruitful year. If it be intended to build a palace, the services of many different craftsmen must be employed, and a greatvariety of materials is required. Otherwise the palace would not be worthy the name. It is useless to use woodwhere stone is necessary.The daily ebb and flow of the sea, which are caused by the sympathetic influence of heavenly bodies, impartgreat wealth and blessing to the earth. For whenever the water comes rolling back, it brings a blessing with it.A bride, when she is to be brought forth to be married, is gloriously adorned in a great variety of preciousgarments, which, by enhancing her beauty, render her pleasant in the eyes of the bridegroom. But the rites ofthe bridal night she performs without any clothing but that which she was arrayed withal at the moment of herbirth.In the same way our bridal pair, Apollo and Diana, are arrayed in splendid attire, and their heads and bodies Twelve KeysSECOND KEY8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"are washed with various kinds of water, some strong, some weak, but not one of them exactly like another,and each designed for its own special purpose. Know that when the moisture of the earth ascends in the formof a vapour, it is condensed in the upper regions, and precipitated to the earth by its own weight. Thus theearth regains the moisture of which it had been deprived, and receives strength to put forth buds and herbs. Inthe same way you must repeatedly distil the water which you have extracted from the earth, and then againrestore it to your earth, as the water in the Strait of Euripus frequently leaves the shore, and then covers itagain until it arrives at a certain limit.When thus the palace has been constructed by the hands of many craftsmen, and the sea of glass has absolvedits course, and filled the palace with good things, it is ready for the King to enter, and take his seat upon thethrone. But you should notice that the King and his spouse must be quite naked when they are joinedtogether. They must be stripped of all their glorious apparel, and must lie down together in the same state ofnakedness in which they were born, that their seed may not be spoiled by being mixed with any foreignmatter.Let me tell you, in conclusion, that the bath in which the bridegroom is placed, must consist of two hostilekinds of matter, that purge and rectify each other by means of a continued struggle. For it is not good for theEagle to build her nest on the summit of the Alps, because her young ones are thus in great danger of beingfrozen to death by the intense cold that prevails there.But if you add to the Eagle the icy Dragon that has long had its habitation upon the rocks, and has crawledforth from the caverns of the earth, and place both over the fire, it will elicit from the icy Dragon a fieryspirit, which, by means of its great heat, will consume the wings of the Eagle, and prepare a perspiring bathof so extraordinary a degree of heat that the snow will melt upon the summit of the mountains, and become awater, with which the invigorating mineral bath may be prepared, and fortune, health, life, and strengthrestored to the King.THIRD KEYBy means of water fire may be extinguished, and utterly quenched. If much water be poured upon a little fire,the fire is overcome, and compelled to yield up the victory to the water. In the same way our fiery sulphurmust be overcome by means of our prepared water. But, after the water has vanished, the fiery life of oursulphurous vapour must triumph, and again obtain the victory. But no such triumph can take place unless theKing imparts great strength and potency to his water and tinges it with his own colour, that thereby he may beconsumed and become invisible, and then again recover his visible form, with a diminution of his simpleessence, and a development of his perfection. A painter can set yellow upon white, and red or crimson upon yellow; for, though all these colours arepresent, yet the latter prevails on account of its greater intensity. When you have accomplished the same thingin our Art, you have before your eyes the light of wisdom, which shines in the darkness, although it does notburn. For our sulphur does not burn, but nevertheless its brilliancy is seen far and near. Nor does it colouranything until it has been prepared, and dyed with its own colour, which it then imparts to all weak andimperfect metals. This sulphur, however, cannot impart this colour until it have first by persevering labourbeen prevailed upon to abjure its original colour. For the weaker does not overcome the stronger, but has toyield the victory to it. The gist of the whole matter lies in the fact that the small and weak cannot aid thatwhich is itself small and weak, and a combustible substance cannot shield another substance fromcombustion. That which is to protect another substance against combustion must itself be safe from danger.The latter must be stronger than the former, that is to say, it must itself be essentially incombustible. He, then,who would prepare the incombustible sulphur of the Sages, must look for our sulphur in a substance in whichit is incombustible −− which can only be after its body has been absorbed by the salt sea, and again rejected Twelve KeysTHIRD KEY9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"by it. Then it must be so exalted as to shine more brightly than all the stars of heaven, and in its essence itmust have an abundance of blood, like the Pelican, which wounds its own breast, and, without anydiminution of its strength, nourishes and rears up many young ones with its blood. This Tincture is the Roseof our Masters, of purple hue, called also the red blood of the Dragon, or the purple cloak many times foldedwith which the Queen of Salvation is covered, and by which all metals are regenerated in colour.Carefully preserve this splendid mantle, together with the astral salt which is joined to this sulphur, andscreens it from harm. Add to it a sufficient quantity of the volatility of the bird; then the Cock will swallowthe Fox, and, having been drowned in the water, and quickened by the fire, will in its turn be swallowed bythe Fox.FOURTH KEYAll flesh that is derived from the earth, must be decomposed and again reduced to earth; then the earthy saltproduces a new generation by celestial resuscitation. For where there was not first earth, there can be noresurrection in our Magistery. For in earth is the balm of Nature, and the salt of the Sages. At the end of the world, the world shall be judged by fire, and all those things that God has made of nothingshall by fire be reduced to ashes, from which ashes the Phoenix is to produce her young. For in the ashesslumbers a true and genuine tartaric substance, which, being dissolved, will enable us to open the strongestbolt of the royal chamber.After the conflagration, there shall be formed a new heaven and a new earth, and the new man will be morenoble in his glorified state than he was before.When the sand and ashes have been well matured and ripened with fire, the glass−blower makes out of itglass, which remains hard and firm in the fire, and in colour resembles a crystal stone. To the uninitiated thisis a great mystery, but not to the master whom long experience has familiarized with the process. Out of stones the master also prepares lime by burning which is very useful for our work− But before they areprepared with fire, they are mere stones. The stone must be matured and rendered fervent with fire, and thenit becomes so potent that few things are to be compared to the fiery spirit of lime.By burning anything to ashes you may gain its salt. If in this dissolution the sulphur and mercury be keptapart, and restored to its salt, you may once more obtain that form which was destroyed by the process ofcombustion. This assertion the wise of this world denounce as the greatest folly, and count as a rebellion,saying that such a transformation would amount to a new creation, and that God has denied such creativepower to sinful man. But the folly is all on their side. For they do not understand that our Artist does notclaim to create anything, but only to evolve new things from the seed made ready to his hand by the Creator.If you do not possess the ashes, you will be unable to obtain our salt; and without our salt you will not be ableto impart to our substance a bodily form; for the coagulation of all things is produced by salt alone.As salt is the great preserving principle that protects all things from decay, so the Salt of our Magisterypreserves metal from decomposition and utter annihilation. If their Balm were to perish, and the Spirit toleave the body, the body would be quite dead, and no longer available for any good purpose. The metallicspirit would have departed, and would have left its habitation empty, bare, and lifeless.Observe also, thou who art a lover of this Art, that the salt that is gained from ashes has great potency, andpossesses many concealed virtues. Nevertheless, the salt is unprofitable, until its inward substance has been Twelve KeysFOURTH KEY10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"extracted. For the spirit alone gives strength and life. The body by itself profits nothing. If you know how tofind this spirit, you have the Salt of the Sages, and the incombustible oil, concerning which many things havebeen written before my time. Although many philosophers Have sought for me with eagerness, Yet very few succeed at length In finding out my secret virtue. FIFTH KEYThe quickening power of the earth produces all things that grow forth from it, and he who says that the earthhas no life makes a statement which is flatly contradicted by the most ordinary facts. For what is dead cannotproduce life and growth, seeing that it is devoid of the quickening spirit. This spirit is the life and soul thatdwell in the earth, and are nourished by heavenly and sidereal influences. For all herbs, trees, and roots, andall metals and minerals, receive their growth and nutriment from the spirit of the earth, which is the spirit oflife. This spirit is itself fed by the stars, and is thereby rendered capable of imparting nutriment to all thingsthat grow, and of nursing them as a mother does her child while it is yet in the womb. The minerals arehidden in the womb of the earth, and nourished by her with the spirit which she receives from above. Thus the power of growth that I speak of is imparted not by the earth, but by the life−giving spirit that is in it.If the earth were deserted by this spirit, it would be dead, and no longer able to afford nourishment toanything. For its sulphur or richness would lack the quickening spirit without which there can be neither lifenor growth.Two contrary spirits can scarcely dwell together, nor do they easily combine. For when a thunderbolt blazesamidst a tempest of rain, the two spirits, out of which it is formed, fly from one another with a great shockand noise, and circle in the air, so that no one can know or say whither they go, unless the same has beenascertained by experience as to the mode in which these spirits manifest.Know then, gentle Reader, that life is the only true spirit, and that that which the ignorant herd look upon asdead may be brought back to permanent, visible, and spiritual life, if but the spirit be restored to the body −−the spirit which is supported by heavenly nutriment, and derived from heavenly, elementary, and earthlysubstances, which are also called formless matter. Moreover, as iron has its magnet which draws it with theinvisible bonds of love, so our gold has its magnet, viz., the first Matter of the great Stone. If you understandthese my words, you are richer and more blessed than the whole world.Let me conclude this chapter with one more remark. When a man looks into a mirror, he sees thereinreflected an image of himself. If, however, he try to touch it, he will find that it is not palpable, and that hehas laid his hand upon the mirror only. In the same way, the spirit which must be evolved from this Matter isvisible, but not palpable. This spirit is the root of the life of our bodies, and the Mercury of the Philosophers,from which is prepared the liquid water of our Art − the water which must once more receive a material form,and be rectified by means of certain purifying agents into the most perfect Medicine. For we begin with afirm and palpable body, which subsequently becomes a volatile spirit, and a golden water, without anyconversion, from which our Sages derive their principle of life. Ultimately we obtain the indestructiblemedicine of human and metallic bodies, which is fitter to be known to angels than to men, except such asseek it at God's hands in heartfelt prayer, and give genuine proofs of their gratitude by service rendered toHim, and to their needy neighbour.Hereunto I may add, in conclusion, that one work is developed from another. First, our Matter should be Twelve KeysFIFTH KEY11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"carefully purified, then dissolved, destroyed, decomposed, and reduced to dust and ashes. Thereupon preparefrom it a volatile spirit, which is white as snow, and another volatile spirit, which is red as blood. These twospirits contain a third, and are yet but one spirit. Now these are the three spirits which preserve and multiplylife. Therefore unite them, give them the meat and drink that Nature requires, and keep them in a warmchamber until the perfect birth takes place. Then you will see and experience the virtue of the gift bestowedupon you by God and Nature. Know, also, that hitherto my lips have not revealed this secret to any one, andthat God has endowed natural substances with greater powers than most men are ready to believe. Upon mymouth God has set a seal, that there might be scope for others after me to write about the wonderful things ofNature, which by the foolish are looked upon as unnatural. For they do not understand that all things areultimately traceable to supernatural causes, but nevertheless are, in this present state of the world, subject tonatural conditions. SIXTH KEYThe male without the female is looked upon as only half a body, nor can the female without the male beregarded as more complete For neither can bring forth fruit so long as it remains alone. But if the two beconjugally united, there is a perfect body, and their seed is placed in a condition in which it can yieldincrease. If too much seed be cast into the field, the plants impede each other's growth, and there can be no ripe fruit.But if, on the other hand, too little be sown, weeds spring up and choke it.If a merchant would keep a clear conscience, let him give just measure to his neighbour. If his measure andweight be not short, he will receive praise from the poor.In too much water you may easily be drowned; too little water, on the other hand, soon evaporates in the heatof the sun.If, then, you would attain the longed−for goal, observe just measure in mixing the liquid substance of theSages, lest that which is too much overpower that which is too little, and the generation be hindered. For toomuch rain spoils the fruit, and too much drought stunts its growth. Therefore, when Neptune has prepared hisbath, measure out carefully the exact quantity of permanent water needed, and let there be neither too littlenor too much.The twofold fiery male must be fed with a snowy swan, and then they must mutually slay each other andrestore each other to life; and the air of the imprisoned fiery male will occupy three of the four quarters of theworld, and make up three parts of the imprisoned fiery male, that the death−song of the swans may bedistinctly heard; then the swan roasted will become food for the King, and the fiery King will be seized withgreat love towards the Queen, and will take his fill of delight in embracing her, until they both vanish andcoalesce into one body.It is commonly said that two can overpower one, especially if they have sufficient room for putting forth theirstrength. Know also that there must come a twofold wind, and a single wind, and that they must furiouslyblow from the east and from the south. lf, when they cease to rage, the air has become water, you may beconfident that the spiritual will also be transmuted into a bodily form, and that our number shall prevailthrough the four seasons in the fourth part of the sky (after the seven planets have exercised power), and thatits course will be perfected by the test of fire in the lowest chamber of our palace, when the two shalloverpower and consume the third.For this part of our Magistery skill is needed, in order to divide and compound the substances aright, so that Twelve KeysSIXTH KEY12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the art may result in riches, and the balance may not be falsified by unequal weights. The sky we speak of isthe sky of our Art, and there must be justly proportioned parts of our air and earth, our true water and ourpalpable fire.SEVENTH KEYNatural heat preserves the life of man. If his body lose its natural heat his life has come to an end. A moderate degree of natural heat protects against the cold; an excess of it destroys life. It is not necessarythat the substance of the Sun should touch the earth. The Sun can heat the earth by shedding thereon its rays,which are intensified by reflection. This intermediate agency is quite sufficient to do the work of the Sun, andto mature everything by coction. The rays of the Sun are tempered with the air by passing through it so as tooperate by the medium of the air, as the air operates through the medium of the fire.Earth without water can produce nothing, nor can water quicken anything into growth without earth; and asearth and water are mutually indispensable in the production of fruit, so fire cannot operate without air, or airwithout fire. For fire has no life without air; and without fire air possesses neither heat nor dryness.When its fruit is about to be matured, the vine stands in greater need of the Sun's warmth than in the spring;and if the Sun shine brightly in the autumn, the grapes will be better than if they had not felt his autumnalwarmth.In the winter the multitude suppose everything to be dead, because the earth is bound in the chains of frost, sothat nothing is allowed to sprout forth. But as soon as the spring comes, and the cold is vanquished by thepower of the Sun, everything is restored to life, the trees and herbs put forth buds, leaves, and blossoms, thehibernating animals creep forth from their hiding places, the plants give out a sweet fragrance, and areadorned with a great variety of many coloured flowers; and the summer carries on the work of the spring, bychanging its flowers into fruit.Thus, year by year, the operations of the universe are performed, until at length it shall be destroyed by itsCreator, and all the dwellers upon earth shall be restored by resurrection to a glorified life. Then theoperations of earthly nature shall cease, and the heavenly and eternal dispensation shall take its place.When the Sun in the winter pursues his course far away from us, he cannot melt the deep snow. But in thesummer he approaches nearer to us, the quality of the air becomes more fiery, and the snow melts and istransmuted by warmth into water. For that which is weak is always compelled to yield to that which is strong.The same moderate course must be adopted in the fiery regimen of our Magistery. For it is all important thatthe liquid should not be dried up too quickly, and that the earth of the Sages should not be melted anddissolved too soon, otherwise your fishes would be changed into scorpions. If you would perform our taskrightly, take the spiritual water, in which the spirit was from the beginning, and preserve it in a closely shutchamber. For the heavenly city is about to be besieged by earthly foes. You must, therefore, strongly fortify itwith three impassable and well−guarded walls, and let the one entrance be well protected. Then light thelamp of wisdom and seek with it the gross thing that was lost, shewing only such light as is needed. For youmust know that the worms and reptiles dwell in the cold and humid earth, while man has his proper habitationupon the face of the earth; the bodies of angels, on the other hand, not being alloyed with sin or impurity, areinjured by no extreme either of heat or cold. When man shall have been glorified, his body will become likethe angelic body in this respect. If we carefully cultivate the life of our souls, we shall be sons and heirs ofGod, and shall be able to do that which now seems impossible. But this can be effected only by the drying upof all water, and the purging of heaven and earth and all men with fire Twelve KeysSEVENTH KEY13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"EIGHTH KEYNeither human nor animal bodies can be multiplied or propagated without decomposition; the grain and allvegetable seed, when cast into the ground, must decay before it can spring up again; moreover, putrefactionimparts life to many worms and other animalculae. The process of augmentation and quickening is mostlyperformed in [the] earth, while it is caused by spiritual seed through the other elements. The farmer's wife knows that she cannot hope to obtain chickens except through the decomposition of theegg. If bread is placed in honeys and suffered to decay, ants are generated; worms are bred in the putrefyingbodies of men, horses, and other animals; maggots are also developed by the decay of nuts, apples, and pears.The same thing may be observed in regard to vegetable life. Nettles and other weeds spring up where no suchseed has ever been sown. This occurs only by putrefaction. The reason is that the soil in such places is sodisposed, and, as it were, impregnated, that it produces these fruits, which is a result of the properties ofsidereal influence; consequently the seed is spiritually produced in the earth, and putrefies in the earth, and bythe operation of the elements generates corporeal matter according to the species of Nature. Thus the starsand the elements may generate new spiritual, and, ultimately, new vegetable seed, by means of putrefaction.But man cannot create new seed; for it is not in his power to order the operation of the elements and theessential influences of the stars. By natural conditions, however, new plants are generated simply throughputrefaction. This fact is not noticed by the farmer, simply because it is a thing that he has always been usedto, and for which he is unable to find an explanation. But you who should know more than the vulgar herd,must search into the causes of things, and endeavor to understand how the process of generation andresuscitation is accomplished by means of decomposition, and how all life is produced out of decay.Each element is in its turn decomposed and regenerated by that which is contained in it. For you should knowthat every element contains the three others. In air, for instance, there is fire, water, and earth. This assertionmay appear incredible, but it is nevertheless true. In like manner, fire includes air, water, and earth, sinceotherwise it could generate nothing. Water contains fire, air, and earth; for if it did not, there could be nogrowth. At the same time, each element is distinct, though each contains the others. All this is: found bydistillation in the separation of the elements.In order to rationally prove this to you, who are investigating the separation of Nature. and purpose tounderstand the division of the elements, lest you should think my words inventions, and not true, I tell youthat if you distil earth, you will find that, first of all, there is an escape of air, which, in its turn, alwayscontains fire, as they are both of a spiritual essence, and exercise an irresistible mutual attraction. In the nextplace, there issues water from the earth, and the earth, in which is the precious salt, remains by itself at thebottom of the vessel.When water is distilled, air and fire issue from it, and the water and material earth remain at the bottom.Again, when the invisible part of elementary fire is extracted, you get water and earth by themselves. Nor canany of the three other elements exist without air. It is air that gives to earth its power of production, to fire itspower of burning, to water its power of generating fruit. Again, air can consume nothing, nor dry up anymoisture, without that natural heat which must be imparted to it by fire. For everything that is hot and drycontains fire. From these considerations we conclude that no element can exist without the others, and that inthe generation of all things there is a mingling of the four elements. He who states the contrary in no wiseunderstands the secrets of Nature, nor has he investigated the properties of the elements. For if anything is tobe generated by putrefaction, the process must be as follows: The earth is first decomposed by the moisturewhich it contains; for without moisture, or water, there can be no true decay; thereupon the decomposedsubstance is kindled and quickened by the natural heat of fire: for without natural heat no generation can takeplace. Again, if that which has received the spark of life, is to be stirred up to motion and growth, it must be Twelve KeysEIGHTH KEY14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"acted upon by air. For without air, the quickened substance would be choked and stifled in the germ. Hence itmanifestly appears that no one element can work effectually without the aid of the others, and that all mustcontribute towards the generation of anything. Thus their quickening cooperation takes the form ofputrefaction, without which there can be neither generation, life, nor growth. That there can be no perfectgeneration or resuscitation without the co−operation of the four elements, you may see from the fact thatwhen Adam had been formed by the Creator out of earth, there was no life in him, until God breathed intohim a living spirit. Then the earth was quickened into motion. In the earth was the salt that is, the Body; theair that was breathed into it was mercury or the Spirit, and this air imparted to him a genuine and temperateheat, which was sulphur, or fire. Then Adam moved and by his power of motion, shewed that there had beeninfused into him a life−giving spirit. For as there is no fire without air so neither is there any air without fire.Water was incorporated with the earth Thus living man is an harmonious mixture of the four elements; andAdam was generated out of earth, water, air, and fire, out of soul, spirit, and body, out of mercury, sulphur,and salt.In the same way, Eve, our common mother, was created; for her body was built up and formed out of Adam'sbody − a fact which I wish you particularly to notice.To return again to putrefaction, O seeker of the Magistery and devotee of philosophy, know that, in likemanner, no metallic seed can develop, or multiply, unless the said seed, by itself alone, and without theintroduction of any foreign substance, be reduced to a perfect putrefaction.The putrefaction of metallic seed must, like that of animal and vegetable seed, take place through theco−operation of the four elements. I have already explained that the elements themselves are not the seed.But it ought by this time to be clear to you that the metallic seed which was produced by the combinedoperation of heavenly, sidereal, and elementary essences, and reduced into bodily form, must, in due course,be corrupted and putrefied by means of the elements.Observe that this seed contains a living volatile spirit. For when it is distilled, there issues from it first a spirit,and then that which is less volatile. But when by continued gentle heat, it is reduced to an acid, the spirit isnot so volatile as it was before. For in the distillation of the acid the water issues first, and then the spirit. Andthough the substance remains the same, its properties have become very different. It is no longer wine, buthas been transmuted by the putrefaction of gentle heat into an acid. That which is extracted with wine or itsspirit, has widely different properties and powers from that which is extracted with an acid. For if the crystalof antimony be extracted with wine or the spirit of wine, it causes vomiting and diarrhoea, because it is apoison, and its poisonous quality is not destroyed by the wine. But if it be extracted with a good distilled acid,it furnishes a beautiful extract of a rich colour. If the acid be removed by means of the St. Mary's Bath, andthe residuum of yellow powder washed away, you obtain a sweet powder which causes no diarrhoea, but isjustly regarded as a marvellously beneficial medicine.This excellent powder is dissolved in a moist place into a liquid which is profitably employed as a painlessagent in surgery.Let me sum up in few words what I have to say. The substance is of heavenly birth, its life is preserved by thestars, and nourished by the four elements; then it must perish, and be putrefied; again, by the influence of thestars, which works through the elements, it is restored to life, and becomes once more a heavenly thing thathas its habitation in the highest region of the firmament. Then you will find that the heavenly has assumed anearthly body, and that the earthly body has been reduced to a heavenly substance. Twelve KeysEIGHTH KEY15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"NINTH KEYSaturn, who is called the greatest of the planets, is the least useful in our Magistery. Nevertheless, it is thechief Key of the whole Art, howbeit set in the lowest and meanest place. Although by its swift flight it hasrisen to the loftiest height, far above all other luminaries, its feathers must be clipped, and itself brought downto the lowest place, from whence it may once more be raised by putrefaction, and the quickening caused byputrefaction, by which the black is changed to white, and the white to red, until the glorious colour of thetriumphant King has been attained. Therefore, I say that though Saturn may seem the vilest thing in theworld, yet it has such power and effficacy that if its precious essence, which is excessively cold, be reducedto a metallic body by being deprived of its volatility, it becomes as corporeal as, but far more fixed than,Saturn itself. This transmutation is begun, continued, and completed with Mercury, sulphur, and salt. Thiswill seem unintelligible to many, and it certainly does make an extraordinary demand upon the mentalfaculties; but that must be so because the substance is within the reach of everyone, and there is no other wayof keeping up the divinely ordained difference between rich and poor. In the preparation of Saturn there appears a great variety of different colours; and you must expect to observesuccessively black, grey, white, yellow, red, and all the different intermediate shades. In the same way, theMatter of all the Sages passes through the several varieties of colour, and may be said to change itsappearance as often as a new gate of entrance is opened to the fire.The King shares his royal dignity with noble Venus, and appears in splendid state, surrounded by all thedignitaries of his court. Before him is borne a beautiful crimson banner, in which there is an embroideredrepresentation of Charity in green garments. Saturn is the prefect of the royal household, and in front of himAstronomy bears a black standard, with a representation of Faith in yellow and red garments.Jupiter is the Grand Marshal, and is preceded by a banner of grey colour, borne by Rhetoric, and adornedwith a variegated representation of Hope.Mars is at the head of military affairs, and executes his office with a certain fiery ardour. Geometry carriesbefore him a crimson banner, on which you may behold Courage in a crimson cloak. Mercury holds theoffice of Chancellor; Arithmetic is his standard bearer, and his standard is of many colours; on it may beobserved the figure of Temperance in a many coloured robe.The Sun is Vice−Regent, and is preceded by Grammar, bearing a yellow banner, on which Justice isrepresented in a golden robe Though Venus seems to cast him into the shade by the gorgeous magnificence ofher appearance, he really possesses more power in the kingdom than she.Before the Moon, Dialectic bears a shining silver banner, with the figure of Prudence wrought into it insky−blue, and because the husband of the Moon is dead, he has transferred to her his task of resisting thedomination of Queen Venus. For among all these there is enmity, and they are all striving to supplant eachother. Indeed, the tendency of events is to give the highest place to the most excellent and the most deserving.For the present state of things is passing away, and a new world is about to be created, and one Planet isdevouring another spiritually, until only the strongest survive.Let me tell you allegorically that you must put into the heavenly Balance the Ram, Bull, Cancer, Scorpion,and Goat. In the other scale of the Balance you must place the Twins, the Archer, the Water−bearer, and theVirgin. Then let the Lion jump into the Virgin's lap, which will cause the other scale to kick the beam.Thereupon, let the signs of the Zodiac enter into opposition to the Pleiads, and when all the colours of theworld have shewn themselves, let there be a conjunction and union between the greatest and the smallest, andthe smallest and the greatest.

For which let us laud and praise God. TENTH KEYIn our Stone, as composed by me and by those who have long preceded me, are contained all elements, allmineral and metallic forms, and all the qualities and properties of the whole world. In it we find mostpowerful natural heat, by which the icy body of Saturn is gently transmuted into the best gold. It contains alsoa high degree of cold, which tempers the fervent heat of Venus, and coagulates the mercury, which is therebyalso changed into the finest gold. All these properties slumber in the substance of our Stone, and aredeveloped, perfected, and matured by the gentle coction of natural fire, until they have attained their highestperfection. If the fruit of a tree be plucked before it is ripe, it is unfit for use; and if the potter fail to hardenhis vessels in the fire, they cannot be employed for any good purpose. In the same way you must exercise considerable patience in preparing our Elixir, if it is to become all thatyou wish it to become. No fruit can grow from a flower that has been plucked before the time. He who is intoo great a hurry, can bring nothing to perfection, but is almost sure to spoil that which he has in hand.Remember, then, that if our Stone be not sufficiently matured, it will not be able to bring anything to maturity.The substance is dissolved in a bath, and its parts reunited by putrefaction. In ashes it blossoms. In the formof sand all its excessive moisture is dried up. Maturity and fixity are obtained by living fire. The work doesnot actually take place in the Bath of St. Mary, in horse− dung, in ashes, or in sand, but the grades andregimen of the fire proceed after the degrees which are represented by these The Stone is prepared in anempty furnace, with a threefold line of circumvallation, in a tightly closed chamber. It is subjected tocontinued coction, till all moisture and clouds are driven off, and the King attains to indestructible fixedness,and is no longer liable to any danger or injury, because he has become unconquerable. Let me express mymeaning in a somewhat different manner. When you have dissolved your earth with your water, dry up thewater with its own inward fire. Then the air will breathe new life into the body, and you will have that whichcan only be regarded as that Great Stone which in a spiritual manner pervades human and metallic bodies,and is the universal and immaculate Medicine, since it drives out that which is bad, and preserves that whichis good, and is the unfailing corrective of all imperfect or diseased substances. This Tincture Is of a colourintermediate between red and purple, with something of a granite hue, and its specific weight is veryconsiderable.Whoever gains possession of this Stone, should let his whole life he an expression of his gratitude towardsGod in practical kindness towards his suffering brethren, that after obtaining God's greatest earthly gift, hemay hereafter inherit eternal life. Praise be unto God everlastingly for this His inestimable gift. ELEVENTH KEYThe eleventh Key to the Knowledge of the augmentation of our Stone, I will put before you in the form of aparable. There lived in the East a gilded knight, named Orpheus, who was possessed of immense wealth, and hadeverything that heart can wish.

This he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister, and was instant Twelve KeysTENTH KEY17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in prayer to God both by day and by night, that the curse might be taken from him.One night, when he was buried in a deep sleep, there came to him a certain winged messenger, namedPhoebus, who touched his feet, which were very hot, and said: \" Thou noble knight, since thou hast wanderedthrough many cities and kingdoms, and suffered many things at sea, in battle, and in the lists, the heavenlyFather has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer: Take blood from thyright side, and from the left side of thy spouse. For this blood is the heart's blood of your parents, and thoughit may seem to be of two kinds, vet, in reality, it is only one. Mix the two kinds of blood, and keep themixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise Masters There that which is generated will benourished with its own flesh and blood, and will complete its course of development when the Moon haschanged for the eighth time If thou repeat this process again and again, thou shalt see children's children, andthe offspring of thy body shall fill the world.\"When Phoebus had thus spoken, he winged his flight heavenward. In the morning the knight arose and didthe bidding of the celestial messenger, and God gave to him and to his wife many children, who inheritedtheir father's glory, wealth, and knightly honours from generation to generation.If you are wise, my son, you will find the interpretation of my parable. If you do not understand it, ascribe theblame not to me, but to your own ignorance. I may not express myself more explicitly; indeed, I haverevealed the matter in a more plain and straightforward manner than any of my predecessors. 1 haveconcealed nothing; and if you will but remove the veil of ignorance from your eyes, you will behold thatwhich many have sought and few found.TWELFTH KEYIf an athlete know not the use of his sword, he might as well be without it; and if another warrior that isskilled in the use of that weapon come against him, the first is like to fare badly. For he that has knowledgeand experience on his side, must carry off the victory. In the same way, he that possesses this tincture, by the grace of Almighty God, and is unacquainted with itsuses, might as well not have it at all. Therefore this twelfth and last Key must serve to open up to you theuses of this Stone. In dealing with this part of the Subject I will drop my parabolic and figurative style, andplainly set forth all that is to be known. When the Medicine and Stone of all the Sages has been perfectlyprepared out of the true virgin's milk, take one part of it to three parts of the best gold purged and refined withantimony, the gold being previously beaten into plates of the greatest possible thinness. Put the whole into asmelting pot and subject it to the action of a gentle fire for twelve hours, then let it be melted for three daysand three nights more.For without the ferment of gold no one can compose the Stone or develop the tinging virtue. For the same isvery subtle and penetrating if it be fermented and joined with a ferment like unto itself: then the preparedtincture has the power of entering into other bodies, and operating therein. Take then one part of the preparedferment for the tinging of a thousand parts of molten metal, and then you will learn in all faith and truth that itshall be changed into the only good and fixed gold. For one body takes possession of the other; even if it beunlike to it, nevertheless, through the strength and potency added to it, it is compelled to be assimilated to thesame, since like derives origin from like.Whoever uses this as a medium shall find whither the vestibules of the palace lead, and there is nothingcomparable to the subtlety thereof. He shall possess all in all, performing all things whatsoever which arepossible under the sun.

It is a stone, and no stone; therein Nature alone operates. Afountain flows from it. The fixed part submerges its father, absorbing it, body and life, until the soul isreturned to it.

Thus thefather by means of Vulcan was produced from the spirit. Body, soul, and spirit exist in both, whence thewhole matter proceeds. It proceeds from one, and is one matter. Bind together the fixed and the volatile; theyare two, and three, and yet one only. If you do not understand you will attain nothing. Adam was in a bath −−wherein Venus found her like, which bath the aged Dragon had prepared when his strength was desertinghim. There is nothing, says the Philosopher, save a double mercury; I say that no other matter has beennamed; blessed is he who understands it. Seek therein, and be not weary; the result justifies the labour. A short Appendix and clear Resumption of the foregoing Tractconcerning the Great Stone of the Ancient SagesI, Basil Valentine, brother of the Benedictine Order, do testify that I have written this little book, wherein,after the manner of the Ancients, I have philosophically indicated how this most rare treasure may beacquired, whereby the true Sages did prolong life unto its furthest limit. But, notwithstanding that my conscience doth bear me witness in the sight of the Most High, before whom allconcealed matters are laid bare, that I have written no falsehood, but have so exposed the truth thatunderstanding men can require no further light (that which is laid down in the theoretical part being borne outand confirmed by the practice of the Twelve Keys), yet have I been impelled by various considerations todemonstrate by a shorter way what I have written in the said treatise, and thus cast further light thereon,whereby also the lover of the desired wisdom may obtain an increased illumination for the fulfilment of hisdesire There are many who will consider that I am speaking too openly, and will hold me answerable for thewickedness that they think will follow, but let them rest assured that it will be sufficiently difficult,notwithstanding, for any thick−headed persons to find what they seek herein. At the same time the mattershall be made clear to the elect. Hearken then, thou follower of truth, to these my words, and so shalt thoufind the true way !Behold, I write nothing more than I am willing to hold by after my death and resurrection! Do thou faithfullyand simply lay to heart this shorter way, as hereinafter exhibited, for my words are grounded in simplicity,and my teaching is not confused by a labyrinth of language.I have already indicated that all things are constituted of three essences − namely, mercury, sulphur, and salt− and herein I have taught what is true. But know that the Stone is composed out of one, two, three, four, andfive. Out of five − that is, the quintessence of its own substance. Out of four, by which we must understandthe four elements. Out of three, and these are the three principles of all things. Out of two, for the mercurialsubstance is twofold. Out of one, and this is the first essence of everything which emanated from the primalfiat of creation.But many may by all these discourses be rendered doubtful in mind as to what they must start with, and as tothe consequent theory. So I will, in the first place, speak very briefly concerning Mercury, secondly Twelve KeysConcerning the First Matter of the Philosophical Stone19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"concerning Sulphur, thirdly concerning Salt; for these are the essence of the Matter of our Stone.In the first place, you must know that no ordinary quicksilver is useful, but our quicksilver is produced fromthe best metal by the spagyric art, pure, subtle, clear, and glistening, like a spring, pellucid even as crystal,free from all dross. Hence make water or combustible oil. For Mercury was in the beginning water, andherein all the Sages agree with my dictum and teaching In this oil of Mercury dissolve its own Mercury, fromwhich the water in question was made, and precipitate the Mercury with its own oil. Then we have a twofoldmercurial substance; but you must know that gold must first be dissolved in a certain water, as explained inmy second Key, after the purification described in the first Key, and must be reduced into a subtle calx, as ismentioned in the fourth Key. Next, this calx must be sublimated by the spirit of salt, again precipitated, andby reverberation reduced into a subtle powder. Then its own sulphur can more easily enter into its substance,and have great friendship with the same, for they have a wondrous love towards each other. Thus you havetwo substances in one, and it is called Mercury of the Sages, but is yet a single substance, which is the firstferment.Now follows concerning SulphurSeek your Mercury in a similar metal. Then when you know how to extract the metal from its body bypurification, the destruction of the first Mars, and reverberation, without the use of any corrosive (the methodof doing which I have indicated in my third Key) −− you must dissolve that Mercury in its own blood out ofwhich it was made before it became fixed (as indicated in the sixth Key); and you have then nourished anddissolved the true lion with the blood of the green lion. For the fixed blood of the Red Lion has been madeout of the volatile blood of the Green Lion; hence, they are of one nature, and the unfixed blood again rendersthat which is volatile fixed, and the fixed blood in its turn fixes that which is volatile, as it was before itssolution. Then foster it in gentle heat, until the whole of the mercury is dissolved, and you obtain the secondferment (by nourishing the fixed sulphur with that which is not fixed), as all Sages unite with me intestifying. Afterwards this becomes, by sublimation with spirit of wine, of a blood−red colour, and is calledpotable gold. Now I will also give my Opinion respecting the Salt of the SagesThe effect of \"salt\" is to fix or volatilize, according as it is prepared and used. For the spirit of the salt oftartar, if extracted by itself without any addition, has power to render all metals volatile by dissolution andputrefaction, and to dissolve quick or liquid silver into the true mercury, as my practical directions shew. Salt of tartar by itself is a powerful fixative, particularly if the heat of quicklime be incorporated with it. Forthese two substances are singularly efficacious in producing fixation.In the same way, the vegetable salt of wine fixes and volatilizes according to the manner of its preparation. Itsuse is one of the arcana of Nature, and a miracle of the philosopher's art. When a man drinks wine, there maybe gained from his urine a clear salt, which is volatile, and renders other fixed substances volatile, causingthem to rise with it in the alembic. But the same does not fix. If a man drank nothing but wine, yet for all thatthe salt obtained from his urine would have a different property from that gained out of the lees of wine. Forit has undergone a chemical change in the human body, having become transmuted from a vegetable into ananimal salt −− just as horses that feed on oats, straw, etc., change those vegetable substances into flesh andfat, while the bee prepares honey out of the precious juices of flowers and herbs.The great change which takes place in these and other substances is due to putrefaction, which separates andtransmutes the constituent elements. Twelve KeysNow follows concerning Sulphur20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The common spirit of salt, which is extracted according to the direction given in my last declaration, if therebe added to it a small quantity of the \"spirit of the dragon,\" dissolves, volatilizes, and raises together withitself in the alembic, gold and silver; just as the \"eagle,\" together with the spirit of the dragon (which is foundin stony places), before the spirit is separated from its body, is much more powerful in producing fixationthan volatility.This I also say, that if the spirit of common salt be joined to the spirit of wine, and distilled together with it, itbecomes sweet, and loses its acidity. This prepared spirit does not dissolve gold bodily, but if it be poured onprepared calx of gold, it extracts the essence of its colour and redness. If this be rightly done, it reduces thewhite and pure moon to the colour of that body from which it was itself extracted. The old body may alsoreceive back its former colour through the love of alluring Venus, from whose blood it, in the first instance,derived its origin.But observe, likewise, that the spirit of salt also destroys the moon, and reduces it to a spiritual essence,according to my teaching, out of which the \" potable moon \" may be prepared. This spirit of the moonbelongs to the spirit of the sun, as the female answers to the male, by the copulation or conjunction of thespirit of mercury or its oil.The spirit lies hid in mercury, the colour you must seek in sulphur, and their coagulation in salt; then youhave three things which together are capable of once more generating a perfect thing. The spirit is fermentedin the gold with its own proper oil; the sulphur is found in abundance in the property of precious Venus. Thiskindles the fixed blood which is sprung from it, the spirit of the salt of the Sages imparts strength andfirmness, though the spirit of tartar and the spirit of urine together with true vinegar, have great virtue. For thespirit of vinegar is cold, and the spirit of lime is intensely hot, and thus the two spirits are found to be ofopposite natures. I do not here speak according to the customary manner of the Sages. But I must not say tooopenly how the inner gates are to be unlocked.In bidding farewell, let me impart to you a faithful word. Seek your material in a metallic substance. Thenceprepare mercury. This ferment with the mercury of its own proper sulphur, and coagulate them with salt.Distil them together; mix all according to weight. Then you will obtain one thing, consisting of elementssprung from one thing. Coagulate and fix it by means of continuous warmth. Thereupon augment and fermentit a third time, according to the teaching of my two last Keys, and you will find the object and goal of yourdesire. The uses of the Tincture are set forth plainly in my twelfth Key. Thanks be to God.As a parting kindness to you, I am constrained to add that the spirit may also be extracted from black Saturnand benevolent Jupiter. When it has been reduced to a sweet oil, we have a means of robbing the commonliquid quicksilver of its vivacity, or rendering it firm and solid, as is also set forth in my book. PostscriptWhen you have thus obtained the material, the regimen of the fire is the only thing on which you need bestowmuch attention. This is the sum and the goal of our search. For our fire is a common fire, and our furnace acommon furnace. And though some of my predecessors have left it in writing that our fire is not commonfire, I may tell you that it was only one of their devices for hiding the mysteries of our Art. For the material iscommon, and its treatment consists chiefly in the proper adjustment of the heat to which it is exposed.The fire of a spirit lamp is useless for our purpose. Nor is there any profit in \"horse−dung,\" nor in the otherkinds of heat in the providing of which so much expense is incurred. Twelve KeysThanks be to God.21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Neither do we want many kinds of furnaces. Only our threefold furnace affords facilities for properlyregulating the heat of the fire. Therefore do not let any babbling sophist induce you to set up a great variety ofexpensive furnaces. Our furnace is cheap, our fire is cheap, and our material is cheap − and he who has thematerial will also find a furnace in which to prepare it, just as he who has flour will not be at a loss for anoven in which it may be baked. It is unnecessary to write a special book concerning this part of the subject.You cannot go wrong, so long as you observe the proper degree of heat, which holds a middle place betweenhot and cold. If you discover this, you are in possession of the secret, and can practise the Art, for which theCREATOR of all nature be praised world without end. AMEN. Twelve KeysThanks be to God.22"}]
