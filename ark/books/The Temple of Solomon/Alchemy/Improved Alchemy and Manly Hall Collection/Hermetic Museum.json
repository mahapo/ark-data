Its design was apparently to supply in a compact form a representativecollection of the more brief and less ancient alchemical writers; in this respect, itmay be regarded as a supplement to those large storehouses of Hermetic learningas the Theatrum Chemicum, and that scarcely less colossal of Mangetus, theBibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, which are largely concerned with the cream of thearchaic literature, with the works of Gerber and the adepts of the school ofArabia, with the writings attributed to Hermes, with those of Raymond Lully,Arnold de Villa Nova, Bernard Trevisan, and others.THE HERMETIC MUSEUM would also seem to represent a distinctive school inAlchemy, not altogether committed to certain modes and terminology whichderived most of their prestige from the past, and sufficiently enigmatical as it was,still inclined to be less obscure and misleading than was the habit of the oldermasters. For it belonged to a period which had inherited a bitter experience of thefailures, impostures, and misery surrounding the Magnum Opus and its mysticalquest, which was weary of unequipped experiment, weary of wandering\"multipliers\", and pretentious \"bellows-blowers,\" while it was just being awakenedto the conviction that if Alchemy were true at all, it was not be be learned frombooks, or, at least, from any books which had hitherto been written on thesubject. Running through all the tracts which are comprised in the followingvolumes, the reader will recognize traces of a central claim in alchemicalintitiation-- that the secrets, whatever they were, must be understood as theproperty of a college of adepts, pretending to have subsisted from time almostimmemorial, and revealing themselves to the select and few, while the literature,large as it is, appears chiefly as an instrument of intercommunication betweenthose who knew. At the same time, it may also be regarded as a sign and omen tothe likely seeker, an advertisement that there was a mystery, and that he must gofurther who would unravel it.While the treatises now translated are for the most part anonymous, as befitsveiled masters, the literary reader will remember the name of John de Meungconnects the allegorical \"Romance of the Rose\" with the parables of Alchemy;Flamel will be familiar to all Hermetic students as the most celebrated of theFrench adepts; the saintly name of Basil Valentine, investigator of the propertiesof antimony, will not even now be unhonoured by the chemist; EireneausPhilalethes, equally revered and unknown by all devout Spagyrites, is supposed tohave been the most lucid of hierorphants, and the \"Open Entrance\" to be theclearest of all his works. Helevetius was an illustrious chemist, and Michael MaierThe Hermetic Museum - Preface to the English Editionhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/waitpref.htm (1 of 2) [27/05/2004 23:01:50]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"is a person of some repute in the Rosicrucian controversy. Micheal Sendivogius wasan uninstructed disciple of Alexander Seton, and the \"New Chemical Light,\" whichhe published and claimed as his own, was really the work of his master, who hasbeen called the chief martyr of Alchemy. It may be added in this connection thatsome critics have cast doubt upon the genuine nature of the \"Testament of JohnCremer,\" and it is true that the annals of Westminster do not include an abbot ofthat name.It should be understood that the writer of this brief note must not be accreditedwith the translation which it seeks to introduce. That is the work of a gentlemanwho is said to have had a life-long acquaintance with alchemical literature; it hasbeen subjected to a searching revision at the hands of the present editor, who mayhimself be permitted to claim some experience in Hermetic antiquities; theversion as it stands does not uncreditably represent both the spirit and the senseof the original without the original's prolixity. While affording to the modernstudent of secret doctrines an unique opportunity for acquiring in English acollection of alchemical writers, ths edition of the HERMETIC MUSEUM also claimsconsideration at the hands of the historian as a contribution of real value to theearly history of chemistry.ARTHUR EDWARD WAITEThe Hermetic Museum - Preface to the English Editionhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/waitpref.htm (2 of 2) [27/05/2004 23:01:50]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Index PREFACE TO THE ORIGINALEDITIONADDRESSED TO THE CANDIL READER[Anonymous]It would be unjust to double, most gentle reader, that of all the arts invented forthe use of life by the reason of man, that of Alchemy is the most noble andglorious. For all philosophers exclaim, as it were, with one voice, albeit in manylanguages, that this art is not only true, but (after the Divine Law by which oursouls are saved) the best and most magnificent gift imposed on man by God; andthat it should therefore be invesigated with all zeal and with the greatest pains.But as good wine needs no praise, so neither does this art need a herald; for itstruth is undoubted, and its utility in human life universally acknowledged, andshewn forth, not only in the Art of Medicine, in Pharmacy, and many othersciences, but especially in the Art of Transmuting Metals, is so clearly andperspicuously demonstrated, that it in no way requires to be adorned by thesplendour of oratory, or tricked out with the device of language. I will not enlargeupon the blessing which the elaboration of minerals and metals has bestowed onour race. I merely point it out, but refrain from discussing it at length. Differentmen devote themselves to the study of this science from different motives. Thephilosopher is impelled by the love of truth, and the thirst after wisdom. Hedelights in knowledge for its own sake. He welcomes every elegant and copioustreatise on the marvels of Nature, to the glory of Almighty God. This is asufficiently generous reward for a philosopher. He has it at his command the mosteffectual means of becoming rich, if he would only use them. But he is fired by thelove of philosophy, and does not care for the mocking grandeur of fortune. Sothought the Sages of the Saracens, Egyptians, Arabs, and Persians; for when theywere oppressed by tyrants, and violently driven into exile, they protected andsupported themselves by means of their Art, and, though protected and supportedthemselves by means of their Art, and, through their knowledge of thetransmutation of metals, they had at their command, not only sufficient to liveupon, but all the comforts and pomp of life, and thus practically demonstratedthat they could obtain all that gold and silver could give. Concerning this truetransmutation of metals, which is accomplished only by the Elixer or Stone of thePhilosophers, we here propose to speak. This art is set forth in a series of treatisesby different authors, which appeared several years ago, and, like the presentvolume, was entitled \"A Museum of Hermes.\" But many writers having discussed thesubject, and treated it from various points of view (so that one writes more clearlythan the other, and each throws light on the other's meaning), some of my friends,The Hermetic Museum - Preface to the Original Editionhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/origpref.htm (1 of 2) [27/05/2004 23:01:51]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"who are adepts in this Art, urged me to add to the former collection certaintreatises supplementary of those already given. For though that former collectioncontained the most select writings on the subject, yet is was not as complete as itmight have been, nor was it calculated to furnish to the reader in full measure theeagerly expected fruit of his study. To this wish of my friends I have all the morereadily submitted, because its fulfilment must redound to the advantage of thestudent. I have, therefore, enlarged the collection with several most selecttreatises, and caused it to be adorned with many engravings. I was most stronglyimpelled to undertake this task by the consideration, viz., that thorugh fraudulentmachinations of greedy imposters many false, so-called chemical treatises havebeen put forward, in which there is not a single spark of truth, and that very manyhave been, and still are being deceived by them. These dupes, by reading thisbook, in which the Magistry of the Stone is most clearly and plainly set forth, andinto which no error or forgery has been admitted, will be secured against theimposture of that wicked and mercenary band who delight in fraud. For in thisbook all errors are shewn up and dispelled. For this reason I confidently offer thisvolume to the sons of knowledge, in order that while they may think upon andinvestigate the secret workings of Nature, they may obtain from it nothing but thetruth, and gain a clear insight into the very nature of things. In this alone consiststhe perfection of the entire most Holy Art of Philosophy. Only let them go forwardalong the Royal Road which Nature prescribes in all her operations. As to the rest, Iheartily bet the friends of this Art to give a kindly reception to the presentvolume, and when, through the Will of God, by constant labour, they have putashore in the desired haven of philosophy, after the nature of philosophers toexclude all that are unworthy from the knowledge thereof, and, being mindful ofcharity towards their needy neighbor in the fear of God (without any vainostentation), to sing eternal praises to the Good and Thrice Great God for thisWonderful and Divine Gift (without any abuse thereof) in a silent and devoutlyjoyful heart.The Hermetic Museum - Preface to the Original Editionhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/origpref.htm (2 of 2) [27/05/2004 23:01:51]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Index Next The Golden TractThe Golden TractConcerning The Philosopher's Stone.The Author's Preface to the Art-loving Reader.Worthy reader, and true enquirer into the secrets of nature, marvel not that in theold age of this world, when it seems to have one foot already in the grave, I havedetermined to write this tract, although all libraries ale already full of books onthis subject -- of which, however, the greater part are false, and wear merely therouge and powder of philosophy. I have written it not for my own pleasure, but foryour advantage, that, by pointing to the foundation of truth, I might lead you backfrom the pathless wilderness into the right way -- which is certainly for your owninterest. As far as I am concerned, I have long known all that I seek to know inregard to this matter, and have no need of many books, seeing that during the lasttwenty-two years I have read and re-read all the works that fell into my hands --including numerous manuscripts, as well as many printed volumes.In this my tract you will find the subject set forth, and the true solution given, notonly theoretically, but also from a practical and allegorical point of view, with aclearness and lucidity such as I believe to be almost unparalleled in any previousphilosophical treatise. In quoting, I have always been careful to give the exactreference, so that you may look out the passage for yourself, and by diligentlyconsidering it, sharpen your understanding. I could more easily have composed thistreatise, and made myself known to the Brethren of the Golden Cross, if I had leftout those references; but for your sake I decided otherwise. Do not wonder that Iconceal my name, and refuse to appear to you face to face. I have come forward,not for the sake of any paltry glory, or of worldly praise, but to do you good.Moreover, my teachers, even the true philosophers, advised me not thus to risk mylife for the sake of obtaining a high place in the world's esteem, to expose myselfto greedy robbers or to give occasion for many crimes by the prostitution of thisprofound secret. No doubt the gentle reader has learned by the works ofSendivogius that whenever he shewed himself openly to the powerful, he went inconstant fear of his life. Experience teaches that many philosophers who gave nothought to their personal safety, have been killed and deprived of their tincture bygreedy and powerful robbers; and it stands to reason that any one going aboutwith a great treasure in his hand, must fall a prey to brigands. Sendivogiusconcealed his name by an anagram. Thus also a short time ago another philosopherand Brother of the Golden Cross, whose real name has long been familiar to me,concealed it beneath an anagram, and made himself known to his friends by anenigmatical designation. Why then should I place myself at the mercy of thisimpure world? Permit me rather, dear friend, to follow the example of the sages,and leave the rest to the thrice good and great God, who will make my true selfknown to you in good time, if it be for the glory of His name, and for your and myThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (1 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"good. Do not be eager to enquire after my name. For even if you should get toknow it, or become personally acquainted with me, you would have to restsatisfied with the contents of this tract. For I have solemnly promised twophilosophers- Bernard, Count of Trevisan, and Neigens -- that I will not betray toany one more than has been revealed in this book. Neither be anxious to askwhether I actually possess this precious treasure. Ask rather whether I have seenhow the world was created; whether I am acquainted with the nature of theEgyptian darkness; what is the cause of the rainbow; what will be the appearanceof the glorified bodies at the general resurrection; what is the most indeliblecolour. Of you that rightly understand this little book, I will enquire whether youhave seen that great salt sea, without any corrosion, raise a sufficiency of themoisture of all nature to the summits of the highest mountains. Tell me wherethere is sulphur out of sulphur, and mercury out of mercury -- or where sulphursprings from mercury, and again mercury from sulphur. When was there placedbefore your eyes the idea of most fervent love, the male and the femaleembracing each other so closely that they could no more be torn asunder, butthrough unsearchable love became one? If you understand what I am alluding to,and have performed the experiment with your own hands, and seen it with yourown eyes, I welcome you as fellow partakers of the mystery, and have no dearerwish than to enjoy your familiar intercourse -- for which reason I have also sentforth into the world this little tract.If any one complain of the difficulty of our Art, let him know that in itself it isperfectly simple, and can present no obstacle to those who love God, and are heldworthy by Him of this knowledge. If any one blame me for setting forth the truthsof this Art too plainly and clearly, so as to render it possible for any one to gain aknowledge thereof, I answer that I have indeed explained them with sufficientlucidity for those who are worthy and foreordained of God, but that the unworthycan derive no profit from them. To some foolish and shallow persons I have severaltimes expounded this Art in the simplest manner, and even word for word, butthey despised it only, and would not believe me that there is exhibited in our worka twofold resurrection of the dead. Our Art, its theory as well as its practice, isaltogether a gift of God, Who gives it when and to whom He elects: it is not of himthat wills, or of him that runs, but simply through the mercy of God. Though I haddiligently studied this Art for 17 or 18 years, yet I had, after all, to wait for God'sown time, and accept it as a free gift. No one need doubt the truth or certainty ofthis Art. It is as true and certain, and as surely ordained by God in nature, as it isthat the sun shines at noontide, and the moon shews her soft splendour at night.But I must conclude this preface, and gird myself for writing the tract itself. Butye, beloved Brethren of the Golden Cross, who are about to learn how to enjoy anduse this most precious gift of God in secret, do not remain unknown to me, and ifye know me not, be sure that the faithful will be approved and their faith becomeknown through the Cross, while security and pleasure overshadow it. God be withus, Amen!The Golden TractConcerning The Stone Of The Philosophers.ANCIENT as well as modern philosophers, most beloved reader, and devoted seekerafter true wisdom, when through the grace of God they had reached the goal oftheir desires, have endeavoured to make their discovery known to their fellowinquirers in all parts of the world -- not only because they wished to inform themthat the thrice great and good God had enlightened their minds, blessed theThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (2 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"labours of their hands, and shewn to them the greatest and most profound secretof earthly wisdom (for which benefit all praise, honour, and glory are justly due toHim) -- but also that they might afford assistance to beginners in the Art, bywhich, with God's permission, they too might attain to the knowledge of this mostholy mystery. Such men there have been in all countries. Amongst the EgyptiansHermes Trismegistus holds the highest place; then come Chaldaeans, Greeks,Arabs, Italians, Gauls, Englishmen, Dutchmen, Spaniards, Germans, Poles,Hungarians, Hebrews, and many others. Though the aforementioned Sages wroteat different times, and in different languages, yet their works exhibit somarvellous an agreement, that any true philosopher may easily see that all theirhearts had been gladdened by God in the discovery of this stone, and that they allhad performed this work with their own hands. Now, as the truth of their views isperceived by their agreement, so the disagreement of certain others marks themas false philosophers. For, not knowing the foundation of this glorious Art, andmaking up fanciful theories out of their own heads, they exhibit their ignorance toall.The aforesaid agreement exists in regard to the Matter, its solution, its weight,and the regulation and increase of the fire.As concerns the Matter, it is one, and contains within itself all that is needed. Outof it the artist prepares whatever he wants. Its \"Birth is in the sand,\" as thephilosopher Anastratus says in \"The Crowd\": \"Nothing is more precious than the redsand of the sea; it is the distilled moisture of the Moon joined to the light of theSun, and congealed.\" That only this one substance is required is attested byAgadmon in the same book. He says: \"Know that unless you take my body [sulphur]without the spirit [mercury] ye will not obtain what ye desire. Cease to think ofmany things. Nature is satisfied with one thing, and he who does not know it islost.\"In the same way Arnold, of Villa Nova, writes in his \"Flower of Flowers\"; \"Our stoneis made out of one thing, and with one thing.\" To the same effect he says to theKing of Naples: \"All that is in our stone is essential to it, nor Does it need anyforeign ingredient. Its nature is one, and it is one thing.\" And Rosinus says: \"Knowthat the object of your desire is one thing, out of which all things are made.\"Lilium: \"You have need only of one thing, which at any stage of our experiment canbe changed into another nature.\" So Geber says in his \"Summary\": \"Our stone isone, one medicine, to which we add nothing, from which we take nothing away,only removing that which is superfluous.\" Again, Scites in \"The Crowd\" says: Theessence of this Art is in like manner a certain one thing which is stronger and moreexalted than all other things, and is called the most powerful acid, because itchanges gold into a clear spirit, without which there is neither whiteness, norblackness, nor redness. When the spirit is joined to the body it becomes one withit; and yet again becomes a spirit, and is saturated with the spiritual andunchangeable tincture, and thus again by combination receives a bodily tincturewhich cannot be annihilated. If you place the body without the acid over She fire,it will be burnt and destroyed.\" From these words of Scites the reader mightconclude, that not one but two things, namely a body and an acid (as he calls it)are required, and that a liquid must be combined with a dry thing lest the drything should be consumed by the fire, in order that by the moist thing it may bepreserved from such combustion. To such a conclusion, if rightly accepted, I gladlysubscribe. But from the above mentioned philosophical dicta (however obscurelyworded they may be) it is clearer than day that the substance of our Blessed Stoneis one (although different sages call it by different names), and that Nature hasThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (3 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"made it ready to the hand of the adept, having willed this one thing, and no otherthing in all the world, to be the material of the Stone. This Matter lies before theeyes of all; everybody sees it, touches it, loves it, but knows it not. It is gloriousand vile, precious and of small account, and is found everywhere. TheophrastusParacelsus, in his book concerning \"The Tincture of Physical Things,\" calls it theRed Lion, which is named by many, but known by few. Hermes, in the first chapterof his Treatise, calls it \"Quick Silver coagulated in its innermost chambers.\" In the\"Rosary of the Philosophers\" it goes by the name of Salt. But, to be brief, ourMatter has as many names as there are things in the world; that is why the foolishknow it not. Foolish I call those who, without any previous knowledge of Natureand her properties, undertake to learn this Art, and come to it (as Arnold says) likethe ass to the crib, not knowing for what they open their mouths. Hence it is wellsaid by Geber, in the \"Sum of Perfection\": \"He who has no elementary knowledge ofNature is far from a proper appreciation of this Art.\" And Rosarius says: \"I advise noone to approach this Art unless he knows the principle and the regimen of Nature:if he be acquainted with these, little is wanting to him except one thing, nor needhe put himself to a great expense, since the stone is one, the medicine is one, thevessel one, the rule one, the disposition one.\" Yet this one substance is so dividedby the operation of Nature, and the skill of the Artist, that it is transmuted intoour White Eagle, nor does the splendour of the sun illuminate more abundantly thespagyric matter with its beams; or, as Basilius Valentinus hath it, that, \"thence isborn a spirit white as snow, and another spirit red as blood, which two spirits arecontained in a third hidden thing.\" Hence King Aros well says: \"Our medicine iscomposed out of two things having one essence, namely, through the mercurialunion of a solid and a liquid, a spiritual and a corporeal, a cold and a moist, awarm and a dry, and in no other way can it be made.\" And Richard the Englishmansays: \"The stone is one, the medicine one, which, however, according to thephilosophers is called Rebis (Two-thing), being composed of two things, namely abody and spirit [red or white]. But over this many foolish persons have gone astray,explaining it in divers ways.\" Rebis is two things, and these two things are onething, namely, water joined to a body, by which the body is dissolved into a spirit,that is, mineral water, out of which it was first made; and this body and spiritmake up one mineral water, which is called Elixir, that is to say, ferment; for thenwater and spirit are one thing, of which is composed a tincture and medicine forpurging all bodies. And thus, according to the philosophers, we have the nature ofsulphur and mercury above ground, while underground they become gold andsilver. Bernard, Count of Trevisan and the March, says: \"Our work is performed bymeans of one root, and two crude mercurial substances, drawn and extracted froma mineral, pure and clear, being conjoined by the heat of friendship, as thismatter requires, and carefully cooked until the two things become one thing,\" &c.Basilius Valentinus (Lib. Nat. et Supernat., c. 4) says: \"I will make this known tothee in all truth for the love of God], that the root of philosophic sulphur, which isa heavenly spirit, is united in the same material with the root of the spiritual andsupernatural mercury, and the principle of spiritual salt -- out of which is made theStone, and not out of several things. That universal thing, the greatest treasure ofearthly wisdom, is one thing, and the principles of three things are found in one,which has power to change all metals into one. The three things are the true spiritof mercury, and the soul of sulphur, united to spiritual salt, and dwelling in onebody; they are dragon and eagle, king and lion, spirit and body, etc.\"In this way our prepared material is also called male and female, active andpassive. So Zimon says, in \"The Crowd\" : \"Know that the secret of the work consistsin male and female, i.e., an active and a passive principle. In lead is found theThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (4 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"male, in orpiment the female. The male rejoices when the female is brought to it,and the female receives from the male a tinging seed, and is coloured thereby.\"And Diomedes says: \"Join the male child of the 'red servant' to the fragrant spouse,and they will produce the object of our Art. But you must not introduce anyforeign matter, neither dust, nor any other thing. The conception will then beperfect, and a true son will be born. Oh, how precious is the nature of the 'redservant,' without whom nothing can be effected !\" Others call it quicksilver, ormercury, and sulphur, or fire, as Roger Bacon says, in the third chapter of his\"Mirror\" : \"Out of sulphur and mercury are all metals, and nothing adheres to them,neither is joined to them, or transmutes them, but what is of them. And thus wemust accept mercury and sulphur as the matter of the stone.\" So also Menabadussays: \"He who joins quicksilver to the body of magnesia, and the woman to theman, extracts the secret essence by which bodies are coloured.\" Lullius in his\"Codicil\" says : \"The property of our mercury is to be coagulated by its sulphur\".And, in the Practice of his Testament: \"The silver is a flowing moisture, floatingabove and preserving the whole from combustion.\"Others use the names, body, spirit, and soul. Thus Arnold, in his \"Flower ofFlowers,\" says: \"The Sages have affirmed that our Stone is composed of body, soul,and spirit, and they have spoken truly. For the imperfect part they have comparedto a body, because it is weak. The water they have called spirit, and truly,because it is spirit. The ferment they have termed soul, because it gives life to theimperfect body (which before was dead), and makes its form more beautiful.\"Again, he says: \"A spirit is never joined to a body but by the interposition of a soul.For the soul is the medium between body and spirit, joining them together.\"Morienus says: \"The soul quickly enters its own body -- but if you tried to join it toa foreign body, you would labour in vain.\" And Lilium says: \"Body, soul, and spiritmake up one thing, which has all in itself, and to which nothing is added.\"But why should we mention and explain all the names by which our Matter isdesignated? We will be content with the foregoing, seeing that they are the mostcommon and the most germane to our purpose. In the following pages, afterendeavouring to find where our substance lies hid, and where it may be obtained,we will say some words about the mode of its dis solution, that being after all theprincipal object of our inquiry. And first, as concerns the search after our Matter,we should remember that in the beginning, when there was nothing but Himself,God, who is infinite in wisdom, created two classes of things, namely, those thatare in heaven, and those that are under heaven. The heavenly things (about whichwe need not here speak at length) are the heavens themselves, and the dwellers inheaven The things that are under the heavens were created out of four elements,and are commonly divided into three classes. Those that live and feel hold the firstplace, and are called animals. The second class are the plants, that grow out ofthe earth, but do Dot feel. The third class, that of the minerals, has its originunderground. These three classes include all that (beneath the moon) has beencreated out of the elements. They can never become more or less, and God hasbound each thing to its own genus and species, so that it cannot change from onegenus to another. If any one tried to make a man or a tree out of a stone, or amonkey or lead out of a plant, or an animal or a plant out of lead, he would beprevented from doing so by the eternal order of the Great King. If such a thingwere possible, all classes of natural objects could be changed into one. But,because such a change would put an end to the world, the Ruler of the Universedoes not permit it. Nay, what is more, He not only restricted everything to its ownkind, but gave each created thing its own seed, by which it might be propagatedThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (5 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"after its own manner -- always remaining in its own class, and not overstepping thebounds of some other species. If any one wished to change a man into a horse, anapple into a lettuce, a diamond or any other jewel into gold, he would make anenormous mistake. For such an attempt would be against the nature of sublunarthings. And as it was in the beginning so it shall be in the end, when the Almighty,who in the beginning said \"Let it be,\" shall say \"Let it perish.\" But among thosethings which have a common substance, seed, and elementary composition, it isnot difficult to accomplish an amelioration and improvement, by the purificationof their matter. So we may see a man of a clear and subtle mind attain to a higherdegree of human excellence than others who are less gifted. This difference arisesfrom the superior purity and subtlety of his spiritual substance, which again has itsorigin in a rectified and well constituted body. Thus also we see one horse excelthe strength and speed of another; and it is the same with all kinds of livingbeings. A like rule holds good to an even greater degree in regard to plants andtrees -- with trees, by transplanting, grafting, and kindred methods well familiarto gardeners; while as to other vegetable natures, we are taught by dailyexperience how plants and flowers of the same kind differ from each other inglory, in beauty, in fragrance, and savour. Of this cloves and tulips afford a strikinginstance. Into how many different species have these flowers been developed; andeven these new developments are being made more beautiful from day to day, andit is universally admitted that never were there such fine and fragrant flowersbefore. What am I to say about metals which have a common substance, namely,quicksilver, digested and consolidated by the power of sulphur ? Concerning thiscommon substance, Richard the Englishman has the following words: \"Nature haselaborated all kinds of fusible things by a natural process out of mercury, and thesubstance of its sulphur, because it is the property of quicksilver to beconsolidated by steam, as by the heat of white and red sulphur which does notburn.\"The same view is expressed by Arnold (pt. I., cp. ii.): \"Quicksilver is theelementary form of all things -fusible; for all things fusible, when melted, arechanged into it, and it mingles with them because it is of the same substance withthem. Such bodies differ from quicksilver in their composition only so far as itselfis or is not free from the foreign matter of impure sulphur.\" Similarly Rosinus (AdSaratantam) says: \"The substance of all metals in the heart of the earth issolidified and imperfect quicksilver; for by the quickening heat of sulphur differentmetals (according to the different varieties of sulphur) are generated in the earth;their original substance is one and the same, and is modified only by a greater orsmaller external influence.\" Hence we see daily how busily Nature is occupied inbringing them to mortification and perfection. Now the perfection of metals, andthe final intention of Nature in regard to them, is gold. For all metals shew thatNature has done something for them towards ultimate perfection, no metal is sobase as not to contain a single grain of gold or silver Nature would always changequicksilver that has within itself its own sulphur into gold, if she were not oftenhindered by some outward impediment, viz., impure, foetid, and combustiblesulphur. In most cases gold is dug out pure, clear, free from dross, and unmixedwith any other metals. But most frequently a large quantity of foreign sulphurmingles with the quicksilver, and thus prevents its perfect development; and,according to the variety of that sulphur, different kinds of metals are generated,as Aristotle says (4. Meteor.): \"If the quicksilver be of a good substance but thesulphur impure and combustible, it changes the quicksilver into brass. If thequicksilver be stony, impure, and earthy, and the sulphur not pure, it becomesiron. Tin seems to have good and pure quicksilver; but the sulphur is bad and notThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (6 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"well mixed. Lead has gross, bad, and ill-smelling quicksilver, and is thus notproperly coagulated.\"That retarding, combustible, and foetid sulphur is not the true fire that fashionsmetals; but quicksilver has its own sulphur in itself, which is sufficient for thepurpose of fashioning it, as Bernard, Count of Trevisan, says: \"Some believe that inthe generation of metals, a sulphuric substance is introduced from without; but,on the contrary, it is clear that in the working of Nature sulphur is alreadyenclosed in the mercury. Yet it has no power in it except through the moving heat,by which the said sulphur is changed, and with it two other qualities of themercury. In this way, then, Nature generates by means of this sulphur thedifferent kinds of metals in the veins of the earth, according to the diversity ofdegrees and alterations.\" For in metals, according to Arnold (pt. I., cp. iii.), \"thereis a two-fold superfluity: one that is enclosed in the innermost nature of thequicksilver, and got there at the first mingling of the metal; the other does notbelong to the essence of it, is external to it, and corruptible. To remove theformer is a difficult task; the latter may be removed without any difficulty. Thecombustible sulphur is taken away by being subjected to the action of fire, or isdestroyed by foreign bodies; but the other, which is in the quicksilver, is preservedby it from combustion.\" But again, that inward sulphur which fashions thequicksilver belonging to it, and matures it towards perfection, is either pure orimpure, combustible or incombustible. Impure sulphur hinders the digestion of thequicksilver, which cannot be transformed into gold until that which does notbelong to it has been entirely separated from it; but the pure, incombustible,fixed sulphur remains with it, and then at length it passes either into gold orsilver, according as the sulphur is either white or red. This internal sulphur isnothing but mature mercury, and the most advanced part of the quicksilver. andfor this reason the quicksilver receives it so kindly, as being of its own essence,while it rejects the other which is foreign to it. So Richard the Englishman says, inhis ninth chapter: \"The more simple the sulphur is, the more readily does itcombine with simple and pure mercury, and the more intimately they combine themore precious is the metal which is produced. \"But such sulphur, says Avicenna, \"isnot found on earth, except in so far as it exists in metallic bodies through theaction of the sun and moon. In the sun it exists in a perfect state, because there itis better digested and decocted.\" According to Richard, in his twelfth chapter, thered sulphur of the philosophers exists in the sun on account of its greaterdigestion, and the white sulphur in the moon on account of its inferior digestion.\"Since, then, the substance of the metals is one and common to all, and since thissubstance is (either at once, or after laying aside in course of time the foreign andevil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of gradual digestion) changed by thevirtue of its own indwelling sulphur into GOLD. which is the goal of all the metals,and the true intention of Nature -- we are obliged to admit, and freely confessthat in the mineral kingdom, as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms,Nature seeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection, and a gradualapproximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence.I thought it would be best, O friendly searcher of Nature, to discuss the mattermore in detail, in order that you might the more readily know and make use of thesubstance of our Stone! For if you attempted to produce our Stone out of ananimal substance you would fail, because the two things belong to differentnatural orders. For the Stone is a mineral, but you would be trying to fashion it outof an animal substance. \"But nothing,\" says our Richard, in his first chapter, \"canbe got out of a thing which is not in it. Therefore every species, every genus, everyThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (7 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"natural order, is naturally developed within its own limits, bearing fruit after itsown kind, and not within some other essentially different order: everything inwhich seed is sown must correspond to its own seed.\" And Basil. Valentinus says:\"Consider and know, my friend, that you must not select an animal soul for thisyour purpose. For flesh and blood were given by the Creator to animals, and areproper to animals, and from them animals are formed and brought forth.\" For thisreason I wonder at those who wish to be regarded as great adepts, and yet look forthe substance of the stone in female menstruums, the seminal fluid, eggs, hairs,urine, and similar things, and are not ashamed to fill so many volumes with theirvain and worthless recipes, and to deceive the ignorant with such foolish, futile,and useless speculations. Roger, in his \"Mirror\" (cp. iii.), expresses his amazementat the folly of these men when he exclaims: \"How strange that any sane personshould look for what he wants in the animal and vegetable worlds, which havenothing whatever to do with the object of his search, while the mineral world isquite as ready to his hand. It is incredible that any philosopher should establish hisart on such a remote foundation, except indeed by way of allegory.\" \"For our Stone(says Basil) is not made of combustible things. Verily that Stone and the matterthereof are safe from all such violence, therefore cease to seek it in the animalkingdom; for Nature herself could not find it there.\" Again, whoever hopes to findit in the vegetable world, as, for instance, in trees, herbs, flowers, is quite asmuch mistaken as he who would change an animal into a stone. Plants and trees,with all that they produce, may be consumed by fire, and leave nothing behind butthe dust out of which they are made, and the salt which at the first creation oftheir species they received from Nature. Let no one be misled by the confidentassertions of those who pretend that they can produce the Philosopher's Stone outof wheat, or out of wine. These persons fancy they understand the meaning of acertain passage in the writings of Raymond Lullius, but they exhibit the depth oftheir folly by the assumption of profound wisdom, and thus only deceivethemselves and others. I do not deny that some excellent solvents, indispensableboth to the physician and to the chemist, are obtained from these sources; but I domost positively deny that the Philosopher's Stone can be prepared, or its seedelicited, from them, since the Creator has ordained that nothing should overstepthe bounds of the natural order to which it was originally assigned. Hence everytrue disciple of wisdom may gather that the substance of the Stone is to beobtained neither in the animal nor in the vegetable world, seeing that both arecombustible. We must therefore look for it among incombustible things, that is tosay, in the mineral world, and thence only can we prepare it. Since, then, theStone of the Wise is mineral, and there are different kinds of minerals, as stones(including clay and the different varieties of earth), salts, general minerals, andmetals, we must further ask, in which of all these it is contained. We may at onceeliminate stones, because they contain no fusible mercury and cannot be melted,dissolved, or divided into their component parts on account of the large quantityof foreign sulphur and earthly substance which cleave to them.Nor will the wise investigator of Nature's secrets expect to find the substance ofthe Blessed Stone in salts, alums, or similar minerals. In them he meets with asharp, corroding, destructive spirit, but mercury and sulphur, as understood byphilosophers, he would vainly look for. General minerals, like magnesia, bismuth,antimony, etc., can never under any circumstances become metals; how, then,can the substance of this Stone, which is the essential perfection of all metals andminerals, be obtained from them? Moreover, they have nothing in common withmetals, but do burn corrode, and destroy them: -- how then can they be the meansof their improvement?The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (8 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Hear what Richard the Englishman has to say on this head (cp. x.) : \"The lesserminerals cannot become metals -- First, because they were not generated out ofthe elementary substance of metals, which is quicksilver. But seeing that theirgeneration differs from the generation of metals in form, and substance, andcomposition, they can never become metals, because things belonging to the samespecies have the same elementary substance, and spring from the same seed. Butthe lesser minerals are not generated from mercury, as we learn from Aristotle andAvicenna. If they were to become metals, they would have to change into theelementary substance of metals. And, since such a transformation is beyond thepower of chemistry, they can never become metals; that is to say, they can neverbe the substance of the Stone. Second, since the lesser minerals cannot be comethe elementary substance of metals, which is mercury, they can never reach themiddle and the end of the same development, namely, metals and the tincture.But because the properties of the lesser minerals are foreign to those of themetals, although they may have some of the virtues of minerals, yet on the wholethey are less excellent and are liable to be injured by fire. Therefore the nature ofmetals delights not in them, but repels them, while it receives that which is suitedto it. For this reason they are foolish who bring in so many foreign speculations forthe purpose of imposing upon their hearers; for the things they put forward arealtogether unlike metals and can never receive nor impart their nature.\"The student must not suffer himself to be misled by the language occasionallyemployed with regard to salts by the philosophers whom we have quoted, as, forinstance, when it is said, in the mystic language of our Sages, \"He who workswithout salt will never raise dead bodies\"; or, again, when he reads in the book ofSoliloquies,\" He who works without salt draws a bow without a string.\" For youmust know that these sayings refer to a very different kind of salt from thecommon mineral. This you may see from the following passage of the \"Rosary ofthe Philosophers\": \"The salt of metals is the Philosopher's Stone; for our Stone iswater congealed in gold and silver; it is hostile to fire and may be dissolved intothe water of which it is composed after its kind.\" And that the \"congealed water\"of the Sages does not mean ordinary water may be gathered from the followingwords of Geber (lib. forn., cp. xix.): \"Seek to resolve the sun and the moon intotheir dry water, which the vulgar call mercury.\" The Sages have also describedtheir earth under the name of salt -- e.g., in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet,\" whereit is said: \"That which is left at the bottom of the distilling vessel is our salt -- thatis to say, our earth.\" And in the \"Allegories of the Wise\" one bursts forth into thesewords: \"Mark well that those bodies which flow forth from our bodies are salts andalums.\" At times they call the medicine itself \"Salt,\" as in the following passage ofthe \"Scale\" : \"The virtue of the second water is to exalt earth into its own mineralsalt, as though assimilating it by its own strength.\" And Arnold, in his workconcerning the \"Preservation of Youth,\" (lib. iii.) says: \"This prepared salt has greatvirtue in preserving youth. The Sages have compared it to the natural heat ofhealthy youth. The Stone itself has sometimes been called by the wise the AnimalStone, sometimes the Mineral Secret, on account this similitude; sometimes theEverlasting Remedy, or the Water of Life. The whole preparation may be reducedto the purest drinking water, like other things that have the same properties.\"From the aforesaid it clearly appears that we are forbidden both by the teachingof the Sages and by the nature of the thing to suppose that the Stone can be madeout of the lesser minerals.We should next enquire more carefully whether the matter of our Stone may beobtained from the intermediate minerals -- like bismuth, antimony, magnesia, andso on. They are certainly often mentioned in this connection by the Sages. ThusThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (9 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Senior says, in a certain passage: \"If yellow orpiment has not the power ofcoagulating mercury our Magistery can never attain its goal.\" Thomas de Aquinasrecommends us to take \"our antimony or black earth,\" while Parmenides, in \"TheCrowd,\" says: \"Take quicksilver and coagulate it in the body of magnesia, orcorruptible sulphur.\" But in all such passages these terms are used metaphorically;it is not meant that the Great Stone can ever be made out of such substances. Theorpiment and magnesia of the Sages are not the common minerals, but thesubstance which in other passages is called the Agent, the Lion, the King, Sulphur,and by many other names. They call it orpiment because it gives a deeper andmore brilliant colouring to gold; magnesia because of the excellence and greatnessof that which is gained from it; antimony, with Thomas Aquinas, on account of thebrilliant blackness which it assumes after solution. As a matter of fact, when theStone has assumed its ebony colour they are in the habit of comparing it to allblack things.But it may be said that some of these intermediate minerals are, as a matter offact, composed of mercury and sulphur, and may become metals, e.g., magnesiaunites with lead and tin, and antimony not only mingles with metals, but alsoproduces a lead not very different from natural lead. Moreover, it is asserted thatmany persons of high and low degree have actually seen gold made of theseminerals. It is further said that as these minerals are composed of mercury andsulphur (and can by chemical means be reduced to them), and are therefore of acommon origin with the metals, the substance of the Stone may also be elicitedfrom them. But, in the first place, we must draw a distinction between the variousminerals of this class, namely those which contain mercury, and those whichhardly ever contain it. Those that are full of mercury are of greater account,since, by means of our Medicine, their mercury may be transformed into gold andsilver; and, their nature being partly metallic, they may well be called half metals.But the rest, which have no mercury, are of no use for our purpose. But forasmuchas, on account of the gross and combustible sulphur which is in them, even thefirst are very far indeed from the metallic goal, so they cannot be taken for thesubstance of our Stone, which should be pure and perfect mercury combined withpure, subtle, and incombustible sulphur. That they are most impure and deeplyinfected with the grossness of their sulphur, may be easily seen by the test of achemical experiment. One of them (zinetum) might, by reason of its weight andbrilliance, be taken at first sight for pure mercury by the careless; but whenbrought to the test of fire it is consumed with a smoke, like that of sulphur.Bismuth, on the other hand, is not even fusible by fire -- such is its earthygrossness and impurity. Antimony, again, can be purged by a chemical process, andreduced to a very white and beautiful regulus. As we gaze upon it in this purifiedstate, it seems difficult to believe that it may not be transformed into somethingglorious. Hence it is natural that some self-conceited people should have supposedthat the Stone may be prepared from it. But however much antimony is purged ofits blackness, it still retains its grossness, hardness, and sulphuric properties; it cannever become malleable (like the metals), and therefore, in spite of its numerousaffinities, cannot be regarded as a metal. Moreover, it has gross and impuremercury; and its sulphur is combustible. Ye, then, who would be greatphilosophers and do deceive many with your voluminous writings, in which you putthis mineral forward as the essence of the universal remedy -- I ask you again andagain to reconsider your opinion, and to mark the saying of Arnold, that \"it isfoolish to seek in a thing that which it does not contain.\" He also says, in hisCommentary on \"The Crowd\" : \"The philosopher's stone is a pure substance.\" Again,Lullius in his \"Last Testament,\" observes: \"Our tincture is nothing but pure fire.\"The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (10 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"There is an expression to the same effect in his \"Vade Mecum\" : \"It is a subtle spiritwhich tinges bodies and cleanses them of their leprous infirmities.\" But thismineral (like all the rest, without a single exception) is so gross and impure that itcan only be cleansed by the mediation of our tincture. Therefore, the substance ofour Great Stone cannot be elicited from it, since (Richard, cp. I.) nothing can beobtained from a body which does not exist therein. What shall we say of vitriol,which misleads many by its wonderful qualities, especially as some part of itchanges into copper, and itself has the power of transforming if on into copper? Asa matter of fact, it is the elementary substance of copper, and when this mineralvapour (or aeriform mercury) finds in the mineral veins of the earth a place whereits bitter, acid, salt, and venereal sulphur lies hid, it immediately amalgamateswith it into a metal. But since the quantity of the aforesaid sulphur greatlyexceeds that of the mercury, when the pure is separated from the impure, and thecombustible from the incombustible by the segregating office of Nature, themercury itself is changed into a greenish inferior substance. When common sulphuris added to copper, and the whole brought in contact with fire (for art can do byintense heat in a few moments what it takes the gentle heat of Nature a long timeto accomplish) it corrodes the copper, and changes it into vitriol, and, inproportion to the quantity of the sulphur, the vitriol assumes a richer or faintercolour; whence it comes that some vitriol contains more copper and some less. Iniron, too, there is gross sulphur; hence it is corroded by vitriol which seeks itsmercury (the mercury of iron being very like that of vitriol), and (the mercurybeing joined to the sulphur) the iron becomes pure copper.It should be carefully noticed that the acid spirit of vitriol is generated fromsulphur; for the smell of sulphur is perceived in the spirit of vitriol, and the spiritof sulphur, like the spirit of vitriol, has power to change into vitriol. Since, then,this corrosive sulphur is hid in vitriol, and since it contains so small a quantity ofimpure mercury, we may be sure that it cannot be the object of our search. In thiswe agree with Alphidius, who says: \"Take heed, my son, and eschew dead bodies,and stones; in these things there is no true way of procedure, for their lifepreserves not, but destroys. Such are salts, orpiments, arsenic, magnesia, bismuth,tutty, and the like.\" And Arnold (Flos Flor.) says: \"The reason of these mistakes isthat the four spirits, viz., orpiment, salt of ammonia, mercury, and sulphur, arenot the seed of perfect or imperfect metals (except, of course, mercury andsulphur by themselves).\"But from these last words of Arnold it might be inferred that common mercury andquicksilver are the substance of the stone, seeing that these are referred to thefour spirits, and that sulphur is supposed to consolidate the mercury. But I answer,with Richard the Englishman, in his eleventh chapter, that it does not really do so.For every kind of common sulphur is repugnant to metals, as the Sage says: \"Indeedyou must know that sulphur comes forth out of the fatness of the earth, and isthickened in the minera by gentle heat; when it becomes hard it is called sulphur.\"Now there are two kinds of sulphur, the living and the combustible. Quick sulphuris the active principle of metals, and, when purged from all foreign matter, is theMatter of our Stone. But the common combustible variety is not the Matter ofmetals or of our Stone; rather, it is injurous to them. Common, combustiblesulphur -- so we are told by Avicenna and Richard the Englishman -- has nothing todo with our art. However carefully prepared, it still disintegrates and destroysmetals, because it has no affinity with them. When enclosed in metals, it retardstheir fusion. This is clearly seen in the case of iron, which contains hard, gross,and impure sulphur. When this sulphur is burned it is nothing but a dead, earthy,The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (11 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"powdery substance. How then can it impart life to other things? For it has twoprinciples of decay -- its inflammability and its earthy impurity. The sulphur of theSages, on the other hand, is living fire; it is quick, and quickens and matureslifeless substances. Common sulphur, then, cannot be the substance of the Stone.But what shall we infer concerning common mercury? The Sages tell us that theMatter of our Stone is a mercurial substance, and many of its qualities closelyresemble those of vulgar mercury. For it is the elementary substance of all fusibleminerals, as Arnold says (Ros., pt. I., Cp. ii.): \"Since all fusible substances, whenmelted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because of its commonnature: they can differ from it only in so far as It contains impure foreign sulphur.\"And, again (cp. iv.): \"Living mercury is clearly most perfect, and proved in all itsoperations, since it saves from combustion and promotes fusion. It is the redtincture, the sum of perfection, and quick as lightning; nor is it severed from thatwith which it has mingled so long as it exists. The same is full of affinity, cleavingfaithfully, and is the medium by which tinctures are united, for it mingles mostintimately with them, penetrating naturally into their inmost part, for it is of thesame nature. We imitate Nature exactly, who in her minera hath no other matterwhereon she works except a pure mercurial form. It is the only thing thatovercomes fire, and is not overcome by it, but delights in its amicable warmth.\"Again, Bernard says \"In this mercury is enclosed essential sulphur, which the firecannot touch; and it accomplishes our object without any other substance thanthat of pure mercury.\" Seeing, then, that mercury has such excellent properties, itmust surely be the substance of our Stone? True; but as there are two kinds ofsulphur, so there are two kinds of mercury, the common mercury and the mercuryof the Sages. Common mercury is gross and crude; nor does it stand the test of firelike our mercury, but is dissipated in the form of smoke, even by gentle heat.Hence the Sages have laid down this rule: \"Our mercury is not the mercury of thevulgar herd.\" So Lullius says (Clav. cp. I.) : \"Common quicksilver, however carefullyprepared, can never become the quicksilver of the Sages, for common quicksilvercan only stand the test of fire by the aid of some other dry and more highlydigested quicksilver.\" But most students of this art have spoken largely about thesublimation of common mercury, and have persisted in seeking the treasure ofearthly wisdom where it cannot be found, because Nature has not placed it there.And, truly, the working even of common mercury is so wonderful that it has misledsome who supposed themselves to be adepts in this art. The following is a case inpoint. I knew a man who succeeded in giving to his amalgam an orange colour, buthe could not get it any nearer to the colour of gold. At last this clever chemistdetermined to increase the heat of the furnace, thinking that this would have thedesired effect of more intimately combining the various ingredients. But alas ! thealembic burst, the gold was hurled into the fire, and almost changed from itsnature by the still volatile mercury. Hence it appears that the mercury (which is itsbody) so strongly affected the gold in its minutest particles as to reduce it to atincture, although several colours were obtained by the action of the heat on themelted mass. If that good man had taken to heart Arnold's words in the \"Flower ofFlowers,\" he would never have made that experiment. For the said Arnold makesreference to those who adopt this method in the following terms: \"They knew thatmercury is the elementary principle of the metals, and that they are producedthrough its digestion by the heat of sulphur; they therefore sublimed mercury byitself, then fixed and consolidated it, again melted it and did again coagulate it:but when they came to examine the alembic, they found no gold, etc.\" Thereforewe cannot believe that common quicksilver is the substance of the Stone. At thesame time I do not deny that it is indispensable both to the philosophical chymistThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (12 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and to the physician.We have carefully sought the substance of our stone in the animal and vegetableworld, among stones, lesser, intermediate, and greater minerals, but in vain. Wemust now see whether we can find it in the metals, and if so, whether in all oronly in some. It is a well-known fact (to which Roger bears witness, Spec., cp. iii.),that all metals are generated out of sulphur and quicksilver, and that nothing willbecome one with them, or change them, but what originates in themselves; sincea thing can be developed and improved only by that which belongs to its ownnature (Richard, cp. i.).I need not say that the Great Artist has ordained that throughout the whole ofNature things should generate and produce only that which is like them, so that,for instance, a horse can never be the offspring of a man. \"As brute animals,\" saysBasil Valentine, \"cannot multiply after their kind by way of generation except byvirtue of their common nature; so you cannot expect to obtain the Blessed Stone,but out of its own seed, out of which it was made from the beginning. Now to findthe seed you should diligently consider for what purpose you require the Store.You will at once see that it can be obtained only from the metallic root from whichGod has ordained that the metals themselves should be generated. Moreover,there is a great conformity between the generation of the metals and the Stone.For in both sulphur and quicksilver (containing that salt which is their quickeningsoul) are indispensably required; nor can any useful metal be generated until thesethree (making up the metallic substance) have been combined for in thecomposition of metals there must be nothing which has not been obtained from ametallic source.\" \"No external thing says Draco, \"which is not derived from thesetwo [sulphur and mercury] has power to produce or transmute metals. On thisaccount we must select a metallic substance for the production of the Stone.\" Wemust next briefly enquire whether it is to be found in imperfect metals. Manyimagine that the substance of the white (tincture) may be elicited from tin orlead, and that of the red out of copper or iron, or both. This idea is doubtlessowing to a misconception of the words of the Sages. For Geber (lib. forn. cp., ix.)says: \"The mass for fermentation we generally gain from the imperfect [base]bodies.\" Therefore we lay it down as a general rule that the white paste may beextracted from Jupiter and Saturn, the red from Venus, Saturn, and Mars. AndBasil. Valentinus says (Lib. de phys. et hyperphys.), that the tincture is preparedout of a conjunction of Mars and Venus. Again (Triumph. Antimon.), he uses thesewords: \"After this tincture of the Sun and Moon comes the tincture of Venus andMars which two make up the tincture of the Sun, when they have been thoroughlyperfected and condensed. After these come the tinctures of Jupiter and of Saturn(for the coagulation of mercury) and at last the tincture of mercury itself.\" But thesearcher of Nature must know that there can be no contradiction of opinionbetween Geber or Basil, for it is impossible that the true philosophers should everlie, and so these words should be parabolically understood. For no perfection canbe obtained from imperfect metals, either by themselves or mixed, nor can thatwhich is itself imperfect bring other things to perfection. For the purest substanceof mercury is required for our purpose, as is testified in the \"Sounding of theTrumpet,\" and by Avicenna, Lullius, and almost all the Sages, who unanimouslyaffirm that \"the purest substance of mercury is selected by us for our work.\" Nowthis highly refined substance of mercury is not found in the base metals, since theyare rendered so gross by their impure and unessential sulphur, that, like leprousbodies, they can never be thoroughly purged and cleansed, in which process is theessence of our artifice. Nor do they well stand the test of fire, which is one of theproperties required in our Matter. Let us hear what Geber has to tell us (Summa,The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (13 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"cp. ixiii.) concerning the impurity of imperfect metals, and the properties ofperfect mercury: \"Thus,\" he says, \"we happen upon two most wonderful secrets.The one is that there exists a twofold cause for the destruction of every[imperfect] metal by fire: namely, (1), the combustible sulphur enclosed in theirinterior substance is kindled by fierce heat, and (unimpeded by any excellence intheir mercury) annihilates, and converts into smoke their entire substance; (2), theoutward flame is fed by them, penetrates into their interior, and dissolves theminto smoke, even though they be very solid; (3), their interior is laid bare bycalcination. Now when all these conditions of destruction are found together,bodies must needs be destroyed; if they are not found together, they aredestroyed somewhat more slowly. The second secret is the excellence whichquicksilver imparts to bodies. For quicksilver (no other condition of decay beingpresent) does not permit itself to be separated into its elements, but proves itsperfection by preserving its substance intact in the fire. Blessed be God whocreated it, and gave it such' a substance and such properties as are not found in allNature besides. This is that which overcomes fire, and delights in its amicableheat. \"Here Geber clearly shews that the substance of our Stone cannot exist inimperfect metals; because things that are impure in themselves do not abide thefire which might purify them, while our mercury (on account of its purity) is not inthe slightest degree injured by the fire. Thus we perceive that no one imperfectmetal can contain the substance of our Stone. But neither is it to be found in amixture of impure metals -- for by mixing they become less pure than they werebefore. Moreover we said above that the substance we required was one. This factis clearly set forth by Halys (lib. secret., cp. vi.), when he says: \"The Stone is One;nothing else must be added to it: out of one substance the Sages obtain ourremedy. Nothing else must mingle with the Stone itself, or with its substance.\" AndMorienus says: \"This Magistery grows from one original root, which branches outinto several parts, and from which springs one thing.\" But if base metals cannot bethe substance of the Stone, why do the Sages bid us employ them? I will tell you.When they speak of impure bodies, they do not mean copper, iron, lead, tin &c.,but its own body, or its earth -- as Arnold (Flos Flor.) says \"Mercury is united toearth, i.e., to an imperfect substance [or body]. \"For though this \"earth\" is soperfect and pure that in these respects it would seem to attain the utmostpossibility of Nature, yet in regard to the Stone it is still imperfect and impure. Inthis point art leaves Nature behind, since it accomplishes what Nature could notperform. That this earth before its plenary purgation and regeneration isimperfect, may be seen from the fact that it cannot yet accomplish more in thematter of tinging than Nature has given to it, while after its regeneration it is mostpowerful. Its grossness is clearly perceived in an actual experiment: for first it isblack and looks like lead or antimony; then it is of a whitish colour, and is calledJupiter (or tin, or magnesia), and this also before it has attained true whiteness,but when it has passed the white stage it is called Mars and Venus; after that itbecomes perfect and red. That Basil Valentinus agrees with me, and did not reallyhold the opinion which he expressed in some of his writings, is clear from his tractconcerning the Great Stone where (speaking of the Matter of the Stone) he saysthat in the Sun all three perfections are found together, whence it derives itspower of resisting the fire, and that the Moon, on account of its fixed mercury,does not easily yield to the fire, but endures the trial. \"That noble paramourVenus,\" he continues, \"is furnished with an abundance of colour, and the greaterand richer part of her body is full of tincture. The colour is the same which dwellsin the most precious of metals, and on account of its abundance has a reddishappearance. But its body is leprous, for which reason the tincture cannot remainfixed in it, but evaporates when the former is destroyed. For when the bodyThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (14 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"decays the soul cannot remain, but is dissipated and driven off. Its habitation isdestroyed and burnt with fire, and its place knows it no more. In a fixed body itwould without difficulty remain. The fixed ' salt ' gives to brave Mars a hard,strong, and heavy body; whence the strength of his soul is perceived: for thiswarrior is not easily overcome. For his body is hard and difficult to wound.\"But let no one conclude from these words of Basilius that that fixed sulphur ofVenus, when united to the spirit of perfect mercury, will become the tincture. Wemust again repeat that our substance is not collected from many sources; but, asBasilius says, it is one universal thing, and is found in, and obtained from onething, being the spirit of mercury, the soul of sulphur, and a spiritual salt, unitedunder one heaven and dwelling in one body. Therefore let us turn our backs uponthe base metals, and turn our minds to the precious metals, taking to heart thosewords of Plato (qu. ii.): \"Why do you melt and dissolve other bodies with greatlabour, when in these [the precious metals] you have what you seek? If you wish touse the base metals, you must first change them into the substance of perfectbodies.\" Therefore, beloved inquirer into the secrets of Nature, leave on one sideall things animal and vegetable, all salts, alums, vitriols, bismuths, magnesias,antimonies, and all base and impure metals, and seek thy Stone with Arnold deVill.nov. ( Pt. 1., cp. vii.): \"in Mercury and the Sun for the Sun, and in Mercury andthe Moon for the Moon; since the whole virtue of this art consists in themalone.\"For as the source of ignition is fire, so gold is the principle of gold making,\"says Ripley, in his \"First Gate.\" If, therefore, thou wouldest make gold and silver bythe philosopher's art, take for this purpose neither eggs, nor blood, but gold andsilver, which, being subjected to the action of fire naturally, prudently, and notmanually, generate new substances after their own kind, like all things in Nature.Richard (cp. x.) tells us \"to sow gold and silver, that aided by our labour they maybring forth fruit, through the mediation of Nature: for these two have [and are]what you seek and nothing else in all the world.\" And why should I not fix on themsince they contain pure and perfect mercury, with red and white sulphur.(Richard, cp. xvii.) So Avicenna teaches that, \"in all silver is white, as in all goldthere is red, sulphur. No other sulphur like that which exists in these bodies isfound on all the earth. Therefore we cunningly prepare these two bodies, that wemay have sulphur and quicksilver of the same substance as that which generatesgold and silver under the earth. For they are shining bodies, whose rays tinge otherbodies with true whiteness and redness, according to the manner of their ownpreparation.\" \"For our Magistery,\" says, Arnold (Rosar. pt. 1., cp. v.) \"aids perfectbodies, and works upon the imperfect without the admixture of anything else.&old, then, being the most precious of all the metals, is the red tincture, tingingand transforming every body. Silver is the white tincture, tinging other bodies withits perfect whiteness.\" Let me tell the gentle reader that the metals, that is tosay, gold and silver in their metallic form, are not the Matter of our Stone -- beingin the middle between them and the base metals, as our Matter is in the middlebetween the former and our Great Stone. no Bernard says (pt. ii.): \"Let them besilent who affirm that there is any tincture but our own, or any other sulphur thanthat which lies hid in magnesia; also those who would extract the quicksilver fromany but the red slave, and who speak of some other water but our own which isincorruptible and combines with nothing except that which belongs to its ownnature, and moistens [tinges] nothing except that which is one with its ownnature. There is no acid but our own, no other regimen, no other colours. In thesame way, there is no other true solution, sublimation, consolidation,putrefaction. I therefore advise you to have done with alums, vitriols, salts, blackbodies, borax, aqua fortis, herbs, animals, beasts, and all that proceeds fromThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (15 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"them, hairs, blood, urine, human seed, flesh, eggs, and all minerals, and to keepto the metals. But though the quicksilver required for our Stone is found in metalsonly, and in these is the beginning of the work, they are not therefore our Stone,so long as they retain their metallic form. For one and the same substance cannothave two forms. How can they be the Stone which holds an intermediate formbetween metals and mercury, unless their present form is first destroyed andremoved? Therefore, also, Raymond Lully says in his \"Testament\" (cp. vi.): \"On thisaccount a good artist takes metals for his media in the work of the magistery, andespecially the Sun and Moon, because in them the substance of the Mercury andSulphur is ripened, pure, and well-digested by Nature's own artifice.. The artistwould vainly endeavour to produce this exact proportion out of the naturalelements, if he did not find it ready to his hand in these bodies.\" And in the\"Codicil\" he says: \"Without these two, viz., gold and silver, our art would have noexistence since the sulphur they contain has been purified by nature with athoroughness such as art would vainly strive to imitate. From these two bodies,with their prepared sulphur [or prepared arsenic] our Medicine may be elicited,but without them we can never obtain it.\" In the preface to his \"Key\" he says: \"Iadvise you, my friends, to operate on nothing but the Sun and Moon; but these youshould resolve into their elementary substances, viz., our quicksilver and oursulphur.\" In like manner Arnoldus assures us that \"from these bodies there isextracted an exceedingly white and red sulphur; for in these there is a most puresubstance of sulphur, cleansed to the highest degree by Nature's own artifice.\"Nicarus, in \"The Crowd,\" says: \"I bid you take gold, which you desire to multiplyand renew, and to divide its water into two parts; for that metal falling into thatwater will be called the fermenting matter of gold.\" How can this Sage call his\"water\" gold? To assist the student in solving this enigma I must tell him that thegold of the Sages is not common gold, as also Senior tells us. In \"The Crowd\" it issaid: \"As mercury is the element of all metals, so gold is their ultimate goal; hencein all metals, pure and impure, there are gold, silver, and mercury. But there isone true gold which is the essence of all.\" Thus you see that there is a gold of theSages, which, though derived from common gold, is yet very different from it. Thefollowing words occur in the \"Rising Dawn\" (cp. xvi.) \"The philosopher's goldresembles common gold neither in colour nor in substance. That which is extractedfrom it is the red and white tincture.\" \"The philosopher's gold may be bought at alow price\" (Aphidius). \"All that is bought at a high price is false. With little gold webuy much\" (Morienus). Moreover, our gold is living gold, and our silver is livingsilver, so that they can cause nothing but life and growth. Common gold and silverare dead. They can effect nothing until they are raised from the dead andquickened by the Sage. Then they live, and possess in a high degree the power ofpropagating and multiplying their race. Concerning the life of our metals thatgreat philosopher, Sendivogius (who is still living), has the following words: \"Letme advise you not to receive the gold and silver of the vulgar herd, for they aredead. Take our living metals. Place them in our fire, and there will result a dryliquid. First, earth will be resolved into water [for thus the Mercury of the Sages iscalled]. That water will solve gold and silver, and consume them until only thetenth part with one part is left. This will be the humid radical of the metals.\"It is to be noted that Sages sometimes call their water, as well as their earth, gold.Hereunto we have already heard the words of Nicarus, and after a like manner weare told in the \"Rosary of the Philosophers: \"Our gold and silver are not the goldand silver of the vulgar. We call gold the water which rises into the air whenexposed to fire. Verily, this gold is not the gold of the vulgar. The vulgar would notbelieve of their gold that it could be volatilised on account of its solid nature.\"The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (16 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:53]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The philosopher's \"earth,\" then, is sometimes designated their gold, as the sameauthor testifies: \"Know that our ore, which is the gold of the philosophers, is theirearth.\" This \"earth\" is also called ore, ferment, or tincture; just as the \"water\" iscalled white and flaky \"earth\". So we read in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet\" :\"Wherefore Hermes says, \"Sow your gold in white, flaky earth which by calcinationhas been made glowing, subtle, and volatile.\" That is to say: Sow gold, i.e., thesoul and quickening virtue, into the white earth, which by preparation has beenmade white and pure and freed from all its grossness. Thus natural gold is not thefermenting matter, but the philosopher's gold is the quickening ferment itself.\"Again, in the Seventh Step of the is \"Ladder of the Philosophers\": \"Their earth iswhite in which their gold [which is the soul] is sown, and this body is the centre ofknowledge, the concentration thereof, and the habitation of tinctures.\" Oncemore: \"Therefore Hercules says: \"Solve the body of magnesia which has becomewhite and like the leaves of the bramble.\" This is the body; the soul is the essencewhich is called the philosopher's gold.\" (For with water the spirit ascends into theupper air.) \"Mix,\" says Senior, \"gold with gold, that is water [mercury] and ashes.\"Again, Hermes says: \"Sow gold into the white flaky earth.\" From these expressions,however obscurely worded it is clear that our gold is not common gold.But why do the philosophers call their gold now \"water,\" and now \"earth\"? Do theynot contradict themselves, or each other? No; our Sages, in expounding the truth,veil it under obscure and allegorical expressions, but nevertheless agree with eachother so marvellously that they all seem to speak, as it were, with one mouth.They do not confound one thing with another, nor do they wish to lead the earnestenquirer astray. They express themselves in mystic phrases to hide the truth fromthe unworthy and impious, lest they should seem to be casting pearls beforeswine, and giving the holy thing to be trodden underfoot by these who think onlyof indulging their lustful desires. But the noble student of our art has been toldmore than once, not only from what quarter our Stone may be obtained, but alsothat its substance must be one, which by the artist's skill may be resolved into two,viz., earth and fire, or mercury and sulphur.The Sages, then, do well to call their gold earth or water; for they have a perfectright to term it whatever they like. So they have frequently called their Stonetheir gold, their superperfect gold, their regenerate gold, and by many othernames besides. If any one does not perceive their meaning at the first glance, hemust blame his own ignorance, not their jealousy.The reader now knows that the substance of our Stone is neither animal norvegetable, and that it does not belong to the minerals or the base metals, but thatit must be extracted from gold and silver, and that our gold and silver are not thevulgar, dead gold and silver, but the living gold and silver of the Sages. We mustnow say something about the mode of solution, as the greatest arcanum of all, andthe root of the matter. A solution takes place when we transform a dry thing into aliquid, a hard thing into a soft, a hidden thing into one that is manifest, i.e., whena solid is changed into water; not, however, the vulgar water (as Parmenides andAgadmon in \"The Crowd \"teach us: \"When some persons hear of the liquefaction,they think a change takes place into the water of the clouds. But if they had readand understood our books, they would know that our water is permanent), but intothe water of the Sages, i.e., the elementary substance, as Arnold (Ros. I., cp. ix.)says: \"he object of the Sages is to dissolve the Stone into its mercury, orelementary matter\" And Avicenna says: \"Thou who wouldest attain our object mustfirst endeavour to dissolve and sublime the two luminaries, which is the first stageof the experiment, that they may become quicksilver.\" Therefore Arnold (Ros. II.,The Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (17 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"cp. ii.) describes the solution as a resolving of bodies, and a preparation of thefirst Matter or Nature. And Richard the Englishman (cp. xviii.) writes thus: \"Firstthe Stone must be resolved into its elementary substance [seeing that it is anunion of body and spirit], that the two may become one mercurial water.\" Buteven as this first solution is the most vital part of our process, so is it also the mostdifficult, as Eobold Vogelius testifies when he says: \"How hard this achievement iscan be affirmed by those who have performed it.\" Bernard of Trevisan, in his bookaddressed to Thomas of Bononia, says: \"He who knows the secret of the solution isacquainted with the arcanum of the Art, which is, to mingle kinds, and effectuallyto extract elements from elements which lie hid in them.\" The solution must notbe made with aqua fortis; for aqua fortis corrodes and destroys the body whichshould be only liquefied and improved. The solution does not take place into anywater that wets the hands, but into a dry water, which is called both sulphur andmercury, as Zneumo says (Turba): \"Unless by resolving it into its elements youextract from the body its marrow, and make it an impalpable spirit, you labour invain.\" And Richard the Englishman, following Avicenna, affirms (cp. xi.): \"TheSages have striven to discover how those sulphurs may be extracted from moreperfect bodies, and how their qualities may be so refined by Art, that that whichwas not manifest before (although it always lay hid in them) may appear by themediation of the said Art with Nature.\" And this they confess cannot be doneunless the body be resolved into its First Matter, which is quicksilver, out of whichit was made in the beginning, without admixture of any outward things; sinceforeign matter cannot improve the nature of our Stone. \"For no water,\" saysBernard, \"dissolves our bodies, but that which is of their kind, and may beinspissated by them.\" (Ep. to Thom. of Bonon.) And in the same Epistle he writes:\"The solution should be permanent, so that from both elements, viz., the male andfemale seed, a new species may result. Amen, I say unto you that no natural watercan dissolve metals, except that which is always in them substantially andformally, and which the metals themselves, being dissolved, may againconsolidate.\"' Thus Morfoleus, in \"The Crowd\" says: \"Every body is dissolved withthe spirit that is joined to it, and doubtless also becomes spiritual. And every spiritis modified and coloured by bodies, to which spirit is thus added a tinging colourwhich stands the test of fire.\" Hence the student of our art must diligently enquirewhat that water is. \"For the knowledge of the menstruum,\" says Raymond (Comp.An., p. i.) \"is a thing without which nothing can be done in the magistery of thisArt. Nothing preserves the metals while it dissolves them, but our menstruum,\"which, as he further states in his ' Codicil,' is \"the water by which the metals aresolved, while all their essential properties are conserved.\" Though this is the GreatArcanum which our Sages have always kept secret, and have forbidden us toreveal, yet, as far as we may, we will put you on the right track by two quotations.The first is found in the abridged Rosary, and runs as follows: \"The firstpreparation and foundation of this Art, is the solution [i.e., reduction] of the bodyinto water, i.e., into quicksilver, and this they call the solution, when they say:Let the gold be dissolved, which is hid in the body of magnesia, that it may bereduced to its First Matter, that thence it may become sulphur and quicksilver, andnot be again liquefied into water. The object of our solution is to make it liquid,and resolve it into the substance of quicksilver that the saltness of its sulphur maybe diminished, which divine sulphur is prepared by extraction from two sulphurs,when the spirit meets the body.\" The second quotation is from the \"Proemium ofthe Twelve Gates,\" by Ripley: \"I will straightway teach thee that thou mayest knowthat there are three mercuries, which are the keys of knowledge [which Raymondcalls his menstrua], without which nothing is properly done. But two of them aresuperficial. The third is of the essence of the Sun and Moon, the properties ofThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (18 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"which I will describe to thee. For mercury, the essence of other metals, is theprincipal substance of our Stone. In Gold and Silver our menstrua are not visible tothe eye, and are only perceived by their effect. This is the Stone of which wespeak, if anyone understand our books aright. It is the soul and shining substanceof the Sun and Moon, that subtile influence from which the earth derives itssplendour. For what are gold and silver (says Avicenna) but pure red and whiteearth? Take away from it the aforesaid splendour, and it will be nothing butworthless earth. The whole compound we call our lead. The quality of splendourcomes from the Sun and Moon. And, in brief, these are our solvents. Perfect bodieswe naturally calcine with the first, without adding any impure body but onecommonly called by philosophers the green lion, and this is the medium forperfectly combining the tinctures of the Sun and Moon. With the second, which is avegetable liquid, reviving what before was dead, the two principles [both materialand formal] must be solved; else they would be of little value. With the third,which is a permanent, incombustible liquid, of unctuous quality, the tree ofHermes is burnt to ashes. This is our natural, most sure fire, our mercury, oursulphur, our pure tincture, our soul, our Stone raised with the wind, born in theearth. These things take to heart. This Stone, I dare to tell thee, is the powerfulessence of the metal, and thou must be careful how thou dost obtain it. For thissolvent is invisible, although with the secondary philosophic water it may, by theseparation of elements, become visible in the form of pure water. Out of thissolvent, and with it, thou mayst obtain the sulphur of Nature, if it be naturallyturned into a pure spirit. Then. thou mayst with it dissolve thy fundamental mass[i.e. gold and silver].\"In these two quotations the whole mystery of the solution is revealed. If you willconsider the properties and powers of Nature, and compare them with thesewords, and annihilate all the workings of Nature (i.e. reduce them. and unrollthem like the thread of a skein), you will find in them all truth plainly andfundamentally. But if you cannot gather from them where are the bolted gates,and do not know the substance and the powers of Nature, you shall be conductedto them, not by contemptuous self-conceit, but by ardent prayer and indefatigablestudy.For (by the revelation of the great and good God) I have attained this Art only bypersevering application, vigils, and repeated reading of authentic books. I do notspeak of the matter -- that was made known to me by the revelation of God alone;but I have by study discovered the secret of its solution, which is the same withancient and modern Sages, and the true arcanum of the Art, in the absence ofwhich neither past nor present Philosophers could have performed anything,whence it is a secret of Art and an arcanum of wisdom which no one but God mustreveal, for which benefit I give undying thanks with heart and lips to the Creator ofall things, world without end, Amen.That you may have no cause to complain of me, gentle reader, I will, however, forthe love of God, expound to you another mystery. You are to know that, althoughthe solution is one, yet in it there may be distinguished a first, and a second, asthey say in the schools. The first solution is that of which Arnold speaks in theabove quotation, viz., the reduction of it to its First Matter; the second is thatperfect solution of body and spirit at the same time, in which the solvent and thething solved always abide together, and with this solution of the body there takesplace simultaneously a consolidation of the spirit.Here you may clearly and plainly see with your eyes what you have long desired toThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (19 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"see.

With these words I willconclude my little tract. Everything else that remains to be said I will set forth inthe following parable, where you will find the entire system and practice clearlyexpounded. If you duly follow it, you will doubtless attain to the true wisdom. Mayit be shewn to you, and to all good men, by God the Father, God the Son, and Godthe Holy Spirit, Blessed for evermore!M.S.The thing is one in number, and one essence, which Nature strives to transform,but with the help of Art, into two, and twice two: mercury and sulphur impartnourishment to themselves. Spirit, and soul, and body, and four elements: the fifthwhich they furnish is the Philosopher's Stone. Select your substance without guile,let it be double, and let its splendour be of pure mercury. Take sulphur free fromevery foreign substance, and consume it in a fiery furnace. But when you put ittogether again, let it still be of the same weight. Then I will believe that you areupon the road of the mystery. When you have dissolved, quickly sublime it. Poundwhat you obtain, and ceaselessly distil it. Then endeavour to condense it, andcontinue to expose it to heat. After this begin to \"tinge\" largely.

But it was not in my power to doso; for so violent a tempest blew upon me from behind that it was easier to taketen steps forward than to take one backward. So I had to hurry forward, and followthe rugged path up and down hill. After a while, I reached a beautiful meadow,surrounded with heavy-laden fruit trees, which the inhabitants of the place calledthe Meadow of Happiness. There I met a crowd of decrepit men with grey beards,one of whom, an elderly personage, had a long darkish beard, whom also I knew byname, but whose face I had never seen. These men were discussing varioussubjects, e.g., the goodness and wisdom of God, all natural objects, and especiallythe great mystery which lies hid in Nature, which -- they said -- God conceals fromthe whole world, and makes known only to a few who truly love Him. I listened tothem for a long time (for I was pleased with their discourse) till I thought thatsome were talking rather wildly, not in regard to the substance and the method,but as concerns parables, similitudes, etc., which were the figments of Aristotle,Pliny, and others. When I heard these things, I could no longer contain myself,and, like Saul among the prophets, I began to give my opinion, and to refute thosefutile assertions by arguments drawn from experience and reason. Some of themagreed with me, and began to test my knowledge with many questions. But I wasThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (20 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"so well grounded that I stood the test to the admiration of all. They all marvelledat the soundness of my knowledge, and affirmed with one voice that I should bereceived into their fellowship. These words filled me with great joy. But they said Icould not be their Brother until I knew their Lion, and his internal and externalproperties. They told me I must summon up my whole strength to subdue him. Iconfidently replied that I would leave no stone unturned to attain this object. Fortheir kindness affected me so that I would not have left them for all the wealth ofthis world. Therefore they conducted me to the Lion, and were at great pains todeclare to me his nature. But no one would tell me how I must treat him at first.Some of them did indeed mutter a few words on this point, but so confusedly andobscurely, that scarce one in a thousand would have understood their meaning.However, they said that when I had bound him without being harmed by his sharpclaws and terrible teeth, I should know all the rest. This Lion was old, fierce,great, and terrible to behold with his flowing yellow mane. Then I repented of mytemerity, and would gladly have retreated if I had not been held to my purpose bymy vow, and the old men that surrounded me. So I carefully descended into theLion's den, and strove to pacify him; but he glared upon me with red eyes, andaffrighted me so that I could hardly stand upon my feet, and thought that my lasthour had come. But calling to mind what one of the old men had said to me when Ientered the den, namely, that many had undertaken to tame the Lion, but thatonly few had accomplished it, I summoned up courage, and tried several artifices,which I had learned by diligent training. Moreover, I had some knowledge ofnatural magic. I therefore relinquished my blandishments, and seized him sogently, skilfully, and subtly, that almost before he knew what I was about I haddrawn all the blood from his body, and from his very heart and bowels. This bloodwas red indeed, but choleric. Then I proceeded to dissect him, and made a mostmarvellous discovery: -- his bones were as white as snow, and their quantity moreconsiderable than that of the blood. When the old men who stood round the den,and had watched our struggle, saw this, they began to converse with greateagerness, as I could see from their gestures -- for, being in the den, I could nothear their words. But anon their dispute began to run high, and I could distinguishthese words: \"He must bring him to life again if he wishes to be our brother.\"Therefore, without further delay, I stepped out of the den into a large open space,and then suddenly (I know not how) found myself upon a very high wall, which rosemore than 100 yards into the air, but at the top was not more than a foot in width,and along the middle of it ran an iron battlement of great strength. Now as Ipassed along I thought I saw one walking before me on the right side of thebattlement. When I had followed him a short distance I became aware of anotherperson following me on the other side; but, whether it was a man or a woman Icannot undertake to say. This person hailed me, and said that there was moreconvenient footing on his side than on mine. This I was quite ready to believe; forthe battlement, which was on the middle of the wall, made the path so narrow asto render progress extremely difficult at such a great height, indeed, I noticed thatsome of those who followed me actually fell. Therefore I got over the battlementon to the other side, and proceeded to the end of the wall, which presented amost difficult and dangerous descent. Then I was sorry that I had deserted my ownside, as I could neither advance nor retreat But, remembering that fortunebefriends the bold, I attempted the descent, and by using my hands and feet, I gotdown safely. Now when I had advanced a little further, I put away all thought ofdanger, and forgot all about the wall and the battlement. Then lighting upon acertain place, I found white and red roses, but the latter were more abundant; so Igathered some of them and stuck them in my cap. In that place were some mostbeautiful women, and in the neighbouring garden a number of young men were toThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (21 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"be seen. But a wall which surrounded the garden prevented the latter from joiningthe women. They were eager to do so, but were not allowed to go round thegarden and find the gate. The sight moved me to pity, and therefore I hastily wentback by the smooth path along which I had come, and soon reached some houses,among which I expected to find the gardener's cottage. But I found there manymen, of whom each had his own cell (in very few there were two living together).They were all busily at work, each labouring by himself. Their work was of a kindlong and familiarly known to me -- indeed, far too well known. So I said to myself:\"Behold, here are many persons at work upon vain arid foolish experiments, whichhave a certain specious plausibility (according to each man's idiosyncrasy), but noreal foundation in Nature. Surely you, too, will obtain forgiveness.\" At least, Iwould not suffer myself to be detained with these barren futilities, but went onmy way. When I reached the gate of the garden some looked askance at me, and Iwas afraid they would prevent me from carrying out my purpose. Othersmurmured, and said: \"Look, this fellow presumes to approach the gate of thegarden, and we who have spent so many years in these horticultural labours, havenever gained admittance! How we will jeer at him if he meets with a repulse.\" ButI paid no attention to their talk (for I knew the interior of that garden better thanthey, although I had never been in it), and approached the gate, which wasdouble-locked, and in which there appeared to be no keyhole, but soon I perceiveda keyhole which would have escaped any common observer. So I inserted mymaster key (called by some \"the adulteress\"), which I had diligently fashioned forthe purpose, pushed back the bolt, and entered. After passing this gate, I cameupon other bolted gates, which, however, I opened without any difficulty. So Ientered the garden, and found in the middle of it a small square garden, whichwas surrounded with a rose hedge covered with beautiful roses, and as a little rainwas falling, and the rays of the sun shone upon it, It beheld a rainbow. But I washastening past the small garden, to that place where I thought I could aid theyoung women, when, behold, there came forward the most beautiful of all themaidens, arrayed in silk and satin, with the most beautiful of the youths, dressedin a scarlet robe. They walked arm in arm to the rose garden, and carried manyfragrant roses in their hands. I greeted them, and and asked how she had got over.\"This my beloved bridegroom,\" she said, \"helped me, and now we are leaving thispleasant garden, and hastening to our chamber to satisfy our love.\" \"I am glad,\" Ireturned, \"that without any trouble on my part your desires have been fulfilled.But you see how much trouble I have taken on your behalf, having traversed sogreat a distance in so short a time.\" Then I came to a water-mill, built within ofstones, where there were no flour bins or other miller's requisites; yet I saw wheelsdriven round by the water. I asked the decrepit miller the reason, and he told methe grinding took place somewhere out of view. At the same moment I saw a millerenter that place by a small bridge, and immediately followed him. When I hadpassed the bridge, which was on the right side of the wheels, I paused and behelda wonderful sight. In a moment the wheels were above the bridge; I saw very blackwater, with white drops; the bridge was only about three inches wide; but byclinging to the rails I got safely back, without being wetted at all, and asked theold man how many wheels he had. He answered, \"Ten.\" I was troubled by themarvellous incident, and would gladly have known its meaning, but felt that it waslabour lost to ask the old man any questions, and so departed. Before the mill wasa raised platform on which some of the aforesaid old men were walking to and froin the warm sunshine, discussing a letter which they had received from the Facultyof the University. I guessed the tenor of the letter, and, feeling sure that itconcerned me, I addressed to them a question to that effect \"It does concern you,\"they said, \"the wife whom you married a long time ago, you must keep for ever, orThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (22 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"else we must tell our chief.\" \"You need not trouble yourselves about this matter,\" Isaid, \"for we were born together, and brought up together as children, and nowthat I have married her, I will never forsake her, but cherish her till her lastbreath; nay, even death itself shall not sever us.\" \"It is well,\" they said, \"your wifeis satisfied, too; you must be joined together.\" \"I am content,\" I said. \"It is well,\"they repeated. \"For thus the Lion will be restored to life, and be more powerfuland more active than he was before.\" Then I remembered my labours, and knew bycertain signs that this matter concerned not myself, but a very good friend ofmine. As these thoughts crossed my mind, I saw our bridegroom and his belovedbride -- both clothed in the aforesaid garments -- come forward, eager to bejoined together. This sight gladdened me; for I had been afraid that the wholematter concerned me. Now when the bridegroom, in his bright scarlet robe, withhis bride, whose silk dress gave out shining rays, reached the old men, they werestraightway joined together. And I marvelled that the maiden, who was said to bethe mother of her bridegroom, was of so youthful an appearance, that she mighthave seemed his daughter. But I know not what sin they had committed, exceptthat brother and sister had been drawn to each other by such passionate love thatthey could no more be separated; and, being charged with incest, they were shutup for ever in a close prison, which, however, was as pellucid and transparent asglass, and arched like the heavenly vault, so that all that they did could be seenfrom without. Here they were to do penance for their sins with ever-flowing tears,and true sorrow. All their clothes and outward ornaments were taken away. Noneof their servants and friends were allowed to be with them, but after they hadreceived sufficient meat and drink (the latter taken from the aforesaid water), thedoor was shut and locked, and the seal of the Faculty was affixed to it. I wasentrusted with the charge of heating their chamber in the winter, so that theymight be neither. too hot nor too cold, and I was further to see that they did notescape. If any accident of any kind happened, I was to be severely punished. I didnot like this charge; and, as I remembered that the matter was most important,and that the College of Sages were not wont to say what they did not mean, I wasfilled with fear. But since I had to bear that which I could not alter, and since thechamber was situated in a strong tower, and surrounded with battlements andlofty walls, and, moreover, could be easily heated with a gentle and continuousfire, I called upon God for help, and began to heat the chamber. But whathappened ? As soon as they felt the grateful warmth they fell to embracing eachother so passionately that the husband's heart was melted with the excessiveardour of love, and he fell down broken in many pieces. When she who loved himno less than he loved her, saw this, she wept for him, and, as it were, covered himwith overflowing tears, until he was quite flooded and concealed from view. Butthose complaints and tears did not last long, for being weary with exceedingsorrow, she at length destroyed herself. Alas ! what fear and anguish fell upon me,when I saw those who had been so straitly committed to my charge lying, as itwere, melted and dead before me. I felt sure that I should be put to death for it;but the jeers, the derision, and the contempt which I would have to undergoseemed more grievous even than death. In this anxious state of mind I spentseveral days, until the thought occurred to me that, if Medea had restored a deadbody to life, I might perhaps be able to do the same. But I could think of no betterplan than to keep up the warmth of the chamber until the water should haveevaporated, and the dead bodies of the lovers could again be seen. I doubted notthat then I should most honourably escape from all danger. So I kept up the fireforty days, the water diminishing from day to day, and the dead bodies beginningto reappear. Now, however, they looked as black as coals. This effect would havebeen produced sooner if the chamber had not been so closely shut and sealed soThe Golden Tracthttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/goldtrct.htm (23 of 25) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"that I could in no wise open it. For I noticed that the water rose to the \\roof of thechamber, and then came down again like rain, but it could find no exit from thechamber, until the dead bodies had putrefied and began to give out a grievoussmell. In the meantime the rays of the sun shining upon the moisture of thechamber, produced a most beautiful rainbow; and, after all my sorrow, the sightof its gay colours filled me with great delight; and I was particularly pleased to seemy lovers lying before me. But as there is no joy without a drop of bitterness, so Iwas still disturbed by the thought that those who had been committed to my carewere still lying lifeless. Nevertheless, I comforted myself with the reflection thatthe chamber (being so tightly closed) must still contain their souls and spirits.Therefore I continued diligently to perform my office of warming them, beingassured that they would not return to their bodies while they could enjoy thatmoist atmosphere. This conjecture was justified by the event. For towards eveningI noticed that many vapours rose from the earth through the heat of the sun, andwere lifted up as water is attracted by the sun; afterwards when night fell, theywatered the earth as fertilising dew, and washed our bodies, which became morebeautiful and white the oftener this sprinkling took place. And the whiter theybecame, the more the quantity of moisture in the air diminished, until at last theatmosphere was too thin for the spirit and soul to remain therein any longer; sothey were at length compelled to return to the clarified body of the Queen, which(to my great joy) was straightway restored to life. My joy was all the greater,because now she was arrayed in a beautiful and magnificent garment such as israrely seen by mortal eye, a d had a glorious crown, all made of diamonds, uponher head. Thus attired, she stood upon her feet and cried: \"Know this, ye mortals,and let it enter your hearts, that the most High God is one God, who has power toset up and pull down kings. He makes rich and poor as He wills. He has killed, andraised again. I was great, and was brought low; but now, having been humbled, Ihave been made Queen of many more kingdoms. After death life has been restoredto me. When I was poor, the treasures of the wise and mighty were committed tome. Therefore I, too, can make the poor rich, give grace to the humble, andrestore the health of the sick. But I am not yet able to raise my beloved brother,the most mighty King, from the dead. Nevertheless, when he comes, he will showthat my words are true.\" When she had thus spoken the sun lighted up the worldwith his glorious rays, and the heat waxed great (for the dog days wereapproaching). Long before this, garments of rich black silk, of grey or ash-coloureddamask, of rare white silk, embroidered with silver, precious pearls, and brilliantdiamonds, had been got ready towards the marriage of our Queen; and nowgarments of many colours, of flesh colour, orange, and saffron, and of red andscarlet silk, richly embroidered with rubies and carbuncles, were being preparedfor the adornment of our new King. But there was no one to be seen working atthose garments; yet one after another was got ready, insomuch that I greatlymarvelled, because I knew that none but the bride and the bridegroom hadentered the chamber. My wonder increased when I observed that as each dress wasfinished, those that had been there before straightway vanished, though I couldsee no one put them away. Now when that most precious scarlet garment hadbeen finished, the great and mighty King appeared in great splendour andindescribable magnificence, and when he saw that he was shut in, he besoughtme, in the most persuasive accents, to open the door, as it would be to myadvantage to let him out of the chamber. Now, though I had been most strictlyenjoined not to open the chamber, I was filled with awe by the majesty andpersuasive speech of the King, and acceded to his request. When he left thechamber, he bore himself so kindly, so gently, and so humbly, that I could not helpreflecting that these virtues are the most glorious ornaments of the great.

So he slept a few days, and then called me back to open the door again. Helooked much more beautiful, ruddier, and more royal, and said that this water wasvery precious and full of virtue. When at his request I had fetched him some more,he took a deeper draught than before, insomuch that the size of the chamberseemed to become enlarged.

They laboriously endeavoured and fervently longed to discover whether Nature containedanything that would preserve our earthly body from decay and death, and maintain it in perpetual health and vigour. For by the light of Nature,and Divine revelation, they intuitively perceived that the Almighty, in His love to men, must have concealed in the world some wonderful arcanumThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic1.htm (1 of 3) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"by which every imperfect, diseased, and defective thing in the whole world might be renewed, and restored to its former vigour.By the most diligent and careful search they gradually found out that there was nothing in this world that could procure for our earthly andcorruptible body immunity from death, since death was laid upon the Protoplasts, Adam and Eve, and their posterity, as a perpetual penalty. Butthey did discover one thing which, being itself incorruptible, has been ordained of God for the good of man, to remove disease, to cure allimperfection, to purge old age, and to prolong our brief life - a boon actually enjoyed by the Patriarchs.This wonderful remedy was industriously sought by the wise and understanding, until they discovered it, and its precious virtue. Thus, thePatriarchs used it to restore their bodily vigour, and prolong their lives; and it was no doubt revealed by God to Adam, our thrice great parent, whobequeathed the secret to all the Patriarchs who were his descendants, who thereby procured for themselves length of days and boundless wealth.When the aforesaid Gentiles had received this knowledge, they justly regarded it as a most precious gift of God, and a most holy Art, andforasmuch as they perceived that, by God's providence, it had been revealed only to a few, and concealed from the majority of mankind, theyalways made it a point of conscience and honour to keep it secret.But that the secret might not be lost, but rather continued and preserved to posterity, they expounded it most faithfully, both in their writings andin oral teaching to their faithful disciples, for the benefit of posterity; nevertheless, they so clothed and concealed the truth in allegoricallanguage that even now only very few are able to understand their instruction and turn it to practical account. For this practice they had a verygood reason; they wished to force those who seek this wisdom to feel their dependence on God (in Whose hand are all things), to obtain it throughinstant prayer, and, when it has been revealed to them, to give all the glory to Him. Moreover, they did not wish the pearls to be cast beforeswine. For they knew that if it were made known to the wicked world, men would greedily desire nothing but this one thing, neglect all labour, andgive themselves up to a dissolute and degraded life.But although the said philosophers have treated this subject with so great a variety of method, and used many peculiar and singular expressions,curious parables, and strange and fanciful words, yet they all agree in pointing out the same goal, and one and the same Matter as essential to theright conduct of the Art. Nevertheless, many students of the Art have entirely missed their meaning, and the secret Matter of which they speak.For at the present day there are (as there have always been) a large number not only of low charlatans, but of grave and learned men, who havesought this knowledge with unwearied industry, and yet have not been able to attain to it. Nay, some, angling with a golden hook, have utterlyruined themselves, and have been compelled to abandon their search in despair. Therefore, lest anyone should doubt the existence of this secretArt, or, after the manner of this wicked world, look upon it as a mere figment, I will enumerate some of the true Sages (besides those named inHoly Scripture) who really knew this Art, in the natural order of their succession. They are Hermes Trismegistus, Pythagoras, Alexander the Great,Plato, Theophrastus, Avicenna, Galen, Hippocrates, Lucian, Longanus, Rasis, Archelaus, Rupescissa, the Author of the Great Rosary, Mary theProphetess, Dionysius, Zachaire, Haly, Morienus, Calid, Constantius, Serapion, Albertus Magnus, Estrod, Arnold de Villa Nova, Geber, RaymondLully, Roger Bacon, Alan, Thomas Aquinas, Marcellus Palingenius; and, among moderns, Bernard of Trevisa, Frater Basil Valentinus, PhillipTheophrastus (i.e., Paracelsus), and many others. Nor is there any doubt that, among our own contemporaries, there, might be found some, who,through the grace of God, daily enjoy this arcanum, though they keep it a close secret from the world. But, side by side with these great Sages whohave written truly and uprightly concerning this Magistery, there are found many charlatans and impostors who falsely pretend to have aknowledge of this Art, and, by tricking out their lies in the phraseology of the Sages, throw dust into men's eyes, make their mouths water, and atlength fail to make good their promises. Their dupes should well ponder the following warning: \"Trust not him who distills gold out of yourmoney-box. If you are wise you will be on your guard against such. If you would not suffer both loss and mockery, beware of these dishonestcharlatans. Follow those who are simple, straightforward, and modest He who has the good, enjoys it in silence.\" But where are you to find such?\"Seek the good; you may know them by their excelling the rest in weight, matter, and performance.\" Now, since there are many students of thisArt who would fain learn its secret by a true and straight path, and are yet so bewildered by these impostors and charlatans, by their empty talkand their high pretensions, that they do not know which way to turn: therefore I have determined briefly to expound the true principles of this Art.For though I account myself unworthy to speak of so great a Mystery, yet I may say, without any self-glorification, that, through the grace of God, Ihave made greater progress in this Magistery than most; and I consider it as my duty not to hide the talent which my Lord and Master, the greatand good God, has committed to my unworthy keeping. For this reason I am willing to show the right way, by which they may attain a trueknowledge of this subject, to all lovers of chemistry, and have put forth this Brief Epitome and Declaration of the Whole Art (so far as it may becommitted to writing), in the hope that through my means, God may perchance open the eyes of some, and lead them back from theirpreconceived notions to the right path, and so manifest to them His mighty works. For the greater convenience of the reader I will divide the workinto four Parts:In the First part I will set forth the rudiments of the Art, and the best mode of preparing oneself for its study.In the Second I will shew and describe the quality and properties of the substance required, as also the method of its preparation andmanipulation.In the Third something will be said concerning the great utility of the Art, and its unspeakable efficacy and virtue.In the Fourth will follow a Spiritual Allegory, in which this whole Magistery is set forth, being the true form of the Heavenly, Everlasting, andBlessed Corner Stone of the Most High. It will also contain a true, brief, and simple, practical manual of the method of proceeding, for I am nofriend of many specious words.PART I.Who is he that fears the Lord? He will instruct him in the right path. (Psalm 25.)In the first place, let every devout and God-fearing chemist and student of this Art consider that this arcanum should be regarded, not only as atruly great, but as a most holy Art (seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly good). Therefore, if any man desire to reach thisgreat and unspeakable Mystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man, but by the grace of God, and that not our will ordesire, but only the mercy of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. For this reason you must first of all cleanse your heart, lift it to Him alone, andask of Him this gift in true, earnest, and undoubting prayer. He alone can give and bestow it.If the omnipotent God, who is the unerring searcher of all hearts, should find in you uprightness, faithfulness, sincerity, and a desire to know thisArt, not for any selfish end, but for His true honour and glory, He will doubtless hear your prayer (according to his promise), and so lead you by HisHoly Spirit that you will begin to understand this art, and feel that this knowledge would never have entered your heart if the most gracious Lordhad not answered your petition, and revealed to you the understanding even of the most elementary principles.Then fall upon thy knees, and with a humble and contrite heart render to Him the praise, honour, and glory due for the hearing of thy prayer, andask Him again and again to continue to thee His grace, and to grant that, after attaining to full and perfect knowledge of this profound Mystery,thou mayest be enabled to use it to the glory and honour of His most Holy Name, and for the good of thy suffering fellow men.Moreover, as you love your soul, beware of revealing the Mystery to any unworthy or wicked man, even in the smallest particular, or by making himin any sense a partaker thereof. If you in any way abuse the gift of God, or use it for your own glorification, you will most certainly be called toaccount by the Almighty Giver, and you will think that it would have been better for you if you had never known it.When you have thus, as it were, devoted yourself to God (who is not mocked), and learned to appreciate justly the aim and scope of this Art, youshould, in the first place, strive to realise how Nature, having been set in order by God the Triune, now works invisibly day by day, and moves anddwells in the will of God alone. For no one should set about the study of this Art without a just appreciation of natural processes. Now Nature maytruly be described as being one, true, simple, and perfect in her own essence, and as being animated by an invisible spirit. If therefore you wouldknow her, you, too, should be true, single-hearted, patient, constant, pious, forbearing, and, in short, a new and regenerate man. If you knowyourself to be so constituted and your nature adapted to Nature, you will have an intuitive insight into her working, such as it would otherwise beimpossible to obtain.For the study of this Art is such a perfect guide to excellence that a good knowledge of its principles will (as it were, against your will) hurry you onto an understanding of all the wonderful things of God, and teach you to rate all temporal and worldly things at their true value. But let not himwho desires this knowledge for the purpose of procuring wealth and pleasure think that he will ever attain to it. Therefore, let your mind andthoughts be turned away from all things earthly, and, as it were, created anew, and consecrated to God alone. For you should observe that thesethree, body, soul, and spirit, must work together in harmony if you are to bring your study of this Art to a prosperous issue, for unless the mind andheart of a man be governed by the same law which develops the whole work, such an one must indubitably err in the Art.When you are in inward harmony with God's world, outward conformity will not be wanting. Yet our artist can do nothing but sow, plant, andwater: God must give the increase. Therefore, if any one be the enemy of God, all Nature declares war against him; but to one who loves God,heaven and earth and all the elements must lend their assistance. If you bear these things in mind, and know the true First Matter (of which weThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic1.htm (2 of 3) [27/05/2004 23:01:54]"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"shall speak later on) you may at once set about the practical part of this study, calling on God for grace, direction, and guidance, so that your workmay be carried successfully through all its stages.He that abides in the fear of the Lord, and cleaves to His Word, and waits faithfully on His office, will transform tin and copper into silver andgold, and will do great things with the help of God: yea, with the grace of Jehovah, he will have power to make gold out of common refuse.(Ecclesiastes.

He that has it shall not beconfounded. (Isaiah XXVIII.)The numerous writers on our most noble Art have never wearied of singing itspraises, and inventing for it new and glorious names. Its most precious object theyhave called the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, or the most ancient, secret, natural,incomprehensible, heavenly, blessed, beatified, and triune universal Stone of theSages. Their reason for naming it a stone, or likening it to a stone, was this: Firstbecause its original Matter is really a kind of stone, which, being hard and solidlike a stone, may be pounded, reduced to powder, and resolved into its threeelements (which Nature herself has joined together), and then again may bere-combined into a solid stone of the fusibility of wax: by the skilled hand of theartist adjusting the law of Nature.The importance of starting with an exact knowledge of the first or otherwise thesecond Matter of the Philosophical Stone has been largely dwelt upon by all writerson this subject. This Matter is found in one thing, out of which alone our Stone isprepared (although it is called by a thousand names), without any foreignadmixture; and its quality, appearance, and properties have been set forth in thefollowing manner. It is composed of three things, yet it is only one. Likewise,having been created and made of one, two, three, four, and five, it is everywherefound in one and two. They also call it the universal Magnesia, or the seed of theworld, from which all natural objects take their origin. Its properties are of asingular kind; for, in addition to its marvelous nature and form, it is neither hotand dry like fire, nor cold and wet like water, nor cold and dry like earth, but aperfect preparation of all the elements. Its body is incorruptible, and is notdestroyed by any of the four elements, but its properties far exceed those of thefour elements, and the four qualities, like heaven and the Quintessence. Withrespect to its outward appearance, figure, form, and shape, they call it a stone,and not a stone; they liken it to gum and white water, and to the water of theOcean. It is named the water of life, the purest and most blessed water, yet notthe water of the clouds, or of any common spring but a thick, permanent, salt, and(in a certain sense) dry water, which wets not the hand, a slimy water whichsprings out of the fatness of the earth. Likewise, it is a double mercury and Azoth,which, being supported by the vapour or exudation of the greater and lesserheavenly and the earthly globe, cannot be consumed by fire. For itself is theuniversal and sparkling flame of the light of Nature, which has the heavenly Spiritin itself, with which it was animated at first by God, Who pervades all things, andis called by Avicenna, the Soul of the world. For as the soul lives and moves in allthe members of the body, so that spirit lives and moves in all elementarycreatures, and is the indissoluble bond of body and soul, the purest and most nobleThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic2.htm (1 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"essence in which lie hid all mysteries in their inexhaustible fullness of marvelousvirtue and efficacy. Moreover, they ascribe to it infinite Divine power and virtuewhen they say that it is the Spirit of the Lord who fills the Universe, and in thebeginning moved upon the face of the waters. They also call it the spirit of truththat is hid in the world, and cannot be understood without the inspiration of theHoly Spirit, or the teaching of those who know it. It is found potentiallyeverywhere, and in everything, but in all its perfection and fulness only in onething. In short, it is a Spiritual Essence which is neither celestial nor infernal, butan aerial, pure, and precious body, in the middle between the highest and lowest,the choicest and noblest thing under heaven. But by the ignorant and the beginnerit is thought to be the vilest and meanest of things. It is sought by many Sages, andfound by few; suspected by those that are far away, and received by those thatare near; seen by all, but known by few, as you may see from the following lines:Into three the great good is divided, yet it is one, and highly esteemed by theworld. Men have it before their eyes, handle it with their hands, yet know it not,though they constantly tread it under their feet It is the greatest wealth, and hewho knows the Art may rival the richest.AN ENIGMA OF THE SAGES.In which the underlying substance of the Art, called the Phoenix of the Sages, isfound to be thrice threefold.If I tell you three parts of a thing you have no cause to complain. Seek one ofthree, and of the three one will be there: for where there is body and soul, thereis also Spirit and there shine salt, sulphur, and mercury. Trust my word, seek thegrass that is trefoil. Thou knowest the name, and art wise and cunning if thoufindest it.ANOTHER ENIGMA(Much easier.)There is one thing in this world which is found occasionally. It is bluish-grey andgreen, and, wonderful to say, there is in this thing a red and white colour. Itflows like water, yet it makes not wet ; it is of great weight, and of small. I mightgive it a thousand names, yet the thousand know it not. It is mean to look upon,yet to the Sage it is precious. He who solves it with the second and condenses itwith the third, he has our glorious subject.YET ANOTHER ENIGMA.Everything contributes to the formation of this Stone. It is conceived below theearth, born in the earth, quickened in heaven, dies in time, obtains eternal glory.Now when you have the substance indicated (which is in part heavenly in partearthly, and in its natural state a mere confused chaos without certain name orcolour), and know it well (for this knowledge the Sages have always accounted thePrincipal part of this work, then you must give your whole mind to manipulating itin the proper manner. But before doing anything to it with his hands, the studentshould remember not to begin the preparation of this great and inscrutablearcanum before he knows well the spirit that lurks in it according to its essentialqualities and properties. \"With this spirit,\" says a certain philosopher, \"you shouldnot meddle until you first have a full and exact knowledge of it. For God ismarvellous in His works, and He is not mocked, I could give some instances of menwho set about this matter with great levity and were heavily punished by meetingThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic2.htm (2 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"(some or them) with fatal accidents in their laboratories. For this work is no lightthing, as many suppose, perhaps, because the Sages have called it child's play.Those to whom God has revealed His secrets may indeed find the experimentsimple and easy. But do thou carefully beware of exposing thyself to great dangerby unseasonable carelessness. Rather begin thy work with reverent fear and aweand with earnest prayer, and then thou wilt lie in little danger.\"Now when you have exercised yourself with exceeding diligence in the oratory, thematter being ready to your hand, go into the laboratory, take the substanceindicated, and set to work in the following manner.Above all things you must let it be your first object to solve this substance (or firstEntity, which the Sages have also called the highest natural good). Then it must bepurged of its watery and earthy nature (for at first it appears an earthy, heavy,thick, slimy, and misty body), and all that is thick, nebulous, opaque, and dark init must be removed, that thus, by a final sublimation, the heart and inner soulcontained in it may be separated and reduced to a Precious essence. All this canbe accomplished with our Pontic and Catholic water, which in its refluent courseirrigates and fertilizes the whole earth, and is sweet, beautiful, clear, limpid, andbrighter than gold, silver, carbuncles, or diamonds. This blessed water is enclosedand contained in our Matter.Then the extracted Heart, Soul, and Spirit must once more be distilled andcondensed into one by their own proper salt (which in the interior of the substanceis first of a blood-red colour, but then becomes of a bright, clear, and transparentwhite, and is called by the Sages the Salt of Wisdom). You have thus first, by whatis called the anterior process, separated the pure from the impure, and firstrendered the visible invisible, then, again, the invisible visible or palpable (but yetno longer so gross and shapeless as it was at first), and it is now a bright body witha pleasant, penetrating smell, and withal so subtle and ethereal that if it were notfixed it would evaporate and vanish away. For this reason the Sages call itmercurial water, or water of the sun, or mercury of the sun, or mercury of thewise. But so long as it remains in the aforesaid form it would, if used as amedicine, produce no good effect, but rather act as a poison. If, therefore, youwish to enjoy its glorious virtue, and manifold power, you must subject it to somefurther chemical processes.For this purpose you must diligently observe the working of Nature (extending overa considerable period of time), and strictly follow her guidance. When you havethis knowledge, you should take two parts of the aforesaid prepared aqueousmatter, and again three different parts The first two parts you should keep; but tothe three parts add another matter, viz., the most precious and divinely endowedBody of Gold, which is most intimately akin to the First Matter. Of this add onetwelfth for the first fermentation; for both, the spiritual and heavenly preparedsubstance, and this earthly Body of Gold, must be joined together, and coagulatedinto one body.But it should be noted that common gold is useless for this purpose, beingunsuitable and dead. For though it has been declared by God the Omnipotent to bethe most precious and beautiful of metals, yet so long as it lay hid in the mine itsperfect growth and development was hindered. Daily use, moreover, blunts itsindwelling powers, namely, sulphur, or its soul, and it is continually becomingmingled and defiled with other things that are foreign to its nature. Hence itbecomes daily more and more unfit to be the subject of art. You must, therefore,seek to obtain gold which has a pure, living spirit, and of which the sulphur is notyet weakened and sophisticated, but is pure and clear (by passing throughantimony, or by the heaven and sphere of Saturn, and being purged of all itsdefilement): otherwise the first substance, being spiritual and ethereal, will notThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic2.htm (3 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"combine with it. For this Magistery deals only with pure bodies, and suffers nounclean thing near, on, or around it.Now when these unequal parts of the water and gold (differing not only in quality,but also in quantity, for the first is, after its preparation, ethereal, thin, subtle,and soft, while the other is very heavy, firm and hard) have been combined in asolutory alembic, and reduced to a dry liquid or amalgam, they should be left sixor seven days exposed to gentle heat of at least a tepid character. Then take onepart of the three parts of water, and pour it into a round, oval glass phial, similarto an egg in shape; put the tempered liquid in the midst thereof, and leave it oncemore for six or seven days; the Body of the Sun will then be gradually dissolved bythe water. Thereupon both will begin to combine, and one will mingle with theother as gently and insensibly as ice with warm water. This union the Sages haveshadowed out in various ways, and likened it, for instance, to the wedlock of abride and bridegroom (as in the Song of Solomon). When this is done, add the thirdpart (which you have kept) to the rest, but not all at once, or in one day, but inseven different installments: otherwise the Body would become too liquid, andentirely corrupted by too much moisture.For as seed, when cast into the ground, is destroyed and rendered useless by anexcess of moisture and rain, so our work cannot prosper unless the water isjudiciously administered. All this being done, let the phial be carefully closed andsealed, to prevent the compound from evaporating or losing its odour; and place itin the furnace, there exposing it to a gentle, continuous, airy, vaporous, andwell-tempered heat, resembling the degree of warmth with which the hen hatchesher eggs.[NOTE. The Sages have said much about vaporous fire, which they have called thefire of wisdom, which is not elementary or material, but (according to them)essential and preternatural. They also call it the Divine fire, i.e., the water ofmercury, roused into action by common fire.] Digest and heat it well, yet takecare that none of it is sublimed, or, in the parabolic language of the Sages, thatthe wife does not rule the husband, and that the husband does not abuse hisauthority over the wife, &c. - if you do this, the whole will proceed normally,without any interference on your part (except that, of course, you must keep upthe fire). At first the earthly Body of the Sun is totally solved, and decomposed,and robbed of all strength (the Body, which was first of a muddy impurity,changing to a coal-black colour, called by the Sages the Raven's Head, within thespace of forty days), and is thus despoiled of its Soul. The Soul is borne upward,and the Body, being severed from the Soul, lies for some time, as if dead, at thebottom of the still, like ashes. But if the fire is increased, and well tempered, theSoul gradually descends again in drops, and saturates and moistens its Body, and soprevents it from being completely burned and consumed. Then, again, it ascendsand descends, the process being repeated seven times. The temperature you mustkeep at the same point from beginning to end. Haste slowly - for it is of thegreatest importance that the influence of the fire should be brought to bear gentlyand gradually. In the meantime you will observe various chemical changes (e.g., ofcolour) in the distilling vessel, to which you must pay careful attention. For if theyappear in due order, it is a sign that your undertaking will be brought to aprosperous issue.First there appear granular bodies like fishes' eyes, then a circle around thesubstance, which is first reddish, then turns white, then green and yellow like apeacock's tail, then a dazzling white, and finally a deep red - until at last, underthe rarefying influence of the fire, the Soul and Spirit are combined with theirBody, that lies at the bottom, into a fixed and indissoluble Essence, which unionand conjunction cannot be witnessed without unspeakable admiration and awe.The Sophic Hydrolith (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic2.htm (4 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Then you will behold the revivified, quickened, perfected, and glorified Body,which is of a most beautiful purple colour (like cochineal), and its tincture hasvirtue to change, tinge, and cure every imperfect body, as we shall hereafter showmore in detail.

Thus Ihave most faithfully explained to you the whole process by which this most nobleArt, and highest achievement, to wit, the Egg of the Sages, or Philosopher's Stone,may be begun and successfully completed.If, however, during the operation, any accidental mishap should occur, it must beseen to in time, or else the chemical process will never be brought to perfection.If you(1) observe that before the compound is solved and turns black, anything issublimed, or evaporated, or something resembling a red oil floats on the surface ofthe substance (which is a bad sign);or (2) if before or after it has turned white, it turns red too suddenly;or (3) if, towards the end, it does not properly coagulate;or (4) if the substance is so strongly affected by the heat that, being taken out, itdoes not instantly melt on red hot iron like wax, but tinges and colours the iron,and afterwards will not remain fixed in the fire - you may regard all theseindications as symptoms of a false composition and temperature, or of some kindor other of carelessness.If these defects are not immediately seen to, they will speedily becomeincorrigible. A cunning adept should be acquainted with the various devices bywhich they may be remedied; and I will recount them here for the sake of thebeginner.If one or more of the above defects are observed, the whole compound must againbe taken out of the phial, and once more solved in the aforesaid water of mercury(also called virgin's milk, or the milk, blood, and sweat of the First Matter, or thenever-failing fountain, or the water of life, which nevertheless contains the mostmalignant poison); with this water it must once more be moistened and saturated,and then subjected to the action of the fire, until there is no longer anysublimation or formation of gaseous vapours; or till the final coagulation has dulytaken place, as described above. Of its subsequent fermentation andmultiplication, and of its uses, more will be said in the third part.Of the time required for the whole process, it is impossible to say anything verydefinite; and, indeed, the Sages have put forward the most conflicting opinions onthis point - no doubt because some have been occupied with it longer than others.But if any man will carefully observe the working of Nature, and be guided by herteaching, and in all things hold a middle course, he will gain his object sooner thanone that trusts too blindly to his own wisdom.But I tell thee not to go beyond the middle point of the letter X either in theformer or latter stage of the operation, but to take one half (V) for the time of thesolution and the other half for the composition. Then, again, for the final union,the number XX should be thy guide (unless anything unforeseen should occur). Besatisfied with that space of time. On the other hand, do not try to hurry on theconsummation, for one hour's mistake may throw thee back a whole month. If thoustrivest unduly to shorten the time thou wilt produce an abortion.

Who can exalt Him according to Hisgreatness? We see but the smallest of His works: those that are much greater arehidden from us. For God has made all, and gives understanding thereof to thosethat fear Him. (Sirach xliii.)Concerning the end of this great Art, and the excellence, virtue, efficacy, andunspeakable utility of the marvellous Philosopher's Stone, much has been written:yet has no one been able to tell out its thought-surpassing glory or to adequatelyset forth its fame. All Sages have regarded it as the chief felicity that this earthcan afford, without which no one can attain perfection in this world. For Morienussays: \"He who has this Stone has all, and needs no other help.\" For it includes alltemporal felicity, bodily health, and solid good fortune.They have also commended the Stone for that the spirit and efficacy which lieconcealed in it are the spirit of the Quintessence of all things beneath the disc ofthe moon; on this account they say that it upholds the sky, and moves the sea.They also describe it as the most elect, the most subtle, the purest, and noblest ofall the heavenly spirits, to which all the rest yield obedience as to their King, thatbestows on men all health and prosperity, heals all diseases, gives to theGod-fearing temporal honour and a long life, but to the wicked, who abuse it,eternal punishment. It is also extolled by the Sages because it has never beenknown to fail of effecting its purpose, but is found to be in all proved, perfect, andunerring. Therefore Hermes and Aristotle call it the true, undeceiving, andunfailing arcanum of all arcana, the Divine Virtue which is hidden from the foolish.In brief, they have designated it the chief of all things under heaven, themarvellous conclusion or epilogue of all philosophic works. Hence some devoutSages have affirmed, that it was Divinely revealed to Adam, and by him handeddown to all the holy Patriarchs.For by its aid Noah is said to have built the Ark, Moses the Tabernacle with all itsgolden vessels, and Solomon the Temple, besides accomplishing many other greatdeeds, fashioning many precious ornaments, and procuring for himself long life andboundless riches.Moreover, the Sages own that through its means they invented the seven liberalarts, and sought and obtained sustenance for themselves. God gave them this giftthat they might not be hindered in their researches by poverty, or driven to flatterthe rich for the sake of gain, and thus become contemptible, and as a jest orby-word in His sight. The Stone enabled them to discern the great mysteries of theDivine wonders, and the inexhaustible riches of the Divine Glory. By it their heartswere roused and stirred up to a more intimate knowledge of God. For they soughtnot to obtain great wealth, or the honour and pleasures of this world, but all theirdelight was to search out and contemplate the marvellous secrets of Nature. Theyregarded the works of God with very different eyes, and in a very different mannerthan most men in our own times, who, alas, look on them like cows or calves, andThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic3.htm (1 of 3) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"pursue the study of our noble Art for the sake of wealth, and temporal advantageand pleasure. But they will never find what they seek. For God gives not this giftto the wicked, who despise His word, but to the godly who strive to live honestlyand quietly in this wicked and impure world, and to lend a helping hand to theneedy brethren; or, in the words of the poet:\"God gives this Art to the sincere and good, nor can the world purchase it with allits gold. The vulgar know nothing of this Mystery, for if any man be impious, heseeks the Stone in vain. He who holds it in silence dwells where he would, andfears neither accidents, nor thieves, nor any evil. For this reason this sacred gift isgranted to few: it is in the hands of God, and He gives it to whomsoever He will.\"Much has been said concerning the operation, virtue, and utility of this Art in avariety of writings which have heretofore seen the light, as, for example, untowhat extent the said Stone, prepared and made more than perfect, becomes amedicine which is above every medicine. It has been denominated the universalpanacea, to which not only all diseases yield (as, for instance, leprosy and gout),but by the use of which, old men may become young again, recover their lostfaculties, and their former strength, and by which those who are already half deadmay be revivified and quickened. But, as I am no physician, I will forbear to givean opinion on this point. That the Stone has this virtue, every one that possesses itcan discover for himself. I prefer to set down a few observations concerning thosequalities and uses of the Stone which are known to me by daily experience.In the first place, the practice of this Art enables us to understand, not merely themarvels of Nature, but the nature of God Himself, in all its unspeakable glory. Itshadows forth, in a wonderful manner, how man is the image of the most HolyTrinity, the essence of the Holy Trinity, and the Oneness of Substances in thatTrinity, as well as the difference of Persons; the Incarnation of the Second Personof the Holy Trinity, His Nativity, Passion, Death, and Resurrection; His Exaltationand the Eternal Happiness won by Him for us men; also our purification fromoriginal sin, in the absence of which purification all good actions of men would bevain and void - and, in brief, all the articles of the Christian faith, and the reasonwhy man must pass through much tribulation and anguish, and fall a prey to death,before he can rise again to a new life. All this we see in our Art as it were in amirror, as we shall take occasion to set forth in our Fourth Part. Secondly, itsearthly and natural use consists in changing all imperfect metals, by means of itstincture, into pure and solid gold, as I will try to show as briefly as I can.The Stone or Elixir cannot be used for this purpose in the form in which we left itat the completion of the previous stage of our process; but it should be still furtherfermented and augmented: in the following manner, as otherwise it could not beconveniently applied to imperfect metals and bodies.Take one part of the Essence, and add to it three parts of purest gold, which hasbeen purged and melted by means of antimony, and reduced to very thin plates.Let them be placed together in the crucible.Thereupon the whole compound will be transformed into a pure and efficaciousTincture, which, when applied to base metals, in the ratio of 1::1000, will changethem into pure gold.Note - The purer the metals are, and the greater their affinity to our substance,the more easily are they received by the Tincture, and the more perfect and rapidis the process of regeneration. For the transformation consists in all that is impureand unsuitable being purged off, and rejected like dress in the same mannerflawed stones can be transmuted into precious diamonds, and common crystal canbe so tinged as to become equal to the most precious stones.Moreover, many other things may be done with the Tincture which must not berevealed to the wicked world. These virtues of the Stone, and others of a like kind,The Sophic Hydrolith (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic3.htm (2 of 3) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"are looked upon as the least important by the Sages, and by all Christians on whomGod has bestowed this most precious gift. Such men think them vile indeed whencompared with the knowledge of God and of His works which is afforded by theStone.For let me tell you that he on whom the Most High has conferred the knowledge ofthis Mystery esteems mere money and earthly riches as lightly as the dirt of thestreets. His heart and all his desires are bent upon seeing and enjoying theheavenly reality of which all these things are but a figure; as Solomon, the wisestof wise Kings, testifies in chapter vii. of the Book of Wisdom, where he says: \"Ipreferred wisdom before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing incomparison of her. Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because allgold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay beforeher.\" Those, therefore, that desire this Art as a means of procuring temporalhonour, pleasure, and wealth, are the most foolish of men; and they can neverobtain that which they seek at so great an expense of money, time, and trouble,and which fills their hearts, their minds, and all their thoughts. For this reason theSages have expressed a profound contempt for worldly wealth (not as though itwere in itself a bad thing, seeing that it is highly commended in Holy Scripture asan excellent gift of God, but because of its vile abuse). They despised it because itseemed to hinder men from following the good and the true, and to introduce amischievous confusion into their conceptions of right and wrong. These abuses ofmoney the illustrious Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus has graphically described inthe poem entitled the \"Zodiac of Life\", under the sign of Sagittarius, where hedraws a vivid picture of the evils of avarice. To this poem I would therefore referthe gentle reader.From this poem we may gather how lightly this distinguished man, thoughevidently a possessor of the Stone, as appears out of his \"Zodiac of Nature\", heldgold and silver, and all things temporal, in respect of virtue.Nor is his case by any means exceptional. All Sages have regarded wisdom, and theknowledge of heavenly things, as far better than the transient things of earth, andhave so ordered their lives and actions that at the last they might obtainimmortality and eternal glory. This feeling is well expressed by Solomon, in hisBook of Proverbs (cp. xvi.), where he says: \"How much better is it to get wisdomthan gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!\" - and againin the xxii. chapter: \"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, andknowledge rather than silver and gold.\" The same aspiration prompted thefollowing words of the son of Sirach: \"See that thou keep a good name, for it isbetter than a thousand treasures of gold.\" By reason of these and other virtueswhich result from the philosophy of the Stone, the Sages have never wearied ofextolling its marvellous excellence; and they have taken great pains to make itknown to the worthy, in order that its wisdom might be accepted and practicallyexhibited by them. But to the foolish everything is obscure and difficult to beunderstood. This is the gist of the first six chapters of Solomon's Book of Proverbs,where he says that men should strain every nerve to attain to our wisdom. In theBook of Ecclesiastes, too, he uses the following words: \"My son, be satisfied with alowly station: for it is better than all that this world desires. The greater thou art,the more humble thyself, and God will give thee grace. For the Lord is a most HighGod, and does great things through the lowly.\"Next: The Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)The Sophic Hydrolith (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic3.htm (3 of 3) [27/05/2004 23:01:55]"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)PART IV.\"I will open my mouth in parables, and declare things hidden from the foundationof the world.\" (Psalm LXXVIII. and Matthew XIII.)When it pleases Almighty God by His Divine Word to make known unto the humanrace His marvellous, deep, and celestial mysteries, He is wont to do so in parables,and to shadow forth His meaning in things familiar to our eyes which are depictedvisibly before us. For instance, when pronouncing upon Adam in Paradise, after theFall, the sentence of death, He told him that as he was made and formed of dust,he should also return to dust - dust being a thing which in itself has no life. Again,when promising to Abraham an innumerable posterity, He illustrated His meaningby pointing to the stars of the heavens, the sand of the sea shore, and the dust ofthe earth. In the same manner, God made use of divers precious types in declaringHis will to the children of Israel through the Prophets. This practice was alsoadopted in the New Testament by Christ Himself - the Foundation and ExpressImage of the Truth - who set forth His teaching in parables in order that it mightbe better understood. So He compares His Divine and Blessed Gospel - the highesthappiness of man - to seed that is sown in a field, amongst which the enemyscatters evil seed; to a hidden treasure; to a pearl of great price; to a grain ofwheat; to a mustard seed; to leaven, etc. [Cf. Luke viii. Matthew xiii. and xxiiLuke xix. Matthew xx.]The Kingdom of Heaven He describes under the image of a great Wedding Feast.The Christian Church, again, He compares to a Vineyard, and to a King calling uponhis servants to render up an account. He also uses the similitude of a noble lordwho entrusted his goods to his servants, of a lost sheep, a prodigal son, and othersof a similar nature. [Cf. Matthew xviii. Luke xvi Matthew xxv. Luke xviii. Mark xii.Luke xviii. Luke x.]These types and similitudes were given to us on account of our human infirmity,which prevents us from understanding and picturing to ourselves the things ofheaven. And since it is God's wont to reveal His mind in parables and figures, wecan but regard it as of a piece with all the other dealings of God, that the ChiefGood, His Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who by His obedience saved allmankind from eternal death and restored to us the Kingdom of Heaven, shouldhave expressed His nature in a concrete bodily form. This is the greatest mysteryof Almighty God, and the highest and worthiest object of knowledge.[Ephesians iii. Collossians i. Isaiah xlv.: \"Let the heavens drop down from above,and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open and bring forth theSaviour.\"]And although this great Good had been prefigured to us in the Old Testament bytypes such as the sacrifice of Isaac, the ladder of Jacob, the betrayal andwonderful exaltation of Joseph the brazen serpent, Samson, David, and Jonah:yet, besides all these, Almighty God deigned to give us a fuller revelation and aThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (1 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"corporal, visible, and apprehensible idea of His heavenly treasures and gifts in thePerson of His Son. This earthly and bodily manifestation He plainly foretold in theProphet Isaiah (chapter. xxviii.): \"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a cornerstone, a tried stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.\" Tothe same effect the Royal Seer David speaks, though the Holy Spirit, in Psalmcxviii.: \"The Stone which the builders rejected is become the head stone of thecorner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.\" This type, theaforesaid Corner Stone, Christ applies to Himself (Matthew xxi.) when He says:\"Have ye never read in the Scriptures? The Stone that the builders rejected isbecome the chief stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellousin our eyes. And whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken; but onwhomsoever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder.\" And Peter (Acts, iv.) andPaul in his Epistle to the Romans ix. repeat almost the same words.This tried, blessed, and heavenly Stone Jesus Christ was longingly expected fromthe beginning of the world by the Fathers and Holy Patriarchs; God-enlightenedmen prayed that they might be accounted worthy to see the promised Christ in Hisbodily and visible form. And if they rightly knew Him by the Holy Spirit, they werecomforted by His presence in their lives, and had an invisible Friend on whom theycould stay themselves, as upon a spiritual fulcrum, in trouble and danger evenunto the end of their life.But although that heavenly Stone was bestowed by God as a free gift on the wholehuman race, the rich as well as the poor (Matthew xi., 6.); yet to this very daycomparatively few have been able to know and apprehend Him. To the majority ofmankind He has always been a hidden secret, and a grievous stumbling block, asIsaiah foretold in his eighth chapter: \"He shall be for a stone of stumbling and arock of offence, a gin and a snare, so that many shall stumble and fall, and bebroken, and be snared, and be taken.\" The same was revealed to the aged Simeon,when he spake thus to Mary, the Mother of the Corner Stone: \"Behold, He shall befor a fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be spokenagainst.\" To this St. Paul also bears witness (Romans ix.): \"They fell from the Stoneof offence, and the rock of stumbling. He that believes in Him shall not beconfounded.\" This Stone is precious to them that believe, but to the unbelieving \"astone of offence and stumbling, seeing that they are broken against the word, andbelieve not in Him on whom they are founded (Ecclessiastes xliii.).\" In all theserespects the Precious, Blessed, and Heavenly Stone agrees most wonderfully withour earthly, corporal, and philosophical Stone; and it is, therefore, well worth ourwhile to compare our Stone with its Heavenly prototype. We shall thus understandthat the earthly philosophical Stone is the true image of the real, spiritual, andheavenly Stone Jesus Christ.Thus, then, those who would truly know and prepare the first Matter of thePhilosopher's Stone (the chief and principal mystery of this earth) must have adeep insight into the nature of things, just as those who would know the HeavenlyStone (i.e., the indissoluble, triune essence of the true and living God) must have aprofound spiritual insight into the things of heaven: hence we said in our first part,that the student of our Art must first have a thorough knowledge of Nature and herproperties. If a man would come to know the highest good, he must rightly know,first God, and then himself (Acts xvii: \"For in Him we live,\" etc.). If anyone learn toknow himself and God (i.e. our duty as men, our origin, the end of our being, andour affinity to God), he has the highest scholarship, without which it is impossibleto obtain happiness, either in this world, or in the world to come.If we would find that high and heavenly Stone, we must remember that, as ourearthly Philosophical Stone is to be sought in one thing and two things, which aremet with everywhere, so we must look for Him nowhere but in the eternal Word ofThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (2 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"God, and the Holy Scripture (consisting of the Old and New Testaments) - as Godthe Father testified at His Transfiguration on Mount Tabor (Mark ix., Luke ix.),when He said: \"This is My Beloved Son: hear ye Him.\" In the same way Christ, theessential and eternal Word of God, speaks of Himself: \"No one comes to theFather, but by Me\" - according to the Scripture, the infallible testimony of theDivine Word (Isaiah xxxiv.). In Isaiah viii. we find the words: \"to the Law and theTestimony.\" And Christ, the aforesaid Corner Stone, bears witness to the necessityof Scripture, when He says: \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye believe that yehave eternal life, and it is they that testify of Me.\" Therefore, David says in Psalmcxix., long before the coming of Christ: \"My delight, O Lord, is in Thycommandments, for they are my counsellors; Thy word is a lamp unto my feet; Irejoice in the way of Thy testimonies more than in great riches. Also, I considerThy ways, and walk in Thy testimonies\" [Genesis xiii. Psalm xlv. Isaiah ix, 49.Jeremiah xxxii. John x, 14. Romans ix. I. Corinthians v.]Moreover, when and where the First Matter of this heavenly Stone was founded(\"from the beginning of the world\"), is expressly set forth in several passages ofHoly Scripture, especially in the fifth chapter of Micah: \"Whose goings forth havebeen from of old; from everlasting.\" When the Jews asked the Corner StoneHimself who He was, He answered: \"I that speak to you was from the beginning,\"and again: \"Before Abraham was, I am.\" From these passages it follows that He hadHis being, without a beginning, from all eternity, and that He will abidethroughout all eternity.And although this knowledge is to be found and obtained nowhere but in the Oldand New Testaments, nevertheless he who would gain it must proceed with thegreatest care (II. Timothy, lit), for one false step may render all our subsequentlabour useless. He who would gain a golden understanding of the word of truth,should have the eyes of his soul opened, and his mind illumined by the inward light(I. John, v.) which God has kindled in our hearts from the beginning; for he whostrives to obtain this knowledge without the Divine light, may easily mistake Saulfor Paul, and choose a false road instead of the right path. This happenscontinually in regard to our earthly Stone. Ten persons may read the samedescription of it, and yet only one may read the words aright. So the majority ofmankind daily miss the knowledge of the Heavenly Stone; not because it is notbefore their eyes, but because they have not eyes to see it. Therefore Christ says:(Luke xi.) \"The eye is the light of the body, and if the eye be dark the whole bodywill be full of darkness.\" In the seventeenth chapter of the same Gospel He says:\"Behold the kingdom of God is within you.\" From these words it most clearlyappears that the knowledge of the light in man must come from within, and notfrom without.The external object, as they say, or the letter, is written for the sake of ourinfirmity, as a further aid to the implanted light of grace (Matthew xxiv.), as alsothe outward spoken word is used as an auxiliary means for the conveyance andadvancement of knowledge. For example, if a white and a black tablet were putbefore you, and you were asked to say which was white and which black, youwould not be able to answer the question if you had no previous knowledge ofthose colours; your ability to do so, comes, not from looking at the tablets, butfrom the knowledge that before was in your mind. The object only stirs up yourperceptive faculty, and calls out the knowledge that before was in you, but doesnot of itself afford that knowledge. In the same way, if any one put into your handa flint, and asked you to bring outward and visible fire out of it for him, you wouldbe unable to do so without the steel that belongs to it, with which you would haveto elicit the spark slumbering in the stone. Moreover, you would have to catch andfan it into flame on a piece of tinder - or else the spark would immediately vanishThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (3 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"again. If you do this, you will have a bright fire, and so long as you keep it up, youwill be able to do with it whatever you like. In the same manner, the heavenlylight slumbers in the human soul, and must be struck out by outward contact,namely, by the true faith, through reading and hearing, and through the Holy Spiritwhom Christ restored to us, and promised to give us (John xiv.: \"No man comes tothe Father but by me\"), and to put into our dark, but still glowing hearts, as into akind of tinder, where He may be fanned and kindled into a bright flame, workingthe will of God in our souls. For He delights to dwell in light unapproachable, andin the hearts of believers. Although no man ever has, or ever can, see God with hisoutward bodily eyes, yet with the inward eyes of the soul He may well be seen andknown. But notwithstanding that inward light casts its bright beams over the wholeworld, and into the heart of every man without any difference, the world, byreason of its innate corruptness, cannot see it rightly, and refuses to acknowledgeit; and on this account so many false and pernicious notions are current concerningit. But we shall do well to consider that God has, not without a good purpose,furnished our heads with two eyes and two ears; for He would thereby teach usthat man has a double vision and a double hearing; namely, the outward and theinward. With the inward he is to judge spiritual things, and the outward is also toperform its own proper office. The same distinction we find in the spirit and theletter of Scripture. For this reason I thought fit to explain this matter for the sakeof students of the simple sort, who might otherwise be at a loss to apprehend thefull significance of the triune Stone.Again, as the substance of the earthly Stone is nothing accounted of in the world,and rejected by the majority of mankind, so Christ, the eternal Word of theFather, and the Heavenly Triune Stone, is lightly esteemed in this world, andscarcely even looked at; nay, we may say that nothing is so profoundly and utterlydespised by mankind, as the Saving Word of God. Hence (Corinthians I, 2) it iscalled foolishness by the wise of this world. Nor is it only contemned and regardedas worthless; it is even proscribed and laid under a ban, like some false hereticaldoctrine, and it is grievous for a God-fearing man to listen to the blasphemouswords that are spoken against it. But the believer must be tried by it, and theworld sifted by its appearance. So St. John says (cp. i.): \"He came unto His own,and they received Him not;\" and again: \"He was in the world, and the world knewHim not.\"Again, as the physical and earthly water-Stone of the Sages has, on account of itsunsearchable excellence, been called by a great variety of names by the multitudeof philosophers, so the Heavenly Light, the one Noumen and Illuminant, whoseriches and glory are past finding out, is designated in Holy Scripture by a largenumber of titles. We will go through the most important names of both. ThePhilosopher's Stone is called the most ancient, secret or unknown, natural,incomprehensible, heavenly, blessed, sacred Stone of the Sages. It is described asbeing true, more certain than certainty itself, the arcanum of all arcana - theDivine virtue and efficacy, which is hidden from the foolish, the aim and end of allthings under heaven, the wonderful epilogue or conclusion of all the labours of theSages - the perfect essence of all the elements, the indestructible body which noelement can injure, the quintessence; the double and living mercury which has initself the heavenly spirit - the cure for all unsound and imperfect metals - theeverlasting light - the panacea for all diseases - the glorious Phoenix - the mostprecious of treasures - the chief good of Nature - the universal triune Stone, whichis naturally composed of three things, and, nevertheless, is but one - nay, isgenerated and brought forth of one, two, three, four, and five. In the writings ofthe Sages we may also find it spoken of as the Catholic Magnesia, or the seed ofthe world, and under many other names and titles of a like nature, which we mayThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (4 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"best sum up and comprehend in the perfect number of one thousand. And as theearthly Philosopher's Stone and its substance have a thousand names, so an infinitevariety of titles is even more justly predicated of the Chief Good of the Universe.For He is God, the Word of God, the Eternal Son, the real, eternal, tried, andprecious corner and foundation Stone which the builders refused and rejected. Heis true, and more ancient than all things seeing that He was before the foundationof the world, and from everlasting. He is the true, hidden, and unknown God,supernatural, incomprehensible, heavenly, blessed, and highly praised. He is theonly Saviour, and the God of Gods (Deuteronomy x.). Sure He is, and true, andcannot lie (Numbers xxiii., Romans iii.). He is the only Potentate who does whatHe will, according to His good pleasure. He is secret and eternal, and in Him lie hidall the treasures and mysteries of knowledge (Romans xvi., Collossians ii.). He isthe only Divine virtue and omnipotence, which is unknown to the foolish, or thewise of this world. He is the only true essence of all elements, seeing that of Himall things are and were created (Romans ii., James i.). He is the quintessence, theessence of all essences, and yet Himself not an essence of anything. He has inHimself the Heavenly Spirit which quickens all things with life itself (Wisdom vii.,Isaiah xlii., John xiv.). He is the one perfect Saviour of all imperfect bodies andmen, the true heavenly physician of the soul, the eternal light that lights all men(Isaiah lx., John i.), the universal Remedy of all diseases, the true spiritualpanacea. He is the glorious Phoenix that quickens and restores with His own bloodHis little ones whom the old Serpent, the Devil, had wounded and killed. He is thegreatest treasure, and the best thing in heaven or upon earth, the triune universalessence, called Jehovah - of one, the Divine essence - of two, God and Man - ofthree, namely three Persons - of four, namely three Persons, and one DivineSubstance - of five, namely of three Persons, one Divine, and one HumanSubstance. He is also the true Catholic Magnesia, or universal seed of the world, ofWhom, through Whom, and to Whom are all things in heaven and upon earth - theAlpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord that is, and was, and isto come, the Almighty (Apoc. i.).But again, as in the case of the philosophical work, it is not enough for anyone toknow its substance and its triune essence, with the quality and property thereof, ifhe does not also know where to obtain it, and how to become a partaker of itsbenefits - which can only be done, as we said above, by dissolving the substanceinto its three parts, decomposing it, and so depriving it of its caliginous shadowand hirsute essence, subliming its inner hidden heart and soul by means of thesweet, universal, fiery, marine water (extracted from itself) into a volatile essence- so we cannot know that glorious triune Essence, called Jehovah, unless the imageof Him is first dissolved and purified in our own souls, the veil of Moses (i.e., ourown desperate sinfulness which prevents us from seeing God as He is) being takenaway, and our inner heart and soul being purified, cleansed, and sublimed by theDivine illumination of Him that dwells within, namely, Christ, who washes ourhearts like pure water (Isaiah xliv.), and fills them with His sweet and gentlecomfort. So you first behold the wrath, but afterwards the love of God.Once more: As our Matter, in the philosophical work, after being dissolved into itsthree parts or principles, must again be coagulated and reduced into its ownproper salt, and into one essence, which is then called the salt of the Sages: soGod, and His Son, must be known as One, by means of their essential substance,and must not be regarded as two or three Divinities, possessing more than oneessence. When you have thus known God through His Son, and united them by thebond of the Holy Spirit, God is no longer invisible, or full of wrath, but you mayfeel His love, and, as it were, see Him with your eyes, and handle Him with yourhands, in the person of Jesus Christ, His Son and express image. But even thisThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (5 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"knowledge of the Triune God will avail you little, unless you continue to advanceand grow in His grace, for God otherwise will be still terrible, and as it is said ofHim (Deuteronomy vii, 18), \"a consuming fire.\" For as the substance of the Sages,after all the changes that it has undergone, will do more harm than good as amedicine applied to the body, without the final preparation, so unless you fullyand perfectly apprehend Christ, the mere knowledge of Him will tend to yourcondemnation rather than to the salvation of your soul (I. John, iv.). Therefore ifyou wish to become a partaker of Christ, and if you desire to possess and enjoy Hisheavenly gifts and treasures, you must advance in the personal knowledge ofChrist, and look upon Him, not merely as a pure and immaterial Spirit, but as theSaviour who in the fulness of time took upon Himself a human body, and becamethe Son of Man, as well as the Son of God.For as in our philosophical work another most noble and cognate metallic bodymust be united to our first substance (if it is to be rendered effectual for theperfecting of other metals), and joined together with it into one body, so theDivine Nature of the Son of God had to take upon itself, as it were, anotherkindred \"metallic\" body, namely our human nature, our human flesh and blood(which, having been created in the image of God, has the greatest affinity withHim), and to be joined with it into one indissoluble whole, in order that He mighthave the power of bringing imperfect men to perfection.But again, we said that common gold, on account of its imperfection and impurity,would not combine with our substance, because its manifold defects had renderedit \"dead\" and useless for our purpose, and that, for this reason, it must first receivea bright and pure body (not adulterated or weakened by the presence of badinternal sulphur). In the same way, the Divine essence of the Son of God could notbe joined to common human nature, which is conceived in sin, defiled withhereditary uncleanness, and many actual sins and besetting infirmities (though allthese are no integral part of human nature as such), but required a pure, sinless,and perfect humanity.For if the earthly Adam, before the Fall (though after all only a created being),was holy, perfect, and sinless, how much more must the heavenly Adam, to whomthe only begotten Son of God was joined, have a perfect humanity? Therefore theheavenly, eternal, fundamental Corner Stone, Jesus Christ (like the earthlyPhilosophical Stone), is now One, uniting in Himself, after an inscrutable manner,a dual nature of admirable generation and origin, and the properties both of Godand of man. For according to His Divine Nature, He is true God, of the Substance ofHis heavenly and eternal Father, and the Son of God, whose goings out (as theScripture says) were from everlasting (Micah v.). According to His human nature,on the other hand, He was born in the fullness of time as a true and perfect man,without sin, but with a real body and soul (Matthew xxvi.). Therefore He noweternally represents the indissoluble and personal union of the Divine and thehuman substance, the oneness of the natures of God and man.It is much to be wished that the eyes of our self-opinionated doctors were opened,or the nebulous film, or sophistical mask, which obscures their vision, taken away,that so they might see more clearly. I am particularly alluding to the Aristotelians,and other blind theological quibblers, who spend their lives in wrangling anddisputing about Divine things in a most unchristian manner, and put forth no end ofmanifold distinctions, divisions, and confusions, thus obscuring the Scripturaldoctrine concerning the union of natures and communication of substances inChrist. If they will not believe God and His Holy Word, they might at least beenlightened by a study of our chemical Art, and of the union of two waters (viz,that of mercury and that of the Sun) which our Art so strikingly and palpablyexhibits. But the scholastic wisdom of their Ethnic philosophy is entirely basedThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (6 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"upon pagan philosophy, and has no foundation in Holy Scripture or ChristianTheology. Their Aristotelian precepts, their \"substances\" and \"accidents,\" entirelyblind them to the true proportions of things, and they forget Tertullian's saying\"that philosophers are the patriarchs of heresy.\" But we do not think it worth whileto pursue this subject any further.Again, as our chemical compound (in which the two essences have been combined)is subjected to the action of fire, and is decomposed, dissolved, and well digested,and as this process, before its consummation, exhibits various chromatic changes,so this Divine Man, and Human God, Jesus Christ, had, by the will of His heavenlyFather, to pass through the furnace of affliction, that is, through many troubles,insults, and sufferings, in the course of which His outward aspect was grievouslychanged; thus He suffered hunger when, after His Baptism and His entrance uponthe ministry of the Word, the Holy Spirit led Him into the wilderness to be temptedof the Devil, and there waged with Him a threefold contest, as an example to allbaptized Christian men, who, having declared themselves followers of Christ, are,like Him, tempted, and have to sustain the shock of various grievous assaults.Again, He was subject to weariness, He shed tears, He trembled, He wrestled withdeath, He shed drops of sweat mingled with blood, He was taken captive andbound, was struck in the face by the high priest's servant, was mocked, derided,spitted upon, scourged, crowned with thorns, condemned to die upon the Cross,which He had to bear Himself; was nailed to it between two malefactors, receivedvinegar and gall to drink, cried out with a loud voice, commended His spirit intothe hands of His Father - and so gave up the ghost and died upon the Cross. Theseand other tribulations, which are faithfully related by the Evangelists, He had tobear in the course of His earthly life.And as the Sages say that the above mentioned process of chemical digestion isgenerally completed within forty days, so the same number seems to have a mostpeculiar significance in Scripture, more particularly in connection with the life ofour Lord. The Israelites remained forty years in the wilderness; Moses was fortydays and forty nights on Mount Sinai; Elijah's flight from Ahab occupied the samelength of time. Christ fasted forty days and forty nights in the wilderness; He spentforty months in preaching upon earth; He lay forty hours in the grave - appeared toHis disciples forty days after His Resurrection. Within forty years from Christ'sAscension Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, and made level with theground.Then again, the Sages have called our compound, while undergoing the process ofdecomposition, the Raven's Head, on account of its blackness. In the same way,Christ (Isaiah liii.) had no form nor comeliness - was despised and rejected of men- a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief - so despised, that men hid, as itwere, their faces from Him; and in the 22nd Psalm He complains that He \"is aworm, and no man,\" \"a scorn and laughing-stock of the people\". We may also seean analogy to Christ in the fact that the decomposed body of the sun lies for sometime dead and lifeless, like burnt-out ashes, at the bottom of the phial, and thatits \"soul\" gradually descends to it under the influence of greater heat, and oncemore saturates, as it were, the dead and decaying body, and saves it from totaldestruction. For when, on the Mount of Olives, and on the Cross, Christ hadexperienced a feeling of utter dereliction, He was afterwards comforted andstrengthened, and nourished (as it were) with Divine nectar from above. And whenat length He had given up the ghost, and all the strength forsook His body, so thatHe went down to the parts below the earth, even there He was preserved,refreshed, and filled with the quickening power of the eternal Deity; and thus, bythe reunion of His spirit with His dead body, quickened, raised from the dead,lifted up into heaven, and appointed Lord and King of all - where, sitting at theThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (7 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"right hand of His Father, He now rules, governs, preserves, and quickens all thingswith the power of His Word. This marvellous Union and Divine Exaltation angelsand men in heaven, upon earth, and under the earth can scarce think upon withoutholy fear, and trembling: awe - Whose power, strength, and purple Tincture (i.e.,Blood) changes us imperfect men and sinners in body and soul, and is a marvellousmedicine for all our diseases, as we shall see further on.We have briefly and simply considered the most obvious analogies that serve toestablish the typical connection between Jesus Christ, the heavenly Corner Stone,and our earthly Philosopher's Stone, and to illustrate its figurative resemblance tothe Incarnation of the Saviour of men. We will now proceed to shew that theearthly Stone also shadows forth His transmuting, strengthening, healing, andquickening power towards us sinful, wretched, and imperfect human beings.For though God created man at the beginning in His own image, and made himmore glorious and perfect than other creatures, and breathed into him a living andimmortal soul, yet by the fall the image of God was defaced, and man waschanged into the very reverse of what God had intended that he should be.But in order that we might be restored to our former glorious state, God in Hisgreat mercy devised the following remedy: As the perfect earthly Stone, orTincture, after its completion extends its quickening efficacy, and the perfectingvirtue of its tincture to other imperfect metals, so Christ, that blessed heavenlyStone, extends the quickening influence of His purple Tincture to us, purifying us,and conforming us to the likeness of His perfect and heavenly Body. For, as St.Paul says: (Romans viii.), He is the first-born among many brethren, as He is alsothe first-born before all creatures, through whom all things in heaven and earthwere created, and reconciled to God. If we who are by Nature impure, imperfect,and mortal, desire to become pure, immortal and perfect, this transmutation canbe effected only through the mediation of the Heavenly Corner Stone Jesus Christ,who is the only holy, risen, glorified, heavenly King, both God and man in the unityof one Person.For as the Philosopher's Stone, which is the Chemical King, has virtue by means ofits tincture and its developed perfection to change other imperfect and basemetals into pure gold, so our heavenly King and fundamental Corner Stone, JesusChrist, can alone purify us sinners and imperfect men with His Blessedruby-coloured Tincture, that is to say, His Blood, from all our natural filth anduncleanness, and perfectly heal the malignant disease of our nature; seeing thatthere is no salvation but in Him, and that no other name is given under heavenwhereby men can obtain happiness and perfection.The blind and insensate world has, indeed, through the craft and deceit of theDevil, tried many other ways and methods of obtaining everlasting salvation, andhas toiled hard to reach the goal; but Christ nevertheless is and remains the onlytrue Saviour and Mediator, who alone can make us appear just in the sight of God,and purify us from our spiritual leprosy - just as, upon earth, there is only oneroyal, saving, chemical Stone by which all imperfect metals must be brought toperfection and all bodily diseases healed (especially that fearful, and otherwiseincurable leprosy). All other spiritual remedies - such as those invented and usedby Jews, Turks, heathens, and heretics - may be compared to the devices of falseand sophistical alchemists; for by them men are not purified, but defiled - notquickened, but enfeebled, and given over to a state of more helpless spiritualdeadness. So the pseudo alchemists, or malchemists, as they may be moreappropriately termed, discover many tinctures and colours by which men are notonly deceived, but, as daily experience teaches, often ruined in fortune, body, andsoul. Again, if we men would be purified and cleansed of our original sin and thefilth of Adam (in whom, through the subtilty of the Cacodaemon, our whole raceThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (8 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"was corrupted in the very Protoplast), we can obtain perfection and eternalhappiness only through the regeneration of water and the Spirit, as the royalchemical substance is regenerated by water and its spirit. In this new and spiritualregeneration, which is performed in baptism through water and the Spirit, we arewashed and purified with the Blood of Christ, united to His Body, and clothed withHim as with a garment (Collossians iii., Ephesians v.). For, as the philosophicalStone becomes joined to other metals by means of its tincture and enters into anindissoluble union with them, so Christ, our Head, is in constant vital communionwith all His members through the ruby tincture of His Blood, and compacts Hiswhole Body into a perfect spiritual building which after God is created inrighteousness and true holiness. Now, that regeneration which is wrought inbaptism through the operation of the Holy Spirit is really nothing but an inwardspiritual renewal of fallen man, by which we become God's friends instead of Hisenemies, and thus heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ (I. Corinthians ii.,Romans xii., Ephesians ii., Hebrews iii.). For to this end Christ died and rose again,that through this means, namely, through His passion, death, resurrection, andascension, He might enter the Holy Place made without hands, and prepare for usthe way to our everlasting Fatherland. Therefore, we, too, as His brothers andsisters, should follow His passion, and grow like Him in love, humility, and all othervirtues, till we are conformed to His glorified body, and until, having lived anddied with Him, we also reign with Him, and share His everlasting glory.But this inward quickening and imitation of Christ, our heavenly King, in our dailylives, is not the outgrowth of our own merit or natural will (for by nature all menare blind, deaf, and dead, as to spiritual things), but is produced solely throughthe effectual working of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us through the blessed laverof regeneration. In like manner, the minerals and metals are in themselves grossand dead, and cannot purify or ameliorate themselves, but are purified, renewed,dissolved, and perfected through the agency of the spagyric spirit. Now when wehave been incorporated in the Body of our heavenly Ring, and washed and cleansedof original sin through His purple Tincture, and so rendered capable of bringingforth the first fruits of the Holy Spirit, we are fed up, like little children, andnourished with the pure and health-giving milk of grace, until at length we becomeliving stones, fit for the heavenly building and the highest priesthood, whichconsists in offering up spiritual sacrifices such as are acceptable to God the Father,through Jesus Christ. For even a Christian, though regenerated through water andthe Word, cannot grasp or apprehend all things at once, but must grow gradually,and daily, in the knowledge of God and of Christ.For as, in our philosophical experiment, the union of the two essences, namely ofthe earthly gold and the heavenly prepared Matter, which have first been reducedto a kind of dry liquid, or amalgam, in a solutory alembic, does not take place allat once (seeing that the different parts are added gradually and at statedintervals), so we must expect the growth of the quickened spirit to be slow andgradual. For when the spiritual union of a man with Christ in baptism has oncetaken place, and he is united once for all with His Body, he must gradually advancein the Christian faith, and assimilate in his soul one article after another, until hehas obtained perfect knowledge, and is firmly established in all the fulness ofconviction.Now the Christian faith, like the prepared aqueous substance, consists of twelvearticles, according to the number of the Apostles, and these again fall into threeprincipal sections, viz. (1) that which treats of our creation, (2) that which dealswith our redemption, and (3) that which describes our sanctification. All thesearticles the Christian must, one by one, and little by little, make his own. Hecannot master them all at once; for if too much spiritual nourishment wereThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (9 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"administered to him at a time, his soul might begin to loathe its food, and hemight be entirely estranged from the faith. Therefore, the third article, forinstance, should be divided into seven parts, and taught in seven different lessons(just as the matter was not put into the phial all at once). When a man has madethe whole faith thoroughly his own, he must carefully preserve it pure from allcorruption and falsification.Moreover, in the chemical process, the Stone cannot bring its influence to bear onimperfect metals, unless it is first combined with three several parts of highlyrefined and purified gold, not because the tincture of the Stone itself is imperfect,but on account of the grossness of the metals which otherwise could not receive itssubtle influence. The Stone itself is perfect; but the base metals are so feeble anddead that they cannot apprehend the angelical and spiritual perfection of theTincture, except through the more congenial medium of gold, refined and fusedthrough Antimony. In the same way, our heavenly King, Jesus Christ, has, throughHis obedience to His Father's will, once for all delivered us from sin and impurity,and made us sons and heirs of God; nevertheless, His saving Blood, the true purpleTincture, cannot be received by us, on account of our inborn infirmity and grosssinfulness, except through three media appointed by God for this purpose, namely:(1), His Holy Word, which is better and purer than earthly gold seven timesrefined; (2), saving faith, which is a marvellous gift of God, comes through theWord of God, unites the hearts of men, and is tried in the fire of affliction; (3),unfeigned love towards God and our neighbour, which is also a gift of God, thefulfilment of the law, and a perfect imitation of God's nature. If we have andpossess in a proper manner these three things, the Word, faith, and love, Christcan operate rightly upon us with his heavenly Tincture, and celestial Unction,make their blessed influence felt throughout our imperfect natures, and thus, bypervading our entire being, cause us to be partakers of His own heavenly nature.But Satan, that grim pseudo-alchymist, ever lies in wait to draw those whom Christhas regenerated, and made sons of God by faith through baptism, and who arewarring the good warfare, and keeping faith and a good conscience, away from theright path - and in this attempt he and his faithful servants, our sinful flesh, andthe wicked, seductive world, are, alas, very frequently successful (for even thejust man falls seven times a day. Proverbs xxiv.). For as he lay in wait for Christ,our Lord, Master, and Guide, and soon after His Baptism made a violent assaultupon Him; so to the present day he spreads his crafty nets and pernicious snares inthe Christian Church. Our Lord he first endeavoured to delude into doubting theWord of God, and questioning His Father's love, by pointing to the want, hunger,and bodily affliction, that God suffered Him to endure in the wilderness. But ifChristians do not yield to this temptation, Satan attacks them on another point,and tries to induce them to place a foolhardy confidence (such as is not warrantedby God's word) in their heavenly Father; just as he strove to persuade Christ tocast Himself down from the pinnacle of the Temple, seeing that God would surelyprotect Him. If this device does not succeed, the Evil One is not ashamed to try athird expedient: he promises us all the riches of this world, and the glory thereof,if we will forsake God, become idolators, and worship Satan himself - a proposalwhich he actually had the hardihood to make to Christ. These Satanic machinationsGod, in His inscrutable wisdom, permits, in order that men may thereby beexercised in faith, hope, patience, and true prayer, and prepared for the agony ofdeath which the old man will one day have to undergo - that thus they may gain afinal victory over their hereditary foe. This victory they will gain if they are taughtby the grace of God how to encounter the Devil's deceitful and crafty wiles.For since, as St. Paul says, we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but withprincipalities and powers, with the rulers of the darkness of this world, with theThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (10 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places; we cannot successfullyoppose our own strength to their spiritual assaults, but we must, after the exampleof our Standard-bearer, Jesus Christ, arm ourselves against our spiritual foes withspiritual weapons, such as the Word of God, and the sword of the Spirit. We musttake from the armoury of the Holy Spirit the breast-plate of righteousness, andhave our loins girt with truth, our feet shed with the preparedness of the Gospel ofpeace; and we must cover ourselves with the great shield of faith, with which weshall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one: for faith in JesusChrist is a most strong shield which no weapon of the Evil Demon has power topierce.Again, we saw that in our chemical operation the regulation of the fire, and a mostpatient and careful tempering of its heat, was of the greatest importance for theproper digestion of the substance. We also spoke of the \"fire of the Sages\" as beingone of the chief agents in our chemical process, and said that it was an essential,preternatural, and Divine fire, that it lay hid in our substance, and that it wasstirred into action by the influence and aid of the outward material fire. In likemanner, the true Word of God, or the Spirit of God, whom Jeremiah compares to afire, lies bid in our hearts, having been planted in our souls by Nature, and onlydefaced and obscured by the fall. This spirit must be aided, roused into action,and fanned into a bright dame, by another outward fire, viz., the daily fire ofgodliness, the exercise of all the Christian virtues in good days and in evil, and thestudy of the pure Divine Word, if, indeed, the internal light of grace, or the Spiritof God, is to work in us, instead of being extinguished. For as an earthly craftsmanpolishes iron, which in itself is cold, till it is heated by continual friction, and as alamp must go out if it is not constantly fed with oil; so the inward fire of man,unless it is assiduously kept up, gradually begins to burn low, and is at lengthcompletely extinguished. Therefore it is indispensable for a Christian diligently tohear, carefully to study, and faithfully to practice the Word of God.Again, what we said of spiritual sight, viz., that it must take place not with theoutward eyes of the body, but with the inward eye of the soul, is equallyapplicable to spiritual hearing. I speak of listening, not to the outward speech ofmen, or to the Pharisaic leaven of the new Scribes, which nowadays, alas, issubstituted for the sincere and unadulterated Word of God, but to the Voice ofGod Himself. I speak of the thrice refined Word of God (Psalm cxix.), whichproceeds out of the mouth of God, and is declared by His Holy Spirit - which is not,as these false teachers presumptuously assert, a vain arid empty sound, but theSpirit, the life, and the saving power of God to all that believe. Of it the RoyalSeer David speaks as follows: \"I will hear what the Lord shall say unto me.\" Of thisinward and Divine hearing of the Word of God, as from a kind of fountainhead,good and living faith, which works by love, takes its source. For it is, as St. Paulsays (Romans x.): \"Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.\"Now if the Word is pure and undefiled, the hearing, too, may be pure andundefiled, and the faith which comes of such hearing will also be true, and showitself by love and humble obedience to the will of God in prayer, praise, andthanksgiving. It will also find expression in all good work towards our neighbour. Tothe exercise of this love Christ exhorts us in His long valedictory discourse (Johnxiii.), and leaves it with us as His farewell saying: \"This is my commandment thatye love each other, even as I also loved you.\" \"If any one say, I know God, and lovenot his brother, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But he who keeps the Wordof God, in him the love of God is perfected\" (I. John, ii.). And again (I. John, iv.):\"God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\" From thesepassages we learn that love is the bond of perfection by which we are united toChrist, and by which we are in Him, He in His Father, and His Father in Him. \"If anyThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (11 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"one,\" says Christ, \"will keep my word, this is he that loves me, and I will love him,and we will come to him and take up our abode with him.\" Again: \"If ye keep mycommandments, ye shall abide in my love.\" But this our love to God must also findexpression towards our neighbour. For \"if any one love not his brother whom he hasseen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen ? And this commandment wehave of Him, that he that loves God love his brother also.\" The nature of this loveis described by St. Paul (I. Corinthians xiii.) in the following words: \"Love sufferethlong, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, andnever fails.\" Hence it appears that there is no true love which does not show itselfin works of kindness towards our fellow men; and hence also it appears that thegood works which are acceptable to God cannot precede faith, but are itsoutgrowth and precious fruit; works do not make faith good and acceptable, but itis faith that gives their real value to works - for we are justified and obtain eternallife by faith alone. And if a regenerate man bear himself thus lovingly and humblyin all his life, he will never lack fruit in due season. For such a man is placed byGod in the furnace of affliction, and (like the hermetic compound) is purged withthe fire of suffering until the old Adam is dead, and there arises a new mancreated after God in righteousness and true holiness, as St. Paul says (Romans vi.) :\"We are buried with Christ by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised upfrom the dead, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\" When this has beenaccomplished, and a man is no longer under the dominion of sin, then there beginsin him something analogous to the solution of the gold added to the substance ofour chemical process. The old nature is destroyed, dissolved, decomposed, and, ina longer or shorter period of time, transmuted into something else. Such a man isso well digested and melted in the fire of affliction that he despairs of his ownstrength and looks for help and comfort to the mercy of God alone. In this furnaceof the Cross, a man, like earthly gold, attains to the true black Raven's Head, i.e.,loses all beauty and reputation in the eyes of the world; and that not only duringforty days and nights, or forty years, but often during his whole life, which is thusoften more full of sorrow and suffering than of comfort and joy. And, through thisspiritual dying, his soul is taken from him, and lifted up on high; while his body isstill upon earth, his spirit and heart are already in his eternal Fatherland; and allhis actions have a heavenly source, and seem no longer to belong to this earth. Forhe lives no longer according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, not in theunfruitful works of darkness, but in the light and in the day - in works that standthe test of fire. This separation of body and soul is brought about by a spiritualdying. For as the dissolution of body and soul is performed in the regenerated gold,where body and soul are separated from one another, and yet remain closetogether in the same phial, the soul daily refreshing the body from above, andpreserving it from final destruction, until a set time: so the decaying and half-deadbodily part of man is not entirely deserted by its soul in the furnace of the Cross,but is refreshed by the spirit from above with heavenly dew; and fed andpreserved with Divine nectar. (For our temporal death, which is the wages of sin,is not a real death, but only a natural and gentle severing of body and soul). Theindissoluble union and conjunction of the Spirit of God, and the soul of theChristian, are a real and abiding fact. And here again we have an analogy to the(sevenfold) ascending and descending of the soul in the chemical process. For thetribulations and temporal sufferings of God's people have now lasted six thousandyears; but during this whole time, men have again and again been refreshed,comforted, and strengthened by the Spirit of God - and so it is now, and ever willbe, until the great universal Sabbath and rest-day of the seventh millennium. Thenthis occasional spiritual refreshing will cease, and everlasting joy will reign, sinceGod will be all in all.The Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (12 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"While the digestion of the dead spiritual body in man goes forward, there may beseen (as in the chemical process) many variegated colours and signs, i.e., allmanner of sufferings, afflictions, and tribulations, including the ceaseless assaultsof the Devil, the world, and the flesh. But all these signs are of good omen, sincethey show that such a man will at length reach the desired goal. For Scripture tellsus that all that are to obtain the eternal beatitude of Christ must be persecuted inthis world, and we must enter into the kingdom of heaven through muchtribulation and anguish. This truth is well expressed in the following words of St.Augustine: \"Marvel not, brother, if after becoming a Christian you are assailed bymany troubles. For Christ is our Head, and, as His members, we must follow andimitate, not only Him, but His life and sufferings. The life of Christ was closelybeset with all manner of tribulations, poverty, insult, mockery, scorn, sorrow, andacute bodily suffering; and it is clear that if you would obtain the life of Christ,you must, like Him, become perfect through suffering. For without theseafflictions and tribulations we cannot come to God. A man who would enterParadise must go through fire and water, whether he be Peter, to whom the keysof heaven were entrusted, or Paul, a chosen vessel of God, or John, to whom allthe secrets of God were revealed. Every brother must enter the kingdom of heaventhrough much tribulation.\"It should further be observed that the Antimony of the Sages with which the goldmust be refined before being added to the Elixir, or royal chemical substance (orbefore undergoing a sudatory bath with ancient grey-headed Saturn) is expressedby the sign [circle with cross at the top]. In the same way, a ball with a cross uponit is put into the hands of the Lord of the Holy Roman Empire, whereby it isindicated that he, too, must experience, and be tried by the tribulations of thisworld, before he can be peacefully seated upon his throne. To all this we may findan analogy in the aforesaid School of the Cross, and the tribulations andpersecutions through which all Christians must pass, and the struggle which theymust wage with grey-headed Saturn, that is to say, the old Adam and Satan, beforethey can enter into everlasting joy and rest.Besides the aforesaid sorrows and afflictions, there are also in this world certainsigns and marvels, and great mundane revolutions, which we must diligentlyconsider and perpend. We must first hear of wars, and rumours of wars, varioussects, plagues, and famines; for all these things are the true forerunners andheralds of our redemption. Then must come the general resurrection of the dead,by which those who obtain the victory through the Blood of the Lamb (for thissecond regeneration is begun and rendered possible by their first regeneration inthis life) pass into a new and unending life through the final indissoluble union oftheir bodies, souls, and spirits. For by the power and effectual working of Christ,our almighty heavenly King (to whom we are joined in a supernatural manner byfaith), we shall be endued with pure spiritual health, strength, glory, andexcellence. This marvellous union of body, soul, and spirit, this Divine glorificationand exaltation of the elect, is a, consideration fraught with reverential andunspeakable awe (like the sight of the final chemical transformation); it is a sightat which the very angels will stand rapt in inexpressible wonder; and then they willsee us pass into the heavens to reign with Christ, and with them, and theministering spirits, in everlasting glory, and joy unspeakable, world without end.To conclude - as, in our chemico-philosophical process, it was possible andnecessary to correct at once any defect or irregularity, since otherwise the wholecompound would be corrupted and rendered useless; so, in the Christian life, everyfault must at once be carefully corrected, and put away, lest it afford a loopholefor Satan, the world, and the flesh, to creep in again, and to cause in us, so tospeak, a pernicious sublimation, or a premature redness (corresponding to the firstThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (13 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"and second chemical defects), or to make us despair of God's mercy when weconsider our many grievous sins, or to stir up in us a spirit of murmuring againstthe great furnace heat of God's discipline (which two latter failings correspond tothe third and fourth chemical defects). If any of these unfortunate accidentshappen to our souls, they must be dissolved again (after the analogy of thechemical compound), by repentance, by the solutory key of holy Absolution, andthus, as often as is required, be purged of sin and post-baptismal defilement byAbsolution, as well as by the pure heavenly milk of the Lord's Supper; which is thesweat of the heavenly Lamb, and water and blood, the fountain of life - which(like the mercurial water of the chemical process) is, to the unworthy and wicked,the most deadly poison, but food, drink, and a source of strength to the repentantbeliever. Thus he may still attain to what corresponds to the final coagulation andperfect chemical condensation, namely, to the heavenly perfection of eternalbeatitude. These two most wholesome remedies for post-baptismal sin (viz,Absolution and the Lord's Supper), God in his mercy has ordained, and entrusted tothe keeping of His most Beloved Church, for the healing of repentant Christianmen. Through her, we are either, by absolution, pronounced free from guilt, or, ifwe remain impenitent, and persist in our wicked course, we are, byexcommunication, delivered over to Satan, that by the destruction of the flesh,our souls may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.EPILOGUE.Thus, gentle and well-wishing reader, I have briefly and simply set forth to you theperfect analogy which exists between our earthly and chemical and the true andheavenly Stone, Jesus Christ, whereby we may attain unto certain beatitude andperfection, not only in earthly but also in eternal life. I might have done so moregrandly and copiously; but you must know that I am neither a theologian, nor,according to the modern fashion, an Aristotelico-theologian, but a simple andunsophisticated layman. For the knowledge which God has committed to me, Ihave obtained, not at any learned academy, but in the universal school of Nature,and by perusing the open book of God. For this reason I have expressed mythoughts simply, and not tricked them out in sesquipedalian words, as is themanner of professional theologians; nor do I pretend to have exhausted thesubject; all that I have done is to throw out some hints for the guidance of thosewho wish to investigate it more carefully. In doing my best, I have alsoendeavoured to do my duty; for every lover of the truth is bound to praise God byrevealing the knowledge entrusted to him. Besides all this, I desired to professpublicly my belief in the true Christian faith; since at the present time manydevout and godly Christians are falsely represented and decried by lying slanderersas heretics. Let not the blasphemies and reckless judgment of the wicked worldtrouble the true Christian, against whom they are directed: for the Devil and hisservants have at all times done to the followers of Christ what they did to ChristHimself Therefore I will say no more on this subject, but I will leave it to bedecided by the Judge of all the world.As to the earthly Stone itself I must ask the reader to study diligently what hasgone before in our treatise as to this subject. For as in an excellent poem a verseis sometimes repeated at least once, so on this point we are accustomed to do thesame, because the reader ought not to direct his aims and thoughts to the earthlyPhilosophical Stone until he has attained a right knowledge of the Celestial Stone,and has prepared it, or, at least, has commenced with the utmost zeal thepreparations of both together. For the earthly Stone is a gift from God, descendingby the clemency of the Celestial Stone. I agree with all the Sages that it would befolly to attempt the study of so profound a mystery without a good previousThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (14 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"knowledge of Nature and her properties. But I also say that it is not merelydifficult, but quite impossible, to prepare the Philosopher's Stone without a trueknowledge of Christ, the heavenly Corner Stone, in whom all Nature lives andmoves, and has its being. This warning should be duly considered; and he whowould not expose himself to the certainty of ignominious failure, should reflectthat the mastery of any art requires persevering exercise, and that, before settingabout this search after the Philosopher's Stone, he must prepare himself by carefuland patient study. If any neglect this warning, his failure will be the result of hisown ignorance and mental immaturity.But I wonder still more that there are to be found some men, who not only studythis Art, but even try to practice it, and yet do not quite know whether it proceedsby natural and legitimate magic, or whether it is not after all a necromantic, orblack art, which is exercised by the illegitimate aid of the powers of hell. No, mygood friend. The Devil, wicked angels, and wicked men, have no power but thatwhich God suffers them to possess - and with our present glorious Art theypositively have nothing whatever to do. It is entirely in the hand of God, whoimparts it to whom He will, and takes it away from whom He will; and He does notsuffer any votaries of pleasure, or evil spirits, to partake of it. He gives it only tothe pure, true, and humble of heart. This excellence is neither known, norunderstood, by the majority of the present generation; and when the sound of itstrikes upon their ears, and they do not comprehend it, they straightway call itfoolishness. On account of this their blindness, that spirit will always be hiddenfrom their minds, and will at length be entirely taken away from them.Let me, however, be permitted to impress one thing on the minds of my pious anddevout readers. In so far as a man orders his life, soul, heart, and actions aright inthe sight of God, in so far will he perceive that he is making good progress in thediscovery, preparation, and use of the Stone. This assertion is the result of my ownpersonal experience during many years, and it embodies my deliberate conviction.Therefore, the best preparation for this study is, in my judgment, a diligentamendment of heart and life.I am aware that I here lay myself open to the objection that it is possible toenumerate several men who actually possessed this Stone, or Tincture, and with ittransmuted base metals into gold and silver; and who yet were not good men, butvain, profligate, and without knowledge of God. To this objection, I answer thatfrom whencesoever these men may have obtained the Tincture, I certainly neverwill believe that they prepared it - i.e., the true and right Tincture - themselves.The tragic end of many of these men, and the headlong destruction brought uponthem by their Tincture, prove but too clearly the truth of what I say. Moreover, allthat call themselves alchemists are not therefore necessarily true possessors of theStone. For, as in other branches of knowledge, there are found many differentschools and sects, so all that are in search of this precious Tincture are calledalchemists, without necessarily deserving the name.In this tract I have spoken of true, natural, and scientific alchemy, which teachesus to distinguish the evil and impure from the good and pure, and thus, to aid theweakness, and correct the corruption, of Nature. We help the metals to arrive atmaturity, just as a gardener may assist fruit, which by some accident is preventedfrom ripening, or as a seed or grain of corn may easily be multiplied by being sownin the ground. Of pseudo-alchemy I neither pretend, nor care, to know anything,because I perceive that the ways of its teachers are crooked, and that theypromise mountains of gold, without being able to redeem the least part of theirpledge; I also see that those who follow them incur great expense, ceaseless toil,and are often ruined in body and soul. Therefore, if you encounter alchemists ofthis description, who speak boastfully of their Art, and offer to teach it you forThe Sophic Hydrolith (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/sophic4.htm (15 of 16) [27/05/2004 23:01:57]"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"money, I warn you to be on your guard against them. For with such men there ismostly a serpent lurking in the grass (Micah ii.).I think I may confidently assert that the cost of preparing the Tincture (apart fromyour own daily maintenance, and the fuel required) does not exceed three florins.For the Matter, as has already been said, is for most part, very common, and maybe everywhere obtained in abundance; and the labour is easy and simple. In brief,the whole design can present no difficulty whatever to those whom God has chosenfor this purpose, i.e., to those who love Him ; but to the wicked it is beset withinsuperable impediments. In conclusion, let me tell you that if God in His graciousmercy should vouchsafe to reveal to you this open secret, it will then become yoursacred duty to use it well, and to conceal your knowledge from the unworthy, toput a seal upon your lips, and to preserve unbroken silence about it If you neglectthis well-meant warning, you may bring upon yourself the anger of God, andpersecutions of wicked men, and be justly punished with temporal and eternalruin.\"If any one seek riches by means of this sacred Art, let him be devout, andsimple-hearted, silent and wise. He who strives not after these virtues, willreceive the opposite of that which he desires: he will be poor, needy, naked andwretched.\"All this, beloved Reader, I desired to enjoin upon you as a farewell admonition. Idevoutly hope that God has opened your eyes, and that you have completelyapprehended my meaning. To explain the matter more clearly and openly than Ihave done, I am forbidden by my vow.

This is graphically shewn and exhibited in the picture before us. First look atthe helmet and the two wings, which signify the love of the Art. They bear us onward to Sophia (Wisdom), who is bright like Phoebus. Her body isnaked because she is ardently loved. She is loved because she has at her disposal the riches of the whole world. He that gazes upon her beauteousform cannot refrain himself from loving her, goddess as she is. Although this love is, as it were, hidden, yet it is constant; and that is indicated bythe mask. Her heart is sincere, her words are modest, righteousness upholds her steps, she is free from malice and guile. Her valiant appearanceshews that she is of an open mind. Yet she seems to be falling too: that is because the base world hates her, and with fierce truculence tries tocast her down to the ground. But evermore she bravely rises on high though ambition moves her not. She is beloved by God and man. Thoughmockery is to her for a garment, as is shewn by the noisy cymbals, yet she cares nothing for it, but cleaves all the more faithfully to wisdom; to itshe lifts her eyes, to it she directs her steps. For she knows that it is the only true salvation, and therefore she occupies herself with it by day andby night. She is not anxious for worldly praise, nor does she heed the hatred and injustice of men, or care for their opinion too little or too much.Much suffering and tribulation are inflicted upon her by this wicked world, yet she bears it with a valiant heart and holds it in disdain. For shepossesses the treasure which gives her all that she desires, and avarice dwells not in her thoughts. That in which the world delights, she accountsas the dirt beneath her feet, since fortune is a wheel, and its revolutions are swift. Therefore she delights to tread the path of thorns, until,leaving the world, she finds rest in the tomb.

I allude more particularly to you, O stolidphilosophaster, who presume to style yourself a practical chemist, a goodphilosopher, and yet are entirely destitute of all knowledge of me, of the trueMatter, and of the whole Art which you profess! For, behold, you break vials, andconsume coals, only to soften your brain still more with the vapours. You alsodigest alum, salt, orpiment, and atrament; you melt metals, build small and largefurnaces, and use many vessels: nevertheless, I am sick of your folly, and yousuffocate me with your sulphurous smoke. With most intense heat you seek to fixyour quicksilver, which is the vulgar volatile substance, and not that out of which Imake metals; therefore you effect nothing. For you do not follow my guidance, orstrive to imitate my methods, rather mistaking my whole artifice. You would dobetter to mind your own business, than to dissolve and distill so many absurdsubstances, and then to pass them through alembics, cucurbites, stills, andpelicans. By this method you will never succeed in congealing quicksilver. For therevivification you use a reverberatory fire, and make it so hot as to rendereverything liquid — thus do you finish your work, and in the end ruin yourself andothers. You will never discover anything unless you first enter my workshop,where, in the inmost bowels of the earth I ceaselessly forge metals: there you mayfind the substance which I use, and discover the method of my work.Do not suppose that I will reveal my secret to you unless you first find the growingseed of all metals (resembling that of the animals and vegetables). I preserve inthe bosom of the earth both that which is used for their generation, and that withwhich they are nourished up.Metals Exist, vegetables Live and Grow, and animals Feel, which is more thanmerely to grow. I make metals, stones, and the atramental substances out ofcertain elements, which I mix and compound in a certain way. These elements youmust seek in the heart of the earth, and nowhere else. Vegetables contain theirown seed, and image; in like manner, animals are propagated, and by the samemeans do generate their own likeness. Everything proceeds by the laws laid downThe Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (1 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"for it. Only you, wicked man, who try to usurp my office, have departed furtherfrom me than any other creature. Metals have no life, or principle of generationand growth, if they lack their own proper seed. The first is accomplished by thefour elements in nine days; the Moon goes through the twelve heavenly signs intwenty-nine and a half days.By the aforesaid laws, winter and summer relieve each other, the elements arechanged, generations take place in the earth — through my working, through theworking of God and the heavens, do all things subsist, the perceptible, the visible,and the invisible. Thus all things in heaven which are comprehended under theMoon, do work, and impart their influence to the substance, which, like a woman,longs to conceive seed. Each star influences its own substance, and according totheir peculiar nature, they produce different things. They work first in heavenabove, then in the earth beneath in the elements, each according to its ownpeculiar virtue; and hence arise species and individual things.You are to know that these manifold influences do not pour themselves fruitlesslyupon the earthly elements. For though their working is invisible, yet it is a mostcertain and real thing. The earth is surrounded by heaven, and from it obtains herbest influences and substances. Every sphere is ready to communicate its truth,and therewith to pervade her centre. Through this motion and heat, there ariseupon earth vapours, which are the first substances. If the vapour is cold and moist,it sinks down again to the earth, and is there preserved; that which is moist andwarm ascends to the clouds. That which is shut up in the earth I change, after along time, into the substance of sulphur, which is the active, and into quicksilver,which is the passive principle. The metals are another mixture of this firstcomposition. The whole is obtained from the four elements, which I form into onemass. This process I repeat so often that you have no excuse for a mistake.After the putrefaction comes the generation, which is brought about by theinternal incombustible warmth heating the coldness of the quicksilver, whichgladly submits to this heat because it wishes to be united to its sulphur. All thesethings, fire, air, and water, I have in one alembic in the earth. There I digest,dissolve, and sublime them, without any hammer, tongs, file, coals, vapour, fire, ''bath of S. Mary\", or other sophisticated contrivances. For I have my own heavenlyfire which excites the elemental according as the matter desires to put on asuitable and comely form. Thus I extract my quicksilver from the four elements, ortheir substance. This is always accompanied by its sulphur, which is its second self,and warms it gradually, gently, and pleasantly. Thus the cold becomes warm, andthe dry moist and oily. But the moist is not without its dry substance, nor is the drywithout its moist: one is conserved by the other in its first essence (which is theelementary spirit of the essence, or the quintessence) from which proceeds thegeneration of our child. The fire brings it forth, and nourishes it in the air, butbefore that, it is decomposed in virgin earth; then water flows forth (or it flowsforth from the water), which we must seek, since it is my first Matter, and thesource of my mineral. For contrary resists strenuously to contrary, and doth in suchwise fortify itself, lest perchance it be carried away in operating; then does itsuffer transmutation, and is stripped of its form by the concupiscence of matter,which incessantly attracts a new form.By my wisdom I govern the first principle of motion. My hands are the eighthsphere, as my Father ordained; my hammers are the seven planets, with which Iforge beautiful things. The substance out of which I fashion all my works, and allthings under heaven, I obtain from the four elements alone.

Fire admits of no corruption, and contains the purest part ofthe quintessence. After Fire, He made the subtle Air, and put into it a part (butnot so large a part) of the quintessence. Then came the visible element of Water,which has as much of the quintessence as it needs. Last of all comes the Earth. Allthese (like all the rest of Nature) He created in a moment of time. The earth isgross and dark, and though it is fruitful, yet it contains the smallest part of thequintessence. At first the elements remained as they were in their separatespheres. So Air is really moist, but is properly tempered by Fire. Water is reallywarm, but obtains its moisture from the air. The Earth is really dry, but it is alsocold; its great dryness renders it akin to fire. Fire, however, is the first ofelements which causes life and growth by its heat.Now all these elements influence and qualify each other, so that each in its turn isnow active, now passive. For instance, Fire works upon air and earth. Earth is themother and nurse of all things, and sustains all that is liable to decay underheaven. Now God has given me power to resolve the four elements into theirquintessence; this is that first substance which in every element is genericallyqualified. I resolve them for my own purpose, and thereby bring about allgeneration. But no one will be able to resolve me into my first substance, as hestrives to resolve the elements. For I alone can transmute the elements and theirforms, and he who thinks otherwise deceives himself. For you will never be able toassign to each substance its proper influence, or to find the correct proportions ofthe elements which are required by that substance. I alone, I say, can formcreated things, and give to them their peculiar properties and substance. By myheavenly mysteries I produce perfect works, which are justly called miracles, asmay be seen in the Elixir which has such marvelous virtue, and is of my ownforming. No art upon earth can add anything to, or improve upon, myworkmanship. Every sane person must see that nothing can be accomplishedwithout a perfect knowledge of the heavenly bodies, or apart from the efficacywhich abides in them; without these everything is error and misuse; and yet,whence is a mere man to obtain this influence, and how is he to apply it to thesubstance? How can he mingle the elements in their right proportions? Even if aman were to spend a long life in the investigation of this secret (says Avicenna, DeVir. Cord., chap. ii.), he would not get any nearer to its solution. It is entrusted tomy keeping alone, and can never be known to any man. By my virtue and efficacy Imake the imperfect perfect, whether it be a metal or a human body. I mix itsingredients, and temper the four elements. I reconcile opposites, and calm theirdiscord.This is the golden chain which I have linked together of my heavenly virtues andearthly substances. I accomplish my works with such unerring accuracy that inthem all my power is strewn forth, and with so much skill that the wisest of mencannot attain to my perfection. Go forth then, and behold my works, you whothink yourself so skilled a workman, and (without any knowledge of me), with yourcoal fires and your S.

Are you not ashamed, afterconsidering my works, to attempt to rival them with your malodorous decoctions inyour coloured and painted vials, and thus lose both your time and your money? Iam at a loss to conceive what you can be thinking. Have pity upon yourself, andconsider my teaching. Try to understand rightly what I tell you, for I cannot lie.Consider how that most glorious metal, gold, has received its beautiful form fromheaven and its precious substance from the earth. The generation of the preciousstones, such as carbuncles, amethysts, and diamonds, takes place in the samemanner. The substance itself is composed of the four elements; its form andqualities it receives through heavenly influences, although the capacity of beingthus wrought upon slumbers in the element and is only brought out and purified inthe course of time. All this is accomplished by my hands alone. I am the architect,and no one else knows the secret of life. For, however wise he may think himself,he does not know how much to take of each element, or where to obtain it, or howto mingle hostile elements so as to allay their discord, or how to bring theheavenly influences to bear on these essences: He cannot even make iron, or lead,or the very basest of metal; how then should he be able to make gold except bystealing my treasure? The object which he desires can be accomplished by my artalone — an art which it is impossible for man to know.And even though we allow gold to be the most precious of metals, yet gold byitself cannot cure diseases, or heal the imperfections of other metals, or changethem into gold. In the same way glass (which might otherwise be the Philosopher'sStone) can never become so soft as to be rendered malleable. Gold alone is themost precious and the most perfect of all the metals. But if you cannot even makelead, or the minutest grain of any metals, or produce the fruit of any herb, howhopeless must your search after the art of making gold appear! Again if you saythat you wish to produce some chemical result, even if it do not turn out to begold, I answer that you thereby only give a fresh proof of your folly. Can you notunderstand that the secret of my innermost working must always remain a sealedbook to you? What Nature does can never be successfully imitated by any createdbeing. Nay, if I made gold out of seven metals, and you do not understand mymethod, how can you ever hope to prepare the substance which itself changes allmetals into the purest gold, and is the most precious treasure that God has givenme? You are foolish and ignorant, if you do not know that this precious thing whichyou seek is, to the created mind, the greatest mystery of Nature, and that it iscompounded by heavenly influences — and thus has power to heal and deliver menfrom all diseases, and to remove the imperfection of the base metals. If,therefore, it is in itself so perfect that it has not its like upon earth, it must surelybe the workmanship of the highest Intelligence, since no one else can even makegold, and certainly not produce a thing which has itself the power of making gold.Surely, to maintain that you are able to prepare such a thing, is like saying thatyou cannot carry ten pounds, but that you are strong enough to carry a hundredpounds. Put to heart, therefore, the true scope and responsibility of your intent.I, myself, again, receive all my wisdom, virtue, and power from heaven, and myMatter, in its simplest form, is the four elements. This is the first principle and thequintessence of the elements, which I bring forth by reductions, time, andcirculations, by which I transmute the inferior into the more perfect, the cold anddry into the moist and warm; and thus I preserve stones and metals in their naturalstate of moisture. This is brought about by the movements of the celestial bodies,for by them the elements are ruled; by their controlling influence like is brought tolike. The purer my substance is, the more excellent are the results produced bythe heavenly influence.

Do you think that that is an organic instrumentwhich gives forth sweet music only when it is touched by the musician's fingers?You take too much upon yourself, you foolish man. Do you not know that therevolutions of the heavens are governed by a mighty Mind, which, by its influence,imparts power to all things?I beseech you to remember that all great things proceed from me, and, in the lastinstance, from God; and not to suppose that the skill of your hands can be asperfect as the operation of Nature. For it is void and vain, and, ape-like, mustimitate me in all things. Nor must you suppose that your distilling, dissolving, andcondensing of your substance in your vessel, or your eliciting of water out of oil, isthe right way of following me. Far from it, my son. All your mixing and dissolvingof elements never has produced, and never can produce, any good result. Do youwish to know the reason? Your substance cannot stand the heat of the furnace fora single half-hour, but must evaporate in smoke, or be consumed by the fire. Butthe substance with which work, can stand any degree of heat, without beinginjured. My water is dry, and does not moisten what it touches; it does notevaporate, or become less, neither is its oil consumed. So perfect are myelements; but yours are worse than useless.In conclusion, let me tell you that your artificial fire will never impart my heavenlywarmth, nor will your water, oil, and earth supply you with any substitute for mysubstance. It is the gift of God, shed upon the elements from heaven, and uponone more than upon another; but how, is known only to me, and to the GreatArtist who entrusted me with this knowledge. One thing more let me tell you, myson. If you would imitate me, you must prepare all out of one simple,self-contained Matter, in one well-closed vessel, and in one alembic. Thesubstance contains all that is needed for its perfect development, and must beprepared with a warmth that is always kept at the same gentle temperature. Letme ask you to consider the birth and development of man, my noblest work. Youcannot make a human body out of any substance whatsoever. Of my method informing so subtle a body neither Aristotle nor Plato had the remotest knowledge. Iharden the bones and the teeth, I make the flesh soft, the muscles cold, the brainmoist, the heart, into which God has poured the life, warm, and fill all the veinswith red blood. And in the same way, I make of one quicksilver, and of one activemale sulphur, one maternal vessel, the womb of which is the alembic. It is truethat man aids me with his art, by shedding external heat into the matrix; morethan this, however, he cannot do. He, then, that knows the true Matter, andprepares it properly in a well-closed vessel, and puts the whole in an alembic, andkeeps up the fire at the proper degree of warmth, may safely leave the rest to me.Upon the fire all depends, and much, therefore, does it behove you to see thereto.Consider, therefore, the fire, which they call epesin, pepsin, pepausin, andoptesin, or natural, preternatural, and infranatural fire, which burns not. Withoutthe true Matter and the proper fire, no one can attain the end of his labour. I giveyou the substance; you must provide the mere outward conditions. Take, then, avessel, and an alembic of the right kind and of the right size. Be wise, and performthe experiment in accordance with my laws. Help me, and I will help you. I willdeal with you as you deal with me. To my other sons, who have treated me well,have obeyed their father and mother, and submitted themselves to my precepts, Ihave given a great reward, as John de Mehung, for instance, will tell you. Histestimony is also borne out by Villanova, Raymond, Morienus the Roman, HermesThe Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (5 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"(whom they call Father, and who has not his like among the Sages), Geber, andothers who have written about this Art, and know by experience that it is true.If you, my son, wish to prepare this precious Stone, you need not put yourself toany great expense. All that you want is leisure, and some place where you can bewithout any fear of interruption. Reduce the Matter (which is one) to powder, putit, together with its water, in a well-closed vessel, and expose it to continuous,gentle heat, which will then begin to operate, while the moisture favours thedecomposition. The presence of the moisture prevents the dryness of thequicksilver from retarding its assimilation. Meanwhile, you must diligently observewhat I do, and remember the words of Aristotle (Meteor iii. and iv.), who says:''Study Nature, and carefully peruse the book concerning Generation andCorruption.\" You must also read the book concerning heaven and the world, inwhich you will find indicated the beautiful and pure substance. If you neglect thisstudy, you will fail. On this subject consult Albertus Magnus, De Mineralibus. But ifyour eyes are opened by such studies, you will discover the secret of the growth ofminerals, viz., that they are all produced from the elements.First learn to know me, before you call yourself Master. Follow me, that am themother of all things created, which have one essence, and which can neither grow,nor receive a living soul, without the heavenly and elementary influences. Whenyou have learned by persevering study to understand the virtues of the heavenlybodies, their potent operations, and the passive condition of the elements, and itsreason — if you further know the media of transmutation, the cause of generation,nutrition, and decay, and the essence and substance of the elements — you arealready acquainted with the Art, notwithstanding that a most subtle mind is stillneeded for the studying of my operations. But if you do not possess part at least ofthis knowledge, you will be fortunate indeed if you succeed in discovering mysecret. It is a secret that is read not by those that are wise in their own conceits,but by those that humbly and patiently listen to my teaching Therefore, if youdesire to own this treasure, which has been the reward of the truly wise in allages, you must do as I bid you. For my treasure has such virtue and potency thatthe like of it is to be found neither in heaven nor upon earth. It holds anintermediate position between Mercury and the Metal which I take for the purposeof extracting from it by your art and my knowledge that most precious essence. Itis pure and potable gold, and its radical principle is active humidity. Moreover, itis the universal Medicine described by Solomon (Eccles. xxxviii.); the same also istaken from the earth, and honoured by the wise. God has assigned it a placeamong my mysteries, and reveals it to the Sages, although many who callthemselves learned doctors of Theology and Philosophy, hold it in ignorantcontempt — as Alchemy is also despised by the doctors of Medicine, because theydo not know me, and are ignorant of that which they profess to teach. They mustbe insufficiently furnished with brains, or they would not direct their foolish scornagainst the panacea which renders all other medicines unnecessary. Happy is theman, even though he be sinking under the weight of years, whose days Godprolongs until he has come to the knowledge of this secret! For (as Geber says)many to whom this gift was imparted late in life, have, nevertheless, beenrefreshed and delighted by it in extreme old age.He that has this secret possesses all good things and great riches. One ounce of itwill ensure to him both wealth and health. It is the only source of strength andrecreation, and far excels the golden tincture. It is the elixir and water of life,which includes all other things. In my treasure are concealed quicksilver, sulphur,incombustible oil, white, indestructible, and fusible salt.

Do notperplex yourself with metals, or other things of a like nature: rather change theelements into a mutable form. For this is the most excellent substance of theSages, and is rejected only by the foolish. Its substance is like, but its essenceunlike, that of gold.

I acknowledge and confess thatthou art the Mother and Empress of the great world, made for the little world ofman's mind. Thou movest the bodies above, and transmutest the elements below.At the bidding of thy Lord thou dost accomplish both small things and great, andrenewest, by ceaseless decay and generation, the face of the earth and of theheavens. I confess that nothing can live without a soul, and that all that exists andis endued with being flows forth from thee by virtue of the power that God hasgiven to thee. All matter is ruled by thee, and the elements are under thygovernance. From them thou takest the first substance, and from the heavens thoudost obtain the form. That substance is formless and void until it is modified andindividualized by thee. First thou givest it a substantial, and then an individualform. In thy great wisdom thou dost cunningly mould all thy works through theheavenly influences, so that no mortal hand can utterly destroy them. Under thyhands God has put all things that are necessary to man, and through thee, He hasdivided them into four kingdoms, namely, those that have being and essence, likethe metals and stones; those that have essence and growth, like the vegetables;those that have feeling and sensation, like the beasts, birds, and fishes. These arethe first three classes; in the fourth it pleased God to place only the noblest andmost perfect of His works, namely, man, to whom He also gave a rational andimmortal soul. This soul is obscured by the defilement which found its way into thebody through the senses, and, but for the grace and mercy of God, would havebecome involved in its condemnation. Hence the chief perfection of man is notderived from thee, nor dost thou impart to us our humanity. Nevertheless, thematerial part of man is the work of thy hands alone.And, surely, our bodies are cunningly and wonderfully made, and, in every part ofthem, bear witness to the masterly skill of the workman. How marvellous are theuses of our various members! How wonderful that the soul can move them and setthem to work at will! But, alas! oftener still the body is master of the soul, andforces it to do many things which pure reason condemns.

Wert thou wanting in wisdom, orknowledge; or couldst thou not do otherwise? Pardon me if I speak toopresumptuously about thy wisdom, I only desire to be rightly and truly informed.For, indeed, even now thy stern rebuke has made many things clear to me. I havespent my whole life in attending to thy lessons; and the more closely I havelistened, the more clearly have I understood my mistakes and the depth of thywisdom. Now, whether I lie, or stand, or walk, I can think of nothing but thy greatmystery. And yet I am unable to conceive what substance and form I must take forit. Thou didst sternly rebuke me for not following thy way; but thou knowest that,if I do not obey thee, it is only because I do not know what thou wouldst have medo. I shall never be able to attain any satisfactory result in this Art, unless thouwilt enlighten my blindness. Thou hast rightly said that it is not for man to knowthe mystery of thy working: how then can I be guided to this knowledge, unlessthou wilt take me by the hand? Thou sayest that I must follow thee; and I amwilling to do so. But tell me what I must do, and what books I must study for thatpurpose. Of the books which I have read, one says, ''Do this,\" and the other, \"No,do that\"; and they are full of unintelligible expressions and of dark parables. Atlast I see that I cannot learn anything from them. Therefore I take refuge withthee, and instantly beseech thee to advise and to tell me how to set about thisdifficult task. On my knees I implore thee to show me the way by which I canpenetrate into the lower parts of the earth, and by what subtle process I am toobtain the perfect mercury of the metals. And yet I doubt whether any man, evenafter obtaining this mercury, can really make gold. That is thy work, and not thework of man; as thy words and my own experience most clearly shew.We see that the cold and moist mercury needs the assistance of its sulphur, whichis its seed after its kind, or its homogeneous sperm, out of which the metal orStone must be produced. But thou sayest only: Take the proper substance, theproper vessel, the proper mineral, the proper place, and the proper fire; thenform, colour, and life will grow and spring forth from thence. Thou art theArchitect; thou knowest the glorious properties of the Matter. The active principlecan do nothing unless there be a passive principle prepared to receive itsinfluence. Thou knowest how to mix the warm and the cold, the dry and the moist;by reconciling hostile elements, thou canst produce new substances and forms. ForI did indeed understand all that thou didst tell me, but am unable to express it sowell as thou. This thou hast firmly impressed on my mind, that the Elixir iscomposed by the reconciling and mutual transmutation of the four elements. Butwhat man is sufficient for such a task? For who knows how earth can have itsessence in common with air, or how it can be changed into moisture which iscontrary to its nature? For humidity will not leave a cold and humid element, noteven under the influence of fire. This, too, is the work of Nature, that it becomesblack, and white, and red. These three visible colours correspond to the threeelements, earth, water, and fire, and are pervaded by the air.Then, again, thou sayest that the Stone is prepared of one thing, of one substance,in one vessel, the four (elements) composing one essence in which is one agentwhich begins and completes the work; man, thou sayest, need do nothing but adda little heat, and leave the rest to thy wisdom. For all that is needed is alreadycontained in the substance, in perfection, beginning, middle, and end, as thewhole man, the whole animal, the whole flower is contained each in its properseed. Now, in the human seed the human specific-substance is also included, asflesh, blood, hair, &c.; and thus every seed contains all the peculiar properties ofits species. In the whole world men spring from human seed, plants from plants,animals from animals. Now I know that when once the seed is enclosed in theThe Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (8 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"female vessel, no further trouble or work of any kind is required — everything isbrought to perfection by thy gradual and silent working. And the generation of theStone, thou sayest, is performed in a similar manner. Only one substance isrequired, which contains within itself air, water, and fire — in short, everythingthat is needed for the completion of this work. No further handling of any kind isnecessary, and a gentle fire is sufficient to rouse the internal warmth, just as aninfant in the womb is cherished by natural heat. The only thing in which man mustaid thee, is, by preparing the substance, removing all that is superfluous, enclosingthis simple earth, which is combined with its water, in a vessel, and subjecting itto the action of gentle heat in a suitable alembic. This, thou sayest, is all thatneeds to be done by man; when all has been prepared for thee, thou dost beginthy part of the work. Thou dissolvest the substance, and makest the dry watery;then thou sublimest it, and bearest it upward into the air, and thus, without anyfurther aid, bringest that to perfection which can itself impart perfection to allimperfect things. Therefore, thou, Nature, art the first mother, since thou dostcunningly combine the four elements into an essence by a process of which nonebut thou has any knowledge. Thus far have I understood thee, and do not quitedespair, if it be pleasing unto God and to thee, of seeing thy great reward with myown eyes.But at present I earnestly desire to know but one thing: and that is, how can thatsubstance be obtained, what are its qualities, and what its powers to impartperfection to imperfect thingsI am well aware that gold is the most precious of the metals; but I cannot see thatit has any capacity of becoming more potent than it already is. For whatever manmay do with it, it will never be able to perfect anything but itself. If any one toldme to dissolve it and extract from it its quicksilver, I should regard that as a veryfoolish direction; for nothing can be got out of gold but what is in it. Thesephilosophasters betray their ignorance by saying that they can reduce gold to itsfirst substance; but thy instruction has made it clear to me that the first substancecannot be obtained, except by destroying the specific properties of a thing, norcan any new species be brought forth by such a destruction, unless the species befirst universalized into the genus. Moreover, I make bold to affirm that no man canfirst resolve gold into its generic substance, and then restore it again; for when ithas once lost its specific properties, no mere human skill can change it back intowhat it was before. Nor can any one really reduce gold to the first form impartedto it by the elements. For gold is not transmuted either by heat or by cold, and isso perfect in its kind that fire only renders it purer. It does not admit of anyfurther development, and therefore no other metal or quicksilver can be obtainedfrom it.It is true that plants and animals are constantly producing their like by means oftheir seed, and their capacity of organic nutrition. But I do not see how the samecan be said of metals, seeing that at the expiration of any given period they stillretain the same size and weight which they had at the beginning. Through theethey receive their being out of the elements without any sowing, planting, ordevelopment of any kind. Moreover, I know that no credit is to be attached to thefanciful notions of the old Sages who would prepare our Stone out of a crudemetallic substance, and do not understand that the form and substance of a thingare conditioned by its essential nature. Now, I remember a certain jugglingcharlatan, who was looked upon as a great philosopher, telling me that the onlytrue material was common quicksilver, which must be well mingled with gold,since in such an union the one brought the other to perfection. If I did this,The Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (9 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"continued that impostor, I should be able to prepare the Elixir. First, however, thefour elements must be separated from each other, then, after each had beenpurified, they must be reunited, the great being combined with the small, and thesubtile with the gross. This, he said, was the right way of making the Stone. But Iknow that all this is sheer nonsense, and that such men are only deceivingthemselves and others.I am also aware that only God can produce anything out of the elements. He aloneknows how to mingle and combine them in their due proportions. For He alone isthe Creator and Author of all good things, and there is nothing in the world that Hehas not made. Therefore, let the charlatans cease their vain-glorious talk, andremember that they can never hope to gather where they cannot sow; let themmake an end of their false calcinations, sublimations, distillations, by which theyextract the spirit in a vaporous form, and of their juggling coagulations andcongelations, by which they pretend, even among the initiated, to be able rightlyto separate the elements of gold and quicksilver. It is certainly true that all thingsunder heaven are composed of the four elements, and mixed of them according tothe due proportion of their genus and species; but it is not simply the union of thefour elements, but their being combined in a certain way, which constitutes thesubstance of the Philosophical Stone.I also understand that in the red quicksilver and perfect body, which is called theSun, the four elements are combined in a peculiar way, and so inseparablyconjoined, that no mere human art can divide them. For all ancient and true Sagessay that fire and air are enclosed in earth and water, and contend so violently witheach other that none but God and Nature can loosen their grappling embrace. ThisI can truly affirm and also prove. For we can neither see the fire nor grasp the air;and if any one says that the several elements can be seen he is an impostor, seeingthat they are inseparably and inextricably conjoined. For, although the Sophistspretend, and confidently affirm, that they can divide gold and quicksilver into thefour elements, yet for all that they speak not the truth. If two elements, fire andair, were thus taken away, all the rest must vanish into nothing. They may say thatthose two are retained, but they are, nevertheless, densely ignorant as to whatbecomes of them; for air and fire cannot be seen or perceived. Again, that extractwhich they call fire and air renders humid, which is not the property either of fireor of air.Moreover, as thou hast said, even the most learned Doctor cannot know theproportion of each element in any given substance. For God has entrusted thisknowledge to thee alone. Nor is any Sage wise enough to be able to mingle and puttogether the elements so as to produce any natural object. If then he dissolvesanything into its elements, how, I pray thee, is he to put them together again intoany abiding form, since he is ignorant of their proportionate quantity and quality,and of the method of their composition? Yet it is of no use to separate them, ifthey cannot be put together again. To thee, O Nature, we must entrust this task,since thou knowest the art of preparing the Philosopher's Stone, and of combiningthe elements without first separating them. Nevertheless, for the preparation ofthe true Elixir, thou needest the aid of a wise and truly learned man. Aristotlesays: \"Where the physicist ends, there the physician begins.\" Nor can we attain totrue alchemy, until we begin to follow Nature, and to be guided by a knowledge ofher principles. Where the study of Alchemy is rightly carried on, it is mightilyadvanced by Nature. But, for all that, we must not suppose that every naturalsubstance must be useful to the alchemist. We must remember that Alchemy has athreefold aim: First, to quicken and perfect the metal, and so to digest its spiritThe Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (10 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"that none of it is lost; secondly, so to digest and heat the substance in a smallphial that (without the addition of anything else) the body and spirit are changedinto one. The mingling of the elements is performed, not by the artist, but bythee. Thirdly, it (alchemy) proves that the process of preparing the Stone does notinclude any separation of the four elements (of the quicksilver and the Sun, whichis called red and glorious gold). To believe that such a separation must take placeis a great mistake, and contradicts the fundamental principles of philosophy.Again, it is an undoubted fact, that every elementary substance is fed by theelements themselves. If, then, that which now forms one object is dissolved, theobject as such is destroyed, the bond which held the elements together beingviolently broken, and each returning to that from which it was first taken. A fatherthat begets a son must not be destroyed for that purpose; it suffices that thegenerating spirit shall go forth with the seed, and be conceived by the femaleseed, and cherished with its warmth. Such a generating spirit has power to begetan infant of the same species, as Avicenna says. Now, it is the same with puregold, which is the true master of the Philosophical Stone. For the father is theactive principle, and must not be destroyed, or resolved into its elements, but it issufficient for the paternal Sun (gold) to breathe its virtue and strength through themother into the son. When the mother (who is of the earth) brings forth, the son isseen to have the father's substance.Thus, I have learnt from thee, O Nature, that Alchemy is a true science, and thatthe deep red gold, which is called Sun, is the true father of the Stone or Elixir,from which this great and precious treasure proceeds; which heats, digests, andcunningly tinges (without the least diminution or corruption) the other principle ofthat gold, and thus brings forth so glorious a son. It is worse than useless,therefore, to meddle with the composition, or to separate the elements, whichNature has so skillfully combined in the quicksilver, and in the perfect body of thegold. All we have to do is to imitate Nature, and use the instruments with whichshe combines the elements, and which she uses in moulding minerals, and in givingits form to the quicksilver. If we act otherwise, we destroy thy works, and severthe golden chain which thou hast forged. Nevertheless, we must, as Aristotle says,transmute the elements that we may obtain the object of our search.Thus thou hast wisely led me into thy way, and hast shewn me the utter folly ofmy own doings. Unto thee I render the most heartfelt thanks for that thou hastdelivered me from my own ignorance, and from the disgrace and ruin to which allmy endless alembics quicksilvers, aquae fortes, dissolutions, excrements of horses,and coal fires, must at length have brought me.In future, I will read thy book more diligently, and obey thee more implicitly. Forthis is the surest and safest way that a man can go, because the Art is entirely inthy hands, although, by reason of its gigantic aim, its progress must necessarily beslow. Therefore, I will lose no more time, and first begin to think about thesubstance, the active principle of which shall yield me most potent quicksilver.That I will enclose in a clean, air-tight phial, and under it I will place an alembic;thereupon thou wilt wait upon thine office. From the bottom of my heart I oncemore render unto thee the debt of unspeakable gratitude, for that thou hastdeigned to visit me, and to bestow upon me so precious an inheritance. In token ofmy gratitude I will now do thy bidding, and let it be my ceaseless aim to attain tothis most glorious Tincture of the Elements, feeling assured that with the help ofthe thrice great and good God, I shall succeed.The Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (11 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Next: The Only True WayThe Remonstration of Naturehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/de_meung.htm (12 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:00]"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Only True WayThe Only True Way;Or,An Useful, Good, And Helpful Tract,Pointing Out The Path Of Truth.1677.The Only True WayBeloved friend and brother, under the name of this glorious Art there is to befound much false teaching which is put forward by pseudo-alchemists, whosewritings are nothing but imposture and deceit, and are yet highly esteemed bypeople of the simpler sort. These charlatans induce their dupes to waste muchmoney and time on that which can profit them nothing; for unless a thing be wellbegun, it can never be brought to a good end. Yet most men, who, nowadays, havedevoted themselves to this exalted art of chemistry, are pursuing a wrong course,and are deceivers or deceived. The deceivers are conscious of their own ignorance,and try to veil it under an obscure and allegorical style. The less they really know,the more pompous and the more unintelligible do their speculations become. Butthe reader, who is puzzled by their perplexing style, may at least comfort himselfwith the assurance that he knows as much about the matter as the authors. Thatassurance must serve for a kind of clue to the endless labyrinth of their falsesublimations, calcinations, distillations, solutions, coagulations, putrefactions, andcorruptions. Nevertheless, we may almost every (lay see foolish persons spendtheir whole substance on those absurd experiments, being induced to do so by theaforesaid pseudo-alchemists, who impose on them with a false process, andfanciful perversions of Nature.With these useless and unnecessary experiments the true Alchemists will havenothing to do. They follow the method pursued by Nature in the veins of the earth,which is very simple, and includes no solutions, putrefactions, coagulations, oranything of the kind Can Nature, in the heart of the earth, where the metals dogrow and receive increase, have anything corresponding to all thosepseudo-alchemistical instruments alembics, retorts, circulatory and sublimatoryphials, fires, and other materials, such as cobbler's wax, salt, arsenic mercury,sulphur, and so forth? Can all these things really be necessary for the growth andincrease of the metals? It is surprising that any one not entirely bereft of his sensescan spend many years in the study of alchemy, and yet never get beyond thosefoolish and frivolous solutions, coagulations, putrefactions, distillations, whileNature is so simple and unsophisticated in her methods. Surely every true Artistmust look upon this elaborate tissue of baseless operations as the merest folly, andThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (1 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"can only wonder that the eyes of those silly dupes are not at last opened, thatthey may see something besides such absurd sophisms, and read something besidesthose stupid and deceitful books. It seems that they are so entangled in theirsophisms that they can never attain to the freedom of true philosophy.But let me tell you that so long as you love lies, and turn away from rationalphilosophy, you will never find the right way. I can speak from bitter experience.For I, too, toiled for many years in accordance with those sophistic methods, andendeavoured to reach the coveted goal by sublimation, distillation, calcination,circulation, and so forth, and to fashion the Stone out of substances such as urine,salt, atrament, alum, etc. I have tried hard to evolve it out of hairs, wine, eggs,bones, and all manner of herbs; out of arsenic, mercury, and sulphur, and all theminerals and metals. I have striven to elicit it by means of aqua fortis and alkali. Ihave spent nights and days in dissolving, coagulating, amalgamating, andprecipitating. Yet from all these things I derived neither profit nor joy. I had hopedmuch from the quintessence, but it disappointed me like the rest.Therefore, beloved brother, let me warn you to have nothing to do withsublimations of sulphur and mercury, or the solution of bodies, or the coagulationof spirits, or with all the innumerable alembics, which bear little profit untoveritable art. So long as you do not seek the true essence of Nature, your labourswill be doomed to failure- therefore, if you desire success, you must once for allrenounce your allegiance to all those old methods, and enlist under the standardsof that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of Nature - inshort, the method which Nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth. For yousee that Nature uses only one substance in her work of developing and perfectingthe metals, and that this substance includes everything that is required. Now, thissubstance appears to call for no special treatment, except that of digestion bygentle heat, which must be continued until it has reached its highest possibledegree of development. For this simple heating process the cunning sophists havesubstituted solutions, coagulations, calcinations, putrefactions, sublimations, andother fantastical operations - which are only different names for the same thing;and thereby they have multiplied a thousand-fold the difficulties of thisundertaking, and given rise to the popular notion that it is a most arduous,hazardous, and ruinously expensive enterprise. This they have simply done out ofjealousy and malice, to put others off the right track, and to involve them inpoverty and ruin. But they will find it difficult to justify their conduct before God,who has commanded us to love our neighbours as ourselves. For out of sheermalice they have rendered the road of truth impassable, and perplexed a simplenatural process with such an elaborate tissue of circumstantial nomenclature, as tomake the amelioration of the metals appear a hopelessly difficult task. For whileyou heat, you also putrefy, or decompose, as you may see by the changes which agrain of wheat undergoes in the. ground under the influence of the rain and of thesun; you know that it must first decay before new life can spring forth. It is thisprocess which they have denominated putrefaction and solution. Again when youheat, you also sublime, and to this coction they have applied the termssublimation and multiplication, that the simple man might err more easily. In likemanner coagulation takes place in heating; for they say that coagulation takesplace when humidity is changed into the nature of fire, so as to be able to resistthe action of fire, without evaporating, or being consumed. And heating alsoincludes that which they call \"circulation,\" or conjunction, or the union of fire withwater to prevent complete combustion. Thus you see that that which they havecalled by so many names is really but one simple process. The substance, which isone, they have described under a similar variety of appellations, to prevent menThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (2 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"from finding that which, by the grace of God, can provide for them so manyprecious blessings. In the first place they call it \"our mercury,\" by which they meannothing but moisture, which begins to unite itself with the fire, and therefore maybe compared to mercury. Again, they use the expression, \"our sulphur,\" wherebythey mean nothing but the fire itself, which lies hid beneath the water, orhumidity, and is heated by the water to its highest degree. Then, again, they callit Hyle, or the First Substance, because all things are first generated out of waterand fire. Other names, such as Arsenic, Orpiment, Bismuth, are not used by theSages at all, but only by certain ignorant charlatans, of whom we need not takeany further notice. Let us follow the guidance of Nature: she will not lead usastray.If you let this be your motto, you will surely be able to call to mind the firstsubstance, out of which all metallic substances are generated. But before weconsider this question, it will much behove you to understand why the Sun, Moon,Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, are metals, and what is their origin. Besidesfinding an answer to this question, you must also bear in mind that all createdthings are divided into three kingdoms, viz., the animal, the vegetable, and themineral. To the first belong all living things that have flesh and blood; to thesecond all herbs, plants, and trees; to the third all metals, stones, and everythingthat cannot be burned.But, though divided into three classes, yet all things, O my brother, may be tracedback to one common Principle, from which they derive their generation, or birth.By different varieties of heat this first substance is transmuted in various ways,and assumes different specific forms. Since, then, Nature is so simple, I advise youonce more to have done with all those foolish sublimations, coagulations, andputrefactions, and the ridiculous old wives' fables which are even now believed bymany, and simply to follow Nature, and her unsophisticated methods: then she willtake you by the hand, and guide you to the true substance. For the only method ofcorrecting or ameliorating Nature, consists in the natural heating of essences.Now, this Essence, my friend, is the principal thing, on which depends the wholematter. This simple truth, the vulgar herd of alchemists seem quite unable tounderstand, and thus go on toiling day by day with substances which have nothingto do with the matter. They might as well sow horn, or wood, or stones, andexpect a golden harvest of corn. The sun and moon cannot be made out of allsubstances, but only out of the natural Essence out of which all things are formed,being afterwards differentiated into divers substances by different varieties ofheat. Thus the special quality of every individual thing is to be referred to thedegree of its coction. If, therefore, we wish to exercise the true Art of Alchemy,we must imitate the method by which Nature does her work in the bowels of theearth.The ancients have named many colours in connexion with this process, such asblack, white, citrine, red, green, and so forth. All this is simply intended to leadyou astray from the right road, and to keep you in ignorance. Those ancientwriters were constantly at the greatest pains to obscure their style with such aperplexing variety of allegorical expressions as to render it impossible for theordinary reader to understand their meaning.Therefore, I would again and again exhort you not to believe them when they tellyou that you must have or take a black substance, or that the substance turnsblack, white, and red in the course of the chemical process. The black colour wassuggested to them by the fact that the substance or essence at first mingles with aThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (3 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"brilliant material fire, by which a liquid is separated from the essence in the formof a certain black fume. This black fume the ancients called the Black Raven, andthe essence they denominated the Raven's Head. This separation you shouldcarefully observe. From it the ancients learned that the separation of naturalsubstances is nothing but a natural defect of the heating process. This, again,suggested to them the consideration that those essences that had been imperfectlyheated by Nature, might be aided in a natural manner by ordinary fire, and thatthus the essences which are still combustible, and their liquids (which the ancientsinvidiously called mercury) being black when they are separated from the essence,might be perfected by art, and the essences guarded against combustion by theirliquid, and the liquid rendered incapable of being separated from the essence.This the ancients called \"our sulphur.\" For after this preparation the essence is nolonger vegetable or animal, but by the perfection of its heating it has become amineral essence, and is therefore called sulphur; the essence is nothing but anelementary fire, and its liquid, which is guarded against combustion, is trueelementary air, and, because air is naturally warm and moist, it is called mercuryby those jealous ancients. Air contains in itself the nature of fire, and elementaryfire, again, contains within itself the nature of air: thus, by the union of theircommon elements, a true amalgamation of the two can take place. Such are thematerial fire and water which we see. These material elements are nothing but anaid to the essences of the elements by which they can be naturally reduced to thehighest degree (of perfection?). This gradation is the only true Alchemy, and thereis none beside. The pseudo-alchemy of our modern charlatans is mere waste ofmoney and time.It would be a great mistake for you to suppose that you can derive any realknowledge from the writings of the Sages. They show you only the outside, andconceal the internal Essence. To you they offer the husks, but the finest of thewheat they keep for themselves. They show you a way which they do not dream oftreading. I advise you, therefore, in future, to give them a wide berth; or you willonly enrich the apothecaries while you plunge yourself and your family into thedeepest poverty; nay, instead of gaining the universal panacea, you will contractthe most dangerous diseases from constantly moving in an atmosphere black withsulphurous and mercurial smoke, and fetid with the stench of bismuth and allmanner of salts.It is truly amazing that none of the seekers after this great treasure, though willingto submit to any amount of labour and hardship for its sake, seem capable ofperceiving the lesson which constant failure is striving to impress upon them.What, I pray you, have those thousands of persons, who have tried the solutions,coagulations, putrefactions, amalgamations, and circulations, gained by theiragonising toil? What good result have they produced with their waters, solutions ofmetals, blood, hair, eggs, milk, sugar, and all manner of herbs? Let me beseechyou to profit by their heart-breaking experience, and to have done with everythingbut true Alchemy, which teaches that the substance is brought to perfection, andattains the exaltation of elementary fire, by its own light and liquid- by which alsoimperfect metals are ameliorated, because their elementary fire was not properlydigested by its liquid. And for the same reason the elementary fire cannot remain,for the liquid is separated from that elementary fire by the heat of the ordinaryfire, and evaporates in the form of white smoke. The elementary fire, on the otherhand, does not evaporate, but abides with its earth, and must be burned with it,because its protecting liquid has vanished in white smoke. This is that whiteness ofwhich the Ancients have said that it comes after the black colour. For this reason,they are in the habit of saying that you must make it black before you make itThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (4 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"white. We begin our process with blackness, and transmute the black smoke, butdo not take it for our substance, and make it white. The latter would be a foolishsupposition and imposture. If you would avoid such misapprehensions, you mustnot attempt the study of this subject until you have a sound knowledge of theoperations of Nature, and more especially of the essential properties of themetals.I am afraid, my Brother, that my book will cause you heaviness of heart, instead ofjoy, because I sweep away at one fell stroke all those false sophistical notionswhich had become so dear to you. Nevertheless, you must once for all relinquishthat idea of yours that you are profoundly versed in the mysteries of this Art, andleave these childish absurdities to those who derive wealth and profit from them.Among these persons, Adam de Bodenstein held a very distinguished place; for hewrote all manner of so-called theosophical books, and boasted of his attainmentsin the alchemistic Art, of which he was really quite ignorant. Yet to the presentday many people believe that he (whose expressions are those of a merecharlatan) had a real knowledge of true alchemy. It is true that his nonsensecannot for a moment impose on the initiated; but among the blind (as the proverbsays) it is easy to win golden opinions as a good fencer. On this account, and asBodenstein is no more among the living, I will dismiss the subject, for nothing butwhat is favourable should be spoken of the dead and of the absent. This I will say,however, that he was a good Sophist and a good physician; but of Alchemy heknew little or nothing. I should not have said this much if I were not really anxiousto warn the unwary against being dazzled by the splendour of his name, and toprevent them from being lured on by it to their own ruin.If, then, you are a lover of the truth, you will bid farewell to these speciousabsurdities, and henceforth entrust yourself to the guidance of Nature alone; besure that she will lead you onward without faltering to the desired goal, even thatmethod by which she works towards the essence. Moreover, she will demand ofyou neither much labour nor any considerable outlay The whole thing is done by asimple process of heating, which includes the solution and coagulation of thebodies, and also the sublimation and putrefaction. But some writers havesubstituted for the simple and true essence a certain other essence, with whichthey have deceived the whole world, and involved many persons in considerablelosses. Whether their conduct was upright and loving will one day be decided bythe Great Judge. It would be better not to publish such writings, since the falsestatements and groundless assertions with which they swarm, plunge so manycredulous persons into grievous losses. For if there were not so many books putforward by ignorant writers, many thousands of persons who at the presentmoment are hopelessly floundering about in a sea of specious book-learning wouldhave been led by the light of their own unaided intellects to the knowledge of thisprecious secret; they are prevented, these many years, from seeing the plain truthby a vast mass of printed nonsense which commands their reverence, because theydo not understand it. The Ancients did indeed know something about the Art; butat the present day we can very well dispense with the cumbrous phraseology underwhich they (most successfully) attempted to veil their meaning. It can only tend tothe bewilderment of honest enquirers, who are thereby thrown off the true scent,unless indeed they should come to be instructed by living Masters.I myself may not speak out as plainly as I would, for I am silenced by the vowwhich binds all the masters of the Art, the curse that lights on those who violatethe sacred seal of Nature's secrets, and the malediction of all the philosophers.Therefore, I must exhort you again and again to trust your own observations ratherThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (5 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"than the writings of others, and to let the Book of Nature be the most favouredvolume of your library.

If you had a sound knowledge of Nature's methods in producing the budand the flower, and in ripening the green fruit, you would be able to set your handto the germs which Nature provides in the bowels of the earth, and to educe fromthem (or their substance) that which you so much desire. Forgive me then, myBrother, for so unceremoniously overthrowing all your old settled and dearlycherished convictions. My excuse must be that I have done it for your own good, asyou would otherwise never learn the true secret of transmuting metals. You maybelieve and trust me, for I can have no conceivable motive for filling the worldwith fresh lies of which, God knows, it is already full enough, through the agencyof the aforesaid deceivers and their willing dupes, who after being lured on bythose false books to the loss of all their worldly goods, have not suffered their eyesto be opened by their losses, and seem unable to find their way out of thatgigantic labyrinth of falsehood. Nay, they have even taken upon themselves towrite books, and to speak as if they were perfect masters of the Art, and hadderived great advantage from it, though in reality they have been brought so lowas to be able to afford nothing but miserable decoctions. They dissolved until theirwhole fortune had undergone a process of dissolution; they sublimed until all theirgold and silver had evaporated; they putrefied until their clothes decayed upontheir bodies; and they calcined until all their wood and coal were consumed toashes, and they themselves were reduced to wallet and staff.This is the prize which they have won with all their trouble. Let their ruin be awarning to you, my Brother. For their alchemy instead of imparting health, isfollowed by penury and disease; instead of transmuting copper into gold, itchanges gold into copper and brass. Consider also how many ignorant persons, suchas cobblers, tailors, bankrupt merchants, and tavern keepers, pretend to aknowledge of this Art, and, after a few years' unsuccessful experimenting in thelaboratory, call themselves great doctors, announce in boastful and sesquipedalianlanguage their power to cure many diseases, and promise mountains of gold. Thosepromises are empty wind, and their medicines rank poison, with which they fill thechurchyards, and for the impudent abuse of which God will one day visit them withheavy punishment. But I will leave the magistrates and the jailers to deal withthese swindling charlatans. I speak of them only to put you on your guard. If somany persons write on the subject of Alchemy, who know nothing whatever aboutthe nature and generation of metals, it becomes all the more necessary for you tobe careful what books you read, and how much you believe.For I tell you truly that so long as you have no real and fundamental knowledge ofthe nature of the metals, you cannot make much progress in the true Art ofAlchemy, or understand the natural transmutation of metals. You must grasp themeaning of every direction before you can put it into effect. Always mistrust thatwhich you do not understand (i.e., in studying this art). There are many falseways, but there can be only one that is true, and indicates a process which doesnot require many hands, or much labour. For this reason, beloved friend andBrother, you must work hard by day and by night to obtain a thorough knowledgeof the metals, and of their essential nature. Then you will be able to understandthe requirements of the art. You will know without being told what is the truesubstance and the true method. You will see the utter uselessness of your formerlabour, and you will be amazed at your former blindness. Study the nature ofmetals and the causes of their generation, for they derive their birth from theThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (6 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"same source as all other created things.For as by a heating process the infant is developed in the mother's womb out ofthe father's seed, and as the chicken is brought forth out of the egg by the naturalincubation of the hen, so the metals, too, are developed in a certain way out of acertain substance. Yet I do not say, my Brother, that mercury and sulphur are thefirst substance of metals. Those juggling deceivers have told you so; but in theveins of the earth, where the metals grow, are found neither mercury nor sulphur.Therefore, when they speak of sulphur, you must understand them to allude toelementary fire, and by mercury you must understand the liquid. In a similar lyingspirit they have called fire (elementary) \"our Sun,\" and the liquid \"our Moon,\" orthe elementary fire soul, and the elementary liquid spirit, because elementarysubstances are invisible. The soul is invisible fire, and the spirit invisible moisture:the outward essential fire and water they have called ' bodies,' because they arevisible and palpable. Nay, they try to make you believe that these are metallicbodies, and that you must dissolve them. But do not let them deceive you. Be onyour guard against their dishonest tricks, and cunning devices, by which they setyou to experiment with metallic bodies, when they really mean the metallicessence.They point out to you various materials and substances, notwithstanding that thereis only one true substance, and one true method. Be sure that their solutions,coagulations, sublimations, calcinations, and putrefactions, do not represent themethod of Nature in the heart of the earth, where the metals grow. For piousNature only heats the elementary fire which is thereby ameliorated and fixedthrough its liquid; which latter she also changes, by various degrees of heat, intoall the various objects which compose the three natural kingdoms-and althoughnow it is differentiated into bodies so different as vegetables, animals, andminerals, yet they have all originally sprung from one common substance, all haveone root, which the Ancients denominated the first Matter or Hyle. But it is reallynothing but hidden elementary fire, with its liquid, which the Ancients called theroot liquid, radical moisture, or humid radical, because it is the root of all createdthings.This liquid, with its fire, is differentiated into the various kinds of natural bodies,by the various degrees of heat, or 'coction,' which take place in them. One thing ismore perfectly heated in its elementary fire through its liquid, than another. Thevegetable nature is that in which the coction is least perfect. Therefore its essenceis easily burned, and its liquid easily separated from its elementary fire, bycommon fire.The coction of the animal is almost as imperfect as that of the vegetablesubstance: for its essence is easily burned. The coction of the mineral substancesis the most perfect of all, because in them the metallic liquid is more closelyunited (by coction) to its elementary fire. Hence metals are better able to resistcommon fire than the vegetable and animal substances. When a metal is placed inthe fire, it does not burn with a bright flame like wood; for the liquid of wood isnot so completely joined (by coction) to its essence, as the liquid of metals is to itsessence. The union of the liquid with the essence is not metallic, but vegetable,for which reason the latter is consumed with a black smoke, when, by a higherdegree of coction, the vegetable has been transmuted into a metallic essence, itno longer gives out a black smoke in common fire, but a white smoke, as you maysee when imperfect metals are melted in the fire. That is why the Ancients saidthat you must first make the substance black before you make it white, i.e., itThe Only True Wayhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/trueway.htm (7 of 9) [27/05/2004 23:02:01]"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"must first give out a black smoke before it gives out a white. Again they say: Youmust first make it white before you make it red. To make red is to make perfect,because gold and silver have been rendered perfect by coction, their essencebeing fully united to their liquid, and changed into pure fire.Do not then suffer yourself to be thrown off your guard by the obscure phraseologyof the Ancients. If you thoroughly study the simple fundamental nature of themetals, you will know what their enigmatic expressions mean, and will not, likesome moderns, conclude from their writings that you must take a certainsubstance and dissolve it until it turns black., then again purify and calcine it tillthe blackness disappears and it begins to turn white; and after that, once moreincrease the fire and calcine and toil until the substance turns red. Such aninterpretation of the language of the Ancients can only suggest itself to personsentirely ignorant of the nature of metallic substances; indeed, the Ancients wroteas they did solely in order to hide their real meaning from all but the closestudents of Nature. To this end they were in the constant habit of employing theterms \"mercury \" and \"sulphur.\" And although the metallic essence is the truesubstance which, by natural coction, must be raised from the lowest to the higheststage of development, and although the meaning of the Ancients is intelligibleenough to the initiated, yet the ignorant can gather from their language no morethan the fact that the substance must be taken from the metals. But where arethey to obtain it, and how are they to bring it to perfection?The metallic essence can not be separated from the imperfect metals withoutbeing injured; for if it be separated with fire the liquid must evaporate, and theessence (with its earth) be consumed. Nor will you be able to separate the essenceof the imperfect metals by means of aqua fortis, arsenic, aqua vita-, or alkali,without injuring the essence and its liquid by the foreign moisture: for the metallicnature can bear no foreign substance, and if any foreign moisture combines withthe metallic liquid, it loses its proper quality and is entirely corrupted. Themetallic essence of the perfect metals you cannot obtain in a separate form; fortheir liquid and elementary fire are welded together by so perfect a process ofcoction, and so closely united with their earth, that neither fire nor water canavail to separate them, seeing that the fire has no power over them, and noforeign moisture can combine with, or corrupt, the liquid of perfect metals. Allyour labour will be in vain: the coction has done its work so well that you willnever be able to undo it.Hence, the Ancients said that there was no sulphur in anything but in the metals,and hence also they called the metallic liquid quicksilver. But names do not alterfacts: the fact is that the elementary fire must be so united to its elementaryliquid by natural coction that they become indivisible. For the liquid protects thefire against combustion, so that both remain fixed and unchanged in common fire.This perfected substance the Ancients have well called Elixir, or fire which hasundergone a process of perfect coction: for that which before was crude and raw is\"cooked,\" or digested by the process of coction. That element which, by itsimperfection, causes base metals to be broken up and disintegrated by fire, hasbeen digested and perfected by natural heat.For this reason you must not grudge the labour which the proper performance ofthis heating process demands, seeing that it includes purification, sublimation,dissolution, and all the other chemical processes enumerated by the ancientalchemists. All these you may safely dismiss from your mind, as they can cause younothing but trouble, loss, and waste of time.

It is the gift of the Holy Spirit, the lovingbounty of the great God, which comes down from the Father of light. He whomasters this Art, must have asked and obtained wisdom of God, since he has notonly gold, silver, and all the riches of this world, but also perfect health, length ofdays, and, what is better still, the comfort toe be derived from a reassuring typeof the bitter passion and death of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, His descentinto hell, His glorious and most holy Resurrection on the third day, and His victoryand triumph over sin, death, Devil, and hell -- a victory that must carry joy andcomfort to all that have the breath of life.Let me now shew you how wonderfully the human and divine natures of JesusChrist were united and joined together in one Person. The soul and body of Christand His divine nature were so inseparably joined together that they cannot besevered throughout all eternity. Nevertheless Christ had to die, and His soul had tobe separated from His body, and once more joined to it on the third day, that Hisbody might be glorified, and rendered as subtle as His soul and spirit. For He hadreceived His body of the substance of the most Blessed Virgin Mary, and thereforeit had to be perfected by temporary separation from His soul and Spirit.Nevertheless, His divinity remained united in one essence with the body and soulof Christ -- it was with the body in the tomb, and with His soul in Paradise.The body of Christ had to be separated from its soul in order that it might receivethe same power and glory. But now, Christ having been dead, and His soul havingafterwards been reunited to His body, they are henceforth inseparably conjoinedinto one subtle essence. His divine omnipotence which He received from HisFather, which governs all things in heaven and earth, and is equally perfect fromall eternity, is now one Person with the Christ Jesus, who suffered, died, roseagain, and ascended into heaven, in endless power, glory, majesty, might, andhonour.Therefore, O sinful man, render thanks to Almighty God for the grace and fatherlyloving kindness shewn to you; and rest assured that you may obtain theglorification which was given to Christ.

Like Him, you too must be crucified to thisworld by many hardships, tribulations, and anxieties.

Bear in mind that allthings that come down from Him are good and perfect gifts. Take care, therefore,lest you foully abuse the gifts bestowed upon you freely, without any merit of yourown, to the destruction of your soul; rather let all your actions shew that you loveand fear God, and then every labour to which you set your hand will prosper, andfrom beginning to end you will pursue the work successfully and joyously.

For it is a true revelation of many secretsand mysteries. It shews you the vanity of your body and of your life in this world;but it also solaces you with the hope of eternal salvation. It suggests to you thereflection that if God has infused such wonderful virtues into mere inanimatenatural objects, surely we, who are so much better than they, must be reservedfor some high and glorious destiny. I beseech you, therefore, to acquit yourselfwisely in all that you do -- not to be in haste, -- but to reveal this mystery to nomortal man, unless he be a lover of this Art and of a godly, sincere, and mercifultemper. Such was the practice of the ancient Sages to whom this wisdom wasrevealed by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. You must also confess that this Art isreal, for the sake of those who will not believe that Jesus Christ proceeded fromHis Almighty Heavenly Father, and was also born of a pure virgin. Moreover, youmust ask God to enlighten you by the gift of His Holy Spirit, to sharpen yourunderstanding, to open your eyes, and to grant you a profound insight into thatunfathomable wisdom which lies hid in our Art, and which no Sage has ever beenable to express in his writings.

I have experienced this so much that I am loath to recommend any toundertake the work, since this Art is so well hidden that no mortal on earth candiscover it unless Sol and Luna meet. If you give diligent heed to my warning youmay attain to a knowledge thereof, but if you do not, you will never approach anynearer to it. Know also that there is only one thing in the whole world that entersinto the composition of the Stone, and that, therefore, all coagulation, andadmixture, of different ingredients, would shew you to be on a wrong scentaltogether. If you could perform all the different operations of our art, yet all yourdissolving, coagulating, decomposing, distilling, augmenting, albefying, &c., wouldbe useless, without a true knowledge of our Matter. For our Art is good andprecious, nor can any one become a partaker of it, unless it be revealed to him byGod, or unless he be taught by a skilled Master. It is a treasure such as the wholeworld cannot buy. Do not, therefore, my sons, spend your toil until you know whatthat is on which you are to operate. For even if you knew the right Matter, yourinformation would be useless to you without a knowledge of the method ofpreparing it. The Stone in its final and effective form is not to be found anywherein the whole world, either in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath; nor inany metal, nor in anything that grows, nor yet even in gold or silver. It must beprepared, i.e., developed, into its final form; yet for all that, it cannot, strictlyspeaking, be made better than God created it, nor can the Tincture be preparedout of it: the ' Tincture ' must be added to it, and therefore has nothing to do withour main object, since it is a different thing altogether. If it were in any metal, weshould surely have to look for it in the Sun or Moon; yet the Moon cannot containit, or it would long since have become the Sun. Neither is it in mercury, or in anysulphur, or salt, or in herbs, or anything of that nature, as you shall see hereafter.Now we will conclude our exhortation, and proceed to describe the Art itself.There follow some Methods of Recognising our Stone.I.Know that our Stone is one, and that it is justly called a Stone. For it is a Stone,and could bear no name so characteristic, as that of the Stone of the Sages. Yet itis not any one of our existing stones, but only derives its appellation from itssimilarity to them. For our Stone is so prepared as to be composed of the fourelements. On this account it has been called by different names, and assumesdifferent forms, although it is one thing, and its like is not found upon earth. It is aStony, and not a stone in the sense of having the nature of any one stone; it is fire,yet it has not the appearance, or properties, of fire; it is air, yet neither has it theappearance, or properties, of air; it is water, but has no resemblance, or affinity,to the nature of water. It is earth, though it has not the nature, or appearance, ofearth, seeing that it is a thing by itself.Another way of Knowing our Precious Stone.The Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (4 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:02]"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"II.An ancient philosopher says: Our Stone is called the sacred rock, and is divided, orsignified, in four ways. Firstly, into earth; secondly, into its accretion; thirdly, intofire; and fourthly, into the flame of fire. If any one knows the method of dissolvingit, of extracting its salt, and of perfectly coagulating it, he is initiated in themysteries of the Sages. Therefore if the salt turn white, and assume an oilyappearance, then it tinges. There are three stages in our Art. Firstly, thetransmutation of the whole thing into one salt; secondly, the rendering of threesubtle bodies intangible; thirdly, the repetition of the whole solution of the wholething. If you understand this, set your hand to the work. For the Matter is only onething, and would remain one thing, though a hundred thousand books had beenwritten about it, because this Art is so great a treasure that the whole world wouldnot be a sufficient compensation for it. It is described in obscure terms, yet openlynamed by all, and known to all. But if all knew its secret, no one would work, andit would lose its value. On this account it would be impious to describe it inuniversally intelligible language. He to whom God will reveal it, may understandthese dark expressions. But because most men do not understand them, they areinclined to regard our Art as impossible, and the Sages are branded as wicked menand swindlers. Learned doctors, who thus speak of us, have it before their eyesevery day, but they do not understand it, because they never attend to it Andthen, forsooth, they deny the possibility of finding the Stone; nor will any one everbe able to convince them of the reality of our Art, so long as they blindly followtheir own bent and inclination. In short, they are too wise to discern it, since ittranscends the range of the human intellect, and must be humbly received at thehand of God.Yet another Way of Knowing our Blessed Stone.The philosopher, Morienus, calls our Stone, water: and he had good reasons for thename. O water of bitter taste, that preservest the elements! O glorious nature,that overcomest Nature herself! O thou that resemblest Nature, which dissolvesther tractable nature, that exaltest Nature -- that art crowned with light, andpreservest in thyself the four elements, out of which the quintessence is made!Thou art for the simple, seeing that thou art most simple in thy operation. Havingconceived by a natural process, thou bringest forth vapour, and art a good mother.Thou needest no outward help; nature preserves nature, and is not separated fromnature by the operation of nature. The thing is easy to find, the knowledge is easy,altogether familiar, yet it is as a miracle to many. Thy solution is great glory, andall thy lovers are named above. Thou art a great arcanum and to the many thouappearest impossible!Explanation.Know, my son, that our Stone is such that it cannot adequately be described inwriting. For it is a stone, and becomes water through evaporation; yet it is nostone, and it by a chemical process it receives. a watery form it is at first like anyother liquid water, being a thin fluid; yet its nature is not like that of any otherwater upon earth. There is only one spring in all the world from which this watermay be obtained. That spring is in Judaea, and is called, the Spring of the Saviour,or of beatitude. By the grace of God its situation was revealed to the Sages. Itissues in a secret place, and its waters flow over all the world. It is familiar to all,yet none knows the principle, reason, or way to find the spring, or discover theway to Judaea. But whoever does not know the right spring will never attain to aThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (5 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:02]"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"knowledge of our Art. For this reason, that Sage might well exclaim, \"O water of aharsh and bitter taste!\" For, in truth, the spring is difficult to find; but he whoknows it may reach it easily, without any expense, labour, or trouble. The wateris, of its own nature, harsh and bitter, so that no one can partake of it; and,because it is of little use to the majority of markind the Sage doth also exclaim, \"Owater, that art lightly esteemed by the vulgar, who do not perceive thy greatvirtues, in thee lie, as it were, hid the four elements. Thou hast power to dissolve,and conserve, and join nature, such as is possessed by no other thing upon earth.\"If you would know the properties and appearance of this Stone, know that itsappearance is aqueous, and that the water is first changed into a stone, then thestone into water, and the water at length into the Medicine. If you know the Stonewithout the method of its preparation, your knowledge can be of no more use toyou than if you knew the right method without being acquainted with the trueMatter. Therefore our hearts are filled with gratitude to God for both kinds ofknowledge.Concerning the Treasure in the Tincture.For let me tell you that when you have the red [tincture] you have something thatall the treasures of the world will not buy. For it transmutes all metals into truegold, and is therefore much better than the preparation of the Sun. As a medicineit excels all other gold; all diseases may be cured by drinking one drop of thetincture in a glass of wine; and it has power to work many other marvels which wecannot here mention at length. If you wish to prepare the tincture for the Moon,take five half-ounces of the red tincture, and mix it well with five hundredhalf-ounces of the Moon, which have been subjected to the action of fire, thenmelt it, and the whole will be changed into the Tincture and the Medicine. Of thistake half an ounce, and inject it into five hundred half-ounces of Venus or anyother metal, and it will be transmuted into pure silver. Of the red tincture, whichyou have diligently prepared, take one part to a thousand parts of gold, and thewhole will be changed into the red tincture. Of this, again, you may take one partto a thousand parts of Venus, or any other metal, and it will be changed into puregold. For this purpose you need not buy any gold or silver. The first injection youcan make with about a drachm of both; and then you can transmute with thetincture more and, more.You should also know that in our Art we distinguish two things -- the body and thespirit: the former being constant, or fixed, while the other is volatile. These twomust be changed, the one into the other: the body must become water, and thewater body. Then again the body becomes water by its own internal operation, andthe two, i.e., the dry and the liquid, must once more be joined together in aninseparable union. This conjunction could not take place if the two had not beenobtained from one thing; for an abiding union is possible only between things ofthe same nature. Of this kind is the union which takes place in our Art; for theconstituent parts of the Matter are joined together by the operation of nature, andnot by any human hand. The substance is divided into two parts, as we shallexplain further on. For instance, the Eagle is a \"water,\" which being extracted isthen a body dead and lifeless: if it is to be restored to life, the spirit must oncemore be joined to it, and that in a unique fashion, as we see that it devoursgradually again the one eagle after the other. Then the body loses all its grossness,and becomes new and pure; nor can this body and soul ever die, seeing that theyhave entered into an eternal union, such as the union of our bodies and souls shallbe at the last day.The Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (6 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:02]"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Another Description of our Stone.The Enigma of the wise (the Stone) is the Salt and Root of the whole Art, and, as itwere, its Key, without which no one is able either to lock or unlock its secretentrance. No man can understand this Art who does not know the Salt and itspreparation, which takes place in a convenient spot that is both moist and warm;there the dissolution of its liquid must be accomplished, while its substanceremains unimpaired. These are the words of Geber.Explanation.Know that the Salt of which Geber speaks has none of the specific properties ofsalt, and yet is called a Salt, and is a Salt. It is black and fetid, and whenchemically prepared, assumes the appearance of blood, and is at length renderedwhite, pure, and clear. It is a good and precious Salt which, by its own operation,is first impure and then pure. It dissolves and coagulates itself, or, as the Sagesays, it locks and unlocks itself. No Salt has this property but the Salt of the Sages.Its chemical development it may undergo in a moist and convenient place, whereits moisture (as the Sage says) may be dissolved in the Bath of Mary. He means thatit must be warm enough for its water to be distilled, yet not warmer than theexcrement of horses, which is not fresh.Another Description of our Stone.Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia, in his \"Philosophy\" has the followingwords: Know that the Salt is fire and dryness. Fire coagulates, and its nature ishot, dry, and penetrating, even unto the inmost part. Its property is to becomewhite even as the Sun and the Moon with the variations in the extremes of fire, towit, of the natural fire, while the Sun restores redness and the Moon whiteness,and brings bodies to their spiritual condition at the same time that it removestheir blackness and bad sulphur. With it bodies are calcined: it is the secret of thered and white tincture, the foundation and root of all things, and the best of allcreated things after the rational soul of man. For no Stone in the whole world hasa greater efficacy, nor can any child of this earth find the Art without this Stone.Blessed be God in heaven, who hath created this Art in Salt for the transmutationof all things, seeing that it is the quintessence which is above all things, and in allthings. God Most High has not only from Heaven blessed creatures in this fashion,but praise, excellence, power, and wisdom are to be recognised as existing in thisSalt. He who can dissolve and coagulate it, is well acquainted with the arcana ofthis Art. Our Salt is found in a certain precious Salt, and in all things. On thisaccount the ancient Sages called it the \"common moon,\" because all men need it.If you would become rich, prepare this Salt till it is rendered sweet No other salt isso permanent, or has such power to fix the \"soul,\" and to resist fire. The Salt of theearth is the soul; it coagulates all things, is in the midst of the earth when theearth is destroyed; nor is there anything on the earth like its tincture. It is calledRebis (Two-thing), is a Stone, Salt, one body, and, to the majority of mankind, avile and a despised thing. Yet it purifies and restores bodies, represents the Key ofour whole Art, and all things are summed up in it. Only its entering in is so subtlethat few perceive it: yet if it enter a body, it tinges it and brings it to perfection.What then should you desire of God but this Salt and the ingression thereof?If a man lived a hundred thousand years, he could never sufficiently marvel at thewonderful manner in which this noble treasure is obtained from ashes, and againreduced to ashes. In the ashes is Salt, and the more the ashes are burnt, the moreThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (7 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:02]"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ashes it affords; notice also, that that proceeds from fire, and returns to fire,which proceeds from [the] earth. All must confess that in the Salt there are twosalts that kill mercury. This is a most profound saying. For sulphur, and the radicalliquid, are generated in earth of a most subtle nature, and thus is prepared thePhilosopher's Stone, which causes all things, even as the philosophers set forth, toarise out of one thing, and one nature, without the addition of any foreignsubstance. Our Matter is one of the commonest things upon earth, and containswithin itself the four elements. It is, indeed, nothing short of marvellous that somany seek so ordinary a thing, and yet are unable to find it. We might put downmany other characteristics of this Salt, but I prefer to leave the furtherelaboration of this subject to the reader, and to confine myself to a more detailedaccount of its fruits, entrance, and life, of the mode of opening the garden, andcatching a glimpse of the glorious roses, of the way in which they multiply, andbear fruit a thousand-fold; also how you may cause the dead body to reappear,and to be raised again to immortal life, by the power of which it may be able toenter imperfect bodies, purify them, and bring them to perfection, and to a stateof immutable permanence.I now propose to speak of the Stone under three aspects, viz., as the vegetable,the animal, and the mineral Stone; and among these again, of the one whichcontains those four elements that impart life to all. Place this one substance in anairtight alembic, and treat it according to the precepts of our Art, which we shallset forth further on. Then the sowing in the field can take place, and you obtainthe Mineral Stone, and the Green Lion that imbibes so much of its own spirit. Thenlife returns to its spirit through the alembic, and the dead body lies at the bottomof the vessel. In the latter there are still two elements which the fire cannot sever-- for sooner [than that] the ashes are burned in the fire itself, and the Saltthereby becomes stronger. The earth must be calcined until it turns white; thenthe earth is severed of its own accord, and is united to its own earth. For everything strives to be joined to its like. Give it the cold and humid element to drink,and leave it standing eight days, that the two may be well mixed. You must seeyourself what is best to be done after this: for I cannot give you any furtherinformation at present. Sun and Moon must have intercourse, like that of a manand woman: otherwise the object of our Art cannot be attained. All other teachingis false and erroneous. Think upon this Salt as the true foundation of our Art; forits worth outweighs all the treasures of this world. Itself is not developed into thetincture, but the tincture must be added to it. Nor is the substance of our Artfound in any metal.Another Description of the Matter and the MethodBy Senior.Natural things, according to this Sage, are those which have been generated andproduced out of a natural substance by a natural method. Now in its first, or lunar,stage, our Stone is produced from a coagulated white earth, as the Sage says:Behold our Sun in our white earth, and that by which the union in our Art iseffected; which is twice transmuted into water, and whose volatile exhalation,representing that which is most precious in our Substance, is the highestconsolation of the human body. With this water the inward mercury of the metalsmust be extracted. Hence it follows that our Stone is obtained from the elementsof two luminaries (gold and silver), being called our quicksilver and incombustibleoil, the soul and light of bodies -- which alone can afford to dead and imperfectbodies eternal light and life. Therefore I pray and beseech you, my son, to crushquicksilver from our Substance with intelligence and great activity.The Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (8 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:02]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Purging the \"Earth\" of Its Superfluous Earth.The aforesaid earth, or Matter, you must purify, or calcine, so as to extract itswater and spirit. The latter you must enclose in a phial, and pour common aquavita upon it till the substance is covered to the height of three or four fingers; thensubject it to the action of fire for an hour, and diligently distil it by the bath. Whatremains you must again calcine, and extract with its water till you find nothingmore in the \"earth.\" The earth keep for the second stage of the process. The wateryou have extracted distil over a gentle fire. Then you will find at the bottom of thedistilling vessel a certain beautiful substance resembling a crystal stone, which ispurged of all earthly grossness, and is called \"our earth.\" This substance you mustplace in a glass (pumpkin-shaped) distilling vessel, and calcine until it becomes dryand white, and yet liquid withal. Then you have obtained the treasure of thisworld, which has virtue to purify and perfect all earthly things: it enters into all, itnourishes the fixed salt in all things by means of Mercury or the body.Another Description of our Stone.Know, my sons, that the Stone out of which our Art is elaborated, never touchesthe earth after its generation. If it touch the earth, it is of no use for our purpose,although at its first birth it is generated by the Sun and Moon, and embodiescertain earthy elements. It is generated in the earth, then broken, destroyed, andmortified. Out of it arises a vapour which is carried with the wind into the sea, andthence brought back again to the land, where it almost immediately disappears. Itmust be caught in the air, before it touches the ground; otherwise it evaporates.As soon as it is borne from the sea to the land, you must promptly seize it, andenclose it in your phial, then manipulate it in the manner described. You mayknow its coming by the wind, rain, and thunder, which accompany it; therefore itshould not escape you. Though it is born anew every day, yet it existed from thebeginning of the world. But as soon as it falls to the ground, it becomes useless forthe purposes of our Art.\"From our earth wells forth a fertilizing fountain,\"\"whence flow two precious stones. The first\"\"straightway hastens to the rising of the Sun;\"\"the other makes its way to the setting thereof.\"\"From them fly forth two Eagles, plunge into the\"\"flames, and fall once more to the earth. Both\"\"are furnished with feathers, and Sun and Moon,\"\"being placed under their wings, are perfected.\"Know also that two waters flow forth from this fountain; the one (which is thespirit) towards the rising Sun, and the other, the body, towards the setting Sun.The two are really only one very limpid water, which is so bitter as to be quiteundrinkable. The quantity of this water is so great that it flows over the wholeearth, yet leads to nothing but the knowledge of this Art. The same also is misusedtoo often by those who desire it. Take also the \"fire,\" and in it you will find theStone, and nowhere else in the whole world.

Yet no one prizes it, though, next tothe human soul, it is the most beautiful and the most precious thing upon earth,and has power to pull down kings and princes. Nevertheless, it is esteemed theThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (9 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:03]"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"vilest and meanest of earthly things. It is cast away and rejected by all. Indeed itis the Stone which the builders of Solomon disallowed. but if it be prepared in theright way, it is a pearl without price, and, indeed, the earthly antitype of Christ,the heavenly Corner Stone. As Christ was despised and rejected in this world bythe people of the Jews, and nevertheless was more precious than. heaven andearth; so it is with our Stone among earthly things: for the spring where it is foundis called the fount of nature. For even as through Nature all growing things aregenerated by the heat of the Sun, so also through Nature is our Stone born afterthat it has been generated.When you have found the water which contains our Stone, you must take nothingaway from it, nor add anything to it: for it must be entirely prepared by means ofthat which it contains within itself. Then extract the water in an alembic, andseparate the liquid from the dry. The body will then remain alone on the glass,while the water runs down into the lower part. Thereupon unite the water oncemore to the body in the manner described above, and your task will beaccomplished. Know also that the water in which is our Stone, is composed in wellbalanced proportions of the four elements. In the chemical process you will learnto distinguish earth, oil, and water, or body, spirit, and soul: the earth is at thebottom of the glass vessel, the oil, or soul, is with the earth, and the water is thespirit which is distilled from it. In the same way you will come upon two colours,namely, white and red, representing the Moon and the Sun. The oil is the fire, orthe Sun, the water is air, or the Moon; and Sun and Moon are silver and gold whichmust enter into union. But enough, what I have said in this Epistle ought to enableyou to find the Stone, and if herein you fail to discover it, rest assured that it willnever become known to you. Be thou, therefore, a lover of the Art, andcommended unto God the Almighty even unto all eternity. Written in the year 1526after the birth of our Lord.Thus do the Sages write concerning the two waters which yet are only one water --and in thisalone the Stone is to be found. Know also that by so much as the earthly part iswanting, by also so much does the heavenly part abound more fully. Now thisStone renders all dry and arid bodies humid, all cold bodies warm, all impurebodies clear and pure. It contains within itself all healing and transmuting virtue,breathed into it by the art of the Master and the quickening spirit of fire. Thanksbe unto God therefore in all time.The Sun is its Father, the Moon its Mother.If you have those two spirits, they bring forth the Stone, which is prepared out ofone part of Sulphur, or Sun, and four parts of Mercury, or Moon. The Sulphur iswarm and dry, the Mercury cold and moist. That must again be dissolved intowater, which before was water, and the body, which before was mercury, mustagain become mercury.Concerning the First Matter, or Seed of the Metals, including that of the Husband,and that of the Spouse.Metals have their own seed, like all other created things. Generation andparturition take place in them as in everything else that grows. If this were not thecase, we should never have had any metals. Now, the seed is a metallic Matterwhich is liquefied from earth. The seed must be cast into its earth, and theregrow, like that of every other created thing. Therefore, we must prepare theThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (10 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:03]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"earth, or our first Matter, and cast into it the seed, whereupon it will bring forthfruit after its kind. This motion is required for the generation out of one thing,viz., that first Matter; the body must become [a] spirit, and the spirit body: thencearises the medicine which is transmuted from one colour to another. Now, thatwhich is sought in the white produces white, and the red, in like manner, givesred. The first Matter is one thing, and fashioned into its present shape by the handof God, and not of man -- joined together, and transmuted into its [being] essenceby Nature alone. This we take, dissolve, and again conjoin, and wash with its ownwater, until it becomes white, and then again red. Thus our earth, in which wenow may easily see our Sun and Moon, is purified. For the Sun is the Father ofmetals, and the Moon is their Mother: and if generation is to take place, they mustbe brought together as husband and wife. By itself neither can produce anything,and therefore the red and the white must be brought together. And though athousand books have been written about it, yet for all that, the first substance isnot more than one. It is the earth into which we cast our grain, that is to say, ourSun and Moon, which then bear fruit after their kind. If itself be cast into metals,it is changed into that which is best, viz., Sun and Moon. This is most true. Thanksbe unto God.A Simple Account of the True ArtAccording to the Sages, no body is dissolved without the coagulation of the spirit.For as soon as the spirit is transmuted into the body, [the Stone] receives itspower. So long as the spirit is volatile, and liable to evaporate, it cannot produceany effect: when it is fixed, it immediately begins to operate. You must thereforeprepare it as the baker prepares the bread. Take a little of the spirit, and add it tothe body, as the baker adds leaven to the meal, till the whole substance isleavened. It is the same with our spirit, or leaven. The Substance must becontinuously penetrated with the leaven, until it is wholly leavened. Thus thespirit purges and spiritualizes the body, till they are both transmuted into one.Then they transmute all things, into which they are injected, into their ownnature. The two must be united by a gentle and continuous fire, affording thesame degree of warmth as that with which a hen hatches her eggs. It must then beplaced in a St. Mary's Bath, which is neither too warm nor too cold. The humidmust be separated from the dry, and again joined to it. When united, they changemercury into pure gold and silver Thenceforward you will be safe from the pangsof poverty. But take heed that you render thanks unto God for His gracious giftwhich is hidden from many. He has revealed the secret to you that you may praiseHis holy name, and succour your needy neighbour. Therefore, take diligent heed,lest you hide the talent committed to your care. Rather put it out at interest forthe glory of God, and the good of your neighbour. For every man is bound to helphis fellowman, and to be an instrument in the hand of God for relieving hisnecessities. Of this rule Holy Scripture affords an illustration in the example ofJoseph, Habakkuk, Susanna, and others.Here follows my Testament which I have drawn up in your favour, my belovedSons, with all my HeartFor your sakes, beloved students of this Art, and dear Sons, I have committed towriting this my testament, for the purpose of instructing, admonishing, warning,and informing you as to the substance, the method, the pitfalls to be avoided, andthe only way of understanding the writings of the Sages. For as Almighty God hascreated all things out of the dry and the humid elements, our Art, by divine grace,may be said to pursue a precisely similar course. If therefore any man know theThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (11 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:03]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"principle and method of creative nature, he should have a good understanding ofour Art. If anyone be unacquainted with Nature's methods, he will find our Artdifficult, although in reality it is as easy as to crush malt, and brew beer. In thebeginning when, according to the testimony of Scripture, God made heaven andearth, there was only one Matter, neither wet nor dry, neither earth, nor air, norfire, nor light, nor darkness, but one single substance, resembling vapour or mist,invisible and impalpable. It was called Hyle, or the first Matter. If a thing is oncemore to be made out of nothing, that \"nothing\" must be united, and become onething; out of this one thing must arise a palpable substance, out of the palpablesubstance one body, to which a living soul must be given -- whence through thegrace of God, it obtains its specific form. When God made the substance, it wasdry, but held together by moisture. If anything was to grow from that moisture, ithad to be separated from that which was dry, so as to get the fire by itself, andthe earth by itself. Then the earth had to be sprinkled with water, if anythingmoist was to grow out of it, for without moisture nothing can grow. In the sameway, nothing grows in water, except it have earth wherein to strike root. It thenthe water is to bedew the earth, there must be something to bring the water intocontact with the earth; for example, the wind prevents all ordinary water fromflowing to the sea, and remaining there. Thus one element without the aid ofanother can bear no fruit; if there was nothing to set the wind in motion it wouldnever blow -- therefore the fire has received the office of impelling and obliging itto do its work. This you may see when you boil water over the fire; for then therearises a steam which is really air, water being nothing but coagulated air, and airbeing generated from water by the heat of the Sun. For the Sun shines upon thewater, and heats it until steam is seen to issue forth. This vapour becomes wind,and, on account of the large quantity of they air, we get moisture and rain: so airis once more changed or coagulated into water, or rain, and causes all things uponearth to grow, and fills the rivers and the seas.It is the same with our Stone, which is daily generated from [the] air by the Sunand Moon, in the form of a certain vapour, yea, even through the Red Sea; it flowsin Judea in the channel of Nature whither it behoves us to bring it. If we catch it,we lop off its hands and feet, tear off its head, and try to bring it to the red[colour]. If we find anything black in it, we throw it away with the entrails and thefilth. When it has been purified, we take its limbs, join them together again,whereupon our King revives, never to die again, and Is so pure and subtle as topervade all hard bodies, and render them even more subtle than itself. Know alsothat when God, the Almighty, had set Adam in Paradise, He shewed him these twothings in the following words: ' Behold, Adam, here are two things, one fixed andpermanent, the other volatile: their secret virtue thou must not make known to allthy sons.\"Earth, my brother, is constant, and water volatile, as you may see when anythingis burnt. For then that which is constant remains, while that which is volatileevaporates. That which remains resembles ashes, and if you pour water on it, itbecomes an alkali, the efficacy of the ashes passing into the water. If you clarifythe lye, put it into an iron vessel, and let the moisture evaporate over a fire, youwill find at the bottom the substance which before was in the lye, that is to say,the salt of the matter from which the ashes were obtained. This salt might verywell be called the Philosopher's Stone, from being obtained by a process exactlysimilar to that which is employed in preparing the reel Stone, though at the sametime it profits nothing in our work. For the substance which contains our Stone is alye, not indeed prepared by the hand of man from ashes and water, but joinedtogether by Nature, according to the creation and ordination of God, commingledThe Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (12 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:03]"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"of the four elements, possessed of all that is required for its perfect chemicaldevelopment. If you take the substance, which contains our Stone, subject it to aS. Mary's Bath in an alembic, and distil it, the water will run down into theantisternium, and the salt, or earth, remain at the bottom, and is so dry as to bewithout any water, seeing that you have separated the moist from the dry. Poundthe body small, put it into the S. Mary's Bath, and expose it to heat till it is quitedecomposed. Then give it its water to drink, slowly, and at long intervals, till it isclarified. For it coagulates, dissolves, and purifies itself. The distilled water is thespirit which imparts life to its body, and is the alone soul thereof. Water is wind(air), and wind is life, and the life is [in the] soul. In the chemical process, youfind water and oil -- but the oil always remains with the body, and is, as it were,burnt blood. Then it is purified with the body by long, continued gentle heat. Butyou should be careful not to set about this Art before you understand myinstructions, which at the end of this first part are bequeathed to you in the formof a Testament. For the Stone is prepared out of nothing in the whole world,except this substance, which is essentially one. He who is unacquainted therewithcan never attain the Art. It is that one thing which is not dug up from mines orfrom the caverns of the earth, like gold, silver, sulphur, salt, &c., but is found inthe form which God originally imparted to it. It is formed and manifested by anexcessive thickening of air; as soon as it leaves its body, it is clearly seen, but itvanishes without a trace as soon as it touches the earth, and, as ii is never seenagain, it must therefore be caught while it is still in the air -- as I told you oncebefore. I have called it by various names, but the simplest is perhaps that of\"Hyle,\" or first principle of all things. It is also denominated the One Stone of thePhilosophers, composed of hostile elements, the Stone of the Sun. the Stone of theMetals, the runaway slave, the aeriform Stone, the Thirnian Stone, Magnesia, thecorporeal Stone, the Stone of the jewel, the Stone of the free, the golden Stone,the fountain of earthly things, Xelis, or Silex (flint), Xidar, or Radix (root), Atrop,or Porta (gate). By these and many other names it is called, yet it is only one. Ifyou would be a true Alchemist, give a wide berth to all other substances, turn adeaf ear to all other advisers, and strive to obtain a good knowledge of our Stone,its preparation, and its virtue.My Son, esteem this my Testament very highly: for in it I have, out of love andcompassion towards you, given the reins to the warm-hearted impulse whichconstrains me to reveal more than I ought to reveal. But I beseech you, by thePassion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, not to communicate my Testament toignorant, unworthy, or wicked men, lest God's righteous vengeance light upon you,and hurl you into the yawning gulf of everlasting punishment, from which also maythe same merciful God most mercifully preserve us.It is by no means a light thing to shew the nature of the aforesaid Hyle. Hyle is thefirst Matter, the Salt of the Sages, Azoth, the seed of all metals, which is extractedfrom the body of \"Magnesia\" and the Moon.Hyle is the first principle of all things -- the Matter that was from the beginning. Itwas neither moist, nor dry, nor earth, nor water, nor light, nor darkness, but amixture of all these things, and this mixture is HYLE.Next: The Glory of the World (part 2)The Glory of the World (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory1.htm (13 of 13) [27/05/2004 23:02:03]"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Glory of the World (part 2)Here Follows The Second Part Of This Book.In the beginning, when God Almighty had created our first parent Adam, togetherwith all other earthly and heavenly bodies, He set him in Paradise, and forbadehim, under penalty of eternal death, to eat of the fruit of the tree of theknowledge of good and evil So long as Adam obeyed the Divine precept he hadimmortality, and possessed all that he needed for perfect happiness. But when hehad partaken of the forbidden fruit, he was, by the command of God, driven forthinto this world, where he and his descendants have since that time sufferednothing but poverty, disease, anxiety, bitter sorrow, and death. If he had beenobedient to the Divine injunction, he would have lived a thousand years inParadise in perfect happiness, and would then have been translated to heaven;and a like happy destiny would have awaited all his descendants. For hisdisobedience God visited him with all manner of sufferings and diseases; but in Hismercy also shewed him a medicine whereby the different defects brought in by sinmight be remedied, and the pangs of hunger and disease resisted, as we are, forinstance, preserved and strengthened by bodily meat and drink.It was on account of this original sin that Adam, in spite of his great wisdom andthe many arts that God had taught him, could not accomplish his full thousandyears. But if he had not known the virtues of herbs, and the Medicine, he wouldcertainly not have lived as long as he did. When, however, at length his Medicinewould no longer avail to sustain life, he sent his son Seth to Paradise to fetch thetree of life. This he obtained after a spiritual manner. But Seth did seek also andwas given some olives of the Tree of the Oil of Mercy, which he planted on thegrave of his father. From them sprang up the blessed Tree of the Holy Cross, whichthrough the atoning death of our Redeemer became to us wretched, sinful men, amost potent tree of life, in gracious fulfilment of the request of our first parentAdam. On the other hand, the suffering, disease, and imperfection brought notonly upon men, but also upon plants and animals, by the fall of Adam, found aremedy in that precious gift of Almighty God, which is called the Elixir, andTincture, and has power to purge away the imperfections not only of human, buteven of metallic bodies; which excels all other medicines, as the brightness of thesun shames the moon and the stars. By means of this most noble Medicine manymen, from the death of Adam to the fourth monarchy, procured for themselvesperfect health and great length of days. Hence those who had a good knowledge ofthe Medicine, attained to three hundred years, others to four hundred, some tofive hundred, like Adam; others again to nine hundred, like Methusalem and Noah;and some of their children to a longer period still, like Bacham, Ilrehur, Kalix,Hermes, Geber, Albanus, Ortulanus, Morienus, Alexander of Macedonia,Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, and many others who possessed the Medicine of theBlessed Stone in silence, and neither used it for evil purposes, nor made it knownto the wicked; just as God Himself has in all times hidden this knowledge from theThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (1 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"proud, the impure, and the froward.

Now when you haveattained this great result, take care that you do not hide your talent. Use it for thesolace of the suffering, the building of Christian schools and churches, and theglory of the Holy Trinity. Otherwise God will call you to an eternal account foryour criminal neglect of His gift May God deign to keep us from such a sin, and toestablish us in His Holy Word!To the Reader.If it should seem unto you a tedious matter, my friendly reader, to read throughand digest my book, I advise you to cheer yourself on by bearing in mind the greatobject you have in view. If you do so you will find the book very pleasant reading,and a joy indeed. Since God -- praised in all times be his Holy and VenerableName! -- in His unspeakable mercy has made known to me the magistery of thismost true and noble Art, I am moved and constrained by brotherly love to shewyou the manner of producing this treasure, in order that you may be able to avoidthe ruinous trouble and expense to which I was put in the course of a long andfruitless search. I will endeavour to be as clear and outspoken as possible, in orderto vindicate myself from the possible charge of imposture, malice, and avarice. Iam most anxious that the gift which God has committed to my trust shall not rust,or rot, or be useless in my hands. For this most precious Medicine is so full ofglorious potency as to be most justly styled the Oil of Mercy, for reasons whichyour own understanding will suggest to you. It is therefore unnecessary for me togo into this preliminary question at any great length. I may at once proceed to giveyou an account of the Art itself, and to put you on your guard against all seducingdeceivers, -- in short, to open up to you a true, unerring, and joyful road to theknowledge and possession of the Stone, and to the operations of this Art.Therefore, I -- who possess the Stone, and communicate to you this Book -- wouldfaithfully admonish and beseech you to keep this my TABLE of PARADISE andGLORY of the WORLD, from all proud and unjust oppressors of the poor; from allpresumptuous, shallow, scornful, calumnious, and wicked persons, so as not to putit into their hands, on pain of God's everlasting punishment. I beseech you to takethis warning to heart; but, on the other hand, to communicate and impart this myTable to all true, poor, pious, honest, and benevolent persons, who will gratefullyreverence and rightly use the merciful gift of God, and conceal it from theunworthy. Nevertheless, even if my book should find its way into the hands ofwicked men, God will so smite them with blindness as to prevent them fromapprehending too much of my meaning, and frustrate all their attempts to carryout my directions. For God knows how to confound the wicked, and bring theirpresumption to nought; as we are also told by David in his psalms: \"Thine enemiesshalt thou hold in thine hand, and shalt restrain them in the snares of their mind.\"I beseech you, therefore, my sons, to give diligent heed to my teaching; then youwill spend this life in health and happiness, and at length inherit everlasting joy. Ipray that God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, may grant this my petition.An Account of the True ArtI make known to all ingenuous students of this Art that the Sages are in the habitThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (2 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"of using words which may convey either a true or a false impression; the former totheir own disciples and children, the latter to the ignorant, the foolish, and theunworthy. Bear in mind that the philosophers themselves never make a falseassertion. The mistake (if any) lies not with them, but with those whose dulnessmakes them slow to apprehend the meaning. Hence it comes that, instead of thewaters of the Sages, these inexperienced persons take pyrites salts, metals, anddivers other substances which, though very expensive, are of no use whatever forour purpose. For no one would dream of buying the true Matter at theapothecary's; nay, that tradesman daily casts it into the street as worthlessrefutes. Yet the matter of our Stone is found in all those things which are used byignorant charlatans: for it is our Stone, our Salt, our Mercury, our verdigris,halonitre, salmiac, Mars, sulphur, &c. It is not dug out with pick-axes fromordinary mountains, seeing that our Stone is found in our mountains and springs;our Salt is found in our salt-spring, our metal in our earth, and from the sameplace we dig up our mercury and sulphur. But what we mean by our mines andsprings these charlatans cannot understand. For God has blinded their minds andmade gross their senses, and left them to carry on their experiments with allmanner of false substances. Nor do they seem able to perceive their error, or to beroused from their idle imaginations by persistent failure. Where they should havedistilled with gentle heat they sublime over a fierce fire, and reduce theirsubstance to ashes, instead of developing its inherent principles by vitalizingwarmth. Again, when they should have dissolved, they coagulated instead, and soon. By these false methods they could, of course, obtain no good result; butinstead of blaming their own ignorance they lay the fault on their teacher, andeven deny the genuineness of our Art. As a matter of fact, all their mistakes arisefrom their misinterpreting the meaning of words which should have put them onthe right scent. For instance, when the Sages speak of calcining, these personsunderstand that word to mean \"burning,\" and consequently render their substanceuseless by burning it to ashes. When the Sages \"dissolve,\" or transmute into\"water,\" these shallow persons corrode with aqua fortis. They do not understandthat the dissolution must be effected with something that is contained within oursubstance, and not by means of any foreign appliance. These foolish devices bearthe same relation to our Art that a dark hole bears to a transparent crystal. Et istheir own ignorance that prevents them from attaining to a true knowledge; butthey put the blame on our writings, and call us charlatans and impostors. Theyargue that if the Stone could be found at all, they must have discovered it longago, their eyes being as keen and their minds as acute as they are. \"Behold,\" saythey, \"how we have toiled day and night, how many books we have read, howmany years we have spent in our laboratories: surely if there were anything in thisArt, it could not have escaped us.\" By speaking thus, they only exhibit their ownpresumption and folly. They themselves have no eyes, and they make that anargument for blaspheming our high and holy Art. Therefore, you should first striveto make yourself acquainted with the secrets of Nature's working, and with theelementary principles of the world, before you set your hand to this task. Afteracquiring this knowledge, carefully peruse this book from beginning to end; youwill then be in a position to judge whether our Art is tree or false. You will alsoknow what substance you must take, how you must prepare it, and how your eagersearch may be brought to a successful issue. Let me enjoin you, therefore, topreserve strict silence, to let nobody know what you are doing, and to keep a goodheart: then God will grant you the fulfilment of all your wishes.Here follows my own Opinion and Philosophical Dictum.I now propose to put down a brief statement of the view which I take of thisThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (3 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"matter. He who understands my meaning may at once pass on to the opinions ofthe various Sages, which I have placed at the end of my book. He who does notapprehend my meaning, will find it explained in the following treatise.Since I know the blessed and true Art, with the nature and the matter of theStone, I have thought it my duty freely to communicate it to you -- Not in alawyer's style, nor in pompous language, but in few and sample words. Whoeverperuses this book carefully, and with an elementary knowledge of naturalrelations, cannot miss the secret which I intend to convey. I am afraid that I shallbe overwhelmed with reproaches for speaking out with so much plainness, seeingthat this Art has never, from the beginning of the world, been so clearly explainedas I mean to explain it in this Book. Nevertheless, I am well aware that I am nowdeclaring a secret which must for ever remain hidden from the wise of this world,and from those who are established in their own conceits. But I must now proceedto give you the result of my experienceMy beloved sons and disciples, and all ye that are students of this Art; I herewith,in the fulness of Christian faith and charity. do make known to you that thePhilosopher's Stone grows not only on \"our\" tree, but is found, as far as its effectand operation are concerned, in the fruit of all other trees, in all created things,in animals, and vegetables, in things that grow, and in things that do not grow. Forwhen it rises, being stirred and distilled by the Sun and the Moon, it imparts theirown peculiar form and properties to all living creatures by a divine grace; it givesto flowers their special form and colour, whether it be black, red, yellow, green,or white; in the same way all metals and minerals derive their peculiar qualitiesfrom the operation of this Stone. All things, I say, are endowed with theircharacteristic qualities by the operation of this Stone, i.e., the conjunction of theSun and Moon. For the Sun is the Father, and the Moon the Mother of this Stone,and the Stone unites in itself the virtues of both its parents. Such are the peculiarproperties of our Stone, by which it may be known. If you understand theoperation, the form, and the qualities, of this Stone, you will be able to prepareit; but if you do not, I faithfully counsel you to give up all thought of everaccomplishing this task.Observe, furthermore, how the seeds of all things that grow, as, for instance,grains of wheat or barley, spring forth from the ground, by the operation of theStone, and the developing influences of Sun and Moon; how they grow up into theair, are gradually matured, and bring forth fruit, which again must be sown in itsown proper soil. The field is prepared for the grain, being well ploughed up, andmanured with well rotted dung; for the earth consumes and assimilates themanure, as the body assimilates its food, and separates the subtle from the grossTherewith it calls forth the life of the seed, and nourishes it with its own propermilk, as a mother nourishes her infant, and causes it to increase in size, and togrow upward. The earth separates, I say, the good from the bad, and imparts it asnutriment to all growing things; for the destruction of one thing is the generationof another. It is the same in our Art, where the liquid receives its proper nutrimentfrom the earth. Hence the earth is the Mother of all things that grow; and it mustbe manured, ploughed, harrowed, and well prepared, in order that the corn maygrow, and triumph over the tares, and not be choked by them. A grain of wheat israised from the ground through the distillation of the moisture of the Sun andMoon, if it has been sown in its own proper earth. The Sun and Moon must alsoimpel it to bring forth fruit, if it is to bring forth fruit at all. For the Sun is theFather, and the Moon the Mother, of all things that grow.The Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (4 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"In the same way, in our soil, and out of our seed, our Stone grows through thedistilling of the Sun and Moon; and as it grows it rises upwards, as it were, into theair, while its root remains in the ground. That which is above is even as that whichis below; the same law prevails; there is no error or mistake. Again, as herbs growupward, put forth glorious flowers and blossoms, and bear fruit, so oar grainblossoms, matures its fruit, is threshed, sifted, purged of its chaff, and again putin the earth, which, however, must previously have been well manured, harrowed,and otherwise prepared. When it has been placed in its natural soil, and wateredwith rain and dew, the moisture of heaven, and roused into life by the warmth ofthe Sun and Moon, it produces fruit after its own kind. These two sowings arepeculiar characteristics of our Art. For the Sun and Moon are our grain, which weput into our soil, as soul and spirit -- and such as are the father and the motherwill be the children that they generate. Thus, my sons, you know our Stone, ourearth, our grain, our meal, our ferment, our manure, our verdigris, our Sun andMoon. You understand our whole magistery, and may joyfully congratulateyourselves that you have at length risen above the level of those blind charlatansof whom I spoke. For this, His unspeakable mercy, let us render thanks and praiseto the Creator of all things, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.Concerning the Origin of Metals.My son, I will now proceed to explain to you more in detail the generation of themetals, and the way in which they receive their growth and development, withtheir special form and quality. You will thereby be enabled to understand, evenfrom the very foundation, with marvellous accuracy and clearness, the principlethat underlies our whole Art. Permit me, therefore, to inform you that all animals,trees, herbs, stones, metals, and minerals, grow and attain to perfection, withoutbeing necessarily touched by any human hand: for the seed is raised up from theground, puts forth flowers, and bears fruit, simply through the agency of naturalinfluences. As it is with plants, so it is with metals. While they lie in the heart ofthe earth, in their natural ore, they grow, and are developed, day by day, throughthe influence of the four elements: their fire is the splendour of the Sun and Moon;the earth conceives in her womb the splendour of the Sun, and by it the seeds ofthe metals are well and equally warmed, just like the grain in the fields. Throughthis warmth there is produced in the earth a vapour or spirit, which rises upwardand carries with it the most subtle elements. It might well be called a fifthelement: for it is a quintessence, and contains the most volatile parts of all theelements. This vapour strives to float upward through the summit of themountains, but, being covered with great rocks, they prevent it from doing so: forwhen it strikes against them, it is compelled to descend again. It is drawn up bythe Sun, it is forced down again by the rocks, and as it falls the vapour istransmuted into a liquid, i.e., sulphur and mercury. Of each of these a part is leftbehind -- but that which is volatile rises and descends again, more and more of itremaining behind, and becoming fixed after each descent. This \"fixed\" substance isthe metals, which cleave so firmly to the earth and the stones that they must besmelted out in a red-hot furnace. The grosser the stones and the earth of themountains are, the less pure will the metal be; the more subtle the soil and thestones are, the more subtle will be the vapour, and the sulphur and mercuryformed by its condensation -- and the purer these latter are, the purer, of course,will the metals themselves be. When the earth and the stones of the mountain aregross, the sulphur and mercury must partake of this grossness, and cannot attain totheir proper development. Hence arise the different metals, each after its ownkind. For as each tree of the field has its own peculiar shape, appearance, andfruit, so each mountain bears its own particular ore, those stones and that earthThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (5 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"being the soil in which the metals grow. The quality of this soil is to a great extentdependent upon planetary influences. The nearer the mountains lie to the planets,the more do metals grow in them; for the qualities of metals are determined byplanetary influences. Mountains that are turned towards the sun have subtle stonesand earth, and produce nothing but gold. If they are more conveniently situatedfor being influenced by the moon, their metallic substance is turned into silver.For all metals, when perfectly developed, must ultimately become Moon and Sun,though some need to be operated on by the Sun and Moon longer than others: forthe Sun is the Father, and the Moon the Mother, of all things that grow. Thus yousee that gold glitters like the Sun, and silver like the Moon. Now, children alwaysresemble their parents; and all metallic bodies contain within themselves theproperties of the Sun: to change the baser metals into gold and silver, there ispositively nothing wanting but gentle solar warmth. In this respect there exists aclose analogy between animal and vegetable growth. When the Sun retires in thewinter, the flowers droop and die, the trees shed their leaves, and all vegetabledevelopment is temporarily suspended. In the summer again, when the heat of theSun is too great, not being sufficiently tempered by the cooling influences of theMoon, all vegetation is withered and burnt up If there is to be perfect growth, theSun and Moon must work together, the one heating and the other cooling. If theinfluence of the Moon prevails unduly, it must be corrected by the warmth of theSun, the excessive heat of the Sun must be tempered by the coldness of the Moon.All development is sustained by solar fire. Imperfect metals are what they are,simply because they have not yet been duly developed by solar influences.Now, by the special grace of God, it is possible to bring this natural fire to bear onimperfect metals by means of our Art, and to supply the conditions of metallicgrowth without any of the hindrances which in a natural state prevent perfection.Thus by applying our natural fire, we can do more towards \"fixing\" imperfectbodies and metals in a moment, than the Sun in a thousand years. For this reasonour Stone has also power to cure all things that grow, acting on each one accordingto its kind. For our Matter represents a perfect and inseparable union of the fourelements, which indeed is the sum of our Art, and is consequently able toreconcile and heal all discord in all manner of metals and in all things that grow,and to put to flight all diseases. For disease is discord of the elements, (one undulylording it over the rest) in animal as well as in metallic bodies. Now as soon as ourblessed Medicine is applied, the elements are straightway purified, and joinedtogether in amity; thus metallic bodies are fixed, animal bodies are made whole ofall their diseases, gems and precious stones attain to their own proper perfection.You should also know that all stones are generated by the Sun and Moon out of thesulphur and volatile mercury; if they do not become metals, that is entirely due totheir own grossness. In the same way, all plants are generated from sulphur andmercury, and that by the heat of the Sun and Moon. For the Sun and Moon are themercury in our Matter. The Sun is warm and dry, the Moon warm and moist; for in[the] earth is hid a warm and dry fire, and in that fire dwells warm and moist air --and from these is generated mercury which is both warm and moist. Hence theremay be distinguished two chief constituent principles, to wit, moist and dry, thatis, earth, wind, and water, unto which mercury is conjoined, and the same is warmand moist. Mercury and sulphur, in our substance, and in all things, spring from themoist and dry, the moist and dry being stirred by the warmth of the Sun, anddistilled and sublimed, -- in each thing according to its specific nature. Thus ourStone is that mercury which is mixed of the dry and the moist. But the commonmercury is useless for our purpose -- for it is volatile, while our mercury is fixedand constant. Therefore have nothing to do with the common mercury, but takeThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (6 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"our mercury which is the principle of growth in all bodies, whether human,vegetable, or metallic; which imparts to all flowers their fragrance and colour.This mercury represents an harmonious mixture of the four elements, hot and dry,Sun and Moon. Ii is generated in the form of a vapour in the fields and on themountains, by the warmth of the Sun: that vapour is condensed into a moisture,from which arise sulphur and mercury, and from them again metals The sameprocess takes place in our Art, which represents the union of the warm and moist,by means of warmth. For our substance is generated in the form of a vapour out ofwarmth and moisture, and changed into sulphur. In this fire and water, andnowhere else, is our Stone to be found. For the vapour carries upward with it mostsubtle earth, most subtle fire, most subtle water, and most subtle air, and thuspresents a close union of the most subtle elements. This is the first Matter, andmay be divided into water and earth, which two are again joined together bygentle heat, even as in the woods and mountains mercury is joined with a quickearth and rare water by means of a temperate warmth, and in the long process oftime is converted into metal. So is it ordained in our Art, and not otherwise doesthe process take place. When you, therefore, see that our substance, having beenfirst generated in the form of a vapour, permits itself to be separated into waterand earth, you may know that the Stone is composed of the four elements. Knowalso that the vapour in the mountains is true mercury (which cannot be said of theordinary mercury); for wherever there is vapour in the mountains, there is truemercury, which by ascending and descending, in the manner described above,becomes fixed, and inseparable from its earth, so that where the one is, there theother must abide.Thus I have told you plainly enough how the metals are generated, what mercuryis, and how it is transmuted into metals. I will therefore conclude this part of mytreatise, and tell you in the following section how you may actually perform thechemical process. You see that it is not so incredible, after all, that all metalsshould be transmuted into gold and silver, and all animal bodies delivered fromevery kind of disease; and I hope and trust that God will permit you practically toexperience the truth of this assertion.Now I will tell you how you must produce the Fire and Water, in which is preparedthe Mercury required for thee red and white Tincture.Take fire, or the quicklime of the Sages, which is the vital fire of all trees, andtherein doth God Himself burn by divine love. In it purify Mercury, and mortify itfor the purposes of our Art; understand, with vulgar Mercury, which you wish to fixin water or fire. But the Mercury which lies hidden in this water, or fire, is thereinfixed of itself. The Mercury which is in the fire must be decomposed, clarified,coagulated, and fixed with indelible, living, or Divine fire, of that kind which Godhas placed in the Sun; and wherein God Himself burns as with Divine love for theconsolation of all mankind. Without this fire our Art can not be brought to asuccessful issue. This is the fire of the Sages which they describe in such obscureterms, as to have been the indirect cause of beguiling many innocent persons totheir ruin; so even that they have perished in poverty because they knew hot thisfire of the Philosophers. It is the most precious fire that God has created in theearth, and has a thousand virtues -- nay, it is so precious that men have averredthat the Divine Power itself works effectually in it. It has the purifying virtue ofPurgatory, and everything is rendered better by it. It is not wonderful, therefore,that a fire should be able to fix and clarify Mercury, and to cleanse it from allgrossness and impurity. The Sages call it the living fire, because God has endowedit with His own Divine, and vitalising power.The Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (7 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"In the writings of the Sages, this fire goes by different names. Some call it \"burnt\"wine, others assign to it three names from the analogy of the Three Persons of theHoly Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; Body, Soul,and Fire, or Spirit.The Sages further say: The fire is fire, and also water, containing within itself bothcold and heat, moisture, and dryness, nor can anything extinguish it but itself.Hence others say that it is an inextinguishable fire, which is continually burning,purifying, and tinging all metals, consuming all their impurities, and combiningMercury with the Sun in so close an union that they become one and inseparable.Therefore our great Teachers say that as God the Father, the Son, and the HolyGhost, are three Persons, and yet but one God; so this fire unites these threethings, namely, the Body, Spirit, and Soul, or Sun, Mercury, and Soul. The firenourishes the Soul which binds together the Body and the Spirit, and thus all threebecome one, and remain united for ever. Again, as an ordinary fire, on beingsupplied with fuel, may spread and fill the whole world, so this Tincture may bemultiplied, and so this fire may enter into all metals; and one part of it has powerto change two, three, or five hundred parts of other metals into gold.Again, the Sages call this fire the fire of the Holy Spirit, because as the Divinity ofChrist took upon itself true flesh and blood without forfeiting anything of its DivineNature, so the Sun, the Moon, and Mercury, are transmuted into the true Tincture,which remains unaffected by all outward influences, and endures, and will endure,for ever. Once more, as God feeds many wicked sinners with his blood, so thisTincture tinges all gross and impure metals, without being injured by contact withthem. So also, therefore, may it be compared with the sacro-saintly Sacrament ofthe Most Holy Eucharist, from which no sinner is excluded, how impure soever hemay have been. You have thus been made acquainted with the all but miraculousvirtue of this fire: remember that no student of this Art can possibly do without it.For another Sage says: \"In this invisible fire you have the whole mystery of this Art,as the three Persons of the Holy Trinity are truly concluded in one substance.\" Inthis fire the true Art is summed up in three palpable things, which yet are invisibleand incomprehensible, like the Holy Spirit. Without those three things our Art cannever be brought to perfection. One of them is fire; the second, water; the third,earth; and all those three are invisibly present in one essence, and are theinstrumental cause of all perfection in Nature.Now will I also describe the operation of those Three Things in our art, and will atonce begin with all Three.Our wise Teacher Plato says: \"Every husbandman who sows good seed, first choosesa fertile field, ploughs and manures it well, and weeds it of all tares; he also takescare that his own grain is free from every foreign admixture. When he hascommitted the seed to the ground, he needs moisture, or rain, to decompose thegrain, and to raise it to new life. He also requires fire, that is, the warmth of theSun, to bring it to maturity.\" The needs of our Art are of an analogous nature.First, you must prepare your seed, i.e., cleanse your Matter from all impurity, by amethod which you will find set forth at length in the Dicta of the Sages which Isubjoin to this Treatise. Then you must have good soil in which to sow yourMercury and Sun; this earth must first be weeded of all foreign elements if it is toyield a good crop. Hence the Sage enjoins us to \"sow the seed in a fruitful field,which has been prepared with living fire, and it will produce much fruit\".

Thespirit which is extracted from the metals is the urine of children: for it is the seedand the first principle of metals. Without this seed there is no consummation ofour Art, and no Tincture, either red or white. For the sulphur and mercury of goldare the red, the sulphur and mercury of silver are the white Tincture: the Mercuryof the Sun and Moon fixes all Mercury in imperfect metals, and imparts excellenceand durability even to common Mercury. Dioscorides has written an eleganttreatise concerning this Urine of Children, which he calls the first Matter ofmetals.What is the Mercury of the Sages?Mercury is nothing but water and salt, which have been subjected for a long spaceof time to natural heat so as to be united into one. This is Mercury, or dry water,which is not moist, and does not moisten anything; of course, I do not speak ofcrude common mercury, but of the Mercury of the Sages. The Sages call it the fifthelement. It is the vital principle which brings all plants to maturity and perfection.The other quintessence, which is in the earth, and partly material, contains withinitself its own seed which grows out of its soil. The heavenly quintessence comes tothe aid of the earthly, removes the grossness of its earth, and brings the aforesaidseed to maturity. For Mercury, and the Celestial Quintessence, drain off allharmful moisture from the quintessence of the earth. This Mercury is also calledsulphur of the air, sulphur being a hardening of mercury; or we may describe themas husband and wife, from whom issue many children in the earth. You must notthink that I desire to hide from you my true meaning: nay, I will further endeavourto illustrate it in the following way. Common sulphur, as you know, coagulatescommon mercury; for sulphur is poisonous, and mercury deadly. How then can youobtain from either of them anything suitable for perfecting the other, seeing thatboth require to be assisted by some external agent? On the other hand, I tell youthat if, after the conjunction of our fixed sulphur with our sublimed mercury, yousprinkle a mere particle of it upon crude mercury, the latter is at once brought toperfection. Again, you may clearly perceive that the quintessence of the earth hasits operation in the winter when the earth is closed up with frost; while theQuintessence of the Stars operates in the summer times when it removes all that isinjurious in the inferior quintessence, and thus quickens everything into vigorousgrowth. The two quintessences' may also be driven off into water, and thereconserved. An earthly manifestation you may behold in the colours of the rainbow,when the rays of the Sun shine through the rain. But, indeed, there is not a stone,an animal, or a plant, that does not contain both quintessences. In short, theyembody the secret of our whole Magistery, and out of them our Stone is prepared.Hermes, in his Emerald Table, expresses himself as follows: \"Our Blessed Stone,which is of good substance, and has a soul, ascends from earth to heaven, andagain descends from heaven to earth. Its effectual working is in the air; it is joinedto Mercury; hence the Sun is its Father, the Moon its Mother; the wind has borne itin her womb, the earth is its nursing mother, and at length that which is above isalso that which is below. The whole represents a natural mixture: for it is a Stoneand not a Stone, fixed and volatile, body and soul, husband and wife, King andQueen.\" Let what I have said suffice, instead of many other words and parables.Composition.Albertus expresses himself thus concerning the conjunction of the Stone: \"TheThe Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (9 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"elements are so subtle that no ordinary method of mingling will avail.

This must again be coagulated and dissolved, and so also again untilthe whole has become one, without any transmutation. All this is accomplished bythe virtue of our mercurial water; for with it the body is dissolved. It is that whichpurifies, conjoins, dissolves, and makes red and white.\" Aristotle says of it asfollows: This water is the earth in which Hermes bids us sow the seed; the Sun orMoon, as Senior hath it, for extraction of the Divine water of sulphur and mercury,which is fire, warming and fructifying by the igneous virtue thereof. This is theMercury and that is the water which wets not the hand. It is the Mercury which allSages have loved and used, and of which they have acknowledged the virtue solong as they lived.Next: The Glory of the World (part 3)The Glory of the World (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory2.htm (10 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:04]"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Glory of the World (part 3)The Third Part Of This Treatise, Containing The DictaOf The Sages.i. I will now proceed to quote the very words of the various Sages in regard to thispoint, in order that you may the more easily understand our meaning. Know thenthat Almighty God first delivered this Art to our Father, Adam, in Paradise. For assoon as He had created him, and set him in the Garden of Eden, He imparted it tohim in the following words: \"Adam, here are two things: that which is above isvolatile, that which is below is fixed. These two things contain the whole mystery.Observe it well, and make not the virtue that slumbers therein known to thychildren; for these two things shall serve thee, together with all other createdthings under heaven, and I will lay at thy feet all the excellence and power of thisworld, seeing that thou thyself art a small world.\"ii. ABEL, the son of Adam, wrote thus in his Principles: After God had created ourFather, Adam, and set him in Paradise, He subjected to his rule all animals, plants,minerals, and metals. For man is the mountain of mountains, the Stone of allstones, the tree of trees, the root of roots, the earth of earths. All these things heincludes within himself, and God has given to him to be the preserver of all things.iii. SETH, the son of Adam, describes it thus: Know, my children, that in proportionas the acid is subjected to coction, by means of our Art, and is reduced into ashes,the more of the substance is extracted, and becomes a white body. If you cook thiswell, and free it from all blackness, it is changed into a stone, which is called awhite stone until it is crushed. Dissolve it in water of the mouth, which has beenwell tempered, and its whiteness will soon change to redness. The whole process isperformed by means of this sharp acid and the power of God.iv. ISINDRUS: Our great and precious Matter is air, for air ameliorates the Matter,whether the air be gross or tenuous, warm or moist. For the grossness of the airarises from the setting, the approach, and the rising of the Sun. Thus the air maybe hot or cold, or dry and rarefied, and the degrees of this distinguish summer andwinter.v. ANAXAGORAS says: God and His goodness are the first principle of all things.Therefore, the mildness of God reigns even beneath the earth, being the substanceof all things, and thus also the substance beneath the earth. For the mildness ofGod mirrors itself in creating, and His integrity in the solidity that is beneath theearth. Now we cannot see His goodness, except in bodily form. -vi. SENIOR, orPANDOLPHUS, says: I make known to posterity that the thinness, or softness, of airis in water, and is not severed from the other elements. If the earth had not itsvital juice, no moisture would remain in it.vii.

PYTHAGORAS: That which is touched and not seen, also that which is knownbut not looked upon, these are only heaven and earth; again, that which is notknown is in the world and is perceived by sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch.Sight shews the difference between black and white; hearing, between good andevil; taste, between sweet and bitter; touch, between subtle and gross; smell,between fragrant and fetid.ix. ARISTEUS, in his Second Table, says: Beat the body which I have made known toyou into thin plates; pour thereon our salt water, i.e., water of life, and heat itwith a gentle fire until its blackness disappears, and it becomes first white, andthen red.x. PARMENIDES: The Sages have written about many waters, stones, and metals,for the purpose of deceiving you. You that desire a knowledge of our Art,relinquish Sun, Moon, Saturn, and Venus, for our ore, and our earth, and why so?Every thing is of the nature of no thing.xi. LUCAS: Take the living water of the Moon, and coagulate it, according to ourcustom. By those last words I mean that it is already coagulated. Take the livingwater of the Moon, and put it on our earth, till it becomes white: here, then, isour magnesia, and the natures of natures rejoice.xii. ETHEL: Subject our Stone to coction till it becomes as bright as white marble.Then it is made a great and effectual Stone, sulphur having been added to sulphur,and preserving its property.xiii.

It must continue drinking its own water and moisture till it turns white. .xiv. PHILETUS Know, ye sons of philosophy, that the substance, the search afterwhich reduces so many to beggary, is not more than one thing of most effectualproperties. It is looked down upon by the ignorant, but held in great esteem by theSages. Oh, how great is the folly, and how great also is the presumptuousignorance of the vulgar herd! If you knew the virtue of this substance, kings,princes, and nobles would envy you. We Sages call it the most sharp acid, andwithout this acid nothing can be obtained, neither blackness, whiteness, nor theTincture.xv. METHUSALEM: With air, vapour, and spirit we shall have vulgar mercurychanged into as good a silver as the nature of minerals will allow in the absence ofheat.xvi; SIXION: Ye sons of philosophy, if you would make our substance red, you mustfirst make it white. Its three natures are summed up in whiteness and redness.Take e, therefore, our Saturn, subject it to coction in aqua vita -- until it turnswhite, becomes thick, and is coagulated, and then again till it becomes red. Thenit is red lead, and without this lead of the Sages nothing can be effected.xvii.

For nothing can be done in our Art without thisindestructible water. For the Sages have described its power and efficacy as beingthat of spiritual blood. Transmute this water into body and spirit, and then, by thegrace of God, you will have the spirit firmly fixed in the body.xix. PYTHAGORAS, in his Second Book, delivers himself as follows: The Sages haveused different names for the substance, and have told us to make theindestructible water white and red. They have also apparently indicated variousmethods, but they really agree with each other in regard to all essentials, and it isonly their mystic language that causes a semblance of disagreement. Our Stone is astone, and not a stone. It has neither the appearance nor the properties of stone,and yet it is a stone. Many have called it after the place where it is found; othersafter its colour.xx. NEOPHIDES: I bid you take that mystic substance, white magnesia And have acare that the Stone be pure and bright. Then place it in its aqueous vessel, andsubject it to gentle heat, until it first becomes black, then again white, and thenred. The whole process should be accomplished in forty days. When you have donethis, God shows you the first substance of the Stone, which is an eagle -- stone,and known to all men.xxi. THEOPHILUS: Take white Magnesia, i.e., quicksilver, mingled with the Moon.Pound it till it becomes thin water; subject it to coction for forty days; then theflower of the Sun will open with great splendour. Close well the mouth of thephial, and subject it to coction during forty days, when you will obtain a beautifulwater, which you must treat in the same way for another forty days, until it isthoroughly purged of its blackness, and becomes white and fragrant.xxii. BAELUS says: I bid you take Mercury, which is the Magnesia of the Moon, andsubject it and its body to coction till it becomes soft, thin, and like flowing water.Heat it again till all its moisture is coagulated, and it becomes a Stone.xxiii. BASAN says: Put the yellow Matter into the bath, together with its spouse,and let not the bath be too hot, lest both be deprived of consciousness.

Coction, calcination, distillation, sublimation,desiccation, humectation, albefaction, and rubrefaction, are all included in thenatural development of this one substance.xxvii. MOSINUS: The Sages have described our substance, and the method of itspreparation, under many names, and thus have led many astray who did notunderstand our writing. It is composed of red and white sulphur, and of fixed orindestructible water, called permanent water.xxviii. PLATO: Let it suffice you to dissolve bodies with this water, lest they beburned. Let the substance be washed with living water till all its blacknessdisappears, and it becomes a white Tincture.xxix. ORFULUS: First, subject the Matter to gentle coction, of a temperature suchas that with which a hen hatches her eggs, lest the moisture be burnt up, and thespirit of our earth destroyed. Let the phial be tightly closed that the earth maycrush our substance, and enable its spirit to be extracted. The Sages say thatquicksilver is extracted from the flower of our earth, and the water of our fireextracted from two things, and transmuted into our acid. But though they speak ofmany things, they mean only one thing, namely, that indestructible water which isour substance, and our acid.xxx. BATHON: If you know the Matter of our Stone, and the mode of regulating itscoction, and the chromatic changes which it undergoes -- as though it wished towarn you that its names are as numerous as the colours which it displays -- thenyou may perform the putrefaction, or first coction, which turns our Stone quiteblack. BY this sign you may know that you have the key to our Art, and you will beable to transmute it into the mystic white and red. The Sages say that the Stonedissolves itself, coagulates itself, mortifies itself, and is quickened by its owninherent power, and that it changes itself to black, white, and red, in Christiancharity and fundamental truth.xxxi. BLODIUS. Take the Stone which is found everywhere, and is called Rebis(Two-thing), and grows in two mountains Take it while it is still fresh, with its ownproper blood.

Their salting, dissolving, subliming, growing, pounding, reducing to anacid, and white sulphur, their coction of the fiery vapour, its coagulation, andtransmutation into red sulphur, are nothing but different aspects of one and thesame thing, which, in its first stage, we may describe as incombustible andindestructible sulphur.xxxvi. HERMES: Except ye convert the earth of our Matter into fire, our acid willnot ascend.xxxvii. PYTHAGORAS, in his Fourth Table, says: How wonderful is the agreement ofSages in the midst of difference! They all say that they have prepared the Stoneout of a substance which by the vulgar is looked upon as the vilest thing on earth.Indeed, if we were to tell the vulgar herd the ordinary name of our substance,they would look upon our assertion as a daring falsehood. But if they wereacquainted with its virtue and efficacy, they would not despise that which is, inreality, the most precious thing in the world. God has concealed this mystery fromthe foolish, the ignorant, the wicked, and the scornful, in order that they may notuse it for evil purposes.xxxviii. HAGIENUS: Our Stone is found in all mountains, all trees, all herbs, andanimals, and with all men. It wears many different colours, contains the fourelements, and has been designated a microcosm. Can you not see, you ignorantseekers after the Stone, who try, and vainly try, such a multiplicity of substancesand methods, that our Stone is one earth, and one sulphur, and that it grows inabundance before your very eyes 7 I will tell you where you may find it. The firstspot is on the summit of two mountains; the second, in all mountains; the third,among the refuse in the street; the fourth, in the trees and metals, the liquid ofwhich is the Sun and Moon, Mercury, Saturn, and Jupiter. There is but one vessel,one method, and one consummation.xxxix. MORIENUS: Know that our Matter is not in greater agreement with humannature than with anything else, for it is developed by putrefaction andtransmutation. If it were not decomposed, nothing could be generated out of it.The goal of our Art is not reached until Sun and Moon are conjoined, and become,as it were, one body.xl. THE EMERALD TABLE: It is true, without any error, and it is the sum of truth;that which is above is also that which is below, for the performance of thewonders of a certain one thing, and as all things arise from one Stone, so also theywere generated from one common Substance, which includes the four elementscreated by God.

This explanation is sufficiently plain.xlvii.

Let this be done seven times.For as Naaman the Syrian was purged of his leprosy by washing himself seven timesin Jordan, so our substance must undergo a seven-fold cleansing, by calcining anddissolving, and exhibiting a variety of ever deepening colours.

Be sure that they allwere true Sages, and really possessed our Stone. It may have been possessed bymore persons since the time of Adam, but the above list includes all of whom Ihave heard. I need not here review all their sayings; for the words of the least ofthem are sufficient for imparting to you a knowledge of this Art; and my ambitiongoes no higher than that. If I have enumerated so large a number of authorities, Ihave only done so in order that you might the better understand both the theoryand practice of this Art, and that you might be saved all unnecessary expense. Forthis reason I have declared this true philosophy with all the skill that God has givenme. I hope the initiated will overlook any verbal inaccuracy into which I havefallen, and that they will be induced by my example to abstain from wilfullymisleading anxious enquirers. I may have fallen into some errors of detail, but asto the gist of my work, I know what I have written, And that it is God's own truth.Explanation of the Saying of AdamWhen God had created our first parent Adam, and set him in Paradise, He shewedhim two things, namely, earth and water. Earth is fixed and indestructible, wateris volatile and vaporous. These two contain the elements of all created things:water contains air, and earth fire -- and of these four things the whole of creationis composed. In earth are enclosed fire, stones, minerals, salt, mercury, and allmanner of metals; in water, and in air, all manner of living and organicsubstances, such as beasts, birds, fishes, flesh, blood, bones, wood, trees, flowers,and leaves. To all these things God imparted their efficacy and virtue, andsubjected them to the mastery and use of Adam. Hence you may see how all thesethings are adapted to the human body, and are such as to meet the requirementsof his nature. He may incorporate the virtue of outward substances by assimilatingthem in the form of food. In the same way, his mind is suitably constructed for thepurpose of gaining a rational knowledge of the physical world. That this is thecase, you may see from the first chapter of Genesis.On the sixth day of the first year of the world, that is to say, on the 15th day ofMarch, God created the first man, Adam, of red earth, in a field near Damascus,with a beautiful body, and after His own image. When Adam was created, he stoodnaked before the Lord, and with outstretched hands rendered thanks to Him,saying: O Lord, Thy hands have shaped me: now remember, I pray Thee, the workof Thy hands, which Thou hast clothed with flesh, and strengthened with bones,and grant me life and loving kindness.So the Lord endowed Adam with great wisdom, and such marvellous insight that heimmediately, without the help of any teacher -- simply by virtue of his originalrighteousness -- had a perfect knowledge of the seven liberal arts, and of allanimals, plants, stones, metals and minerals. Nay, what is more, he had perfectunderstanding of the Holy Trinity, and of the coming of Christ in the flesh.The Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (9 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Moreover, Adam was the Lord, King, and Ruler of all other creatures which, at theDivine bidding, were brought to him by the angel to receive their names. Thus allcreatures acknowledged Adam as their Lord, seeing that it was he to whom theproperties and virtues of all things were to be made known. Now the wisdom, andknowledge of all things, which Adam had received, enabled him to observe theproperties, the origin, and the end of all things. He noted the division anddestruction, the birth and decay of physical substances. He saw that they derivetheir origin from the dry and the moist elements, and that they are againtransmuted into the dry and the moist. Of all these things Adam took notice, andespecially of that which is called the first Matter. For he who knows how all thingsare transmuted into their first Matter, has no need to ask any questions. It wasthat which existed in the beginning before God created heaven and earth; and outof it may be made one new thing which did not exist before, a new earth, fire,water, air, Sun, Moon, Stars, in short, a new world.As in the beginning all things were created new, so there is a kind of new creationout of the first substance in our Art. Now although God warned Adam generally notto reveal this first substance -- viz., the moist and the dry elements -- yet Hepermitted him to impart the knowledge to his son Seth. Abel discovered the Art forhimself, by the wisdom which God had given him, and inscribed an account of it onbeechen tablets. He was also the first to discover the art of writing; further, heforetold the destruction of the world by the Flood, and wrote all these things onwooden tablets, and hid them in a pillar of stone, which was found, longafterwards, by the children of Israel Thus you see that our Art was a secret fromthe beginning, and a secret it will remain to the end of the world. For this reasonit is necessary carefully to consider all that is said about it, and especially thewords of the Lord to Adam: for they exhibit in a succinct form the secret of thewhole Art.Explanation of the Saying of AbelThis saying partly explains itself, and is partly explained by what we said aboutGod's words to Adam. Yet I will add a few remarks concerning it. Man hath withinhim the virtue and efficiency of all things, whence he is called a small world, andis compared to the large world, because the bones which are beneath his skin, andsupport his body, may be likened to the mountains and stones, his flesh to theearth, his veins to the rivers, and his small veins to the brooks which aredischarged into them. The heart is the sea into which the great and small riversflow, his hair resembles the growing herbs -- and so with all other parts of hisbody. Again, his inward parts, such as the heart, lungs, and liver, are comparableto the metals. The hairs have their head in the earth (i.e., the flesh) and theirroots in the air, as the Sages say, that the root of their minerals is in the air, andtheir head in the earth. That which ascends by distillation is volatile, and is in theair; that which remains at the bottom, and is fixed, is the head, which is in theearth. Therefore, the one must always exist in conjunction with the other if it is tobe effectual. Hence man may be compared to an inverted tree: for he has hisroots, or his hair, in the air, while other trees have their hairs. or their roots, inthe earth.And of our Stone, too, the Sages have justly said that it has its head in the earth,and its root in the air. This similitude has a two-fold interpretation. First, withregard to the place in which our Matter is found; secondly, with regard to thedissolution and second conjunction of the Stone. For when our Stone rises upwardin the alembic, it has its root in the air; but if it would regain its virtue andThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (10 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"strength, it must once more return to its earth, and then it has its head andperfect potency in the earth. Hence our Stone, too, is not inaptly denominated asmall world; it is called the mountain of mountains, from which our ore is derived,since it is evolved from the first substance in a way analogous to that in which thegreat world was created. Know that if you bury anything in [the] earth, and it rots,as food is digested in the human body, and the gross is separated from the subtle,and that which is fetid from that which is pure, then that which is pure is the firstMatter which has been set free by decay. If you understand this, you know the trueArt. But keep it to yourself, and cast not pearls before swine; for the vulgar regardour Art with ignorant contempt.Explanation of the Saying of Seth, Son of Adam.By \"acid which is to be subjected to coction, and transmuted into ashes, \"the SageSeth means distilled water, which we call seed. If this, by diligent coction, iscondensed into a body -- which he calls ashes -- the body loses its blackness bybeing washed till it becomes white; for, by constant coction, all blackness andgross impurity are removed. If it were not for this earth, the spirit would never becoagulated; for it would have no body into which it could enter -- seeing that itcannot be coagulated and fixed anywhere but in its own body. On the other hand,the spirit purifies its body, as Seth says, and makes it white. He says further: \"Ifyou diligently heat it, and free it from its blackness, it is changed into a Stone,which is called the white coin of the Stone. \"That is to say, if it is slowly heatedwith a gentle fire, it is by degrees changed into a body which resists fire, and isnamed a Stone. It is fixed, and it has a brilliantly white appearance. A coin it iscalled, because, as he who has a coin may purchase with it bread or whatever elsehe needs, so he who has this Stone may purchase for himself health, wisdom,longevity, gold, silver, gems, etc. Hence it is justly called the Coin, since it canbuy what all the riches in the world cannot procure. It is struck By the Sages, who,instead of the image of a prince, impress upon it their own image. Therefore it isdenominated the COIN of the SAGES, because it is their own money, struck in theirown mintAgain, when the Sage says, \"Heat the Stone till it breaks [itself], and dissolve it inthe well-tempered water of the Moon,\" he means that the Stone must be heated bythat which is in itself, until it is changed into water, or dissolved. All this is doneby its own agency; for the body is called Moon, when it has been changed intowater; and the extracted spirit, or distilled water, is called Sun. For the elementof [the] air is concealed in it; but the body must be broken in its own water, ordissolved by itself. The \"well-tempered water of the Moon\" is the gentle inwardheat which changes it into water, and yields two waters, viz., the distilled spirit,and the dissolved body. These two waters are again united by slow and gentlecoction, the distilled spirit becoming coagulated into a body, the dissolved bodybecoming a spirit The fixed becomes volatile, and the volatile fixed, by dissolutionand coagulation, and both assume, first a white, and then a red colour. Thechange to white and red is produced by the same water, and the white is alwaysfollowed by the red, just as the black is followed by the white. When the Sagesays, in conclusion, \"that the whole can be accomplished only with the best acid,through the power of God alone,\" he means that the one thing from which aloneour Stone can be procured may be compared to the sharpest acid and that, bymeans of our Art, this acid is changed into the best of earthly things, which all thetreasures of all kings and princes are not sufficient to buyExplanation of the Saying of IsindrusThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (11 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Good Heavens! How skilfully the Sages have contrived to conceal this matter. Itwould surely have been far better if they had abstained from writing altogether.For the extreme obscurity of their style has overwhelmed thousands in ruin, andplunged them into the deepest poverty, especially those who set about this taskwithout even the slightest knowledge of Nature, or of the requirements of our Art.What the Sages write is strictly true; but you cannot understand it unless you arealready initiated in the secrets of this Art. Yea, even if you were a Doctor of theDoctors, and a Light of the World, you would be able to see no meaning in theirwords without this knowledge. They have written, but you are none the wiser.They half wished to communicate the secret to their posterity; but a jealousfeeling prevented them from doing so in plain language. To the uninitiated readerthese words of Isindrus must appear nothing short of nonsense: \"Great is the air,because the air corrects the thing, if it is thin or thick, hot or cold.\" But the Sagemeans that when it ascends with the water, it is hot air, for fire and air bear ourStone like secret fire concealed therein, and the water which ascends from theearth, by that ascension becomes air, and thin; and when it descends, it descendsinto water which contains fire; thus the earth is purified, seeing that the watertakes [the] fire with it into the earth. For the fire is the Soul, and the Moon theSpirit. Therefore, the air is great, because it bears with it water and fire, andimparts them to all things, though thereby (by this loss of water) itself becomescold. Then the air becomes thick, when with its fire it is transmuted into the body,and thus the air corrects the thing by its thickness. For it bears out our Stone as itcarries it in, and purifies it both in its ascent and in its descent. In the same wayair purifies all things that grow (i.e., plants), gives them their food (i.e., water),and imparts to them its fire, by which they are sustained. Of this you may convinceyourself by ocular demonstration. For the air bears the clouds, and sheds themupon earth in the form of rain; which rain contains secret fire derived from theearth, and the rays of the Sun by which it was drawn upward -- and this fire itgives to all things as food. And although the rays of the Sun and Moon areimmeasurably subtle, swift, and intangible; yet the rays of our Sun and Moon aremuch swifter and more subtle than those which are received by the plants in theirgrowth. For the earth digests the rays of the Sun and Moon, and they sustain in themost wonderful manner things of vegetable growth; and all the living rays of theSun and Moon nourish all created things. For by this digestion they obtain theirlife. For this reason the air may be called great, because through the grace of Godit accomplishes great things.Again, when the Sage says, \"If the air becomes thick,\" i.e., when the Sun turnsaside, or is changed, \"there is a thickness, till it rises,\" he means that if thedistilled water which is taken for the Sun, or fire, approaches its body, and ischanged into it, then the Sun stoops down to the earth. Thereby the air becomesthick, being joined to the earth, and if the Sun is once more elevated the airbecomes thin; that is to say, when the water is extracted from the earth by meansof the alembic, the fire rises upward, i.e., the Sun is exalted, and the air becomesthin. Again, when he says, \"This also is hot and cold, and thickness, and thinness,or softness,\" the Sage means that the Sun is hot, and the Moon cold; for the earth,when dissolved, is the Moon, and water, in which is fire, is the Sun: these twomust be conjoined in an inseparable union. This union enables them to reduce theelements of all metallic and animal bodies, into which they are injected, toperfect purity and health. When the Sage adds that thickness and thinness denotesummer and winter, he means that our Art is mingled of thickness and thinness, ortwo elements which must be united by gentle warmth, like that of winter andsummer combined. This temperate warmth, which resembles that of a bath, bringsThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (12 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the Sun and Moon together. Thus I have, by the grace of God, interpreted to youthe parabolic saying of Isindrus.Explanation of the Saying of Anaxagoras.From the beginning of all things God is. He is likened to light and fire, and He maybe likened to the latter in His essence, because fire is the first principle of allthings that are seen and grow. In the same way, the first principle of our Art isfire. Heat impels Nature to work, and in its working are manifested Body, Spirit,and Soul; that is, earth and water. Earth is the Body, oil the Soul, and water theSpirit; and all this is accomplished through the Divine goodness and lenity, withoutwhich Nature can do nothing; or, as the Sage says: \"God's lenity rules all things;and beneath the thickness of the earth, after creation, are revealed lenity andintegrity.\" That is to say: If the earth is separated from the water, and itselfdissolved into oil and water, the oil is integrity, and the water lenity; for thewater imparts the soul to the oil and to the body, and [the body] receives nothingbut what is imparted to it by heaven, that is, by the water -- and the water isrevealed under the oil, the oil under the earth. For the fire is subtle, and floatsupward from the earth with subtle waters, and is concealed in the earth. Now oiland air and earth are purified by their own spirit Therefore the oil is integrity inthe body, and the spirit lenity. And the spirit in the first operation descends to thebody and restores life to the body; although the oil is pure and remains with thebody, yet it cannot succour the body without the help of the spirit; for the bodysuffers violence and anguish while it is dissolved and purified. Then, again, the\"thickness of the earth\" is transmuted into a thin substance such as water or oil,and thus the \"lenity\" is seen in the body. For the body is so mild or soft as to bechanged into water, or oil, although before it was quite dry. Therefore oil is seenin the earth, which is the fatness or life of the water, i.e., an union of fire, air,and water. Now give the water to the body to drink, and it will be restored to life.And though those three elements have ascended from the earth, yet the virtueremains with the body, as you may see by dissolving it into oil and water. But theoil cannot operate without the spirit, nor can the spirit bear fruit without the oiland the body. Therefore they must be united; and all \"lenity\" and \"integrity\" areseen in the body when it is transmuted to white and red.Explication of the Opinion of Pythagoras.This Sage asks what that is which is touched, and yet not seen. He means that thesubstance which is prepared by our Art is one thing, which is tangible and invisible.That is to say, it is felt, but not seen, nor is the mode of its operation known. Hewho knows it, but knows not its operation, as yet knows nothing as he ought. Thisone thing, which alone is profitable for the purposes of our Art, proceeds from acertain dark place, where it is not seen, nor are its operation or its virtue knownto any but the initiated. A great mystery is also concealed in the Matter itself,namely, air and fire, or the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. This is concealed in it,and yet is invisible, as the Sage says: What is not seen, or known, is only heaven.That which is felt, and not seen, is earth. Earth, says the Sage, is thickness, orbody, which is found at the bottom of the Matter, has accumulated in the Matter,and can be felt and known. By the words, \"that is between heaven and earth,which is not known,\" (ie., in the world), the Sage means that the Matter of ourStone is found in the small world; not in rocks and mountains, or in the earth, butbetween heaven and earth, i.e., in the air. Again, when he says that \"in it aresenses, and entirety, as smell, taste, hearing, touch,\" he would teach us that inhuman nature there is entirety of mind and perception; for man can know, feel,The Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (13 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"and understand. He would also teach us how our Stone is to be found, namely, bysight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. By sight, because the Matter of the Stone isthick, or thin and clear, and turns black, white, and red. By smell, because, whenits impurity is purged away, it emits a most sweet fragrance. By taste, because itis first bitter and disagreeable, but afterwards becomes most pleasant By touch,because that sense enables us to distinguish between the hard and the soft, thegross and the subtle, between water and earth, and between the different stagesof distillation, putrefaction, dissolution, coagulation, fermentation, and injection,which the substance goes through. The different processes of the task areperceived with the senses, and it should be accomplished within forty-six days.Loosening of the Knot of Aristeus\"Take the body which I have shewn you, and beat it into thin leaves,\" i.e., take theearth which cleaves to our substance, and, by having become dry, becomes visibleand knowable; for now it is water and earth. The earth is thus shewn and dividedinto two parts, earth and water. Let that earth be taken, placed in a phial, andput in a warm bath, by the warmth of which it is dissolved, through its owninternal coction, into water; this the Sage calls beating into thin leaves. The bodywhich is thus obtained is variously described as the Philosopher's Stone, or theStone of leaves. \"Add some of our salt water, and this is the water of life.\" Thatmeans: After its dissolution into water, it must receive our salt water to drink, forthis water has been previously distilled from it, and is the water of life; for thesoul and spirit of the body are hidden in it, and it is called our sea water; the samealso is its natural name, because it is obtained from the invisible hidden sea of theSages, the sea of the smaller world. For our Art is called the smaller world, andthus it is the water of our sea. If this water is added to the body, and heated andpurified with it, the body is purged by long coction, and its colour changes fromblack to a brilliant white, while the water is coagulated, and forms, by indissolubleunion with the body, the imperishable Philosopher's Stone, which you must use tothe glory of God, and the good of your neighbour.Exposition of the Sayings of Parmenides.Jealous Sages have named many waters and metals and stones, simply for thepurpose of deceiving you; herein the philosophers would warn us that they haveused secrecy, lest the whole mystery should be manifested before all the world.Those who follow the letter of their directions are sure to be led astray, and tomiss entirely the true foundation of our Art. The fault, however, lies not with theSages so much as with the ignorance of their readers. The Sages name it a stone;and so it is a stone, which is dug up from our mine. They speak of metals, andthere are such things as metals liquefied from our ore. They speak of water; butour water we obtain from our own spring. The red and white sulphur they refer toare obtained from our air. Their salt is obtained from our salt mines. It is our Sun,our verdigris, halonitre, alkali, orpiment, arsenic, our poison, our medicine, etc.By whatever name they call it they cannot make it more than one thing. It isrightly described by all the Sages, but not plainly enough for the uninitiatedenquirer. For such an one knows neither the substance nor its operation. The Sagesays: \"Relinquish Sun, Moon, and Venus for our ore,\" i.e., it is not to be found inany earthly metals, but only in our ore. Whoever rightly understands theconcluding words of the Sage has received a great blessing at the hand of God.Explanation of the Saying of Lucas.The Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (14 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"By the living water of the Moon this Sage means our water, which is twofold. Thedistilled water is the Moon; the Sun, or fire, is hidden in it, and is the Father of allthings. Hence it is compared to a man, because the Sun is in the water. It is alsocalled living water; for the life of the dead body is hidden in the water. It is thewater of the Moon, because the Sun is the Father and the Moon the Mother. Hence,also, they are regarded as husband and wife. The Body is the Moon, or Mother, andthe distilled water, or male principle, rises upward from the earth; and for thatreason is sometimes called Moon. For it is the water of the Moon, or Body. It hasleft the Body, and must enter it again before our Art can be perfected. Hence theBody, or Moon, has well been designated the female principle, and the water, orSun, the male principle, for reasons which have been set forth at length in thisbook.Again, when the Sage says, \"Coagulate it after our fashion,\" those last three wordsmean that the body must receive its spirit to drink gradually, and little by little,until it recovers its life, and health, and strength, which takes place by means ofthe same gentle heat which digests food in the stomach, and matures fruit in itsplace. For it is our custom to eat, drink, and live in gentle warmth. By this regimenour body is preserved, and all that is foul and unprofitable is driven out from ourbody. According to the same fashion of gentle coction, all that is fetid and black isgradually purged out of our Stone. For when the Sage says \"after our fashion,\" hewishes to teach you that the preparation of the Stone bears a strict analogy to theprocesses of the human body. That the chemical development of our substance isinternal, and caused by the operation of Nature and of its four elements, the Sageindicates by the words, \"Everything is already coagulated.\" The substance containsall that is needed; there is nothing to be added or taken away, seeing that it isdissolved and again conjoined by its own inherent properties. When the Sagecontinues, \"I bid you take water of life, which descends from the Moon, and pour itupon our earth till it turns white,\" he means that if water and earth are separatedfrom each other, then the dry body is our earth, and the extracted water is thewater of the Moon, or water of life. This process of adfusion, desiccation,attrition, coagulation, etc., is repeated till the body turns white; and then takesplace on conglutination, which is indissoluble. \"Then,\" as the Sage says, \"we haveour Magnesia, and the Nature of natures rejoices.\" Its spirit and body become onething: they were one thing, and after separation have once more become onething; therefore, one nature rejoices in the restoration of the other.Exposition of the Saying of Ethelius.He says: \"Heat our Stone until it shines like dazzling marble; then it becomesgreat, and a mystic Stone; for sulphur added to sulphur preserves it on account ofits fitness.\" That is to say: When the moist and the dry have been separated, thedry which lies at the bottom, and is called our Stone, is as black as a raven. It mustbe subjected to the coction of our water (separated from it), until it loses itsblackness, and becomes as white as dazzling marble. Then it is the mystic Stonewhich by coction has been transmuted into fixed mercury with the blessing of God.The Stone is mystic, or secret, because it is found in a secret place, in anuniversally despised substance where no one looks for the greatest treasure of theworld. Hence it may well be called The HIDDEN STONE. By the joining of twosulphurs and their mutual preservation, he means that though, after the separationof spirit and body, there seem to be two substances, yet, in reality, there is onlyone substance; so the body which is below is \"sulphur,\" and the spirit which isabove is also \"sulphur.\" Now, when the spirit returns to the body, one sulphur isadded to another; and they are bound together by a mutual fitness, since the bodyThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (15 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"cannot be without the spirit, nor the spirit without the body. Hence there arethese two sulphurs in the body, the red and the white, and the white sulphur is inthe black body, while the red is hid beneath it. If the spirit is gradually added tothe body, it is entirely coagulated into the body, sulphur is added to sulphur, andperfection is attained through the fitness which exists between them. The bodyreceives nothing but its own spirit; for it has retained its soul, and what has beenextracted from a body can be joined to nothing but that same body. The spiritdelights in nothing so much as in its own soul, and its own body. Hence the Sagesays: \"When the spirit has been restored to the body, the sulphur to the sulphur,and the water to the earth, and all has become white, then the body retains thespirit, and there can be no further separation.\"Thus you have the well purgedearth of the Sages, in which we sow our grain, unto infinity, that it may bring forthmuch fruit.Explanation of the Saying of Pythagoras.You have good cause to wonder at the great variety of ways in which the Sageshave expressed the same thing. Nevertheless, their descriptions apply only to oneMatter, and their sayings refer only to a single substance. For when our Sage says,\"We give you directions concerning these things: We tell you that it is dry water,like the water of the Moon, which you have prepared, \"he means that we Sagesmust give directions, according to the best of our ability. If those directions,rightly understood, do not answer the purpose, you may justly charge us with fraudand imposture. But if you fail through not taking our meaning, you must blameyour own unspeakable stupidity, which follows the letter, but not the spirit of ourdirections. When the Sage further says that it must drink its own water, he wouldteach you that after the separation of the dry from the moist, the water extractedfrom the body is the right water, and the water of the Moon, prepared byputrefaction and distillation. This extracted water is regarded as the maleprinciple, and the earth, or body, as the female principle. The water of thehusband must now be joined in conjugal union to that of the wife; the body must,at intervals, drink of its own prepared water, and become ever purer, the more itdrinks, till it turns most wonderfully white. Then it is called \"our calx,\" and youmust pour the water of our calx upon the body, until it is coagulated, becomingtinged, and a most bright quality returns to it, and the body itself is saturated withits own moisture. If you wish to obtain the red tincture, you should dissolve andcoagulate, and go through the whole process over again. Verily, this is God's owntruth, an accurate, simple, and plain statement of the requirements of our Art.Explanation of the Emerald Table of Hermes.Hermes is right in saying that our Art is true, and has been rightly handed down bythe Sages; all doubts concerning it have arisen through false interpretation of themystic language of the philosophers. But, since they are loth to confess their ownignorance, their readers prefer to say that the words of the Sages are impostureand falsehood. The fault really lies with the ignorant reader, who does notunderstand the style of the Philosophers. If, in the interpretation of our books,they would suffer themselves to be guided by the teaching of Nature, rather thanby their own foolish notions, they would not miss the mark so hopelessly. By thewords which follow: \"That which is above is also that which is below,\" he describesthe Matter of our Art, which, though one, is divided into two things, the volatilewater which rises upward, and the earth which lies at the bottom, and becomesfixed. But when the reunion takes place, the body becomes spirit, and the spiritbecomes body, the earth is changed into water and becomes volatile, the water isThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (16 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"transmuted into body, and becomes fixed. When bodies become spirits, and spiritsbodies, your work is finished, for then that which rises upward and that whichdescends downward become one body. Therefore the Sage says that that which isabove is that which is below, meaning that, after having been separated into twosubstances (from being one substance), they are again joined together into onesubstance, i.e., an union which can never be dissolved, and possesses such virtueand efficacy that it can do in one moment what the Sun cannot accomplish in athousand years. And this miracle is wrought by a thing which is despised andrejected by the multitude. Again, the Sage tells us that all things were created,and are still generated, from one first substance and consist of the sameelementary material; and in this first substance God has appointed the fourelements, which represent a common material into which it might perhaps bepossible to resolve all things. Its development is brought about by the distillationof the Sun and Moon. For it is operated upon by the natural heat of the Sun Moon,which stirs up its internal action, and multiplies each thing after its kind,imparting to the substance a specific form. The soul, or nutritive principle, is theearth which receives the rays of the Sun and Moon, and therewith feeds herchildren as with mother's milk. Thus the Sun is the father, the Moon is the mother,the earth the nurse -- and in this substance is that which we require. He who cantake it and prepare it is truly to be envied. It is separated by the Sun and Moon inthe form of a vapour, and collected in the place where it is found. When Hermesadds that \"the air bears it in its womb, the earth is its nurse, the whole world itsFather,\" he means that when the substance of our Stone is dissolved, then thewind bears it in its womb, i.e., the air bears up the substance in the form ofwater, in which is hid fire, the soul of the Stone, and fire is the Father of thewhole world. Thus, the volatile substance rises upward, while that which remainsat the bottom, is the \"whole world\" (seeing that our Art is compared to a \"smallworld \"). Hence Hermes calls fire the father of the whole world, because it is theSun of our Art, and air, Moon, and water ascend from it; the earth is the nurse ofthe Stone, i.e., when the earth receives the rays of the Sun and Moon, a new bodyis born, like a new foetus in the mother's womb. The earth receives and digests thelight of Sun and Moon, and imparts food to its foetus day by day, till it becomesgreat and strong, and puts off its blackness and defilement, and is changed to adifferent colour. This, \"child,\"which is called \"our daughter,\" represents our Stone,which is born anew of the Sun and Moon, as you may easily see, when the spirit, orthe water that ascended, is gradually transmuted into the body, and the body isborn anew, and grows and increases in size like the foetus in the mother's womb.Thus the Stone is generated from the first substance, which contains the fourelements; it is brought forth by two things, the body and the spirit; the wind bearsit in its womb, for it carries the Stone upward from earth to heaven, and downagain from heaven to earth. Thus the Stone receives increase from above and frombelow, and is born a second time, just as every other foetus is generated in thematernal womb; as all created things bring forth their young, even so does the air,or wind, bring forth our Stone. When Hermes adds, \"Its power, or virtue, is entire,when it is transmuted into earth,\" he means that when the spirit is transmuted intothe body, it receives its full strength and virtue. For as yet the spirit is volatile,and not fixed, or permanent. If it is to be fixed, we must proceed as the bakerdoes in baking bread. We must impart only a little of the spirit to the body at atime, just as the baker only puts a little leaven to his meal, and with it leavens thewhole lump. The spirit, which is our leaven, in like fashion transmutes the wholebody into its own substance. Therefore the body must be leavened again andagain, until the whole lump is thoroughly pervaded with the power of the leaven.In our Art the body leavens the spirit, and transmutes it into one body, and theThe Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (17 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"spirit leavens the body, and transmutes it into one spirit And the two, when theyhave become one, receive power to leaven all things, into which they are injected,with their own virtue.The Sage continues: \"If you gently separate the earth from the water, the subtlefrom the hard, the Stone ascends from earth to heaven, and again descends fromheaven to earth, and receives its virtue from above and from below. By thisprocess you obtain the glory and brightness of the whole world. With it you can putto flight poverty, disease, and weariness; for it overcomes the subtle mercury, andpenetrates all hard and firm bodies.\" He means that all who would accomplish thistask must separate the moist from the dry, the water from the earth. The water,or fire, being subtle, ascends, while the body is hard, and remains where it is. Theseparation must be accomplished by gentle heat, i.e., in the temperate bath ofthe Sages, which acts slowly, and is neither too hot nor too cold. Then the Stoneascends to heaven, and again descends from heaven to earth. The spirit and bodyare first separated, then again joined together by gentle coction, of a temperatureresembling that with which a hen hatches her eggs. Such is the preparation of thesubstance, which is worth the whole world, whence it is also called a \"little world.\"The possession of the Stone will yield you the greatest delight, and unspeakablyprecious comfort. It will also set forth to you in a typical form the creation of theworld. It will enable you to cast out all disease from the human body, to driveaway poverty, and to have a good understanding of the secrets of Nature. TheStone has virtue to transmute mercury into gold and silver, and to penetrate allhard and firm bodies, such as precious stones and metals. You cannot ask a bettergift of God than this gift, which is greater than all other gifts. Hence Hermes mayjustly call himself by the proud title of \"Hermes Trismegistus, who holds the threeparts of the whole world of wisdom.\"Next: The Glory of the World (part 4)The Glory of the World (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory3.htm (18 of 18) [27/05/2004 23:02:06]"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Glory of the World (part 4)Another Tract,Corresponding To The First, Which May Be Read WithGreat Profit.Preface.We may justly wonder that the Sages who have written about this most preciousand secret Art, have thought it necessary to invent so many occult and allegoricalexpressions, by means of which our Art is concealed not only from the unworthybut from earnest and diligent students of the truth. Foolish persons, indeed, whoread their books, and hear of the riches and all the other good things which thisArt affords, experience a pleasant tickling sensation in their ears, and straightwaybehold visions of themselves sitting on golden thrones, and commanding all thetreasures of the universe, they fancy that the Art can be learned in the twinklingof an eye, soon come to regard themselves as great Doctors, and are unable toconceive the possibility of their making a mistake, or being led astray by theSages, much less are they aware that it has always been the custom of thephilosophers to conceal the fundamental facts of this Art and to reveal them totheir own sons and disciples only in sententious allegorical sayings. It is impossibleto read through all that the Sages have ever written on this subject; but it is a stillmore hopeless undertaking to gather from their books a full and sufficientknowledge of our Art, unless, indeed, God opens your understanding, and gives youa real insight into the natural properties of things, and thereby into the sayings ofthose who speak of them. For it is Nature alone that accomplishes the variousprocesses of our Art, and a right understanding of Nature will furnish you with eyeswherewith to perceive the secrets thereof. Thus Bason says: \"Take care not to addanything else; for it is the property of our substance to overcome all other things.\"And Bondinus tells us that the whole process is accomplished by means of thewater which issues from the Stone. Alphidius declares that the Philosopher's Stonecontains four different natures, and thereby possesses a virtue and efficacy such asare found in no other stone. Therefore, the question of the Royal Sage Haly,whether there is another stone upon earth which may be compared with our Stone,and possesses the same wonderful properties, is answered by Morienus in thefollowing words: \"I am aware of no other stone of equal excellence, potency, andvirtue, for it contains the four elements in a visible form, and is singular of its kindamong all the created things of the world. If, therefore, any person should takeany [other] Stone but the one demanded by this Magistery, his labours must resultin failure.\" Moreover, the ancient Sage Arros says: \"Our Stone is useless for ourpurpose, until it be purged of its gross earth.\" In like manner we are informed byMorienus that unless the body be purged of its grossness, it cannot be united to itsspirit; but when it has put off its gross nature, the spirit joins itself to it, anddelights in it, because both have been freed from all impurity.\" The truth of hisThe Glory of the World (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory4.htm (1 of 7) [27/05/2004 23:02:07]"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"words is attested by Ascanius in \"The Crowd,\" who says: \"Spirits cannot jointhemselves to impure bodies; but when the body has been well purged, anddigested by coction, the spirit becomes united to it, amidst a phenomenalexhibition of all the colours in the world, and the imperfect body is tinged with theindestructible colour of the ferment; this ferment is the soul, in and through whichthe spirit is joined to the body, and transmuted with the body into the colour ofthe ferment, whereupon all three become one thing.\" Hence it is well, thoughsomewhat enigmatically said by the Sages, that there takes place a conjugal unionof husband and wife, and that of the two a child is born after their likeness, just asmen generate men, metals metals, and all other things that which is like them.Hence all that would exercise this Art must know the properties of the most noblesubstance thereof, and follow the guidance of Nature. But many enquirers conducttheir operations at haphazard, they grope in the dark, and do not know whethertheir art be an imitation of Nature, or not. Yet they undertake to correct, andintensify, the operation of Nature. Of such persons Arnold says that they approachour Art as the ass goes up to the crib, not knowing for what it opens its mouth. Forthey do not know what they would do, nor are they aware that they must listen tothe teaching of Nature. They seek to do the works of Nature, but they will notwatch the hand of her whom they pretend to imitate. Yet our Art has a truefoundation in natural fact. For Nature prepares the metals in the earth, someperfect, like gold and silver; others imperfect, like Venus, Mars, Saturn, andJupiter, according to the labour and influence of the planets. He, then, who wouldaccomplish our Magistery, and desires to participate in this most noble Art, mustknow the seed from which the metals are naturally generated in the earth, whichseed we remove by Nature, and purify and prepare it by Art, making it so glorious,and full of wonderful potency, that with it we can impart instant purity andperfection to the imperfect bodies of men and metals. This seed we must extractfrom perfect, pure, and mature bodies, if we would attain the desired end. Now,in order that you may the more readily attain this knowledge, I have composed thefollowing Tract concerning the first principle of Nature, and the creation andgeneration of man -- which the student of our Magistery should diligently peruse,consider, and digest. Then he will not so easily miss the right path.The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of WisdomAll true Sages and philosophers have earnestly sought to obtain a knowledge ofAlmighty God as He is revealed in His marvellous works; this knowledge theyattained, in so far as it can be attained by the human mind, by diligentlyconsidering the origin and first principles of all things. For they were enabled torealize the omnipotence of the Creator by the contemplation of the secret powers,and miraculous virtues, which He has infused into natural things. They were led toconsider how they might employ their knowledge for the good of the human race,and how they might reveal it to others, and they received wisdom to expound thefirst principles of natural things, but more especially the birth and death of man,in something like the following way: In the beginning God created all things out ofa subtle liquid, or impalpable vapour which was neither moist, nor dry, nor cold,nor hot, nor light, nor dark, but a confused chaos. This subtle vapour God firstchanged into water, which He then separated into a hard and a liquid part, or intoearth and water. Out of elementary water He further evolved air, and out ofelementary earth He brought forth fire, that is, elementary fire. And it may still beseen that the two first elements contain the two last; for daily experience teachesus that in water there is air, and that in earth there is fire. Out of these Godcreated the firmament, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, and all other naturalThe Glory of the World (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory4.htm (2 of 7) [27/05/2004 23:02:07]"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"objects. At last He created a being in His own image, which He formed out ofmoist earth -- i.e., for the most part out of earth (which encloses fire) moistenedwith water (containing air). Hence it is said that man was created out of the fourelements, and he is called a \"small world.\" But man lay like one dead upon theground, until God breathed into his nostrils the spirit of life, and Adam became aliving soul. In like manner God created all other animals, and all plants andminerals, out of the four elements. Then God set Adam in the Garden of Eden, inParadise, which He had planted with His own hands, and in which flourished allmanner of flowers, fruit, roots, herbs, leaves, and grass. Then Adam's heart wasfilled with joy, and he understood the great power of his Creator, and praised andmagnified Him with his lips; at that time he suffered no lack of any thing, havingall that his heart desired, and he was appointed lord of all other creatures.Therefore, the eternal Creator bade the holy angels bring every other living beingto Adam, that all might acknowledge him as their lord, and that Adam might giveto each one its own name, and distinguish one from the other.Now when God beheld the animals walking about in Paradise, each with its ownmate (except Adam, for whom no mate was found); when God saw themapproaching him, and yet eager to flee from him, because of the reverence andawe with which he inspired them -- God said: \"It is not good for man to be alone \";therefore He caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and taking one of his ribs, notfar from his heart, He formed it into a beautiful woman. This woman God broughtunto the man, calling her Eve, and gave her to him for a wife, that he mightprotect her, that she might obey him, and that they might be fruitful and multiply.The Glory and Excellence of Adam.God had appointed that Adam and Eve should spend a thousand years in Paradise,and then be translated, body and soul, to the Eternal Life of Heaven; the sameglorious destiny was in reserve for their posterity. For as yet man was pure, good,and sinless, and not subject or liable to any kind of distemper or sickness. He wasacceptable and perfect in the sight of His Creator, who had made him in His ownimage, and given him all the produce of Paradise to eat, except the fruit of theTree of Knowledge, from which he was to abstain on pain of eternal punishment,both bodily and spiritual. But when he gave ear to the seducing words of the EvilOne, and ate the forbidden fruit, he straightway became poor and wretched,perceived his own nakedness, and concealed himself amongst the trees of thegarden. He had deserved eternal death, and it would have fallen upon him, if theSon of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, had not promised to givesatisfaction for him. Yet in this world God punished Adam with a heavy yoke ofwretchedness, tribulation, poverty, and disease, followed by the bitter agony ofdeath. He also drove him forth from Paradise, and laid a heavy curse upon theground, that thenceforward it should not bring forth fruit of its own accord, butthat it should bear thorns and thistles. Now, when Adam found himself in the midstof a wild and uncultivated earth, compelled to gain his bread by tilling the field inthe sweat of his brow, and to endure much suffering, care, and anxiety, he beganto think seriously of what he had done to provoke the wrath of God, to experiencedeep sorrow for his grievous sin, and to implore God's gracious mercy andforgiveness. His prayers appeased the paternal heart of God, and induced Him toease the grievous yoke laid upon Adam. The central fact of his punishment,however, remained, and death, though deferred, at length overtook him. But, as Isay, God mitigated the punishment of Adam, and took away from his neck thegrievous yoke of suffering, by shewing him the means of warding off the strokes ofimpending calamity. For this purpose the natural properties of things wereThe Glory of the World (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory4.htm (3 of 7) [27/05/2004 23:02:07]"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"revealed to Adam by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; and he was taught toprepare medicines out of herbs, stones, and metals, wherewith he might alleviatehis hard lot, ward off disease, and keep his body in good health until the end of hisdays, which, however, was known to God alone. For, although from the verybeginning Adam had a clear insight into the working of the natural world, thegreatest of all secrets was still hidden from him, till God one day called him intoParadise, and set forth to him this marvellous mystery -- the mystery of our Stone-- in the following words:\"Behold, Adam, here are two things, the one fixed and immutable, the othervolatile and inconstant. The great virtue and potency that slumber in them youmust not reveal to all your sons. For I created them for a special purpose, which Iwill now no longer conceal from you.\" Now, when Adam had learned the mysteryout of God's own mouth, he kept it a strict secret from all his sons, until at length,towards the close of his life, he obtained leave from God to make the preparationof the Stone known to his son Seth. Unless Adam had possessed the knowledge ofthis great mystery he would not have been able to prolong his life to the age of300 (let alone 900) years. For he was never for a moment free from an agonizingsense of his guilt, and of the terrible evils which he had, by his disobedience,brought upon himself and his posterity, who, through his fault, were one and allinvolved in the condemnation of eternal death. If we consider this, it must appearamazing that Adam could keep alive even so long as a single year after his fall; andwe thereby clearly perceive (from the fact that he attained to so great a length ofdays) that the goodness of God must have furnished him with some life-preservingremedy. If Adam had not possessed our Medicine, or Tincture, he could not haveborne up under so much tribulation, anxiety, wretched ness, grief, sorrow, anddisease. But against all these ills he used our Medicine, which preserved his limbsand his strength from decay, braced his faculties, comforted his heart, refreshedhis spirit, relieved his anxiety, fortified his mortal body against all manner ofdisease, and, in short, guarded him from all evil until the last hour of his life.At length, however, Adam found that the Remedy had no longer any power tostrengthen him, or to prolong his life. So he began to consider his end, refrainedfrom applying the Medicine any more, threw himself upon the mercy of God, andsent his son Seth (to whom he had confided the secret), to she gate of Paradise, todemand some of the fruit of the Tree of Life. His request was denied him,whereupon he returned, and carried back to his father the answer of the Angel. Itwas heavy news for Adam, who now felt that his end was approaching, andtherefore sent Seth a second time to fetch the oil of mercy. Before he couldreturn, Adam died; but, at the bidding of God, Seth obtained from the Angel someolive stones from the Tree of the Oil of Mercy, and planted them on his father'sgrave, where they grew into the tree from which the Cross of our BlessedRedeemer was made. Thus, though in a carnal sense the Oil was denied to Adam,and brought him no surcease from temporal death; yet, in a spiritual sense, it wasfreely given to him and obtained for him and all his offspring eternal life, and free,gracious, and merciful forgiveness of all their sins, concerning which God promisedthat He would remember them no more.Thus, through the Heavenly Tree of Life, God fulfilled the prayer of our firstparent Adam, and granted his request in a way which he had not looked for; andhe now tastes the joy which is at the right hand of God, and is for ever removedfrom the hostile power of hunger, thirst, heat, cold, death, and all the other evilswhich flesh is heir to.

If, therefore, a man would be perfectlyhappy in this world, and in the world to come, he should earnestly and devoutlystrive to become possessed of these two Remedies; and for this purpose, he shouldturn to God with his whole heart, and ask for His gracious help, without whichneither can be obtained; and, above all, he should be most eager to receive thatRemedy by which the soul is healed of the mortal disease of sin.This is the true fountain of the Sages; and there is nothing like it upon earth, butone eternal thing, by which the mortal body may, in this vale of tears, be fortifiedagainst all accidental disease, shielded from the pangs of poverty, and renderedsound, healthy, and strong, being protected against all mischances to the veryend; and by which also metallic bodies may. be changed into gold through aquickening of the process which Nature uses in the heart of the earth. Thepreparation and effects of this Stone are not unjustly considered to bear a closeanalogy to the creation of the world; therefore, I thought well to give an accountof it from the very beginning.I will now proceed briefly to expound my view of this Art, which, as all Sagestestify, corresponds most closely to the creation and generation of man. I willattempt to make my meaning as plain as I dare, for the glory of the Holy Trinity,and the good of all Christian believers. When God had created the world, andadorned it with all manner of green things, herbs, roots, leaves, flowers, grass,and also with animals and minerals, he blessed them, and appointed thateverything should bring forth fruit and seed after its kind. Only Adam (who is ourMatter) was not yet in a position to produce any fruit out of himself. Before hecould propagate his species, it was necessary that a part of him should be takenaway, and again joined to him, i.e., his wife Eve. Hereunto we must understandthat so long as our substance is still gross and undivided, it can produce no fruit Itmust first be divided, the subtle from the gross, or the water from the earth. Thewater is Eve, or the spirit; the earth Adam, or the body. And as the male is uselessfor purposes of generation until it be united to the female, so our earth is dead tillit is quickened by the union with water. This is what that ancient Sage, Hermes,means when he says that the dead must be raised to life, and the feeble madestrong.It is necessary, then, to unite body and soul, and to change that which is belowinto that which is above, i.e., body into spirit, and spirit into body. By thisexpression you are to understand not that the spirit by itself is changed into abody, or that the body by itself is changed into a spirit, but that both are united,and that the spirit, or water, dissolves, or resuscitates the body, or earth, whilethe body attracts the spirit, or water; and that they are thus joined into onesubstance, the earth being softened by the water, and the water hardened by theearth -- as the boys in the street pour water on dry dust, and knead the whole intoone mass. For this reason the Sages call our process child's play, in which the deathof one is the life of the other, i.e., in which the hardness of the one is softened bythe other, and vice versa, seeing that the two are nothing but body and spiritoriginally belonging together. When contemplating this union, the Sage, Hermes,bursts forth into the following exclamation: \"Oh, how strong, victorious, andThe Glory of the World (part 4)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/glory4.htm (5 of 7) [27/05/2004 23:02:07]"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"precious is this nature that so unspeakably comforts its supplementary nature!\"This nature is water, which stirs up and quickens the nature of the body. Hence itis said that Adam, or the body, would be dead without Eve, the spirit; for whenthe water has been distilled from our substance. the body lies dead and barren atthe bottom of the alembic, and is described by the Sages as being, after the loss ofits spirit, black, poisonous, and deadly. If the body is to be resuscitated, it must berendered fit for generation by being purged of its blackness and fetid smell, andthen its sweat or spirit must be restored to it; the spirit cannot conceive unless thebody be allowed to embrace its Eve, or spirit. Senior says that the higher vapourmust be brought back to the lower vapour; the Divine water is the King thatdescends from heaven, and leads the soul back to its body which is therebyquickened from the dead. Observe that in the body there is hidden fixed salt,which slumbers there just as the male seed slumbered in Adam. This the spirit, orEve, attracts, and thus becomes pregnant; that is to say: The seed of the body,which we call fixed salt, is extracted from the body by its own water (which hasbefore been separated from it), and is rendered so subtle and volatile that itascends with the spirit to heaven. Then we say that the fixed has become volatile,that the dead has been revived, and that the body has received life from its spirit.On this account the water is called by some Sages the living water of the man,since it is extracted from the body, or man; and Lucas enjoins us to take it, andheat it after the fashion of Nature. Other Sages call the body the \"black soil,\"because in it the fixed salt is concealed from view, like the seed in the ground.Others, again, call it the \"black raven,\" which has in its maw the \"white dove\"; andthe water which is distilled from the body they call the \"virgin's milk,\" -- by whichthe white dove must be brought forth from the black raven. In short, these thingsare described by the Sages under a great variety of names; but the meaning ofthose names is the same. In this fashion the water is embraced by the body andthe seed of the body, or the fixed salt, makes the water pregnant. For the waterdissolves the body, and bears upward with it some particles of the fixed salt; andthe oftener this process is repeated, the thicker does the water become. Hencethe repetition of the process is a most important point Hermes says that when hesaw the water gradually grow thicker and harder, he rejoiced, for thereby he knewthat he should find what he sought. The water, then, must be poured upon thebody, and heated with it, till the body is dissolved, and then again extracted tillthe body is coagulated. Thus the body must be well broken up, and purified bywashing. This process of affusion and extraction must be repeated until all thesalt, or potency and efficacy, has been extracted from the body. This is the casewhen the water becomes white and thick, and, in the cold, hard and solid like ice,while in the heat it melts like butter. Now, when nothing more can be extractedfrom the body, the residuum must be removed; for it is the superfluous part of thesubstance. This is what the Sages mean when they say: In the preparation weremove that which is superfluous; but otherwise our whole Magistery isaccomplished with one single substance, nothing being added, and nothing takenaway, except that which is really superfluous; for it possesses in abundance allthat is needed, namely, the water, or \"white, flaky earth,\" which must be injectedinto \"living mercury;\" that so the transmutation into good and fixed silver may takeplace. But something much more noble and precious is concealed in this water(fixed salt), which grows and grows like the infant in the mother's womb. For asthe embryo in the matrix, which is first a mere seed, grows, and is graduallytransmuted into flesh and blood, ie., into a thicker substance, till at length thelimbs are formed; so this water grows from the white colour which distinguishes itat first, till it is changed to another colour. (For the embryo, too, is transmutedfrom the natural colour of the embryo into flesh and blood.)

Nor do we need anything else, except,as Morienus says, time and patience. This coagulated water is the \"white, flakyearth,\" in which the Sage bids us sow our gold and silver that they may bear fruit ahundred-thousand-fold. This is the \"clear spring\" of the Count of Trevisa, in whichthe King bathes, though not assisted by any of his ministers, who only watch hisclothes until he has dried up the whole spring, when he makes all his ministerslords and kings such as he was at the time of his entering the bath. But now theKing's dignity is three times as great as it was before; he wears a three-fold diademon his head, and is arrayed in garments that shine like carbuncles and amethysts,and beneath them he wears the tunic of purity, and is bound with the girdle ofrighteousness. He is the most glorious King of life, whose power transcends allhuman thought At his side is seated his pure and chaste queen, sprung of his ownseed; and of these two are born many royal children. The redness is concealed andpreserved in the whiteness, which must not be extracted, but subjected to gentlecoction until its full crimson glory flames forth This whiteness is thus referred to in\"The Crowd\": \"If you see that after the blackness there follows a whiteness, be surethat after the whiteness will come a redness: for the redness slumbers in thewhiteness, and should not be extracted, but gently heated, until the whole turnsred.\" Let what I have now said suffice you.Hermes [says]:You must have a good knowledge of the True Principle of both Natural andArtificial Substances.

Their specific properties aredetermined by the outward and inward influences of the stars and planets, (suchas the Sun, the Moon, Etc.) and of the four qualities of the elements. From thesecombined circumstances arise the peculiar forms, and proper substances, of allgrowing, fixed, and generating things, according to the natural order appointed bythe Most High at the beginning of the world. The metals, then, derive their originfrom the earth, and are specifically compounded of the four qualities, or theproperties of the four elements, their peculiar metallic character is stamped uponthem by the influences of the stars and planets. So we are informed by Aristotle inthe fourth book of his Meteor., where he says that quicksilver is the commonsubstance of all metals. The first thing in Nature, as we said before, is thesubstance which represents a particular conglomeration of the four elementswhich the Sages call Mercury or quicksilver But this quicksilver is as yet imperfect,on account of its gross and earthy sulphureous nature, which renders it too easilycombustible, and on account of its superfluous watery elements, which have allbeen collected together out of the four elements by the action of the heavenlyplanets. This substance is composed of a hot sulphureous earth, and a wateryessence, in such a way that the sages have called it imperfect sulphur.Now, since Nature is always striving to attain perfection and to reach the goal setbefore her by the Creator of all things, she is continually at work upon thequalities of the four elements of each substance; and so stirs up and rouses theinward action of the elements by the accidental heat of the Sun, and by naturalwarmth that there arises a kind of vapour or steam in the veins of the earth. Thisvapour cannot make its way out, but is closed in; in penetrating through fat,A Tract of Great Pricehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/greatprc.htm (1 of 8) [27/05/2004 23:02:08]"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"earthy, oily, and impure sulphureous substances it attracts to itself more or less ofthese foreign and external impurities. This is the reason that there are seen in it sogreat a variety of colours before it attains to purity and its own proper colour.Those mineral and metallic substances which contain the largest proportion ofefficacious sulphureous and mercurial vapour are the best; and each quality of thefour elements has its own peculiar operation and transmuting influence in such aconglomeration of various substances -- their action being roused by the sulphur ofthe earth and the outward heat of the Sun. Through these agencies the Matter isoften dissolved and coagulated, till that which is pure, or impure, is borne upward;and this is the work not of a few years, but of a great length of time. Nature has topurge away the peculiar characteristics of all other metals before she can makegold; as you may see by the fact that different kinds of metal are found in thesame metallic vein. This fact may be explained in the following manner. When thesulphureous and mercurial vapours ascend they are mixed, and united by coction,with the aforesaid substance. If those sulphureous vapours are earthy thick, andimpure, and the heat of the Sun, or their own natural heat, have too sudden andviolent an effect, the substance hardens, with all its sulphureous impurities beforeit can be purged of its grossness, and it becomes more like metallic sulphur. If thequicksilver is hardened, the whole mass takes the form of some metal, accordingto the influence of the particular planet with which it is penetrated. For Naturefirst combines the four elements into some substance or body, which then receivesits specific properties through the influence of some planet. Such is the origin ofcopper, tin, lead, iron, and quicksilver. But it is not essential that I should heredescribe at length the specific composition and distinctive properties of each ofthe imperfect metals; they are all mingled in various proportions of impure sulphurand inefficacious quicksilver. Nature, as I said, is ceaselessly at work upon theseimperfect metals purging and separating the pure quicksilver from the impure, andthe pure sulphur from the impure, until all their grossness is removed and theybecome what God designed that they should be, viz., gold. But if these vapoursfloat upward in their original pure condition, with their inward pure and subtleearth, without becoming mixed with gross, earthy, and sulphureous alloy, and ifthey succeed in breaking forth into the open air before they become hardened intoa sulphureous mass, they remain quicksilver and are not changed into any metal.If, however, this pure quicksilver floats upward in a pure mineral earth, withoutany gross alloy, it is hardened into the pure and white sulphur of Nature by beingsubjected to a very moderate degree of gentle heat, and at length assumes thespecific form of silver. Like all the other metals it may still be developed into goldif it remain under the influence of its natural heat. But if the same pure, unalloyedquicksilver be subjected to a higher degree of natural heat, it is transmuted intothe pure red sulphur of Nature and becomes gold without first passing through thestage of silver. In this form it remains, because gold is the highest possible stage ofmetallic development.Quicksilver is the mother of all metals, on account of its coldness and moistness;and if it be once purified and cleansed of all foreign matter it cannot be mixed anymore with grossness of any kind neither can it be changed back into an imperfectmetal. For Nature does not undo her work, and that which has once becomeperfectly pure can never become impure again. Sulphur on the other hand is thefather of all metals, on account of its heat and dryness. In the following chapterwe shall refer to this difference, and speak more in detail about quicksilver.Chapter IIA Tract of Great Pricehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/greatprc.htm (2 of 8) [27/05/2004 23:02:08]"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"There is, then, in all metals true mercury and good sulphur in the imperfect aswell as in the perfect metals. But in the imperfect metals it is defiled with impurematter and stands in need of maturing. Hence you see that all metals may bechanged into gold and silver, if the golden and silver properties that are in thembe freed from all alloy and reduced by gentle heat to the form of silver or gold.Those metals, indeed, which have been torn up by the roots, that is to say, thathave been dug up from their own proper soil in the veins of the earth, can nolonger proceed in that course of development which they pursued in their nativeabode; yet, as much as in them lies, they strive to be perfected. Now the Spirit ofTruth, who imparts all true knowledge, has taught the Sages a Medicine or Form,by which all the impurities of the imperfect metals may be removed, and theperfect nature, or true mercury, which is in them, transmuted into gold and silver.Chapter IIIBut we must now proceed to say a few words about the method of preparing thisMedicine, by which the imperfection is removed from imperfect metals throughthe mediation of perfect mercury, and the mode of gold and silver is developed inthem.I find that the writings of the Sages are all about gold, silver and quicksilver, whichit is said must be reduced to the form which they wore before they becamemetals; that is to say, the form which they wore perhaps some thousands of yearsago. But the operation of Nature is progressive, not retrogressive. Hence it is agreat mistake to suppose that the work of Nature can be reversed by dissolution inaqua fortis or by the amalgamation of gold or silver and quicksilver. For if themetal be plunged in a solvent, if water be distilled from it, or if quicksilver besublimed from it, it still remains the same metal that it was before. The specificproperties of a metal cannot be destroyed so as to obtain the first substance. YetAristotle says that metals cannot be changed unless they are reduced to theiroriginal substance.Chapter IVWhat we have said in the last chapter shows that Alchemical Art cannot beconcerned with the subjecting of gold, silver or quicksilver to chemical processes.Nevertheless, that which you read in the books of the Sages is most true and weshall see in the following pages in what sense it is to be understood, that our Art isin gold, silver and quicksilver. But it is clear that our art can make no use ofquicksilver such as may be obtained from the metals by means of any kind ofartificial process, such as dissolution in aqua fortis, or amalgamation or any othermethod of chemical purification.If then, this is not the right substance or original mercury, it is clear that it is notto be found in the metals. For even if you melt two, three, or four metalstogether, yet not one of them can give the others any aid towards attainingperfection, seeing that itself stands in need of external aid. And even though youmix some imperfect metal with gold, the gold will not give up its own perfectionfor the purpose of succouring the other for it has nothing to spare which it mightimpart to the imperfect metal. And even if the imperfect metal could assume thevirtue and efficacy of the gold, it could only do so at the expense of the golditself. In vain, then, shall we seek in metals the Medicine which has power toliberate the perfect mercury contained in imperfect metals.A Tract of Great Pricehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/greatprc.htm (3 of 8) [27/05/2004 23:02:08]"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Chapter VAgain, we read in the books of the Sages that quicksilver and mercury are theoriginal substance of all metals. These words are true in a certain sense. But bymany beginners they are supposed to mean ordinary quicksilver. Such aninterpretation, however, makes nonsense of the dictum of the Sages. For ordinaryquicksilver is an imperfect metal and itself derived from the original substance ofall metals. The Sages, indeed, say little about the origin of their mercury but thatis exactly because they use the name of mercury or sulphur, for the first substanceof their perfect metals. If common mercury were not a metal, there would be nometal corresponding to the celestial influence of the planet Mercury as gold andsilver receive their specific properties from the influence of the Sun and Moon.Now, as it is one of the metals the other metals cannot be derived from it, muchless can their properties be derived from it or from themselves, although the realperfect mercury is quite as abundant in mercury as in any other metal. Nor cancommon sulphur be the first substance of the metals, for no metal contains somuch impurity as common sulphur; and if it be mixed with any metal, that metalbecomes even more impure than it was before, and is even partially, or wholly,corroded.Chapter VIAgain, the Sages affirm that quicksilver, or mercury, is the spirit of the specificnature of metals, collected out of the four elements by the influence of thePlanets, and the operation of Nature in the earth -- and that from it is developedeither gold, silver, or some other of seven metals, according to the peculiareffects of the predominant planetary influence.Hence ignorant alchemists have supposed that all this is true of the commonquicksilver, because it amalgamates with all metals, and is soft and volatile. Butwhy should its volatile properties prove it to be no metal? According to thisdefinition, we might deny the metallic character of tin, lead, and other metals,because they do not remain fixed in a fierce fire -- though one can stand a greaterdegree of heat than another. If, again, any substance is to be called the firstsubstance of metals because of the facility with which it amalgamates with them,copper would have a better claim to be so regarded, since it enters into a closerunion with gold and silver than mercury, and shares both their fusible andmalleable nature. But that is no final union, for it admits of separation; andquicksilver may, with the greatest ease, be separated from the metals with whichit has amalgamated. A true union of metals can only take place in the originalsubstance which is common to all. We do find amalgams of three or even moremetals; but then this union was consummated in the first substance, which is one,and the whole amalgam would have been developed into gold, if its natural growthhad not been retarded by gross, sulphureous, arsenical, and earthy impurity, whichis found among metals when purified. The metals which we dig up out of the earthare, as it were, torn up by the roots, and, their growth having come to a standstill,they can undergo no further development into gold, but must always retain theirpresent form, unless something is done for them by our Art. Hence we must beginat the point where Nature had to leave off: we must purge away all impurity, andthe sulphureous alloy, as Nature herself would have done if her operation had notbeen accidentally or violently, disturbed. She would have matured the originalsubstance, and brought it to perfection by gentle heat, and, in a longer or shorterperiod of time, she would have transmuted it into gold.

And this is the form of gold,highest and best of all that belong to the metallic mode. If, then the purest formof this substance which it is possible for Art to prepare with the help of Nature, beadded to the imperfect metals then it overcomes what is impure in these, for it isnot the impure, but the pure matter which is like unto it. But you must notsuppose that this power belongs to common gold; common gold has its own specificform, which it is unable to impart to other metals. The power of gold is sufficientonly for preserving its own excellence; but our prepared substance is much betterand more honourable than gold, and has power to do that which gold cannot do,viz, to change the common matter of all metals into gold.Chapter VIIIFrom what I have hitherto said, one ignorant of alchemy might suppose that theteaching of the Sages is altogether false and untrustworthy. Therefore I must nowproceed to tell you how it may truly be affirmed that our Art is concerned withquicksilver silver, and gold, or with quicksilver and sulphur, and in what sensemercury is the spirit of the metals. I will first speak about quicksilver, and at oncepremise that this word is not here taken to mean that common quicksilver which isone of the metals, but the first substance of all the metals, and itself no specificmetal at all. For a metal must have derived its distinctive properties throughplanetary influences; nor can any one metal be the first substance of all metals.This quicksilver is neither too hot, nor too cold, nor too moist, nor too dry; but it isa well-termpered mingling of all four. When perfectly matured quicksilver issubjected to external heat, operating thereon, it is not burned but escapes in avolatile essence. Hence it may well be called by the philosophers a spirit, or aswift, and winged, and indestructible soul.So long as it is palpable and visible it is also called body; when subjected toexternal cold it is congealed into a fixed body, and then these three, body, soul,and spirit, are one thing, and contain the properties of all the four elements. Thatoutward part which is moist and cold is called water, or quicksilver on account ofits inward heat it is called air; if without it appear hot and dry it is fire, or sulphur;and on account of its internal coldness it is also styled earth. In this wayquicksilver and sulphur are the original substance of all metals; but, of course, I donot mean that the substance is prepared by mixing common sulphur andquicksilver. The sulphur and quicksilver of the Sages are one and the same thing,which is first of the nature of quicksilver, or moist and watery and is then byconstant coction transmuted into the nature of sulphur, which may Most justly bedescribed as dry and igneous.Chapter IXA Tract of Great Pricehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/greatprc.htm (5 of 8) [27/05/2004 23:02:08]"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"But I wish to confine my discourse to the quicksilver and sulphur of thephilosophers, from which all metals derive their origin; and it is according to theSages a heavy earthy water mixed with very subtle white earth, and subjected tonatural coction until the moist and the dry elements have become united andcoagulated into one body -- through the perfect mutual adjustment of all theelementary properties, and by the accidental operation of cold. This is thesubstance which is used for the purposes of our Art, after it has been perfectedand purified by gentle coction, and freed from its earthy and sulphureousgrossness, and the combustible wateriness of the quicksilver. It is then one clear,pure and indestructible substance, proceeding from a duplex substance, exhibitingin their greatest purity and efficacy the united properties of quicksilver and ofsulphur. In art the operation is similar to Nature. Hence the Sages have justlyaffirmed that our Art is concerned with quicksilver, gold, and silver. For in its firststage the substance resembles quicksilver which is sublimed by gentle naturalheat, and purified in the veins of the rocks in the form of a pure vapour, as weexplained above. To it we know add silver and gold, and that for the followingreason, because we cannot find anywhere else in any one thing the metallic powerneeded for rousing the sulphur of the quicksilver, and coagulating it, except ingold and silver For the Sage cannot prepare our quicksilver unless it be firstremoved from the earth, and separated from the potency of its naturalsurroundings; and all these natural influences can be artificially supplied only bythe addition of gold and silver. Our Art then has to find a substitute for thosenatural forces in the precious metals. By them alone it is able to fix the volatileproperties of our quicksilver, for in them alone do use find the powers andinfluences which are indispensable to our chemical process. You should also bearin mind that the silver should be applied to our quicksilver before the gold,because the quicksilver is volatile, and cannot with safety be subjected all at onceto great heat. Silver has the power of stirring up the inherent sulphur of thequicksilver, whereby it is coagulated into the form of the Remedy for transmutingmetals into silver, and this coagulation is brought about by the gentle heat of thesilver. Gold requires a much higher degree of heat and if gold were added to thequicksilver before the silver, the greater degree of heat would at once change thequicksilver into a red sulphur, which, however, would be of no use for the purposeof making gold, because it would have lost its essential moisture; and our Artrequires that the quicksilver should be first coagulated by means of silver intowhite sulphur, before the greater degree of heat is applied which, through goldchanges it into red sulphur. There must be whiteness before there is redness.Redness before Whiteness spoils our whole substance.Chapter XThe quicksilver of the Sages has no power to transmute imperfect metals, until ithas absorbed the essential qualities of gold and silver; for in itself it is no metal atall, and if it is to impart the spirit, the colour, and the hardness of gold and silver,it must first receive them itself. It is with the first substance of metals as it is withwater. If saffron is dissolved in water, the water is coloured with it, and if mixedwith other water, imparts to that water, too, the colour of saffron. Unless the firstsubstance, or quicksilver, is tinged with silver and gold, and coagulated by theirefficacy, it cannot impart any colour, or coagulate the 'water or) first substancewhich is latent in the imperfect metals. For it is essentially a spirit. and volatile.and if it be added to imperfect metals, it cannot act upon their water, orundeveloped first-substance, because that is partly fixed by their coagulatedsulphur.

This is the great secretof the Sages, which they are always so careful to veil under dark words thatscarcely one in many thousands is thought worthy to find the philosophicalMercury. Many things have been written about it; but I will quote the words of onephilosopher which I consider as the most helpful: In the beginning, he says, Godcreated the earth plain, simple, rich and very fertile, without stones, sand, rocks,hills, or valleys, it is the influences of the planets which have now covered it withstones, rocks, and mountains, and filled it with rare things of various colours, i.e.,the ores of the seven metals, and by these means the earth has entirely lost itsoriginal form, and that through the following causes:First, the earth which was created rich, great, deep, wide and broad, was, throughthe daily operation of the Sun's rays penetrated to her very centre with a fervent,bubbling, vaporous heat. For the earth in herself is cold and saturated with themoisture of water At length the vapours which were formed in this way in theheart of the earth became so strong and powerful as to seek to force a way outinto the open air, and thus, instead of effecting their object, threw up hills andhillocks or, as It were, bubbles on the face of the earth. And since in those placeswhere mountains were formed the heat of the Sun must have been most powerful,and the earthy moisture rich and most plentiful, it is there that we find the mostprecious metals. Where the earth remained plain, this steam did not succeed inraising up mountains; it escaped, and the earth. being deprived of its moisture,was hardened into rocks. Where the earth was poor, soft, and thin, it is nowcovered with sand and little stones, because it never had much moisture, and,having been deprived of the little it possessed, has now become sandy and dry,and incapable of retaining moisture. No earth was changed into rocks that was notrich, viscous, and well saturated with moisture. For when the heat of the Sun hassucked up its moisture, the richness of the earth still makes it cohere, althoughnow it has become hard and dry; and earth that is not yet perfectly hard is even atthe present time undergoing a change into hard stones, through ,the diligentworking of Nature. But the steam and the vapours that do not succeed in escaping,remain enclosed in the mountains, and are day by day subjected to the maturingand transmuting influences of the Sun and the planets. Now, if this vaporousmoisture become mixed with a pure, subtle, and earthy substance, it is thequicksilver of the Sages; if it be reduced to a fiery and earthy hardness, it becomesthe sulphur of the Sages. This enquiry opens up the way of finding our quicksilver,or first substance of the metals, but though it be found in great quantities in allA Tract of Great Pricehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/greatprc.htm (7 of 8) [27/05/2004 23:02:08]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"mines, it is knows only to very few.

In this case that which is last is better and morehonourable than that which is first. The substance must first become white, andthen red; it cannot become red unless it have first become white. Hence Simon theSage says: \"Know that unless you first make the Stone white, you cannot make itred.\" For by the red are the rest of the planets united, and the Medicine appearsunawares unless this order is observed in the matter of the white and red. So is theMoon first taken and makes, with the white, Elixir, that is, the white of the Moonto the white of Mercury out of bodies comes to the red. Whence our Sages say thatthe red is hidden in the white, which they do not dare to extract, until the wholesubstance has become red. When the substance has been subjected to theinfluence of the Moon, it may then, in the second place, be brought under theinfluence of the Sun, which will bring the Medicine to perfection without any aidfrom the other planets. By which you may understand why the Medicine comeslast, even as from the Father proceeds the Son, and the Holy Spirit from both ofthese. He that hath ears to hear let him hear, and comprehend the brief statementof our Art, which is given in \"The Crowd\": \"Know that the true Tincture can beprepared only out of our ore.\" Concerning this ore I therefore propose to give youthe only explanation that is required, and I shall be careful to supplement andconfirm my own opinion by quotations from other Sages. I shall speak not onlyabout our ore, but also about our union or conjunction of water and mercury. For...Concerning the Philosophical Stonehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/alze.htm (1 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:09]"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Eximenus says: \"Nothing profitable can arise out of the elements withoutconjunction and gentle coction.\" Our ore Lucas calls the white ore, and it goes bymany other names on account of the many colours which it exhibits in the variousstages of the chemical process. But though the jealousy of the Sages has describedit under various names, it is, and remains only one substance. Pythagoras says:\"Many names are given to it; nevertheless, it is nothing else but the one and trueMatter, and this is by reason of the development of its nature. The envious havedescribed it by the names of all bodies, as, for instance, a coin, lead, copper, etc.,according to the variety of its colours.\" So Lucas tells us that we have no need ofmany things but only of one thing. Diamedes and Basan say: \"Do not add to it anyforeign substance; for the common substance of metals is one thing, and moreexcellent than all other things.\" Hence our whole Art is concerned with water, anda twin substance that ameliorates the water. Synon tells us that sulphur and ourore are derived from one thing, and changed into four. Lucas says: \"The white oreis subjected to coction till it generates itself. Thus it becomes united in all its fourelements, and receives a living soul. It is never more than one thing, but as a manconsists of body, soul, and spirit, and yet is no more than one person, so oursubstance consists of body, soul, and spirit. The ore receives its strength, spirit,and growth from the water.\" The Sages say: \"If the ore be often deadened in itscoction, it becomes all the more excellent, and if the body have a soul after themanner of man.\"The body does not penetrate the soul, but the soul penetrates thebody, because it is volatile. The soul which is hidden in the four parts of the body,is called sulphur. These bodies are male and female, and by their mutual operationour substance becomes water. Aristeus says: \"Observe the indestructible waterwhich issues from it.\" Take the humidity which it gives off. Hence other Sages say:\"Take water with its twin substances, and let it be dried up by means of the vapourwhich is like it, and coagulated in its own water.\" That water is also called poison;it is the principle of life, because it is a soul, and extracted from many things. Allbodies that this Tincture enters are quickened; all bodies from which it isextracted are destroyed. Its potency is spiritual blood, which, if well mixed withbodies, transmutes them. into spirits, and combines with them into one substance.The body attracts the spirit, and the spirit tinges the body with a spiritualsubstance like blood. For the Sages say that whatever has a spirit has blood. If thevenom penetrate the body, it imparts to it an indestructible colour, and then thesoul cannot be separated from the body any more. If in flying it faces round andmeets its pursuer, then is the flight at an end. The two belong together, andNature always tends to assimilate kindred substances. The final colour isindestructible, because the soul pervades every part of the body, and isinseparably bound up with it. Though the water is naturally cold, yet we mustbeware of too fierce a degree of heat; for if the moisture of the substance bedried up, our work must come to nought.That which is called the spirit, is the active, or male principle, and can only beobtained by the dissolution of the body. Accordingly, we must understand this ofthe humidity which results, namely, that which is produced, as long as two spousesare conjoined after a lawful manner, even unto the white. Would you know whenthe body has been rendered liquid by coction ? Hear what Bonellus answers: \"Whenyou see a black substance floating in the water, you may know that the body hasbeen dissolved.\"These two, body and spirit, have a third thing which represents their commonsubstance, and is, in its turn, called their body. It-is also called a round cloud,death, blackness, darkness, shadow, ashy lead, or a metallic and subtle ore; or itis described, after that which is obtained from it, as gold that was hidden in the...Concerning the Philosophical Stonehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/alze.htm (2 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:09]"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"body of Magnesia. Hence it is said: \"Extract the shadow thereof from thesplendour.\" This also is the substance of which so many have spoken. Three thingsconstitute the true ore, viz., body, soul, and spirit. Hence it is compared to anegg, because in an egg, too, the chicken is developed out of three things. Thusalso Alchemy is produced out of the above-mentioned three things, as manyphilosophers do testify in \"The Crowd.\" The male principle, or the water, is alsocalled the \"nature\"; for water is a natural agent which dissolves the elements ofbodies, and then again unites them. Concerning this water, it is said by Fictes, thatits nature has the wonderful power of transmuting the body into spirit. Where it isfound alone it overcomes all other things, and is an excellent, harsh, and bitteracid, which transmutes gold into pure spirit. Without this acid we cannot attaineither the red, or the black, or the white. When it is combined with bodies, thenthe body changes into spirit, by a heavenly fire, and immutable, indestructibletincture. Know also that the union must be brought about by a gentle fire, sincethe elements cannot stand a fierce fire, until the union has taken place. When thegentle heat is applied, the elements devour and consume each other, and yetagain, on the other hand, comfort and strengthen each other, and teach eachother to stand the test of fire. Hence the Sages say: \"Invert the elements, and youwill find what you seek.\" To invert the elements is to make that which is moist,dry, and that which is volatile, fixed. The husband also enforces conjunction thathe may reproduce his own likeness. Many strive to accomplish this separation andconjunction; but few succeed in bringing about an union which can stand the testof fire. The composition which is prepared out of our precious substance is noteven in the slightest degree diminished in volume by fire. Rather, it is nourished byfire, as a mother nourishes her child. These are the only things that have thepower of making red and white, both inwardly and outwardly. Remember that atfirst they can only bear a gentle fire. When you see that a whiteness begins toappear it must be your next care to extract it from the black substance; then youshould develop the redness which is hidden in it. But the latter object you mustattain, not by extraction, but by gentle coction. Do not marvel that the Sagesdescribe our ore under many names, and as consisting of body, soul, and spirit.They are also referred to as brothers, or as husband and wife. But Geber says thatsometimes the whole substance is only called body, or spirit; and unless there be adissolution into water, our work cannot be brought to a successful issue. Of course,we do not mean the water of the clouds, as the foolish say, but a permanentwater, which, however, cannot be permanent without its body. Thus Hermogenessays that we are to take the hidden spirit, and not to despise it, because it sharesits great power with its brother. For only the union of the two can give us the rightTincture. The water is also called a most sharp acid with which the body must bewashed; this is what Socrates calls is woman's work, and child's play.\"The secret ofour Art is the union of man and woman: the husband receives the tinging spiritfrom his wife. The union of husband and wife coagulates the female principle; andif the whole be transmuted into red, we have the treasure of the world, of whichSynon says: \"If the water be changed into the body, the body is changed, first intoearth, then into dust and ashes, and you have what you want.\"Then the work is over, and the Stone contains within itself the Tincture in thebody of Magnesia. Therefore, the Sages say, in conclusion: \"My son, extract fromthe splendour its shadow.\" Accordingly, we need exertion, and exercise isbeneficial to us, seeing that milk is for infants, but that strong men requirestronger food. So also is it in this operation of the Stone.Now, it is laid down by Geber that our Art must do more for the substance thanNature has done for it; otherwise we should never obtain the Medicine which has...Concerning the Philosophical Stonehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/alze.htm (3 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:09]"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the power of correcting and perfecting the essences of the seven planets, ormetals. For this purpose the Art of Alchemy has been delivered to us by the Sages;but the beginner must be on his guard against being misled by their manner ofspeaking, and the multiplicity of names which they give to our substance, whichhas been suggested to them by its great variety of (successive) colouring, and bythe fact that it is composed of the four elements. The Stone must be saturatedwith its water, that it may imbibe it all, and then subjected to the action of fire,until it turns to a kind of dust, like burnt blood, and becomes indestructible byfire. This Stone is sought by Kings, but is found only by those to whom it is given ofGod. It is publicly sold for money. But if men knew its precious nature, they wouldcease to think lightly of it. God, however, has hidden it from the world and he whowould accomplish our work should first lay the right foundation, or his buildingmust come to nought. Let me tell you, then, that our Stone requires a gentle fire;and if, after not many days, it die, and lie in the tomb, yet God restores to it itsspirit, and removes its disease and its impurity. When it is burnt to ashes, it mustbe well sprinkled and saturated with its blood, until it becomes like burnt blood.Hermes remarks that both substances rejoice in being united to each other. To thespiritual substance God gives that which Nature could not give it. For Nature hasnothing so precious as the true Tincture; and if with its bodies it become liquid, itproduces a marvellous effect. For the Tincture changes everything it is mixed withinto its own nature, and makes it white both within and without. By one operationand way, by one substance, and by one mixing, the whole work is accomplished,while its purity is also one, and it is perfected in two stages, each consisting of adissolution and a coction, with the repetition of these.It must be your first object to elicit the whiteness of the substance by means ofgentle and continued coction or heat. I know that the Sages describe this simpleprocess under a great number of misleading names. But this puzzling variety ofnomenclature is only intended to veil the fact that nothing is required but simplecoction. This process of coction, however, you must patiently keep up, and thatwith the Divine permission, until the King is crowned, and you receive your greatreward. If you ask whether the substance of our Stone be dear, I tell you that thepoor possess it as well as the rich.Many have been reduced to beggary because they foolishly despised that which ishighly esteemed by the Sages. If kings and princes knew it, none of us would everbe able to obtain it. Only one vessel is required for the whole process, whichshould be of stone, and should be capable of resisting fire.A pound of the body of our ore should be taken, and rendered as pure, refined,and highly rectified, like the virtue of heaven, as the philosophers have it. Thenthe vessel should be placed in a reverberatory alembic. This should be set over agentle fire, the vessel being kept tightly closed, in order that it may be able toretain its companion, and permit the same to enkindle the whiteness thereof, asLucas says. The vessel containing the ore must be placed over the fire, since therecan be no perfection without heat and intermixture of elements, seeing that it isproduced from blood. When the male and the female principle have been togetherfor a space of forty nights, there is an emission of moist warm seed; and to thesame God has liberally given much blood to heat it. This seed develops into anembryo which is supported with a little milk over a moderate fire, and growsstronger day by day. Its growth must be aided by warmth; but the heat of the fireshould be temper ate, like that of the Sun. This may be effected by placing ourvessel over an empty vessel, and that again upon some glowing coals. The processof coction should be continued until the alembic is well dried and the substance...Concerning the Philosophical Stonehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/alze.htm (4 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:09]"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"begins to assume a liquid aspect; for water alone is sufficient for the coagulationand fixing of the whole, as we are told by Democritus. This water is describedunder various names, such as sulphur, quicksilver, spirit, and also vapour, for itcan scarcely retain its companion. There are in our Art only two substances, and ifI speak of two, then I think of four, all which things require one thing, by whichNature, conquering all Nature, is extracted. For Nature, on account of its nature,rejoices in itself, Nature conquers nature, and in itself contains nature. At thesame time one is not opposed to the other, but one comprehends the other,whereby it excels the other, and the philosophers call this water the purifyingwater.This dissolution first imparts a black appearance to the body. The substance shouldthen turn white, and finally red. The blackness exhibits an intermediate stagebetween fixedness and volatility. So long as there is blackness, the femaleprinciple prevails, till the substance enters into the white stage. This whiteness iscalled the first power of our Stone, and the water is referred to as that mostexcellent acid. You must be very careful not to destroy the potency of this water.Avicenna says that natural heat operating in humid bodies, first causes blackness;then removes the blackness; and finally causes whiteness, as may be seen in calx.Hence our substance must become first black, and then white, and be reduced to akind of powder. Then the soul must be restored to the powder by a powerful fire;and both [be] subjected to coction until they become first black, then white,afterwards red, and finally good venom, the whole being accomplished by theseparation of waters. And now, the waters being divided, cook the matter and thevapour till coagulation takes place, and there is made a white stone. Then are thewaters divided. Another mortification, or exsiccation, follows, and is called clouds,or smoke. The smoke well coagulated with its feces becomes quick white; roastthen the white ore that it may bring forth itself. When the blackness vanishes, thespirit is restored; for the spirit does not die, but rather quickens body and soul.The more perfectly our ore is purged, and subjected to coction, the better itbecomes, till it is at length condensed into a Stone. But it must be dissolved againand subjected to a powerful fire, until it looks like burnt blood. If this Stone beadded to any substance, it tinges it into gold. The Sages speak of it as a kind ofroot. Take, they say, the whole virtue of the Tincture, and concentrate it in theRoot. If a body which has no earthy elements receive this Tincture, it receivesmore benefit than less excellent bodies. The Stone overcomes everything to whichit is applied, and tinges foreign bodies with its own colour. The dry fire tingesbodies, the air strengthens them, the white water washes away their blackness,and their earth receives the Tincture. Concerning the coction needed for thedevelopment of our substance, the Sages have expressed themselves in a greatvariety of ways. Observe Hermes, who says that it must be repeated again andagain, until the red colour at length is obtained. Herein is the stability of thewhole work. Afterwards it assumes many, many colours, not including the red,which appears at the end. For the white must precede it. Set to work by theregimen of fire, and triturate. The above mentioned water volatilizes all bodies;even such as are gross it penetrates until it has assimilated them to its own nature.Know that unless you operate upon bodies until they are destroyed and their soul isextracted, with such you will never tinge any body, for nothing tinges which hasnot first itself been tinged. If the body be made fluid and burnt, then it bendsitself towards its begetter, becoming a subtle Magnesia, and it turns towards theearth, which makes it spiritual and vivifies it. Before the final whiteness of thefirst stage is attained, the substance turns first of a black, then of an orange, andthen of a reddish colour (which, however, is quite different from the final redness...Concerning the Philosophical Stonehttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/alze.htm (5 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:09]"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"of the last stage). These colours, however, need not trouble you, since they areevanescent and merely transitional.From what I have said you may gather that our substance is found in the goldwhich is hidden in Magnesia, and that it is one thing composed of sulphur fromsulphur and mercury from mercury. And as the substance of our Stone is one, so isthe method of its preparation. Therefore, do not listen to those ignorant andfraudulent alchemists who speak of many different kinds of sublimation anddistillation. Turn a deaf ear to those who say that the substance of our Stone is thepowder of the Basilisk. As to the (length of) time required for the preparation, youmust begin it in the winter, which is moist, and extract the moisture until thespring, when all things become green, and when our substance, too, should exhibita variety of colours. In the summer the substance should be reduced to powder bymeans of a powerful fire. The autumn, the season of ripeness, should witness itsmaturity, or final redness. About the motions of the stars or planets you need nottrouble yourself. Our substance is a body containing the spirit which makes glassmalleable, and turns crystals into carbuncles. One drop of our Elixir, as large as adrop of rain, will suffice to tinge and transmute a body a thousand times as largeas itself.This most noble Remedy was appointed, like all other things, for the use of man,because he is the most glorious of God's creatures, and the lord of the wholeearth. It was given to him for the purpose of preserving his youth, expellingdisease, preventing suffering, and providing him with all he requires. Our Elixir isbetter than all the medicinal preparations of Hippocrates, Avicenna, and others.From it may be prepared a potable antidote which has power to cure leprosy. Asfire purges and refines metals, so this Remedy restores to the human body itsnatural heat, expels from it all health-destroying matter, and fortifies it againstevery conceivable form of disease. Its virtue is infinitely greater than that of thepotable gold dust, which is taken as a preventative among the Gentiles.Great and wonderful is the potency of the gold that slumbers in Magnesia, both forthe purifying of the human system, and for the transmuting of metals. What moreshall I say? All the things that I have here faithfully described I have seen with myown eyes, and performed with my own hands.When I was preparing the substance, after discovering the true method, I was soseriously interfered with by the persons with whom I lived that I was almost on thepoint of giving up the whole thing in despair. At length I communicated mydiscovery to a friend, who faithfully executed my instructions, and brought thework to a successful issue. For which Blessed Gift may God be praised, worldwithout end.

Then I saw that there was no hope of repentance for mankind, thatthey were getting worse day by day, and that for their impenitence God'severlasting punishment was hanging over them; and I made haste to withdrawmyself from the evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to devote myself to theservice of God.When I had spent some years at the monastery, I found that after I had performedmy work and my daily devotions I still had some time on my hands. This I did notwish to pass in idleness, lest my evil thoughts should lead me into new sins; and soI determined to use it for the study and investigation of those natural secrets bywhich God has shadowed out eternal things. So I read a great many books in ourmonastery written in olden times by philosophers who had pursued the same study,and was thereby stimulated to a more ardent desire of knowing that which theyalso knew. Though I did not make much progress at first, yet at last God grantedmy earnest prayer, and opened my eyes that I might see what others had seenbefore me.In the convent there was a brother, who was afflicted with a severe disease of thekidneys, and to whom none of the many physicians he had consulted had been ableto give even momentary relief. So he had committed himself to the hand of God,and despaired of all human aid.As I loved him, I gathered all manner of herbs, extracted their salts, and distilledvarious medicines. But none of them seemed to do him the slightest good, andafter six years I found that I had tried every possible vegetable substance, withoutany beneficial effect.At last I determined to devote myself to the study of the powers and virtues whichGod has laid into metals and minerals and the more I searched the more I found.One discovery led to another, and, after God had permitted unto me manyexperiments, I understood clearly the nature and properties, and the secretThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (1 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"potency, imparted by God to minerals and metals.Among the mineral substances I found one which exhibited many colours, andproved to be of the greatest efficacy in art.

And his prayers, together with my own diligence, soprevailed with God, that there was revealed to me that great secret which Godever conceals from those who are wise in their own conceits.Thus have I been wishing to reveal to you in this treatise, as far as may be lawfulto me, the Stone of the Ancients, that you, too, might possess the knowledge ofthis highest of earthly treasures for your health and comfort in this valley ofsorrow.

Ipropose to set forth what I have to say in a few simple, straightforward words, forI am no adept in the art of multiplying words; nor do I think that exuberance oflanguage tends to clearness; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is many wordsthat darken council. Let me tell you, then, that although many are engaged in thesearch after this Stone, it is nevertheless found but by very few. For God neverintended that it should become generally known. It is rather to be regarded as agift which He reserves for those favoured few, who love the truth, and hatefalsehood, who study our Art earnestly by day and by night, and whose hearts areset upon God with an unfeigned affection.Hence, if you would prepare our great and ancient Stone, I testify unto you in alltruth that you must give diligent heed to my teaching, and before all thingsimplore the gracious blessing of the Creator of all things. You must also trulyrepent you of all your sins, confessing the same, and firmly resolve to lead a goodand holy life. It is also necessary that you should determine to shew your gratitudeto God for His unspeakable Gift, by succouring the poor and the distressed, and byopening your hand and your heart to the needy.

Let your study of them be increased and repeated often, lest you losethe thread of insight, and the lamp of understanding be extinguished.Give yourself wholly to study, and be not flighty or doubleminded. Let your mindbe like a firm Rock, in which all the various sayings of the Sages are reduced to theunity of their common meaning. For a man who is easily influenced in differentdirections is not likely to find the right path.As our most ancient Stone is not derived from combustible things, you should ceaseto seek it in substances which cannot stand the test of fire. For this reason it isabsurd to suppose that we can make any use of vegetable substances, though theStone, too, is endowed 'with a principle of growth.If our Stone were a vegetable substance, it would, like other vegetables, beconsumed by fire, leaving only a certain salt. Ancient writers have, indeed,described our Stone as the vegetable Stone. But that name was suggested to themby the fact that it grows and increases in size, like a plant.Know also that animals only multiply after their kind, and within their ownspecies. Hence our Stone can only be prepared out of its own seed, from which itwas taken in the beginning; and hence also you will perceive that the soul of ananimal must not be the subject of this investigation. Animals are a class bythemselves; nor can anything ever be obtained from them that is not animal in itsnature. But our Stone, as it has been bequeathed to me by the Ancients, is derivedfrom two things, and one thing, in which is concealed a third thing. This is thepurest truth, and a most faithful saying. For male and female have from of oldbeen regarded as one body, not from any external or visible consideration, but onaccount of the ardour of that mutual love which naturally draws them togetherinto one; and as the male and female seed jointly represent the principle ofpropagation, so also the sperm of the matter out of which our Stone is made canbe sown and increased. There are in our substance two supplementary kinds ofseed, from which our Stone may be prepared and multiplied.If you are a true lover of our Art, you will carefully weigh and ponder these words,lest, with other sophisticators, you fall into the dangerous pit prepared by thecommon enemy of man. But whence are you to obtain this seed? This question youmay most easily answer by asking yourself another question. What do you want todevelop from this seed, and what use do you wish to make of it? There can be nodoubt, then that it must be the root, or first substance, of metals, from which allmetals derive their origin. It is, therefore, necessary that we should now proceedto speak of the generation of the metals.In the beginning, when the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, andas yet all was involved in darkness, Almighty and Eternal God, Whose beginningand wisdom are from everlasting, by His inscrutable counsel created heaven andearth, and all that in them is, both visible and invisible, out of nothing. How theact of creation was accomplished I will not attempt to explain. This is a matterwhich is set forth to us in Holy Scripture, and must be apprehended by faith.To each creature God gave its own seed, wherewith to propagate its kind, that inthis way there might always be an increase of men and animals, plants and metals.Man was not to be able to produce new seed: he was only permitted to educe newThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (3 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"forms of life out of that which already existed. The creating of seed God reservedto Himself For if man could create seed he would be equal to the Creator.Know that our seed is produced in the following way. A celestial influencedescends from above, by the decree and ordinance of God, and mingles with theastral proper ties. When this union has taken place, the two bring forth a thirdnamely, an earth-like substance, which is the principle of our seed, of its firstsource, so that it can shew an ancestry, and from which three the elements, suchas water, air, and earth, take their origin. These elements work underground inthe form of fire, and there produce what Hermes, and all who have preceded me,call the three first principles, viz., the internal soul, the impalpable spirit, andvisible bodies, beyond which we can find no earlier beginning of our Magistery.In the course of time these three unite, and are changed through the action of fireinto a palpable substance, viz., quicksilver, sulphur, and salt. If these threesubstances be mixed, they are hardened and coagulated into a perfect body, whichrepresents the seed chosen and appointed by the Creator. This is a most importantand certain truth. If the metallic soul, the metallic spirit, and the metallic form ofbody be present, there will also be metallic quicksilver, metallic sulphur, andmetallic salt, which together make up the perfect metallic body.If you cannot perceive what you ought to understand herein, you should not devoteyourself to the study of philosophy.Moreover, I tell you in few words, that you cannot obtain a metallic body exceptby perfectly joining these three principles into one. Know, also, that all animalsare, like man, composed of flesh and blood, and also possess a vitalizing spirit, butare destitute of the rational soul which the Creator gave to man alone. Therefore,when animals die, they perish for ever. But when man yields up his mortal life intothe hands of his Creator, his soul does not die. It returns, and is united to theglorified body, in which, after the Resurrection, soul and spirit dwell togetheronce more in eternal glory, never to be separated again throughout all eternity.Hence the rational soul of man makes him an abiding creature, and, though hisbody may seem to die, yet we know that he will live for ever. For to him death isonly a process of purification, by means of which he is freed from his sins, andtranslated to another and better place. But there is no resurrection for the brutebeasts, because they have no rational soul, for which alone our Lord and Saviourshed His blood.For though a body may be vitalized by a spirit, yet it need not, therefore, be fixed,unless, indeed, it possess a rational soul, that strong bond between body andspirit, which represents their union, and resists all efforts to separate them.Where there is no soul, there is no hope of redemption. Nothing can be perfect orlasting without a soul. This is a profound and most important truth, which I feel inconscience bound to make known to my readers. Now, the spirits of metals havethis property of fixedness in a greater or less degree; they are more or less volatilein proportion to the mutual fitness of their bodies and souls. A metal that has thethree conditions of fixedness is not affected by fire or overcome by any otheroutward agent. But there is only one metal that fulfils these conditions, namely,gold. Silver also contains fixed mercury, and is not so quickly volatilised as theimperfect metals, but stands the trial of fire, and yields no food to voraciousSaturn.The Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (4 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Amatory Venus is clothed with abundant colour, and her whole body is one puretincture, not unlike the red colour which is found in the most precious of metals.But though her spirit is of good quality, her body is leprous, and affords nopermanent substratum to the fixed tincture. Hence the soul has to share the fateof the imperfect body, and when the body dies the soul has to leave it. For itsdwelling has been destroyed by fire, and it is without a house wherein to abide.Fixed salt has imparted to warlike Mars a hard, firm, and durable body, which isevidence of the generosity of his soul; nor can fire be said to have much powerover it. And if its strength be united to the beauty of Venus, I do not say but that aprecious and harmonious result may be obtained. For the phlegmatic or humidquality of the Moon may be heated with the ardent blood of Venus, and theblackness of Venus removed with the strong salt of Mars.You need not look for our metallic seed among the elements. It need not be soughtso far back. If you can only rectify the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt (understand,those of the Sages) until the metallic spirit and body are inseparably joinedtogether by means of the metallic soul, you thereby firmly rivet the chain of love,and prepare the palace for the coronation.These things represent a liquid key, comparable to the celestial influence, and adry water joined to the terrestrial substance: all which are one thing, derived fromthree, and two, and one.

I will therefore proceed toshew how, by the help of God, I was enabled to prepare the Stone of the Ancients,and, for your further instruction, I will add twelve keys, in which I give a figurativeaccount of our Art.Take a quantity of the best and finest gold, and separate it into its componentparts by those media which Nature vouchsafes to those who are lovers of Art, as ananatomist dissects the human body. Thus change your gold back into what it wasbefore it became gold; and thou shalt find the seed, the beginning, the middle,and the end-that from which our gold and its female principle are derived, viz.,the pure and subtle spirit, the spotless soul, and the astral salt and balsam. Whenthese three are united, we may call them the mercurial liquid: a water which wasexamined by Mercury, found by him to be pure and spotless, and thereforeespoused by him as his wife. Of the two was born an incombustible oil; for Mercurybecame so proud that he hardly knew himself. He put forth eagle feathers, anddevoured the slippery tail, of the Dragon, and challenged Mars to battle.Then Mars summoned his horsemen, and bade them enclose Mercury in prisonunder the ward of Vulcan, until he should be liberated by one of the female sex.When this became known, the other Planets assembled and held a deliberation onthe question, what would be the best and wisest course to adopt. When they weremet together, Saturn first came forward, and delivered himself as follows:The Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (5 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\" I, Saturn, the greatest of the planets in the firmament, declare here before youall, that I am the meanest and most unprofitable of all that are here present, thatmy body is weak, corruptible, and of a swarthy hue, but that, nevertheless, it is Ithat try you all. For having nothing that is fixed about me, I carry away with me allthat is of a kindred nature. My wretchedness is entirely caused by that fickle andinconstant Mercury, by his careless and neglectful conduct. Therefore, I pray you,let us be avenged on him, shut him up in prison, and keep him there till he diesand is decomposed, nay, until not a drop of his blood is to be seen.\"Then yellow Jupiter stepped forward, bent his knees, inclined his sceptre, andwith great authority bade them carry out the demand of Saturn. He added that hewould punish everyone who did not aid the execution of this sentence.Then Mars presented himself, with sword drawn -- a sword that shone with manycolours, and gave out a beautiful and unwonted splendour. This sword he gave tothe warder Vulcan, and bade him slay Mercury, and burn him, together with hisbones, to ashes. This Vulcan consented to do.While he was executing his office, there appeared a beautiful lady in a long, silverrobe, intertissued with many waters, who was immediately recognised as theMoon, the wife of the Sun. She fell on her knees, and with outspread hands, andflowing tears, besought them to liberate her husband -- the Sun -- from the prisonin which, through the crafty wiles of Mercury, he was being detained by thePlanets. But Vulcan refused to listen to her request; nor was he softened by themoving prayers of Lady Venus, who appeared in a crimson robe, intertissued withthreads of green, and charmed all by the beauty of her countenance and thefragrance of the flowers which she bore in her hand. She interceded with Vulcan,the Judge, in the Chaldee tongue, and reminded him that a woman was to effectthe deliverance of the prisoner. But even to her pleading he turned a deaf ear.While they were still speaking the heaven was opened, and there came forth amighty animal, with many thousands of young ones, which drove the warder beforeit, and opening its mouth wide, swallowed Venus, its fair helper, at the same timeexclaiming with a loud voice: \" I am born of woman, woman has propagated myseed, and therewith filled the earth Her soul is devoted to mine, and therefore Imust be nourished with her blood.\" When the animal had said these words with aloud voice, it hastened into a certain chamber, and shut the door behind it;whither its voracious brood followed, drinking of the aforesaid incombustible oil,which they digested with the greatest ease, and thereby became even morenumerous than they had been before. This they continued to do until they filledthe whole world.Then the learned men of that country were gathered together, and strove todiscover the true interpretation of all they had seen. But they were unable toagree until there came forward a man of venerable age, with snowy locks andsilvery beard, and arrayed in a flowing purple robe On his head he wore a crownset with brilliant carbuncles. His loins were girded with the girdle of life. His feetwere bare, and his words penetrated to the depth of the human soul. He mountedthe tribune, and bade the assembly listen to him in silence, since he was sent fromabove to explain to them the significance of what they had seen.When perfect silence prevailed, he delivered himself as follows:\"Awake, O man, and behold the light, lest the darkness deceive thee!

Thatwhich is to protect another substance against combustion must itself be safe fromdanger. The latter must be stronger than the former, that is to say, it must itselfbe essentially incombustible.

When a man looks into amirror, he sees therein reflected an image of himself. If, however, he try to touchit, he will find that it is not palpable, and that he has laid his hand upon the mirroronly. In the same way, the spirit which must be evolved from this Matter is visible,but not palpable. This spirit is the root of the life of our bodies, and the Mercuryof the Philosophers, from which is prepared the liquid water of our Art - the waterwhich must once more receive a material form, and be rectified by means ofcertain purifying agents into the most perfect Medicine. For we begin with a firmand palpable body, which subsequently becomes a volatile spirit, and a goldenwater, without any conversion, from which our Sages derive their principle of life.Ultimately we obtain the indestructible medicine of human and metallic bodies,which is fitter to be known to angels than to men, except such as seek it at God'shands in heartfelt prayer, and give genuine proofs of their gratitude by servicerendered to Him, and to their needy neighbour.Hereunto I may add, in conclusion, that one work is developed from another. First,our Matter should be carefully purified, then dissolved, destroyed, decomposed,and reduced to dust and ashes. Thereupon prepare from it a volatile spirit, whichis white as snow, and another volatile spirit, which is red as blood. These twospirits contain a third, and are yet but one spirit. Now these are the three spiritswhich preserve and multiply life. Therefore unite them, give them the meat anddrink that Nature requires, and keep them in a warm chamber until the perfectbirth takes place.

The process of augmentation and quickening ismostly performed in [the] earth, while it is caused by spiritual seed through theother elements.The farmer's wife knows that she cannot hope to obtain chickens except throughthe decomposition of the egg. If bread is placed in honeys and suffered to decay,ants are generated; worms are bred in the putrefying bodies of men, horses, andother animals; maggots are also developed by the decay of nuts, apples, andpears.The same thing may be observed in regard to vegetable life. Nettles and otherweeds spring up where no such seed has ever been sown. This occurs only byputrefaction. The reason is that the soil in such places is so disposed, and, as itwere, impregnated, that it produces these fruits, which is a result of theproperties of sidereal influence; consequently the seed is spiritually produced inthe earth, and putrefies in the earth, and by the operation of the elementsgenerates corporeal matter according to the species of Nature. Thus the stars andthe elements may generate new spiritual, and, ultimately, new vegetable seed, bymeans of putrefaction. But man cannot create new seed; for it is not in his powerto order the operation of the elements and the essential influences of the stars. Bynatural conditions, however, new plants are generated simply throughputrefaction. This fact is not noticed by the farmer, simply because it is a thingthat he has always been used to, and for which he is unable to find an explanation.But you who should know more than the vulgar herd, must search into the causesof things, and endeavor to understand how the process of generation andresuscitation is accomplished by means of decomposition, and how all life isproduced out of decay.The Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (19 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Each element is in its turn decomposed and regenerated by that which is containedin it. For you should know that every element contains the three others. In air, forinstance, there is fire, water, and earth. This assertion may appear incredible, butit is nevertheless true. In like manner, fire includes air, water, and earth, sinceotherwise it could generate nothing. Water contains fire, air, and earth; for if itdid not, there could be no growth. At the same time, each element is distinct,though each contains the others. All this is: found by distillation in the separationof the elements.In order to rationally prove this to you, who are investigating the separation ofNature. and purpose to understand the division of the elements, lest you shouldthink my words inventions, and not true, I tell you that if you distil earth, you willfind that, first of all, there is an escape of air, which, in its turn, always containsfire, as they are both of a spiritual essence, and exercise an irresistible mutualattraction. In the next place, there issues water from the earth, and the earth, inwhich is the precious salt, remains by itself at the bottom of the vessel.When water is distilled, air and fire issue from it, and the water and materialearth remain at the bottom. Again, when the invisible part of elementary fire isextracted, you get water and earth by themselves. Nor can any of the three otherelements exist without air. It is air that gives to earth its power of production, tofire its power of burning, to water its power of generating fruit. Again, air canconsume nothing, nor dry up any moisture, without that natural heat which mustbe imparted to it by fire. For everything that is hot and dry contains fire. Fromthese considerations we conclude that no element can exist without the others,and that in the generation of all things there is a mingling of the four elements. Hewho states the contrary in no wise understands the secrets of Nature, nor has heinvestigated the properties of the elements. For if anything is to be generated byputrefaction, the process must be as follows: The earth is first decomposed by themoisture which it contains; for without moisture, or water, there can be no truedecay; thereupon the decomposed substance is kindled and quickened by thenatural heat of fire: for without natural heat no generation can take place. Again,if that which has received the spark of life, is to be stirred up to motion andgrowth, it must be acted upon by air. For without air, the quickened substancewould be choked and stifled in the germ. Hence it manifestly appears that no oneelement can work effectually without the aid of the others, and that all mustcontribute towards the generation of anything. Thus their quickening cooperationtakes the form of putrefaction, without which there can be neither generation,life, nor growth. That there can be no perfect generation or resuscitation withoutthe co-operation of the four elements, you may see from the fact that when Adamhad been formed by the Creator out of earth, there was no life in him, until Godbreathed into him a living spirit. Then the earth was quickened into motion. In theearth was the salt that is, the Body; the air that was breathed into it was mercuryor the Spirit, and this air imparted to him a genuine and temperate heat, whichwas sulphur, or fire. Then Adam moved and by his power of motion, shewed thatthere had been infused into him a life-giving spirit. For as there is no fire withoutair so neither is there any air without fire. Water was incorporated with the earthThus living man is an harmonious mixture of the four elements; and Adam wasgenerated out of earth, water, air, and fire, out of soul, spirit, and body, out ofmercury, sulphur, and salt.In the same way, Eve, our common mother, was created; for her body was built upand formed out of Adam's body - a fact which I wish you particularly to notice.The Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (20 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"To return again to putrefaction, O seeker of the Magistery and devotee ofphilosophy, know that, in like manner, no metallic seed can develop, or multiply,unless the said seed, by itself alone, and without the introduction of any foreignsubstance, be reduced to a perfect putrefaction.The putrefaction of metallic seed must, like that of animal and vegetable seed,take place through the co-operation of the four elements.

But when bycontinued gentle heat, it is reduced to an acid, the spirit is not so volatile as itwas before. For in the distillation of the acid the water issues first, and then thespirit. And though the substance remains the same, its properties have becomevery different. It is no longer wine, but has been transmuted by the putrefaction ofgentle heat into an acid. That which is extracted with wine or its spirit, has widelydifferent properties and powers from that which is extracted with an acid. For ifthe crystal of antimony be extracted with wine or the spirit of wine, it causesvomiting and diarrhoea, because it is a poison, and its poisonous quality is notdestroyed by the wine. But if it be extracted with a good distilled acid, it furnishesa beautiful extract of a rich colour. If the acid be removed by means of the St.Mary's Bath, and the residuum of yellow powder washed away, you obtain a sweetpowder which causes no diarrhoea, but is justly regarded as a marvellouslybeneficial medicine.This excellent powder is dissolved in a moist place into a liquid which is profitablyemployed as a painless agent in surgery.Let me sum up in few words what I have to say. The substance is of heavenly birth,its life is preserved by the stars, and nourished by the four elements; then it mustperish, and be putrefied; again, by the influence of the stars, which works throughthe elements, it is restored to life, and becomes once more a heavenly thing thathas its habitation in the highest region of the firmament. Then you will find thatthe heavenly has assumed an earthly body, and that the earthly body has beenreduced to a heavenly substance.NINTH KEYThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (21 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Saturn, who is called the greatest of the planets, is the least useful in ourMagistery. Nevertheless, it is the chief Key of the whole Art, howbeit set in thelowest and meanest place. Although by its swift flight it has risen to the loftiestheight, far above all other luminaries, its feathers must be clipped, and itselfbrought down to the lowest place, from whence it may once more be raised byputrefaction, and the quickening caused by putrefaction, by which the black ischanged to white, and the white to red, until the glorious colour of the triumphantKing has been attained. Therefore, I say that though Saturn may seem the vilestthing in the world, yet it has such power and effficacy that if its precious essence,which is excessively cold, be reduced to a metallic body by being deprived of itsvolatility, it becomes as corporeal as, but far more fixed than, Saturn itself. Thistransmutation is begun, continued, and completed with Mercury, sulphur, and salt.This will seem unintelligible to many, and it certainly does make an extraordinarydemand upon the mental faculties; but that must be so because the substance iswithin the reach of everyone, and there is no other way of keeping up the divinelyordained difference between rich and poor.In the preparation of Saturn there appears a great variety of different colours; andyou must expect to observe successively black, grey, white, yellow, red, and allthe different intermediate shades.

He had taken to wife hisown sister, Euridice, who did not, however, bear him any children. This heregarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister, and wasinstant in prayer to God both by day and by night, that the curse might be takenfrom him.One night, when he was buried in a deep sleep, there came to him a certainwinged messenger, named Phoebus, who touched his feet, which were very hot,and said: \" Thou noble knight, since thou hast wandered through many cities andkingdoms, and suffered many things at sea, in battle, and in the lists, the heavenlyFather has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thyprayer: Take blood from thy right side, and from the left side of thy spouse. Forthis blood is the heart's blood of your parents, and though it may seem to be oftwo kinds, vet, in reality, it is only one. Mix the two kinds of blood, and keep themixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise Masters There that which isThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (25 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood, and will complete itscourse of development when the Moon has changed for the eighth time If thourepeat this process again and again, thou shalt see children's children, and theoffspring of thy body shall fill the world.\"When Phoebus had thus spoken, he winged his flight heavenward. In the morningthe knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger, and God gave tohim and to his wife many children, who inherited their father's glory, wealth, andknightly honours from generation to generation.If you are wise, my son, you will find the interpretation of my parable. If you donot understand it, ascribe the blame not to me, but to your own ignorance.

Therefore thistwelfth and last Key must serve to open up to you the uses of this Stone. In dealingwith this part of the Subject I will drop my parabolic and figurative style, andplainly set forth all that is to be known.

It isa stone, and no stone; therein Nature alone operates. A fountain flows from it.The fixed part submerges its father, absorbing it, body and life, until the soul isreturned to it. And the volatile mother like to him, is produced in her ownkingdom; and he by his virtue and power receives greater strength. The volatilemother when prepared surpasses the sun in summer. Thus the father by means ofVulcan was produced from the spirit. Body, soul, and spirit exist in both, whencethe whole matter proceeds. It proceeds from one, and is one matter. Bind togetherthe fixed and the volatile; they are two, and three, and yet one only. If you do notunderstand you will attain nothing. Adam was in a bath -- wherein Venus found herlike, which bath the aged Dragon had prepared when his strength was desertinghim. There is nothing, says the Philosopher, save a double mercury; I say that noother matter has been named; blessed is he who understands it. Seek therein, andbe not weary; the result justifies the labour.A short Appendix and clear Resumption of theforegoing Tract concerning the Great Stone of theAncient SagesI, Basil Valentine, brother of the Benedictine Order, do testify that I have writtenthis little book, wherein, after the manner of the Ancients, I have philosophicallyindicated how this most rare treasure may be acquired, whereby the true Sages didprolong life unto its furthest limit.But, notwithstanding that my conscience doth bear me witness in the sight of theThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (27 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Most High, before whom all concealed matters are laid bare, that I have written nofalsehood, but have so exposed the truth that understanding men can require nofurther light (that which is laid down in the theoretical part being borne out andconfirmed by the practice of the Twelve Keys), yet have I been impelled by variousconsiderations to demonstrate by a shorter way what I have written in the saidtreatise, and thus cast further light thereon, whereby also the lover of the desiredwisdom may obtain an increased illumination for the fulfilment of his desire Thereare many who will consider that I am speaking too openly, and will hold meanswerable for the wickedness that they think will follow, but let them restassured that it will be sufficiently difficult, notwithstanding, for any thick-headedpersons to find what they seek herein. At the same time the matter shall be madeclear to the elect. Hearken then, thou follower of truth, to these my words, and soshalt thou find the true way !Behold, I write nothing more than I am willing to hold by after my death andresurrection! Do thou faithfully and simply lay to heart this shorter way, ashereinafter exhibited, for my words are grounded in simplicity, and my teaching isnot confused by a labyrinth of language.I have already indicated that all things are constituted of three essences - namely,mercury, sulphur, and salt - and herein I have taught what is true. But know thatthe Stone is composed out of one, two, three, four, and five. Out of five - that is,the quintessence of its own substance. Out of four, by which we must understandthe four elements. Out of three, and these are the three principles of all things.Out of two, for the mercurial substance is twofold. Out of one, and this is the firstessence of everything which emanated from the primal fiat of creation.But many may by all these discourses be rendered doubtful in mind as to what theymust start with, and as to the consequent theory. So I will, in the first place, speakvery briefly concerning Mercury, secondly concerning Sulphur, thirdly concerningSalt; for these are the essence of the Matter of our Stone.In the first place, you must know that no ordinary quicksilver is useful, but ourquicksilver is produced from the best metal by the spagyric art, pure, subtle,clear, and glistening, like a spring, pellucid even as crystal, free from all dross.Hence make water or combustible oil. For Mercury was in the beginning water, andherein all the Sages agree with my dictum and teaching In this oil of Mercurydissolve its own Mercury, from which the water in question was made, andprecipitate the Mercury with its own oil. Then we have a twofold mercurialsubstance; but you must know that gold must first be dissolved in a certain water,as explained in my second Key, after the purification described in the first Key,and must be reduced into a subtle calx, as is mentioned in the fourth Key. Next,this calx must be sublimated by the spirit of salt, again precipitated, and byreverberation reduced into a subtle powder. Then its own sulphur can more easilyenter into its substance, and have great friendship with the same, for they have awondrous love towards each other. Thus you have two substances in one, and it iscalled Mercury of the Sages, but is yet a single substance, which is the firstferment.The Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (28 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Now follows concerning SulphurSeek your Mercury in a similar metal. Then when you know how to extract themetal from its body by purification, the destruction of the first Mars, andreverberation, without the use of any corrosive (the method of doing which I haveindicated in my third Key) -- you must dissolve that Mercury in its own blood out ofwhich it was made before it became fixed (as indicated in the sixth Key); and youhave then nourished and dissolved the true lion with the blood of the green lion.For the fixed blood of the Red Lion has been made out of the volatile blood of theGreen Lion; hence, they are of one nature, and the unfixed blood again rendersthat which is volatile fixed, and the fixed blood in its turn fixes that which isvolatile, as it was before its solution. Then foster it in gentle heat, until the wholeof the mercury is dissolved, and you obtain the second ferment (by nourishing thefixed sulphur with that which is not fixed), as all Sages unite with me in testifying.Afterwards this becomes, by sublimation with spirit of wine, of a blood-red colour,and is called potable gold.Now I will also give my Opinion respecting the Salt ofthe SagesThe effect of \"salt\" is to fix or volatilize, according as it is prepared and used. Forthe spirit of the salt of tartar, if extracted by itself without any addition, haspower to render all metals volatile by dissolution and putrefaction, and to dissolvequick or liquid silver into the true mercury, as my practical directions shew.Salt of tartar by itself is a powerful fixative, particularly if the heat of quicklimebe incorporated with it. For these two substances are singularly efficacious inproducing fixation.In the same way, the vegetable salt of wine fixes and volatilizes according to themanner of its preparation. Its use is one of the arcana of Nature, and a miracle ofthe philosopher's art. When a man drinks wine, there may be gained from his urinea clear salt, which is volatile, and renders other fixed substances volatile, causingthem to rise with it in the alembic. But the same does not fix. If a man dranknothing but wine, yet for all that the salt obtained from his urine would have adifferent property from that gained out of the lees of wine. For it has undergone achemical change in the human body, having become transmuted from a vegetableinto an animal salt -- just as horses that feed on oats, straw, etc., change thosevegetable substances into flesh and fat, while the bee prepares honey out of theprecious juices of flowers and herbs.The great change which takes place in these and other substances is due toputrefaction, which separates and transmutes the constituent elements.The common spirit of salt, which is extracted according to the direction given inmy last declaration, if there be added to it a small quantity of the \"spirit of thedragon,\" dissolves, volatilizes, and raises together with itself in the alembic, goldand silver; just as the \"eagle,\" together with the spirit of the dragon (which isfound in stony places), before the spirit is separated from its body, is much morepowerful in producing fixation than volatility.This I also say, that if the spirit of common salt be joined to the spirit of wine, andThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (29 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"distilled together with it, it becomes sweet, and loses its acidity. This preparedspirit does not dissolve gold bodily, but if it be poured on prepared calx of gold, itextracts the essence of its colour and redness. If this be rightly done, it reducesthe white and pure moon to the colour of that body from which it was itselfextracted. The old body may also receive back its former colour through the loveof alluring Venus, from whose blood it, in the first instance, derived its origin.But observe, likewise, that the spirit of salt also destroys the moon, and reduces itto a spiritual essence, according to my teaching, out of which the \" potable moon \"may be prepared. This spirit of the moon belongs to the spirit of the sun, as thefemale answers to the male, by the copulation or conjunction of the spirit ofmercury or its oil.The spirit lies hid in mercury, the colour you must seek in sulphur, and theircoagulation in salt; then you have three things which together are capable of oncemore generating a perfect thing. The spirit is fermented in the gold with its ownproper oil; the sulphur is found in abundance in the property of precious Venus.This kindles the fixed blood which is sprung from it, the spirit of the salt of theSages imparts strength and firmness, though the spirit of tartar and the spirit ofurine together with true vinegar, have great virtue. For the spirit of vinegar iscold, and the spirit of lime is intensely hot, and thus the two spirits are found tobe of opposite natures. I do not here speak according to the customary manner ofthe Sages. But I must not say too openly how the inner gates are to be unlocked.In bidding farewell, let me impart to you a faithful word. Seek your material in ametallic substance. Thence prepare mercury. This ferment with the mercury of itsown proper sulphur, and coagulate them with salt. Distil them together; mix allaccording to weight. Then you will obtain one thing, consisting of elements sprungfrom one thing. Coagulate and fix it by means of continuous warmth. Thereuponaugment and ferment it a third time, according to the teaching of my two lastKeys, and you will find the object and goal of your desire. The uses of the Tinctureare set forth plainly in my twelfth Key.Thanks be to God.As a parting kindness to you, I am constrained to add that the spirit may also beextracted from black Saturn and benevolent Jupiter. When it has been reduced toa sweet oil, we have a means of robbing the common liquid quicksilver of itsvivacity, or rendering it firm and solid, as is also set forth in my book.PostscriptWhen you have thus obtained the material, the regimen of the fire is the onlything on which you need bestow much attention. This is the sum and the goal ofour search. For our fire is a common fire, and our furnace a common furnace. Andthough some of my predecessors have left it in writing that our fire is not commonfire, I may tell you that it was only one of their devices for hiding the mysteries ofour Art. For the material is common, and its treatment consists chiefly in theproper adjustment of the heat to which it is exposed.The fire of a spirit lamp is useless for our purpose. Nor is there any profit in\"horse-dung,\" nor in the other kinds of heat in the providing of which so muchThe Golden Tripodhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/twelvkey.htm (30 of 31) [27/05/2004 23:02:20]"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"expense is incurred.Neither do we want many kinds of furnaces.

Thus let it flow by drops; carefully lute your glass receptacle sothat neither spirit nor smoke may escape, and when the liquor distilling assumes ablue or pallid colour, then abstract nothing further.CHAPTER IIISmelt eight oz. of clear, hard iron ore, having no blemishes, in three or four parts,over a fierce charcoal fire; extinguish it with so much of the Virgin water describedin the second chapter as may be necessary for the purpose. Then take three oz. oftin, heat it for a short time in the fire, and steep it in the Virgin water. Pound theiron ore and the tin very small on a marble tablet, and when it begins to cool feedit with some of the water aforesaid. Pour the whole into a narrow-necked glassbottle, and seal it up with lead. Put it in a safe place, and in October you shouldfill a water-tight box (about one yard in height) with fresh horse dung, and thrustyour glass vessel into it. Next to the bottle let there be a layer of unslakedquick-lime. Shut the lid of the box closely, and never look at the mixture but atthe time of the full moon. Its colours will continue to change until it becomesfixed and hardened. Then it is precipitated towards the bottom of the vessel.When it has been in the box twelve weeks, it should be quite black. You may thentake it out, and keep it till the twentieth day of March, when it should be oncemore pounded small, according to the directions given below.CHAPTER IVThe Testament of Cremerhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/cremer.htm (3 of 5) [27/05/2004 23:02:21]"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"About the fifteenth day of March take three oz. of quicksilver, and add to ithalf-an-oz. of \"living water.\" Pass the quicksilver five times through a strainerpurged with lye and well dried.

At first I did not quite know whether tobecome a disciple of the laughing or of the weeping philosopher, or whether tojoin in the exclamation of the wise Prince of Israel: \"All things are vanity.\" But atlength the Bible and experience taught me to take refuge in the study of thehidden secrets of Nature, whether pursued at home, by means of books or abroad,in the Great Volume of the World. Now, the more I drank of the mighty fount ofknowledge, the more painfully my thirst, like that of Tantalus, seemed toincrease. I had heard that there was a bird called Phoenix, the only one of its kindin the whole world, whose feathers and flesh constitute the great and gloriousmedicine for all passion, pain, and sorrow; which also Helena, after her returnfrom Troy, had presented in the form of a draught to Telemachus, who thereuponhad forgotten all his sorrows and troubles. This bird I could not indeed hope toobtain entire, but I was seized with an irresistible longing to become possessed ofat least one of its smallest feathers; and for this unspeakable privilege I wasprepared to spend all my substance, to travel far and wide, and to endure everyhardship. There was, of course, much to discourage me. Some people denied thevery existence of this bird; others laughed at my faith in its wonder-workingproperties. I was thus brought for a time to regard all that Tacitus, Pliny, and allother writers have said as fabulous, and to doubt whether, after all, the differentnarcotics and opiates were not a better remedy for anger and sorrow than thesupposed virtues of the Phoenix. Moreover, I had heard of the simple method ofcuring these mental ailments suggested by a certain wise man to Augustus, whomhe bade run through the twenty-four letters before saying anything whenever hewas angry; and this suggestion appeared to supersede all other remedies. I hadalso read the books of those moral philosophers who undertake to prescribe an...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (1 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"effective remedy for every disease of the mind. But after giving all these boastedspecifics a fair trial, I found, to my dismay, that they were of little practical use.In many cases, the causes of mental maladies appeared to be material, and toconsist in an excess or defect of the bile, or of some other bodily substance; in allthese cases a medical treatment seemed to be indicated; whence Galen, thatprince among physicians, was led to believe that character depends ontemperaments of the body. As a soldier may lose all his bravery and strength bybeing starved and confined in a close prison, so even a good person may yield toanger, simply through some vicious habit of body. This opinion is most reasonablein itself, and is borne out, amongst other things, by the testimony which is givenby Arnold of Villanova, in that book of his where he sets forth the virtues of allmedicines by means of tables of the four qualities: \"The medicines that conduce tointellectual excellence are those which strengthen the digestion, and nourish thebrain and the principal vitals, purging out all superfluities, purifying the blood. andpreventing the ascent of vapours to the brain; hence you will find that manymedical writers speak of their medicines as productive of a direct effect upon themind, when it is only through the medium of the stomach, the brain, the blood,the liver, etc., that they tend to brighten the intellectual faculties, by improvingthe general health of the brain, and quickening all processes of the body, that youmay say they are productive of joy, because they tend to strengthen the chieflimbs, purify the blood, and produce good animal spirits. Other medicines \"lead toParadise,\" as they dispose the heart to charity and to every good work. by theiraction upon the blood. Some medicinal herbs have the power of exciting love, byincreasing and clarifying the blood, and thus quickening the sexual instinct; whileothers make men chaste and religious, by inducing poverty and frigidity of blood,and taking away the edge of all sensual appetite. In the same way, it is possible,by means of certain drugs, to make men stupid and insane, as men are rendereddull and stolid by drinking, too much wine. You may also notice, sometimes, thatafter eating a certain kind of food, men become light-hearted, joyous, andinclined to dance and sing- though they are ordinarily staid and grave persons --while other kinds of food have a contrary effect upon them. Thus, a physician haspower to make a miser liberal, a chaste person lascivious, a timid person bold,simply by changing the complexion of his vital juices. Such are the wonderfulsecrets of the medical Art, though of course, they are hidden from the foolish andthe ignorant. There are a great many infatuated persons who will not believe thatmedicine can do anything but cure a headache; but such people know little of theresources of this science. Hippocrates forbad the physicians whom he taught toreveal these secrets; and it was a wise prohibition.\" A little further on the samewriter says: \" What medicine can produce greater heat than anger? or chill thebody more than fear? or invigorate the nerves more thoroughly than joy? or nourishand comfort more gently than hope? And what more certain cause of death is therethan despair?\" These are the words of the philosopher, and they shew thatmedicine may, through the body, cure the mind, and thus supply a remedy foranger as well as other mental disturbances. It is true that if there is a remedy foranger, it would, in the present state of the world, hardly be very highly esteemed.Still it would calm the passions of individuals, although other persons might notrecognise its value. But that which men do. not care to have just now, may oneday be in great demand. Such is the vicissitude of all things human. Galen oncesaid that the savages of England and Germany were as hostile to the science ofMedicine as they were ignorant of it. But now the descendants of Galen'scountrymen are sunk in barbarism, while the English and Germans are the mostskilful physicians in the world. Thus it seems very likely that this Remedy may beone day in great request, especially when we consider its vast utility, and the...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (2 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"innumerable evils which anger brings upon men.What has been said about anger applies with equal force to grief; for while thesymptoms of anger are more or less mental, those of grief produce a moreperceptible and lasting effect on the body. This great Remedy for anger and grief,then, it would be most desirable to have, if we could only find the Phoenix whichaffords it, Where shall I look for it? Where shall I enquire after it? Whom shall I ask?I determined to go abroad, and to search for it till 1 should have found it. Fortuneassists the brave: to the indolent and idle knowledge never comes. I would leavemy native country-dearly as I love it, and sadly as I should miss my friends -- andwander from land to land until I should be able to return with the eagerly covetedMedicine. All beginnings are difficult: he who has never been sad, cannot rejoice;he who has never erred, cannot be brought back to the right way; and as theChemists say: \"There is in Alchemy a certain noble body, which is moved frommaster to master. whose beginning is misery and sourness, whose end is sweetnessand joy.\" So I expected to endure hardships, and go through bitter experiences,but I also expected them to be crowned with the delights of success. Of theexistence of the Phoenix I had no doubt. or I could not have looked for it. It isenough for me to see the Sun and its rays, even though I cannot touch it; andperhaps it is as well for us that we cannot get so very close to the Sun. But as tothis Medicine which I seek; how can I have a perfect knowledge of it before I seeand touch it? How can I become a Master before I have been a scholar? Theproducts of all countries are not the same; and perhaps I may learn in one part ofthe world what I cannot get to know in another. Moreover, I asked myself thequestion: Can a pilgrim's life hurt any one? Are we not all pilgrims here below tothat land whither our Saviour Christ has gone before? And is not the example ofperegrination set us by the swallow, the herald of spring by the crane, the stork,and other birds of passage? Does not the whole world lie open before man as theair is everywhere accessible to birds? Great Phoebus himself, the god of the Sun,journeys day by day over the wide expanse of the sky. The heart of man beats andpulsates in his bosom from the first to the last hour of his life; and beingsurrounded by all these models and examples, it is natural for man to lead the lifeof a pilgrim, particularly if that pilgrimage be directed towards a certain goal. Themerchant travels over land and sea to buy the produce of distant climes; but anobler merchandise by far are science and knowledge, which are the wares of themind. He who stays at home will there bury his talents, and get to know littleabout the secrets of the universe Moreover, it is both pleasant to travel andhonourable to be always several hours' journey in advance of the Sun. That whichis most spiritual is most swift in its movements, while the lifeless earth alone isimmovable. The other three elements are in perpetual motion: the air sweeps overthe earth in the shape of winds, hurricanes and gales; fire devours everythingbefore it as it rushes onward in the conflagration of a great city; water runs alongin rivers and mighty streams, and hastes to reach the sea. Let us also look up andbehold the heavens as they move in their glory. The stars, the sun, and the moonknow the times and seasons of their rising and setting. A cannon ball, if projectedfrom one of our most powerful guns, would be more than eight days in making thecompass of the world (which is more than 25,000 miles); but the Sun,notwithstanding its vast size, accomplishes the same distance in 24 hours. It wouldmake our thoughts reel if we strove to realise the velocity with which Saturnmoves round the Sun, and with which the heavens revolve round their own axis.But greater still, and far more wonderful, is the speed of human thought, which, ina moment of time, travels from one end of the heavens to the other.

God alone does not move; for He is everywhere.For all these reasons, I conceived that it would be both interesting, pleasant,honourable, and eminently profitable for me to follow the example of the wholeworld, and to undertake a pilgrimage for the purpose of discovering this wonderfulbird Phoenix. I therefore braced myself for a long journey, determining to travel.first, through all the countries of Europe, then, if necessary, to America, thence toAsia, and at last to pass on to Africa. If, after carefully searching for the Phoenix inall these parts of the world, I did not succeed in finding it or hearing of it, I mightreasonably give up all hopes of ever setting eyes thereon. The plan of my journeywas determined by the relative quality of the elements which the different partsof the world represent, i.e., Europe stands for earth, America for water, Asia forair, and Africa for fire; and earth cannot become air except through the mediumof water; nor can water become fire except through the medium of air. Idetermined, then, to go first to Europe, which represents the grossest, and last toAfrica, which represents the most subtle element. But my reasons will be set forthmore clearly as I come to speak of the different parts of the world.EUROPE: EARTHI left my native town on the day of the vernal equinox, when the Moon and Sunwere both in the sign of Aries, with the intention of first travelling through Europe,and to enquire everywhere after the Phoenix. I took Europe to represent theelement Earth, because earth forms the foundation of all the ether elements, andstands out above the water, so Europe is the mother of the whole world, andthough smaller than other continents, is vastly superior to them through thecourage, energy, and mental strength of its inhabitants. Some say that one handfulof earth gives ten handfuls of water, a hundred handfuls of air, and a thousandhandfuls of fire; and this is the relative importance of the different continents, ifEurope answers to earth. Europe has produced the bravest warriors, and the mostdistinguished conquerors; and though she has subdued other continents, she hasherself never been subjugated by them. Of the four great world empires, only onewas founded by an Asiatic prince; the Macedonian, the Roman, and the TeutonicEmpires, have all had their centres in Europe. Alexander the Great and JuliusCaesar were among her sons. If we look at a map of Europe we may easily perceivethat in shape this part of the world resembles a virgin; but her heart is that of alion. For these reasons, I determined to travel first through this Virgin Lion,because it clearly corresponds to the fundamental element: earth.Europe is a Virgin because of her beauty and spotless purity; a Lion because shehas conquered others, but has never herself been conquered. Among the heavenlybodies the Sun answers to Europe, and among the metals, gold. For though sheproduces little gold, and the sun shines upon her with less fierceness than onAfrica, yet she is worthy of being compared to the Sun and gold because of theexcellence of her people, though a few years ago even some real lions were bornin Germany, yet we call her a Lioness only on account of her stoutness of heart.Europe is the Mother of the World, and Germany is her heart.Nor is Europe without her marvels. In Pannonia, it is reported, men live in compactstone houses under water. The hot springs of Carlsbad, it is said, are hardened intostones. On the coasts of Prussia, a transparent and pellucid stone (amber), formedout of subterraneous vegetable juices, is cast ashore in large quantities. I do notmention the coral of the Sicilian sea, which, originally a plant, hardens outsidewater into a white or red tree of stone, or the sealed earth of Germany andSilesia... Europe then, is the Lion Earth. This expression is for those who hear not...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (4 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"with their ears only but also with their brains, it is earth which resists the fire, likegold, and is not resolved into air. Like the boundary pillar of the gods of old, it\"yields to none.\" Hence Europe (the gold of the universe) seemed the very place inwhich I should be most likely to hear of the Phoenix and its Medicines But most ofthose whom I met laughed at my quest, and said that, like Narcissus, I had fallen inlove with the shadow of my own mind, the echo of my vain and ambitiousthoughts, which had no substantial existence apart from my own folly. \"The wordsof the Alchemists,\" said they, \" are like clouds: they may mean and representanything, according to the fancy of him who hears them. And even if there weresuch a medicine, human life is too brief for the search, all that makes life worthliving will have to be neglected and thrust aside while you are engaged in huntingafter it. If we can pick up a knowledge of this secret casually, and whilst devotingourselves to other pursuits, well; but if not, we can very ill spare the time for acloser search.\" These objections (at least the latter half of them) I met as follows:\"The quest of this Medicine demands the whole powers of a man's body and mind.He who engages in it only casually, cannot hope to penetrate even the outwardrind of knowledge. The object of our search is a profound secret, and a man who isnot prepared to give himself wholly to this enquiry had much better abstain from italtogether. I readily acknowledge that the powers of my mind are not such as tojustify me in anticipating success. But the spirit within me impels me to undertakethis search; and I am confident that God will at the last reward my patience, andmy humble waiting upon Him. As every King loves his Queen, as every bridegroomis devoted to his bride, so I regard this science as more beautiful and lovely thananything else in the world besides Now, beautiful things are hard to win, and hardtoil is the way to all that is great and glorious.\" This was the gist of my answer.Now I had already travelled through a great part of Europe, when it occurred tome that Italy and Spain are constantly mentioned by the Ancients as the greatseats of secret knowledge, and I therefore directed my steps thitherward. In SpainI heard that some Arabs (Geber, Avicenna, and others) had lived there a long timeago, and these had possessed the wonderful Medicine; I was also told a great dealabout Hercules and his achievement in securing the golden apples of theHesperides, and also the golden cup, wherein he received the medicine for angerand sorrow. Now all prudent men have decided that it contained a small portion ofthe feathers of the Phoenix. I saw that Geryon with the three bodies was thetheme of the philosopher's writings, that Hercules was a laborious artist, seeker ofthe Medicine. But nobody was able to give me any definite information. I did not,however, wish to leave Europe without visiting the Canary Islands, which are sevenin number and are named: Lancerotta, Bonaventura, Great Canaria, Teneriffe,Gomera, Ferro,and Palma. Three of them, Lancerotta, Gomera, and Ferro, aregoverned each by its own King. Ferro is naturally destitute of good drinking water,but the inhabitants get a supply of it out of certain broadleaved trees, which distilsweet water in such quantities as to suffice for the whole island. Strangers andpirates who land in the island, being ignorant of this fact, are prevented by wantof water from staying in Ferro very long. Now, it happened about this time thatthe King of Gomera had died without leaving a male heir, and his subjects refusedto acknowledge the authority of his beautiful daughter Blanche, unless sheaccepted the hand of some royal wooer, because they said that it was unworthy ofmen to be ruled by a woman, and calculated to injure the manliness of thenational character-as was shewn by the experience of those peoples over whomwomen have borne sway for any length of time. For there women had assumed theplace of men, while men were degraded to the position of women; and, as aconsequence, there followed the wildest excesses of profligacy and lewdness. Sothe royal maiden was prevailed upon to think of bestowing her hand in marriage....Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (5 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Now, there was in the island a royal youth, named Brumazar (with beautiful darklocks and a splendid golden robe),who was passionately enamoured of the royalmaiden Blanche, and was loved by her in return. He wooed and won her, and thewedding was celebrated on condition that she should bring to him as her dower adiamond of great value and magnitude, while he should present to her a splendidruby of incalculable worth (i.e., worth a million ducats); he, as her King and Lord,should protect her from all dangers and from the robbers with whom that countryswarms, while she, on the other hand, promised humbly to obey him withouteither subterfuge or tergiversation. After these preliminaries, they were linkedtogether in close and indissoluble marriage, in which they lived long and happily;and it was predicted that a son should be born to them, who would be a mightyconqueror, and would carry his victorious arms as far as the Pillars of Dionysus inIndia... So you see that I was unable to get any information whatsoever about thePhoenix in the course of my wanderings through Europe; I therefore determined toset sail for America, in the hope that I might be more fortunate among the savagesof that Continent For I remembered the words of the poet:\"Accident is a mighty helper; let your hook always be baited; in the least likelyriver you may catch your fish.\"AMERICA: WATERIn these days, when commerce has opened up, as it were, a highroad across theseas to America (or India in the West), there is no very great difficulty in reachingthat continent; but far different were the circumstances under which it was firstdiscovered. After leaving the \"Islands of the Blessed,\" I became a passenger onboard of a ship which had an eagle for its figurehead; and, after weathering manysevere gales and hurricanes, we at length landed in Brazil, a great province ofAmerica, entirely covered with forests. The surface of the country is only dottedhere and there with the homestead of a settler; there are few towns, and theinhabitants are sunk in ignorance, and unskilled in the arts of civilisation. How,then, could I hope to hear anything about the Phoenix among people who couldhardly read or write? Yet there are in this country many rare and beautiful birdswhich are not found elsewhere, though, of course, the Phoenix, being a miraculousbird, must not be sought among common fowls. The trees of the land are of a richcolour and sweet fragrance; and one day when I was enjoying the wild beauty ofthe forest, and listening to the natural music of the birds, I happened to find anapple of unusual and exquisite beauty, which on a closer view exhibited thefollowing inscription:Within is that which, if you deliver it to itsgrandmother, there will thence arise a son whomay cling to his mother in loving embrace.From this union will arise in a- short time anoble tree which will render to the husbandmana golden harvest.After much thinking, it occurred to me that the seed which was in the fruit mustbe placed in the earth (its grandmother, since the parent tree was its mother). So Itook it as a gift of God, sowed the seed, and when there had sprung up a littletree, I grafted it into the parent tree (first having sawn off that tree close to theground) and when the two had grown together, they became a much more glorioustree than either of them had been before, and the fruit was that of the scionwhich had been inserted into the parent tree.... It is said that before the Spaniards...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (6 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"reached Brazil, there were no horses in that country, so that the natives regardeda horse soldier as a monster half man and half beast; but when both horses andasses had been introduced by the strangers, it was thought most desirable toobtain also some mules which are the common offspring of these two animals.Now, there was a certain chief who possessed a large number both of asses andhorses, and he took particular interest in this matter. He knew very well how tobreed horses from horses, and asses from asses, but he was not acquainted withthe proper method of breeding mules from both; while he was au are that allexperiments which are made in the dark, i.e., without the light of previousexperience, are both dangerous and uncertain. The consequence was that all hisefforts to produce a mule out of a stallion and a she ass were doomed to failure,no doubt because their seeds were not mixed in the right proportion. At last a Sagewho was passing that way, and whose insight into the secret working of Nature wasinfinitely keener and more complete than that of those ignorant people, gave ourchief the following advice:If you would obtain a mule resembling thepaternal ass in length of ear and slowness ofgait, you should feed each of the parents withjust as large a quantity of food as their naturerequires. Would you know what this proportionis? Give to the male twice as much as to thefemale, then a mare will conceive a mule froman ass.This advice was taken by the chief and, after several failures, his perseveranceWas crowned with complete success. Nor does it appear contrary to Nature'sgeneral plan that two different parents should produce offspring which differsfrom them both. Look at the leopard, which is said to be the offspring of the pardand the lioness; in the same way the wolf and bitch beget the lynx; a scioninserted into a good tree produces fruit different from those of the parent stock-new varieties of flowers are obtained by a judicious mingling of the pollen; and thered powder called \"our Tincture,\" being mixed with quicksilver over the fire,produces gold which is utterly unlike either the one or the other. Now, theseAmericans are able to perform a most singular experiment with metals, andparticularly with gold. They have a kind of water in which gold becomes soft likewax and capable of being moulded with the hand into any shape they please. Thiswater is not a corrosive, since it does not burn the fingers of those who take upthe gold. But we need not doubt that it is some chemical discovery, and that it isobtained by a distilling process... As I could gain no further information inAmerica, I began to think of taking the first opportunity of crossing to Asia: I tookwith me a very heavy and valuable piece of a certain kind of wood, the mostprecious I saw here in Brazil, and which is remarkable for its brilliant ebony colour,for this black colour seems proper to America by reason of the blackish poplars andthe soil dyed with various hues. The colour of this wood seems to arise from theheat of the sun, and the wonderful peculiarity of the American soil, of whichMonandez, that learned physician of Seville, writes as follows: \"The variety ofcolour exhibited by the soil of Peru is most remarkable. If you look at it from adistance, it has the appearance of a patchwork quilt spread out to air in the sun:one part of it is green, another blue, others again are yellow, white, black, andred. Now all these are different kinds of mineral earth: the black earth, if mixedwith water or wine, makes an excellent ink, the red soil is said to be the ore ofquicksilver, and the Indians paint themselves with it.\" -- Well, I took my wood,went aboard a ship, with a white unicorn for its figure head, and setting sail for...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (7 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Asia, soon arrived in the Persian Gulf.ASIA: AIRAsia is the third continent of the world, the continent which answers to theelement of Air, and its climate is more temperate than that of the othercontinents, as it is equally remote from the intense cold of Europe, and theintense heat of Africa. Being both warm and moist, it most admirably correspondsto the element of air; its heat is almost everywhere tempered by the vapourswhich ascend from the sea. Moist, warm air has fire for its father, and water for itsmother, and retains the most active qualities of both its parents. Thus air is amediator between the two hostile elements, and in its own composition reconcilestheir strife. In the same way Asia binds Europe (earth) and Africa (fire) together,the grossest and the most subtle of the elements; but without Asia (air) therewould be no union between them. By means of air, fire clings gladly to earth, andfosters it; but without air, the fire soon goes out. It is the prerogative anddistinctive mark of Asia to be the centre of the world, and to bring forth suchfruits as require a warm soft air, as, for instance, dates, balsam, spices of allkinds, and gold itself. Asia is the cradle of our race, the seat of the first Monarchy,the birthplace of our Redeemer. From the Persian gulf I travelled straight throughthe continent, till I reached those parts of Asia Minor where Jason is said to haveobtained the golden fleece. So, being greatly interested in these old worldoccurrences, I walked out one day to a place said to be the field of Mars, and thesite of the Palace of Aetes, the descendant of the Sun; there I met an old man ofvenerable aspect and authoritative port, who saluted me graciously, and to whom,after returning his salutation, I addressed the following words: \"Master, if I am nottroubling you too much, kindly enlighten my ignorance, as I can doubt neither yourability nor your willingness to help a stranger.\" He having signified his willingnessto do for me all that lay in his power, I asked him whether those things which wererelated in history and poetry concerning Jason and his golden fleece, were realfacts or mere poetical fictions. He smiled, and made the following reply to myquestion: \"I myself am Jason, and better able than any one else to give youinformation concerning those things which have happened to myself. You need notbe afraid, for during my lifetime I was no man's enemy, but succoured all, like agood physician; and now that I no longer belong to this world, I am still as kindlydisposed towards my mortal brethren. On this spot stood the royal seat of myfather-in-law, Aetes, whose father was the Sun-not, indeed, that heavenlyluminary (which would be incredible), but one likest to him in name, and face, anddignity. The golden fleece of the ram, which Mercury had transmuted, and whichAetes had hung in the grove of Mars, I obtained in the following manner: Medeawas my chief adviser, and she enabled me by her wise counsel to contendsuccessfully against the fierce and venomous monsters. The watchful Dragon Istupefied with a narcotic, which I cast into his maw; and while he was in thathelpless state, I hastened to extract his teeth. These had to be buried in earth firstprepared and ploughed up by means of bulls vomiting fire, which fire wasextinguished by water poured into their mouths. Then Medea gave me the imagesof the Sun and Moon, without which, she said, nothing could be done.\" I askedwhere I should find all these things. His answer was that he obtained them Medea,but he could not tell me where she was be found. \"When she left me in hermadness,\" he said, \" she was to wedded to old Aegeus, to whom she bore Medus;Medus afterwards went to Asia, and became the founder of the Median race.\" Iwished to ask Jason many more questions, but he excused himself from answeringthem, and vanished before my eyes. Then I saw that he had been speaking of theMedicine of which I was in search, which also he had shadowed out under the...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (8 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"figure of the golden fleece. For the crest of the Phoenix and its feathers aredescribed by the learned as exhibiting a golden splendour. I did not indeed meetwith many learned men in Asia; but I was well satisfied to have explored thatblessed \"aerial earth,\" especially as Syria and the Holy Land (with their rivers ofAdonis and Jordan, in which the leper Naaman was cleansed) form part of it. InSyria, it is related that Adonis was killed by a boar, hounded on by Mars, and thatfrom his wounds there flowed forth that balm by means of which human bodies arepreserved from decomposition. On this continent stood the Holy of Holies, intowhich our Most High Priest entered when He had made atonement for the sins ofthe whole race on the Cross of Calvary; to Him let us now utter forth the mostardent desires of our hearts in the following prayer:O great and merciful Saviour of the world, Jesus Christ, who being God from alleternity, next madest man in time, in order that, as our Mediator, Thou mightestunite God and man, by satisfying the eternal and infinite power of God whichhuman sin had provoked to wrath, that is to say, Thyself, the Father, and the HolySpirit. For this purpose Thou wast born into this world and didst go about doinggood among men and didst sanctify this earth by Thy miracles, Passion,Resurrection, and Ascension. To Thee I pray from the very bottom of my heart thatas Thou hast given this Medicine for the use of men by ordinary means, andmeanwhile hast Thyself cured incurable diseases by Thy Divine power, Who art theGreat Physician: so Thou wouldst bestow the gift of this most precious Medicineupon me, the very humblest of thy servants, who for the sake of this most blessedknowledge have taken upon myself so weary a pilgrimage, and so many toils andhardships, as Thou well knowest -- in order that I may use it to the glory of ThyName, and for the relief of my suffering brethren. Thou who art a searcher ofhearts, knowest that I despise all worldly pomp, and desire to consecrate my lifeto Thee, if Thou wilt but work in me both the will and the power of performance:Grant to me the power of exercising boundless charity, of relieving all sufferings,both bodily and mental: Bless me with the gracious gift of Thy Medicine, whichcomes next in value after the peace of mind and eternal happiness which Thouhast gained for us, in order that its virtue may be effectual in the cure of humansorrow, disease, and pain; to the everlasting praise of the everblessed Trinity,world without end, Amen.When I had poured forth this prayer to the Giver of all good things, I rememberedthat besides the land which once flowed with milk and honey, but now, underTurkish rule, has become utterly barren and sterile, there was also in Asia,Paradise, which was created for man while he was still perfect. Knowing that thisblessed garden was situated near Babylon, I journeyed to the spot, but foundnothing except a confluence of certain rivers. Thence I travelled to the maritimeparts of India, and found a city, called Ormuz, of which there ran a proverb, that ifthe world was a ring, Ormuz would be its gem. In this city there was a greatconcourse of eager visitors from the whole neighbourhood; and when I asked oneof them whither he was hastening, he said: To the terrestrial paradise. \"What,\"said I, \"was I unable to find the ancient garden of Eden, and do these people speakof a new Paradise! \"But the man left me standing there, and pursued his journey asfast as he could. While I was considering whether I should follow him, it occurredto me that I should do well to adopt the plan of Columbus, the discoverer ofAmerica. So I went to the different gates of the city, and determined to leave it bythat one where the sweetest and most fragrant odours were borne towards me onthe air. This I did, and I soon found myself on a road where the air was such asmight well come from an earthly Paradise, yet was frequented by very fewtravellers. Ormuz being situated on an island, we soon had to cross a sea, where I...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (9 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"saw men fishing, up pearls of the purest whiteness. Having obtained some of thesefor love and money, I had no doubt that I had come into possession of one of themost important substances of the Medicine, for the whiteness of these pearls wassuch as to defy exaggeration. After pursuing my journey on the mainland, along avery narrow by-path, for some time, I reached a point where two roads met, andthere was a statue of Mercury, of which the body was silver while the head wasoverlaid with gold. The right hand of this statue pointed towards the EarthlyParadise, and when I had followed for some time the road which it indicated, Icame to a very broad and deep river, which it was impossible to cross without aboat, though far and wide there was no boat to be seen; but the beauty of theother shore convinced me that it must be the Earthly Paradise. The trees whichgrew there were covered with golden, orange, citron coloured, purple, andintensely red flowers. There were evergreen laurels, junipers box-trees, and greatstore of blossoms of all colours and of the sweetest fragrance: sunflowers,amaranths, lilies, roses, hyacinths, &c. The ear was charmed with the songs andcries of nightingales, cuckoos, parrots, larks, thrushes, and hundreds of otherknown and unknown birds; nor was there wanting the sweet music of instrumentsand sweet-toned organs; the taste was gratified, as it seemed, with all manner ofdelicious fruits, and the fragrance which streamed out on the breeze was such ascharmed while it rendered insensible the olfactory nerves of all the people wholived round about, just as the noise of the Nile cataracts becomes inaudible tothose who are used to it. But what did the sight of all these glories profit me, who,for want of one little boat, was unable to get at them? So I turned away, with thefirm resolution of coming back, as soon as I could do so with a better chance ofsuccess; in the meantime, I should be most likely to find the Phoenix that I was insearch of, if I crossed over to Africa without further delay. So I directed my coursetowards the Red Sea, and there landed in Africa.AFRICA: FIREWhen I reached Africa, more than a year had elapsed from my first setting out; theSun had once more entered the sign of the Lion, the Moon was at her height in thehouse of Cancer. All these were circumstances which inspired me with hope. Theintense heat of the African climate renders the whole continent torrid, sterile, anddry. It has few rivers, but many wild beasts, which meet together at the riverside,and bring forth among themselves many new and strange shapes, for which Africais so well known. Satyrs, cynocephali, and semi-human beings are said to livethere. There are the Mountains of the Moon, and Atlas that bears up the heavenson its shoulders: all these abound in minerals and in serpents. There also iscollected the blood of the Dragon which the Dragon has sucked from the Elephant;but when the Elephant falls dead, the Dragon is crushed, and the blood which ithas drunk is pressed out of it. Again, in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea, ananimal named Ortus has been observed, the colour Of whose head is red, with goldlines up to the neck, while its eyes are deep black and its feet white, to wit, thefore feet, but the hind feet are black, the face up to the eyes white--a descriptionwhich tallies exactly With that which Avicenna gives of our Medicine. Now I heardthat not far from the Red Sea there lived a prophetess, named the ErytheraeanSibyl, in a rocky cave; and I thought well first of all to enquire of her concerningthis Phoenix. It is she that prophesied and predicted the coming of the Son of Godin the flesh This assertion has indeed been questioned by many writers, but it isborne out by Eusebius, the great historian of the Early Church, and by Cicero. thegreat orator, who, as is well known, translated this prophecy into the Latintongue. Abundant evidence to the same effect may also be collected from theworks of Virgil, the prince of Roman poets. The passage of Cicero which is referred...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (10 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"to by Eusebius, will be found in the second book of his treatise, De Divinatione (OnDivination). . . . When I came to her, I found her sitting in her cave, which wasbeautifully overgrown with the spreading boughs of a green tree, and covered withgreen sod. I saluted her with the lowliest and most deferential humility. At firstshe seemed somewhat startled at my sudden appearance, and hastily retreated tothe interior of the cave. But she was soon won over by my earnest entreaties, andprevailed upon to shew herself at the entrance of her habitation. \"Who art thou,stranger?\" she enquired, \"and what wouldest thou of me? Dost thou not know that aman may not approach a virgin that dwells in solitude?\" \"It is not forward boldnessthat has brought me hither,\" I replied; \" but I have come after mature deliberation,because I feel that it is you, and you alone, that can resolve certain doubts whichlie heavy on my mind. If you will shew me this great kindness, I, on my part,promise to do you suit and service, and to fulfil all your commands, as far as lies inmy power\" When she heard these words, her countenance cleared, and she askedme in a more kindly tone what my business was. \"I cannot,\" she continued, \"denyanything to men like you who are anxious to learn.\" \"There are two things,\" Ireturned, concerning which I would crave plain and straightforward instructionfrom you. namely, whether there was and is in these countries of Arabia and Egypta wonderful bird named Phoenix; whether its flesh and feathers are really aneffectual medicine for anger and grief; and, if so, where the bird is to be found?\"The object of your search,\" she rejoined, \"is a great and glorious one; doubt is thefirst stage of knowledge, and you have also come to the right place and the rightperson. For the country in which you now find yourself is Araby the Blest, andnowhere else has the Phoenix ever been found; moreover, I am the only personwho could possibly give you any definite information about it. I will teach you, andthis land will exhibit to you, the glad sight of which I speak. Therefore, listen tomy words Arabs the Blest and Egypt have from of old rejoiced in the solepossession of the Phoenix, whose neck is of a golden hue, while the rest of its bodyis purple, and its head is crowned with a beautiful crest. It is sacred to the Sun,lives 660 years, and when the last hour of its life approaches, it builds a nest ofcassia and frankincense, fills it with fragrant spices, kindles it by flapping its wingstowards the Sun, and is burnt to ashes with it. From these ashes there is generateda worm, and out of the worm a young bird which takes the nest, with the remainsof its parent, and carries it to Heliopolis (or Thebes), the sacred city of the Sun inEgypt. Now, this whole tale which you find in the books of the Ancients isaddressed to the mind rather than to the ear; it is a mystical narrative, and likethe hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, should be mystically (not historically)understood. An ancient Egyptian writer tells us that the Phoenix rejoices in theSun, and that this predilection is its chief reason for coming to Egypt. He alsorelates that his countrymen were in the habit of embalming the Phoenix if it diedbefore its time. If you therefore regard this tale as an allegory, you will not be farwrong; and you know that the flesh and feathers of this bird were of old used inHeliopolis as a remedy for anger and grief.\" When I heard her say this, I was full ofjoy, and asked her whether she could tell me how to become possessed of thisBlessed Bird and Medicine. She promised not to forsake me, and to do all in herpower to help me out of my difficulty. \"Nevertheless,\" she continued, \"the mostimportant part of the enterprise must be performed by the toil of your own hands.I cannot describe to you in exact and unmistakable terms the place where thePhoenix lives, yet I will endeavour to make it as plain to you as I may. Egypt, youknow, owes all her fertility to the Nile, whose sources are unknown andundiscoverable; but the mouths by which it is discharged into the sea, aresufficiently patent to all. The fourth Son of the Nile is Mercury, and to him hisfather has given authority to shew you this bird, and its Medicine.

The way to the Canopic mouth led me through anancient Christian burial ground, where a most miraculous occurrence is witnessedevery year on a certain day in May. From dawn to noon on that day the deadbodies gradually rise from their graves until they are completely visible to thepassers by; and from noon to sunset they gradually sink back again into theirtombs. If this be true, as eye-witnesses testify, it is a most certain proof of theresurrection of the human body, and exhibits a close analogy to the resuscitationof the dead Phoenix...When I reached the island of Canopus, I enquired whereMercury was to be found. But the people were only hopelessly puzzled by myquestions. Some said that, according to Hermes, Egypt exhibits an image of theheavens, and the seven mouths of the Nile (of which the Canopic is the mostconsiderable) correspond to the seven planets, the Canopic mouth they called thehabitation of Saturn, the grandfather of Mercury; Mercury was to be founddomiciled in some other mouth of the river. At the Bolbitic mouth none of thosepersons of whom I enquired knew anything about Mercury. Near the third orSebennitic mouth stood the city of Sebennis, of which the inhabitants were sosavage and cruel towards strangers, and so utterly destitute of all the arts andgraces of civilization, that I could not conceive of Mercury, the god of culture andscience, living in their midst. Moreover, a certain peasant whom I asked whetherMercury's house was there, old me that he had a house in the town but that henever lived there. So I at once went on to the fourth or Pelusian mouth of the file.The famous city of Pelusium is said to have been founded by Peleus, the father ofAchilles. It separates Asia and Arabia from Egypt, and was at one time a mostwealthy town. When I heard of its greatness in commerce and industry, and of thelarge quantities of Arabian gold which are imported in this city, one of thewealthiest marts of Egypt, I felt assured that I should find the dwelling of Mercuryhere; but I was told by the inhabitants that he did not come there very often,though he was received as a most welcome guest whenever he did visit it. Thisanswer filled me with dismay, which was in proportion to the hopes which I hadconceived, but I determined not to abandon my search till I should have visited thethree remaining mouths of the river.At the Tenitic mouth of the Nile, I learned quite as much as I had learnedeverywhere else, namely-nothing. When the people who lived there told me thatMercury never came to them at all, I began to bewail my hapless fate, and themany fruitless journeys I had undertaken; and I now saw that perhaps it wouldhave been wiser to have begun at the other end. There. however, I was; only twomouths of the river were left; and in one of these Mercury would be found, ifindeed the Prophetess had spoken true. At the Phoenetic mouth anotherdisappointment awaited me. Mercury had once lived there, but had long sincemigrated somewhere else. At the seventh, or Mendesian mouth, nothing whateverwas known about him. It may easily be imagined that, after this long series ofdisappointments, I began to suspect the Sibyl very strongly of having sent me on afool's errand, for I had now visited every one of the mouths of the Nile, and yethad not found even a trace of Mercury in any of them. Or if the words of theprophetess had been true, it seemed as if the various people of whom I hadenquired must have deceived me with false information. But after more matureconsideration of the answers which had been returned to my questions in the...Concerning the Secrets of Alchemyhttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/maier.htm (12 of 14) [27/05/2004 23:02:24]"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"different places I arrived at the conclusion that I had merely misapprehended theirmeaning. So I retraced my steps, and at length succeeded in finding Mercury in oneof the mouths, where the people had at first appeared to know nothing about him.He shewed me at great length, where I must look for the Phoenix and where Icould obtain possession of it. When I reached the place to which he directed me, Ifound that the Phoenix had temporarily deserted it, having chanced to be chosenumpire between the owl and other birds which pursue it, of which battle we havetreated otherwise. It was expected back in a few weeks; but, as I could not affordto wait so long just then, I thought I might be content with the information I hadgained, and determined to consummate my search at some future time. So, havingreturned to my native land, I composed the following epigrams in honour of theSibyl, Mercury, the Phoenix, and the Medicine.EPIGRAMIn Honour of the Erythreaean Sibyl, named HerophyleI thank thee, great prophetess, Whose inspiration is not of the fiend, but of theSpirit of God, that thou didst direct me on my way to the Son of Nilus, who shouldshew unto me the bird Phoenix.

Thecontents of this Book are not fables, but real experiments which I have seen,touched, and handled, as an adept will easily conclude from these lines. I havewritten more plainly about this Art than any of my predecessors; sometimes I havefound myself on the very verge of breaking my vow, and once or twice had to laydown my pen for a season; but I could not resist the inward prompting of God,which impelled me to persevere in the most loving course, who alone knows theheart, and to whom only be glory for ever. Hence, I undoubtedly gather that in thislast age of the world, many will become blessed by this arcanum, through what Ihave thus faithfully written, for I have not willingly left any-thing doubtful to theyoung beginner. I know many who with me do enjoy this secret, and am persuadedthat many more will also rejoice in its possession. Let the holy Will of God performwhat it pleases, though I confess myself an unworthy instrument through whomsuch great things should be effected.CHAPTER IOf the need of Sulphur for producing the ElixirWhoever wishes to possess this secret Golden Fleece, which has virtue totransmute metals into gold, should know that our Stone is nothing but golddigested to the highest degree of purity and subtle fixation to which it can bebrought by Nature and the highest effort of Art; and this gold thus perfected iscalled \"our gold,\" no longer vulgar, and is the ultimate goal of Nature. Thesewords, though they may be surprising to some of my readers, are true, as I, anadept, bear witness; and though overwise persons entertain chimerical dreams,Nature herself is most wonderfully simple. Gold, then, is the one true principle ofpurification. But our gold is twofold; one kind is mature and fixed, the yellowLatten, and its heart or centre is pure fire, whereby it is kept from destruction,and only purged in the fire. This gold is our male, and it is sexually joined to aAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (2 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"more crude white gold -- the female seed: the two together being indissolublyunited, constitute our fruitful Hermaphrodite. We are told by the Sages thatcorporal gold is dead, until it be conjoined with its bride, with whom thecoagulating sulphur, which in gold is outwards, must be turned inwards. Hence itfollows that the substance which we require is Mercury. Concerning this substance,Geber uses the following words: \"Blessed be the Most High God who createdMercury, and made it an all-prevailing substance.\" And it is true that unless we hadMercury, Alchemists might still boast themselves, but all their boasting would bevain. Hence it is clear that our Mercury is not common mercury; for all commonmercury is a male that is corporal, specific, and dead, while our Mercury isspiritual, female, living, and life-giving. Attend closely to what I say about ourMercury, which is the salt of the wise men. The Alchemist who works without it islike a man who draws a bow without a string. Yet it is found nowhere in a purestate above ground, but has to be extracted by a cunning process out of thesubstance in which it exists.CHAPTER IIOf the Component Principles of the Mercury of the SagesLet those who aim to purify Mercury by means of salts, faeces and other foreignbodies, and by strange chemical processes, understand that though our water isvariousy composed, it is yet only one thing, formed by the concretion of diverssubstances of the same essence. The components of our water are fire, thevegetable \"Saturnian liquid,\" and the bond of Mercury. The fire is that of mineralSulphur, which yet can be called neither mineral nor metallic, but partakes of bothcharacters: it is a chaos or spirit, because our fiery Dragon, that overcomes allthings, is yet penetrated by the odour of the Saturnian liquid, its blood growingtogether with the Saturnian sap into one body which is yet neither a body (since itis all volatile) nor a spirit (since in fire it resembles melted metal). It may thus bevery properly described as chaos, or the mother of all metals. From this chaos Ican extract everything -- even the Sun and Moon -- without the transmutatoryElixir. It is called our Arsenic, our Air, our Moon, our Magnet, and our Chalybs:these names representing the different stages of its development, even unto themanifestation of the kingly diadem, which is cast out of the menstruum of ourharlot. Learn then, who are the friends of Cadmus; who is the serpent thatdevoured them; what the hollow oak to which Cadmus spitted the serpent. Learnwho are the doves of Diana, that overcome the green lion by gentleness: even theBabylonian dragon, which kills everything with its venom. Learn, also, what are thewinged shoes of Mercury, and who are those nymphs whom he charms by means ofhis incantations.CHAPTER IIIConcerning the Chalybs of the SagesOur Chalybs is the true key of our Art, without which the Torch could in no wise bekindled, and as the true magi have delivered many things concerning it, so amongvulgar alchemists there is great contention as to its nature. It is the ore of gold,the purest of all spirits; a secret, infernal, and yet most volatile fire, the wonderof the world, the result of heavenly virtues in the lower world -- for which reasonthe Almighty has assigned to it a most glorious and rare heavenly conjunction,even that notable sign whose nativity is declared in the East. This star was seen bythe wise men of old, and straightway they knew that a Great King was born in theworld. When you see its constellation, follow it to the cradle, and there you willbehold a beautiful Infant.

Thus, as Chalybs is the ore of gold, so ourMagnet is the true ore of our Chalybs. The hidden centre of our Magnet abounds inSalt, which Salt is the menstruum in the Sphere of the Moon, and can calcine gold.This centre turns towards the Pole with an archetic appetite, in which the virtueof the Chalybs is exalted into degrees. In the Pole is the heart of Mercury, the truefire (in which is the rest of its Master), sailing through this great sea that it mayarrive at both the Indies, and direct its course by the aspect of the North Star,which our Magnet will manifest.CHAPTER VOf the Chaos of the SagesLet the student incline his ear to the united verdict of the Sages, who describe thiswork as analogous to the Creation of the World. In the Beginning God createdHeaven and Earth; and the Earth was without form and void, and the Spirit of Godmoved upon the face of the waters. And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and therewas light. These words are sufficient for the student of our Art. The Heaven mustbe united to the Earth on the couch of friendship, so shall he reign in glory forever. The Earth is the heavy body, the womb of the minerals, which it cherishes initself, although it brings to light trees and animals. The Heaven is the place wherethe great Lights revolve, and through the air transmit their influences to the lowerworld. But in the beginning all was one confused chaos. Our Chaos is, as it were, amineral earth (by virtue of its coagulation), and yet also volatile air -- in thecentre of which is the Heaven of the Sages, the Astral Centre. which with its lightirradiates the earth to its surface. What man is wise enough to evolve out of thisworld a new King, who shall redeem his brothers from their natural weaknesses, bydying, being lifted on high, and giving his flesh and blood for the life of the world ?I thank Thee, O God, that Thou hast concealed these things from the wise andprudent, and hast revealed them unto babes!CHAPTER VIOf the Air of the SagesOur air, like the air of the firmament, divides the waters; and as the waters underthe firmament are visible to us mortals, while we are unable to see the watersabove the firmament, so in \"our work\" we see the extracentral mineral waters, butare unable to see those which, though hidden within, nevertheless have a realexistence. They exist but do not appear until it please the Artist, as the author ofthe New Light has testified. Our air keeps the extracentral waters from minglingwith those at the centre. If through the removal of this impediment, they wereenabled to mingle, their union would be indissoluble. Therefore the externalvapours and burning sulphur do stiffy adhere to our chaos, and unable to resist itstyranny, the pure flies away from the fire in the form of a dry powder. This thenshould be your great object. The arid earth must be irrigated, and its poressoftened with water of its own kind, then this thief with all the workers of iniquitywill be cast out, the water will be purged of its leprous stain by the addition oftrue Sulphur, and you will have the Spring whose waters are sacred to the maidenAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (4 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Queen Diana. This thief is armed with all the malignity of arsenic, and is fearedand eschewed by the winged youth. Though the Central Water be his Spouse, yetthe youth cannot come to her, until Diana with the wings of her doves purges thepoisonous air, and opens a passage to the bridal chamber. Then the youth enterseasily through the pores, presently shaking the waters above, and stirring up arude and ruddy cloud.

In this first section of our work, nothing is to be donewithout hard and persevering toil; though it is quite true that afterwards thesubstance develops under the influence of gentle heat without any imposition ofhands. The Sages tell us that their Eagles must be taken to devour the Lion, andthat they gain the victory all the sooner if they are very numerous; also that thenumber of the work varies between 7 and 9. The Mercury of the Sages is the Birdof Hermes (now called a goose, now a pheasant). But the Eagles are alwaysmentioned in the plural, and number from 3 to lo. Yet this is not to be understoodas if there should be so many weights or parts of the water to one of the earth,but the water must be taken so oftentimes acuated or sharpened as there areEagles numbered. This acuation is made by sublimation. There is, then, onesublimation of the Mercury of the Sages, when one Eagle is mentioned, and theseventh sublimation will so strengthen your Mercury, that the Bath of your Kingwill be ready... Let me tell you now how this part of the work is performed. Take 4parts of our fiery Dragon, in whose belly is hidden the magic Chalybs, and 9 partsof our Magnet; mingle them by means of a fierce fire, in the form of a mineralwater, the foam of which must be taken away. Remove the shell, and take thekernel. Purge what remains once more by means of fire and the Sun, which may bedone easily if Saturn shall have seen himself in the mirror of Mars. Then you willobtain our Chameleon, or Chaos, in which all the virtues of our Art are potentiallypresent. This is the infant Hermaphrodite, who, through the bite of a mad dog, hasbeen rendered so fearful of water, that though of a kindred nature, it alwayseschews and avoids it. But in the grove of Diana are two doves that soothe its rabidmadness if applied by the art of the nymph Mercury. Take it and plunge it underwater till it perish therein; then the rabid and black dog will appear panting andhalf suffocated -- drive him down with vigorous blows, and the darkness will bedispelled. Give it wings when the Moon is full, and it will fly away as an Eagle,leaving the doves of Diana dead (though, when first taken they should be living).Repeat this seven times, and your work is done, the gentle coction which follows ischild's play and a woman's work.CHAPTER VIIIOf the Difficulty and Length of the First OperationSome Alchemists fancy that the work from beginning to end is a mere idleentertainment; but those who make it so will reap what they have sown -- viz.,nothing. We know that next to the Divine Blessing, and the discovery of the properAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (5 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"foundation, nothing is so important as unwearied industry and perseverance in thisFirst Operation. It is no wonder, then, that so many students of this Art arereduced to beggary; they are afraid of work, and look upon our Art as mere sportfor their leisure moments. For no labour is more tedious than that which thepreparatory part of our enterprise demands. Morienus earnestly entreats the Kingto consider this fact, and says that many Sages have complained of the tedium ofour work. \"To render a chaotic mass orderly\"' says the Poet, \"is matter of muchtime and labour\" -- and the noble author of the Hermetical Arcanum describes it asan Herculean task. There are so many impurities clinging to our first substance,and a most powerful intermediate agent is required for the purpose of elicitingfrom our polluted menstruum the Royal Diadem. But when you have once preparedyour Mercury, the most formidable part of your task is accomplished, and you mayindulge in that rest which is sweeter than any work, as the Sage says.CHAPTER IXOn the Superiority of our Mercury over All MetalsOur Mercury is that Serpent which devoured the companions of Cadmus, afterhaving first swallowed Cadmus himself, though he was far stronger than they. YetCadmus will one day transfix this Serpent, when he has coagulated it with hisSulphur. Know that this, our Mercury, is a King among metals, and dissolves themby changing their Sulphur into a kindred mercurial substance. The Mercury of one,two, or three eagles bears rule over Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus. The Mercury offrom three to seven eagles sways the Moon; that of ten eagles has power over theSun; our Mercury is nearer than any other unto the first ens of metals; it has powerto enter metallic bodies, and to manifest their hidden depths.CHAPTER XOn the sulphur which is in the Mercury of the SagesIt is a marvellous fact that our Mercury contains active sulphur and yet preservesthe form and all the properties of Mercury. Hence it is necessary that a form beintroduced therein by our preparation, which form is a metallic sulphur. ThisSulphur is the inward fire which causes the putrefaction of the composite Sun. Thissulphureous fire is the spiritual seed which our Virgin (still remaining immaculate)has conceived. For an uncorrupted virginity admits of a spiritual love, asexperience and authority affirm. The two (the passive and the active principle)combined we call our Hermaphrodite. When joined to the Sun, it softens,liquefies, and dissolves it with gentle heat. By means of the same fire it coagulatesitself; and by its coagulation produces the Sun. Our pure and homogeneousMercury, having conceived inward Sulphur (through our Art), coagulates itselfunder the influence of gentle outward heat, like the cream of milk -- a subtleearth floating on the water. When it is united to the Sun, it is not only notcoagulated, but the composite substance becomes softer day by day; the bodiesare almost dissolved; and the spirits begin to be coagulated, with a black colourand a most fetid smell. Hence it appears that this spiritual metallic Sulphur is intruth the moving principle in our Art; it is really volatile or unmatured gold, andby proper digestion is changed into that metal. If joined to perfect gold, it is notcoagulated, but dissolves the corporal gold, and remains with it, being dissolved,under one form, although before the perfect union death must precede, that sothey may he united after death, not simply in a perfect unity, but in a thousandtimes more than perfect perfection.An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (6 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIConcerning the Discovery of the Perfect MagisteryThere are those who think that this Art was first discovered by Solomon, or ratherimparted to him by Divine Revelation. But though there is no reason for doubtingthat so wise and profoundly learned a sovereign was acquainted with our Art, yetwe happen to know that he was not the first to acquire the knowledge. It waspossessed by Hermes, the Egyptian, and some other Sages before him; and we maysuppose that they first sought a simple exaltation of imperfect metals into regalperfection, and that it was at first their endeavour to develop Mercury, which ismost like to gold in its weight and properties, into perfect gold. This, however, nodegree of ingenuity could effect by any fire, and the truth gradually broke on theirminds that an internal heat was required as well as an external one. So theyrejected aqua fortis and all corrosive solvents, after long experiments with thesame -- also all salts, except that kind which is the first substance of all salts,which dissolves all metals and coagulates Mercury, but not without violence,whence that kind of agent is again separated entire, both in weight and virtue,from the things it is applied to. They saw that the digestion of Mercury wasprevented by certain aqueous crudities and earthy dross; and that the radicalnature of these impurities rendered their elimination impossible, except by thecomplete inversion of the whole compound. They knew that Mercury wouldbecome fixed if it could be freed from their defiling presence -- as it containsfermenting sulphur, which is only hindered by these impurities from coagulatingthe whole mercurial body. At length they discovered that Mercury, in the bowels ofthe earth, was intended to become a metal, and that the process of developmentwas only stopped by the impurities with which it had become tainted. They foundthat that which should be active in the Mercury was passive; and that its infirmitycould not be remedied by any means, except the introduction of some kindredprinciple from without. Such a principle they discovered in metallic sulphur, whichstirred up the passive sulphur in the Mercury, and by allying itself with it, expelledthe aforesaid impurities. But in seeking to accomplish this practically, they weremet by another great difficulty. In order that this sulphur might be effectual inpurifying the Mercury, it was indispensable that it should itself be pure. All theirefforts to purify it, however, were doomed to failure. At length they bethoughtthem that it might possibly be found somewhere in Nature in a purified condition-- and their search was crowned with success. They sought active sulphur in a purestate, and found it cunningly concealed in the House of the Ram. This sulphurmingled most eagerly with the offspring of Saturn, and the desired effect wasspeedily produced -- after the malignant venom of the \" air\" of Mercury had beentempered (as already set forth at some length) by the Doves of Venus. Then lifewas joined to life by means of the liquid; the dry was moistened; the passive wasstirred into action by the active; the dead was revived by the living. The heavenswere indeed temporarily clouded over, but after a copious downpour of rain,serenity was restored. Mercury emerged in a hermaphroditic state. Then theyplaced it in the fire; in no long time they succeeded in coagulating it, and in itscoagulation they found the Sun and the Moon in a most pure state. Then theyconsidered that, before its coagulation, this Mercury was not a metal, since, onbeing volatilised, it left no residue at the bottom of the distilling vessel; hencethey called it unmatured gold and their living (or quick) silver It also occurred tothem that if gold were sown, as it were, in the soil of its own first substance, itsexcellence would probably be enhanced; and when they placed gold therein, thefixed was volatilised, the hard softened, the coagulated dissolved, to theamazement of Nature herself. For this reason they wedded these two to eachother, put them in a still over the fire, and for many days regulated the heat inAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (7 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"accordance with the requirements of Nature. Thus the dead was revived, the bodydecayed, and a glorified spirit rose from the grave; the soul was exalted into theQuintessence -- the Universal Medicine for animals, vegetables, and minerals.CHAPTER XIIThe Generic Method of Making the Perfect MagisteryThe greatest secret of our operation is no other than a cohobation of the nature ofone thing above the other, until the most digested virtue be extracted out of thedigested body of the crude one. But there are hereto requisite: Firstly, an exactmeasurement and preparation of the ingredients required; secondly, an exactfulfilment of all external conditions; thirdly a proper regulation of the fire;fourthly, a good knowledge of the natural properties of the substances; and fifthly,patience, in order that the work may not be marred by overgreat haste. Of allthese points we will now speak in their proper order.CHAPTER XIIIOf the Use of Mature Sulphur in the Work of the ElixirWe have spoken of the need of Mercury, and have described its properties moreplainly and straightforwardly than has ever been done before. God knows that wedo not grudge the knowledge of this Art to our brother men; and we are not afraidthat it can ever become the property of any unworthy person. So long as the secretis possessed by a comparatively small number of philosophers, their lot is anythingbut a bright and happy one; surrounded as we are on every side by the cruel greedand -- the prying suspicion of the multitude, we are doomed, like Cain, to wanderover the earth homeless and friendless. Not for us are X the soothing influences ofdomestic happiness; not for us the delightful confidences of friendship. Men whocovet our golden secret pursue us from place to place, and fear closes our lips,when love tempts us to open ourselves freely to a brother. Thus we feel promptedat times to burst forth into the desolate exclamation of Cain: \"Whoever finds mewill slay me.\" Yet we are not the murderers of our brethren; we are anxious onlyto do good to our fellow-men. But even our kindness and charitable compassionare rewarded with black ingratitude- ingratitude that cries to heaven forvengeance. It was only a short time ago that, after visiting the plague-strickenhaunts of a certain city, and restoring the sick to perfect health by means of mymiraculous medicine, I found myself surrounded by a yelling mob, who demandedthat I should give to them my Elixir of the Sages; and it was only by changing mydress and my name, by shaving off my beard and putting on a wig, that I wasenabled to save my life, and escape from the hands of those wicked men. Andeven when our lives are not threatened, it is not pleasant to find-ourselves,wherever we go, the central objects of human greed... I know of several personswho were found strangled in their beds, simply because they were suspected ofpossessing this secret, though, in reality, they knew no more about it than theirmurderers; it was enough for some desperate ruffians, that a mere whisper ofsuspicion had been breathed against their victims. Men are so eager to have thisMedicine that your very caution will arouse their suspicions, and endanger yoursafety. Again, if you desire to sell any large quantity of your gold and silver, youwill be unable to do so without imminent risk of discovery. The very fact thatanyone has a great mass of bullion for sale would in most places excite suspicion.This feeling will be strengthened when people test the quality of our gold; for it ismuch finer and purer than any of the gold which is brought from Barbary, or fromthe Guinea Coast; and our silver is better even than that which is conveyed homeby the Spanish silver fleet. If, in order to baffle discovery, you mix these preciousAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (8 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"metals with alloy, you render yourself liable, in England and- Holland at least, tocapital punishment; for in those countries no one is permitted to tamper with theprecious metals except the officers of the mint, and the licensed goldsmiths. Iremember once going, in the disguise of a foreign merchant to a goldsmith's shop,and offering him 600 pounds worth of our pure silver for sale. He subjected it tothe usual tests, and then said: \"This silver is artificially prepared.\" When I askedhim why he thought so, his answer was: \"I am not a novice in my profession, andknow very well the exact quality of the silver which is brought from the differentmines.\" When I heard these words I took myself away with great secrecy anddispatch, leaving the silver in the hands of the goldsmith. On this account, and byreason of the many and great difficulties which beset us, the possessors of thisStone, on every side, we do elect to remain hidden, and will communicate the Artto those who are worthily covetous of our secrets, and then mark what public goodwill befall. Without Sulphur, our Mercury would never be properly coagulated forour supernatural work; it is the male substance, while Mercury may be called thefemale; and all Sages say that no tincture can be made without its latten, whichlatten is gold, without any double speaking. Wise men, notwithstanding, can findthis substance even on the dunghill; but the ignorant are unable to discern it evenin gold. The tincture of gold is concealed in the gold of the Sages, which is themost highly matured of bodies; but as a raw material it exists only in our Mercury;and it (gold) receives from Mercury the multiplication of its seed, but in virtuerather than in weight. The Sages say that common gold is dead, while their's isliving; and common gold is dead in the same sense in which a grain of wheat isdead, while it is surrounded by dry air; and comes to life, swells, softens, andgerminates only when it is put into moist earth. In this sense gold, too, is dead, solong as it is surrounded by the corporeal husk, always allowing, of course, for thegreat difference between a vegetable grain and metallic gold. Our grain isquickened in water only; and as wheat, while it remains in the barn is called grain,and is not destined to be quickened, because it is to be used for bread making --but changes its name, when it is sown in the field, and is then called seedcorn; soour gold, while it is in the form of rings, plate, and coins, is called common gold,because in that state it is likely to remain unchanged to the end of the world; butpotentially it is even then the gold of the Sages, because if sown in its own properelement, it would in a few days become the Chaos of the Sages. Hence the Sagesbid you revive the dead (i.e., the gold which already appeared doomed to a livingdeath) and mortify the living, i.e., the Mercury which, imparting life to the gold, isitself deprived of the vital principle. Their gold is taken in a dead, their water in aliving, state, and by their composition and brief coction, the dead gold revives andthe living Mercury dies, i.e., the spirit is coagulated, the body is dissolved, andthus both putrefy together, until all the members of the compound are torn intoatoms. The mystery of our Art, which we conceal with so great care, is thepreparation of the Mercury, which above ground is not to be found made ready toour hand. But when it is prepared, it is \"our water\" in which gold is dissolved,whereby the latent life of the gold is set free, and receives the life of thedissolving Mercury, which is to gold what good earth is to the grain of wheat. Whenthe gold has putrefied in the Mercury, there arises out of the decomposition ofdeath a new body, of the same essence, but of a glorified substance. Here youhave the whole of our Philosophy in a nutshell. There is no secret about it, exceptthe preparation of Mercury, its mingling with the gold in the right proportions, andthe regulation of the fire in accordance with its requirements. Gold by itself doesnot fear the fire; hence the great point is, to temper the heat to the capacity ofthe Mercury. If the Mercury is not properly prepared, the gold remains commongold, being joined with an improper agent; it continues unchanged, and no degreeAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (9 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"of heat will help it to put off its corporeal nature. Without our Mercury the seed(i.e., gold) cannot be sown; and if gold is not sown in its proper element, it cannotbe quickened any more than the corn which the West Indians keep underground, inair-tight stone jars, can germinate. I know that some self-constituted \"Sages\" willtake exception to this teaching, and say that common gold and running Mercuryare not the substance of our Stone. But one question will suffice to silence theirobjections: Have they ever actually prepared our Tincture? I have prepared it morethan once, and daily have it in my power; hence I may perhaps be permitted tospeak as one having authority. Go on babbling about your rain water collected inMay, your Salts, your sperm which is more potent than the foul fiend himself, yeself-styled philosophers; rail at me, if you like; all you say is conclusively refutedby this one fact -- you cannot make the Stone. When I say that gold and Mercuryare the only substances of our Stone I know what I am writing about; and theSearcher of all hearts knows also that I say true. The time has arrived when wemay speak more freely about this Art. For Elias the artist is at hand, and gloriousthings are already spoken of the City of God. I possess wealth sufficient to buy thewhole world -- but as yet I may not use it on account of the craft and cruelty ofwicked men. It is not from jealousy that I conceal as much as I do: God knows thatI am weary of this lonely, wandering life, shut out from the bonds of friendship,and almost from the face of God. I do not worship the golden calf, before whichour Israelites bow low to the ground; let it be ground to powder like the brazenserpent. I hope that in a few years gold (not as given by God, but as abused byman) will be so common that those who are now so mad after it, shallcontemotuously spurn aside this bulwark of Antichrist. Then will tie day of ourdeliverance be at hand when the streets of the new Jerusalem are paved withgold, and its gates are made of great diamonds. The day is at hand when, bymeans of this my Book, gold will have become as common as dirt; when we Sagesshall find rest for the soles of our feet, and render fervent thanks to God. My heartconceives unspeakable things, and is enlarged for the good of the Israel of God.These words I utter forth with a herald's clarion tones. My Book is the precursor ofElias, designed to prepare the Royal way of the Master; and would to God that byits means all men might become adepts in our Art -- for then gold, the great idol ofmankind, would lose its value, and we should prize it only for its scientificteaching. Virtue would be loved for its own sake. I am familiar with manypossessors of this Art who regard silence as the great point of honour. But I havebeen enabled by God to take a different view of the matter; and I firmly believethat I can best serve the Israel of God, and put my talent out at usury, by makingthis secret knowledge the common property of the whole world. Hence I have notconferred with flesh and blood, nor attempted to obtain the consent of my BrotherSages. If the matter succeeds according to my desire and prayer, they will allrejoice that I have published this Book.CHAPTER XIVOf the Circumstantial and Accidental Requisites of our ArtWe have weeded out all vulgar errors concerning our Art, and have shewn that goldand Mercury are the only substances required. We have shewn that this gold is tobe understood, not metaphorically, but in a truly philosophical sense. We have alsodeclared our Mercury to be true quicksilver, without any ambiguity of acceptation.The latter, we have told you, must be made by art, and be a key to the former.We have made everything as clear as noonday; and our teaching is based, not onhearsay, or on the writings of others, but on our own personal and oft repeatedexperience. The things we faithfully declare are what we have both seen andknown. We have made and do possess the Stone -- the great Elixir. Moreover, weAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (10 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"do not grudge you this knowledge, but wish you to attain it out of this Book. Wehave spoken out more plainly than any of our predecessors; and our Receipt, apartfrom the fact that we have not called things by their proper names, is perfectlytrustworthy. It remains for us to give you some practical tests by which thegoodness or unsuitableness of your Mercury may be known. and some directions foramending its defects. When you have living Mercury and gold, there remains to beaccomplished, first, the purging of the Mercury and the gold, then their espousal,and finally the regulation of the fire.CHAPTER XVOf the Incidental Purging of Mercury and GoldPerfect gold is found in the bowels of the earth in little pieces, or in sand. If youcan meet with this unmixed gold, it is pure enough; if not, purge it with antimonyor royal cement, or boil it with aqua fortis, the gold being first granulated. Thensmelt it, remove the impure sediment, and it is ready. But Mercury needs inwardand essential purging. which radical cleansing is brought about by the addition oftrue Sulphur, little by little, according to the number of the Eagles. Then it alsoneeds an incidental purgation for the purpose of removing from its surface theimpurities which have, by the essential purgation, been ejected from the centre.This process is not absolutely necessary, but it is useful, as it accelerates thework. Therefore, take your Mercury, which you have purified with a suitablenumber of Eagles, sublime it three times with common salt and iron filings, andwash it with vinegar and a moderate quantity of salts of ammonia, then dry anddistil in a glass retort, over a gradually increasing fire, until the whole of theMercury has ascended. Repeat this four times, then boil the Mercury in spirits ofvinegar for an hour, stirring it constantly. Then pour off the vinegar, and wash offits acidity by a plentiful effusion of spring water. Dry the Mercury, and itssplendour will be wonderful. You may wash it with wine, or vinegar and salt, andso spare the sublimation; but then distil it at least four times without addition,after you have perfected all the eagles, or washings, washing the chalybeat retortevery time with ashes and water; then boil it in distilled vinegar for half a day,stirring it strongly at times. Pour off the blackish vinegar, add new, then wash withwarm water. This process is designed to purge away the internal impurities fromthe surface. These impurities you may perceive if, on mixing Mercury with purestgold, you place the amalgam on a white sheet of paper. The sooty blackness whichis then seen on the paper is purged away by this process.CHAPTER XVIOf the Amalgam of Mercury and Gold, and of their respective ProportionsWhen you have done all this, take one part of pure and laminated gold, or finegold filings, and two parts of Mercury; put them in a heated (marble) jar, i.e.,heaved with boiling water, being taken out of which it dries quickly, and holds theheat a long time. Grind with an ivory, or glass, or stone, or iron, or boxwood pestle(the iron pestle is not so good; I use a pestle of crystal): pound them, I say, assmall as the painters grind their colours; then add water so as to make the mass asconsistent as half melted butter. The mixture should be fixable and soft, andpermit itself to be moulded into little globules -- like moderately soft butter; itshould be of such a consistency as to yield to the gentlest touch. Moreover, itshould be of the same temperature throughout, and one part should not be moreliquid than another. The mixture will be more or less soft, according to theproportion of Mercury which it contains; but it must be capable of forming intothose little globules, and the Mercury should not be more lively at the bottom thanAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (11 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"at the top. If the amalgam be left undisturbed, it will at once harden; you musttherefore judge of the merits of the mixture, while you are stirring it; if it fulfilsthe above conditions, it is good Then take spirit of vinegar, and dissolve in it athird part of salt of ammonia, put the amalgam into this liquid, let the whole boilfor a quarter-of-an-hour in a long necked glass vessel; then take the mixture out ofthe glass vessel, pour off the liquid, heat the mortar, and pound the amalgam (asabove) vigorously, and wash away all blackness with hot water. Put it again intothe liquid, let it boil up once more in the glass vessel, pound it as before, andwash it. Repeat this process until the blackness is entirely purged out. Theamalgam will then be as brilliant and white as the purest silver. Once moreregulate the temperature of the amalgam according to the rules given above; yourlabour will be richly rewarded. If the amalgam be not quite soft enough, add alittle Mercury. Then boil it in pure water, and free it from all saltness and acidity.Pour off the water, and dry the amalgam. Make quite sure that it is thoroughlydried, by waving it to and fro on the point of a knife over a sheet of white paper.CHAPTER XVIIConcerning the Size, Form, Material, and Mode of Securing the VesselLet your glass distilling vessel be round or oval; large enough to hold neither morenor much less than an ounce of distilled water in the body thereof. Let the heightof the vessel's neck be about one palm, hand-breath, or span, and let the glass beclear and thick (the thicker the better, so long as it is clear and clean, and permitsyou to distinguish what is going on within) -- but the thickness should be uniform.The substance which will go into this vessel consists of 1/2 oz. of gold, and one oz.of mercury; and if you have to add 1/3 oz. of mercury, the whole compound willstill be less than 2 oz. The glass should be strong in order to prevent the vapourswhich arise from our embryo bursting the vessel. Let the mouth of the vessel bevery carefully and effectually secured by means of a thick layer of sealing-wax.The utensils and the materials required are not then very expensive -- and if youuse my thick distilling-vessel you will avoid loss by breakage. The otherinstruments that are requisite are not dear. I know that many will take exceptionto this statement; they will say that the pursuit of our Art is a matter of all butruinous expense. But my answer consists in a simple question: What is the objectof our Art? Is it not to make the Philosopher's Stone -- to find the liquid in whichgold melts like ice in tepid water? And do those good people who are so eager intheir search after \"Mercury of the Sun,\" and \"Mercury of the Moon,\" and who pay sohigh a price for their materials, ever succeed in this object? They cannot answerthis question in the affirmative. One florin will buy enough of the substance of ourwater to quicken two pounds of mercury, and make it the true Mercury of theSages. But, of course, glass vessels, coals, earthen vessels, a furnace, iron vessels,and other instruments, cannot be bought for nothing. Without a perfect body, ourore, viz., gold, there can be no Tincture, and our Stone is at first vile, immature,and volatile, but when complete it is perfect, precious, and fixed. These twoaspects of our Stone are the body, gold, and the spirit, or quicksilver.CHAPTER XVIIIOf the Furnace or Athanor of the SagesI have spoken about Mercury, Sulphur, the vessel, their treatment, etc. etc.; and,of course, all these things are to be understood with a grain of salt. You mustunderstand that in the preceding chapters I have spoken metaphorically; if youtake my words in a literal sense, you will reap no harvest except your outlay. Forinstance, when I name the principal substances Mercury and gold -- I do not meanAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (12 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"common gold in the state in which it is sold at the goldsmiths -- but it must beprepared by means of our Art You may find our gold in common gold and silver, butit is easier to make the Stone than to get its first substance out of common gold.\"Our gold\" is the Chaos whose soul has not been taken away by fire. The soul ofcommon gold has retired before the fiery tyranny of Vulcan into the inmostcitadel. If you seek our gold in a substance intermediate between perfection andimperfection, you will find it: but otherwise, you must unbar the gates of commongold by the first preparatory process (ch. xv.), by which the charm of its body isbroken, and the husband enabled to do his work. If you choose the former course,you shall use only gentle heat; in the latter case, you will require a fierce fire. Buthere you will be hopelessly lost in a labyrinth, if you do not know your way out ofit. But whether you choose our gold, or common gold, you will in either case needan even and continual fire. If you take our gold, you will finish the work a fewmonths sooner, and the Elixir will be ten times more precious than that preparedfrom common gold. If you work with \"our gold,\" you will be assisted in itscalcination, putrefaction, and dealbation by its gentle inward (natural) heat. Butin the case of common gold, this heat has to be applied externally by foreignsubstances, so as to render it fit for union with the Virgin's Milk. In neither case,however, can anything be effected without the aid of fire. It was not, then, in vainthat Hermes counts fire next to the Sun and Moon as the governor of the work. Butthis is to be under stood of the truly secret furnace, which a vulgar eye never saw.There is also another furnace, which is called our common furnace, made ofpotter's earth, or of iron and brass plates, well compacted with clay. This furnacewe call Athanor, and the shape which I like best is that of a tower with a \"nest\" atthe top. The \"tower\" should be about three feet high, and nine fingers wide withinthe plates. A little above the ground, let there be a little opening of about threeor four fingers wide, for removing the cinders; over that, there should be afire-place built with stones. Above this, we place the furnace itself, which shouldbe such as to exclude all draughts and currents of air. The coals are put in fromabove, and the aperture should then be carefully closed. But it is not necessarythat your furnace should exactly correspond to the description which I have givenso long as it fulfils the following conditions: firstly, it must be free from draughts;secondly, it must enable you to vary the temperature, without removing yourvessel; thirdly, you must be able to keep up in it a fire for ten or twelve hours,without looking to it. Then the door of our Art will be opened to you; and whenyou have prepared the Stone, you may procure a small portable stove, for thepurpose of multiplying it.CHAPTER XIXOf the Progress of the Work during the First Forty DaysWhen you have prepared our gold and Mercury in the manner described, put it intoour vessel, and subject it to the action of our fire; within 40 days you will see thewhole substance converted into atoms, without any visible motion, or perceptibleheat (except that it is just warm). If you do not yet rightly know the meaning of\"our gold,\" take one part of common gold (well purified), and three parts of ourMercury (thoroughly purged), put them together as directed (cap. xvi), place themover the fire, and there keep them at the boiling point, till they sweat, and theirsweat circulates. At the end of 90 days you will find that the Mercury hasseparated and reunited all the elements of the common gold. Boil the mixture 50days longer, and you will discover that our Mercury has changed the common goldinto \"our gold,\" which is the Medicine of the first order. It is already our Sulphur,but it has not yet the power of tinging. This method has been followed by manyAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (13 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:28]"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Sages, but it is exceedingly slow and tedious, and is only for the rich of the earth.Moreover, when you have got this Sulphur do not think that you possess the Stone,but only its true Matter, which you may seek in an imperfect thing, and find itwithin a week, by our easy yet rare way, reserved of God for His poor, contemned,and abject saints. Hereof I have now determined to write much, although in thebeginning of this Book I decreed to bury it in silence. This is the one great sophismof all adepts; some speak of this common gold and silver, and say the truth, andothers say that we cannot use it, and they too, say the truth. But in the presenceof God I will call all our adepts to account, and charge them with jealous surliness.I, too, had determined to tread the same path, but God's hand confounded myscheme. I say then, that both ways are true, and come to the same thing in theend -- but there is a vast difference at the beginning. Our whole Art consists in theright preparation of our Mercury and our gold. Our Mercury is our way, and withoutit nothing is effected. Our gold is not common gold, but it may be found in it; andif you operate on our Mercury with common gold (regulating the fire in the rightway), you will after 150 days have our gold, since our gold is obtained from ourMercury. Hence if common gold have all its atoms thoroughly severed by means ofour Mercury, and then reunited by the same agency, the whole mixture will, underthe influence of fire, become our gold. But, if, without this preparatory purging,you were to use common gold with our Mercury for the purpose of preparing theStone, you would be sadly mistaken; and this is the great Labyrinth in which mostbeginners go astray, because the Sages in writing of these ways as two ways,purposely obscure the fact that they are only one way (though of course the one ismore direct than the other). The gold of the Sages may then be prepared out ofour common gold and our Mercury, from which there may afterwards be obtainedby repeated liquefactions, Sulphur and Quicksilver which is incombustible, andtinges all things else. In this sense, our Stone is to be found in all metals andminerals, since our gold may be got from them all -- but most easily, of course,from gold and silver. Some have found it in tin, some in lead, but most of thosewho have pursued the more tedious method, have found it in gold. Of course, ifour gold be prepared in the way I have described, out of common gold (in thecourse of 150 days), instead of being found ready made, it will not be so effectual,and the preparation of the Stone will take 1 1/2 years instead of 7 months. I knowboth ways, and prefer the shorter one; but I have described the longer one as wellin order that I may not draw down upon myself the scathing wrath of the \"Sages.\"The great difficulty which discourages all beginners is not of Nature's making: theSages have created it by speaking of the longer operation when they mean theshorter one, and vice versa. If you choose common gold, you should espouse it toVenus (copper), lay them together on the bridal bed, and, on bringing a fierce fireto bear on them, you will see an emblem of the Great Work in the followingsuccession of colours: black, the peacock's tail, white, orange, and red. Thenrepeat the same operation with Mercury (called Virgin's Milk), using the \"fire of theBath of Dew,\" and (towards the end) sand mixed with ashes. The substance willfirst turn a much deeper black, and then a completer white and red. Hence if youknow our Art, extract our gold from our Mercury (this is the shorter way), and thusperform the whole operation with one substance (viz., Mercury); if you can do this,you will have attained to the perfection of philosophy. In this method, there is nosuperfluous trouble: the whole work, from beginning to end, is based upon onebroad foundation -- whereas if you take common gold, you must operate on twosubstances, and both will have to be purified by an elaborate process. If youdiligently consider what I have said, you have in your hand a means of unravellingall the apparent contradictions of the Sages. They speak of three operations: thefirst, by which the inward natural heat expels all cold through the aid of externalAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (14 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"fire, the second, wherein gold is purged with our Mercury, through the mediationof Venus, and under the influence of a fierce fire; the third, in which common goldis mixed with our Mercury, and the ferment of Sulphur added. But if you willreceive my advice, you will not be put out by any wilful obscurity on the part ofthe Sages. Our sulphur you should indeed strive to discover; and if God enlightensyou, you will find it in our Mercury. Before the living God I swear that my teachingis true. If you operate on Mercury and pure common gold, you may find \"our gold\"in 7 to 9 months, and \"our silver\" in 5 months. But when you have these, you havenot yet prepared our Stone: that glorious sight will not gladden your eyes until youhave been at work for a year-and-a-half. By that time you may obtain the elixir bysubjecting the substance to very gentle continuous heat.CHAPTER XXOf the Appearance of Blackness in the Work of the Sun and MoonIf you operate on gold and silver, for the purpose of finding our Sulphur, let yoursubstance first become like a thin paste, or boiling water, or liquid pitch; for theoperation of our gold and Mercury is prefigured by that which happens in thepreparation of common gold with our Mercury. Take your substance and place it inthe furnace, regulate the fire properly for the space of twenty days, in which timeyou will observe various colours, and about the end of the fourth week, if the firebe continuous, you will see a most amiable greenness, which will last for about tendays. Then rejoice, for in a short time it will be as a black coal, and your wholecompound shall be reduced to atoms. The operation is a resolution of the fixedinto the not fixed that both afterwards, being conjoined, may make one matter,partly spiritual and partly corporal. Once more, I assure you, the regulation of thefire is the only thing that I have hidden from you. Given the proper-regimen, takethe Stone, govern it as you know how, and then these wonderful phenomena willfollow: The fire will at once dissolve the Mercury and the Sulphur like wax; theSulphur will be burnt, and change its colours from day to day; the Mercury willprove incombustible, and only be gradually tinged (and purified, without beinginfected) with the colours of the Sulphur. Let the heaven stoop to the earth, tillthe latter has conceived heavenly seed. When you see the substances mingle inyour distilling vessel, and assume the appearance of clotted and burnt blood, besure that the female has received the seed of the male. About seventeen daysafterwards your substance will begin to wear a yellow, thick, misty, or foamyappearance. At this time, you must take care not to let the embryo escape fromyour vessel; for it will give out a greenish, yellow, black, and bluish vapour andstrive to burst the vessel. If you allow these vapours (which are continuous whenthe Embryo is formed) to escape, your work will be hopelessly marred. Nor shouldyou allow any of the odour to make its way through any little hole or outlet; forthe evaporation would considerably weaken the strength of the Stone. Hence thetrue Sage seals up the mouth of his vessel most carefully. Let me advise you,moreover, not to neglect your fire, or move or open the vessel, or slacken theprocess of decoction, until you find that the quantity of the liquid begins todiminish; if this happens after thirty days, rejoice, and know that you are on theright road. Then be doubly careful, and you will, at the end of another fortnight,find that the earth has become quite dry and of a deep black. This is the death ofthe compound; the winds have ceased, and there is a great calm. This is that greatsimultaneous eclipse of the Sun and Moon, when the Sea also has disappeared. OurChaos is then ready, from which, at the bidding of God, all the wonders of theworld may successively emerge.An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (15 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIOf the Caution required to avoid Burning the FlowersThe burning of the flowers is fatal, yet soon committed: it is chiefly to be guardedagainst after the lapse of the third week. In the beginning there is so muchmoisture that if the fire be too fierce it will dry up the liquid too quickly, and youwill prematurely obtain a dry red powder, from which the principle of life hasflown; if the fire be not strong enough the substance will not be properly matured.Too powerful a fire prevents the true union of the substances. True union onlytakes place in water. Bodies collide, but do not unite; only liquids (and spirits) cantruly mingle their substance. Hence our homogeneous metallic water must beallowed to do its work properly, and should not be dried up, until this perfectmutual absorption has taken place in a natural manner. Premature drying onlydestroys the germ of life, strikes the active principle on the head as with ahammer, and renders it passive. A red powder is indeed produced, but long beforethe time: for redness should be preceded by blackness. It is true that, in thebeginning of our work, when heaven is wedded to earth, and earth conceives thefire of nature, a red colour does appear. But the substance is then sufficientlymoist; and the redness soon gives way to a green colour, which in its turn graduallyyields to blackness. Do not be in a hurry; let your fire be just powerful enough, butnot too powerful; steer a straight course between Scylla and Charybdis: you willbehold in your vessel a variety of colours and grotesque transformations -- untilthe substance settles down into a powder of intense blackness. This should happenwithin the first fifty days. If it does not, either your Mercury, or the regulation ofyour fire, or the composition of your substance is at fault -- if, indeed, you havenot moved or shaken your glass vessel.CHAPTER XXIIOf the Regimen of SaturnAll the Sages who have written on our Art, have spoken of the work and regimen ofSaturn; and their remarks have led many to choose common lead as the substanceof the Stone. But you should know that our Saturn, or lead, is a much noblersubstance than gold. It is the living earth in which the soul of gold is joined toMercury, that they may bring forth Adam and his wife Eve. Wherefore, since thehighest has so lowered itself as to become the lowest, we may expect that itsblood may be the means of redeeming all its brethren. The Tomb in which our Kingis buried, is that which we call Saturn, and it is the key of the work oftransmutation; happy is he who can salute this planet, and call it by its rightname. It is a boon which is obtained by the blessing of God alone; it is not of himthat willeth, or of him that runneth; but God bestoweth it on whom He will.CHAPTER XXIIIOf the different Regimens of this WorkLet me assure you that in our whole work there is nothing hidden but the regimen,of which it was truly said by the Sage that whoever knows it perfectly will behonoured by princes and potentates. I tell you plainly that if this one point wereclearly set forth, our Art would become mere women's work and child's play: therewould be nothing in it but a simple process of \"cooking.\" Hence it has always beenmost carefully concealed by the Sages. But I have determined to write in a moresympathetic and kindly spirit: know then that our regimen throughout consists incoction and digestion, but that it implies a good many other processes, whichthose jealous Sages have made to appear different by describing them underAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (16 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"different names. But we intend to speak more openly in regard to this subject.CHAPTER XXIVOf the First Regimen, which is that of MercuryThis first regimen has been studiously kept secret by all the Sages. They havespoken of the second regimen, or that of Saturn, as if it were the first, and havethus left the student without guidance in those operations which precede theappearance of that intense blackness. Count Bernard, of Trevisa, says, in hisParable, that When the King has come to the Fountain, he takes off the goldengarment, gives it to Saturn, and enters the bath alone, afterwards receiving fromSaturn a robe of black silk. But he does not tell us how long it takes to put off thatgolden robe; and thus, like all his brethren, leaves the poor beginner to grope inthe dark during 40 or 50 days. From the point where the stage of blackness isreached to the end of the work their directions are more full and intelligible. It isin regard to these first 40 days that the student requires additional light. Thisperiod represents the regimen of Mercury (of the Sages), which is alone activeduring the whole time, the other substance being temporarily dead. You shouldnot suffer yourself to be deluded into the belief that when your matters arejoined, namely, our Sun and Mercury, the \"setting of the Sun\" can be brought aboutin a few days. We ourselves waited a tedious time before a reconciliation wasmade between the fire and the water. As a matter of fact, the Sages have calledthe substance, throughout this first period, Rebis, or Two-thing: to shew that theunion is not effected till the operation is complete. You should know, then, thatthough our Mercury consumes the Sun, yet a year after you shall separate them,unless they are connected together by a suitable degree of fire. It is not able to doanything at all without fire. We must not suppose that when our gold is placed inour Mercury it is swallowed up by it in the twinkling of an eye. This conceptionrests on a misunderstanding of Count Bernard's teaching about the King's plunge inthe fountain. But the solution of gold is a more difficult matter than these gentryappear to have any idea of. It requires the highest skill so to regulate the fire inthe first stage of the work as to solve the bodies without injuring the tincture.Attend to my teaching therefore. Take the body which I have shewed you, put itinto the water of our sea, and bring to bear on the compound the proper degree ofheat, till dews and mists begin to ascend, and the moisture is diminished night andday without intermission. Know that at first the two do not affect each other atall, and that only in course of time the body absorbs some of the water, and thuscauses each to partake of the other's nature. Only part of the water is sublimed;the rest gradually penetrates the pores of the body, which are thereby more andmore softened, till the soul of the gold is enabled gently to pass out. Through themediation of the soul the body is reconciled and united to the spirit, and theirunion is signalized by the appearance of the black colour. The whole operationlasts about 40-50 days, and is called the Regimen of Mercury, because the body ispassive throughout, and the spirit, or Mercury, brings about all the changes ofcolour, which begin to appear about the 20th day, and gradually intensify till all beat last completed in black of the deepest dye, which the both day will manifest.CHAPTER XXVThe Regimen of the Second Part, which is that of SaturnThe Regimen of Mercury, the operation whereof despoils the King of his goldengarments, is followed by the Regimen of Saturn. When the Lion dies the Crow isborn. The substance has now become of a uniform colour, namely, as black aspitch, and neither vapours, or winds, or any other signs of life are seen; the wholeAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (17 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"is dry as dust, with the exception of some pitch-like substance, which now andthen bubbles up; all presents an image of eternal death. Nevertheless, it is a sightwhich gladdens the heart of the Sage. For the black colour which is seen is brightand brilliant; and if you behold something like a thin paste bubbling up here andthere, you may rejoice. For it is the work of the quickening spirit, which will soonrestore the dead bodies to life. The regulation of the fire is a matter of greatimportance at this juncture; if you make it too fierce, and thus cause sublimationat this stage, everything will be irrecoverably spoilt. Be content, therefore, toremain, as it were, in prison for forty days and nights, even as was the goodTrevisan, and employ only gentle heat. Let your delicate substance remain at thebottom, which is the womb of conception, in the sure hope that after the timeappointed by the Creator for this Operation, the spirit will arise in a glorifiedstate, and glorify its body -- that it will ascend and be gently circulated from thecentre to the heavens, then descend to the centre from the heavens, and take toitself the power of things above and things below.CHAPTER XXVIOf the Regimen of JupiterBlack Saturn is succeeded by Jupiter, who exhibits divers colours. For after theputrefaction and conception, which has taken place at the bottom of the vessel,there is once more a change of colours and a circulating sublimation. This Reign orRegimen, lasts only three weeks. During this period you see all conceivable coloursconcerning which no definite account can be given. The \"showers\" that fall willbecome more numerous as the close of this reign approaches, and its terminationis signalized by the appearance of a snowy white streaky deposit on the sides ofthe vessel. Rejoice, then, for you have successfully accomplished the regimen ofJupiter. What you must be particularly careful about in this operation, is toprevent the young ones of the Crow from going back to the nest when they haveonce left it; secondly, to let your earth get neither too dry by an immoderatesublimation of the moisture, nor yet to swamp and smother it with the moisture.These ends will be attained by the proper regulation of the outward heat.CHAPTER XXVIIOf the Regimen of the MoonWhen the Reign of Jupiter comes to an end (towards the close of the fourthmonth) you will see the sign of the waxing moon (Crescent), and know that thewhole Reign of Jupiter was devoted to the purification of the Laton. Themundifying spirit is very pure and brilliant, but the body that has to be cleansed isintensely black. While it passes from blackness to whiteness, a great variety ofcolours are observed; nor is it at once perfectly white; at first it is simply white --afterwards it is of a dazzling, snowy splendour. Under this Reign the whole masspresents the appearance of liquid quicksilver. This is called the sealing of themother in the belly of the infant whom she bears; and its intermediate colours aremore white than black, just as in the Reign of Jupiter they were more black thanwhite. The Reign of the Moon lasts just three weeks; but before its close, thesubstance exhibits a great variety of forms; it will become liquid, and againcoagulate a hundred times a day; sometimes it will present the appearance offishes' eyes, and then again of tiny silver trees, with twigs and leaves. Wheneveryou look at it you will have cause for astonishment, particularly when you see it alldivided into beautiful but very minute grains of silver, like the rays of the Sun.This is the White Tincture, glorious to behold, but nothing in respect of what itmay become.An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (18 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXVIIIOf the Regimen of VenusThe substance, if left in the same vessel, will once more become volatile and(though already perfect in its way) will undergo another change. But if you take itout of the vessel, and after allowing it to cool, put it into another, you will not beable to make anything of it. In this Reign you should also give careful attention toyour fire. For the perfect Stone is fusible and if the fire be too powerful thesubstance will become glazed, and unsusceptible of any further change. This\"vitrification\" of the substance may happen at any time from the middle of theReign of the Moon to the tenth day of the Reign of Venus, and should be carefullyguarded against. The heat should be gentle so as to melt the compound very slowlyand gradually; it will then raise bubbles, and receive a spirit that will rise upward,carrying the Stone with it, and imparting to it new colours, especially acopper-green colour, which endures for some time, and does not quite disappeartill the twentieth day; the next change is to blue and livid, and at the close of thisReign the colour is a pale purple. DO not irritate the spirit too much -- it is morecorporeal than before, and if you sublime it to the top of the vessel, it will hardlyreturn. The same caution should be observed in the Reign of the Moon, when thesubstance begins to thicken. The law is one of mildness, and not of violence, lesteverything should rise to the top of the vessel, and be consumed or vitrified to theruin of the whole work. When you see the green colour, know that the substancenow contains the germ of its highest life. DO not turn the greenness into blacknessby immoderate heat. This Reign is maintained for forty days.CHAPTER XXIXOf the Regimen of MarsWhen the Regimen of Venus is over, and therein has appeared the philosophicaltree, with all its branches and leaves, the Reign of Mars begins with a light yellow,or dirty brown colour, but at last exhibits the transitory hues of the Rainbow, andthe Peacock's Tail. At this stage the compound is drier, and often shews like ahyacinth with a tinge of gold. The mother being now sealed in her infant's belly,swells and is purified, but because of the present great purity of the compound, noputridness can have place in this regimen, but Some obscure colours are chiefactors, while some middle colours come and go, and they are pleasant to look on.Our Virgin Earth is now undergoing the last degree of its cultivation, and is gettingready to receive and mature the fruit of the Sun. Hence you should Weep up amoderate temperature; then there will be seen, about the thirtieth day of thisReign, an orange colour, which, within two weeks from its first appearance, willtinge the whole substance with its own hue.CHAPTER XXXOf the Regimen of the SunAs you are now approaching the end of the work, the substance receives a goldentinge, and the Virgin's Milk which you give your substance to drink has assumed adeep orange colour. Pray to God to keep you from haste and impatience at thisstage of the work; consider that you have now waited for seven months, and thatit would be foolish to let one hour rob you of the fruits of all your labour.Therefore be more and more careful the nearer you approach perfection.

Soon the body below becomes tinged with violetAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (19 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"and a darkish purple. At the end of fourteen or fifteen days, the substance will be,for the most part, humid and ponderous, and yet the wind still bears it in itswomb. Towards the 26th day of the Reign it will begin to get dry, and to becomeliquid and solid in turn (about a hundred times a day); then it becomes granulated;then again it is welded together into one mass, and so it goes on changing forabout a fortnight At length, however, an unexpectedly glorious light will burstfrom your substance, and the end will arrive three days afterwards. The substancewill be granulated, like atoms of gold (or motes in the Sun), and turn a deep red -ared the intensity of which makes it seem black like very pure blood in a clottedstate. This is the Great Wonder of Wonders, which has not its like on earth.CHAPTER XXXIOf the Fermentation of the StoneI forgot to warn you in the last chapter to be on your guard against the danger ofvitrification; too fierce a fire would render your substance insoluble and preventits granulation. You now possess the incombustible red Sulphur which can nolonger be affected in any way by fire. In order to obtain the Elixir from thisSulphur by reiterate solution and coagulation, take three parts of purest gold, andone part of this fiery Sulphur. Melt the gold in a clean crucible, and then cast yourSulphur into it (protecting it well from the smoke of the coals) Make them liquidtogether, when you will obtain a beautiful mass of a deep red, though hardlytransparent. This you should permit to cool, and pound into a small powder. Ofthis powder take one part, and two parts of our Mercury; mix them well, and putthem in a glass vessel, well sealed. They should be exposed to gentle heat for twomonths. This is the true fermentation, which may be repeated if needful.CHAPTER XXXIIThe Imbibition of the StoneMany authors take fermentation in this work for the invisible external agent, whichthey call ferment; by its virtue the fugitive and subtle spirits, without laying on ofhands, are of their own accord thickened, and our before-mentioned fermentationthey call cibation with bread and milk. But I follow my own judgment There isanother operation, called Imbibition of the Stone, by which its quantity ratherthan its quality is increased. It is this: Add to three parts of your perfect Sulphur(either white or red) one part of water, and after six or seven days' coction thewater will become thick like the Sulphur Add again as much water as you didbefore; and when this is dried up, with a convenient fire, add three distinct timesso much water as shall be equal to one-third of the original quantity of Sulphur.Then add (for the 7th imbibition) five parts of water (the parts being equal to theoriginal parts of the Sulphur). Seal up the vessel; subject it to gentle coction, andlet the compound pass through all the different Reigns of the original Substance,which will be accomplished in a month. Then you have the true Stone of the thirdorder, one part of which will perfectly tinge 1,000 parts of any other metal.CHAPTER XXXIIIThe Multiplication of the StoneTake the perfect Stone; add one part of it to three or four parts of purifiedMercury of our first work, subject it to gentle coction for seven days (the vesselbeing carefully sealed up), and let it pass through all the Reigns, which it will dovery quickly and smoothly. The tinging power of the substance will thus be exalteda thousandfold; and if you go through the whole process a second time (which youAn Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (20 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"can do with ease in three days) the Medicine will be much more precious still. Thisyou may repeat as often as you like; the third time the substance will run throughall the Reigns in a day, the fourth time in a single hour, and so on -- and theimprovement in its quality will be most marvellous. Then kneel down and renderthanks to God for this precious treasure.CHAPTER XXXIVOf ProjectionTake four parts of your perfect Stone, either red or white (of both for theMedicine): melt them in a clean crucible. Take one part of this pulverisablemixture to ten parts of purified Mercury; heat the Mercury till it begins to crackle,then throw in your mixture, which will pierce it in the twinkling of an eye;increase your fire till it be melted, and you will have a Medicine of an inferiororder. Take one part of this, and add it to a large quantity of well purged andmelted metal, which will thereby be transmuted into the purest silver or gold(according as you have taken white or red Sulphur). Note that it is better to use agradual projection, for otherwise there may be a notable loss of the Medicine. Thebetter the metals are purged and refined, the quicker and more complete will thetransmutation be.CHAPTER XXXVOf the Manifold uses of this ArtHe that has once found this Art, can have nothing else in all the world to wish for,than that he may be allowed to serve his God in peace and safety. He will not carefor pomp or dazzling outward show. But if he lived a thousand years, and dailyentertained a million people, he could never come to want, since he has at handthe means of indefinitely multiplying the Stone both in weight and virtue, and thusof changing all imperfect metals in the world into gold. In the second place, he hasit in his power to make stones and diamonds far more precious than any that arenaturally procured. In the third place, he has an Universal Medicine, with which hecan cure every conceivable disease, and, indeed, as to the quantity of hisMedicine, he might heal all sick people in the world. Now to the King Eternal,Immortal, and sole Almighty, be everlasting praise for these His unspeakable giftsand invaluable treasures. I exhort all that possess this Treasure, to use it to thepraise of God, and the good of their neighbours, in order that they may not at thelast day be eternally doomed for their ingratitude to their Creator.To God Alone be the GloryNext: The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the Kinghttp://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/openentr.htm (21 of 21) [27/05/2004 23:02:29]"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Three Treatises ofPhilalethes (part 1)CHAPTER IOf the Claims of our Art, its Students, and its MethodAll men who devote their lives to the study of any art, or to any kind ofoccupation, have before their eyes, as the aim of their efforts, perfection in thething which they pursue. But only few attain to the goal of their wishes: there aremany architects, but few masters of the art of architecture; many students ofmedicine, but few men like Hippocrates or Galen; many mathematicians, but fewproficients like Archimedes; many poets, but few worthy to rank with Homer. Yet,even men who have nothing more than a respectable knowledge of their calling,are capable of being useful to society.Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals, however,there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment. A man who studies thisArt, must have either everything or nothing. An Alchemist who knows only half hiscraft, reaps nothing but disappointment and waste of time and money; moreover,he lays himself open to the mockery of those who despise our Art. Those, indeed,who succeed in reaching the goal of the Magistery, have not only infinite riches,but the means of continued life and health. Hence it is the most popular of allhuman pursuits. Anyone who has read a few \"Receipts\" claims the title of a Sage,and conceives the most extravagant hopes; and, in order to give themselves theappearance of very wise men indeed, such persons immediately set themselves toconstruct furnaces, fill their laboratories with stills and alembics, and approach the work with a wonderfulappearance of profundity. They adopt an obscure jargon, speak of the first matterof the metals, and discuss with a learned air the rotation of the elements, and themarriage of Gabritius with Beya. In the meantime, however, they do not succeedin bringing about any metamorphosis of the metals, except that of their gold andsilver into copper and bronze.When captious despisers of our Art see this, they draw from such constant failuresthe conclusion that our Art is a combination of fiction and imposture; whilst thosewho have ruined themselves by their folly confirm this suspicion by preying on thecredulity of others, pretending to have gained some skill by the loss of theirmoney. In this way the path of the beginner is beset with difficulties and pestilentdelusions of every kind; and, through the fault of these swindlers, who givethemselves such wonderful airs of profundity and learning, our Art itself has falleninto utter disrepute, though these persons, of course, know nothing whateverabout it. The beginner finds it extremely difficult to distinguish between the falseand the true in this vast Labyrinth of Alchemy.

I wish, in the first place, to clear our Art from theslanders which have been cast upon it, then to describe the qualifications of itsstudents and its methods of procedure. After these prefatory explanations, I willgird myself to a description of the Art itself.Before I say anything else, I would record my most earnest protest against thatmethod of reasoning by which the deceptions of certain wretched sophists are laidto the charge of this science. The wickedness of some of its lying professors canprove nothing either for or against its genuineness. Such a position could be madegood only by arguments based on natural relations; but such arguments it isimpossible to find. The light of Nature is too bright to be darkened by theseobscurists. I hope my Book will shew that the Transmutation of Metals, from animperfect to a perfect state, is a real and true achievement, and that by theco-operation of Nature and Art. The only thing that distinguishes one metal fromanother, is its degree of maturity, which is, of course, greatest in the mostprecious metals; the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance, butof digestion; in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out itsmetallic impurities. If by any means this superfluous impure matter could beorganically removed from the baser metals, they would become gold and silver. Sominers tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels ofthe earth; and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shortertime by means of our Art. It is a fact that the Mercury which is generated in thebowels of the earth, is the common substance of all metals -- since this Mercurywill enter into combination with every kind of metal -- which could not be the caseif it were not naturally akin to them all. Mercury is a water that will mix withnothing that is not of the same nature. By Art, the handmaid of Nature, Mercurycan be so successively concocted with all metals, that one and the same under thesame colour and flux, may subalternately shew and express the true temperatureand properties of them all. Moreover, all metals are capable of being resolved intorunning Mercury -- and surely this could not be if it were not their commonsubstance. Again, the Mercury of lead may become that of iron, the Mercury ofiron that of copper; while the Mercury of tin may even be transmuted into that ofsilver and gold -- a fact which triumphantly demonstrates the substantial affinityof all the metals. From antimony, too, a good Mercury is obtained, which some ofour Artists are able to change into metallic mercury. It is also a well-establishedfact that the Mercury gained from any metallic or mineral body possesses theproperties of assimilating common Mercury to its own nature; thus commonMercury may become that of all metals in turn. Do not these arguments clearlyshew that there is one Mercury, and that in the various metals it is onlydifferentiated according to their different degrees of digestion or purity? I do notsee how these arguments can be answered. It is possible indeed that some dullperson may allege in refutation of our reasoning his inability to accomplish thosechemical transformations on which it is based; but such operators would bevindicating too great an honour for their ignorance if they claimed to advance it asan argument against the truth of our Art. They must not make their own littleunderstandings the standard or measure of the possibilities of Nature. At any rate,my word is as good as theirs (and better, since they can never prove a negative),and I do most positively and solemnly assert that I have with my own handsperformed every one of the experiments which I have described; and I know manyothers whose experience has shewn these things to be true. How can ouropponents hope to prevail against eye-witnesses by bare negation? My testimony isThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (2 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"borne out by the experience of such men as Albertus, Raymund, Riplaeus,Flamellus, Morienus, and a host of others. I confess that the transformations ofwhich I have spoken are not easy to accomplish, but whoever has the Key of ourArt can unlock all gates, and has power over all the secrets of Nature. But this Keyis possessed only by those who have both a theoretical and a practical knowledgeof natural processes. I could here reckon up divers mutations of metals, as, forinstance, Mars into Venus, by the acid stalagma of vitriol, Mercury into Saturn,Saturn into Jupiter, Jupiter into Lune, which operations, indeed, many vulgarchemists (far enough from the top of the art) know how to perform. I might alsoadd what is known only to a few philosophers, that there is a secret substanceintermediate between metals and minerals the mixed heavenly virtues of whichproduce a certain metal without a name, which is, strictly speaking, not a metal atall, but a Chaos, or Spirit, for it is all volatile: from this all metals can be educedwithout transmutatory Elixir, even gold, silver, and mercury. It is called Chalybs bythe author of the \" New Light,\" and it is the true key and first principle of our Art.What though the Sages have hidden all these things, and set them forthparabolically for the true sons of knowledge? Are they any the less true for thatreason ?... All that is wanted for the perfect development of an imperfectsubstance, is the gentle, digestive action of a homogeneous agent. This agent isgold, as highly matured as natural and artificial digestion can make it, and athousand times more perfect than the common metal of that name. Gold, thusexalted, radically penetrates, tinges, and fixes metals. This scientific fact we mayillustrate in the following manner. If you take six pounds of silver, and gild it witha single ounce of gold, you may afterwards draw out the silver into threads of thegreatest fineness, and still distinctly perceive in each thread the brilliancy of gold.If then this dead, bodily, and earthy metal (which, as a body, of course, has nopower to enter another body) can produce so wonderful an effect, does it seemincredible that the spirit of this gold, which can enter and animate the bodies ofother metals, should transform them into its own nature ? If we had this spiritualtincture, is it not clear that it would do inwardly what the body of the gold is seento do outwardly? Remember that our Tincture is the Quintessence of gold, andinfinitely more perfect than the mere body of gold can ever be; and that it has,therefore, an infinitely greater power of diffusing its essential quality. If gold thusspiritually enters another metal, it will clearly assimilate it to its own nature. Themethod of this spiritual ingestion we shall describe further on. Let us only add inthis place, where we are discussing the rationale of metallic transmutation, thatseed is the perfection of any seed-bearing substance; that which has no seed isaltogether imperfect. It is, then, as the poet sings: \"Gold contains the seeds ofgold, though they be deeply hidden.\" Gold is not only perfect, but the most perfectthing of its kind (ie., of metals). If gold has seed, it must be contained in water,which is the habitation of all spirits, seed being a certain spiritual means ofconserving any species. If gold is to be dissolved for the purpose of educing itsseed, the dissolution will have to take place by means of this same metallic water.When this dissolution takes place, the gold puts off its earthly form, and assumes awatery form. Now, gold being both the starting point and the goal in the whole ofthis generative process, it is clear that all intermediate operations must be of ahomogeneous character, ie., they must consist in gradual modifications of thisseed of gold. The processes of our Art must begin with the dissolution of gold; theymust terminate in a restoration of the essential quality of gold. But as the negativecan never become the positive, the final form of our gold must be essentiallydifferent from its initial one. The final form is so much more noble than the initialone as fire is more subtle and spiritual than earth. What I have written is enoughfor the faithful student of our Art; and to its hostile and carping critics this book isThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (3 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"not addressed. Therefore, I will now go on to add a word or two about thequalifications of those who should study this noble science. Our Art has fallen intodisrepu e, as I have said, through the stupidity and - dishonesty of many of itsprofessors. They are ignorant mechanics who, not having skill and brains enoughfor an honest trade, must needs meddle with our Art, and, of course, soon lose allthey possess. Others, again are only just less ignorant than these persons; they arein too great a hurry to make gold before they have mastered even the rudiments ofnatural science; of course they fail, spend all they have, borrow money from theirfriends, amuse themselves and others with hopes of infinite wealth, learn to talk abarbarous semiphilosophical jargon, and afford a capital handle to those who havean interest in abusing our Art. Again, there are others who really have a trueknowledge of the secret, but who grudge others the light which has irradiatedtheir own path; and who therefore write about it in hopelessly puzzling language,which the perplexed beginner cannot possibly understand. To this class belongGeber, Arnold, and Lullius, who would have done much better service to thestudent, if they had never dipped pen in ink. The consequence is that every onewho takes up this study at once finds himself lost in a most perplexing labyrinth offalsehood and uncertainty, in which he has no clue. I will therefore try to give himsome sound advice as to the best way of accomplishing his object.In the first place, let him carry on his operations with great secrecy in order thatno scornful or scurrilous person may know of them; for nothing discourages thebeginner so much as the mockery, taunts, and well-meant advice of foolishoutsiders. Moreover, if he does not succeed, secrecy will save him from derision; ifhe does succeed, it will safeguard him against the persecution of greedy and crueltyrants. In the second place, he who would succeed in the study of this Art, shouldbe persevering, industrious, learned, gentle, good-tempered, a close student, andneither easily discouraged nor slothful; he may work in co-operation with onefriend, not more, but should be able to keep his own counsel; it is also necessarythat he should have a little capital to procure the necessary implements etc., andto provide himself with food and clothing while he follows this study, so that hismind may be undistracted by care and anxiety. Above all, let him be honest,God-fearing, prayerful, and holy. Being thus equipped, he should study Nature,read the books of genuine Sages, who are neither impostors nor jealous churls, andstudy them day and night; let him not be too eager to carry out every ideapractically before he has thoroughly tested it, and found it to be in harmony notonly with the teaching of all the Sages, but - also of Nature herself. Not until thenlet him gird himself for the practical part of the work, and let him constantlymodify his operations until he sees the signs which are described by the Sages. Norlet him despair though he take many false steps; for the greatest philosophershave learned most by their mistakes. For his guidance in these operations he willfind all the light he requires in the following treatises.CHAPTER IIOf the Origin of this Art and its Writers; its Fundamental Metallic Principles,and the Gradual Production of Metals and MineralsHermes, surnamed Trismegistus, is generally regarded as the father of this Art; butthere are different opinions with regard to his identity. Some say he was Moses; allagree that he was a very clear-sighted philosopher, the first extant author on thesubject, and was also of Egyptian extraction. Others say that Enoch invented theArt, and, before the coming of the Flood described it on the so-called emeraldtables, which were afterwards found by Hermes in the valley of Hebron.

But I do notagree with those who claim for our Art a mystical origin, and thus only make itridiculous in the eyes of a scornful world. If it is founded on the eternal verities ofNature, why need I trouble my head with the problem whether this or thatantediluvian personage had a knowledge of it? Enough for me to know that it isnow true and possible, that it has been exercised by the initiated for manycenturies, and under the most distant latitudes; it may also be observed thatthough most of these write in an obscure, figurative, allegorical, and altogetherperplexing style, and though some of them have actually mixed falsehood withtruth, in order to confound the ignorant, yet they, though existing in many seriesof ages, differing in tongue and nation, have not diversely handled one operation,but do all exhibit a most marvellous and striking agreement in regard to the mainfeatures of their teaching -- an agreement which is absolutely inexplicable, excepton the supposition that our Art is something more than a mere labyrinth ofperplexing words. Our Art is most plainly and straightforwardly expounded byBernard of Trevisa, Ripley the English man, Flamellus the Frenchman, Sendivogius,the author of the \"New Light,\" the anonymous author of the \"Arcanum of Hermes,\"who also wrote Enchiridion Physicae Restituae, and \"The Ladder of Philosophers,\"the great \"Rosary,\" the \"Child's Play,\" the Tract of Dionysius Zachary, the works ofMorienus, the works of Egidius de Vadis, Augurellus' poem entitled \"Goldmaking,\"the works of Peter Bonus of Ferrara, and the \"Abridged Rosary.\" Let the studentprocure one or more of these, and similar genuine works on Alchemy, and let himstudy the secrets of Nature by the light which they throw upon it. He will find aknowledge of natural science, and more particularly of mineralogy, indispensablefor his purpose.All philosophers tell us that there are four elements, which compose all things,and, by means of their diverse combination, produce various forms. But the truthis that there are only three elements, i.e., those which of their own nature arecold -- air, water, and earth. The defect of heat which we perceive in them is inproportion to their distance from the sun. Fire I do not acknowledge as anelement. There is no fire, except the common fire which burns on the hearth; andits heat is essentially destructive. The heat there is in things is the product eitherof light, or motion, or life, or alterative processes. Fire is not an element, but arobber that preys on the products of the four elements; it is a violent corruptivemotion caused by the clashing of two active principles. Thus, we see that it is anoperation of two other substances, not a substance in itself -- a result of the activeco-operation of a comburent and a combustible. The nature and characteristicquality of the three elements is cold, and they possess heat only as an accident...Nor is it true that objects are formed by a mixture of these three elements; fordissimilar things can never really unite, seeing that union is a complete mixtureand concretion of the smallest atoms or molecules of two substances. But such amixture is impossible in the case of two dissimilar matters, as, for instance,between water and earth (or water and wine); they admit of being separated atany time on account of the disproportion of their smallest particles. It may be saidthat for the sake of union the grosser element becomes as subtle as the other; butif this were the case, if for the purpose of union water became as subtle as air,that would simply mean that water became air, an assumption which would thusfail to prove the possibility of an amalgamation of water and air. Is it not a simplerand more credible supposition that only water or air, as the case may be, entersinto the composition of any given object? But if any one still persists in maintainingthis permutation of the elements (which, after all, would only mean that all thingsThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (5 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"consist of air) -- let me ask the humble question -- by the activity of what agentthey are so transmuted? Moreover, one would also be glad to enquire what is theuse of this permutation of earth into water, and of water into air? What can earthconverted into water, or water converted into air, perform, that could not be justas well accomplished by simple unchanged water or air? Surely, Nature doesnothing in vain: I but here would be a difficult and wasteful process oftransmutation constantly going on, which is not calculated to serve any usefulpurpose whatsoever. If it be said that earth rarefied into water is like water, yetnot exactly water, my answer is that this is a mere quibble about words, and thatif the rarefied earth is only like water, and not really water, it cannot possiblycombine with it in its smallest particles; so nothing is gained by this hypothesis.Hence we may conclude that all things derive their origin from one element, whichcan be neither earth nor air. This I could prove at great length if I were notcramped for space. It follows, then, that water must be the first principle of allthings, i.e., of all concrete bodies in this world; earth is the fundamental elementin which all bodies grow and are preserved; air is the medium into which theygrow, and by means of which the celestial virtues are communicated to them. Theseed of all things has been placed by God in water. This seed some exhibit openly,like vegetables, some keep in their kidneys, like animals; some conceal in thedepths of their essential being, like metals. The seed is stirred into action by itsform (i.e., a certain appropriate celestial influence) coagulates the materialwater, and passes through a series of fermentative processes (fermentation beingthe principle of all transmutation), until it has produced that for the production ofwhich it was specially suited. If the seed is metallic, there; generated from it firsta dry liquid, which does not wet the hand viz., Mercury, the mother of all metals.Mercury may be described as the true first matter of metals; for not until theelemental water has become Mercury can it be affirmed with any degree ofcertainty that a metal or mineral must result from it. Water is, in itself,potentially the seed of either an animal vegetable, or mineral; but Mercury ismetallically differentiated water, ie., it is water passed into that stage ofdevelopment, in which it can no longer produce anything but mineral substances.Mercury, then, is the common seed of gold, silver, copper, tin iron, lead, etc.;their difference is only to be sought in the degree of their digestion. The digestiveis not any fat sulphur which is brought to bear on them from without; but Mercurycontains within itself the active principle of its development, viz., the inward heatdue to celestial influences, causing vitality, and dependent on the fitness of thewomb. These heavenly influences are at work throughout the world; but theirexact mode of action is determined by the potential nature of the seed; if theinward life be metallic, the course of its development by means of outward agentswill also be metallic. Still Mercury develops only where these outward influences(celestial and terrestrial) can be brought to bear. In every other place it willappear a cold, dead, and lifeless substance. But in the centre of its nativity it isquickened by the action of celestial influences, conveyed to it through the mediumof air, whence results heat, wherewith life is necessarily associated. Now, thewomb in which this Mercury is placed, is either more, less, or not at all suited toit; and according to the different degrees of this fitness, the substance eitherremains altogether stationary, or is more or less perfectly developed; imperfectionof development yields the imperfect metals, while by means of perfectdevelopment are produced silver and gold; but all metals, though differentiated bythe degree of their digestion or maturity, have the same first substance, viz.,Mercury. The dross and impurities which are largely found in the base metals, formno part of the original Mercury but are added afterwards through some flaw in theprocess of coagulation, or through the impurity of the place or womb in whichThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (6 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"their metallic generation (fermentation) takes place. But I will now go on to dealwith the special subject of this Treatises, viz., . the renovation or multiplication ofgold and silver.CHAPTER IIIOf the Generation of Gold and Silver from the Mercurial Substance, and thePossibility of bringing Imperfect Metals to the same State of PerfectionTo the aforesaid source (Mercury) we trace the birth of gold, and of its sister,silver; they represent this substance brought to perfection by means of digestion.Perfection is of two kinds, inchaotive or complete, partial or entire. Completeperfection (the complete digestion of all crudities and elimination of allimpurities) is the ultimate aim of Nature; and she has reached it in our gold, whichwith its brilliancy lights up the whole earth. Inchaotive perfection may be sonamed, not absolutely but relatively, when compared with essentially imperfectbodies. Those bodies are formally or essentially imperfect in the composition ofwhich the impure predominates over the pure, so that they could never ofthemselves (by natural development attain perfection; this is the case with allmetals except gold and silver. But whenever the pure is freed from the corruptivetyranny of the impure, and obtains the mastery over it, we have inchaotiveperfection, though the development of the body may be still incomplete. Thesecrudities and impurities do not originally belong to the metallic substance, and arevery well capable of being separated from it; if they are so purged off beforecoagulation, we get a perfect metal. But even if they are coagulated together withthe Mercury, it is still possible to separate them from it, and thus to perfect theMercury. It is on this possibility that our Art is based; and its business is to performthis separation. The base metals contain the same mercury as gold; if we can freethis Mercury from the impurities which hinder its development, it must also go onto perfection, i.e., become gold. If we could find some separating agent whichwould perform this office for the impure minerals, it would also be a digestive,i.e., it would quicken the inward metallic digestion of the long-entombed Mercury.Such a separant is our divine Arcanum, which is the heavenly spirit of water withfiery penetrative power. Compared with common gold, it is what the soul is incomparison of the body; and having attained the highest degree of corporealfixity, it takes up the Mercury of the base metals into its own nature, and protectsit from the fire while the impurities are being burnt up. The Mercury of the basemetals (unlike the Mercury of gold), if exposed to the fire without such protection,would not be able to encounter the searching ordeal, but (having no cohesion withits impure body and possessing no fixity in itself) would simply evaporate, andleave the impurities to be burned. But our Arcanum, being both a spiritual and ahomogeneous substance, is capable of entering into a perfect atomic union withthe imperfect metals, of taking up into its own nature that which is like to it, andof imparting to this Mercury its own fixity, and protecting it from the fire, so whenthe fire has burnt up all the impurities, that which is left is, of course, pure gold orsilver, according to the quality of the Medicine -- which from that time forward is(like all other gold and silver) capable of resisting the most searching ordeal. Soyou see we do not, as is sometimes said, profess to create gold and silver, but onlyto find an agent which -- on account of its homogeneity and spirituality -- iscapable of entering into an intimate (atomic) and maturing union with the Mercuryof the base metals. And we contend that our Elixir is calculated, by the intensedegree of its fixity and colour, to impart these qualities to any homogeneoussubstance which does not possess them.The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (7 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVOf the Seed of Gold; and whether other Metals have SeedSeed is the means of generic propagation given to all perfect things here below; itis the perfection of each body; and anybody that has no seed must be regarded asimperfect. Hence there can be no doubt that there is such a thing as metallicseed. If metals have seed, they certainly do not lose it in coagulation, which is theeffect of perfection (or rather of perfect conditions). Now, in all seed-bearingthings maturity means the perfect development of the seeds, and it stands toreason that metallic seed is therefore most certainly not destroyed by coagulation(the maturing process). If it be asked whether all metals have seed, my answer is,that the seed of all metals is the same; but that in some it is found nearer to, andin some further from the surface. All metallic seed is the seed of gold; for gold isthe intention of Nature in regard to all metals. If the base metals are not gold, it isonly through some accidental hindrance; they are all potentially gold. But, ofcourse, this seed of gold is most easily obtainable from well-matured gold itself.Hence it would be lost labour to endeavour to obtain it from tin or lead by somelaborious process, when it may be more readily obtained from gold itself.Remember that I am now speaking of metallic seed, and not of Mercury. Lead is tobe multiplied, not in lead, but only in gold; for only when it attains its maturity asgold can its seed become fruitful. It may be admitted that silver has its own seed,as there is a white (as well as a red) multiplicative Tincture. Still, the WhiteTincture is really contained in the Red; and the seed of silver is nothing but amodification of that of gold. The whiteness of silver is the first degree ofperfection, the yellowness of gold is the second, or highest degree. For the motherof our Stone (the silver of the Sages) is white, and imparts its whiteness to ourgold, whence the offspring of these two parents first becomes white, like itsmother, and then red with the royal blood of its father.CHAPTER VOf the Virtue of Golden Seed, and where it is most readily foundIn order that we may obtain this means of perfecting imperfect metals, we mustremember that our Arcanum is gold exalted to the highest degree of perfection towhich the combined action of Nature and Art can develop it. In gold, Nature hasreached the term of her efforts; but the seed of gold is something more perfectstill, and in cultivating it we must, therefore, call in the aid of Art. The seed ofmetals is hidden out of sight still more completely than that of animals;nevertheless, it is within the compass of our Art to extract it. The seed of animalsand vegetables is something separate, and may be cut out, or otherwise separatelyexhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal, and contained in allits smallest parts, neither can it be discerned from its body: its extraction istherefore a task which may well tax the ingenuity of the most experiencedphilosopher; the virtues of the whole metal have to be intensified, so as to convertit into the sperm of our seed, which, by circulation, receives the virtues ofsuperiors and inferiors, then next becomes wholly form, or heavenly virtue, whichcan communicate this to others related to it by homogeneity of matter. In respectof the Stone, the whole of gold is its substance. The place in which the seedresides is -- approximately speaking -- water; for, to speak properly and exactly,the seed is the smallest part of the metal, and is invisible; but as this invisiblepresence is diffused throughout the water of its kind, and exerts its virtue therein,nothing being visible to the eye but water, we are left to conclude from rationalThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (8 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"induction that this inward agent (which is, properly speaking, the seed) is reallythere. Hence we call the whole of the water seed, just as we call the whole of thegrain seed, though the germ of life is only a smallest particle of the grain. But theseminal life is not distinct from the remaining substance of metals; rather, it isinseparably mingled with the smallest parts of the body. Roughly speaking,however, we describe the whole of our golden water as the seed of gold, becausethis seminal virtue pervades it in a most subtle manner. This seminal virtue theancient Sages called the hidden ferment, the poison, or the invisible fire; again,they said that it was fire, or that fire resided in the water; they distinguishedbetween soul and spirit, of which the former is the medium, the latter the activevirtue. If anyone wonders that we describe water as the seat of the seed, or theseminal spirit, let him remember that in the beginning the Spirit of God moved onthe face of the waters, i.e., penetrated them with His heavenly quickening power.Thus, from the very first day of Creation, water has been the source and elementof all things. For water alone contains the seeds of all things; yet in vegetablesthey are put forth in crude air; in animals they are preserved in the kidneys; whilein minerals they are diffused throughout the whole substance; nevertheless, seedcan never leave its original seat (i.e., water). Things are preserved by that fromwhich they derive their origin; for the cause of their origin being removed, thethings which are the effect must also cease to exist; hence the multiplication andnutrition of all things is in water and through water. Vegetables are generated andnourished by the aqueous Teffas of the earth; animals by the liquid chyle; metalsby the mercurial liquid. Animals preserve their seed in their kidneys, and in duetime project it into the proper womb, where it is first moulded into a tender andvery compacted foetus; this fetus is nourished by the liquid female menstruum,and thus grows until the time comes for it to be born. Then it is nourished withmilk until it can bear stronger food; but this solid food does not become realnutriment until the stomach has converted it into a liquid chyle (as, for instance,bones in the stomach of the dog). In the same way the metals keep their perfectseed where it cannot be seen; but even there it is preserved in water. Thence theArtist extracts it, puts it into its own proper womb, where it is cherished andgrows, until (by means of corruption) it attains to its glorification. This is a mostdifficult operation, because the Metals, in which the seed is hidden, are so firmlyand tightly compacted, and will not yield to violence, but only to a gentle andexquisitely subtle chemical process. Then I say to you, that there is a womb intowhich the gold (if placed therein) will, of its own accord, emit its seed, until it isdebilitated and dies, and by its death is renewed into a most glorious King, whothenceforward receives power to deliver all his brethren from the fear of death.CHAPTER VIOf the Mode and Means of Extracting this SeedThat the most beautiful things are the most difficult to produce is the experienceof all mankind; and it is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the most gloriousof sublunary operations is attended with a very great amount of difficulty. If anystudent of this Art is afraid of hard work, let him stop with his foot upon thethreshold. When, indeed, the Father of Lights has entrusted the Key of the Art toany man, that which remains to be done is mere child's play; his eyes are ravishedwith the sight of the most glorious signs, until the time of harvest arrives. Withoutthis, error and vexation will be the result. Therefore the wise man, beforecommencing the work, will be chiefly solicitous of knowing it by its marks. Let thesons of knowledge learn that the great object of our Art is the manifestation of thehidden seed of gold, which can be effected only by full and perfect volatilisationThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (9 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"of that which is fixed, and the subsequent corruption of its particular form. Tobreak up gold in this way is the most profound secret in the world. It is not broughtabout by corrosive depravation of the metal, nor by the usual method ofdissolution, but by our philosophical solution of the metal into mercurial water, bymeans of a previous mercurial calcination (made by means of the agent ), which isproduced through the subtle rotation and conversion of the elements; thiscalcination, again, is a mortification of our homogeneous liquid with the dryelement belonging to it; afterwards the dry is so far revived by means of this sameliquid, that the perfectly matured virtue, extracted from the substance by thesolvent, is the cause of this calcination and solution. Here, then, there is no roomfor the action of a corrosive. Gold, which is the most solid, strong, fire-proof, andfixed of all substances, is to be volatilised, and no mere corrosive will accomplishsuch a perfect change of nature. The mighty agent required for this purpose mustbe homogeneous, amicable, and spiritual, i.e., it must be akin to the body (ofgold), and yet strong enough to overcome it; and penetrate to its very core, stillleaving each smallest part of the gold true gold. Gold does not easily give up itsnature, and will fight for its life, but our agent is strong enough to overcome andkill it, and then it also has power to restore it to life, and to change the lifelessremains into a new pure body.CHAPTER VIIOf the First Agent or Womb, into which our Seed should be emitted and whereit is maturedThere remains to be found an Agent, by means of which the aforesaid operationmay be performed. For this purpose we require a homogeneous water. For we haveseen that the seed Of gold is concealed, and can remain effectual only in water,and this water must be homogeneous with the body, or else it could not penetrateall the thick integuments by means of which this seed is secured. For likegenerates like, that is to say, every agent that exercises a generative action uponanything, transmutes it (as far as possible) into its own nature. The Agent thenmust be akin to the body which is to be dissolved, and, moreover, perfectly purefrom all dross or alloy. Again, whereas gold is fixed and solid, the Agent must behighly volatile and spiritual; gold is thick and gross, our Agent is subtle gold is deadour Agent is living and life-giving: in short, our Agent should have all thosequalities which gold has not, and which it is to impart to the gold. Hence weconclude that Mercury alone is the true Key of our Art; for it is in truth the drywater described by the Sages, which, though liquid, does not wet the hands, noranything else that does not belong to the unity of its substance.

It is of this water that the Sage uses the words: \"LetAlchemists boast as much as they like, but without this water the transmutation ofmetals is impossible.

All this is the work of ourhomogeneous Agent our Mercurial Ponticum, which is pure crystalline withouttransparency, liquid without humectation, and, in short, the true Divine water,which is not found above-ground, but is prepared by the hand of the Sage, with theco-operation of Nature, which we know, have seen, have made, and still possesswhich also we desire to make known to the true students of our Art, while it is ourwish to hide it only from the unworthy.CHAPTER VIIIConcerning the Genealogy of the Mercury of the Sages, its Origin, Birth, and theSigns which precede and accompany itSome boastful and arrogant sophists, who have read in books that our Mercury isnot common Mercury, and who know that it is called by different names, do notblush to come forward as pretenders to a knowledge of this Art, and take uponthemselves to describe this solvent as diaphanous and limpid, or as a metallic gumwhich is permiscible with metals, though they do not in reality know anythingwhatsoever about it. The same may be said of those who would extract ourMercury from herbs or other still more fantastic substances. These gentry know notwhy the Sages do not use Mercury such as is sold by apothecaries as theirsubstance. They are aware of the fact, but are unacquainted with its causes; andthe consequence is the idea which they have that anything which changes thenature of common Mercury, will convert it into that of the Sages. But in regard tothese foolish persons, I have already expressed our opinion... All metals, as Idemonstrated in the second chapter, have the same substantial principle, viz.,Mercury. From this proposition it follows that the substance of common Mercury ishomogeneous with that of all the other metals, and if the Mercury of the Sages bethe homogeneous metallic water, it can differ from common Mercury only inrespect of its purity and heat. The first substance of common Mercury is that of allother metals, viz., our Mercury. So long as it remains in the veins of the earth, in aplace perfectly adapted to its generation, and is sheltered from crude air, itretains its inward movement and heat, which are the cause of all metallicdevelopment. But if it be marred by any accident, or if the place become unfit forit, the inward movement is stopped, and the germinal life chilled like that of anegg which a hen has left after sitting on it for some time. This is the reason whythose who have attempted to digest common Mercury by means of artificial heathave failed as ludicrously as any one who should endeavour to incubate artificiallyan addled egg. The difference between the egg and the metal is that our Art iscapable of making good the damage, but not by artificial means. We have a crude,undigested, frigid, unmatured metallic mass, which wants the form of our Mercury,for which it must exchange its own, if it is to become that which we seek. Withthis end in view, its deficiencies are twofold; its nature is clogged with superfluousforeign matter, and it does not possess the requisite spiritual virtue. Itssuperfluities consist of earthy leprosy, and aqueous dropsy. Its deficiency is one oftrue sulphureous heat, by means of which it would be enabled to purge off thesesuperfluities. Water, indeed, is the womb, but no womb can receive a vital germwithout warmth. Supplement your (common) Mercury, therefore, with the inwardfire which it needs, and it will soon get rid of all superfluous dross.

This Mercury (with) gold andsilver naturally produces the Arcanum, or potable gold, as all adepts know and cantestify.Here I conclude this Tract, as all that remains to be said is set forth in a special(the next) Treatise.Next: The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 1)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal1.htm (12 of 12) [27/05/2004 23:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next The Three Treatises ofPhilalethes (part 2)Concerning the Philosopher's Stone and its Grand ArcanumThe Philosopher's Stone is a certain heavenly, spiritual, penetrative, and fixedsubstance, which brings all metals to the perfection of gold or silver (according tothe quality of the Medicine), and that by natural methods, which yet in theireffects transcend Nature.It is prepared from one substance, with which the art of chemistry is conversant,to which nothing is added, from which nothing is taken away, except that itssuperfluities are removed. No one will question the utility of our Art, if he believesthat it enables us to transmute base metals into gold. That base metals arecapable of such transmutation is clear; Nature has destined them all to becomegold, but they have not been perfectly matured. If, then, that which hinders theirperfect digestion be removed, they will all become gold; for crude, cold, andmoist Mercury is the common first substance of gold as well as of the other metals.Hence all other metals may be perfected into gold, by the aid of our DivineMagistery, which, being projected upon imperfect metals, has power to quickenthe maturing process by as much as itself exceeds the standard maturity of gold.How patent, then, must the spiritual nature of our Stone be, which can effectmore in one hour by a bare projection than Nature in the course of ages. If thatsubstance which Nature supplies be taken in hand by Art, dissolved, coagulated,and digested, its perfection is increased from a monadic to a denary virtue; byrepeating the same process, it is increased a hundred-fold, and then athousand-fold, etc. This wonderful Medicine penetrates each smallest part of thebase metals (in the proportion of 1::1,000) and tinges them through and throughwith its own noble nature: your arithmetic will fail sooner than its all-prevailingpower. Each smallest part that is pervaded with the vitalizing power of the Elixir inits turn tinges that part which is nearest to it until the whole mass is leavened withits marvellous influence, and brought to the perfection of gold. This is done in avery short time, on account of the spiritual nature of the agent; it is the truemetallic fire, and as a common fire warms even those parts of any object whichare not in immediate contact with the fire, so this Elixir penetrates dissolved andmelted metals in a moment of time-just in the same way as the virtue of leaven oryeast is brought to bear even upon those parts of the meal which it never reaches.A reproach is sometimes levelled at our Art, as though it claimed the power ofcreating gold; every attentive reader; of our former tract will know that it onlyarrogates to itself the power of developing, through the removal of all defects andsuperfluities, the golden nature, which the baser metals possess in common withthat highly-digested metallic substance.Listen, then, while I make known to you the Grand Arcanum of thiswonder-working Stone, which at the same time is not a stone, which exists inThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (1 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"every man, and may be found in its own place at all times. L he knowledge which Ideclare is not intended for the unworthy, and will not be understood by them. Butto you who are earnest students of Nature God will, at His own time, reveal thisglorious secret.I have shewn that the transmutation of metals is not a chimerical dream, but asober possibility of Nature, who is perfectly capable of accomplishing it withoutthe aid of magic and that this possibility of metallic transmutation is founded uponthe fact that all metals derive their origin from the same source as gold, and haveonly been hindered from attaining the same degree of maturity by certainimpurities, which our Magistery is able to remove. Let me tell you, then, what isthe nature of this grand arcanum, which the Sages have called the Philosopher'sStone, but which is in every man, in every thing, at every season of the year, if itbe sought in the right place.It must consist of the elements, for they are the universal substance of all things,and as it is of a nature homogeneous with that of gold, it must be that whichcontains the qualities of all elements in such a combination as to render itincapable of being destroyed by fire. It follows, then, that you must look for thesubstance of our Stone in the precious metals, since the required combination ofelements is not found anywhere else. Those foolish sophists who seek it outsidethe domain of metals will never arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. For there isonly one true principle, and nothing heterogeneous must be introduced into ourMagistery.For as a lion is always born of a lion, and a man of a man, so all things owe theirbirth to that which they are like; that which is combustible is derived from thatwhich is combustible, that which is indestructible from that which isindestructible. Nor must we expect to find the principle which imparts thequalities of gold anywhere but in gold itself. If, indeed, we were able to create thesperm of things, we might hope to evolve this metallic principle from plants oranimals which do not contain it; but that is the privilege of God alone. We must becontent to dispose and develop the sperm which is made ready to our hands-newthings we are unable to produce, and even if we could, our artificial seed would beno better than that which Nature has provided. If any one calling himself a Sagecannot use the things which are already created, it does not seem likely that hewill be able to create new things out of heterogeneous substances-the seeds ofmetals out of herbs or animals.Thus, you see that the Stone which is to be the transformer of metals into goldmust be sought in the precious metals, in which it is enclosed and contained.But why is it called a Stone, though it is not a stone; and how is it to be found? TheSages describe it as being a stone and not a stone; and the vulgar, who cannotimagine how so wonderful a thing should be produced except by art-magics decryour science as impious, wicked, and diabolical. Some silly persons clamour for anAct making the profession or practice of this Art punishable by statute law. Now,one can hardly be angry with the illiterate and ignorant persons who raise this cry;but when it is taken up by men of exalted station and profound learning, onehardly knows what to say. These men I also reckon among the rude multitude,because they are deplorably ignorant of everything pertaining to our Art, and yet,forgetful of their dignity, they join in the hue and cry against it, like so manycowardly village curs.

Some Alchemists who are insearch of our Arcanum seek to prepare something of a solid nature, because theyhave heard the object of their search described as a Stone.Know, then, that it is called a stone, not because it is like a stone, but onlybecause, by virtue of its fixed nature, it resists the action of fire as successfully asany stone. In species it is gold, more pure than the purest; it is fixed andincombustible like a stone, but its appearance is that of very fine powder,impalpable to the touch, sweet to the taste, fragrant to the smell, in potency amost penetrative spirit, apparently dry and yet unctuous, and easily capable oftinging a plate of metal. It is justly called the Father of all miracles, containing asit does all the elements in such a way that none predominates, but all form acertain fifth essence; it is thus well called our gentle metallic fire. It has no nameof its own; yet there is nothing in the whole world whose name it might not withperfect propriety bear. If we say that its nature is spiritual, it would be no morethan the truth; if we described it is as corporeal, the expression would be equallycorrect; for it is subtle, penetrative, glorified, spiritual gold. It is the noblest of allcreated things after the rational soul, and has virtue to repair all defects both inanimal and metallic bodies, by restoring them to the most exact and perfecttemper; wherefore is it a spirit or quintessence.But I must proceed to answer the second and more important part of my question.How is this Stone to be obtained? It does not exist in Nature, but has to beprepared by Art, in obedience to Nature's law. Its substance is in metals; but inform it differs widely from them, and in this sense the metals are not our Stone.For if we would elicit our Medicine fro.-n the precious metals, we must destroy theparticular metallic form, without impairing its specific properties. The specificproperties of the metal have their abode in its spiritual part, which resides inhomogeneous water. Thus we must destroy the particular form of gold, and changeit into its generic homogeneous water, in which the spirit of gold is preserved; thisspirit afterwards restores the consistency of its water, and brings forth a new form(after the necessary putrefaction), a thousand times more perfect than the form ofgold which it lost by being reincrudated.It is necessary, then, to reduce metallic bodies to their homogeneous water whichdoes not wet the hands, that from this water there may be generated a newmetallic species which is nobler by far than any existing metal, viz., our CelestialRuby.The whole process which we employ closely resembles that followed by Nature inthe bowels of the earth, except that it is much shorter. Nature produces themetals out of cold and humid Mercury by assiduous digestion; our Art takes thesame crude, cold, and humid Mercury, and conjoins with it mature gold, by asecret artifice; the mixture represents a new and far more potent Mercury, which,by digestion, becomes not common gold, but one far more noble, which cantransmute imperfect metals into true gold.Thus, you see that though our Stone is made of gold alone, yet it is not commongold. In order to elicit our gold from common gold, the latter must be dissolved inour mineral water which does not wet the hands; this water is Mercury extractedfrom the red servant, and it is capable of accomplishing our work without anyfurther trouble to the Artist. It is that one true, natural, first-substance, to whichThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (3 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"nothing is added, from which nothing is subtracted, except certain superfluities,which, however, it will cast off without any aid by its own inherent vital action.The chief object of your perseverant efforts should be the discovery of thisMercury, or the albefaction of our red Laton; all the rest is mere child's play, asthe Artist has only to look on while Nature gradually matures his substance.But remember that our albification is by no means an easy task. Gold which hasbeen thus whitened can never resume its old form, for, instead of being corporealand fixed, it is now spiritual and volatile. Concentrate your whole mind, therefore,on the whitening of the Laton. It is easier to make gold than thus to destroy itsform; he who so dissolves it may be said rather to coagulate it-for dissolution ofthe body and coagulation of the spirit are coincident in it.Consider these signs, ye sons of knowledge. That which dissolves is spirit; thatwhich coagulates is body. A body cannot enter a body so as to cause dissolution;but a spirit can enter it, attenuate and rarefy it; and as you seek water, you needwater to bring it to light; for every Agent has a tendency to assimilate to itselfthat which it acts upon, and every natural effect is conformed to the nature of theefficient; hence water is necessary if you would extract water from earth.When I speak of water, I do not mean aquafortis, royal water, or any othercorrosive whatsoever, for these waters, instead of dissolving metals, only corrode,mar, and corrupt them, without destroying their old form, to which task they areinsufficient, as they are not of a metallic nature. No, our water is the waterMercury, which dissolves homogeneous metallic bodies, and mingles with them inindissoluble union, abides with them, is digested with them, and together withthem becomes that spiritual whole which we seek. For everything that dissolves asubstance naturally (still preserving the specific properties of the thing dissolved)becomes one with it both materially and formally, coalesces with it, and isthickened by it, thus nourishing it; as we see in the case of a grain of wheat,which, when dissolved by the humid earthy vapour, thereby takes up that vapouras its radical moisture, and grows together with it into a plant. We may alsoobserve that, every natural dissolution being a quickening of that which was dead,this quickening can take place only through some vital agent which is of the sameessence with the dead thing; if we wish to quicken the (dead) grain of wheat, wecan do this only by means of an earthy vapour, which, like the grain itself, is aproduct of the earth. For this reason common Mercury can have no quickeningeffect on gold, because it is not of the same essence with it. A grain of wheat sownin marshy soil, so far from being quickened into life, is, on the contrary,destroyed, because the aqueous humour of the soil is not of the same nature. Inlike manner, gold, if mixed with common Mercury, or with anything except its ownessential humour, is not dissolved, because such waters are too cold, crude, andimpure; for which reason, being utterly unlike gold, they cannot amalgamate withit, or attain with it to a far nobler degree of development. Our Mercury, indeed, iscold and unmatured in comparison with gold; but it is pure, hot, and well-digestedin respect of common Mercury, which resembles it only in whiteness andfluxibility. Our Mercury is, in fact, a pure water, clean, clear, bright, andresplendent, worthy of all admiration.If you wish for a more particular description of our water I am impelled by motivesof charity to tell you that it is living, fluxible, clear, nitid, as white as snow, hot,humid, airy, vaporous, and digestive, and that gold melts in it like ice in warmwater; moreover, that in it is contained the whole regimen of fire, and the sulphurwhich exists but does not predominate in it.

It isBernard of Trevisa's clear pellucid Fountain, in which our King is cleansed andstrengthened to overcome all his foes. All you have to do is to find this water andto put into it the purified body; out of the two Nature will then produce our Stone.This mineral water can be extracted only from those things which contain it; andthat thing from which it is most easily obtained is difficult to discover, as is alsothe mode of its extraction.

If you canobtain it, you have the key of the whole work, with which you can open the mostsecret chambers of knowledge. Its nature is the same as that of gold, but itssubstance is different, and the preparation of it causes a great stench. Weigh wellthe possibilities of Nature; refrain from introducing any heterogeneous elementinto our Magistery, and do not blame me if you fail to understand my words. . OurStone is produced from one thing, and four mercurial sub-. stances, of which one ismature; the others pure, but crude, two of them being extracted in a wonderfulmanner from their ore by means of the third. The four are amalgamated by theintervention of a gentle fire, and there subjected to coction day by day, until theyall become one by natural (not manual) conjunction.Afterwards, the fire being changed, these volatile substances should be fixed anddigested by means of heat which becomes a little more powerful every day (i.e.,by means of fixed and incombustible Sulphur of the same genus) until the wholecompound attains the same essence, fixity, and colour.There are twelve degrees or phases of this our process, which I may brieflyenumerate and describe as follows. The first is Calcination.Calcination is the first purgation of the Stone, the drying up of its humours,through its natural heat, which is stirred into vital action by the external heat ofwater-whereby the compound is converted into a black powder, which is yetunctuous, and retains its radical humour.This calcination is performed for the purpose of rendering the substance viscous,spongy, and more easily penetrable; for gold in itself is highly fixed, and difficultof solution even in our water; but through this calcination it becomes soft andwhite, and we observe in it two natures, the fixed and the volatile, which we likento two serpents. In order that a full dissolution may be made, there is need ofcontrition, that calcination may afterwards produce a viscous state, when it willbe fit for dissolution.When the substances are first mixed, they are at enmity with each other, byreason of their contrary qualities, for there is the heat and dryness of the Sulphurfiercely contending with the cold and moisture of the Mercury. They can only bereconciled in a medium which partakes of both natures, and the medium in whichheat and cold are reconciled is dryness which can co-exist with both. Thus coldand heat are brought to dwell peaceably together in the dryness of the earth, anddryness and moisture in the coldness of the water.

Again, the woman must reign,before she is overcome by the man. The dominion of the woman is in the water,and if the man overcome her in the element in which both her qualities of coldnessand moisture inhere, he will easily conquer her where she has only one quality.Calcination, then, is the beginning of the work, and without it there can be neitherpeaceable commixtion nor proper union. The first dealbation reduces thesubstance to its two principles, sulphur and quicksilver, the first of which is fixed,while the other is volatile. They are compared to two serpents, the fixedsubstance to a serpent without, and the volatile substance to a serpent with,wings. One serpent holds in his mouth the tail of the other, to shew that they areindissolubly conjoined by community of birth and destiny, and that our Art isaccomplished through the joint working of this Mercurial Sulphur, and sulphureousMercury. Hence the whole compound is at this stage called Rebis, because thereare two substances but only one essence. They are not really two, but one and thesame thing the Sulphur is matured and well digested Mercury, the Mercury is crudeand undigested Sulphur. It has already been said that in our Art we imitateNature's method of producing metals in the bowels of the earth, except that ourmethod is shorter and more subtle. In metallic veins only crude and frigid Mercuryis found, in which the inward heat or dryness (i.e., Sulphur) can scarce make itsinfluence felt. No digestive heat is found there, but in the course of ages animperceptible motion changes this metallic principle. In the course of centuries,however, this imperceptible digestive heat changes the Mercury into what is thencalled fixed Sulphur, though before it was denominated Mercury.But in our Art, we have something besides crude and frigid Mercury, viz., maturegold, with its manifold active qualities. These are united to the passive qualities ofour Mercury; and so one aids and perfects the other, and as we have two fires,instead of the one slow inward fire of Mercury, the operation is more expeditious,and something far nobler than common gold is produced.Thus you see that in our Art we have two Sulphurs and two Mercuries (i.e.,Sulphur, and Mercury of Mercury, and Sulphur and Mercury of gold), but their onlydifference consists in degrees of perfection and maturity. Now, the perfect bodyof gold is reduced to its (two) first principles by means of our Divine water whichdoes not wet the hands (viz., Mercury and Sulphur). This operation for a time givesthe ascendancy to the female agent; but this being unnatural, the male agent soonreasserts itself, and by means of its heat dries up the moisture of the femaleagent, and-through calcination-converts it all into a most subtle and viscouspowder, which powder is then changed by dissolution into a water, in which thespirits of the solvent and the thing dissolved, the male and the female principles,are mingled. But the inward heat, which has once been roused into action, stillcontinues to work, separating the subtle (which floats on the surface) from thegross (which sinks to the bottom), until the man has gained the upper hand, theinseparable union takes place, and the male impregnates the female; the femaleThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (6 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"brings forth a nebulous vapour, in which they are putrefied and decay, and fromwhich both arise with a glorious body, no longer two, but only one by inseparableconjunction. This new birth is then coagulated, sublimed, nourished, and exaltedto the highest degree of perfection, and may afterwards be indefinitely multipliedby fermentation, and used both for projection and as an Universal Medicine. Wesee, then, that these black and fetid ashes are not to be despised, since theycontain the Diadem of our King; your substance will never be white, if it has notfirst been black. It is by means of putrefaction and decay that it attains theglorified body of its resurrection. Therefore, you should honour the tomb of ourKing, for unless you do so, you will never behold him coming in his glory.A great many students make a mistake at the very outset by performing thiscalcination on a wrong substance-borax, or alum, or ink, or vitriol, or arsenic, orseeds, or plants, or wine, vinegar, urine, hair, blood, gum, resin, etc; or theychoose a false method, and corrode instead of calcining the metallic bodies onwhich they operate. Calcination can take place only by means of the inward heatof the body, assisted by friendly outward warmth; but calcination by means of aheterogeneous agent can only destroy the metallic nature, in so far as it has anyeffect at all. Every calcination of gold, which is not succeeded by a spontaneousdissolution, without laying on of hands, is also fallacious.The true calcination is by means of Mercury, which (being added to gold in dueproportions) softens and dissolves the gold, and, by its inward heat, united tooutward heat, stirs into action the native heat of the gold, and thus causes it todry up its humidity into that fine, viscous, black powder. And this is the true key ofthe work-to incrudate the mature by the conjunction of an immature-beingincrudated to calcine it-being calcined to dissolve it-and all this philosophically,not vulgarly.The outward signs of the calcination are as follows:-When the gold has becomesaturated with water, and the fire of the Mercury has called into play the heat ofthe bath, the water which was so brilliant begins to grow dim, then visibly swellsand bubbles, until the whole becomes a fatty and viscous powder, which, however,still retains its radical humour. For when the heat first begins to operate, the coldand the moist seek refuge by rising to the top; thence they descend in liquid formand assimilate as much of the substance as they can to themselves; thus thepowder is converted into a glutinous water. For between the different processes ofour Art, there exists such a concatenation that not one can be produced orunderstood without the rest. In order to hide our meaning from the unworthy, wespeak of several operations; but all these-the whole progress of the substance fromblack to white and red-should be philosophically understood as one operation, onething, one successive disposition to black, white, and red.The following rules should be observed if you wish to bring about true calcination:-In the first place, you must procure our Mercury; common Mercury will produce noeffect if you operate on it till doomsday.Secondly, the external fire of the furnace should be neither too violent (in orderthat the equilibrium of chemical forces in the substance may not be disturbed),nor yet too gentle, so that the action of the inward fire may not languish for wantof outward heat. It should be just such as to keep up an equable vital warmth.In the third place, the Laton should receive neither too much nor too little todrink. If it receive too much, it will not be able to give it out, and a nebulousThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (7 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"tempest will arise; if too little, it will be burnt to cinders. The activity of theSulphur must dry up the superfluous humour of the Mercury; therefore, the active(sulphur) must not be swamped with too much sperm; nor must the moisture bechoked with too much earth. The proportions should be between two or threeparts of water to one of gold; but the larger the quantities of both substances, themore perfect will the calcination and dissolution be. The chief mistake againstwhich you must guard is the swamping of your earth with water. For the earthcontains the fire, which is the principal digestive in our Art.In the fourth place, you should take care to seal up your vessel properly, toprevent the spirit from evaporating. Consider how carefully Nature has closed upthe female womb to prevent anything from escaping or entering that might provehurtful to the young life; and quite as much (if not more) care is required in ourMagistery. For when the embryo is being formed, great winds arise, which mustnot be allowed to escape-or else our labour will have been all in vain.The fifth requisite in our work is patience. You must not yield to despondency, orattempt to hasten the chemical process of dissolution. For if you do so by means ofviolent heat, the substance will be prematurely parched up into a red powder, andthe active vital principle in it will become passive, being knocked on the head, asit were, with a hammer. But our true calcination preserves the radical humour inthe body dissolved, and converts it into an unctuous black powder. Patience is,therefore, the great cardinal virtue in Alchemy. It must not be supposed that thesigns and colours which I describe appear on the first day, or even within the firstweek: Bernard of Trevisa tells us that he waited in an anguish of expectation forforty days, and then returned and saw clouds and mists. You need the patience ofthe husbandman, who, after committing the seed to the earth, does not disturbthe soil every day to see whether it is growing... As soon as you have preparedyour substance i.e., mixed mature yellow sulphur with its crude white sulphur, putthem in a vessel and let them stand undisturbed; at the end of twenty-four hours,the Mercury, which is attempting to rouse the latent fire of the sulphur, will beginto effervesce and send up bubbles. But little variation of colour shall appear untilthe object of the Mercury has been accomplished, and the Royal Bath prepared; atfirst it is the Mercury alone that is at work. When, however, the Bath has beenmade hot (i.e., the inward warmth of the gold roused) the greater part of our workis over, and we shall be easily able to distinguish the various operations. The firstcolour which appears after the silver colour of the amalgamated body, is notperfect blackness, but only a darkish white; the blackness becomes morepronounced day by day, until the substance assumes a brilliant black colour. Thisblack is a sign that the dissolution is accomplished, which does not come about inone hour, but gradually, by a continuous process; for the Tincture which comes outof the Sun and Moon appears black to the eyes, but is insensibly and imperceptiblyextracted. When the whole of the Tincture has been extracted from the body thatis to be dissolved, the blackness is complete. The more you digest the substance atfirst, the more you subtilize the gross, and blacken the compound. There are fourprincipal colours, the first of which is blackness; and it is of all colours the mosttardy in making its appearance. But as soon as the highest degree of intenseblackness has been reached (there being no idle intervals in our work), that colourbegins little by little to yield to another. The time during which this blackness isdeveloped is very long, and so is the time during which it disappears; but it is onlyfor one moment that the blackness neither increases nor decreases: for things findrest only in that which is the end of their being, but blackness is not the end of oursubstance.The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (8 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The advent of the blackness is like the coming of the night, which is preceded by along twilight-when the last ray of light has faded away, the blackness of night hascome; only our work is more tedious, and the change is, therefore, still lessperceptible.It may be objected that the black tincture begins to be extracted as soon as theinward heat is roused, and that, therefore, the colour which appears must be,from the very first, an intense black. My answer is that the Tincture which isextracted is, as a matter of fact, not black, but of a dazzling white; and that theblackness is produced gradually, through the action of the water on the body, outof which it draws the soul (the tincture), thus giving the body up to decomposition.It is this putrefaction (the result of the mutual action of the Sulphur and Mercury)which imparts to the Tincture its black colour; in itself the Tincture is brilliantlywhite. How long, then, will you have to wait till perfect blackness appears?Flamellus tells us that this intense blackness comes at the end of about forty days.Ripley advises us to let the mingled substances remain together for six weeks, untilthe conception has taken place, during which time the fire must be very gentle.And Bernard (of Trevisa) suggests the same thing, when he says in his parable: \"The King doffs his glorious robes, and gives them to Saturn, who clothes him in agarment of black silk, which he retains for forty days.\" Of course, the blacknesswhich is here spoken of is not equally intense all the time, as you will understandfrom what has been said above.In the course of this change from white to black, the substance naturally passesthrough a variety of intermediate colours; but these colours (being more or lessaccidental) are not invariably the same, and depend very much on the originalproportion in which the two substances are combined. In the second stage, duringwhich the substance changes from black to white, it is already far purer, thecolours are more lucid, and more to be depended upon. In the two phases thereare intermediate colours; but in the first they are more dingy and obscure than inthe second, and very much less numerous. In the progress of the substance fromblackness to whiteness (i.e., the second phase of our Magistery), the mostbeautiful colours are seen in a variety such as eclipses the glory of the rainbow;before the perfection of blackness is reached, there are also some transitioncolours, such as black, azure, and yellow-and the meaning of these colours is thatyour substance is not yet completely decayed; while the body is dying, the coloursare seen, until black night shrouds the whole horizon in pitchy gloom. But whenthe process of resurrection begins (in the second phase) the hues are morenumerous and splendid, because the body is now beginning to be glorified, and hasbecome pure and spiritual.But in what order do the colours of which we speak appear? To this question nodefinite answer can be given, because in this first phase there are so muchuncertainty and variation. But the colours will be the clearer and more distinct,the purer your water of life is. The four principal colours (white, black, white red),always follow in the same order; but the order of the intermediate colours cannotbe so certainly determined, and you ought to be content if within the first 40 daysyou get the black colour. There is only one caution you should bear in mind, inregard to this point: if a reddish colour appears before the black (especially if thesubstance begins to look dry and powdery at the same time), you may be almostsure that you have marred your substance by too violent a fire. You should be verycareful, then, about the regulation of your fire; if the fire be just hot enough, butnot too hot, the inward chemical action of our water will do the rest.The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (9 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Our Solution, then, is the reducing of our Stone to its first matter, themanifestation of its essential liquid, and the extraction of natures from theirprofundity, which is finished by bringing them into a mineral water; nor is thisoperation easy: those who have tried can bear out the truth of my words.Next: The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 2)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal2.htm (10 of 10) [27/05/2004 23:02:33]"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Index Previous The Three Treatises ofPhilalethes (part 3)Our Magistery consists of three parts: the first deals with the essential andsubstantial composition of our Stone; the second describes their manner ofcombination; the third the mode of chemical procedure. Our substances are \"redore,\" or matured Sulphur, and water, undigested Mercury, or \"white ore.\" To thesea vessel is added, a furnace, and a triple fire. In discussing their manner ofcombination, we have to consider their weight and the regimen. The weight istwofold, and so is the regimen: between them they produce the followingprocesses -- Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Putrefaction,Distillation, Coagulation, Sublimation, Fixation, and Exaltation. The first twoproduce the black, viscous powder, by means of the \"unnatural fire,\" a temperate,incomburent, and altering ignition. There is then a further change into a mineralwater. The three operations which follow are the result of the first and third fires,namely, natural and contra-natural, and \"circulate\" the substance, until the grossis separated from the subtle, and the whole is evenly tempered, the separatedelements being then recombined, impregnated, and putrefied.The five last operations are the result of natural fire which increases and getsstronger from day to day, purifying the putrefied substance of its dross, bycontinual ascensions and descents. This process is therefore called distillation,volatilization, ablution, imbibition, humectation of the earth, and is continueduntil the dryness gradually thickens the substances, and, finally, under theinfluence of coction or continued sublimation, induces fixation, the terminal pointof which is exaltation, an exaltation which is not local, from the bottom to thesurface, but qualitative, from vileness to the highest excellence.These operations are sometimes called regimens; but there. are only two kinds offire, the natural and the non-natural, the latter being employed to call out theactivity of the former. Putrefaction precedes regeneration, and is caused by thestrife of the two fires. That part of the work which is subsequent to putrefactionand conjunction, when the Sulphur and the water have become one, and alsoreceive congelation, is effected by the natural fire alone.The substances are our body (commonly styled Lemnian earth) and our water (ourtrue rain water). Our water is the life of all things, and if you can by much toilobtain it, you will have both silver and gold. It is the water of Saltpetre, andoutwardly resembles Mercury, while inwardly at its heart there burns purestinfernal fire. Do not be deceived with common quicksilver, but gather that Mercurywhich the returning Sun, in the month of March, diffuses everywhere, till themonth of October, when it is ripe.Know that our Mercury is before the eyes of all men, though it is known to few.When it is prepared, its splendour is most admirable; but the sight is vouchsafed tonone, save the sons of knowledge. Do not despise it, therefore, when you see it inThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (1 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"sordid guise; for if you do, you will never accomplish our Magistery -- and if youcan change its countenance, the transformation will be glorious. For our water is amost pure virgin, and is loved of many, but meets all her wooers in foul garments,in order that she may be able to distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. Ourbeautiful maiden abounds in inward hidden graces; unlike the immodest womanwho meets her lovers in splendid garments. To those who do not despise her foulexterior, she then. appears in all her beauty, and brings them an infinite dower ofriches and health. Our Queen is pure above measure, and her splendour like thatof a celestial being -- and so indeed she is called by the Sages, who also style hertheir quintessence. Her brilliancy is such as baffles imagination, and, if you wouldhave any idea of it, you must see it with your own eyes. Our water is serene,crystalline, pure, and beautiful- though it can assume its true form only throughthe aid of our Art. In that form it is our sea, our hidden fountain, from which goldderives its birth by natural descent; yet it is also stronger than gold, andovercomes it, wherefore gold is united to it, and is washed in it, and the twotogether grow up into a strong hero, whom neither Pope nor Emperor can buy for aprice. Hence you should, above all things, seek this water, by means of which(with the solitary addition of a clean and perfect body) the Stone may beprepared.But it requires profound study to become acquainted with all the secrets of oursea, and with its ebb and flow. It took me 18 months, after I had discovered thespring of our water, to find the method of making it well forth, because I did notknow the meaning of the fiery furnace of the Sages. When I discovered it, indeed,the sight which I beheld richly rewarded me for all my pains. I was then suddenly,as by a flash of inspiration, enabled to understand all the secret words andenigmas of the Sages. Our water is the fire which causes both death, and, throughdeath, a more glorious life. Whoever discovers it has reached the autumn of hisMagistery, as Nature will then (when the pure body has been put into it) performall the other processes, and carry the substance onward to perfection through allthe different regimens. This water, though one, is not simple, but compounded oftwo things: the vessel and the fire of the Sages. and the bond which holds the twotogether. So when we speak of our vessel, and our fire, we mean by bothexpressions, our water; nor is our furnace anything diverse or distinct from ourwater. There is then one vessel, one furnace, one fire, and all these make up onewater. The fire digests, the vessel whitens and penetrates, the furnace is the:bond which comprises and encloses all, and all these three are our Mercury. Thereare many kinds of fire (and of water) in our Magistery, but all these only representdifferent aspects of our Mercury.There is only one thing in the whole world from which our Mercury can beobtained. It is like gold in essence, but different in substance, and if you changeits elements you will have what you seek. Join heaven to earth in the fire of love,and you will see in the middle of the firmament the bird of Hermes. Do notconfound the natures, but separate and re-combine them, and you will reign inhonour all your life.In the South-west there is a high mountain (very near the Sun), one of seven, andthe second in height This mountain is of a very hot temperature (because it is notfar from the Sun), and in this mountain is enclosed a vapour or spirit, whoseservices are indispensable for our work. But it does not ascend, unless it isquickened, nor is it quickened unless you dig knee-deep on the summit of themountain. If you do this, a subtle exhalation (or spirit) ascends, and is congealedby the air into drops of beautifully limpid water -- which is our water, our fire, ourThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (2 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"vessel, and our furnace; not common Mercury, but the hot and moist liquid of mostpure Salt, which we call Mercury, because in comparison with the Sun, it isimmature and cold. If the Almighty had not created this Mercury, thetransmutation of metals would be impossible, because gold does not tinge unless itbe first tinged itself. Our Mercury is the beloved spouse of gold, and changes itsbody into a purely spiritual substance; gold loves it so, that for very love he dies,and is revived by his spouse, and she is impregnated by him, and conceives, andbears a most beautiful royal son. The whole knowledge of our Art consists in thediscovery of this our sea; any Alchemist who is ignorant of it, is simply wasting hismoney. Our sea is derived from the mountain of which I told you above. Theexhalation or white smoke which ascends there, will accomplish our wholeMagistery. There is another secret which you should know if you wish to see yourhope fulfilled, viz., how you are to dig a hole in the mountain, as its surface isimpenetrable to ordinary tools, its dryness being such that it has become harderthan a flint. But in the places of Saturn a small herb is found, called Saturnia,whose twigs appear dry, but in whose roots there is abundance of juice. This herbyou should carefully take up with the roots, and carry with you to the foot of themountain, and, with the help of fire, bury it beneath the mountain; its virtue willat once penetrate the whole mountain, and soften its earth. Then you may ascendto the summit, easily dig a hole knee deep, and pour in so much dry and viscouswater, that it penetrates to where the herb lies buried, and makes it ascend as afume, which carries upward with it the spirit of the mountain. This spirit is thestrength of fire mingling with water, and dwelling in it. The spirit of Saturnia is thewhitening fume, the vapour of the mountain is fire, and all these things are fire.Thus you obtain Saturnia, the royal plant and mineral herb, which together withfat flesh makes such a soup as to eclipse the richest banquets in the world. Here isan enigmatic description of our water, which should in course of time and study,become plain to the diligent enquirer. There is the King (gold), and the waterwhich is the King's Bath; our water is the vessel, inasmuch as our King is enclosedin it, and the furnace, inasmuch as our fire is enclosed in it, and our fire, inasmuchas the virtue or spirit of the mountain dwells in it, and the woman, inasmuch as itreceives the vapour of the plant Saturnia; and as the dear friend of the Sunpenetrates, whitens, and softens it, and causes it to emit its sperm. Then the fieryvirtue which is in the water, begins to act on our body, wasting and mortifying it,until at length the innate heat of the Sun is roused into activity. Our Stone iscalled a little world, because it contains within itself the active and the passive,the motor and the thing moved, the fixed and the volatile, the mature and thecrude -- which, being homogeneous, help and perfect each other. We have alreadyshewn that our object in adding matured Sulphur to crude Mercury (the same thingin different stages of development), is to shorten and accelerate the naturalprocess. Gold is a hot and dry body, silver a frigid and humid one, Mercury themeans of conveying tinctures. The body of the Sun is most highly digested, that ofthe Moon imperfect and immature, while Mercury is the bond by which these twocontraries are united. Join the Moon to Mercury by means of proper heat, so thatthe two become one Mercury which retains its inward fire; then the Mercury willbe freed from all dross and superfluities, and it will become transparent like thetears we shed, though not exactly perspicuous. If you then unite this purifiedMercury to gold, in which is the Moon and fire, the hot and dry will love the-coldand humid, and they will unite on the bed of the fire of friendship; the man willdissolve over the woman, and the woman be coagulated over the man, till thespirit and the body become one by commixtion. Continue the same operation (letthe heaven descend to the earth) till the spirit puts on the body, and both arefixed together. Then our Stone will have obtained its royal virtue. For Mercury isThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (3 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"the water of all metals, and they are digested in it. When vegetables are boiled inordinary water, which is naturally frigid and humid, it partakes of their qualities,and is yet separable from them; so the pure Mercury, which is in all metals andminerals, is perfectly separable from the dross and foreign matter which hasbecome mixed up with them; yet the different minerals and metals qualify theMercury in the same way as the water is qualified by the vegetables cooked in it.There are these two differences between the Mercury and the water, that thewater is not coagulated and fixed with the vegetables as our water is with themetals; and that, while the colour of common water is changed by anything boiledin it, Mercury retains its own colour and fluxibility, though its essence is qualified.Therefore the Mercury is effectual in the dissolution of the metal, and the metal inthe coagulation of the Mercury; and as, in the dissolution, the form and colour ofthe metal is latent in the form and colour of the Mercury, so, in coagulation, theform and colour of the Mercury is hidden in the form and colour of the metal;neither do the qualities of the metal in dissolution prevent the fluxibility of theMercury, nor the qualities of Mercury in coagulation the fixity of the metal. Do younot here observe a wonderful harmony between Mercury and the metals? For theirlove is like that of mother and son, sister and brother, male and female. Hencethey are calculated mutually to perfect each other, the water imparting to thebody a spiritual and volatile nature, while the body gives to the water a corporealsubstance. The reason that the colour of Mercury is not changed in coction by thedissolved body, is this: the earth and water in the Mercury are homogeneous, andso well tempered that neither can be separated from the other, and they are sowell mixed that the whole substance exhibits (together with great fluxibility) sogreat a consistency as entirely to conceal the colours -- and only if a part of theMercury is destroyed or marred by some deleterious chemical corrosive, are thecolours seen. The relations of Mercury in respect of earth and water are these: inrespect of water it is fluxible and liquid, in respect of earth it moistens nothingbut what is of the same essence with it. These hints will enable you to detect anyerrors in your treatment of Mercury. Some obstruct or divide its homogeneity byunduly drying up its water; others corrupt the earth and render it diaphanous bydisproportionate mixing. Mercury is the sperm of the metals; it contains in itselfthe Sulphur by which alone it is digested (through which Nature would in course oftime have matured it into gold); nor would it be possible to convert Mercury intogold without it. This mature Sulphur, then, is radically mixed with the Mercury,and rapidly digests it, while itself is putrefied by the Mercury, and is revived again,not as common, but as spiritual, penetrative, and tinging gold, which has power topurify imperfect metals of all their dross, and to change them into its own nature.Thus you see that none of the Mercury should be destroyed, or violently dealtwith; all you have to do is to add to it a mature body sprung from the same root,and mix the two in their smallest parts, by mea s of our cunning conjunction(which is performed, not by a manual, but by a purely natural process, of whichthe Artist does not even understand the cause). We must distinguish, however,between our transmutative conjunction, and a sort of conjunction practised bysophists which is merely a fusing together of the two substances, and leaves eachexactly what it was before. In our operation the spirit of gold infuses itself into thespirit of Mercury, and their union becomes as inseparable as that of water mixedwith water. The conjunction can take place only by means of the Moon or animperfect body and fire; and this Moon is the sap of the water of life, which ishidden in Mercury, and is stirred up by fire; it is a spirit which enters the body,and compels it to retain its soul. We speak not of common Mercury (which lacksthe spirit and fire), but of our Mercurial water -- though common Mercury may bemade like it by the addition of that which it lacks. Our conjunction is the grandThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (4 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"secret of our Art for earth is not inseparably united to water, but the union ofwater with water is indissoluble; hence our conjunction can take place only afterdissolution, which dissolution takes place through the Moon and fire that are in theMercury.

But gold is not the substance ofour Stone in its whole essence, nor yet Mercury. What we want for our work ofgeneration is the seed of gold which is profoundly hidden in our metal. This seedmust be received into its own proper womb, and there mingle with the femaleseed, in order that, being kindly fostered with heat, and fed with its properaliment, it may become that part of gold which is of abundant use in our work. Itis not the whole of a man that generates the infant, but only his seed, which isrightly disposed in the proper womb; and so only the seed of gold (and not thewhole metal) is useful for our metallic generation. Gold is the Father of our Stone,the substance of our Stone is in gold, but gold is not the substance of our Stone;yet there is that in gold (the sperm) which, by right manipulation, may become ourStone. We extract from gold, by a cunning process, that which is its most highlymatured virtue, and this is called, not common, dead, but our living gold. Thedifference between common gold and our gold, is that which exists between aFather and his seed; common gold is dead and useless, as far as our work isconcerned, until it emits its living seed. Take the body of gold, then, and gentlyextract from it its seed, and you will have the living male seed of our Stone, whichwe now no longer call gold, but ore, magnesia, lead, etc. -- because it is no longera body, like gold, but a chaos, or spirit, which cannot revert to its corporeal form.Aristotle says: \"The first thing you should do is to sublime the Mercury, then youshould put a pure body into the pure Mercury.\" The sublimation of the Mercurywhich is here referred to, is not an artificial, but a true and natural one. It is the \"first preparation of the thin substance,\" by which the eclipse caused by theinterposition of Earth is removed from the Moon, enabling her to receive the lightof the Sun -- which happens when the murky sphere of Saturn (that overshadowedthe whole horizon) is removed, and Jupiter ascends the throne; then there risesupward a mist of dazzling whiteness, whence there is distilled upon the earth apure, sweet, and fragrant dew, that softens it and stirs up great winds at itscentre; these winds bear our Stone upward, where it is endowed with heavenlyvirtue, and thence descending once more to its nurse, the earth, is clothed uponwith a corporeal nature, and thus receives the strength both of things above and ofthings below. This living gold is \"that which is, but does not appear till it pleasesthe Artist, and in the knowledge of which is the secret of all perfection.\" Mercuryis our field, in which the Sun rises and sets; let the two be inseparably united onthe bed of love, till from this (regenerate) Mercury there comes forth a quickeningvirtue, which is able to raise the dead. Then there will appear the royal child,whose father is the Sun, whose mother is the Moon... Besides these things, weneed, of course, a furnace of clay, a vessel of glass, and a triple fire; but we donot call these three our vessel, our fire, or our furnace, because ordinary sophistsemploy these things as well as the Sages; when we speak of our vessel, ourfurnace, and our fire, the terms are to be interpreted in accordance with theThe Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (5 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"explanation which we gave above. Of this fire a Sage might well say: \"Behold, thefire, which I will shew you, is water \"; - and again, \"The vessel of the Sages is theirwater.\" Another Sage says, that all our operations take place in our humid fire, inour secret furnace, and our hidden vessel, and thereby clearly shews that theremust be a fire, vessel, and furnace, other than those which ignorant Alchemistspossess in greater perfection and abundance than we. Our appliances are part ofour substance, and are described by Sendivogius, for instance, as the \"vessel ofNature,\" and the \"fire of Nature.\" This practice is followed by Flamellus, Artephius,Lullius, and all other Sages; and I tell you that these three appliances are, afterall, only one; for the nature of our substance is one. Our fire is that whichdissolves and heats bodies more effectually than ordinary fire; hence it is calledardent wine and a most strong fire, and the Sages bid us burn our ore with ourmost strong fire -- words which are falsely interpreted of an ordinary coal fire. Ofthis fire John Mehungus writes: \"No artificial fire can infuse so high a degree ofheat as that which comes from heaven.\"The Three Treatises of Philalethes (part 3)http://www.fratermd.co.uk/waitingconversion/Hermetic Museum/philal3.htm (6 of 6) [27/05/2004 23:02:34]"}]
